Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.\" Shutterstock / sasha2109\n\nWe Brexiters promised a rational transition from the EU\u2019s institutional trajectory toward full political union, to an arrangement of political independence underpinned by continuing economic and trade partnerships.\n\nFor \u201clong-march\u201d Brexiters like me, this inevitably meant leaving the EU and its common policies on trade, fishing and agriculture, and repatriating the UK\u2019s full political and legal independence, whilst maintaining close economic and institutional links with the EU via the European Economic Area (or an agreement like it), and continuing joint UK-EU projects like (to name just two) Erasmus and Galileo.\n\nThe EU and its member states would remain extremely important partners and friends, with the UK continuing to work closely with them on key common interest issues, like climate change, migration pressures, and while Russia seems ready to go rogue at any moment. Working with the EU, but not run by the EU.\n\nSadly this promise has been subverted by those inside and outside the Conservative Party who have pushed both May and now Johnson to adopt an extreme vision of Brexit which will not only fail to deliver the economic value a proper Brexit would, but is in fact a Brexit certain to cause an economic shock I can only conclude is deliberate. This will only fuel demands to return to EU membership granted on worse terms than we have now.\n\nFurthermore, it is a Brexit which destroys diplomatic partnerships we have worked hard to foster since the 1950s, and in a quite appalling manner, attacks key domestic institutions such as parliament, the judiciary, the union and even the monarch. It even plays fast and loose with the peace in Ireland, which risks a return to violence we\u2019ve not seen since the 1990s.\n\nIn short, it is about as un-Conservative as it is possible to be.\n\nThis sham-Brexit is a Trojan Horse designed to hoodwink the UK into a set of economic and trade policies we would never consciously consent to. It is therefore a wholly illegitimate and undemocratic Brexit which threatens to destroy the very things we set-out to save. The mandate to leave was never a mandate to destroy our constitution in order to deliver it.\n\nThe very criticism we (rightly) made about the EU must now be levelled against ourselves: we use sophistry to avoid the need to justify outcomes which lack democratic consent, we misrepresent obvious realities, and we ignore the rules to suit our objectives.\n\nWorse, while it was inevitable Brexit was always going to attract unwelcome support from small-minded racists, anti \u201cforeigner\u201d sentiment is now the predominant aspect of Brexit-vocabulary, a virus poisoning national life, shamefully driving-out those Europeans who made the UK their home. Nothing illustrates this more than the recent appalling attacks on Angela Merkel by Leave.eu, comparing her to Hitler.\n\nThe irony is those who hark back to plucky Britain defeating European fascism are perilously close to the very fascism they ridicule. Arron Banks and Nigel Farage live in a 1940s mind-set of Brits still at war with Europe, are a national embarrassment, advocating simplistic nationalist and authoritarian solutions to complex international problems. Whilst not being in office, they seem to be in power.\n\nI cannot, with any credibility, be critical of an EU which preaches democratic values it does not sufficiently practise whilst not at the same time criticising what Brexit has become; a bitter, hate-filled revolution which if not redirected, will damage our country, its global standing and its peoples for many years to come. It will also destabilise Ireland and potentially the EU. That is not only unfair, it is dangerous.\n\nWe need urgently to pause for reflection, hold some form of national conversation and ensure that any Brexit we now advance is one based on liberal values, democratic consent and sustainable economics, and isn\u2019t a Brexit reflecting only the values of a small minority of the population.\n\nIt has to be a Brexit which delivers the promise as well as limiting the negatives so remain supporters can also tolerate it. Because consent has been a feature of our constitution since the Model Parliament of 1290s when King Edward decreed \u201cwhat touches all must be decided by all\u201d. And parliament was established precisely to be the voice of the people deciding on the people\u2019s behalf.\n\nSo the \u201cwinner takes all\u201d Brexit now being advanced by government is wholly unconstitutional in that it ignores the legitimate desire of the 48 per cent who voted against it to moderate its negative impacts. And parliament, not the government, is the people, so parliament, and not government, must be the final arbiter of how Brexit is implemented.\n\nRight now, that government is pursuing a Brexit which will make the UK poorer economically and socially, will destabilise our neighbours and will fatally undermine the very institutions it sought to empower. It is a form of Brexit that does not enjoy majority support, and probably never did.
