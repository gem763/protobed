It is only the fourth time that the maximum prize has been won since EuroMillions - available in nine European countries including France - fixed its winnings cap in 2012, the French branch FDJ said on Tuesday evening.\n\nThe lucky player now has to come forward and claim their money.\n\nThey will also have to decide whether to go public with their new multi-millionaire status or remain anonymous.\n\nIt took a record-breaking run of 18 rollovers, when nobody wins the top prize, to push the booty up to its maximum amount, and it then went another four draws before finally being won.\n\nTuesday's massive prize still pales in comparison to the $1.537bn Mega Millions US lottery jackpot won last year by a lucky punter in South Carolina.\n\nThat person chose to remain anonymous.\n\nApart from France, EuroMillions tickets can be bought in in Austria, Belgium, Britain, Ireland, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain and Switzerland.", "description": "Someone in Britain became 190 million euros ($208 million) richer on Tuesday when they won the maximum EuroMillions jackpot, the lottery company announced.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8967/c68caa88acff41e09dd79d1e7c8c6cab.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
