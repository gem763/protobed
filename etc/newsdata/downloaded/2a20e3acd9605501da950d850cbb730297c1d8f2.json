They played 60-odd games and for one week he had his full squad available. That\u2019s the reality of top-level physical sports now.\n\n\u201cOne of the things I think we did well in the warm-up games was create that adaptable squad and I think that\u2019s the way the game is going; having adaptable squads. Obviously you have a strongest team, but the reality of putting all your marbles into that team is unrealistic. I have a much more open approach to selection because of that and it has evolved quite quickly in the last three or four months.\u201d\n\nJones could yet go full-strength with his side should he decide it necessary to take Tonga as seriously as possible, though he has to take into account their second match of the World Cup pool stage against the United States that comes just four days later.\n\nWhat the fixture list does give England though is a progressive path through the pool stage, with their weakest opponents according to the World Rugby rankings in 16th-placed Tonga up first, before taking on the USA (13th), Argentina (11th) and France (8th).\n\nWith that in mind, Jones expects England to face five tough matches in a row if they reach the final, but history has lead the Australian to lead towards demanding seven wins from seven if they are to lift the Webb Ellis Cup.\n\n\u201cI think it has changed a lot. We\u2019ve got to win seven games in a row, and it\u2019s the only tournament in the world where you\u2019ve got to win seven games in a row, on consecutive weeks,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWith the quality of teams having arisen over the last four years in particular, you\u2019ve now got at least four difficult games. For us to win the World Cup we\u2019ve got five difficult games in a row so it\u2019s about consistency, resilience, being able to keep a calmness but at the same time rise to the physical challenge of being at your best.\u201d\n\nIf England were to come unstuck along the way and qualify for the knockout stage via second place in Pool C, Jones admits it will be difficult to live up to his expectations that they can win the World Cup. \u201cNo team has ever done it because you go on the other side of the draw, which used to be problematic,\u201d he added. \u201cWho knows these days. But history is made to be broken. This could be the one where it is broken.\u201d", "description": "England\u00a0have been challenged by Eddie Jones not to burst out of the gates against Tonga\u00a0next weekend but to time their run in the Rugby World Cup like a thoroughbred horse racing for the Cheltenham Gold Cup.", "authors": ["Jack De Menezes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/14/10/eddie-jones.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
