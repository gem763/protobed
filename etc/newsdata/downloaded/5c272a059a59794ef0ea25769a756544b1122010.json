Violating the law carries a maximum five-year prison term or fine of up to W30 million, but victims are often reluctant to report the abuse for fear that they will have a tougher time finding work again (US$1=W1,188).\n\nThe lawmaker said, \"That more than 26,000 workers were laid off before they were able to spend the entirety of their maternity leave runs completely counter to the government's policy of preventing working mothers from having their careers cut short due to childbirth or childcare. The government must ensure through continued monitoring and supervision that these policies are being implemented properly.\"\n\n", "description": "26,000 Workers Fired on Maternity Leave", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2015/09/14/2015091401412_0.jpg", "published_at": "2015-09-14"}
