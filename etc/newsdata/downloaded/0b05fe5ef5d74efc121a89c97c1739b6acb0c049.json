The JPMorgan Ultra-Short Income ETF JPST, +0.03% has become the second-biggest actively managed exchange-traded fund available, with $7.6 billion of assets under management, according to FactSet data, and it\u2019s only about two years old.\n\nIn a falling-interest-rate environment, \u201ca strategy that can offer a little yield without taking on risk is appealing,\u201d said Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF and mutual fund research for CFRA.\n\nSee: Why the European Central Bank is getting ready to cut rates\n\nJPST mostly invests in investment-grade \u2014 that is, higher-quality, lower-risk \u2014 corporate bonds and U.S. Treasury notes. Also in its portfolio: asset-backed securities and certificates of deposit. Its goal, according to a summary prospectus, is \u201ccurrent income with a focus on risk management.\u201d\n\nThe fund is actively-managed, which means that unlike the vast majority of ETFs it does not track a particular index, but depends on portfolio managers to make choices about the best securities to mostly buy and hold. Despite that, JPST\u2019s expense ratio is only 18 basis points. That\u2019s about half as much as close competitor PIMCO\u2019s Enhanced Short Maturity Active ETF MINT, +0.03%. MINT has been around since 2009 and has about $12 billion under management, according to FactSet data.\n\nFees matter a lot in risk-averse, fixed-income-oriented funds like these, Rosenbluth pointed out. Over the past year, JPST has returned 3.21%, while MINT has returned 2.90%. (MINT says it aims to provide \u201cmaximum current income, consistent with preservation of capital and daily liquidity.\u201d)\n\nJPST\u2019s fee, it\u2019s worth noting, is actually .28%, but as a new fund, it has \u201cwaived\u201d a hefty portion of the management fee to attract more inflows, through at least 2022.\n\nRelated: U.S. Treasurys set to succumb to quicksand of rock-bottom yields thanks to trade war: JPMorgan\n\n\u201cI am pleasantly surprised by how much demand there is for this and other ultra short bond ETFs because there are other ways to generate income in a falling interest rate environment,\u201d Rosenbluth told MarketWatch. Of particular note with JPST, he said, is the \u201cglobal nature of the portfolio.\u201d\n\nIts third-biggest holding, according to documentation available on its web site, is commercial paper from the Bank of China. Bonds issued by banks in Canada and France also round out the top ten.", "description": "The success of a short-term fixed-income fund suggests investors are looking for a little extra yield wherever they can find it.", "authors": ["Andrea Riquier"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HM885_FedPow_ZG_20190709070143.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-29"}
