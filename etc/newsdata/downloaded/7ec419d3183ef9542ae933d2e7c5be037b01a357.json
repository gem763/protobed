An unlikely little movie makes a cameo in the middle of Farrow\u2019s book, however: the 2016 horror-biopic Jackie, which starred Natalie Portman as the First Lady in the days immediately following JFK\u2019s assassination. Jackie was written by NBC News president Noah Oppenheim, whom Farrow alleges worked behind the scenes to orchestrate a cover-up of his revelations about Weinstein, and did not act quickly enough when NBC was confronted with allegations about Lauer.\n\nFarrow maintains that he had much of his Weinstein reporting ready to run on NBC, when Oppenheim refused to pull the trigger, and, instead, was privately friendly with both Weinstein and Lauer. (There seems to be more than a little bad blood between Oppenheim and Farrow, who reportedly is banned from appearing on MSNBC.) Here\u2019s where Jackie gets dragged \u2014 and I mean dragged \u2014 into this, courtesy of Variety.\n\nSome people (ahem) believe that Jackie is an impressive work of art. Other people \u2014 apparently, David Remnick, Mia Farrow, Ronan Farrow, and also my best friend Molly \u2014 do not feel this way. Observe these excerpts from Catch and Kill, where Ronan Farrow refers to Jackie as a \u201cmorose biopic\u201d that \u201cfeatured a lot of dialogue-free long shots of the woman in question pacing around with tear-streaked mascara.\u201d Objectively, these observations are correct. Subjectively, however, this is what makes Jackie great.\n\nSorry to the LA office! That's just the tip of the \"Jackie\" shade iceberg. pic.twitter.com/LcQIrfTTbj \u2014 Kate Aurthur (@KateAurthur) October 9, 2019\n\nWhen Farrow took his story \u2014 complete with recordings of Weinstein trying to bully Ambra Gutierrez \u2014 to the New Yorker, editor-in-chief David Remnick asked who would be foolish enough \u2014 or ignorant enough \u2014 to let a reporter with a story this important leave their office. Farrow told him the executive thwarting his reporting was the same executive who wrote Jackie. Here is what the editor of the New Yorker replied, according to Catch and Kill: \u201c\u2018That,\u2019 Remnick said gravely, \u2018was a bad movie.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe is very shady about \"Jackie\" throughout, which made me laugh! He quotes both his mother and DAVID REMNICK trashing it.\n\n\n\nHere's the page when NYer editors are shocked by the Ambra Gutierrez recording that Oppenheim didn't think was newsworthy. https://t.co/XX0wrAv6MU pic.twitter.com/fJKBZmxYl6 \u2014 Kate Aurthur (@KateAurthur) October 9, 2019\n\nIt is worth noting that, again, Remnick did not say this snidely, or even under his breath. He said it gravely. Ronan Farrow is right about every single thing except for Jackie: Morose and tear-stained is actually very good!", "description": "Some believe that Jackie is an impressive work of art.
