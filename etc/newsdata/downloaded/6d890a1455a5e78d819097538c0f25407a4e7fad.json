I also could hardly believe how early the handwriting looked.\u201d\n\nLike 50 Shades of Grey, the poem was an absolute hit when it was released in 1280.\n\nProfessor Ailes added: \u201cLe Roman de la Rose really was the blockbuster of its day. We know how popular it was from the number of surviving manuscripts and fragments, a picture our fragment adds to, and from the number of allusions to the text in other medieval writings.\u201d\n\nThe specific pages found describe a sexual encounter between the two main characters - the lover and the rose.\n\n(Image: Publicity Picture)\n\nIt includes some rather suggestive lines, including a \u2018stiff and strong\u2019 staff, and \u2018sticking it into those ditches\u2019. We\u2019ll let you make of that what you will!\n\nProfessor Ailes said: \u201cThe Roman de la Rose was at the centre of a late medieval row between intellectuals about the status of women, so we have the possibility that these specific pages were taken out of their original bindings and recycled by someone who was offended by these scenes.\u201d\n\nThe researchers hope the finding will help to shed light on the interpretation of books in the Middle Ages.\n\nProfessor Ailes added: \u201cNo two copies of a text in manuscript are ever identical so each new find adds another piece to a jigsaw which helps us understand how these texts were read and re-interpreted in the Middle Ages.\u201d", "description": "Researchers from the University of Bristol have discovered fragments of Le Roman de la Rose - an erotic poem written in the 1200s", "authors": ["Shivali Best", "Image", "University Of Bristol", "Publicity Picture"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20550649.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_blue-figure-article.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
