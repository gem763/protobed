PRECIOUS-Gold steadies near $1,500 as tariffs on EU boost safe-haven bets\n\n* SPDR Gold holdings near 3-year peak\n\n* Dollar touches one-week lows versus yen, euro\n\n* U.S. non-manufacturing ISM survey data due at 1400 GMT\n\n\n\n(Updates prices)\n\nBy Sumita Layek\n\nOct 3 (Reuters) - Gold steadied near $1,500 on Thursday,\n\nhaving risen more than 1% in the previous session after the\n\nUnited States announced tariffs on European goods, creating more\n\nuncertainty for the global economic outlook.\n\nSpot gold was up 0.1% at $1,500.55 per ounce, by 1312\n\nGMT, while U.S. gold futures GCcv1 eased 0.1% to $1,506.60.\n\nThe United States on Wednesday said it would slap tariffs on\n\ncertain products from the European Union after the World Trade\n\nOrganization gave Washington a green light to impose tariffs on\n\n$7.5 billion worth of EU goods annually in a long-running trade\n\ncase. \"Trump's tariffs against the European Union create a certain\n\namount of uncertainty and potential for economic failure,\" said\n\nSP Angel analyst John Meyer.\n\nGold is considered a store of value during economic or\n\npolitical uncertainty.\n\nAdding to the economic gloom in Europe, a survey showed euro\n\nzone business growth stalled in September as an ongoing\n\ncontraction in manufacturing activity is increasingly affecting\n\nthe services industry. \"It all indicates ongoing stress in the markets and an\n\ninevitable flight into recession,\" Meyer said.\n\nThe U.S. tariff announcement sent world stocks to near\n\nfour-week lows while yields on major benchmark bonds slipped,\n\nreflecting fears about global growth. MKTS/GLOB USD/\n\n\"Gold rebounded to $1,500 on the back of new trade tension\n\n... The short-term trend remains mixed, while the medium-long\n\nterm is still positive for bullion,\" ActivTrades chief analyst\n\nCarlo Alberto De Casa said in a note.\n\n\"The strength of the rebound seen in the last 48 hours is\n\nsignificant, confirming that investors are still seeing any\n\ncorrection in gold prices as a good chance to add more bullion\n\nto their portfolio.\"\n\nGold jumped 1.4% on Wednesday after disappointing data on\n\nhiring by U.S. private employers unnerved investors already\n\nconcerned about slowing growth in the world's largest economy.\n\nFurther supporting gold, the dollar slid to one-week\n\nlows against the euro and yen. USD/\n\nInvestors are now keeping an eye out for September's U.S.\n\nnon-manufacturing due later in the day.\n\nHoldings of the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded\n\nfund, SPDR Gold Shares , rose to 923.76 tonnes on\n\nWednesday, very close to last week's 924.94 tonnes, their\n\nhighest since mid-November 2016. GOL/ETF\n\nPlatinum XPT= rose 0.2% to $888 per ounce, while silver\n\nfell 0.4% to $17.48 an ounce.\n\nPalladium XPD= was down 1.5% at $1,662.75 per ounce.\n\n\n\n", "description": "PRECIOUS-Gold steadies near $1,500 as tariffs on EU boost safe-haven bets", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEF0N0TA_L.jpg"}
