Since David Platt (Jack P Shepherd) went to prison after taking the fall for the theft of Audrey Roberts\u2019 (Sue Nicholls), Max has been mish=behaving and also stopped taking his ADHD medication.\n\nGradually, things have got worse and Shona has been finding herself out of her depth. So when young Harry is attacked, Shona instantly blames Max \u2013 but this ends up being a huge mistake that could be the catalyst for Shona and David losing custody of Max.\n\nFaye Windass (Ellie Leach) is struggling to look after Lily and Harry and Max arrives home in a disruptive and angry mood. As Shona and Sarah (Tina O\u2019Brien) return home to find Max and Lily arguing over the TV, they despair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuddenly, there is a crash and Harry is injured and knocked out cold. As Sarah heads off in an ambulance with Harry, Shona rounds on Max and accuses him of hurting Harry \u2013 to which he claims that it was Lily who pushed him.\n\nAfter a row, Max storms out and later, the mother of Max\u2019s late dad Callum arrives. Marion explains to Shona that Max has been visiting her \u2013 and then accuses her of being an unfit mother to Max because of the rows and the fact that she has been drinking.\n\nMarion goes on to visit Adam Barlow (Sam Robertson) in order to take the first steps towards getting custody of Max and Shona is later crushed with guilt when Lily admits to her that she did oush Harry.\n\nLater, things get even worse for Shona when she receives a text from Marion warning her that her solicitor will be in touch. Shona is then forced to relay the information back to David, who is deeply concerned to hear of Marion\u2019s plans and as he fears losing Max, Shona despairs at being out of control of the situation.\n\nWill Marion take Max away from the family \u2013 and will David blame Shona?\n\nOne to watch: Wednesday 16th October at 7:30pm on ITV.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "The Corrie youngster behaves badly.", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/16_10_coro_shona_max_sarah_1st_ep_02-f990-e1569845104240_1569845212.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
