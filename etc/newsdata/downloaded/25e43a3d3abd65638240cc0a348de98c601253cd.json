Joern Werner, who had only been serving as CEO since March, was replaced by supervisory board member Bernhard Duettmann, whose appointment is for 12 months.\n\nWrite to Sarah Sloat at sarah.sloat@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 24, 2019 04:07 ET (08:07 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
