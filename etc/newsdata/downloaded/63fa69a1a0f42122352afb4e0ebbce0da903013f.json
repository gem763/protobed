I\u2019m one of those 17.4 million and that is not what I want, that is not what I voted for. I want vote my back. I\u2019ve had my vote stolen and I want it back.\u201d\n\nBritons voted by 52%-48% to leave the EU in 2016.\n\nOne of the four founders of the campaign, Olly Knowles, said opinion polls showed Britain no longer wanted to leave the European Union.\n\n\u201cBoris Johnson may have a deal but he doesn\u2019t have the support of the public....The will of the people has changed.\u201d\n\nHowever, opinion polls have shown only minor fluctuations in voters\u2019 views on Brexit since the 2016 referendum and the outcome of any second referendum remains difficult to predict.
