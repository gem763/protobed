Pictured, the Tokyo Motor Show\n\nAccording to Mitsubishi's executive officer for automotive equipment, Hiroshi Onishi, driverless vehicles like the EMIRAI S could help tackle 'societal challenges.'\n\n'To give an example, one of the issues is an ageing society,' he said at the unveiling.\n\n'What we have already actually experienced is that there is an increased number of accidents involving older drivers.'\n\nThe EMIRAI S, he explained, would use sensors to track its passengers' vital signs, from which it could act in response.\n\n'So with this kind of sensing systems, you will hopefully be able to get the number of these accidents down.'\n\n'If it detects the driver is not paying attention or is not feeling well it can initiate an emergency, or stop the car at the side of the road and call a doctor, if necessary,' said Mr Onishi said.\n\nThe company also demonstrated how the EMIRAI S could connect to businesses at a destination \u2014 such as an airport \u2014 to allow passengers to order food and other services to be either ready for their arrival or even delivered to them.\n\nThe vehicle will include voice recognition technology that is capable of processing requests and distinguishing between different voices.\n\nMr Onishi expects that the firm's driverless vehicles would be hitting the roads 'by about 2030' \u2014 and would travel alongside traditional vehicles.\n\nMitsubishi is currently developing new systems to control and guide autonomous vehicles during their journeys.\n\nThese include an approach which combines satellite data with high-definition 3D maps to offer positioning accuracy of around 25 centimetres.\n\nThe design of the EMIRAI S features sensors that can monitor the comfort and health of its passengers and chance in-car settings in response.

Pictured, an attendee at the Tokyo Motor Show\n\nMr Onishi said that managing the mix of human-driven and autonomous vehicles on roads is a challenge that still needs to be addressed.\n\n'That\u2019s a difficult issue because we will still have people driving cars and they make mistakes,' he said.\n\n'The question is who needs to look after who? Who comes first?'\n\n'That is still something that the manufacturers can\u2019t decide, it is basically a societal issue where everyone needs to work together.'", "description": "The Japanese motor firm unveiled a new concept driverless vehicle - dubbed the EMIRAI S - during the Tokyo Motor Show, which ran from October 24-November 4.", "authors": ["Ian Randall For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/10/20121808-0-The_Japanese_motor_firm_unveiled_a_new_concept_driverless_vehicl-a-15_1571909244623.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
