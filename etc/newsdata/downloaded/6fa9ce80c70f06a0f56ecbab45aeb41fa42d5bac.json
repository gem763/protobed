Users will be able to switch it on and off directly from the Quick Settings menu.\n\nArguably the biggest change to Android 10\u2019s design is the removal of the back button. Alongside the Home and app tabs buttons at the bottom of the screen, the back button has been a stable of the Android OS since its inception.\n\nIn its place comes a gesture-based method of navigation, which requires users to swipe the screen from the left or right to go back, depending on the settings.\n\nAs with any major change, the removal of the back button is likely to prove divisive among long-term Android users.\n\nAndroid 10 release date\n\nGoogle appeared to accidentally reveal the release date of Android 10 in August, when two separate customer support agents let slip its arrival during online chats with customers.\n\nWhen asked when the new operating system would be rolled out for the Google Pixel 3a smartphone, both agents said it would arrive on 3 September, 2019.\n\nGoogle does not officially comment on rumour or speculation, however Android updates suggest it will first be launched on Google\u2019s Pixel range of smartphones.\n\nIt is expected that all versions of the Pixel, Pixel 2 and Pixel 3 will be the first to receive the new mobile operating system, despite the fact the original Pixel phone is outside of Google\u2019s stated two-year support window.\n\nOther manufacturers that make use of Android, such as Samsung and Sony, will then receive the new OS in the coming weeks and months.", "description": "The latest version of Android will be one of the biggest updates to Google\u2018s mobile operating system in its 11-year history.
