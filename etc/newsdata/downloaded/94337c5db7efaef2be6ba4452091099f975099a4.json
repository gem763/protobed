Trump has said he did nothing improper and Republicans have largely backed him.\n\nSondland's testimony could be key to the process.\n\nThe ambassador to the EU exchanged a series of text messages with William Taylor, the U.S. charge d'affaires in the Ukrainian capital, that have become central to the question of whether Trump withheld aid as a bargaining chip to encourage Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to look into Biden and his son Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.\n\nTrump asked Zelenskiy in a phone call to conduct such an investigation and he froze nearly $400 million in U.S. military assistance to Ukraine shortly before they spoke.\n\n\"I think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d Taylor said in a text to Sondland.\n\n\"The President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo's of any kind,\" Sondland responded by text after speaking to Trump. Quid pro quo is a Latin term meaning a favor for a favor.\n\nSondland was initially scheduled to testify before the House of Representatives committees last week, but the State Department blocked him from appearing.\n\nThe committees in turn issued a subpoena, and Sondland's attorneys said he would comply.\n\nTrump has increasingly lashed out at Democrats for conducting the probe, and tensions erupted on Wednesday during a meeting at the White House with congressional leaders in which Trump called Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi a third-rate politician.\n\n\n\n\n\nTEXT EXCHANGES SCRUTINIZED\n\nSondland was a Trump political donor and critics have questioned why he was involved with Ukraine as the ambassador to the EU, of which Ukraine is not a member.\n\nIn an Aug. 13 text exchange, Sondland discussed with Kurt Volker, the former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine, a proposed statement by Ukraine that it would investigate Burisma, an energy company, and the 2016 U.S. elections.\n\nHunter Biden was a member of Burisma\u2019s board and Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, has pursued unsubstantiated allegations that Joe Biden in 2016 pushed for the firing of Ukraine's then-chief prosecutor to stop him from investigating the firm.\n\nIn his testimony, Sondland is expected to assert that he did not know that the Burisma probe meant an investigation of the Bidens, and that he believed the 2016 election probe referred to the hacking of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s computer servers, the person familiar with his testimony said.\n\nA discredited right-wing conspiracy theory holds that a U.S. cybersecurity firm fabricated a report blaming Russia and that the servers were moved to Ukraine. The U.S. intelligence community has concluded that Russia hacked the servers as part of an influence campaign to swing the 2016 vote to Trump, a finding supported by a bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee report last week.\n\nThe texts show that Sondland was aware that Zelenskiy was being asked to agree to investigations in return for a White House meeting with Trump. Zelenskiy has said he did not feel pushed about the issue.\n\nIn a Sept. 1 exchange with Sondland, Taylor said: \"Are we now saying that security assistance and White House meeting are conditioned on investigations?\"", "description": "U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland will testify on Thursday before the congressional committees leading an impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump, amid growing tension between Democrats and the White House about the probe.
