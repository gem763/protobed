The first meeting of the sides in the WSL era had given United the blueprint.\n\nManchester United\u2019s Katie Zelem takes second early derby in her stride Read more\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve created chances against them when other teams haven\u2019t,\u201d Stoney said before the cup tie. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to take them though. And we have been wasteful in front of goal, we were wasteful on Sunday [against Tottenham] but it\u2019s something we\u2019re really concentrating on to make sure we\u2019re really clinical in that final third.\u201d\n\nThis time, they were. With United targeting the City full-back Gemma Bonner, drafted into the side in place of Aoife Mannion, who ruptured an ACL against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid on Wednesday, they had an almost instant impact.\n\nLeah Galton received a long ball over the top and she and Bonner went shoulder to shoulder. The defender got a touch but played it back into the path of Galton who cracked a shot that ricocheted off a sea of defending Blues. Hayley Ladd collected the loose ball but was scythed down on the edge of the box. Up stepped the captain, Zelem, who hit a looping free-kick past the diving fingertips of Ellie Roebuck.\n\nWith both sides pressing hard, United continued to have success on the left, exploiting the gap between Bonner and the forward Janine Beckie. Stoney noticed, urging Galton to drop in and take advantage, but Nick Cushing noticed it too, pushing Jill Scott over to fill the hole.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jess Sigsworth slides home Manchester United\u2019s second goal against City.

Jackie Groenen and Kirsty Hanson linked seamlessly to give Demi Stokes the slip before the latter whipped a cross to the feet of Sigsworth who poked in from close range.\n\nCity frustrations told in the 65 minute when Keira Walsh was shown the red card by referee Amy Fearn for a mistimed tackle on Hanson ruling her out of City\u2019s WSL trip to Arsenal next Sunday.", "description": "Manchester United defeated the Continental Cup holders Manchester City 2-0 to leave Group Two North wide open", "authors": ["Suzanne Wrack"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9abd82a19c239a0f5c948ed206c9990cb36b574/1_0_2745_1648/master/2745.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=dc62b888b366ec0e6f0096c107b4a9aa", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
