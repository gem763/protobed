Trump said McAleenan wanted to spend more time with his family and go to the private sector.\n\n\u201cWe have worked well together with Border Crossings being Way down,\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nHis departure creates yet another top-level vacancy in Trump\u2019s Cabinet \u2014 at the department responsible not only for immigration enforcement but also for helping states secure elections.\n\nMcAleenan said in a subsequent tweet that he wanted to thank the president for his support and that he\u2019d work with the Department of Homeland Security on a smooth transition.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Trump hasn\u2019t named anyone to the job yet \u2014 the acting deputy is David Pekoske, the head of the Transportation Security Administration.\n\nMcAleenan, a longtime U.S. Customs and Border Protection official, was seen as a level head who could effectively manage the border crisis, but like many other former administration officials who came before, Trump eventually soured on him.\n\nHis tenure was marked by internal squabbling and jockeying by others in the department vying for top jobs, all playing out against a backdrop of outrage and horror amid reports of children being held in squalid conditions and images of those who perished trying to make the trek.\n\nThe 240,000-person department is tasked with election security and cybersecurity, disaster response and even the Secret Service. But for Trump, the Department of Homeland Security means one thing: immigration. The president\u2019s signature issue makes the department his focus and his ire. Balancing a White House eager to push major changes with the reality on the ground is a constant challenge.\n\nMcAleenan, who has years of experience with border issues, was seen initially in Trump\u2019s circle as someone who could get control over the crisis, despite his stance as a moderate who pushed for aid to be restored to Central American nations.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "President Trump tweeted that his acting DHS secretary was stepping down on Friday night.
