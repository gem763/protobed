Clearly the origins of that are pretty simple. We have been constrained at 55 million tonnes in terms of our port allocation, or we were some six or eight years ago, so we could never focus on incremental tonnes as a means of profitability and viability so we had to focus on costs and margin and that in many ways drives innovation,\" he said on March 21.\n\nPort Hedland berths and bulk handling facilities\n\nOf course this all assumes that helping Roy Hill is at the heart of Mrs Rinehart's move onto the Atlas register.\n\nIt is worth noting that it was her flagship company, Hancock Prospecting, and not Roy Hill, that bought 14.97 per cent of Atlas on June 8; the the day after Andrew Forrest's Fortescue Metals Group emerged with just under 20 per cent of Atlas.\n\nLike Fortescue, Hancock Prospecting has used a wholly owned subsidiary to buy swaps that give it effective rights to a further 4.99 per cent of Atlas, meaning Mrs Rinehart controls about 19.96 per cent of the loss-making junior.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt seems unlikely, but the fact the stake was bought through Hancock Prospecting leaves open the possibility that Mrs Rinehart has motivations beyond Roy Hill.\n\nBattle of the Rich Listers: Andrew Forrest, Gina Rinehart and Chris Ellison\n\nThe arrival of Fortescue and Mrs Rinehart on the Atlas register makes it hard for Atlas' original suitor, Chris Ellison's Mineral Resources Limited, to complete the acquisition it proposed in April.\n\nDocuments filed with the corporate regulator in recent days by DLA Piper's gun lawyer Cameron Bill suggest MinRes owned 3.67 per cent of Atlas on May 31.\n\nThat stake has been dwarfed by the near 40 per cent held by Fortescue and Mrs Rinehart.\n\nIn times like this, the laws of the jungle apply; Mrs Rinehart was recently ranked third on the Financial Review Rich List, Mr Forrest was ranked eighth, while Mr Ellison was ranked 98th with an estimated fortune of $783 million.\n\nOf the three Rich Listers fighting over Atlas' carcass, the latest entrant, Rinehart, arguably has the most to gain. supplied\n\nSo if every other Port Hedland tenant is in the fight, could the port's biggest dog, BHP Billiton, join the battle too?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe doubt it, given chief executive Andrew Mackenzie has been clear that his acquisition laser is firmly focused on copper and oil.\n\nBut then again, that didn't stop BHP bidding for Anglo American's Queensland coking coal assets in 2016, and so long as iron ore delivers 49 per cent of BHP's underlying earnings before interest and tax (as it did in the six months to December 31) relieving some of the congestion around Port Hedland would have to hold some appeal to the Big Thinking miner.\n\nAndrew Forrest's Fortescue Metals Group would no doubt benefit from acquiring Atlas's port assets.
