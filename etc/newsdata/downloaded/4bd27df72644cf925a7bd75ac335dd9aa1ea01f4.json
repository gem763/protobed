Thus, loading up on dividend stocks to buy for a coming downturn seems unnecessary.\n\nOf course, I don\u2019t have a crystal ball: none of us do. Perhaps President Trump can convince the Federal Reserve to perform some fiscal voodoo, keeping the party going. Still, I believe that no matter what your perspective is, dividend stocks represent an important component of your portfolio, and especially at this juncture.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s look at reality. According to data from the Federal Reserve Economic Research, the average price of a house sold jumped over 37% since the beginning of this decade. In contrast, the hourly earnings of all employees only gained a little over 25% during the same period. In many markets, housing affordability greatly exceeds personal income. That\u2019s probably not a sustainable situation, which bolsters the case for recession-resistant dividend stocks to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSecond, it\u2019s not just the U.S.-China trade war that drives the case for contextually defensive dividend stocks. Because we live in a globalized economy, nothing occurs in a vacuum. Germany is finding that out the hard way, with exports to China suffering due to geopolitical conflicts. And if Germany goes down, it could send a ripple effect everywhere else.\n\nFinally, the stock market\u2019s total market capitalization is 144% of the last reported GDP. That\u2019s extreme speculation, meaning you better be right about your non-recession call. Otherwise, here are eight dividend stocks to buy:\n\n\n\n\n\nDividend Stocks to Buy for a Recession: Dollar General (DG)\n\nDividend Stocks to Buy for a Recession: Dollar General (DG) More\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nI usually don\u2019t like to start off my list with speculative or overheated names. However, I\u2019m going to make an exception for Dollar General (NYSE:DG). Yes, DG stock has absolutely soared so far this year, gaining over 48% since January\u2019s opening session. Also, I concede that after a huge jump late August, shares are liable to come down.\n\nWhen or if they do, however, I\u2019d look into picking up shares. Primarily, the enthusiasm over DG stock has fundamental justification. Both Dollar General and rival Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) produced solid earnings results overall. For Dollar General, the discount retailer raised its full-year guidance despite the ongoing U.S.-China trade war.\n\nSecondly, I think investors can reasonably expect bullishness to underline DG stock if our economy weakens. With wage growth not keeping pace with housing prices, a good-sized shock could disproportionately impact our labor market. That would drive increased traffic to discount retailers.\n\nOf course, compared to other dividend stocks to buy, Dollar General\u2019s yield is nothing to write home about. But with its relevant business, DG may offer some capital growth to compensate.\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Depot (HD)\n\nDividend Stocks to Buy Home Depot (HD) More\n\nSource: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com\n\nLogically, recessions make everything worse. Not only must you complete your usual routine, you also must do so with potentially less funds. But what\u2019s truly problematic is that recessions don\u2019t coincide to fit your timetable conveniently. If something goes wrong, it\u2019ll go wrong when it wants to. And that simple thesis underlines Home Depot (NYSE:HD) and HD stock.\n\nAs with Dollar General, HD stock has outperformed many other dividend stocks. Therefore, I\u2019m not necessarily fishing to buy shares right now, especially near all-time highs. But with every dip and dive, HD stock becomes increasingly appealing.", "description": "With the major indices scoring a fairly strong September, recession fears may have subsided for some.
