Chelsea under Frank Lampard have sorted themselves out, he\u2019s getting his ideas across.\n\n\u2018I know it\u2019s a different situation but you\u2019ve got a new manager there who has adopted a style of play he likes, but you just can\u2019t see that with Emery.\n\n\u2018When they haven\u2019t got the ball, they look at sixes and sevens at times. Hopefully, they can become a little more resilient and stop giving the opposition encouragement. It\u2019s that ability to shut the opposition out \u2013 they\u2019ve got to try to introduce that to their game.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018You always need better players \u2013 and central midfield might be one area they look at in January \u2013 but it\u2019s that organisation and getting things across on the training ground and becoming a tough nut to crack, which Arsenal haven\u2019t been for a long time, that Emery needs to focus on.\u2019\n\nMORE: Arsenal issue Reiss Nelson injury update ahead of Europa League clash against Vitoria\n\nMORE: What is Unai Emery\u2019s best Arsenal XI and why isn\u2019t he playing it?", "description": "Chelsea's rapid progress under Frank Lampard is only serving to heap the pressure on increasingly beleaguered Arsenal manager Unai Emery, according to Alan Smith.
