For the whole of 2018, the official tally of births was 918,397, a figure which however excludes babies born to foreigners in Japan and Japanese babies born abroad.\n\nThe decline in births is \"happening faster than official projections had envisioned,\" said Yasushi Mineshima, a spokesman for the National Institute of Population and Social Security Research.\n\nJapan's birth rate has been falling since the late 1970s. In 2005, it reached a record low of 1.26, but then seemed to be on a path of recovery until it started to fall again in 2016, according to government figures .
