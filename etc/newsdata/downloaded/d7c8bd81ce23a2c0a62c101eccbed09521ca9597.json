Still, there was no hiding the recent sharp deterioration in relations.\n\nJust since Monday, Washington has imposed visa restrictions on senior Chinese officials and blacklisted more than two dozen Chinese firms, accusing them of persecuting ethnic Uighur Muslims in China\u2019s western Xinjiang region.\n\nThe measures have outraged Beijing and in the process penalized major players in the artificial intelligence sector, an area where the United States and China are intense rivals.\n\nTrump has both accused China of dragging its feet in the talks and said his economic pressure leaves Beijing with little choice but to seek a bargain.\n\nBut his attitude toward the process is subject to the churning pressures now competing for his attention.\n\nHe faces an intensifying impeachment probe by Democrats and stinging bipartisan criticism for allowing a Turkish assault on Washington\u2019s Kurdish partners to go forward by pulling American forces away from the border in northeast Syria.\n\nWashington accuses China of attempting to dominate global industry through massive state intervention in markets, theft of intellectual property, hacking and subsidies, accusations shared by Europe and Japan.\n\nAnd, while the mood had improved on Thursday, US officials are reportedly studying ways other than tariffs that they can increase pressure on Beijing to overcome its reluctance to address these complaints.\n\nThe New York Times said Thursday that coercive measures under consideration included limiting Chinese companies\u2019 access to capital markets as well as exposing Chinese companies to greater criminal liability under US law, heightened regulatory scrutiny and blocking some US pension investments in China.\n\nMeanwhile, US central bankers and others believe the trade war is raising the chances the United States could slip into recession.\n\n\u201cWe all know the next round of tariffs is going to hurt the United States as much or more than China,\u201d Wendy Cutler, vice president of the Asia Society Policy Institute, told AFP.\n\n\u201cI think neither side will admit it but I think they\u2019re both under pressure to find a way to forestall the next set of tariff increases,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cEvery month that these trade talks continue, there\u2019s more and more friction in the relationship.\u201d", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 President Donald Trump on Thursday hinted at progress in his high-stakes trade battle with China, saying talks with", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/10/d304b2_chinese-trade-envoy-liu-he-is-greeted-by-us-trade-representative-robert-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
