Delete this tweet.\u201d\n\nHouse Majority Whip James Clyburn (D-S.C.), a former CBC chairman and the No. 3 Democrat in leadership, said he wants the full House to vote on a resolution condemning Trump\u2019s lynching comments.\n\nRep.

I think it's consistent. Why would you use the term lynching? Why would you say that? ... I think [it's] because he throws out race, because he knows it's red meat. And he has done that consistently,\u201d Bass told reporters.\n\nTrump\u2019s tweet comes as he\u2019s grown increasingly frustrated with Democrats\u2019 impeachment probe that began a month ago into whether he sought a quid pro quo by withholding military aid from Ukraine until it agreed to launch investigations politically advantageous to Trump. Trump has repeatedly referred to the Democratic inquiry as a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d but Tuesday\u2019s comments took his rhetoric to another level.\n\n\u201cSo some day, if a Democrat becomes President and the Republicans win the House, even by a tiny margin, they can impeach the President, without due process or fairness or any legal rights,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cAll Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here \u2014 a lynching.

It makes you no better than those who wear hoods and white robes. Do you not understand what you're doing to this country?\u201d\n\nThe timing of Trump\u2019s \u201clynching\u201d tweet is striking for a number of reasons.\n\nIt comes just two days before one of Trump\u2019s most powerful critics on Capitol Hill, the late House Oversight and Reform Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings Elijah Eugene CummingsDiplomat who raised Ukraine concerns to testify in Trump impeachment probe House rejects GOP measure censuring Schiff Overnight Defense: Trump weighs leaving some troops in Syria to 'secure the oil' | US has pulled 2,000 troops from Afghanistan | Pelosi leads delegation to Afghanistan, Jordan MORE (D-Md.), will lie in state in the Capitol. A memorial service for Cummings, a former Black Caucus chairman and civil rights champion who was the son of sharecroppers, will be held Thursday in Statuary Hall. And lawmakers from both parties will attend his funeral services in Baltimore on Friday.\n\nTrump enraged Black Caucus members and other Democrats earlier this year when he attacked Cummings\u2019s hometown of Baltimore as a \u201cdisgusting, rat and rodent infested mess.\u201d\n\nNor is it the first time that Trump has angered African American lawmakers by exacerbating racial tensions, like when he attacked black NFL players for kneeling during the national anthem to protest police brutality, referred to African nations as \u201cshithole countries\u201d and personally attacked black lawmakers like Cummings and Rep.

The president should not compare a constitutionally mandated impeachment inquiry to such a dangerous and dark chapter of American history. It's irresponsible for him to do so. And I hope that he will apologize,\u201d House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries Hakeem Sekou JeffriesLawmakers from both sides of the aisle mourn Cummings House chairman: Pompeo not complying with impeachment inquiry Sunday shows - Second whistleblower grabs spotlight MORE (D-N.Y.) told reporters.\n\nBass added in a written statement that \u201cit would behoove\u201d Trump to visit the National Memorial for Peace and Justice, a memorial to African Americans terrorized by lynching, in Montgomery, Ala.\n\nBut black lawmakers acknowledged Trump\u2019s latest effort to invoke racial terms likely won\u2019t be the last as he faces down the threat of impeachment.\n\n\u201cThe lynching analogy is inappropriate. And he's trying to inflame the passions of his supporters. And we'll hear more of that,\u201d said Rep. Hank Johnson Henry (Hank) C.
