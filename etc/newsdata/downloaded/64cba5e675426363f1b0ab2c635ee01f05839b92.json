This is like old Byron Bay. It\u2019s the old true beach house,\u201d he said.\n\nThe two bedroom, two bathroom house they inspected had a spiral staircase, and room for major improvement, according to the couple.\n\n\u201cI like having a beach in the backyard, I like being able to say that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be in this house a long time, our kids are going to grow up here.\u201d\n\nMrs Goldberg agreed: \u201cIt\u2019s our forever home.\u201d\n\nThe couple were planning on rebuilding on the site.\n\nThe price was $3.2m, which was $100,000 less than the Goldbergs expected it might cost.\n\n\u201cTo have a beach in your backyard, to me it\u2019s priceless,\u201d Mr Goldberg said. \u201cI would like to rebuild. I think it\u2019s about position and to have this, the sound, the beach, the beautiful lighthouse in the distance, this is Byron Bay for me. This is for a lifetime.\u201d\n\nFOLLOW SOPHIE FOSTER ON FACEBOOK", "description": "A young family of four with a whopping budget got the property of their dreams after television star Deborah Hutton took them under her wing.", "authors": ["Sophie Foster"], "top_image": "https://www.realestate.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/10010042/capi_e8ee04b3a5b41c2fe8fdd7ddb7fc370b_670c4dbafda2e5ecfad6c03543ede181.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
