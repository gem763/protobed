But on the whole, these bouts of cold and heavy snow will be fewer and farther between as the climate warms.\"\n\nBrignone is just one winter sports athlete who has noticed more erratic weather patterns since she began racing on the World Cup circuit in 2007.\n\n\"It's warmer in the summer, but the past few years, I've never been so cold,\" said Brignone. \"There were times last year in Pyeongchang and in Killington [this year] where it was -25 C. The climate is changing, because in one or two days it will go from -25 C to 5 C. That's crazy.\"\n\nThe rapid deterioration of the glaciers that sustain early season training is forcing today's coaches and racers to reassess how they prepare for the annual circuit.\n\n\"I've been going to glaciers for 20 years to train,\" said veteran World Cup racer Resi Stiegler. \"You wouldn't have even thought it was warm out 10 years ago.

The magic number: 130 hours of snowmaking, or five-days' worth of snow production.\n\n\"We call it a no regrets concept,\" he said. \"We have to take advantage of every hour we can get in October and November.\"\n\nIf anything, the changing climate has helped level the field between those who rely on natural snow and those who don't, says Mike Solimano, president and general manager of Killington.\n\n\"For a long time, we've been less dependent on natural snow than everybody else,\" he said. \"We've had to invest a lot more in snowmaking in the last 25 years than everyone out West.\"\n\nPhotos: World's biggest ski areas Paradiski, France: When the double-decker Vanoise Express cable car opened in 2003 it brought together Les Arcs and La Plagne to form a massive new interlinked area called \" When the double-decker Vanoise Express cable car opened in 2003 it brought together Les Arcs and La Plagne to form a massive new interlinked area called \" Paradiski \" above the Tarentaise valley.

Nearly 100,000m3 of it was left to start the 2018-19 season.\n\nHowever, one of the biggest ironies is that many of the ski racers actually prefer competing on artificial snow.\n\n\"Uniquely, for the World Cup trail, we need nearly all man-made snow,\" Tuaire said. \"There's never more than 50% of natural snow in the mix.\"\n\nFor Brignone, racing on man-made snow translates into faster conditions.\n\n\"The man-made snow is a little more sticky. It's so much more aggressive.
