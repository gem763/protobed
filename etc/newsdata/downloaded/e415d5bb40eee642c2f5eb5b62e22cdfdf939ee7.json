You know who you are. Thanks a million. *btw Texas IS an open carry state.\u201d\n\nSeveral people from unknown Twitter users to blue-check verified blasted Swalwell for his tweet.\n\nOne problem with the left is their obsession with virtue signaling. Whenever there is a tragic event that involves firearms, they quickly jump on Twitter to blame the Second Amendment and not the maniac that used the gun. Leftists rapidly say that they are the superior politicians because they \u201cwant to do something\u201d about firearms.\n\nThe left cannot rightfully use their political stance to claim moral superiority in the gun debate. The left uses women\u2019s rights as a guise for killing unborn babies. The Democratic Party has used \u201cfree\u201d items such as housing, food, and other government programs to recapture votes election-after-election cycle continually. It\u2019s smart politics \u2013 of course. Is it virtuous? Not even close.\n\nI am not saying that the Republican Party is utterly moral in all that they do. However, since the election of President Trump, Democrats have wholly become unhinged and shown their true colors.\n\nThe issue of abortion is the left\u2019s most crucial hypocritical topic. Left-wing actress Alyssa Milano recent let out a barrage of tweets after the moving active shooter incident. She used a 17-month-old infant who was shot by the psychopath. She posted an emotional tweet going into detail of the injuries intended for gun owners to feel bad that they possess firearms.\n\nFor days, Milano went on about the infant and Swalwell is on a crusade to confiscate firearms that he \u2013 a member of the federal government \u2013 deems too dangerous for the citizenry to own. He is a prime example of what our Founding Fathers warned us about, but I digress.\n\nOne of the most disturbing parts about Milano using the infant is that she\u2019s politicizing a baby who was injured in an attempt to further the left\u2019s political goals \u2013 all the while she is proud of her two abortions.\n\nUltimately, the issue of gun control comes down to one thing for Democrats: government control. The pro-choice stance on abortion makes it difficult to believe that the left truly cares about children.\n\nThe Democrats are power-hungry and seeking full control. The only way to get a hold of the American people is to get our weaponry. One way to do it is to continually bark that those who do have weapons and support the Second Amendment do not care about tragic events like mass shootings \u2013 gun shaming. They want to make gun-owners feel bad so that more and more guns are out of the homes of law-abiding citizens.\n\nSwalwell\u2019s tweet was ignorant at best. The famous \u201cgood guys with a gun\u201d adage is accurate. It is obtuse to ignore the fact that guns do save lives daily and to the tune of a million times a year on average, according to the Center for Disease Control in 2013. He must have forgotten that it was an AR-15 and a good guy with a gun that stopped the 2017 church shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas.\n\nGuns are in the way of the leftist political agenda. Democratic politicians have demonized people who own guns and support the Second Amendment.\n\nSwalwell\u2019s mocking of \u201cgood guys with a gun\u201d saying was dim-witted. The left attacks what is a threat to their political aspirations. In the end, good guys with a gun exist daily, and we need more of them \u2013 not less.", "description": "Every time there is a mass shooting, the left quickly .09/06/2019 8:05:12AM EST.", "authors": ["John Dempsey", "Matt Vespa", "Leah Barkoukis", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/191/d8c486d0-a4b1-4442-a269-0a3eea376f56.png", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
