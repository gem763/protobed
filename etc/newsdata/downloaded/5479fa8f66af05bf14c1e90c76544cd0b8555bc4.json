I will now start consulting EU leaders on how to react.\u2019\n\nIt comes after a defiant PM told the commons he will not negotiate another EU membership extension, after suffering an embarrassing defeat in Parliament.\n\nAt a special sitting of the Commons today after MPs voted 322 to 306 to halt the approval of the Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal until all the necessary legislation is in place.\n\nBoris Johnson has vowed to get the UK out of the EU by October 31 despite today\u2019s crushing defeat (Picture: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe amendment tabled by former Cabinet minister Sir Oliver Letwin was intended to force him to comply with the so-called Benn Act, passed last month.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt makes a no-deal Brexit illegal and binds him by law to ask for an extension to January 31 if he could not get a deal through Parliament by 11pm tonight.\n\nBut after this afternoon\u2019s humiliating blow, Johnson said: \u2018I continue in the very strong belief that the best thing for the UK, and for the whole of Europe is for us to leave with this new deal on October 31.\n\n\u2018And to anticipate the questions that are coming from the benches opposite, I will not negotiate a delay with the EU. Neither does the law compel me to do so.\u2019\n\nHe reiterated his stance in a letter sent to Tory MPs and Peers tonight, calling on their support to help him \u2018get Brexit done\u2019 by Halloween.\n\nJohnson wrote: \u2018I have made clear that I do not want more delay. European leaders have made clear they do not want more delay.\n\n\u2018It is to my great regret that today the House has voted for more delay.\n\n\u2018The public want us to get Brexit done so the country can move on. The best thing for the United Kingdom and the European Union is for us to leave with this new deal on October 31.\n\nA letter sent by Boris Johnson to MPs earlier today (Picture: PA)\n\nMPs backed Sir Oliver Letwin\u2019s amendment 322 to 306 (Picture: EPA/UK Parliament)\n\n\u2018I will not negotiate a delay with the European Union. I will tell the EU what I have told the British public for my 88 days as Prime Minister: further delay is not a solution.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to an EU official, the PM told Tusk over the phone this evening he would send a letter asking for an extension past the end of the month.\n\nBrussels sources have indicated that an extension would most likely be granted if asked for.\n\nRepresentatives of the 27 EU member states will meet tomorrow to discuss the latest twists and turns in Westminster.\n\nWaiting for the letter.\n\nI just talked to PM @BorisJohnson about the situation after the vote in the House of Commons. \u2014 Donald Tusk (@eucopresident) October 19, 2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
