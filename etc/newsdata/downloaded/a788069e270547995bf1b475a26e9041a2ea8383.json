He Could Be San Francisco's Next District Attorney.", "language": "en", "published_at": "2019-09-03", "text": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2015 Chesa Boudin\u2019s dad has been incarcerated since he was just a year old, and his mom was behind bars for decades. He thinks that makes him the best candidate for district attorney of San Francisco.\n\n\u201cThe experience of having parents incarcerated is actually, sadly, really normal in this country,\u201d Boudin, 39, told HuffPost in August, noting that nearly half of Americans have close family currently or formerly in jail or prison. \u201cThat\u2019s a lived experience that is in many ways a defining part of modern American culture, but one that\u2019s all too often removed from or ignored by the political class.\u201d\n\nNow a San Francisco deputy public defender, Boudin was 14 months old when his parents, then members of the radical leftist group the Weather Underground, were jailed for driving the getaway car in an infamous 1981 armed robbery in New York in which two police officers and a security guard were killed. His father is still in New York state prison serving a 75-years-to-life sentence, and his mother, who was paroled in 2003, has since earned her Ph.D. and runs an initiative focused on criminal justice and reentry at Columbia University.\n\nBoudin\u2019s progressive platform for district attorney includes closing jails, eliminating cash bail, combating racism in the criminal justice system and diverting people from jails and prisons.\n\nThe experience of having parents incarcerated is actually, sadly, really normal in this country. Chesa Boudin, candidate for San Francisco district attorney\n\nThe Nov. 5 election will be the first time in over a century that San Francisco has an open DA race without an incumbent after outgoing District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n (D) said he won\u2019t run for reelection. And all four candidates in the race will be newcomers to elected office if they win.\n\nThe other front-runner alongside Boudin, Suzy Loftus \u2014 legal counsel in the San Francisco Sheriff\u2019s Department and former president of the city\u2019s police commission \u2014 is also running on a progressive platform. A former prosecutor, Loftus has lined up high-profile endorsements from presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), who was her former boss in the California Department of Justice, as well as California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) and San Francisco Mayor London Breed.\n\nBoudin, meanwhile, has received support from two recent candidates in a growing movement of \u201cprogressive prosecutors\u201d nationwide: Larry Krasner, now DA in Philadelphia, and Tiffany Cab\u00e1n, who recently narrowly lost in Queens. He also has the backing of big-name progressives like activist Angela Davis and the Bernie Sanders-backed group Our Revolution. (While Boudin identifies as a \u201csmall s\u201d socialist, he said he doesn\u2019t find political party labels \u201cparticularly useful,\u201d adding that there are \u201cmany different subgroups\u201d in the Democratic Party.)\n\nNo matter the outcome in November, Boudin plans to visit his dad in prison after the election.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s, in many ways, the defining feature of this race,\u201d Boudin said of growing up with incarcerated parents. \u201cI think it\u2019s imperative people who make the decisions about who should be sent to prison, for what, for how long \u2026 have an understanding of that experience.\u201d\n\nChesa Boudin Boudin visiting his father at Auburn Correctional facility when he was about 4 years old in 1984.\n\nBoudin grew up going to prison to visit his parents. Since he was five years old, he\u2019s spent two to four nights a year with his father in state prison, sleeping in \u201cbasically a trailer home,\u201d as he put it, cooking together, doing homework, watching sports on a small TV.\n\n\u201cGrowing up visiting my parents in prison is a defining part of my life. It\u2019s what led me to start working on criminal justice issues starting in grade school,\u201d Boudin said, adding that he wrote to his dad\u2019s prison warden at age 10 to advocate for changes in visitation policy. \u201cThat gives me a breadth of perspective that\u2019s extremely rare in candidates for office.\u201d\n\nHis parents, Kathy Boudin and David Gilbert, were unarmed in the 1981 robbery but were charged with felony murder under New York law for their involvement. Gilbert will be eligible for parole in 2056 at age 112. Boudin called the law that put his parents away for so long \u201cdraconian.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, I\u2019m really mindful of the fact that three families lost a loved one,\u201d Boudin added. \u201cThey all had kids. Those men will never come back, those families will never be whole again ... And there\u2019s nothing anybody can do \u2015 not me, my parents, not the state \u2015 to restore those families to be what they were.\u201d\n\nHe noted that \u201cvery serious consequences\u201d for actions like those of his parents were \u201cappropriate\u201d as a deterrent and to \u201chonor and dignify the suffering of those families.\u201d\n\nWith his parents behind bars, Boudin was raised by two of their friends, fellow Weather Underground members, and grew up in Chicago. They were an upper-middle-class family \u2015 he went to private school, then Yale for college, got a master\u2019s at Oxford and went to Yale law school.\n\n\u201cIn many ways, I was lucky,\u201d he said of his childhood. \u201cI started off like so many kids with parents in prison \u2015 traumatized, destabilized and behind my classmates in terms of education, behavior control, socialization.\u201d\n\nBut \u201cvery few are lucky enough to have white skin privilege [and] the kinds of support I had,\u201d he said.\n\nBoudin saw therapists as a toddler, had academic tutors and could afford to visit his parents in prison whenever he liked.\n\nNow central to Boudin\u2019s platform for DA is ending \u201cracist disparities [that] plague every step of our criminal justice system.\u201d In San Francisco, black people are nine times more likely to be booked into jails than white people, according to a Human Rights Watch analysis of 2014-2015 county data.\n\nIn liberal San Francisco, all the candidates in the race \u2015 including Leif Dautch, a California deputy attorney general, and Nancy Tung, an Alameda County prosecutor \u2015 are touting their \u201cprogressive\u201d values and calling for some measure of \u201creform\u201d to the criminal justice system (though Tung, as the more tough-on-crime candidate, is considered the most moderate).\n\nBut Boudin insists that while their rhetoric may seem similar, there are specific proposals in his platform and experiences in his record, that set him apart.\n\nHe\u2019s the only public defender in the race and was a leader in the yearslong effort in San Francisco and California to challenge the cash bail system. Earlier this year, a federal judge ruled that San Francisco\u2019s cash bail system violated the rights of poor defendants (the judge still has to issue an injunction for the system to change in practice), and at the state level, California residents will be voting in 2020 on whether to eliminate cash bail statewide.\n\nBoudin is also pushing for a dedicated immigration unit in the DA\u2019s office that would, among other things, advise attorneys how to pursue charges that would be \u201cfair\u201d for a given crime without having additional \u201clife-altering consequences\u201d such as deportation, Boudin said. He also wants the DA\u2019s office to pursue charges against federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents if they \u201ccome into our neighborhoods and break the law,\u201d as he put it.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re acting like the Gestapo in our communities and somebody has to stand up to them, and I will,\u201d Boudin said of ICE.\n\nJail should be a last resort. Boudin\n\nHe\u2019s also committed to closing jails, namely San Francisco\u2019s County Jail No. 4, where inmates are housed in a building considered seismically unsafe. His plan is for the city to reduce the total inmate population across all its jails so this one can be closed for now.\n\n\u201cJail should be a last resort,\u201d Boudin said, noting that many people are there simply because they can\u2019t afford bail. On a given day in 2016, nearly half of the jail population in San Francisco would have been eligible for release if those inmates simply posted bail, per a report from the office of the city treasurer.\n\nAbout 40% of people booked in San Francisco\u2019s jails are homeless or insecurely housed, according to the city health commission, about 1 in 5 are diagnosed as seriously mentally ill, and about three-quarters reported substance use (not including marijuana).\n\nBoudin wants \u201cevery arrest to be an opportunity for intervention\u201d to divert people from the criminal justice system into programs for mental health, addiction and housing.\n\n\u201cWe need a district attorney who understands the big picture and what\u2019s driving crime \u2015 we can\u2019t jail our way out of the problem,\u201d he said.\n\nChesa Boudin Boudin and a former client walking down a San Francisco street.\n\nSuzy Loftus\u2019 team says she wants the same things. The 45-year-old San Francisco native and former prosecutor also supports closing County Jail No.4 and calls for alternatives to locking people in jails and prisons to address \u201cour over-reliance on incarceration,\u201d her website says.\n\nLoftus is proposing creating a civil rights unit in the DA\u2019s office to address racial bias in the system, her spokesperson Debbie Mesloh said. The unit would also look at issues like wrongful convictions and immigration, which Boudin has stressed in his campaign.\n\nBut Boudin argues that Loftus\u2019 rhetoric doesn\u2019t match her record as a prosecutor.\n\n\u201c[Loftus] says she supports ending money bail; she used money bail in her entire career as prosecutor to detain poor people,\u201d Boudin said. \u201cShe says she supports decriminalizing prostitution and homelessness and supports legalizing marijuana, but as a line attorney she prosecuted all those cases.\u201d\n\nMesloh responded that the criminal justice system had \u201cevolved clearly\u201d since Loftus\u2019 days as a prosecutor \u2015 she worked in the DA\u2019s office from 2004 to 2010. This experience would allow Loftus as DA to \u201cexecute on changes they\u2019re all calling for on reform that\u2019s needed,\u201d Mesloh added.\n\nHaving entered the race months after Loftus, Boudin was neck and neck with her when the latest June fundraising numbers came out, with around $382,000 raised for Boudin and $412,000 for Loftus.\n\nIn late August, just weeks after her loss in the Queens DA race, Cab\u00e1n, also a public defender, traveled to San Francisco to campaign for Boudin. She said his \u201cunique\u201d experience of having incarcerated parents \u201cties him to the people he would be serving\u201d as district attorney.\n\n\u201cThis is not just about bringing this movement to San Francisco. It\u2019s understanding that electing someone like Chesa as DA, it\u2019s going to have an effect around the country,\u201d Cab\u00e1n said.\n\n\u201cWe need to strengthen this team of not just progressive, but decarceral prosecutors,\u201d she added, listing Krasner, Kim Foxx, state\u2019s attorney in Chicago\u2019s Cook County, and Rachael Rollins, DA in Boston\u2019s Suffolk County. \u201cThat\u2019s why I flew across the country \u2015 it\u2019s not just about San Francisco, but about the movement nationally.\u201d", "description": "Chesa Boudin is a public defender whose progressive platform includes closing jails.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d684875250000710a746b7a.jpeg?cache=bnm8hnhnbv&ops=1778_1000"}
