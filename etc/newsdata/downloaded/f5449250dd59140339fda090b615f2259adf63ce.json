S\u00e9bastien Fournier, who has held a number of senior roles at telecommunications firms, will be Hilo\u2019s CEO. (The Logic)\n\nTalking point: This move lets Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec accomplish several goals simultaneously. It aims to reduce electricity consumption\u2014which is good for the environment\u2014but does so in a way that provides a new revenue stream for the utility. Reduced domestic consumption also opens up export opportunities for Quebec. In 2018, the province exported a record 36.1 terawatt-hours of electricity. New York City is hoping to buy more electricity from the province. The reduced consumption could also free up opportunities for the booming cryptocurrency-mining sector in the province, which has clashed with the province over how much electricity it needs.", "description": "", "authors": ["Zane Schwartz"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
