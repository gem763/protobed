(AP) - It looks like the guitar Led Zeppelin\u2019s Jimmy Page played.

It\u2019s the latest step in the Seminole Hard Rock empire, which includes naming rights on the Miami-area stadium where the 2020 Super Bowl will be played.\n\nIt\u2019s a unique addition to South Florida\u2019s tourist landscape and no hotel is like it in the world.
