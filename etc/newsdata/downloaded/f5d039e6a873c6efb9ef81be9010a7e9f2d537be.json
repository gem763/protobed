REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File Photo\n\nBiden\u2019s role at Burisma Holdings Ltd has come under intense scrutiny following unsupported accusations by U.S. President Donald Trump that Joe Biden improperly tried to help his son\u2019s business interests in Ukraine.\n\nInterviews with more than a dozen people, including executives and former prosecutors in Ukraine, paint a picture of a director who provided advice on legal issues, corporate finance and strategy during a five-year term on the board, which ended in April of this year.\n\nBiden never visited Ukraine for company business during that time, according to three of the people.\n\nThey also said that his presence on the board didn\u2019t protect the company from its most serious challenge: a series of criminal investigations launched by Ukrainian authorities against its owner, Mykola Zlochevsky, a multimillionaire former minister of ecology and natural resources. The allegations concern tax violations, money-laundering and licences given to Burisma during the period where Zlochevsky was a minister.\n\nRevelations in a whistleblower complaint that Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, pressed the Ukrainians to pursue investigations into Burisma and the role of Hunter Biden have sparked an impeachment inquiry by Democrats in the House of Representatives. Trump faces allegations that he withheld U.S. military assistance for Ukraine to place pressure on Kiev to investigate his potential Democratic rival in next year\u2019s U.S. presidential election.\n\nGiuliani has alleged, without providing evidence, that Joe Biden pushed for the firing of Ukraine\u2019s top prosecutor to end an investigation into Burisma and Zlochevsky in order to protect his son.\n\nHunter Biden, 49 years old, has denied wrongdoing. In a public statement on Oct 13, his lawyer George Mesires said: \u201cDespite extensive scrutiny, at no time has any law enforcement agency, either domestic or foreign, alleged that Hunter engaged in wrongdoing at any point during his five-year term.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with ABC News aired Tuesday, Hunter Biden said in retrospect it may have been poor judgment to join Burisma\u2019s board while his father was vice president, but added: \u201cDid I make a mistake based upon some ethical lapse? Absolutely not.\u201d\n\nBiden, in the interview added that he didn\u2019t discuss his business dealings in Ukraine with his father, other than one brief exchange in which his father told him \u201cI hope you know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nA lawyer for Hunter Biden didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nJoe Biden has also denied any wrongdoing, saying he called for the removal of then-chief prosecutor Viktor Shokin in 2016 because of his ineffectiveness in tackling corruption in Ukraine, a widespread problem that both the United States and the European Union had long highlighted.\n\nA spokesman for Joe Biden\u2019s presidential campaign, Andrew Bates, said: \u201cDonald Trump is so terrified of running against Joe Biden that he sent his presidency into a tailspin by trying to blackmail Ukraine into intervening in our elections with universally-debunked lies.\u201d\n\nBurisma and Zlochevsky didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn an interview with Reuters in September, former Ukraine prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko said Hunter Biden\u2019s position on the board when his father was vice-president raised no red flags. \u201cFrom the point of view of Ukrainian law, (Hunter Biden) didn\u2019t violate anything,\u201d Lutsenko said.\n\nUkraine\u2019s new general prosecutor Ruslan Ryaboshapka, who took over in August, said he was not aware of any wrongdoing by Hunter Biden. His office announced on Oct 4 that it was reviewing 15 previous investigations related to Zlochevsky but no decision had been taken on how to proceed against him or people related to him.\n\nThe White House declined to comment.\n\n\u201cCEREMONIAL FIGURE\u201d\n\nZlochevsky, who founded Burisma in 2002, served as a minister under Ukraine\u2019s then-President Viktor Yanukovich from 2010 to 2012. Burisma then began adding high-profile names to its board, including Biden and a business associate of his called Devon Archer, in April 2014.\n\nThe company has said it had wanted to strengthen corporate governance. According to two sources close to the company, Burisma was also looking to attract international investment as well as expand overseas.\n\nOleksandr Onyshchenko, a businessman and former member of the Ukrainian parliament who knows the Burisma founder, said it had been Zlochevsky\u2019s idea to appoint Biden as a director. \u201cIt was to protect (the company)\u201d at a time when it was facing investigations, said Onyshchenko, who left the country in 2016. In the run up to Biden\u2019s appointment, a popular uprising led to the removal of the Russian-backed Yanukovich in February 2014.\n\nBiden, a trained lawyer, had served on the board of a U.S. company and had also formed an investment firm with fellow Yale graduates Archer and Christopher Heinz, the stepson of former U.S. Senator John Kerry.\n\nAccording to four sources close to the company, Biden regularly attended Burisma\u2019s twice annual board meetings \u2013 all of which were held outside of Ukraine.\n\nA source close to the company said Biden took part in strategic conversations and shared his opinions and experience. In between board meetings, \u201cthere were constant calls, dialogue, sharing of advice, consideration of different options,\u201d the source said. \u201cExpansion to other markets was also discussed,\u201d the source added.\n\nAnother source close to Burisma said Biden assisted with analysis of oil and gas assets the company was considering buying abroad, though a deal didn\u2019t go through. The company was considering possible acquisitions in Europe, Kazakhstan and the United States, the source and another person close to Burisma said.\n\nBoth sources said that around the time Biden was appointed, Burisma was also looking to secure a financing deal with foreign investment funds, including one in the United States.\n\nBiden helped to find lawyers to work on this process, before it broke down due to the start of the war in east Ukraine, one of those two sources said. \u201cHe was a ceremonial figure,\u201d that person added.\n\nBURISMA PAYMENTS\n\nHow much Biden earned at Burisma has also become a central issue. Trump has portrayed Hunter Biden as having earned vast sums of money while at Burisma, which the president has suggested was an indication of potential wrongdoing.\n\nIn an October 6 post on his usual Twitter account, Trump said Hunter Biden \u201cwas handed $100,000 a month (Plus, Plus) from a Ukrainian based company, even though he had no experience in energy.\u201d He added, in the Twitter message, that it couldn\u2019t have been legitimate and as president he has \u201can OBLIGATION to look into possible, or probably CORRUPTION.\u201d\n\nAccording to payment records reviewed by Reuters that two former Ukrainian law enforcement officials say are Burisma\u2019s, the company paid about $3.4 million to a company that was controlled by Archer called Rosemont Seneca Bohai LLC between April 2014 and November 2015.\n\nSpecifically, the records show 18 months in which two payments of $83,333 per month were paid to Rosemont Seneca Bohai for \u201cconsulting services.\u201d The two sources said that one of those monthly payments was intended for Biden and one for Archer. Reuters was not able to independently verify the authenticity of the documents or how much money Hunter Biden received.\n\nOne of the sources said prosecutors obtained the payment records in the course of one of their investigations into Burisma related to activities at the company prior to Archer and Biden\u2019s appointments to the board. A Ukrainian lawmaker released copies of the records at a conference for news media last week.\n\nA lawyer for Archer didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nINVESTIGATIONS\n\nLutsenko, who succeeded Shokin as Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general in 2016, took over a tax investigation into Burisma before closing the case ten months later, after the company had paid a settlement in relation to the tax investigation.\n\nSlideshow (7 Images)\n\nThe former prosecutor said that any issues Burisma did have were not related to Biden. In addition to the closed tax investigation, Ukraine authorities opened an investigation into licenses awarded to Burisma and a separate money-laundering probe into founder Zlochevsky. Both of these have been re-opened in recent months, but neither relate to the period after Biden joined the board.\n\nBurisma and Zlochevsky haven\u2019t commented publicly on the re-opened probes.", "description": "During his time on the board of one of Ukraine\u2019s largest natural gas companies, Hunter Biden, the son of former U.S. Vice-President Joe Biden, was regarded as a helpful non-executive director with a powerful name, according to people familiar with Biden\u2019s role at the company.", "authors": ["Polina", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442394305&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H1EZ", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
