While rescuing the female, water started coming in round the female and rescue team.\n\n'Both adults were rescued and brought to the shore. They have not required medical attention and safety advice has been given.'", "description": "Brian and Jean Garrett had taken their dogs, Penny and Lucy, for a run along the Humberston Fritties when Jean took a wrong turn and got the couple stranded out in the mudflats.", "authors": ["Ryan Fahey For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/18/20340472-0-image-a-16_1572374305187.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
