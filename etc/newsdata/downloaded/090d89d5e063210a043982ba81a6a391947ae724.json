The news was first reported by Politico.\n\nThe exclusions include things like Christmas tree lights, plastic straws, dog leashes and printed circuit boards, for a total of 437 types of products. They are part of the $250 billion worth of Chinese goods that the U.S. hit with tariffs last year. It was not immediately clear how large a portion of the overall tariffs is covered by the exclusions.\n\nThe exemptions stem from more than 1,100 exclusion requests made by companies and other entities in the United States, according to the documents.", "description": "More than 400 Chinese products will be temporarily exempted from tariffs that President Donald Trump's administration imposed last year.", "authors": ["Evelyn Cheng"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105956464-1560052175844gettyimages-1140444806.jpeg?v=1563497853", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
