REUTERS/Valentyn Ogirenko\n\nDemocrats launched an inquiry to impeach Trump over allegations he pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to help smear Joe Biden, the frontrunner in the race to challenge Trump as the Democratic Party nominee next year.\n\nTrump and Zelenskiy spoke by phone on July 25, and the White House has released a reconstruction of their conversation, in which Trump asks Zelenskiy to investigate the Biden family, and Zelenskiy agrees to do so.\n\nEarlier, Trump had frozen nearly $400 million of aid to Ukraine. His critics accuse him of using the funds as leverage to pressure Zelenskiy into pursuing the investigation.\n\nZelenskiy denies being put under pressure and Trump dismissed the inquiry as a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d.\n\nWHAT ARE TRUMP\u2019S ACCUSATIONS AGAINST BIDEN?\n\nBiden was vice president in President Barack Obama\u2019s administration and the point person for Ukraine. Trump alleges that Biden bullied the Ukrainian authorities to fire General Prosecutor Viktor Shokin in 2016, threatening to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees if Kiev failed to comply.\n\nAccording to Trump, Biden had Shokin fired because he was investigating the activities of Biden\u2019s son Hunter, who was working for a Ukrainian gas company called Burisma.\n\nHunter Biden denies any wrongdoing during his work for Burisma. Joe Biden denies trying to protect his son, and says pressure to fire Shokin was being applied widely by European governments at the time because of concern over corruption.\n\nBurisma was founded by a former minister and member of ex-President Viktor Yanukovich\u2019s party. After the Kremlin-friendly Yanukovich was ousted following street protests in 2014, prosecutors opened a criminal probe into Burisma.\n\nWHAT ELSE DOES TRUMP SAY ABOUT UKRAINE?\n\nTrump\u2019s personal attorney Rudolph Giuliani also alleges some officials in Ukraine conspired to help Trump\u2019s Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton in 2016 by leaking information damaging to Trump\u2019s then-campaign manager, Paul Manafort.\n\nManafort, a long-time Republican political consultant who is now serving a sentence after being convicted of fraud, had worked in Ukraine for Yanukovich for years before being hired by Trump.\n\nGiuliani has singled out Serhiy Leshchenko, a former lawmaker who published details of off-the-books payments made by Yanukovich to Manafort.\n\nHOW DID GIULIANI APPROACH ZELENSKIY?\n\nA former comedian with no prior political experience, Zelenskiy won a landslide election victory in April. Before Zelenskiy was inaugurated, Giuliani announced in May that he would visit Ukraine, but then abruptly canceled his visit saying Zelenskiy was surrounded by Trump\u2019s enemies. He named Leshchenko, who had been an advisor to Zelenskiy during his campaign.\n\nAfter Giuliani canceled the trip, Andriy Yermak, an aide to Zelenskiy, sought to meet Giuliani on what Yermak said was his own initiative.\n\nHOW WAS SHOKIN\u2019S SACKING VIEWED AT THE TIME?\n\nShokin became General Prosecutor in February 2015 at a time when Ukraine\u2019s Western backers were calling for Kiev to tackle corruption in exchange for billions of dollars in aid. Diplomats, anti-corruption activists and some officials accused Shokin\u2019s office of blocking reform and stalling investigations.\n\nShokin\u2019s critics included his deputy, Vitaliy Kasko, who publicly resigned in February 2016 saying the General Prosecutor\u2019s office was a \u201cbrake on the reform of criminal justice, a hotbed of corruption\u201d. Shokin\u2019s office dismissed the resignation as a stunt.\n\nThe U.S. Ambassador at the time, Geoffrey Pyatt, in a September 2015 speech, singled out Shokin\u2019s office as an obstacle to fighting corruption \u201cby openly and aggressively undermining reform\u201d.\n\nWhile Trump calls Shokin a \u201ctough prosecutor\u201d and Giuliani asserts that Shokin was fired for investigating Burisma, Pyatt accused Shokin\u2019s office of deliberately undermining a probe into Burisma\u2019s founder both in Ukraine and in Great Britain.\n\nShokin was pushed out in March 2016, a decision publicly endorsed by the European Union. In 2017, Burisma said all investigations against the company and its founder were closed.\n\nHAS UKRAINE BEEN INVESTIGATING HUNTER BIDEN?\n\nShokin and Shokin\u2019s successor, Yuriy Lutsenko, both spoke to The Hill newspaper in Washington in articles published in March and April of this year. Shokin said before he was fired he had made \u201cspecific plans\u201d for an investigation that \u201cincluded interrogations and other crime-investigation procedures into all members of the executive board, including Hunter Biden.\u201d\n\nLutsenko said he had begun looking into Burisma and Biden\u2019s activities in connection to it. However, Lutsenko told Reuters last week there was no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of Biden\u2019s son in his relationship with the energy firm.\n\nAccording to the White House summary of Zelenskiy\u2019s phone call with Trump, Zelenskiy assured Trump that his next prosecutor general, the man who replaced Lutsenko, \u201cwill be 100% my person\u201d and \u201cwill look into the situation.\u201d\n\nWHAT ABOUT THE U.S. AMBASSADOR?\n\nPyatt\u2019s successor as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine was Marie Yovanovitch, a career diplomat who had previously served as ambassador to other ex-Soviet republics. She returned home in May. Trump strongly criticized her in his phone call to Zelenskiy, and Zelenskiy agreed with Trump\u2019s criticism.\n\nLutsenko has alleged that Yovanovitch had given him a list of people not to prosecute. The State Department called the allegation \u201can outright fabrication\u201d. Trump\u2019s son called her a \u201cjoker\u201d while Giuliani accuses her of colluding on Clinton\u2019s behalf. Yovanovitch left her post after what Democrats called a \u201cpolitical hit job\u201d.", "description": "Ukraine is the unwitting participant in a political battle in Washington between President Donald Trump and the Democrats ahead of the 2020 election.", "authors": ["Matthias Williams", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434174734&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P1AT", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
