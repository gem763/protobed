Now at least a dozen groups have taken up arms and have carried out deadly attacks on army posts and the police. The army has responded by burning villages and shooting dead civilians in the English-speaking areas.\n\nTens of thousands have fled to Nigeria or sought refuge in French-speaking Cameroon.\n\nOpposition parties, civil society groups and representatives of the Catholic Church were present in the main conference centre in the capital Yaounde on Monday.\n\nPrime Minister Joseph Dion, an Anglophone appointed early this year in part to jump-start negotiations, was also present.\n\nDion said the talks were held to end acts of violence and to enable the Northwest and Southwest regions to regain the \u201cnecessary serenity\u201d, adding that \u201call men and women who love peace\u201d had been invited.\n\nCameroon\u2019s linguistic divide goes back a century to the League of Nations\u2019 decision to split the former German colony of Kamerun between the allied French and British victors at the end of World War One.\n\nFor 10 years after the French- and English-speaking regions joined together in 1961, the country was a federation in which the Anglophone regions had their own police, government and judicial system. Biya\u2019s centralisation push since he came to power in 1982 quickly eroded any remaining Anglophone autonomy.\n\nNow, moderates who have long called for a return to some form of federal system to ease tensions say their voices have been drowned out by secessionists on one hand and Biya on the other.\n\n\u201cIt is farcical to not have a commission to discuss federalism, which is at the core of all this,\u201d said Akere Muna, an opposition politician and former presidential candidate who is participating in the talks. \u201cNow the federalists are a minority and the separatists are the majority.\u201d", "description": "Government-led talks to end a two-year-old separatist insurgency in Cameroon faltered before they began on Monday as separatists and opposition politicians boycotted the event.", "authors": ["Josiane Kouagheu", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
