But overseas investors cannot get far enough away from Japanese stocks. That is worth watching because they tend to sell at exactly the wrong time.\n\nInternational investors are the most-active players in the Japanese markets, where local institutions tend to buy and hold. Those foreign players have now sold essentially all the equities that they bought in the sunny moments of optimism that followed the election of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in 2012.\n\nAbe has made reasonable albeit slow progress in pushing his agenda of change on a hidebound economy. He is set in November to become the longest-running prime minister that the country has ever seen. But international investors have not been hanging around to see if he will succeed.\n\nAt the height of the excitement surrounding Abenomics, nonresident investors had made cumulative net purchases of \u00a520 trillion (US$188 billion) in Japanese equities. The buying started in 2012 but peaked in 2015. It was actually a shock in the Chinese equity markets in August 2015 that started the selling in Japanese stocks. There was short-lived interest in 2017 again only for that to give way, too.\n\nAll of that buying has been undone in 2019, \"and there is probably still scope for further selling,\" the Japan quant team at Nomura note. Since the launch of Abenomics, foreign investors are now net sellers to the tune of \u00a53.5 trillion (US$33 billion).\n\nThere are two main drivers. First, active Japan-focused funds saw heavy inflows during the wave of interest that swept Japanese equities post-2012. The amount of assets in Japan-focused funds stood at \u00a52.1 trillion (US$20 billion) when Abe got elected, and swelled to \u00a59.8 trillion (US$92 billion) in 2015. They've now experienced outflows both as impatient investors shifted out of Japanese stocks, and as those investors that remained switched from active to passive, index-tracking funds.\n\nThe total amount in overseas Japan equity funds has now emptied out to \u00a54.7 trillion (US$44 billion). The reduction in active Japan-fund AUM accounts for around 40% of the selling. Active managers accounted for 65% of Japan-focused assets at the peak in interest, but the balance between active and passive funds now is roughly 50% active to 50% passive.\n\nThe second driver is that long-term investors have lost interest. Any momentum they generated as Abe took power, promising to end two decades of deflation, has dissipated, and disappeared.\n\nIn fact, interest in Japanese equities is at an all-time low, according to the August edition of the World Economic Survey or WES, put out by the German research house Ifo Institute. That contrasts with the post-Abe glow, when Japan was the hottest market in the world in terms of sentiment.\n\nAlthough the current economic-climate indicator has only slightly worsened in Japan, \"respondents turned very pessimistic regarding the months to come,\" the Ifo Institute notes. Japan experienced the sharpest drop in expectations about future performance. \"This is the most pessimistic that Japanese experts have been in the history of the WES.\"\n\nMaximum pessimism may be a sign that the tide is about to turn. If you had increased exposure to the countries that stand out for their optimism in Ifo's WES survey, you'll have consistently lost money, the Japan quants calculate. Selling at the time of peak pessimism would also have lost you cash. The survey results tend to lag actual economic performance.\n\nWhy the pessimism? Japan is the third wheel in the U.S.-China trade dispute. U.S. President Donald Trump finds Japan a convenient foil if he wants to criticize someone other than China on trade. But businesses in Japan and China are intricately interwoven in their operations as well, and the global slowdown in trade hits export-dependent Japan hard, too.\n\nMost recently, Japan has embroiled itself in a trade war of its own with South Korea. Last but not least, Japan is planning an increase in its sales tax in October, which in the past has put a significant dent in the economy in the next year.\n\n\"There can be little doubt that Japanese equities are unpopular,\" Akihiro Murakami and Tomoyo Izumi conclude in their Japan quant-strategy report for Nomura. However, the stocks that nonresident investors sell in Japan have historically performed very well. \"While nonresident investors' scope to sell will not simply disappear, any stocks they sell are likely to receive strong support.\"\n\nJapanese shares have tended to outperform after nonresident investors sell. This is partly because the Bank of Japan starts purchasing those Japanese equities to fill that void. And it's also often the case that foreign investors are selling at the bottom of the market.\n\nThere are seven particularly large-cap stocks, with market caps of more than \u00a51 trillion, out of a universe of 39 Japanese equities that have seen the heaviest selling by foreign investors.\n\nThese all have ADRs, meaning they're easily acquired in the United States. These Japanese blue chips would be worth watching to see if the selling by international investors is indeed mistimed at the bottom of the market.\n\nInvestors might therefore want to watch: makeup maker Shiseido (SSDOY) ; the operator of 7-11 convenience stores in Japan Seven & i Holdings (SVNDY) ; the tire company Bridgestone (BRDCY) ; the furniture manufacturer Nitori Holdings (NCLTF) ; the drinks company Suntory Beverage & Food (STBFY) ; the property developer Sekisui House (SKHSY) ; and the advertising company Dentsu (DNTUY) .\n\nAlternatively, investors could monitor Japanese index funds for overall market moves. The billion-dollar monsters there in terms of size are the iShares MSCI Japan ETF (EWJ) ; the J.P. Morgan BetaBuilders Japan ETF (BBJP) ; and the WisdomTree Japan Hedged Equity Fund (DXJ) , which removes any guesswork over the FX fluctuations between Japan and the U.S. dollar by hedging the yen.\n\nIt's likely not the time to buy right now. But the mood is darkest on Japan stocks than it's ever been, so contrarians might want to ready their positions.", "description": "All the equities purchased by international investors at the onset of Abenomics have now been sold.
