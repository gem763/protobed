[...] It would be very difficult for the competition to bridge that moat - I\u2019m not saying it won\u2019t happen... but it needs to be regulated as if it won\u2019t.\u201d\n\nSomes further suggested that there should be a legislative framework allowing the ACCC to intervene.\n\nIn addition to being ASX\u2019s sole competitor, Chi-X Australia is also its only client, relying entirely on ASX for clearing services, according to Reuters.\n\nBlockchain tech gains traction for stock trading infrastructure\n\nStock exchanges globally have been applying blockchain technology to various parts of their business activities for the past few years. ASX, for its part, first announced plans to replace CHESS with a blockchain-based platform in 2017.\n\nIn July of last year, the Shanghai Stock Exchange \u2014 the world\u2019s fourth-largest stock exchange \u2014 released plans to use distributed ledger technology in securities transactions.\n\nIn May 2019, CEO of the London Stock Exchange Nikhil Rathi said that blockchain technology could have widespread application in issuing securities and settlement.\n\nIn a maximalist take on blockchain\u2019s application in securities trading, Thomas Zeeb of Swiss leading stock exchange SIX said last year that digital exchanges based on blockchain tech will eventually replace traditional ones.\n\nAdditional reporting by Adrian Zmudzinski", "description": "An Australian stock exchange is concerned that the blockchain-based system of its sole competitor could pose an unfair advantage", "authors": ["Aaron Wood"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy9mOWI2YmViZDk1OGYzZmI0Y2RkOGQwZWE4YzUwODMwMi5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
