They have been fighting Turkey for decades. I held off this fight for \u2026 almost 3 years, but it is time for us to get out of these ridiculous Endless Wars, many of them tribal, and bring our soldiers home,\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\n\u201cWE WILL FIGHT WHERE IT IS TO OUR BENEFIT, AND ONLY FIGHT TO WIN,\u201d the president added.\n\nThe United States was supposed to be in Syria for 30 days, that was many years ago. We stayed and got deeper and deeper into battle with no aim in sight. When I arrived in Washington, ISIS was running rampant in the area. We quickly defeated 100% of the ISIS Caliphate,..... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 7, 2019\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTrump\u2019s remarks came hours after the White House announced late Sunday that Turkey would be moving forward with a long-threatened offensive in northern Syria and that U.S. troops would not be in the \u201cimmediate area\u201d when it happens.\n\nTrump spoke with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan about the matter earlier Sunday, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham Stephanie GrishamWhite House says Turkey will soon launch Syria operation White House dismisses news of second whistleblower: Trump 'has done nothing wrong' Intel Dem: No reason for White House to defy subpoena unless Trump is 'guilty' MORE said.\n\n\u201cTurkey will soon be moving forward with its long-planned operation into Northern Syria. The United States Armed Forces will not support or be involved in the operation, and United States forces, having defeated the ISIS territorial \u2018Caliphate,\u2019 will no longer be in the immediate area,\u201d Grisham said.\n\nThe U.S. began pulling back troops from the Turkish-Syrian border early Monday, according to multiple reports.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision marked a reversal and was viewed as an endorsement of Turkey\u2019s plans for the offensive.\n\nThe U.S. has worked closely with Kurdish fighters in Syria in the battle against ISIS, or the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which are led by the Kurds, reportedly denounced Trump's decision as a \u201cstab in the back\u201d and have warned it could erode gains made against ISIS in the region.\n\nTurkey, which views the Kurdish forces as a terrorist insurgency, has long been frustrated with the U.S. alliance with the group. The U.S. has been working on establishing a safe zone along the border in order to reduce tensions, but the plans have thus far been unsuccessful and Turkey has threatened a military operation near the border.\n\nTrump's decision drew immediate criticism, including from one of his closest allies, Sen. Lindsey Graham Lindsey Olin GrahamGraham vows to publicly question whistleblowers if Trump is impeached Key Republicans split with Trump on Biden investigation push GOP searches for impeachment boogeyman MORE (R-S.C.).\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know all the details regarding President Trump\u2019s decision in northern Syria. In process of setting up phone call with Secretary [of State Mike] Pompeo. If press reports are accurate this is a disaster in the making,\u201d Graham tweeted Monday.\n\nTrump, who campaigned on bringing U.S. troops home, has sought to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria. He called for a complete withdrawal last December, but ultimately reversed course amid protest from the Pentagon.\n\nTrump on Monday also repeated his claim that the U.S. has defeated 100 percent of the ISIS caliphate, which has been challenged in the past.\n\n\u201cTurkey, Europe, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Russia and the Kurds will now have to \u2026 figure the situation out, and what they want to do with the captured ISIS fighters in their \u2018neighborhood.\u2019 They all hate ISIS, have been enemies for years. We are 7000 miles away and will crush ISIS again if they come anywhere near us!\u201d Trump tweeted.", "description": "President Trump on Monday said it is time to remove the United States from \u201cridiculous Endless Wars\" after he decided to pull back American troops from northern Syria amid an impending Turkish military operation there.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald_091619getty_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
