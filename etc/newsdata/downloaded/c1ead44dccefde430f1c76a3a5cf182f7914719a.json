The offering, from Warner Bros. and Pottermore, is a premium addition to the Wizarding World app that launched in August. It\u2019s called Wizarding World Gold.\n\nFrom a quick glance at Wizarding World Gold\u2019s offerings, it\u2019s likely that Warner Bros. and Pottermore, author J.K. Rowling\u2019s company, want to mirror the success companies like Disney have found with their own membership programs. Disney\u2019s D23 membership, which gives people discounted access to the company\u2019s parks and access to exclusive events, is a big part of Disney\u2019s relationship with its fans. The annual subscription even spawned an entire three-day biennial convention that attracts the same Hollywood star power San Diego Comic-Con boasts, but it\u2019s exclusive to D23 Gold members.\n\nDisney and Harry Potter seemingly have one major overlap when it comes to their fans: dedication. Much like how Disney can use its membership to bolster additional attention and excitement for many of its divisions (theme parks, studio movie releases, its new Disney+ streaming service), Rowling and Pottermore can use the subscription package to drive traffic toward theme park attendance and stage plays.\n\nDisney and \u2018Harry Potter\u2019 seemingly have one major overlap when it comes to their fans: dedication\n\nJust take a look at some of the key discounts for Harry Potter fans. Being a Gold member provides people with discounts at \u201cWizarding World.com shop, Platform 9\u00be store in London\u2019s King\u2019s Cross Station, and Warner Bros. Studio Tour stores in both London and Hollywood,\u201d plus a Harry Potter vacation package at Universal Orlando Resort in Florida.\n\nStill, $75 is on the expensive side of annual subscriptions \u2014 especially for people who might not be interested in the IRL aspects of Harry Potter fandom. The subscription also comes with a couple of new video series based around interviews with craftspeople and curated behind-the-scenes content.\n\nWarner Bros. and Pottermore are including a personalized interactive journal with each subscription, too, leaning hard into the swag factor. Swag, of course, being an important facet of fan culture. The journal, seen below, comes embroidered with members\u2019 names, signage of the Hogwarts house they were sorted into, and additional passages that are personalized for each person. There are \u201cenchanted keys\u201d spread throughout the pages that people \u201ccan scan with [their] Wizarding World app to unlock hidden secrets,\u201d according to a press release. The journal\u2019s keys will be updated every month to offer new artwork, and activity prompts for people to scribble down.\n\nWizarding World Gold memberships are available to preorder now. Each order comes with an exclusive collectible pin. Gift subscriptions will also be made available in the months to come.", "description": "Harry Potter fans can get a new video series, discounted merchandise, special events, and all seven books in the main series as part of a new $74.99 subscription plan.
