I recover a little longer now. I still feel when I\u2019m warmed up and going, I feel better than ever. But when I\u2019m cooled down and at home, I\u2019m like damn alright, going to take a little bit more time to recover. So that\u2019s the only difference between now and my 20\u2019s, but I don\u2019t want to push it so long that I regret it.\u201d\n\nHaving competed at 145 pounds for the majority of his career, Swanson (25-11 MMA, 10-7 UFC) admits that he thought about moving up to lightweight before, as he enters the latter years of his career.\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve definitely thought about it, and I always told myself I probably would as I got older,\u201d Swanson said. \u201cBut I sometimes I go with one of my teammates, Rafa Garcia. He\u2019s an up-and-comer, one of the strongest humans I ever met, and when I roll with him, I\u2019m like man I can\u2019t be fighting 55\u2019s. I\u2019d have to put on some size, but yeah I could do it, though.\u201d\n\nSwanson will look to snap a four-fight losing skid when he takes on Kron Gracie Saturday at UFC on ESPN+ 19.\n\nAnd for someone who\u2019s been willing to compete against anyone throughout his career, Swanson just wants to represent himself in the best way possible. A veteran of the fight game, he\u2019s done a good job of keeping his name out of the headlines, and he plans on keeping it that way.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of my biggest things. I don\u2019t want to lose control of myself,\u201d Swanson said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be on TMZ Sports. I don\u2019t want to be the headlines of being an idiot, because I know a lot of people look up to me in my hometown, and I don\u2019t want to let them down.\u201d\n\nTo hear more from Swanson, watch the video above.", "description": "Cub Swanson doesn't plan on quitting anytime soon.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "Nolan King", "Mike Bohn", "Simon Head", "Mma Junkie Staff"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/cub-swanson-ufc-tampa-media-day-interview.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
