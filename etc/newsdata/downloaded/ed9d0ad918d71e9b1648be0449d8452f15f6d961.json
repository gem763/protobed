Grays is about 20 miles east of London.\n\nAll 39 people found were pronounced dead at the scene. Eight of the dead are women, including a young woman police initially said was a teenager, and 31 are men, police said.\n\nEssex Police said 25-year-old truck driver Mo Robinson from Portadown, Northern Ireland, was arrested after the bodies were found and is still being held by police.\n\nBritish police have raided three properties in Northern Ireland amid the investigation.\n\nThe truck and the trailer with the people inside apparently took separate circuitous journeys before ending up at the industrial park.\n\nDetectives said the trailer containing the victims arrived at the port of Purfleet from Zeebrugge, Belgium, around 12:30 a.m. local time Wednesday. The front section to which it was attached entered the country via Holyhead, Wales, on Sunday from Dublin and is believed to be from Northern Ireland.\n\nBoth the cab and trailer left Purfleet shortly after 1:05 a.m. Wednesday, and police were called less than an hour later after the bodies were discovered at the industrial park.\n\nPolice originally said they believed the truck's trailer may be from Bulgaria. The country's foreign ministry confirmed the truck was registered in Bulgaria under a company owned by an Irish citizen.\n\nGlobal Trailer Rentals Ltd. confirmed Thursday that it owns the refrigerated trailer, Ireland's RTE reported, citing a company spokesperson.\n\nThe trailer was leased Oct. 15 from the company's Monaghan location for roughly $300 a week until its return. The company's trailers have GPS trackers, and it said it would share that information with police.\n\nThe company also said in a statement that it was \"entirely unaware that the trailer was to be used in the manner in which it appears to have been\" and that its staff is \"shellshocked\" and \"gutted,\" RTE reported.\n\nIn Belgium, authorities say they have made little progress in tracking the truck's route.\n\nProsecution spokesman Eric Van Duyse said Thursday that \"up till now, we have a lot of questions and not a lot of answers. We don't even know which road was followed by the truck in Belgium.\"\n\nVan Duyse said authorities also do not know how long the truck was in the country, whether it stopped and whether people entered the container there.\n\nIrish authorities have said they are also cooperating with the investigation and probing the registrations and movements of the container and truck.\n\nRobinson has not yet been charged with any offense, and Essex Police, who typically have 48 hours to question a suspect arrested on suspicion of murder, were granted an extension to keep him in custody for an additional day.\n\n\"This is an incredibly sensitive and high-profile investigation, and we are working swiftly to gather as full a picture as possible as to how these people lost their lives,\" said Deputy Chief Constable Pippa Mills.\n\n\"Our recovery of the bodies is ongoing and the postmortem and identification processes, which will be lengthy and complex, can then begin.\"\n\nSOURCE maps4news.com/\u00a9HERE More\n\nThe man's parents have flown to England to support their son following his arrest. Paul Berry, a local politician in the county of Armagh who said he's spoken with the Robinson family, said the village of Laurelvale where Robinson's parents live was in \"complete shock.\"\n\n\"The local community is hoping that (Robinson) has been caught up innocently in this matter but that's in the hands of Essex Police, and we will leave it in their professional hands to try to catch the perpetrators of this,\" Berry said.", "description": "Essex Police said 25-year-old Mo Robinson from Portadown, Northern Ireland, was\u00a0arrested after the bodies were found and is still being held.", "authors": ["Ellis Whitehouse", "Ryan Jennings", "Basildon", "England"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/RIyjcNyThXQAgyGC8tqAWw--~B/aD0xNzA0O3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/43629d607cf1244ce3ea30c30d9fe1ac", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
