This is in addition to a recently filed civil suit alleging he sexually assaulted his trainer, Britney Taylor. He was traded this past offseason from the Pittsburgh Steelers for being a malcontent and cut by the Oakland Raiders after a physical altercation with General Manager Mike Mayock.\n\nThe expression in the NFL is \u201cyou never quit on talent.\u201d Diamond thinks that Brown\u2019s obvious physical abilities will lead some team to eventually sign the four-time All-Pro.\n\n\u201cHistory tells you that he probably will get another opportunity at some point and I certainly don\u2019t buy his statement that he\u2019s done with the NFL. I think it is more like the NFL is done with him \u2013 temporarily. We\u2019ll see what shakes out,\u201d Diamond told FOX Business.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the really the reality of the situation. I think that obviously we\u2019ll see how it shakes out, but to me, right now, he needs to get his act together and Drew Rosenhaus, as his agent, better have a heart-to-heart with him \u2026 It\u2019s a disaster on so many levels.\u201d\n\nDiamond is convinced that if the legal matters involving Brown are cleared up, then the wide receiver will be in the NFL sooner rather than later. Not as soon as this season, but still in the near future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrown, coincidentally, re-enrolled at Central Michigan University.\n\nThis idea of a return to the NFL at some point comes against the prevailing mentality that Brown might be out of the league permanently, following not just the ongoing legal matter but also a string of what looks to be irrational behavior. The NFL has kept out players like Ray Rice in the past over domestic issues, freezing out the star running back from ever playing again.\n\nDiamond doesn\u2019t think that will be the case with Brown, a generational wide receiver talent.\n\n\u201cWell I think it depends as to what happens with the allegations of sexual assault -- if nothing comes of it, it\u2019s all just dismissed over time, then that obviously will help his cause. You still got this whole thing with how his behavior was in Oakland and that whole thing and Pittsburgh too. There\u2019s two problems you\u2019ve got to overcome: How he left Pittsburgh, how he left Oakland. There\u2019s a third, of course, with the sexual assault allegations. Those are three major things to overcome,\u201d Diamond said.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s done for the year. I think he\u2019s going to try to claim the Raiders [who] owe him some guaranteed money and the Patriots with the signing bonus. He\u2019ll stake his claim for this year but I expect him to land somewhere in 2020. I think he\u2019ll try to end this and all that, if, and that\u2019s a big one, if the sexual assault claims are not substantiated, then I expect him to be back somewhere in 2020.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Antonio Brown is facing several legal obstacles to get back on the field but if he does, one former NFL general manager thinks he will be playing in the NFL sooner rather than later.", "authors": ["Kristian Dyer"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/Antonio-Brown-2.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
