Originally asking $114 million, the townhouse at 12 E. 69th St. is now for sale for $88 million.\n\nThe listing agent, Paula DelNunzio of Brown Harris Stevens, said the mansion is the only 40-foot-wide house with a 20,000-square-foot interior that has been on the market in a totally renovated condition. Other similarly wide houses for sale in Manhattan have needed extensive renovations, she said.\n\n\"The scale of the interior rooms is beyond belief and without compare, as there are four of the most remarkable rooms ever seen in a New York mansion,\" DelNunzio told Business Insider.\n\nThe dining room was inspired by Versailles, according to Curbed.\n\nIt's been on and off the market since December 2013, when it was originally listed for $114 million. The next year, it was discounted to $98 million.\n\nIn 2017, a buyer was in contract to buy the home for $80 million, The Real Deal reported. But the deal fell through, so the house went up for rent for $175,000 a month before being relisted for $88 million.\n\nHere's what the $88 million house looks like inside.", "description": "The townhouse in New York's Upper East Side, steps from Central Park, was originally listed for $114 million in 2013.
