REUTERS/Andres Martinez Casares\n\nPORT-AU-PRINCE (Reuters) - The killing of a journalist who had closely covered Haiti\u2019s political and economic crisis fueled the anger of protesters on Friday, as they clashed with police and pressed calls for the president of the impoverished nation to resign.\n\nNehemie Joseph was found dead in his car with several gunshot wounds to the head late on Thursday, according to his media outlet Radio Mega.\n\nViolent crime is rife in Haiti, and the circumstances behind Joseph\u2019s killing were not immediately known.\n\nHe had complained publicly last month of threats from politicians close to the government over his work, but Haiti\u2019s police had no immediate comment on the killing. A government spokesman lamented the death on Twitter but offered no further comment.\n\nThe country\u2019s online media association said Joseph was the third journalist to have been killed or \u201cdisappeared\u201d since Moise became president 2-1/2 years ago.\n\n\u201cThe surge in attacks on the media is very worrying,\u201d said international rights group Reporters Without Borders, calling on authorities to step up protection for journalists.\n\nOpposition-led protests over fuel shortages, galloping inflation and allegations of corruption by public officials have rocked Haiti for the past four weeks.\n\nAt least 17 people have been killed and 189 injured during the anti-government demonstrations, according to Haiti\u2019s National Network for the Defense of Human Rights, and schools and businesses have had to close.\n\nThe toll appeared to have risen on Friday as local media and the opposition reported the death of a 16-year-old in clashes with police in the town of Saint-Marc, just north of Port-au-Prince. Details were not immediately available.\n\nIn the capital, police firing teargas, rubber bullets and live shots in the air dispersed thousands of protesters who had gathered in one of Port-au-Prince\u2019s main squares. Some protesters fought back by throwing bottles and debris.\n\nThe protesters had unsuccessfully attempted to march on the home of President Jovenel Moise, who has been implicated in allegations of corruption and embezzlement of public funds.\n\nThe embattled leader has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nSome of the protesters burned tires in the streets while others chanted \u201cOut with Jovenel\u201d in creole. Sound trucks blasted music with anti-government lyrics.\n\nSlideshow (15 Images)\n\n\u201cWe are in misery and we are starving,\u201d said one protester, Claude Jean. \u201cWe cannot stand it anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe ask (Moise) to resign so that we have a new Haiti ... because we suffer too much in this country.\u201d\n\nMoise this week announced the formation of a commission to find a way of lifting the poorest country in the Americas out of its current crisis, but government critics said it was too late for dialogue and he must resign.", "description": "The killing of a journalist who had closely covered Haiti's political and economic crisis fueled the anger of protesters on Friday, as they clashed with police and pressed calls for the president of the impoverished nation to resign.", "authors": ["Andre Paultre", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191012&t=2&i=1439893726&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9B005", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
