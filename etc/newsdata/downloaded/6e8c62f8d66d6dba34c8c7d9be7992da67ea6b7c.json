As Modern Health care recently reported, many hospitals and insurers believe President Trump\u2019s proposal to make hospitals post prices for medical services would be bad for business and patients. But it is isn\u2019t just economists and other experts view price transparency as a worthwhile experiment, but patients themselves.\n\nAcross America, patients are clamoring for greater transparency and choice and are increasingly frustrated with risings costs and the opacity of the current system.\n\nFor instance, as CBS recently reported, James Schlieper of Central Texas drove five hours to the Surgery Center of Oklahoma and saved $27,000 off of a hernia procedure his hospitals back home said would cost $30,000. Schlieper asked: \u201cWhy can't we just know what it costs? ...Transparency would be great.\u201d\n\nThis example and others like it are not one-off anecdotes but are part of a pattern hospitals and insurers ignore at their peril. Unnecessary and anti-competitive secrecy\n\namong hospitals and insurers is a serious structural problem in our health care system that deserves urgent attention. Recent research suggests that when patients do have access to prices and can shop, costs go down.\n\nEconomist Larry Van Horn estimates that cash prices average nearly 40 percent below negotiated rates. When the state California adopted a reference pricing model for state employees, they saw a 17 to 21 percent reduction in prices with transparency creating a positive \u201cspillover effect\u201d for other patients.\n\nLikewise, businesses who embrace price and quality transparent providers have demonstrated impressive savings. Employers like H.B. Global of Pennsylvania and Employee Solutions of Texas have reduced health care costs nearly 50 percent for their employees and companies.\n\nAgain, this evidence describes a pattern that runs deeper than isolated bad customer experiences with insurer companies or hospitals. When the Rand Corporation took a broad look at our health care system, they discovered that Medicare rates average nearly 60 percent below negotiated rates that insurers pay for hospital services in employer plans.\n\nThe evolution of the airline industry offers helpful lessons. After President Carter deregulated the opaque airline industry in 1978, price transparency resulted in 50 percent reduction in fares, more competition among new entrants, and ultimately broader access with hundreds of millions of more people flying. At the same time, safety and quality improved across the industry. The invisible hand of the market can do the same for health care as price discovery ushers in broader competition and access and higher quality.\n\nPatients want health care to work like trusted, functional, competitive markets such as travel, grocery, and retail. Without up-front price discovery of both care and coverage, patients put off going to the doctor or hospital in fear of unknown, potential financial ruin.\n\nThis issue is gaining momentum not just among policymakers but the general public. Comedian Bill Maher recently satirized the massive price discrepancies around knee replacements, for instance. During an episode of his HBO show Real Time, Maher described how the cost of a knee replacement can vary from $17,000 to $61,000 in the same city. When Donald Trump and Bill Maher on the same page on a public policy question, hospitals and insurance companies may want to rethink their position. To average Americans, the reflexive opposition to price transparency among hospitals and insurers begs the question: What are they trying to hide?\n\nIn every other area of our economy price discovery is not merely a worthy experiment. It is a way of life. It\u2019s time to let America\u2019s patients see the same level of transparency in health care.\n\nCynthia A.
