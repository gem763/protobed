But the higher tax rate will still hit an economy suffering from slowing global demand and bitter trade tensions.\n\nThe government and central bank policymakers expect the effect from the two-percentage-point tax hike to be much smaller than that of the previous increase.\n\nTo ease the pain on low-income households, some food and non-alcoholic beverages will be exempt from the higher tax rate.\n\nThe government has also set aside two trillion yen ($18.49bn) for discounts and shopping vouchers as well as public works spending. Another 300 billion yen ($2.77bn) will be spent on tax breaks for housing and car purchases.\n\nBut that may not be enough to boost consumption.\n\n\"The reduced tax rate and reward points system may limit the pain to shoppers,\" said Koya Miyamae, a senior economist at SMBC Nikko Securities. \"Still, consumer sentiment tends to deteriorate before and after a tax hike, which will, in turn, dampen economic activity.\"\n\nIf the pain proves bigger than expected, the government has said it was ready to deploy additional measures.\n\n\"I'll take the initiative to check the economic situation closely and take additional economic measures flexibly, if necessary,\" Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said on Monday.", "description": "The tax increase risks further deteriorating consumer spending and tipping Japan's economy into a recession.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/1/ebc6eeb524514990b7e3f9245fed0583_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
