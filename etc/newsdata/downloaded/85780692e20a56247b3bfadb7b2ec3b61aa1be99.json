Instead, NGC 2371/2 was created when a star, similar to our Sun, reached the end of its life and \"blasted off its outer layers, shedding the constituent material and pushing it out into space to leave just a superheated stellar remnant behind.\" What's left behind is visible as the bright star in the center between the lobes,\" NASA added in the post.\n\nIt's expected that there will be a significant change to the region over the next few thousand years, as the lobes eventually dissipate completely, \"and the remnant star will cool and dim to form a white dwarf.\"\n\nThe Hubble Space Telescope, which has been in orbit since 1990, continues to allow incredible discoveries. However, it is slated to be replaced by the long-delayed James Webb telescope, which will provide great resolution and sensitivity over the Hubble, among several other improvements.\n\nLast month, the telescope was assembled for the first time, as engineers joined the two halves together using a crane in Redondo Beach, Calif.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "description": "NASA's Hubble Space Telescope managed to snap an incredible picture of a dying star in the Gemini constellation.", "authors": ["Chris Ciaccia"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/nasa-dying-star.jpg"}
