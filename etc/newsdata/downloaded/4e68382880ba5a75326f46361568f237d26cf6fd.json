While the date was set for mid-December, Sullivan said it was still tentative and meant to be a goalpost to measure progress in the case.\n\nThe case has stalled as Flynn\u2019s defense team attempted to obtain classified government documents. Flynn\u2019s attorney, Sidney Powell, on Tuesday accused the government of \u201cegregious\u201d violations of federal law and government misconduct, claiming they are withholding documents that could be useful to Flynn\u2019s defense.\n\nPowell, a vocal critic of the Mueller report, argued that the documents would \u201cexonerate\u201d Flynn. Sullivan reminded Powell that Flynn has twice pleaded guilty.\n\nSullivan, who in the past has shown frustration with Flynn, was nonchalant with the legal teams in his courtroom on Tuesday. As Powell made her claims of government misconduct, Sullivan sat back in his chair, with his glasses off, patiently listening.\n\n\u201cThere is far more at stake here than sentencing,\u201d Powell said. Powell argued that had the government \u201cdone everything the right way, they never would have brought this case in the first place.\u201d\n\nVan Grack argued that Flynn, and his original lawyers were made aware of certain documents and, despite not seeing them, proceeded with his plea deal. Other information Powell was after, he said, had no relevance in the case.\n\nFlynn pleaded guilty in December 2017 to a charge of lying to federal investigators about his discussions with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak during the presidential transition. As a part of that deal, he cooperated with Mueller\u2019s probe.\n\nThe special counsel\u2019s report suggested Flynn provided extensive information about the Trump campaign and its inner workings. For example, prosecutors wrote in the newly unsealed documents that Flynn \u201crecalled conversations with senior campaign officials after the release of the then-Hillary Clinton presidential campaign manager John Podesta's emails, during which the prospect of reaching out to WikiLeaks was discussed.\u201d\n\nProsecutors said in the newly released documents that Flynn \u201cprovided a voicemail recording\u201d related to \u201ccommunications from persons connected to the administration or Congress that could have affected both his willingness to cooperate and the completeness of that cooperation.\u201d\n\nAndrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nPresident Trump in June tweeted \"Best Wishes\" to Flynn after he hired Powell to take over his defense.", "description": "President Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, is now set to be sentenced in December.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/michael-flynn-ap-jef-190910_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
