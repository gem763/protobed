She\u2019s just an incredible badass survivor.\n\n\u2018While her decisions may look awful to someone else, she is not going to at any point do anything that would get in the way of protecting her daughter.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMorton also revealed that she prepared for the intense role by watching documentaries on cults \u2013 and you can count The Whisperers\u2019 anti-civilisation outlook fitting right into the category.\n\nApocalyptic Alpha (Picture: AMC)\n\n\u2018Technology was messing everything up, so Alpha wants to live in the woods and take ayahuasca and be feral, in a way,\u2019 Morton reasoned. \u2018That\u2019s nature.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s better than the way human beings have been living, whether it\u2019s globalisation or capitalism. She\u2019s like a f***ed-up eco warrior.\n\n\u2018She thinks that at the end of the day, everyone has wars. She just wants to live \u2014 weirdly, peacefully, as a Whisperer. You have to remember that: she didn\u2019t start this trouble. She\u2019s just\u2026 finishing it.\u2019\n\nMorton also hinted that Alpha isn\u2019t going anywhere soon, revealing that she\u2019d still been shooting for season 10 over the past week.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m still shooting. I had a tough day yesterday, I have to tell you. It was a tough day in a good way. I\u2019m still in it. I\u2019m still shooting it.\n\n\u2018You have to be the best you\u2019ve ever been every day, because you can\u2019t not be,\u2019 she added of the pressures of playing a Walking Dead villain.\n\nThe Walking Dead season 10 continues Sunday in the US, with episodes releasing Mondays on Fox in the UK.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
