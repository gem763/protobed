'If they were energized, they could've ignited.'\n\nBecause of the dangerous weather in the forecast, PG&E cut power Wednesday to an estimated two million people in an area.\n\nAmid the chaos, a man says his 89-year-old mother has been missing since Thursday night after the wind-driven wildfire swept through a Southern California mobile home park, destroying dozens of residences.\n\nLois Arvickson called her son, Don Turner, from her cellphone to say she was evacuating shortly after the blaze was reported in the Calimesa area.\n\n'She said she's getting her purse and she's getting out, and the line went dead,' he said.\n\nArvickson's neighbors saw in her garage as flames approached, according to Turner. A short time later the neighbors saw the garage on fire, but they don't know if she'd managed to escape, he said.\n\nRiverside County fire officials said they're still trying to determine if anybody is unaccounted for after 74 structures were decimated.\n\nPreviously authorities said they responded to 'numerous' medical emergencies at the park. Several residents were transported to hospitals but there were no details on their conditions, county fire Capt Fernando Herrera said.\n\nTurner said he's been checking hospitals.\n\nThe 2018 wildfire season was the deadliest and most destructive ever recorded in California, with about 100 residents and firefighters killed.\n\nMore than 8,500 fires erupted, scorching more than 1.8 million acres and causing billions of dollars of damage.", "description": "The shocking videos show residents driving along the freeway as the massive flames rise up on both sides of them in Saddleridge, Sylmar near Los Angeles.", "authors": ["Mary Kekatos For Dailymail.Com", "Amelia Wynne For Mailonline", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/14/19588808-0-image-a-20_1570798870434.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
