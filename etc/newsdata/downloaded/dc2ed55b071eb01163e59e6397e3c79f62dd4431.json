I\u2018m extremely disappointed that I\u2019ve let my team down.\n\n\"I will continue to work with the Player's Union (NBPA) to go through the arbitration process and am hopeful for a positive resolution.\"\n\nAyton's suspension begins Friday's when the Suns take on the Denver Nuggets.\n\nThe NBPA is reportedly planning to file for arbitration of Ayton's suspension. The players' association believes Ayton's suspension is eligible to be reduced because of an \"unintentional ingestion\" provision, league sources told ESPN. The NBPA could not be immediately reached to confirm the report.\n\nSuns general manager James Jones said in a statement the team was \"disappointed\" with Ayton.\n\n\"This does not uphold the standards and principles we have set for the team,\" Jones said. \"... Deandre has expressed his deepest remorse. While he is suspended we remain committed to his growth and development on and off the court. His actions are not taken lightly, and we are committed to ensuring that Deandre understands the profound impact it has had on the team, organization, and Suns community.\"\n\nThe No. 1 overall pick in the 2018 NBA draft out of Arizona, Ayton had 18 points with 11 rebounds in Wednesday night's win over the Kings at Talking Stick Resort Arena.\n\nAs a rookie, Ayton averaged 16.2 points with 10.3 rebounds and posted a Suns rookie-record 39 double-doubles in 71 games.\n\nAyton looked to have a major sophomore season. Instead, the Suns will be playing without their starting center against quality teams, and facing elite big men in Joel Embiid (Sixers) Karl-Anthony Towns (Timberwolves), Anthony Davis (Lakers), Nikola Jokic (Nuggets) and Rudy Gobert (Jazz).\n\nHow Phoenix plays without Ayton may be an even greater challenge.\n\nThe Suns could start Aron Baynes at center, but could also go with Frank Kaminsky III. Baynes is the more physical of the two, but Kaminsky is a bigger threat offensively.\n\nThe Suns are capable of scoring points without Ayton and may play their share of small ball, but they'll miss his rebounding and presence in the paint. Ayton blocked four shots in Wednesday's win.\n\nContributing: Jeff Zillgitt.", "description": "The league informed the Suns that Ayton, the top pick in the 2018 draft, tested positive for a diuretic.
