Its plant in Ingersoll, Ont. remains open, but that can\u2019t last if the strike continues.\n\n\u201cWith inventories starting to dwindle, production will be forced to stop over the coming weeks,\u201d TD Economics reported.\n\nSince Oshawa, one of the plants slated for closure, was already preparing to stop vehicle production in December, a prolonged strike could speed up the timing.\n\n\u201cIt is assumed that any production lost at this facility \u2013 roughly one-third of fourth-quarter GM production \u2013 would not be recouped,\u201d the TD Economics report stated.\n\nOverall Canadian auto production is down about six per cent year to date and vehicle sales fell about 3.8 per cent in the first nine months, according to the report, which expects total vehicle sales to hover around two million through 2020.\n\nCapital expenditures in the automotive manufacturing sector are also expected to fall in 2019, according to a new report from DesRosiers Automotive Consultants.\n\nTotal capital spending is expected to fall to $2.12 billion from $2.87 billion in 2018 and from the pre-recession peak of $4.17 billion in 2007, according to DesRosiers. New spending will drop to $1.26 billion for motor vehicle assembly, $782.7 million for motor vehicle parts and accessories and $76.3 million for the truck body and trailer industry.\n\nEarlier this month, DesRosiers also reported a drop in light vehicle sales. After a bit of hope for a rebound in August, September sales fell 3.7 per cent, with GM posting the largest decrease in volume.\n\nGM is losing between US$80 million and US$100 million each day of the strike, according to analyst estimates from J.P Morgan and Citi, while workers must get by on US$250 per week from the union.", "description": "Output down about six per cent year to date, vehicle sales off about 3.8 per cent and capex expected to fall", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/magna.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
