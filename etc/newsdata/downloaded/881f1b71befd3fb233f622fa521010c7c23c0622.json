REUTERS/Lindsey Wasson\n\nSpeaking on the sidelines of an event at a New York City college, Christopher Hart, chair of the multi-agency panel, said there was no need to question the agency\u2019s overall way of certifying airplanes.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. aviation system each day transports millions of people safely, so it\u2019s not like we have to completely overhaul the entire system, it\u2019s not broken. But these incidents have shown us that there are ways to improve the existing system,\u201d Hart said, referring to fatal crashes of a Lion Air 737 MAX in Indonesia and an Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX five months apart that killed a total of 346 people.\n\nThe MAX remains grounded and Boeing has not set when it will conduct a key certification test flight. Some in Congress and in aviation have criticized the FAA\u2019s longstanding practice of delegating certification tasks to manufacturers.\n\nMichael Perrone, who heads the Professional Aviation Safety Specialists union, said at a House hearing in July that external entities designated by the FAA \u201care now performing more than 90 percent of FAA\u2019s certification activities despite serious concerns that oversight is lacking.\u201d\n\nHart, former chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and a licensed pilot, heads the Joint Authorities Technical Review, a panel including air-safety regulators from the United States, Canada, China, Indonesia, European Union and Brazil.\n\nReuters reported on Sept. 17 the review\u2019s recommendations will include citing regulations that need to be harmonized internationally and where communications can be improved at the FAA and among international regulators, citing a person briefed on the matter.\n\nHart on Friday said the panel would release its recommendations to the FAA \u201cshortly,\u201d but declined to provide more details on the timeline. He said the panel\u2019s goal was not for all of its members to agree, but to provide a wide range of opinions and recommendations to the FAA.\n\nHart spoke to students the Vaughn College of Aeronautics and Technology in Queens. Asked by a student whether passengers can be expected to fly again on a 737 MAX, Hart said he predicted people would \u201csooner or later forget\u201d about the crashes and investigations.\n\n\u201cThis will be the safest airplane out there by the time it has to go through all the hoops and hurdles,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also was optimistic when asked whether the deadly crashes would spell the end for Boeing\u2019s 737 MAX program.\n\n\u201cIt will be a cold day in hell before Southwest starts moving away from 737s because that\u2019s all they got,\u201d Hart said, referring to Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N), which has canceled flights into January because of the MAX grounding.\n\nA Southwest Airlines spokesman declined to comment directly on Hart\u2019s comments but said the airline has \u201cno plans to veer away from our all-737 fleet.\u201d", "description": "The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration process for certifying new airplanes is not broken but needs to be improved, the chair of an international panel of air-safety regulators, tasked to review Boeing Co's 737 Max, said on Friday.", "authors": ["Tina Bellon", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434675510&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q1UP", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
