She said: 'He will be allowed to come back to Middlesbrough and live among us.\n\nLuke Mason after the collision: The pair, who were both 18 at the time, had been enjoying a night out celebrating a birthday when banned driver Hamid crashed into them both, leaving Mr Mason in an induced coma with a broken spine and Mr Lockwood with severe facial injuries\n\n'After running over my son and his friend he drove over the top of my son's body. How do you do that?\n\n'He broke my son's back, ribs, arms, collar bone and pelvis. His elbow was dislocated and his back and head was left without any skin.\n\n'His lung had collapsed and we were told he needed immediate surgery but to be prepared that his body was so weak there's a chance he wouldn't make it.\n\n'But he did make it and five operations later he's still here and still recovering. Yet this man fled the scene and then lied for months about it, blaming someone else.'\n\nMs Mason added she was 'disgusted' with the justice system. She added: 'There's never been any justice for us and lots of families like ours.\n\n'It makes me angry to live here and totally let down. We were told at the time because of the severity of his crimes he would face deportation upon release, yet the authorities say he belongs nowhere.'\n\nMr Mason who has undergone operations and is still recovering from the devastating injuries\n\nHamid, of Dorman Gardens, Linthorpe, had previous convictions for dangerous driving and driving while disqualified before causing the injuries.\n\nLuke and Matthew were crossing a road at about 1.15am on October 15, 2017, when they were hit by the car before driver Hamid left the scene.\n\nHamid pleaded guilty to two charges of causing serious injury by dangerous driving - having previously claimed he was not at the wheel at the time of the accident.\n\nHe initially suggested the driver was someone else from Kuwait. Mr Clarke, MP for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, is now seeking an urgent meeting for himself and Luke Mason with Justice Secretary Robert Buckland to discuss the case.\n\nMr Clarke said: 'I want to discuss the sentencing guidelines for crimes of this nature, which in my view are far too weak.\n\n'The judge himself observed at the trial that he felt the sentence should have been stronger. As far as the maximum sentence is concerned, any alteration would require Parliamentary attention.\n\n'But there are many, many people who would wonder whether this sentence was sufficient for causing injury while driving a vehicle which, if misused, would be likely to cause far more injury than a simple assault.\n\n'Second, I will ask the Secretary of State to review the very strong case for Mr Hamid, who is originally from Kuwait, to be deported under the UK Borders Act 2007 as a foreign national offender.\n\n'This was a horrible and cowardly incident with devastating consequences.' Kings academy student Luke was forced to hold back a year from taking his A Levels following his injuries.\n\nIn August, the now 19-year-old celebrated achieving three A grades in politics, history and religious studies, and a B in economics before going on to study philosophy, politics and economics at York.", "description": "Hadi Hamid, 40, was jailed for four years after he ploughed his blue Dodge Avenger into Luke Mason and Matthew Lockwood, both 18, outside Empire club in Middlesbrough in", "authors": ["Rod Ardehali For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/09/19828000-0-image-a-17_1571302390097.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
