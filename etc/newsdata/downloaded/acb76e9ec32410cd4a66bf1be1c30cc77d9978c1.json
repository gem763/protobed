By trying to come up with a backdoor workaround, Mr. McConnell said, Democrats are working to give the wealthiest earners a bigger tax break.\n\nMr. McConnell urged his colleagues to utilize \u201ccommon sense\u201d and reject the Democrats\u2019 efforts when it comes to a vote later on Wednesday.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
