On one level, it is. But for Arthur, who has spent three years working on his film, and for many Pastafarians who believe their faith embodies some profound \u2013 and profoundly important \u2013 principles, it is a lot more.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mienke de Wilde\u2019s ID card photos.

From Brexit to Trump, we applaud blind faith and are sceptical about overwhelming observable evidence.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that rationality is just no match for irrationality. That ship sailed in 2016. People now don\u2019t change their minds, they double down on their irrationality, and using facts, science and reason to contest the unreasonable is simply driving us all further apart. Maybe it\u2019s time to try a different approach.\u201d\n\nPasta strainers and pirates: how the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster was born Read more\n\nA different approach is, undeniably, what Flying Spaghetti Monsterism offers. The church was founded in 2005 by Bobby Henderson, at the time a 25-year-old US physics graduate, as a response to Christian fundamentalists demanding the teaching of creationism in Kansas school science classes. Its name is a portmanteau of pasta and Rastafarianism.\n\nIn an open letter, Henderson argued that if intelligent design was to be taught alongside evolution, so should the belief that, with the aid of His Noodly Appendages, an invisible and undetectable Flying Spaghetti Monster created the universe, probably after drinking heavily (thus explaining its many flaws).\n\nLike other religions, the church has a gospel and, rather than commandments, eight \u201cI\u2019d really rather you didn\u2019ts\u201d (two having been lost). These suggest ways to live your life happily without infringing on others\u2019 rights to do the same \u2013 a morality based on harmonious co-existence, nonjudgmental conduct \u201cand generally not being a dick\u201d.\n\nHenderson\u2019s basic point, expertly if satirically made, was that since intelligent design was every bit as much of an evidence-based theory as the unshakable belief that the world was created by an omniscient flying monster made of spaghetti, nothing should be taught in science classes bar science.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Math\u00e9 Coolen, an archbishop of Pastafarianism, wearing his colander in court in a still from the documentary.

Who gets to decide that? And why should faith \u2013 or lack of it \u2013 have anything to do with rights?\n\nFor Derk Venema, an eloquent Dutch legal expert who has worked with De Wilde, his former student, to develop her arguments for wearing a colander on her driving licence photo, Pastafarianism raises genuine human rights issues \u2013 even if (or perhaps because) it is also satirical.\n\n\u201cI started out thinking this was just a big joke,\u201d Venema says. \u201cBut the more you look at it, the more you see it is about fundamental principles. The Dutch courts have denied it has any serious message, but it manifestly does: non-violence, tolerance, loving each other \u2013 the same principles as many established religions.\u201d\n\nThe European court has previously determined that to be recognised as such, a religion must be cogent, coherent, important to its followers, and \u201cserious\u201d. On the latter point, Venema argues that the humour and good fun of Flying Spaghetti Monsterism is simply a more modern, accessible way of getting its message across.\n\nAs De Wilde \u2013 who after three long years is starting to struggle with wearing a colander every day, but whose determination to take her case to the European court remains undimmed \u2013 puts it: \u201cThe fact that the church is fun doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t serious in what it stands for.\n\n\u201cI can imagine it all looks very odd if you\u2019re not a believer. But that\u2019s the case with many faiths \u2013 people who walk on water or split themselves in three, for example. Personally, I find other religions unbelievable.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest De Wilde reads the Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster. Photograph: www.ipastafaridoc.com\n\nMoreover, argues Venema, even theologians have \u201cnever really been able to agree on what constitutes a religion. So should the state really get to decide? For me, if it looks like a religion, with certain customs and traditions; if its followers call it a religion; and if they call themselves believers, that should be it.\u201d\n\nMost importantly, in many societies belief in an established religion comes with certain privileges: from the right to sport religious headwear on your ID photo in the Netherlands, to faith schools in the UK and full-scale tax exemption for US megachurches. \u201cWe say, as long as there are special rights for believers, they should apply to all religions,\u201d says Venema.\n\nAlm, a journalist, writer, publisher and former MP, has fought his five-year court battle to get Pastafarianism recognised as a religion in Austria as part of a broader struggle for a true separation of church and state and genuine religious freedom \u2013 which, he argues, should include freedom from religion.\n\n\u201cAll we ask is a level playing field,\u201d he says. \u201cTotal neutrality of the state towards whatever belief I hold. We don\u2019t want anything forbidden, but the law must apply equally to all of us, whatever we believe in and whether we believe nothing at all. Complete freedom of religion. It\u2019s political.\u201d\n\nHe readily concedes, however, that Flying Spaghetti Monsterism is a diverse church. \u201cFor some, it\u2019s not a political thing at all. In some countries, Pastafarians mainly just want to have fun and eat pasta.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bruder Spaghettus, a church minister, by a \u2018noodle mass\u2019 sign on the German-Polish border. Photograph: www.ipastafaridoc.com\n\nArthur, whose film follows Venema and Alm through their court battles and also features Bruder Spaghettus, the luxuriantly bearded leader of the Kirche des Fliegenden Spaghettimonster in Germany, says Pastafarianism is like other religions, with a supernatural deity, a prophet, and lessons of morality in holy scriptures.\n\n\u201cUnlike other religions, it\u2019s left out hate, bigotry, violence and dogma \u2013 its only dogma is that there is no dogma. But by challenging innocuous privileges like the right to wear religious headgear on an ID photo, it makes us think about others, like the right not to vaccinate your children, say, or to use tax-free income to buy private jets so you can fly round preaching science is a conspiracy.\u201d\n\nSo Pastafarians, says Arthur, whose film premieres at the Nashville film festival in the first weekend of October, \u201care actually saying, \u2018Look, if no one\u2019s going to talk to each other like adults any more, let\u2019s try something else.\u2019\n\n\u201cBy putting their own beliefs on display, in a fun way, they make us think more deeply about ours. And in a time of flat-earthers, anti-vaxxers, fake news and alternative facts, they may just be the saviour we\u2019ve been waiting for.
