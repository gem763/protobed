The launch coincides with updates to the company\u2019s loyalty credit and debit cards and a new digital wallet for drivers and couriers. Drivers and couriers who register for an Uber Debit Account will get paid in real time, said Peter Hazlehurst, head of Uber Money. The features will be available to drivers in the U.S. in the coming weeks, eventually rolling out to other countries. (The Logic)\n\nTalking point: Uber is under pressure to turn a profit as rivals chip away at its market share. Lyft, for instance, is growing faster than Uber and said last week it will be profitable by 2021; Uber hasn\u2019t offered an estimated timeline for achieving profitability. Boosting its loyalty program could help Uber retain some of its customers and cash as competition ramps up. While Monday\u2019s launch focused on financial services to help its drivers and couriers, Uber Money doesn\u2019t address many workers\u2019 main grievance concerning pay: that they ought to be classified as employees deserving of minimum wages, overtime pay and benefits.", "description": "", "authors": ["Catherine Mcintyre"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
