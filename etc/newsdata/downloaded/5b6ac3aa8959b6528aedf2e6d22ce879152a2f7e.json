A handful of recurring fears are showing up in my group chats, like: My son told me he\u2019s playing alone at recess, does that mean he has no friends? My daughter got excluded from a game of house \u2014 is mean girl behavior starting in preschool now?\n\nThere\u2019s also the array of emotions that you may feel watching your kid toddle out into the world without you. I can attest to thinking deeply unkind and possibly demented thoughts about someone else\u2019s 4-year-old the first time I saw my older girl get pushed down on the playground. Those protective feelings are a \u201cbiological instinct, we\u2019re designed to help our offspring survive,\u201d said Sally Beville Hunter, Ph.D., a clinical assistant professor in the department of child and family studies at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. I didn\u2019t exact revenge on that pushy preschooler, but I understand the urge to get involved when you believe your child is getting emotionally or physically hurt.\n\nI spoke to two child psychologists, a psychotherapist and a school counselor about what is developmentally appropriate for children when it comes to making friends, why playing alone doesn\u2019t necessarily mean anything is amiss and when healthy kid conflict edges into bullying.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening developmentally: Before kids are around 3, they will mostly be engaging in parallel play \u2014 which means they will be doing the same activity next to each other, but not really interacting. Between 3 and 5, kids are just learning how to play together. \u201cThey may not yet prefer peers over parents,\u201d Dr. Hunter said, but they should have the desire to play with other kids. Which is to say, don\u2019t fret if your kid doesn\u2019t want after-school play dates just yet \u2014 as long as he enjoys socializing with other children at school and in general, he\u2019s on track.", "description": "Just because children play alone at recess doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re lonely.", "authors": ["Jessica Grose"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/18/multimedia/18-parentingnl-playground/18-parentingnl-playground-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
