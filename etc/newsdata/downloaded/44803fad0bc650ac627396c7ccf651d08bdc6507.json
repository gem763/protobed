Her handbag - which had her purse, phone and bank cards in it - was found on a beach 40 minutes away where she had been at a party\n\nHer mother is hoping that Amelia, a former student at Bhasvic in Hove, got 'lost on her way back' and the search party will be able to find her.\n\nAmelia's sister, Georgie Bambridge, 19, told the BBC that her relatives were in pieces and said that her sister was an integral part of the family.\n\n'We need to be strong and we are trying to be really positive, but it's the unknown,' she said.\n\nDuring an earlier interview, Georgie said that Amelia would message the family whenever she had wifi.\n\nShe said: 'She is strong minded, really sensible and very organised.\n\n'She spent the last year Googling solo female travelling, looking at pages and blogs and sorting out everything.\n\n'I'm just in shock, she has never done anything like this before.\n\n'I spoke to her Wednesday and she normally messages us every now and then, every time she got wifi.\n\nAmelia was last seen on Police Beach, Koh Rong Island in Cambodia at a beach party.

Left: Amelia and her mother, Ms Bambridge\n\n'I told her to put loads of pictures online to see what she was up to. It's horrendous but we need to be positive and she needs to be found.'\n\nAmelia left the UK last month after completing an apprenticeship.\n\nRyan Harris, 18, who was part of the group travelling the Asian country with the 21-year-old, raised the alarm.\n\nHe said that the operation into finding Amelia has now stepped up in to full gear.\n\n'People are diving. People are checking the jungles and the beaches,' he said.\n\n'Police sent three search teams out, so they're helping as well. It's a whole island thing now. Everyone's looking.'\n\nRyan moved on to another island with plans to link back up with Miss Bambridge later.\n\nHe said: 'She was one of the first people I met over here about a week ago.\n\n'I met her in Phnom Penh and we got the boat to Koh Rong, we all spent a few days together and met up with a few other people in a big group.\n\nAmelia's family have posted a picture on her Instagram of the outfit they believe she was last seen in (left).

He said: 'She was one of the first people I met over here about a week ago'\n\n'We went on to a neighbouring island but she stayed there with another girl I know who had travelled with us on the boat over.\n\n'I then had to travel back to Koh Rong after leaving my passport at the hostel and when I got there two people told me she had gone missing.\n\n'I assumed she would turn up but I have since travelled another 12 hours on a bus to Siem Reap and she still has not been found. She is supposed to be in Siem Reap by now.\n\n'From my experience I would say it is out of character for her not to come back after a few hours and it is a small island.\n\nAmelia was last seen wearing a tropical print shirt. She has a cow tattoo on her forearm and two cat tattoos on her legs\n\n'Even if you go your separate ways after a few drinks you see people again ten or 20 minutes later. She should have come back by now.'\n\nRyan explained that the hostel held passports to ensure customers paid the bill but Amelia had not gone back for hers.\n\n'She hasn't gone back for that or checked out which raises a red flag,' he said.\n\nAmelia was last seen wearing a tropical print shirt, according to the Lucie Blackman Trust.\n\nShe has a cow tattoo on her forearm and two cat tattoos on her legs.\n\nA Foreign Office spokesperson said: 'We are assisting the family of a British woman who has been reported missing in Cambodia and are in close contact with the Cambodian police.'", "description": "British gap year student Amelia Bambridge was last seen at a beach party 40 minutes away from her hostel on the island of Koh Rong, south west Cambodia before she went missing.", "authors": ["William Cole For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/12/20214292-0-image-a-13_1572089021429.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
