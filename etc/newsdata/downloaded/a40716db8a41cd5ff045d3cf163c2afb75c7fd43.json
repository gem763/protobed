Police are set to give further details in a news conference Friday morning.\n\nA spokeswoman for Vale said the miner didn\u2019t have an immediate comment. A spokesman for T\u00dcV S\u00dcD had no immediate comment. The charges come almost eight months after Vale\u2019s mine-waste dam collapsed in the town of Brumadinho, killing 270 people, the world\u2019s most deadly disaster of its kind in more than half a century. Under Brazilian law, police can only formally accuse suspects, while it is up to prosecutors to file the charges before a judge. \u2014Alistair MacDonald in London contributed to this article.
