When you owe \u00a31.7bn, not much needs to go wrong to tip you over the edge \u2013 and with Thomas Cook a lot had been going wrong.\n\nIn fact, Thomas Cook has been struggling for a decade. Mergers with MyTravel and Co-Op had left it with 1,200 high street stores JUST as consumers were moving online.\n\nIt had a near death experience in 2011 but was saved when its lenders agreed to support it during a restructuring that saw it close over 600 bricks and mortar outlets.\n\nThomas Cook\u2019s basic business model is to buy up package holidays in bulk months in advance and then sell them on. It's inherently risky as terror attacks, currency moves, unexpected heatwaves in the UK and uncertainty about ease of travel and insurance arrangements after Brexit could and did hit demand leaving the company exposed.\n\nIn May it announced a loss of \u00a31.5bn, pushing it further into debt. Its largest shareholder, the Chinese company Fosun - which also owns another holiday company, Club Med \u2013 offered to plough in \u00a3450m but the company\u2019s lenders didn\u2019t think there was enough cash to see it through the lean winter months.\n\nIt required another \u00a3200m and when that couldn\u2019t be raised privately, it turned to the government, which refused, just as it had with contractor Carillion to prop up a private company with taxpayers' money.\n\nThomas Cook\u2019s chief executive took home \u00a38m in pay and bonuses in the last four years and there will be an investigation into the conduct of directors. That will be little comfort to 21,000 Thomas Cook workers who are facing unemployment rather than a bit of holiday disruption.", "description": "All holidays and flights are cancelled after the firm collapses, putting 21,000 jobs at risk.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://m.files.bbci.co.uk/modules/bbc-morph-news-waf-page-meta/4.0.0/bbc_news_logo.png"}
