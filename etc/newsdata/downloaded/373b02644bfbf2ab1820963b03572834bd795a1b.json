REUTERS/Mohamed Abd El Ghany\n\nNEW DELHI (Reuters) - Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) is seeking more airlines to partner with in India for code-sharing agreements to expand its presence in the country, a senior company executive told Reuters on Friday.\n\nLufthansa is focusing on growing its network in India in part because of the grounding of the country\u2019s biggest private carrier Jet Airways (JET.NS) which stopped flying in April after running out of cash.\n\nThe German airline, which already has a code-share agreement with state-run carrier Air India, has an interline agreement with Vistara, a full service carrier owned by the Tata Group and Singapore Airlines (SIAL.SI), which it is keen to expand, Alain Chisari, vice president, Asia Pacific, Lufthansa Group, said.\n\n\u201cVistara fits really well with our product portfolio because they\u2019ve got the premium proposition as well. We are looking forward to expanding the relationship with Vistara but also other partners,\u201d he said in an interview in New Delhi.\n\nAirlines with interline agreements share things such as check-in and baggage handling, while code shares allow airlines to market flights to each others customers.\n\nChisari declined to comment on whether Lufthansa is in talks with Vistara for a code-share agreement.\n\nThe German group is encouraged by the growth in passenger numbers flying to international destinations from India. India\u2019s outbound passenger number grew to 25.5 million a year in 2018 from 18.4 million in 2015.\n\n\u201cThe growth, the potential, the economy, the distribution of purchasing power is so promising for us,\u201d said Chisari, adding that he would also like to bring other group carriers like Austrian Airlines and Brussels Airlines to India.", "description": "Lufthansa is seeking more airlines to partner with in India for code-sharing agreements to expand its presence in the country, a senior company executive told Reuters on Friday.", "authors": ["Aditi Shah", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434555077&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q13I", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
