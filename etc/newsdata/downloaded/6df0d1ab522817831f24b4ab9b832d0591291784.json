The two pooches instantly struck up an unbreakable bond.\n\nNow, with pal Gus by his side, Alf is brave enough to play in the garden, walk along the road with confidence and explore the fields by his house on his own.\n\nDon\u2019t they make the cutest pair?\n\nRetired Barry, from Leeds, said: \u2018Before, Alf was so nervous, especially around traffic. Having another dog walking alongside him has made him more confident, and he will now happily cross roads and walk on pavements.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018When the traffic is really heavy, he still gets a bit nervous but is less panicked knowing that Gus is with him.\n\n\u2018We see him becoming more confident and going off and exploring on his own, but always making sure he knows where Gus is.\n\n\u2018Gus has a new friend and it is obvious that life is better when you have a friend to play with.\n\n\u2018When Alf was brought round for his first visit, him and Gus got on straight away and shot off into the garden.\n\n\u2018They\u2019re always playing together \u2013 like typical males they have the odd disagreement but nothing too serious.\n\nThey\u2019re the best of friends (Picture: Mercury Press)\n\n\u2018Gus has a friend now too \u2013 dogs work better when they\u2019re together, especially small dogs.\u2019\n\nAlf\u2019s previous owners were forced to park their car as close to the doorway as possible if they wanted to get the terrified pup out of the house, so in July, they handed him over to Barry.\n\nBarry, a self-confessed \u2018Labrador man\u2019, and partner Karen, 60, who is retired, now say they wouldn\u2019t be without the pair.\n\nBarry said: \u2018Alf\u2019s settled in really well. He was so nervous at first \u2013 his previous owners couldn\u2019t even take him for a walk without putting him in the car, so they knew he was better off with another dog.\n\n\u2018We live in the countryside so he\u2019s a lot more comfortable.\n\n\u2018When the traffic is really heavy he still gets nervous sometimes, but those things take time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We\u2019re completely sold on them. Dachshunds are great dogs. I\u2019m a Labrador man but I wouldn\u2019t be without them.\n\n\u2018Alf was called Alfonso when he came to us but we had to rename him because I\u2019m 6ft 4ins and there\u2019s no way I was going to walk across a field shouting \u201cAlfonso\u201d.\u2019\n\nThe family together (Picture: Mercury Press)\n\nSam Compton, from the Red Foundation, a charity dedicated to rescuing Dachshunds, helped to rehome Alf.\n\nShe said: \u2018I\u2019ve never seen a dog with agoraphobia before.\n\n\u2018Alfonso was in a lovely home but he was really anxious, the home was in a built up area and he was too nervous to go out.\n\n\u2018The couple started borrowing a friend\u2019s dog as a friend for him and found he was way more confident and comfortable going out with company, but they weren\u2019t in a position to buy a new dog.\n\n\u2018They put his needs first and helped him find his perfect home.\n\n\u2018A lot of people don\u2019t know what kind of dog they\u2019re buying, they just think dachshunds are little and cute \u2013 but they are also quite stubborn and they\u2019re hounds so they have a high prey drive.\n\n\u2018It causes a massive problem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018More Dachshunds are requiring homes now, and we rescue them from all sorts of situations.\n\n\u2018We have rehomed over 120 this year and a huge number of these are down to the home not being right for the breed so research is key.\u2019\n\nMORE: Couple who met on dating app marry after just two months of dating\n\nMORE: Dad\u2019s heartwarming appeal after only two friends show up to autistic daughter\u2019s birthday\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "An agoraphobic sausage dog will finally go outside thanks to his new doggy friend.", "authors": ["Hattie Gladwell"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_88788886_1571116525.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
