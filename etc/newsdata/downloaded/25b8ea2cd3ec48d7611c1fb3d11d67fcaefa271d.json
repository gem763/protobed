The sailing branch\u2019s planes must improve. Its training, too.\n\n\u201cCommentary from Tailhook 2019 suggests a new crisis is at hand,\u201d James Holmes, a professor at the U.S. Naval War College in Rhode Island, wrote in Proceedings, the professional journal of the U.S. Naval Institute.\n\nHolmes likened naval aviation\u2019s current dilemma to a similar emergency that took place during the 1960s. \u201cBack then the foe was North Vietnam, a doughty opponent that nonetheless posed little threat outside its borders,\u201d Holmes wrote.\n\nBy the 1960s the Navy fielded carrier-based fighter jets whose design philosophy centered on guided missiles. It had become an article of faith that U.S. aircraft would prosecute missile engagements at \u201cstandoff\u201d range, firing beyond enemy weapons range and beyond visual range. Adversaries would never get off a shot in reply. Missiles had rendered gunfights a thing of the past, or so it was thought in the early 1960s. Yet Ho Chi Minh\u2019s pilots were an ornery lot, refusing to follow the script American tacticians had written for them. Rather than remain at standoff distance to be blasted out of the sky, North Vietnamese airmen closed to dogfighting range and took their chances in gun duels. Imagine that: an enemy might decline to do your bidding. U.S. aviators were ill prepared for North Vietnamese tactics. Indeed, the F-4 Phantom\u2014the Navy\u2019s premier fighter in the 1960s\u2014was not even equipped with guns for close-range combat. \u2026. A tougher-than-expected antagonist stunned naval aviation into arming its warplanes for dogfighting, developing tactics for close combat, and re-grounding naval aviation\u2019s culture on solid precepts\u2014including the soundest of all military assumptions, namely that America\u2019s enemies get a vote in war and will always cast it against our efforts.\n\nThe present crisis has its roots in the period of relative geopolitical calm that followed the end of the Cold War, Holmes explained. Naval aviation\u2019s training standards slipped. Its planes went years without meaningful upgrades.\n\nChina\u2019s rise as an economic and military power, and Russia\u2019s own military resurgence, ended the calm -- and revealed that U.S. naval aviation was unprepared for major warfare.\n\n\u201cRecent years, declared one [panelist], have seen a \u2018huge shift\u2019 from the relatively placid interlude following the Cold War,\u201d Holmes wrote. \u201cCarrier aircraft no longer boast the same \u2018kinematic advantage,\u2019 or edge in speed and energy maneuverability, that once granted them near-invincibility in the Balkan wars, Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nAircraft designers must try to restore that hardware advantage, making air battles lopsided once again, even as aviators experiment with new tactics to ensure the U.S. \u201cman in the box\u201d is the finest combat pilot in the world. Fittingly for teachers, the panelists fretted more about human than mat\u00e9riel shortcomings. They spoke forcefully on behalf of additional manpower for naval aviation, including the training apparatus. Squadrons need access to more capacious airspace to practice countering longer-range enemy weaponry and handling longer-range weapons of their own. Above all, U.S. aviators need more flight hours. Just as athletes hone their tactical acumen through constant practice and self-critique, airmen need sufficient resources and time to undertake \u201crepetition after repetition after repetition\u201d\u2014and flourish in action.\n\nThe good news for the wider Navy is that it seems to recognize it has a problem, Holmes noted. Naval professionals such as the Tailhook panelists are working hard to improve aviators\u2019 training while encouraging the Navy and industry to prioritize the right weapons programs, all in a context of \u201cruthless\u201d honesty.\n\n\u201cRenewing the culture of self-criticism promises to be easier in the tactical realm than in the murkier, more ambiguous realm of strategy and policy,\u201d Holmes wrote.\n\nResults are instant and verge on irrefutable in air combat, whereas historians quarrel without end about strategic cause and effect in long-ago conflicts. Institutional honesty is a pivotal virtue for the aviation community, as indeed it is for any military institution. Naval aviators need to admit they may lose under certain circumstances\u2014otherwise it would not be a fair fight\u2014and harness that conviction to fire the quest for innovation. The panel espoused employing objective, data-driven analysis to evaluate aircrew performance in battle scenarios rather than issuing subjective, easily fudged verdicts certifying who lost and who won. A ... commentator [with the Topgun training community] reported simulating \u201cred air\u201d that acquitted itself perfectly every time. Going up against a perfect foe \u201cpunishes\u201d even slight errors committed by \u201cblue air\u201d (U.S. crews).", "description": "A panel of young aviators voiced a harsh warning to the audience at the U.S. Navy\u2019s annual Tailhook aviation convention in Nevada in September 2019: the Navy\u2019s pilots aren\u2019t ready to do battle with a high-tech foe such as China.", "authors": ["David Axe"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/346Nqi8ltV6knPTdi5HeSA--~B/aD05NTk7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/d5ee0b0a80965892a3f26db96398de5a", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
