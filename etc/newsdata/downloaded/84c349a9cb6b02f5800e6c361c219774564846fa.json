But there is never any harm in a short recap of \u201cthe story so far\u201d, even for an audience that knows it well.\n\nMuch more often, we make the opposite mistake of assuming too much knowledge on the part of the reader. I was struck last week by an account by a fellow journalist of a conversation she overheard on a train: \u201cA neighbouring couple who had heard something about parliament being suspended, gave up three lines into the BBC News story in exasperation and talked about something else.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nI am sure that if they had been reading The Independent, they would have known what was going on.\n\nFlat out: We introduced an exclusive analysis of opinion polls this week thus: \u201cPolling savant John Curtice explains the lay of the land.\u201d Henry Peacock has been in touch to suggest that we should have said \u201cthe lie of the land\u201d.\n\nThat is indeed the phrase that I would use. If pressed, I would explain it by saying it means \u201cthe way the land lies\u201d and that most people would not say \u201cthe way the land lays\u201d.\n\nThe Oxford dictionary describes \u201cthe lay of the land\u201d as North American and \u201clie\u201d as British. This would explain why the \u201clay\u201d phrase is used four times as often on the internet, according to Google \u2013 even Google Books, which has millions of titles scanned, finds that it occurs three times as often.\n\nIn British newspapers, however, \u201cthe lie of the land\u201d still has the advantage, used 66 times over the past year, as opposed to 49 instances of \u201cthe lay of the land\u201d.\n\nI suspect this is one of those shifts in language that has nearly run its course. We should prefer \u201cthe lie of the land\u201d while there are many British readers for whom \u201cthe lay of the land\u201d feels wrong, but we should accept that it may start to sound old-fashioned.\n\nFor ever more: While on the subject of language change, I am pleased to report that we used \u201cany more\u201d as two words 13 times last week, and as one word only eight times. I know it is only a stylistic preference, but I think \u201cany more\u201d is more elegant than \u201canymore\u201d, just as I prefer \u201cfor ever\u201d to \u201cforever\u201d.
