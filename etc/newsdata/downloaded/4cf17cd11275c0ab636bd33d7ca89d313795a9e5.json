There has been no evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens\n\nThe taxpayer funds had been approved by Congress to help Ukraine protect against Russian aggression.\n\nTrump has denied wrongdoing and assailed the probe.\n\nThose scheduled to testify this week include Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the European Union who was involved in efforts to get Ukraine to open the Biden investigation, and Masha Yovanovitch, who was abruptly recalled from her post as US ambassador to Ukraine in May after Trump supporters questioned her loyalty to the president.\n\nThe White House could formally tell House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi as early as Monday that it will ignore politicians' demands for documents until the Democratic-controlled House holds a vote to formally approve the impeachment inquiry.\n\nPelosi says a vote is not needed. Democrats say she would prevail if one were held, although very few Republicans would be expected to side with the Democratic majority. Congress returns to Washington, DC, on October 15 after a two-week recess.\n\nThe impeachment investigation could lead to the approval by the House of formal charges against Trump.\n\nA trial on whether to remove him from office would then be held in the Republican-controlled Senate.\n\nSecond whistle-blower\n\nOn Sunday, lawyers said a second whistle-blower had come forward to substantiate an August complaint from an unidentified US intelligence official, which touched off the investigation.\n\nA bipartisan group of about 90 former national security officials on Sunday called on federal officials and media outlets to protect the initial whistle-blower's identity, citing protections under the law, even as Trump has publicly sought for it to be revealed.\n\n{articleGUID}\n\nDiplomatic text messages released by Democrats last week show that US officials were involved in the effort to secure a public commitment from Ukraine to look into the business dealings of Hunter Biden.\n\nTrump has alleged that Hunter Biden profited in his business dealings in Ukraine and China from his father's position, and that Biden, as vice president, pushed Ukraine to fire a prosecutor to impede a probe of a company tied to his son.\n\nHowever, the prosecutor in question was widely regarded by Washington and its European allies as being too lax in his investigations.\n\nSondland is scheduled to testify on Tuesday before the three House committees leading the impeachment probe and Yovanovitch is due to appear on Friday.", "description": "Democrats leading the Trump impeachment inquiry say the agencies must turn over documents related to Ukraine by Oct 15.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/7/4bf3e4e9573741e499850f84f8cc32f3_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
