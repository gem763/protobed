Like everything Steyer spends his money on, the ranch is intended to change the world. In this case he wants to demonstrate that \u201cregenerative agriculture\u201d can be just as profitable as the factory farming that Steyer believes is destroying the planet. But according to Politico Magazine, Steyer\u2019s experimental ranch isn\u2019t producing all of the desired results thus far:\n\nWhile President Donald Trump accuses Democrats of wanting to ban beef\u2014and prominent climate activists and alternative meat entrepreneurs denounce beef\u2014Steyer is quietly producing beef: grass-fed, hormone-free and intensively managed through a system that mimics the wild buffalo herds that once roamed America\u2019s grassy expanses. He\u2019s also financing exhaustive scientific research on the property, hoping to prove that ranching in harmony with nature, without lethal chemicals to protect grass or corn feedlots to fatten cattle, can pull carbon from the air, hold water on the land, and produce enough delicious meat to disrupt the beef-industrial complex. Basically, TomKat is an unusually spacious and scenic lab, experimenting on 110 mooing, cud-chewing, manure-dropping specimens, aiming to produce evidence to back changes on the agricultural operations that cover half the land on earth. So far, its experiments\u2014like Steyer\u2019s campaign, which has attracted enough support to qualify him for the fall debates but not enough to contend\u2014have produced mixed results. TomKat\u2019s regenerative approach has provided clear environmental benefits, reducing erosion and enhancing plant diversity at the ranch, and its scientific monitoring program has already been extended throughout the state. But there\u2019s no evidence that it\u2019s sequestering more carbon in the soil to help the climate, much less demonstrating a viable business model for ranchers who aren\u2019t billionaires\u2026 Steyer and Taylor have sunk more than $10 million into TomKat, and the sales from their premium LeftCoast GrassFed beef brand don\u2019t come close to covering their costs. Steyer joked to me that ranching has been an expensive hobby, but that\u2019s the point: Most cattlemen can\u2019t afford to risk capital on unconventional eco-theories about holistic management and nature-based grazing, unless someone like Steyer can prove it will benefit their land and their bottom line.\n\nBut let\u2019s face it, Steyer doesn\u2019t really care whether this makes economic sense. It would probably be fine with him if the price of beef skyrocketed. His real goal is improved carbon sequestration to fight climate change. But here too, the evidence suggests the ranch isn\u2019t working:\n\nPoint Blue Conservation, the group TomKat hired to conduct research at the ranch, has conducted ongoing soil samples and found that water infiltration has improved significantly\u2026 But Point Blue\u2019s data for soil carbon, available on TomKat\u2019s website, suggest the ranch is actually storing less carbon than it was in 2014; only nine of the 42 sites sampled by Point Blue showed improvement, 20 registered declines, and only two achieved the ranch\u2019s carbon goals for 2020. Porzig speculated that California\u2019s severe drought may have artificially depressed TomKat\u2019s numbers, and noted that soil carbon tends to be a lagging indicator that can take years to improve in measurable ways. \u201cBut yeah, those results are a bummer,\u201d she acknowledged. They\u2019re a particular bummer considering all the hype around compensating farmers and ranchers for regenerative practices, under the assumption that those practices will automatically store more carbon. Booker, Ryan, Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, Steve Bullock and Michael Bennet all pushed the idea during the recent presidential debates and televised climate forums. \u201cWe\u2019re going to put farmers and ranchers in the driver\u2019s seat, renewable and sustainable agriculture, to make sure we capture more carbon out of the air and keep more of it in the soil,\u201d Beto O\u2019Rourke declared. The Drawdown list of climate solutions has \u201cregenerative agriculture\u201d at #11 and \u201cmanaged grazing\u201d at #19, with the combined potential to remove 40 gigatons of carbon. But if TomKat can\u2019t even realize that potential, why should the government spend taxpayer dollars to get others to follow its lead?\n\nThat\u2019s a great question. Another great question is why so many Democratic candidates are pushing this dubious solution to climate change while claiming to be heeding the science. This is one of the dangers of the rush to change the world in 12 years or less. It should also set off alarm bells about previous government-led efforts to manage food resources in places like Russia and China. When the ideologues get control of the food production, there\u2019s a potential for things to go very badly very quickly.\n\nThe story points out that Steyer\u2019s ranch may actually be worse for the environment than the competitors he hopes to replace. His natural ranching methods mean his cattle add weight more slowly, therefore it takes longer to produce the same amount of beef. So if the ranch isn\u2019t actually sequestering more carbon then it\u2019s almost certainly producing more carbon than those other ranches.\n\nThe director of sustainability research at the National Cattlemen\u2019s Beef Association told Politico Magazine, \u201cThe problem in this space is there\u2019s a lot of enthusiasm for things that don\u2019t have a lot of data. People have gotten way out over their skis.\u201d I guess it\u2019s good that Steyer is at least trying to put his theory into practice, but I wonder if he and his wife will dial back their enthusiasm for \u201cregenerative agriculture\u201d if the data continues to show it isn\u2019t working out as hoped.", "description": "\"yeah, those results are a bummer.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tom-Steyer.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
