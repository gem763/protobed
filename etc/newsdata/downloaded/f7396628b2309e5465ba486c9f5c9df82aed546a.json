His speciality was in playing earnest and haunted little boys \u2013 the isolated loner who could see dead people in The Sixth Sense, the cyborg child in Steven Spielberg\u2019s AI: Artificial Intelligence, or the plucky youngster determined to change the world for the better in Pay It Forward. Then he more or less disappeared. Yet it was not due to the destructive pressures of fame that have been the undoing of so many child stars. He didn\u2019t break down or cause a public spectacle. He crashed his car, once, but paid the fine with no special pleading. In fact, relatively speaking, his was a quite straightforward upbringing.\n\n\u201cI think sometimes there\u2019s an expectation for there to be that darkness,\u201d the actor, now 31, explains. \u201cBut I think there are a lot more stories of people who had positive experiences working as children and didn\u2019t have that kind of cliched storyline going forward. And that\u2019s been the case for me.\u201d\n\nOsment\u2019s drama-free journey from popular child star to stable, employed adult actor is far more common than the alternative, but he\u2019s right. It\u2019s the worst examples of post-fame frailty that linger in pop culture memory \u2013 the child stars that never escaped typecasting, or went off the rails amid gossip and scandal.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cI realise that I\u2019m very lucky,\u201d Osment concedes, \u201cbecause there were other kids who maybe didn\u2019t have parents that looked out for them, or worked on film sets that were not wholesome, or where they were not protected. But that was not my experience.\u201d\n\nOsment has also achieved something that even the most talented former child star would find tricky: he\u2019s been able to disappear. In the chilling Ted Bundy docudrama Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile, his character is a rare element of kind-hearted virtue \u2013 a compassionate co-worker of Bundy\u2019s trapped girlfriend Liz (Lily Collins). This guy, Jerry, is hopelessly in love with her and deeply concerned about her devotion to her sinister new beau.\n\nZac Efron understandably earned the lion\u2019s share of attention for his sneaky, slippery lead performance as Bundy \u2013 a provocative career left-turn if there ever was one. But the film marks something of a departure for Osment, too. In the decade since he returned to acting from a self-imposed hiatus, he has cornered the market in playing very bad guys, specifically mean manchildren or weirdoes, in things like Silicon Valley, Future Man and the Entourage movie. He\u2019s marvellous at doing so, but it\u2019s also welcome to see him play the opposite once again.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of actors will tell you that some of the most fun you can have is diverting expectations, and playing the villain can sometimes be a little bit more interesting than playing somebody on the straight-and-narrow,\u201d he explains. \u201cBut it works both ways too. After doing a run of villains and things like that, it\u2019s nice to change up the routine and to play someone a bit more on the good side. And it\u2019s a little less taxing.\u201d\n\nOsment is one of three former child stars who headline Extremely Wicked: Collins started out playing plucky teenage daughters (eg in The Blind Side), and Efron, of course, was an escapee from the Walt Disney factory. But while Efron always embodied a hunk-in-training, a non-threatening boy for pre-teen girls to lust after, Osment was a \u201cserious child actor\u201d in the young Jodie Foster mould. He also rarely acted alongside other children, tending to share the screen with men much older than himself: Michael Caine, Jude Law, Bruce Willis. It wasn\u2019t a deliberate star persona, Osment says today, but it did make his off-screen existence much easier.\n\n\u201cIt intruded less on my personal life that I wasn\u2019t in things that were being watched by my age rank,\u201d he says. \u201cSo going back to school, it wasn\u2019t like I was on a show that everybody at school was watching at the same time, and I think it made the growing-up process a little bit easier. Even going back to sixth grade after The Sixth Sense, that was a movie that my classmates were too young to see.\u201d\n\nIt would have been harder, he says, if he were a teen idol like Efron, or someone like his younger sister Emily, who found fame as one of the stars of Hannah Montana. \u201cBeing on those shows that were hugely popular with their own age groups, I think there\u2019s a lot more pressure and a lot more scrutiny, so I admire them both for coming through it,\u201d he says.\n\nToday Osment is respectful and friendly, if careful with his words, and has an upbeat sense of ease when it comes to talking about his life and career. Considering he\u2019d have every right to get visibly frustrated by yet another journalist endlessly asking him questions about things he did 20 years ago, it\u2019s quite remarkable.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The twist: The girl was never missing \u2013 it was just an elaborate hoax to lure an out-of-towner so the island's residents could sacrifice him to their Sun God.\n\nThe way Osment describes his early fame sounds almost blissful. He says he had no idea of the \u201ccraziness\u201d surrounding the making of AI at the time, from the ironclad secrecy Spielberg imposed on set (in tribute to the film\u2019s famously discreet producer Stanley Kubrick, who died shortly before production) to the fact that no cast member received a full script. As for competition with other child stars at the time \u2013 the likes of Jonathan Lipnicki or Alex D Linz \u2013 it doesn\u2019t sound like things got too nasty outside the audition room.\n\n\u201cThat was never my mentality with it,\u201d he explains. \u201cAnd that wasn\u2019t the way that my parents were either. Their line on things was: \u2018You could quit and go back to school any day you want when this stops being fun\u2019, so it was very little pressure and very little feeling of competition through all of that. For me it was always sort of a strange adventure.\u201d\n\nIn addition to his parents, Osment credits Spielberg with keeping him grounded. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of amazing things about Steven, but one of them is the effort that goes into him staying in contact with all the people that he\u2019s worked with,\u201d he says. \u201cI mean, getting birthday cards and graduation notes and speaking with him over the phone in the years since we worked together. He really does take a great interest in how the lives of his young performers go on. It\u2019s led to a pretty good record with the [young] actors that he\u2019s worked with.\u201d\n\nThat Osment stepped out of the limelight in 2003, when his young movie career was still thriving, similarly speaks to the nous of his support network. What followed was a relatively ordinary teenage life, with money trickling in via Osment\u2019s voiceover role in the wildly successful video game franchise Kingdom Hearts. The character of sword-wielding Sora remains the part Osment has played for the longest, even if many outside of its devoted following would have no idea he was involved with it.\n\n\u201cI remember I was doing a play in Philadelphia a couple of years ago,\u201d Osment says, \u201cand once a week they\u2019d have a school come in and see a matinee of the show and have a talk-back after, and every single question was, \u2018When\u2019s Kingdom Hearts 3 coming out?\u2019 I was surprised that kids would even know that I was connected to the game, to be honest. I\u2019m just doing the voiceover work for it, so my connection to it is basically me in a recording booth with the director and some of the producers in a little studio in Burbank. But it\u2019s one of the most unique things I\u2019ve ever been involved with.\u201d\n\nAfter high school, and still eager to act, Osment enrolled in an experimental theatre programme at New York University. There were more conventional courses available, he says, but ones that he felt wouldn\u2019t teach him anything he hadn\u2019t learned on movie sets already. After all, he had played the young son of Forrest Gump when he was just six and already had an Oscar nomination, for The Sixth Sense, by the age of 11.\n\n\u201cThis felt like something new and a completely different way of performing,\u201d he explains. \u201cSome programmes try and break down your previous habits and completely remake you as a different performer, but this one was more about taking what you know and setting it aside and then finding this new way of getting into the performance, and I learned a lot.\u201d\n\nUpon graduation, he eased back into theatre, film and television. He says he deliberately avoided what could be considered \u201cstunt casting\u201d, and has since become a regular presence in alternative comedy, appearing in shows including Drunk History, Comedy Bang! Bang! and the surreal Will Ferrell/Kristen Wiig series The Spoils of Babylon and The Spoils Before Dying. Comedy super-producers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg are additionally big fans, casting Osment against type in darkly comic superhero series Future Man and, most recently, The Boys.\n\nIt\u2019s in the latter that Osment embodies the kind of person he could have been if things went awry. On one level he is Mesmer, a superhero able to \u201cread\u201d people\u2019s thoughts and emotions. But in the universe of The Boys, he\u2019s also a celebrity has-been, signing autographs at conventions alongside the likes of Billy Zane and Tara Reid, who both gamely play themselves. Taking such a role was a brave move \u2013 one that proved his ability to laugh at himself, but also a subtle nod to the fact that his fallen status on the series is far removed from where Osment is in reality.\n\n\u201cI just feel lucky that I\u2019m able to do something that I\u2019ve done since I was a very young age and continue to have that be my job today,\u201d he says.\n\nYou can\u2019t help but believe him.\n\nExtremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile is available now on DVD, Blu-ray and digital download", "description": "For a brief time around the turn of the millennium, Haley Joel Osment was inescapable. His speciality was in playing earnest and haunted little boys \u2013 the isolated loner who could see dead people in The Sixth Sense, the cyborg child in Steven Spielberg\u2019s AI: Artificial Intelligence, or the plucky youngster determined to change the world for the better in Pay It Forward.
