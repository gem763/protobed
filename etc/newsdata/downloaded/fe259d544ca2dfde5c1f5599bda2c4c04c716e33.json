A couple wins is all. A long flight and a day to themselves and a date, at first, with Justin Verlander, and those couple wins.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nA World Series that never had to leave here, as the Washington Nationals had returned Friday afternoon having already won the first two games in Houston, left here having assumed an entirely different character. They hadn\u2019t challenged the Houston Astros as much as they\u2019d pissed them off.\n\nAt Nationals Park, the weather was great. The beer was cold. They\u2019d sung fun songs together. They\u2019d booed umps and Trumps. They\u2019d turned their caps inside out and bucked up when their best pitcher went down hours before his start and then, somewhere on the long shuffle out, perhaps realized they might have seen the last of this edition of the Nationals, of a long summer of inspiring baseball, of potential free agents Anthony Rendon and Stephen Strasburg, of an exceptionally cool ballclub. They waved goodbye. They prayed for a parade. And, as at the end of any long weekend, wondered where the time went.\n\nJoe Ross allowed four earned runs in five innings after starting for the injured Max Scherzer. (Rob Carr/Getty Images)\n\nIn fact, in order to find a fanbase, a franchise, with higher hopes that ultimately were drowned by the actual results of the baseball games, you\u2019d have to go back, like, five days.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Houston Astros had lost twice at home, had otherwise stomped on their tongues, and had the look of a squad that would underachieve for a second consecutive October. They won the next three games by a cumulative score of 19-3, including Game 5 by 7-1, and so George Springer, their outfielder, was asked what it was they\u2019d done on the off day to rediscover their best game.\n\n\u201cWe played beach volleyball,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d the reporter gushed.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said.\n\nThey put some balls in play. They won a lot of at-bats, both sides of the ball. They brought back Gerrit Cole, who went seven strong Sunday night. They watched Jose Altuve raise his series batting average to .360, and Michael Brantley his to .400 and, in Game 5, they hit three more home runs. They won the moments, which sounds goofy and hackneyed unless you saw them lose most of them in Houston, and up next to each other the contrast was startling. In Game 3, they took a lead in the second inning and did not relinquish it. In Game 4, in the first inning. In Game 5, the second inning.\n\nThat\u2019s some foot-on-neck stuff, especially while playing from behind.\n\n\u201cThe confidence comes from the success that we\u2019ve had,\u201d Astros manager A.J. Hinch said. \u201cWe feel like we\u2019re in every game. We\u2019ve had games where we\u2019ve come from behind. We\u2019ve had games where we\u2019ve stretched the lead. We\u2019ve had games like today where we just methodically kept going with big swings and we look up and we have a comfortable win.\n\n\u201cWe took a pretty heavy punch in the gut when it came to the first two games. The Nats came out hot. \u2026 And when you take a step back, and you\u2019re like, \u2018We\u2019re still in the World Series and it\u2019s still a race to four wins.\u2019 You win that first win.\u201d\n\nIn the midst of that came the news, learned hours before Sunday night\u2019s first pitch, that the Astros would not face Max Scherzer, but Joe Ross. A series that was, from Game 5 on, to measure its momentum in the width of a fungo bat, in the breadth of an injury report, Scherzer could not go because of neck spasms.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go Joe!\u201d the people shouted again and again, sensing if there was to be a happy ending, Joe would need some help.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go Joe!\u201d\n\nJoe Ross, 26, the former first-round draft pick, traded at 21 to the Nationals from the San Diego Padres, had not had a remarkable career. He suffered injuries and set-backs and in the summer of 2017 endured Tommy John surgery. For parts of five seasons he pitched in the major leagues and in each of the past three \u2014 over 64 innings in the past season \u2014 had an ERA above 5. He was not on the rosters of the Nationals\u2019 wild-card win or the division and league championship series. By Sunday night he\u2019d thrown two competitive innings in a month. In his only previous postseason start, three years ago in Los Angeles, he got eight outs and allowed four runs.\n\nIn the late afternoon, Dave Martinez, manager of the Nationals, had walked into his regular pregame news conference and said, \u201cBefore we get started, I want everybody to know that Max will not start today.\u201d\n\nThe room chewed on that piece of series-altering drama. As it did, Martinez continued, \u201cSo Joe Ross will start today.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Nationals scored just three runs in their three World Series games at home. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)\n\nThe city, those in curly W caps and red tees, had 3 1/2 hours to pass through grief\u2019s seven stages, or three or four of them at minimum, and when at 7:39 ET a long and lean figure climbed the stairs of the first-base dugout and strolled toward the right-field corner, tens of thousands of people began to plead, \u201cLet\u2019s go Joe! Let\u2019s go Joe!\u201d\n\nThe coming innings on a pitcher\u2019s mound shared with Cole, the crowd seemed to decide, would have to be part Joe Ross acumen, part Dave Martinez intuition and part outside inspiration, which is where the fans came in. The first pitch of the game \u2014 a 95-mph strike to Springer \u2014 brought them to their feet with a roar, along with further encouragement/insistence, \u201cLet\u2019s go Joe.\u201d\n\nWhen the home runs came \u2014 Yordan Alvarez in the second inning, Carlos Correa in the fourth \u2014 and the deficit was 2-0 and then 4-0, the chants from the bleachers to the luxury boxes continued, somewhat muted. And when Martinez rode Ross into a fifth inning, in spite of the growing score and the top of the Astros\u2019 lineup drawing near, Washington D.C. did not gripe, did not groan, did not wonder if its manager had lost his mind.\n\nThe boos it had saved for the sitting president, so much so the people here had little left for a game staggering toward defeat. They\u2019d waited 86 years for a World Series game here, got three of them, and lost them all, the last when their ace had to be helped into his shirt by his wife and then was scratched from his start.\n\n\u201cAs far as baseball goes, seems like something small happens and later in the at-bat it becomes something big,\u201d Ross said of a lost battle with Correa in the fourth inning, but he might also have addressed the story of a series that has twice appeared close to over.\n\nIt remains alive, turns out, and leaves here a little more interesting than how it arrived. So maybe it wasn\u2019t such a bad time after all.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "A World Series that never had to leave here, as the Washington Nationals had returned Friday afternoon having already won the first two games in Houston, left here having assumed an entirely different character.
