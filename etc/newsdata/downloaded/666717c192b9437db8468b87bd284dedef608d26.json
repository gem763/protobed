Let's check out the indicators and set a strategy to hopefully profit from a rally.\n\nIn the daily bar chart of the XLF, below, we can see a diamond-like pattern playing out since April. A diamond pattern is (obviously) a rare chart pattern and it can be a reversal pattern or it can be a continuation. In this case I believe we are looking at a continuation pattern and the XLF will resume the previous uptrend.\n\nA diamond is like putting together two triangle patterns back to back. First, prices trade up and down in wider swings and then the swings narrow again until the breakout. The pattern is difficult to recognize and hard to trade as a new high for the move up fails to have follow-through buying and a new low for the move down also fails to have follow-through selling. The right side or second part of the pattern is stronger -- heavier volume, improving technical studies, etc. Notice how the XLF trades below the rising 200-day moving average line in August but this month it only dips to the average line.\n\nTrading volume has been heavier from August and the On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has been rising. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is about to turn to the upside for a new outright go long signal.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of XLF, below, we can see that prices and the indicators are turning upward. Prices are above the rising 40-week moving average line.\n\nThe weekly OBV line is starting to improve and the MACD oscillator is above the zero line and new price strength should generate a new buy signal from this oscillator.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of the XLF, below, we can see that a trade at $28.65 is a breakout and the $32-$33 area is our first upside price target.\n\nBottom-line strategy: You could dig down and find the strongest looking stock in the XLF or you could just go long the XLF here. Risk a close below $27 for now and look for the mid-$30s as our first upside price target.", "description": "Financials Are Finally Ready for an Upside Breakout...XLF", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Financials Are Finally Ready For An Upside Breakout", "Dig Down For Some 'Diamonds.'", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "James", "Rev Shark", "Jim Cramer", "Bob Lang", "Carolyn Boroden", "Doug Kass"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/2c0f9724-fd36-11e7-a14a-bb1225ed741d.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
