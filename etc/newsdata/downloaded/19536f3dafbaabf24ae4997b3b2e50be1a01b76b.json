One of them openly complained to Pravda: \u201cWhat are we to do at home if the wife is in the factory, the children in school, and no one can come to see us? What is left but to go to the public tea room? What kind of life is that\u2014when holidays come in shifts and not for all workers together? That\u2019s no holiday, if you have to celebrate by yourself.\u201d\n\nThe staggered workweek didn\u2019t last long. Officials worried that it affected attendance at workers\u2019 meetings, which were essential for a Marxist education. In 1931, Stalin declared that the nepreryvka had been implemented \u201ctoo hastily,\u201d leading to a \u201cdepersonalized labor process\u201d and the mass breakage of overtaxed machines. That year, the government added a day of collective rest. The seven-day week was not restored until 1940.\n\nExperiments like this one have given social engineering a bad name. Nevertheless, Americans are imposing a kind of nepreryvka on ourselves\u2014not because a Communist tyrant thinks it\u2019s a good idea but because the contemporary economy demands it. The hours in which we work, rest, and socialize are becoming ever more desynchronized.\n\nWhereas we once shared the same temporal rhythms\u2014five days on, two days off, federal holidays, thank-God-it\u2019s-Fridays\u2014our weeks are now shaped by the unpredictable dictates of our employers. Nearly a fifth of Americans hold jobs with nonstandard or variable hours. They may work seasonally, on rotating shifts, or in the gig economy driving for Uber or delivering for Postmates. Meanwhile, more people on the upper end of the pay scale are working long hours. Combine the people who have unpredictable workweeks with those who have prolonged ones, and you get a good third of the American labor force.\n\nThe personalization of time may seem like a petty concern, and indeed some people consider it liberating to set their own hours or spend their \u201cfree\u201d time reaching for the brass ring. But the consequences could be debilitating for the U.S. in the same way they once were for the U.S.S.R. A calendar is more than the organization of days and months. It\u2019s the blueprint for a shared life.\n\nRemember the old 9-to-5, five-day-a-week grind? If you\u2019re in your 30s or younger, maybe not. Maybe you watched reruns of Leave It to Beaver and saw Ward Cleaver come home at the same time every evening. Today few of us have workdays nearly so consistent. On the lower end of the labor market, standing ready to serve has become virtually a prerequisite for employment. A 2018 review of the retail sector called the \u201cStable Scheduling Study\u201d found that 80 percent of American workers paid by the hour have fluctuating schedules. Many employers now schedule hours using algorithms to calculate exactly how many sets of hands are required at a given time of day\u2014a process known as on-demand scheduling. The algorithms are designed to keep labor costs down, but they also rob workers of set schedules.", "description": "Our unpredictable and overburdened schedules are taking a dire toll on American society.", "authors": ["Judith Shulevitz", "Author Of"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/2019/09/DIS_Lead_FriendsGone/facebook.jpg?1569423728", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
