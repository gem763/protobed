I competed against them, although I haven\u2019t won every time. I\u2019ve lost more than I\u2019ve won but I always went out onto court feeling I could win,\u201d Murray told Sky Sports.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019d enjoy going out on court against them knowing I\u2019m going to lose or feeling like I had no chance. That would probably be psychologically challenging... I need to be patient and not expect too much too soon.\n\n\u201cBut maybe in four or five months, I can get there. In terms of how I\u2019m hitting the ball in practice... the skill is still there. I physically need to get a little better and hopefully over time I get a little bit faster... I think I will.\u201d\n\nMurray is hopeful of being picked in Britain\u2019s Davis Cup team for the Nov. 18-24 Finals in Madrid, adding he would be happy playing only doubles if necessary.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m selected I\u2019ll play. I don\u2019t want to play or be selected just because four years ago I played really well,\u201d Murray, who guided Britain to the title in 2015, added.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to help and be in the team and play singles, but if I was asked to play doubles I\u2019d probably do that.\u201d", "description": "Former world number one Andy Murray said he still needs four or five months to play top-level tennis so that he can again take on old rivals Roger Federer and Rafa Nadal after career-saving hip surgery earlier this year.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429348748&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C0HP", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
