The evangelical church's website describes him as its \"lead pastor, founder and visionary\".\n\nIt's hard not to draw parallel with another famous son of Ballymena.\n\nLike the late firebrand founder of the Free Presbyterian Church, Ian Paisley, Pastor Jeff set up the Church from scratch.\n\nImage copyright PAcemaker Image caption Newly unemployed Wrightbus workers hung their work shirts outside Green Pastures church in Ballymena at a protest last Sunday\n\nJeff Wright has described Green Pastures as \"a place of refuge for the thousands of people that need, as I did, to find Jesus\".\n\nThe Church has been praised for its community work: Its charity, Connect, is known for helping the vulnerable and partners with the Ballymena Foodbank.\n\nIt is perhaps not surprising that in Northern Ireland, a society drawn so much on religious lines, that the Church's plans to create its own self-contained village were approved.\n\nBought in 2012, the 100-acre site beside the A26 outside Ballymena is impossible to miss.\n\nWhen finished, The Gateway aims to offer social housing, shops, a hotel, riverside restaurants, an education centre and a nursing home.\n\nThe project has been dogged by complaints from local shopkeepers about its impact on local business.\n\nThe plans were scaled back in 2015, with a proposed supermarket being scrapped.\n\nBut how The Gateway - and Green Pastures - will be affected by Wrightbus's future remains unclear.\n\nGod the shareholder\n\nThe Wright family says the collapse of the business was due to a fall in demand for buses.\n\nBut some workers have expressed concern that money donated to the Church weakened the business.\n\nImage copyright Pacemaker Image caption Wrightbus founder Sir William Wright was applauded by protesters in Ballymena\n\n\"We made God a shareholder in the business - 26% of Wrights is owned by an evangelical trust - in order to make sure He was central in everything the Wrights company does,\" the pastor told the Irish Times in 2017.\n\nGreen Pastures received \u00a315m in donations from The Wrightbus Group over six years.\n\nIn 2016-2017, about \u00a34m was donated to the Church by the Wright Group's parent firm, the Cornerstone Group Ltd, which reported a pre-tax loss of \u00a31.73m in the same financial reporting period.\n\nOne local source, who did not wish to be named, said: \"It's one thing to give money to the Church in boom times but why when it was losing money?\"\n\nThere have also been suggestions a potential deal to save the company was stymied by an expensive leasing clause.\n\nThe Wrightbus factory is owned by a separate firm, Whirlwind Property Two, which is controlled by Jeff Wright.\n\nIt is understood that potential buyers were being asked for about \u00a31m a year to lease the property.\n\nThe family denies acting unreasonably during attempts to sell the business, and negotiations are continuing in a bid to save the company.\n\nThey say one bidder had agreed to lease the property before withdrawing the offer.\n\n'My beautiful wife'\n\nIn Sunday 29 September's sermon, Jeff Wright defended his management of Wrightbus and rejected any accusations of wrongdoing.\n\nImage caption Some workers have expressed concern that donations to the church weakened the business\n\n\"I have my faults and many many failings and had many mess ups - just ask my beautiful wife,\" he told a packed congregation at Green Pastures.\n\n\"But it seems strange to me: why I would jeopardise 74 years of blood sweat and tears to make the company great and even see my own son (and) the fourth generation of Wrights lose their inheritance?\"\n\nMr Wright said those who criticised him did not know him.\n\n\"I have learnt from dad there is a time to speak and a time to be silent, especially since there are still some great people working very, very hard to not just keep the delicate negotiations alive but also to try to bring a new investor to the table.\"\n\n'Nowhere to go'\n\nAs he spoke, accompanied by a softly playing pianist, a different narrative was playing out metres away.\n\nHundreds of people were protesting outside the church - and they are angry.\n\nOne former Wrightbus worker said they were there because they had \"nowhere to go, nobody to see\" and they wanted answers.\n\nWhile protestors waved signs and placards daubed with allegations about Jeff Wright, the mood towards the company was not all negative.\n\nSir William Wright was applauded as he stopped to speak to some of the protesters on his way into the church.\n\nEven amid the social media outrage, there was little criticism of the 92-year-old.\n\nHis grand-daughter, Fiona Knowles, stood in solidarity with workers outside the church - and suggested there were divisions in the family.\n\n\"Our family has been destroyed by this and it could have been avoided,\" she said.\n\n\"It is hard to watch, when you watch your granda who has built this place up since he was 16, to have it destroyed, it is very hard to watch.\"\n\nLocally, Jeff Wright is much more associated with Green Pastures than he is with the company, says Dessie Blackadder, the editor of the Ballymena Guardian.\n\nYet it was Jeff Wright's name that features most prominently on the protest placards.\n\nPastor Jeff recently posted a quote attributed to Abraham Lincoln on his Facebook page.\n\n\"My concern is not whether God is on our side; my greatest concern is to be on God's side, for God is always right.\"", "description": "BBC News NI profiles the scion of the Wrightbus dynasty, a self-proclaimed \"pastor and visionary\".", "authors": ["Amy Stewart", "Bbc News Ni"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/160BF/production/_109030309_wrightbus_green_pastures_jeff_wright_2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
