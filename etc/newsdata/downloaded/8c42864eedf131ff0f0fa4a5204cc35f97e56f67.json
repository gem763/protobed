Regarding 737 Max Jet", "language": "en", "text": "A Boeing pilot who tested the 737 Max jet in flight simulators in 2016 admitted in a series of text messages that he lied to the Federal Aviation Administration regarding the plane\u2019s performance.\n\nThe text messages, reviewed by the New York Times, show that the lead technical pilot for the plane, Mark Forkner, was having trouble with an automated flight system known as MCAS. Malfunctions with MCAS caused two 737 Max jets to crash, killing a total of 346 people.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s running rampant in the sim,\u201d Forkner wrote to a colleague, referring to the simulation. \u201cGranted, I suck at flying, but even this was egregious.\u201d\n\nEight months prior to the messages, Forkner had asked the F.A.A. to remove the MCAS from the 737 Max pilot\u2019s manual. The F.A.A. approved the request, believing the system didn\u2019t present a danger.\n\n\u201cI basically lied to the regulators (unknowingly),\u201d Forkner texted.\n\nBoeing had provided transcripts of the texts to the Justice Department earlier this year as part of a criminal investigation. The transcript was provided to Congress on Friday in advance of hearings this month at which Boeing chief executive Dennis A. Muilenburg is scheduled to testify on the crashes for the first time.\n\nForkner and Boeing did not immediately comment on the report.\n\nF.A.A. Administrator Steve Dickinson castigated Boeing for not providing the messages to the F.A.A. at an earlier stage.\n\n\u201cI expect your explanation immediately regarding the content of this document and Boeing\u2019s delay in disclosing the document to its safety regulator,\u201d Dickinson wrote.\n\nIn March 2019 world aviation authorities grounded the 737 Max after two of the planes crashed within five months. Lion Air Flight 610 took off from Jakarta, Indonesia in October 2018 and crashed 12 minutes later, while Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 left Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in March of this year and crashed six minutes after takeoff.\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "A Boeing pilot who tested the 737 Max jet in flight simulators in 2016 admitted in a series of text messages that he lied to the Federal Aviation Administration regarding the plane's performance.The text messages, reviewed by the\u00a0New York Times, show that the lead technical pilot for the plane, Mark", "authors": ["Zachary Evans"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/EICDpIq9sUB5ZcMfeTyNng--~B/aD01OTc7dz0xMDIzO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/7720ed69108029eebbbf89e5c9a27603", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
