An impasse over the border wall led to a 35-day partial government shutdown early this year. After it ended, Trump used emergency powers to raid military construction accounts to fund the wall.\n\nWall Money\n\nWhen Shelby floated the idea of a stopgap bill until February, he said impeachment would \u201ctake the oxygen\u201d out of the Capitol. But Democratic Representative David Price, a member of the Appropriations panel, said Trump\u2019s continued demand for money to build a border wall is the problem.\n\n\u201cShelby can blame impeachment all he wants but it is their allocations that is standing in the way,\u201d Price of North Carolina said. \u201cIf not for this wall issue we could get this done tomorrow.\u201d\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell are said to oppose a long stopgap in order to try to force a spending deal sooner. Hoyer wrote to McConnell on Tuesday to urge immediate talks on spending.\n\nRepublicans want to replenish the $7 billion in military funds that Trump redirected toward construction of the border wall, and Democrats say they won\u2019t refill those accounts without provisions to guard against future shifting of funds. Senate Republicans also are seeking $5 billion in new money for the wall.\n\nThis already delicate negotiation is further complicated by the impeachment process that has enraged Trump and heightened partisan acrimony on Capitol Hill.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles Schumer said Tuesday he was worried that Trump could use the Nov. 21 deadline to provoke a shutdown to distract from impeachment.\n\n\u201dI\u2019m increasingly worried that President Trump will want to shut down the government again because of impeachment,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cHe always likes to create diversions.\u201d\n\nShutdown Fears\n\nRepublicans and Democrats in Congress say they don\u2019t want another government shutdown, although they also said that when government funding ran out at the end of 2018. The Senate and the House, both led by the GOP at the time, were on the brink of a deal in December when Trump persuaded House Republicans to hold out for wall funding.\n\nThe House has already passed its 12 appropriations bills, and the Senate this week is on track to pass a package of four spending bills that would fund Interior and Environment; Commerce, Justice and Science; Transportation, Housing and Urban Development; and Agriculture. This Senate measure would need to be reconciled with the House versions to become law.\n\nThe most important thing for spending committee leaders is to agree on the topline allocation of spending for all government agencies. Senate Democrats say they\u2019ll block debate on the annual Defense spending bill, the top GOP priority, until they reach a deal on total allocations.\n\n\u201cThis week will bring a litmus test: are Washington Democrats so concerned by impeachment that they cannot even fund our men and women in uniform?\u201d McConnell said Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine a more basic legislative responsibility than funding the Department of Defense.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Jack Fitzpatrick.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Erik Wasson in Washington at ewasson@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Joe Sobczyk at jsobczyk@bloomberg.net, Laurie Ass\u00e9o\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Democrats and Republicans in Congress are deliberating whether to push the deadline to fund the government into early February to avoid having a budget fight amid an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump that\u2019s set to stretch at least into December.That would mean enacting another", "authors": ["Erik Wasson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Rt0ve8MCvnlRDPkY2BAnow--~B/aD0xMjg4O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/40fd63c8d0df90d81de4e3a310a07c72", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
