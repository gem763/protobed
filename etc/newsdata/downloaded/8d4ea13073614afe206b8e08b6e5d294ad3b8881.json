Howe Institute report argues.\n\nThe report, which is set to be released Thursday, notes Canadians are increasingly opting to invest their savings in securities over deposits. However, the ensuing demand for investment advice has prompted restructuring and consolidation in the industry, which has led to firms dealing with multiple regulators.\n\nTwo self-regulators \u2014 the Mutual Fund Dealers Association of Canada and the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada \u2014 held \u201cserious\u201d merger talks in 2011, the report notes, but the discussions fell apart over concern for smaller mutual-fund firms.\n\nNow, however, the multiple regulatory model has become \u201cstale,\u201d according to report author Joanne De Laurentiis, a senior fellow at the think-tank and a board member of the Financial Services Regulatory Authority of Ontario.\n\n\u201cThe conditions to create a merger are there,\u201d De Laurentiis told the Financial Post. \u201cThe industry has been consolidating. The regulators have been harmonizing the rules. The consumers are looking for more holistic advice; they want their adviser to be able to move along the regulatory structure to give them whatever they may need.\u201d\n\nIn 1994, Canadians held 53 per cent of their wealth in deposits and just 16 per cent in investment funds, the report notes. But in 2014, it says funds overtook deposits, and that by 2024, the fund-to-deposit ratio is projected to be 38 per cent to 25 per cent. Meantime, it\u2019s estimated that 42 per cent of Canadians are turning to a financial adviser for help with investment decisions.\n\nThe shift sparked the creation of a separate class of adviser who sell only mutual funds and are overseen by a separate self-regulator, the MFDA. This created overlap as mutual fund dealers and advisers sought to expand their offerings into territory overseen by IIROC, such as the sale of exchange-traded funds.\n\nWhile increasing regulatory costs are typically the argument for reform, the report says a better measuring stick would be to check whether the regulatory framework is structured properly for an industry and clientele that have evolved.\n\n\u201cWhen measured against that test, it is clear there are too many regulatory cooks in the kitchen,\u201d it states. \u201cThe organizations that oversee investment advice have become overly structured and complex with overlapping roles applying differing standards when enforcing compliance.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, the MFDA and IIROC boards could decide to merge without having to seek approval from securities regulators. The new agency could also address the previous concerns for smaller mutual-fund firms with \u201cfit-for-purpose\u201d rules.\n\n\u201cSuch an initiative would remove operational complexity and costs for dealers; streamline and bring greater efficiency to the regulatory oversight process; and give advisers the flexibility to grow and expand to respond to their clients\u2019 financial service needs as they move through their life-stages,\u201d the report says.\n\n\u2022 Email: gzochodne@nationalpost.com | Twitter: GeoffZochodne", "description": "Organizations are 'overly structured and complex with overlapping roles applying differing standards'", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/agettyimages-933321056.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
