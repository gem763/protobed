After blocking an alliance with the party in the wake of last year\u2019s general election, he suddenly announced he was ready to team up with his arch-foes in order to prevent Matteo Salvini\u2019s far-right League party from surging to victory in a fall election.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a service I\u2019m doing to the country and my effort to lend Europe a helping hand at a time when a disastrous Brexit is looming and the German economy has stalled,\u201d Renzi told POLITICO in an interview while on a high-speed train running between Florence and Rome.\n\nHis volte-face knee-capped Salvini, one-upped his successor at the helm of the PD, Nicola Zingaretti, and put the 5Stars in a position of having to choose between holding onto power and their anti-establishment credentials.\n\n\u201cHis knight\u2019s jump suddenly re-opened games that looked like they were over,\u201d wrote the Italian daily La Stampa.\n\nRenzi\u2019s Machiavellian move puts him in a win-win situation \u2014 able to claim credit for stopping Salvini but also in a position to dominate Italian politics should the new government start to fall apart.\n\nThe game changer\n\nBefore Renzi\u2019s chess move, Salvini and Zingaretti were both ready to head for elections.\n\nFor the League leader, who pulled the plug on his nearly 1-year-old coalition with the 5Stars in August, it was a chance to consolidate a surge of support after a standout performance in the European Parliament election.\n\nHaving doubled his party\u2019s share of the vote to 34 percent in less than a year, Salvini stood a good chance of being able to govern alone or with the support of a small, further-right party \u2014 creating a far-right government at the heart of the EU and putting him in a strong position to dictate the country\u2019s choice of president in 2022.\n\nFor Zingaretti, an election offered the opportunity to get full control of his party by ridding himself of the lawmakers still loyal to Renzi, which make up the bulk of the PD\u2019s presence in parliament.\n\nThe 5Stars, led by Luigi Di Maio, on the other hand, were desperate to avoid a return to the ballot box. The party had lost nearly half of its support since the last general election, and most of its parliamentarians faced term limits due to internal party rules.\n\nA coalition government featuring the PD and 5Stars seemed unthinkable \u2014 mostly because of Renzi, who spent the year answering suggestions for such an alliance with a tweet hashtagged #senzadime\n\n(#withoutme).\n\nMeanwhile, Beppe Grillo \u2014 the founder of the 5Stars and the party\u2019s spiritual head \u2014 had spent years launching insults at Renzi (\u201cfalse,\u201d \u201chypocritical,\u201d \u201clittle moron,\u201d \u201cfriend of the bankers,\u201d \u201csuffering from penis envy\u201d).\n\nRenzi, for his part, has wasted no time positioning himself as one of the government\u2019s outside critics.\n\nYet Renzi\u2019s abrupt announcement, made in an interview in newspaper Corriere della Sera on August 11, that he was ready to reverse his position on the 5Stars changed the game entirely.\n\nSalvini was forced to crawl back to the 5Stars in an unsuccessful attempt to pull the government back from the brink, while Zingaretti had to reluctantly give his assent for an alliance with the 5Stars or risk losing control of his group in parliament.\n\nAnd Grillo and Di Maio, facing a huge defeat if an election were to be held, made humiliating U-turns of their own, embracing the PD after having scapegoated them for years.\n\n\u201cFor me, an alliance with the 5Stars is an enormous sacrifice,\u201d said Renzi. \u201cI\u2019m doing it just to send Salvini home and save Italy\u2019s economy. Given the current European context, I believe it\u2019s important to strengthen the EU, but as long as Salvini is around, Italy will be irrelevant.\u201d\n\nThe migration question\n\nItaly\u2019s new government will be fronted by Giuseppe Conte, the same prime minister who led the coalition between the 5Stars and the League, earning during his year in office the appreciation of figures as wide apart as U.S. President Donald Trump and European Council President Donald Tusk.\n\nThe former law professor, who once said he had traditionally voted for the center left, has swiftly moved his positions to the left, jettisoning in his proposals for the new government Salvini\u2019s hard-line position on migration as well as the League leader\u2019s proposal for a flat tax.\n\nRenzi, for his part, has wasted no time positioning himself as one of the government\u2019s outside critics, launching small grenades at Conte even as he prepares to support him in the vote of confidence needed to create the government.\n\n\u201cI have a very negative opinion on his work as prime minister with Salvini and Di Maio,\u201d Renzi said. \u201cBut I will give him credit for having changed his mind on Salvini.\u201d\n\nITALY NATIONAL PARLIAMENT ELECTION POLL OF POLLS\n\nFor more polling data from across Europe visit POLITICO Poll of Polls.\n\nOne of the alliance\u2019s first major tests will be striking a balance on migration, moving away from Salvini\u2019s angry assaults on NGOs saving migrants in the Mediterranean, while keeping pressure on Brussels to forge policies that take the pressure off Italy.\n\n\u201cOf course, EU rules on migration need to be revised, of course we need a Marshall Plan for Africa,\u201d Renzi said. \u201cIt\u2019s foolish to think we can welcome everyone, but surely everyone must be rescued at sea.\u201d\n\nThe new alliance could also pave the way for the 5Stars to join one of the groups in the European Parliament, such as Renew Europe or the Greens, which so far have rejected them because of their partnership in government with the League.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s a positive aspect in this whole story it is that the 5Stars are reviewing their [Euroskeptic] positions to the point that their most moderate MEPs are negotiating with En Marche to join Renew Europe,\u201d said Renzi. \u201cThis is only possible because they kicked out Salvini.\u201d\n\nA 5Stars official denied that discussions with En Marche, the party of French President Emmanuel Macron, are taking place.\n\nDemolition\n\nThere\u2019s another possible implication of Renzi\u2019s sudden comeback: that in the long term, he and his lawmakers could abandon the PD to set up their own centrist, liberal party.\n\n\u201cThe demolition man\u201d has never hidden his ambition to replicate in Rome what Macron did to the establishment parties in France.\n\nOne of Renzi\u2019s closest allies, Sandro Gozi, was elected in May as an MEP in France on Macron\u2019s Renaissance campaign list.\n\nGozi, who served as undersecretary of European affairs in Renzi\u2019s government, is among those who have to wait until Brexit to claim his seat the European Parliament. In the meantime, he\u2019s serving as an EU adviser to French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe.\n\nRenzi describes rumors of a break with Zingaretti as \u201cboring gossip.\u201d\n\nFor the PD, and Zingaretti in particular, Renzi\u2019s U-turn poses a big risk. Having been forced against his will to back the formation of a government, Zingaretti is now exposed to the possibility that Renzi and his parliamentary troops could abandon the party, leaving the PD leader in control of an empty shell that contains only a brand and very few seats.\n\nWhile Zingaretti describes the new government as one intended to last until the end of the parliamentary term in 2023, Renzi\u2019s initial proposal was for an alliance of convenience to pass the budget and prevent an automatic hike in VAT due to take place at the end of the year.\n\nWhispers in Rome have also suggested that Renzi will challenge Zingaretti for the PD\u2019s leadership, though this would require him to win a primary \u2014 a difficult proposition given that polls continue to put Renzi as one of the most unpopular politicians in the country.\n\nRenzi describes rumors of a break with Zingaretti as \u201cboring gossip.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe issue isn\u2019t where I\u2019m going,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s that this sacrifice makes sense only if it has a European scope and not just a domestic one.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWe need to work together [with the EU] on important reforms, the fiscal rules, on migration. The competition rules need to be revisited, we need European champions\u2026 In addition to Macron\u2019s leadership and that of [German Chancellor Angela] Merkel, there\u2019s a need for Italy, which will only be possible if we send Salvini home.\u201d", "description": "In helping to form a new Italian government, Matteo Renzi has put himself back in the center of his country\u2019s politics.", "authors": ["Jacopo Barigazzi", "Silvia Sciorilli Borrelli", "Alberto Mingardi"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/renzi1_350x235-1200x628.jpg"}
