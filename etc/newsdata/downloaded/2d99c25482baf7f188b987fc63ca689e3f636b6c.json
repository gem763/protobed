She is also the author of \u201cBuild Yourself a Boat,\u201d a debut collection of poetry that was recently included on the long list for a National Book Award. Ms. Felix\u2019s writings describe sexual assault, firsthand experience of abortion, and police violence, including poems about the trial of George Zimmerman, the man who shot Trayvon Martin.\n\nShould we be surprised about a link between the highest levels of our political world and our most acclaimed poetry? I don\u2019t think so \u2014 and I think we should get ready for more of it, because it\u2019s coming and we need it, desperately. Political rhetoric can be so mangled these days, as President Trump and his cronies alter our language for the worse, renaming white nationalists \u201cthe alt-right\u201d and calling journalism \u201cfake news.\u201c\n\nAnd there is still the longstanding problem of the apparatchiks who repeat the rote colorless verbiage (\u201cthe American people,\u201d for one) within our political sphere. The effect is of air trapped in a room where the windows are closed. We are being failed in so many ways, even with the language we communicate in, and by the predictable ways those in power can use and abuse it.\n\nMs. Felix and other poets like her are intertwining politics, public life and poetry to create works that vaunt over conventional language and avoid phrases that have lost meaning through overuse. This seems to make her a good fit to work for Senator Warren, who in her 2014 autobiography drew on poetic language and deployed melodious techniques of repetition. ( \u201cAnd there\u2019s my mother. She is in her slip and her stocking feet and she is saying, \u2018We will not lose this house. We will not lose this house. We will not lose this house .\u2019\u201d)", "description": "Political rhetoric has gotten dull and empathy fatigue has set in.
