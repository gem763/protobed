REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo\n\nEuropean stock markets opened lower as surveys of purchasing managers from France, Germany, and the euro zone came in weaker than expected. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 0.9%.\n\nThe euro fell 0.4% to $1.0966 after the German Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) release, its lowest in over a week against the dollar.\n\nGermany\u2019s DAX index hit its lowest level in nearly two weeks, down 1.35% after the euro zone data, while France\u2019s CAC 40 fell nearly 1%.\n\n\u201cConsidering that Germany already contracted in Q2, today\u2019s numbers effectively increase the risk of another negative quarter in Q3, which by definition would constitute a technical recession,\u201d said Marios Hadjikyriacos, investment analyst at XM.\n\n\u201cIt seems that the malaise in manufacturing \u2014 owed to trade and Brexit worries \u2014 has started to spread to the much larger services sector as well.\u201d\n\nEuro zone business growth has stalled this month, a survey showed on Monday, less than two weeks after outgoing ECB President Mario Draghi pledged indefinite stimulus to revive the bloc\u2019s ailing economy.\n\nThe recent switch back into support mode by top central banks including the U.S. Federal Reserve, the ECB and China\u2019s PBOC has swollen the amount of bonds trading at negative rates to a record of more $17 trillion.\n\nThe Bank for International Settlements in its latest report said the growing acceptance of negative interest rates - where investors effectively pay for the privilege of lending - has reached \u201cvaguely troubling\u201d levels.\n\nMSCI\u2019s All Country World Index, which tracks shares across 47 countries was down 0.25%.\n\nU.S. stock futures - earlier up 0.4% - fell after the PMI data in Europe. S&P 500 E-mini futures last traded flat.\n\nProtests in Cairo and other major cities against government corruption had forced the suspension of Egypt\u2019s main stock market on Sunday and the strains spilled into debt and foreign exchange as major trading centers like London began their week.\n\nIn the FX non-deliverable forward (NDF) markets, the Egyptian pound weakened to 18.36 to the U.S. dollar and widened the gap with the more managed spot FX rate, which was at 16.26 pounds.\n\nThe government\u2019s dollar-denominated bonds fell as much 3 cents in the dollar too.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think this will be a repeat of the Arab Spring,\u201d said Aberdeen Standard Investments\u2019 Kevin Daly. But apparently there will be more demonstrations scheduled for Friday so let\u2019s see how that pans out.\u201d\n\nTRADE CONCERNS\n\nMost Asian share markets slipped as investors waited for more clarity on U.S.- China trade talks.\n\nMSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.3%.\n\nOver the weekend, the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s office issued a brief statement characterizing the two days of talks with China as \u201cproductive.\u201d It added that a principal-level trade meeting in Washington would take place in October, as previously planned.\n\nChina\u2019s Commerce Ministry, in a brief statement, described the talks as \u201cconstructive\u201d, and said they had also had a good discussion on \u201cdetailed arrangements\u201d for the high-level talks in October.\n\nAdditionally, the United States removed tariffs from more than 400 Chinese products in response to requests from U.S. companies.\n\nDespite the improved tone, markets still remain unconvinced about the possibility of an imminent deal.\n\nInvestors were rattled by news on Friday that Chinese officials unexpectedly canceled a visit to U.S. farms this week following their two days of negotiations in Washington.\n\nIn the Middle East, news that five Yemeni civilians were killed in air strikes by the Saudi-led coalition further soured investor appetite.\n\nOil fell below $64 a barrel, reversing an earlier gain, pressured by the prospect of a faster-than-expected full restart of Saudi Arabian oil output and by fresh signs of European economic weakness.\n\nA source, briefed on the latest developments in the Sept. 14 attack on Saudi oil facilities, told Reuters Saudi Arabia has restored around 75% of crude output lost.\n\nBrent crude futures - the international benchmark for oil - fell 0.2% to $63.98 per barrel.\n\nU.S. crude oil futures fell 0.6% to $57.79 a barrel.\n\nFile Photo: Pedestrians wearing masks are reflected in an electronic board showing various stock prices outside a brokerage in Tokyo, Japan, February 26, 2016. REUTERS/Yuya Shino\n\nThe Pentagon has ordered additional troops to be deployed in the Gulf region to strengthen Saudi Arabia\u2019s air and missile defenses following an attack on Saudi oil facilities.\n\nMarkets will closely watch September manufacturing activity surveys due from the United States later in the day.\n\nIn currencies, the dollar gained 0.23% against a basket of currencies.", "description": "Global shares sank on Monday as weaker-than-expected economic data added to investor worries over the unresolved U.S.-China trade dispute's effects on the world economy.", "authors": ["Ritvik Carvalho", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1432936814&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M0WP", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
