But Democrats on the Intelligence panel still have the ability to block the requests.\n\nLater Tuesday, the House Judiciary Committee released a set of procedures for its impeachment hearings pursuant to the resolution. The procedures allow the president and his counsel to attend hearings, question witnesses and provide evidence.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe resolution is expected to hit the House floor on Thursday.\n\nAll but a handful of House Democrats have formally backed the impeachment inquiry since it was launched last month, meaning the resolution is likely to pass easily.\n\nBut those Democrats represent competitive swing districts and have been wary of impeachment from the start.\n\nAt least one, Rep. Jefferson Van Drew (D-N.J.), said Tuesday that he expected to vote against the resolution.\n\n\u201cIt's going down the impeachment road more. I've always said originally I wasn't for the impeachment hearing, that I thought it should just be an investigation. And I'm still in the same position, so why would I vote for something now that I said I wasn't going to vote for before?\u201d Van Drew asked.\n\nRep. Joe Cunningham Joseph CunninghamHouse to vote for first time on impeachment procedures Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian presses Congress for paid paternity leave Democratic lawmaker fires back after NRCC mocks him for getting marriage counseling MORE (D-S.C.), meanwhile, had avoided taking a position on impeachment up to now. But a spokeswoman confirmed Tuesday that he will vote for the resolution.\n\nThe other Democratic holdouts \u2014 Reps. Anthony Brindisi (N.Y.), Jared Golden (Maine), Kendra Horn Kendra Suzanne HornHouse to vote for first time on impeachment procedures Liberals keep foot on the gas on impeachment Here are the House Democrats who aren't backing Trump impeachment inquiry MORE (Okla.) and Collin Peterson Collin Clark PetersonHouse to vote for first time on impeachment procedures The Hill's Morning Report - Dem debate contenders take aim at Warren Here are the House Democrats who aren't backing Trump impeachment inquiry MORE (Minn.) \u2014 have yet to say how they\u2019ll vote.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe resolution is not meant to formally authorize the impeachment inquiry that is already ongoing, as Republicans and the White House had been demanding for weeks. Democratic leaders maintained that a vote was unnecessary because the committees already had subpoena power thanks to rules changes established when Republicans last held the House majority.\n\nBut the resolution does state that the relevant committees involved in investigating the Trump administration \"are directed to continue their ongoing investigations as part of the existing House of Representatives inquiry into whether sufficient grounds exist for the House of Representatives to exercise its Constitutional power to impeach Donald John Trump, President of the United States of America.\"\n\nDemocratic leaders stressed that the vote was needed for the transition from a closed-door series of witness depositions to the public stage of the inquiry.\n\nThe leaders of the committees involved in the impeachment process \u2014 Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff Adam Bennett SchiffJudge schedules hearing for ex-Trump aide who refused to appear in inquiry Top Republicans say impeachment resolution is too little too late Ex-Trump official's refusal to testify escalates impeachment tensions MORE (D-Calif.), Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel Eliot Lance EngelFormer White House official won't testify, lawyer says This week: House to vote on Turkey sanctions bill House leaders threaten contempt if former White House official defies subpoena MORE (D-N.Y.), Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler Jerrold (Jerry) Lewis NadlerOfficials say foreign governments should not investigate presidential political opponents Dem committee chairs blast Trump G-7 announcement Top Democrat holds moment of silence for Cummings at hearing MORE (D-N.Y.) and acting Oversight and Reform Committee Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney Carolyn Bosher MaloneyFormer White House official won't testify, lawyer says House leaders threaten contempt if former White House official defies subpoena House passes bill aimed at reducing rape kit backlog MORE (D-N.Y.) \u2014 said the resolution will prepare lawmakers for the public phase.\n\n\u201cThe evidence we have already collected paints the picture of a president who abused his power by using multiple levers of government to press a foreign country to interfere in the 2020 election. Following in the footsteps of previous impeachment inquiries, the next phase will move from closed depositions to open hearings where the American people will learn firsthand about the president\u2019s misconduct,\" they said in a joint statement.\n\nHouse Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries Hakeem Sekou JeffriesTop Trump administration officials hail al-Baghdadi raid but stress need for resolve in fighting ISIS Black lawmakers condemn Trump's 'lynching' remarks Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle mourn Cummings MORE (D-N.Y.) dismissed the notion that forcing all Democrats to go on the record about the impeachment process would put the most vulnerable members in a tough spot.\n\n\u201cThe overwhelming majority of the House Democratic Caucus are publicly on record supporting the impeachment inquiry,\u201d Jeffries said. \u201cThat doesn't seem to me to be a challenge.\u201d\n\nBut centrist Democrats were frustrated by the lack of advance notice or a coordinated message from leadership on why a vote was necessary, according to sources close to the moderate wing of the party.\n\nThose lawmakers had more consternation about the lack of a clear messaging strategy than about having to go on the record in a floor vote, given that most have already backed the inquiry. But it\u2019s not a vote they are especially eager to take, either.\n\n\"It's not something that some of the Blue Dogs really want to be dealing with,\" said Rep. Daniel Lipinski Daniel William LipinskiThe Hill's Campaign Report: Biden camp faces new challenges Booker endorses Lipinski challenger The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by National Association of Manufacturers - Trump defends Ukraine motives while attacking Biden MORE (D-Ill.), a former co-chairman of the group. \"They came here to get legislation passed and get things done.\"\n\nBrindisi, who hasn\u2019t yet said how he\u2019ll vote, also appeared to be caught off guard by the announcement of a floor vote.\n\n\"I was not ready to see a resolution come out,\" he said. \u201cI'd like to know what the rationale is for doing the resolution at this point in time. Is there some new information that members aren't privy to, that we should know before we vote on that resolution? That's a question I'm going to ask.\"\n\nVan Drew further questioned the wisdom of holding a vote as a way to counter GOP complaints about the process.\n\n\u201cThe Republicans very much want it. So if they very much want it, it would mean that they want to help us a whole lot and really think it's a good idea, or they think that it was going to put us in a tight spot,\u201d Van Drew said.\n\nHouse GOP leaders are urging their members to vote against the resolution. And White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham Stephanie GrishamPress: Baby Donald throws a temper tantrum House to vote for first time on impeachment procedures SE Cupp presses ex-GOP lawmaker on Trump tweet: 'Would you call me human scum?' MORE said that the resolution \"does nothing to change the fundamental fact that House Democrats refuse to provide basic due process rights to the Administration.\"\n\nThe procedural discussion over Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry came as a National Security Council official, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, gave the first direct account of Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with the Ukrainian president in which Trump pushed for investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden, a current front-runner for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, and his son Hunter Biden.\n\nVindman is also the first current White House official to testify in the impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe resolution further outlines the format for the upcoming public hearings, which will provide for extended time for questioning and allow committee staff to cross-examine witnesses.

Devin Nunes Devin Gerald NunesFormer Nunes staffer fueled Trump's Ukrainian corruption claims: report 10 top Republicans who continue to deny the undeniable A Republican Watergate veteran's perspective on a Trump impeachment MORE (Calif.), or committee employees are allowed to ask questions.\n\nThat would be a departure from the typical format of congressional hearings, in which members of each party alternate with five minutes of questioning.\n\nThe format is similar to how lawmakers on the three committees leading the impeachment inquiry have been conducting the depositions behind closed doors in a secure facility in the sub-basement of the Capitol for the past month.\n\nThe resolution also directs the House Intelligence Committee to issue a report on its findings and recommendations.\n\nCunningham framed his decision to back the resolution as a way to ensure transparency in the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that my colleagues from across the aisle have been requesting for weeks now, so I hope this affords them some satisfaction, and overall it\u2019s a good measure to shine some light on these hearings and make sure that we respect due process,\u201d Cunningham told The Post and Courier.\n\n\u2014Mike Lillis contributed.
