Each count carries a maximum 20-year prison term.\n\nTheir eldest daughter, Isabella Giannulli, 20, deleted her popular Instagram account late Wednesday just as reports surfaced that she received a formal letter from prosecutors that could lead to potential charges.\n\nThe Daily Mail reports that Loughlin\u2019s daughter received a letter of intent from federal prosecutors in Massachusetts in early April as part of the ongoing Operation Varsity Blues investigation. Last week, the Wall Street Journal also reported that several students had received \u2018target letters\u2019 from federal investigators in cases where the student may have been complicit.\n\nSeveral students whose parents are accused of buying or bribing officials to ensure their children\u2019s college admission have been suspended, but so far none have been criminally charged.\n\nThe Daily Mail, quoting an unnamed source, reported that Loughlin\u2019s daughter had received a letter. \u201cIt is a not-so-veiled threat. [The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Massachusetts] is making it pretty clear that they have evidence that very strongly suggests she knew of the illegal plot.\u201d\n\nLoughlin\u2019s younger daughter Olivia Jade, 19, who is also implicated in the ordeal, still has her very popular Instagram account up though she has not posted anything since Feb. 28.\n\nThis week the famous couple rejected a plea bargain that would have potentially kept them from serving jail time in exchange for a guilty plea. An associate of Loughlin told CNN that she felt she had to plead not guilty.\n\n\u201cLori doesn\u2019t understand why she\u2019s getting so much criticism for pleading not guilty,\u201d the friend told CNN. \u201cPeople must not realize that she had no choice. The plea deal has been taken off the table, and this is the only way they've been told she and Mossimo can avoid jail time and get another plea. They are hoping justice will prevail.\u201d\n\nFelicity Huffman, who is one of 13 parents accused in the scandal, did enter a guilty plea this week along with several other parents embroiled in the scandal.", "description": "The celebrity spawn deleted her popular Instagram account ahead of allegations she is under a criminal probe.", "authors": ["Barbie Latza Nadeau"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_374/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1555578563/GettyImages-1132901127_mczd6p", "published_at": "2019-04-18"}
