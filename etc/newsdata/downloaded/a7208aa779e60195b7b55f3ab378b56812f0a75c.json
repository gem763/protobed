A verdict is expected before Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi retires on November 17.\n\nHere is the order under section 144 issued yesterday. The order has been issued considering safety and security of Ayodhya and those visiting here as Govt\u2019s paramount concerns.

The final hearings will finish this week, with a verdict likely over the next few weeks.\n\nAt the court in New Delhi, Rajeev Dhavan, a lawyer representing a Muslim group, said the opposition Hindu groups had no evidence to claim ownership of the disputed land.\n\nMany Hindus believe the medieval mosque that stood there for 460 years was only built after the destruction of an earlier temple.\n\nModi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has campaigned on constructing a new temple on the site of the razed mosque.", "description": "Public gatherings, drones banned in northern Indian city, as Supreme Court prepares for verdict in coming weeks.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2017/12/5/f7feb283624947a3855798ed1b95c391_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
