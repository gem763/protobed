The 25-year-old driver of the truck remains in custody on suspicion of murder.\n\nIn Vietnam, the father of 20-year-old Nguyen D\u00ecnh Luong feared his son was among the dead.\n\nHe told The Associated Press he had not been able to reach him since last week, when he told his father he would join a group in Paris that was trying to reach England.\n\n\u201cHe often called home but I haven\u2019t been able to reach him since the last time we talked last week,\u201d Nguyen D\u00ecnh Gia said. \u201cI told him that he could go to anywhere he wants as long as it\u2019s safe. He shouldn\u2019t be worry about money, I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d\n\nHe said his son left home in central Ha Tinh province to work in Russia in 2017, then on to Ukraine. In April 2018, he arrived in Germany then traveled to France. He told his family that he wanted to go to the U.K.\n\nLuong\u2019s older brother, Pham D\u00ecnh Hai, said that Luong had a tattoo of praying hands on a cross on his right shoulder. The family said they shared the information with local authorities.\n\nThe Vietnamese Embassy in London said Friday that it contacted police about a missing woman feared to be one of the dead. An embassy spokesman said it was contacted by a family in Vietnam who says their daughter had been missing since the truck was found.\n\nThe BBC reported it had been in contact with six Vietnamese families who feared their relatives are among the victims. Relatives of 26-year-old Pham Tra My told the broadcaster they had been unable to contact her since receiving a text Tuesday night saying she was suffocating.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry mom and dad\u2026.My journey abroad doesn\u2019t succeed,\u201d she wrote. \u201cMom, I love you and dad very much. I\u2019m dying because I can\u2019t breathe \u2026. Mom, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d\n\nChina said it could not yet confirm the victims\u2019 nationalities or identities. There was speculation circulating online in Vietnam that the victims may have been traveling on false Chinese passports.\n\n\u201cThe police said that they were urgently carrying out the verification work and the identities of the victims cannot be confirmed at present,\u201d said Tong Xuejun, a Chinese consular official in London.\n\n\u201cWe hope the British side can verify the victims\u2019 identities as soon as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I want to stress is that no matter what their nationalities are, this incident is a huge tragedy which arouses attention of the international community to issues of illegal immigration.\u201d\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Chinese authorities were also seeking information from police in Belgium, since the shipping container in which the bodies were found was sent to England from the Belgian port of Zeebrugge.\n\nBritish police believe the truck and container took separate journeys before ending up at the industrial park. They say the container traveled by ferry from Zeebrugge to Purfleet, England, where it arrived early Wednesday and was picked up by the truck driver and driven the few miles to Grays.\n\nThe truck cab, which is registered in Bulgaria to a company owned by an Irish woman, is believed to have traveled from Northern Ireland to Dublin, where it caught a ferry to Wales, then drove across Britain to pick up the container.\n\nGroups of migrants have repeatedly landed on English shores using small boats to make the risky Channel crossing, and migrants are sometimes found in the back of cars and trucks that disembark from the massive ferries that link France and England.\n\nBut Wednesday\u2019s macabre find in an industrial park was a reminder that criminal gangs are still profiting from large-scale trafficking.\n\nThe tragedy recalls the deaths of 58 Chinese migrants who suffocated in a truck in Dover, England, in 2000 after a perilous, months-long journey from China\u2019s southern Fujian province. They were found stowed with a cargo of tomatoes after a ferry ride from Zeebrugge, the same Belgian port featured in the latest tragedy.\n\nIn February 2004, 21 Chinese migrants \u2014 also from Fujian \u2014 who were working as cockle-pickers in Britain drowned when they were caught by treacherous tides in Morecambe Bay in northwest England.", "description": "HANOI, Vietnam (AP) \u2014 More Vietnamese families came forward Saturday with information their relatives may be among the 39 people found dead in the back of", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
