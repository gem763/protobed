Barno, a retired Army lieutenant general and former top commander in Afghanistan . \u201cIt is a unique place in society where you have a white male who works for someone African-American 10 years older than you from a very different cultural background. He talks about the leveling experience of being in the military.\u201d\n\nIt was a theme that would stick, even after Mr. Buttigieg was honorably discharged in 2017.\n\nWhile in Afghanistan, Mr. Buttigieg spent many days gingerly making his way through Kabul on convoy security in a heavily armed Land Cruiser. \u201cI thought I was sent to Kabul for my experience in bureaucratic politics,\u201d he said, \u201cbut because I was rifle qualified, it was my ability to drive a vehicle with two long guns\u201d that got him that assignment he said. \u201cAt the end of the day my usefulness was as a driver more than an elected officer.\u201d\n\nThomas Gary, a senior petty officer at Naval Station Great Lakes near Chicago, who worked with Mr. Buttigieg before he became mayor, said he kept his politics low key. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know he was a Democrat until he won his primary for mayor,\u201d he said. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t something he advertised. I do remember when he was sworn in, I wanted to make sure we from the unit showed a little love for this accomplishment.\u201d\n\nMr. Buttigieg spent his down time in Kabul tooling around the base\u2019s cigar club, playing in a joint division fantasy football league and visiting Afghan orphanages. He would retreat back to his barracks late at night to make calls back to South Bend. \u201cI wanted to be a good enough officer so even my roommate had no idea what my day job was,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg said.\n\nGoogle made this wish unattainable. \u201cWhen I got there, I may have had more to prove to demonstrate that I was there to get the job done,\u201d he said.", "description": "On the Democratic debate stage Tuesday night, Mr. Buttigieg didn\u2019t brag about his military service, but he did outflank his rivals.", "authors": ["Jennifer Steinhauer"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/16/us/politics/16buttigieg-military-01/16buttigieg-military-01-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
