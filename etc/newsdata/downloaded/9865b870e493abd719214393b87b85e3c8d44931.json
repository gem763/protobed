Yes. Did I know what I was doing? Sort of. Was I hung out to dry by a bunch of gangsters and the Peruvian justice system? Absolutely.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018So why did I do it? Why did I jeopardise everything and bring untold heartache to my adored family for a few easy quid?\u2019\n\nMichaella said she moved to Ibiza aged 19 and quickly became immersed in the island\u2019s party lifestyle, even serving customers drugs with their drinks while working as a waitress.\n\nShe then came into contact with a \u2018cockney\u2019 drug dealer named Davey, and he offered her the opportunity to \u2018run\u2019 drugs in exchange for money.\n\nAt first, she refused, but wrote that that the idea must have become \u2018lodged\u2019 in her mind, as later, when he approached her again, she said yes.\n\nThe drugs were hidden in sachets (Picture: Rex Features)\n\nHowever, at first she was told she would be picking up the drugs in Barcelona \u2013 and when the destination changed to Peru, Michaella claims she didn\u2019t realise she would be leaving Spain.\n\nIn her book, which is being serialised in the Mail on Sunday, she said she had \u2018no idea\u2019 where Peru was and thought it was \u2018another Spanish town\u2019.\n\nHarry reveals he and William have 'good and bad days' as he addresses feud rumours\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until she got chatting to another passenger on her long-haul flight that it dawned on her she was going to South America.\n\nBefore the flight, she had been introduced to Melissa, who flew over to Peru the day before her.\n\nBoth women then collected the drugs, which were concealed inside 31 sachets of porridge oats and various local soya brands.\n\nMichaella spent two years in a Peruvian prison (Picture: AFP)\n\nMichaella described how they were instructed to visit some of Peru\u2019s most popular attractions and take photos, so that they could cover their tracks if quizzed at the airport.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe was told by Mateo, an associate of Davey, that \u2018nothing would happen\u2019 at the airport, as officials had been bribed to ignore anything suspicious.\n\nHe also promised her \u00a35,000 in exchange for the safe return of the drugs.\n\nHowever as soon as they arrived at the airport, Michaella realised the gravity of the situation she had put herself in, with armed guards and sniffer dogs on patrol.\n\nShe wrote: \u2018Davey\u2019s Colombian friend might have paid a few guards to turn a blind eye, but you\u2019d need to bribe the whole airport to get this amount through.\u2019\n\nThey tried at first to claim they had been forced to smuggle the drugs (Picture: AFP)\n\nHer suitcase then passed by the dogs and men armed with machine guns, and when neither moved she thought they had managed to get away with it.\n\nBut she then realised Melissa was being \u2018led by the arm into a room behind the check-in desk\u2019 with six men holding semi-automatic weapons following her.\n\nOver 11kg of cocaine was found in their suitcases, and both women were jailed for six years in December 2013.\n\nThey were released after two years, and Michaella has since gone on to give birth to two twin boys called Rio and Raphael.\n\nHer book will be published on October 31.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
