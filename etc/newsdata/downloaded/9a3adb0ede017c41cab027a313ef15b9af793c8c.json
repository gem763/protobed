It isn\u2019t dominated by one outstanding player, like Histro Stoichkov back in the day, or when I was in the team.\n\n\u201cWhat I like most about this Bulgarian team is their excellent spirit.\u201d\n\nBerbatov, previewing the game in his role as an ambassador for Betfair, picks out 22-year-old striker Kiril Despodov, on loan to Austria\u2019s Sturm Graz from Italian club Cagliari, as one player who could cause England problems.\n\n\u201cHe could hurt England with his speed and tricks on the ball, so England\u2019s defenders need to watch out for him,\u201d he said of the 2018 Bulgarian Footballer of the Year.\n\nDefeat at Wembley would leave Bulgaria\u2019s hopes of qualifying for the finals looking forlorn but Berbatov hopes Balakov is given time to turn around their fortunes.\n\n\u201cHe is a national legend,\u201d he said. \u201cI know him well and had the pleasure of playing with him for the national team. He only took over as coach this year, so it\u2019s too early to judge him, but I really want Balakov to succeed in the job.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a difficult qualifying group for Euro 2020 and, if the players give 100%, the fans can\u2019t ask for more.\u201d\n\nBulgaria have scored only two goals in their 10 clashes with England while Berbatov is one of only two Bulgarians to score at Wembley \u2014 a statistic he hopes will improve on Saturday.\n\n\u201cI would love for someone else to find the net. In my wildest dreams, I would like us to win it,\u201d the 38-year-old said.", "description": "Dimitar Berbatov believes Bulgaria will need a footballing miracle to beat England in their Euro 2020 qualifier against England at Wembley on Saturday but says the Balkan nation could hurt Gareth Southgate's side.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1426901757&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8513W", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
