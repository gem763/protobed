The just-hired SNL comedian has come under fire for humor routines using ethnic slurs and jokes degrading to women, gays and transgender people. (Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic for Clusterfest/Getty Images)\n\nJust hours after Shane Gillis got the career break of any comedian\u2019s dreams Thursday \u2014 a job on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d \u2014 his name began trending for all the wrong reasons.\n\nFreelance comedy journalist Seth Simons called attention on Twitter to a podcast Gillis recorded last year. The episode of \u201cMatt and Shane\u2019s Secret Podcast\u201d featured Gillis and co-host Matt McCusker using slurs against Chinese people, mocking their accents and making racist references to Chinatown.\n\nSoon, social media was brimming with examples of Gillis\u2019s questionable humor \u2014 material degrading to women, minorities, gays and transgender people.\n\nThe backlash was swift, even as it coincided with praise for another of SNL\u2019s three new hires, Bowen Yang, a Chinese American comedian and one of the very few performers of Asian heritage to appear on screen in the show\u2019s nearly 45-year history.\n\n\u201cIt took 45 years for @SNL to get an East Asian cast member and in that same year he\u2019ll be joined by someone who would have no problem calling him\u201d by a slur, actor Daniel Dae Kim commented on Twitter. \u201cGotta be a joke in there somewhere.\u201d\n\nSNL has not yet commented on the controversy. Gillis posted an apology on Twitter late Thursday. \u201cI\u2019m a comedian who pushes boundaries. I sometimes miss,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf you go through my 10 years of comedy, most of it bad, you\u2019re going to find a lot of bad misses. I\u2019m happy to apologize to anyone who\u2019s actually offended by anything I\u2019ve said.\u201d\n\n[SNL announces 3 new cast members for Season 45 \u2014 and there\u2019s already controversy]\n\nThe resulting backlash has placed the Mechanicsburg, Pa., native at the center of an ongoing debate about whether comedians should be held accountable for offensive material, onstage or off. It\u2019s an evolving litmus test that has ensnared even veteran comics such as Dave Chappelle, whose repeated jokes about transgender women have exhausted some of his most loyal fans. The Gillis controversy has also led to discussions about \u201ccancel culture,\u201d a term used to describe the rapid-fire frequency with which someone\u2019s past behavior can trigger social-media scorn and real-life fallout \u2014 and one that\u2019s being increasingly applied in comedy.\n\nFans of Gillis have defended his \u201cjokes,\u201d though a good deal of the material in question was presented not in a stand-up setting but on his podcast \u2014 blurring the line between comedy and conversation.\n\n\n\nBowen Yang, who also joined the cast this week, will be one of the few Asian American performers to appear on SNL\u2019s stage. (Alex Schaefer/AP)\n\nThe uproar evokes the controversy that unfolded in 2016 after an activist uncovered old racist tweets from Melissa Villase\u00f1or, a Mexican American comedian whose addition to the show that year had been widely celebrated. But the tweets from Villase\u00f1or, who will begin her third season when SNL returns Sept. 28, were from several years earlier. (Trevor Noah and Kevin Hart have both faced criticism over years-old tweets, in Hart\u2019s case leading to the loss of a high-profile gig hosting the Oscars.)\n\nBut some of the questionable humor that circulated Thursday was recorded as recently as last year. \u201ci can\u2019t believe shane gillis\u2019s present is resurfacing,\u201d stand-up comedian Myq Kaplan tweeted Friday. A deeper dive into his podcast archive reveals even more recent uses of homophobic and racist language. In a Sept. 2 episode, Gillis\u2019s co-host uses a homophobic slur to refer to Civil War soldiers. In another episode, dated July 30, the pair discuss privilege and political correctness.\n\nAt one point, McCusker talks about a white restaurant owner who faced protests after firing a black employee. McCusker notes the protesters \u201care mostly white people.\u201d \u201cOf course,\u201d Gillis chimes in. \u201cAnd ladies with, like, dreads that went to an Ivy League school. That\u2019s just what I see \u2014 usually a white dad is involved.\u201d\n\nGillis\u2019s tamer-by-comparison stand-up routine generally riffs on his small-town upbringing \u2014 and his culture shock after moving to cities including Philadelphia, where he was based for several years, and New York, where he currently lives. \u201cI took Skoal out of my mouth to come up here, and I didn\u2019t vote for Donald Trump,\u201d he jokes in a set posted recently to Comedy Central\u2019s YouTube page. \u201cThat makes me like the Nelson Mandela of Central Pennsylvania.\u201d\n\nThat perspective was a draw for Greg Godbout, who booked him for a headlining gig at Washington\u2019s DC Drafthouse last month.\n\nGodbout, president of the comedy club, had not listened to the podcasts that surfaced Thursday. But he said he booked Gillis in part because of videos he had seen online \u2014 including stand-up routines and a viral sketch about a MAGA hat-wearing firefighter who saves a family only to be grilled by a reporter in regard to his political leanings.\n\n\u201cGreat comics tell stories from their perspective,\u201d said Godbout. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes it fun to have such a variety.\u201d He declined to share details about the turnout at Gillis\u2019s show but said he was \u201cvery pleased with the crowd.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s genuinely very funny,\u201d said Godbout, while acknowledging that \u201cfunny is an opinion.\u201d\n\nAnd he would book Gillis again. \u201cTrue embracing of diversity means lots of voices,\u201d he said, noting that the venue employs numerous bookers to ensure different perspectives. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be able to book many comedians if I was worried about controversy,\u201d he added.\n\nBut at least one venue pointedly distanced itself from Gillis amid the fallout. The Good Good Comedy Theatre, in Philadelphia\u2019s Chinatown district, tweeted Thursday that its staffers \u201cwere very quickly disgusted by Shane Gillis\u2019 overt racism, sexism, homophobia and transphobia \u2014 expressed both on and off stage \u2014 upon working with him years ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve deliberately chosen not to work with him\u201d since then, they added.\n\nAfter Gillis\u2019s DC Drafthouse gig, he appeared on Counter Currents, a podcast that features interviews with the venue\u2019s headliners but is produced independently.\n\nToward the end of the occasionally raucous conversation, the topic turns to \u201ccancel culture.\u201d\n\n\u201cI gotta stop going on podcasts,\u201d Gillis concludes, as the show\u2019s co-hosts note that his \u201cdigital footprint\u201d might be \u201ctoo high\u201d and that \u201cthings do come back to haunt you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know, hopefully they don\u2019t,\u201d he replies. \u201cHopefully in the next couple of years, it stops.\u201d\n\nAndrew Ba Tran and Sonia Rao contributed to this report.", "description": "Hours after he was hired, Shane Gillis\u2019s podcast rants came back to haunt him.", "authors": ["Bethonie Butler", "Reporter Covering Television", "Pop Culture", "September At Pm", "Bethonie Butler Writes About Television", "Pop Culture For The Washington Post.
