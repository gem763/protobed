In addition to the \u201call white, all male\u201d chain of command at NBC, there was Weinstein himself, waging a war on all fronts.\n\nImage\n\nPart of the book is about Black Cube, the mysterious Israeli firm that Weinstein\u2019s team hired to conduct intelligence work, like compile dossiers on journalists (Kantor and Twohey\u2019s recent book, \u201cShe Said,\u201d recounts their experiences with the firm, too). Farrow learned about Black Cube when he started to receive leaks from two different sources. A Nissan Pathfinder he kept seeing in front of his home turned out to be a tail. He received multiple barrages of spam texts; he later learned that the texts were possibly connected to attempts to track his cellphone.\n\nBut Weinstein also cultivated an inside line to NBC itself. He would bark out the names of NBC\u2019s top brass so that his assistants would get them on the phone and he could start cajoling and bullying. At a Time magazine gala, Farrow learned that Noah Oppenheim, the president of NBC News, was sitting at a table with Weinstein.\n\nIn the book, the warning signs about Oppenheim start out small but ominous. Presented at one point with a considerable list of Farrow\u2019s findings, including a recording of Weinstein admitting to groping women against their will, Oppenheim wasn\u2019t entirely convinced. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s, you know, a crime,\u201d he told Farrow. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotta decide if it\u2019s newsworthy.\u201d (Farrow gets some sweet revenge by depicting Oppenheim as a slick yet pitiable figure; a running joke in \u201cCatch and Kill\u201d is how nobody likes the film \u201cJackie,\u201d a \u201cmorose biopic\u201d about John F. Kennedy\u2019s widow that Oppenheim wrote.)\n\nIt became clear to Farrow that NBC\u2019s chain of command was nervous about the story for reasons other than an excess of journalistic caution. He learned that the network had brokered at least seven nondisclosure agreements with women who brought complaints of discrimination or harassment at NBC. Weinstein might have known something about this too. In a phone call to Andy Lack, the chairman of NBC News, Weinstein griped that \u201cyour boy Ronan\u201d was digging up stuff from \u201cthe \u201990s\u201d and added: \u201cWe all did that.\u201d\n\nOne of the biggest revelations in \u201cCatch and Kill,\u201d revealed toward the end, is that a former NBC employee named Brooke Nevils says that the former NBC anchor Matt Lauer raped her, forcing her to have anal sex despite her repeated protestations that she didn\u2019t want to. Nevils describes what happened in exacting, upsetting detail. \u201cWhen she woke up,\u201d Farrow writes, \u201cblood was everywhere, soaked through her underwear, soaked through her sheets.\u201d\n\nNevils, like some of the other women Farrow spoke to, continued to have sexual encounters with the man she says assaulted her. She says she was frightened for her career; Lauer maintains that their relationship was \u201cconsensual.\u201d She told Farrow that after one encounter in Lauer\u2019s office when he demanded that she give him oral sex, she asked him, \u201cWhy do you do this?\u201d and he replied, \u201cBecause it\u2019s fun.\u201d", "description": "Farrow writes that NBC tried to shut down his reporting about sexual assault and harassment allegations against the Hollywood producer.", "authors": ["Jennifer Szalai"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/09/books/bookfarrow2/bookfarrow2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
