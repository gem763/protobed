In modern America, the debate raged throughout Jimmy Carter\u2019s presidency and more recently through the presidencies of Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. The debate now looms large for Donald Trump.\n\nNewsweek magazine labeled 1976 \u201cThe Year of the Evangelical\u201d because of Mr. Carter\u2019s openness about his faith. At the time, commentators claimed that conservative Christians had finally found \u201ca place at the table.\u201d The marriage of church and state seemed to have been consummated.\n\nThere are three camps in which contemporary Christians have assembled. In one, these Christians believe God is on the side of pro-life, \u201cvalues voting\u201d Republicans. This begs the question \u2014 is God on holiday when Democrats with different political views are elected?\n\nThe second camp composed of more politically liberal Christians believes Scripture has much to say about social justice. They tend to vote for Democrats, whether Christian or not, because those politicians advance their temporal agenda.\n\nCamp three (really a subset of camp one) ignores President Trump\u2019s history, language and behavior toward his political foes, believing he is God\u2019s choice, though he has said he doesn\u2019t feel the need to ask for God\u2019s forgiveness (a prerequisite Scripture teaches for becoming a Christian). Critics of this camp excoriate them for hypocrisy based on their attacks on Bill Clinton\u2019s character and behavior.\n\nWho is right? Each has a point, but none is entirely correct.\n\nFor non-Christians reading this column, knowing what believers think might help toward a better understanding of them. Better still are the instructions in Scripture, largely ignored or cherry-picked by all three camps when it comes to political power.\n\nOne verse states: \u201cLet every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God and those that exist have been instituted by God (Romans 13:1). That seems unequivocal.\n\nDoes \u201cevery\u201d mean every to my friends who believe in the \u201cinerrancy of Scripture,\u201d or only to conservative Republicans? Paul wrote this when he was under the authority of political dictators in Rome and the religious authorities of his day, which were unfriendly to him and to Jesus of Nazareth, to say the least.\n\nHow do conservative Christians reconcile what the writer of Hebrews says with their singular devotion to Republican presidents? \u201cObey your leaders and submit to them, for they are keeping watch over your souls, as those who will have to give an account. Let them do this with joy and not with groaning, for that would be of no advantage to you\u201d (Hebrews 13:17).\n\nHow many think President Trump, or any president, should be credited with keeping watch over their souls? And yet that\u2019s what it says.\n\nThere is a strong case to be made for Mr. Trump\u2019s support of many issues that in some cases can be defended biblically, including judges who are pro-life. However, one should be careful about overt devotion that supersedes where Christians are supposed to put their sole trust and faith. It was He who said, \u201cMy kingdom is not of this world,\u201d which is the ultimate declaration of where all power and authority lies.\n\nPerhaps instead of trashing politicians they don\u2019t like and revering other ones, politically conservative Christians should contemplate another powerful verse: \u201cI urge that petitions, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgiving be offered on behalf of all men, for kings and all those in authority, so that we may lead tranquil and quiet lives in all godliness and dignity. This is good and pleasing in the sight of God our Savior \u2026\u201d (1 Timothy 2:1-3).\n\nAgain, does \u201call\u201d mean all?\n\n\u2022 Cal Thomas, a nationally syndicated columnist, is the author of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Expiration Date: The Fall of Empires, Superpowers and the United States\u201d (HarperCollins/Zondervan, January 2020).\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
