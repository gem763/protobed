The people\u2019s princess! Lady Di! Icon of haircuts and sweaters! As alerted to us by Today, Crown actors Josh O\u2019Connor and Emma Corrin were photographed filming the series in Spain over the weekend as Prince Charles and Di, respectively, as they re-created a visit from the couple\u2019s 1983 royal tour of Australia. (Cheaper to shoot there than halfway around the world, we suppose.) Their wardrobes are replicas of what the duo wore when touring Uluru at Ayers Rock \u2014 right down to the khaki suit, windswept bangs, and dissolution-of-marriage-pending frowns.\n\nAs mentioned above, Corrin \u2014who amazingly got offered the part of Princess Diana fresh out of drama school \u2014 won\u2019t make her Crown debut until season four.
