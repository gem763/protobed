The remediation costs are the bigger problem and quantifying those is a positive for the sector,\" he said, adding that focus now shifts to bank earnings at the end of the month.\n\nANZ and National Australia Bank have already reported expected remediation costs to compensate customers for past wrongdoings.\n\nThe New Zealand benchmark advanced as much as 1.3 per cent and was set for its best session in nearly six weeks.\n\nSKY Network Television was the top gainer after signing a broadcast deal with some rugby unions, while Fisher & Paykel Healthcare hit a record high on upgraded guidance.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Stocks - [BENGALURU] Strength in miners and banks helped Australian shares rise for a third straight session on Monday, bolstered by signs of headway in trade talks between the world's two largest economies. .
