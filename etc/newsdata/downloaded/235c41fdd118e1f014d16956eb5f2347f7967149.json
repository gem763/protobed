The joey was one of the few survivors of the late-night slaughter in Tura Beach, a small community in the southern part of New South Wales.\n\n\u201cUntil you see it, you can\u2019t grasp the reality of it,\u201d said Green, who is now caring for three survivors. \u201cPeople were just horrified, and when we took the bodies away, seeing them on the back of the [utility vehicle] was heartbreaking.\u201d\n\nPolice said in a statement that they are looking for witnesses to the \u201cseveral acts of animal cruelty,\u201d which they believe unfolded between 10:30 and 11:30 p.m. Saturday.\n\nIt was soccer night, and many people were out drinking. In the midst of that revelry came the kangaroo massacre, as someone drove down residential streets and plowed into the animals. The vehicle may have had mounted spotlights, so the \u2019roos \u201cwould have stood there stunned\u201d before being mowed down, Green said.\n\nThe kangaroo is Australia\u2019s national animal and appears on its coat of arms. There is a large population in Tura Beach, where Green said they are beloved by locals.\n\n\u201cWhat fun could there be in this carnage?\u201d she asked. \u201cHow could it make a person happy?\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nThe creator of the labradoodle says he made \u2018Frankenstein\u2019s monster\u2019\n\nThe nation\u2019s largest captive alligator vanished in Imelda\u2019s flood, but Big Tex was just found\n\nNorth America has lost 3 billion birds in 50 years\n\nWild horses have long kicked up controversy.
