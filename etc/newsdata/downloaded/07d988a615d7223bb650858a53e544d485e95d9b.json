If they had said more bad words, even one more time, then maybe they would have stopped the game.\n\n\u2018We could have such a big punishment \u2013 and this is not good for Bulgarian football, because if players want to come here, they hear what is said and how people speak bad, and that is not good for anybody.\u2019\n\nWhen asked whether England\u2019s players had asked him to confront the fans, Popov replied: \u2018No. We are 11 v 11, it doesn\u2019t matter your colour, it\u2019s no problem, we are all the same, we are one big family in football.\n\n\u2018Only we, if we are together, can we stop these bad things. I don\u2019t want it to be like this, it\u2019s not good for our country. I don\u2019t feel good because we didn\u2019t play well, we lost 6-0 \u2013 and what happened was terrible.\n\n\u2018It must stop. In this country, we have a team like Ludogorets, who have players from every country. I never heard this sort of problem in the Bulgarian championship and I don\u2019t know why they did this, because many fans are supporters of English football.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018The fans were angry. We were 4-0 down at half time, they were very angry and were saying to me: \u2018don\u2019t speak to us.\u2019 But when you start to speak to them, they understand. I think in the second half it was better.\u2019\n\nRaheem Sterling was one of the England players targeted with abuse during the game in Sofia (Picture: Getty)\n\nBulgarian Football Union president Borislav Mihaylov resigned from his post on Tuesday following calls from the country\u2019s prime minister Boyko Borissov that he step aside in the wake of the shameful scenes in Sofia.\n\nUEFA have also initiated disciplinary proceedings against Bulgaria, charging them with \u2018racist behaviour\u2019 including chants and Nazi salutes, throwing of objects, disruption of a national anthem and showing replays on a giant screen.", "description": "Bulgaria captain Ivelin Popov has condemned the actions of his country's supporters after England players were racially abused during their 6-0 win in Sofia on Monday night.
