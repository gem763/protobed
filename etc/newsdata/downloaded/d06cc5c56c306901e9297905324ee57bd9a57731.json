'She is normally so organised. I don't know what to think. The police have confirmed she is missing \u2013 apparently the embassy is closed until Monday.\n\n'There doesn't seem to be any urgency. Her friend is still there as they were due to leave the island on Saturday, but she hasn't left because Amelia is missing.'\n\nAmelia, who saved for the trip for two years by working at Lloyds bank, set off on September 27 and flew first to Vietnam.\n\nKoh Rong, a small island some 130 miles from the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh, is popular with backpackers for its crystal waters and sandy coves.

I'm just in shock \u2013 she's never done anything like this before\u2026 she normally messages us every now and then, every time she got wi-fi.'\n\nFootage taken of missing British gap year student Amelia on the night she went missing has been released by her sister in a desperate attempt to help find her\n\nShe told the BBC: 'She's my best friend. We're like twins, she's literally my other half.'\n\nAmelia's brother Harry has also flown to Cambodia to help, calling on his Facebook friends to pray for his sister to turn up safe and well.\n\nIn a post before he took a flight from the US to Asia, he wrote: 'I've asked whoever might be up there to look after her for just another 20 hours and her big brother will be there as soon as I can be.\n\n'Thanks for everyone who's showed their support, especially to my family back home.'\n\nThe items in her bag included a small purse, several packs of over-the-counter medication, her mobile phone, a phone charger, headphones, bank cards, a watch, a lighter, a pen, a tourist SIM card, a small padlock, a nail file and a key ring\n\nRyan Harris, 18, a friend who Amelia met in Phnom Penh, told the BBC the gap-year student had always stuck with a group of other travellers they had joined up with.\n\nHe has since travelled by bus for 12 hours to Siem Reap, where he had been expecting Amelia to arrive.\n\n'Even if you go your separate ways after a few drinks, you see people again ten or 20 minutes' later,' he said. The Foreign Office is providing support to Amelia's family and officials are remaining in close contact with Cambodian police.\n\nOfficers from Sussex Police are said to have visited the family's home over the weekend to offer support.", "description": "Amelia Bambridge, 21, was last seen at a beach party late on Wednesday night on the Cambodian island of Koh Rong.", "authors": ["Richard Shears In Koh Rong", "Cambodia For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/01/20263098-0-image-a-42_1572226663154.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
