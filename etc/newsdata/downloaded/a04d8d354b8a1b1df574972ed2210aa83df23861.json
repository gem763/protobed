Officials at state-run oil company Saudi Aramco, meanwhile, gathered in what was referred to internally as the \u201cemergency management room\u201d at the company\u2019s headquarters.\n\nInterviews with at least a dozen Gulf and Western officials provide the most detailed account to date of the response by Saudi officials and state oil company Aramco to the most destructive strike on Saudi Arabia since it opened an offensive in Yemen more than four years ago. The attack knocked out more than half the kingdom\u2019s oil production, or almost 6 percent of global oil output.\n\nSaudi Arabia has said Iran was responsible, an assessment that U.S. officials share.\n\nIranian officials were unavailable to comment but Iran has denied involvement.\n\nYemen\u2019s Houthi movement, an ally of Iran battling a Western-backed, Saudi-led coalition has claimed responsibility. But Gulf diplomats and regional officials say they are skeptical of the claim given the sophistication of the attacks.\n\nThe Saudi energy ministry declined to comment on its response to the attacks. The government communications office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe attacks place pressure on both U.S. President Donald Trump and Saudi Arabia\u2019s day-to-day leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who have worked closely together to contain Iran\u2019s growing regional influence. Both nations have stressed the need for caution.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has described the attacks as \u201can act of war\u201d against Saudi Arabia, though Trump says there are options short of war. Iran has warned that any U.S. or Saudi military strike against the country would bring \u201call-out war.\u201d\n\n(Graphics on 'Strikes on Saudi oil disrupt global supply' - https://tmsnrt.rs/302z0Hm)\n\nMISSILES AND DRONES\n\nShortly after 3:30 a.m. local time on Saturday, 25 drones and low-flying missiles struck two of Saudi Arabia\u2019s largest oil facilities located in the east of the kingdom, according to Saudi officials.\n\nAmin Nasser, the chief executive of state-run Saudi Aramco, which owns the two plants, rushed to Aramco\u2019s emergency-response room at the company\u2019s headquarters in the oil-producing Eastern Province, where he was joined by other senior managers, according to several people briefed on the matter. There was a sense of shock at the scale of the damage, some of the people said.\n\nBy the time Aramco\u2019s team was dealing with the fires at the first site in Khurais, where more than 200 people were at the time, strikes were still hitting the facility, according to the company. More than a hundred contractors were immediately evacuated.\n\nA Saudi Aramco spokesman declined to comment on questions from Reuters about the company and the CEO's response to the attacks.\n\nSaudi officials believed Iran was responsible because the intensity of the attack was beyond the capability of the Houthi, but they wanted to gather evidence before going public with the claims, according to Gulf diplomats and regional officials.\n\nSaudi officials also spoke to their allies, in some instances requesting assistance with experts to help with the investigation and help in strengthening air defenses. On Saturday, Prince Mohammed provided Trump an update by phone, according to a U.S. official. Trump offered \u201chis support for Saudi Arabia\u2019s self-defense,\u201d according to the White House readout of the call.\n\nU.S. officials also quickly came to believe that the attack did not come from Yemen and that Iran was responsible, according to U.S. officials who briefed reporters. The Houthi had not struck that distance before or in such a \u201cprecise and coordinated fashion,\u201d said a senior administration official.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Saudi Arabia's newly appointed energy minister was in London when he learned in the middle of the night of the largest-ever attack on the kingdom\u2019s oil infrastructure.
