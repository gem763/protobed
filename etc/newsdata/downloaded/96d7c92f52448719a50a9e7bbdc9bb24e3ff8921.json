In a separate statement on Friday, the force said: \u201cAs our investigations continue, the picture may change regarding identification.\u201d\n\nWhile the police have not yet confirmed the identities of those in the trailer, the family\u2019s fears highlight the difficulties in obtaining information on trafficked individuals.\n\nIn the message to her mother, feared to have been sent in her final moments, the 26-year-old wrote that she was struggling to breathe and apologised.\n\nThe message, translated into English by a family acquaintance, was received at 4.28am on Wednesday morning in Vietnam, a screenshot shows. This would have been 10.28pm UK time, when the trailer carrying the victims would have been in transit \u2013 and just four hours before the ambulance was called and the bodies were discovered.\n\nIn messages from an account nicknamed \u2018daughter\u2019, Pham wrote: \u201cI\u2019m sorry Mum. My journey abroad hasn\u2019t succeeded. Mum, I love you so much! I\u2019m dying because I can\u2019t breathe ... I\u2019m from Nghen, Can Loc, Ha Tinh, Vietnam ... I am sorry, Mum.\u201d One message has been blanked out because it mentioned the family\u2019s address.\n\nThe screenshot also shows that Pham has not accessed the account since Wednesday.\n\nA screenshot of Pham\u2019s last text, posted with permission from her family\u2019s contact. Photograph: Supplied\n\nThe Vietnamese embassy in London confirmed it had contacted police in regard to a missing woman feared to be one of the 39 people found dead.\n\nA spokesman for the embassy said it had been contacted by a family in Vietnam who claimed their daughter had been missing since the lorry was found.\n\nThe spokesman said: \u201cWe have contacted Essex police and we are waiting for an answer.\u201d\n\nThe BBC later reported that Pham\u2019s family had to pay \u00a330,000 to traffickers for her journey to the UK. A family acquaintance confirmed to the Guardian that Pham\u2019s family had to remortgage their home to pay the sum.\n\nTrafficked migrants are rarely on any kind of formal manifesto and victims\u2019 families may in some cases be in danger themselves if they acknowledge their disappearance. They may also fear that by going public they will put their loved one at risk of arrest if they are in fact still alive.\n\nMimi Vu, a leading expert on trafficking of Vietnamese young people to Europe and the UK, said the texts appeared to be authentic. \u201cShe writes her name and where she is from, which is very important, to tell people where she should be buried. It is important for the body to be returned to the place of birth,\u201d said Vu, who has been working in Vietnam on trafficking and slavery issues for the past seven years.\n\nVu noted that occasionally people were given false Chinese passports, if they were trafficked through China, which could lead to confusion.\n\nFollowing Pham\u2019s disappearance, her brother posted a message on a forum regularly used by Vietnamese people looking for missing relatives.\n\nHe wrote that Pham, who lived in the Nghen township in Can Loc district, left the rural province of Ha Tinh in northern Vietnam on 3 October before travelling to the capital, Hanoi, to \u201cfinalise her papers to go China\u201d.\n\nShe then flew to France and on to the UK, he said. However, she was allegedly arrested on arrival in the UK before being sent back to France.\n\nIn the post, her brother added: \u201cShe was arrested a few days ago by UK police and they returned her to France. Now we heard that she might have died. I am posting to ask for her whereabout and if you tell me your projection about her situation.\u201d\n\nHoa Nghiem, a coordinator at Human Rights Space, a civic network based in Vietnam, said she had spoken with a lawyer who was trying to help the family.\n\nShe said: \u201cThe girl\u2019s family got in touch with the lawyer \u2013 who has dealt with cases like this before \u2013 asking if she could help. They are desperate for any information about their daughter.\n\n\u201cThey just want any updates and have been posting on forums and speaking to the lawyer about getting help.\u201d\n\nNghiem said she knew of at least six Vietnamese families who were concerned that their relatives were among the 39 people found dead in the refrigerated container.\n\n\u201cThey lost contact with their family members who were travelling to the UK through China. They were worried if their family members could be in the truck,\u201d she added.\n\nThree of the families, all with missing sons \u2013 one born in 2004 \u2013 had been sent word that their loved ones would shortly arrive in Britain. \u201cThey said they received information that their family members were about to reach the UK on October 23, that they should be prepared to pay. But then the contact disappeared,\u201d Nghiem said.\n\nThe BBC reported that another 26-year-old woman who was smuggled via a similar route from Vietnam through China and onto Belgium had been forced to switch off her phone whilst in the container to avoid capture and her family had not heard from her since. The traffickers who arranged her journey had since returned some of the money back to her family.\n\nThe province of Ha Tinh is a hotspot for trafficking, with many immigrants travelling into China first obtaining a Chinese passport and then travelling on to Europe.\n\n\u201cI understand that we are getting to know more and more about similar situations. The province is known for sending people illegally to Britain. When they get to China they then travel on from there,\u201d added Nghiem.\n\nVietnam was the country with the third highest number of suspected victims of modern slavery in the UK in 2018, as identified by the national referral mechanism (NRM), the official framework for identifying victims of human trafficking and ensuring they receive the appropriate protection and support.\n\nThere were 702 Vietnamese modern slavery victims referred last year, behind 947 Albanians and 1,625 UK nationals.\n\nA 2012 government report assessing human trafficking routes highlighted a journey from Vietnam to UK that passed through China, Russia and northern or western Europe.", "description": "Vietnamese%20family%20fears%20daughter%20may%20be%20among%20Essex%20lorry%20victims%20%7C%20UK%20news%20%7C%20The%20Guardian", "authors": ["Https", "Www.Theguardian.Com Profile Nazia-Parveen Https", "Www.Theguardian.Com Profile Ameliagentleman", "Nazia Parveen", "Amelia Gentleman"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79b7663dea071e0fdfacc9bb4c988ae7a28a01d5/0_288_807_484/master/807.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ebaced3ad5d61c1ffe1ec8bcb65d9342", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
