We honor their service and mourn their loss not just on Memorial Day, but every day we live and work and raise our families in peace.\n\nWhat we don\u2019t understand is how the president of the United States could come to Dallas, as Donald Trump did last week, and call his recent betrayal of a loyal U.S. ally in the fight against Islamic State terrorists in northern Syria \u2014 the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) \u2014 \u201ctough love.\u201d\n\nWhat we don\u2019t understand is how he could compare the Turkish slaughter of our SDF allies \u2014 who lost more than 10,000 fighters in the past five years eradicating Islamic State strongholds in northern Syria \u2014 to a playground scrap: \u201cSometimes you have to let them fight like two kids in a lot,\u201d the president said. \u201cYou got to let them fight and then you pull them apart.\u201d\n\nWhat we can\u2019t fathom is how what Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called a \u201cgrave strategic mistake\u201d that will \u201cleave the American people and homeland less safe, embolden our enemies, and weaken important alliances\u201d could be called by the president of the United States a \u201cbig success.\u201d\n\nWhat we don\u2019t understand is how the president could say, \u201cLet someone else fight over this long-bloodstained sand\u201d even as a U.S.-brokered \u201cpermanent cease-fire\u201d provides political cover for Turkish troops and their proxies to continue slaughtering our erstwhile Kurdish allies.\n\nWhat we don\u2019t understand is how the president continues to claim he\u2019s sending the U.S. troops in northern Syria \u201cback home\u201d even as he\u2019s redeploying many of them to Iraq and Saudi Arabia and has shifted the U.S. mission in the region to protect oil fields and not in support of our allies.\n\nWhat we don\u2019t understand is an \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy that routinely puts our most trusted friends last and has put our brave fighting forces in the humiliating position of being pelted with rocks and vegetables by Kurdish civilians who feel abandoned and betrayed by the U.S. withdrawal.\n\nWhat we don\u2019t understand is how retired Navy Adm. William H. McRaven, a former commander of the U.S. Special Operations Command and one of the most respected military leaders in America, could write recently that among the military community he\u2019s witnessed a \u201ccurrent of frustration, humiliation, anger and fear,\u201d stemming from the widespread feeling that, \u201cThe America that they believed in was under attack, not from without, but from within.\u201d\n\n{\"unitName\":\"dfpPosition1\",\"display\":\"mobile\",\"isMobile\":false} hidden ad unit\n\nWhy do they feel this way? \u201cThey have seen our leaders stand beside despots and strongmen, preferring their government narrative to our own,\u201d McRaven explained. \u201cThey have seen us abandon our allies and have heard the shouts of betrayal from the battlefield.\u201d\n\nLike the president, we don\u2019t want our brave fighting men and women engaged in \u201cendless wars.\u201d But history has shown us what happens when the U.S. retreats into isolationism and abandons the very alliances that safeguard peace.\n\nOur post-9/11 obligations, to the Kurdish-led SDF and to our allies in Afghanistan\u2019s Armed Forces, are every bit as important as the postwar alliances formed in Europe and Asia after World War II.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason why we still have troops in Japan and South Korea and in our NATO partners\u2019 lands. We are there not merely to protect oil fields or trade routes, but to promote and defend U.S. interests, chief among them liberal democracy and human liberty. As McConnell said quite eloquently, \u201cAmerica\u2019s wars will be \u2018endless\u2019 only if America refuses to win them.\u201d\n\nWhat we don\u2019t understand is why Trump doesn\u2019t understand this.", "description": "In Texas, a state with more than 160,000 active-duty and reserve military personnel and 1.4 million veterans, we understand President Donald Trump\u2019s desire...", "authors": ["Dallas Morning News"], "top_image": "https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer//tlA6N7LVezEAGM-1Y1jJReFBcqc=/1200x630/smart/filters:no_upscale()/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-dmn.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ND36ICVFHOCDK67FAOWL5DAWXI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
