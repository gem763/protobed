Croft to the House of Representatives Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Committee on Foreign Affairs, and Committee on Oversight and Reform\n\nOctober 30, 2019\n\nThank you for the opportunity to provide my statement today.\n\nFor the last nine years, it has been my honor to serve my country as a\n\nForeign Service Officer. In that capacity, it has been a privilege to serve alongside colleagues of intelligence, integrity, and determination to advance U.S. interests, some of whom have already spoken to this committee. I am not sure that I have anything to add to the testimony of those who have come before me, but I will answer your questions to the best of my ability.\n\nMy work on Ukraine started in 2013, when I was posted to the U.S. Mission\n\nto NATO. My portfolio included NATO-Ukraine relations when the citizens of\n\nUkraine took to the streets to demand a European future and an end to corruption. When Russian tanks rolled into Crimea, I was assigned to NATO headquarters in Brussels. At the time, we did not know where those tanks would stop. Russia's aggression in Ukraine posed, and continues to pose, a real and immediate threat to our national interest in a Europe free, whole, and at peace.\n\nMy firm belief in the importance of Ukraine's future to U.S. national\n\ninterests led me to the Ukraine Desk. From August 2015 to July 2017, I was one of several Ukraine Desk Officers at State Department headquarters. In my portfolio, I focused on security assistance, arms sales, and defense reform. But like all desk officers, my work also included supporting efforts to combat corruption in Ukraine and holding leadership accountable for a lack of high-level prosecutions.\n\nIn July 2017, as the Trump Administration was considering overturning the\n\nban on providing Ukraine defensive weapons, I was asked to join the National Security Council Staff at the White House. As the Director covering Ukraine, I staffed the President's December 2017 decision to provide Ukraine with Javelin anti-tank missile systems. I also staffed his September 2017 meeting with then-\n\nPresident Poroshenko on the margins of the UN General Assembly. Throughout\n\nboth, I heard\u2014directly and indirectly\u2014President Trump describe Ukraine as a\n\ncorrupt country.\n\nDuring my time at the NSC, I received multiple calls from lobbyist Robert\n\nLivingston, who told me that Ambassador Yovanovitch should be fired. He\n\ncharacterized Ambassador Yovanovitch as an \"Obama holdover\" and associated\n\nwith George Soros. It was not clear to me at the time\u2014or now\u2014at whose\n\ndirection or at whose expense Mr. Livingston was seeking the removal of\n\nAmbassador Yovanovitch. I documented these calls and told my boss, Fiona Hill, and George Kent, who was in Kyiv at the time. I am not aware of any action that was taken in response.\n\nI left the NSC in July 2018 and started studying Arabic at the Foreign\n\nService Institute in preparation for a tour in Baghdad. That plan was cut short in May 2019, when I was asked to take over as Ambassador Volker's Advisor. I spent the month of June embedded in our Embassy in Kyiv to prepare and then spent the week of July 8 overlapping with my predecessor, Christopher Anderson. That week was the first time I became aware that Ambassador Volker was in touch with Rudolph Giuliani. However, Ambassador Volker's conversations with Giuliani were separate from my work, and I was generally unaware of when they spoke or what they spoke about. I have never had contact with Rudolph Giuliani.\n\nOn July 18, I participated in a sub-Policy Coordination Committee video\n\nconference where an OMB representative reported that the White House Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney, had placed an informal hold on security assistance to\n\nUkraine. The only reason given was that the order came at the direction of the\n\nPresident. I had heard about the hold before that date, but do not remember the\n\nspecific date.\n\nDuring the July 25 phone call between President Trump and President\n\nZelenskyy, I was traveling with Ambassador Volker in Kyiv. I did not listen in on the call. I accompanied Ambassador Volker in meetings with Ukrainian officials and to the Line of Contact between Ukrainian armed forces and the Russia-led forces in eastern Ukraine. The only readout I got of July 25 call was based on what President Zelenskyy told Ambassadors Volker, Taylor, and Sondland about the call at a meeting on July 26. The focus of the call, as I understood it, was to schedule a face-to-face meeting between President Trump and President Zelenskyy. We hoped that such a meeting would help undo President Trump's long-held view of Ukraine as a corrupt country.\n\nSince July, my sole focus has been supporting efforts to resolve the conflict\n\nin eastern Ukraine. Zelenskyy's election and his mandate to tackle corruption\n\nignited new energy into stalled talks. Right now, even as Ukrainians face\n\ncasualties nearly every day in defense of their own territory against Russian\n\naggression, the sides are making progress disengaging at key crossing points.\n\nZelenskyy has shown a willingness to take political risk to bring Russia back to the table. His best chance at success is with our support along with our European partners. It is my hope that even as this Committee's process plays out, we do not lose sight of what is happening in Ukraine and its great promise as a prosperous and democratic member of the European community.\n\nThank you again for the opportunity to speak, and I welcome your questions\n\nNPR diplomacy correspondent Michele Kelemen contributed to this report.", "description": "Croft, a State Department employee who previously worked for the National Security Council, is the latest witness to testify behind closed doors with House investigators.", "authors": ["Brandon Carter"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/10/29/gettyimages-95070254_wide-59e05872e10ece5f6e155f2bd675f012e89f587e.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
