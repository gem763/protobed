In fact, the 96 degree high temperature for the city broke a record, which was last set in 2018 when it was 95 degrees. Some relief in the form of a cold front is on the way, but it won\u2019t get too far to our south and east, though, so clouds and some showers remain a risk into late week. Some interaction with Hurricane Dorian is possible, as well.\n\nListen to our daily D.C. forecasts: Apple Podcasts | Amazon Echo | More options\n\nThrough tonight: Today\u2019s storminess so far lacks much potency, and that may remain the case through the evening. This in mind, passing showers could be briefly heavy. Some thunder is possible, as well. Overnight, trending a bit drier with lows settling to the mid-60s to near 70.\n\nView the current weather at The Washington Post.\n\nTomorrow (Thursday): We\u2019ll be behind the cold front, and Dorian will be working up the coast. This means we\u2019ll be cooler than recent days but also hard-pressed to see much sun. I doubt it will be too wet during the day, but a passing wave or two of showers seems possible. Highs will be mainly in the mid-70s to around 80. Winds are out of the northeast around 5 mph to 10 mph.\n\nSee Dan Stillman\u2019s forecast through the weekend.

Mold spores are low.\n\n90s update: Today\u2019s record high was the second of the warm season in the city, and with Day 53 of 90 degrees or greater under our belt, we now sit tied for 13th most in a full year. We are quickly running out of time for more, given an average final of September 11, but it\u2019s a bit too early to call it yet.\n\n\n\nThe progression of 90-degree days this year.
