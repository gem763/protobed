Announced as the successor to the PlayStation 3 during a press conference on February 20, 2013, it was launched on November 15 in North America, November 29 in Europe, South America and Australia; and February 22, 2014, in Japan. It competes with Nintendo's Wii U and Switch, and Microsoft's Xbox One.\n\nMoving away from the more complex Cell microarchitecture of its predecessor, the console features an AMD Accelerated Processing Unit (APU) built upon the x86-64 architecture, which can theoretically peak at 1.84 teraflops; AMD stated that it was the \"most powerful\" APU it had developed to date. The PlayStation 4 places an increased emphasis on social interaction and integration with other devices and services, including the ability to play games off-console on PlayStation Vita and other supported devices (\"Remote Play\"), the ability to stream gameplay online or to friends, with them controlling gameplay remotely (\"Share Play\"). The console's controller was also redesigned and improved over the PlayStation 3, with improved buttons and analog sticks, and an integrated touchpad among other changes. The console also supports HDR10 high-dynamic-range color and playback of 4K multimedia.\n\nThe topics which we cover in this Channel\n\nRecent software updates of Play-Station 4.\n\nPrices regarding the Play-Station 4.\n\nNew Games launched for Play-Station 4.\n\nNew updates available from Sony Update Center.\n\nAny hardware issues of Play-Station 4.\n\nComplete Specifications about the newly launched Play-Station 4.\n\nComparison between Play-Station 4 and other gaming devices.\n\nUpcoming games from Play-Station 4\n\nComparison between old & new Play-Station series\n\nDevice performance, speed & Stability.\n\nRecent keynotes from Play-Station 4\n\nReception to the original PlayStation 4 model was positive, with critics praising Sony for acknowledging its consumers' needs, embrace of independent game development, and for not imposing restrictive digital rights management schemes that Microsoft had previously announced for Xbox One prior to its release.
