Saj [Javid] remains furious because he is not part of the decision-making process on government expenditure. It all comes from Cummings and a small number of No 10 people. A lot of people are saying that Saj\u2019s days are numbered. No 10 is much happier with Rishi.\u201d\n\nA second government source said: \u201cRelations between the PM and the chancellor are just about OK on a personal level but there is a lot of tension at the level below that.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cSajid is acting like he got 45% of the vote in the leadership election. He doesn\u2019t seem to understand there\u2019s an election coming and keeps saying he will consider policies in 2020 when this government might not even be in power then.\u201d\n\nIt is understood No 10 is planning to make big, headline-grabbing announcements to appeal to voters on the domestic agenda, aside from Brexit, at party conference.\n\nHowever, the source said Javid was being \u201cdifficult\u201d over signing off conference policies that No 10 and departments want to implement on housing, including a more interventionist move to build more homes, and plans for a longer funding settlement for the NHS and social care.\n\nRelations are believed to have worsened since Javid was infuriated by the sacking of Khan. It emerged that the chancellor had not been warned in advance that she was about to get her marching orders.\n\nKhan was accused of leaking information about government strategy to Hammond, who is co-ordinating parliamentary moves to prevent a no-deal Brexit.\n\nKhan was the fourth young woman in a month to be axed from the prime minister\u2019s network of advisers and senior staffers, leaving Javid without a media adviser before the spending review, where he laid out details of a \u00a314bn allocation for schools and new police funding.\n\nShe was confronted by Cummings who demanded to see both her mobile telephones, sources said. After she admitted speaking to a former adviser to Hammond, she was marched off the premises by an armed police officer.\n\nThe episode underlined simmering tensions over the summer between Downing Street and the Treasury. Javid was ordered by No 10 to scrap a planned speech on the economy, while Downing Street took the lead in announcing spending plans for health, police and prisons.\n\nThe day after Khan\u2019s sacking, Javid took to the airwaves and refused to discuss the sacking but insisted he had a \u201cfantastic\u201d relationship with the prime minister.\n\nHe told the Today programme: \u201cI\u2019m not going to discuss any personnel issues, it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate.\n\n\u201cThe relationship is fantastic with the prime minister. Before he was prime minister, he is someone I got on with incredibly well. It\u2019s a real privilege to work with him, to work closely so well on people\u2019s priorities.\u201d\n\nIt is understood that ministers bid for \u00a355bn worth of spending commitments, which were cut down to \u00a313.4bn by the chancellor.\n\nA No 10 source said: \u201cThe PM and chancellor\u2019s teams are working hand in glove to deliver an ambitious policy agenda. This process might ruffle a few feathers in departments, but officials in both No 10 and 11 are used to it.\u201d", "description": "Chancellor trying to water down spending announcements PM wants to make, say sources", "authors": ["Rajeev Syal", "Rowena Mason"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/514ab27f3db355dc848a9cf3878d91220af8f242/1639_69_3302_1981/master/3302.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c498ebc4d84d6a4afe8d61fba8f6b393", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
