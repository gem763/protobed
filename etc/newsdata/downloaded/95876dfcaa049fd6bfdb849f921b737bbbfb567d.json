Bernie Sanders is up by 5 over Trump (45-40) and Elizabeth Warren has a 4-point edge (45-41). In each case, the remaining 13-14 percent of undecided/third-party voters is enough to shift the race either way.\n\nTrump receives 41 percent support or less in each of the matchups \u2014 well below the 47 percent he won the Badger State with in 2016. At the same time, none of the Democrats hit 50 percent\u2026\n\nTrump won rural voters by 27 points in 2016. They now back him over Biden by only 2 points.\n\nBy a 19-point margin Wisconsin voters think tariffs hurt rather than help the economy, and more oppose building a wall along the southern border by 10 points.", "description": "", "authors": ["Fox News", "Foxnews.Com Politics Fox-News-Poll-Biden-Bests-Trump-By-Nine-Points-In-Wisconsin"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
