The bank forecasted that growth in US flights would fall from the 2.1% expected to just 1.3%.\n\nAnd that could have a big impact on aircraft manufacturers.\n\nUBS estimates it could reduce the number of smaller planes ordered from Airbus and rival Boeing by 110 each year.\n\nThe bank said that would reduce revenues at Airbus, which controls around 57% of the market, by around \u20ac2.8bn (\u00a32.5bn) a year.\n\nAre you planning to fly less to help combat climate change?
