I think impeachment now takes center stage,\u201d said Erin O\u2019Brien, associate professor of political science at University of Massachusetts, Boston.\n\nDoug Heye, a Republican strategist who worked with congressional leaders, said Republican messaging just got simpler, if less positive.\n\n\u201cFor Democrats running for president, breaking through on healthcare or the economy just got a lot tougher,\u201d he said. \u201cImpeachment will be the dominant topic for a long time.\u201d\n\n\u2018SUBJECT OF TRUMP\u2019S AFFECTION\u2019\n\nBiden, who leads polls in the Democratic race to pick a challenger to Trump, said on Tuesday he would back impeachment if the Republican president fails to comply with congressional requests for information on Ukraine and other matters.\n\nTrump has raised unsubstantiated charges that Biden improperly tried to halt a Ukrainian probe of a company with ties to his son, without providing any evidence of wrongdoing by either.\n\nLater on Tuesday as he called into a fundraiser in Baltimore, Maryland, Biden said he \u201ccan take these attacks\u201d.\n\n\u201cAnd the reason I am being attacked is that most polls show me beating him by 10 to 15 points. I am not at all surprised I have become the object of his affection and attention,\u201d he said.\n\nBiden leads Trump by about 5 percentage points in a hypothetical general election match-up against Trump, according to the Sept. 23-24 Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Tuesday.\n\nIn a sign that Biden\u2019s supporters are largely standing by their candidate so far, 20% of Democrats and independents said they would vote for him in statewide nominating contests that begin next year according to the latest poll, up 1 percentage point from a similar poll that ran last week.\n\nBut the same poll also showed that Americans overall are less supportive of impeaching Trump than they were months ago, highlighting a risk of the move backfiring on Democrats if they are seen overreaching.\n\n\u201cOn one level, this whole issue helps Biden, because it makes the president look afraid of Biden,\u201d said Kyle Kondik, a political analyst at the University of Virginia. \u201cBut the president has a great ability to drag people into the mud with him, and you wonder if that might happen to Biden.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s Democratic rivals, including U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris, are set to benefit if the front-runner falls off. But most have so far refused to be drawn into specific questions about Biden and his family, and are likely to stay that way for now.\n\n\u201cOn the one hand they want to see Biden struggle, but it might undermine the party overall in a general election,\u201d Kondik said.\n\nWarren, who edged past Sanders for the first time to rank second behind Biden in the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll with 14 % support, said on Twitter the impeachment inquiry was \u201can overdue but important step.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one is above the law\u2014not even the president of the United States,\u201d Warren said, without mentioning Biden. \u201cThank you to everyone who protested, organized, and asked the crucial questions to get us to this moment.\n\nSo far, Trump has proven remarkably resilient in the face of repeated scandals and retaining strong support from Republicans.\n\nDemocrats should act swiftly to convince voters their actions are necessary - and prevent Trump from successfully arguing he is being unfairly prosecuted, said Joel Payne, a Democratic strategist who advised Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Senator Bernie Sanders, former Vice President Joe Biden, Senator Elizabeth Warren and Senator Kamala Harris (L-R) participate in the 2020 Democratic U.S. presidential debate in Houston, Texas, U.S. September 12, 2019.

They\u2019re just trying to start something up like they did with (Russia),\u201d she said, referring to former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe the Russians helped and I don\u2019t believe any of this with the Ukrainians, sorry.\u201d", "description": "The crowded field of Democratic presidential candidates were nearly unanimous in praising House Democrats' decision to begin an impeachment inquiry into Republican President Donald Trump over accusations he sought foreign help to smear a political rival.", "authors": ["Ginger Gibson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433702556&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O0N6", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
