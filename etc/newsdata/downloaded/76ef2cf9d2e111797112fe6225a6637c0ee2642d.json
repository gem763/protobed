Sure, Shoebridge has a vested interest in keeping the racing population well-hatted, but she insists it\u2019s merely good manners \u2013 not to mention stylish. \u201cI always think of the milliner Stephen Jones,\u201d she says, \u201cwho says that hats are like the exclamation points of our outfits. Who doesn\u2019t want that?\u201d\n\nAs the spring racing carnival careens into town, the time is nigh to begin planning one\u2019s style \u2013 including, of course, headwear. This season, says Shoebridge, the headband is a big trend, driven by the catwalks of Prada and Gucci.\n\nThe Anna headband in black and white would tick all the boxes at Derby Day.\n\n\u201cHeadbands have been around for a few years now but this year they\u2019ve really come into their own,\u201d she says. \u201cTo be honest, at first I thought they were something of a gateway to a bigger hat but actually they\u2019re a trend of their own. They\u2019re a good way to show off your make-up and hair without detracting from your outfit, and they\u2019re one size fits all, which is good if you\u2019re shopping online.\u201d\n\nHats are the ultimate accessory. Nothing finishes an outfit like a hat. \u2014 Mike Witt, Strand Hatters\n\nShoebridge, who has been creating millinery for 16 years and was the Australian finalist for Hat Designer of the Year in 2013, was inspired by 1960s Italian cinema for her own collection this season. There is the Anna, a soft black bow that falls like a fringe, the Marcello, a sunshine yellow sunhat tied with a bow under the chin, and the Claudia, a red-and-white broad brim hat that evokes a trattoria tablecloth \u2013 the most stylish one you\u2019ve ever seen, of course.\n\nAlthough Shoebridge doesn\u2019t produce toppers for men \u2013 yet \u2013 she says it\u2019s an area she is keen to explore. \u201cMen wear hats more often than women,\u201d she says. \u201cIt makes sense that they should wear them to the races.\u201d\n\nCap off a suit with the right hat \u2013 straw Panamas, trilbys and fedoras are on trend for men. Jessica Shapiro\n\nIt\u2019s a sentiment with which Mike Witt, owner of Sydney\u2019s Strand Hatters, wholeheartedly agrees. \u201cHats are the ultimate accessory. Nothing finishes an outfit like a hat.\u201d\n\nOver the past few years, says Witt, there\u2019s been a substantial increase in men looking for hatwear for the races. \u201cIt started with stylists coming in with suits and shoes and requesting hats to match for male clients, but now we see the men themselves come in. They\u2019ve got the suits and they\u2019re looking for something to finish the outfit.\u201d", "description": "Take your inspiration from the catwalks to get ahead of the pack \u2013\u00a0headwear with flair is the name of the game.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.798%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_1421%2C$y_156/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/68aed685dfd055c4bcf89e8b3cc31ea02d8fbd28", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
