When Obama Was President", "language": "en", "text": "Donald Trump insisted that Saudi Arabia \u201cfight their own wars\u201d \u2014 or \u201cpay us an absolute fortune to protect them.\u201d But that was in 2014, when Barack Obama was president. On Sunday he said the U.S. is \u201clocked and loaded,\u201d waiting to \u201chear from the Kingdom\u201d about who was responsible for the attack Saturday on Saudi oil facilities.\n\nAs it turns out, the U.S. didn\u2019t wait for \u201cthe Kingdom\u201d but instead informed the Saudis on Monday that Iran was responsible for the attack. But the Saudis said American officials failed to provide enough proof that Iran was responsible, The Wall Street Journal reported. Iran has denied responsibility. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said the attack was an act of self-defense by the Yemeni Houthi rebels in response to being bombed by the Saudis.\n\nSaudi Arabia should fight their own wars, which they won't, or pay us an absolute fortune to protect them and their great wealth-$ trillion! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 31, 2014\n\nSaudi Arabia oil supply was attacked. There is reason to believe that we know the culprit, are locked and loaded depending on verification, but are waiting to hear from the Kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack, and under what terms we would proceed! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 15, 2019\n\nTrump\u2019s supporters are backing his bristling war readiness, with Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) suggesting the U.S. consider bombing Iran\u2019s refineries, which would \u201cbreak the regime\u2019s back.\u201d\n\nBut Trump\u2019s posturing has also triggered a flood of criticism, with Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) accusing the president of turning America into Saudi Arabia\u2019s \u201cbitch.\u201d She accused Trump of waiting for orders from his \u201cSaudi masters.\u201d\n\nSen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) said U.S. military action on behalf of the Saudis against Iran would be \u201ca grave mistake.\u201d And Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) tweeted that there is \u201cno imminent threat and the U.S. military is not authorized to retaliate on behalf of another country.\u201d\n\nLawmakers reminded Trump that it\u2019s the job of Congress whether or not to declare war. \u201cOnly Congress \u2014 not the president \u2014 can declare war,\u201d Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a 2020 presidential candidate, tweeted Sunday. \u201cAnd Congress will not give you the authority to start another disastrous war in the Middle East just because the brutal Saudi dictatorship told you to.\u201d\n\nTrump appeared to back off Monday from his locked-and-loaded pose. \u201cDo I want war?\u201d he said to reporters in the Oval Office. \u201cI don\u2019t want war with anybody.\u201d But the president added: \u201cWe\u2019re prepared more than anybody.\u201d He also said that the Saudis are \u201cgoing to have a lot of involvement in this if we decide to do something ... that includes payment.\u201d\n\nThe attacks early Saturday on a massive oil field and refinery disrupted about 50% of Saudi oil output \u2014 5% of the entire global supply.\n\nFor decades before Trump was president, he blasted Saudi Arabia for taking advantage of its relationship with America and once mocked Obama for bowing at a meeting with the Saudi king.\n\nDo we still want a President who bows to the Saudis and lets OPEC rip us off? Make America strong, vote for @MittRomney. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 6, 2012\n\nNo surprise Saudis turned down spot on UN Security Council. They don\u2019t want responsibility. Just have us do their heavy lifting. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 18, 2013\n\nIn office, Trump has been a constant supporter of the autocratic Saudi royal family, even after the CIA determined that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was \u201cdirectly involved\u201d in the assassination a year ago of Washington Post writer Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nAlso on HuffPost\n\nLove HuffPost?
