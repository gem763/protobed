REUTERS/Jason Lee/Illustration/File Photo\n\nIn Asian trade it was steady around 107.75 yen JPY=, near a one-week peak, and edged higher against the euro EUR= to $1.0916. The single currency slipped to a fresh two-year low pressured by an increasingly weak outlook for the euro zone.\n\nThe greenback also steadied against the Australian dollar, near its strongest in three weeks, while it regained some ground handed to the New Zealand dollar on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThe positive U.S. dollar trend, with lots of noise in between it, remains intact,\u201d said Westpac analyst Imre Speizer in Auckland.\n\nHe added that risk aversion driven by trade war fears, a resilient U.S. economy and increasingly less-dovish-than-expected language from U.S. Federal Reserve board members were supporting the greenback.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a bit of political risk thrown in there as well via the Middle East and Brexit,\u201d he said.\n\nThe pound wallowed at $1.2325, close to a two-week low hit on Thursday after the European Union\u2019s Brexit negotiator said Britain had yet to provide \u201clegal and operational\u201d proposals for an agreement on exiting the bloc.\n\nBroader sentiment was fickle across markets. Positive comments from the Chinese commerce ministry on progress in trade negotiations had rallied European stocks overnight.\n\nRichmond Federal Reserve President Thomas I. Barkin said the U.S. economy looked strong and it was too early to tell whether further rate cuts were needed.\n\nBut a Bloomberg report that said the United States was unlikely to extend a waiver over Huawei Technologies\u2019 blacklist weighed on U.S. equities.\n\nMarkets are also digesting the impeachment probe launched into U.S. President Donald Trump, who went on the offensive as investors increasingly view the inquiry as a long-term drag rather than a short-term risk.\n\nThe opening of the probe on Wednesday had initially knocked the dollar, but it soon recovered and surged.\n\nThe dollar index .DXY, which measures the greenback against a basket of other currencies, rose overnight to its highest since Sept. 3 and held near that mark on Friday at 99.215.\n\n\u201cIt seems that when push comes to shove, the USD remains the safest place to be at the moment,\u201d said Rodrigo Catril, senior FX analyst at National Australia Bank in Sydney.\n\n\u201cIn addition to its prime reserve currency status, the greenback is still benefiting from a yield supremacy and a U.S. economy that is still performing relatively well.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, the Australian dollar AUD=D3 was firmer at $0.6754, but only marginally as traders wait for a central bank meeting next Tuesday where the Reserve Bank of Australia is widely expected to cut interest rates.\n\nThe New Zealand dollar NZD=D3 surrendered some of its gains won on Thursday, when Reserve Bank of New Zealand Governor Adrian Orr was circumspect about the prospect of further monetary easing to steady at $0.6295.\n\nThe Chinese yuan CNH= eased in offshore trade to 7.1300 per dollar.", "description": "The dollar stood tall on Friday, holding near multi-week highs against most major currencies as heightened risks from political tensions to the Sino-U.S. trade war increased its safe-haven luster.", "authors": ["Tom Westbrook", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434357191&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q04E", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
