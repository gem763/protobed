The term relates to animals that have contracted chronic wasting disease, a highly contagious and terminal disorder that causes symptoms such as lack of fear of humans, lethargy and emaciation\n\nNevada legislators also passed a law earlier this year to keep parts of certain carcasses out of the state in an attempt to stop the spread of the disease.\n\nStates reporting animals with the illness include Kansas, Colorado and Wyoming.\n\nWHAT IS 'ZOMBIE DEER DISEASE'? As of January 2019, Chronic wasting disease (CWD), also known as 'zombie deer disease,' has been reported in 24 US states and two Canadian provinces. The infection attacks the brain, spinal cord, and other tissues in deer, elk, and moose, resulting in dramatic weight loss, lack of coordination, and even aggression before they eventually die. There is no evidence yet that it can infect humans, and no such cases have been reported, according to the CDC. But, a recent study found macaques could get the disease after consuming infected meat, sparking fears that a variant that also infects humans could eventually emerge. Officials are urging precaution to minimize any potential risks.\n\nThe disease is neither viral nor bacterial.\n\nInstead, it is transmitted by prions - protein particles that have been linked to brain diseases including mad cow disease in cattle and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans.\n\nPrion diseases damage brain tissue, leading to abnormal behavior, and are incurable.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has raised concern that chronic wasting disease may pose a risk to humans.\n\nThe minimum time between exposure and the first symptoms is thought to be 16 months, according to a study posted to the Center for Food Security and Public Health.\n\nThe average incubation period is two to four years.\n\nSome studies show that animals are contagious before symptoms start.\n\nWolff said finding just one is rare because the disease is so contagious and it remains in the environment for years.\n\nA 2004 study in the Centers for Disease Control's Emerging Infectious Diseases journal showed two captive mule deer populations were infected with the disease in separate paddocks that hadn't had infected animals in them about two years.\n\nNevada lawmakers this year banned bringing certain animal body parts into the state, including the brain and the spinal cord that can contain large concentrations of prions.\n\nIn testimony about the proposed law, Tyler Turnipseed, chief Nevada game warden, posed a scenario where local populations are infected by exposure to butchered waste dumped by a hunter passing through Nevada from another state.\n\nJ.J. Goicoechea, a state Department of Agriculture veterinarian, told lawmakers that officials fear the spread of the disease into Nebraska, Utah, Idaho and Nevada.\n\nThe disease is neither viral nor bacterial. Instead, it is transmitted by prions - protein particles that have been linked to brain diseases including mad cow disease in cattle and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans\n\nWolff said efforts to decrease risk probably won't stop the disease at the Nevada state line.\n\n'It's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when,' she said. 'We know that we can't wrap Nevada in a bubble.'\n\nUniversity of Minnesota infectious disease expert Michael Osterholm and other prion disease scientists believe chronic wasting disease could end up following a path similar to mad cow disease and jump to humans.\n\nThe doctors made their case in 'Chronic Wasting Disease in Cervids: Implications for Prion Transmission to Humans and Other Animal Species' published in July.\n\n'It is probable that human cases associated with the consumption of contaminated meat will be documented in the years ahead,' Dr Osterholm, of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, told the Minnesota legislature in February.\n\n'It is possible that a number of human cases will be substantial and will not be isolated events,' he told UPI.\n\nSo far, there is no evidence that chronic wasting disease can cross species from deer to humans. But abnormal prion diseases can take years to show up and prions are known to mutate into new forms.
