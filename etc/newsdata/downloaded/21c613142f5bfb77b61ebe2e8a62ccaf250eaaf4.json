(Picture: AMC)\n\nLast week saw a herd of zombies unleashed onto Alexandria, and while Michonne was left thinking it was Alpha who had started war against or OG group \u2013 we\u2019re not too sure.\n\nAfter bringing down one threat, The Hilltop were then faced with a fallen tree that brought down part of their wall.\n\nNot only this, but the sound of it cascading down attracted hundreds of walkers to the community.\n\nLuke and his gang rushed outside of the wall to protect their people, but were overrun by the dead and had to come back inside.\n\nFollowing the fight, it was then revealed that another trap had been set on Oceanside \u2013 seeing Michonne team up with Luke, and her bambino Judith, to go and save their friends.\n\nBut Alpha appears to have softened and doesn\u2019t want to harm her enemies while they still have her daughter Lydia in their grasp, making us almost convinced there\u2019s a new bad guy on the scene.\n\nIs Luke going to die?\n\nHas Luke said his final farewells (Picture: AMC)\n\nIt pains us to write this question, as Luke is one of our solid favourite faces of the series, however we can\u2019t help but feel that this episode was setting up his departure.\n\nThe loved member of The Hilltop said his farewells to his people as he excitedly hopped into the car on his way to help Oceanside.\n\nAnd you know when you have that gut feeling that this is the last time you\u2019re going to see someone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell we sure got those vibes, as happy music played in the background as he set off to go and meet his crush.\n\nIt was almost too happy, and too calm for The Walking Dead \u2013 meaning it must be too good to be true.\n\nGoodbye Luke.\n\nWill Lydia and Siddiq team up?\n\nIs Siddiq hiding more than we think? (Picture: AMC)\n\nThere are a number of theories circling Siqqiq at the moment, with one being he is secretly working for Alpha and only managed to escape because he committed the beheadings back in season nine.\n\nWhile we know he is suffering with PTSD, it\u2019s almost as if he is hiding something alongside his illness.\n\nAnd if rumours prove true, and Lydia finds out, the pair might just plot their revenge and escape together.\n\nLydia was seen beaten to the ground by members of The Hilltop, and almost lost her life before Negan stepped in and saved her.\n\nBut there\u2019s not much keeping the character at the community, not since Henry died anyway, and maybe at this point she might want to return to her Whisperer mother.\n\nCould Siddiq be her escape? And is he working for the enemy?\n\nWhere did Negan go and who let him free?\n\nWhere on Earth has Negan gone? (Picture: AMC)\n\nIn the comics, Negan escapes his prison, runs away, and that\u2019s basically that.\n\nBut we know Scott Gimple won\u2019t allow the Saviour to be off our screens for too long \u2013 he\u2019s just too good to let go.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter he saved Lydia, Negan was sent back to his cell, as he also ended up killing one of the group who was beating the ex-Whisperer.\n\nAnd while the people of The Hilltop were calling for his execution, Daryl Dixon stepped in and expressed how his former enemy was actually doing the right thing.\n\nWhile we have no idea where he has escaped to, we can\u2019t help but think Daryl let Negan out of his cage in an attempt to save his life.\n\nAs he sure won\u2019t allow Lydia to take the flack for it.\n\nIs Carol going to run away?\n\nWill Carol leave behind her people for a clean break (Picture: AMC)\n\nCarol revealed on three occasions how unhappy she was at The Hilltop.\n\nWhen talking to her bestie Daryl, she joked with the original group member that they should have run away to New Mexico when they had the chance.\n\nShe also made reference to time standing still, as people have yet to get over the whole Negan drama (not like he didn\u2019t kill their family members or anything).\n\nBut while that might have just been your average post-apocalyptic chit chat, the final scene shows Carol standing on her balcony and glaring into the distance with a map in her hand.\n\nWhile we were convinced that she would be the one to take down Alpha \u2013 after she killed Carol\u2019s son Henry \u2013 maybe the mourning mother has just had enough and wants a clean break.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be the first time she has tried to run away \u2013 and she quite liked it back then \u2013 so what\u2019s stopping her now?\n\nThe Walking Dead continues Sunday on AMC in the US and follows a day later here in the UK.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
