But if you\u2019re looking for a short-term side hustle with competitive wages ($13.50 to $30 an hour), you might want to apply for one of the new temp jobs from the U.S. Census Bureau to help conduct the 2020 census.\n\nThe census jobs have flexible hours, which can include days, evenings, and/or weekends. Most of them require employees to have access to a vehicle and a valid driver\u2019s license (unless public transportation is readily available) and access to a computer with internet, as well as an email account.\n\nAs you likely know, the U.S. census is a government-run survey conducted every 10 years to account for every person living in America. The results help determine everything from how federal funds are distributed among communities to the number of seats each state gets in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nThe 2020 census needs 500,000 temp workers\n\nThat\u2019s a herculean effort that takes plenty of workers to pull off.\n\n\u201cWe anticipate hiring a total of five hundred thousand temporary workers nationwide \u2014 including census takers, recruiting assistants, office staff and supervisory staff,\u201d says Tim Olson, the Census Bureau\u2019s associate director for field operations. \u201cIn areas where the Census Bureau has local offices, clerical jobs are also available.\u201d\n\nThe 2020 census officially starts counting people in January 2020 in remote Toksook Bay, Alaska. After that\u2019s done, most households in the country will begin receiving invitations to respond online, by phone or by mail in March 2020. If a household doesn\u2019t respond, an enumerator will follow up in person.\n\nRead: Including a citizenship question on the U.S. Census could have unexpected, long-term implications for your finances\n\nEach Census Bureau position, however, has a different timeline for onboarding employees. \u201cCurrently, we\u2019re conducting address-canvassing operations, which are occurring now and go through next year,\u201d Olson says. The canvassing workers help the Census Bureau improve and refine its address list of households, essential to deliver invitations to respond to the census. Canvassers go door-to-door, working mostly daylight hours, wearing badges and carrying briefcases indicating their affiliation with the Census Bureau.\n\n\u201cBecause we need to fill thousands of positions across the country, we start recruiting several months before making job offers,\u201d explains Olson. \u201cDepending on when an individual applies, it may be several weeks or several months before we start hiring in the local area.\u201d\n\nAnd he notes, if you\u2019re not hired initially, you might be selected later. Applications remain in the pool for the entire 2020 census operation. \u201cThat way, an application could potentially be considered whenever there are openings in the area,\u201d says Olson.\n\nWhat census takers do\n\nOf the half-million workers needed, about 50,000 will fill the role of census takers. Also known as enumerators, these employees will go door-to-door to follow up with households who don\u2019t respond online, by phone or through the paper questionnaire they\u2019ll receive in the mail early next year.\n\nRead: The overlooked data point in the new Census report: Most families don\u2019t have much income\n\nThey\u2019ll ask residents the same questions that appear on the census form, which focus on demographics and aim to establish how many people were living, or staying, at that address on April 1, 2020 \u2014 the official Census Day. Information regarding age, race, sex and relationship among residents is also required.\n\nWith the diverse population in mind, the Census Bureau is seeking individuals who are fluent in English and other languages as well.\n\n\u201cWe are looking for multilingual employees,\u201d says Olson. \u201cSince we are focused at hiring at the local level, we are looking for people who can speak the languages in their area.\u201d\n\nA key census perk: flexible hours\n\nAll the Census hires will go through training, which can sometimes be done online. Though work schedules differ by position, hours for field positions are generally flexible, adds Olson.\n\n\u201cSome field positions require you to work during the day to see addresses on buildings,\u201d he says. \u201cOther field positions require interviewing members of the public; so, employees must be available to work evenings and weekends, when people are usually at home.\u201d\n\nFlexible hours was a key perk that journalist Edith G. Tolchin, author of the novel \u201cFanny on Fire,\u201d says she enjoyed working as a door-to-door census taker in upstate New York in 2010. \u201cYou could make your own hours as long as you got the job done,\u201d says Tolchin. \u201c(The) hourly rate was good and you could pretty much stay close to your neighborhood.\u201d\n\nCharles G., 48, of Los Angeles, worked for the 2010 census supervising a team of 18 enumerators while between full-time jobs. He agrees that the overall experience was a good one.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of positives,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re making a bit more than minimum wage. It gets you out of the house and you become friends with your fellow enumerators. I worked in my neighborhood, and for months after the job ended, I\u2019d see people I\u2019d met and it was always nice to say, \u2018Hey Barb!\u2019 and \u2018Hi Al!\u2019 You also get a feeling like you\u2019re helping out in your own community, which is nice.\u201d\n\nThe challenges of census work\n\nNevertheless, he also says he faced some challenges that made the job difficult at times. And, Charles G., adds, he imagines one of those issues \u2014 illegal immigration \u2014 will pop up again during the upcoming count. Though the Supreme Court ruled in June that the Census Bureau won\u2019t include a question about citizenship in the printed questionnaire for the 2020 census, this former census supervisor believes the court\u2019s decision may not be enough to ease residents\u2019 minds in some communities.\n\n\u201cA lot of people were afraid to respond, and they didn\u2019t answer the door because they fear you\u2019re with immigration,\u201d recalls Charles G. \u201cPeople were scared, and I\u2019m sure this time around those concerns will be heightened.\u201d\n\nAnother factor making the job tougher than expected, he notes, came from the media cautioning about dangerous individuals impersonating census workers.\n\n\u201cSome of my enumerators experienced name-calling by residents who believed they were impostors, even though were wearing their lanyards,\u201d he says.\n\nAlso read: Behold, the most lucrative (and fulfilling) side hustles\n\nTolchin points to another possible concern for canvassers: One of her biggest obstacles, she says, was \u201chaving, occasionally, to deal with menacing dogs.\u201d\n\nHow tech is changing the work\n\nTechnology is changing not only how 2020 census takers will apply for work, but also how they\u2019ll do their jobs.\n\nIn the past, census hiring was done by paper applications and in-person testing sessions. For the upcoming U.S. census, you can apply online through the bureau\u2019s website, 2020Census.gov/jobs. The application process takes approximately 30 minutes. (Interested individuals can call the census\u2019 toll-free number, 855-JOB-2020, for more information.)\n\nWhile census workers previously went door-to-door carrying reams of paper and perhaps a clipboard, 2020 enumerators can use smartphones, smart devices and laptops to update addresses and help people register their response.\n\nTolchin, who applied for the 2020 census, offers this tip for new enumerators: \u201cWear comfortable shoes and be persistent, yet diplomatic. Like the Postal Service, you\u2019re out in all sorts of weather.\u201d", "description": "The agency is looking for a half million workers for all kinds of jobs", "authors": ["Elizabeth Alterman"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR532_na_cen_ZG_20190918110842.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
