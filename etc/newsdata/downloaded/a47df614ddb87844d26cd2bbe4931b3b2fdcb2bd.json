Find one more and it makes a trend.\u201d\n\nI must have looked dubious.\n\n\u201cSix hundred to 800 words,\u201d she said. \u201cFast.\u201d\n\nBut when I thought about it, I began to notice hot priests everywhere.\n\nAndrew Scott: 'It\u2019s mind-blowing being described as a sex symbol' Read more\n\nCertainly Fleabag, the cult television series created by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, has done its part for hot priests. The second season features an Irish priest (Andrew Scott) whose vow of celibacy is temporarily compromised by Fleabag. He, in turn, punctures Fleabag\u2019s cynical shell.\n\nThen there\u2019s Grantchester, the mystery series about the crime-solving, jazz-listening Anglican vicar Sidney Chambers (James Norton). Chambers rides a bicycle around the bucolic postwar English countryside, getting mixed up in intrigue while battling his own demons, including combat PTSD. Since Chambers isn\u2019t sworn to celibacy, he also gets into various romantic entanglements. In the most recent season, Chambers is replaced by a new vicar \u2013 Will Davenport (Tom Brittney). Davenport is also devastatingly handsome, though he rides a motorbike, not a bicycle, and listens to rock instead of jazz.\n\nDerry Girls, Netflix\u2019s quirky sitcom about a group of Catholic schoolgirls (and one schoolboy) in 1990s Northern Ireland, also has a hot priest \u2013 the hip young Father Peter, who strides in accompanied by Snap!\u2019s Do You See the Light. (Sister Michael, the scene-stealing school principal, is less impressed. \u201cFor feck\u2019s sake,\u201d she mutters during one of his platitudes.)\n\nAnd yes, one more series: HBO has The Young Pope (Jude Law), returning soon in the sequel series, The New Pope. (The network\u2019s Spanish-language comedy, Los Espookys, has a subplot in the first episode involving an older priest resentful of a handsome, glossy-lipped, younger priest.)\n\nAs for movies, there are almost too many hot priest-related ones to count, but the most recent that springs to mind is First Reformed, Paul Schrader\u2019s 2017 drama featuring Ethan Hawke as a conflicted Calvinist clergyman.\n\nOn a recent Sunday, I decided to undertake some field research at an Episcopal church. There were three clergy \u2013 a woman and two men \u2013 and during the eucharist I seized the opportunity to get a closer look. Red wine trickled down my chin.\n\nThe priest who administered my communion was fairly good-looking. But was he a hot priest? I wondered, tripping as I entered my pew. And how do you define \u201chot\u201d? The scale itself is subjective, is it not? Does a man (or woman) of the cloth need some other, more je ne sais quoi quality in order to qualify? Is it more about charisma?\n\nI tried to puzzle through the phenomenon of the hot priest. Clearly there was something deeper, and more Freudian, at work \u2013 something about the priest as ultimate unattainable love interest. Is it because we like to think we\u2019re so special someone might break their vows just to be with us? Is it about the sexual taboo of coveting a man of God? Or is it something more complicated, and maybe even benevolent \u2013 a sign that millennials aren\u2019t as resigned to godless materialism as commonly thought?\n\nDavid Peters, an Episcopal priest and former military chaplain who has written for the Guardian, thinks it is probably a mixture of all of the above. A self-described \u201cliturgical influencer\u201d and \u201cVsco girl for Jesus\u201d, Peters has achieved modest viral fame on the streaming app TikTok for his #hotpriestsummer videos.\n\nPeters is trying to \u201cchurchplant\u201d a new congregation in the Austin suburbs and seized on TikTok as an unorthodox way of spreading the Good News. In his videos he lip-syncs to pop songs while showing off his most outrageous ecclesiastical garb and swinging incense.\n\n\u201cI think religious people, especially religious leaders, are not known for their joy,\u201d Peters told Vice. \u201cBut we believe that someone died and rose from the dead \u2013 that should make us really happy.\u201d\n\nAs for this sudden cultural infatuation with priests, he has a theory: \u201cIn any kind of romantic writing you\u2019ve got to create a situation where it\u2019s not easy for the couple to get together,\u201d he told me. \u201cAs our society becomes more progressive there are less and less of those barriers. So I guess priests, people who\u2019ve taken vows, are viewed as the ultimate test.\u201d\n\nHe also understands why many people are uncomfortable with sexualizing priests, even as a joke. It\u2019s a fear, he said, of \u201cthe profane breaking into the sacred\u201d. But, he added: \u201cThe sacred also has a way of breaking into the profane.\u201d", "description": "Fleabag had the hot priest, Grantchester has its sleuthing vicar and even HBO\u2019s Young Pope sequel is returning soon \u2013 but why are we so infatuated with them?", "authors": ["J Oliver Conroy"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5e4f3df83ed8b8b5c07192e00dac72456ca5cd8/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b7965a42bc2d156ed8aeae62317cd539", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
