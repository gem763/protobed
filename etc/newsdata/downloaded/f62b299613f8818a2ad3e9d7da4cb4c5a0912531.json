It clearly wasn\u2019t happening for the benefit of ordinary people in something like Futurama but at least there you had the side benefit of other staple sci-fi dreams like jetpacks and flying cars. The reality of today is that not only is it likely your job will be automated in the near future, but you won\u2019t even get the chance of a robot butler as compensation. Especially if you\u2019re a cab driver.\n\nNeo Cab is set in the cyberpunk future city of Los Ojos, where you play as Lina \u2013 one of the few human cab drivers still working. Lina was planning to move in with her best friend Savy, but her sudden disappearance has left you with nowhere to live and bills to pay. That makes being a cabbie even more important, as you must not only ensure you keep the money coming in but try and turn up any clues as to Savy\u2019s whereabouts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDismiss any thoughts you might have that this is some sort of cyberpunk Crazy Taxi (as immediately appealing as that idea sounds) because Neo Cab is nothing like that. Instead, it\u2019s a narrative driven game about the importance of human interaction and the dangers of unchecked capitalism. Think a more interactive version of VA-11 Hall-A, but where your main skill is knowing shortcuts not mixing drinks.\n\nJust to emphasise how much this isn\u2019t like Crazy Taxi you never actually manually drive your car and instead you just pick the route you want to take and let the game handle that side of things. The more important choices are who you chose to give a lift to, with most people being surprised that a human is still working as a cabbie \u2013 since the whole city has been manipulated into thinking they\u2019re a safety hazard by a fictional tech giant called Capra, that\u2019s portrayed as a mixture of Google and Telsa.\n\nDespite what is initially implied, the task of tracking down Savy is a pretty low-level priority for most of the game, in terms of both gameplay and storytelling. Which is a shame because it\u2019s an intriguing set-up and there are too few detective-themed video games as it is, but the actual focus is still interesting as the game sets about critiquing the power of corporations, the plight of modern working practices, and why knowing how to talk to people will always be the most important skill you can have.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is true for Lina in terms of not only her job but her own emotional state. You need to keep each customer happy, in order to maintain a five-star satisfaction rating, but every conversation you strike up also affects her emotionally \u2013 which is indicated very literally by a bracelet she wears that glows different colours depending on how she\u2019s feeling. If she\u2019s happy you won\u2019t be able to pick the most abusive dialogue options and if she\u2019s upset she won\u2019t be able to pretend otherwise.\n\nAlthough quite simplistic it\u2019s a clever mechanic that treats the player character as a real person and not just a virtual actor able to trot out whatever dialogue you choose to foist upon them. We\u2019d certainly be interested in seeing others, such as BioWare and Bethesda, attempt something similar, even if some players are bound to complain that it takes too much control out of their hands.\n\nNeo Cab (NS) \u2013 technology causes as many problems as it solves\n\nLike most good science fiction, the themes at the heart of Neo Cab are entirely contemporary, and yet the world of Neo Cab is a lot odder than you might imagine. Rather than the fairly grounded near future setting it first appears to be it not only has the technology cults and cyborgs of Cyberpunk 2077 but there\u2019s a lot of more fantastical talk about alternate timelines and other more sci-fi concepts. But since Lina is new in town you\u2019ve still got an anchor in the game, who\u2019s never heard about any of this before either, and as weird as some of your passengers are the problems they\u2019re dealing with are always very relatable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVideo games almost never deal with real-world issues if there\u2019s any risk it might put people off from buying them; as each new online shooter based on situations ripped straight from newspaper headlines desperately tries to insist it\u2019s not political. So it\u2019s a pleasure to play a game that is based almost entirely around discussing serious issues related to technology, automation, loneliness, and privacy.\n\nNeo Cab is generally very well written but the narrative does have some problems. You\u2019ll need to pick up some passengers multiple times to get the end of their stories, which mean you can finish the game without resolving any plot thread but the main one about Savy \u2013 which you have far less control over than is first implied.\n\nThe graphics, or more properly the budget, also lags way behind the game\u2019s other artistic ambitions. Despite the vivid descriptions of Los Ojos in the text conversations the reality when you look out the window is that every street looks the same and even the way Lina drives the car, in terms of when and in what direction she turns, bears no relation to where she\u2019s supposed to be going.\n\nThese faults may prevent Neo Cab from obtaining any kind of classic status but it\u2019s still one of the most interesting narrative-based games of the year, not only in terms of its setting and dialogue but the subjects it tackles. Neo Cab is a game that not only has something to say but manages to keep you thoroughly engaged while doing so.\n\nNeo Cab review In Short: One of the best narrative-based games of the year, that tackles a number of contemporary issues in an original and entertaining manner and whose main fault is merely a lack of budget. Pros: An excellent script that handles multiple topics in an engaging and thoughtful manner. Lina\u2019s mood bracelet is an interesting gameplay mechanic that deserves further development. Cons: Main Savy storyline is handled oddly and multiple playthroughs are needed to see the end of every plot thread. Low-tech visuals fail to match the text descriptions.
