(AP) - The 49ers\u2019 undefeated record seemed somewhat soft until they beat the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nComing into Sunday\u2019s game, San Francisco hadn\u2019t played an NFC West opponent. The four teams the 49ers did play - three from the AFC North and one from the NFC South - have a combined record of 6-18.\n\nBut the Niners were ready for their division showdown at Los Angeles, beating the Rams 20-7 and improving to 5-0 for the first time since 1990.\n\n\u201cWe were real happy with how we started, being 4-0,\u201d coach Kyle Shanahan said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a whole new ballgame when you\u2019re first opening up against your division. The Rams have dominated this division the last two years. It was a big step for our team.\u201d\n\nThe defense led the way. San Francisco recovered a fumble and limited the Rams\u2019 offense to just 3.1 yards per play.\n\n\u201cJust like coaches get better with more reps, so do players,\u201d Shanahan said of his defense. \u201cA lot of guys have gotten to play over these last couple of years. They\u2019re better now. The pieces we\u2019ve added are better. And I think our coaches have gotten better at using our personnel also.\u201d\n\nWHAT\u2019S WORKING\n\nShanahan\u2019s offense gets lots of attention for its ingenuity, but the defense has carried the 49ers. The defensive line features five former first-round picks (Nick Bosa, Dee Ford, DeForest Buckner, Arik Armstead and Solomon Thomas), and all five played well against the Rams. The 49ers also have added key free agents at linebacker (Kwon Alexander) and cornerback (Richard Sherman). Through five games, the defense has shown few weaknesses. It ranks second in both points allowed and yards allowed.\n\nWHAT NEEDS HELP\n\nWide receivers. The 49ers still are waiting for one of their young and unproven wideouts to step up and become a consistent performer. Against the Rams, the wide receivers combined for nine catches for 98 yards and Marquise Goodwin dropped a deep pass during the second quarter.\n\nSecond-year receiver Dante Pettis caught three passes for 45 yards. He nearly caught a touchdown pass as well, but got knocked out of bounds. Maybe he\u2019s the wideout who will step up.\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nRobert Saleh. The defensive coordinator\u2019s schemes and creative blitzes have overshadowed any individual player\u2019s performance, and have allowed a variety of players to make an impact. Six players have at least two sacks: Ronald Blair (2), Thomas (2), Armstead (2\u00bd), Bosa (3), Buckner (3) and Ford (3\u00bd).\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nRunning game. The 49ers averaged 5.2 yards per carry through the first quarter of the season. But against the Rams, the 49ers didn\u2019t have their starting left tackle (Joe Staley), starting right tackle (Mike McGlinchey) or starting fullback (Kyle Juszczyk). Without those three key blockers, San Francisco averaged just 2.4 yards per carry. The running game could struggle until those players return.\n\nINJURED\n\nThe 49ers came away from Sunday\u2019s game relatively unscathed. Wide receiver Deebo Samuel pulled his groin and nose tackle D.J. Jones pull his hamstring. Both are listed as day to day. Cornerback Ahkello Witherspoon is expected to return from a sprained foot Oct. 27 against the Carolina Panthers, and the 49ers hope Staley can return from a fractured fibula Oct. 31 against the Arizona Cardinals.\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\n157. That\u2019s how many net yards the 49ers allowed to the Rams, who hadn\u2019t gained fewer than 214 total yards since Sean McVay became their coach in 2017.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nThe 49ers will play their second straight road game, flying across the country to face the Washington Redskins (1-5), who are coming off a narrow victory over winless Miami.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The 49ers' undefeated record seemed somewhat soft until they beat the Los Angeles Rams.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Grant Cohn"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/14/49ers_rams_football_89409_c0-149-3481-2179_s1200x700.jpg?085e2a50c692d52a95a3fe9e624e254742fc1074", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
