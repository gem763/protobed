I was doing lots of slicing. It was actually working a lot for me, but my coach at that time really hated that shot. But as you saw here, it brought me a point, a very important one, and surprised the opponent.You never know. It might help me in the future, too.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

The Ukrainian, a permanent member of the world\u2019s top 10 since May 2017, has been a prolific accumulator of titles in recent years, but for the first time since 2011 is in danger of finishing a season without a winner\u2019s trophy to add to her collection. After winning a total of nine titles in 2017 and 2018, she has failed so far to reach any finals this year, having lost in five semi-finals and six quarter-finals.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The world No 8, who beat Karolina Pliskova in her opening match, is the defending champion and appears well suited by the slow court surface. Halep, who has been recovering from a back injury, complained during the match to Darren Cahill, her coach, that she was unable to hit any shots that troubled her opponent.\n\n\u201cThis court is not great for me, for my game,\u201d Halep said afterwards. \u201cIt\u2019s very soft in a way, even if you go and hit hard. I think that I hit well today, but not enough directions on the court. That\u2019s why I couldn\u2019t finish points. I got frustrated a little bit because of that. I got tired because I haven\u2019t trained much. But she played well. She didn\u2019t miss. I think she loves to play here. It\u2019s her style.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cWe all are tired after a long year. We have to do extra work on the shots and the points on this surface. But we have what we have and that\u2019s it.I\u2019m not going to complain about that.\u201d\n\nHalep, who had won her opening match against Bianca Andreescu on Monday and can still qualify for the semi-finals, started slowly, recovered from 0-3 down to 3-3, but then let Svitolina back in at the end of the first set.\n\nAlthough Halep drew first blood in the second set Svitolina broke back immediately and at 4-3 made the decisive breakthrough, breaking the former world No 1\u2019s serve to love. Serving for the match, Svitolina saved a break point before closing out victory when Halep netted a return.\n\nThe other semi-final berth from the Purple Group will be decided by a showdown on Friday between Halep and Pliskova, who recorded her first win of the week when Andreescu was forced to retire from their match after losing the first set 6-3.\n\nAndreescu led 2-0 but then injured her left knee when stretching for a forehand. The US Open champion had it heavily strapped during a medical time-out, but her movement was clearly hampered thereafter. Two days earlier Andreescu had hurt her back in losing to Halep.\n\nThe Canadian, who cannot now make the semi-finals, is due to play Svitolina in her final group match on Friday, but will have a scan on her injured knee before deciding whether or not to play. Sofia Kenin is the second alternate, Kiki Bertens having already replaced the injured Naomi Osaka.\n\n\u201cI stepped weirdly on a return,\u201d Andreescu said after her retirement. \u201cI heard my knee crack. It kind of went inwards. Putting pressure afterwards on it really bothered me. I could barely bend my knee. But I fought with the pain as much as I could. At some point an athlete has to say \u2018stop\u2019 and just listen to their body. That\u2019s what I did.It\u2019s disappointing because this is the last tournament of the year and you want to go all out.\u201d", "description": "The metronomically consistent Elina Svitolina and the flamboyantly unpredictable Gael Monfils might appear an unlikely pairing, but the 25-year-old Ukrainian produced a stunning shot straight out of her boyfriend\u2019s book in beating Simona Halep 7-5, 6-3 in the Shiseido WTA Finals here on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Paul Newman"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/07/09/16/Svitolina-edged-past-Muchova.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
