The number of forgettable quarters since then is now six and counting.\n\nThe Redskins\u2019 scintillating 30 minutes against Philadelphia were a distant memory Sunday as they hosted the Dallas Cowboys in a 31-21 loss. Quarterback Case Keenum reverted to a pumpkinlike journeyman. The young receiving corps resembled meek mice per the preseason projections.\n\nOne similarity was halfback Adrian Peterson. Like Derrius Guice in Week 1, Peterson might as well have donned glass slippers for his carries (10 for 25 yards), though he passed Jim Brown on the all-time list for rushing touchdowns.\n\nIt just seems like the clock struck midnight at halftime in Week 1 and the Redskins\u2019 offense woke up from a fairy tale beginning.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d all like to throw touchdowns every play and throw deep bombs to everybody,\u201d Keenum said Sunday, after connecting on two of the former and none of the latter. \u201cIt\u2019d be great if we can throw it to (tight end Vernon Davis) in the flat and he jumps over people. Those are incredible, incredible plays that those guys made.\u201d\n\nThere was no such magic against the Cowboys.\n\nWashington managed just 255 yards of total offense, 75 of which came on its last possession, when the game was out of reach. If you subtract that TD drive from Keenum\u2019s totals, he\u2019s left with 146 passing yards and a short scoring pass that cut the deficit to 21-14.\n\nKeenum hit rookie Terry McLaurin on a 1-yard pass to produce the final score with 2:20 remaining. There also was a garbage-time TD \u2014 with six seconds left \u2014 against the Eagles. That means Washington\u2019s scoring output through two games can be broken down in pitiful fashion.\n\nFirst half against Philly: 20 points.\n\nCompetitive portion of the last six quarters: 14 points.\n\nPerhaps coming out on fire was a mirage. Have we seen Washington\u2019s offense regress to its mean since then? \u201cSometimes you have to grind it out and it may not look pretty either,\u201d Keenum said. \u201cBut nobody expects to be average,\u201d Keenum. \u201cWe all want to score 100 points per game.\u201d\n\nAt this rate, it\u2019ll be 100 points every five games.\n\nWashington could help by getting out of its way. Jay Gruden\u2019s squad isn\u2019t merely shooting itself in the foot; it\u2019s hobbling itself like Kathy Bates did to James Caan in \u201cMisery.\u201d\n\nThe offense was encumbered with first-down holding penalties on three of its initial four possessions. Keenum & Co. overcame one such setback to open the scoring on Peterson\u2019s 1-yard plunge. But defensive end Montez Sweat contributed to the act later in the second quarter, albeit on a flimsy roughing-the-passer penalty, helping to set up the Cowboys\u2019 go-ahead touchdown.\n\nAs Dallas was scoring on five consecutive drives, Washington was struggling and failing to keep up. The lone bright spot was the 11-play, 70-yard march that resulted in McLaurin\u2019s second career TD catch. That was also the home team\u2019s lone possession in the third quarter because the defense couldn\u2019t get off the field.\n\nDallas wound up with 474 yards of total offense, including 213 on the ground. To further illustrate how far Washington has fallen, its 255 total yards were less than its first-half total (278) in Week 1.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a combination of things,\u201d Gruden said in explaining the drop-off. \u201cBoth games in the second half we got down by a couple of scores. We kind of got out of our rhythm. We had some really good flashes. It seems like when we do efficient football, something happens where it\u2019s a holding call, or a loss of five, or something like that that kills the drive.\u201d\n\nIf it\u2019s not one thing, it\u2019s a dozen.\n\nThe degree of difficulty will remain high next week when Chicago visits FedEx Field for Monday Night Football. The Bears held Green Bay to 10 points in an opening win and limited Denver to 14 points on Sunday. Gruden could have plenty more postgame opportunities to explain what went wrong.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the NFL,\u201d Keenum said of the struggles against two stout defenses. \u201cEverybody is good.\u201d\n\nMaybe so. But everybody isn\u2019t good enough.\n\nAt least not good enough to win either of their first two games or last six quarters.\n\n\u2981 Deron Snyder writes his award-winning column for The Washington Times on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
