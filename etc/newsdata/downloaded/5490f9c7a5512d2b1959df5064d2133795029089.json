TD Ameritrade is ending its $6.95 commission on Thursday. Late Wednesday, E-Trade ETFC, +2.10% also said it was ending retail commissions beginning Monday. The commission was $6.95 for the first 29 trades and $4.95 after up to 500 stock or options trades.\n\nThe fast-fading fees are another round in an ongoing race to shrink broker fees. But they also come during a time of stiff market headwinds: There\u2019s the ongoing impeachment inquiry into President Trump, the tariff trade war with China and the drumbeat of a recession lurking somewhere around the corner \u2014 all things that could rattle retail investors.\n\n\u201cIt has the potential to be a disruptive issue,\u201d Kashif Ahmed, the president of American Private Wealth, a Bedford, Mass.-based firm, said of the slashed commissions. \u201cThe market is already delicate, so to speak. On top of that, you throw in people\u2019s ability to trade without consequence.\u201d He added, \u201cActing on no discipline and no cost, it\u2019s a recipe for disaster.\u201d\n\nOthers, speaking before the E-Trade announcement, said their big question now was how Schwab SCHW, +1.62% and TD Ameritrade AMTD, +2.59% would make up the revenue after erasing the commissions.\n\n\u201cA commission is the explicit spread or profit a broker dealer charges,\u201d said Tyler Gellasch, the executive director of Healthy Markets, an investor trade group. \u201cWhen that goes to zero, that naturally means there\u2019s going to have be some other way for them to keep the lights on,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018A commission is the explicit spread or profit a broker dealer charges. When that goes to zero, that naturally means there\u2019s going to have be some other way for them to keep the lights on.\u2019 \u2014Tyler Gellasch, executive director of Healthy Markets\n\nWithout the upfront commission, \u201cit\u2019s hard to assess service and value provided, and harder for market forces to work their ways to benefit investors,\u201d said Micah Hauptman, financial services counsel at the Consumer Federation of America.\n\nBoth Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade emphasized they were lowering investing barriers without sacrificing quality.\n\n\u201cThis is our price. Not a promotion. No catches. Period,\u201d Charles Schwab & Co. CEO Walt Bettinger said in a statement. \u201cPrice should never be a barrier to investing for anyone, whether an experienced investor or someone just starting on the investing path.\u201d\n\nA Schwab spokeswoman said the assets under management rose to $3.72 trillion from around $2.9 trillion in February 2017, the last time the company lowered commissions.\n\nShe pointed to commentary from Peter Crawford, Schwab\u2019s CFO, saying the company has \u201ca business model that doesn\u2019t depend on commission revenue, a long-term orientation and a history of being willing to disrupt ourselves based on client needs and competitive dynamics.\u201d\n\nThe scrapped commissions equaled $90 million to $100 million in quarterly revenue, which is about 3% to 4% of total net revenue, Crawford noted.\n\n\n\nA TD Ameritrade spokeswoman said, \u201cWith $1.3 trillion in client assets, we have scale and a diverse business model with a range of different revenue streams.\u201d She said the company was committed to the \u201cbest execution\u201d of trades and \u201ca consistent, quality and liquid trading experience for our clients.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe firmly believe that investing is a pathway to a better life and are fully committed to providing more people with the access, education, and help they need to confidently navigate and build a more sustainable financial future for themselves and their families,\u201d she said.\n\nThe company has been building up its investor education offerings in the past year, she said, adding, \u201cRelevant information, delivered when our clients could best use it, and in the formats they prefer, increases confidence and empowers rational decision-making.\u201d\n\nBehavioral economics suggests people don\u2019t always make \u2018rational\u2019 money choices\n\nWhile the trading platforms are changing, the people using them stay the same. This could be part of the challenge in avoiding any overtrading and bad bets.\n\nBehavioral economics research says people have an \u201cmental accounting\u201d system where they internally label money for certain activities and won\u2019t replace it with other earmarked money. If someone sets aside $500 a month for stock trading but doesn\u2019t hit the limit, he or she might just keep on trading.\n\nWhile the trading platforms are changing, the people using them stay the same. This could be part of the challenge in avoiding any overtrading and bad bets.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s another behavioral economics theory that could make the case that investors with zero commissions will be cautious. The concept of \u201closs aversion\u201d means \u201closses hurt more than gains feel good,\u201d writes Richard Thaler, a professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business and giant in the behavioral economics field.\n\nOn Wednesday, some financial advisers said the erased commissions wouldn\u2019t unlock the floodgates on ill-advised trades. They noted low-cost trades have been around for years.\n\n\u201cIf the investor is scared due to current headline risk, their innate behavioral biases will likely lead to poor trades anyway,\u201d said Risley Sams, founder and president of RHS Financial in San Francisco. \u201cThe fact that it won\u2019t cost them any commissions is probably not the primary driver.\u201d\n\nOthers welcomed the news on the scrapped commissions.\n\nMike Alves, the managing director and founder of Vida Private Wealth in Pasadena, Calif., said the news would lure more investors. By investing in the market, winning on some bets and losing on others, more consumers could actually become savvy investors \u2014 and better appreciate the services of financial planners like Alves.\n\n\u201cSometimes our job is helping our clients avoid financial mistakes,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I can save you from making a million-dollar mistake, how much is that worth?\u201d\n\nCharles Schwab Corp. shares are down 12% from the start of the year, E-Trade shares are down almost 20% and TD Ameritrade shares are down more than 30%. The S&P 500 SPX, +1.42% is up 15% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.42% is up almost 12% over the same period.", "description": "Financial advisers discuss the real cost of free stock trades.", "authors": ["Andrew Keshner"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS508_tradin_ZG_20191002150850.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
