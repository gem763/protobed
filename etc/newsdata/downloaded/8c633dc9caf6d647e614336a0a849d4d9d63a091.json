Silver said Thursday, \"The financial consequences may go on and be fairly dramatic.\"\n\nLos Angeles Lakers star LeBron James was sharply critical of Morey, telling reporters he \"wasn't educated on the situation at hand and he spoke.\"\n\nJames followed up with a statement on Twitter to say he was referring to the impact felt by those in the league:\n\nESPN's Rachel Nichols reported Silver held a meeting with players from the Brooklyn Nets and Los Angeles when they were in China to play a pair of preseason games. According to Nichols, \"several players\" argued the league likely would've fined or suspended a player who did something to hurt the NBA's bottom line as much as the Hong Kong tweet has.\n\nDave McMenamin of ESPN also reported one Lakers player lost a $1 million endorsement deal with a Chinese company as he was traveling to the country.\n\nMorey didn't intend to spark an international incident but did so anyway. Members of the Rockets and players the team might target in free agency probably won't forget Morey's role in the narrative, which could make his position extremely difficult going forward.", "description": "NBA Commissioner Adam Silver confirmed \"Chinese interests\" asked for the league to fire Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey for his tweet in support of pro-democracy protestors in Hong Kong...", "authors": ["Joseph Zucker"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/833/645/hi-res-60aa494179c20a54ba1903613b71ad6f_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
