Below, CNBC Make It breaks down the two new card offerings, how to apply and the changes current Walmart cardholders can expect. Capital One\u00ae Walmart Rewards Mastercard\u00ae | Source: Capital One\n\nCapital One\u00ae Walmart Rewards Mastercard\u00ae\n\nThe Capital One\u00ae Walmart Rewards Mastercard\u00ae is a cobranded credit card that can be used anywhere Mastercard is accepted. There is no annual fee, no foreign transaction fees and the APR is currently 17.99% to 26.99% variable. Here's the rewards breakdown: 5% back on purchases at Walmart.com, inclusive of Walmart Grocery Pickup and Delivery\n\n2% back on Walmart purchases in stores\n\n2% back on restaurants and travel\n\n1% percent back everywhere else There's also a special introductory offer: Earn 5% back on in-store purchases when using Walmart Pay for the first 12 months after approval. After the intro offer, earn 2% back. Travel purchases include a broad range of categories, such as airlines, hotels, car rentals, ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft, taxi, rail and bus rides, according to Daniel Mouadeb, senior vice president and head of the Walmart partnership at Capital One. Similar to other Capital One credit cards, rewards can be redeemed at any time and for any amount. Redemption options include travel, gift cards, the ability to cash in points during online checkout at Walmart.com and statement credits. Additional card benefits include extended warranty protection, car rental insurance, travel accident insurance, baggage delay insurance, trip cancellation/trip protection insurance, emergency roadside assistance, travel assistance services, price protection and more. Terms apply.\n\nWalmart Rewards Card\n\nThe Walmart Rewards Card is a private-label card, also known as a store card, so you can only use the card at Walmart properties. Just like the Capital One\u00ae Walmart Rewards Mastercard\u00ae, the Walmart Rewards Card has no annual fee and a 17.99% to 26.99% variable APR. Here's the rewards breakdown: 5% back on purchases at Walmart.com and on the Walmart app\n\n2% back on Walmart purchases in stores\n\n2% back at Walmart Fuel Stations, which includes Murphy gas stations Cardholders also receive the 5% introductory offer for using Walmart Pay in stores for the first 12 months after approval (then 2% back).\n\nCredit score requirements\n\nCapital One is known for its transparency with the credit requirements for its credit cards. Mouadeb tells CNBC Make It that these new cards are aimed at consumers across the credit spectrum with broad eligibility for people with good to excellent credit. According to credit bureau Experian, that credit range would represent a FICO Score of 670 or greater. However, it's key to note that Capital One may use another range that's higher or lower than Experian's. On Capital One's website, the company provides credit level guidelines, which may help you gauge your creditworthiness for the Walmart credit cards. Below, we list the credit ranges. Rebuilding credit: You've defaulted on a loan more than once or you've been declined for a credit card in the last three months.\n\nYou've defaulted on a loan more than once or you've been declined for a credit card in the last three months. Average credit : You've defaulted on a loan in the past five years or have limited credit history (you've had a credit card or other credit for less than three years \u2014 including students, people new to the U.S. or authorized users on someone else's credit card).\n\n: You've defaulted on a loan in the past five years or have limited credit history (you've had a credit card or other credit for less than three years \u2014 including students, people new to the U.S. or authorized users on someone else's credit card). Excellent credit: You've never declared bankruptcy or defaulted on a loan; haven't been more than 60 days late on any credit card, medical bill, or loan in the last year and have had a loan or credit card for three years or more with a credit limit above $5,000.\n\nHow to apply for the new cards\n\nThe new cards include various digital-first features that make it convenient to apply, earn and redeem rewards from the palm of your hand. Interested applicants can apply for the card in traditional ways, such as at Walmart.com, CapitalOne.com or within the Walmart app. Walmart and Capital One also created a new mobile application experience where applicants can text to apply from anywhere and complete the application from their mobile devices. If you're approved, simply verify your identity and you'll receive instant access to your card for Walmart purchases. And if you sign up for Walmart Pay or already have an account, you can load the card into the Walmart app for use in-store and on Walmart.com.\n\nHow current Walmart cardholders are affected\n\nStarting October 11, current Walmart cardholders will be converted to the Capital One\u00ae Walmart Rewards Mastercard\u00ae or the Walmart Rewards Card and will start benefiting from the new rewards program. As an added perk, current cardholders are also eligible for the special introductory offer of 5% back on in-store purchases when using Walmart Pay, through October 14, 2020. Expect to receive a new card later this year or early next year. Your card will have the same number, but the expiration date and security code will change. Non-Mastercard\u00ae Walmart cards will no longer be accepted for purchases at Sam's Club.
