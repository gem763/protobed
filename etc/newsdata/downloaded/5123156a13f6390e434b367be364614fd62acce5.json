AP\u2019s report notes the app is active for current users, but it\u2019s not compatible with Android 10.\n\nWe\u2019ve asked Google for a comment, and we\u2019ll update the story once we hear from them.\n\nWith that, the Google graveyard is expanding like a social media company with fresh funding.\n\nEarlier this year, the company killed off Google Inbox; it also nixed a bunch of hardware products this week, including the Daydream VR platform, the original Pixel Buds, and the Google Clips camera.", "description": "", "authors": ["Ivan Mehta"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2017%2F11%2FGoogle-Datally-hed.jpg&signature=6deb0b2d23e1eb0f79044cc74cbc4678", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
