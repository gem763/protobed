(AP) \u2014 The military wants North Dakota and four other states with nuclear missile arsenals to consider introducing new rules aimed at preventing conflicts between wind turbines and helicopters that provide security at launch facilities.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nDepartment of Defense and Air Force officials outlined their concerns in a letter before meeting Tuesday with North Dakota lawmakers and regulatory officials.\n\nLAWMAKERS SEEK TO BAN SOME HELICOPTER FLIGHTS\n\n\"Wind turbine development near launch facilities and missile alert facilities compromise the use of military helicopters to provide overhead security in sensitive locations,\" the letter said.\n\nThe Defense Department last month asked the North Dakota Public Service Commission to consider new rules, including increasing the distance tenfold to more than 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) between a wind turbine and missile launch facility. The military also wants special lighting added to wind towers that is compatible with night-vision goggles worn by the helicopter pilots who patrol the 8,500-square-mile (22,000-square-kilometer) missile field in northern North Dakota.\n\nAIR FORCE'S MYSTERY SPACE PLANE COMPLETES TWO-YEAR MISSION\n\nThe commission, which approves siting permits for wind farms, has not acted on the requests. The Associated Press sought to attend Tuesday's meeting between the military and state lawmakers but was barred after military officials protested.\n\nThe military said it's also \"an issue of concern\" in Montana, Wyoming, Colorado and Nebraska.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nMark Mahoney, the regional environmental coordinator for the Defense Department, told the AP after the meeting that the military would ask other states to also consider the changes proposed in North Dakota.\n\n\"We want consistency,\" he said.\n\nAMAZON MAY SEEK CLOUD REMATCH WITH MICROSOFT AND PENTAGON\n\nTom Vinson, vice president of regulatory affairs for the American Wind Energy Association, said wind developers already work with the Defense Department to mitigate any potential risks from wind farms.\n\n\"We in the wind industry would prefer not to see state legislation,\" Vinson said. \"The federal review process is already robust.\"\n\nVinson said \"one-size-fits-all\" state rules would be overly restrictive and could halt projects.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\n\"There may be ways to mitigate concerns that would allow a project to move forward,\" he said.\n\nVinson said 35% of the nation's wind farms operate within 50 miles (80 kilometers) of a military facility, without harming national security or altering military missions.\n\nTHESE VETERAN JOB PROGRAMS HELP MILITARY MEMBERS TRANSITION INTO THE WORKPLACE AFTER SERVICE\n\nThe Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota is the only U.S. base capable of nuclear strikes by both plane and missile. Minot has one of the nation's two B-52 bomber bases and oversees 150 of the Air Force's 450 Minuteman 3 nuclear missiles.\n\nNorth Dakota ranks 10th among states in wind power output, though it is rated at the top for wind power potential. The state had only a handful of wind turbines at the turn of the century, a number that has grown to more than 1,700 at present, with many located at or near the state's nuclear missile field.", "description": "Department of Defense and Air Force officials outlined their concerns in a letter before meeting Tuesday with North Dakota lawmakers and regulatory officials.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/AP19302559261781.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
