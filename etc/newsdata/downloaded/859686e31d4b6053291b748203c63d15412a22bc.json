As we swept through the New Forest I looked out and saw the woods and heathland that I had so often played in as a child, when my grandparents had lived on the fringes of this most ancient (and inappropriately named) of landscapes.\n\nNana and grandad resided in a village not far from Ringwood, seemingly full of retired people and bungalows. I called it up on Google maps and despite not having been there for nearly thirty years, I recognised immediately the birds-eye road layout. I clicked through to get the street level view and, sure enough, I had alighted on the correct road \u2013 Heather Close \u2013 just one junction along from my grandparents\u2019 home.\n\nThe yellow trim on the bungalow\u2019s garage door and fascia boards had gone, as had a pond and rockery in the back garden. But the little stone birdbath still stood in the gravel driveway and a large rock bearing the name of the house greeted visitors just as it had back in the 1980s, when I would regularly climb it like some sort of miniature mountain.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nI clicked along the street, heading east, then turning to the north. As expected, there was Braeside Bowling Club, where my brother and I had been taught the rudiments of the game even when our hands were barely big enough to hold proper sized bowls. Beyond that lay the park \u2013 with new swings, but located just where it had always been. It all felt utterly familiar, everything in its place.\n\nLater in the journey I had to change trains at Clapham Junction, in the capital\u2019s south-west, the stomping ground of my twenties. With 25 minutes to spare I left the station \u2013 via an exit which hadn\u2019t been in use when I was last there \u2013 and walked up St John\u2019s Hill to see the flat I\u2019d lived in for a year back in 2004.\n\nOn both sides of the bridge over the railway things seemed different. There were not only blocks of flats I didn\u2019t recognise but road junctions were not laid out as I remembered them. The old telephone exchange was still there, but on the south side shops appeared to have sprung from nowhere \u2013 yet they must have been there before, given that they filled the lower floor of large Victorian mansion blocks.\n\nOur flat itself was mostly unaltered from the outside, though I couldn\u2019t help but notice the fresh coat of paint and the rather nicer furnishings just glimpsable through the window. A couple of nearby pubs were still in business, but none of the restaurants I had known were still operating \u2013 at least, not under the same names.\n\nAs I made my way back to the station, I felt bewildered that in a place I had lived for an entire year as an adult, I now had such little sense of recognition, while in one I had visited perhaps three times a year during my childhood, I felt complete familiarity (albeit through the window of a computer screen).\n\nIt must, I thought, be a product of that gut memory which so often seems to be associated with our earliest years, when instinct can overtake all else; whereas my recall of Clapham was evidently less impressive than I thought it would be.\n\nBut then I realised that in fact my recollections were not erroneous, it was simply that a sleepy village in Dorset had stood still for thirty years, whereas a bustling London suburb had been transformed in little more than a decade.\n\nSometimes our memories can appear to play tricks on us; but the deception doesn\u2019t always lie in the past.", "description": "A week or so ago, I was travelling by train between Bournemouth and London.
