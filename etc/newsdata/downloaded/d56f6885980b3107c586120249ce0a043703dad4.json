Now she\u2019s found success in both worlds.", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nAuthor and screenwriter Attica Locke on a porch in San Jacinto County, Tex., where her protagonist Texas Ranger Darren Mathews is from. (Tembi Locke)\n\nAttica Locke always wanted to make movies, and for a while, that seemed to be her destiny. At just 25, after writing and directing fellowships at the Sundance Lab, she had a movie deal. But things fell apart, as they often do in Hollywood, and she ended up a screenwriter for hire in Los Angeles, where the frustrations continued. There was no appetite for her voice, she says, and nobody wanted to make the movies she was interested in.\n\n\u201cIt was difficult to monetize my blackness,\u201d she says now.\n\nNot anymore. With her fifth crime novel, \u201cHeaven, My Home,\u201d coming out this month, she\u2019s proved that there\u2019s demand for stories about black characters, not just on the page but on the screen. It took her walking away from Hollywood to find success there: After three seasons of writing for the hit show \u201cEmpire,\u201d she\u2019s also working on the buzzy upcoming series adaptation of Celeste Ng\u2019s \u201cLittle Fires Everywhere.\u201d\n\nThis is a far cry from where she was more than a decade ago, when she was taking out a second mortgage on her house and giving herself a year to become a novelist.\n\nHer debut, \u201cBlack Water Rising,\u201d was published in 2009 to critical acclaim and was followed by \u201cThe Cutting Season\u201d (2012) and \u201cPleasantville\u201d (2015). Her books, categorized as mystery or crime, are also unabashedly about black experiences, examining the legacy of black history in the context of modern politics and culture. The crime she really concerns herself with is an existential one: the legacy of America\u2019s original sin.\n\nThe protagonists in her novels are mostly black men, and she writes with the authenticity of a lived experience. \u201cThe greatest wounds I\u2019ve had in my life have been because I\u2019m black not because I\u2019m a woman, that\u2019s normally secondary,\u201d she says. \u201cI felt like I wanted to tell a story about race and for me, for whatever reason, stripping gender out made it easier.\u201d\n\nBut a funny thing happened while she was carving out her career as a novelist. \u201cEverything that I was trying to do in movies \u2014 you know, grown-up stuff and deep character work with sociopolitical themes and all this kind of stuff \u2014 all of that work moved to television,\u201d she says.\n\nAmong that new crop of TV shows was 2015\u2019s \u201cEmpire,\u201d the musical drama about the Lyon family, a clan of hip-hop and entertainment moguls. It was a high-end soap opera that combined the bling of \u201cDynasty\u201d with the psychological drama of \u201cKing Lear,\u201d and it was a smash hit.\n\nWhen Academy Award-nominated director and producer Lee Daniels was creating the show, he wanted not just great writers but \u201cAfrican American voices that understood sort of the world I created.\u201d\n\nOne look at a sample script from Locke, and he knew he\u2019d found just such a voice. She \u201cblew me away,\u201d he says, \u201cand I was blown away by who she was as a person, as a woman, as a writer, and it was a love affair from that point on.\u201d\n\nWhat drew Locke to \u201cEmpire\u201d was her interest in telling a different black story: \u201cHow do you go from a working-class existence to being a mega mega mega millionaire?\u201d she says. \u201cAnd how do you navigate the newness of that wealth?\u201d\n\nAccording to Daniels, Locke was especially adept at channeling the voice of matriarch Cookie Lyon, a standout character played by Taraji P. Henson, who won a Golden Globe for her portrayal. \u201cWhen I think of Attica, I think of the voice of Cookie,\u201d Daniels says. He admits that Locke saved him more than once, fighting for a nuanced portrayal that, according to her, was more mother and less gangster.\n\nLocke describes her three seasons as a writer and producer on \u201cEmpire\u201d as \u201cthe most fun thing I\u2019ve ever done\u201d but novel writing never left her, and the experience of television\u2019s episodic storytelling gave her the confidence to start a book series set along Texas\u2019s Highway 59. Locke spent her childhood traveling the rural byways of that stretch, visiting relatives in Lufkin, Corrigan and Marshall, looking out the window on vistas of swamps and creeks, on rural folks selling boiled peanuts and peach jam.\n\nLocke\u2019s early books focused on big city politics in her hometown of Houston, clearly inspired by her own father\u2019s run for mayor there. But Highway 59 \u201cfeels like a vein in my body,\u201d Locke says. \u201cIt\u2019s where my entire family comes from.\u201d\n\n[\u2018Bluebird, Bluebird\u2019: No black-and-white answers in this tale of race and murder]\n\nFor many black Americans that route represented a way out of Texas, especially during the Great Migration, a road to the urban promise of St. Louis or Chicago. But Locke\u2019s family didn\u2019t leave and neither did the family of her protagonist, Texas Ranger Darren Matthews. Locke first introduced the character in \u201cBluebird, Bluebird\u201d in 2017 as a lawman who has a conflicted relationship with the law, because, as a black man, the law is conflicted about him. Of the state\u2019s elite unit of 150 or so rangers, a mere handful are minorities.\n\nMatthews\u2019s case in \u201cHeaven, My Home\u201d again centers on white supremacy; he\u2019s called in to track down a missing 9-year-old, the son of a convicted Aryan Brotherhood member.\n\nLocke\u2019s setting, after the election of 2016, can feel both like a bygone time and a reflection of the current moment when racial violence feels \u201clike a ghostly relative in a daguerreotype that has always been there but was now impossible to ignore,\u201d she writes in the book. This is a place where the n-word is used freely, and Matthews\u2019s badge is no shield against racism. \u201cHe felt as if he\u2019d wandered into a movie set,\u201d Locke writes in \u201cHeaven.\u201d \u201cHe could see the actors, but Darren was reflected in none of the action around him.\u201d\n\nShe captures the acute challenge of being a black man in America, regardless of education, title or pedigree. But her first job she says \u201cis as a storyteller.\u201d Entertainment value is paramount, and she manages to deliver it while also immersing readers in a world where the wound of America\u2019s racial history is raw, infected and resistant to treatment.\n\nIt\u2019s a skill she continues to bring to television as well.\n\nAva DuVernay sought her out to write for the Emmy-nominated Netflix drama about the Central Park Five, \u201cWhen They See Us.\u201d And the adaptation of Ng\u2019s \u201cLittle Fires Everywhere\u201d hits Hulu in 2020.\n\nNg is a little surprised that she doesn\u2019t feel more defensive about having another writer interpret her novel but part of it, she says, is because Locke is a \u201cbook person.\u201d\n\nLocke brings an important perspective, too. Kerry Washington plays one of the key protagonists in the show, a character who is ethnically ambiguous in the book. Ng appreciates that Locke can provide the details about the life of a black woman in ways that Ng would never have been able to.\n\nLocke is clearly having a moment, though fans of her novels need not worry about her rising profile in television. \u201cHeaven, My Home\u201d ends on another cliffhanger, so we\u2019ll undoubtedly be hearing from Ranger Matthews again soon.\n\nMadhulika Sikka is The Washington Post\u2019s executive producer for audio.", "description": "Her fifth book, \u201cHeaven, My Home,\u201d is on the horizon along with her TV adaptation of Celeste Ng\u2019s \u201cLittle Fires Everywhere.\u201d", "authors": ["Madhulika Sikka", "Executive Producer For Audio", "September At Am", "Madhulika Sikka Joined The Washington Post In September To Lead The Creation Of A Daily Flagship Podcast.
