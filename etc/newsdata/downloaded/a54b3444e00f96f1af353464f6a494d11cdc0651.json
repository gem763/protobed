Amid concerns for their welfare, Vunipola acknowledged that the cancellation of a rugby match \u2013 even a World Cup fixture \u2013 was put in perspective by an unfolding natural disaster.\n\nEngland's Pool C encounter with France in Yokohama was called off on Thursday as tournament officials made emergency arrangements ahead of the arrival of the 'violent' typhoon \u2013 set to be the biggest to sweep through this country for 61 years.\n\nMako Vunipola revealed he is praying for safety of his family and friends who are still in Tokyo\n\nEddie Jones and his squad were able to flee the capital and return to their pre-tournament retreat on the island of Kyushu, but many of those who had come to support them had stayed in Tokyo.\n\n'Yeah, we have families and friends there,' said the older Vunipola brother on Saturday, after coming through an intensive training session. 'That was probably the hardest thing to deal with; realising that the game wouldn't be on and trying to make plans for them.\n\n'But Japan are pretty used to typhoons and they have regulations to deal with it, so it's just a case of them doing as they're told and us hoping and praying that they're safe. We are very lucky to be here and I just hope everyone is safe.'\n\nTokyo and near Prefectures have suffered tremendous damage from Super Typhoon Hagibis\n\nMako revealed that his partner had visited him and returned home already, but his and Billy's father, Fe'ao \u2013 the former Tonga captain \u2013 had arrived in Tokyo for the France game which had been abandoned.\n\nVarious cousins and aunts had flown over too. Fe'ao will stay for the quarter-final against Australia in Oita next Saturday, but for now he and other relatives remain in Tokyo, in the eye of the storm.\n\n'They are still there,' said Mako. 'As I said, I am pretty sure Japan can deal with it. It is just trying to make sure they are safe and follow what they are told. We're just talking to them as much as we can. We have finished training and I have only just found out that the typhoon has hit quite big, so I will talk to them and see how they are.\n\n'It is worrying, but we're lucky \u2013 we're pretty sheltered from a lot of that. I didn't realise how big or how bad the typhoon was going to be until we got told the news. It shows how much we've been focusing on the job in hand. Now I just hope the damage isn't too much and people are okay.\n\n'Obviously you're focused on rugby but you know it's not the be-all and end-all, especially when you see things like this (typhoon). You worry for people's safety in typhoons and you hope and pray that nothing serious does happen.'\n\nEngland's scheduled Pool C game against France was called off due to the raging typhoon\n\nVunipola spoke of the sense of logistical 'chaos' in the hours after it emerged that England v France had been cancelled \u2013 along with the New Zealand v Italy fixture. He is seeking to regain match sharpness after a long recovery from hamstring injuries, so losing the chance of valuable on-field action is not ideal, ahead of a last-eight clash with the Wallabies.\n\n'I wanted to play as much as I can, to get a bit more game-time under my belt. But you can't control these things and it's pretty serious. We'd had a tough day in training on Wednesday so personally, I was a bit gutted because I'd worked hard.\n\n'You want to be playing obviously, as much as you can, but I am not that concerned about it in terms of the way we train.\n\n'You should have seen me out there today \u2013 I was sucking in seagulls (breathing hard)! They definitely push you in training so if I am involved next week, I know I'll be ready to play.'\n\nIt is unclear at this stage whether his brother will be ready too. Billy was a by-stander for most of training on Saturday, as he attempts to regain full fitness after twisting his ankle in the win over Argentina.\n\nHe and Jack Nowell were the only ones not fully involved, but Mako said: 'Billy is good. He did a bit of hopping on Friday and (on Saturday) he did a bit more. Maybe a bit of running. He's in good spirits and confident he'll be available for selection next week.'", "description": "CHRIS FOY IN MIYAZAKI: England\u00a0are out of harm's way here in the far south of Japan, but Mako Vunipola revealed that players are praying for loved ones left behind in Tokyo.", "authors": ["Chris Foy For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/21/19634192-0-image-a-57_1570913373315.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
