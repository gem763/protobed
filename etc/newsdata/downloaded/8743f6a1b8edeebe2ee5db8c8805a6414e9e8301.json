The good news is that you don\u2019t have to spend a fortune on a heater or its maintenance to raise the temperature effectively.\n\nWhen choosing, have a think about how quickly you\u2019ll need to feel the heat \u2013 a fan or ceramic heater is going to be more efficient in a smaller space, working quickly to take the bite off that chill.\n\nIf you have a cavernous space and you need to heat for longer periods of time, your best bet may an oil-filled model which will maintain your chosen level of warmth and retain heat when you choose to turn it off.\n\nAll the models we tested here were easy to move from room to room and though not the most glamorous thing you\u2019ll ever buy for your home, we\u2019ve chosen a selection that score on the style front, too.\n\n\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

This Norwegian radiator looks good in any setting and the vertical shape means it\u2019s unobtrusive in small spaces. We particularly liked the settings via the Mill Heat app for remote activation.\n\nBuy now\n\nDyson pre hot + cool purifying fan heater: \u00a3549, Dyson\n\nToo chilly to sleep? If it seems like five minutes ago it was just too hot to sleep then this is the model for you. Expensive, yes, but it gets room temperature just right, all year round with both fan and heat settings. What\u2019s more it\u2019ll improves the air quality thanks to its carbon filter which is great news for asthmatics and hay fever sufferers. The output is impressive in heating mode, quickly directing a jet of warm air into (or oscillating 350 degrees around) the room. In a world of ugly portables, this is beautiful to look at and can be controlled with its remote or via the Dyson app too.\n\nBuy now\n\nDimplex OFC2000ti oil filled radiator: \u00a369, AO\n\nWith the look of a traditional portable radiator, this fuss-free model is perfect for cosying up a larger room that needs a long-term source of heat. The smooth castors make it easy to move around and we especially like the cable tidy for safe storage and the timer remote control, so it could be turned off when it hit the right temperature and we didn\u2019t want to move from our sofa den.\n\nBuy now\n\nJohn Lewis & Partners electric heater: \u00a370, John Lewis & Partners\n\nSleek and glossy, this can sit in any room discreetly although you may find visitors mistake it for a TV thanks to its glass \u201cscreen\u201d. This convection heater can be set to go on and off at chosen times and shows its temperature on a digital panel on its front. Our tester found it easy and light to take from room to room, although, just like a telly, she got frustrated with fingerprint marks all over it. The heat radiating from the vented back worked well in a medium-sized room.\n\nBuy now\n\nDe\u2019Longhi slim style HCX3124FS radiator: \u00a382.99, Amazon\n\nThis is a good-looking panel convector heater that\u2019s perfect for occasional use in the bedroom or smaller living room. At only 7.5 cm wide, there is also the option to mount it on the wall via the included brackets rather than as a stand-alone unit. It has a a choice of settings from low to plus, where the highest output is supplemented by an integral fan, so it\u2019s easy to find the perfect set up for even the coldest of days.\n\nBuy now\n\nBeldray digital plug in heater: \u00a317.85, Amazon\n\nThis chunky plug-in heater is great for small areas such as the kitchen or study. Our tester plugged it in straight to the socket by his desk when working from home and stayed toasty all day, with the initial warm-up period surprisingly quick. Using a heated ceramic element, the housing on this model stayed cool to the touch when he wanted to unplug. A great little extra to move around the house when needed.\n\nBuy now\n\nDe\u2019Longhi dragon4 TRD4 0820T: \u00a3119.99, Amazon\n\nWe used this oil-filled radiator to heat a large living room normally kept toasty with a woodburner on chilly nights. It heated quickly and made a real difference to the ambient temperature faster than we expected. Heavier than most of the other models we tried out, the Dragon4 is a really great choice for those in need of a permanent heating solution rather than a little-used booster. De\u2019Longhi gives a ten-year guarantee on this model, too.\n\nBuy now\n\nDimplex DXSTG25 studio G ceramic heater: \u00a384.95, Amazon\n\nThis is a tall heater heat our testers\u2019 large sunroom quickly on a bright, chilly morning. Looking slightly more \u201chigh end\u201d than other boxy heaters on test. This model, like the far more expensive Dyson, could oscillate, to distribute heat efficiently with its fan. Sadly, the lowest setting was still warm, meaning it wouldn\u2019t be any good as a cooler in the summer months. We liked the remote control and easy-to-set timer and thought this looked far more expensive than its price tag suggested.\n\nBuy now\n\nGoodHome 1500W Oil Free Radiator, \u00a376, B&Q\n\nUsing less energy than an oil-filled equivalent this 2000W dry inertia heater has a handy retractable handle and sturdy wheels, to make shifting it a cinch. Face it, a radiator is never going to be the loveliest thing to look at, but there\u2019s something about the styling of this one that\u2019s easier on the eye than most. It performed well in a small sitting room, heating evenly and proving easy to programme for timed toastiness.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Portable heaters\n\nThe Dyson hot + cool is a lovely piece of kit, but there are other combinations of heater and fan that could cost less, if not compete with its sleek looks. If budget isn\u2019t a big consideration, then it\u2019s the perfect, hassle-free way to heat, cool and regulate air quality.\n\nThat said, for the second year running the Mill Heat portable heater has really warmed our cockles. We love the looks and its remote activation, so it gets our Best Buy award once again.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
