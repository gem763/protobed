Once the final stage is rolled out, nearly all prescriptions will be sent electronically.\n\nUnder the system, patients can get their medications by either nominating a pharmacy that will receive the details directly from their GP or receive a paper prescription with the digital barcode.\n\nPaper prescriptions will continue to be available for those who rely on them.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nThe initiative will see medical information held on a secure NHS database called Spine which will allow a patient\u2019s prescription to be accessed quickly by GPs and pharmacies.\n\nThe EPS is expected to save the NHS \u00a3300million by 2021 by increasing efficiencies, reducing the amount of paper processing and prescribing errors, the DHSC said.\n\nInstead of using a physical signature patients will be allowed to digitally sign and cancel electronic prescriptions.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nThe department said the system would reduce the amount of administration needed around prescriptions, and the volume of prescriptions that need to be stored.\n\n\"Digitising the entire prescription service is a key part of keeping up the drive to make the NHS fit for the 21st century. This will free up vital time for GPs and allow pharmacists to spend more time with their patients, and save millions of pounds a year,\" Jo Churchill said.\n\n\"It\u2019s another important step towards eventually making all prescriptions paperless. We are continuing to improve technology across the NHS, which will ultimately improve care for patients.\"\n\nDr Ian Lowry, the director of digital medicines and pharmacy at NHS Digital, said: \"Every prescription that is sent electronically saves money for the NHS by increasing efficiency. The system is also safer and more secure, as prescriptions can\u2019t be lost and clinicians can check their status online.\n\n\"This is a huge milestone to reach, and one which benefits patients, GPs, pharmacists and the NHS as a whole.\"", "description": "A digital prescription service will be rolled out across England after a trial run in 60 GP practices and hundreds of pharmacies", "authors": ["Emma Munbodh", "Image", "Getty", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article16482498.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_NHS-uniform.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
