We let ourselves be drawn into a dirty game.\u201d\n\nIt was a bruising encounter in Puglia.\n\nArgentina forward Gonzalo Higuain suffered a nasty knock to his forehead late in the game after colliding with Lecce\u2019s Brazilian goalkeeper Gabriel.\n\nThe 31-year-old sat down on the pitch after the game suffering from dizziness and was stretchered off, later receiving stitches to his forehead.\n\nMiralem Pjanic and Rodrigo Bentancur also suffered knocks.\n\nDybala, who scored both goals against the Russians last Wednesday, started up front alongside Higuain, with Federico Bernardeschi slotting in just behind the Argentine strike duo.\n\nSarri rang the changes giving starts to Emre Can and Danilo with Blaise Matuidi and Juan Cuadrado both named on the bench.\n\n\u2013 Conte worried \u2013\n\nHiguain looked as if he had scored the opener after a quarter of an hour, finishing off Alex Sandro\u2019s cross, but the goal was ruled out for offside.\n\nDybala put Juventus ahead five minutes into the second half with his sixth goal in five games.\n\nBut captain Mancosu pulled his side back level from the spot six minutes later after a Matthijs De Ligt handball.\n\n\u201cWe needed to be a bit more determined and clinical after we scored,\u201d said Sarri.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t like the way we played after taking the lead -\u2013 we sat back too much.\u201d\n\nInter, meanwhile, looked sluggish after their 2-0 Champions League win over Borussia Dortmund three days ago.\n\nAntonio Candreva added to his European goal last week with his deflected shot putting the hosts ahead after 23 minutes in front of a crowd of 67,000 in the San Siro.\n\nBut Parma were ahead seven minutes later when on-loan forward Yann Karamoh equalised and then set up Gervinho for a second on the half hour mark against his parent club.\n\nRomelu Lukaku grabbed a point for Inter after 51 minutes with the goal, his sixth in nine games, confirmed after long consultation with VAR.\n\nInter coach Conte said he was concerned by his lack of back-up with key players including forward Alexis Sanchez and midfielder Stefano Sensi out injured.\n\n\u201cThis was our third match in six days and practically the same players have taken to the pitch,\u201d said the former Chelsea and Juventus boss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a little worried, as there are another four games before the next break.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going through a period where we\u2019re unable to make changes and there\u2019s therefore an increased risk of injuries.\u201d\n\nParma are seventh.\n\nThiago Motta got off to a winning start as Genoa coach with a come-from-behind 3-1 win over Brescia in a match where all of his team\u2019s goals came from second-half substitutes, a first in Serie A history.\n\nColombian Kevin Agudelo pulled the westerners level after 66 minutes on his Serie A debut. Christian Kouame acrobatically added a second on 75 minutes and Goran Pandev, who previously played alongside Motta at Inter Milan, adding the third four minutes later.\n\nFormer Italy international Motta played for a season with Genoa a decade ago, but his only previous coaching experience was with PSG\u2019s U19 team, which he managed until July.\n\nGenoa move out of the relegation zone after their second win of the season and first since September 1.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Cristiano Ronaldo stayed at home as Juventus battled to a 1-1 stalemate at lowly Lecce on Saturday, but the defending champions still stay top in Serie A as nearest rivals Inter Milan", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arysports.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/5ade15a836ddc756ef8317636bbb1b5ac9acef5d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
