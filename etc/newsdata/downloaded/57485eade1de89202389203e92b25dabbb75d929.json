Others bore scars down their backs.\n\n\"The victims were abused. Some of them said they were sodomised by their teachers,\" Sabo stated.\n\nPolice had been tipped off by complaints from local residents who became suspicious of what was happening inside the school.\n\nDuring the raid on the school, police said they found a \"torture chamber\" where students were chained, hung and beaten.\n\nLocal police chief Ali Janga said that despite its claims to be an educational institution, the conditions proved that the facility was \"neither a rehab (centre) or an Islamic school\".\n\nThose held there \"were used, dehumanised, you can see it yourself\", Janga said.\n\nPrivate Islamic schools are common in mainly Muslim northern Nigeria, where government services are often lacking.\n\n- 'Severe punishment' -\n\nOne inmate quoted by Nigerian media described horrific conditions and treatment at the facility.\n\n\"I have spent three months here with chains on my legs,\" 42-year-old Bello Hamza said, adding that he was meant to be in South Africa studying for his Masters degree.\n\n\"This is supposed to be an Islamic centre, but trying to run away from here attracts severe punishment; they tie people and hang them to the ceiling for that.\"\n\nAnother victim Hassan Yusuf told AFP that he had been sent to the centre two years ago because he had converted to Christianity.\n\n\"They keep you incommunicado, you can't talk to anybody,\" the married father said.\n\nTelevision footage showed emaciated children being loaded into minivans and driven away for processing.\n\nPolice said the victims were of varying nationalities and that some had been brought from countries in the region including Burkina Faso, Mali and Ghana.\n\nThe victims were taken to a camp on the outskirts of Kaduna where their identities were being documented to determine where they came from and to contact their families.\n\nParents of some of the victims from within the city, contacted by police were \"shocked and horrified\" when they saw the condition of their children, as they had no idea what was happening inside the school.\n\nParents were allowed to visit their children every three months, but only in select areas of the premises.\n\n\"They were not allowed into the house to see what was happening... the children are only brought to them outside to meet them,\" Sabo said.\n\n\"All they thought was their children are being taught the Koran and good manners as they looked subdued,\" he added.\n\nOne of the men allegedly running the facility insisted to local television channels that the centre was simply teaching Islamic studies and that those chained up were \"the stubborn ones who attempt to run away\".", "description": "Police in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna have rescued more than 300 male students being held at an Islamic school where many had been tortured and sexually abused, a police spokesman said Friday.
