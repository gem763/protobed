It was awful. It made me feel sick.\n\n\u201cI then heard the sirens. The police arrived within minutes and then the first responder arrived. As I left I saw more emergency services arriving. I just hope he is going to be OK.\u201d\n\nAnother witness, Paul Hodgkinson, 44, said: \u201cI was stood here, by the old bus station, when a man on top of the double roller coaster just stepped off and went straight down.\n\n\u201cHe was obviously in a bad way.\n\n\u201cHe never had a harness on.\n\n\u201cThe air ambulance came but he went in the land ambulance.\n\n\u201cIt was a shocking thing to see. The sound of the thud is not something you want to hear.\n\n\u201cHe was screaming at first but then it just went quiet.\u201d\n\nFrank Dale, 66, added: \u201cI just came to have a look at them putting up the fairground and then that happened. It left me shocked.\n\n\u201cIt was poor from a health and safety point of view. He was not wearing a harness. If he had been he would have still been on there.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s hope he is OK.\u201d", "description": "Shocked witnesses say the man wasn't wearing a safety harness when he \"wobbled and fell\" at the Winter Wonderland fairground site which is under construction in Stoke-on-Trent", "authors": ["Louise Elliott", "Jonathan Bamber", "Chris Kitching"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20656481.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_THP_CHP_191019Slug_11035JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
