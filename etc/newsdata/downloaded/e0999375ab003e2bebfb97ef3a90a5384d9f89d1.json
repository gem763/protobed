My mother\u2019s memories of the convent also include being required to use a medieval self-flagellation device she and the other sisters called \u201cthe discipline.\u201d My father\u2019s classmates in seminary included several of the most notorious of Boston\u2019s pedophile clergy. Is it any wonder they began to ask to what else their faith might aspire?\n\nMy parents\u2019 anniversary is an admittedly arbitrary date from which to look back over a half-century of Catholic history, but it happens also to coincide with a moment of widespread re-evaluation of the place of priests and nuns in the broader culture, in the United States and around the world.\n\nIn the cover story of the June issue of The Atlantic, another former Boston priest, the writer James Carroll, called for the abolition of the priesthood, blaming its culture of clericalism as the root cause of the church\u2019s continuing crisis. On the latest season of the Amazon/BBC Series \u201cFleabag,\u201d a fraught affair between a sassy atheist and a \u201chot priest,\u201d as the internet calls him, leads to perhaps the frankest conversations about celibacy ever in a romantic comedy. The spring announcement that the gothic horror film \u201cThe Nun\u201d would have a sequel suggests that the word alone is considered sufficiently terror-inducing for not one but two big-screen scream fests, while a recent social experiment called Nuns and Nones put decidedly unfrightening elderly Catholic sisters in conversation with religiously unaffiliated millennials who admire the former\u2019s dedication to activism.\n\nViewed side by side, these varied examinations and representations reveal a deep ambivalence: The priest might be cast as the key to the church\u2019s failings or an answer to secular prayers; the nun is a figure fit for nightmares but also a potential role model for those seeking order in their lives.\n\nPopular culture remains haunted by priests and nuns in a way that its audiences\u2019 adherence to, indifference toward or rejection of Catholic doctrines does not fully explain. Priests and nuns remain, for many, symbols simultaneously of what was and what might be. Their symbolic significance endures even as their numbers fall and the meaning of their vocations, to Catholics and non-Catholics alike, continues to shift.\n\nThis re-evaluation is not just an American phenomenon. When South American church leaders gather in Rome this fall for the Synod of Bishops for the Pan-Amazon Region, they will consider allowing married men to be ordained as priests to address the shortage of Catholic clergy in an area home to tens of millions of people. While some wonder whether this might eventually provide a template the Vatican could follow elsewhere, in other places where the church is growing as the ranks of clergy fall, would-be married priests are not waiting for official sanction. The priests of Kenya\u2019s breakaway Renewed Universal Catholic Church, for example, are guided by a desire to keep their Catholic identity without forgoing marriage or resorting to the \u201csecret families\u201d they say many supposed celibates maintain.\n\nCatholic sisters around the world are also now being seen in a new light. Scandals like those involving the abuse committed at the Magdalene laundries in Ireland on the one hand, and, on the other, the abuse suffered by nuns at the hands of priests and bishops recently acknowledged by Pope Francis, have allowed figures too often caricatured as parochial school despots or cardboard saints to be more fully understood.", "description": "My parents may not get to see the transformation of Catholicism they dreamed of when they married 50 years ago, but some changes are underway.", "authors": ["Peter Manseau"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/01/opinion/sunday/01manseau/01manseau-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
