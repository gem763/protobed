For the first two years of the Trump administration, he was one of a handful of high-ranking figures who more or less openly pitched themselves as necessary checks on an impulsive, childish, and ignorant president. Six months into Trump\u2019s presidency, for instance, Axios reported that Mattis and then-Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly had made a pact that one of them had to be in the United States at all times, presumably for the purpose of stopping the president from doing something dangerous. Given the reports that trickle out every few hours these days\u2014a recent story about Trump asking the National Security Council to look into using nuclear bombs to disperse hurricanes is only slightly crazier than the median leak\u2014one must imagine that Mattis, who served as Secretary of Defense, had a better sense of the president\u2019s fitness for office than just about anyone else in the country.\n\nBut that is not the story that Mattis is going to tell, even as he promotes his new memoir, Call Sign Chaos. In that book, he writes \u201cI\u2019m old fashioned. I don\u2019t write about sitting presidents.\u201d According to NPR, he mentions Trump by name only four times, all in the first two pages of the prologue. Instead, he opts for mealy-mouthed clich\u00e9, writing soaring but vague prose about the need to protect democracy from tribalism and other threats. A recent excerpt in The Wall Street Journal could be considered a subtweet if you squint a bit. Mostly, it reveals the failure, during the early Trump administration, of the so-called adults in the room, a group that never had the tools or the courage to restrain a corrupt and erratic president.\n\nWhen he picked Mattis as his defense secretary nominee in December of 2016, Trump thought he was getting General Patton, or perhaps more likely, a character from one of the ultraviolent action movies the president is fond of. Trump reveled in Mattis\u2019s nickname \u201cMad Dog,\u201d repeatedly citing it at rallies and, at one point, claiming to have coined it. For Trump, the moniker was a sign that he had hired a killer, someone who would do whatever it took to get things done. Instead of \u201cMad Dog,\u201d however, Trump got something different: a temperate, thoughtful commander who saw it as his duty to preserve the country\u2019s relationships with its allies while the president pissed them away. By the end of Mattis\u2019s time in the Pentagon, Trump was calling him \u201cModerate Dog\u201d\u2014proof, if any more were needed, that the president\u2019s supposed mastery of nicknames is greatly exaggerated.\n\n\n\nIn the Journal excerpt, you do get a glimpse behind the curtain, a sense of what Mattis was advocating during his time as head of the Department of Defense. There are pleas for cooperation with allies and a return to the alliances that Trump has repeatedly slammed for being too costly. \u201cWise leadership requires collaboration; otherwise, it will lead to failure,\u201d Mattis writes. \u201cNations with allies thrive, and those without them wither. Alone, America cannot protect our people and our economy.\u201d\n\n", "description": "Jim Mattis was said to be one of the grown-ups protecting the country from Trump's worst impulses.
