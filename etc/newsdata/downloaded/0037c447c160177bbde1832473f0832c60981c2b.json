The FBI\u2019s Chicago office is \u201cassisting at the request of local law enforcement,\u201d spokeswoman Siobhan Johnson said in a statement to The Washington Post.\n\n\u201cThere is no known threat to public safety,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nVideos and posts on Twitter from people at the popular Woodfield Mall in suburban Schaumburg at the time revealed a chaotic scene. Witnesses told CBS Chicago that the black Chevrolet Trailblazer drove through a mall entrance by the Sears department store and then into the middle of the large indoor mall. One person told CBS that the driver was navigating the car \u201clike you would a shopping cart.\u201d\n\nAt one point, the vehicle paused in front of a Forever 21 store, then it moved on \u2014 just as a panicked man in a blue button-down ran in the opposite direction.\n\nSo this just happened at Woodfield. I\u2019m safe.

Several stores had reportedly been placed on lockdown. No major injuries were reported.\n\nPlease avoid the @WoodfieldMall area due to increased police presence from the incident that occurred at the mall at approximately 2:43pm. pic.twitter.com/V9g3KrmgLX \u2014 Village of Schaumburg (@SchaumburgIL) September 20, 2019\n\nA video posted to social media by another mallgoer, Gloria Desiato, documented the initial moments of the scene.\n\nSo this video was taken today at @WoodfieldMall I was walking, talking to my bf on snap and if you watch the whole thing you will hear the car crashing into the front of sears and people screaming pic.twitter.com/c6UjwVWd3B \u2014 Gloria (@princess_8435) September 20, 2019\n\nIn the video, Desiato is Snapchatting her boyfriend when loud screeching noises and several screams can be heard. The car had just crashed into the front of the Sears store, Desiato later explained on Twitter.\n\nThinking the loud noise was the sound of gunshots, she raced to her car in the parking lot and sped off.\n\n\u201cMy instinct was to get as far away as possible,\u201d she said. \u201cI think Woodfield Mall is a safe zone for a lot of people \u2014 it\u2019s a normal mall, that\u2019s why I felt comfortable being there alone \u2014 and that\u2019s why this is just so shocking.\u201d", "description": "Videos and posts on Twitter from people at Woodfield Mall in Schaumburg, Ill., revealed a chaotic scene.", "authors": ["Hannah Natanson", "Reporter Covering Social Issues In The D.C.
