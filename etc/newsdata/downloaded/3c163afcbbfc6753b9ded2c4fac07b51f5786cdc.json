At this point, the market looks very likely to continue to be a bit erratic, as we are sitting just below the \u00a5135 level, an area that had seen a massive selloff previously. The fact that we have done that tells me that we are going to do one of two things in the short term: we will either break down or are we will grind sideways and try to digest the overbought conditions.\n\nGBP/JPY Video 18.09.19\n\nLooking at the chart, if we were to break above the \u00a5135.50 level, then it\u2019s very likely that the market could go much higher, perhaps towards the 200 day EMA above which is painted in black and currently hanging about the \u00a5138 level. Also of interest in that area is the fact that there is the 50% Fibonacci retracement level which of course attracts a lot of attention in and of itself. While I do recognize that the British pound has been rather explosive as of late, the reality is that this pair is highly sensitive to risk appetite and it\u2019s very likely that the markets will have something to worry about soon enough to send this market back down. If we were to break down below the lows of the Monday session I would assume that the market would eventually try to take out the Friday candlestick, and then perhaps reach down towards the \u00a5132 level.\n\nPlease let us know what you think in the comments below\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n\nMore From FXEMPIRE:", "description": "The British pound did very little during the trading session on Tuesday, as we continue to hang about where we gapped down to on Monday.
