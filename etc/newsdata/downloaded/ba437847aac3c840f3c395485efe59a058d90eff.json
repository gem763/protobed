It Was Terrible.", "language": "en", "text": "Photo: Caitlin Ochs/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nLate last month, WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann stepped down from his position as CEO. He\u2019d had a tumultuous two weeks. WeWork (officially called the We Company) had delayed its IPO and reportedly saw its valuation cut by at least $32 billion. While Neumann\u2019s resignation is far from the end of WeWork, reports that the new co-CEO\u2019s plan to cut the company\u2019s extraneous businesses, like WeGrow and WeLive, means it is surely the end of Neumann\u2019s dream of creating \u201ca new way of living, day to day, week to week, month to month, year to year.\u201d\n\nNow, I decided, was my last chance to experience Neumann\u2019s WeWorld, or at least get as close to it as we may ever see. By spending an entire day hopping from one WeWork property to another, perhaps I\u2019d see the company as Neumann saw it, an ecosystem in which the \u201cWeGeneration\u201d could thrive. Beyond the core business of office space, he imagined the company becoming the hub of key aspects of our lives: landlord, personal trainer, social curator, educator to our children. Neumann created WeWork, WeGrow, Rise by We (essentially WeGym), and WeLive, and he had at least mentioned ideas for a WeWork airline, WeBank, WeSail, and WeMars.\n\nSo recently, I tried to spend a whole day in WeWorld to savor it before the new CEOs begin hacking away at non-core operations to lower the company\u2019s furious cash burn rate. Only by experiencing the company at such a granular level was I able to wrap my mind around just how ambitious \u2014 and disjointed \u2014 Neumann\u2019s vision was.\n\n8:32 a.m.: My day starts on a Chelsea sidewalk outside WeGrow, which is WeWork\u2019s school for kids ages 2 through 12. It\u2019s the creation of Rebekah Paltrow Neumann, Adam\u2019s wife and, until recently, WeWork\u2019s \u201cchief brand and impact officer.\u201d Her vision for WeGrow was \u201ca new conscious, entrepreneurial school committed to unleashing every child\u2019s superpowers.\u201d Or, as Rebekah\u2019s cousin, Gwyneth Paltrow, once put it, a school geared toward \u201cfamilies that are in an open state of being.\u201d Tuition runs from $36,000 to $42,000.\n\nI do not have a child, but I imagine the day when I might; I visualize dropping the bright-eyed tot off for another day of unleashing her superpowers. In reality, I try to play it cool and not look like a creep standing across the street. A very muscular man in a tight black T-shirt stands outside the door like a bouncer greeting teachers, parents, and children. I watch a few fashionable moms and dads drop their kids off and head to work.\n\nIt turns out I was witnessing one of the last normal days at WeGrow: On October 11, the company announced it would be shuttering the schools after this academic year.\n\n9:23 a.m.: Just a few blocks away is WeWork Now, the company\u2019s combination coffee shop and co-working space. It\u2019s WeWork\u2019s only \u201con demand\u201d co-working space, where, for $12 an hour (or 20 cents a minute), anyone \u2014 WeWork member or not \u2014 can enjoy a sleek, comfortable co-working space attached to a Bluestone Lane coffee shop.\n\nI buy a coffee and a scone and sit down. To my right is a giant wall of merchandise. Retro \u201cMade by We\u201d patches, \u201cWe\u201d hoodies, \u201cWe Love\u201d T-shirts, a shirt that says \u201cHuman,\u201d and a bucket hat that says \u201cWorker.\u201d I want the bucket hat but don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to expense it.\n\nPhoto: David \u2018Dee\u2019 Delgado/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nAt the opposite end of the merch wall is a checkpoint, patrolled by two WeWork employees, where people can check in to the paid co-working space. I approach and ask an employee what she thinks about the Neumann shake-up. She says she isn\u2019t worried. She also tells me I can book a seat in advance next time. Looking over her shoulder, I see only five or six people in a space space built for about 100.\n\n10:02 a.m.: Curious to check out the scene at the place where it all began, I head to 154 Grand Street, where the company\u2019s first co-working space opened in 2010. Standing outside the original location, I can see another WeWork a block away, and there are still four others within a six-block radius.\n\nInside the small lobby, I pull out my credit card and ask to purchase a day pass. The woman behind the desk sighs. \u201cOh no, we don\u2019t do day passes,\u201d she says sympathetically. \u201cHave you heard of WeWork Now?\u201d\n\nPhoto: Timothy A. Clary/AFP/Getty Images\n\n10:06 a.m.: I buy a seltzer at a Starbucks across the street and do some work for an hour.\n\n12:06 p.m.: I was surprised to learn that anyone can tour Dock 72, WeWork\u2019s latest project in the Brooklyn Navy Yard, so I scheduled an appointment. Outside I meet a WeWork rep, a cool 20-something with bleached hair and a tie-dyed shirt, and she hands me a hard hat before we begin walking through the massive building, passing workers hustling to put the final touches on before it opens on October 1.\n\nIn the elevator, I ask my tour guide if she likes working for WeWork.\n\n\u201cI love it,\u201d she says. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s one of the coolest companies in the world.\u201d\n\nThe WeWork offices in Dock 72 are grand and modern with massive windows offering views of Manhattan up and down the East River. The rep tells me that all members will have access to Rise by We, WeWork\u2019s \u201cvision for the complete wellness experience\u201d \u2014 a.k.a. a gym \u2014 which will be on-site. I picture myself working while reclining in one of the Scandinavian-style pieces of furniture, roomy booths, and cozy couches. I see myself sunning on the large terrace. I\u2019m not exactly sure what my job is, but I like this version of me.\n\nAfter we look around for a while, she lays out my options: $475 a month for a \u201chot desk,\u201d which would allow me to work in the open spaces, or $930 for the very last available single-occupancy private office. And that\u2019s the end of my Dock 72 personal-office fantasy.\n\n1:59 p.m.: I check into WeLive, WeWork\u2019s co-living space in a nondescript office building on Wall Street. WeLive offers furnished apartments that can be rented on a nightly or monthly basis. The combination of common areas, apartments, restaurants, and a bar in one single office building makes WeLive the closest thing to embodying Neumann\u2019s grand vision. According to Neumann, WeLive\u2019s mission was to create \u201cenvironments where no one ever feels alone.\u201d I\u2019d also heard WeLive is a bit of a party scene.\n\nI\u2019m in a studio apartment on the 26th floor. It isn\u2019t cheap ($392.50 for the night, after taxes), so I am expecting it to be something like a four-star hotel. Instead, I find a tiny room that reeks of bleach with two overhead lights and a Murphy bed. This studio costs $3,100 to $4,100 to rent monthly, a price range that, even in Manhattan, would get you a nice one-bedroom apartment.\n\nA WeLive room (not mine).

The laundry room has ping-pong, a pool table, and a couple of arcade games. A large communal kitchen offers free coffee all day. I see two college-age guys wandering around in sweatpants and slippers, but most of the people I see during my stay seem to be families on vacation. On my way out, an electronic bulletin board by the elevator delivers devastating news: I\u2019ve missed a White Claw happy hour by two days.\n\n2:59 p.m.: I make the five-minute walk from WeLive to Rise by We. Rise offers fitness and yoga classes as well as spa treatments in a luxury environment (read: pretty solid bathroom amenities) at a premium. I wasn\u2019t keen on boxing or cardio classes (I\u2019d already exercised once this week). Instead, I\u2019d made a 3 p.m. \u201cpower nap\u201d reservation and signed up for a \u201cguided sauna session\u201d at 5:35 p.m.\n\nI sheepishly check in for my power nap at the front desk and am directed down a series of hallways adorned with quotes like \u201cMmmhmm, that\u2019s right\u201d in cursive pink neon lights. I have absolutely no idea if the slogan is encouraging me or judging me. When I arrive at \u201cInsight,\u201d the studio where I am to report for my power nap, the woman from the front desk catches up to me. She tells me she has made a mistake \u2014 I\u2019d registered for a \u201cprivate nap,\u201d not an \u201copen nap,\u201d which means I will not be taking my nap on a mat in Insight but in one of two beds in a small massage room in the spa.\n\nThe spa is spacious, with seating, tables, and loungers. I see only three people, two of whom are employees. The third person is giving someone a tour on FaceTime. \u201cI know, it\u2019s so nice,\u201d she says. \u201cI come every day because no one is ever here.\u201d\n\nI find the nap room and slowly open the door. It\u2019s dark inside; the only light comes from an emergency-exit sign and a pulsing aroma diffuser. The two beds are separated by a curtain. I peek behind the curtain at the first bed and see a figure beneath the sheets. The second bed looks as if someone has already used it for a nap, but that doesn\u2019t really bother me so I climb in fully clothed. I didn\u2019t expect the act of trying to fall asleep next to someone I\u2019ve never met or seen to feel so intimate, but I listen closely to the person\u2019s breathing and hear them adjusting in bed. I wonder if they know, or care, that I\u2019m in the room. On the second question, I soon have my answer: The person starts snoring.\n\nAs I close my eyes and try to fall asleep, I begin to connect the day\u2019s dots, forming a portrait of a truly bizarre company. The people running an extremely expensive primary school are hawking \u201cWorker\u201d bucket hats, building out a massive co-working development in the Brooklyn Navy Yard, hosting a White Claw happy hour at an apartment\u2013hotel\u2013co-living space on Wall Street, and now facilitating my nap in a spa at a boutique fitness center. What, if anything, do these businesses have to do with one another?\n\nStumped by that question and unable to sleep, I step outside the private room and grab a seat by the door, hoping at least to catch a glimpse of the snorer when they finish their nap. After about a half-hour of waiting, I have to give up. I\u2019m late for the next item on my WeWorld tour.\n\n3:14 p.m.: While I\u2019m in the nap room, S&P Global downgrades WeWork\u2019s credit rating to a B-.\n\n4:05 p.m.: I read a Business Insider story reporting that WeWork is selling Neumann\u2019s $60 million private jet and that Neumann reportedly voted, along with other board members, to oust himself as CEO.\n\nGenius at WeWork. Photo: Jackal Pan/Visual China Group via Getty Images\n\n4:19 p.m.: I tell the receptionist behind the desk at The Wing in Dumbo that I\u2019m here to see a friend. I expect her to tell me to get lost, The Wing is for women only, but she smiles and checks me in. My friend greets me at the front desk and escorts me inside, both of us a little stunned that the receptionist let me in.\n\nIn late 2017, WeWork was the lead investor in The Wing\u2019s $42 million Series B investment round, which I thought was a good enough reason to drop by. From the moment I walk in, it feels like a fully formed version of a premium, community-oriented, cutting edge co-working space. It is a beautiful space, the women are mingling, there\u2019s a class or lecture going on in one of the conference rooms. Why does this feel so different from the WeWork properties I\u2019ve been to? Are men the problem?\n\n4:54 p.m.: While walking back to the subway, I text my wife, \u201cHey, wanna come spend the night at WeLive?\u201d\n\n5:15 p.m.: Back at Rise by We, I change into my swimsuit for my \u201cguided sauna session.\u201d I join about 15 people in the spa and, when the time comes, a slender guy in flip-flops introduces himself as the \u201csauna master\u201d and herds us into a large sauna.\n\n\u201cI ask you, please, to listen to your bodies,\u201d the sauna master tells us. \u201cThis will be a challenge. We will overcome this obstacle because the heat will become very intense and put us under pressure. But we will pull through together.\u201d\n\nThe sauna master spends the next 12 minutes or so raising the temperature in the room while adding essential oils to the steam. He periodically helicopters a damp towel over his head, blowing gusts of hot air at us. By the time the sauna master passes out ice cubes and tells us to rub them all over our bodies, I feel like a ziplock bag full of hot spaghetti on a sidewalk in July. Afterward, we form a line to spend a few seconds under a cold shower.\n\nOnce I\u2019ve cooled down, I try talking to the sauna master. I ask him if this type of sauna session is offered at other spas in New York.\n\n\u201cNobody does this,\u201d he says proudly. \u201cWe\u2019re the only ones.\u201d When I ask how the program got started here, he points to the fresh fruit. \u201cPlease, have some pineapple,\u201d he says and walks away.\n\nWe eat pineapple. Barely a word is spoken. I need an employee to open my locker for me.\n\n6:16 p.m.: \u201cHahahahahaha, that is the least-hot booty call I\u2019ve ever received,\u201d my wife responds to my request to spend the night at WeLive. She agrees to join me, though.\n\n6:50 p.m.: Still eager to get a sense of a standard WeWork space, I attend a panel discussion that is open to the public at a WeWork just north of Penn Station. The event is called \u201cMen & Vulnerability,\u201d and when I walk in, I\u2019m surprised to find about 50 people milling about, drinking free wine and pouring themselves beers from a tap in the communal kitchen.\n\nThe event begins ten minutes later, and the moderators introduce themselves as \u201cCoach Jake\u201d and \u201cCoach Nick.\u201d As an icebreaker, they instruct us to turn to the person sitting next to us and share a time when we were vulnerable. I am sitting next to a woman I guess to to be in her late 60s or early 70s. She tells me she has no real interest in sharing; she\u2019s just here to support her co-worker who is sitting on the panel. Relieved, I ask her if this is her first time at a WeWork.\n\n\u201cYes. What is this place?\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople come here to do work,\u201d I say. She gives me a blank stare. \u201cThey rent desks and offices,\u201d I say. Before I continue to explain, I realize she isn\u2019t confused \u2014 she knows what desks and offices are \u2014 she\u2019s just utterly unimpressed.\n\nThe panel discussion resumes. Insights are mostly limited to parables and personal anecdotes about the panelists\u2019 childhoods. I leave early.\n\n8:02 p.m.: I check my phone and see that a friend has sent me a Reddit post of a picture purporting to show Neumann walking barefoot and talking on the phone near Gramercy Park on the day he resigned. (The picture was, in fact, taken several days earlier.)\n\nOn the subway back to WeLive, I suddenly become aware of how tired I am. I expected to feel as if I were living in a bubble, but the experience of bouncing from WeGrow to WeWork to WeLive to Rise by We is so jarring, each location so intrinsically dissimilar from the last, that I just feel drained by it all. Maybe na\u00efvely, I\u2019d thought the WeWorld would have had more social interaction built into it. Instead, my day has been pretty sterile. On the whole, it was less social than my typical day.\n\n8:52 p.m.: Financial Times reports that WeWork is halting the signing of all new leases.\n\n9:23 p.m.: My wife and I meet for drinks in the Mailroom, a stylish bar in WeLive\u2019s basement. It\u2019s a large space, which makes the fact that we are one of only two parties in the entire joint even sadder. We ask the bartender if the bar ever gets busy, and he says, yes, during the twice-weekly WeLive happy hour \u2014 a claim that comes under suspicion when he later reveals that today is only his second day on the job. After finishing our beers, we decide to call it quits.\n\nBack in the room, my wife climbs into bed and turns the lights off. I have some work to finish and consider heading to the communal kitchen at the end of the hall. But on second thought, I move the desk chair into the bathroom, set my laptop up on the toilet seat, and get to work.\n\nSign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter Daily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.
