The U.S. State Department said it had accepted Sweden\u2019s invitation to return for more discussions with Pyongyang in two weeks.\n\nNorth Korea said the ball was now in Washington\u2019s court, and warned Washington that it would wait only until the end of the year for the United States to change course.\n\n\u201cWe have no intention to hold such sickening negotiations as ... happened this time (in Sweden) before the U.S. takes a substantial step to make complete and irreversible withdrawal of the hostile policy towards the DPRK,\u201d KCNA state news agency cited a spokesperson for North Korea\u2019s foreign ministry as saying, referring to the official name of North Korea.\n\nAnn Linde, Sweden\u2019s minister for foreign affairs, said the talks had been constructive \u201cfor as long as they lasted.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I think there was a somewhat different view on what to accomplish at one meeting,\u201d she told Sweden\u2019s public broadcaster SVT, adding that Sweden was at the countries\u2019 disposal if they decide to meet again.\n\n\u201cIf that is in two weeks or two months remains to be seen. I think it is possible to achieve more talks, but that is entirely up to both parties,\u201d she said.\n\nIt is unclear whether North Korea will return to the talks, but Pyongyang could be using its strategy of negotiating on the edge to gain concessions as fringe benefits of participating in negotiations, experts say.\n\n\u201cThey want to create the impression that the cause of the impasse is the inflexibility of the U.S. side - and they likely want to force the United States to either come back with a more favourable negotiating position or eventually force President Trump to engage at the summit level to keep diplomacy alive,\u201d said Mintaro Oba, a former U.S. State Department official specializing in the Koreas.\n\nA motorcade carrying North Korean delegation heads for Villa Elfvik on the island of Lidingo off Stockholm, Sweden, October 5, 2019. REUTERS/Anna Ringstrom\n\nVipin Narang, a nuclear affairs expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, added that North Korea is also buying time to continue to expand and improve its missile and nuclear force, and negotiate the terms by which it is accepted as a nuclear weapons power.\n\n\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, their best strategy is to dangle the hope of a fictional future deal but stall on actual negotiations, let alone crafting or implementing any such deal,\u201d Narang said.\n\nUnder sanctions banning much of its trade because of its weapons programme, North Korea recently test-fired a new ballistic missile designed for submarine launch, a provocative gesture that also underscored the need for Washington to move quickly to negotiate limits on Pyongyang\u2019s growing arsenal.\n\nDEADLINE COMING CLOSE\n\nNorth Korea reiterated the year-end deadline that leader Kim Jong Un set for the United States to show more flexibility in the talks, which fell apart in February during his summit with U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nIn June, the two leaders then met again in Panmunjom, the demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas, and agreed to restart working-level talks.\n\nAt the working-level talks, the United States has said it brought \u201ccreative ideas\u201d and had good discussions with North Korea, without giving further details.\n\nBut North Korea\u2019s foreign ministry said Washington had made no preparations for the talks in Sweden but sought only to serve its own political aims.\n\nThe North Korean delegation led by chief nuclear negotiator Kim Myong Gil left the embassy in Stockholm, Yonhap News Agency said. Asked whether they would return to Sweden, Kim suggested asking the U.S. side.\n\nNorth Korea's chief nuclear negotiator Kim Myong Gil is seen outside the North Korean embassy in Stockholm, Sweden October 5, 2019.

It is not likely at all that it can produce a proposal commensurate to the expectations of the DPRK and to the concerns of the world in just a fortnight,\u201d the foreign ministry spokesperson said.", "description": "North Korea said on Sunday there was no way the United States would bring alternative plans for their stalled nuclear talks to a meeting proposed by Stockholm in two weeks after weekend negotiations in Sweden broke down.", "authors": ["Ju-Min Park", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191006&t=2&i=1437772198&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF950DK", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
