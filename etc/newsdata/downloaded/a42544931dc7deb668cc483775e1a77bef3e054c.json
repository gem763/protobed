The other is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.\n\nFounded in 1974, Vector is one of the world's largest research centers. In Soviet times, researchers at the lab studied potential plagues including anthrax and tularaemia to learn more about creating biological weapons. Vector now develops tools for diagnosing and treating infectious diseases, specializing work on vaccines for swine flu, HIV and Ebola.\n\nUniversal Images Group via Getty\n\nVector earlier this year completed trials of an Ebola vaccine that's reportedly ready for implimentation.\n\nIn 2004, a scientist working at Vector died after accidentally sticking herself with a needle laced with Ebola. Scientists and officials said the accident raised concerns about safety at the research center.\n\nA 2016 World Health Organization inspection said Vector met biosafety and biosecurity standards and did not have any concerns relating to security.", "description": "A gas explosion shook a Soviet-era biological weapons center in Siberia that houses samples of Ebola and smallpox.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/smallpox-virus-gty-ps-190917_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
