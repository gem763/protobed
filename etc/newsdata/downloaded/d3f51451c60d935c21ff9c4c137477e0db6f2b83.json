The sign read, \u201cBusch Light supply needs replenished\" and featured information on how to send him money through Venmo, the popular money-transfer app.\n\n\"I just thought as a joke, maybe I could make a sign asking for money to get some Busch Light. You know, buy some lattes,\" King told Fox4KC. \"My mom was like 'this is going to be a proud mom moment. My son is going to be begging for money for beer on national television.'\"\n\nIncredibly, the sign did end up on TV, and King received $1,000 in donations. Since that was way more than he expected, King reportedly came up with a pretty selfless idea: donate the money to the University of Iowa Stead Family Children\u2019s Hospital.\n\nBUSCH LAUNCHES LIMITED-EDITION BEER TO CELEBRATE LATTE SEASON\n\n\"Their hospital does great things for the state of Iowa,\u201d King told the outlet. \"Both for Iowa State and the University of Iowa. Those kids are fighters and they deserve any chance they can get.\u201d\n\nAs King's fundraising campaign increasingly garnered attention, more and more money came in. Once Busch Beer found out, they decided to join in on the fun.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cCarson King, this is the best thing we have read all year, we\u2019re inspired,\u201d the company wrote on Twitter on Sept. 17. \u201cWe\u2019re going to match your donation to University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics and we\u2019ll throw in some of that Busch Light you were looking for.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAccording to his Twitter profile, King has raised over $29,000 to date for the good cause.\n\nIn a statement obtained by Fox News, Daniel Blake, Senior Director, US Value Brands for Anheuser Busch said, \"We\u2019ve known for a long, long time that Iowans love Busch Light.
