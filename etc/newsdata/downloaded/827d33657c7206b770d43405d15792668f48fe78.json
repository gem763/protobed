REUTERS/Jason Lee/File Photo\n\nBEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Auto sales in China fell for a 15th consecutive month in September, with the number of new energy vehicles (NEVs) sold contracting for the third month in a row, data from the country\u2019s biggest auto industry association showed.\n\nTotal auto sales fell 5.2% from the same month a year earlier, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) said on Monday.\n\nThat followed declines of 6.9% in August and 4.3% in July. Car sales in 2018 declined from a year earlier, the first annual contraction since the 1990s against a backdrop of slowing economic growth and a crippling trade war with the United States. [nB9N25T00N]\n\nSales of new energy vehicles (NEVs) fell 34.2% in September, CAAM said, following a 15.8% decline in August. NEV sales jumped almost 62% last year as the broader auto market contracted.\n\nNEVs include plug-in hybrids, battery-only electric vehicles and those powered by hydrogen fuel cells.\n\nChina has been a keen supporter of NEVs and has implemented sales quota requirements for automakers.", "description": "Auto sales in China fell for a 15th consecutive month in September, with the number of new energy vehicles (NEVs) sold contracting for the third month in a row, data from the country's biggest auto industry association showed.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440616612&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D0FS", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
