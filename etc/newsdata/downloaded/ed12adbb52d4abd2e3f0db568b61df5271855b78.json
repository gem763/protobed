In Pew Research Center telephone surveys conducted in 2018 and 2019, 65% of American adults describe themselves as Christians when asked about their religion, down 12 percentage points over the past decade. Meanwhile, the religiously unaffiliated share of the population, consisting of people who describe their religious identity as atheist, agnostic or \u201cnothing in particular,\u201d now stands at 26%, up from 17% in 2009.\n\nBoth Protestantism and Catholicism are experiencing losses of population share. Currently, 43% of U.S. adults identify with Protestantism, down from 51% in 2009. And one-in-five adults (20%) are Catholic, down from 23% in 2009. Meanwhile, all subsets of the religiously unaffiliated population \u2013 a group also known as religious \u201cnones\u201d \u2013 have seen their numbers swell. Self-described atheists now account for 4% of U.S. adults, up modestly but significantly from 2% in 2009; agnostics make up 5% of U.S. adults, up from 3% a decade ago; and 17% of Americans now describe their religion as \u201cnothing in particular,\u201d up from 12% in 2009. Members of non-Christian religions also have grown modestly as a share of the adult population.", "description": "", "authors": ["Pewforum.Org In-U-S-Decline-Of-Christianity-Continues-At-Rapid-Pace"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
