The 49-year-old\u2019s 19-month spell at Vicarage Road was largely admirable \u2013 last season he led his side to an 11th-place league finish and the club\u2019s first FA Cup final in 35 years \u2013 but a poor end to his first full campaign bled into a sub-par start to this term, and Gracia was given his marching orders.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Liverpool The most popular set of kits in the country. Liverpool FC via Getty Images\n\nAny sympathetic feelings towards Gracia were forgotten almost at once, though, as Sanchez Flores was warmly welcomed back to Watford, stepping out to a rousing reception moments before kick-off.\n\nIn fact, there was a real sense of excitement around the ground, a feeling that was only enhanced by Watford\u2019s fine effort on Sunday.\n\nAn encouraging return for Sanchez Flores\n\nThe home side attacked with verve and conviction from the opening whistle. They frequently dispossessed Arsenal in midfield and defence, tried their luck from various distances, and their sole intention was to win.\n\nGerard Deulofeu appeared inspired, Tom Cleverley looked like an English Deulofeu, and even at 2-0 down, Watford emerged for the second half full of desire to affect the result. Hornets fans will have been buoyed by the energy on show from their team, as well as the flashes of genuine quality.\n\nThere is plenty for Watford to build on from Sunday\u2019s performance. The club\u2019s supporters will just hope that their side can find a much-needed victory soon.\n\nAubameyang doesn\u2019t need Lacazette, or Nketiah\n\nAt around 2pm in Barnsley, on-loan Gunner Eddie Nketiah came off the bench to get on the end of a free-kick and belt a close-range volley past Bradley Collins, breaking the deadlock for Leeds and sending them on their way to a 2-0 victory. With Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang\u2019s striker soulmate Alexandre Lacazette out until October with an ankle injury, Arsenal fans will have felt at that moment that Nketiah\u2019s presence at Vicarage Road might have proven useful, if only to give their Gabon international some support.\n\nBy approximately 4.50pm, Arsenal fans\u2019 concerns about their strike-force situation will have diminished, if only marginally. Aubameyang\u2019s first finish was as ruthless as it was riveting; the striker spun with his first touch and drove the ball past Foster with his second, and by the time the goalkeeper realised a shot had been fired, he was picking the ball out of the net.\n\nAubameyang\u2019s second goal was virtually unmissable, having been teed up so precisely by Ainsley Maitland-Niles after a neat pass from Mesut Ozil, but whichever way they come, Arsenal fans won\u2019t mind. After Sunday\u2019s game they may just feel that their star striker can score enough goals to tide the Gunners over until Lacazette\u2019s return.\n\nGuendouzi goes backwards\n\nMatteo Guendouzi was the midfield general for Arsenal in their north London derby draw with Spurs before the international break, but he resembled a startled private at times on Sunday.\n\nAn eager Deulofeu caught the 20-year-old unaware on the edge of his own box in the first half, milliseconds after the Arsenal player received a goal-kick, then early in the second half, Guendouzi played an impressively accurate cross\u2026 but it was into his own box, and the ball arrived at the feet of Andre Gray, who luckily let the Frenchman off the hook with a poor touch.\n\nGuendouzi, who was replaced on 66 minutes, is young and will improve, but consistency is key. That needs to be the next attribute that he accesses.\n\nPepe\u2019s perennial potential is a problem\n\nTwenty minutes in, Nicolas Pepe put a shot wide from a promising position after some nice dribbling. It was fairly emblematic of his time in an Arsenal shirt so far; all potential, no final product.\n\nEven if Aubameyang can shoulder the goalscoring burden at Arsenal in Lacazette and Nketiah\u2019s absences, the rest of the team need to do their bit, and questions will be asked of Pepe if he cannot find a clinical edge in the final third.\n\nOne assist in his opening five games is not a disastrous return, but it\u2019s also not the electrifying introduction to the 24-year-old that many Arsenal fans expected.", "description": "Arsenal\u2019s trip to Watford\u00a0in the Premier League on Sunday led to some captivating entertainment as the home side came from 2-0 down\u00a0to draw 2-2 in Quique Sanchez Flores\u2019 (second) first match in charge of the Hornets.", "authors": ["Alex Pattle"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/15/18/Pereyra-celebrates-his-equaliser-vs-Arsenal.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
