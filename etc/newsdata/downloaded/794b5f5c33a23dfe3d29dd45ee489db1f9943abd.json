There\u2019s a level of accomplishment that comes with that.\u201d\n\nSome lakes are particularly welcoming to beginners, and Hall shares favorites with USA TODAY.\n\n1. St. Lawrence River, New York\n\nThe St. Lawrence River, Bassmaster's top-ranked bass lake for 2019, wins praise for its abundance of large smallmouth bass. It\u2019s quite possible for a first-timer to haul in a 9-pounder.\n\n\u201cThe St. Lawrence is not only healthy right now, but seems to be showing off. I\u2019ve watched folks catch fish right off the dock,\u201d says Hall. \u201cIt\u2019s the best place in the United States to fish currently.\u201d\n\nMore information: visit1000islands.com\n\n2. Lake Fork, Texas\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s never a harvest of bass, which keeps the lake full of really, really nice size fish,\u201d Hall says of Texas' Lake Fork.

(Photo: B.A.S.S. / Vance McCullough)\n\nBiologists specifically designed this new Central Florida impoundment to be a world-class bass fishing spot, and Hall says they nailed it. Just a few years old, it\u2019s already winning rave reviews.\n\n\u201cIts whole reason for existence was to create heaven for bass anglers,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s no ramp for big boats, so it\u2019s serene, not a lot of loud noises and people.\u201d\n\nMore information: https://myfwc.com/\n\n4.
