REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach\n\nThe bill would have allowed extraditions from the former British colony to mainland China, where courts are controlled by the Communist Party.\n\nThe protests against it began in March but gained momentum in June and have since evolved into a push for five demands, including the bill\u2019s withdrawal.\n\nThe other demands are: the retraction of the word \u201criot\u201d to describe rallies, the release of all arrested demonstrators, an independent inquiry into perceived brutality of the police and the right for people in Hong Kong to democratically choose their own leaders.\n\nHere are comments from legislators, protesters and residents.\n\nJOSHUA WONG, LEADER OF 2014 PRO-DEMOCRACY PROTESTS:\n\n\u201cToo little, too late,\u201d he said, on his Facebook page.\n\nMICHAEL TIEN, HONG KONG LEGISLATURE MEMBER AND DEPUTY TO CHINA\u2019S NATIONAL PARLIAMENT:\n\n\u201cMany forgot what the bill was about. It become clashes between police and the protesters.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the government mentioned it (withdrawal of the bill) in June, it (the protests) would have stopped already. Setting up the independent commission is something the government should do 100%. It should be the focus. The commission should investigate both police and protesters.\u201d\n\nPRO-DEMOCRACY LEGISLATOR CLAUDIA MO:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a matter whether the Democrats at the legislature or the pan-democratic camp accept ... It\u2019s up to the young protesters. We need all five demands, the damage is done. She should have used the word \u2018withdraw\u2019 and it would have appeased society, now it is too late.\u201d\n\nLEUNG YIU TING, PRESIDENT, HONG KONG EDUCATION UNIVERSITY STUDENT UNION:\n\n\u201cUntil the five demands are met, I don\u2019t think the protests and the social movement will stop.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she chose a good timing to announce such a withdrawal, now it\u2019s coming a bit too late.\u201d\n\nBORIS CHEN, 37, EMPLOYED IN FINANCIAL SERVICES:\n\n\u201cThis won\u2019t appease the protesters...if this thing is settled, they will find the next thing they can be angry about. If you appease one thing, there\u2019s another thing coming up, it\u2019s a never-ending cycle.\n\n\u201cI think now that people are going back to school, they have less free time, I think that protests will slow down, but not quickly.\n\n\u201cA lot of people have a lot of free time these days and there are a lot of forces behind the scenes, but I don\u2019t think they can indefinitely support the movement.\u201d\n\nJESSICA, 23, A UNIVERSITY STUDENT:\n\n\u201cAll the effort we have done is worthwhile, even though it\u2019s not the result we expected. I believe that this issue has made Hong Kong more united.\u201d\n\nMELANIE, AN ACCOUNTANT:\n\n\u201cActually, she is not really changing anything. She just does what she wants to do. She ignored all of the Hong Kong people\u2019s voice, she ignored our five demands.\u201d\n\nPEARL, A 69-YEAR-OLD RETIREE:\n\n\u201cI think the conditions have changed, this is not any more just about the bill, it is about something else. Some of those guys may change their minds, maybe,\u201d she said of the protests.\n\n\u201cBut just a minority. Some of them just want to create trouble and they will continue to do so.\u201d\n\nMRS CHANG, FORMER ANALYST, 45:\u201dNot now, not at this moment, maybe two months ago, yes, but after what has been going on during the past two months, no. It doesn\u2019t mean anything anymore.\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t change much because people care more about the police, what they\u2019re doing, I think that\u2019s what matters the most now.\u201d", "description": "Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam on Wednesday announced the withdrawal of an extradition bill that triggered months of unrest and has thrown the Chinese-controlled city into its worst crisis in decades, a source with knowledge of the matter said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1426079339&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF830PT"}
