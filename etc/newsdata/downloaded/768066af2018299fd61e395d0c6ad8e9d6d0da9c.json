The Kurds, a stateless people living across Turkey, Syria, Iraq, and Iran, have been at odds with Turkey for decades.\n\nVisit Business Insiders homepage for more stories.\n\nTurkey's involvement in the ongoing Syrian civil war is just one reason the border between the two countries is one of the most dangerous in the world \u2014 and it's only getting more dangerous.\n\nThe Kurdish militia in Syria were a crucial part of the US-led coalition that defeated ISIS in Syria. Now, as the US is beginning to pull troops from northeastern Syria, the president's critics \u2014 and even his allies \u2014 have sharply criticized him for abandoning Kurdish forces and rolling back gains against ISIS.\n\nTurkey is opposed to Kurdish groups affiliated with Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) \u2014 which Turkey and the US consider a terrorist organization.\n\nAs a new conflict looms, with Turkey preparing to invade \u2014 and by some accounts, already launching airstrikes against \u2014 northeastern Syria, life on the border is more dangerous than ever. Read on for more insight about what life is like there.\n\nThe border between Turkey and Syria has been an especially contentious area during the Syrian civil war, for two main reasons: the flow of Syrian refugees into Turkey, and the prevalence of PKK and Kurdish defense forces (YPG) in the northeastern part of Syria.\n\nGoogle Maps / Business Insider\n\n\n\n\n\nKurds, an ethnic minority living mostly in Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Turkey, have long demanded their own independent state \u2014 sometimes using violence to make their point. Turkey considers the Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK) a terrorist group because of violent uprisings against Turkish authority.\n\nGoogle Maps / Business Insider\n\n\n\n\n\nThe YPG, or the Kurdish People's Protection Unit, have worked with US-led coalition forces and the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) to combat the Islamic State in Syria. While President Donald Trump declared victory over the Islamic State this year, the Department of Defense released a report saying IS was regrouping in Syria and Iraq.
