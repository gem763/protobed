REUTERS/Amr Abdallah Dalsh\n\nCAIRO (Reuters) - Small groups of protesters gathered in central Cairo late on Friday shouting anti-government slogans, responding to an online call for a demonstration against government corruption, Reuters witnesses and residents said.\n\nProtests have become very rare in Egypt following a broad crackdown on dissent under President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, who took power after the overthrow of the former Islamist president Mohamed Mursi in 2013 following mass protests against his rule.\n\nSecurity forces moved to disperse the crowds but youth kept protesting in side streets, several witnesses told Reuters. There was a heavy security presence in downtown Cairo and on Tahrir Square where mass protest started in 2011 which toppled Hosni Mubarak.\n\nAuthorities could not be immediately reached for comment. A pro-government TV anchor said only a small group of protesters gathered to take videos and selfies before leaving the scene.\n\nMohamed Ali, a building contractor and actor turned political activist who lives in Spain, called in a series of videos for the protest after accusing Sisi and the military of corruption.\n\nOn Saturday, Sisi dismissed the claims as \u201clies and slander\u201d.\n\nSisi won two elections with 97% of the vote in 2014 and 2018, but his popularity has been dented by economic austerity measures.\n\nSisi\u2019s supporters say dissent must be quashed to stabilize Egypt, after a 2011 uprising and the unrest that followed, including an Islamist insurgency in the Sinai Peninsula that has killed hundreds of police, soldiers and civilians.\n\nThey also credit him with economic reforms agreed with the International Monetary Fund.", "description": "Small groups of protesters gathered in central Cairo late on Friday shouting anti-government slogans, responding to an online call for a demonstration against government corruption, Reuters witnesses and residents said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1432139509&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J27L", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
