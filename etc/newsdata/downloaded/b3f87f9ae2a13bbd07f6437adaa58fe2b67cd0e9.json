Photo: Courtesy of the artist and Galeria Nara Roesler\n\nThe once-mighty Drawing Center reawakens this fall under new director Laura Hoptman, who has mounted a virtuoso exhibition of over 140 drawings, \u201cThe Pencil Is a Key: Drawings by Incarcerated Artists.\u201d The selections are beautiful, rage-inspiring, tragic \u2014 a testament to the power of drawing as tool, survival skill, memory theater, and weapon to fight for justice, gain agency, and allow the imagination to soar. The artists range from those imprisoned during the Terror of the French Revolution, to Native Americans confined in horrible conditions working for slave wages and selling drawings for pennies to soldiers\u2019 wives and white tourists, to so-called outsider visionaries who spent the bulk of their lives in mental institutions producing some of the most powerful art of the 20th century. There are also works by Japanese-Americans the U.S. government interned as \u201cenemy aliens\u201d and by numerous political prisoners who taught themselves to draw while locked up in Brazil, Argentina, Chile, South Africa, Sudan, Assad\u2019s Syria, Nazi Germany, and post-9/11 Guant\u00e1namo Bay \u2014 where even top-priority \u201cconfirmed\u201d terrorists have been cleared for release after more than 15 years of torture and privation. \u201cIn this moment in our country and around the world,\u201d Hoptman says, \u201cwhen all kinds of freedoms are being called into question, this show is about the ability of drawing to articulate our humanity and express our determination to be free even in the most dire circumstances.\u201d She\u2019s right. This work will make your heart soar, your stomach retch, and your fists clench.\n\n\u201cThe Pencil Is a Key: Drawings by Incarcerated Artists,\u201d on view at The Drawing Center, October 11 to January 5.\n\nWhat Else We Think Will Be Great\n\nBy Jerry Saltz\n\nSeptember\n\nPope.L, Thunderbird.

MoMA, \u201cmember\u201d; 10/21\u20132/1/2020)\n\nAfter winning the Whitney\u2019s $100,000 Bucksbaum Award in 2017, Pope.L hits the New York institutional trifecta with an extravaganza of three upcoming shows. The Museum of Modern Art will mount a retrospective of the activist-sculptor-painter-provocateur\u2019s work from 1978 to 2001 \u2014 including videos of the epic crawls he did on his belly through the streets of New York City dressed as an African-American superhero. Also stay tuned for a mass performance of over 100 volunteers of all races crawling together through the Washington Square arch to Union Square.\n\nAmy Sherald, SOMETIMES THE KING IS A WOMAN VIEW.

Sherald, 46, is the artist who created the portrait of former First Lady Michelle Obama.\n\nCorbaz, from \u201cMemory Palaces.\u201d Photo: Collection of Audrey B.

Heckler\u201d (The American Folk Art Museum; 9/17\u20131/26/2020)\n\nThe American Folk Art Museum is the most underrated cultural resource in Manhattan. Show after show, mounted with grit, intelligence, and love in the museum\u2019s difficult lobby space, luxuriates in the glories of self-taught visionary artists. This fall, see a deep dive into Heckler\u2019s magnificent collection of their work.\n\nOctober\n\nNicolas Moufarrege, Untitled.

Moufarrege made gorgeous embroidered paintings to address issues of migration, queerness, and homophobia. He was also among the sharper critics of his day and a fabulous dandy.\n\nJacob Lawrence, This is Harlem.

She helped propel American art, seen everywhere else as hopelessly provincial and out of it, to center stage. From 1926 on, she showed artists like Stuart Davis, Charles Sheeler, Ben Shahn, Georgia O\u2019Keeffe, Jacob Lawrence, Horace Pippin, and Yasuo Kuniyoshi, who was classified as an enemy alien during World War II. This American hero deserves her due.\n\nWhat We Think Will Be Big\n\nBy Carl Swanson\n\nSeptember\n\nMemento mori, from \u201cTokyo Pop Underground.\u201d Photo: Courtesy of Jeffrey Deitch Gallery\n\nLoie Hollowell: \u201cPlumb Line\u201d (Pace; 9/14\u201310/19)\n\nThe popular young mystical feminist abstractionist \u2014 she might just remind you of Agnes Pelton, Georgia O\u2019Keeffe, or Judy Chicago \u2014 helps inaugurate the new neo-brutalist Pace megagallery in west Chelsea with what she calls her self-portraits.\n\n\u201cTokyo Pop Underground\u201d (Jeffrey Deitch; 9/14\u201311/2)\n\nThis could be the Ur\u2013Deitch show, a manga-and-more candyland, curated by Tokyo gallerist Shinji Nanzuka, that will once more underscore that the Japanese can\u2019t help but be cooler than you.\n\nOctober\n\nJacolby Satterwhite: \u201cYou\u2019re at Home\u201d (Pioneer Works; 10/4\u201311/24) Promises a millennial-nostalgia house of horrors, or at least submerged longings. He\u2019s building an immersive installation of video projections, virtual reality, and \u201ca retail store styled to resemble a defunct Tower Records\u201d to lose yourself in once you\u2019ve made it all the way to Red Hook.\n\n\u201cJR: Chronicles\u201d (Brooklyn Museum; 10/4\u20135/3/2020)\n\nLiterally big: The onetime street artist creates one of his digitally collaged murals, The Chronicles of New York City, for the Brooklyn. Look closely: Maybe you\u2019ll see someone you know!\n\n\u201cHans Haacke: All Connected\u201d (The New Museum; 10/24\u20131/26/2020)\n\nA retrospective centered on his all-too-timely bronze horse-skeleton sculpture, Gift Horse (2014), \u201cadorned with an LED ribbon streaming stock prices in real time.\u201d\n\nNovember\n\n\u201cTheater of Operations: The Gulf Wars 1991\u20132011\u201d (MoMA PS1; 11/3\u20133/1/2020)\n\n\ufeffA show of more than 50 artists (Afifa Aleiby, Paul Chan, Guerrilla Girls \u2014 but no paintings by W.) whose work was inspired by America\u2019s late-empire military adventures.\n\n*This article appears in the September 2, 2019, issue of New York Magazine.
