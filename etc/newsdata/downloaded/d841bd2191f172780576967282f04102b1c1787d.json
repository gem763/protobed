The Verge confirmed today, however, that two months or so after its launch, cofounder Joe Purzycki stepped down as chief strategy officer. He remains close to CEO Matt Sacks, a Luminary spokesperson says, and still holds shares. The company replaced Purzycki with Jeff Saunders, a former VP of product and technology at Jet.com, who is now Luminary\u2019s chief product officer. Since taking on the role, Saunders has increased the engineering team from 20 to 30 people, a spokesperson says. The company didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment on why Purzycki left or how many subscribers the service has.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what\u2019s going on at Luminary or how its subscription model is panning out. The company gives initial users a free trial to its premium content, but some people reported a confusing cancellation process. Instead of outright deleting their accounts, Luminary requires them to switch to a free account, which means people still technically have accounts, they just can\u2019t access Luminary\u2019s exclusive shows.\n\nMeanwhile, the company has continued to struggle to court the broader podcasting industry. At launch, and still now, the app is missing some of podcasting\u2019s biggest shows, including The New York Times\u2019 The Daily, Joe Rogan\u2019s show, and Gimlet Media shows like Reply All, among others. At the app\u2019s launch time, the Times said it intends to be \u201cjudicious\u201d about where The Daily is placed. Other New York Times shows, like Caliphate and Modern Love, are available on Luminary, but the Times still hasn\u2019t opted to include The Daily.\n\nLuminary also initially relied on a proxy server to serve listeners shows from public RSS feeds, which deprived hosts of valuable listener data. It also stripped hosts\u2019 show notes, which are often used to share sponsored links or relevant information. Both these issues have been fixed, but they speak to the Luminary\u2019s broader challenges as a podcasting startup and one that might not have fully understood the industry it entered.", "description": "Podcasting startup Luminary\u2019s cofounder Joe Purzycki stepped down from his chief product officer role over four months ago and has been replaced by former Jet.com VP Jeff Saunders.", "authors": ["Ashley Carman", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OMI0_5vueHmEGBZZT1DmyZImS30=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16181956/akrales_190422_3386_0015.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
