'Welcoming people into your house - that's basically what it's going to be.\n\n'I'll be telling the story of my life through songs. I've had a long, interesting life and I can't wait.'", "description": "The Fields Of Gold singer, 68, who remains unable to play guitar after getting the injury during the past two weeks, took to the stage in a sling.", "authors": ["Harry Howard And Rebecca Davison For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/09/20237966-0-image-a-12_1572167070944.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
