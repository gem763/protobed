South Korean firms invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the project. But since the South pulled out in 2008, after one of its citizens was killed by a North Korean soldier, the resort has languished as a virtual ghost town.\n\nAD\n\nOn Wednesday, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un instructed officials to remove \u201cshabby\u201d and \u201cunpleasant-looking\u201d South Korean facilities from Mount Kumgang, state media reported.\n\nAD\n\nHe bemoaned the \u201cvery backward\u201d South Korean architecture that resembled \u201cmakeshift tents in a disaster-stricken area.\u201d North Korea should take the lead in developing the area according to \u201cour own way,\u201d Kim said, while stressing that South Koreans were still welcome to visit.\n\nSecurity analysts said Kim\u2019s move signaled his frustration at the lack of progress in proposed economic projects between North and South Korea, which are blocked by sanctions amid a deadlock in nuclear talks with Washington.\n\nWhen South Korean President Moon Jae-in met with Kim in September last year, he agreed to resume cooperation on suspended projects, notably Mount Kumgang and a joint industrial park at Kaesong \u2014 valuable income sources for the cash-strapped North.\n\nWhile tighter sanctions on Pyongyang since 2016 prohibited such ventures, hopes were high among business and political officials that improving relations might lead to sanctions relief. In a speech Jan. 1, the North Korean leader said he would resume operations in the resort and the industrial estate \u201cwithout any preconditions.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPresident Trump \u2014 a real-estate investor himself \u2014 has talked up North Korea\u2019s potential as a destination for tourists and tourism investment. He has even praised the appealing North Korean landscape seen in footage of the country\u2019s missile tests.\n\n\u201cYou could have the best hotels in the world right there,\u201d he said after his first summit meeting with Kim in Singapore last year, where he assured North Korea of a \u201cbright future\u201d if it agreed to relinquish its nuclear weapons.\n\nMore than a year later, these business partnerships have not restarted, and a breakthrough in nuclear diplomacy with Washington seems increasingly elusive.\n\nRachel Minyoung Lee, an analyst with the North Korea-focused website NK News, said the change in Kim\u2019s message indicates his regime \u201chas decided it can no longer wait for South Korea to take action.\u201d\n\n\u201cNorth Korea is basically telling South Korea that it will remove its installations and that, if [Seoul] wants to keep its share of the investment, it should act quickly\u201d to resume economic cooperation, she said.\n\nSouth Korea would seek to \u201cprotect the property rights of our people\u201d and was willing to discuss the Mount Kumgang operations with North Korea, said Unification Ministry spokesman Lee Sang-min.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe flap over the resort, which is also known as Diamond Mountain, underscores the risks South Korean firms face in getting involved in ostensibly political projects with North Korea. While some see a prospective opening up of North Korea as a huge opportunity, many have suffered losses when relations have deteriorated in the past, and had their assets confiscated.\n\nHyundai Asan, a subsidiary of the Hyundai conglomerate that built and operated tourist accommodations around Mount Kumgang, said in a statement that the company was \u201cconfused\u201d by North Korea\u2019s announcement and would respond \u201cin a calm manner.\u201d\n\nThe company had been preparing to resume operations for years and had stepped up those measures as relations between North and South Korea warmed last year, said spokesman Kim Ha-young. Hyundai Asan said it had invested almost $200 million in facilities and paid some $480 million in operating fees to North Korea between 1999 and 2008.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn a budget speech on Tuesday, President Moon called for more economic engagement with North Korea, including a rail connection across the border. Moon said North Korea\u2019s \u201cbright future\u201d is only possible on the basis of \u201cpeace economy\u201d led by inter-Korean exchanges. \u201cI urge North Korea to reciprocate,\u201d he said.\n\nAD", "description": "At the Mount Kumgang tourist area, Pyongyang plans to tear down facilities built by South Korea, signaling its frustration at a lack of a breakthrough in nuclear talks.", "authors": ["Min Joo Kim", "Assistant Reporter In Seoul Covering South", "North Korea."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/6WsmH3yQopocJFR-JNdtFelL4vA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZCVZXVHVJEI6TLMLQXRKUAFVZY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
