Mueller III\u2019s investigation started with that country.\n\n\u201cI would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it,\u201d Trump says, according to the transcript.\n\nHe adds later: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it. \u2026 It sounds horrible to me.\u201d\n\nZelensky replied that \u201cmy candidate\u201d for the prosecutor job \u201cwill look into the situation, specifically to the company that you mentioned in this issue.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Washingtonpost.Com National-Security Transcript-Of-Trumps-Call-With-Ukrainian-President-Shows-Him-Offering-Us-Assistance-For-Biden-Investigation"], "top_image": ""}
