It was clear that Mahomes was in serious pain from the grimace on his face, and it appeared he had dislocated his right knee.\n\nThat's when one member of the medical staff took matters \u2014 and the immediate future of the franchise \u2014 into his own hands.

He kept the ball and successfully converted a QB sneak on 4th and 1. The Texas Tech wunderkind wound up sandwiched between his teammates in the ensuing pileup and struggled to lift himself off a Kansas City lineman well after the play had ended and the stockpile cleared.\n\nThe Chiefs still went on to take down the Broncos on the road despite missing their star in the pocket. Backup quarterback Matt Moore recorded 117 yards and a touchdown on 10-for-19 passing.\n\nStill, Mahomes' injury could put Kansas City in a precarious position going forward. The team boasts a 5-2 record on the season and currently sit atop in the AFC West standings, but upcoming matchups against the NFC North heavyweight Green Bay Packers and Minnesota Vikings could spell trouble without the team's young ace.\n\nResults from Mahomes' MRI have not been publicly released as of writing, but compounded with a lingering left ankle injury he sustained during the first game of the season that worsened during the Chiefs' contest against the Houston Texans last week, it appears as though the Texas Tech product will spend at least some time on the sidelines.", "description": "Reigning NFL MVP Patrick Mahomes went down after successfully converting a QB sneak on 4th and 1 during the second quarter of the Chiefs' TNF matchup.", "authors": ["Meredith Cash"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da9d03c4af90925630c0ddb?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
