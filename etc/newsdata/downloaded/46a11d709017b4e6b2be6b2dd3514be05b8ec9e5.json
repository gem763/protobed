REUTERS/Simon Dawson\n\nRevenue from Azure increased 59% in the quarter ended Sept. 30, but came in well below last year\u2019s 76% growth.\n\nSince Chief Executive Satya Nadella took over in 2014, Microsoft has been diversifying from its Windows operating system software, and has focused on its cloud services, in which customers move their computing work to data centers managed by Microsoft.\n\nStrength in that business powered Microsoft\u2019s market value past $1 trillion for the first time in April. However, the business faces intense competition from Amazon.com Inc\u2019s (AMZN.O) AWS and Alphabet Inc\u2019s (GOOGL.O) Google.\n\nJefferies analyst Brent Thill said Microsoft\u2019s results \u201cwere strong across the board with nearly all key metrics beating consensus.\u201d\n\nBut Azure was the key metric that missed slightly, said Daniel Morgan, a senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company.\n\n\u201cAzure came in at 59% (revenue growth) and consensus was at 60%,\u201d he said. \u201cOther than that, it was a good quarter, but if you want to throw rocks at it, that is how you would do it.\u201d\n\nWorldwide spending on cloud infrastructure services grew nearly 38% year-on-year in the calendar second quarter to $26.3 billion, according to data from research firm Canalys. Amazon Web Services still dominates the market with a 31.5% share, followed by Microsoft with 18.1%.\n\nMicrosoft shares, up 34% for the year, were 0.25% lower at $136.90 in after-market trading.\n\nThe technology company\u2019s personal computing division accounted for the largest share of its revenue, rising 4% to $11.13 billion. The unit includes Windows software, Xbox gaming consoles, online search advertising and Surface personal computers.\n\nWindows results were boosted by 19% revenue growth for business computers, which was offset by a 7% decline for consumer PCs.\n\nMike Spencer, head of investor relations for Microsoft, said Google Chromebooks continued eat into Windows revenue for entry-level laptops.\n\nNet income rose 21% to $10.68 billion, or $1.38 per share, while total revenue rose 14% to $33.06 billion.
