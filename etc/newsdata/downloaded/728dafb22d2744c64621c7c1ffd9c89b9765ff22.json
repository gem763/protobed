There's also plenty of intrigue upstairs, too, as Dowager Countess Violet schemes to get her son, Lord Grantham, named as heir to a cousin visiting the estate along with the queen.\n\nFans of the original show will likely be pleased with the film version, as it features most of the characters and places from the six-season series. Like the show, the film focuses on a wide cast of characters, with the stories of both servants and nobility being told throughout the movie.\n\nRead more: THEN AND NOW: The cast of 'Downton Abbey'\n\nBut the film, with its focus on rich white people and their servants, will likely alienate those who weren't fans of the original show.\n\nLady Edith, played by Laura Carmichael, returns home to visit her family in \"Downton Abbey.\" Jaap Buitendijk /Focus Features\n\nWhy you should care: It's a big-screen adaptation of the beloved TV show.\n\nWith the last season of \"Downton Abbey\" airing in the US in 2016, many fans were left wondering if they'd see the Crawleys and their quirky cast of servants ever again. Lucky for them, writer and creator Julian Fellowes decided that \"Downton Abbey\" should be brought to the big screen.\n\nWhile the show did have its detractors \u2014 many criticized the show for its conservative politics and glorification of a class-based power structure\u2014 die-hard fans of the original show will be pleased to know that the film picks up where \"Downton Abbey\" the series left off.\n\nDaisy (Sophie McShera, left) and Mrs. Patmore (Lesley Nicol) help cook for the king in \"Downton Abbey.\" Jaap Buitendijk/Focus Features\n\nWhat's hot: The show takes a compassionate look at all the characters of 'Downton,' including minor servants and distant relatives.\n\nOne of the appeals of the original show was its large (if not exactly diverse) cast of characters. Divided into \"upstairs\" characters \u2014 that is to say, landed gentry like Lord and Lady Grantham and their family \u2014 and \"downstairs characters (i.e., servants and lower-class workers), \"Downton Abbey\" the series did an excellent job of incorporating a wide variety of story lines.\n\nThe film is no different. Nearly every character gets some screen time, and while some, like Tom Branson, Lady Mary, and Carson the butler get a bit more attention, the film spends time with just about everyone at Downton.\n\nAnd similarly to the TV show, \"Downton Abbey\" does its best to make you care about the problems of the Crawleys and their servants, even when the \"problems\" are deciding which gown to wear to dinner with the queen, or which one of the butlers will get to serve the king his soup.\n\nIn \"Downton Abbey,\" Tom Branson (Allen Leech) reaffirms his dedication to the Crawleys. Jaap Buitendijk /Focus Features\n\nWhat's not: At times, some major issues are glossed over, while others are given too much importance.\n\nIt'd be impossible to thoroughly examine every issue the show mentions, but still, some moments seem a bit more rushed than others.\n\nTake, for instance, a scene towards the end of the film: Thomas, the only gay character on \"Downton,\" gets arrested after socializing with men in a secret bar. The arrest scene is harrowing and brutal, but the whole thing is over in a matter of minutes, after Thomas' friend and love interest bails him out by masquerading as a disgusted straight man trying to get his friend back to work on time. While they do have a sweet moment afterwards, the entire scene feels more like an afterthought than a realistic portrayal of the hardships LGBTQ people faced in the early 20th century.\n\nRobert James-Collier plays Thomas, a gay butler, in \"Downton Abbey.\" Jaap Buitendijk/Focus Features\n\nThe film's main preoccupation, rather, is the royal visit \u2014 and how the Downton servants are desperate to replace the royal staff in order to serve the king and queen. While the servants all have their separate hopes and dreams, they're somehow united in their desire to serve dinner to royalty.\n\nIt's not that this is unrealistic, or doesn't make for entertaining developments \u2014 indeed, one of the film's more dramatic moments occurs when a footman speaks unprompted to the king (a huge faux pas) \u2014 it's just that all the hand wringing about relatively minor issues can get a bit tiresome.\n\nEdith (Laura Carmichael), Cora (Elizabeth McGovern), and Mary (Michelle Dockery) all help prepare for the royal visit in \"Downton Abbey.\" Liam Daniel/Focus Features\n\nThe bottom line: 'Downton Abbey' is a respectful adaptation of the show, but could be alienating for those who find the plights of rich white people and their servants unappealing.\n\nThe show has never pretended to be anything other than a period drama \u2014 and a pretty good one at that \u2014 but one of the movie's major pitfalls (much like the show) is that it tends to focus too much on all the juicy drama surrounding the Crawleys, and less on the relevant issues of the times.\n\nAbove all, \"Downton Abbey\" is a film for the fans \u2014 not for those who are put off by the problems of the upper class and the idea of live-in servants. The film meticulously makes sure every character has a voice (even if that voice isn't very loud) and is, in general, pretty entertaining. Just don't expect any major social or political commentary with your tea.\n\nGrade: B\n\n\"Downton Abbey\" premieres in theaters on Friday.
