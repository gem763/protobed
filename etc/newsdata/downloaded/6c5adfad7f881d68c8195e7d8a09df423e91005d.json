In some cases, a driver's cellphone can be duplicated on the vehicle's screen, transforming the vehicle into a personal app library. The number of USB charging ports in a vehicle has even become a badge of honor for automakers (the more, the better).\n\nBut infotainment centers and voice technology -- developed in part to allow motorists to interact with their phones hands-free -- are now becoming a distraction, some experts say.\n\nLuxury carmaker Lexus not only added Android Auto to its 2020 RX sport-utility vehicle, but the company\u2019s designers also carved out a designated space near the center console to safely store smartphones. Lexus said its 2020 models deliver \u201ctechnology at the speed of life.\u201d\n\nChad Deschenes, Lexus\u2019 technical training senior analyst, said the company is giving customers what they want.\n\n\u201cPeople are connected to their device, it\u2019s just our current lifestyle,\u201d he told ABC News. \u201cWhether it\u2019s Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, you\u2019ll have full connectivity inside the RX. The ultimate goal is for you to not have to touch your phone.\u201d\n\nLexus\n\nKarl Brauer, who oversees content strategy at Kelly Blue Book and Autotrader, said automakers are essentially integrating the phone experience \u201cwith the driving experience.\u201d\n\nThe technology can be efficient, he said: \u201cIf I am running late I can drive and talk and carry on a conversation without being stationary at my desk.\u201d\n\nBut there are drawbacks, too.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that the systems don\u2019t always work,\u201d he noted. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s easier and quicker to grab the phone.\u201d\n\nBrauer pointed out that cellphone integration can offer a competitive advantage for an automaker when it\u2019s done right. Millennials are more likely to buy a vehicle based on a car\u2019s connectivity, he said.\n\n\u201cMillennials definitely consider things like mobile apps,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re over the age of 40 it\u2019s not such a big deal.\u201d\n\nNewer vehicles let drivers access Google Maps, Waze, Spotify, Apple Music, podcasts and audiobooks with a tap of the screen or voice command. Drivers can also decide to turn their vehicles into roving Wi-Fi hot spots.\n\nBritta Pedersen/picture alliance via Getty Images, FILE\n\nMoreover, apps are starting to replace key parts of a vehicle like the key.\n\nA growing number of automakers including Lexus and Lincoln have apps that allow owners to remotely lock the vehicle, start the engine, schedule a maintenance appointment, locate the parked vehicle, check its status and monitor guest drivers. Lexus even has a partnership with Amazon Alexa, allowing drivers to speak to the virtual assistant via the car.\n\nLexus\n\n\u201cYou can interact with your house as you\u2019re approaching it,\u201d Deschenes said. \u201cAlexa can turn on your house lights or start the car.\u201d\n\nDeschenes conceded that connectivity does have its limits -- for now.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t play Candy Crush inside the car when driving,\u201d he said. \u201cYou cannot respond to an email. Basically what we want to do is try to make a safe connection to your phone in the vehicle.\u201d\n\nGeneral Motors\u2019 Marketplace app, however, allows drivers to order food for pick-up, find fuel stations, pay for parking, make dining reservations and find and book a hotel room through voice recognition.\n\nBrandon Mason, an automotive analyst at PwC, said the push for connectivity in vehicles started to ramp up two to three years ago.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re connected everywhere,\" he said. \"We want that seamless connected experience -- from the home, to the phone, to the car.\u201d\n\nLincoln\n\nBeing connected behind the wheel, however, could reverse the downward trend in car crash deaths over the last 50 years, according to Jason Levine, executive director at the nonprofit safety advocacy organization Center for Auto Safety.\n\n\u201cThe issues surrounding phone connectivity are an excellent example of the auto industry preaching safety but practicing profit-sharing,\u201d he told ABC News. \u201c[Automakers] continue to focus on technology that only increases the use of cellphones in our cars.\u201d\n\nMason argues there will always be privacy and security concerns with third-party apps in vehicles.\n\n\u201cFrom a safety standpoint the driver needs to be protected,\u201d he said. \u201cHow comfortable are consumers with this technology? What data are they allowing to be shared with third parties?\n\nCathy Chase, president of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, said hands-free technology in vehicles does little to prevent cognitive distraction among drivers.\n\n\u201cPeople think they can multitask,\u201d she told ABC News. \u201cVoice to text technology makes mistakes. Then you correct it. You\u2019re thinking about a different conversation -- it imperils drivers and passengers.\u201d\n\nAccording to research from the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety, mental distractions for drivers can persist for as long as 27 seconds after dialing, changing music or sending a text using voice commands.\n\nMike Juergens, a writer for the tech site SlashGear, said he pairs his iPhone to his Audi SUV for one reason only: to listen to music.\n\n\u201cTrying to add punctuation or correct a sentence [while using Apple\u2019s Siri] is often more challenging than if I was actually texting,\u201d he told ABC News. \u201cI think it\u2019s more distracting than it is to take out the phone and text back.\u201d\n\nBrauer said cellphone connectivity also underscores one of the benefits of autonomous vehicles.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bridge toward what you will be able to do in a self-driving car,\u201d he said.", "description": "Technology in new vehicles is making it easier for drivers to stay connected.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Business/lexus-rx-ht-jef-191002_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
