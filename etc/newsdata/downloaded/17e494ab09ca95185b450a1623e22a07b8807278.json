Her husband, with whom she works alongside their 31-year-old son, bought the yatai without asking her when she was just 23 and she had little choice but to pitch in.\n\nRunning a yatai is tough work \u2013 most open around 6pm and don\u2019t shut until 1am. After closing the yatai needs to be cleaned, packed up and wheeled to its storage spot and most of the day before is spent preparing food.\n\n\u201cAt first the motivation was just a way to raise a kid, I didn\u2019t like it,\u201d says Mamichan. \u201cThere were many young people the same age as me, they were really fashionable and playing around and I thought, 'Why is it only me doing all this?\u2019\u201d\n\nOver the years though she says she\u2019s developed a sense of pride in her job and a growing appreciation for the great diversity of humanity to which her yatai has exposed her.\n\n\"I can meet many people including people from outside Japan from many countries,\u201d she says. \u201cIt makes me feel just like I have visited many countries so I don't have to travel around myself.\"", "description": "Street stalls serving bowls of food were once common across Japan, but are now found in just one city, Fukuoka.
