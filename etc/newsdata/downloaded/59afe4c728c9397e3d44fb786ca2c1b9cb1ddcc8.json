They allegedly used a shell company to make a $325,000 donation to a SuperPAC called America First Action; they're also accused of raising money for the campaign of Texas Rep. Pete Sessions, who lost his reelection bid in 2018, as part of a scheme to have the U.S. ambassador to the Ukraine removed from office.\n\nThe case is happening amid the larger impeachment inquiry into President Trump's alleged withholding of aid to Ukraine while pressuring it to investigate Joe Biden, Trump's potential 2020 rival. Investigators are exploring the nature of Rudy Giuliani's relationship to Parnas and Fruman as it relates to Ukraine.\n\nParnas and Fruman were arrested two weeks ago at Dulles International Airport near Washington, D.C., with one-way tickets out of the country.\n\nTwo other men, David Correia and Andrey Kukushkin, pleaded not guilty last week to charges that they worked with Parnas and Fruman to make illegal campaign donations in an effort to clear a path for a new recreational marijuana business.", "description": "Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman were arrested at Dulles airport holding one-way tickets out of the country.
