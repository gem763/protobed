He\u2019s not offering a unique or informed perspective. He\u2019s certainly not introducing new facts, since his relationship with the truth is casual at best.\u201d\n\nThe message follows revelations that Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July phone call to assist Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr with a probe of Biden and his son, based on unfounded corruption allegations. The conversation has fueled an impeachment inquiry into the president, who has been accused of soliciting election help from a foreign government.\n\nDuring the elder Biden\u2019s vice presidency, Hunter Biden worked on the board of Burisma Holdings, a Ukraine-based energy firm from which he made up to $50,000 per month, according to The New York Times. At the time, Joe Biden was pushing \u2015 along with the international community \u2015 for the ouster of the country\u2019s then-prosecutor general Viktor Shokin, who was leading a corruption probe of Burisma.\n\nHowever, there remains no evidence that Joe Biden was aware of the investigation. Furthermore, in May, Yuriy Lutsenko, one of Shokin\u2019s successors who has since left the position, told Bloomberg News, \u201cHunter Biden did not violate any Ukrainian laws \u2015 at least as of now, we do not see any wrongdoing.\u201d\n\nIn spite of that, Giuliani has made television appearances as recently as Sunday to promulgate his theory and gin up suspicion over the Democratic presidential candidate. He has also claimed that Ukraine, rather than Russia, was responsible for the 2016 hack into the Democratic National Committee\u2019s server. U.S. intelligence agencies have already determined that it was indeed Russia that perpetrated the breach.\n\nThe latter allegation prompted Trump\u2019s own former homeland security adviser and current ABC News analyst Tom Bossert to speak out against Giuliani on air Sunday, stating the claim has \u201cno validity.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt this point I am deeply frustrated with what he and the legal team is doing in repeating that debunked theory to the president,\u201d Bossert said.\n\nNow, Biden\u2019s campaign is urging news outlets to cut Giuliani off, warning that he is pushing \u201coutlandish falsehoods and disinformation in the knowledge that it is hard for the corrections to catch up.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour obligation is to provide the American people with an informed, fact-based and responsible coverage and debate of critical issues.\u201d\n\nIn a statement to The Daily Beast, which broke the story, Giuliani said the letter \u201csounds like the usual left wing censorship,\u201d arguing that \u201ceverything\u201d he says is backed up by \u201caffidavits and statements\u201d and that the left is engaged in a cover-up.\n\nTrump\u2019s reelection campaign manager, Brad Parscale, also weighed in on Twitter, asking whether the same request could be made of news organizations regarding the booking of Democrats, accusing the left of pushing \u201choaxes.\u201d", "description": "Aides for the Democratic presidential candidate are warning that Trump's lawyer is spreading \"outlandish falsehoods and disinformation.\"", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9109eb2100003700fdb51d.jpeg?cache=cjybqbmklw&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
