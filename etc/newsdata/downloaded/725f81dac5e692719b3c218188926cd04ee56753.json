It is one of 18 being built along the highway, he says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really going to improve things.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Deforestation \u2013\n\nThe highways were built by the military dictatorship in the early 1970s to populate the remote region, which it saw as deserted \u2014 notwithstanding the indigenous tribes and traditional communities living there \u2014 and vulnerable to foreign invasion.\n\nDeforestation followed as a wave of pioneers \u2014 rural poor enticed to the rainforest on the promise of land and a better future \u2014 began clearing jatoba, itauba, marupa and cedar for their crops.\n\nIt accelerated in the following decades as cattle breeders, soy farmers and illegal loggers slashed their way deeper into the Amazon basin, where more than 20 million people now live.\n\nDuring a recent trip to Para, where Ruropolis is located, an AFP team drove past swaths of land stripped of trees and ranches with names such as \u201cMy Dream\u201d or \u201cGood View.\u201d\n\nWhere virgin forest once stood, herds of Brahman cattle graze on pasture or huge machines harvest grain.\n\nNewly deforested areas were scorched by recent blazes that singed the primary forest, despite a burning ban in the Amazon following an international outcry. The smell of smoke hung in the air until the rains finally came.\n\nThe highways, and dirt roads branching off them, have fueled illicit activities in the region, such as wildcat mining and land grabs.\n\n\u201cIn our research\u2026 in the Trans-Amazonian and BR163 areas, we found that the moment you open a road, you enable deforestation of around 100 kilometers along those roads, meaning 50 kilometers on one side and 50 kilometers on the other,\u201d Socorro Pena, a former researcher at the Amazon Environmental Research Institute, tells AFP.\n\n\u201cBig roads and big infrastructure projects are causing a high rate of deforestation and environmental problems, and are really hurting the local population.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Slow going \u2013\n\nThe more than 2,000-kilometer round trip from Sinop in Mato Grasso to ports in Miritituba or Santarem in neighboring Para should take truckers three days.\n\nBut they often end up spending several days queued up at terminals on the Tapajos River waiting to unload, with port operators overwhelmed by China\u2019s insatiable demand for Brazilian soy.\n\nTravel times are even worse during the wet season from November to June, when sections of the highways turn into thick mud, or when hundreds of wildcat miners block a highway for days to demand legal status, like they did recently in Moraes Almeida, which straddles the BR163.\n\nFransuer, who has been driving for six years, says he sees on average 10 truck accidents a day owing to the poor conditions.\n\nThe number of trucks on the highways is expected to explode in the coming years as grain operators build more ports.\n\nAs many as 6,000 trucks are expected to pull up daily at Miritituba ports in the next five years, once the number of terminals triples to 15, says the mayor of Itaituba, Valmir Climaco de Aguiar.\n\nThat compares with the current 1,500 trucks a day.\n\n\u2013 Dirt and dust \u2013\n\nHighway and port upgrades will cut transport costs for grain growers in Mato Grosso, who will be able to export more of their crops through terminals in the north instead of the south, which are further away from their farms.\n\nBut not everyone in Para feels they are benefiting.\n\nLocals fear increased truck traffic will make the highways more dangerous and churn up more dust that already leaves a red stain on everything.\n\n\u201cI do my washing at night when there are fewer cars on the road\u201d to avoid the dust, says Dayana Rodrigues Melo, a mother of four in Ruropolis, where streets are unpaved.\n\nTemperatures have risen in the region as a result of deforestation, locals say.\n\nExpanding farming has also driven up land and house prices, and replaced food crops that previously supplied the local market, says Sandro Leao, an economics professor at the Federal University of Western Para.\n\nWages and employment, however, have not kept pace. And cell phone service is non-existent outside the big towns.\n\n\u201cThe economic model\u2026 which uses the northern logistical area for transport, favors mainly those involved in the export business,\u201d Leao says.\n\n\u201cThat means the ranchers, exporting firms, big traders and grain exporters.\u201d\n\nBetter infrastructure is also good news for truckers like Fransuer. They get paid around 1,000 reais ($240) for each load delivered to port.\n\nIt could enable Fransuer to do more trips a month and better support his young family, who live elsewhere in the northeastern state of Paraiba.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard,\u201d he says.", "description": "Rur\u00f3polis (Brazil) (AFP) \u2013 Trucker Erik Fransuer spends months at a time driving back and forth on highways that cut through the Amazon in northern", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
