Just as we restricted spending with states that have laws that discriminate against LGBTQ people, we are standing up against states that put women\u2019s health at risk and that are actively working to limit reproductive freedoms,\u201d Mayor Breed said last week.\n\nThese states include: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, West Virginia and Wisconsin.\n\nMayor Breed acknowledges that her protest may not cause other states to rethink their position, but she hopes cities from around America will follow her lead.\n\n\"Although tax revenue from San Francisco alone may not be sufficient to encourage states to rethink their laws, if other cities and states follow San Francisco\u2019s lead, the financial pressure might be enough to prompt policy changes,\" Breed\u2019s office declare according to LifeSiteNews.com.\n\n\"It\u2019s an assault on women and women\u2019s reproductive rights. And it\u2019s also an economic hit on women: If you can\u2019t decide when to start a family, it hits you economically,\" city Supervisor Vallie Brown said while announcing the ban.\n\nIt will go into effect in 2020.", "description": ".10/24/2019 12:28:28PM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Guy Benson", "Cortney O'Brien", "Leah Barkoukis", "Julio Rosas"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/275/8675369e-6f9e-4204-be74-e27a2c17bf1b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
