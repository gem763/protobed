We challenge the government to explain why loot boxes should be exempt from the Gambling Act.\"\n\nLoot boxes have become increasingly popular in video games, with Fifa, Fortnite and others choosing to include them in their online stores.\n\nRepresentatives for Fortnite developer Epic Games gave evidence before the committee, alongside representatives from social media firms like Snapchat and Instagram.\n\nEarlier this year, Gambling Commission chief executive Neil McArthur said loot boxes were difficult to classify as gambling and therefore cannot be effectively policed.\n\n\u201cThe Gambling Act tells us that gambling means playing a game of chance for a prize, and you can certainly see circumstances where a loot box might fall within that definition, but where things become a bit more complicated are when one looks at the definition of prize, and prize is defined as being money or money\u2019s worth,\u201d Mr McArthur explained.\n\n\u201cWhat that means is that the prize must mean something that is equivalent to money.\u201d\n\nLast year, loot boxes were banned in Belgium after a similar commission ruled that they represented an illegal form of gambling.\n\nThe committee also called on games companies and social media platforms to establish effective age verification tools in order to enforce any future bans relating to loot boxes.", "description": "Loot boxes in video games like\u00a0Fifa\u00a0and\u00a0Fortnite\u00a0should constitute gambling under laws to protect children from\u00a0addictive practices,\u00a0MPs have advised.
