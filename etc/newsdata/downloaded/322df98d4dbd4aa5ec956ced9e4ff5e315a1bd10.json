And, to the extent that the soldier\u2019s quotes describe U.S. positions or troop morale, it is a serious breach of national security.\n\nCivilian control of the military requires that elected leaders make policy decisions that the armed forces carry out \u2014 with the sole exception of orders that violate international humanitarian law.\n\nMilitary leaders can offer advice to the president but cannot disobey or criticize his decisions while they are serving in the armed forces. Front-line aoldiers make the greatest and most admirable sacrifices, but they swear to defend the Constitution, not their opinions.\n\nThe following are Griffin\u2019s tweets:\n\nI just spoke to a distraught US Special Forces soldier who is among the 1000 or so US troops in Syria tonight who is serving alongside the SDF Kurdish forces. It was one of the hardest phone calls I have ever taken. \u201cI am ashamed for the first time in my career.\u201d \u2014 Jennifer Griffin (@JenGriffinFNC) October 9, 2019\n\nThis veteran US Special forces soldier has trained indigenous forces on multiple continents. He is on the frontlines tonight and said they are witnessing Turkish atrocities. \u201cTurkey is not doing what it agreed to. It\u2019s horrible,\u201d this military source on the ground told me. \u2014 Jennifer Griffin (@JenGriffinFNC) October 9, 2019\n\n\u201cWe met every single security agreement. The Kurds met every single agreement. There was NO threat to the Turks \u2013 NONE \u2013 from this side of the border.\u201d \u201cThis is insanity,\u201d the concerned US service member told me. \u201c\u201dI don\u2019t know what they call atrocities but they are happening.\u201d \u2014 Jennifer Griffin (@JenGriffinFNC) October 9, 2019\n\nThis American soldier told me the Kurds have not left their positions guarding the ISIS prisoners. In fact \u201cthey prevented a prison break last night without us.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are not abandoning our side (yet).\u201d\n\nThe Kurds are \u201cpleading for our support.\u201d We are doing \u201cnothing.\u201d \u2014 Jennifer Griffin (@JenGriffinFNC) October 9, 2019\n\nTroops on the ground in Syria and their commanders were \u201csurprised\u201d by the decision Sunday night.\n\nOf the President\u2019s decision: \u201cHe doesn\u2019t understand the problem. He doesn\u2019t understand the repercussions of this. Erdogan is an Islamist, not a level headed actor.\u201d \u2014 Jennifer Griffin (@JenGriffinFNC) October 9, 2019\n\nAcc to this US soldier on the ground tonight in Syria: \u201cThe Kurds are as close to Western thinking in the Middle East as anyone. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame. It\u2019s horrible.\u201d \u201cThis is not helping the ISIS fight.\u201d Re: ISIS prisoners: \u201cMany of them will be free in the coming days and weeks.\u201d \u2014 Jennifer Griffin (@JenGriffinFNC) October 9, 2019\n\nThis US Special Forces soldier wanted me to know: \u201cThe Kurds are sticking by us. No other partner I have ever dealt with would stand by us.\u201d\n\nDisappointed in the decisions coming from their senior leaders. \u2014 Jennifer Griffin (@JenGriffinFNC) October 9, 2019\n\nThere is no way to know the accuracy of the soldier\u2019s claims \u2014 which Griffin later posted in a Fox News article co-authored by Melissa Leon \u2014 nor to elicit opposing views from other soldiers. It is simply one soldier\u2019s opinion.\n\nThe sole purpose of reporting this story in public before, at bare minimum, doing more research or asking for comment from senior military leaders would seem to be making the maximum possible impact on a public policy debate.\n\nThat is not what soldiers should be doing, or journalists. It is illegal for the former, and unethical for the latter.\n\nJoel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.
