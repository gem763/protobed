ITV, in particular, is about as indebted to young dead bodies as they are to Simon Cowell, their schedules regularly packed with murky crime dramas in which grieving parents hold back tears, detectives glower over CCTV footage and vanished girls gaze smilingly out of missing posters.\n\nA Confession is the latest to mine familiar territory, with detectives examining a dead girl\u2019s sexual history for potential clues, and the show uncomfortably cutting to adverts as police unearth an abandoned \u201cpair of knickers\u201d in the undergrowth where her body may be. That A Confession is based on true events only enhances the feeling of icky voyeurism, the very real disappearance and murder of 22-year-old Sian O\u2019Callaghan in 2011 providing material for writer Jeff Pope to craft cliffhangers, plot twists and red herrings.\n\nIn fairness to Pope, one of the key figures behind the last decade of British true crime on television, there was a fascinating legal conundrum at the heart of the investigation into O\u2019Callaghan\u2019s disappearance. So sure that the young woman was still alive after she failed to return from a night out, Detective Superintendent Steve Fulcher (nicely underplayed in the series by Martin Freeman) personally interrogated the man he believed knew of her whereabouts without a solicitor present. He was aware that by doing this he was jeopardising his own career and potential future charges against the suspect.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nA Confession\u2019s first episode doesn\u2019t get there quite yet, however. It is cripplingly low on moments of interest, hinging on intrigue to keep us invested, or at least pre-existing awareness of what\u2019s to come. Rather, it laboriously spins through a routine missing-persons investigation, the sleepy suburbs and forests of Swindon providing backdrop to a number of scenes that have long passed into crime drama ubiquity. O\u2019Callaghan\u2019s boyfriend is interrogated, surveillance footage is paused, rewound and analysed, the maverick detective spots something his less eagle-eyed underlings don\u2019t. Much of the first episode is painstakingly realistic, but also dramatically inert.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Gene Hunt (Philip Glenister) in Life on Mars/Ashes to Ashes The 2006 time-travelling cop show, in which John Simm\u2019s enlightened modern policeman woke (\u201cwoke\u201d being the operative word) from a car accident in the thuggish policing era of 1973, spawned an accidental anti-hero in Philip Glenister\u2019s swaggering bully-boy DCI Gene Hunt. He was a character so popular that he spawned a spin-off set in the early 1980s, Ashes to Ashes, in which Keeley Hawes was on the receiving end of his jocular chauvinism. Harvey (Bad Lieutenant) Keitel played Hunt in the US version of Life on Mars. BBC 2/20 19. Martin Rohde (Kim Bodnia) in The Bridge Rohde was the Danish partner (and polar opposite) of The Bridge\u2019s Swedish cop Saga Noren, an empathetic foil to Noren\u2019s Aspergers-ish detachment. Warm and very human he might have been, Rohde was also an unfaithful husband and morally flawed detective, finally shipped to her superiors after Noren suspected that he had poisoned (in prison) the killer of his 18-year-old son. He had. BBC 3/20 18. Gilles \u201cGilou\u201d Escoffier (Thierry Godard) in Spiral His borderline policing methods and former drug habit always made Parisian lieutenant Gilles \u201cGilou\u201d Escoffier a diamond in the rough, but he crossed the line by stealing gold ingots from a crime gang \u2013 enough for his long-term friend and partner Tintin Fromentin to quit the unit in disgust. The question for the upcoming new series is whether it\u2019s also too much for boss and now lover Laure Berthaud? BBC 4/20 17. Jack Regan (John Thaw) in The Sweeney It\u2019s hard to overestimate the impact in 1975 of this hard-hitting (literally) drama about the Flying Squad, shaking up the cosy world of TV police dramas, with \u201cYou\u2019re nicked\u201d and \u201cShut it!\u201d replacing Dixon of Dock Green\u2019s avuncular \u201cEvening all\u201d. Jack Regan might have been honest, but his tendency to punch first and ask questions later became a byword for 1970s-style policing. It\u2019s hard to believe that Thaw grew up to be Inspector Morse. ITV 5/20 16. Andy Sipowicz (Dennis Franz) in NYPD Blue Described by one critic as \u201ca drunken, racist goon with a heart of gold\u201d, the label homophobic could also be added to Franz\u2019s character (first essayed in Hill Street Blues), although Sipowicz did make sporadic attempts to dry out and become more liberal in outlook. Invariably taking the \u201cbad cop\u201d role during police interrogations, it was always unwise to leave this bundle of anger in a comb-over and moustache alone with a suspect. ABC 6/20 15. John Wadsworth (Kevin Doyle) in Happy Valley Sarah Lancashire may have been the star of the show, but Downton Abbey\u2019s Kevin Doyle gave a quietly brilliant performance as cop-turned-murderer John Wadsworth in the second series of Sally Wainwright\u2019s Yorkshire-set drama \u2013 50 shades of horrified guilt and denial crossing his face as he investigated his own crime and witnessed an innocent suspect nearly go down for it. BBC/Red Productions/Ben Blackall 7/20 14. DS Bill Otley (Tom Bell) in Prime Suspect With his stare as adamantine as an Easter Island statue, and his mocking smirk, Otley was the intractable foe of Helen Mirren\u2019s DCI Jane Tennison and the sexist ringmaster of the station\u2019s sneering male clique. He wasn\u2019t all bad, however, and when, in the last-ever episode, the alcoholic Tennison ran into Otley at an AA meeting, he tried to make amends and help her sober up. ITV 8/20 13. DS Stella Gibson (Gillian Anderson) in The Fall Stella Gibson may be dedicated to her job, but her strange fascination with Jamie Dornan\u2019s Northern Irish serial killer Paul Spector always teasingly bordered on the psychosexual. And when it came to the actual sexual, Gibson wasn\u2019t above bedding her police subordinates \u2013 although as Detective Sergeant Tom Anderson pointed out to her after a night between the sheets, he does bear a strong physical resemblance to Spector. Kinky. BBC 9/20 12. Gunvald Larsson (Mikael Persbrandt) in Beck The Stockholm police department\u2019s human battering ram, Martin Beck\u2019s right-hand man-mountain was never one to play by the rules. A former member of the merchant marine, Gunvald was a bully and a misogynist but fans came to love his short-circuiting of official procedure. That said, the character\u2019s funeral after being shot dead was sparsely attended. C More 10/20 11. DCI Fred Thursday (Roger Allam) in Endeavour It wasn\u2019t looking good in the most recent series of the Inspector Morse prequel as Morse\u2019s formerly avuncular mentor at Oxford City Police CID, Fred Thursday, seemed to be going the way of a forged 10-bob note. With a bent new boss, DCI Ronnie Box, Thursday was taking a more muscular approach to nicking suspects and pocketing envelopes stuffed with cash before seeing the light and returning to the side of the angels. ITV 11/20 10. Eddy Caplan (Jean-Hugues Anglade) in Braquo This relentlessly downbeat and violent Gallic take on The Shield (see below), created by ex-cop Olivier Marchal, followed a four-person squad of rules-disregarding officers we first meet gauging a suspect\u2019s eyeball with a pen. It\u2019s all increasingly brutal from there as Eddy Caplan and colleagues combat Parisian criminals with implacable force. What is the French for \u2018an eye for an eye\u2019? Canal+ 12/20 9. William A Rawls (John Dorman) in The Wire If Dominic West's Jimmy McNulty is the nearest that the Baltimore police depicted in David Simon\u2019s peerless drama have to a hero, then Rawls is the closest to a villain. A ruthless career cop whose rise and rise was facilitated by keeping inconvenient statistics \u2013 especially relating to murdered black men \u2013 off the books, he was also a bullying hypocrite, a married man cruising the city's dingier gay bars. Canal+ 13/20 8. Frank Agnew (Mark Strong) in Low Winter Sun The downbeat Wire-wannabe Low Winter Sun started life on Channel 4 before being remade \u2013 Mark Strong included \u2013 by AMC and set in Detroit. Strong played homicide detective Frank Agnew who murders a corrupt fellow cop and stages it to look like a suicide after mistakenly thinking the victim had killed his girlfriend. As in the British original, Lennie James plays Agnew's co-conspirator Joe Geddes. AMC 14/20 7. Dexter Morgan (Michael C Hall) in Dexter Not a policeman as such but the adopted son of a Miami cop who grew up to become a forensics specialist for a fictional Miami police department, Dexter had the perfect cover for his secret double life as a vigilante serial killer. And knowing what his fellow CSI officers would be looking for at a crime scene meant he was extra careful in his methods. Showtime 15/20 6. Chief Superintendent Lorraine Craddock (Pippa Haywood) in Bodyguard As Head of Protection Command, the politician-shielding unit of the Met, Craddock was the commanding officer of Bodyguard's main character, Sergeant David Budd (Richard Madden) and responsible for assigning him to protect Home Secretary Julia Montague (Keeley Hawes). She was also [spoiler alert] the police insider in the conspiracy to kill Montague and make Budd the fall guy. BBC 16/20 5. Chief Superintendent John Deakin (Tony Doyle) in Between the Lines Long before Line of Duty there was Between the Lines, the BBC's 1992 drama series starring Neil Pearson as a new recruit to the police's internal Complaints Information Bureau \u2013 a task hampered because his boss, John Deakin, a tough former RUC officer played with edgy menace by Tony Doyle, was more corrupt than most of the people he was investigating. BBC 17/20 4. John Luther (Idris Elba) in Luther When we first meet John Luther he has chased a villain to the top of a staircase and has his foot on the miscreant's hand as he dangles several storeys up. Will he tread on his fingers and make him fall to his possible death? You bet. Idris Elba brings a brooding intensity to a policeman who will fall in love with the sociopathic murderer, Alice Morgan, he is investigating. They understand each other. Ahhh. BBC 18/20 3. Vic Mackey (Michael Chiklis) in The Shield Vic Mackey and his fellow Strike Team of corrupt LAPD officers used criminal means \u2013 including murder, torture and planting evidence \u2013 to take out the criminals in a TV show that made Dirty Harry look like Mary Poppins. Mackey started by shooting an innocent cop in the face in the show\u2019s pilot episode, a taste of things to come, but he was made somehow sympathetic by an incredible performance from Michael Chiklis. FX 19/20 2. DI Fred Pyall (Derek Martin) in Law and Order Derek Martin, who went on to find soap fame as Charlie Slater in EastEnders, gave the performance of a lifetime as the blank-faced, hooded-eyed copper Fred Pyall, fitting up innocent suspects, putting the squeeze on snouts and nonchalantly taking back-handers from criminals. GF Newman's BBC drama was deemed so shocking in 1978 that it was locked away, never to see the light of day for another 30 years. BBC 20/20 1. DI Matthew \u2018Dot\u2019 Cottan (Craig Parkinson) in Line of Duty Jed Mercurio\u2019s BBC police drama is a positive barrel of bad apples \u2013 a rogue\u2019s gallery where nobody, with the possible exceptions of detectives Kate Fleming and Steve Arnott \u2013 is above suspicion. Craig Parkinson gave a wonderfully slippery performance as DI Cottan, the AC-12 regular with a double life as a crime-syndicate insider known as the Caddy. Any redeeming features? He did die by throwing himself between an assassin\u2019s bullets and Fleming at the end of series three. BBC 1/20 20. Gene Hunt (Philip Glenister) in Life on Mars/Ashes to Ashes The 2006 time-travelling cop show, in which John Simm\u2019s enlightened modern policeman woke (\u201cwoke\u201d being the operative word) from a car accident in the thuggish policing era of 1973, spawned an accidental anti-hero in Philip Glenister\u2019s swaggering bully-boy DCI Gene Hunt.

BBC\n\nRescuing it, and likely the remainder of the six-part series, is Siobhan Finneran, whose work as O\u2019Callaghan\u2019s mother Elaine is so far the one element of A Confession that provokes real surprise. \u201cWe have to be that terrified family,\u201d Elaine says shortly before taking part in a televised press conference appealing for her daughter\u2019s safe return. \u201cMaybe one of us will cry on cue?\u201d she adds, Elaine heartbreakingly familiar with the ins and outs of what happens in the event of a young woman\u2019s disappearance.\n\nLike us watching at home, she too has ingested our cultural obsession with missing girls, in reality and on television series like A Confession. It is a bleakly truthful moment of humanity, but one that, presumably unintentionally, speaks to why these true crime dramas aren\u2019t particularly needed anymore.", "description": "Too much television has been built on the backs of beautiful dead women.
