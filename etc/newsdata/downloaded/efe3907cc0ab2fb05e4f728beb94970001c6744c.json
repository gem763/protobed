Planes carrying prisoners freed by Russia and Ukraine have landed in the countries' capitals, in an exchange that could be a significant step toward improving relations between Moscow and Kyiv. The planes, each reportedly carrying 35 prisoners, landed almost simultaneously at Vnukovo airport in Moscow and at Kyiv's Boryspil airport. (AP Photo/Efrem Lukatsky)\n\nMOSCOW (AP) \u2014 Russia and Ukraine conducted a major prisoner exchange that freed 35 people detained in each country and flew them to the other, a deal that could help advance Russia-Ukraine relations and end five years of fighting in Ukraine's east.\n\nThe trade involved some of the highest-profile prisoners caught up in a bitter standoff between Ukraine and Russia.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy greeted the freed prisoners as they stepped down from the airplane that had brought them from Moscow to Kyiv's Boryspil airport. Relatives waiting on the tarmac surged forward to hug their loved ones.\n\nMost of the ex-detainees appeared to be in good physical condition, although one struggled down the steps on crutches and another was held by the arms as he slowly navigated the steps.\n\nAmong those Russia returned was Ukrainian film director Oleg Sentsov, whose conviction for preparing terrorist attacks was strongly denounced abroad, and 24 Ukrainian sailors taken with a ship the Russian navy seized last year.\n\n\"Hell has ended; everyone is alive and that is the main thing,\" Vyacheslav Zinchenko, 30, one of the released sailors, said.\n\nThe prisoners released by Ukraine included Volodymyr Tsemakh, who commanded a separatist rebel air defense unit in the area of eastern Ukraine where a Malaysian airliner was shot down in 2014, killing all 298 people aboard.\n\nDozens of lawmakers urged Ukraine's president not to make Tsemakh one of their country's 35 traded prisoners.\n\nCritics saw freeing Tsemakh as an act of submissiveness to Russia, but the exchange \"allows Zelenskiy to fulfill one of his main pre-election promises,\" Ukrainian analyst Vadim Karasev told The Associated Press\n\nZelenskiy, who was elected in a landslide in April, has promised new initiatives to resolve the war in eastern Ukraine between government troops and the separatist rebels.\n\nThe exchange of prisoners also raises hope in Russia for the reduction of European sanctions imposed because of its role in the conflict, Karasev said. Russia also is under sanctions for its annexation of Crimea in 2014, shortly before the separatist conflict in the east began, but that dispute is unlikely to be resolved.\n\nAt Moscow's Vnukovo airport, the released prisoners remained on the plane for about 15 minutes for unknown reasons. When they came off, many toting baggage, a bus drove them to a medical facility for examination.\n\nRussia said it would release a full list of its citizens freed by Ukraine but had not done so by Saturday night. .\n\nThe 24 sailors in the swap were seized after Russian ships fired on two Ukrainian vessels on Nov. 25 in the Kerch Strait, located between the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov next to Russia-annexed Crimea.\n\nAnother passenger on the plane from Moscow was Nikolai Karpyuk, who was imprisoned in 2016 after he was convicted of killing Russians in Chechnya in the 1990s.\n\n\"Russia was not able to break me even though they tried hard to do this,\" Karpyuk said in Kyiv.\n\nKirill Vyshinsky, head of Russian state news agency RIA-Novosti's Ukraine branch, also had a seat. Vyshinsky had been jailed since 2018 on treason charges.\n\nHe thanked Harlem Desir, the media freedom representative for the Organization for Security and Cooperation In Europe, for calling for his release.\n\nThe exchange comes amid renewed hope that a solution can be found to the fighting in Ukraine's east that has killed 13,000 people since 2014. A congratulatory tweet from U.S. President Donald Trump called the trade \"good news.\"\n\n\"Russia and Ukraine just swapped large numbers of prisoners. Very good news, perhaps a first giant step to peace,\" Trump's tweet said. \"Congratulations to both countries!\"\n\nHowever, reaching a peace agreement faces many obstacles, such as determining the final territorial status of rebel-held areas. Russia insists it has not supported the rebels and the fighting is Ukraine's internal affair.\n\nA Russian Foreign Ministry statement welcoming the exchange touched on those difficulties, calling the war an \"intra-Ukraine conflict.\"\n\n\"Obviously, the habit of blaming Russia for all the troubles of Ukraine should remain in the past,\" the ministry statement said.\n\nThe prospect of progress nevertheless appeared to rise last month with the announcement of a planned summit of the leaders of Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany - the four countries with representatives in the long-dormant \"Normandy format,\" a group seeking to end the conflict.", "description": "Russia and Ukraine conducted a major prisoner exchange that freed 35 people detained in each country and flew them to the other, a deal that could help advance Russia-Ukraine relations and end five years of fighting in Ukraine's east.
