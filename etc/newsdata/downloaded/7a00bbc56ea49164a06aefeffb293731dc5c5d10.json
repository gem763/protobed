For airline pilots, ensuring the highest standards of safety has always been at the forefront of our flying careers.\n\nThis week, Congress will examine the events that led to these two terrible tragedies and call on the aviation industry and regulatory authorities to make the changes necessary to safeguard the system. It is imperative that the failures that caused these accidents are thoroughly identified and all necessary corrective actions are implemented. This includes improvements in aircraft design, certification and pilot training.\n\nALPA advises aviation regulators to make modifications to the certification process, including the rules that govern certification of \u201cderivative models\u201d on existing type certificates. The experience of line pilots who operate these aircraft every day must not be overlooked, and ALPA experts must have the opportunity to review both new aircraft and iterative designs to provide our valuable input. Finally, a minimum of two well-trained, highly qualified pilots in the cockpit for every flight must be the global standard for aviation safety.\n\nOUR VIEW:5 questions for Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg\n\nBOEING CEO:We are taking actions to enhance the safety of the 737 Max\n\nALPA is committed to ensuring North America\u2019s aviation system remains the safest in the world, and we will be vital to the Max\u2019s safe return to service. The responsibility airline pilots shoulder on every flight is the reason we must be fully informed and involved in bringing the Max back.\n\nAs we have for more than 88 years, ALPA will continue to help identify improvements not only during these investigations but also in the long term through the industry\u2019s risk-predictive, data-driven approach to enhancing safety. We will never stop fighting against those who put profits before the safety of passengers and crews.\n\nWhether it\u2019s the decision on the return of the 737 Max to service or the decision to take off on every flight, it\u2019s only safe to fly when your pilots say it is.\n\nCapt.
