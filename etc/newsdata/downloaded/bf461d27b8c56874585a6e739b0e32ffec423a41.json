I never use a debit card. I use the Fidelity 2% to pay any amount, even 99 cents. In the rare occasion the merchant doesn't accept my CC I will pay with cash. I pull out maybe $100 every 2 months for me and the wife together.\n\nIf I need to pay bills I try to use only my CC but 2 bills can only be paid by cash so I set up it up at my bank site and never at the merchant site.\n\nIf I want to pay somebody with cash I use Paypal because Paypal will verify your bank account in 1-2 days (it's probably the same as creating a link from Fidelity/Schwab to your bank) while Vemno is less secured with no waiting time.\n\nFor gas I use Penfed 5% cash back. I use the same card abroad for all transaction(not the Fidelity CC) because this card has no fees.\n\nFor cash I use Schwab global ATM card. They will pay back any fees which makes it a zero fee card. When we travel abroad I take small amounts of $100 beacuse I don't care about fees, in the last 1-2 days I take just $50.\n\nThe European CC transactions are better, if you eat at a restaurant they come to your table with a small CC reader and do the transaction in front of you while in the US they take your card away for several minutes.\n\nIn the last 3 years my Fidelity CC was compromised twice and they had to issue me a new CC and we had to wait several days for the new CC. To solve this problem I have 2 Fidelity CC, one to pay only bills and one for daily use. We get around $1000-1200 cash back annually.\n\nBasically, my goal is to have a very effective and simple system of just 2 CC in my wallet + one ATM + paying zero fees and we pay all our CC in full every month.", "description": "https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/27/debit-cards-are-dangerous-warns-fraud-expert-and-ex-con-artist-frank-abagnale.html \".....
