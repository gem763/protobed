The resident, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal, was one of the few remaining amid fears of a Turkish attack on the town. Syria's state-run media confirmed its troops entered the town.\n\nSyria's presence in Kobane puts a firm limit on Turkish ambitions in its offensive. The town lies between a Turkish-controlled enclave farther west and smaller areas to the east that Turkey seized in the past week.\n\nTurkey had talked of creating a 'safe zone,' driving out Kurdish fighters from the border region. Turkish forces had shelled Kobane in recent days as part of the offensive but had not advanced ground troops on it.\n\nThe battle for Kobane turned the once-nondescript town into a centerpiece of the international campaign against IS, with TV cameras flocking to the Turkish side of the border to track the plumes of smoke rising from explosions in the besieged town.\n\nThen-U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry declared it would be 'morally very difficult' not to help Kobane.\n\nThe IS extremists were finally driven out in early 2015 in their first major defeat, and an alliance was cemented that would eventually bring down the group's 'caliphate' in Syria.\n\nNow the Kurdish authority agreed to allow Damascus to deploy its military in the town and other parts of northeast Syria to protect them from Turkey's offensive launched after U.S. President Donald Trump pulled back American troops working with the Kurds.\n\nBombs continue to rain down on the Syrian border as Erdogan pledged that his offensive would not end until the Kurds withdrew\n\nOn the road to Kobane: Assad's forces heading towards the border town on Wednesday\n\nOn Wednesday, the U.S-led coalition said it had vacated a cement factory south of Kobane, which had served as a coordination center with the Kurdish-led forces. Coalition spokesman Col. Myles Caggins said that after troops left the base, two U.S. fighter jets launched pre-planned airstrikes to destroy ammunition that was left behind.\n\nThe coalition also said its forces had left Raqqa, the former capital of the Islamic State that was liberated in 2017, and Tabqa, a town to the west.\n\n'Coalition forces continue a deliberate withdrawal from northeast Syria,' Caggins tweeted.\n\nAfter being effectively abandoned by the U.S., the Kurds' turn to the Syrian government for protection has allowed Damascus' ally, Russia, to step in as the biggest power player.\n\nMoscow further asserted that role Wednesday, offering to mediate a resolution to the conflict, one day before U.S. Vice President Mike Pence was to begin a mission to press Turkey for a cease-fire.\n\nOn Monday, Trump imposed limited economic sanctions on Turkey to raise the pressure on Ankara. The move came five days after Trump raised the specter of sanctions in a letter to Erdogan, in which he also said that if the Turkish leader invaded Syria he would be remembered as a 'devil.'\n\nTrump told Erdogan he wouldn't want to be responsible for 'slaughtering thousands of people,' and warned, 'don't be a tough guy. Don't be a fool!'\n\nErdogan defied the sanctions, saying the only way its military offensive would end was if Syrian Kurdish fighters leave a designated border area.\n\nErdogan also said he had 'no problem' accepting an invitation from Russian President Vladimir Putin to visit Russia soon to discuss Syria. But he threw into doubt a planned Nov. 13 meeting with Trump, citing anger over the sanctions that Washington imposed Monday on the NATO ally.\n\nA convoy of military vehicles and busses transporting Syrian regime troops are stationed on the outskirts of the northern Syrian border town of Kobane yesterday\n\nA military convoy of Assad's men on the road to Kobane yesterday before the rolled in to prevent Erdogan's advance\n\nDespite an outcry among both Democratic and Republican lawmakers over the pullout and the Turkish invasion, Trump insisted a fight between Turkey and the Kurds was not a U.S. problem and that things are 'very nicely under control' in northern Syria.\n\n'Syria's friendly with the Kurds. The Kurds are very well-protected. Plus, they know how to fight. And, by the way, they're no angels,' Trump told reporters at the White House while meeting with Italian President Sergio Mattarella.\n\nTrump added that U.S. troops are 'largely out' of the region, adding that if Russia wanted to get involved with Syria, 'that's really up to them. It's not our border. We shouldn't be losing lives over it.'\n\nA Syrian man holding a national flag after the Syrian government forces reportedly completed their deployment in the northern city of Manbij\n\nStill, the repercussions from America's abrupt withdrawal were expanding. Assad's forces are returning to regions of northern Syria they abandoned at the height of the 8-year-old civil war. Moscow has taken a more prominent role as an interlocutor among Assad, the former U.S.-allied Kurds and Turkey.\n\nErdogan's office confirmed the Turkish leader would meet Thursday with Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and said he would travel to Sochi, Russia, for talks on Tuesday.\n\nErdogan said he was not concerned by the U.S. sanctions. He told reporters that chances for his November trip to Washington are 'something to be assessed' after the talks with the American delegation, he said, adding that the sanctions and criticisms in the U.S. constituted 'great disrespect toward the Turkish Republic.'\n\nTurkish forces and Kurdish fighters also battled over the border town of Ras al-Ayn. Turkey said it had captured the town days ago, but its hold appeared uncertain.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in remarks carried by Russian news agencies that Moscow is committed to mediating between Syria and Turkey.\n\nRussia already has announced it had deployed troops outside the flashpoint town of Manbij to keep apart the Syrian military and Turkish-led forces. Syrian forces took control of Manbij as U.S. troops completed their pullout from the town Tuesday.\n\nLavrov also said Moscow will also continue to encourage Syria's Kurds and government to seek rapprochement following the U.S. withdrawal. The Kurds are hoping to reach a deal with Damascus that preserves at least some degree of the autonomy they seized for themselves during the civil war.\n\nThe Syrian town of Ras al-Ain was seen being bombarded on the eighth day of Turkey's military operation against Kurdish forces\n\nA T-155 Firtina fires at the points being specified as terror targets by the Turkish Armed Forces within Turkey's Operation Peace Spring in Sanliurfa, Turkey on Tuesday\n\nLavrov also blamed the U.S. and the West for undermining the Syrian state, saying this pushed 'the Kurds toward separatism and confrontation with Arab tribes.'\n\nIn another sign of Moscow's rising profile, France suggested it will also work more closely with Russia in Syria.\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Jean Yves Le Drian said told French TV channel BFM that France is now looking to Russia, given their 'common interests' in defeating the Islamic State group in Syria.\n\nA U.N. Security Council meeting concluded with no call for Turkey to end its military offensive against the Kurds. Instead, the diplomats issued a brief statement expressing concern about the dispersal of 'terrorists' from the region and the humanitarian impact.", "description": "Speaking in Ankara last night ahead of a meeting with the US top brass on Thursday, Erdogan claimed his forces would withdraw immediately if the Kurdish-led forces laid down their arms.", "authors": ["Ross Ibbetson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/08/19825316-0-image-a-26_1571298085556.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
