Photo: OLI SCARFF/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe Civil Aviation Authority has set up a new hotline dedicated to Thomas Cook (TCG.L) passengers after a number of customers and cabin crew claimed they were effectively being \u2018held hostage\u2019 by hotels.\n\nAfter the major travel operator collapsed this week, some hotel owners have panicked that they will not be paid outstanding fees. This has led to some holidaymakers complaining that they are being prevented from leaving until they pay extra bills for their stay.\n\nThe CAA said in a tweet that \u201cWe have given financial assurances to all hotels with ATOL protected #ThomasCook customers so they can remain in their hotel until they fly home. If you experience any difficulties with your hotel, please visit our website for support and advice.\u201d\n\nIt said passengers can call the new hotline +44-1753330330 as well as visit its dedicated website here.\n\nREAD MORE: Thomas Cook is dead and 150,000 UK holidaymakers are stranded\n\nOn Monday, Thomas Cook finally collapsed after months of trying to seal bailout cash from Chinese conglomerate Fosun and several other firms. It has put 22,000 jobs at risk worldwide, of which 9,000 are in the UK.\n\nIt led to an immediate cessation of trading, stranding 150,000 passengers across the globe and leading to the biggest ever peacetime repatriation of British people.\n\nThe CAA and the UK government, under Operation Matterhorn, have scheduled more than 1,000 flights and will continue until Sunday 6 October to bring back Brits abroad. It is estimated to cost \u00a3100m ($124.3m).\n\nREAD MORE: Only 13 days to go to bring back 135,000 stranded Thomas Cook passengers\n\nOn Tuesday, CAA chairwoman Dame Deirdre Hutton claimed:\n\n\u201cWe ran 64 flights, we brought back just under 15,000 people. That was over 90% of those we intended to bring back, which is actually pretty good for a first day. But I\u2019m conscious that we\u2019ve got a huge job to do still because that\u2019s about 8% of the total \u2014 but a reasonable start.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere were some operational problems and we\u2019ll continue to see those, so again I ask people to bear with us as we deal with the bumpiness of this,\u201d she added.", "description": "Some passengers say they are being prevented from leaving hotels until they pay extra for their stay.", "authors": ["Lianna Brinded", "Head Of Yahoo Finance Uk"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/p_7Z8Uz.43mTbeuTJGV2FA--~B/aD0zMzg2O3c9NDcyODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/3902a680-df55-11e9-bd58-d9eca543df7a", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
