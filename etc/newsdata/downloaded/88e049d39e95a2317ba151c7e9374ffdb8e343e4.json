But experts are saying that worrisome headlines about this esoteric market may be overblown.\n\nThe repo market hinges much of the U.S. financial system, where banks and Wall Street dealers lend to one another to meet day-to-day financing needs. But this week, the repo market has been under pressure, forcing the Fed to intervene by injecting tens of billions of dollars of liquidity.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happened is that in the new world of very heavy regulation of banks, banks have very strong liquidity requirements and capital requirements,\u201d Ethan Harris, Head of Global Economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, told Yahoo Finance\u2019s YFi AM. \u201cBanks want to hold very large amounts of reserves. And so the Fed has been kind of experimenting a bit with just how much do they need in order to keep funding the markets.\u201c\n\nA man passes by the corner stone on the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in the financial district in New York City, U.S., March 4, 2019. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid More\n\nThis week, cash available to banks for their short-term funding needs all but dried up, forcing the Fed to inject $53 billion into the financial system on Tuesday and $75 billion on Wednesday to prevent borrowing costs from spiraling even higher. It was the first such intervention since the financial crisis more than a decade ago.\n\n\u201cWhat they (the Fed) discovered this week was they found the pain point, where reserves shrink because the Federal government was taking money out of its deposits in the banking system,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThat created a stress in the funding market and big spikes in interest rates.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very temporary problem\u201d\n\nHarris added that while the Fed had troubles offsetting the situation, it\u2019s a problem that\u2019s easily fixed.\n\n\u201cThe Fed\u2019s already put a big bandaid on it by injecting more liquidity in the banks,\u201d Harris said. \u201cEventually they\u2019re probably going to have to do a more permanent addition of reserves to banks. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a sign investors should be worried about.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very temporary problem,\u201d Harris assured. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t tell us about any risks to the economy. It was just kind of a rough day for people that are in that narrow funding market that the Fed heavily influences.\u201d\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell suggested as much on Wednesday, saying: \u201cWhile these issues are important for market functioning and market participants, they have no implications for the economy or the stance of monetary policy.\u201d\n\n\u2014\n\nAmeya Pendse is a producer for Yahoo Finance\u2019s live show YFi AM.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "The Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates again this afternoon.
