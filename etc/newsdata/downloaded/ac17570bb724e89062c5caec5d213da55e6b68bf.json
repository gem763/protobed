Technogym is hoping to create a marketplace that encourages price competition and a more diverse range of classes through a revenue-sharing model. It\u2019s a similar model to Apple\u2019s AAPL, +2.66% app store.\n\nRival Peloton Interactive PTON, -3.24% , which recently listed its shares on Nasdaq Inc., carries a slightly different model, streaming its own classes through its stationary bicycles and equipment.\n\nPeloton\u2019s bikes and treadmills cost $2,000 to $4,000, with an additional $39 a month for a subscription. (Technogym hasn\u2019t disclosed pricing for its services.) Peloton lost $196 million in the year through June, according to its most recent regulatory filing.\n\nTechnogym, in contrast, has the advantage of being profitable \u2014 and selling Italian-designed machines. While the shares have increased 125% over the past three years, they have slid 13% in the past six months due to market weakness and political turmoil in Italy.\n\nPeloton\u2019s stock, meanwhile, has tumbled 7.8% since late September amid a broad rejection by investors of nonprofitable, richly valued companies, including WeWork parent We Co., which pulled its planned initial public offering last month.\n\nTechnogym started in 1983 from the garage of fitness enthusiast and industrial designer Nerio Alessandri, then 22. With the help of his brother, Pierluigi, CEO Alessandri developed a machine to tone leg muscles. Technogym now employs 2,300 people and owns manufacturing sites in Cesena, Italy, and Slovakia.\n\nIt also organizes lease agreements with financial partners. While this isn\u2019t a huge revenue generator, it helps boost its user base. What generates more income is a buyback plan, whereby Technogym purchases and refurbishes used equipment. These units are resold to low-cost gyms at a double-digit discount.\n\nIt has a market value of \u20ac2 billion ($2.2 billion) and delivered half-year earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) of \u20ac47 million, just below the \u20ac48 million expected by some analysts on sales of \u20ac295 million for the six months to June. Full-year Ebitda for 2018 were \u20ac134 million.", "description": "Milan-listed Technogym is set to make its foray into streaming-online-fitness classes via digital platforms on its machines, putting the firm on a collision...", "authors": ["Rupert Steiner", "Bureau Chief"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT128_techno_ZG_20191011082000.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
