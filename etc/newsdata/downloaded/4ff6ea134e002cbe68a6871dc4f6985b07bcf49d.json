This is typical of the way the Chinese move this type of prisoner,\u201d the source added.\n\nThe footage starts with images of the alleged detainees next at a train station. The camera then pulls back to show lines of what appear to be large blue containers or cabins in the distance. The alleged detainees are seen wearing purple bibs and black blindfolds, sitting in lines on the ground surrounded by guards.\n\nIt was not immediately clear when or how the footage was taken. The security source told Sky News they believe the images were taken earlier this year.\n\nCHINA'S 'VAST, SECRET SYSTEM' OF AI REPORTEDLY TRACKS AND CONTROLS UIGHURS, A LARGELY MUSLIM MINORITY\n\nThe account that posted the footage, called War on Fear, wrote: \u201cThe people of today\u2019s society always live under the supervision of the government with high technology.

Beijing has denied the accusations and has said these facilities are vocational training centers where Uighurs, Kazakhs, and others receive free skills education.\n\nHowever, in February, Turkey called China\u2019s treatment of Uighurs \u201ca great cause of shame for humanity.\u201d\n\nCHINA REPORTEDLY CENSORING TEN COMMANDMENTS, REPLACING THEM WITH XI QUOTES INSIDE CHURCHES\n\nEarlier this week, five human rights organizations urged United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to condemn the Chinese government\u2019s detention of Uighurs and to call for the immediate closure of government detention camps.\n\nIn a letter to the U.N. chief released Tuesday, the organizations said these actions would be an important contribution to addressing \"one of the most pressing human rights issues of our time.\"\n\nIt was signed by Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, the International Commission of Jurists, the International Federation for Human Rights and the World Uyghur Conference.\n\nIn the letter, they said he had not only refrained from publicly criticizing China but had praised its \"Belt and Road\" initiative in which Xinjiang is a centerpiece, \"despite the human rights concerns it has raised.\"\n\n\"The public silence over the mass detention in Xinjiang in the context of such a glowing commentary sends a distressing message of abandonment to the millions of Turkic Muslims who live in constant fear for themselves and their families,\" the rights groups said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nGuterres strongly rejected claims that he hasn\u2019t condemned Beijing, saying he has spoken out forcefully.\n\n\"I don't think anyone has been more persistent and more clear in talking to the Chinese authorities in relation to this issue than myself,\" he told reporters Wednesday. \"It is absolutely not true that I've only done discreet diplomacy.\"\n\nGuterres said he told the Chinese \"that it is very important to act in a way that each community feels that their identity is respected and that they belong, at the same time, to the society as a whole.\"\n\n\"There couldn't be a more clear message,\" he said. \"So, if there is an area where I believe I've been doing publicly much more than many other leaders around the world (it) is this.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Videos purportedly showing hundreds of prisoners in China with their heads shaved and their hands bound behind their back and blindfolds that were posted online earlier this week appears to be authentic.", "authors": ["Lucia Suarez Sang"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/China-prisoners.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
