But Chelsea\u2019s head coach and technical and performance advisor will have been scratching their heads, wondering where exactly Mount had been asked to start against the Czech Republic.\n\nMount has excelled for Chelsea, earning his England place, on the left side of a midfield three or on the left of a forward trio. But the 20-year-old was asked to play the first half in the number 10 role in Prague.\n\nGareth Southgate has not suffered too many bad nights as England manager, but this was one. His change of formation meant Mount effectively had to start in a front four, just behind striker Harry Kane and, in the first half, it did not work.\n\nIt was an odd move from Southgate, who, in trying to offer England\u2019s shaky back four more protection, effectively left Mount in no man\u2019s land. Southgate admitted as much by changing his formation for the second period, allowing Mount to play slightly further back on the left of a more conventional midfield three. And, unsurprisingly, Chelsea\u2019s academy graduate looked far more at home.", "description": "Frank Lampard was watching with royalty back in London and Petr Cech was in the Sinobo Stadium stands to see Mason Mount make his first England start.", "authors": ["Matt Law", "Football News Correspondent", "Jason Burt", "Oliver Brown"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/11/TELEMMGLPICT000212757235-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq1TJOa7BZ2Re4vzncv8bVrxi4GB-4tR5Il4FFM2mWZkk.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
