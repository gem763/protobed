He's expected to lose a vote in Parliament on holding a general election unless a no-deal Brexit is pushed beyond January, which Johnson has vowed to resist.\n\nOver the weekend, another member of the Cabinet (link), Amber Rudd, resigned.\n\nThere also was positive economic data, with U.K. GDP rising 0.3% in July, which was stronger than the 0.1% expected. Industrial production also was better than forecast.\n\nThe FTSE 100 tends to weaken whenever the pound accelerates, and that was the case again as it dropped 0.28% to 7261.50.\n\nOf companies in focus, Associated British Foods (ABF.LN) fell 3% after it kept its full-year outlook, saying adjusted EPS is expected to be in line with last year. It reported \"strong\" performance in its Primark and Grocery units but a decline in AB Sugar.\n\nIntu Properties (INTU.LN) rose 11% as the Sunday Times reported that Orion Capital Managers was in the early stages of seeking partners for a buyout.\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 09, 2019 05:59 ET (09:59 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
