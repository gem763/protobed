The decision comes on a top of a previous announcement of a ban on high-dollar fundraisers, as well as on donations from political action commitees and lobbyists.\n\nBut Warren had no such restrictions in place for her Senate re-election in 2018, when she raised $25.8 million, of which a campaign aide said $6 million was netted at \u201cbig dollar\u201d events.\n\nTo the Biden team, Warren\u2019s use of the Senate money in the presidential race adds ammunition to its argument that she is not being \u201cstraightforward\u201d with voters, a theme Biden hinted at during Tuesday\u2019s Democratic debate in Ohio.\n\nNow, the Biden camp wants Warren to explain why the transfer of $10.4 million during the first quarter of 2019 does not violate her fundraising pledge.\n\n\u201cSenator Warren has yet to explain whether she plans to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for her $30+ trillion health care plan, or why the $10 million transferred from her Senate campaign to her presidential fund doesn\u2019t violate her pledge,\u201d Biden spokesman TJ Ducklo said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to beat Donald Trump with double talk and dodgy answers.\u201dBiden\u2019s pressure on Warren\u2019s fundraising practices comes as he\u2019s fallen behind in raising money. After keeping pace with other top Democratic candidates during his first three months in the race, Biden\u2019s campaign is now in tougher financial shape than those of many of his rivals.\n\nBiden raised $15.7 million and spent $2 million more than that during the third quarter and ended the quarter with $8.98 million in the bank. That\u2019s millions less than the Bernie Sanders, Warren, Pete Buttigieg and Kamala Harris campaigns, according to campaign finance disclosures filed on Tuesday. Warren had $25.7 million cash on hand, second only to Sanders, who had $33.7 million.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign has argued that it\u2019s been racing to build infrastructure after a later start than others and without the advantage of a stockpile from another campaign account, as he last ran for office on his own in 2008.\n\nTransferring money between federal campaign accounts is a common practice for presidential hopefuls and has also been done by Sanders and Harris, among others in the 2020 race. And, when Biden ran for president in 2008, he transferred close to $3.7 million into his presidential account.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Jennifer Epstein in Washington at jepstein32@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Wendy Benjaminson at wbenjaminson@bloomberg.net, Max Berley, John Harney\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Elizabeth Warren\u2019s campaign defended the transfer of more than $10 million from her Senate campaign account to her presidential bid after Joe Biden suggested the move violates the fundraising restrictions she\u2019s put in place for the 2020 race.\u201cWe\u2019re pleased that our grassroots strategy", "authors": ["Jennifer Epstein"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/s3nSkGc3o_egUbqH4pUNgg--~B/aD0yMTgzO3c9MzMwOTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/7e2b42e030c117454b0c6136a19eb1e2", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
