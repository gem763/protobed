Now, Google is trying something new. The company today introduced a set of \u201cexperimental\u201d apps designed to help users be better aware of their device use and reduce their screen time.\n\nThe apps, which are a part of a new Digital Wellbeing Experiments platform, are very different from your standard screen time controls. They\u2019re open-sourced projects designed to kickstart out-of-the-box thinking, but not necessarily must-have tools.\n\nOne experiment, Unlock Clock, simply shows you how often you unlock your phone.\n\nAnother, We Flip, lets a group of friends or a family disconnect from technology altogether by flipping a big switch. And if anyone unlocks their phone, the session ends for everyone \u2014 almost like making screen time a competitive family sport.\n\nDesert Island and Morph, meanwhile, take an app-centric approach to screen time reduction. The former requires you to go a day with only your most essential apps, while the latter helps you stay focused by giving you the right apps at the right time of day.\n\nThat idea had been popular in years past with Android launchers, like Cover, EverythingMe, and Aviate, for example. In those cases, different homescreen configurations and widgets would appear based on what time of day it was and what you were doing. However, the idea of smartphones that personalized themselves to our needs never really took off \u2014 perhaps because these same experiences could never transition to iOS where Apple\u2019s restrictions limited how much customization could be done.\n\nThe Post Box experiment is one of the more intriguing creations \u2014 it offers to hold your notifications until whatever time suits you.\n\nNotification spam is now arguably one of the worst side effects of becoming a smartphone user. It\u2019s so bad, in fact, that both Apple and Google have had to redesign ways for users to reassert control at the OS level.\n\nEarlier this year, Apple CEO Tim Cook even said that he has gutted his iPhone\u2019s notifications, touting the iOS feature to do so as some sort of miraculous invention \u2014 when in reality it was Apple\u2019s flawed design of the notification system to begin with that allowed developers to continually interrupt us with their irrelevant pings.\n\nA mailbox-style system \u2014 like this new Google experiment provides \u2014 was another obvious choice, but one that wouldn\u2019t have allowed an app ecosystem to blossom.\n\nThen there is the most whimsical experiment of them all, Paper Phone.\n\nThis app will print you a custom booklet of the critical information you need that day, including favorite contacts, maps, meetings, tasks, weather info, and more.\n\nYou can then take a short break from your device, without giving up access to your must-have information. It\u2019s like time-traveling for those of us old enough to remember life before smartphones, and a small gift of freedom for those who have never been without.\n\nGoogle says this new Digital Wellbeing Experiments platform is open for contributions from any designers and developers who want to share their ideas for a more balanced relationship with technology.\n\n\u201cWe hope these experiments inspire developers and designers to keep digital wellbeing top of mind when building technology. The more people that get involved, the more we can all learn how to build better technology for everyone,\u201d said Google.\n\nInterested contributors can download the \u201cHack Pack\u201d and open source code available on the site to get started.\n\nThe experiments only run on Android and are offered for download on the Play Store.\n\nWhile the new experiments are less about fixing existing Google products and more about playing around with new ideas, Google has several other screen time/wellbeing initiatives underway, including its Android native wellbeing features, YouTube\u2019s \u2018take a break\u2019 reminders and other screen time controls, Google Assistant\u2019s wind-down routines, Gmail automations like auto-reply and send later, Google Family Link and more.", "description": "Following the introduction of its digital wellbeing tools for Android at Google\u2019s I/O developer conference last year, the company has since expanded the feature set to include new options like Focus mode and better parental controls for families with children.
