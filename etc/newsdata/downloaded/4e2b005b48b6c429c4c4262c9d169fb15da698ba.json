The review is also occurring amid a broader internal debate over whether to halt or cut billions of dollars in foreign aid.\n\nUnited States military aid to Ukraine has long been seen as a litmus test for how strongly the American government is pushing back against Moscow.\n\nThe Trump administration in 2017 approved lethal arms sales to Ukraine, taking a step the Obama administration had never done. The move was seen as a sign that Trump\u2019s government was taking a hard-line approach to a revanchist Vladimir Putin despite the president\u2019s public rhetoric flattering the Russian leader. Scaling back that assistance could expose Trump to allegations that his policies are favoring Moscow.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Specifically, Congress set aside $50 million for weaponry.\n\nNow, that funding is being called into question. The senior administration official, who asked to remain anonymous in order to discuss internal matters, said the president wants to ensure U.S. interests are being prioritized when it comes to foreign assistance, and is seeking assurances that other countries are \u201cpaying their fair share.\u201d\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper and national security adviser John Bolton are among the officials who were asked to review the Ukraine security funding.\n\nA senior Defense Department official told POLITICO that \u201cthe department has reviewed the foreign assistance package and supports it.\u201d\n\nBut the White House explanation that Trump wants to ensure the money is being spent properly isn\u2019t sitting well with lawmakers on Capitol Hill, where members of both parties have pushed to increase military assistance to Ukraine and U.S. military efforts to deter Russia in Eastern Europe.\n\nThere is \"an at least temporary effect,\" said Rep. Tom Malinowski, a New Jersey Democrat who sits on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. \"The bigger problem is that Trump is once again showing himself to be an asset to Russia.\u201d\n\nSen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, vowed that the administration\u2019s move \u201cwill be met with fierce opposition in Congress.\u201d\n\n\u201cEnough is enough,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cPresident Trump should stop worrying about disappointing Vladimir Putin and stand up for U.S. national security priorities.\u201d\n\nThe funds for Ukraine can\u2019t be spent while they\u2019re under review and the money expires at the Sept. 30 end of the fiscal year. The account was originally created by defense policy legislation enacted in late 2015 to help Ukraine battle pro-Russian separatists in Crimea after Moscow annexed the region in 2014.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of an [Office of Management and Budget] hold on funding for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative,\u201d House Appropriations Committee spokesperson Evan Hollander said in a statement. \u201cWe have serious concerns about a freeze on these important appropriated funds, and we are urgently inquiring with the administration about why they are holding up these resources.\u201d\n\nThe House Armed Services Committee \"is aware of the restriction, but have requested additional information about what it means and is applied to,\" an aide told POLITICO.\n\nIn a POLITICO op-ed in April, Senate Armed Services Chairman Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) called for boosting funding for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative and argued that a bigger portion of the money \u201cshould go to support defensive lethal aid that will make Ukraine a more difficult target for Putin's aggression.\u201c\n\nTrump is scheduled to meet this weekend in Warsaw, Poland, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s broader push to freeze or slash foreign aid that White House officialscontend is wasteful has sparked intense bipartisan backlash, with lawmakers warning of a deteriorating relationship with the White House when it comes to the use of appropriated funds.\n\nThe administration dropped a plan last week amid congressional fury that would have cut more than $4 billion across 10 areas of foreign assistance, including funds for international peacekeeping operations, narcotics control and global health efforts. The administration also backed off a similar plan last year.\n\nRep. Hal Rogers (R-Ky.), ranking member of the House Committee that oversees funding for the State Department, and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations and Appropriations committees, both warned Trump against the package of funding cuts.\n\nTop Republicans and Democrats on the House Foreign Affairs Committee and Senate Foreign Relations Committee also sounded the alarm.\n\nDaniel Fried, a career diplomat who has served in both Republican and Democratic administrations and was most recently the State Department coordinator for sanctions policy, said the review sends the wrong message to a Democratic ally under intense pressure from Moscow's aggressive behavior.\n\n\u201cIf the Administration has a good reason for a sudden cut to security assistance to Ukraine, they should share it,\" Fried told POLITICO. \"Ukraine\u2019s new leaders, in office through free and fair elections, have earned and deserve America\u2019s support, not mixed signals.\u201d\n\nTrump has also withheld hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to Central America and sought to shuffle around federal funds in order to bolster Trump\u2019s immigration enforcement priorities.\n\nFor example, the administration plans to divert $271 million from various Department of Homeland Security accounts \u2014 including $155 million in federal disaster aid \u2014 to beef up funding for its immigration enforcement effort.\n\n\u201cIt is of great concern that during the course of this administration, there has been a growing disconnect between the will of Congress \u2026 and the department\u2019s immigration enforcement proceedings, which often lack justification,\u201d Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Calif.), who chairs the House subcommittee that funds DHS, said in a recent letter to acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, a FEMA spokesperson said the move won\u2019t affect long-term recovery efforts underway in states and territories ravaged by hurricanes, wildfires and flooding.\n\nNatasha Bertrand contributed to this report.", "description": "United States military aid to Ukraine has long been seen as a litmus test for how strongly the American government is pushing back against Moscow.", "authors": ["Caitlin Emma", "Connor O Brien"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/39/58/c195a42a49f39c87e1f7fad9764b/190828-ukraine-gty-773.jpg"}
