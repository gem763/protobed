They can say whatever they want. If it\u2019s their opinion. I don\u2019t really watch a lot of opinion programming. I\u2019m busy.\u201d\n\nMr. Smith has occasionally spoken out against the Trump administration and debunked theories pushed by his colleagues on the opinion side, prompting Mr. Hannity to call him \u201canti-Trump\u201d in the past.\n\nLaura Ingraham, a conservative host at the network, also criticized Mr. Smith\u2019s comments to Time, calling them \u201cinconsiderate & inaccurate.\u201d\n\nAlways liked Shep, but his comments were inconsiderate & inaccurate. The hard working team at the Ingraham Angle does real reporting, develops impt sources and scores big interviews. Very proud of them. https://t.co/3aR1EHAK3Z \u2014 Laura Ingraham (@IngrahamAngle) March 16, 2018\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
