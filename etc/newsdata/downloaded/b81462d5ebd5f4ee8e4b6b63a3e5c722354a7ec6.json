On Thursday, the president cited Smith and Fox analysts Andrew Napolitano and Donna Brazile in a tweet that said, \u201cFox News doesn\u2019t deliver for US anymore. It is so different than it used to be.\u201d\n\nAsked about it later, Trump said, \u201cIs he leaving? Oh, that\u2019s a shame. Is he leaving because he had bad ratings?\u201d\n\nSmith\u2019s show averaged nearly 1.3 million viewers the last three months, the Nielsen company said. That beats CNN and MSNBC. Fox\u2019s prime-time lineup, with more viewers available, generally gets around 3 million viewers.\n\nNeil Cavuto, who anchors the broadcast following Smith\u2019s, looked shocked after his colleague made the announcement.\n\n\u201cWhoa,\u201d Cavuto said. \u201cLike you, I\u2019m a little stunned.\u201d\n\nSmith was one of Fox News Channel\u2019s original hires in 1996, and was a particular favorite of Roger Ailes, the former Fox chairman who was ousted in 2016 following misconduct charges and died the following spring. While he often angered many of Fox\u2019s conservative viewers, Smith\u2019s work was most prominently cited by the network when it received criticism for being too partisan.\n\nOn his afternoon newscast, Smith had frequently given tough reports debunking statements made by Trump and his supporters \u2014 even the Fox News opinion hosts that rule the network\u2019s prime-time lineup.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Smith clashed with Tucker Carlson that started when Napolitano, speaking on Smith\u2019s program, said that it was a crime for Trump to solicit aid for his campaign from a foreign government, in this case Ukraine. Later that night, Carlson asked his own analyst, Joseph diGenova, about that and he called Napolitano a fool.\n\nThe next day, Smith said that \u201cattacking our colleague who is here to offer legal assessments, on our air, in our work home, is repugnant.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with Time magazine in March 2018, Smith said that \u201cthey don\u2019t really have any rules on the opinion side.\n\n\u201cThey can say whatever they want,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of our opinion programming is there strictly to be entertaining. I get that. I don\u2019t work there. I wouldn\u2019t work there.\u201d\n\nOn a broadcast in July, Smith called out Trump over his \u201cmisleading and xenophobic eruption\u201d of criticism aimed at a group of Democratic congresswoman who are minorities, saying the president\u2019s remarks were part of a pattern of distraction and division.\n\n\u201cThe news department (at Fox) has just taken a huge hit with the loss of Shep,\u201d said Carl Cameron, a longtime former reporter at Fox. \u201cFor journalists like Chris Wallace and Bret Baier, it\u2019s going to get even harder.\u201d\n\nSmith, 55, said he is not retiring, although his agreement with Fox will forbid him from working elsewhere \u201cat least in the near future.\u201d\n\nFox said that a news broadcast would continue in its 3 p.m. ET hour with rotating substitute anchors.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press correspondents Mark Kennedy, Alicia Rancilio and Jake Coyle in New York and Ashraf Khalil in Washington contributed to this report.", "description": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Shepard Smith, whose newscast on Fox News Channel seemed increasingly an outlier on a network dominated by supporters of President Donald", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/11/f3913a_tv-fox-shepard-smith-03761-shepard-smith-in-jan-30-2017-file-photo-fox-news-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
