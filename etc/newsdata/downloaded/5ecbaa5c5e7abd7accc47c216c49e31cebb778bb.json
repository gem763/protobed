No, no, no, you don\u2019t need to say something like this. Give me the (expletive) date. Give me the (expletive) date. Tell Dana White the (expletive) date, alright? That\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nHowever, Costa responded on Romero\u2019s post saying that contrary to what UFC president Dana White may have said, he will be ready by April, and wants Adesanya to wait for him.\n\n\u201cO my goodness, are you alive? Stay cool wherever you\u2019re cause this funny skinny clown is my prey. I\u2019ll defeat him on April, as I did with you, old Cuban.\u201d\n\nIf Romero (13-4 MMA, 9-3 UFC) does indeed get the next shot, it will be his third crack at the title. He was ineligible to win the belt for two of them due to missing weight. The \u201cSoldier of God\u201d has been involved in a string of bad luck, suffering close decision losses to former 185-pound champ Robert Whittaker twice, and most recently Costa at UFC 241.\n\nAdesanya (18-0 MMA, 7-0 UFC) recently put on his most impressive showing to date, running through Whittaker, taking him out in the second round at UFC 243 in Melbourne to win the title.", "description": "Yoel Romero responds to UFC middleweight champ Israel Adesanya asking for a date for their fight.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "Mma Junkie Staff", "George Garcia", "The Blue Corner", "John Morgan", "Nolan King", "Dan Tom"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/yoel-romero-ronaldo-souza-ufc-194-18.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
