The home of one of the world's busiest cruise ports. A city with an increasing youth population stemming from the nation's largest public university just an hour away: These are all the \"perfect ingredients\" that Pruett claims could lure in human trafficking.\n\nSo Pruett and other activists are praising legislation signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis this past summer, requiring training for those in the hospitality and medical industries on how to spot and report human trafficking. The law, which takes effect Jan. 1, 2021, affects employees of hotels and public lodging, doctors, licensed massage parlors and spas.\n\nBusinesses that don't comply face fines of up to $2,000 a day.\n\nPruett, who last year founded Freedom Fighters, an organization that supports abolishing a trade where people are sold for sex, believes the bill marks a turning point. She hopes it will boost efforts to reduce human trafficking, sex trafficking, forced labor and debt bondage \u2013 the latter of which finds a person going into slavery as security against a loan.\n\nOn the other side, those directly impacted by the bill \u2013 particularly those working in the hotel, lodging and accommodation sectors \u2013 believe the new mandatory requirements puts more policing responsibility on businesses rather than law enforcement.\n\nA state-mandated training program is being created by law enforcement agencies and Florida Abolitionist \u2013 an Orlando-based organization which offers training preventing and spotting human trafficking.\n\nTraining in Brevard is already happening at some hotels, through organizations including Zonta Club of Melbourne.\n\n\"Zonta Says No\" stresses a zero-tolerance policy for all domestic violence and any form of human trafficking. Since 2016, organizershave visited multiple beachside hotels to provide training and prevention tips. All hotels and other affected industries across Florida must be participating in and complying with training described in the bill by its effective date.\n\nLindsey Phillips, director of external affairs at Devereux Advanced Behavioral Health Florida, recently met with the Florida Restaurant and Lodging Association in Brevard for a presentation on human trafficking awareness. Devereux offers counseling and recovery programs for victims of human trafficking and sexual exploitation,\n\n\"Multiple people working at hotels or owners of vacation home rental properties explicitly gave examples of a time they saw signs or indicators that human trafficking was taking place, but simply did not know how to handle it,\" Phillips said.\n\nMore: Florida doctors must take course in human trafficking as part of new law\n\nFlorida lawmakers decided to do more to combat the dilemma after the state was consistently ranked third in the number of human trafficking cases reported, based on calls made to the National Human Trafficking Hotline.\n\nSince 2007, more than 5,000 victims of human trafficking have been identified in Florida, according to the National Human Trafficking Hotline. In 2018 alone,1,885 calls were made to the hotline from Florida, and 767 of those calls resulted in identified human trafficking cases.\n\nCLOSE Law enforcement and prosecutors explain the difficulties in bringing charges - and the hurdles in convicting traffickers. Jarrad Henderson, USA TODAY\n\nLocal law enforcement officials say the statewide epidemic has not affected Brevard as much when it comes to actual arrests.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t had a significant amount of human trafficking cases, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not an issue in other counties in Florida,\u201d said Steve Bland, Palm Bay public information officer.\n\nPalm Bay has had 10 reports of human trafficking in the last five years. Only two of those resulted in arrests, with charges dropped by the state attorney\u2019s office and no further action taken in one case. One 2017 arrest in Cocoa was turned over to federal agents. In the same time frame, Rockledge, Cocoa Beach, Melbourne and Titusville had no arrests related to human trafficking.\n\nEighty-five hotels in Brevard, and the 26,000 employees involved in the county's tourism industry, will be affected by the new law.\n\nTom Williamson is general manager of Ocean Partners,four hotels in Cocoa Beach.\n\nWhile Williamson does not mind that the new law mandates human trafficking awareness training \u2014 and Ocean Partners already offers such training \u2014 he described the $2,000-per-day fine for hotels that do not comply as an \u201cover the top, unfair penalty.\u201d\n\n\"I like to think Brevard is aware of the risk of human trafficking and remains proactive,\" said Williamson.\n\nOthers say there's still a lack of education for many hotel staff members.\n\nMore: When human trafficking victims live right under our noses, how can we stop it? | Rangel\n\nAnthony Davis raises awareness about the movement of people for the use of sex, forced labor, and servitude as the former board chair of Florida Abolitionist. He is the director of global operations for an expansion program, United Abolitionist, which will open its first field office in Brevard, possibly in Cocoa Beach, within the next few months.\n\n\u201cThe greatest tool we have is awareness on how to prevent human trafficking,\u201d said Davis.\n\nPhillips, too, believes that in order to tackle this issue, the public needs to learn more about it. Dealing one-on-one with many young girls and children who have been involved in sex trafficking, Phillips says she has learned that it\u2019s happening everywhere and no social class is immune.\n\n\u201cTo say that human trafficking is not happening within a community is naivet\u00e9,\" said Phillips.\n\nOver the past year, Devereux Advanced Behavioral Health has served 96 individuals through their clinical programs for trafficking victims.\n\nPhillips says the \"strong collaborative effort\" by Florida\u2019s lawmakers, state agencies, law enforcement and therapeutic service providers in Florida is a big leap in the right direction.\n\n\"This new piece of legislation is one more step in a collective proactive response to combat human trafficking, but we still have a lot of work to do,\" said Phillips.\n\nSupport local journalism: Subscribe to FLORIDA TODAY at floridatoday.com/subscribe.\n\nSpotting trouble, getting help\n\nIf you or someone you know is being forced to engage in an activity and cannot leave, whether it is prostitution. housework, farm work, factory work, retail work, restaurant work or any other activity, call the National Human Trafficking Resource Center at 888-373-7888 or text INFO or HELP to 233-733.\n\nSigns of human trafficking at a hotel could include:\n\nA \"do not disturb\" sign on a door for multiple days\n\nLarge amounts of electronic equipment in the room\n\nAn older male checking in with a younger, anxious child.
