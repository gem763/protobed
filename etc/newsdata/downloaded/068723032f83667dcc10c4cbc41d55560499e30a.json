Everyone, including A\u2019s executives, call it Mount Davis, after Al Davis, the Raiders owner who died in 2011. It is an unsightly heap of concrete that blocks the view of the Oakland hills, and the A\u2019s have mostly laid a tarp over its roughly 8,000 seats since 2006. But on Wednesday, when the A\u2019s host the first playoff game at the Coliseum in six years, the tarp is coming off, expanding the stadium\u2019s capacity by 17 percent to 55,000 fans, nearly the most in the majors .\n\nJoey Mellows, a 34-year-old teacher from Portsmouth, England, who quit his job to visit all 30 M.L.B. ballparks this summer, said that while he was wowed by the classic parks, nothing could match the Coliseum\u2019s atmosphere. \u201cIt\u2019s grungy and it\u2019s grimy and it\u2019s got many quite obvious imperfections,\u201d he said. \u201cBut personally I find that gives it an authenticity and a character that sometimes is lacking in the more sheeny, shiny, brand-new ballparks.\u201d\n\nDave Kaval, the A\u2019s president who has staked his job on finding the team a new home in Oakland, said that, character aside, the A\u2019s can\u2019t survive in the Coliseum. He is well-versed in the history of ballparks \u2014 he wrote a book on his own 30-park tour in 1998 \u2014 and argues that while multipurpose stadiums away from urban cores made sense during the 1960s suburb boom, they are now outdated. Although the Coliseum connects to public transportation, that isn\u2019t enough. People are now clustering in urban centers, he said, and teams need to meet them there to succeed.\n\n\u201cThere is an urban renaissance, especially among younger millennials,\u201d said Kaval, reclined in his box during a recent weeknight game. \u201cSo that\u2019s one reason we\u2019ve been focused on the downtown waterfront location. When you look across baseball and sports, that\u2019s a winning formula, especially as baseball looks to attract younger fans.\u201d", "description": "What does baseball lose if the Oakland A\u2019s leave the Coliseum?", "authors": ["Jack Nicas"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/01/sports/01coliseum1-top/merlin_127264988_512d8f2f-3716-45c6-8879-d995ef530798-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
