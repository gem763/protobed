When Trump\u2019s staff was at its best, it was possible to draw a line between \u201cTrump\u201d and the \u201cTrump administration.\u201d Trump was the deeply unconventional leader who made disturbing public statements and appeared to have a fondness for authoritarian dictators like Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un, but his administration was tougher on Russia than Obama and was refusing to give away the store to North Korea to cut a deal. This is the root of the words/actions distinction that so many Trump supporters rely upon to wave way his wildest statements.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet in both the Ukraine and Syria scandals, we\u2019re watching what it\u2019s like when \u201cTrump\u201d and the \u201cTrump administration\u201d start to fully merge. How does the world\u2019s greatest democracy send a letter to a foreign letter that reads like this:\n\nEXCLUSIVE: I have obtained a copy of \u2066@realDonaldTrump\u2069\u2019s letter to #Erdogan. \u2066@POTUS\u2069 warns him to not \u201cbe a tough guy! Don\u2019t be a fool!\u201d Says he could destroy Turkey\u2019s economy if #Syria is not resolved in a humane way.

It was sent October 9, and the Turkish offensive has not only continued, American troops \u201ccame under artillery fire from Turkish positions\u201d two days later. Now we\u2019re receiving reports that American air power had to be used to intimidate Turkish-backed forces and deter them from approaching too close to an American base \u2014 buying time to evacuate the base and then bomb it to deny its use to our Turkish \u201callies.\u201d Indeed, the offensive continues to this day, with no word (as of this writing) that Turkey has agreed to Trump\u2019s request for a cease-fire.\n\nBut the Syrian crisis is hardly the only example of collapsing guardrails. Trump\u2019s ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, told House impeachment investigators that he was opposed to Rudy Giuliani\u2019s role in Trump\u2019s diplomacy, but had little choice but to comply with the president\u2019s directives:\n\nIndeed, Secretary Perry, Ambassador Volker, and I were disappointed by our May 23, 2019 White House debriefing. We strongly believed that a call and White House meeting between Presidents Trump and Zelensky was important and that these should be scheduled promptly and without any pre-conditions. We were also disappointed by the President\u2019s direction that we involve Mr. Giuliani. Our view was that the men and women of the State Department, not the President\u2019s personal lawyer, should take responsibility for all aspects of U.S. foreign policy towards Ukraine. However, based on the President\u2019s direction, we were faced with a choice: We could abandon the goal of a White House meeting for President Zelensky, which we all believed was crucial to strengthening U.S.-Ukrainian ties and furthering long-held U.S. foreign policy goals in the region; or we could do as President Trump directed and talk to Mr. Giuliani to address the President\u2019s concerns.\n\nThe buck stops with the boss. He runs his own administration. That\u2019s why the guardrails couldn\u2019t last. Yes, officials can resign in protest of policies they don\u2019t like. On occasion, some (like former White House counsel Don McGahn) defy his orders. But over time, the president will get what he wants \u2014 especially in foreign policy, where his power is at its peak \u2014 and when it comes to Ukraine and Syria, that time is now. The results are exactly what you would expect. American diplomacy in a crucial region is hijacked by Trump\u2019s conspiracy theories. In another crucial region, we\u2019ve squandered a key alliance, granted ISIS a much-needed reprieve, and watched as Russians give their citizens guided tours of a recently abandoned American base. This is most assuredly not what \u201cwinning\u201d looks like.", "description": "The Syrian crisis is hardly the only example of President Trump's collapsing guardrails.", "authors": ["David French", "Jim Geraghty", "Kevin D.
