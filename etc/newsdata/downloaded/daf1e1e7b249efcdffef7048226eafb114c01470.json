Those ties have become strained, and he told the audience in Chicago the world\u2019s institutions now needed to adjust their settings for China, in recognition of its new developed status.\n\nThat\u2019s now been rejected by China, potentially creating a new source of tension with Australia.\n\n\u201cChina is still a developing country, which is widely acknowledged by the international community,\u201d the embassy said in the statement, adding per capita gross domestic product in the country is less than $10,000, or about 16% of U.S. per capita GDP and 17% of Australia\u2019s.\n\n\u201cChina still has a long way to go to achieve full modernization,\u201d it said.", "description": "China Rejects as \u2018Unfair\u2019 Suggestions It\u2019s a Developed Economy", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic30d364b09f6178a54d4d90a7cd0a85d0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
