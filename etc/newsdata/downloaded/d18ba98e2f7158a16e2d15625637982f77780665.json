He saw the score and time. Patriots 31, Redskins 0. And it was only midway through the third quarter. He muttered to no one in particular, \u2018Man, you\u2019ve got to be kidding me.\u2019\n\nRecalling the moment 12 years later, the former Redskins linebacker lets out a deep breath.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re bringing back bad memories,\u201d Fletcher said over the phone.\n\nThat afternoon, the Redskins lost 52-7 \u2014 their largest margin of defeat since 1961. For four quarters, quarterback Tom Brady, then 30, dissected Washington\u2019s defense. He threw three touchdowns and even rushed for a career-high two scores.\n\nIt was Brady at his peak.\n\nOn Sunday at FedEx Field, the Redskins will face an older Brady \u2014 he\u2019s 42 now \u2014 who. logic would seem to dictate, is past his prime. But the 19-year veteran is just months removed from his most recent Super Bowl title and has shown little sign of slowing down.\n\nBecause the Patriots play in the AFC, this will be only his fifth time facing the Redskins.\n\nGiven his age, it could also be the last. Brady plans to play until he\u2019s 45, but even then, he won\u2019t face Washington again unless he switches teams or they meet in the Super Bowl. (Don\u2019t hold your breath.) After Sunday, the Redskins are not scheduled to face the Patriots again until 2023.\n\nBrady may not have a storied history of destroying the Redskins, but the defenders who have faced him in those four games still have horror stories.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like having surgery,\u201d former Redskins cornerback Fred Smoot says, \u201cand the doctor gave you no anesthetic, so you feel everything.\u201d\n\nNo margin for error\n\nThe first meeting between Brady and the Redskins may be the most surprising: Washington won. On Sept. 28, 2003, the Redskins picked off Brady three times and prevailed 20-17.\n\nIn hindsight, the victory is especially hard to comprehend given two things. That year, Washington finished 5-11, leading to the dismissal of Steve Spurrier. And after the loss, the Patriots ran the table \u2014 ripping off 15 straight wins, finishing as the Super Bowl champions.\n\n\u201cThat game is really a tale of two seasons,\u201d said former Redskin Matt Bowen, who is now an analyst for ESPN.\n\nThe hardest part about facing Brady is his anticipation said Bowen, who played safety. No matter what the Redskins tried before the snap, Brady would recognize what the defense was trying to do\n\nUsing just his eyes, Brady can manipulate defenders, subtly moving linebackers by looking one way and firing off to a newly created window to find the receiver.\n\n\u201cHe does that almost every drop-back pass,\u201d Bowen said.\n\nIt makes preparing for Brady a nightmare.\n\nDuring his playing career, Smoot said he wanted to be aware of his own weaknesses as a player \u2014 especially when it came to preparing for the Patriots. He knew Brady was the type of quarterback who could exploit any flaw or tendency a player revealed on film. And if that player was good enough to not reveal those tendencies on game day, Brady would simply move on until he found another player to pick on, Smoot said.\n\n\u201cHe really makes us a prisoner of our defensive coordinator,\u201d Smoot said. \u201cIf our defensive coordinator puts us in Cover 3, he\u2019s going to throw hitches all day. If he puts us in Cover 2, he\u2019s going to move to the tight end or running back real quick.\n\n\u201c(Brady) is only going to go to the weakness of the defense.\u201d\n\nGetting Brady off his game isn\u2019t impossible, but it\u2019s not an easy task. The Redskins were able to prevail in 2003 because they relentlessly generated pressure. Bowen said Washington relied on quarters coverage to take away New England\u2019s crossing routes.\n\nBut the Redskins are 0-3 against Brady since.\n\nThe 2007 matchup, in particular, is the third-largest margin of victory in Brady\u2019s career. Smoot distinctly remembers the cannon that fired off at Gillette Stadium after every Patriots\u2019 score.\n\n\u201cThey shot so many cannons, I literally thought I was in World War II,\u201d Smoot said. \u201cThey just scored so many points.\u201d\n\nReinventing the wheel\n\nWhen Bowen studies the Patriots\u2019 offense, he sees all the routes and concepts that have become staples in the Brady and Bill Belichick era. He even sees some overlap in player skill sets.\n\nBut the Patriots haven\u2019t won six Super Bowls with Brady by doing the same things year after year. Instead, New England has tinkered with its approach \u2014 from revolutionizing football in 2007 with relying on the shotgun, to keeping defenses off balance with a variety of formations and personnel groupings.\n\nThe Patriots\u2019 history of matchups against the Redskins highlight the franchise\u2019s ability to adapt.\n\nThe 2007 massacre featured Brady throwing to the likes of Randy Moss and Wes Welker. In 2011, when the Patriots won 34-27, tight end Robert Gronkowski took over with 160 yards and two touchdowns. Four years later, LeGarrette Blount rushed for 129 yards in a 27-10 win.\n\nBrady is the engine at the center of it all.\n\n\u201c12 runs the show,\u201d Redskins coach Jay Gruden said.\n\nFour wins into 2019, and Brady is still playing at a high level. He ranks 15th in passing yards and New England has the ninth-most efficient offensive in the league, according to Football Outsiders\u2019 DVOA rankings.\n\nThe Patriots have a deep threat (Josh Gordon), a steady slot receiver (Julian Edelman) and a pass catching back (James White), all of whom should pose problems for a struggling Redskins defense.\n\nWashington, understandably, is a significant underdog.\n\n\u201c(Brady\u2019s) considered to be the greatest of all time for a reason,\u201d Fletcher said. \u201cThe way he continues to challenge himself and never be satisfied with what he\u2019s accomplished. He\u2019s definitely the fiercest competitor I\u2019ve ever faced at the quarterback position.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
