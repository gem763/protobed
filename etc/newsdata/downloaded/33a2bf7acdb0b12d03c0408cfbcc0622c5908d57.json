Though there were few product surprises in Apple\u2019s latest announcements, the company\u2019s approach to pricing was unexpected and indicated a change in strategy.\n\nApple shares gained 3.2% Wednesday, giving it a market capitalization of $1.01 trillion. Apple shares have climbed 40% so far this year, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.85% , which counts Apple as a component, has risen 16%.\n\nIn notes released Wednesday morning, analysts said they expected the company\u2019s pricing moves to make its ecosystem more affordable, though they were divided on whether this approach will have a meaningful impact on the company\u2019s financials in the months to come.\n\nOpinion: Apple iPhone event reveals a dramatic change in strategy\n\n\u201cWe believe lower [average selling prices] make sense as price elasticity has really kicked in for iPhones this year,\u201d wrote Barclays analyst Tim Long, who rates the stock at equal weight and upped his target price to $207 from $192. \u201cWhile all these actions should help units, we believe gross margins will come under more pressure.\u201d\n\nSee more: Apple drops price on new iPhone 11, undercuts Netflix and Disney on streaming\n\nFactSet. <arletWatcj\n\nLong called Apple\u2019s $4.99 monthly price point for the Apple TV+ video service \u201creasonable\u201d given the company has a limited library at the outset, especially relative to competitors like Walt Disney Co.\u2019s DIS, +0.29% Disney+ and Netflix Inc. NFLX, +0.10% . Apple is giving away a year of the service for free if users buy a new device, which Long expects will help the company amass a sizable base of subscribers at the outset, but at the expense of margins. This comes as Apple is reportedly spending billions of dollars on programming.\n\nMacquarie analyst Benjamin Schachter said that Apple\u2019s offer for a free year of Apple TV+ with the purchase of a device suggests that the company is prioritizing lifetime value of its customer base and seems likely to offer a bundle similar to Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s AMZN, +0.13% Prime down the line. While he thinks the new services could help boost Apple\u2019s ecosystem, he doubts they will be able to move the needle much for Apple.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t view any of the new subscription products (video, games, news, music) as remotely meaningful to earnings on a stand-alone basis,\u201d he wrote in a note to clients. \u201cServices are not all created equal and investors should keep in mind the margin profile of each offerings. In our view, even if video is a wild success for Apple (attracting 50%-100% of Netflix subs), it wouldn\u2019t move long-term EPS more than 0.5%.\u201d\n\nSchachter rates the stock at neutral with a $210 target.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: What sets the Apple credit card apart? It wasn\u2019t created by a bank, company says\n\nBernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi was more upbeat, saying it was an \u201cextremely clever\u201d move for Apple to bundle Apple TV+ with new devices and offer a low price for other subscribers.\n\n\u201cApple TV+ will now potentially reach 200 million+ Apple customers in its first year of existence,\u201d wrote Sacconaghi, who has a market-perform rating and $205 target on the shares. \u201cEven if only a fraction of those customers converts to paid subscriptions after 12 months \u2014 which, at only $5 per month, increases the odds of conversion \u2014 Apple TV+ could accumulate tens of millions of paid subscriptions by the end of 2020 \u2013 potentially making it larger than Disney+.\u201d\n\nNeedham analyst Laura Martin wrote that the announcements should all help Apple reduce its churn rates.\n\n\u201cOur research shows that a second product lowers churn by 25% and a third product lowers it by an additional 10%,\u201d Martin said in a research note. \u201cWe love Apple\u2019s focus on Watch and iPad as add-on products which lower churn. Arcade and AppleTV+ adoption add disincentives to churn. If the Arcade and Apple+ services collectively keep users one year extra, we estimate this adds $5 billion to $20 billion to Apple\u2019s revenue, depending on purchases of iPhones, iPads, Watches & Macs during that extra year.\u201d\n\nShe argued that the $4.99 monthly cost of Apple TV+ starts a price war with Netflix and others: \u201cApple\u2019s balance sheet won\u2019t lose this war, but Netflix might.\u201d She has a strong buy rating on the stock and boosted her price target to $250 from $225.\n\nRead: Apple\u2019s iPhone 11 design is triggering \u2018trypophobia\u2019 in some people\n\nBut Bank of America\u2019s Nat Schindler doesn\u2019t think Netflix investors should be sweating the Apple TV+ arrival. \u201cApple TV+\u2019s 9 titles available at launch is dwarfed by what we counted as over 400 original series titles available on Netflix today, many with multiple seasons (does not count movies),\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe see Apple TV+ as likely to be hit-driven in the near term, with subscribers turning it on and off based on whether a series gains mainstream appeal.\u201d\n\nSchindler has a buy rating and $450 price objective on Netflix\u2019s stock, while his colleague Wamsi Mohan has a buy rating on Apple shares and a new price objective of $250, up from $240 prior to the event.", "description": "Apple Inc. reclaimed its status as a trillion-dollar company Wednesday, hitting that level for the first time since early November of last year on the day...", "authors": ["Emily Bary"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR092_AppleT_ZG_20190911111936.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
