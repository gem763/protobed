Typically, refineries run at their optimum during the peak summer driving season, averaging 95% to 98%.\n\nAdded Kilduff:\n\n\u201cAn 83% run rate is super low, even for a post-driving season. I haven\u2019t seen that in years.\u201d\n\nThe net effect of such a low run rate is a crude that came in at 9.3 million barrels last week, more than triple expectations. While in theory, that should have sent oil prices down like a stone and left bears in delirious joy, the market actually ended higher on the day.\n\nWTI 15-Min Chart - Powered by TradingView\n\nsettled up 1% at $53.93 per barrel.\n\nclosed 0.8% higher at $59.91.\n\nTraders Wising Up To Stunning Drop In Fuel Inventories, Some Say\n\nThe main reason for the rebound, it appears, is traders taking stock of something else in the EIA data that worried them more: a stunning drop in stockpiles of both gasoline and distillates, the two key fuel components processed from crude.\n\nfell by 2.56 million barrels last week, versus expectations for a drawdown of about 1.21 million barrels, the EIA data showed.\n\nDistillate inventories fell by 3.8 million barrels, against forecasts for a decline of about 2.4 million barrels. , which comprise to a variety of \u201cheavy-blends\u201d that include diesel, jet and maritime fuels, dropped 13 million barrels over just four weeks.\n\nAnalysts bullish on oil, like Phil Flynn at Chicago\u2019s Price Futures Group, have been warning that prices of fuel\u2014and by extension, crude\u2014could take off like a rocket in coming weeks when refiners return in full force to further deplete inventories.\n\nSaid Flynn:\n\n\u201cThe demand for ultra-low sulfur diesel is exploding and due to the IMO rules that go into effect on January 1, there is a scramble for supply.\u201d\n\nIMO Rules Could Change Fuels Landscape\n\nFrom 2020 onward, the International Maritime Organization, or IMO, will ban ships from using fuels with a sulfur content above 0.5%, compared with 3.5% now. The new regulations are expected to cause the biggest shake-up in decades for the oil and shipping industries.\n\nThe current phenomenon of low refinery runs seems caused by greater numbers of refineries going offline this fall and taking even longer to return to ensure compatibility with the upcoming fuel rules.\n\nThe IMO rules state that only ships fitted with sulfur-cleaning devices\u2014known as scrubbers\u2014will be allowed to continue burning high-sulfur fuel.\n\nShip owners can also opt for other sources of cleaner fuel such as liquefied .\n\nFailure to comply will result in fines or vessels being detained, which could affect vital requirements like insurance cover. The actual enforcement will be policed by flag and port states rather than the IMO.\n\nWorry Over How Refiners Will Cope\n\nOne of the major issues is whether there will be enough quantities of compliant fuel around ports across the world, which is vital for ships planning sailings.\n\nThis is where the refiners come in. While they are taking inordinately long with their plant turnarounds to meticulously check that they meet every IMO requirement, once they return, their processing rates might be extraordinary, said analysts like Flynn.\n\nHe added:\n\n\u201cRefiners are going to have to ramp up quickly to avoid spot shortages and offset the potential of a major diesel price spike.\u201d\n\nFuel complications aside, the oil tanker industry has also been bogged down by a meteoric spike in shipping rates after the sensational mid-September attack on Saudi oil infrastructure and a spate of other assaults on crude-carrying vessels in the Persian Gulf.\n\nAccording to assessments of VLCC (Very Large Crude Carrier) spot rates issued by Clarksons Platou Securities, rates peaked on Oct. 11 at an average of $295,100 per day, before falling to $194,900 per day on Oct. 15.\n\nPrices Won\u2019t Rise Easily, Others Say\n\nStill, not all are convinced that the combination of the IMO rules, stiff shipping rates and geopolitical tensions will provide enough combustion for crude prices.\n\nOlivier Jakob, founder of oil risk consultancy PetroMatrix in Zug, Switzerland, said in a recent note:\n\n\u201c lack directional conviction. Strong resistance is still defined at $60 and $54.00 WTI. But the selling pressure is also not convincing. So, we are stuck in a range.\u201d", "description": "Commodities Analysis by Investing.com (Barani Krishnan/Investing.com) covering: Brent Oil Futures, Crude Oil WTI Futures, Natural Gas Futures, Heating Oil Futures.
