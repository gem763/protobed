Visitor numbers in July were down 4.8% year on year but in August and September, down by 30% to 40%.\n\nRetail figures and hotel occupancy for August were both down a quarter year on year, she said.\n\nEarlier a member of her cabinet, Ip Kwok-him, had floated the idea of internet curbs to try to contain the four-month old protest movement, which is leaderless and has been organised largely through online forums and encrypted messaging.\n\nSpeaking to journalists ahead of a regular meeting of the executive council \u2013 Lam\u2019s cabinet \u2013 she said it was too early to assess if the mask ban had been effective, but she did not regret passing it. \u201cWe have had enough chaos, it\u2019s been four months,\u201d she said.\n\nTed Cruz says NBA is 'assisting Chinese censorship' over Hong Kong tweet Read more\n\nOn Monday night police again clashed with crowds across Hong Kong. Lam claims the face mask ban is needed to stop violence but critics say it is a dangerous assault on civil rights that has only spurred fresh outrage and protests.\n\nAsked if she would rule out asking the government in Beijing for help if Hong Kong authorities were not able to quash the protest movement, Lam said that for now she believed her government could handle the situation.\n\n\u201cAt this point I strongly feel that we should find the solutions ourselves, that is also the position of the central government [in mainland China],\u201d she said. \u201cBut if the situation becomes so bad, then no options could be ruled out, if we want Hong Kong to at least have another chance.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam Photograph: Nicolas Asfouri/AFP via Getty Images\n\nLam condemned the \u201cserious and widespread\u201d damage, and called protesters \u201clawless\u201d rioters trying to create a climate of fear, who were preventing the city from returning to normal life.\n\nWith parts of the metro shut, there were long queues for busses and heavy traffic across the island. The economy is also flagging, with the impact of protests on key tourism and retail sectors compounding the impact of the US China trade war; the city faces slipping into recession for the first time in a decade.\n\nOn Monday, prosecutors brought the first charges brought under the new law on face masks. Supporters wearing masks filled the courtroom, producing the surreal sight of two people being charged for breaking the law, while surrounded by dozens of others committing exactly the same offence.\n\nLater, riot police used tear gas in at least three areas and arrested demonstrators in several other parts of the city. Protesters built barricades, attacked businesses thought to be pro-China and vandalised two metro stations.\n\nHong Kong protesters defy the mask ban \u2013 in pictures Read more\n\nThe protests were originally sparked by an extradition bill that would have allowed people to be sent for trial in mainland China, but have swelled into a much broader movement with goals including greater democracy and an independent investigation of police brutality.\n\nIt is the biggest political crisis for the territory since the handover from British colonial rule in 1997, and one of the most serious challenges to Xi since he took power.", "description": "Leader feels city authorities can handle situation but says no option can be ruled out", "authors": ["Emma Graham-Harrison", "Verna Yu"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc68d7ca1a468b6f08172d36c5b84b09a7f6ed4c/0_272_4096_2458/master/4096.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4f28c45b5c8433690b99fd11fe57946f", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
