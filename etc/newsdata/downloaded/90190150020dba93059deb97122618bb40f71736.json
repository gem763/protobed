Mr Justice Teare rejected the claim that New Balance had not acted in good faith when submitting the matching offer, which had been another element of Liverpool's case.\n\nNew Balance immediately applied for permission to appeal the judgment, but this was dismissed.", "description": "The Premier League leaders\u00a0won a High Court battle against their kit sponsors last week that will enable them to take up a lucrative five-year deal with Nike but New Balance have now filed an appeal.", "authors": ["Max Winters For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/12/20324448-0-image-a-5_1572352384221.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
