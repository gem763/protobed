I believe it was moving there even before Brexit, but clearly Brexit has become a catalyst for it.\n\n'What is important to note is the German example.\n\n'I think with the Berlin Wall, Germany was reunited within a year... the fact that events overtook and the country was unified within a year.'\n\nSinn Fein vice president Michelle O'Neill, pictured in Belfast on September 24, said today that the 'genie is out of the bottle' on the issue of a united Ireland\n\nCritics believe the Brexit deal put forward by Boris Johnson, pictured in the House of Commons today, which could see Northern Ireland treated differently to the rest of the UK could fuel calls for a united Ireland\n\nMs O'Neill said the 'genie is out of the bottle' when it comes to the issue of a united Ireland.\n\n'The prudent thing now is to start planning for it,' she continued.\n\n'If the Irish government does not want to fall into the same trap as the British government has in terms of Brexit, then now is the time to plan and have that conversation.'\n\nShe said negotiations between the UK, EU and Ireland must take place before any border poll, so the 'disorder' caused by Brexit will not happen again.\n\n'The conversation does not have to be rancorous, it can be done in a very inclusive way,' she added.\n\nLoyalists in Belfast held a meeting last night to warn Boris Johnson that they 'will not tolerate an economic united Ireland' amid a growing backlash over his Brexit deal.\n\nLoyalist spokesman Jamie Bryson said there is 'immense anger' within loyalism around the current proposed Brexit agreement.\n\nAsked whether preparations between the Irish and UK government about a border poll on Irish unity could inflame loyalist tensions, Ms O'Neill described the Belfast meeting as a 'worrying development'.\n\n'I believe that (meeting) needs to be condemned by political unionism,' she said.\n\n'I don't think it is a tolerable situation to say that the UDA and UVF were in a meeting in Belfast last night discussing how they are going to respond to Brexit - I think the most mature thing to do is for political leaders to be political leaders, for people to plan for the future.\n\n'The Irish Government must convene that conversation because I believe people who have a British identity will engage in that conversation,' she said.\n\nCritics believe the Brexit deal put forward by Mr Johnson, which could see Northern Ireland treated differently to the rest of the UK, could fuel calls for a united Ireland.", "description": "A vote on whether there should be a united Ireland is likely to take place within the next five years because of Brexit chaos,\u00a0Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O'Neill suggested today.", "authors": ["Jack Maidment", "Deputy Political Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/16/20042536-0-image-a-4_1571759344702.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
