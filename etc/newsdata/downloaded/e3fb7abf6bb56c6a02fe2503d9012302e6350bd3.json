When they are a few kilometres away, they communicate with each other and the one in front slows down in order that the follower comes close.\n\nWhen they are close enough, onboard cameras switch on and guided by camera, one latches on to the other and the two become a larger structure. This can be achieved only if the vehicle also carries the astronauts can dock with the space station.\n\nThis mission will only be carried out after after the human spaceflight programme or Gaganyaan mission launches December 2021. Docking will be a key capability in future space operations and ISRO\u2019s first step in that direction \u2013SPADEX\u2014will happen next year.", "description": "Docking refers to connecting of two flying objects in space, either to transfer men or material from one to the other, or two join two structures to make a bigger one.The upcoming project is a space docking experiment called Spadex and reports state that it's a 'building-block' process of setting up India's very own space station.", "authors": ["Kc Archana"], "top_image": "https://media.indiatimes.in/media/facebook/2019/Oct/space_1570084489_800x420.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
