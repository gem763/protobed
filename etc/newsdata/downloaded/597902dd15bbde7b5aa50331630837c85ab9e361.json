Gove tells the programme that he felt \u201csome of the conversations we had were attempts on his part to reassure himself that our friendship would mean that I wouldn\u2019t stray from the fold\u201d.\n\nOthers involved in the Tory government at the time also speak of how the emotional ties due to the closeness of Cameron\u2019s family with Gove\u2019s family had an effect on decision-making, coming to a bitter head when Gove, then education secretary, was demoted. Gove was moved in the reshuffle of summer 2014 to the post of chief whip. Cameron says Gove had wanted to become chief whip and speaks of his surprise when the other sent him an email in the midst of the reshuffle saying that he did not want that job.\n\nDavid Laws, a Liberal Democrat minister in the coalition government, tells the programme that the consequences of the breakdown of the relationship between Cameron and Gove were enormous for the future of the country.\n\n\u201cQuite simply,\u201d he says, \u201cwe might never have had that referendum vote to leave the European Union without Michael\u2019s demotion in 2014.\u201d\n\nIn a preview of the series this week, at the BBC, the executive producer Denys Blakeway said that during hours of interviews Cameron was asked if he felt any remorse over the EU referendum. The former prime minister chose deliberately, he said, to use the word \u201cregret\u201d instead.\n\nBoris Johnson had agreed to be interviewed for the programme but cancelled on two occasions, according to Blakeway.", "description": "Former PM admits he wanted \u2018raised eyebrow\u2019 from monarch in referendum campaign", "authors": ["Ben Quinn"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90b6f7e976d4f6275047584af31288451549c78e/227_468_3694_2216/master/3694.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3baad6d630d97ebf81c68c331c105884", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
