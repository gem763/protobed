REUTERS/Brian Snyder/File Photo\n\nThe Fed reduced its target overnight policy rate by a quarter of a percentage point on Wednesday, to a level of between 1.75% and 2.0%, to offset slowing global growth and risks associated in part with President Donald Trump\u2019s trade battles with China.\n\nIt was the second Fed rate reduction this year.\n\nBut Bullard wanted a bigger cut, and cited continued weak inflation and issues in the bond market along with the potential for an economic slowdown.\n\nA larger rate reduction \u201cwould provide insurance against further declines in expected inflation and a slowing economy subject to elevated downside risks,\u201d Bullard said in a written statement released on Friday morning.\n\n\u201cIt is prudent risk management, in my view, to cut the policy rate aggressively now and then later increase it should the downside risks not materialize.\u201d\n\nThe dissent this week was Bullard\u2019s second of the year, and the reasons behind it suggest growing concern on his part about the state of the U.S. economy.\n\nIn June, when his colleagues voted to keep rates unchanged, Bullard argued that they should begin cutting them on the grounds that inflation remained below the Fed\u2019s 2% target and that growth was expected to slow \u201cfor the remainder of the year.\u201d\n\nHis argument for more aggressive action was coupled with an expansion of the risks he said he perceived \u2014 from data pointing to a contraction in manufacturing to bond market pricing that has in some cases pushed short term yields above long term ones.\n\nRelated Coverage U.S. repo rate rises ahead of Fed repo operation\n\nIf sustained, that sort of yield curve \u201cinversion\u201d has been a precursor to recessions in the past.\n\n\u201cMany estimates of recession probabilities have risen from low to moderate levels,\u201d Bullard said.\n\n\u201cThe yield curve is inverted, and our policy rate remains above government bond yields\u201d in many other developed nations, a possible sign, in a world of global capital flows, that the U.S. is out of line with broader world financial conditions.", "description": "The U.S. manufacturing sector \"already appears in recession\" and overall economic growth is expected to slow \"in the near horizon,\" St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard said on Friday, explaining why he dissented at a recent Fed meeting and wanted a deeper, half percentage point rate cut.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1431947495&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J0S4", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
