The reports said the committee was rechecking the results before publishing them.\n\nWith both Netanyahu and Gantz almost certainly requiring support from smaller parties to form a government, minor differences in official results could significantly alter the outcome of the vote. A large turnout from Israel\u2019s Arab minority could also impact the result.\n\nNetanyahu has sought to extend his record-breaking time as prime minister by forging alliances with hardline religious politicians and appealing to far-right ultra-nationalists.\n\nIn a 3.30am speech to his party in Tel Aviv, the sullen-looking prime minister spoke on stage in a hoarse voice, after spending the day rallying his supporters with a megaphone.\n\nFor Palestinians, Israel\u2019s elections promise nothing but defeat | Raja Shehadeh Read more\n\n\u201cIn the next few days, we will begin negotiations to form a strong, Zionist government and in order to avert a dangerous, anti-Zionist government,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso speaking overnight, Gantz called for a unity government with members of Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party but not the leader himself. \u201cWe will act to form a broad unity government that will express the will of the people,\u201d he told supporters at a post-election rally in Tel Aviv. He however cautioned that he was waiting for final results.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

The president then tasks that person with forming a government, giving them up to six weeks to do so.\n\nThe exit polls suggested Gantz could be that person, especially if he can forge a deal with Israel\u2019s Arab parties.\n\nNetanyahu, who has demonised the country\u2019s significant Palestinian Arab minority as a fifth column throughout the election campaign, told his supporters that could never happen.\n\n\u201cThere neither will be nor can there be a government that relies on anti-Zionist Arab parties,\u201d he said. \u201cThat simply can\u2019t be. It\u2019s inconceivable.\u201d\n\nThe 69-year-old leader is fighting not only for his political life but also his freedom. Pre-trial hearings for three corruption cases against him are just weeks away and a majority in the 120-seat parliament could help grant him immunity from prosecution.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Benny Gantz, leader of the Blue and White opposition.

Lieberman, a staunch secularist, has seen his popularity spike and he could come out of the election as a kingmaker.\n\nAddressing his supporters late on Tuesday, Lieberman said on Tuesday night that he also wanted a broad, secular coalition with both Blue and White and Likud.\n\nPlay Video 0:38 Israel election: potential kingmaker Avigdor Lieberman calls for unity government \u2013 video\n\nAs in previous elections, Netanyahu has ramped up anti-Arab rhetoric to appeal to the far right. Last week, Facebook temporarily shut down a chatbot on his official page for breaching the company\u2019s hate speech policy after it warned of Arabs who \u201cwant to destroy us all\u201d.\n\nThis year, Arab parties ran under a single alliance in an attempt to raise their joint influence, a strategy that appeared to have worked. Turnout among Arabs was 61%, up from 49% during the April election.\n\nAyman Odeh, leader of the main Arab faction in parliament, said Netanyahu\u2019s attacks on the minority had had the opposite effect than intended of boosting their numbers. \u201cThere\u2019s a heavy price to pay for incitement,\u201d he said.", "description": "Rivals Benjamin Netanyahu and Benny Gantz both pledge to form coalition as counting continues", "authors": ["Oliver Holmes"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25ee200c138f6639c9d9de343377da8636054255/124_0_3170_1901/master/3170.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4d093382628102b8a3cb2dbf79a1a28a", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
