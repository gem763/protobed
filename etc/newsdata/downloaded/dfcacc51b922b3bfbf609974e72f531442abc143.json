They also come as the two governments increasingly curb business dealings and restrict visas for the other country\u2019s scholars, officials and scientific researchers to limit political-influence operations and espionage.\n\nThe Trump administration took new steps in recent days to require Chinese diplomats to notify the State Department when they meet with local U.S. officials and institutions. Chinese officials have rejected the allegation that they limit the work of American diplomats and condemned the U.S. measures as a violation of Vienna Convention norms.\n\n\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBranstad on Monday defended the U.S. change as \u201cmodest\u201d compared with what he called a systematic Chinese effort to stymie U.S. public diplomacy. In one recent instance, an event at a university in southern China was abruptly canceled after administrators said students were \u201ctoo shy\u201d to meet U.S. officials, Branstad said. During a trip in western China, Branstad tried to visit a coffee shop to talk to locals but Chinese officials arrived first and warned people not to speak.\n\n\u201cThere are so many ways that our efforts to have exchanges end up getting blocked,\u201d Branstad said. \u201cThere have been hundreds, thousands of them over the period of decades.\u201d\n\nThe State Department does not require Chinese diplomats to seek permission \u2014 only give notice \u2014 before holding meetings on American soil.\n\nAD\n\nPublicly and privately, Trump administration officials argue that China is taking advantage of the liberal American system to spread influence and gain commercially while hobbling U.S. diplomats, businesspeople and journalists with onerous restrictions in China, and that the U.S. government should clamp down.\n\nAD\n\nChina has dismissed such suggestions.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs for reciprocity, the U.S. has a far greater number of diplomatic personnel in China than China has in the U.S.,\u201d the Chinese embassy in Washington said on Twitter last week. \u201cIn 2018 alone, American diplomats paid more than 160 visits to Chinese universities.\u201d\n\nForeign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Friday that China would take unspecified countermeasures.\n\nAD\n\nThe Chinese envoy to the United States, Cui Tiankai, also pushed back on Twitter, arguing that a previous U.S. ambassador was able to travel widely across China, while he had not managed to visit every U.S. state.\n\nBranstad called the Chinese tweets \u201coutrageous.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe uses Twitter, and yet Twitter, Facebook and YouTube are all restricted here in China,\u201d Branstad said, referring to his counterpart.\n\nLocal Chinese officials have blocked U.S. diplomats, including Branstad, from visiting cultural centers established by the State Department on Chinese campuses.\n\nAD\n\nBranstad said he was twice denied permission to visit Tibet before being given access last year. Some State Department officials in recent years have also been effectively denied permission to visit Xinjiang, the western region where international observers say Chinese authorities have detained hundreds of thousands of Uighur people, a Muslim minority, in camps.\n\nAD\n\nForeign journalists also regularly encounter surveillance and harassment while working in China and face hurdles when renewing their visas.\n\nIn the past 12 months, the Trump administration has signed into law and announced moves that would deny visas for Chinese officials accused of detaining Muslim Uighurs in Xinjiang, or those who limit American citizens\u2019 and officials\u2019 access to Tibet.\n\nThe Justice Department has also imposed rules requiring Chinese state media to register as foreign agents.\n\n\n\nAD\n\nChinese authorities, in response, will limit travel for individuals with links to U.S. intelligence or human rights groups, Reuters reported.\n\nFor years, China has held public-education campaigns warning citizens about a proliferation of foreign spies working in China.\n\nAD", "description": "The two governments are increasingly curbing business dealings and restricting visas for scholars, officials and scientific researchers.", "authors": ["Gerry Shih", "China Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ti6VKdtchN-CRNNj5vJx-28tqVo=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KL3NIOHT4MI6TLMLQXRKUAFVZY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
