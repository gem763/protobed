So the answer is yes, but only if the policy is right.\n\n\u201cOur concern, our deep, deep concern, is that he wants to revisit and reheat Mrs May\u2019s deal, the new European Treaty, and that just would not be Brexit, in fact that that would be a surrender act.\u201d\n\nMr Farage said he could personally help the Tories in Brexit-voting areas that traditionally back Labour, where voters are reluctant to back the Conservatives.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

So here is a way for Boris to get a big, workable majority and we can help with that, we are happy to help with that.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s got to be the right policy.\u201d\n\nThe prime minister is facing pressure on a number of fronts as Tory activists descend on Manchester for the party\u2019s annual conference.\n\nHe refused to say whether he had apologised to the Queen for dragging her into the row over the prorogation, after the Supreme Court ruled the move was unlawful.\n\nMr Johnson also denied any conflict of interest over the award of grants and access to his friend Jennifer Arcuri while he was mayor of London, as allegations of an affair threatened to overshadow the party\u2019s gathering in Manchester.", "description": "Boris Johnson has ruled out a forming an electoral\u00a0pact with the Brexit Party after Nigel Farage claimed it could deliver the Tories a 100-seat majority.
