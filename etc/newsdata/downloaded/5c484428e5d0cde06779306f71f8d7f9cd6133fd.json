Alonso was held to one single in five at-bats, but Nationals manager Dave Martinez and starting pitcher Joe Ross couldn\u2019t miss the visiting team\u2019s fans.\n\n\u201cWe hear them; we notice,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cWe still have to play. It\u2019s our stadium.\u201d\n\nRoss, who lasted just 32/3 innings, said he doesn\u2019t let the fans bother him.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it matters; they usually travel well,\u201d Ross said. \u201cYou really can\u2019t let the crowd affect you.\u201d\n\nThe usually productive Nationals hitters were blanked for seven innings against Mets starter and winner Noah Syndergaard. The big right-hander struck out 10 and did not walk anyone while allowing just three hits.\n\nNationals right fielder Adam Eaton (.288) made his first start since Wednesday but had to leave after just two innings. Eaton was hit by a pitch in the back of the knee last week against the Orioles and Martinez admitted he is concerned for Eaton, who was slated to get an MRI exam.\n\nEaton lined out in his only trip to the plate before Gerardo Parra (.224) took over in right field in the top of the third.\n\n\u201cIt got tighter and tighter,\u201d Martinez said of Eaton\u2019s hamstrings. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to take any chances.\u201d\n\nAnother problem could be Ross, who was hit on the shin by a batted ball Aug. 19 in Pittsburgh and was taken out in the fourth inning that night.\n\nHe pitched 41/3 innings in his next start, on Aug. 24, at Chicago.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little sore but it is not really an excuse,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter allowing three runs in his last five outings, he was torched for eight hits and seven runs Monday against the Mets.\n\n\u201cI really wasn\u2019t executing today. Obviously, they made me pay,\u201d Ross said.\n\nRendon, who has 32 homers, had a huge weekend against the Marlins. He was held to one double in three trips to the plate Monday.\n\nAfter Trea Turner singled in the first, the New York right-hander retired 16 batters in a row before pinch-hitter Andrew Stevenson dumped a single into left in the last of the sixth.\n\nThe Mets (70-67) had lost seven of their previous 10 games but Syndergaard, with a hard sinker in the high 90s, handled a Washington team that had scored at least seven runs 17 times since Aug. 1.\n\n\u201cThe other guy was really good,\u201d Martinez said of Syndergaard.\n\nNew York broke through for five runs in the top of the fourth off Ross (3-4).\n\nThe second of the three-game series is set for Tuesday at 7:05 p.m., and features a matchup between previous winners of the Cy Young Award in the National League. Washington\u2019s Max Scherzer (9-5, 2.46) who won the award in 2017, will face 2018 winner Jacob deGrom (8-8, 2.66) of the Mets.\n\nIt will be the third start for Scherzer since he came off the injured list.\n\n\u201cWe will see where he is at,\u201d Martinez said of Scherzer, who left the clubhouse quickly after Monday\u2019s game. \u201cHe had a good week. He said he feels good.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
