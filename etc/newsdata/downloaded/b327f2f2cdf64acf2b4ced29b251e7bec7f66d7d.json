Taylor \u2013 October 22, 2019\n\nMr. Chairman, I appreciate the opportunity to appear today to provide my\n\nperspective on the events that are the subject of the Committees\u2019 inquiry. My sole\n\npurpose is to provide the Committees with my views about the strategic\n\nimportance of Ukraine to the United States as well as additional information about\n\nthe incidents in question.\n\nI have dedicated my life to serving U.S. interests at home and abroad in both\n\nmilitary and civilian roles. My background and experience are nonpartisan and I\n\nhave been honored to serve under every administration, Republican and\n\nDemocratic, since 1985.\n\nFor 50 years, I have served the country, starting as a cadet at West Point, then as an\n\ninfantry officer for six years, including with the 101st Airborne Division in\n\nVietnam; then at the Department of Energy; then as a member of a Senate staff;\n\nthen at NATO; then with the State Department here and abroad in Afghanistan,\n\nIraq, Jerusalem, and Ukraine; and more recently, as Executive Vice President of\n\nthe nonpartisan United States Institute of Peace.\n\nWhile I have served in many places and in different capacities, I have a particular\n\ninterest in and respect for the importance of our country\u2019s relationship with\n\nUkraine. Our national security demands that this relationship remain strong.\n\nHowever, in August and September of this year, I became increasingly concerned\n\nthat our relationship with Ukraine was being fundamentally undermined by an\n\nirregular, informal channel of U.S. policy-making and by the withholding of vital\n\nsecurity assistance for domestic political reasons. I hope my remarks today will\n\nhelp the Committees understand why I believed that to be the case.\n\nAt the outset, I would like to convey several key points. First, Ukraine is a\n\nstrategic partner of the United States, important for the security of our country as\n\nwell as Europe. Second, Ukraine is, right at this moment\u2014while we sit in this\n\nroom\u2014and for the last five years, under armed attack from Russia. Third, the\n\nsecurity assistance we provide is crucial to Ukraine\u2019s defense against Russian\n\naggression, and, more importantly, sends a signal to Ukrainians\u2014and Russians\u2014\n\nthat we are Ukraine\u2019s reliable strategic partner. And finally, as the Committees are\n\nnow aware, I said on September 9 in a message to Ambassador Gordon Sondland\n\nthat withholding security assistance in exchange for help with a domestic political\n\ncampaign in the United States would be \u201ccrazy.\u201d I believed that then, and I still\n\nbelieve that.\n\nLet me now provide the Committees a chronology of the events that led to my\n\nconcern.\n\nOn May 28 of this year, I met with Secretary Mike Pompeo who asked me to\n\nreturn to Kyiv to lead our embassy in Ukraine. It was\u2014and is\u2014a critical time in\n\nU.S.-Ukraine relations: Volodymyr Zelenskyy had just been elected president and\n\nUkraine remained at war with Russia. As the summer approached, a new\n\nUkrainian government would be seated, parliamentary elections were imminent,\n\nand the Ukrainian political trajectory would be set for the next several years.\n\nI had served as Ambassador to Ukraine from 2006 to 2009, having been nominated\n\nby George W. Bush, and, in the intervening 10 years, I have stayed engaged with\n\nUkraine, visiting frequently since 2013 as a board member of a small Ukrainian\n\nnon-governmental organization supporting good governance and reform. Across\n\nthe responsibilities I have had in public service, Ukraine is special for me, and\n\nSecretary Pompeo\u2019s offer to return as Chief of Mission was compelling. I am\n\nconvinced of the profound importance of Ukraine to the security of the United\n\nStates and Europe for two related reasons:\n\nFirst, if Ukraine succeeds in breaking free of Russian influence, it is possible for\n\nEurope to be whole, free, democratic, and at peace. In contrast, if Russia\n\ndominates Ukraine, Russia will again become an empire, oppressing its people,\n\nand threatening its neighbors and the rest of the world.\n\nSecond, with the annexation of the Crimea in 2014 and the continued aggression in\n\nDonbas, Russia violated countless treaties, ignored all commitments, and\n\ndismissed all the principles that have kept the peace and contributed to prosperity\n\nin Europe since World War II. To restore Ukraine\u2019s independence, Russia must\n\nleave Ukraine. This has been and should continue to be a bipartisan U.S. foreign\n\npolicy goal.\n\nWhen I was serving outside of government during the Obama administration and\n\nafter the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2014, I joined two other former\n\nambassadors to Ukraine in urging Obama administration officials at the State\n\nDepartment, Defense Department, and other agencies to provide lethal defensive\n\nweapons to Ukraine in order to deter further Russian aggression. I also supported\n\nmuch stronger sanctions against Russia.\n\nAll to say, I cared about Ukraine\u2019s future and the important U.S. interests there.\n\nSo, when Secretary Pompeo asked me to go back to Kyiv, I wanted to say \u201cyes.\u201d\n\nBut it was not an easy decision. The former Ambassador, Masha Yovanovitch,\n\nhad been treated poorly, caught in a web of political machinations both in Kyiv and\n\nin Washington. I feared that those problems were still present. When I talked to\n\nher about accepting the offer, however, she urged me to go, both for policy reasons\n\nand for the morale of the embassy.\n\nBefore answering the Secretary, I consulted both my wife and a respected former\n\nsenior Republican official who has been a mentor to me. I will tell you that my\n\nwife, in no uncertain terms, strongly opposed the idea. The mentor counseled: if\n\nyour country asks you to do something, you do it\u2014if you can be effective.\n\nI could be effective only if the U.S. policy of strong support for Ukraine\u2014strong\n\ndiplomatic support along with robust security, economic, and technical\n\nassistance\u2014were to continue and if I had the backing of the Secretary of State to\n\nimplement that policy. I worried about what I had heard concerning the role of\n\nRudolph Giuliani, who had made several high-profile statements about Ukraine\n\nand U.S. policy toward the country. So during my meeting with Secretary Pompeo\n\non May 28, I made clear to him and the others present that if U.S. policy toward\n\nUkraine changed, he would not want me posted there and I could not stay. He\n\nassured me that the policy of strong support for Ukraine would continue and that\n\nhe would support me in defending that policy.\n\nWith that understanding, I agreed to go back to Kyiv. Because I was appointed by\n\nthe Secretary but not reconfirmed by the Senate, my official position was Charg\u00e9\n\nd\u2019Affaires ad interim.\n\nI returned to Kyiv on June 17, carrying the original copy of a letter President\n\nTrump signed the day after I met with the Secretary. In that letter, President\n\nTrump congratulated President Zelenskyy on his election victory and invited him\n\nto a meeting in the Oval Office. I also brought with me a framed copy of the\n\nSecretary\u2019s declaration that the United States would never recognize the illegal\n\nRussian annexation of Crimea.\n\nBut once I arrived in Kyiv, I discovered a weird combination of encouraging,\n\nconfusing, and ultimately alarming circumstances.\n\nFirst, the encouraging: President Zelenskyy was taking over Ukraine in a hurry.\n\nHe had appointed reformist ministers and supported long-stalled anti-corruption\n\nlegislation. He took quick executive action, including opening Ukraine\u2019s High\n\nAnti-Corruption Court, which was established under the previous presidential\n\nadministration but never allowed to operate. He called snap parliamentary\n\nelections\u2014his party was so new it had no representation in the Rada\u2014and later\n\nwon an overwhelming mandate, controlling 60 percent of the seats. With his new\n\nparliamentary majority, President Zelenskyy changed the Ukrainian constitution to\n\nremove absolute immunity from Rada deputies, which had been the source of raw\n\ncorruption for two decades. There was much excitement in Kyiv that this time\n\nthings could be different\u2014a new Ukraine might finally be breaking from its\n\ncorrupt, post-Soviet past.\n\nAnd yet, I found a confusing and unusual arrangement for making U.S. policy\n\ntowards Ukraine. There appeared to be two channels of U.S. policy-making and\n\nimplementation, one regular and one highly irregular. As the Chief of Mission, I\n\nhad authority over the regular, formal diplomatic processes, including the bulk of\n\nthe U.S. effort to support Ukraine against the Russian invasion and to help it defeat\n\ncorruption. This regular channel of U.S. policy-making has consistently had\n\nstrong, bipartisan support both in Congress and in all administrations since\n\nUkraine\u2019s independence from Russia in 1991.\n\nAt the same time, however, there was an irregular, informal channel of U.S.\n\npolicy-making with respect to Ukraine, one which included then-Special Envoy\n\nKurt Volker, Ambassador Sondland, Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, and as I\n\nsubsequently learned, Mr. Giuliani. I was clearly in the regular channel, but I was\n\nalso in the irregular one to the extent that Ambassadors Volker and Sondland\n\nincluded me in certain conversations. Although this irregular channel was well-\n\nconnected in Washington, it operated mostly outside of official State Department\n\nchannels. This irregular channel began when Ambassador Volker, Ambassador\n\nSondland, Secretary Perry, and Senator Ron-Johnson briefed President Trump on\n\nMay 23 upon their return from President Zelenskyy\u2019s inauguration. The delegation\n\nreturned to Washington enthusiastic about the new Ukrainian president and urged\n\nPresident Trump to meet with him early on to cement the U.S.-Ukraine\n\nrelationship. But from what I understood, President Trump did not share their\n\nenthusiasm for a meeting with Mr. Zelenskyy.\n\nWhen I first arrived in Kyiv, in June and July, the actions of both the regular and\n\nthe irregular channels of foreign policy served the same goal\u2014a strong U.S.-Ukraine partnership\u2014but it became clear to me by August that the channels had\n\ndiverged in their objectives. As this occurred, I became increasingly concerned.\n\nIn late June, one the goals of both channels was to facilitate a visit by President\n\nZelenskyy to the White House for a meeting with President Trump, which\n\nPresident Trump had promised in his congratulatory letter of May 29. The\n\nUkrainians were clearly eager for the meeting to happen. During a conference call\n\nwith Ambassador Volker, Acting Assistant Secretary of State for European and\n\nEurasian Affairs Phil Reeker, Secretary Perry, Ambassador Sondland, and\n\nCounselor of the U.S. Department of State Ulrich Brechbuhl on June 18, it was\n\nclear that a meeting between the two presidents was an agreed-upon goal.\n\nBut during my subsequent communications with Ambassadors Volker and\n\nSondland, they relayed to me that the President \u201cwanted to hear from Zelenskyy\u201d\n\nbefore scheduling the meeting in the Oval Office. It was not clear to me what this\n\nmeant.\n\nOn June 27, Ambassador Sondland told me during a phone conversation that\n\nPresident Zelenskyy needed to make clear to President Trump that he, President\n\nZelenskyy, was not standing, in the way of \u201cinvestigations.\u201d\n\nI sensed something odd when Ambassador Sondland told me on June 28 that he\n\ndid not wish to include most of the regular interagency participants in a call\n\nplanned with President Zelenskyy later that day. Ambassador Sondland,\n\nAmbassador Volker, Secretary Perry, and I were on this call, dialing in from\n\ndifferent locations. However, Ambassador Sondland said that he wanted to make\n\nsure no one was transcribing or monitoring as they added President Zelenskyy to\n\nthe call. Also, before President Zelenskyy joined the call, Ambassador Volker\n\nseparately told the U.S. participants that he, Ambassador Volker, planned to be\n\nexplicit with President Zelenskyy in a one-on-one meeting in Toronto on July 2\n\nabout what President Zelenskyy should do to get the White House meeting. Again,\n\nit was not clear to me on that call what this meant, but Ambassador Volker noted\n\nthat he would relay that President Trump wanted to see rule of law, transparency,\n\nbut also, specifically, cooperation on investigations to \u201cget to the bottom of\n\nthings.\u201d Once President Zelenskyy joined the call, the conversation was focused\n\non energy policy and the Stanytsia-Luhanska bridge. President Zelenskyy also\n\nsaid he looked forward to the White House visit President Trump had offered in his\n\nMay 29 letter.\n\nI reported on this call to Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent, who had\n\nresponsibility for Ukraine, and I wrote a memo for the record dated June 30 that\n\nsummarized our conversation with President Zelenskyy.\n\nBy mid-July it was becoming clear to me that the meeting President Zelenskyy\n\nwanted was conditioned on the investigations of Burisma and alleged Ukrainian\n\ninterference in the 2016 U.S. elections. It was also clear that this condition was\n\ndriven by the irregular policy channel I had come to understand was guided by Mr.\n\nGiuliani.\n\nOn July 10, Ukrainian officials Alexander Danyliuk, the Ukrainian national\n\nsecurity advisor, and Andriy Yermak, an assistant to President Zelenskyy, and\n\nSecretary Perry, then-National Security Advisor John Bolton, Ambassador Volker,\n\nand Ambassador Sondland met at the White House. I did not participate in the\n\nmeeting and did not receive a readout of it until speaking with the National\n\nSecurity Council\u2019s (NSC\u2019s) then-Senior Director for European and Russian\n\nAffairs, Fiona Hill, and the NSC\u2019s Director of European Affairs, Alex Vindman,\n\non July 19.\n\nOn July 10 in Kyiv, I met with President Zelenskyy\u2019s chief of staff, Andrei\n\nBohdan, and then-foreign policy advisor to the president and now Foreign Minister\n\nVadym Prystaiko, who told me that they had heard from Mr. Giuliani that the\n\nphone call between the two presidents was unlikely to happen and that they were\n\nalarmed and disappointed. I relayed their concerns to Counselor Brechbuhl.\n\nIn a regular NSC secure video-conference call on July 18, I heard a staff person\n\nfrom the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) say that there was a hold on\n\nsecurity assistance to Ukraine but could not say why. Toward the end of an\n\notherwise normal meeting, a voice on the call\u2014the person was off-screen\u2014said\n\nthat she was from OMB and that her boss had instructed her not to approve any\n\nadditional spending of security assistance for Ukraine until further notice. I and\n\nothers sat in astonishment\u2014the Ukrainians were fighting the Russians and counted\n\non not only the training and weapons, but also the assurance of U.S. support. All\n\nthat the OMB staff person said was that the directive had come from the President\n\nto the Chief of Staff to OMB. In an instant, I realized that one of the key pillars of\n\nour strong support for Ukraine was threatened. The irregular policy channel was\n\nrunning contrary to the goals of longstanding U.S. policy.\n\nThere followed a series of NSC-led interagency meetings, starting at the staff level\n\nand quickly reaching the level of Cabinet secretaries. At every meeting, the\n\nunanimous conclusion was that the security assistance should be resumed, the hold\n\nlifted. At one point, the Defense Department was asked to perform an analysis of\n\nthe effectiveness of the assistance. Within a day, the Defense Department came\n\nback with the determination that the assistance was effective and should be\n\nresumed. My understanding, was that the Secretaries of Defense and State, the CIA\n\nDirector, and the National Security Advisor sought a joint meeting with the\n\nPresident to convince him to release the hold, but such a meeting was hard to\n\nschedule and the hold lasted well into September.\n\nThe next day on the phone, Dr. Hill and Mr. Vindman tried to reassure me that\n\nthey were not aware of any official change in U.S. policy toward Ukraine, OMB\u2019s\n\nannouncement notwithstanding. They did confirm that the hold on security\n\nassistance for Ukraine came from Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and that the Chief\n\nof Staff maintained a skeptical view of Ukraine.\n\nIn the same July 19 phone call, they gave me an account of the July 10 meeting\n\nwith the Ukrainian officials at the White House. Specifically, they told me that\n\nAmbassador Sondland had connected \u201cinvestigations\u201d with an Oval Office meeting\n\nfor President Zelenskyy, which so irritated Ambassador Bolton that he abruptly\n\nended the meeting, telling Dr. Hill and Mr. Vindman that they should have nothing\n\nto do with domestic politics. He also directed Dr. Hill to \u201cbrief the lawyers.\u201d Dr.\n\nHill said that Ambassador Bolton referred to this as a \u201cdrug deal\u201d after the July 10\n\nmeeting. Ambassador Bolton opposed a call between President Zelenskyy and\n\nPresident Trump out of concern that it \u201cwould be a disaster.\u201d\n\nNeedless to say, the Ukrainians in the meetings were confused. Ambassador\n\nBolton, in the regular Ukraine policy decision-making channel, wanted to talk\n\nabout security, energy, and reform; Ambassador Sondland, a participant in the\n\nirregular channel, wanted to talk about the connection between a White House\n\nmeeting and Ukrainian investigations.\n\nAlso during our July 19 call, Dr. Hill informed me that Ambassador Volker had\n\nmet with Mr. Giuliani to discuss Ukraine. This caught me by surprise. The next\n\nday I asked Ambassador Volker about that meeting, but received no response. I\n\nbegan to sense that the two decision making channels\u2014the regular and irregular\u2014\n\nwere separate and at odds.\n\nLater on July 19 and in the early morning of July 20 (Kyiv time), I received text\n\nmessages on a three-way WhatsApp text conversation with Ambassadors Volker\n\nand Sondland, a record of which l understand has already been provided to the\n\nCommittees by Ambassador Volker. Ambassador Sondland said that a call\n\nbetween President Trump and President Zelenskyy would take place soon.\n\nAmbassador Volker said that what was \u201c[m]ost impt is for Zelensky to say that he\n\nwill help investigation\u2014and address any specific personnel issues\u2014if there are\n\nany.\u201d\n\nLater on July 20, I had a phone conversation with Ambassador Sondland while he\n\nwas on a train from Paris to London. Ambassador Sondland told me that he had\n\nrecommended to President Zelenskyy that he use the phrase, \u201cI will leave no stone\n\nunturned\u201d with regard to \u201cinvestigations\u201d when President Zelenskyy spoke with\n\nPresident Trump.\n\nAlso on July 20, I had a phone conversation with Mr. Danyliuk, during which he\n\nconveyed to me that President Zelenskyy did not want to be used as a pawn in a\n\nU.S. re-election campaign. The next day I texted both Ambassadors Volker and\n\nSondland about President Zelenskyy\u2019s concern.\n\nOn July 25, President Trump and President Zelenskyy had the long-awaited phone\n\nconversation. Strangely, even though I was Chief of Mission and was scheduled to\n\nmeet with President Zelenskyy along with Ambassador Volker the following day, I\n\nreceived no readout of the call from the White House. The Ukrainian government\n\nissued a short, cryptic summary.\n\nDuring a previously planned July 26 meeting, President Zelenskyy told\n\nAmbassador Volker and me that he was happy with the call but did not elaborate.\n\nPresident Zelenskyy then asked about the face-to-face meeting in the Oval Office\n\nas promised in the May 29 letter from President Trump.\n\nAfter our meeting with President Zelenskyy, Ambassador Volker and I traveled to\n\nthe front line in northern Donbas to receive a briefing from the commander of the\n\nforces on the line of contact. Arriving for the briefing in the military headquarters,\n\nthe commander thanked us for security assistance, but I was aware that this\n\nassistance was on hold, which made me uncomfortable.\n\nAmbassador Volker and I could see the armed and hostile Russian-led forces on\n\nthe other side of the damaged bridge across the line of contact. Over 13,000\n\nUkrainians had been killed in the war, one or two a week. More Ukrainians would\n\nundoubtedly die without the U.S. assistance.\n\nAlthough I spent the morning of July 26 with President Zelenskyy and other\n\nUkrainian officials, the first summary of the Trump-Zelenskyy call that I heard\n\nfrom anybody inside the U.S. government was during a phone call I had with Tim\n\nMorrison, Dr. Hill\u2019s recent replacement at the NSC, on July 28. Mr. Morrison told\n\nme that the call \u201ccould have been better\u201d and that President Trump had suggested\n\nthat President Zelenskyy or his staff meet with Mr. Giuliani and Attorney General\n\nWilliam Barr. I did not see any official readout of the call until it was publicly\n\nreleased on September 25.\n\nOn August 16, I exchanged text messages with Ambassador Volker in which I\n\nlearned that Mr. Yermak had asked that the United States submit an official request\n\nfor an investigation into Burisma\u2019s alleged violations of Ukrainian law, if that is\n\nwhat the United States desired. A formal U.S. request to the Ukrainians to conduct\n\nan investigation based on violations of their own law struck me as improper, and I\n\nrecommended to Ambassador Volker that we \u201cstay clear.\u201d To find out the legal\n\naspects of the question, however, I gave him the name of a Deputy Assistant\n\nAttorney General whom I thought would be the proper point of contact for seeking\n\na U.S. referral for a foreign investigation.\n\nBy mid-August, because the security assistance had been held for over a month for\n\nno reason that I could discern, I was beginning to fear that the longstanding U.S.\n\npolicy of strong support for Ukraine was shifting. I called Counselor Brechbuhl to\n\ndiscuss this on August 21. He said that he was not aware of a change of U.S.\n\npolicy but would check on the status of the security assistance. My concerns\n\ndeepened the next day, on August 22, during a phone conversation with Mr.\n\nMorrison. I asked him if there had been a change in policy of strong support for\n\nUkraine, to which he responded, \u201cit remains to be seen.\u201d He also told me during\n\nthis call that the \u201cPresident doesn\u2019t want to provide any assistance at all.\u201d That\n\nwas extremely troubling to me. As I had told Secretary Pompeo in May, if the\n\npolicy of strong support for Ukraine were to change, I would have to resign. Based\n\non my call with Mr. Morrison, I was preparing to do so.\n\nJust days later, on August 27, Ambassador Bolton arrived in Kyiv and met with\n\nPresident Zelenskyy. During their meeting, security assistance was not\n\ndiscussed\u2014amazingly, news of the hold did not leak out until August 29. I, on the\n\nother hand, was all too aware of and still troubled by the hold. Near the end of\n\nAmbassador Bolton\u2019s visit, I asked to meet him privately, during which I\n\nexpressed to him my serious concern about the withholding of military assistance\n\nto Ukraine while the Ukrainians were defending their country from Russian\n\naggression. Ambassador Bolton recommended that I send a first-person cable to\n\nSecretary Pompeo directly, relaying my concerns. I wrote and transmitted such a\n\ncable on August 29, describing the \u201cfolly\u201d I saw in withholding military aid to\n\nUkraine at a time when hostilities were still active in the east and when Russia was\n\nwatching closely to gauge the level of American support for the Ukrainian\n\ngovernment. I told the Secretary that I could not and would not defend such a\n\npolicy. Although I received no specific response, I heard that soon thereafter, the\n\nSecretary carried the cable with him to a meeting at the White House focused on\n\nsecurity assistance for Ukraine.\n\nThe same day that I sent my cable to the Secretary, August 29, Mr. Yermak\n\ncontacted me and was very concerned, asking about the withheld security\n\nassistance. The hold that the White House had placed on the assistance had just\n\nbeen made public that day in a Politico story. At that point, I was embarrassed that\n\nI could give him no explanation for why it was withheld.\n\nIt had still not occurred to me that the hold on security assistance could be related\n\nto the \u201cinvestigations.\u201d That, however, would soon change.\n\nOn September 1, just three days after my cable to Secretary Pompeo, President\n\nZelenskyy met Vice President Pence at a bilateral meeting in Warsaw. President\n\nTrump had planned to travel to Warsaw but at the last minute had cancelled\n\nbecause of Hurricane Dorian. Just hours before the Pence-Zelenskyy meeting, I\n\ncontacted Mr. Danyliuk to let him know that the delay of U.S. security assistance\n\nwas an \u201call or nothing\u201d proposition, in the sense that if the White House did not lift\n\nthe hold prior to the end of the fiscal year (September 30), the funds would expire\n\nand Ukraine would receive nothing. I was hopeful that at the bilateral meeting or\n\nshortly thereafter, the White House would lift the hold, but this was not to be.\n\nIndeed, I received a readout of the Pence-Zelenskyy meeting over the phone from\n\nMr. Morrison, during which he told me President Zelenskyy had opened the\n\nmeeting by asking the Vice President about security cooperation. The Vice\n\nPresident did not respond substantively, but said that he would talk to President\n\nTrump that night. The Vice President did say that President Trump wanted the\n\nEuropeans to do more to support Ukraine and that he wanted the Ukrainians to do\n\nmore to fight corruption.\n\nDuring this same phone call I had with Mr. Morrison, he went on to describe a\n\nconversation Ambassador Sondland had with Mr. Yermak at Warsaw.\n\nAmbassador Sondland told Mr. Yermak that the security assistance money would\n\nnot come until President Zelenskyy committed to pursue the Burisma investigation.\n\nI was alarmed by what Mr. Morrison told me about the Sondland-Yermak conversation.\n\nThis was the first time I had heard that the security assistance\u2014not\n\njust the White House meeting\u2014was conditioned on the investigations.\n\nVery concerned, on that same day I sent Ambassador Sondland a text message\n\nasking if \u201cwe [are] now saying that security assistance and [a] WH meeting are\n\nconditioned on investigations?\u201d Ambassador Sondland responded asking me to\n\ncall him, which I did. During that phone call, Ambassador Sondland told me that\n\nPresident Trump had told him that he wants President Zelenskyy to state publicly\n\nthat Ukraine will investigate Burisma and alleged Ukrainian interference in the\n\n2016 U.S. election.\n\nAmbassador Sondland also told me that he now recognized that he had made a\n\nmistake by earlier telling the Ukrainian officials to whom he spoke that a White\n\nHouse meeting with President Zelenskyy was dependent on a public announcement\n\nof investigations\u2014in fact, Ambassador Sondland said, \u201ceverything\u201d was dependent\n\non such an announcement, including security assistance. He said that President\n\nTrump wanted President Zelenskyy \u201cin a public box\u201d by making a public statement\n\nabout ordering such investigations.\n\nIn the same September 1 call, I told Ambassador Sondland that President Trump\n\nshould have more respect for another head of state and that what he described was\n\nnot in the interest of either President Trump or President Zelenskyy. At that point I\n\nasked Ambassador Sondland to push back on President Trump\u2019s demand.\n\nAmbassador Sondland pledged to try. We also discussed the possibility that the\n\nUkrainian Prosecutor General, rather than President Zelenskyy, would make a\n\nstatement about investigations, potentially in coordination with Attorney General\n\nBarr\u2019s probe into the investigation of interference in the 2016 elections.\n\nThe next day, September 2, Mr. Morrison called to inform me that Mr. Danyliuk\n\nhad asked him to come to his hotel room in Warsaw, where Mr. Danyliuk\n\nexpressed concern about the possible loss of U.S. support for Ukraine. In\n\nparticular, Mr. Morrison relayed to me that the inability of any U.S. officials to\n\nrespond to the Ukrainians\u2019 explicit questions about security assistance was\n\ntroubling them. I was experiencing the same tension in my dealings with the\n\nUkrainians, including during a meeting, I had had with Ukrainian Defense Minister\n\nAndriy Zagordnyuk that day.\n\nDuring my call with Mr. Morrison on September 2, I also briefed Mr. Morrison on\n\nwhat Ambassador Sondland had told me during, our call the day prior.\n\nOn September 5, I hosted Senators Johnson and Murphy for a visit to Kyiv.\n\nDuring their visit, we met with President Zelenskyy. His first question to the\n\nsenators was about the withheld security assistance. My recollection of the\n\nmeeting is that both senators stressed that bipartisan support for Ukraine in\n\nWashington was Ukraine\u2019s most important strategic asset and that President\n\nZelenskyy should not jeopardize that bipartisan support by getting drawn into U.S.\n\ndomestic politics.\n\nI had been making (and continue to make) this point to all of my Ukrainian official\n\ncontacts. But the push to make President Zelenskyy publicly commit to\n\ninvestigations of Burisma and alleged interference in the 2016 election showed\n\nhow the official foreign policy of the United States was undercut by the irregular\n\nefforts led by Mr. Giuliani.\n\nTwo days later, on September 7, I had a conversation with Mr. Morrison in which\n\nhe described a phone conversation earlier that day between Ambassador Sondland\n\nand President Trump. Mr. Morrison said that he had a \u201csinking feeling\u201d after\n\nlearning about this conversation from Ambassador Sondland. According to Mr.\n\nMorrison, President Trump told Ambassador Sondland that he was not asking for a\n\n\u201cquid pro quo.\u201d But President Trump did insist that President Zelenskyy go to a\n\nmicrophone and say he is opening investigations of Biden and 2016 election\n\ninterference, and that President Zelenskyy should want to do this himself. Mr.\n\nMorrison said that he told Ambassador Bolton and the NSC lawyers of this phone\n\ncall between President Trump and Ambassador Sondland.\n\nThe following day, on September 8, Ambassador Sondland and I spoke on the\n\nphone. He said he had talked to President Trump as I had suggested a week\n\nearlier, but that President Trump was adamant that President Zelenskyy, himself,\n\nhad to \u201cclear things up and do it in public.\u201d President Trump said it was not a\n\n\u201cquid pro quo.\u201d Ambassador Sondland said that he had talked to President\n\nZelenskyy and Mr. Yermak and told them that, although this was not a quid pro\n\nquo, if President Zelenskyy did not \u201cclear things up\u201d in public, we would be at a\n\n\u201cstalemate.\u201d I understood a \u201cstalemate\u201d to mean that Ukraine would not receive\n\nthe much-needed military assistance. Ambassador Sondland said that this\n\nconversation concluded with President Zelenskyy agreeing to make a public\n\nstatement in an interview with CNN.\n\nAfter the call with Ambassador Sondland on September 8, I expressed my strong\n\nreservations in a text message to Ambassador Sondland, stating that my\n\n\u201cnightmare is they [the Ukrainians] give the interview and don\u2019t get the security\n\nassistance. The Russians love it. (And I quit.).\u201d I was serious.\n\nThe next day, I said to Ambassadors Sondland and Volker that \u201c[t]he message to\n\nthe Ukrainians (and Russians) we send with the decision on security assistance is\n\nkey. With the hold, we have already shaken their faith in us.\u201d I also said, \u201cI think\n\nit\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d\n\nAmbassador Sondland responded about five hours later that I was \u201cincorrect about\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s intentions. The President has been crystal clear no quid pro\n\nquo\u2019s of any kind.\u201d\n\nBefore these text messages, during our call on September 8, Ambassador Sondland\n\ntried to explain to me that President Trump is a businessman. When a businessman\n\nis about to sign a check to someone who owes him something, he said, the\n\nbusinessman asks that person to pay up before signing the check. Ambassador\n\nVolker used the same terms several days later while we were together at the Yalta\n\nEuropean Strategy Conference. I argued to both that the explanation made no\n\nsense: the Ukrainians did not \u201cowe\u201d President Trump anything, and holding up\n\nsecurity assistance for domestic political gain was \u201ccrazy,\u201d as I had said in my text\n\nmessage to Ambassadors Sondland and Volker on September 9.\n\nFinally, I learned on September 11 that the hold had been lifted and that the\n\nsecurity assistance would be provided.\n\nAfter I learned that the security assistance was released on September 11, I\n\npersonally conveyed the news to President Zelenskyy and Foreign Minister\n\nPrystaiko. And I again reminded Mr. Yermak of the high strategic value of\n\nbipartisan support for Ukraine and the importance of not getting involved in other\n\ncountries\u2019 elections. My fear at the time was that since Ambassador Sondland had\n\ntold me President Zelenskyy already agreed to do a CNN interview, President\n\nZelenskyy would make a statement regarding \u201cinvestigations\u201d that would have\n\nplayed into domestic U.S. politics. I sought to confirm through Mr. Danyliuk that\n\nPresident Zelenskyy was not planning to give such an interview to the media.\n\nWhile Mr. Danyliuk initially confirmed that on September 12, I noticed during a\n\nmeeting on the morning of September 13 at President Zelenskyy\u2019s office that Mr.\n\nYermak looked uncomfortable in response to the question. Again, I asked Mr.\n\nDanyliuk to confirm that there would be no CNN interview, which he did.\n\nOn September 25 at the UN General Assembly session in New York City,\n\nPresident Trump met President Zelenskyy face-to-face. He also released the\n\ntranscript of the July 25 call. The United States gave the Ukrainians virtually no\n\nnotice of the release, and they were livid. Although this was the first time I had\n\nseen the details of President Trump\u2019s July 25 call with President Zelenskyy, in\n\nwhich he mentioned Vice President Biden, I had come to understand well before\n\nthen that \u201cinvestigations\u201d was a term that Ambassadors Volker and Sondland used\n\nto mean matters related to the 2016 elections, and to investigations of Burisma and\n\nthe Bidens.\n\n*\n\nI recognize that this is a rather lengthy recitation of the events of the past few\n\nmonths told from my vantage point in Kyiv. But I also recognize the importance\n\nof the matters your Committees are investigating, and I hope that this chronology\n\nwill provide some framework for your questions.\n\nI wish to conclude by returning to the points I made at the outset. Ukraine is\n\nimportant to the security of the United States. It has been attacked by Russia,\n\nwhich continues its aggression against Ukraine. If we believe in the principle of\n\nsovereignty of nations on which our security and the security of our friends and\n\nallies depends, we must support Ukraine in its fight against its bullying neighbor.\n\nRussian aggression cannot stand.\n\nThere are two Ukraine stories today. The first is the one we are discussing this\n\nmorning and that you have been hearing for the past two weeks. It is a rancorous\n\nstory about whistleblowers, Mr. Giuliani, side channels, quid pro quos, corruption,\n\nand interference in elections. In this story Ukraine is an object.\n\nBut there is another Ukraine story\u2014a positive, bipartisan one. In this second story,\n\nUkraine is the subject. This one is about young people in a young nation,\n\nstruggling to break free of its past, hopeful that their new government will finally\n\nusher in a new Ukraine, proud of its independence from Russia, eager to join\n\nWestern institutions and enjoy a more secure and prosperous life. This story\n\ndescribes a nation developing an inclusive, democratic nationalism, not unlike\n\nwhat we in America, in our best moments, feel about our diverse country\u2014less\n\nconcerned about what language we speak, what religion if any we practice, where\n\nour parents and grandparents came from; more concerned about building a new\n\ncountry.\n\nBecause of the strategic importance of Ukraine in our effort to create a whole, free\n\nEurope, we, through Republican and Democratic administrations over three\n\ndecades, have supported Ukraine. Congress has been generous over the years with\n\nassistance funding, both civilian and military, and political support. With\n\noverwhelming bipartisan majorities, Congress has supported Ukraine with harsh\n\nsanctions on Russia for invading and occupying Ukraine. We can be proud of that\n\nsupport and that we have stood up to a dictator\u2019s aggression against a democratic\n\nneighbor.\n\nIt is this second story that I would like to leave you with today.\n\nAnd I am glad to answer your questions.", "description": "Read William Taylor's opening statement, which was obtained by TIME, on Ukraine and Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Time Staff"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/gettyimages-1177544554.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
