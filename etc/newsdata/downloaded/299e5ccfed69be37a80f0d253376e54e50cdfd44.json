It is disturbing that U.S. taxpayer dollars are being used to fund an exhibition that glorifies an individual who hated the United States, our commitment to democratic principles, and the values of individual freedom that we so deeply cherish,\u201d said Sens. Marco Rubio and Rick Scott in a letter to National Endowment for the Arts Chairwoman Mary Anne Carter this week, citing a passage in Exposing the Real Ch\u00e9 Guevara by Humberto Fontova.\n\n\u201cThey also note that Guevara was known to have been opposed to gay rights and even forced gay people into labor camps,\u201d The Washington Examiner states, quoting from the senators\u2019 letter.\n\nIn brief: seems that the NEA issued a grant to San Antonio\u2019s McNay Art Museum for an exhibit titled \"Pop Am\u00e9rica 1965-1975,\" which included a version of the famous Che Guevara propaganda pic we\u2019re so familiar with from T-shirts, posters, etc.\n\nGiven that the featured Che pic (though snapped by a KGB stringer named Alberto Gutierrez and originally publicized by a worldwide KGB campaign) is widely cited as among the most reproduced portraits in the world, it obviously belonged in an art exhibit so titled. No argument there, even by Senators Rubio and Scott.\n\nThe essential issue wasn\u2019t the American taxpayer subsidizing a (morally neutral, though KGB-created) pic of a mass-murdering Stalinist terrorist who raved that:\n\n\u201cThe U.S. is the great enemy of mankind!\u201d (Che Guevara, 1961.)\n\n\u201cAgainst those hyenas there is no option but extermination!\u201d (Che Guevara, 1961.)\n\n\u201cWe must keep our hatred (against the U.S.) alive and fan it to paroxysm!\u201d (Che Guevara, 1965.)\n\n\u201cIf the nuclear missiles had remained (in Cuba) we would have fired them against the heart of the U.S. including New York City. The victory of socialism is well worth millions of Atomic victims.\u201d (Che Guevara, 1962.)\n\nNever mind the above indiscretions. Taxpayer subsidies for the author of such ravings probably falls within the boundaries of constitutionally protected \u201cfreedom of expression.\u201d But here\u2019s the kicker: When the art exhibition moved to Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University it was described as demonstrating \u201c'bold contributions' to 'social protest, justice movements and debates about freedom.\u201d\n\n\u201cJustice and freedom\u201d captioning Che Guevara\u2019s pic? Here\u2019s where GOP Senators Rubio and Scott sought clarifications and offered some of their own:\n\n\u201cA contextualization of the works in question would have provided an important opportunity for education and reflection,\u201d continues the letter, \u201cand yet a factual history of Ch\u00e9 Guevara\u2019s bloody legacy [is] not included in the program.\u2026Lastly, we urge you to ensure that individuals responsible for war crimes or crimes against humanity are not featured in any NEA funded exhibits without clearly and unambiguously highlighting their heinous crimes and memorializing their victims.\u201d\n\nIn brief, if the U.S. taxpayer is forced to advertise a cowardly, mass-murdering warmonger who regarded them as \u201chyenas fit only for extermination!\u201d Who regarded their country as \u201cthe great enemy of mankind!\u201d and whose lifelong craving was to incinerate them in a nuclear holocaust\u2014if the U.S. taxpayer is forced to fund an ad for this fellow, well let\u2019s at least have a little truth in advertisement. Kinda like what those TV commercials for drugs have at the end.\n\nBut you called him \u201ccowardly,\u201d Humberto, some amigos note. Why? I mean, sure he was a mass-murderer and all. But wasn\u2019t he also a brave and proficient guerrilla? After all, that\u2019s what we saw in Steven Soderbergh\u2019s and Del Toro\u2019s movie about him?\n\nHAH! Glad you asked, and especially near this, the 52nd anniversary of his whacking (Oct. 9, 1967.)\n\nIn fact, on his second to last day alive and under hot pursuit by Green Beret-trained Bolivian soldiers, Che Guevara ordered his guerrilla charges to give no quarter, to fight to the last breath and to the last bullet. \u201cChe drummed it into us,\u201d recalls Cuban guerrilla Dariel Alarcon, who indeed fought to his last bullet in Bolivia, escaped back to Cuba, defected, and today lives in Paris. \u201cNever surrender,\u201d Che always stressed. \u201cNever, never!\u201d He drilled it into us almost every day of the guerrilla campaign. \u201cA Cuban revolutionary cannot surrender!\u201d Che thundered. \u201cSave your last bullet for yourself!\u201d\n\nWith his men doing exactly that, Che snuck away from the firefight, crawled towards the Bolivian soldiers doing the firing\u2014then as soon as he spotted two of them at a distance, stood and yelled: \"Don't Shoot! I'm Che! I'm worth more to you alive than dead!\"\n\nLearning of Che\u2019s whimpering capture with fully loaded weapons after his sissified escape from the firefight started Alarcon\u2019s long road to total disillusionment with Castroism.\n\nHis captor\u2019s official Bolivian army records that they took from Ernesto \u201cChe\u201d Guevara: a fully-loaded PPK 9mm pistol. But it was only after his (obviously voluntary) capture that Che segued into full Eddie-Haskell-Greeting-June-Cleaver-Mode. \"What's your name, young man?!\" Che quickly asked one of his captors. \"Why what a lovely name for a Bolivian soldier!\"\n\n\u201cSo what will they do with me?\" Che, obviously desperate to ingratiate himself, also asked Bolivian Captain Gary Prado. \"I don't suppose you will kill me. I'm surely more valuable alive....And you Captain Prado!\" Che commended his captor. \"You are a very special person! ...I have been talking to some of your men. They think very highly of you, captain!..Now, could you please find out what they plan to do with me?\"\n\nFrom that stage on, Che Guevara\u2019s fully-documented Eddie Haskell-isms only get more uproarious (or nauseating.)\n\nOn the other hand, Stephen Soderbergh\u2019s movie \u201cChe\u201d shows Guevara steely-eyed and snarling with defiance during his capture. Why, according to Soderbergh, only seconds before his capture, Che\u2019s very M-2 carbine had been blasted from his hands and rendered useless by a CIA-Fascist machine gun burst!\n\nThen the bravely grimacing Guevara jerks out his pistol and blasts his very last bullets at the approaching hordes of CIA-Fascist soldiers!\n\nFine, but just where did Soderbergh and Benicio Del Toro (who starred as Che and co-produced the movie) obtain this version of Che\u2019s capture? Well, the notoriously skeptical towards U.S. businessmen (see Erin Brockovich) director Steven Soderbergh transcribed this sterling account of Che\u2019s capture exactly as penned by Fidel Castro, who apparently cannot tell a lie according to Hollywood, and whose regime essentially co-produced Soderbergh\u2019s movie.", "description": "\"Che Guevara was a sadistic butcher who murdered and tortured .10/05/2019 0:45:09AM EST.", "authors": ["Humberto Fontova", "Beth Baumann", "Katie Pavlich"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2017/311/d51fa5c8-6dac-4645-be60-e551f19c63db.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
