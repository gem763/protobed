Meanwhile Kendall had long been starring beside her big sisters on Keeping Up With the Kardashians.\n\n'I met her for the first time seven years ago over Twitter,' Bella told InStyle.

She's a pretty significant human I met online.'\n\nLongtime pals: Kendall and Bella are seen back in May at the Met Gala\n\nAs for their kiss, it comes after Kendall last year publicly commented on rumors that she is gay, saying she simply prefers to keep her romances out of the spotlight.\n\nShe explained to Vogue last year: 'I think it's because I'm not like all my other sisters, who are like, \"Here's me and my boyfriend!\" So it was a thing for a minute because no one ever saw me with a guy. I would always go that extra mile to be low-key with guys, sneaking around all the time.'\n\nand she continued: 'I don't think I have a bisexual or gay bone in my body, but I don't know! Who knows? I'm all down for experience \u2014 not against it whatsoever \u2014 but I've never been there before.'\n\nOut and about: Kendall was pictured on Monday leaving a meeting in Los Angeles", "description": "They are old friends who have known each other since their teenage years.", "authors": ["Dailymail.Com Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/16/19547574-0-image-a-15_1570722555075.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
