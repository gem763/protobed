She was so impressed with my service that she requested I attend to her and her husband when they returned for supper the next day,\" the 26-year-old told YOU.\n\nMurphy fostered a relationship with the pair over several days through regular conversation and commendable suggestions from the menu.\n\n\"Over the course of three days they had continued to tip me, but on their last night at the hotel, I could not believe the R5000 gratuity they had given to me.\"\n\nMurphy says he was overwhelmed with emotion: \"I just couldn't believe it. I asked them if they were sure about the amount, to which they reassured me, it was indeed correct.\"\n\n\"I was tearful and ever so grateful; I just couldn't believe it even after it happened.\"\n\nMurphy Masenga shared his R5000 tip with colleagues (Supplied)\n\nMurphy said that the service he delivered was nothing without his co-workers as they worked tirelessly behind the scenes to ensure a wholesome experience.\n\n\"There is just so much power in working together as a team,\" he says. \"From the moment the couple checked-in at reception, to the room service and even the chef that prepared the food, it was all a team effort.\"\n\nThat was why he chose to share the money with his colleagues.\n\n\"I love the work that I do and working for Onomo allows me to meet people from all walks of life.\"\n\nMurphy, who has worked at the hotel for just over a year, says he's forever indebted to the hotel's general manager Ursala Costa.\n\n\"I am forever grateful, not only to her, but my colleagues and the guests who have given me one of the most memorable moments within this industry.\"", "description": "When he recently received a generous tip of R5000, Murphy Masenga extended that generosity by sharing it amongst his fellow workmates.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9466/c17e80f8dc6f443f91c4169952ab79a4.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
