But they are all in the initial stage of development with a limited capability to generate substantial revenues,\u201d he said.Coway pulled off record-high earnings in the second quarter with 138.2 billion won in operating profit.Netmarble\u2019s recent acquisitions will push it beyond the gaming and internet industries.Last year it bought a 26 percent stake in Big Hit Entertainment, which manages the Korean boy band BTS for about $170 million.Woongjin Group is selling off its controlling stake in Woongjin Coway to improve its own liquidity.The group announced in June that it would sell its 25.08 percent stake in the rental service unit three months after it bought back Coway, which was founded as a Woongjin unit in 1989.In 2013, the group sold Coway to a private equity fund when it faced a financial crunch.Still, some analysts expressed skepticism over the prospects for the unconventional corporate marriage between a gaming and appliance rental company.\u201cThe deal would give a stable cash flow to Netmarble,\u201d said Ahn Jae-min, an analyst at NH Investment & Securities. \u201cStill, it is hard to expect synergies between games and the rental business.\u201dThe analyst went on to note that the companies\u2019 main client bases also differ.\u201cThe game business is oriented toward individuals rather than households, and major users are males in their 20s through 40s, which is different from the target users of a rental business,\u201d Seo said.\u201cThis causes uncertainties regarding the outlook for the acquisition,\u201d he said.BY PARK EUN-JEE [park.eunjee@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
