And while she appeared briefly in both of the previous two episodes, it hasn\u2019t really been clear what she\u2019s actually doing.\n\n\u201cFeel-Good Story\u201d offers an answer. Following a rough season that included two separate ill-advised hookups with her ex-husband, Mr. Peanutbutter, Diane has taken a break from Los Angeles. Right now, she\u2019s traveling the country to shoot videos for GirlCroosh with her cameraman, Guy (Lakeith Stanfield), a bison who has become Diane\u2019s hookup buddy.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t real life, it\u2019s summer camp. Temporary. Easy,\u201d says BoJack in one of several letters he writes to Diane over the course of the episode. He\u2019s talking about rehab, but it applies just as neatly to the status of Diane and Guy\u2019s relationship, which consists of having sex, ordering takeout, and generally goofing around in a series of anonymous hotel rooms. There are reminders that both Diane and Guy have actual, complicated lives \u2014 in one early scene, Guy fields a phone call from his estranged son \u2014 but for now, they\u2019re just enjoying something that feels good for as long as it lasts.\n\nMost of \u201cFeel-Good Story\u201d is set in Guy\u2019s hometown of Chicago. It\u2019s a city that comes with some benefits, like Guy\u2019s favorite sandwich place, as well as some drawbacks \u2014 like the sudden, surprise presence of Guy\u2019s son at his apartment, which forces Diane to flee out of a window before he meets her and starts asking questions neither she nor Guy can answer.\n\nAs Diane and Guy struggle to figure out whether they actually have potential as a couple, a work problem provides a welcome distraction. Stefani calls with new marching orders: Diane\u2019s videos are too depressing and GirlCroosh wants her to shift toward feel-good content. But when Diane interviews a couple of women who have started a line of toys with realistically proportioned bodies \u2014 and learns, to her horror, that the company has been acquired by an evil conglomerate called WhiteWhale \u2014 her \u201cfeel-good\u201d video turns out pretty depressing anyway.\n\nMany of BoJack Horseman\u2019s bleakest bits of social commentary have come through the eyes of Diane, a principled activist who has either compromised or been crushed when actually confronted by the celebrities and corporations who wield so much more power than she\u2019ll ever have. \u201cFeel-Good Story\u201d is no different. When WhiteWhale learns about Diane\u2019s video, they buy GirlCroosh outright and fold it into a massive, incoherent-sounding new media venture, which enables them to control the framing and the flow of any critical stories about the company. (They call it Spronk, a reference that will not be lost on anyone who follows the real-life media landscape.)\n\nWhen Diane and Guy resolve to rebel by making a video accusing the CEO of murdering Matt Minnowman, a warehouse worker who died after fighting for workers\u2019 rights, the CEO himself actually encourages the project. His analysis shows that any story alleging that WhiteWhale is evil actually raises the company\u2019s stock value, because investors prefer companies that pursue profits at the expense of morality. Even after Diane accuses him of murdering Matt Minnowman, he happily admits it, revealing that the House of Representatives has passed a law, presumably under heavy lobbying, that allows billionaires to commit murder. \u201cIf you want to do something about it, just make a billion dollars and murder me,\u201d he laughs.\n\nSo yes, it\u2019s another quixotic battle and another crushing defeat. But as Diane attempts to deal with her rage at her inability to solve any of society\u2019s problems, Guy is casting a smaller net. Throughout the episode, he repeatedly gives Diane his winter jacket whenever she gets cold \u2014 a problem she could solve if she\u2019d just get her own jacket. When Guy finally buys her a jacket of her own, Diane picks a fight about it \u2014 an echo of the same problem she had with Mr. Peanutbutter, whose attempts at romantic gestures tended to backfire.\n\nSo why won\u2019t she just take the jacket? There\u2019s clearly the fear of the commitment it represents, since buying a coat designed for Chicago winters implies that she\u2019ll be spending an extended length of time in Chicago with Guy. But Guy also sees something metaphorical in what he calls her \u201cideological objection to feeling good\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s a stubborn insistence on going it alone, and inflicting needless pain on herself as a way of channeling the pain she feels about the state of the world.\n\nDiane returns to Los Angeles, and Guy stays in Chicago, and it seems like BoJack Horseman is all geared up for another sad ending about how people deliberately reject their own happiness. And then Diane finds another letter from BoJack, which includes one of his own epiphanies from rehab: \u201cI wasted so many years being miserable because I assumed it was the only way to be.\u201d\n\nSo Diane calls Guy and tells him a story about when she first moved to Los Angeles, she got so much joy from a simple, private quest to cook the perfect grilled-cheese sandwich. She says it\u2019s been a while since she\u2019s cooked one \u2014 and she says she can do it anywhere. Even, presumably, Chicago. It\u2019s as tender and hopeful an ending as BoJack Horseman is likely to give you: You may not be able to remake the world, but you can at least make sure you\u2019re not going through it alone.\n\nHorsin\u2019 Around\n\n\u2022 The song that plays over the end credits is Fialta\u2019s \u201cHigh Over Chicago,\u201d from their 2013 album, Summer Winter.\n\n\u2022 She\u2019s barely in the episode, but I\u2019m a big fan of Isabelle, the journalist locked into a lifelong quest to take down WhiteWhale \u2014 but who firmly refuses to acknowledge any similarities to Herman Melville\u2019s Moby-Dick.\n\n\u2022 WhiteWhale\u2019s rapid-fire portfolio of corporate acquisitions includes Skynet, the technology that leads to Judgment Day in the Terminator franchise.\n\n\u2022 The animation in WhiteWhale\u2019s Brad Bird\u2013directed promo video is an homage to the Fleischer Brothers, whose distinctive style has recently resurged in popularity thanks to the video game Cuphead.\n\n\u2022 In the BoJack Horseman universe, Chicago has a sports team called the Baby Humans, with a mascot that riffs on that old hoary stereotype about babies drinking bottles of poison. \u201cIt\u2019s a tribute to your proud human heritage,\u201d Guy insists.\n\n\u2022 An incomplete sample of headlines from the GirlCroosh homepage: \u201cThis Little Llama Wants to Destroy Big Pharma,\u201d \u201cTexans and New Yorkers Trade Shoes for a Week,\u201d and \u201cWhy the Duplass Brothers Keep Running Across Busy Freeways.\u201d\n\n\u2022 The search bar on the GirlCroosh homepage also contains two different queries: \u201cryan gosling gifs\u201d and \u201cflyin gosling gifs.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Diane\u2019s ZIP code puts her Los Angeles address as somewhere in the vicinity of Atwater Village, which sounds about right.\n\n\u2022 In addition to a Ruth Bader Ginsburg gif titled \u201crbg_ftw,\u201d Diane\u2019s desktop apparently contains fan fiction about Kai Ryssdal, the host of the Peabody Award\u2013winning radio program Marketplace.\n\n\u2022 Matt Minnowman\u2019s funeral took place at the Holy Mackerel Church. His bio on the dating website Plenty of Fish read: \u201cJust a humble fish seeking to roe my boat.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Guy\u2019s place includes a movie poster for the BoJack-ified rom-com Hyena Fidelity, which presumably still takes place in Chicago.\n\n\u2022 Eagle-eyed fans of weird liquor will spot the skull-shaped bottle of the Dan Aykroyd\u2013backed Crystal Head Vodka behind a bar.\n\n\u2022 A sign that instructs pedestrians to \u201cFollow the Arrow to Madam Parrot\u2019s Tarot\u201d does a nice job highlighting how arbitrary English really is.\n\n\u2022 Per BoJack\u2019s letter, Beverly was hoping her secret admirer would turn out to be Mario \u2026 which means she\u2019s actually in love with Jay Hernandez.", "description": "While Diane takes a break from L.A., GirlCroosh gets folded into a massive, incoherent-sounding media company\u0010.
