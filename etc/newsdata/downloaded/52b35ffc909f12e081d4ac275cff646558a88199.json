Kevin McCarthy (R.-CA), along with House Republicans, to \u201cinsist on transparency from Joe Biden and his son Hunter\u201d regarding the \u201cmillions and millions of dollars taken out very rapidly\u201d from Ukraine and China while Biden was vice president. Earlier this year Hunter Biden stopped working for Ukrainian gas company, Burisma Holdings where he served as a board member since May of 2014. The former vice president's son was reportedly making $50,000 a month.\n\nTrump\u2019s comments come after he released a transcript of a July phone call held with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky \u2013 where some believe he pressured the leader to investigate the Biden\u2019s business dealings in the country.\n\nResponding to a question on trade from FOX Business reporter Kristina Partsinevelos, Trump continued to insist that China wanted to make a deal ahead of the thirteenth round of high-level discussions between the world\u2019s two largest economies scheduled for next month.\n\n\u201cI think they want to make a deal, they\u2019re losing their supply chain,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe have a lot of talks going on \u2026 companies are moving out of China and they\u2019re moving to lots of other places, including the United States.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe U.S. president also touted a number of deals struck with foreign countries during his meetings with members of the United Nations \u2013 including a deal with Japan, which he framed as a big win for U.S. farmers. When asked, however, whether NAFTA would be tossed out if Congress did not pass the USMCA, Trump declined to answer, saying that would be a \u201cvery interesting question.\u201d\n\nHe also predicted that the U.S. would have a big deal with the United Kingdom, depending on the outcome of the Brexit situation.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Trump also touted progress on a number of deals with other countries, including Japan.", "authors": ["Brittany De Lea"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/Trump-UN-2.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
