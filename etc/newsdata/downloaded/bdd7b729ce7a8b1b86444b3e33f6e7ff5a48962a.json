As thousands rallied at its entrance, riot police charged at the crowd on several occasions using batons and firing foam balls to prevent the risk of a forced mass entry, police said. Two arrests had been made in the region.\n\nPolice warned on Twitter that some violent protesters were building barricades and hurling things at police.\n\nLa Vanguardia newspaper cited health services as saying 37 people required medical attention after the clashes.\n\nThe airport chaos saw over 100 flights canceled and others delayed, while protesters in the separatist stronghold of Girona burned tyres on the train tracks, shutting the high-speed connection between Barcelona and France. Regional railways and roads were blocked at several places in the northeastern region.\n\nEarlier, acting Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said the sentence signified the defeat of the independence movement, whose campaign has caused Spain\u2019s most serious political crisis since the death of dictator Francisco Franco four decades ago.\n\nA government source told Reuters the situation so far was considered under control, but cautioned it would likely remain risky at least until the weekend.\n\nThe strength of the protests could be the first indication of how the future looks for the independence struggle, which has so far been largely peaceful. Nor does the ruling answer the question of how to handle the separatism drive supported by nearly half of Catalonia\u2019s population.\n\n\u201cThis sentence is an attack on democracy and the rights of all citizens,\u201d the president of the Catalan parliament, Roger Torrent, said. \u201cToday we are all convicted, not just 12 people.\u201d\n\nThe case concerned an independence referendum that was held in October 2017 despite being ruled illegal by Spanish courts, and the subsequent short-lived declaration of independence.\n\nThe longest prison term - 13 years - was imposed on the Catalan government\u2019s former deputy leader, Oriol Junqueras. The court convicted him and eight other leaders on charges of sedition and four of them of misuse of public funds.\n\nThree other defendants were found guilty only of disobedience and not sentenced to prison. All defendants were acquitted of the gravest charge, rebellion.\n\n\u201cWhat happened on October 1 (in 2017) was not just a demonstration or a massive act of citizen protest,\u201d the Madrid court said in its ruling. \u201cIt was a tumultuous uprising encouraged by the accused, among many others.\u201d\n\nSanchez, a Socialist, said it was time to open a new chapter, but he did not elaborate.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s decision confirms the defeat of a movement that failed to gain internal support and international recognition,\u201d he said in a televised speech.\n\nCabinet spokeswoman Isabel Celaa said the government hoped first of all to promote understanding within the region, saying: \u201cCatalonia must start a dialogue with Catalonia. ... This is precisely the basis for a co-existence,\u201d she said.\n\nProtesters clash with police during a demonstration at Barcelona's airport, after a verdict in a trial over a banned independence referendum, Spain October 14, 2019. REUTERS/Jon Nazca\n\nAn opinion poll in July showed 48.3% of Catalans against secession and 44% in favor.\n\n\u2018RISE UP\u2019\n\nThe jailed men sent out messages of defiance, urging people to take to the streets.\n\nThe CDR grassroots movement said on social media: \u201cIt\u2019s time to rise up against the authoritarian fascism of the Spanish state and its accomplices\u201d.\n\nIn Barcelona, protesters holding signs calling for \u201cFreedom for political prisoners\u201d blocked various main streets. A crowd chanted: \u201cWe\u2019ll do it again\u201d - a slogan used by separatist supporters who want to hold another referendum.\n\nAfter dark, thousands rallied at a square by the regional government palace singing the Catalan anthem and chanting: \u201cNo step backwards!\u201d An additional thousand or so protested in front of the heavily secured Spanish police headquarters, prompting at least one police charge to push them back.\n\nThe ruling is also likely to color a national election on Nov. 10, Spain\u2019s fourth in four years..\n\nThe jailed separatists said via social media that they would carry on their fight.\n\n\u201cNine years in prison won\u2019t end my optimism. Catalonia will be independent if we persist. Let us demonstrate without fear, let us move forward determinedly from non-violence to freedom,\u201d said Jordi Sanchez, former leader of the Catalan National Assembly grassroots movement, who was sentenced to nine years in prison.\n\nSlideshow (45 Images)\n\nRegional leader Quim Torra called for an amnesty for all those sentenced, but Sanchez said the sentences must be carried out, although he also suggested dialogue.\n\nSome in Catalonia said they no longer believed in that.\n\n\u201cWe had hope for dialogue, but the state is not up for dialogue. The sentence is very unfair, it\u2019s a great shame and very poor democracy,\u201d civil servant Angels Uibal said.\n\nThe court also issued an European arrest warrant for Carles Puigdemont, who was regional leader during its independence bid. He now lives in self-imposed exile in Belgium. In July 2018, the Spanish court dropped a warrant after Germany refused to extradite him.", "description": "Spain's Supreme Court on Monday jailed nine Catalan separatist leaders for between nine and 13 years for their role in a failed independence bid, a decision that triggered mass protests in the region and left the future course of the dispute uncertain.", "authors": ["Emma Pinedo", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440873841&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D1VD", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
