Racism has no place in society or football. It needs stamping out for good. Also a massive congrats to @OfficialTM_3 on a great debut \ud83d\udc4f #ThreeLions pic.twitter.com/yS9pEFeXie \u2014 Harry Kane (@HKane) October 14, 2019\n\nBut Kane, with his three assists and a goal, and Winks, handed a start in midfield, regained a positive feeling, much to the delight of Pochettino.\n\n\u201cAfter the disappointment on Friday, it was good for England, Southgate, the coaching staff and of course the players to feel that confidence,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt was fantastic for them to finish with a great result and to build their confidence.\n\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino wore an England shirt in support of his players (Gareth Fuller/PA)\n\n\u201cOf course, it was a tough game after Czech Republic and people were down. For our players, it continues the negative dynamic.\n\n\u201cI was hating watching the game thinking, \u2018We need to win, we need to win\u2019, putting on my England shirt!\n\n\u201cAfter Friday, it was tough but then Monday was better.\n\n\u201cThe best medicine is to score, assist, feel the victory and for sure that is going to help our team.\u201d\n\nSpurs will be expected to regain their own positive dynamic when they host winless Watford on Saturday.\n\nAfter a string of poor performances, littered with individual mistakes, Pochettino wants to ensure his side do not end up beating themselves.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be tough. We will fight against us, play against us. We are our own worst enemy,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThen after the opponent.\n\n\u201cI am so happy, the players react in a very good mood. We have talked a lot, individuals and collective.\n\n\u201cI was talking with the staff in a very honest conversation as always in these situations, trying to find the best way.\n\n\u201cIn the end our interest is Tottenham. Our objective is to put Tottenham in the place that Tottenham deserve to be.\u201d", "description": "The Argentinian was pleased Harry Kane and Harry Winks were able to enjoy the winning feeling again.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/12/wire-19881006-1571396677-715_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
