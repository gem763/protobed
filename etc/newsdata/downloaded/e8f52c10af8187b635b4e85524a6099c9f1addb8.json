False. The four basic human necessities are air, water, food, and shelter,\u201d she captioned the photo, quoting the character.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nThe idea was a hit on social media, with Sheffield\u2019s post earning over 1,000 likes in just days. But that\u2019s nothing compared to the nearly half-million likes it earned later in the week after Barstool Sports shared the picture on its Instagram page.\n\n\u201cHow can a simple photo like this make my entire day?\u201d one follower asked.\n\n\u201cThis is amazing,\u201d another chimed in.\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\nSheffield wasn\u2019t immediately available to confirm whether Jackwell will be dressing as Dwight on Oct. 31, but she did tell a Los Angeles Fox affiliate that she and her husband frequently play dress-up with Jackwell, as evidenced by another recent costume he was sporting on Sheffield\u2019s Instagram.\n\nBut whether Jackwell dresses as Dwight or not, there will likely be plenty of tiny Schrutes running around this year: The comments on Barstool Sports's post indicated that dozens of parents were banking the idea for Halloween, or at least next Halloween. Others were simply trying to convince their friends to dress their babies as tiny Dunder Mifflin assistant regional managers.\n\nSorry \u2014 assistant to the regional manager.\n\nAlexandria Hein contributed to this report.", "description": "Identity theft is not a joke, baby.", "authors": ["Michael Bartiromo"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/DwightSchruteJustinLubinNBCNBCUPhotoBank.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
