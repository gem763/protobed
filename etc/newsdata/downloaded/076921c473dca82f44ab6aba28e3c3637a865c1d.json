There are 330,000 British living there now - and that\u2019s just people registered in the embassies, there could be two or three times more British people living there, who are not declared because of fiscal reasons.\n\n\"And one-third of them are pensioners: so if there\u2019s a deal, nothing will change, they\u2019re going to keep their rights.\n\n\"But what about if there\u2019s no deal? They\u2019re going to be in limbo. [UK foreign minister] Dominic Raab sent a letter to the British expats in Spain two weeks ago saying \u201cdon\u2019t worry, we\u2019re going to take care of you\u201d - but you have to go the embassy or the consulate very regularly, to check on your situation.\n\n\u201cAnother thing is that there are 180,000 Spanish people registered in the UK, so if things work out badly for the British, they\u2019re going to go badly for the Spanish too.\u201d\n\nLena Roche, from Euronews\u2019s German service, said economists are very worried about Brexit because of the close trade ties between Germany and Britain.\n\n\u201cIt has already had an impact,\u201d she said. \u201cIn 2016 Britain was Germany\u2019s fifth most important trading partner, now it is seventh.\u201d\n\nWatch Javier's and Lena's interviews in the video player, above.", "description": "Brexit has not yet happened - but already the uncertainty has affected trade between Britain and its European partners.", "authors": ["Javier Villagarcia"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/25/69/48/1000x563_cmsv2_be19e812-592a-5b49-95b2-b3cc7dd1f25f-4256948.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
