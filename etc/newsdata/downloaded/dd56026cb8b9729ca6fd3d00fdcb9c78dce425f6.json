We went from over 19,000 people in custody just four short months ago, [down] to less than 4,000 [in custody].\u201d\n\nThe reduction has allowed CBP to end the emergency policy of catch and release, he said. \u201cWe have essentially ended catch and release [so] if you come to our borders now with a child, it\u2019s no longer an immediate passport into the interior of the United States.\u201d\n\nHowever, many migrants are released into the United States after being identified and processed by other agencies at the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nOverall, the agency dealt with nearly one million migrants in 2019, Morgan said.\n\nAlso, another 150,000 migrants crossed illegally, he said. \u201cWe estimate \u2014 and this is a conservative estimate \u2014 that there\u2019s probably around 150,000 individuals who avoided apprehension. That\u2019s nearly 13,000 each month.\u201d\n\nMore than 52,000 migrants have been returned temporarily to Mexico via the Migrant Protection Protocols, he said. They are allowed to attend court hearings in the United States but are not allowed to get U.S. jobs while they wait for the hearings.\n\nAlso, the border agency will begin enforcing President Donald Trump\u2019s asylum reforms next week, he said. The new rules require migrants to apply for asylum in the countries that they cross over from on their way to the U.S. border. If they do not apply for asylum in the countries, the United States government officials need not accept their requests for asylum.\n\n\u201cThe message is getting out,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cWe\u2019re closing those loopholes \u2026 [and] we\u2019re trying to overcome the message that the cartels have been putting out there that it\u2019s going to be a free ride in the United States.\u201d\n\nMorgan also touted interior enforcement efforts. \u201cUnited States Immigration and Customs Enforcement [recently] arrested 97 illegal aliens in six Midwest states,\u201d he said.\n\nMorgan repeatedly praised Mexico\u2019s support, saying:\n\nMexico\u2019s efforts are leading the way. Mexico\u2019s continued support of MPP [Migrant Protection Protocols] and enhanced border security efforts along their southern border in the interior and along the U.S.-Mexico border is something really for the history books. The partnership between Mexico and the United States concerning this regional crisis is having a dramatic impact.\n\nThe border enforcement is also helping to block deadly drug trafficking, he said.\n\nBorder agencies also rescue many migrants in danger, he said. \u201cThey see a human being in need, and they answer the call, and they\u2019ve done so 4,900 times this year.\u201d\n\nMorgan also praised his agency\u2019s officers, saying:\n\nMake no mistake. This country is safer because of their efforts, their sacrifices and their dedication. This past Sunday we lost another border patrol agent, Robert Hotten, in the line of duty while he was patrolling the Tucson sector. He marks the 129th border patrol agent who has died in the line of duty. He leaves behind a wife and a son \u2026 He will be missed, but never forgotten", "description": "Border agencies apprehended 52,000 migrants at the border during September, down from 144,000 migrants in May.", "authors": ["Neil Munro"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/CBP-at-border-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
