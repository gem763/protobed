The\n\nlast thing the global economy now needs is a surge in oil\n\nprices.\"\n\nAdding to some weak indicators from China last week,\n\nindustrial production in the world's second largest economy grew\n\nat its weakest pace in 17-1/2 years in August amid rising U.S.\n\ntrade pressure and softening domestic demand. The pan-European STOXX 600 index and\n\ntrade-sensitive German shares were both down 0.6%.\n\nEuropean stocks ended Friday with their fourth straight\n\nweekly gain, as investors circled back into cyclical sectors\n\namid signs of progress in U.S.-China trade talks.\n\nThe European Central Bank also cut rates deeper into\n\nnegative territory last week and relaunched bond purchases with\n\nno scheduled end-date, laying down a marker that it would\n\ncontinue to do all it could to support euro zone growth.\n\n\n\nMarket participants are now looking to the U.S. Federal\n\nReserve's policy meeting starting Wednesday, where the central\n\nbank is widely expected to ease interest rates and signal\n\nfurther moves.\n\nIn other corporate news, Volkswagen was down\n\n0.5% as the automaker agreed to pay up to $127 million ($87.3\n\nmillion) to settle lawsuits brought on behalf of thousands of\n\nAustralian customers caught up in its global diesel emissions\n\ncheating scandal.", "description": "UPDATE 1-European stocks suffer from Saudi attacks, but oil firms soar", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/Brazil-Stock-Market_3_800x533_L_1414427437.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
