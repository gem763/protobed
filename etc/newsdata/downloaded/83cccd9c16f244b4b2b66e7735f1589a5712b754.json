The Salvation Army, Sikh gurdwaras and a Chinese community support centre have been among bodies allowing Home Office teams in London to run the sessions, which are presented as a way that homeless people may be able to get help and regularise their immigration status. Instead, if enforcement officials conclude that attendees have no right to be in the country, they can be targeted for voluntary removal or deportation. The practice has been condemned by other charities and lawyers for deepening mistrust between homeless people towards authorities.\n\nSimon Hattenstone and Daniel Lavelle today revisit the story of Gyula Remes, a Hungarian man who died on Westminster\u2019s doorstep. Jean Demars writes that the hostile environment\u2019s highly politicised agenda has \u201cpermeated every capillary and access point of the welfare state and civil society\u201d.\n\n\u2018Appalling\u2019 \u2013 England\u2019s Euro 2020 qualifier in Sofia came close to being abandoned after Bulgarian fans repeatedly racially abused Tyrone Mings, Raheem Sterling and Marcus Rashford. Play was halted twice in the first half, and at half-time the Bulgaria captain, Ivelin Popov, approached an area of the stands where the chants were coming from to plead for his supporters to stop. Many Bulgarian fans then left the stadium with their team already 4-0 down, although some of the chanting continued. The FA chairman, Greg Clarke, described it as \u201cone of the most appalling nights I\u2019ve seen in football\u201d. Gareth Southgate praised his players, saying he was \u201cincredibly proud\u201d they had taken a stand by having play halted twice. Barney Ronay indicts Bulgarian spectators for \u201cgleefully taking the opportunity to abuse black footballers and to demonstrate in some cases that they are fascists \u2026 For now, no other European nation should be asked to play in Sofia.\u201d\n\nTrump rounds on Turkey \u2013 Just over a week after clearing the way for Turkish troops to pour into Syria, Donald Trump has now imposed sanctions on Turkey, called for a ceasefire and suspended trade talks witn Ankara. The region\u2019s Kurdish forces have turned to a deal with the Russian-backed Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, to help fend off Turkey\u2019s invasion. Three orphan siblings believed to be British citizens have been evacuated from one area under Turkish assault \u2013 they are thought to have travelled to Syria with their parents from London five years ago. Save the Children said: \u201cChildren in Syria who have fled Isis-held areas are innocent.\u201d A UK government spokesperson said it would look at all such cases but \u201cthis process is far from straightforward.\u201d The Turkish assault has dented Saudi Arabia\u2019s confidence in Donald Trump, according to the kingdom\u2019s ambassador to the UK, Prince Khalid bin Bandar bin Sultan Al Saud. The ambassador called Trump a \u201ctweet monster\u201d and said: \u201cThe last thing we need is another front of chaos in the region and I think we just got it.\u201d\n\nBooker rules torn up \u2013 The judges of this year\u2019s Booker prize have named Margaret Atwood and Bernardine Evaristo its first joint winners in almost 30 years. They chose two novels: Atwood\u2019s The Testaments, a follow-up to her dystopian The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, and Evaristo\u2019s Girl, Woman, Other, which is told in the voices of 12 different characters, mostly black women.\n\nPlay Video 2:11 Margaret Atwood and Bernardine Evaristo jointly awarded Booker Prize \u2013 video\n\n\u201cThe more we talked about them, the more we treasured both of them and wanted them both as winners,\u201d said Peter Florence, the chair of judges. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t separate them.\u201d The cash prize of \u00a350,000 will be split between the two authors. Justine Jordan, the Guardian\u2019s deputy literary editor, responds: \u201cTwo extraordinary books, then: but it has to be said that this feels like a fudge, weighing a huge event novel against a more obscure choice and trying to have it both ways.\u201d\n\n\u2018We need more time\u2019 \u2013 Boris Johnson appears to have edged closer to the parliamentary numbers needed to pass a Brexit deal, with more hardline Eurosceptics and pro-deal Labour MPs indicating they could back a new agreement with the EU. It is likely to become clear within the next few days whether it will be possible to get a deal at Thursday\u2019s European summit \u2013 the government will have to table a motion in parliament by Wednesday if it wants to convene MPs for a Saturday sitting to debate any agreement. There are indications from EU leaders that they think an extension will be needed to allow the complicated talks to stretch into next week. \u201cWe need more time,\u201d said the Finnish PM, Antti Rinne, whose country holds the rotating EU presidency.\n\nTory lobbying for oil firm revealed \u2013 Theresa May and David Cameron each pressed the Bahraini royal family to award a multibillion-dollar oil contract to Petrofac, a company headed by the major Conservative donor Ayman Asfari, the Guardian has established. Asfari and his wife, Sawsan, have given almost \u00a3800,000 to the Conservative party since 2009 as personal donations. The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has been investigating Petrofac over suspected bribery, corruption and money laundering. In February this year a former executive pleaded guilty to 11 counts of offering bribes in an attempt to secure contracts in Saudi Arabia and Iraq.\n\nHead injury drug breakthrough \u2013 Tranexamic acid, which is cheap and widely available, could save tens of thousands of lives each year from dying of head injuries, researchers say. It slows the breakdown of blood clots and is already used to control heavy bleeding in people who have, for example, been shot or stabbed. New research suggests it should be rapidly administered to patients with mild to moderate traumatic brain injuries, for instance from a car crash. \u201cIf you reduce the bleeding you could save their life because they are bleeding more slowly,\u201d said the study\u2019s co-leader, Professor Ian Roberts of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. \u201cIf you stop them bleeding it stops them developing a big bruise inside the head which can squash the brain and kill you.\u201d\n\nToday in Focus podcast: The Hongkonger\u2019s tale\n\nA Hong Kong protester describes why he has returned to the streets, week in week out, in the face of an increasingly brutal crackdown by the authorities. And: Polly Toynbee on the Queen\u2019s speech.\n\nToday in Focus The Hongkonger's tale Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https://audio.guim.co.uk/2019/10/14-67429-911015TIF_hongkong.mp3 00:00:00 00:29:27\n\nLunchtime read: The DIY pharmacist of Amsterdam\n\nWhen Leadiant Biosciences raised the price of its synthetic liver enzyme CDCA from \u20ac30,000 to \u20ac150,000 year, the Netherlands\u2019 health insurers refused to keep paying for patients\u2019 treatment. So there was only one thing for pharmacist Marleen Kemper to do: make it herself, so that sufferers of a rare genetic disorder known as CTX could continue to receive the drug that gives them back their lives.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Illustration: Jake Hollings\n\nThe respected hospital pharmacist at Amsterdam UMC\u2019s Academic Medical Centre would always be the one to do something like this: at school she watched two classmates get ill and die, and carried into her career in medicine a steely determination to do right by her patients. Leadiant holds the exclusive EU rights to its version of CDCA, but pharmacies are allowed to make (or \u201ccompound\u201d) a prescribed drug on a small scale for their patients. But when you undercut big pharma, things quickly get interesting.\n\nSport\n\nGareth Southgate felt his England players made a \u201cmajor statement\u201d in getting their Euro 2020 qualifier against Bulgaria halted twice as he reflected on a disturbing spectacle that will live long in sporting infamy. Elsewhere, Northern Ireland achieved what England could not as they beat the Czech Republic in Prague and Cristiano Ronaldo scored his 700th career goal when he converted a 72nd-minute penalty in Portugal\u2019s defeat by Ukraine.\n\nMichael Cheika has questioned the wisdom of Eddie Jones bringing the Australian rugby league legend Ricky Stuart into the England camp and behind enemy lines in the week of their World Cup quarter-final clash. Josh Adams\u2019s outstanding impression on Test rugby has left him on the verge of a World Cup record for Wales as he prepares for the biggest week of his career. Adams has already scored five tries in Japan. And Ferrari were left to rue shambolic management of their drivers after Mercedes flexed their muscles at the Japanese GP and delivered a near-perfect showing at Suzuka.\n\nBusiness\n\nGovernment attempts to claw back pay and bonuses from executives who presided over the collapse of Thomas Cook are likely to recoup no more than \u00a31m. Directors will appear before MPs today to explain how the company went bust while executives were awarded millions in remuneration. But it is believed that only a fraction will be returned to administrators. Stocks made modest gains in Asia overnight and the FTSE100 looks set to rise as well this morning. The pound is worth $1.262 and \u20ac1.144.\n\nThe papers\n\nThe Queen\u2019s speech features prominently on a lot of the front pages today. The i has a large picture of the Queen and the headline: \u201cJohnson\u2019s wishlist\u201d, the Express has: \u201cBoris: I\u2019ll get this amazing country moving again\u201d and the Times reports: \u201cQueen\u2019s speech sets out PM\u2019s election manifesto\u201d. The Telegraph has a large picture of the smiling Queen and the assessment that \u201cJohnson edges closer to Brexit deal\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Guardian front page, Tuesday 15 October 2019.\n\nRacist abuse directed against English football players in Bulgaria leads on some of the front pages including the Mirror: \u201cEngland stand tall against the racists\u201d and the Sun: \u201cBulgar off, you racists\u201d.\n\nIn other news, the FT leads on \u201cFacebook fears digital currency delay as regulatory hurdles loom\u201d, the Guardian has: \u201cMarch of the \u2018welfare robot\u2019 triggers fears for poorest\u201d and the Daily Mail reports on backlash from customers after Barclays announced it would end cash withdrawals at post offices: \u201c15 million reasons to think again, Barclays!\u201d\n\nSign up\n\nThe Guardian Morning Briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes bright and early every weekday.
