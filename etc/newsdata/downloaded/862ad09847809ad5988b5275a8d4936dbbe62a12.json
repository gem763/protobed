He was treated by Dr. Douglas Scherr at Weill Cornell Medical College, and by Sept. 2017, his cancer was in remission.\n\nPat Steir's painting \"Reminds Me of Berlin I\" is estimated to sell for between $150,000 and $200,000. Courtesy of Sotheby's\n\nBladder cancer is little-discussed, yet it is the fourth most-diagnosed cancer in the country. Advances have been slow due to lack of funding for research. In the U.S., $600 million is dedicated annually to breast cancer research compared to only $22 million to bladder cancer.\n\n\u201cThis is why I decided to be an advocate and fundraiser for bladder cancer research and help to improve the diagnosis and treatment of bladder cancer,\u201d Rondinone says.\n\nThe 14 artists who contributed to the auction include Joe Bradley, Carroll Dunham, Latifa Echakhch, John Giorno, Peter Halley, Shara Hughes, Sarah Lucas, Chris Martin, Adam McEwen, Oscar Murillo, Elizabeth Peyton, Bosco Sodi, Pat Steir, and Franz West.\n\nSome artists created new works for the auction, while others donated pieces already on display at galleries. Prices range from $7,000 to $200,000.\n\nProceeds of the sale will go to the urologic oncology research team, led by Dr. Scherr and Dr. Juan Cubillos-Ruiz at Weill Cornell Medical College.", "description": "The sale could raise up to $2 million for urologic oncology research at Weill Cornell Medical College", "authors": ["Fang Block"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-110946/social", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
