Another driver, aged 16, also died, while the third driver was not injured. Their names were not released.\n\nThe Taos County Sheriff's Office told Associated Press that alcohol may have been a factor in the accident, but did not release details.\n\nIn an Instagram story posted hours before her death, the singer shared an emotional and eerie story about a car accident with her followers.\n\n\"Alright, I look a mess. It's because I've been crying. It's a good cry. I just got to Taos, New Mexico,\" she said in the clip, which she filmed from the car while it was stationary. \"But for those of you who don't know, I spent the last 20 years of my life coming to Taos with my dad and my sister.\"\n\n\"My grandparents lived here, my uncle still lives here.\n\n\"Literally, everybody that was here has passed away, except for my uncle, and including my dad,\" she said.\n\n\"Driving these roads \u2014 I've been driving for 12 hours \u2014 you would think that's so exhausting and boring but the last couple of hours driving through the mountains, I'm just remembering my place in the backseat as a little kid when my dad was making these treks here,\" she continued. \"It was the fucking best, and I started getting really sad.\n\n\"Then all of a sudden these random cows show up in the middle of the road.\"\n\nHarris then recalled being in the backseat of her father's car with her sister when she was a child \u2014 she had been asleep when suddenly they hit \"something really hard.\"\n\n\"I popped up my head and was like, 'What was that?' and my dad said, 'Cow guard!'\"\n\n\"But really he had hit a cow,\" she said. \"I know that's very depressing but just the fact that when I was on my trek into the mountains, I just started crying and I was sad, and all of a sudden these cows just appeared out of nowhere. We grieve in different ways.\"\n\nWatch the video below:\n\nSarah Hearne (daughter of Michael Hearne, whose annual festival Harris was on her way to perform at) said that the show would go on, and that performances would be dedicated to Harris: \"They're going to play their hearts out. That's what she would have wanted.\"\n\n\"Her career was just ready to take off. She was about to skyrocket,\" Hearne added.\n\nHarris released a self-titled EP in March in which she wrote a song for her daughter entitled, \"Twenty Years From Now.\"\n\nTragically, Harris \u2014 who was a single mother \u2014 told Billboard in March that she had written the song about living to see her daughter's children. She penned the song after her own father died of cancer, aged 54.\n\n\"It scared me thinking that it was totally possible I could be gone before my daughter reaches that point,\" she told Billboard. \"I want to meet my kid's kids. Getting to the age your parents were when you were a child brings a whole lot of perspective.\"", "description": "Harris was on her way to Michael Hearne's Big Barn Dance Music Festival in Taos when she was involved in the fatal crash.", "authors": ["Tom Murray"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d722cab21214c3d075732b4-1536-768.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
