It happened around 9:41 a.m. Sunday on the south side of the Chesapeake and Delaware canal in Delaware.\n\nDelaware State Police say the driver of the car was traveling around the canal's narrow banks when a turn was miscalculated and the car with five people inside plunged into the water.\n\nRosetta Taylor can hardly believe she'll never talk to some of her great grandchildren again after the car they were riding in veered off the road and into the Chesapeake and Delaware canal.\n\nThe only survivor is a 16-year-old girl.\n\n\"One got out, a girl. She was in the car, she got out. But the other four didn't make it,\" Taylor said.\n\nA team of divers were deployed to find the others, but the rescue effort turned into a recovery.\n\nThe victims' ages are 18, 16, 12 and 6. They were following their parents who were in a car in front of them, all going to a youth football game when tragedy struck.\n\nThe sole survivor told police that the driver was an 18-year-old man who helped her to the shore then went back into the water to try to rescue the others.\n\nFirst responders later discovered his body and pronounced him dead at the scene.\n\n\"He was a hero and tried to do everything he could to help the remaining passengers in that vehicle,\" Delaware State Police Master Corporal Michael Austin said.\n\nPolice say the 16-year-old and 12-year-old boys' bodies were found in the vehicle, which was pulled out of the water just before 5 p.m.\n\nThe 6-year-old boy remains unaccounted for, according to authorities.", "description": "The sole survivor told police that the driver was an 18-year-old man who helped her to shore", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/07/97f5524c-890b-4120-ab2d-3ec9745c54b9/thumbnail/1200x630g6/d14ca5db87e2971a8fc855cff9b691a7/canal-car-crash-cbs-philly.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
