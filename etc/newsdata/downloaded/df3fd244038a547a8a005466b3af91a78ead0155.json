When you don\u2019t feel comfortable, you might develop some habits designed to make things more manageable. You might have back pain that makes it hard to sit in certain chairs. You could potentially have widespread pain that makes it difficult to stay still. Your pain could make you seem angry and irritable.\n\nWhatever it is you might be doing, the people in your life just might not get it. Chronic pain is usually invisible to others so they can\u2019t \u201csee\u201d why you need to use a certain chair, don\u2019t want to go to places with cramped seating options or spend long periods of time in the cold, which exacerbates your pain. You may be worried others are judging you or feel self-conscious about your actions. But you\u2019re not alone in your chronic pain \u201chabits.\u201d\n\nIn order to learn more about the tendencies people have due to constantly being in pain, we asked our Mighty community what they do to help manage. We wanted to learn what they feel first-hand. If you live in constant pain and can relate, share this list with the people in your life so they can have a better understanding of what you\u2019re going through. And if you\u2019re struggling with coping with your chronic pain, talk to someone you trust.\n\nRelated:\u200b When I Lost My Sense of Self Because of Chronic Pain\n\nHere\u2019s what our community shared with us:\n\n1. You can\u2019t sit still.\n\n\u201cWhen I sit, I rock back and forth. It annoys a lot of people and I was asked many times if I\u2019m autistic. But it helps distract from the pain and the soft constant movement helps.\u201d \u2014 Melanie C.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m constantly finding ways to move my limbs and muscles (even when sitting there talking to you) in an attempt to stretch out some of the pain that makes it hard to move those areas. I can find a way to stretch just about any muscle in the body. I have also hurt myself at times stretching too far or in too awkward of a position. But sitting still without stretching a spot that is nagging badly is hard sometimes.\u201d \u2014 Teresa H.\n\n\u201cI constantly fidget in my seat because I\u2019m trying to find the most comfortable position. That\u2019s difficult to do when most of your pain generates from your SI joint/hip region and inactivity causes even more pain.\u201d \u2014 Melissa C.\n\nRelated:\u200b Challenging the Guilt From Canceling Plans Due to Chronic Illness\n\n2. You pretend you\u2019re fine even though you\u2019re not.\n\n\u201cI smile a lot. Like, most of the time, if I leave my house, that is. Why? If I don\u2019t look like something\u2019s bothering me, then people don\u2019t ask me what\u2019s wrong. As long as people aren\u2019t constantly asking me what\u2019s wrong, since it\u2019s a long list of things that make me feel regularly lousy, it\u2019s easier to fake it through my day and not completely lose my shit because I feel so terrible.\u201d \u2013 Erin P.\n\n\u201cI say I\u2019m fine and smile even when I want to lay down and cry.\u201d \u2013 @burdle09\n\n3. You push people away.\n\n\u201cI push people away (unintentionally) and at the same time, I want them to remain my friend or spouse. It\u2019s a constant mental battle. It seems to be more of a protection mechanism for yourself and also for them, but deep down, you just want to be there for them too.\u201d \u2013 Rachel A.\n\nRelated:\u200b How to Find Joy When Fighting Chronic Pain on a Daily Basis\n\n4. You don\u2019t sleep as often as you should.\n\n\u201cRefusing sleep because it is too much pain laying down, even when I am not in much pain. The thought of possible pain makes me not lay down to sleep.\u201d \u2013 Madi N.\n\n\u201c[I used to] sleep a lot. It used to be the only thing that brought me relief, but now, even lying in bed until I fall asleep is painful.\u201d \u2013 Allison M.\n\n5. You avoid socializing.\n\n\u201cNot going anywhere, not working and not socializing with people because I can\u2019t focus on having a conversation with anyone when my pain is out of control.\u201d \u2013 Cassie K.\n\n\u201cI go AWOL with friends and family, trying to dodge phone calls (responding by SMS), invites or sudden appearances of people at my front door.\u201d \u2013 Min L.\n\n6. You choose what you wear carefully.\n\n\u201cDeciding what to wear based on how stable I am feeling, how much pain I am in and what kind support my ankles need. If I have to wear my support sneakers, I usually wear pants or jeans. If I am having a bad pain day, a skirt and flowy top may just be easier to get on in the morning.\u201d \u2013 @emjaydraonfly\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t wear pretty bras or panties anymore. The pressure they create can cause pain above my rib cage and around my waist for days. I have to wear \u2018granny panties\u2019 and wireless bras. I miss feeling sexy.\u201d \u2013 @AmateurNerd", "description": "When you live with chronic pain, you sometimes form habits that aren't always understood by other people.
