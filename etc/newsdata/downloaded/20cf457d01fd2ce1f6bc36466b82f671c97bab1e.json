An opinion poll published in July by the Catalan regional government showed a 44-percent support for independence with 48.3 percent opposed.\n\nXavier Dalamantes, a 40-year-old working in the pharmaceutical industry who attended Sunday's rally with a Spanish flag draped over his shoulders, told AFP that the time had come \"to get out there and say what one thinks - they (the separatists) are trying to turn Catalonia into a totalitarian state.\"\n\nWhile Maria Jose Aguilar, a protester, also voiced his concerns and preference for unity over separation.\n\n\"I consider myself Spanish and Catalan so I cannot conceive that we would be separated from Spain, simply,\" Aguilar, a 56-year-old business owner and unionist demonstrator told Associated Press.\n\n'Silent majority'\n\nSunday's rally was called by the Catalan Civil Society (SCC) association, which said it wanted to show that those opposing secession from the rest of Spain comprise a \"silent majority\".\n\n\"That is an important message for Catalonia, Spain and the world,\" said SCC chairman Fernando Sanchez Costa.\n\nSeparatists, on the other hand, say they have the right to ask for self-determination.\n\n\"We have to be capable of creating a republic of free men and woman ... and overcoming the confrontational dynamic with a constructive one,\" Quim Torra, the regional government head, said on Saturday.\n\nWith Spain just two weeks away from a fourth general election in as many years, members of the socialist government and leaders of the country's conservative parties joined Sunday's rally.\n\nSpanish Foreign Minister Josep Borrell, a Catalan, meanwhile slammed \"an unacceptable level of violence\" after Saturday's peaceful march later degenerated when thousands created an offshoot protest.\n\nSome hurled projectiles at riot police who eventually charged, using batons and foam rounds to disperse them.\n\nThey were met with bottles, rocks and fireworks, an AFP correspondent said before clearing the area at about 11:00pm local time (22:00 GMT).", "description": "An estimated 80,000 people stage counter-march in Barcelona a day after huge protest against jailing of Catalan leaders.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/27/6aee2e5641c646d087c266bffeec440a_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
