NOTHING TO DO WITH ME.\" The New York Times reported Monday that Prestwick reached an agreement with Trump and the Trump Organization in 2014 to steer travelers to Trump\u2019s resort. As recently as 2017, Turnberry turned a seven-figure loss, and Trump has also personally loaned $144.6 million to keep the place afloat. After Trump bought the resort, there were 40 overnight stays.
