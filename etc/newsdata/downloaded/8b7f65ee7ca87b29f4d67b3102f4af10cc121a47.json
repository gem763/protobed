Belichick defended Pats cornerback Jonathan Jones on Monday, saying Jones was coached to tackle that way, according to Tom E. Curran of NBC Sports Boston.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nBelichick added that the Patriots would have to alter their coaching techniques if the league believes that hit was a foul.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nB.B. on OMF regarding Jonathan Jones\u2019 tackle of Josh Allen : \u201cJon did what we\u2019ve coached him to do. If that\u2019s a foul we\u2019ll have to coach him differently.\u201d \u2014 Tom E. Curran (@tomecurran) September 30, 2019\n\nThe hit occurred on the second play of the fourth quarter in the Patriots\u2019 16-10 win over the Bills. Allen scrambled to try and pick up a first down on third-and-8. As Allen was running, Jones came in and engaged in a helmet-to-helmet hit on Allen. The 23-year-old Allen was knocked out cold and left the game. Allen is currently in the NFL\u2019s concussion protocol.\n\nFollowing the contest, Bills coach Sean McDermott said Jones should have been ejected for that hit. McDermott added, \u201cThere\u2019s no room in football for that.\u201d Bills safety Micah Hyde made similar comments, saying a Bills player would have been ejected for doing the same thing to Tom Brady.\n\nBrady also addressed the hit Monday, saying all quarterbacks need to weigh the risks and rewards of running with the ball. Brady added that Belichick once told Brady to either throw the ball away or slide in those scenarios so he doesn\u2019t have to take big hits.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe league reviewed tape of the hit and determined Jones did not engage in the type of play that should have led to an ejection. Jones was still penalized for the play, so Belichick may want to go over some extra tackling pointers in practice this week.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nChris Cwik is a writer for Yahoo Sports.
