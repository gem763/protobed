As was the case in the previous quarter, net income and earnings per share more than doubled, boosted by increased charter rates and the addition of new ships,\" said Gregory Zikos, chief financial officer of the Monaco-based Costamare.\n\nIncluding one-time expenses, the company reported $28 million in net income to common shareholders.\n\nRevenue from chartering container ships to liner operators came in at $123.6 million for the quarter, a gain of 35%.\n\nThe company said charter revenue was higher thanks to the addition of four new container ships to its fleet and a higher number of operating days for the company's 60 vessels.\n\nSource: Costamare\n\nThe company extended or entered charter agreements for four post-panamax vessels during the quarter, with an additional nine vessels below 5,500 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) in capacity seeing charters extended.\n\nCostamare said charter rates for the larger container ships continued to improve and there is \"limited supply available for the post-panamax sizes\" above 5,500 TEUs.\n\n\"We have 18 post-panamax ships coming off charter over the next year, which positions us favorably, should market momentum continue,\" Zikos said.\n\nImage Sourced from Pixabay.
