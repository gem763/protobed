Now the Springboks winger wants to show the Japanese flyers what he can do with the ball in a bit of space.\n\nIn an age when big, powerful players are all pervasive, the diminutive South Africa and Japanese wings have been a breath of fresh air at the World Cup.\n\nThe territory gained and the attacking threats posed by these dynamic outside backs have compelled their teammates to spread the ball wide in a bid to beat tight defenses on the fringes rather than constantly battering away in the middle.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a saying going around that dynamite comes in small packages,\u201d said Kolbe, who has overcome an ankle injury and is raring to go in Sunday\u2019s quarterfinal at Tokyo Stadium. \u201cWe all have something special we can contribute to our teams. Both Japanese wingers are playing phenomenal rugby, and that is what we have to do for our national teams.\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s about giving as much momentum as possible for our forwards to keep going on the front foot.\u201d\n\nKolbe will likely be marking Fukuoka in a match getting plenty of hype following Japan\u2019s massive 34-32 upset win over South Africa in their previous World Cup meeting in 2015 at Brighton, England.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a lot of speed, is really powerful and explosive,\u201d said Kolbe, who is 1.75 meters (5 feet, 8 inches) tall and weighs 74 kilograms (163 pounds). \u201cIt\u2019s going to be an exciting challenge.\u201d\n\nFukuoka has scored 25 tries in 37 tests, including a pair against Scotland at Yokohama in a win that sealed Japan\u2019s spot in the quarterfinals for the first time. He also scored Japan\u2019s only try after going on as a replacement in an upset win over Ireland.\n\nFukuoka, who is the same height as Kolbe but weighs 83 kilograms (183 pounds), also set up Matsushima\u2019s opening five-pointer against the Scots with a strong burst and stunning offload on the left flank. He stripped a Scottish player of the ball and sprinted away to score the try three minutes after halftime that sealed the bonus point and ultimately the victory for Japan.\n\nFukuoka\u2019s 110 meters of running were more than double Scotland\u2019s Chris Harris, who carried the ball further than anyone on his team with 49 meters.\n\nHe\u2019s had his ups and downs in terms of selections - the only game he started at the 2015 World Cup was a loss to Scotland, and he was derided for a woeful defensive performance against the U.S. in 2014 - but he\u2019s a crowd favorite in Japan and has scored four tries already in the tournament.\n\nMatsushima, who was born in South Africa to Japanese parents, has scored 22 tries in 38 tests and played in the win over South Africa in Brighton four years ago. The 1.78 meter (5-foot, 10-inch), 87-kilogram (191-pound) speedster scored a hat-trick of tries in Japan\u2019s tournament-opening win over Russia, and the opener against Scotland.\n\nUntil Japan\u2019s 4-0 run in the group stage here, the so-called Miracle of Brighton was a career highlight for him.\n\nThis game will be different. Nobody can say the Japan squad has snuck up on anyone in the first Rugby World Cup staged in Asia.\n\nWins over an Irish team that was ranked No. 1 before the tournament and an undefeated group-stage run capped with a 28-21 win over Scotland have put Japan firmly among the top eight teams at the World Cup.\n\nSouth Africa had a 41-7 win over Japan in a warm-up match on Sept. 6 at Kumagaya, with Kolbe scoring two tries, and the Springboks were hoping that would bury memories of the famous defeat.\n\n\u201cKnowing we had the 2015 loss to Japan - I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s stuck in our head, but we know it happened,\u201d Kolbe said. \u201cBut it\u2019s four years later and a new opportunity for us.\u201d\n\nThe South Africans came off second-best against the defending champion New Zealand All Blacks in the Pool B opener, and had to settle for second spot in the group. They were probably preparing for a quarterfinal against Ireland, but Kolbe said they\u2019re ready for anything.\n\nThe Springboks have the more seasoned pack, and will be trying to outmuscle Japan across the field in a bid to smother the fast-and-furious game plan that has worked so well so far for the tournament hosts.\n\n\u201cJapan are playing exciting rugby - they\u2019re giving the ball a lot of air, and want to stretch your defensive structures,\u201d Kolbe said. \u201cIt\u2019s a style I love to play as well.\n\n\u201cBut we have our own structures and plan we want to implement, especially this weekend, and cut down their options to force them into some structure.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Cheslin Kolbe got a real kick out of watching Kenki Fukuoka and Katoro Matsushima burn off the Scottish defenders last weekend.
