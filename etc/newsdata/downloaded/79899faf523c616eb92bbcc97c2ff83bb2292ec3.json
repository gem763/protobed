After \u201cWeekend Update,\u201d the sketches descended into chaos. Aidy Bryant joined Chance in cracking up during \u201cChoir Fashion,\u201d a hilariously specific breakdown of the frumpy attire teenagers are forced to wear in show choir. Chance\u2019s laughing at Kenan Thompson\u2019s tormented cries of \u201cthe mooooon\u201d in the sketch \u201cDance Rehearsal\u201d nearly broke new cast member Bowen Yang.\n\nMost spectacularly, \u201cLove at First Sight,\u201d a tricky sketch involving harnesses that lifted Chance and cast members Cecily Strong and Beck Bennett into the air, led to fits of giggles from the actors during a sequence in which they ad-libbed while apparently waiting for a harness to be attached to Bennett. Normally, such a scenario would\u2019ve been awkward, but the sketch had already become more about the bizarre maneuvering than about the premise. Earlier in the scene, Chance and Strong had encountered a mishap when they flew in the wrong direction. Rather than let the error get in the way, the duo leaned into it, playing up the ridiculousness of the sketch\u2019s technical ambition. It reminded me of 2018\u2019s \u201cGirlfriends Game Night,\u201d in which the host, Bill Hader, attempted to operate a motorized wheelchair without moving a muscle, only to push Melissa Villase\u00f1or across the set\u2014a move that drew more laughs than any of the jokes. Obviously, messing up on live TV shouldn\u2019t be the goal of SNL, but when it happens to an adaptable host, a mistake can turn a faltering sketch into something memorable.\n\nThat said, a game host doesn\u2019t always yield a successful episode. Luckily for Chance, the collection of sketches that made it to air shared a similar sensibility; most of them were remarkably dark in their humor, lending the episode a thematic cohesiveness. (The Halloween peg helped, too.) Aside from the opening pair of sketches\u2014the first a spotlight for Chance\u2019s now-recurring character, the embattled sports announcer Lazlo Holmes, and the second about a courtroom presided over by Chance\u2019s impatient Judge Barry\u2014nearly every subsequent sketch involved a dose of gallows humor. A digital short advertising after-school snacks had a bloody twist. A Halloween-themed sketch in which ghosts recounted their deaths featured Chance as a spirit who died because of a literally shocking fetish. A trailer for a film called Space Mistakes poked fun at how easily people perish in movies about astronauts.\n\nBut if the nutty energy heightened the absurdity of most of the sketches, it also unfortunately helped to cover up some off-color jokes. The Judge Barry sketch saw Chance\u2019s character deem a male exotic dancer\u2014Yang in a long wig and a crop top\u2014immediately guilty before asking for a case involving \u201cnormal people.\u201d Chance\u2019s amused reaction to Yang\u2019s outfit drew more audience laughs, and then the actor Jason Momoa dropped in and flubbed a line in an admittedly funny way (\u201ccertified paraplegic\u2014legal\u201d), so the moment passed. Later, during a \u201cWeekend Update\u201d segment, Michael Che clumsily compared Kanye West\u2019s changing style to Caitlyn Jenner\u2019s transition. The audience groaned, and Che\u2019s co-host, Colin Jost, barely tried to save it, but the next several sketches worked to distract from the misstep.", "description": "The musician was an endearingly goofy performer who shone in a fever dream of an episode filled with gallows humor and character breaking.", "authors": ["Shirley Li"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/NUP_188933_0068/facebook.jpg?1572186308", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
