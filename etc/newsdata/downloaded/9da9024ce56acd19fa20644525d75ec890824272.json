Student loans and credit card debt loom over many younger generations, which is why some millennials are withdrawing their retirement savings in order to accomplish what they consider to be their dreams of owning a home or paying down their debt.\n\nIn general, more than one-third of millennials (36%) found it acceptable to withdraw from their retirement savings, versus only 26% of Gen Xers finding that to be an appropriate action. Not surprisingly, only 17% of baby boomers felt withdrawing from their retirement savings to be acceptable.\n\nWithdrawing your retirement funds before the appropriate age to do so will inevitably result in financial penalties, including fees and taxes.\n\nMaximizing employer matches\n\nWhile 80% of those surveyed contribute the proper amount to their employer-sponsored savings plan, 20% admitted they don't maximize the opportunity given to them by contributing enough money to earn employer-sponsored matches. Losing out on the \"free money\" your company gives you in their match program is a critical financial mistake.\n\nExperts find it's crucial to save early and save often in a person's career in order to ensure retirement is financially achievable. Let's say your employer matches 100% of your contribution up to 3% of your salary and matches 50% of your contribution up to 5% of your salary, maximizing that contribution can make or break someone's retirement savings.\n\nUsing numbers to better understand these percentages, if you make $3,000 per paycheck and you contribute 10% of your salary to your 401(k), then $300 of your own money is put into your 401(k) and your employer would deposit an additional $120 per paycheck to your 401(k). This means if you don't maximize how much your employer is willing to match, you are missing out on an additional 4% of so-called \"free money\" if you don't contribute at least 5% of your salary to your 401(k).\n\nThis survey also showed other retirement savings mistakes, including 35% saying they aren't saving enough for retirement. Financial experts reiterate it's crucial to contribute to your retirement plan as soon as possible, as a smaller amount invested earlier will compound to a larger amount later.\n\nAnd when changing jobs, instead of rolling over their retirement savings plan from one company to another, nearly one-third of people surveyed said they withdrew the balance.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "People are withdrawing money from their retirement accounts to pay off debt or make a down payment of a home, which is often considered a financial mistake, according to a recent survey.", "authors": ["Blair Shiff"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/02/0/0/b7a437ca-401k-cash-in-envelope-and-calculato-15131aeb5f66b510VgnVCM200000d6c1a8c0____.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
