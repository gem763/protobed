Her publishers assigned her a security detail for a week.\n\nHer books portray a polychromatic world perpetually in motion, with characters\u2019 traits intermingled and language that is both precise and poetic.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a clear biography of my own that I could recount in an interesting way. I\u2019m made up of the characters that I pulled out of my head, that I invented,\u201d Tokarczuk said in an interview with The Polish Book Institute.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m made up of all of them. I have a huge, multi-frame biography.\u201d\n\nTokarczuk has written more than a dozen books and won numerous honours, including Britain\u2019s Man Booker International Prize last year and Poland\u2019s most prestigious Nike Literary Award \u2014 twice.\n\nHer books have been turned into plays and films and translated into more than 25 languages, including Catalan, Hindi and Japanese.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Mystic\u2019 \u2013\n\nBorn on January 29, 1962, in the western town of Sulechow, Tokarczuk studied psychology at the University of Warsaw.\n\nShe worked as a therapist for a few years in the western city of Walbrzych and published a collection of poems before taking a stab at prose.\n\nFollowing the success of her early books, she turned to writing full time and settled in the Sudety mountains near the Czech border.\n\nThe mother of one is an animal lover with a keen interest in astrology and psychoanalyst Carl Jung.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a mystic in constant search of the truth, a truth that can only be perceived on the move, by transcending borders,\u201d said Kinga Dunin, a friend and fellow writer.\n\n\u201cAll set forms, institutions and language are death,\u201d Dunin told AFP.\n\n\u2013 Spanning borders \u2013\n\nTokarczuk\u2019s first novel, \u201cThe Journey of the People of the Book,\u201d released in 1993, chronicles a failed expedition to find a mysterious book.\n\nShe won the Booker International Prize along with her translator Jennifer Croft for her 2007 novel \u201cFlights\u201d, whose English version came out in 2017.\n\nThe book was praised for its \u201cseries of startling juxtapositions (as Tokarczuk) flies us through a galaxy of departures and arrivals, stories and digressions, all the while exploring matters close to the contemporary and human predicament\u201d.\n\nHer 900-page \u201cThe Books of Jacob\u201d spans seven countries, three religions and five languages, tracing the little-known history of Frankism, a Jewish messianic sect that sprang up in Poland in the 18th century.\n\nReleased in 2014, its pages are numbered in reverse in the style of Hebrew books.\n\nIt became both an award-winning bestseller and the target of harsh criticism from nationalist circles in Poland.\n\nTokarczuk also co-wrote the screenplay for the Polish crime film \u201cSpoor\u201d, which won the Alfred Bauer Prize for a work of particular innovation at the Berlin film festival in 2017.\n\n\u201cSpoor\u201d was also selected as Poland\u2019s entry for the best foreign language film at the 2018 Oscars.\n\nWhen not travelling, Tokarczuk divides her time between an apartment in Poland\u2019s western city of Wroclaw and her mountain home.", "description": "Warsaw (AFP) \u2013 Olga Tokarczuk, considered the most talented Polish novelist of her generation, has a string of bestsellers to her name and a style", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/10/346524_tokarczuk-has-written-dozen-books-won-numerous-honours-poland-olga-tokarczuk-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
