He died two days later in hospital from his burns.\n\nMs McAllister said she had ordered a disciplinary inquiry into why the officer on duty took so long to respond in an apparent breach of rules that require staff to attend within five minutes of a bell being rung.\n\nShe cited the case as evidence that psychoactive substances continued to be a \u201cserious problem\u201d in jails with most prison governors telling her they were struggling to deal with the surge in Spice and psychoactive substances. There were up to 60 drug-related deaths in jails last year.", "description": "The Spice epidemic is so bad in jails that an inmate died after accidentally setting himself on fire while high on psychoactive drugs, the new prisons and probation ombudsman has revealed in her first annual report.", "authors": ["Charles Hymas", "Con Coughlin", "Benedict Spence", "Charlotte Gill"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/10/TELEMMGLPICT000135061055-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqnxsVzbFt55yT5iapkHrLYV5yFgybF8Lp5lQn6ceV1MM.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
