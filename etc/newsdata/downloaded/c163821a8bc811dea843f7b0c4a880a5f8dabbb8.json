REUTERS/Henry Nicholls\n\nMaugham, who has been involved in successful, high profile cases that challenge the government over plans to exit the European Union, said he intended to lodge a petition to stop the government putting the Withdrawal Agreement before parliament.\n\nBritain and the EU appeared on the verge of a last-minute Brexit deal on Wednesday but Prime Minister Boris Johnson still had work to do at home to ensure his government and fractious parliament approve the plan.\n\nBritain has proposed that tariffs would apply on goods crossing from mainland Britain to Northern Ireland if they were deemed to be headed further to Ireland and the bloc\u2019s single market, in a bid to resolve the tricky Irish border issue.\n\nHowever, Maugham said he believed such a deal would contravene the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Act 2018.\n\nThe act states that \u201cit is unlawful Government to enter into arrangements under which Northern Ireland forms part of a separate customs territory to Great Britain.\u201d\n\nAsked whether any mooted Brexit deal would fall foul of the law, Maugham told Reuters by email: \u201cThat\u2019s our belief, yes.\u201d\n\nMaugham said that he hoped to lodge the petition on Thursday and for it to be heard on Friday.\n\nMaugham has challenged the government successfully on its decision to suspend parliament and on whether Britain could unilaterally change its mind about leaving the EU.\n\nHe is also involved in a case which seeks to force Johnson to comply with a law to delay Brexit beyond Oct. 31 if he fails to agree a transition deal with the EU.", "description": "A legal challenge will be brought against British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's possible Brexit deal on the grounds that it contravenes domestic tax law, lawyer Jolyon Maugham said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441580764&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F1OP", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
