The so-called \u201cinauthentic behavior\u201d targeted the US, North Africa and Latin America.\n\n\u201cIn each of these cases, the people behind this activity coordinated with one another and used fake accounts to misrepresent themselves, and that was the basis for our action,\u201d Gleicher explained.\n\nSo far, the company said it\u2019s removed 93 Facebook accounts, 17 pages and four Instagram profiles related to the violations. More than 7,000 other accounts followed the fake accounts.\n\nThe posts targeting countries in Latin America included 38 removed Facebook accounts, 6 pages, 4 groups and 10 Instagram profiles that all originated in Iran.\n\nAccording to Facebook, the Iranian-based groups would pose as locals and repurpose Iranian state media stories. The follower base of these groups: 13,500 accounts followed at least one of the pages, 4,200 people joined one of the groups and 60 thousand people followed the bogus Instagram accounts.\n\nThe activity was found as part of an internal investigation conducted by Facebook related to coordinated inauthentic behavior.\n\n\"We are making progress rooting out this abuse, but as we\u2019ve said before, it\u2019s an ongoing challenge. We\u2019re committed to continually improving to stay ahead. That means building better technology, hiring more people and working closer with law enforcement, security experts and other companies.\"\n\n- Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook\u2019s head of cybersecurity policy\n\nA smaller network of accounts on Facebook (4) and Instagram (7) originated from Iran and focused on users in the U.S. The accounts directed people to an off-platform domain that was masquerading \"as a news entity\" called BLMNews. According to Facebook, \u201cThe Page admins and account owners typically posted about political issues including topics like race relations in the US, criticism of US and Israel\u2019s policy on Iran, the Black Lives Matter movement, African-American culture and the Iranian foreign policy.\u201d\n\nThe network noted administrators of the pages paid less than $2 on ads to promote itself.\n\nFifty Instagram accounts were also deleted along with one Facebook account that originated in Russia and targeted users in the U.S.\n\n\u201cThis campaign showed some links to the Internet Research Agency (IRA) and had the hallmarks of a well-resourced operation that took consistent operational security steps to conceal their identity and location,\u201d Facebook\u2019s press release explained.\n\n\u201cThe people behind this operation often posted on both sides of political issues including topics like US elections, environmental issues, racial tensions, LGBTQ issues, political candidates, confederate ideas, conservatism and liberalism. They also maintained accounts presenting themselves as local in some swing states, and posed as either conservatives or progressives.\u201d\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nAt least 246 thousand people followed at least one of the Instagram accounts that was removed, and 60% of people following the Russia-based accounts were based in the U.S.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "The social media network announced the accounts originated in Iran and Russia and targeted a number of countries, including the U.S.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/FBDOTCOM_1280x720_Fake_Accounts.png?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
