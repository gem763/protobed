His remarks at a White House news conference created turmoil in Washington and left the president's Republican allies flummoxed and frustrated.\n\nMulvaney walked back the comments in a statement the same day. But after weeks in which the president argued that he had done nothing wrong, Mulvaney's remarks undermined the core arguments that Trump and his advisers have made against the effort to oust him from office in a House of Representatives impeachment inquiry.\n\nMulvaney said on Sunday that he did not offer to resign over the episode, nor was his possible resignation discussed at the White House.\n\n\"Absolutely, positively not,\" he told Fox News Sunday. \"I'm very happy working there. Did I have the perfect press conference, no, but again the facts are on our side ... I still think I'm doing a pretty good job as the chief of staff and I think the president agrees.\"\n\nTrump, a Republican who is seeking re-election in 2020, has said the aid to Kiev was frozen because he believed European countries should also contribute. Mulvaney said on Sunday the European aid had been a concern along with corruption in Ukraine, and noted that the \"aid flowed\" eventually.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Sunday supported Mulvaney's walk-back of his remarks, saying he had not seen evidence of a connection between withholding Ukraine aid and Kiev pursuing a political investigation.\n\n\"I never saw that in the decision-making process that I was a part of .... the conversation was always around what were the strategic implications, would that money get to the right place or would there be corruption in Ukraine and the money wouldn't flow to the mission that it was intended for,\" Pompeo said on ABC's \"This Week.\"\n\nThe original Mulvaney remarks produced anxiety among some Republicans, including Senator Lisa Murkowski, who told reporters foreign aid should not be held up for a political initiative, and Representative Francis Rooney, who told CNN he could not rule out that such linkage would be an impeachable offense.\n\nMulvaney told Fox News Sunday it was \"just absurd\" to think that the episode, as well as Republican resistance to Trump's plan to pull U.S. troops from Syria, made it more likely the Republican-led Senate would vote to convict Trump on impeachment charges if they are filed by the Democratic-led House.\n\nMulvaney said Trump was still \"extraordinarily popular back home\" and Republican lawmakers would respond to that.\n\nDemocrats continued to focus on the Ukraine \"quid pro quo\" issue.\n\n\"Republicans face a simple question: is the president allowed to pressure a foreign country into interfering in our elections? History will remember their answer, or their silence,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wrote on Twitter.
