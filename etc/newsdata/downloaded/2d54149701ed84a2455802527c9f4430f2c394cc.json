In the wake of that landslide, Nixon demanded and accepted resignations at the White House and throughout the administration. The president planned a thorough reorganization of the federal government.\n\nTim Naftali: Ronald Reagan\u2019s long-hidden racist conversation with Richard Nixon\n\nOn the Hill, Senator Mike Mansfield and his Democratic colleagues were not prepared to let the Watergate burglary and the \u201cdirty tricks\u201d of the 1972 campaign slide, despite Nixon\u2019s formidable popularity. Mansfield obtained unanimous agreement to impanel a small investigative committee chaired by the respected Senator Sam Ervin.\n\nAt its inception in February 1973, the Senate Watergate Committee had only a June 1972 burglary and the well-publicized \u201cdirty tricks\u201d to investigate. However, soon after the committee\u2019s creation, evidence began to emerge of a White House\u2013orchestrated cover-up of the Watergate burglary.\n\nAs evidence implicating the White House mounted, the administration displayed no inclination toward negotiation or accommodation with the Senate Watergate Committee. On March 15, 1973, Nixon issued an edict asserting executive privilege, declaring that White House aides and papers were entirely off limits to the committee. If the committee desired to press the issue, the president said, it could pursue a contempt prosecution through the courts.\n\nPressed for his reaction, Ervin said Nixon\u2019s position was \u201cexecutive poppycock, akin to the divine right of kings.\u201d Ervin declared that his committee had no intention of submitting to the suggested judicial delays, but would instead utilize the Senate\u2019s sergeant at arms to arrest any recalcitrant White House aide, bring him to the bar of the Senate for trial, and ultimately compel him to testify.\n\nAs damaging revelations continued to mount and the stigma of cover-up gathered strength, the White House floated trial balloons, offering the Watergate Committee possible closed-door interviews with White House aides. Ervin continued to insist on public testimony, saying that \u201cWhite House aides are not royalty or nobility who can be excused from testifying under oath and in public.\u201d\n\nBy mid-April 1973, Nixon\u2019s resistance to testimony by White House aides had collapsed, and a number of them testified. This testimony disclosed the White House taping system and confirmed the existence of tapes. Those disclosures ultimately led to Nixon\u2019s departure from office.\n\nDavid Frum: The question posed by Trump\u2019s phone call\n\nThis performance of the Senate Watergate Committee stands as one example of effective congressional oversight. There have been others. The one essential ingredient has been the testimony, at public hearings, compelled if necessary, of witnesses able to give a firsthand account of matters of national importance. Televised hearings have proved to be the one effective way to focus the nation\u2019s attention on questions of crucial significance.", "description": "When I worked in the Nixon White House, I learned what it takes for Congress to exercise effective oversight.", "authors": ["Jonathan C.
