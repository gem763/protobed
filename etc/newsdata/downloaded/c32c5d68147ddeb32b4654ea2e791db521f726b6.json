You see it in the actions of Northern Ireland's conservative Democratic Unionist Party and the leftist Scottish National Party, whose existential mandates logically require them to be beholden to both political ideology and their respective parts of the U.K.\n\nFran Burwell, who advises global companies on Brexit as a senior adviser at McLarty Associates, tells Axios she fears \u201cthe entrenched nature of the factions could lead them to stumble into \u2018no deal.\u2019\u201d She puts the odds at 20\u201325%.\n\nA \u201cno deal\u201d Brexit could see GDP plunge by 10.7% over 15 years, according to a \"worst-case\" government analysis. Burwell notes that it would lead to massive transportation challenges for both people and goods, and it would see the U.K. suddenly become subject to \u201cregulations, permits and licenses that no one has dealt with since 1974.\u201d\n\nWhile the 27 member states will \u201ctry to limit damages\u201d for trading partners like Ireland and the Netherlands, Burwell says, any accommodations will be \u201ctemporary and done to benefit the EU.\u201d\n\nHer take: \u201cI\u2019m starting to come to the conclusion that the only way forward is a significant extension that would then allow the future relationship [between the U.K. and EU after Brexit] to be negotiated in a serious way for the next year, maybe longer. Because none of it is resolved.\u201d\n\nThe big picture: As Burwell acknowledges, considerable wrangling will be needed in Westminster and in Brussels to get such an extension, and there\u2019s no guarantee even a year of negotiations could solve the \u201cIrish backstop\u201d dilemma.\n\nI found a sidewalk debate between two older gentlemen in Wales \u2014 one \"Leave\" voter and one \"remain\" voter \u2014 more elucidating than anything coming out of Westminster. Here\u2019s how it ends:\n\n\"Why are you afraid of a no deal? What you've got to remember is this country fought a world war. We raised from the ashes. The fear project that they've got, don't worry about it. Britain has got the technology, the ability and the people to rebuild. We don't need Europe.\"\n\nWhat's next: May will present her \"plan B\" to Parliament on Monday. Members will attempt to add amendments and might try to get the government to rule out \"no deal\" (Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says he won't negotiate until that condition is met). That plan will come up for a vote on Jan. 29.\n\nGo deeper: The pros and cons of a second referendum", "description": "Bitter rifts between and within the U.K.'s major political parties have made consensus elusive.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/PTvTNjS9d6KA569IH8Hy5u46dWM=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/01/17/1547769542585.gif", "published_at": "2019-01-18"}
