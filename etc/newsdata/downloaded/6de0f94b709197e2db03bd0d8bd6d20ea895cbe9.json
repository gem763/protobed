Wait a minute. We know where he\u2019s going. He\u2019s going to the Lakers.\n\nHe\u2019s going to the Lakers. He\u2019s going to the Lakers. I\u2019ve had four different players tell me. Every player I talk to tells me that.\n\nIguodala remains on the Grizzlies\u2019 roster as they seek a trade. Maybe they\u2019ll find one. Maybe they won\u2019t. Iguodala\u2019s $17,185,185 salary certainly makes a trade more complicated.\n\nBut the longer Memphis waits, the more circumstances change.\n\nIguodala might be favoring the Lakers right now. That\u2019s important information.\n\nIt isn\u2019t everything, though. The Lakers are still trying to find themselves. Who knows where they\u2019ll be when Iguodala becomes a free agent? Maybe they won\u2019t appeal as much to him.\n\nAnd that\u2019s if Iguodala becomes a free agent this season.
