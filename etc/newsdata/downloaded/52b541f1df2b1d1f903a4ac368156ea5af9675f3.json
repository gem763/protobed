James had been the quickest to accomplish the feat, doing so on 755 carries. However, Walker accomplished the feat in just 33 games, running for 5,259 yards on 994 carries. Saturday marked Taylor's 34th game.\n\n-- Field Level Media", "description": "Wisconsin RB Taylor joins exclusive club vs. Illinois", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9I0IO_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
