Looking around, and all over this large, magnificent planet, the truth is plain to see. If you want freedom, take pride in your country. If you want democracy, hold on to your sovereignty. And if you want peace, love your nation.\u201d\n\nAfter nodding at right-wing fears that Western culture is being replaced by immigrants from non-European countries, the president picked up on another overarching theme of nationalism: Anger toward globalism.\n\n\u201cThe future does not belong to globalists. The future belongs to patriots,\u201d he stated. \u201cThe future belongs to sovereign and independent nations, who protect their citizens, respect their neighbors and honor the differences that make each country special and unique.\u201d\n\nBefore ending his speech, which saw him rather languid and low-energy as he read from a teleprompter, the president also brought up the Second Amendment while saying he will \u201cnever ratify the UN arms treaty.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe United States will uphold the right to keep and bear arms. We will uphold our Second Amendment,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe core rights and values that America defends today were inscribed in America\u2019s founding documents.\u201d", "description": "\u201cThe future does not belong to globalists.
