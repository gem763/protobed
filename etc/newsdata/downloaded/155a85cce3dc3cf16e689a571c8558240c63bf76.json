Smuggling drugs and people to \u201cel otro lado,\u201d the other side, has been his life\u2019s work.\n\nThere\u2019s always a way, he says, no matter how hard U.S. President Donald Trump tries to stop the flow. But this year\u2019s crackdown has made it a tougher proposition. A deadlier one, too\u2014especially for women and children, who are increasingly dying in the attempt.\n\nNot much surprises Roberto, who asks not to be identified by his surname because he engages in illegal activity. Sitting on a creaky metal chair, shaded by quince trees and speaking above the din from a gaggle of fighting roosters, the 65-year-old grabs a twig and scratches lines in the sand to show how he stays a step ahead of U.S. and Mexican security forces.\n\nHere\u2019s a gap in the fence that migrants can dash through\u2014onto land owned by American ranchers in his pay. There\u2019s a spot U.S. patrols often pass, so he\u2019s hiring more people to keep watch and cover any footprints with leaf-blowers.\n\nRoberto says he was taken aback in July this year, when he was approached for the first time by parents with young children. For coyotes, as the people-smugglers are known in Mexico, that wasn\u2019t the typical customer profile. Roberto asked around among his peers. \u201cThey were also receiving a lot of families,\u201d he says. \u201cMany, many families are crossing over.\u201d\n\nThat helps explain one of the grimmer statistics to emerge from all the turmoil on the U.S.-Mexican border.\n\nEven more than usual, the 2,000-mile frontier has turned into a kind of tectonic fault line this year. Poverty and violence\u2014and the pull of the world\u2019s richest economy\u2014are driving people north. At the border, they\u2019re met by a new regime of tightened security and laws, imposed by Trump in tandem with his Mexican counterpart, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, also known as AMLO.\n\nSome give up and go home; some wait and hope\u2014and some try evermore dangerous ways to get through.\n\nNineteen children died during attempted crossings in the first nine months of 2019, by drowning, dehydration or illness, according to the UN\u2019s \u201cMissing Migrants\u201d research project. That\u2019s up from four reported through September 2018 and by far the most since the project began gathering data in 2014, when two died that entire year. Women are dying in greater numbers, too\u201444 in the year through September, versus 14 last year.\n\nMany of those families are fleeing crime epidemics in Central America, as well as economic shocks. Prices of coffee\u2014a key export\u2014in the region plunged this year to the lowest in more than a decade, crushing farmers.\n\nMaking matters worse, climate change will produce more frequent crop failures for those growers that will, in turn, drive more migration, said Eleanor Paynter, a fellow at Ohio State University. \u201cAsylum law does not currently recognize climate refugees,\u201d she said, \u201cbut in the coming years we will see more and more.\u201d\n\nThe demand side is equally fluid. When the Great Recession hit in 2007, a slumping U.S. economy led to a sharp drop in arrivals from Mexico and Central America. Today, the reverse is true: Record-low unemployment in the U.S. is attracting huge numbers from Central America.\n\nBut none of those factors fully explains why so many families are now willing to take such great risks. To understand that, it\u2019s necessary to go back to the birth of the \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy in January, when new U.S. rules made it much harder to seek asylum on arrival\u2014and its escalation in June, when Trump threatened to slap tariffs on Mexican goods, and AMLO agreed to deploy 26,000 National Guard troops to the border.\n\nThe crackdown was aimed at Central Americans\u2014mostly from such poor, violent countries as El Salvador and Honduras\u2014who\u2019d been entering the U.S. through Mexico in growing numbers. Many would cross the border, turn themselves in and apply for asylum, then wait in the U.S. for a court hearing. That route was especially favored by migrants with young children, who were likely to be released from detention faster.\n\nUnder the new policy, they were sent back to Mexico by the tens of thousands and required to wait in dangerous border towns for a court date. They might wait in shelters for months for their number to be called, with only 10 or 20 families being interviewed each day. Word was getting back that applications weren\u2019t being approved, anyway.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Roberto the coyote can see a stretch of border fence from his ranch in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, about a mile south of El Paso.
