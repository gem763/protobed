Writing in the Philadelphia Freeman\u2019s Journal on Sept. 26, 1787, Founding Father George Turner urged his fellow citizens to make energetic use of the new Constitution\u2019s flexibility:\n\n\u201cIn framing a government,\u201d Turner wrote, \u201cwe should consider a century to come as but a day, and leave the least possible for posterity to mend. Errors sanctified by long usage are not easily relinquished.\u201d\n\nPosterity found plenty of errors to mend. We tossed aside some paragraphs and added others 11 times in the late 1700s, four times in the 1800s, and 11 more times in the 20th century. That constant stream of edits averages out to one amendment every eight and a half years. The Constitution may be a hallowed part of American history, but the red ink strewn across its clauses tells us this great experiment is still a work in progress.", "description": "The failure of the ERA in the 1980s made Democrats and liberals gun-shy about constitutional reform.
