I like to say that we\u2019re like Thelma and Louise. We\u2019re driving straight toward the canyon at 90 miles per hour with the radio cranked up and the top down.\u201d\n\nThe couple then said that they focus on studying food consumption\u2019s effect on the environment since other areas are better understood.\n\n\u201cWe tried to find something that was less well understood and was a major lever that could effect change,\u201d Mr. Cameron said. \u201cFood is a good one. It\u2019s probably the second-biggest one. Well ahead is transportation. We all drive around in our Teslas and our Priuses and think we are doing a great job, but really we\u2019re all assuaging our liberal guilt. The real solution is: change the way you live.\u201d\n\nMrs. Amis Cameron said that businesses like Verdient Foods, which the pair invested in, are leading the way by aiming for vertical integration.\n\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s not a trend \u2014 it\u2019s actually the way the world is going,\u201d she said, Variety reported. \u201c[Buy electric and hybrid vehicles], but if you\u2019re driving to McDonald\u2019s? You\u2019re not helping.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
