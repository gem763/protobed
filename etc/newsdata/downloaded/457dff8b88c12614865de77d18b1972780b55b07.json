If we get it right, we can help the internet fulfil its potential as an engine for global economic progress.\u201d\n\nStripe, which says its mission is to expand the GDP of the internet, has grown primarily as a platform that integrates electronic payments and secure transactions.\n\nBut it is rapidly expanding into the world of finance.\n\nThis month alone, Stripe has launched two new products: Stripe Capital, which offers near-instant loans to its customers, and Stripe Corporate Card, a Visa credit card available to US businesses.\n\nStripe also recently launched in eight countries, including Estonia, Greece, and Portugal.\n\nIt said it would be expanding further in the coming months, bringing the total to 40 countries \u2014 or 70% of the global economy.\n\nStripe raised $100m from hedge fund group Tiger Global Management as recently as January, an investment that valued the company at $22.5bn (\u00a318bn).\n\nThat followed a $245m series E investment \u2014 Stripe\u2019s fifth round of significant fundraising \u2014 in September 2018, which valued the company at $20bn.\n\nWhile Jack Dorsey\u2019s Square has traditionally been considered a rival of Stripe, the company\u2019s new direction puts it in direct competition with US financial giants.\n\nJPMorgan Chase (JPM), for instance, has said that it wants to increase its share of the global treasury services market in part by expanding its e-commerce functions.\n\nEarlier this year, it combined its business-to-business treasury services unit with its consumer-to-business merchant services division, hoping that a more streamlined offering could allow it to compete with the likes of Stripe and Apple Pay.", "description": "The fast-growing online payments giant becomes the most valuable private fintech company in the world.", "authors": ["Edmund Heaphy", "Finance", "News Reporter"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/40KWREWTGKl_AmT7xmRB2w--~B/aD0yMzg3O3c9MzU4MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/84cbc750-daf9-11e9-bfed-37ab3f5f4382", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
