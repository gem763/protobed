Families of those with missing children have also been calling out for help on Facebook.\n\nRelatives of Nguyen Dinh Luong, 20, shared in a post on Facebook that they fear he may be one of the victims, while numerous other families have called out for help. The family of Vo Nhan Du, 19, posted on Facebook to ask for help finding him. Du reportedly left for the UK on the same day as Luong and Pham Thi Tra My.\n\nOn Friday fears were raised that 26-year-old Pham may have been on the lorry after text messages emerged from Pham to her mother saying: \u201cI\u2019m dying because I can\u2019t breathe.\u201d Her family have heard nothing from her since.\n\nDespite photos of Pham circulating online, police are yet to confirm if she is among the dead. Pham had travelled to China before going on to Europe, and reportedly paid \u00a330,000 to reach the UK.\n\nHer texts were shared by Hoa Nghiem, the coordinator at Vietnam-based NGO Human Rights Space, who was concerned about Pham\u2019s whereabouts following contact from the girl\u2019s family. Hoa, among others, now fears many other Vietnamese people may have been in the truck.\n\n\u201cMy local contact confirmed five other families from the same district submitted a report to the police about their family members,\u201d Hoa said.\n\nOther Vietnamese people in the UK have shared their knowledge about the number of missing people and the identity of those in the lorry.\n\nIn a Facebook post shared at 1.38am GMT, Pham Van Nho, a PhD student at United World Colleges\u2019 London campus who is working with police in London to identify victims in the lorry, claimed the number of Vietnamese people in the lorry may be far higher.\n\n\u201cI now have information of 21 family members and acquaintances of people who have gone \u2018missing\u2019,\u201d he said, before adding that he would not reveal more details to the press without further information from police.\n\nIt is being reported in Vietnamese media that authorities are pressing charges against a woman from Yen Thanh district, in Nghe An province, for human trafficking.\n\nNghe An, the province where many of the potential victims are from, is one of the poorest in Vietnam and a hotspot for human trafficking, according to the human trafficking NGO Blue Dragon Children\u2019s Foundation, an organisation that rescues victims of human trafficking from China.\n\nMichael Brosowski, the organisation\u2019s chief executive, said when he \u201cfirst heard that there were 39 people who died in a truck on the way to the UK. Honestly my first thought was that this was news about Vietnam.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI do know that traffickers and smugglers use every available route to get people from Vietnam to the UK and it seems in this case that this girl and possibly others may have come from Vietnam into China, possibly legally.\n\n\u201cMost likely in this case, there are multiple trafficking rings in multiple countries, each of whom will be taking a cut from this trade. I heard she paid \u00a330,000. That money will be divided among many people. These people are professionals.\u201d\n\nHundreds of Vietnamese people are trafficked to the UK each year according to the UK-based charity Ecpat. Often, they are forced to work in slavery in nail bars or cannabis farms.\n\nIn 2000, 58 Chinese migrants died from asphyxiation in a refrigerated truck in Dover.", "description": "Hanoi asks Vietnamese embassy in London to collaborate with police to help identify victims", "authors": ["Chris Humphrey In Hanoi"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44a4d5153154b0d8ca5c2cc73ec9aaf9d3dc5a74/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3d6d6834a3ebf789ae058f3de3ebb581", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
