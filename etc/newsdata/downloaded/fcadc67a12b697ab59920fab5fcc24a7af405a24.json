Her total debt is lower than that of the Congressional average, which reportedly stands at $37,000 (\u00a330,013).\n\nThe problem is even greater outside the halls of Congress. More than 42 million Americans are burdened by student loan debt, which has amounted to a staggering total of $1.5tn (\u00a31.23tn) nationwide. It takes most students anywhere from 10 to 30 years to finish paying off their debt, and the national average per person stands at $31,172 (\u00a325,292).\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
