He must be impeached. pic.twitter.com/JCjTbaQI8w \u2014 Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) September 25, 2019\n\nThis \"transcript\" itself is a smoking gun. If this is the version of events the president's team thinks is most favorable, he is in very deep jeopardy. We need to see the full whistleblower complaint and the administration needs to follow the law. Now. https://t.co/b56nLZZpRi \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) September 25, 2019\n\nThis confirms what we already knew: President Trump asked a foreign power to investigate a political rival. He\u2019s unfit for office and needs to be impeached. https://t.co/2px07X8N7K \u2014 Beto O'Rourke (@BetoORourke) September 25, 2019\n\nDonald Trump is the most corrupt president in the modern history of this country. \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 25, 2019\n\nThis is how an incompetent mobster does business. https://t.co/KXXLLOUGwG \u2014 Steve Bullock (@GovernorBullock) September 25, 2019\n\nThis is the smoking gun.\n\n\n\nDonald Trump pressured a foreign government to work with his Justice Department to investigate a political opponent.\n\n\n\nCongress should cancel recess and begin impeachment proceedings immediately. #TrumpImpeachment pic.twitter.com/yUC0fJW40l \u2014 Juli\u00e1n Castro (@JulianCastro) September 25, 2019\n\nThis is damning. Trump is a mob boss.\n\n\n\nBut the Administration is not off the hook, Congress needs the full whistleblower complaint. https://t.co/tsPohgDqi7 \u2014 Congressman Tim Ryan (@RepTimRyan) September 25, 2019\n\nThere it is. He did it. Donald Trump is a traitor. https://t.co/KcJrK0eQLy \u2014 Tom Steyer (@TomSteyer) September 25, 2019\n\nWe said he\u2019s been corrupting the office since the beginning. Today the White House agreed. \u2014 Cory Booker (@CoryBooker) September 25, 2019\n\nGenerally speaking you should only ask someone to do something you would do yourself. \u2014 Andrew Yang (@AndrewYang) September 25, 2019\n\nAfter the transcript's release, Trump said Democrats should be the ones to apologize, arguing that the call was \"perfect\" and that he \"got them by surprise.\"\n\nWill the Democrats apologize after seeing what was said on the call with the Ukrainian President? They should, a perfect call - got them by surprise! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 25, 2019\n\nAs many have pointed out, the transcript does not prove what Democrats had claimed it would.\n\nThe transcript shows that Trump mentioned Biden and his son only once, and that there was zero discussion whatsoever of connecting financial aid to an investigation of Hunter Biden\u2019s controversial Ukrainian energy business or the prosecutor who was fired while investigating it. \u2014 Sean Davis (@seanmdav) September 25, 2019\n\nThe transcript also shows that Zelensky told Trump that Zelensky wanted Giuliani to travel to Ukraine to meet with Zelensky.\n\n\n\nThe reality of this phone call is the exact opposite of what Democrats and their media allies have been claiming without evidence for the last week. \u2014 Sean Davis (@seanmdav) September 25, 2019", "description": ".09/25/2019 19:24:58PM EST.", "authors": ["Leah Barkoukis", "Matt Vespa", "Cortney O'Brien", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/255/587e93a3-a028-400f-bbc0-d33887cfe1ad.png", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
