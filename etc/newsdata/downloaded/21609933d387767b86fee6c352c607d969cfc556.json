In December, she pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to act as a foreign agent for Russia by infiltrating a gun rights group and influencing US conservative activists and Republicans.\n\nShe was sentenced to 18 months in prison, half of which was credited as already served. She was held at Florida's Tallahassee prison.\n\n'Outrage'\n\nHer case further strained the US-Russian relations, prompting Moscow to accuse Washington of forcing the graduate student, to confess to what it described as ridiculous charges.\n\n\"I am very happy to be home. I am very grateful to everybody who supported me, to the Russian citizens who helped me and wrote letters,\" Butina said on Saturday.\n\n\"Many thanks to the foreign ministry and to the diplomats who daily fought my corner,\" she added, as her father and foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova escorted her through arrivals.\n\nIn an interview with state media during her flight home, Butina insisted on her innocence and called for action over the \"outrage that happened to me\".\n\nZakharova said Butina was the victim of entrenched anti-Russian attitudes.\n\nSince the election of President Donald Trump, Russian officials have consistently blamed troubled relations on so-called \"Russophobia\" carried over from the administration of President Barack Obama.\n\nThe Russian foreign ministry had made her into a cause celebre, placing a picture of her with the word \"Free Butina\" at the top of its social media pages.\n\nThe Butina case captivated public attention in the US because it unfolded around the same time as special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Moscow's interference in the 2016 US election, even though the two probes were entirely separate.\n\nIt also led to scrutiny of the political dealings of the powerful NRA.\n\nHer lawyers said on Friday that she was not a spy and that the case had nothing to do with espionage or election interference. They cast the crime as more technical than substantive.", "description": "Woman convicted of being a covert Russian agent returns home after her deportation from the US.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/26/3cf280e0ee2b42e0b9deff718bae1f6c_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
