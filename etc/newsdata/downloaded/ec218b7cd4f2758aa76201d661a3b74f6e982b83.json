If approved, the ban will come into effect from March 2021.\n\nAs well as banning diesels, the city would introduce a vehicle scrappage scheme to help motorists replace their diesel cars with petrol or hybrid and electric ones. Bristol mayor Marvin Rees said the proposed \u2018clean air zone\u2019 would help the city meet its emissions targets and \u2018protect vulnerable residents\u2019 from pollution.\n\nBristol could ban privately owned diesels from the city centre between 7am and 3pm to tackle air pollution\n\nMotoring groups warned of \u2018unintended consequences\u2019.\n\nThe AA said: \u2018Diesel is the fuel used not only by ambulances, fire engines and buses but also essential services such as breakdown rescue, firms that make urgent deliveries such as to pharmacies, that unblock drains, plumbers and others that residents depend on.\u2019\n\nThe council\u2019s cabinet is being asked to approve the proposals at a meeting on November 5.\n\nIf the plan is passed, the council will develop the scheme with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Department for Transport.\n\nMillions were encouraged to buy diesels by Tony Blair\u2019s government because they are more fuel-efficient and emit less carbon dioxide.\n\nAs well as banning diesels, the city would introduce a vehicle scrappage scheme to help motorists replace their diesel cars with petrol or hybrid and electric ones\n\nBut scientists and governments around the world have since changed their tune as diesels emit more nitrogen oxides, which can harm health.\n\nThe Volkswagen diesel emissions scandal in 2015 has also led to accusations that car-makers have been cheating tests and downplaying the damaging effects of toxic emissions.\n\nData published by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders shows that during the first nine months of the year diesels held just 25.8 per cent of the new car market - compared with 31.7 per cent during the same period in 2018.\n\nThis is due to increases in the proportion of motorists buying petrol and alternatively-fuelled vehicles such as hybrids and battery electrics.\n\nBristol is the sixth biggest city in the UK with a population of around 617,000 people.", "description": "The move would see privately owned diesels barred from the city centre between 7am and 3pm.
