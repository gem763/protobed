My health has suffered - I've got back ache, and then there's the stress.'\n\nJohn Hopkinson, 70, lost one of the largest lumps of money - \u00a3180,000- when Portuguese-based Premier FX ceased trading\n\nMr Hopkinson's (left) money vanished when Premier FX suddenly collapsed following the death of its owner Peter Rextrew (right) after he had heart surgery\n\nHe said that he briefly looked for a job but had to stop as he realised he was to old to go back to full-time work.\n\nIn January 2007, Mr Hopkinson and his wife moved to Lagos, Portugal, where they bought a house.\n\nBut the house was too big and they decided to sell the property, storing the money with Premier FX and renting a smaller place in the country.\n\nIn April 2015, the couple moved back to Yorkshire and Mr Hopkinson was looking forward to a comfortable retirement.\n\nYet in the summer of last year, Premier FX, a longtime sponsor of Channel 4's A Place In The Sun, folded when its owner Peter Rextrew suddenly died following heart surgery.\n\nPauline Creasey (right), who lost nearly half a million pounds in Premier FX's collapse and is spearheading the victims' - such as Mr Hopkinson (left) - campaign to unearth the facts\n\nWhen Mr Hopkinson tried to claw his \u00a3180,000 back, his attempts to communicate with the company were stonewalled before he was eventually told that millions of the firm's holdings were missing.\n\nMr Hopkinson, who relied on his Premier FX-held money, has had to rip up his retirement plans and scrape by on a modest pension.\n\nHe said: 'We've had to cancel the home we were going to buy together and move in to my wife's cottage. If we didn't have that option, I'd be on the streets.\n\n'I've had to put my whole life on hold. We should be going out for meals and things like that, but we just can't do it.'\n\nConfiding that money worries have caused 'depression', Mr Hopkinson said that he has to watch every penny and regularly sacrifices indoor heating to 'keep the bills down'.\n\nDescribing the moment he found out that Premier FX had gone into administration, he said: 'It's like that feeling you get when you know something really bad is going to happen, you feel sick.'\n\nThe mother, 63, from Dover, Kent, said she was left 'gutted and ruined' when her \u00a3489,000 went missing following the currency firm's collapse\n\nThe Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), who allowed Premier FX to make transfers in Britain, has launched an investigation into the missing \u00a310.6million.\n\nAndrew Bailey, the FCA chief executive, vowed to trace the funds and told a parliamentary committee that his teams have trawled through thousands of transactions in a desperate attempt to find it.\n\nBut Pauline Creasey, who lost nearly half a million pounds in Premier FX's collapse and is spearheading the victims' campaign to unearth the facts, told MailOnline the finance watchdog is 'dragging its feet' with the investigation.\n\nThe mother, 63, from Dover, Kent, said she was left 'gutted and ruined' when her \u00a3489,000 went missing following the currency firm's collapse.\n\nShe had planned to use the money to move to Florida for an easy life, but is now scouting around for work as her bank balance begins to dwindle.\n\nPremier FX was a long time sponsor of Channel 4's A Place In The Sun\n\nIf I don't get the money back and I don't get compensation, and if I don't find decent work - I'm now 63, it's not easy...\n\nMs Creasey told MailOnline: 'My plan had been to go to Florida and not work so hard, but now having to go back to working flat out it just not amenable either from a health point of view or I might just not be able to get the work.\n\n'The world of work is a tough environment, and I'll try and make it work, but if not we're in a bad situation.'\n\nAn FCA spokesperson said: 'We continue to investigate the business undertaken by Premier FX to determine whether any individuals may have broken the law and thereby damaged customers of the firm.\n\n'There is no basis to the claim we are dragging out the investigation. The investigation remains fully resourced and is making good progress.'", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: John Hopkinson, 70, lost one of the largest lumps of money when Portuguese-based Premier FX ceased trading - with almost \u00a311million of customers' funds vanishing.", "authors": ["Jack Elsom For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/11/20125636-0-image-a-23_1571913210658.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
