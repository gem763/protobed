According to the Diplomat, \u201cVideo footage carried in Chinese state media showed at least 22 integrated six-axle DF-26 transporter-erector-launchers along with their crews.\u201d What do we know about this missile?\n\nFirst, the basics. The Center for Strategic and International Studies\u2019 Missile Threat Project notes that the DF-26 is a road-mobile, two-stage solid-fueled IRBM. The Missie Threat Project cites Chinese sources as saying that the \u201cmissile measures 14 m in length, 1.4 m in diameter, and has a launch weight of 20,000 kg.\u201d Notably, the DF-26 is believed to have a range between three and four thousand kilometers. This means it can hold Guam\u2014a major hub of U.S. military operations in the western Pacific\u2014at risk. In fact, as the Missile Threat Project points out, this is China\u2019s first conventionally armed ballistic missile capable of threatening Guam.\n\nChina first unveiled the DF-26 during a military parade in September 2015. The missile subsequently participated in a massive strike simulation last year as part of a larger barrage of missiles. The Diplomat reported, citing an unnamed U.S. government source, that the People\u2019s Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF) shot off \u201cfour DF-26C intermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBM), ten DF-16A medium-range ballistic missiles, and six CJ-10 land attack cruise missiles in the live fire portion of the exercise.\u201d The drill was a simulation of attacks on U.S. missile-defense systems as well as aircraft on the ground.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "Will Beijing's strategy work?", "authors": ["Zachary Keck"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/JEGhNj4tMh0fEC7l03lIGw--~B/aD04NzQ7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/5cd7823f6a52dadcd75971062dea1ace", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
