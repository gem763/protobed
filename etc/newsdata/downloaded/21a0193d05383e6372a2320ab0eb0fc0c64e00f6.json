He is also a wily commander who leads a ragtag band of protesters willing to risk injury and arrest as they face off against the police.\n\nFat Boy oversees 50 or so Hong Kong protesters, ages 15 to 35, who focus their attacks on the police, government offices and Chinese-owned banks or other businesses they view as hostile to their movement. Their weapons \u2014 bricks, poles and Molotov cocktails \u2014 are often met with tear gas and rubber bullets. Occasionally, the police have responded with live fire.\n\nThey are part of a core of combative young agitators, garbed in black, who have come to define the antigovernment protests that have convulsed this semiautonomous territory for more than four months and that have posed a bold challenge to the authority of China\u2019s ruling Communist Party.", "description": "Hard-line demonstrators and the embattled authorities are locked in an impasse.", "authors": ["Andrew Jacobs", "Tiffany May", "Lam Yik Fei", "Photographs By"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/25/world/hk-frontline-promo/hk-frontline-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
