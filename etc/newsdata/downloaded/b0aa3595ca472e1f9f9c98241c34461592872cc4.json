Mary Robinette Kowal\u2019s The Calculating Stars (the first in her Lady Astronaut series) won Best Novel; Artificial Condition by Martha Wells took home Best Novella; If At First You Don\u2019t Succeed, Try, Try Again by Zen Cho won Best Novelette; and A Witch\u2019s Guide to Escape: A Practical Compendium of Portal Fantasies by Alix E. Harrow won Best Short Story. Best Series went to Becky Chambers\u2019 Wayfarers books.\n\nAlso notable was the win for Best Related Work by popular fan fiction site Archive of Our Own, which has broken ground for providing a space for fans to share and read fanfic online. While it wasn\u2019t the first fan fiction community on the internet, it did provide a safe place for authors to write without the limitations that other platforms like LiveJournal or FanFiction.net had put into place, particularly for more adult stories.\n\nHere\u2019s the complete list of nominees; the winners are highlighted in bold.\n\nBest Novel\n\nThe Calculating Stars by Mary Robinette Kowal\n\nRecord of a Spaceborn Few by Becky Chambers\n\nRevenant Gun by Yoon Ha Lee\n\nSpace Opera by Catherynne M.
