It\u2019s why she calls individual grassroots donors, often posting videos of the calls to social media after. It\u2019s why she engages with individual supporters online. And it\u2019s why she spends hours taking selfies after every event. Her campaign has prioritized building individual connections with specific voters, and\u2014more importantly\u2014creating tiny pieces of organic digital content that those grassroots supporters then blast to their own social media networks to express their support. On the day Roof stood in line to wait for her selfie with the Senator, Warren took her 60,000th selfie, according to the campaign.\n\n\u201cThe selfie lines are a chance for people to get in a question, talk about issues that matter to them, or pass her a note they really want her to read,\u201d says Warren spokeswoman Saloni Sharma. \u201cWe\u2019re building a grassroots movement, person to person, face to face.\u201d\u2026\n\nCandidates snapping selfies with voters is not new. But Warren has elevated an old shtick into the centerpiece of her digital strategy. The Warren selfies are designed to be widely shared, and are particularly popular among younger voters who live most of their lives on social media. In interviews with supporters who waited in line to take selfies with Warren in Iowa on Thursday and Friday, most said they planned to post it on Instagram or Facebook, and a TIME review of their social media accounts suggests that they usually posted the photo almost immediately, where it quickly gained likes and comments.", "description": "", "authors": ["Time.Com Elizabeth-Warren-Selfies"], "top_image": ""}
