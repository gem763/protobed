Tech Data shares ended trading on Tuesday at $111.34.\n\nThere is no certainty that Tech Data will engage in negotiations or that any deal will occur, the sources added, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Apollo declined to comment, while Tech Data did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nBased in Clearwater, Florida, Tech Data provides computers, mobile phones, printers, servers and other information technology infrastructure to corporate resellers, direct marketers and retailers. It has a market capitalization of $4 billion, and debt and cash on hand as of the end of July of $1.3 billion and $738 million, respectively.\n\nTech Data has lower operating margins than some of its peers, as it invests in expanding its offerings. Two years ago, it acquired Avnet Inc\u2019s technology solutions business for $2.6 billion.\n\nThe technology equipment distribution sector has attracted strong private equity interest in the last year. In January, buyout firm CVC Capital Partners acquired ConvergeOne Holdings Inc, a distributor of networking and collaboration products, for $1.8 billion.\n\nApollo has also showed interest in the sector, making an unsuccessful bid last year to acquire U.S. electronics distributor Ingram Micro Inc from HNA Group Co for up to $7.5 billion.", "description": "Private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC has approached Tech Data Corp with an offer to acquire the U.S. information technology equipment distributor for close to $5 billion, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Greg Roumeliotis", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
