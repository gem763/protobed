Below, CNBC Select takes a look at how you can maximize the rewards and perks you can earn with the best credit cards for dining as well as the added dining perks issuers provide to all cardholders, regardless of whether you have a dining rewards card.\n\nHow dining rewards credit cards work\n\nDining rewards credit cards offer bonus rewards on all your restaurant-related purchases.

This card tops our list of the best credit cards for dining out and restaurants since you can earn an estimated $135 in rewards on dining purchases each year, assuming an average $3,365 annual spend on dining out (from a sample budget created by location intelligence firm Esri). Depending on what type of rewards credit card you have \u2014 cash back, points or miles \u2014 you can redeem rewards for statement credit, gift cards, travel, merchandise and more.\n\nHow to maximize your perks and rewards\n\nDining rewards credit cards also come with various added perks that can add up to increased savings, such as annual credits, redemption bonuses and free memberships to dining services. In addition to high rewards on dining worldwide, the American Express\u00ae Gold Card offers an annual $120 dining credit ($10 a month) at Grubhub, Seamless, The Cheesecake Factory, Ruth's Chris Steak House, Boxed and participating Shake Shack locations. The Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00ae offers 3X points on dining at restaurants worldwide and you can receive 50% more value for points when you redeem your points for travel via Chase Ultimate Rewards\u00ae. That's like earning an effective 4.5X points on dining out.

The best credit cards for dining out and restaurants can earn you over $100 in rewards each year just on eating out alone. And even if you decide that you don't want a dining rewards card but want some dining-related perks, your card issuer may provide all cardholders exclusive access to dining events throughout the year, such as those mentioned above.
