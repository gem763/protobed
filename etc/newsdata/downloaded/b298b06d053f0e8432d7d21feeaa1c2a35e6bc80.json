Karem (@BrianKarem) September 3, 2019\n\nThe decision to revoke Karem's hard pass began at the beginning of August when Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham informed the Playboy reporter that a \"preliminary decision\" had been made in regards to his press access. The decision came after Karem got into a verbal altercation with Sebastian Gorka in the Rose Garden.\n\nAt the time, Karem was upset because President Donald Trump wasn't taking questions during a presser following his social media summit. He made a remark about those people being \u201cprone to demonic possession.\u201d That's when Gorka became upset.\n\nIn case you need a refresher, here's a video from the altercation:", "description": "Here we go..09/03/2019 23:41:18PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/192/f9b8d9b9-2657-44fb-abcb-d84d174ba833.png"}
