The fifth overall pick in the 2016 draft has nine career interceptions, but his tumultuous tenure is Jacksonville is over one month after he requested a trade.\n\nThe Jags made the move five days after owner Shad Khan said he had a \u201cheart to heart\u201d with Ramsey and expected him to play against New Orleans last weekend. Ramsey didn\u2019t, prompting Khan\u2019s decision to move on from the disgruntled defender.\n\nRamsey has missed the Jaguars\u2019 last three games with an apparent back injury, but he returned to practice last week. He\u2019ll need to play immediately with the Rams (3-3), who are without both of their usual starting cornerbacks as they head to Atlanta this weekend.\n\nThe defending NFC champions traded cornerback Marcus Peters to Baltimore earlier in the day, getting depth linebacker Kenny Young for a two-time Pro Bowl selection who will be a free agent next year. Los Angeles also put cornerback Aqib Talib on injured reserve Monday after he missed last weekend\u2019s loss to San Francisco with a rib injury.\n\nRamsey will join two prominent ex-Jaguars in Los Angeles, all three of whom were top-5 draft picks by Jacksonville.\n\nPass rusher Dante Fowler re-signed with the Rams after he was traded from Jacksonville at last season\u2019s deadline, while quarterback Blake Bortles is Jared Goff\u2019s backup after five years with the Jags.\n\nRamsey\u2019s relationship with the Jaguars frayed in recent months. He had a public spat on the sideline with coach Doug Marrone in Week 2 at Houston, and he clashed with personnel chief Tom Coughlin after the game.\n\nThe Rams are on their first three-game losing streak of coach Sean McVay\u2019s tenure, although their sputtering offense likely deserves more blame than the defense.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Los Angeles Rams acquired star cornerback Jalen Ramsey from the Jacksonville Jaguars on Tuesday night in exchange for two first-round picks and a fourth-rounder.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Mark Long"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/13/Saints_Jaguars_Football_75591.jpg-d3a44_c0-0-4715-2750_s1200x700.jpg?5e2a708a88e993f758dfd5af12db37113b2e7635", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
