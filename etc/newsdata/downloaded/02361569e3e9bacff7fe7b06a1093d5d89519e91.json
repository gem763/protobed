Police will be there if you are,' Labor MP Lisa Neville said on Wednesday, launching a police operation.\n\nOfficers will be on the roads and at the latest addition, train carparks, across Victoria.\n\nAlmost 230 people have died on Victorian roads this year, which is 57 more lives than this time last year.\n\nAt this rate, another 30 to 40 people are estimated to die by the new year, Ms Neville said.\n\n'We want to get through this long weekend... without losing a life,' she said.\n\nAssistant Commissioner Stephen Leane said people's best intentions at the start of the day were often spoilt with last-minute changes.\n\n'If you do something stupid on our roads in front of our officers we will gladly give you a ticket or a summons and we will send you off to court in the following weeks,' he said, urging people to get home safely.\n\nThe operation runs from Friday to late on Tuesday, targeting driver distraction offences.\n\nIt comes after a series of other road laws were slammed by Australian drivers.\n\nFurious motorists have slammed the ridiculous road rule that could see you lose your licence at a fast food drive-thru.\n\nOfficers will be on the roads and at the latest addition, train carparks, across Victoria (stock image)\n\nDriving laws across Australia mean motorists can be fined up to $484 and lose as many as five demerit points if they pay at a drive-thru using their phone.\n\nThe law was highlighted by a Victoria Police poll, with drivers voicing their anger at the rule.\n\n'Does that mean I can pull on the hand brake, turn off the car at traffic lights and use my phone? I am hoping this is a joke,' one user wrote.\n\n'You can't seriously argue that using a mobile phone to pay for the food is too dangerous, but leaning out of the car window (often with both hands) to collect your food, drinks, whatever is fine,' another replied.\n\nDrivers in Victoria could be fined $484 and will lose four demerit points if they are caught paying for food using their phones.\n\nThe law also applies across the rest of Australia, with fines and points for anyone caught paying with their phones.\n\nDriving laws across Australia mean motorists can be fined up to $484 and lose as many as five demerit points if they pay at a drive-thru using their phone (stock image)\n\nDrivers can also be fined $344 and slapped with three demerit points for fixing stickers to their rear window or hanging fluffy dice from their rear-view mirror.\n\nThe obscure and draconian road rule bans any trinket that could obscure the driver's view and potentially cause an accident.\n\nPolice and road safety groups from all but one Australian state confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that such items could constitute a traffic offence. And that they are now on the look out for these 'driver distraction' offences.\n\nSuch items - also including air fresheners, flags, toys, and so on - are not strictly forbidden from cars but could attract a fine if police consider them obstructions.\n\nPlacing a GPS anywhere but the lower right or lower centre of the windscreen could also attract a fine for similar reasons.\n\nSouth Australian Police's traffic commander, Superintendent Bob Gray, said his officers were specifically targeting driver distraction.\n\nDrivers can be fined up to $344 and slapped with three demerit points for hanging air fresheners or fluffy dice from their rear-view mirror\n\n'Mobile phones, GPS devices and other technology or items in the car can be a major distraction for drivers and divert their attention from the task at hand,' he said.\n\n'When mounting your GPS display or adding any decorative items, like fluffy dice or stickers, consider whether it will obscure your vision. It is important that drivers have a clear view of the road, to the front, back and sides, at all times.'\n\nMotorists driving without having clear view face a $193 fine plus a $60 contribution to the victims of crime levy.", "description": "Police are changing tack this Melbourne Cup long weekend by putting officers at train station carparks to nab drivers only partly doing the right thing, in order to stop more road deaths.", "authors": ["Daily Mail Australia Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/03/5817362-0-image-a-6_1572405191228.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
