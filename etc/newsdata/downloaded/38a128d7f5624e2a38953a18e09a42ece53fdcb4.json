Closed circuit TV footage is being studied in the investigation.\n\nPrior to the theft, visitors to the Cattelan exhibition could book a three-minute appointment to use the toilet. This had proved popular when the toilet was on display at the Guggenheim.\n\nToilet not specially guarded\n\nThe artist intended the golden toilet to be a pointed satire about excessive wealth. Cattelan has previously said: \"Whatever you eat, a $200 lunch or a $2 hot dog, the results are the same, toilet-wise.\"\n\nMaurizio Cattelan, seen in Los Angeles in November 2018, is known for creating controversial sculptures and installations.
