(Chris Carlson/2015 AP photo)\n\nThe NHL has agreed to a multiyear deal with Yandex, the leading Internet search provider in Russia, to broadcast all NHL games through its streaming service starting this season. Yandex will announce the partnership at 10 p.m. Eastern.\n\nYandex, considered the Russian equivalent to Google, will offer regular-season and playoff game broadcasts free, building off the NHL\u2019s previous distribution deal with Eurosport, which broadcast 15 games a week as part of a paid package. With those rights up this summer, NHL executive vice president of international and media strategy David Proper said Yandex was the most attractive option because \u201cthey were willing to work with us in the way that we wanted to promote the NHL and the game of hockey itself in Russia,\u201d including with original content about Russian NHL stars. Viewers also will be able to watch the games with Russian commentary.\n\n\u201cWe want to show the other side of the Russian players to the Russian fan base,\u201d Proper said. \u201cI think that\u2019s always been something that\u2019s been difficult for us to convey because it\u2019s usually just the games that are being distributed. Yandex has certainly expressed a commitment to kind of, for lack of a better way to put it, take the helmets off and let people get to really know [Washington captain Alex] Ovechkin or [Tampa Bay forward Nikita] Kucherov or [Lightning goaltender Andrei] Vasilevskiy or somebody like that.\u201d\n\nThe deal continues the league\u2019s push to make NHL games more accessible abroad. Last season, the league had a designated European Game of the Week for the first time, with an earlier North American puck drop to enable those games to be broadcast in prime time across Europe. The NHL also stages Global Series games, with the Chicago Blackhawks and Philadelphia Flyers playing their season opener in Prague after completing their training camps in Switzerland and Germany, respectively. The Buffalo Sabres and Tampa Bay Lightning also are set to play a pair of regular-season games in Stockholm in November.\n\n[DAZN\u2019s next attempt at buzz: A boxing match between YouTube stars Logan Paul and KSI]\n\nIt\u2019s the third straight season the NHL has played regular-season games in Europe. Before Game 1 of the Stanley Cup finals in May, NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly said that while the league won\u2019t be bringing any games to China this year, \u201cwe\u2019re going to really ramp up our presence there. \u2026 We\u2019re going to continue to invest in grass roots, in school programs \u2026 [to] continue to fuel the growth of youth hockey in China.\u201d Ovechkin visited there as an NHL player ambassador in early August.\n\nProper said Russia consistently has rated as the NHL\u2019s top market for European viewership, and Russian NHL players rank among the most-searched athletes on Yandex.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re certainly one of the most well-known digital brands in Russia, if not the world, so so we were pretty flattered when they were interested in the first place,\u201d Proper said. \u201cTheir reach and the scope of use by the Russian fan base and Russian Community and their commitment to our game will have exponential effects on the ability to for us to grow our brand.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nNHL uses Alex Ovechkin to help grow hockey in China\n\nCapitals unveil 2019-20 regular season schedule, with a challenging start\n\nHow Mumford and Sons became the soundtrack for Caps\u2019 Stanley Cup triumph", "description": "Considered the Russian equivalent to Google, tech giant will offer regular-season and playoff game broadcasts for free.", "authors": ["Isabelle Khurshudyan", "Reporter Covering The Washington Capitals", "Isabelle Khurshudyan Covers The Washington Capitals.
