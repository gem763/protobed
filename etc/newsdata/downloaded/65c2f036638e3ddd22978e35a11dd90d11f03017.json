(Photo: Patrick Semansky, AP)\n\nRep. Jim Jordan, the top Republican on the House Oversight Committee and an outspoken ally of the president, railed to reporters about Schiff and Democrats, both about the process of impeachment inquiry and the substance of the whistleblower complaint that helped launch the investigation into Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine.\n\nHe said he wasn\u2019t concerned with Vindman\u2019s testimony. According to Jordan, it\u2019s just an \u201copinion\u201d on matters already released to the public, such as Trump\u2019s July 25th call. Jordan argued the hearing would not move the ball forward in the Democrats\u2019 agenda.\n\n\u201cThe fundamental facts have never changed,\u201d he said.\n\nMore: Trump impeachment inquiry enters Week 6: National Security Council officials to be questioned on Ukraine aid\n\nTrump goes on attack before Vindman testimony\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday again attacked the impeachment inquiry involving his dealings with Ukraine and the allegation he withheld military aid in exchange for an investigation of a political rival, Joe Biden.\n\n\"Why are people that I never even heard of testifying about the call,\" Trump wrote in a tweet. \"Just READ THE CALL TRANSCRIPT AND THE IMPEACHMENT HOAX IS OVER!

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 29, 2019\n\nTrump also called the impeachment inquiry, launched Sept. 24 by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a \"total scam.\"\n\nOriginal story:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 A day after announcing they will vote this week to formalize impeachment inquiry procedures, House Democrats will hear from Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, an Army officer and the Trump administration's top Ukraine expert who in prepared testimony said he was \"concerned\" by President Donald Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\n\"I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government\u2019s support of Ukraine,\" Vindman wrote. A copy of his planned testimony for Tuesday was obtained Monday evening by USA TODAY.\n\nVindman will be the first White House official to testify who listened in on the call in which Trump urged an investigation of his political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\n\"I realized that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma, it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained,\" Vindman wrote in his testimony. \"This would all undermine U.S. national security. Following the call, I again reported my concerns to NSC\u2019s lead counsel.\"\n\nIntelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff returns to a closed session before the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees on October 26, 2019 in Washington, DC.

Kurt Volker, Trump's previous special envoy to Ukraine and Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, also attended and have both testified in the inquiry. Perry recently resigned his position.\n\nIn his testimony, Vindman offered an overview of his role within the Trump administration, as well as details of the two specific events that he found \"inappropriate\" and led to him reporting the situation to the National Security Council's top lawyer. The first was a meeting with Oleksandr Danylyuk, Ukraine's secretary of the National Security and Defense Council. The second was Trump's phone call with Zelensky.\n\nAccording to testimony, the meeting with Danylyuk was held in July and attended by a number of officials, including Volker, Perry, Sondland and then-National Security Advisor John Bolton. It was going well until the Ukrainians asked about a potential meeting between Trump and Zelensky, Vindman wrote. Sondland then \"started to speak about Ukraine delivering specific investigations in order to secure the meeting with the President.\"\n\nBolton cut the meeting short. Vindman wrote that after the meeting, there was a debriefing where he confronted Sondland, saying \"his statements were inappropriate, that the request to investigate Biden and his son had nothing to do with national security, and that such investigations were not something the NSC was going to get involved in or push.\"\n\nVindman said Ukraine launching such investigations would push partisan politics into helping Ukraine fend off Russia, which would \"undermine U.S. national security.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., sent a letter to members Monday outlining the resolution sought to combat a key line of Republican attack: that the impeachment inquiry was illegitimate because there was no House vote on it.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/29/live-trump-impeachment-inquiry-updates-ukraine-expert-testify/2492526001/", "description": "Today in the impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump: Lt.
