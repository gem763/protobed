I want to get out of the Middle East,\u201d Trump said at a joint press conference with the Italian President Sergio Mattarella on Wednesday.\n\nThe House, meanwhile, overwhelming passed a resolution on Wednesday rebuking Trump\u2019s decision and calling on Turkey to stop military action.\n\nTrump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops opened the door for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan to begin an invasion in Syria targeting U.S.-allied Kurdish forces, who are considered a key partner in the fight against ISIS. Ankara though considers the Kurdish forces to be a terrorist group because of their ties to a Kurdish insurgency in Turkey.\n\nTrump later imposed economic sanctions on Turkey over the move and Congress is moving to impose additional sanctions.\n\nAbandoned by U.S. troops, the Kurds have since struck a deal with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to deploy Syrian troops near the border to deter Turkey\u2019s incursion, marking a major shift in the country's ongoing civil war.\n\nDespite the escalation, Paul maintained that there is still hope for the Kurds, suggesting that Erdo\u011fan and Assad could reach a deal that would give them some autonomy.\n\n\u201cThere is a chance that Assad and Erdo\u011fan \u2014 if Assad will guarantee his side of the border \u2014 that there could be a retreat of Turkey back within its borders and you actually could maybe set up something where the Kurds actually get some provincial or semi-autonomous control,\u201d he told Hill.TV.\n\n\u2014Tess Bonn", "description": "Sen.
