Lee\u2019s artillery commander Porter Alexander are kept. A 76-foot-tall marble obelisk mourns the loss of local men killed in the \u201ccause of the Confederate states.\u201d\n\nJust down the road in Hephzibah, a high school teacher had a different interpretation of the Confederacy\u2019s legacy.\n\nIn a classroom, the flag was described as \u201ca sticker you put on the back of your pickup truck to announce that you intend to marry your sister. Think of it like a white trash \u2018Save The Date\u2019 card,\u201d the Augusta Chronicle reported.\n\nThe image, originally taken from the popular webcomic The Oatmeal, was projected onto a whiteboard to explain the concept of a story within a story, the Chronicle reported.\n\nA photo of the text was posted on Facebook by a student\u2019s parent, prompting an investigation by the Richmond County School System. The teacher was placed on paid administrative leave, according to the Chronicle.\n\n\u201cThe Richmond County School System is committed to creating a diverse, equitable learning environment for students,\u201d the system said in a statement, the Chronicle reported. \u201cThe language used in the example was unacceptable and has no place in our classrooms.\u201d\n\nThe school system did not return a request for comment.\n\nThe incident is a unique wrinkle in the national discussion over how Confederate symbols \u2014 such as flags, monuments and even Army base names \u2014 should be reckoned with in the 21st century.\n\nThere has been a growing movement to install plaques next to Confederate monuments that contextualize a war launched to preserve the institution of slavery, and explain how rebel symbols have historically been used to intimidate African Americans during key moments in the fight for civil rights.\n\nRead more:\n\nAs plantations talk more honestly about slavery, some visitors are pushing back\n\nChicago teachers vote to strike Oct. 17 if contentious contract talks are not settled\n\n\u2018Slam dunk for Harvard\u2019: Ruling backs the status quo on race in college admissions", "description": "The teacher was placed on administrative leave pending a review, the Richmond County School System said.", "authors": ["Alex Horton", "General Assignment Reporter Covering National", "Breaking News", "October At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/BS8Eo7C5fzlk7Z1Elr9w4boFzR8=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/USQ3WKHGT4I6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
