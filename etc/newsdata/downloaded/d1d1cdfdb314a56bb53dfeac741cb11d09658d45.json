REUTERS/Lucas Jackson\n\nRepresentative Susan Wild was among a number of Democrats from highly competitive \u201cswing\u201d seats in the House of Representatives who changed her mind to back an impeachment probe against Trump. She expects to hear about it at a town hall meeting next week in Allentown, Pennsylvania.\n\nWild says her district is about equally divided between Democrats and Republicans, including Trump voters. But she doesn\u2019t appear worried.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I have to convince them. I think the facts will convince them,\u201d Wild told Reuters on Friday. Her office email and phone calls have been running 11-to-one in favour of an impeachment inquiry, a \u201cmarked contrast to the kind of communications that we\u2019ve gotten the last few months from our constituents,\u201d she said.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry against Trump on Tuesday. She had resisted demands for such a probe for months, but reversed course after reports that Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a July 25 telephone call to investigate his political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who did work for a Ukraine gas company.\n\nWild had previously tried to stay quiet about impeachment, even as liberal activists pressured her. Now her doubts have evaporated.\n\n\u201cThe initial summary of the phone call was damning,\u201d she said. But a whistleblower complaint about the call released this week was \u201chorrifying\u201d and \u201cput me over the line to say this is not a qualified call for an impeachment inquiry. We\u2019re there.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Representative Dean Phillips, who ousted a Republican from a suburban seat in Minnesota last year and announced support for an impeachment probe on Tuesday, also knows he will have to explain his decision to voters in the coming days.\n\n\u201cFirst I\u2019m going to be listening, and (then) explain the process, and why principles have to take precedence over party or anything else right now,\u201d Phillips told Reuters.\n\nSome vulnerable Democrats from so-called \u201cfrontline\u201d congressional districts sought guidance from the party leadership on talking about impeachment back home. A group met Pelosi and other leaders on Thursday evening to talk about the impeachment process, including how to sell it to voters in their districts, a senior Democratic aide said.\n\nHelp came in the form of talking points that one prominent Democrat, Representative David Cicilline, was distributing to members leaving for the break on Friday.\n\nPrompts included: \u201cThe president has engaged in serious wrongdoing, betrayed his oath of office, and undermined our national security,\u201d and \u201cTrump abused the office of the president by pressuring a foreign government to target a political opponent ....(and) tried to cover it up.\u201d\n\nTrump denies pressuring Ukraine, and many Republicans argue that the known facts don\u2019t rise to the level of impeachable offences.\n\nRepublican Representative Greg Walden said on Wednesday that the phone call to Zelenskiy \u201cwasn\u2019t President Trump\u2019s finest moment\u201d but does not constitute \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanours,\u201d the terminology the Constitution uses for impeachable offences.", "description": "Some moderate Democratic lawmakers who a week ago had little interest in talking about an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump say they are now optimistic they can sell it to voters at home during a recess of the U.S. Congress over the next two weeks.", "authors": ["Susan Cornwell", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190928&t=2&i=1434728986&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8R02S", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
