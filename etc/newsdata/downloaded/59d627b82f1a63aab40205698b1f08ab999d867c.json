Time to pull the plug and EMPTY THE TANK,' Dolphin Project wrote to Facebook.\n\nIt is believed the dolphins will remain there for the rest of their lives.\n\nAnimal activists have been concerned about a range of exotic animals that were kept as a tourist attraction at Melka Hotel in northern Bali (the rescue pictured)\n\nJohnny (pictured) is so blind due to living in chlorine that he will not be able to survive in the wild\n\nDewa (pictured) has no teeth so he will not be able to survive in the wild and catch fish\n\nThe dolphins had such bad health after living in the swimming pool's chlorine infused toxic water for so long.\n\nThe Dolphin Project said that now that Dewa has no teeth, he cannot catch fish and Johnny is so blind that he will not be able to survive in the wild.\n\nDolphin Project founder, Richard 'Ric' O'Barry, took to Facebook in a video which explained that the other two dolphins, Rocky and Rambo, will also be at the sanctuary next month.\n\nMr O'Barry said that when the dolphin show was shut down at Melka Hotel, five dolphin trainers also lost their job.\n\nThe dolphins had such bad health after living in the swimming pool's chlorine infused toxic water for so long\n\nWorking together, they all completed a rescue mission where a range of exotic animals were taken from the Melka hotel in August\n\n'Jobs are hard to find in these parts. They have families and kids to raise. So we hired them. Gave them a raise. Put them to work as caregivers at the sanctuary,' he said.\n\n'They couldn't be happier being part of the crew and helping us with this pioneer effort. They threw away their Melka Hotel T-shirt and put on Dolphin Project shirts.'\n\nHowever, local news website Coconuts Bali reported that a spokesperson from BKSDA Bali said the dolphins would be returned to Melka Hotel.\n\n'These dolphins are not confiscated. They're just being moved temporarily. Later after Melka [Hotel] fix their facility, we will return them,' he said.", "description": "Animal activists have been concerned about a range of exotic animals that were kept as a tourist attraction at Melka Hotel in northern Bali, including the final two dolphins that were saved this week.", "authors": ["Lauren Ferri For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/15/19495046-0-image-a-23_1570630823166.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
