She was 84.\n\nCarroll's daughter, Susan Kay, told The Associated Press her mother died Friday in Los Angeles of cancer. During her long career, Carroll earned a Tony Award for the musical \"No Strings\" and an Academy Award nomination for best actress for \"Claudine.\"\n\nBut she was perhaps best known for her pioneering work on \"Julia.\" Carroll played Julia Baker, a nurse whose husband had been killed in Vietnam, in the groundbreaking situation comedy that aired from 1968 to 1971.\n\n\"Diahann Carroll walked this earth for 84 years and broke ground with every footstep. An icon. One of the all-time greats,\" director Ava DuVernay wrote on Twitter. \"She blazed trails through dense forests and elegantly left diamonds along the path for the rest of us to follow. Extraordinary life. Thank you, Ms. Carroll.\"\n\nDiahann Carroll walked this earth for 84 years and broke ground with every footstep. An icon. One of the all-time greats.

NBC executives were wary about putting \"Julia\" on the network during the racial unrest of the 1960s, but it was an immediate hit.\n\nIt had its critics, though, including some who said Carroll's character, who is the mother of a young son, was not a realistic portrayal of a black American woman in the 1960s. \"They said it was a fantasy,\" Carroll recalled in 1998. \"All of this was untrue. Much about the character of Julia I took from my own life, my family.\"\n\nNot shy when it came to confronting racial barriers, Carroll won her Tony portraying a high-fashion American model in Paris who has a love affair with a white American author in the 1959 Richard Rodgers musical \"No Strings.\" Critic Walter Kerr described her as \"a girl with a sweet smile, brilliant dark eyes and a profile regal enough to belong on a coin.\"\n\nActress Diahann Carroll attends the Associates for Breast & Prostate Cancer Studies 12th Annual Gala of the John Wayne Cancer Institute November 9, 2001, in Beverly Hills, California.

She began with a secondary role in \"Carmen Jones\" in 1954 and five years later appeared in \"Porgy and Bess,\" although her singing voice was dubbed because it wasn't considered strong enough for the Gershwin opera.\n\nHer other films included \"Goodbye Again,\" ''Hurry Sundown,\" ''Paris Blues\" and \"The Split.\" The 1974 film \"Claudine\" provided her most memorable role.\n\nShe played a hard-bitten single mother of six who finds romance in Harlem with a garbage man played by James Earl Jones. In the 1980s, she joined in the long-running prime-time soap opera \"Dynasty\" as Dominique Deveraux, the glamorous half-sister of Blake Carrington; her physical battles with Alexis Carrington, played by Joan Collins, were among fan highlights.\n\nMore recently, she had a number of guest shots and small roles in TV series, including playing the mother of Isaiah Washington's character, Dr. Preston Burke, on \"Grey's Anatomy\" and a stretch on the TV show \"White Collar\" as the widow June. She also returned to her roots in nightclubs.\n\nIn 2006, she made her first club appearance in New York in four decades, singing at Feinstein's at the Regency. Reviewing a return engagement in 2007, a New York Times critic wrote that she sang \"Both Sides Now\" with \"the reflective tone of a woman who has survived many severe storms and remembers every lightning flash and thunderclap.\"\n\nCarol Diann Johnson was born in New York City and attended the High School for the Performing Arts. Her father was a subway conductor and her mother a homemaker.\n\nShe began her career as a model, but a prize from \"Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts\" TV show led to nightclub engagements. In her 1998 memoir \"Diahann,\" Carroll traced her turbulent romantic life, which included liaisons with Harry Belafonte, Duke Ellington, Miles Davis, Sammy Davis Jr., Sidney Poitier and David Frost.\n\nShe even became engaged to Frost, but the engagement was canceled. An early marriage to nightclub owner Monte Kay resulted in Carroll's only child, Suzanne, as well as a divorce.\n\nShe also divorced her second husband, retail executive Freddie Glusman, later marrying magazine editor Robert DeLeon, who died. Her most celebrated marriage was in 1987, to singer Vic Damone, and the two appeared together in nightclubs.\n\nBut they separated in 1991 and divorced several years later. After she was treated for breast cancer in 1998, she spoke out for more money for research and for free screening for women who couldn't afford mammograms.\n\n\"We all look forward to the day that mastectomies, chemotherapy and radiation are considered barbaric,\" Carroll told a gathering in 2000. Besides her daughter, she is survived by grandchildren August and Sydney.", "description": "Diahann Carroll was the first black woman to star in a non-servant role in a TV series", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/04/6055f8a5-59ef-4f66-8479-02dffe36d475/thumbnail/1200x630/c5b5cfa9d4fd43f32bc8fc81e1f5ecf1/diahann-carroll-826135.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
