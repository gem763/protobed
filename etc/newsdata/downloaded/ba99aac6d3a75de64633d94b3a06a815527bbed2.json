One of them said hundreds of thousands of the coins had been minted already.\n\nA spokesman for the Treasury said the U.K. will still produce a coin to mark its departure from the EU -- whenever that takes place.\n\nJavid\u2019s predecessor, Philip Hammond, had also planned to mint a more limited number of the 50-pence coins to mark the original Brexit date of March 29.\n\n(Updates with Treasury comment in third and fifth paragraph.)\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Jessica Shankleman in London at jshankleman@bloomberg.net;Alex Morales in London at amorales2@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tim Ross at tross54@bloomberg.net, Thomas Penny\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Sign up\u00a0to our\u00a0Brexit\u00a0Bulletin, follow us\u00a0@Brexit\u00a0and\u00a0subscribe\u00a0to our podcast.Thousands of 50-pence coins minted to commemorate Brexit on Oct. 31 will be melted down after Prime Minister Boris Johnson accepted an extension from the European Union, two people familiar with the matter said.U.K", "authors": ["Jessica Shankleman", "Alex Morales"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6T_gX3ekrodbmY6QHemPsA--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/52c1d624e21e401c5f8f84fd920d976b", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
