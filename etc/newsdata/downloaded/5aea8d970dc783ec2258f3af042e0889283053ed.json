However, the attorney general for Washington DC has launched a case against the company, alleging that Facebook was made aware of the brewing scandal months ahead of public disclosure.\n\nThe aftermath and the constant stream of Cambridge Analytica reports published -- as well as those that alleged the firm was still permitting third-parties to access user data -- caused the social media platform's stock price to tank by close to 20 percent in March 2018.\n\nCNET: Hackers set up a fake veteran-hiring website to infect victims with malware\n\nA further share price drop of eight percent occurred following the release of Facebook's Q2 2018 earnings in July, in which the tech giant missed revenue estimates and admitted to slowing user growth.\n\nSeparately, Facebook lost an appeal in August to have a lawsuit dismissed which alleges the company allowed facial recognition technology to invade the privacy of users based in Illinois. Claimants say that the network's tag suggestion feature infringes privacy rights secured under the Illinois' Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA).\n\nTechRepublic: Latest research says organizations need to integrate security principles with DevOps\n\nIn related security news, Facebook recently announced the suspension of tens of thousands of apps created by roughly 400 developers. While some of the apps were banned for inappropriate data sharing and suspicious behavior, the tech giant emphasized that not all were necessarily a threat -- and some creators simply didn't respond to requests for information, leading to their suspension.\n\nThe move is in line with Facebook's efforts to secure its platform in the wake of Cambridge Analytica.\n\nZDNet has reached out to Facebook and will update if we hear back.\n\nPrevious and related coverage\n\nHave a tip?
