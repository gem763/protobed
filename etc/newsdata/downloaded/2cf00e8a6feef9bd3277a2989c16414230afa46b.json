This is myth becoming madness", "language": "en", "published_at": "2019-08-29", "text": "Two years ago, former FBI Director James Comey James Brien ComeyTrump suggests watchdog report shows Mueller probe was 'illegal' Trump tweetstorm dominates presidential weekend Does Comey deserve an apology? Not if you read the IG's report MORE came out with a book that celebrated himself as a paragon of \u201cethical leadership,\u201d a subject that he later taught at the College of William and Mary. Comey declared, \u201cEthical leaders lead by seeing above the short term, above the urgent or the partisan, and with a higher loyalty to lasting values, most importantly the truth.\u201d If that is the case, the new Justice Department inspector general report released on Thursday establishes that Comey is the very antithesis of the ethical leader he described. Comey was found to have violated both federal law and regulations for his own gain, and he made critical decisions that put personal over institutional interests.\n\nNevertheless, Comey released a statement portraying the scathing report as a type of victory and encouraged his critics to send their apologies to him. It was a \u201cCaptain Queeg\u201d moment when myth borders on madness. Rather than rave about who stole his strawberries, as Queeg did in \u201cThe Caine Mutiny,\u201d Comey claims someone stole a reputation that he tossed away two years ago. The report states that Comey not only knowingly violated rules governing all FBI employees, but his decisions \u201cset a dangerous example for the over 35,000 current FBI employees.\u201d\n\nIt details how Comey removed FBI memoranda and then used his friend, Columbia Law School professor Daniel Richman, to leak the contents of one memo to The New York Times. Several of the memos were later found to contain privileged, sensitive or classified information. The FBI seized the memos and had to \u201cscrub\u201d the computer of Richman to remove the unauthorized material provided by Comey. The report also says Comey later acknowledged that some of the classifications were \u201creasonable.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOf course, facts are largely immaterial in matters of mythology. When Comey removed FBI material and arranged for a leak to the media, the coverage stayed positive despite some of us noting that the \u201cmemos\u201d removed by Comey were FBI material and potentially classified. At a minimum, he violated clear rules against leaking such information to the media, a curious decision for the person tasked previously with finding leakers. I noted that such leaks were entirely unnecessary, given other options for getting this information to investigators and to Congress.\n\nThose points were met with furious objections from analysts who insisted that the memos were personal writings akin to diary entries. Legal expert and former FBI special agent Asha Rangappa said they constituted \u201cpersonal recollections,\u201d and Brookings Institution fellow and CNN legal analyst Susan Hennessey wrote that it is \u201chard to even understand the argument\u201d for how his \u201cmemory about his conversation with the president qualifies as a record, even if he jotted it down while in his office.\u201d When I wrote that the memos were covered by the Federal Records Act and by Justice Department rules barring their removal or disclosures, the arguments were dismissed by the experts on various cable networks.\n\nWhen former White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders described the conduct of Comey as \u201cimproper and likely could have been illegal,\u201d she was given two \u201cpinocchios\u201d as having falsely accused him. Comey then turned to social media, much like President Trump Donald John Trump Poll: 40 percent of voters don't think Trump will win reelection Mattis: 'I'll speak out' about policy issues 'when the time comes' China contests Trump claim it is fentanyl source MORE, to further pump up his record. He started with tweets under pseudonyms but later put his own name on tweets showing him walking through forests or standing alone while quoting sources like the Bible, \u201cBut let justice roll down like waters and righteousness like an ever flowing stream.\u201d\n\nComey was building a personal brand, just like Trump, that culminated in his publishing his sensational book \u201cA Higher Loyalty.\u201d Once again, the media was as unrelenting as it was uncritical. Few outlets mentioned the concerns over a former FBI director rushing out a book soon after leaving office in a sharp departure from his predecessors. Comey became an instant millionaire with a book tour where he was essentially met with palm fronds and cries of \u201chosanna.\u201d He knew that any final reckoning on his conduct would not come before months, if not years, of investigation.\n\nThe inspector general has confirmed what was clear and obvious. The memos were FBI material, and Comey did violate provisions of the Federal Records Act and FBI rules clearly barring their removal and disclosure. Moreover, the inspector general agreed that it was not necessary to guarantee an investigation into Trump. Investigations were ongoing and the report cites other \u201coptions\u201d that Comey refused to use. The report concludes, \u201cWhat was not permitted was the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive investigative information, obtained during the course of FBI employment, in order to achieve a personally desired outcome.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe reason Comey violated these rules was as obvious then as it is now. Leaking the memos was designed to improve his stature in the media, and it worked. Comey transformed himself into a badly needed hero to use against the villain Trump. He knew the memos would change the focus of media coverage to his new role as a federal government whistleblower.\n\nForgotten were prior calls for Comey to be fired by Democrats and Republicans alike for his poor judgment during the investigation of Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonThe Hill's Morning Report - US coastline readies for Hurricane Dorian to make landfall Swing-seat Democrats oppose impeachment, handing Pelosi leverage Labor Day jitters on both sides of America's political divide MORE and her use of unsecured servers for communications. There was little need to discuss how the review by former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein Rod RosensteinTrump allies call on Cummings to schedule hearing over Comey report Five takeaways from Justice IG report on Comey James Comey wants an apology? This is myth becoming madness MORE found \u201cserious mistakes\u201d by Comey. It was no longer breaking news that Rosenstein also cited a long list of former attorneys general, federal judges and leading prosecutors from both parties who believed Comey violated his obligation to \u201cpreserve, protect and defend\u201d the traditions of the Justice Department and the FBI.\n\nRosenstein also noted that Comey \u201crefused to admit his errors,\u201d including his obvious violation of \u201clong standing Justice Department policies and traditions.\u201d That was even before Comey decided to remove FBI material and leak information to the press, yet he is still refusing to admit his errors. Shortly after the inspector general report was released, Comey returned to spinning his conduct as somehow vindicated by the findings. He tweeted, \u201cI don\u2019t need a public apology from those who defamed me, but a quick message with a \u2018sorry we lied about you\u2019 would be nice.\u201d\n\nComey is referring to the Justice Department decision not to charge him with releasing classified information and no finding by the inspector general of an intentional release of classified, as opposed to sensitive, information. However, many of us who have been critics of Comey have long said that his prosecution was unlikely. Comey is relying on the fact that his memos were not found to have contained classified or sensitive information until after he gave the information to The New York Times.\n\nThe inspector general report says that, following the publication of the New York Times article, a classification review was conducted. The reason is that Comey never asked for such a review, any more than he asked for permission as a fired FBI employee to remove the material or leak it to the media. According to the report, senior officials stated they were \u201cstunned\u201d and \u201cshocked\u201d by Comey removing and disclosing the information.\n\nComey knows that, ultimately for him, none of this matters. He has magnanimously accepted the apologies that no one has offered and claimed vindication that appears nowhere in the inspector general report. That is simply the benefit of being the author of your own mythology.\n\nJonathan Turley is the Shapiro Professor of Public Interest Law at George Washington University.
