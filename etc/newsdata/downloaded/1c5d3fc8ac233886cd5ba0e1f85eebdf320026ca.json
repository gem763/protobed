Revenue also beat Wall Street predictions, and Ciena said it is on track for substantial revenue growth and increased profitability.\n\nLands' End \u2013 The apparel retailer lost 9 cents per share for its latest quarter, smaller than the 19 cents a share loss that Wall Street analysts had been forecasting. Revenue beat estimates as well as same-store sales at U.S. company-operated stores jumped 7.5%.\n\nSignet Jewelers \u2013 The jewelry retailer reported adjusted quarterly profit of 51 cents per share, well above the 24 cents a share consensus estimate. Revenue topped forecasts, and a comparable sales drop of 1.5% was less than half the 3.1% decline forecast by analysts who were surveyed by Refinitiv.\n\nComcast \u2013 The NBCUniversal and CNBC parent was upgraded to \"outperform\" from \"perform\" at Oppenheimer, which pointed to strength in broadband and an underestimation by Wall Street of ad revenues.\n\nPrudential Financial \u2013 The nation's largest life insurance company is buying online startup Assurance IQ, a direct-to-consumer insurance platform, for $2.35 billion.\n\nLyft \u2013 Deutsche Bank initiated coverage of the ride-hailing service with a \"buy\" rating, saying the stock may be bottoming after hitting a record low and pointing to what it calls \"robust\" second-quarter results.\n\nSlack Technologies \u2013 Slack reported an adjusted quarterly loss of 14 cents per share, smaller than the 18 cents a share loss expected by Wall Street. The workplace messaging service also saw revenue come in above analysts' forecasts, but the shares are under pressure after Slack forecast a larger-than-expected loss for the current quarter.\n\nPalo Alto Networks \u2013 Palo Alto beat Street estimates by 5 cents a share, with adjusted quarterly profit of $1.47 per share. Revenue exceeded estimates, as well. The cybersecurity firm issued a fiscal 2020 profit forecast below Wall Street estimates, however, even as it sees strong demand for its cloud security business.", "description": "These are the stocks posting the largest moves before the bell.", "authors": ["Peter Schacknow", "Fred Imbert"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106086209-1566231629721rtx71q85.jpg?v=1566231700", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
