The U.S. stands with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SaudiArabia?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#SaudiArabia</a> and supports its right to defend itself. The Iranian regime\u2019s threatening behavior will not be tolerated. \u2014@SecPompeo\n\nTrump on Wednesday struck a cautious note, saying there were many options short of war with Iran, which denies involvement in Saturday's strikes. He ordered more sanctions on Tehran.\n\nIran's foreign minister told CNN the Islamic Republic \"won't blink\" if it has to defend itself against any U.S. or Saudi military strike, which he said would lead to \"all-out war.\"\n\n\"I am making a very serious statement that we don't want war; we don't want to engage in a military confrontation ... But we won't blink to defend our territory,\" Mohammad Javad Zarif said.\n\nZarif earlier accused Pompeo of being part of a \"B-team\" that Tehran says includes Saudi Arabia's crown prince and is trying to dupe Trump into opting for war.\n\nPompeo said on Wednesday the attack was \"of a scale we've just not seen before.\"\n\n\"The Saudis were the nation that were attacked. It was on their soil. It was an act of war against them directly,\" he told reporters before meeting Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nThe Pentagon said on Thursday the U.S. military is working with Saudi Arabia to find ways to provide more protection for the northern part of the country in the wake of the attack. Spokesperson Jonathan Hoffman said the department is providing President Donald Trump with military options for any U.S. response, but no decisions have been made.\n\nHe says the U.S. has a high level of confidence that officials will be able to accurately determine exactly who launched the attacks.\n\nThe Saudi kingdom, which described the assault as a \"test of global will,\" on Wednesday displayed the remnants of 25 Iranian drones and missiles it said were used in the strike as undeniable evidence of Iranian aggression.\n\nThe Saudi ambassador to Berlin said \"everything is on the table,\" telling German radio that options need to be discussed carefully.\n\nRemains of the missiles the Saudi government claims were used to attack an Aramco oil facility are displayed during a news conference on Wednesday. (Hamad I Mohammed/Reuters)\n\nPompeo, who arrived in the UAE from Saudi Arabia on Thursday for talks with Abu Dhabi's crown prince, welcomed the move on Twitter: \"Recent events underscore the importance of protecting global commerce and freedom of navigation.\"\n\nYemen's Iran-aligned Houthi movement, which is battling a Saudi-led military coalition, claimed responsibility for the assault on two Saudi oil plants, including the world's largest processing facility. U.S. and Saudi officials rejected the claim, saying the attack had not come from the south.\n\nFellow Gulf OPEC producer Kuwait, which said earlier this week it was investigating the detection of a drone over its territory, has put its oil sector on high alert and raised security to the highest level as a precautionary measure.\n\nOil prices, which soared following the attack, steadied after Saudi Arabia pledged to restore full production by the end of the month.\n\nUN meeting in focus\n\nProof of Iranian responsibility and evidence that the attack was launched from Iranian territory could pressure Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia and Washington, which want to curb Iranian influence in the region, into a response. Trump has previously said he does not want war and is co-ordinating with Gulf and European states.\n\nPompeo said the attacks would be a major focus of next week's annual UN General Assembly meeting, and suggested Riyadh could make its case there.\n\nEarlier Thursday, Zarif accused Pompeo of trying to \"dodge a U.S. obligation\" to issue visas for Iran's UN delegates, though later in the day, spokesperson Abbas Mousavi tweeted Zarif would in fact leave for New York on Friday to attend the assembly.\n\nTehran has said the U.S. accusations were part of Washington's \"maximum pressure\" policy on the Islamic Republic to force Iran to renegotiate a 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, which Trump exited last year, reimposing sanctions.\n\nFrance, which is trying to salvage the deal, said the New York gathering presented a chance to de-escalate tensions.\n\n\"When missiles hit another country, it is an act of war, but we have to go back to the principle of de-escalation,\" French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said. \"There is an international investigation. Let's wait for its results.\"\n\nThe French army sent seven experts to Saudi Arabia to join the investigation. UN officials monitoring sanctions on Iran and Yemen are also helping probe the attack, which exposed gaps in Saudi air defences despite billions spent on Western military hardware.\n\nU.S. efforts to bring about a UN Security Council response looked unlikely to succeed as Russia and China have veto powers and were expected to shield Iran.\n\nWashington and its Gulf allies want Iran to stop supporting regional proxies, including in Yemen, Iraq and Lebanon, as well as to put more limitations on its nuclear and missile programs.\n\nU.S.-led coalition\n\nThe United Arab Emirates on Thursday followed its main Arab ally Saudi Arabia in announcing it was joining a global maritime security coalition that Washington has been trying to build since a series of explosions on oil tankers in Gulf waters in recent months that were also blamed on Tehran.\n\nThe state-run WAM news agency quoted Salem al-Zaabi of the Emirati Foreign Ministry as saying the UAE joined the coalition to \"ensure global energy security and the continued flow of energy supplies to the global economy.\"\n\nFire and smoke billow from Norwegian-owned Front Altair tanker, said to have been attacked in the waters of the Gulf of Oman on June 13. The incident came amid spiralling tensions between Tehran and Washington, which has pointed the finger at Iran over earlier tanker attacks in May.

Iran denies being behind the tanker explosions, though they came after Tehran threatened to stop oil exports from the Persian Gulf.", "description": "Iran's foreign minister warned Thursday that any attack on his country over a drone-and-missile strike on Saudi Arabia's oil industry will result in \"all-out war.\"", "authors": ["Thomson Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5289379.1568891014!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/russia-iran.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
