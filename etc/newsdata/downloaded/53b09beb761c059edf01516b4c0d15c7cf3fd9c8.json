He was pronounced dead shortly afterwards.\n\nShe is now demanding a full investigation into her father's \"undignified\" death.\n\n(Image: Emma Driver /SWNS.COM)\n\n(Image: SWNS.COM)\n\nEmma is angry he was left to \"pass away in front of everybody\" in a queue of up to 40 trolleys.\n\nDevastated Emma, a former nurse from Tile Hill, Coventry, said: \"From the moment my dad died I was angry.\n\n\"I spoke with a doctor and a nurse and expressed my frustration, anger, upset at how my dad had been left.\n\n\"Although he was elderly, he wasn't dying. I believe had my father been prioritised, or I had been listened to and taken seriously, then he would still be here.\n\n(Image: Emma Driver /SWNS.COM)\n\n\"To let a man die in pain in front of everybody is undignified. I must have spoken to six nurses in total. I knew he needed to be seen but they just weren't listening. Nobody looked at him, or gave him pain relief. It was horrific\n\n\"I have lost my father due to the NHS failing and there is nothing that can bring him back.\"\n\nJust a few hours earlier, Donald had gone for Sunday lunch at his daughter's house and was complaining of stomach pain.\n\nEmma added: \"At 8.20pm, I made a nurse aware of his previous history and I also showed a photo from a year before of his stomach.\n\n(Image: Emma Driver /SWNS.COM)\n\n\"At 10.30pm, I told the nurses and a doctor to say that my dad needed to be seen urgently. I went back to the nurses station an hour later, asking them to see my dad.\n\n\"At 12:30am, he vomited in the corridor and I shouted for help but no one came. I sat him up by myself.\n\n\"He then slid off the trolley onto the floor. A lot of members of the public were watching. I shouted for help again.\n\n\"It was only then that nurses came and helped, very reluctantly, to get my dad onto the trolley. He was given no pain relief while he was there, for the whole six hours.\n\n\"It was then that I knew he was gone. They then put him back on the trolley and rushed him into resus where they tried for about three minutes and then I told him to stop. He died at 12.59am.\"\n\n(Image: SWNS.COM)\n\nThe following afternoon, Emma received a phone call from the coroner to say they couldn't determine a cause of death.\n\nA spokesman for University Hospital Coventry and Warwickshire said: \"The Trust would like to offer its sincere and heartfelt sympathies to Mr Driver's family and friends at this sad and difficult time.\n\n\"We are in contact with the family and are investigating this matter thoroughly.\"\n\nDonald is survived by his widow, Andrea, 72, and granddaughter Layla, 5. He had been married to Andrea since 1985.", "description": "Donald Driver, 84, had been waiting in A&E at University Hospital Coventry & Warwickshire for around six hours", "authors": ["Tom Hitchenor", "Sam Elliott", "Image", "Swns.Com", "Emma Driver"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20713227.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_SWNS_HOSPITAL_DEATH-10.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
