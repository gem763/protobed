Then, \"Good Morning Britain\" hosts praised Ronson for being \"out and proud.\"\n\nSoon after, the internet erupted in jokes about the situation.\n\nOthers said using the term \"sapiosexual\" could detract from other existing sexualities and devalue people with disabilities.\n\nRegardless of the comments, social psychologist Phillip Hammack told Insider that the term, and the trend of defining sexuality based on intangibles rather than gender-based appearances, is here to stay.\n\nHammack said he understands why people may be opposed to a term like sapiosexual because their views are \"coming from a paradigm of sexual orientation we've been raised with,\" or that a person's sexual orientation is defined by their gender identity and the gender identity of others.\n\nRead more: Falling out of love is a real thing, but it's possible to rekindle romance if you 'actively explore' your relationship\n\nBut \"sexual orientation is about more than genders we're attracted to,\" Hammack said. \"This explosion around new sexuality language tells that story, but it doesn't mean gender isn't a strong anchoring concept for sexual desire.\"\n\nCritics of the term \"sapiosexual\" say it's elitist, ableist, and detracts from the queer community's experiences\n\nWhen headlines started proclaiming Ronson had \"come out\" as sapiosexual, some Twitter users were also quick to explain that sapiosexuality is not a recognized sexuality in LGBTQ community. In fact, the term doesn't come from sex researchers, psychologists, therapists, or any scientific resource, not to mention queer people.\n\nRather, the term first appeared in the mainstream in 2014 when dating platform OKCupid made it an option users pick when searching for prospective matches, according to Mel magazine writer Miles Klee. It appears the term was first created in 1998 when LiveJournal user wolfieboy said they coined it in a post called \"Stoked on sapiosexuality.\"\n\n\"Me? I don't care too much about the plumbing. I want an incisive, inquisitive, insightful, irreverent mind. I want someone for whom philosophical discussion is foreplay,\" wolfieboy wrote of sapiosexuality.\n\nSome Twitter users who were critics of the term said that using intelligence as a benchmark characteristic for attractiveness can create problems. For example, the term could suggest only people with a certain level of formal education are attractive or that people with mental disabilities aren't attractive because their brains function differently.\n\nAdditionally, some members of the queer community found the \"coming out\" language used to describe Ronson's moment detracted from the often difficult situations queer people face when they come out at gay, bisexual, or another gender-based sexuality.\n\nRead more: 6 signs you're a bad partner even if you think you aren't\n\nCritics of the term said that using intelligence as a benchmark characteristic for attractiveness can create problems. iStock\n\nTerms like sapiosexuality will only become more popular\n\nHammack said he's seen terms like sapiosexual become increasingly common sexual orientation descriptors over the years.\n\n\"Some people say they are ecosexual, meaning they're attracted to someone who cares and is passionate about environmental issues,\" Hammack said.\n\nNo scientific research on these terms exists and Hammack believes this is mainly due to the scientific community's lack of progress in the study of sexuality.\n\n\"A lot of people are identifying with language that isn't just about gender, which the scientific community is stuck on, but it's also about non-physical traits you like and the intensity of those feelings of desire,\" he said.\n\nHammack foresees sapiosexual becoming an increasingly popular term people will use to describe their sexualities since society is becoming more open to the concept of sexual fluidity and variation. Still, he thinks it will be used as more as a secondary descriptor of sexuality rather than a person's primary descriptor of the type of person to which they're attracted.\n\n\"Intelligence can be embodied in so many ways, which is why I suspect it will be and is used as more of a supplement to other sexual identities,\" Hammack said. \"Sapiosexual\" won't replace the word \"gay\" or \"bi,\" then, but a person might call themselves \"gay-sapiosexual,\" Hammack said.\n\nDebby Herbenick, a sexual health educator and professor of applied health science at the Indiana University School of Public Health, told the New York Times that sex scientists more often consider trait-based sexuality terms as sexual identities rather than sexual orientations.\n\n\"Intelligence can be embodied in so many ways, which is why I suspect it will be and is used as more of a supplement to other sexual identities,\" Hammack said.

It could be someone who's a talker in the classroom, or a person who is performing great on exams,\" Hammack said.\n\nRegardless of how people choose to define their sexuality, though, Hammack said it's important to recognize one term doesn't make another insignificant or obsolete.\n\nWhether a person identifies as gay, straight, sapiosexual, or something else, \"we don't know why these are things we're attracted to, which is the whole point. It's not easily explained.\"", "description": "The term was coined in 1998 but gained attention again when the singer and \"Good Morning Britain\" hosts discussed the word.", "authors": ["Julia Naftulin"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8cc9bf21214c681c5ee701-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
