Everything the president* should have known was going to happen\u2014or, at the very least, vaguely care about happening, had he a shred of either intellect or humanity\u2014is happening. Turkey is blowing the hell out of northern Syria. The Russians are cheering. The Iranians are thrilled. And the Kurds, sold out by another American president, are running for cover. From The New York Times:\n\nCivilians were reported to be fleeing the border towns of Ras al Ain and Tel Abyad, which were being pounded by airstrikes and shelling, Reuters reported. \u201cThere is a huge panic among people of the region,\u201d the spokesman, Mustafa Bali, wrote.\n\nTurkey\u2019s long-planned move to root out United States-allied Kurdish forces in northeastern Syria accelerated rapidly after President Trump seemingly gave a green light in a call with Mr. Erdogan on Sunday. The operation has sparked fierce debates in Washington and could open a dangerous new front in Syria\u2019s eight-year-old war. Earlier Wednesday, the Syrian Democratic Forces had mobilized and warned of a \u201chumanitarian catastrophe\u201d as Turkey massed troops near the countries\u2019 border for an incursion it said would begin \u201cshortly.\u201d New violence between Turkey and the United States-backed Syrian Democratic Forces pits two United States allies against each other in ethnically tinged battles, leaving Washington in an awkward position.\n\n\n\nPhoto credit: < - Getty Images More\n\nTo say nothing of a moral quagmire.\n\nFor its part, the Syrian Democratic Forces said the area was \u201con the edge of possible humanitarian catastrophe\u201d because of the looming Turkish incursion. \u201cThis attack will spill the blood of thousands of innocent civilians because our border areas are overcrowded,\u201d the group said in a statement.\n\nFor those of us opposed to whatever the hell the country has been trying to accomplish over there since 2002 (and the foundational blunder beneath all of this is the invasion of Iraq, into which this country was lied by the previous Republican administration, a prominent member of which was last seen hanging out at a Cowboys game last weekend), the president*'s lame-ass assertion that his flea-on-a-griddle foreign-policy blunder that coincidentally benefits his business partners in Turkey, and his god-alone-knows-what in Moscow, comes as a particularly revolting element of the story.", "description": "Everything we knew would happen is happening.", "authors": ["Charles P.
