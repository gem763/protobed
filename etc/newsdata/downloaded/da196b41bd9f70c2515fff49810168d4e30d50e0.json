To see [Jace] there with it on to be the one to tell me was very emotional and really, really special.\n\n\"It's hard to really describe it.\"\n\nTavares was the last of his teammates to step onto the ice at a raucous Scotiabank Arena on Wednesday, saluting the crowd with his stick.\n\n\"I think he was a great choice,\" Leafs general manager Kyle Dubas said during a first-intermission press conference. \"But I think one of the major benefits that we had was that we had a number of candidates for the position, and we were able to go through each player.\n\n\"It was legitimately a case where we felt we had a number of players that could carry that honour. In the end, we just decided as a collective group that John fit the role the absolute best at this time.\"\n\nWATCH | Leafs defeat Senators in season opener:\n\nMitch Marner set up Auston Matthews for a gorgeous goal in Toronto's 5-3 win over Ottawa. 1:57\n\nToronto centre Auston Matthews, winger Mitch Marner and defenceman Morgan Rielly were named alternates, with the latter getting his 'A' on a full-time basis and the other two sharing the responsibility.\n\n\"It think all four of us look at it as a big honour,\" Matthews said. \"Like we've been saying all along, there's lots of leaders in this room.\"\n\nWATCH | Where do the Leafs stand among Canadian NHL teams?\n\nRob Pizzo looks at which teams have the best chance to win Canada's first Stanley Cup since 1993. 3:43\n\nTavares, who was captain of the New York Islanders for five seasons before signing a big-money deal with Toronto in unrestricted free agency two summers ago, joins a list of Leafs greats to wear the 'C' that includes Hap Day, Syl Apps, Ted Kennedy, George Armstrong, Dave Keon, Darryl Sittler, Rick Vaive, Wendel Clark, Doug Gilmour and Mats Sundin.\n\n\"He's just a guy that comes in every day and does his job,\" Matthews added. \"He's humble, works hard and sets a good example for everybody.\"\n\nSteady presence\n\nThe first pick in the 2009 NHL draft, Tavares scored a career-high 47 goals and 88 points in 2018-19 with the Leafs, and has been the team's rock in his 15 months with the organization.\n\nSittler and Clark were both in the building Wednesday and congratulated Tavares after the game.\n\n\"Those guys set the precedent,\" Tavares said. \"They set the foundation of the organization that set the standard here, and why it's so special job to be a Maple Leaf and be a captain.\"\n\nIn 751 career games with New York and Toronto, Tavares has 319 goals and 709 points to go along with 27 points (13 goals, 14 assists) in 31 playoff games.\n\nMatthews and Rielly were viewed as the other candidates for the captaincy, which Dion Phaneuf held from June 14, 2010, until he was traded to the Senators on Feb. 9, 2016.\n\nTopic of debate\n\nThere was debate in Toronto last week whether or not Matthews was still suitable for the role after news broke that he's facing a charge of disorderly conduct and disruptive behaviour stemming from an alleged incident \u2014 which he failed to disclose to the team \u2014 in his hometown of Scottsdale, Ariz., back in May.\n\nDubas said the allegation, which hasn't been proven in court, didn't play a role in the decision.\n\n\"This was exactly what we had and what we had discussed well before that,\" the GM said. \"It didn't affect our decision making whatsoever.\"\n\nBabcock said following Wednesday's morning skate that the team's brain trust wanted to be 100 per cent certain of its choice.\n\n\"He's the kind of person that our guys look up to and does everything right every day,\" Babcock added in his post-game remarks. \"He's all about winning \u2014 he's not about John \u2014 he's about winning.\n\n\"He's a great example to all of us.\"", "description": "John Tavares is the new captain of the Toronto Maple Leafs.
