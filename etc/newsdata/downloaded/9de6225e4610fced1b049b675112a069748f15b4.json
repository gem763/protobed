Ngo showed protesters, including members of antifa and Black Lives Matter, blocking an intersection and attempting to direct traffic at while officers on motorcycle watched from a block away.\n\nAt one point, the activists chased down 74-year-old Kent Houser after he made a right turn against their wishes, pounding on his silver Lexus and breaking a window. The car sustained thousands of dollars in damage, he told the Oregonian.\n\nEven so, Mr. Wheeler insisted that \u201cmotorists should feel completely safe coming into downtown Portland.\u201d\n\nDemonstrators did not obtain a permit before holding the Oct. 6 march to protest the death of Patrick Kimmons, a 27-year-old black man who was shot and killed Sept. 30 by police. The shooting is under investigation.\n\nThe mayor has been accused of taking a kid-gloved approach to the protests that routinely roil the liberal enclave, such as the summer occupation of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement building, which saw Portland police refuse to assist the immigration-enforcement officers unless they were in physical danger.\n\n\u201cThis is the kind of street anarchy that routinely happens where I live,\u201d tweeted Mr. Ngo.\n\nMore rioting broke out Saturday night as antifa activists brawled with protesters who turned out for a \u201cflash march for law and order,\u201d organized Patriot Prayer, a right-wing group.\n\nPortland police made no arrests during the bloody melee, even though \u201cofficers observed people in possession of hard-knuckled gloves, firearms, batons and knives. Officers also observed people use pepper spray,\u201d according to a department statement.\n\n\u201cOfficers responded to the scene and used less lethal munitions to break up the fight and prevent further violence,\u201d said Portland Police Bureau Chief Danielle Outlaw. \u201cWe will continue to investigate this incident and ask that anyone who was the victim of a crime to come forward and file a report.\u201d\n\nAccording to TV station KGW, four people received medical attention, but authorities did not know whether anyone was hospitalized.\n\nMr. Wheeler, who also holds the title of police commissioner, took a swipe at recent unflattering news coverage, such as a Fox News story headlined, \u201cMob rule? Leftist protesters take over Portland street.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m willing to take criticism all day long from Fox News,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not willing to accept criticism from Fox News of the men and women of the Portland Police Bureau.\u201d\n\nThe mayor argued that law enforcement is in a no-win situation.\n\n\u201cThis is the story of Goldilocks and the two bears. The porridge is either too hot or it\u2019s too cold,\u201d Mr. Wheeler told reporters. \u201cAt any given moment in this city, the police are criticized for being heavy-handed and intervening too quickly, or they\u2019re being criticized for being standoffish and not intervening quickly enough.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
