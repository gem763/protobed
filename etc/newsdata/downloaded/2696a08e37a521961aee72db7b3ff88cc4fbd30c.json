Allen Brack, says that it will return prize money to the player, but makes clear that it sticks by its decision to ban him for supporting Hong Kong protesters and that it will do the same to any players or shout casters who do the same in the future. The letter addresses none of the concerns raised earlier Friday by digital rights organization Access Now, which said in no uncertain terms that Blizzard\u2019s censorship of Ng Wai Chung (known as \u201cBlitzchung\u201d on Hearthstone) is an international human rights issue.\n\nBrack says Blizzard will return prize money to Chung, and that it will reduce his yearlong ban to six months, because he didn\u2019t cheat during the tournament: \u201cBut playing fair also includes appropriate pre-and post-match conduct, especially when a player accepts recognition for winning in a broadcast,\u201d Brack wrote. \u201cThere is a consequence for taking the conversation away from the purpose of the event and disrupting or derailing the broadcast.\u201d\n\nBrack evoked similar language to that used by the NFL about protesting players. Don\u2019t kneel. Stick to sports. Don\u2019t be a distraction.\n\n\u201cOver the weekend, blitzchung used his segment to make a statement about the situation in Hong Kong\u2014in violation of rules he acknowledged and understood, and this is why we took action,\u201d Brack wrote. \u201cEvery Voice Matters, and we strongly encourage everyone in our community to share their viewpoints in the many places available to express themselves. However, the official broadcast needs to be about the tournament and to be a place where all are welcome. In support of that, we want to keep the official channels focused on the game.\u201d\n\nDo you work at Activision Blizzard?

Our goal is to help players connect in areas of commonality, like their passion for our games, and create a sense of shared community. The specific views expressed by blitzchung were NOT a factor in the decision we made. I want to be clear: our relationships in China had no influence on our decision,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf this had been the opposing viewpoint delivered in the same divisive and deliberate way, we would have felt and acted the same.\u201d\n\nThis idea that corporations like Blizzard (and Riot Games, which announced Friday that it would not tolerate political speech at a tournament this weekend) believe that \u201cevery voice matters\u201d but refuse to allow players to actually use their voices for anything other than promoting the health of the video games they own is, of course, hypocritical. According to Access Now, a nonprofit group that has fought censorship and authoritarianism and advocated for digital rights all over the world, it\u2019s not only hypocritical, it\u2019s a human rights issue.\n\n\u201cBy penalizing a player for speaking up in support of protesters exercising their right to freedom of expression as well as assembly and association, Blizzard demonstrates a lack of respect for the human rights of its users,\u201d Access Now wrote in an open letter published earlier Friday.\n\nAt this point, there's not an easy way for Blizzard to clean up this mess, and Brack's statement surely won't be enough. Players have continued to protest Blizzard both online and at its campus in Irvine, California. Employees have been protesting on its campus. And a mass protest is planned for next month's BlizzCon.\n\nA request for additional clarification from Blizzard about what types of speech it will allow and what types of speech it won't was not immediately returned.", "description": "Blizzard will return prize money to Blitzchung but said that his support of Hong Kong protesters was made in a 'divisive' and 'deliberate' way.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5da1263405193d0009ba878a/lede/1570842232958-2941166448_e04bac65db_o.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.75xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
