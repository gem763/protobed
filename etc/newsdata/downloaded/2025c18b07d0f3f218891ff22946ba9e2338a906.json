Most people covered by the program came to the U.S. legally on a visa or other legal status and have requested to stay longer. The government said it receives about 1,000 such requests a year.\n\nThe government didn\u2019t formally announce its initial decision to end the program for several weeks until several immigrants receiving medical attention were unexpectedly denied requests to remain in the country and told they needed to leave within 33 days.\n\nThe move sparked intense public criticism. The House held a public hearing last week, where several young immigrants testified that they would die if deported. More than 100 members of Congress signed a letter demanding answers from the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cIt should not take an emergency hearing by Congress\u2014and threats for more\u2014to force the Trump administration to do the right thing,\u201d said Rep. Elijah Cummings (D., Md.), chairman of the House Oversight Committee.\n\nMr. McAleenan felt particularly sensitive to the negative outcry that the department\u2019s decision sparked, according to people familiar with his thinking.\n\nInitially, USCIS announced it would once more consider renewals of people with existing deferred action claims.\n\nSome Department officials pushed Mr. McAleenan to create a new medical deferred action program, administered by the Homeland Security Secretary. But other officials, particularly some political appointees within USCIS, worried that continuing the program would lend legitimacy to the idea\u2014due to be argued before the Supreme Court in November\u2014that the government has similar legal authority to defer deportation for so-called Dreamers, young people who were brought to the U.S. as children.\n\nUltimately, Mr. McAleenan opted to simply reverse the initial decision.\n\nWrite to Michelle Hackman at Michelle.Hackman@wsj.com", "description": "The Department of Homeland Security will once more consider requests from unauthorized immigrants to temporarily stay in the country, typically to receive lifesaving medical treatment, after facing fierce criticism for announcing that it would no longer accept such appeals.", "authors": ["Michelle Hackman", "Michelle.Hackman Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109054/social", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
