You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe Independent\u2019s hotel reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust. On some occasions, we earn revenue if you click the links and book, but we never allow this to affect our coverage.\n\nBest for romantic trysts: The Wittmore\n\nNeighbourhood: Barri G\u00f2tic\n\nHidden away down the smallest alleyway imaginable, this adults-only hotel has a cosy country-house feel, with a roaring log fire and stacks of board games in the library, and vintage touches in the bedrooms, such as old-school dial telephones and porcelain rotary light switches. Rooms face the internal light well, which does mean there\u2019s no view to speak of \u2013 but there's a roof terrace with a diminutive pool and a vista over the Old City.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac250 (\u00a3227)\n\nthewittmore.com\n\nBest for dining: Sir Victor\n\nNeighbourhood: Eixample\n\nThe newest addition to Barcelona's stable of design hotels, Sir Victor soothes the soul with its rich, deep colours and the plants, books and artworks that enliven the public spaces. Staff can organise design, music, food and photography tours for guests, or you might choose to freeze your troubles away in a spa so cutting-edge it includes a cryochamber. Perhaps its greatest asset, however, is the Mr Porter restaurant, which serves up possibly the greatest steaks in town (and some of the spiciest sides).\n\nDoubles from \u20ac220 (\u00a3200)\n\nsirhotels.com/en/victor/\n\nBest for a sea view: Little Beach House\n\nNeighbourhood: Garraf\n\nNot strictly speaking in Barcelona, the Beach House is an easy 45-minute train ride away, south of the city and close to the whitewashed seaside party town of Sitges. Belonging to the Soho House group, it sits in a quiet and unspoilt bay, with a simple, pretty design of pastels, plants and wicker that reflects both its location and a determination to avoid the networking buzz of the mothership \u2013 this is a place to kick back and listen to the waves (there is a ban on mobiles and laptops in the common areas).\n\nDoubles from \u20ac135 (\u00a3123)\n\nlittlebeachhousebarcelona.com/en\n\nBest for modernism: Anakena House\n\nNeighbourhood: Eixample\n\nAnakena House is an elegant converted Eixample apartment with typically modernist flourishes, from the patterned hydraulic floor tiles to the sinuous door handles. There are only eight rooms, so this isn\u2019t a place for party people, despite its location at the heart of Barcelona's genteel equivalent of the Castro district. Rather it's a place to experience how the other half still live, since it feels very much like being in someone's rather grand home.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac120 (\u00a3109)\n\nanakenahouse.com\n\nBest for bargain chic: Hotel Market\n\nNeighbourhood: Sant Antoni\n\nNamed after the revamped Mercat de Sant Antoni \u2013 a food market that takes up the adjacent block \u2013 this is an excellent budget option close to Barcelona's hippest area for wining and dining. Creaky floorboards, red lacquered cabinets and stone sinks are all enjoyably kooky for a budget three-star, and the restaurant is supremely elegant (the food less so, but you can't argue with these prices). The bar is a relaxing place to hang out with a G&T after a day's sightseeing, and the addition of terrace tables on a quiet pedestrian street is a welcome one.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac65 (\u00a359)\n\nandilanahotels.com\n\nBest for history: Mercer Hotel\n\nNeighbourhood: Barri G\u00f2tic\n\nSituated in a medieval building fused into a section of the Roman city wall, the luxurious Mercer is a huge favourite with history buffs (ask if you can see the centuries-old frescoes in a private dining room built inside the former defence tower). The hotel's crowning glory, however, is the roof garden with plunge pool \u2013 a small and quiet oasis filled with flowers and fragrant herbs.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac330 (\u00a3300)\n\nmercerbarcelona.com\n\nBest for quiet luxury: Hotel Neri\n\nNeighbourhood: Barri G\u00f2tic\n\nClose to the cathedral, but hidden from the crowds down a narrow sidestreet, the Neri is the prototype boutique, with only 22 rooms but immaculate levels of service and a superb restaurant. Closely embedded as it is in the medieval fabric of the Gothic quarter, it doesn't have much by way of views, but rooms are kept bright with a cream colour scheme and high ceilings. The plant-filled rooftop area is beautifully peaceful for somewhere so central.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac240 (\u00a3218)\n\nhotelneri.com/es\n\nBest for seventies vibes: Room-Mate Carla\n\nNeighbourhood: Eixample\n\nThis former apartment block, a short walk from some of Gaud\u00ed's finest buildings, blends elegant turn-of-the-century architecture, high ceilings and original features with exuberant seventies-inspired wall designs and bold-coloured bedspreads and cushions. It's low on facilities but does incorporate a small gym and computer for guests' use, and the patio is a peaceful place to work or read.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac120 (\u00a3109)\n\nroom-matehotels.com\n\nBest for shopping: Hotel Jazz\n\nNeighbourhood: Eixample\n\nThe Hotel Jazz could not be more central, located just off Pla\u00e7a Catalunya and close to all the main shopping arteries. It's a stylish gem for its price point, not to mention friendly. Jazz floats around the lobby, corridors and up on the sundeck, where you'll find a surprisingly wide pool, along with plenty of loungers. Decor is vaguely jazz-themed, with pinstripe fabric and a monochrome aesthetic.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac95 (\u00a386)\n\nhoteljazz.com\n\nBest for quirky design: Praktik Garden\n\nNeighbourhood: Eixample\n\nFloor-to-ceiling vintage-style circus posters transform corridors into tunnels of colour, and complement the colourful book-lined reception area. Rooms are a little more sober, but have smart, navy-tiled bathrooms and an abundance of mismatched artworks. A small garden off the sitting area gives the hotel its name, and is an unexpected perk for a hotel of this size.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac60 (\u00a355)\n\nhotelpraktikgarden.com", "description": "The best boutique hotels in Barcelona, from budget-friendly crashpads to renovated townhouses, as chosen by our resident expert.", "authors": ["Sally Davies"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/04/14/barcelona.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
