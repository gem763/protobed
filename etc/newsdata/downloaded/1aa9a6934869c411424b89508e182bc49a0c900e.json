(She had noticed his distinctive moustache.) Elayna Carausu was playing guitar and singing for a travel company, while Riley Whitelum was living on the sailing boat he had bought with money saved from working for years on oil rigs. When he said he had a boat, she thought it was a pick-up line.\n\nLuckily, Whitelum had learned a few things in the months before that encounter. Despite having grown up, like Carausu, mostly in coastal Australia, he\u2019d had no sailing experience before he bought a barely-used 43ft Beneteau craft from three bickering Italians.\n\nCarausu was, thank heavens, not on board the night it nearly sank. It was moored off Dubrovnik, Croatia, slowly taking on water from a hidden leak, when it was swamped by the wake from a fishing boat.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nWhitelum had kept the bilge pumps off to save electricity, a rookie mistake, and awoke to a cabin awash in water. After pumping it out, he turned to Google: \u201cMy boat is sinking, what do I do?\u201d\n\nGoogle responded, somewhat cryptically, \u201cAll boats are sinking. The main factor is, how fast. Don\u2019t panic. Find the source of the leak.\u201d\n\nSix years later, Whitelum, now 32, not only no longer has to ask Google for help, but he and Carausu, 26, have also become YouTube stars through their adventures at sea.\n\nMore than one million people subscribe to their channel, Sailing La Vagabonde (the name of their boat), which chronicles their life aboard in endearing, instructive and sometimes terrifying video. It follows their two Atlantic and one Pacific crossings; maggoty rubbish, broken equipment, storms and becalmings, scaldings and other injuries, the boredom of weeks offshore when you\u2019ve read all your books, would-be pirates and, this year \u2013 a stowaway \u2013 their 10-month-old son, Lenny.\n\nThere are many, many sailing YouTubers, including Brian Trautman, a former Microsoft analyst, and his brother, Brady. Their channel, named after their boat, SV Delos, has almost 356,000 subscribers, and patrons can apply to be crew online. And there are many attractive people exploring beautiful locations clad only in their bathing suits, as Carausu and Whitelum often are.\n\nBut, in this sprawling universe that also covers the shred guitarists, the Dadaist livestreamers, the haul girls, the van dwellers and the extreme eaters, the couple stand out because they are good TV; escapism without the queasy aftermath. They offer a view of life in authentically challenging circumstances, in contrast to the manufactured dramas the YouTube platform typically invites.\n\nSince they began posting in late 2014, Carausu and Whitelum\u2019s videos have become more polished, thanks to the use of a drone plus multiple cameras and editing help. Our Morning Routine Onboard, posted at the end of May, has had nearly three million views.\n\nMaybe what compels is simply their competence and equanimity. There is no whinging on board La Vagabonde. Or maybe it\u2019s the accent, shown off when Whitelum, for example, reads David Foster Wallace, his favourite author. It is doubtful that any member of the badly behaving crews on Below Deck, the Bravo reality show about life on mega yachts, is passing around copies of The Pale King.\n\nTrading Up\n\nRecently, Carausu and Whitelum were at home on their catamaran, which was docked at Gurney\u2019s Newport Resort & Marina. Little Lenny was gnawing an apple and playing with a USB cord. He has barely any baby gear, and fewer toys \u2013 a Jolly Jumper; a baby seat; a stick, a triangle and a pair of tiny cymbals. \u201cTo explain the obvious,\u201d Whitelum says, \u201cboat living is enforced minimalism.\u201d\n\nThe boat\u2019s engine was broken, and they had been in town waiting for parts for over a week \u2013 guests of Sean Kellershon, the dock master at Gurney\u2019s. Kellershon has been following their adventures for years; when he saw that they were heading north after months in the Bahamas, he offered them a spot at the marina. \u201cThey just seemed like really cool people,\u201d he says.\n\nWhitelum was wearing what looked like a Star Wars T-shirt, except that Mark Hamill\u2019s face had been replaced with his own, and Carrie Fisher\u2019s with Carausu\u2019s. Under Darth Vader\u2019s helmet was Lenny. Designed by a fan, it\u2019s La Vagabonde merchandise made by an ecologically conscious company in Los Angeles. The couple sell shirts, hoodies, totes, sailing guides and cookbooks they have written from their website, all mailed in compostable envelopes.\n\nTo explain the obvious, boat living is enforced minimalism Whitelum\n\nBut they make most of their living from patrons \u2013 about 3,500 subscribers who pay between $3 and $10 (\u00a32-\u00a38) for early access to the videos, plus other perks, like the chance to meet the couple for dinner and a sail, perhaps, if La Vagabonde comes to their town.\n\nCarausu and Whitelum\u2019s living costs are moderate. Carausu estimated they might spend $400 (\u00a3310) every two weeks on groceries in places where they can catch their own fish, and the same amount every two months or so on diesel fuel. They run their engine as little as possible and charge their batteries with solar and wind power.\n\nStill, boat maintenance is expensive. Conventional wisdom says that, once a boat is more than two years old, it costs 15 per cent of its purchase price every year. Their elegant and airy new boat, a 48-ft Outremer, is about 2\u00bd years old, and lists at over \u00a3600,000. After having seen one in Los Roques, an archipelago off Venezuela, Whitelum wooed the company, which built a boat designed specially for the couple, and arranged a lease they could pay monthly at a slightly discounted rate.\n\nOn forums like Reddit, fans have debated the couple\u2019s good fortune. Have they sold out? Are they still relatable? Could you learn the craft of sailing from their videos if they\u2019re in such a high-end craft? But, as one poster noted, \u201c People think that just anyone can get a GO PRO and do a YouTube Channel, get on Patreon and make hay. It just does not work this way. It actually takes quite a bit of on-screen talent and editing skills to get viewers ... I\u2019ll admit it. I just like these people.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Whitelum skipped university and started a business digging trenches for the Australian Phone Company before going to work on oil rigs for eight years. Between three-week shifts, he backpacked around the world, intent on saving his money.\n\nAt the start of a trip through South America, he broke his neck in the surf at Copacabana beach in Rio. The surgery temporarily paralysed his vocal cords, and he couldn\u2019t speak or work for six months. Although he had sailed only once, a miserable three days beating into the wind off Southern Australia, Whitelum says it was his dream to buy a boat and learn how to handle it.\n\n\u201cOK, so you\u2019re going to be alone forever, then,\u201d a friend predicted darkly.\n\n\u201cWhat About the Sharks?\u201d\n\nCarausu had been a tomboy with two older brothers, who learned to ride a motorcycle before she ever got on a bike; she learned to drive a motorboat before graduating from high school, where her curriculum included marine studies and aquaculture.\n\nShe then worked as a dive master in Queensland, living in a Kia van she painted and fixed up \u2013 until the fateful trip to Ios. A travel company had hired her after seeing the videos she posted on Facebook, and she left the job two weeks early to go sailing with Whitelum.\n\nThey had known each other barely more than a month when he said, \u201cIt would be great if you\u2019d sail the world with me.\u201d Carausu decided to sell all her belongs and go for it. \u201cI had always hung around guys who didn\u2019t have any goals, and here was this sailor guy who just got stuff done,\u201d she says. \u201cI knew he was going to go far, and I wanted to be a part of that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about the waves? What about the sharks?\u201d Carausu remembers her mother asking. \u201cDeep-ocean sailing, for her, was a combination of Jaws and The Perfect Storm.\u201d It was one reason why Carausu began posting reassuring footage of their trip, using a Canon PowerShot.\n\nThe first videos are very much like home movies, charting progress south from the Mediterranean to Cape Verde and then across the Atlantic. \u201cI saw something good in what we were doing,\u201d Carausu says, \u201cand I thought people would be interested. I wanted to put our videos up on YouTube but Riley wouldn\u2019t let me.\u201d But by Malta, a month in, he had relented. Within a few weeks of its posting, their first video had reached over 70,000 views.\n\n\u201cShe was flipping out, and I was like, \u2018Cool, but what does it mean?\u2019 For five months, it was still a hobby,\u201d Whitelum says.\n\nAfter their first Atlantic crossing, funds were low. By the time they reached Grenada, they were broke. As they prepared to fly home to work, having hauled the boat out of the water there, they announced their plans in a video to let their community know that would be the last for a while. Subscribers turned into paying patrons by the hundreds. It took some time, however, for Whitelum to wrap his head around the idea of being crowdfunded. \u201cThat was really hard for me,\u201d he says, \u201ctaking money from strangers.\u201d\n\nOnce their engine was fixed, they rode a nor\u2019easter to the Annapolis Boat Show in Maryland, surfing 30 knots of wind for three nights and four days, to meet up with hundreds of patrons there.\n\nThe filming process typically takes three days; after Lenny\u2019s birth, Carausu hired an editor to make the initial cuts, although she puts the finishing touches on before posting. They hope to keep sailing, boat-school Lenny and continue to make videos \u2013 Kardashians-like, but wholesome and afloat.\n\nCarausu has designed a swimwear line, Vaga Bella Swim, made from recycled, ocean-harvested plastic trash, and plans to donate the proceeds to a charity. \u201cI\u2019ve always been dreaming of the perfect bikini,\u201d she says. \u201cSomething that looks a little bit sexy, but that you can spearfish and dive in without having a body part fall out.\u201d The couple also hope to turn their boat into a vessel with zero or low emissions.\n\nCurrently, they are sailing to Charleston, South Carolina, where they will leave the boat with friends for two months so that they can return home for Christmas. Then they\u2019ll take the boat through the Panama Canal and across the Pacific to Australia, a first for them, and circumnavigate their home country, with all the challenges that will bring.\n\n\u201cOne year on a boat is like 10 on land,\u201d Whitelum said. \u201cNow, it\u2019s as if we\u2019ve been married for 50 years. If you\u2019re not sure about a partner, take them sailing.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 New York Times", "description": "They met in Ios, Greece, locking eyes across the town square, both in their 20s then.
