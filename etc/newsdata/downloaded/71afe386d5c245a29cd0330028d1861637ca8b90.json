(Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nZachary Karabell is the author of several books, including \u201cThe Leading Indicators: A Short History of the Numbers That Rule Our World.\u201d\n\nOf the various memes purporting to demystify the Trump era, one that has proven resilient is invocation of the Roman republic\u2019s decline as harbinger for the fraying of the United States today: Last year, Edmond Watts published \u201cMortal Republic: How Rome Fell into Tyranny.\u201d He acknowledges that Rome\u2019s fall \u201cdoesn\u2019t prescribe what the future will be for us,\u201d but embraces the idea that its decay \u201coffers a chilling lesson to modern Americans.\u201d In March, a website called \u201cFabius Maximus,\u201d after the famed leader of the republic in the 3rd century B.C., published a post headlined \u201cAmerica isn\u2019t falling like the Roman Empire. It\u2019s worse.\u201d And last month, in a lengthy essay for New York magazine, Andrew Sullivan noted that our Founding Fathers were particularly concerned with Rome\u2019s fall from republic to autocracy and set President Trump up as a would-be Caesar or Pompey \u2014 a charismatic, polarizing figure with bare regard for rule of law. Sullivan bemoaned the accelerated erosion of Republican and Democratic norms during Trump\u2019s tenure and warned that \u201cIn America, the question of whether this history will repeat itself hangs ominously in the air.\u201d\n\nNot really. What hangs in the air, rather, is the willingness of too many to make those facile comparisons. Rome is, truly, ancient history.\n\nThe Trump\u2019s-America-as-ancient-Rome formulation is a misuse of antiquity as a barometer for the future. Sullivan, for instance, acknowledged the distinctions between Rome then and America now but suggested there exists in the past certain templates that offer a preview of our present and future. He charted a Rome that once exalted the virtues of civic responsibility but, starting in the late 2nd century B.C., was racked by conflicts between populists appealing to the people and then by powerful elites who built their own factions and armies and were dedicated to maximizing their own power, a multi-decade process that culminated in the rise and eventual assassination of Julius Caesar.\n\n[Yes, Trump is undignified. Demagogues have to be.]\n\nThe Roman lesson is appealing in part because America\u2019s Founding Fathers such as Thomas Jefferson were steeped in the literature of ancient Rome. In a letter late in his life to John Adams, Jefferson wrote \u201cI have been amusing myself latterly with reading the voluminous letters of Cicero. They certainly breathe the present effusions of an exalted patriot, while the parricide Caesar is left in odious contrast. \u2026 I ask myself what was that government which the virtues of Cicero were so zealous to restore, & the ambition of Caesar to subvert?\u201d For the Founders, republican Rome was an endless reference point. Benjamin Franklin quipped that the Constitutional Convention had laid the foundations for a republic, \u201cif you can keep it,\u201d acutely aware that republics have a way of descending into autocracy, especially if they become rich and powerful, then bloated and corrupt. That notion is woven into American lore, and is now seeing a resurgence, not only on the left, but also on the right: Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, a recent Trump appointee, just published book titled \u201cA Republic, If You Can Keep It.\u201d\n\nBut just because our Founders worried that the path of Rome might lie in America\u2019s future, doesn\u2019t mean the analogy holds. As classicist Mary Beard explained in her book, \u201cSPQR: A History of Ancient Rome,\u201d much of the traditional history of republican Rome, as written by ancients, is itself highly questionable in terms of historical veracity. They themselves were often partisans of a certain vision of the Republic and of certain factions in its later days, not to mention stylists concerned about the verve of their narratives. Much as you would not want to rely on a vision of the present as generated by the best-seller list, these sources \u2014 vital though they are \u2014 have their own issues. Using them as touchstones reinforces what is sometimes whispered in the academy, that history doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but historians do repeat one another.\n\n[Peace with North Korea seems unlikely. But peace often does ahead of time.]\n\nThe then-and-now juxtaposition obscures more than it illuminates. As Sullivan noted, the levels of violence and discord in Rome dwarf anything that might be acceptable today. In one episode, in 133 B.C., Tiberius Gracchus, one of the early populists of the republic, and hundreds of his followers were killed by a mob, led by members of the Roman Senate. In another, the military commander Sulla assumed the title and powers of \u201ddictator\u201d in 82 B.C. and killed thousands in order to consolidate his authority.\n\nThe we-are-Rome cohort recognizes that the United States today does not have factions with their own armies (rogue militia groups notwithstanding) nor camps beholden to one landed leader willing and able to violently eliminate fellow citizens, but they still feel, as Sullivan put it, that \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to review the demise of the Roman republic and not be struck by the parallel dynamics in America in 2019.\u201d Actually, it\u2019s quite possible; Charlottesville was violent and extreme and tragic by today\u2019s standards. One person died.\n\nYet, for the we-are-Rome cohort, the lines blur: the Trumpian erosion of norms; the yawning gap between the few immensely wealthy and the rest; the gerrymandered trampling of democracy; the venality of elected officials in Washington; all add up to Rome redux.\n\nOne of the most pungent rebuttals of that view comes from Beard. In Britain, she is something of a left-wing firebrand, but she cautions against simplistic comparisons. She thinks that the issue of citizenship (read: immigration) in the later Roman republic offer intriguing lessons for America\u2019s present immigration debate, but, overall, resists easy parallels. Though it\u2019s tempting to see Trump as a Julius Caesar (who both ended Rome\u2019s republic and, via his assassination, ushered in the Roman Empire) she averred: \u201cI don\u2019t think Rome has got any direct lesson, I\u2019m happy to say, for the United States. And we shouldn\u2019t be too certain what kind of crisis we\u2019re in, or even if we\u2019re in a crisis.\u201d Beard embraces the role of historian as a forensic analyst of known outcomes . That is impossible in the present. \u201cIf we knew how to analyze what we were going through, at the time we were going through it, we wouldn\u2019t need historians.\u201d\n\nAs scholars Ernest May and Richard Neustadt warned years ago in \u201cThinking in Time: The Uses of History for Decision-Makers,\u201d the past is a dangerous temptation for analysts and commentators, and if you think you\u2019ve found a golden analogy for the present, you\u2019re almost certainly wrong and will almost certainly choose policies that make matters worse. History should be used, they said, to inform processes, not decisions. During the Cuban Missile Crisis, when President John F. Kennedy and his team recalled the events that led to World War I, they did not treat 1914 as an exact parallel but instead used it to remind themselves that that bad decisions made precipitously can have disastrous and irreversible consequences.\n\nCertainly, excavating the history of the Roman republic can help us understand the multiple pathways the present offers, but not with any clairvoyance about specific outcomes. Some of the challenges of that age are recurring human ones: how to balance individual freedoms with collective needs, determining what the rights and responsibilities of citizens are and what powers government should have. That\u2019s a far cry, however, from using ancient Rome as a road map, template or crystal ball for identifying latter-day Ciceros and Caesars. It can be comforting to choose false certainty over real uncertainty, even if it says we are on a road to ruination. But whatever our apprehensions, our republic\u2019s next chapter remains to be written; ancient Rome\u2019s conclusion lies in the past.", "description": "The Trump-as-Caesar analogy is tempting, but misguided.", "authors": ["Zachary Karabell", "Zachary Karabell Is The Author Of Several Books", "Including", "The Leading Indicators", "A Short History Of The Numbers That Rule Our World.", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/a0Xn2W3NEMqFG-bIRcqzypnJMh4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KJGR7QW5QMI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
