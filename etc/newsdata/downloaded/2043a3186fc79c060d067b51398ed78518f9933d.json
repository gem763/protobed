Dams have now dropped slightly below the 80% mark, with the decline anticipated to accelerate over the summer months. This year so far, has been another drier-than-average year, and assuming this trend will continue, it is important society remains conscientious of its water use,\" said Limberg.", "description": "Cape Town\u2019s water consumption this week has exceeded the current 650 million litres per day limit.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8226/ccd3554729d6433695568570566161f2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
