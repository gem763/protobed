(Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)\n\nColumnist\n\nWhen Randolph Nelson is having breakfast \u2014 Fruity Pebbles in a recycled takeout container \u2014 outside his front door, he greets the commuters walking past.\n\n\u201cGood morning.\u201d\n\n\u201cHappy Monday.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood morning to ya.\u201d\n\nAnd \u201c97 percent of the people just put their heads down and hurry past, like I\u2019m a piece of trash they want to get away from,\u201d said Nelson, whose front door closes with a zipper.\n\nHe wishes they\u2019d stop and talk to him a bit, outside his tent in a D.C. encampment, in one of the city\u2019s hippest, most rapidly gentrifying neighborhoods. He\u2019s funny, wry and has interesting stories about growing up in Washington.\n\n\n\nAn encampment in the underpass on K Street NE. (Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cIf they could just take five friggin\u2019 minutes. Three minutes. Or how about 60 seconds to see that I\u2019m a person, too. I was a millionaire at 17, I pumped gas when I was 30. I was a drug dealer when I was young and worked 10 years for a maintenance crew for the USDA,\u201d he told me on a morning when person after person walked by him.\n\n[Letter critical of D.C. homeless encampments stirs controversy]\n\nBut most of his new neighbors don\u2019t want to talk to him. They want him gone.\n\nBecause the way they see it, it\u2019s not a friendly Mr. Randolph\u2019s Neighborhood they\u2019re passing through on the way to and from their luxury condos.\n\n\u201cUsed and bloody hypodermic needles and other drug paraphernalia, rotting food, trash, broken glass, public nudity, prostitution, sales of illegal drugs, and human urine and feces are encountered by those whose routes take them by the encampments and pervade the space in which encamped individuals are living,\u201d wrote NoMa Business Improvement District President Robin-Eve Jasper, in a public letter decrying the state of those underpass encampments.\n\n\n\nHarrison uses a wooden base to keep his tent dry and above any flooding. (Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)\n\nThese underpasses \u2014 where train tracks pass over M, L and K streets in Northeast Washington \u2014 are at the heart of the city\u2019s gentrification clash.\n\nThey are dark corridors of metal and stone that are an unavoidable walking path connecting the condos to the rest of the city. The business district leaders have done backflips trying to make that path pleasant, filling two of the tunnels with artsy light sculpture projects they held international design competitions to create. They got the encampments cleared out, all in the name of public art. There were even cocktail events to welcome the bright, playful light installations into the urine-soaked underpasses they insist on calling art parks.\n\n[The new D.C., with tent cities outside a store that sells expensive tents]\n\nIt took less than four months for the tents on L Street to return, now illuminated by \u201cLightweave\u201d overhead.\n\nTo the homeless men and women who camp there, the underpasses are a no-brainer for safe and relatively dry shelter, now with decor.\n\n\u201cA lot of us out here are working. And this here is close to our jobs,\u201d Nelson explained, giving me the rundown on his neighborhood.\n\n\u201cNow right here is me and my brother. We do odd jobs and we sell water and Gatorade over on K Street. Across the street over there is Tommy and J.R., he said, pointing to the tents that were zipped up for the day, their residents off to work. \u201cTommy has a construction job. J.R. is working at the hospital. Next to that is Pucci. She works at a detailing place.\u201d\n\nYes, there is drug addiction. And yes, there is mental illness, Nelson said. \u201cOf course, it\u2019s not all good here. If you\u2019re here, you\u2019ve got problems,\u201d he said. And yes, it\u2019s dirty and it stinks (what underpass isn\u2019t putrid)?\n\nBut for most of the people living there, the issue is a profound lack of affordable housing, created by the breakneck development that has made room for places with cute names like NoMa.\n\nIf you don\u2019t believe it, look at a recent study that determined the District is, hands-down, the absolute worst place in the United States for displacement caused by gentrification.\n\nIn a span of 13 years, more than 20,000 African American Washingtonians have been booted by primarily white, high-income new residents, according to a study by the National Community Reinvestment Coalition.\n\nAdd to that, another recent study found that the District is one of the most difficult places in the nation right now to establish new and affordable housing.\n\n\u201cWashington is experiencing a boom with sustained demand for new multifamily in the top third of national metro, yet ranks near the bottom of major markets for barriers to new apartment development. . . . Affordable housing requirements are heavy with few mitigation policies,\u201d according to a 2019 study by the Arlington, Va.-based National Apartment Association.\n\n[The hidden homeless who live in a Northeast D.C. storage]\n\nAnd here\u2019s the kick in the gut. This place is hot because of the urban vibe, the cool, gritty graffiti, old-school city-warehouse hipster factor. All this, with yoga and coffee and salad.\n\n\u201cI call it \u2018Baby New York,\u2019 \u201d Nelson said. \u201cAnd I see them, walking like they\u2019re in their own big-city fantasy. But you know what? We\u2019re part of the city, too. This is part of being in a big city \u2014 seeing people who are struggling and who were born here.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s what makes letters like the one from Jasper so upsetting. People in encampments are not inanimate nuisances. They are not a crooked street sign that can be fixed or a clump of weeds that can be uprooted.\n\nSolutions have to do with active engagement in city policies and politics, in voting and caring about what happens to all Washingtonians. It\u2019s about thinking outside your own waterfall-quartz-countertops comfort zone.\n\nNelson, for now, just wants to be treated like a person while he tries to right his life.\n\nAs he says that, here comes Kara McGrath, 28, with her iced latte, cute outfit and adorable black and white dog, Olive, on their way to the dog park.\n\nNelson\u2019s neighbors say good morning to her. She returns the greeting, and they banter about the dog. \u201cShe\u2019s 6 months old,\u201d McGrath said.\n\n\u201cNow see that? This is beautiful,\u201d Nelson said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re my neighbors,\u201d said McGrath, who has been following the tensions and arguments over the underpasses since she moved into the area two years ago. \u201cI don\u2019t see you as a nuisance. . . . I don\u2019t see harassment.\u201d\n\nSee that? Be like Kara.\n\nTwitter: @petulad", "description": "The clash between the city\u2019s homeless population and wealthy newcomers is escalating.", "authors": ["Petula Dvorak", "Local Columnist", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/3ZWF0GcjfBbl_K0_HVFcQtxfq-4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GKXVVSGJZAI6TFQVR4NDFFROAQ.jpg"}
