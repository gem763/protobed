This follows IAC's August announcement that it was considering a separation of Match Group.\n\nIn the proposed transaction, IAC would effectively distribute its shares in Match Group to IAC's stockholders, resulting in two independent public companies. The transaction, which would be structured to be tax-free to IAC, Match Group and their respective stockholders, would also eliminate the dual-class common stock structure at Match Group, with all pre-transaction stockholders of Match Group and IAC receiving a single class of \"one share/one vote\" capital stock of the resulting Match Group. Pre-transaction stockholders of IAC would receive stock in new IAC replicating their current interest in IAC.\n\nAdditional aspects of the proposal are described in an amendment to IAC's Schedule 13D with respect to Match Group, filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n\"Today IAC proposed an important first step in the separation of Match Group from IAC,\" said Joey Levin, CEO, IAC. \"IAC is confident that the proposal communicated to the Match Group special committee provides strong footing for Match Group to begin its journey as a thriving, independent company.\"\n\n\"As it relates to evaluating our ownership stake in ANGI Homeservices,\" Mr. Levin continued, \"we don't currently expect to turn our attention to the question of a spin-off until a Match Group transaction has been completed.\"\n\nIAC's willingness to proceed with any Match Group separation transaction is conditioned upon the approval of the IAC Board of Directors; a favorable recommendation of the Match Group special committee; any required approvals of stockholders of both IAC and Match Group; and approval by the disinterested stockholders of Match Group, among other customary conditions.\n\nAbout IAC\n\n\n\nIAC (IAC) builds companies. We are guided by curiosity, a questioning of the status quo, and a desire to invent or acquire new products and brands.
