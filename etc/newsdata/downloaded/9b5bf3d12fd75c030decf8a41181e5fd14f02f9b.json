She also reported that Johnson would write to the EU to request an extension to Brexit if the Letwin amendment passed.", "description": "Government will not participate in Brexit deal vote if Letwin amendment passes - BBC", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9I05O_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
