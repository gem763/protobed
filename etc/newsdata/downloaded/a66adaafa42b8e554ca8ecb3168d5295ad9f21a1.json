Their brand of open, attacking play was spectacular to watch as they used quick passing and intelligent running lines to imprint pockmarks in the Scottish defensive lines.\n\nDespite some spirited resistance in the second half from Gregor Townsend's wounded team, the tries from Matsushima, Inagaki and two from Fukuoka were enough to ensure a seven-point win which places Japan into the knockout stages of a World Cup for the first time, and hands Scotland the ignominy of an early flight home.\n\nAfter the game, Japanese captain Michael Leitch impressed upon the supporters exactly how much the typhoon and the associated chaos surrounding it had resolved their team spirt to claim the win.\n\nHear from @JRFURugby's captain Michael Leitch in an emotional, proud and upbeat interview \ud83d\udc4f\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udde3\"Our heart goes out to all the people suffering at the moment...Today was about emotion and physicality.\" #RWC2019#JPNvSCO#RWCYokohamapic.twitter.com/2rFJtUMLao \u2014 Rugby World Cup (@rugbyworldcup) October 13, 2019\n\n\"I'd just like to thank everybody who turned up tonight,\" the emotional skipper said. \"It's a tough time at the moment with the typhoon, but I'd like to thank the people that made this game happen.\n\n\"To anyone that is suffering at the minute with the typhoon, this game is all for you guys...\n\n\"The crowd was massive for us. Today was more than just a game for us. There was talk about this game not happening, so I'd just like to thank the people that made the game happen.\n\nJapan players thank fans with bow after beating Scotland to reach their first Rugby World Cup Quarter-final #RWC2019#JPNvSCOpic.twitter.com/7jTpJai9Mh \u2014 Rugby World Cup (@rugbyworldcup) October 13, 2019\n\n\"Our heart goes out to all the people suffering with the typhoon...\n\n\"I'm incredibly proud, from the very start we played with our heart. Today wasn't about skill, it was about emotion and physicality. I think we showed that today.\n\n\"We know we're representing Asia, we're representing Japan, we're representing Tier 2. We're going to give it everything in the next couple of games.\"\n\nHear from @JRFURugby's coach Jamie Joseph as he reflects on a brilliant victory \ud83d\udc4f\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udde3\"There's a lot of people that have done a lot of hard work. The guys have a lot of belief now and realise what it actually takes to get across the line.\" #RWC2019#JPNvSCO#RWCYokohamapic.twitter.com/7lroHvoNYf \u2014 Rugby World Cup (@rugbyworldcup) October 13, 2019\n\nThe fact that the match even took place was impressive, given pictures from the ground on Friday showing the toll the stadium had taken from the typhoon. Two feet of water had flooded the tunnel area, forcing players to wade through it to get to the pitch for training as doubts persisted as to whether or not the game would go ahead.\n\nAlso on rt.com Rugby World Cup stars forced to 'swim' to training in typhoon-hit Japan (VIDEO)\n\nBut go ahead it did, though the Scots may well wish that it hadn't.\n\nJapan will now advance to a quarter final date next weekend with South Africa, the team they beat in the same tournament four years ago in what was hailed at the time as one of the biggest sporting shocks in history, and with this team clearly improved since then and on another considerable high, the Springboks will be more than a little concerned about the prospect of lightning striking twice.", "description": "The captain of the Japanese rugby team dedicated his side's 28-21 win over Scotland to those suffering from the impact of the devastating Typhoon Hagibis, the strongest storm to make landfall in the country in more than 50 years.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5da3358485f5401c055ada6d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
