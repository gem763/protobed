I wasn\u2019t happy for about a year until I got involved in internet startups. I liked it because it was a fast-paced business - there were a lot of risks.\u201d\n\nHe realized he wanted to be more entrepreneurial. His wife, Sheryl, got him a home brewing kit, and it became his at-home hobby. In 2007, he went to brewing school in Chicago, and finished his studies in Germany. He started volunteering at a brewery in Mass., worked his way up to a brewer\u2019s assistant and eventually raised close to $1 million to start up his own brewery back in Jacksonville in 2013 he called Veterans United Craft Brewery.\n\n\u201cI wanted to take everything I learned from the service and take that same pride and passion and put it into a new company to sell beers at the brewery,\u201d he said.\n\nHis staff of nearly a dozen workers are primarily veterans who served in the U.S. Navy and Air Force. And the beer is served up with patriotic branding, like the Raging Blonde Ale, a golden blonde, malt ale with World War II icon Rosie the Riveter on the bottle. Veterans get 10% off beer in the tap room, and a six pack of his beers cost between $10 and $11 in grocery stores.\n\nLike Gamble's, many veteran-owned breweries provide work to local veterans who need jobs, a crucial service considering just one in four veterans said they had a job lined up after discharge, while others have said it can take up to a year to find employment.\n\nMore than one in 10 U.S. business owners are military veterans, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. And a number of venture capital funds have made it their mission to help veterans start their own businesses. The Veterans\u2019 Opportunity Fund (VOF) helps fund businesses that are started, owned or managed by veterans of the U.S. armed forces, and investments can reach up to $3 million.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nKevin Ryan, a West Point graduate and former Army commander, started Service Brewing Co. in Savannah, Ga. in 2014, with the help of more than two dozen investors, many of them Army, Navy and Marine Corps. veterans. He raised $2.5 million to get his brewery off the ground, and today he sells around 3,000 barrels a year.\n\n\u201cI have an engineering background, and as soon as I started doing home brew I was like, \u2018wow this is great I can build things; I have a recipe.\u2019\"\n\nService Brewing Co. sells year-round brews like its medium-bodied, Ground Pounder Pale Ale, and a hop-forward Battlewagon Double IPA with floral and pine aromatics.
