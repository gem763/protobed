He\u2019s within his rights to have found Mick Mulvaney\u2019s admission yesterday damning. It\u2019s that his entire political brand already depends upon opposing Trump, especially on moral grounds, and yet he persists in the charade that there was some \u201cdark night of the soul\u201d for him in arriving at this position. It\u2019d be like Hannity declaring, after careful thought and lots of prayer, that he must reluctantly conclude that Trump is completely innocent of everything he\u2019s been accused of.\n\nYou can almost feel Kasich waiting for CNN\u2019s anchor to congratulate him on his courage. How many times does he have to stress how hard this was for him before Ana Cabrera will farking applaud him already?\n\nMeanwhile, on the far end of the opposite spectrum within the GOP\u2026\n\nThe Trump campaign is so angry about Mick Mulvaney\u2019s appearance yesterday that they\u2019re \u2026. fundraising off of it pic.twitter.com/rJdhNIwtZ5 \u2014 Miriam Elder (@MiriamElder) October 18, 2019\n\n\u201cGet over it\u201d is what Mulvaney said yesterday at the podium to people who objected to his spirited defense of a quid pro quo with Ukraine involving military aid and the CrowdStrike server. That was three hours before he put out a statement insisting that he\u2019d never said any such thing and that your lying eyes and ears had deceived you. Looks like the Trump campaign is back to the first position, that there was in fact a quid pro quo and that\u2019s perfectly fine and right. By the end of the year, the crowds at MAGA rallies will be chanting \u201cQUID PRO QUO\u201d as their new cheer. If you\u2019re willing to say it out loud, it can\u2019t be wrong, right?", "description": "\"I say it with great sadness.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/jk.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
