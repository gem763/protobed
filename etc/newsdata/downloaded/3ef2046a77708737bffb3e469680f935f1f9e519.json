Meanwhile the average hourly wage increased by 2.9%. However, as uncertainty continues to increase amid ongoing market volatility and trade tensions, Al-Hussainy admits it\u2019s sometimes difficult to gauge the direction of the Fed. He says we\u2019ve \u201cpriced in a pretty aggressive Fed through the middle of next year, another 80 basis points or so in terms of easing... there isn\u2019t a lot of confidence in the Fed\u2019s ability to reflate the economy at the moment.\u201d\n\nWASHINGTON, Sept. 18, 2019 -- U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks during a press conference in Washington D.C., the United States, on Sept. 18, 2019. U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday lowered interest rates by 25 basis points amid growing risks and uncertainties stemming from trade tensions and a global economic slowdown, following a rate cut in July that was its first in more a decade.

Al-Hussainy believes \u201cwe are starting to see certain parts of the economy respond\u201d like the housing sector. Meanwhile, he says interest-rate sensitive sectors in the U.S. economy are still reacting to the Fed tightening that happened over the course of the past three years and the \u201cfull impact of the easing\u201d won\u2019t be seen until next year, admittedly saying \u201cit\u2019s too early to tell.\u201d\n\nBoston Fed President Eric Rosengren also weighed in on the rate cuts in a recent interview with Yahoo Finance\u2019s Brian Cheung. \u201cWe changed interest rates and those interest rates are national interest rates, we don\u2019t charge a different interest rate in San Francisco than West Virginia, so in terms of the distributional elements, certain parts of the country are affected differently by higher interest rates, something like autos is not going to do nearly as well, so there are distributional effects of what we do, but our jobs really is to get it right for inflation and unemployment and we have to leave the fiscal policy to get the distributional part of the equation right,\u201d Rosengren said.\n\nInvestors are pricing in a 73% chance of another rate cut at the next Fed meeting set to take place October 29 to October 30. The results of that meeting will be out October 30 at 2 p..m. ET.\n\nBrooke DiPalma is a producer for Yahoo Finance.
