According to CEO Matias Viel, it enables bees to do seven times more flights in cold temperatures than they ordinarily would be able to without the formula.\n\nBees are responsible for pollinating nearly one-third of all crops worldwide, but this past winter saw the highest number of bee colony losses on record as pesticides, parasites and climate change make it harder for them to survive. That's a massive uptick amid a dramatic decline in the bee population that's threatening the almost $20 billion bees contribute to US crop production annually.Bees are responsible for pollinating nearly one-third of all crops worldwide, but this past winter saw the highest number of bee colony losses on record as pesticides, parasites and climate change make it harder for them to survive.\n\n\"If you have bad weather, or cold temperatures during that period, and you have a low amount of bee activity hours, your crop won't be that good. We think that with healthier bees and then with a stronger immune system, bees can work better and perform better,\" Viel told CNN Business.\n\nBeekeepers feed the bees the plant-based formula, which contains sugar, water and proprietary ingredients, about once a week.\n\nRead More", "description": "One company wants to help farmers adapt to a world of rapidly declining bee populations.", "authors": ["Millie Dent"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191015141619-01-beeflow-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
