Bezos owns around 12% of Amazon\u2019s total shares, meaning that his net worth could fall by as much as $10bn.\n\nThat would push him below Bill Gates, whose net worth of $107bn currently makes him the world\u2019s second-richest man, according to Bloomberg.\n\nBezos overtook Gates on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index in October 2017, in part because Gates has donated tens of billions to philanthropic causes.\n\nREAD MORE: Mobile networks to invest \u00a3500m to rid UK of signal black spots\n\nGates still holds a 1% stake in Microsoft. Shares in the software company have surged so far this year due to the continued success of its cloud platform Azure and social media platform LinkedIn, each of which have seen strong revenue growth.\n\nBezos on Thursday defended the company\u2019s decision to invest in Amazon\u2019s one-day delivery service, which enables subscribers to its premium Prime service to get more than 10 million items delivered within 24 hours.\n\nAmazon has long prioritised growth over profits. \u201cIt\u2019s a big investment, and it\u2019s the right long-term decision for customers,\u201d Bezos said.\n\n\u201cCustomers love the transition of Prime from two days to one day\u2014they\u2019ve already ordered billions of items with free one-day delivery this year.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Barclays counts cost of PPI and warns outlook 'more challenging'\n\nWhile noting that the investments were necessary, analysts suggested that they would continue to weigh on the company\u2019s profitability. Amazon had previously charged extra for the speedy delivery.\n\nRevenue in the company\u2019s third-quarter fell to $3.2bn, compared to $3.7bn in the same period last year. The company\u2019s estimates for the final quarter of the year also came in below expectations.\n\nAnalysts had forecast that sales during the holiday period would come in at more than $87bn, but Amazon said they would fall within the $80bn to $86.5bn range on Thursday, spooking investors about its capacity to maintain bumper growth.", "description": "Shares in the e-commerce giant plunged as much as 9% in after-hours trading on Thursday after the company reported its first profit decline in two years.", "authors": ["Edmund Heaphy", "Finance", "News Reporter"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/jGOwg5Vy4jjrYFdH40eLjw--~B/aD0yOTcwO3c9NDUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/6a86ed50-f707-11e9-aa6b-e2c4c72cf9b6", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
