Not only 100 percent but actually 1,000 percent. . . . Your skills and knowledge. . . . You are a great teacher for us.\u201d The last time he was in New York, Zelensky says, \u201cI stayed at the Trump Tower.\u201d\n\nTrump accepts the kowtowing as his due. \u201cIt\u2019s very nice of you to say that,\u201d he responds with noblesse oblige, noting several times that \u201cwe do a lot for Ukraine.\u201d\n\nThey talk about Europe and Russia and Ukraine\u2019s desire for more U.S. weapons. And it is then, at the top of the third page of the five-page rough transcript, that Trump introduces the subject that will dominate the rest of the exchange and provide its only substance.\n\n\u201cI would like you to do us a favor,\u201d he says.\n\nPresidential scholars and officials from previous White Houses said they could remember nothing like this conversation, unclassified and released by Trump on Wednesday to rebut charges that he in essence offered Zelensky continued U.S. support in exchange for dirt on Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cThis is nothing like a conversation between Richard Nixon or Henry Kissinger and a foreign leader,\u201d said Ken Hughes of the Miller Center at the University of Virginia, an expert on Nixon during the Vietnam War and Watergate.\n\n\u201cNixon had very detailed knowledge when he spoke to foreign leaders. He could be subtle in negotiations and still get his point across,\u201d Hughes said. But \u201cwhen he wanted to dig up dirt on his political adversaries,\u201d Nixon did it at home, he said.\n\nEven President Lyndon B. Johnson, whose vulgarity and pressure tactics are well documented, \u201ctended to be a cautious and careful communicator with world leaders and diplomats, not the gunslinger that he could be with Americans that he knew well,\u201d said Kent Germany of the University of South Carolina. \u201cHe was not going to go rogue and be Lyndon Johnson with these other leaders.\u201d\n\nJon Meacham, author of best-selling books about American history and a biography of President George H.W. Bush, described it as \u201cmore like an Oval Office bull session than a world leader calling a new world leader in a troubled region. It\u2019s illuminating because it probably suggests how Trump talks to everybody.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn my experience with these kinds of documents, there might be one or two lines in a five- or six-page [transcript] that are tantalizing,\u201d Meacham said. \u201cThis is five pages of nothing but.\u201d\n\nA former senior official in one modern White House who sat in on dozens of such calls noted that they are \u201ca reflection of the president\u2019s personality.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have had very different presidents,\u201d the former official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to avoid becoming involved in the current political upheaval.\n\nIf Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky brings to mind any previous presidential exchanges, they are ones that Trump himself has had.\n\nOne of the earliest minor scandals of Trump\u2019s presidency was the leak of two telephone conversations with foreign counterparts \u2014 then-President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull \u2014 during the first days of his presidency.\n\nIn both cases, Trump seemed concerned about how bad their policies might make him look. If he agreed to honor a deal made by his predecessor to accept more than 1,000 migrants who landed in Australia, \u201cI look like a dope,\u201d Trump fretted. \u201cThis is going to kill me,\u201d he told Turnbull. \u201cI am the world\u2019s greatest person that does not want to let people in the country. . . . It makes me look so bad, and I have only been here a week,\u201d he said before abruptly hanging up on the Australian leader.\n\nHe bragged to Pe\u00f1a Nieto about his electoral victory, saying that \u201cno one got the people in the rallies as big as I did.\u201d Mexico, he said, had been \u201cknocking the hell out of us\u201d by allowing drug lords to cross the border.\n\n\u201cI have been saying I wanted to tax people that treated us unfairly at the border, and Mexico is treating us unfairly,\u201d Trump said.\n\nIn the transcript of an April 2017 call, leaked in the Philippines, Trump said he had called to congratulate President Rodrigo Duterte, whose government was charged with gunning down suspected drug users and dealers in the streets, for doing an \u201cunbelievable job on the drug problem.\u201d\n\nWhen Duterte raised the problem of North Korea, Trump asked if he thought Kim Jong Un was unstable. \u201cHe is not stable,\u201d Duterte replied. \u201cHe keeps on smiling when he explodes a rocket.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, he has got the powder, [sic] but he doesn\u2019t have the delivery system. All his rockets are crashing,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe have a lot of firepower over there. We have two submarines \u2014 the best in the world \u2014 we have two nuclear submarines \u2014 not that we want to use them at all. . . . He could be crazy, so we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d\n\n\u201cSay hello to the people of the Philippines for me,\u201d he said.\n\nTo the extent one can tell from leaked transcripts and descriptions by other governments, Trump\u2019s private persona in conversations with world leaders is remarkably like his public persona at home. Some foreign leaders have described him as rude, stubborn and uninformed.\n\nBut the Zelensky call was unique in the known universe of Trump behavior in its apparent attempt to use the power of the U.S. presidency to damage his political adversaries.\n\nBoth the content and tone of the exchange, Meacham said, are \u201ca rare instance of a president using a diplomatic call for quite personal political advantage.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are diplomatic calls, there are leader-to-leader rapport maintenance calls, and then there\u2019s Trump. And Trump, in my reading, in a way I have not seen, has conscripted a foreign leader into his intimate political circle.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is an extreme example of his freewheeling style,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not as though he even knew the guy,\u201d Meacham said of Zelensky, whom Trump had called two months earlier to congratulate him on his presidential election.\n\nAnother unusual aspect of the conversation is that Trump appeared to have conducted it from the White House residence, at 9:03 a.m. on July 25, rather than in the Oval Office.\n\nProtocols for foreign leader calls by the president have a traditional format, said Larry Pfeiffer, a 30-year U.S. intelligence veteran who managed the White House Situation Room during the Obama years.\n\nThe national security adviser or his deputy gives the president a few minutes warning that a scheduled call is about to occur and goes over aide-prepared talking points one more time. The call is connected, and the president speaks into a handset \u2014 with or without an interpreter, as necessary \u2014 while aides in the room listen in. In the Situation Room, two or three typists wearing headsets also listen in, each taking down every word. Later, they reconcile their separate versions into a \u201cworking transcript\u201d that then goes to the National Security Council to finalize.\n\nWhen he began working in the room, \u201cmy predecessor laid out this elaborate process,\u201d Pfeiffer said. When he asked why they didn\u2019t simply record the conversations, \u201cI was told that we stopped recording calls at the White House in 1974,\u201d when Nixon\u2019s Oval Office taping system was revealed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s personal speculation, but I think there\u2019s a certain level of deniability it affords the president if it\u2019s done by human being as opposed to a recording,\u201d he said.", "description": "\u201cI would like you to do us a favor,\u201d the president told his counterpart in July.", "authors": ["Karen Deyoung", "Associate Editor", "Senior National Security Correspondent", "September At Pm", "Karen Deyoung Is Associate Editor", "Senior National Security Correspondent For The Post.
