In the years since, presidents and members of Congress have often said that when the House acts as part of an impeachment inquiry, the executive must yield to its demands for information. John Tyler, the first president subjected to a formal impeachment inquiry (which came to nothing), turned over such demanded documents after the House committee pointed out that impeachment required the power to compel \u201cthe production of all such papers as may be necessary to prove the charges on which the impeachment is founded.\u201d\n\nGarrett Epps: Why \u2018because of sex\u2019 should protect gay people\n\nJames K. Polk, not ordinarily known for his good humor, nonetheless \u201ccheerfully admitted\u201d that\n\nIn [an impeachment] case the safety of the Republic would be the supreme law, and the power of the House in the pursuit of this object would penetrate into the most secret recesses of the Executive Department. It could command the attendance of any and every agent of the Government, and compel them to produce all papers, public or private, official or unofficial, and to testify on oath to all facts within their knowledge.\n\nThe term executive privilege, meaning the privilege to shield certain testimony and documents from disclosure to courts or congressional investigators, did not come into use until the Eisenhower administration; Richard Nixon was the first and so far only president to assert such a privilege against a formal impeachment inquiry. That attempt, as we all know, ended badly in 1974, when the Supreme Court\u2014including three of his appointees\u2014decided that he must turn over the famous \u201csmoking gun\u201d tape to the U.S. District Court for use in a criminal proceeding against seven members of his White House team who had overseen the Watergate burglary and cover-up:\n\nWe conclude that when the ground for asserting privilege as to subpoenaed materials sought for use in a criminal trial is based only on the generalized interest in confidentiality, it cannot prevail over the fundamental demands of due process of law in the fair administration of criminal justice. The generalized assertion of privilege must yield to the demonstrated, specific need for evidence in a pending criminal trial.\n\nThe case was a resounding victory for the rule of law. It was also the death knell for Nixon\u2019s presidency. Within two weeks of turning over the tapes, the 37th president was en route to San Clemente, California, and the 38th, Gerald Ford, had taken the oath.", "description": "The country needs to know the limits of executive privilege.", "authors": ["Garrett Epps", "Professor Of Constitutional Law At The University Of Baltimore"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/AP_19270473508568/facebook.jpg?1569943628", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
