Bloomberg\n\nMyer and Harvey Norman are among the leading companies scrambling to tweak their executive pay models in an effort to head off a shareholder revolt via a second strike which triggers a board spill.\n\nMyer and Karoon Gas suffered second strikes last year but their directors defeated the resulting spill motions, resetting the clock and taking them out of the AGM shooting gallery this year.\n\nThat leaves 14 top companies still vulnerable to second strikes this year, after Westfield and Automotive Holdings were taken over and delisted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe banks and AMP have been left stranded without clear guidelines on pay because the prudential regulator is setting new executive pay rules for financial firms which push for a weighting of 50 per cent for non-financial metrics. Investors have made plain they hate non-financial metrics for pay.\n\nDearth of diversity\n\nThe Australian Council of Superannuation Investors said it would recommend the industry super sector target David Teoh's TPG Telecom this year because there isn't any women on the company's board.\n\nThere remain seven top 200 companies with no women on their boards and ACSI said that would be a key focus this year.\n\n\u201cInvestors have been crystal clear when it comes to greater gender diversity on boards \u2013 zero women boards are not fit for purpose,\" the council's CEO Louise Davidson said.\n\n\"ACSI will be recommending a vote against boards that have made no progress on this front following extensive engagement on the issue.\u201d\n\nMs Davidson said the fallout of the Hayne commission and the potential to focus on individual directors was also front of mind.\n\n'Bonus persistence'\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We are all aware of the issue of bonus persistence in the ASX200. Investors will be looking closely this AGM season to ensure pay matches performance.\u201d\n\nShareholder association head of policy Fiona Balzer said it would focus on the makeup of boards this year, after individual directors were singled out last year.\n\n\"We\u2019re focussing on board composition after the Royal Commission, APRA and ASIC findings showed the boards were failing to cut through a lot of data and get to maximum effectiveness,\" she said.\n\nThe ASA said it \"we're challenging ourselves this year to identify target remuneration as well as maximum opportunity\", warning that while some remuneration reports like BHP and CSL are clear others remain opaque.\n\nThe ASA will vote against Brambles' remuneration this week, arguing the executives' fixed pay is generous and the potential variable pay excessive.\n\n\"We\u2019re on the lookout for non-financial indicators we can support as triggers for financial reward \u2013 post royal commission and regulator guidelines \u2013 other than safety and environment metrics, these measures look like a 'gimme' and I don\u2019t think anyone wants that.\"\n\nClimate concerns\n\nHead of proxy firm ISS in Australia Vasili Kolesnikoff pointed to the rise of climate and social resolutions by activists \"signalling some disruption to AGMs and friction with boards on climate and social issues\".\n\nBHP is facing a fresh push from shareholders including superannuation funds and Atlassian founder Mike Cannon-Brookes to suspend its ties with associations including the Minerals Council of Australia, claiming they are failing to do enough on climate change.\n\nAnd Origin has hit back at five climate-related resolutions proposed for its October 1 AGM, telling investors in a 21-page response: \"Origin believes the resolutions requisitioned by a minority of shareholders do not have comprehensive regard to Origin's current targets, policies and practices and many of the assertions lack scientific rigour or peer review or are incorrect.\"", "description": "Board spills are on the cards as directors get ready to face shareholders fired up over issues ranging from pay and bonuses to diversity and climate change.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3778%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_492%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/bd9db25c7af4c24ec422befdbb6862ceb30c93e7", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
