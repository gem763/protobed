We will go ahead with the introduction of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill (WAB) with second reading tomorrow.\n\n\u2018The public want Brexit done \u2013 the Government is determined to pass the PM\u2019s great new deal and get us out of the EU on October 31.\u2019\n\nElsewhere, judges were set to decide whether the unsigned letter sent by the PM asking for a Brexit extension complied with the Benn Act, or if he is in contempt of court \u2013 but delayed their decision.\n\nIt is unclear whether another vote could go ahead before the October 31 deadline.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
