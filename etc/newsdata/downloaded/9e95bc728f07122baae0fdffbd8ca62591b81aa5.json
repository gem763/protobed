Then five days later, Unai Emery names Xhaka as captain anyway.\n\n\u2018Emery is as much to blame as anyone. If you let the players pick their skipper, then it becomes a popularity contest and that is not what leadership is about.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve never had a manager who decided the captaincy that way and, for me, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is still the safer bet.\u2019\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nXhaka is yet to speak out on the ugly scenes that unfolded at the Emirates but Hector Bellerin has taken to social media to offer his support.\n\nThe Arsenal vice-captain said: \u2018We are all humans, we all have emotions, and sometimes it\u2019s not easy dealing with them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It\u2019s time to lift each other up, not to push each other away.
