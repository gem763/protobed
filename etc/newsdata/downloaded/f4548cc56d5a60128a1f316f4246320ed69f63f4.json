Sham was in stable condition, a government spokesman said.\n\nHis group, which organised the million-strong marches in June, plans a march on Sunday in the neighbouring district of Kowloon, but authorities have not yet confirmed it will be permitted.\n\n\u201cIt is not hard to link this incident to a spreading political terror in order to threaten and inhibit the legitimate exercise of natural and legal rights,\u201d the group said in a statement.\n\nSpeaking at the city\u2019s legislature on Thursday, nearly a dozen pro-democracy lawmakers condemned the attack on Sham and said they would continue to protest.\n\n\u201cThis very vicious attack took place practically on the eve of yet another massive protest in Hong Kong on Sunday,\u201d said Claudia Mo.\n\nBloodstains are seen on the sidewalk at the site where the leader of Hong Kong's Civil Human Rights Front Jimmy Sham was attacked in Mong Kok district in Hong Kong, China, October 16, 2019.
