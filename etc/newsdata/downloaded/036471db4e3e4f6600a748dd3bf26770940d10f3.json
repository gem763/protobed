I love watching it.\u201d\n\nBefore she asked Alex: \u201cDidn\u2019t we audition to be on it once?\u201d\n\n(Image: Emma Smith)\n\nThe hunk clarified: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t really an audition, it was just to come down and see where you could fit into the story lines and, I think I even said: \u2018I don\u2019t know how I can fit in with this accent\u2019 I\u2019m not from Essex so. I think it was a really confusing time when we went to go in there, really. I was like, \u2018What we getting asked to go on here for?\u2019\u201d\n\nOlivia told: \u201cWe said: \u2018No, we don\u2019t like drama, we don\u2019t really argue, we\u2019re just quite fun\u2026\u2019\u201d\n\nAlex then dished: \u201cThey were just like: \u2018No\u2019.\u201d\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nOlivia continued: \u201cWe got rejected from TOWIE! But, I don\u2019t mind that, I love watching it, but it is a bit much for us. You can see from our show we\u2019re more about the fun-filled, silly weird vibes!\u201d\n\nIt comes after the couple opened up about the fierce competition between their Love Island co-stars.\n\nThree years after they shot to fame in the villa the pair have admitted they don't envy the 2019 stars in the current climate.\n\n\"It is so competitive now,\" Olivia told The Mirror.\n\n\"They know that there are deals out there to be had. It automatically feels like you should get one if you're the winner or if you come second or whatever.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\n\"Competition is natural because this is the industry,\" added Olivia. \"You just have to carry on trying to stick to your path.\"\n\nAlex agreed, \"We didn't really know what were were going to get when we came out, I reckon there's a few [contestants] this year that will be a lasting success.\n\n\"When you come outside that's the real test. People have different career paths and [relationships] can come under strain,\" he added.\n\n\"I think a lot of them will do really well,\" Olivia agreed. \"Its mad we're still going this far on. We never thought we'd get our own TV show three years after Love Island happened.\n\n\"We're really grateful. It will never sink in.\"", "description": "The husband and wife have lifted the lid on how they met show producers to discuss joining the cast of the ITVbe show", "authors": ["Sara-Aisha Kent", "Image", "Emma Smith", "Pa", "Instagram", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20434481.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Olivia-and-Alex-Bowen.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
