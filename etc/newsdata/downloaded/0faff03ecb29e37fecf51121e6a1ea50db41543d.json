The agency under his direction has tried and failed to prop up struggling coal and nuclear power plants, and has energetically trumpeted oil and gas development while overseeing plans to reduce funding for wind, solar and other forms of renewable energy.\n\nIn recent weeks his role promoting natural gas and coal exports in Ukraine has come under congressional scrutiny amid attention to Mr. Trump\u2019s political actions there.\n\nTwo people familiar with his plans, who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly, said Mr. Perry intends to announce in the coming weeks that he will leave the administration in December. One person said that Mr. Perry had been winding down pet projects, like establishing an office on artificial intelligence, and that his future calendar had been cleared.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Climate Rick-Perry-Energy-Secretary.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
