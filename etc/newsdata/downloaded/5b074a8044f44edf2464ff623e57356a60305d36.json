The incident took place at Antico Caff\u00e8 di Marte near Castel Sant\u2019Angelo in the city center, according to CNN, and the review quickly went viral.\n\nSince the review was posted, other visitors to the Antico Caff\u00e8 have shared their own horrifyingly high bills and stories about feeling ripped off by the restaurant.\n\nOne customer who posted on TripAdvisor, Minh Ngoc Bui, spoke with CNN. Minh, who is Vietnamese but lives in Germany, said she was with friends having lunch at Antico Caff\u00e8 on August 27 when the waiter suggested the \"seafood \u2013 mixed fish\" dish from the menu, with a price of $7 (\u20ac6.5) per half cup (100 grams).\n\n\"We agreed because It would be not a big deal to pay \u20ac6.5 [$7] extra to try a recommendation dish,\" Minh said. \"But they brought us only one plate of mixed fish around 2 kg [about 8 cups].\"\n\nShe added, \"We were kind of surprised when we saw this dish because we didn't expect '100 grams fish' would be this big. But it was our last day in Italy so we told ourselves it was OK.\u201d\n\nBut, just like the Japanese tourists\u2019 story that went viral, when they asked for the bill, she was asked to pay for 4.8 kg of mixed fish at a cost of $345 (\u20ac315), Minh said.\n\nAdding service fee and tip, the whole bill was a staggering $515 (\u20ac476.40).\n\nView photos Minh Ngoc Bui's receipt. (Photo: TripAdvisor) More\n\nOther diners have voiced similar complaints on the restaurant\u2019s TripAdvisor page, with one writing: \u201cWe ordered two pizza, water, and coffee no alcohol but they demanded \u20ac350 [$384] includes \u20ac80 [$88] service fee!\u201d\n\nAnd even prior to September, there appear to be complaints, with an Australian tourist writing: \u201cWe were hungry and looking out for a place to eat and as we were walking along... the food was average, I would not even bother to say what we ate - but to rub salt into the wound was the bill. I believe that we were overcharged anyway. We noticed afterwards that they ADDED 20% tip for themselves.\u201d\n\nTripadvisor suspended the restaurant's review page and posted the following statement:\n\n\"Due to a recent event that has attracted media attention and has caused an influx of review submissions that do not describe a firsthand experience, we have temporarily suspended publishing new reviews for this listing. If you've had a firsthand experience at this property, please check back soon -- we're looking forward to receiving your review!\"\n\nAntico Caff\u00e8 di Marte replied to the criticism saying that the menu \"is clear,\" according to a statement published by the Italian newspaper Il Messaggero.\n\n\"Everything is written in detail, just look at the prices: \u20ac16 [$18] maximum for a spaghetti with seafood,\" Giacomo Jin, the owner, said. \"To pay that figure, the [Japanese] girls ordered not only spaghetti, but also fish. On the other hand, our fish is fresh: the client picks it at the counter, we weigh it and we cook it.\"\n\nHe also added that the tip and service fee was not compulsory, which contradicts the reviews on TripAdvisor.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.\n\n\n\n", "description": "A restaurant in Rome has attracted the ire of the internet after Japanese tourists dining in Rome were shocked to receive a bill for more than $470  after ordering two plates of spaghetti and fish and two glasses of water.", "authors": ["Tanya Edwards"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ZMND4g89jlFe4lVwEd2_Uw--~B/aD0zNTQ7dz02MzA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/f108f230-e53a-11e9-b5f9-5ec67cccea09"}
