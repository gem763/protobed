(AP Photo/Eric Gay)\n\nHOUSTON (AP) \u2014 The Latest on the Democratic presidential debate (all times local):\n\n5:20 p.m.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is weighing in on the Democratic primary field hours before his would-be opponents face off on the debate stage in Houston.\n\nTrump said Thursday that he thinks he'll face former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren or Sen. Bernie Sanders next year. He says, \"It's going to be one of those three.\"\n\nTrump says he's going to catch up on the Democratic debate once he returns from Baltimore, where he is traveling to address congressional Republicans on Thursday evening.\n\nHe says, \"It's going to be very interesting. I'm going to have to watch it as a rerun.\"\n\n___\n\n11:50 a.m.\n\nJust hours before Thursday night's debate in Houston, former Vice President Joe Biden went up with a digital ad aimed at deflecting criticism of President Barack Obama's administration.\n\nBiden is shown saying in footage from a campaign event that Obama \"was a president our children could and did look up to.\" Biden says he was \"proud to serve as his vice president, but never more proud than the day we passed health care.\"\n\nOther Obama administration accomplishments appear on-screen, including \"protected dreamers\" and \"led on marriage equality.\"\n\nAfter a debate earlier this summer in Detroit, Biden said he was \"a little surprised\" at the flak he took from fellow Democrats about Obama's legacy, pushing back against criticism of the Affordable Care Act and Obama-era immigration policy.\n\nSome Democrats in early voting states like South Carolina, which holds the first primary vote in the South next year, have listed Biden's proximity to Obama as among their top reasons for supporting him.\n\n___\n\n8:35 a.m.\n\nThe top Democratic presidential contenders will finally be on one debate stage Thursday in Houston as Joe Biden tries to solidify his early lead over Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.\n\nKamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg (BOO'-tuh-juhj) will look to reclaim some lost momentum.\n\nThe ABC News debate has 10 candidates altogether and will air on a broadcast network with a post-Labor Day uptick in interest in the race. That could give candidates their largest audience yet as the campaigning heads into the fall.\n\nIt's also the first time Warren and Biden will appear on the same stage.\n\nBut the campaigns say that doesn't necessarily mean the three-hour debate will end up being a direct clash between the progressive Massachusetts senator and the more centrist former vice president.", "description": "President Donald Trump is weighing in on the Democratic primary field hours before his would-be opponents face off on the debate stage in Houston.
