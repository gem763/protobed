It gave no details of their agenda.\n\nThe two governments have raised tariffs on billions of dollars of each other\u2019s goods. That has battered farmers and manufacturers on both sides and fueled fears the global economy, which already is showing signs of cooling, might tip into recession.\n\nBeijing announced Friday it will lift punitive tariffs on American soybeans, China\u2019s biggest import from the United States. That followed President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to postpone a tariff hike on Chinese imports. But there has been no sign of progress on the core issues in their sprawling dispute.\n\nNegotiations between Washington and Beijing broke down in May over how to enforce any deal.\n\nBeijing says Trump\u2019s tariff hikes must be lifted as soon as an agreement takes effect. Washington wants to keep some in place to ensure Chinese compliance.\n\nTrump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed in June to resume talks but the last round in Shanghai in July produced no progress.\n\nWashington wants Beijing to roll back plans for state-led development of leaders in robotics and other technologies that some American officials worry will erode U.S. industrial leadership.\n\nThe World Bank and a Chinese Cabinet agency, in a report issued Tuesday, urged Beijing to open markets and curb subsidies and official involvement in technology industries that it says might hamper development instead of promoting it.\n\nThe report on China\u2019s fledgling technology was commissioned three years ago, well before the trade war with Trump over trade and Beijing\u2019s technology ambitions erupted.\n\nIt does not mention the trade war, though it focuses on the same policies that Washington, Europe, Japan and other trading partners say violate Beijing\u2019s market-opening commitments.\n\nCritics of those policies complain that they are based on stealing or improperly pressuring foreign companies to hand over technology and shielding Chinese industry from competition.\n\nThe report was issued by the World Bank, the Chinese Finance Ministry and the Cabinet\u2019s Development Research Center, which represents the most free-market oriented wing of the ruling Communist Party.\n\nIt marks the third time the Washington-based bank and the DRC have collaborated on reports urging that the government scale back its role in the state-dominated economy. They have had a limited impact on policy.\n\n\u201cDeveloping new drivers of growth is becoming more urgent\u201d due to a \u201ccomplicated international environment\u201d and weakening Chinese economy, a DRC official, Zhang Junkuo, said at a news conference.\n\nThe report portrays its recommendations as an extension of the ruling party\u2019s market-oriented development plans.\n\nXi\u2019s government, which has waged a crackdown on liberal intellectuals and activist lawyers, has attacked reform advocates who criticize government development plans.\n\nOne of China\u2019s most prominent economic think tanks, the Unirule Institute in Beijing, announced last month it would shut down after the government banned it after seeking for years to silence its criticism of economic policy.\n\nXi\u2019s government has announced tariff cuts and market-opening measures including allowing full foreign ownership of auto manufacturers for the first time. But it is resisting pressure to discard technology development plans considered to be crucial for prosperity and global influence.\n\nThe World Bank report calls on Beijing to \u201cremove distortions and market barriers\u201d and to ensure government policies \u201csupplement market competition instead of supplanting it.\u201d\n\nThe government should provide a \u201cclear and fair business environment\u201d instead of making commercial decisions, the report said. It calls for faster action in reforms aimed at making state-owned companies more competitive and \u201cgreater discipline\u201d in official support to specific industries.\n\nA survey of 500 entrepreneurs in five Chinese cities found they believe the most effective government initiatives improve business conditions and promote competition rather provide direct subsidies or official financing, the report said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A Chinese envoy will head to Washington on Wednesday to prepare for trade negotiations.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Joe Mcdonald"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/17/china_us_trade_91182_c0-209-5000-3124_s1770x1032.jpg?d90e3d455f0268dece892f6c8cc4108909694c0b", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
