REUTERS/Russell Cheyne\n\nKlopp was aggrieved Liverpool were not awarded a free-kick for a \u201cclear foul\u201d on Divock Origi in the build-up to United\u2019s first-half goal after watching his side drop points in the league for the first time this season.\n\nPremier League rules governing VAR allow the video assistant to overturn a referee\u2019s decision only in the case of a clear and obvious error.\n\n\u201cThis is a problem we have to discuss,\u201d the Liverpool boss told reporters. \u201cI was 100% sure VAR would overrule (United\u2019s goal).\n\n\u201cThe referee let the game run because he has VAR, but the VAR says then it was not clear... This makes not too much sense. It is a clear VAR issue in how we deal with it in the moment.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not angry or whatever. I am sure (referee) Martin Atkinson would have whistled if there was no VAR but he let it go.\u201d\n\nMarcus Rashford opening the scoring for United, who were pegged back by Liverpool substitute Adam Lallana\u2019s equaliser about five minutes from time.\n\nManchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer disagreed with Klopp\u2019s assessment of the Origi incident and praised the referee for letting the game flow.\n\n\u201cNo chance \u2013 we\u2019re not playing basketball. It\u2019s never a foul,\u201d Solskjaer said. \u201cI think the referee did well. He let it become a proper football game with tackles. He wasn\u2019t one of those tippy-tappy, stop-the-game referees.\u201d\n\nDespite the draw, Liverpool still lead second-placed Manchester City by six points, while United are 13th in the table.", "description": "Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp criticised the video assistant referee (VAR) system after his team's 1-1 draw at Manchester United on Sunday, saying the way the technology is being used in England does not make \"too much sense\".", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191021&t=2&i=1443255378&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9K0DL-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
