The figure is double the 924,000 barrels in the previous week. But shipments to Asia, which are typically done on VLCCs, were reduced almost in half to 508,000 barrels.\n\nA Singapore broker said rates for some VLCC cargoes on sailings from the U.S. Gulf Coast to the Far East were more than $120,000 on Thursday. Average earnings for supertankers picking up cargoes from around the world hit $94,124 a day, up from $18,284 on Sept. 25, when Washington blacklisted the Cosco fleet.\n\n\u201cVLCCs to Asia are a rare commodity, the market is red hot and will stay that way while the U.S. sanctions on Cosco ships are in place,\u201d said the broker, who asked not to be named because he isn\u2019t authorized to talk to the media.\n\nTo get an edge in the oil market, traders turn to satellites, shadows and a lot of fancy math.

The company is also a part of Beijing\u2019s multitrillion-dollar Belt and Road initiative that aims to establish infrastructure and distribution channels to help extend China\u2019s influence around the world.\n\nThe Cosco tanker ban covers around 6% of the global VLCC fleet but other factors are leaving shipping capacity tight. Many large tankers and smaller ships are in dry dock being retrofitted with sulfur-trapping exhaust systems ahead of a regulation to clean up ship emissions that goes into effect in January.\n\n\u201cThe [freight rate] expectations going into 2020 were already high because of the 2020 climate regulations,\u201d said Evangelos Marinakis, chairman of Athens-based Capital Maritime & Trading Corp., which operates 10 VLCCs. \u201cWith so many geopolitical and industry-specific factors now pushing the market, it\u2019s hard to predict when it will settle. But we expect the current strength to continue well into next year.\u201d\n\nWrite to Costas Paris at costas.paris@wsj.com", "description": "The cost of moving oil around the world has hit an 11-year high as producers scramble to find new supertankers following a U.S. blacklisting of a major Chinese operator that has sidelined dozens of ships.", "authors": ["Costas Paris", "Costas.Paris Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-115781/social", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
