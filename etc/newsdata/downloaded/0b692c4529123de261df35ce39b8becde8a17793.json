Her nightmare left her so broken she attempted suicide.\n\nAt just 16, she feared for her life as one rapist battered her and shoved gravel in her mouth to silence her cries.\n\nFor four years, until she was 19, she fell under the control of a man who hawked her around like a piece of meat.\n\nJennifer claims police refused to intervene and repeatedly arrested her for prostitution from the age of 16 to 19, despite her plea she was being exploited.\n\nYet not one of her abusers has been brought to justice despite multiple reports to police. Jennifer says: \u201cI must have been raped by more than 500 men.\n\n\"When I told the police, they told me I\u2019d chosen my lifestyle. I asked to make a statement because I\u2019d been raped and beaten by so many men and I wanted it to stop.\n\n\"An officer said, \u2018You\u2019re a common prostitute. Don\u2019t you think that comes with the job?\u2019 He said a jury would never believe I was a victim of abuse.\n\n\u201cInstead, I ended up in the dock. I starved so I had money for the court fines because I was terrified of going to jail. I was basically paying to be raped.\u201d\n\n(Image: Sunday Mirror)\n\nJennifer paints a picture of an unbearable childhood. She missed school from 14 to 16 as she was being violated and beaten by up to 10 men a night.\n\nShe says: \u201cI thought the only way out was death because I\u2019d gone to the police and they didn\u2019t want to help me. My life was a living hell, I felt so alone. When I took an overdose, the ambulance driver refused to go home because I was on my own. She sat at my bedside, crying.\u201d\n\nA Sunday Mirror probe last year revealed up to 1,000 Telford girls could have been sexually exploited over four decades. Jennifer is set to give evidence to the ongoing public inquiry called as a result of our probe.\n\nHer hell began when she moved to the Shropshire town in the late 1980s.\n\nFinally, in the mid-90s, she fled to a relative\u2019s home hundreds of miles away. Jennifer tells the Sunday Mirror: \u201cI know it wasn\u2019t my fault, but I feel guilty about girls who were abused. I wonder if they\u2019d have been saved if I\u2019d been taken seriously when I told police.\n\n\u201cI moved to Telford aged 11 and was desperate to fit in with other girls, who had boyfriends. I met a lad my age, but he introduced me to his older cousin and everything spiralled from there. His friends started gang raping me.\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nJennifer, now a mum in her 40s, skipped school for two years. A social worker visited her but she says barely any questions were asked about what was going on in her life.\n\nShe tried to return to class but claims a teacher told her she was wasting her time because she\u2019d missed so many lessons. Jennifer adds bleakly: \u201cI walked straight out of the gates and never went back. From that point, no one asked a single question.\u201d\n\nThe teenager was then targeted by an older man who would control her for the next four years. She says: \u201cHe pretended to be my boyfriend, but it was a typical grooming scenario. Soon, he\u2019d put me on the streets.\u201d\n\nJennifer says the man was known to police for sex trafficking and her mum told officers she was in his clutches.\n\nBut she says the abuser was still able to drive her around the country, forcing her into sex with other men.\n\nJennifer goes on: \u201cI was driven to a town in the Midlands and made to watch as an older girl was sold for sex. I was in my school skirt and cardigan. The first time I was arrested was shortly afterwards, in the same town. I told police I was from Telford and no one questioned why I was miles from home in the middle of the night.\u201d\n\nMany Telford victims say most of their abusers were from the Pakistani community but Jennifer says she was sold to anyone willing to pay.\n\nShe was so terrified of one man she jumped out of a moving car as he attacked. Then another abuser left her in utter terror. Jennifer says: \u201cOne man dragged me into an industrial estate to rape and beat me. I screamed, pray-ing someone could hear me. I thought he was going to kill me. There was a light on in a cellar and I was convinced that was where he\u2019d dump my body.\n\n\u201cHe picked up a handful of gravel and stuffed my mouth with it and held my nose so I would be quiet. I said, \u2018Are you going to kill me? My mum will report me as a missing person\u2019. Somehow, it made him stop.\u201d\n\nJennifer says if she refused to obey orders she would be battered by the man who was controlling her. He beat her so badly that she choked on her own blood \u2013 then he told her she would have to pay for a new carpet.\n\nShe adds: \u201cHe also locked me in a flat with iron bars, for three or four days. I was told the police thought I\u2019d been abducted but they did nothing.\u201d\n\nJennifer says she went to police soon after she turned 17. But she claims: \u201cI was told to have a good think about how I\u2019d look in court. I knew then no one would believe me.\u201d\n\nThere was little support for Jennifer at home. She says: \u201cMy mum didn\u2019t understand what was going on and she believed it was my fault. After going to the police once, she kept quiet, which was the wrong thing to do because my abusers thrived on her silence. She was embarrassed and ashamed. Our relationship has never recovered.\u201d\n\nRecords seen by the Sunday Mirror show Jennifer was convicted 52 times and fined heavily by the time she was 19 after being sold for sex.\n\nHer trafficker was held in custody for four months on suspicion of a gang rape. But the case collapsed and he turned up at her door with a shotgun.\n\nShe says: \u201cI told him I was pregnant by another man and he didn\u2019t attack me that day. But he was furious I wouldn\u2019t have an abortion and that\u2019s when I overdosed.\u201d\n\nJennifer pulled through but decided to have a termination. She finally broke free by fleeing Telford for ever.\n\nShe slowly rebuilt her life, had children and graduated from university.\n\nWhen she read about mass abuse of Telford girls in the Sunday Mirror, she asked police to look at her case again, but was told her they wouldn\u2019t have enough evidence to prosecute.\n\nBut she has been identified by a national scheme aimed at rooting out human trafficking and hopes this will lead to offenders being punished.\n\nWest Mercia Police said Jennifer\u2019s case collapsed as officers were unable to identify offenders \u2013 but promised a thorough investigation \u201cif more information were to come to light\u201d.\n\nThe first complaint Jennifer made aged 17 was to an officer from West Midlands Police. The force said it did not have a record of the complaint but insisted all allegations of historic sex abuse would be taken seriously.\n\nTelford and Wrekin Council urged anyone with information to give evidence to the public inquiry.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Let down by authorities after a seven-year ordeal, Jennifer tells the Sunday Mirror for the first time how it was she who was left with a criminal record", "authors": ["Geraldine Mckelvie", "Image", "Getty", "Sunday Mirror"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20467197.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_I191003_133544_1640143oTextTRMRMMGLPICT000164167918o.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
