But when his tyrannical father dies, Hal is crowned King Henry V and is forced to embrace the life he had previously tried to escape. Now the young king must navigate the palace politics, chaos and war his father left behind, and the emotional strings of his past life \u2014 including his relationship with his closest friend and mentor, the ageing alcoholic knight, John Falstaff (Joel Edgerton). Directed by David Mich\u00f4d and co-written by Mich\u00f4d and Edgerton, THE KING co-stars Sean Harris, Ben Mendelsohn, Robert Pattinson, and Lily-Rose Depp.\n\nThe Crown: Season 3 (17 November)\n\nWhile England in the Swinging Sixties confronts an economic downturn and fierce nationalism, the royals are scrutinized as aristocratic freeloaders.\n\nThe Irishman (27 November)\n\nRobert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci star in Martin Scorsese\u2019s THE IRISHMAN, an epic saga of organized crime in post-war America told through the eyes of World War II veteran Frank Sheeran, a hustler and hitman who worked alongside some of the most notorious figures of the 20th century. Spanning decades, the film chronicles one of the greatest unsolved mysteries in American history, the disappearance of legendary union boss Jimmy Hoffa, and offers a monumental journey through the hidden corridors of organized crime: its inner workings, rivalries and connections to mainstream politics.\n\nNetflix's full November schedule\n\n1 November\n\nAtypical: Season 3\n\nHache\n\nQueer Eye: We're in Japan!\n\nWe Are the Wave\n\nAmerican Son\n\nDrive\n\nHoliday in the Wild\n\nThe King\n\nThe Man Without Gravity\n\nFire in Paradise\n\nHello Ninja\n\nTrue: Grabbleapple Harvest\n\nThe Last Samurai\n\nGoing for Gold\n\nMy Little Pony Friendship Is Magic: Best Gift Ever\n\nAsh vs. Evil Dead: Season 1\n\nMatilda\n\nSeven Years in Tibet\n\nBody of Lies\n\nChristmas Break-In\n\nTucker: The Man and His Dream\n\n4 November\n\nThe Devil Next Door\n\nPacific Rim: Uprising\n\n5 November\n\nThe End of the F***ing World: Season 2\n\nTune in for Love\n\nSeth Meyers: Lobby Baby\n\nShe-Ra and the Princesses of Power: Season 4\n\nOutlander: Season 4\n\n6 November\n\nGreenleaf: Season 4\n\nSCAMS\n\n8 November\n\nBusted!: Season 2\n\nGreatest Events of WWII in HD Colour\n\nGreen Eggs and Ham\n\nParadise Beach\n\nLet It Snow\n\n9 November\n\nLittle Things: Season 3\n\nFifty Shades Freed\n\nPhantom Thread\n\n10 November\n\nPatriot Act with Hasan Minhaj: Volume 5\n\n11 November\n\nBlockers\n\n12 November\n\nJeff Garlin: Our Man In Chicago\n\nHarvey Girls Forever!: Season 3\n\nYummy Mummies: Season 2\n\n13 November\n\nMaradona in Mexico\n\n14 November\n\nThe Stranded\n\nFadily Camara: La Plus Dr\u00f4le de Tes Copines\n\n15 November\n\nAvlu: Part 2\n\nI'm with the Band: Nasty Cherry\n\nThe Club\n\nThe Toys That Made Us: Season 3\n\nHouse Arrest\n\nKlaus\n\nEarthquake Bird\n\nGO!: The Unforgettable Party\n\nLlama Llama: Season 2\n\nSeven\n\nJonah Hex\n\nJoe Versus the Volcano\n\n17 November\n\nThe Crown: Season 3\n\n19 November\n\nIliza: Unveiled\n\nNo hay tiempo para la verguenza\n\n20 November\n\nLorena, la de pies ligeros\n\nBikram: Yogi, Guru, Predator\n\nZ Nation: Season 5\n\n21 November\n\nMortel\n\nThe Knight Before Christmas\n\n22 November\n\nDolly Parton's Heartstrings\n\nHigh Seas: Season 2\n\nNailed It!
