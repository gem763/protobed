They\u2019re a bunch of old white men who defy science by walking without a backbone, so why should they believe in other things scientists claim are true like climate change?\n\nThey also have a much more enviable power: to challenge this President and rein in his worst impulses. But instead, they keep enabling him.\n\nJust this week, the Trump administration announced that they would not cooperate with the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry, blocked a witness from testifying before Congress and threatened to destroy the economy of Turkey, a NATO ally, after pulling US troops out of Syria. \u201cAs I have stated strongly before,\u201d our president tweeted, \u201cand just to reiterate, if Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be of limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the economy of Turkey (I\u2019ve done it before!)\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nGreat and unmatched wisdom? Most of us know by now that the only wisdom Trump has can be found in his wisdom teeth. Given that he brags about everything else, I suppose it was only a matter of time before he started bragging about his teeth. The original version of this tweet probably read \u201cMany people have said that I have the most beautiful, tremendous, great and unmatched wisdom teeth. I know a lot about teeth \u2014 I have over 30 of them\u201d.\n\nAs a Brit, I\u2019m really glad there\u2019s a country that\u2019s more embarrassing than Britain right now. As an American, I\u2019m horrified that that country is America.\n\nOf course, standing up to a badly behaved president is something that Congressional Republicans and conservative media are absolutely capable of. Remember when Lou Dobbs tweeted: \u201cObama in a tan suit? What message is the President trying to send? [Watch] Fox News\u2019 Ed Rollins on Obama\u2019s image issues\u201d back when those were the kinds of scandals we cared about? Yeah, me too.\n\nNow, I can\u2019t say Dobbs picked on Obama because he\u2019s a minority, because as an orange guy, Trump is a minority too. But he\u2019s hardly consistent.\n\nDefying Congress as Trump has in the last couple of weeks could trigger a Constitutional crisis \u2014 because the Constitution gives the House the power to impeach whether Trump likes it or not, and compliance is not optional. But Republicans have consistently shown that they\u2019re willing to overlook anything this President does, no matter how egregious. At this point, Trump could wipe his ass with the Constitution and Republicans would praise him for applying the Constitution in a way that no other President has.\n\nIf Trump can govern via executive orders and ignore the elected officials of Congress, America is less democracy and more autocracy. It\u2019s no secret that Trump would prefer not to have to deal with Congress \u2014 but it defies logic for Congressional Republicans to support the President\u2019s efforts to ignore Congress because such capitulation is effectively arguing to put themselves out of a job (which is what happens any time Joe Biden is on a debate stage).\n\nNixon abused the power of his office, and was held accountable because he lost the support of Congressmen in his own party. Instead, the most contemporary Republicans can do is offer nominal \u201cconcern\u201d (hello, Mitt Romney) before falling back into line or claiming that more \u201cfacts\u201d need to come out before they can commit to holding their president to account.\n\nThe facts are already out, Mitt! The transcript released by Trump himself shows that he engaged in a quid pro quo! And in case that wasn\u2019t clear enough, a few days later, in front of the press on live TV, Trump asked Ukraine and China to investigate Biden (incidentally, I\u2019ve heard tell that China rejected Trump\u2019s request to investigate Trump\u2019s election opponent. Not because they don\u2019t have dirt, but because Xi doesn\u2019t understand what an election is.)\n\nCongressional Republicans have the legal and political tools to hold this President accountable. But if they continue to ignore Trump\u2019s defiance of the Constitution and march towards autocracy, they will collectively become the Jimmy Fallon of politics: rich, white, male and pointless.", "description": "Congressional Republicans are a unique group.
