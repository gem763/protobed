The disease I have is very rare, only one in eight million people have it. It\u2019s called AL amyloidosis. The worst scenario is I could only have six months, so I\u2019m in a horrible position.'\n\nMaria said: 'We stayed in Cardiff which was really important, if I'd have moved her to London, I think that glitz lifestyle could have got the better of us, but we always went back to our roots' (pictured 1999)\n\nDiscussing his treatment, Charlotte stated: 'He\u2019s on chemotherapy and to be honest he\u2019ll be on it until he dies.
