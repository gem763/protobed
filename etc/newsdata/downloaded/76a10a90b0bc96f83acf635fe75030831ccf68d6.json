(PHOTO: Shout via SPCA/Facebook)\n\nSINGAPORE \u2014Crabs are not toys and the use of a \u201clive crab claw machine\u201d at a seafood restaurant in Punggol causes \u201cunnecessary harm\u201d to the animals, said the Singapore Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA).\n\n\u201cCrabs are living creatures, not toys. The SPCA advises members of the public to not partake in such activities,\u201d it said in a Facebook post on Wednesday (23 October), adding that it had reported to the Animal and Veterinary Service (AVS) to ask the agency \u201cto shut this down\u201d.\n\nSince last Sunday from 5pm to 10pm daily, customers who visit the House of Seafood at Punggol Point Road can pay $5 to use the claw machine to catch live Sri Lankan crabs, which they can then have them cooked for free on the spot, or be kept in the restaurant.\n\n\u201cThe game causes unnecessary harm to the animals and it also encourages people to see animals as nothing more than objects to play with and goes against our vision of a kinder society,\u201d said the SPCA.\n\nIts post has been shared over 1,600 times and garnered over 300 comments from angry netizens as of 7pm.\n\nFacebook user Adelyn Tan wrote, \u201cThis is done in very bad taste by the restaurant and the publicity team, without any regard for the crabs, making a mockery of their lives and existence just because they are only seen as food on a dinner plate.\u201d\n\nUser Lestatte Liew suggested for the restaurant to use plush toys to represent the live prizes, which can be redeemed later.\n\nNetizen Samatha Lee noted, \u201cIt is also kind of unhygienic to create this claw machine as you may not know how long will the crabs survive in there.\u201d Some have called for the business to be penalised and boycotted.\n\nAcres, or Animal Concerns Research and Education Society (Singapore), also commented about the machine in a Facebook post on Wednesday night.\n\nThe animal welfare group said that it received feedback on the practice a few days ago and filed a cruelty case with AVS due to the \u201cserious welfare concerns\u201d. It added, \u201cWe fully support the call to end this cruelty and urge everyone not to participate in such activities where live animals are treated as objects.\u201d\n\nHouse of Seafood CEO Francis Ng has said that the $5,000 machine \u2013 touted by the business as the first of its kind in Singapore \u2013 was designed to prevent causing the crabs \u201cany pain\u201d and to educate the public on how to identify male and female crabs.\n\nHe added that he would respect the authorities\u2019 decision to remove it, if necessary.\n\nYahoo News Singapore has reached out to the AVS for comment.\n\nHave a tip-off?
