He's still maintaining quite a belligerent position,\" said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst for Asia Pacific at OANDA.\n\nTrump criticized China's trade practices at the United National General Assembly on Tuesday and said he would not accept a \"bad deal\" in U.S.-China trade negotiations.\n\nChina is the world's largest oil importer and second-largest crude user while the United States is the largest consumer.\n\nTrump also said he saw a path to peace with Iran even as he denounce Iran for \"bloodlust\", cooling geopolitical premiums in oil prices.\n\nOil rallied last week following a crippling attack on Saudi Arabia's oil installations that has disrupted supplies from the world's top exporter. To meet its supply obligations to Saudi refineries overseas, Saudi Aramco is buying oil from other Middle East producers.\n\n\"The risk premium has died off for now,\" Halley said, adding that the main driver for oil markets now is trade uncertainty that could impact demand.\n\nPrices were also weighed down by an unexpected build in U.S. crude inventories last week.\n\nU.S. crude inventories rose 1.4 million barrels last week, the American Petroleum Institute said on Tuesday, compared with analysts' forecasts of a 200,000-barrel draw down.\n\nOfficial government data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration will be released later today.", "description": "Oil prices fell for a second day on Wednesday on worries about falling fuel demand after U.S. President Donald Trump's comments doused optimism over China-U.S. trade talks and reignited concerns on global economic growth.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/104923536-Oil_rig.jpg?v=1569371790", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
