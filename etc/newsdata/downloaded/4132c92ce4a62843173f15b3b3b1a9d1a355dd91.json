(AP) - Before the first snap of the season, the Minnesota Vikings settled into their usual spots before a slight shift by defensive tackles Linval Joseph and Shamar Stephen to their left.\n\nThe second after that, defensive end Everson Griffen shuffled out of his extra-wide alignment to move directly in front of Atlanta\u2019s Jake Matthews. Linebacker Anthony Barr crept up to the line of scrimmage in Griffen\u2019s vacated space and, once Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan dropped back, made a beeline for the pocket for an 8-yard sack off a free rush after a disrupted Matthews blocked Griffen instead.\n\nJust one play into the 2019 schedule, the Vikings defense was already rolling.\n\n\u201cThat sack really set the tone,\u201d Joseph said, complimenting head coach Mike Zimmer\u2019s aggressive call at the start of the 28-12 victory over the Falcons on Sunday. \u201cEverybody fed off that play.\u201d\n\nFor good measure, when Ryan took off on third-and-long, Barr finished the opening drive by racing over from the opposite side to make a diving tackle 2 yards short of the marker. The Falcons had to punt, Eric Wilson blocked it, and the offense took advantage of the shortened field with a quick touchdown.\n\nThis was the feeling, neutralizing an opponent in front of a loud crowd with a collection of accomplished players and close friends in a system they\u2019ve thrived in, Barr did not want to miss when he decided to stay with Minnesota instead of joining the New York Jets this offseason.\n\n\u201cThis is home,\u201d Barr said, \u201cand I was happy to be back.\u201d\n\nAfter his verbal agreement with the Jets that day in March, Barr slept for only a few hours after realizing the strength of the bond he\u2019d built with the Vikings and of his familiarity with Zimmer\u2019s 4-3 scheme in which he is an integral part. After Barr told the Vikings he wanted to stay and they moved some money around to make the salary cap work, the four-time Pro Bowl pick was able to keep that purple jersey after all with a five-year contract valued at $67.5 million with $33 million guaranteed.\n\n\u201cYou give him some money, and he can do a lot of different things,\u201d Joseph said. \u201cHe is living up to the hype.\u201d\n\nThe decision meant so much to safety Harrison Smith that, in an interview later, his voice cracked with emotion. The success the Vikings have enjoyed on defense is owed to individual talent and coaching acumen, of course, but system continuity can\u2019t be left off the list.\n\nWith Smith, Joseph, Griffen, Barr and cornerback Xavier Rhodes, the Vikings have five starters who\u2019ve been around for all of Zimmer\u2019s six seasons. Linebacker Eric Kendricks, cornerback Trae Waynes, strong safety Anthony Harris and defensive end Danielle Hunter have five years each in the scheme. Stephen, who spent last season with Seattle before returning as a free agent, also is in his fifth year.\n\n\u201cWe have a chemistry,\u201d Stephen said. \u201cWe kind of know where guys are going to be. We know how people rush. We know how people like to play their position.\u201d\n\nThe elbow injury suffered by cornerback Mackensie Alexander was about the only discouraging development from the opener for the Vikings, particularly given that the opposing quarterback this week is Green Bay\u2019s Aaron Rodgers. His absence in the second half against the Falcons thrust safety Jayron Kearse into primary duty in slot coverage in the nickel package, with rookies Kris Boyd and Mark Fields the only other options for the time being.\n\nMike Hughes, whose ACL tear was 11 months ago, has been practicing this week on a limited basis. He\u2019s on the verge of clearance, which would give the Vikings a welcomed boost behind starters Rhodes and Trae Waynes.\n\nFor more depth, the Vikings promoted cornerback Nate Meadors from the practice squad to the active roster and placed wide receiver Josh Doctson on injured reserve with a hamstring injury. Doctson, who was listed as a limited participant in practice on Wednesday, must miss a minimum of eight weeks if he\u2019s designated for a return. Meadors went undrafted out of UCLA. He had a 30-yard interception return for a touchdown in an exhibition game last month.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Before the first snap of the season, the Minnesota Vikings settled into their usual spots before a slight shift by defensive tackles Linval Joseph and Shamar Stephen to their left.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dave Campbell"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/12/falcons_vikings_football_41659_c0-140-3360-2099_s1770x1032.jpg?8d8aa9e3c765abd511d98c2d74f2a063c1e850c7", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
