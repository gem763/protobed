So this one cut through to us.\"\n\nThe email from the entrepreneurs to Mr Dorrell and fellow Carthona partner James Synge showed that the trio had done their research on the fund, captured the personalities and experience of the team members and clearly explained the problem they were solving and why they were well-placed to be the ones to solve it.\n\n\"My colleagues know if I'm not keen on something I stay quiet, but if I am I'm up drawing on the whiteboard and I was ... the way they approached it combined with the skills of the team really got me there,\" Mr Dorrell said.\n\nThe email led to the company banking a $1.2 million investment from Carthona, which was followed up with a further $3 million investment from the fund in its Series A raise this year.\n\nVirtual health assistants\n\nMedius Health has combined medical data with artificial intelligence to create a virtual chatbot that can be deployed by hospitals, health and life insurers or telehealth providers to give customers a service in which they can find out if they should seek medical assistance, or to get information to help them with their care after receiving a diagnosis.\n\nUsing data from a range of sources such as medical journals, books, through partnerships with companies like MyDr and electronic health record data, its AI Quro has learnt the foundations of medicine just like a junior doctor would.\n\nHaving already conducted close to 68,000 consultations, it has a 75 per cent success rate of accurately diagnosing a patient. The AI will yield its top three most likely diagnoses when consulted and its accuracy rate leaps to 89 per cent when considering if the disease is one of its top three picks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSecond time founders, Mr Bhatia and Ms Bhatia started the business after a previous venture in media sales failed and they began researching problems that needed solving in the healthcare industry.\n\nThe idea for a virtual healthcare assistant came to the husband and wife team after Ms Bhatia went to numerous GPs for a shoulder injury and was constantly running into issues with data not being shared between providers.\n\nWhile there's applications for Medius Health locally, particularly in regional areas, it sees its biggest opportunities in markets like India where there is only one doctor per 3000 patients.\n\n\"In the next 12 months, the aim is to be close to 500,000 consultations per month and I think that we can achieve that with the partnerships we're doing,\" Mr Bhatia said.\n\n\"We are a revenue generating company now, thankfully, and we have goals for the next year to be north of $10 million.\"", "description": "Carthona Capital's Dean Dorrell has only made one investment off a cold email.
