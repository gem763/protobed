That\u2019s the claim made by a \u201cformer senior intelligence official\u201d from the Trump administration to Politico, which claims to have confirmed it with other sources. According to Daniel Lippman, the US intel community have concluded that it\u2019s part of an elaborate Israeli intel operation \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t concern Trump much:\n\nThe U.S. government concluded within the last two years that Israel was most likely behind the placement of cell-phone surveillance devices that were found near the White House and other sensitive locations around Washington, D.C., according to three former senior U.S. officials with knowledge of the matter. But unlike most other occasions when flagrant incidents of foreign spying have been discovered on American soil, the Trump administration did not rebuke the Israeli government, and there were no consequences for Israel\u2019s behavior, one of the former officials said. \u2026 \u201cThe reaction \u2026 was very different than it would have been in the last administration,\u201d this person said. \u201cWith the current administration, there are a different set of calculations in regard to addressing this.\u201d\n\nThe first question one might ask when reading this is \u2026 why? Not only is Trump regularly indiscreet about his thoughts and plans \u2014 especially on Twitter \u2014 he\u2019s also closer to Israel than most of his predecessors. He and Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu are personal friends, and Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner has been working closely with the Israelis on their issues with the Palestinians. The only potential blind spot for them would be Trump\u2019s famously capricious approach to policy and any attempts to engage Iran, which Trump would almost certainly keep quiet from Israel in the planning stages. Even then, though, their legitimate access to Trump would probably serve them better than covert operations against their biggest patron and oft-times only ally.\n\nReading onward, the second question one might ask is \u2026 who?\n\nBeyond trying to intercept the private conversations of top officials \u2014 prized information for any intelligence service \u2014 foreign countries often will try to surveil their close associates as well. With the president, the former senior Trump administration official noted, that could include trying to listen in on the devices of the people he regularly communicates with, such as Steve Wynn, Sean Hannity and Rudy Giuliani. \u201cThe people in that circle are heavily targeted,\u201d said the former Trump official.\n\nWynn\u2019s on the outs at the moment, presumably, while he\u2019s dealing with allegations of sexual harassment and abuse. Rudy Giuliani is, if anything, more indiscreet these days than Trump, although usually only on Trump\u2019s legal matters. Sean Hannity has the top-rated prime-time talk show in the nation and isn\u2019t exactly known for holding back, especially when it comes to talking about what Trump might have in mind. You don\u2019t need Stingrays to collect that data; all you need is a DVR.\n\nStill, nations conduct intelligence gathering on friends and foes alike, even those allies with whom their intel services work. The first rule in these situations is to deny it, and the second rule is to strenuously deny it:\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s office shot down allegations his country was spying on U.S. soil as \u201ca blatant lie.\u201d \u201cThere is a longstanding commitment, and a directive from the Israeli government not to engage in any intelligence operations in the U.S.,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cThis directive is strictly enforced without exception.\u201d\n\nEr, sure. But there are at least a few reasons for some skepticism about this particular report. First off, Stingray tracking devices are hardly exotic, and are not at all limited to espionage work \u2014 at least not in the common understanding of it. The ACLU has been researching these devices for years, and last November reported that \u201c75 agencies in 27 states and the District of Columbia that own stingrays.\u201d Those were only the agencies that they could confirm. (Everyone else was following Rules 1 & 2, apparently.) Among just the federal agencies identified with their use was naturally the FBI, which has the writ for domestic intel collection. But it also includes the NSA, three branches of the military, the National Guard, and the IRS, which has no particular need to collect \u201cintelligence\u201d in the common sense of the word. Finding Stingrays in DC sounds like shooting fish in a barrel, with or without the Israelis.\n\nNext, the timing of this report is awfully curious. Netanyahu\u2019s standing for election next week and his relationship with the Trump administration is a big part of his appeal. It\u2019s an odd time for US intelligence sources to leak this information to the press. One has to wonder what the motive for the leak was, especially since the previous administration had a history of interfering in Israeli elections. The parallels here are at least curious, especially given the somewhat contentious relationship between the US intel community and Trump.\n\nIn other words, while one can treat Netanyahu\u2019s claim of zero intel operations in the US with some skepticism, we can also treat Politico\u2019s sources with a significant level of skepticism as well. Someone has an agenda behind this leak, perhaps more than one, and it\u2019s not to protect us from the Israelis.", "description": "Question the timing -- and the motives.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/trump-netanyahu.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
