Trump said he had planned to meet separately with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani.\n\n\u201cTo me, this is just no way to conduct foreign policy,\u201d Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) told CNN on Sunday, agreeing that the U.S. should be engaged in talks with both the Taliban and the Afghan government, but calling Trump\u2019s move a \u201chastily arranged summit which no one knew was happening.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole thing doesn\u2019t quite make sense to me, and it\u2019s just another example of the president treating foreign policy like it\u2019s some kind of game show,\u201d the 2020 presidential hopeful added. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a game show, these are terrorists.\u201d\n\nIn his tweets, Trump said he nixed the meetings after finding out about a Taliban car bombing in Kabul that occurred Thursday, killing an American soldier and 11 other victims.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of people would kill so many in order to seemingly strengthen their bargaining position?\u201d he asked, despite the organization\u2019s long history of such violence.\n\nIn Klobuchar\u2019s view, the talks were doomed from the start and would have done more harm than good.\n\n\u201cThe way he conducts foreign policy just reminds me exactly of North Korea,\u201d she said, referring to Trump\u2019s unprecedented meetings with its leader, Kim Jong Un. \u201cHe loves the showmanship, he wants to have that moment, but then all the details aren\u2019t done, and we end up in a worse place on the world stage than we were before.\u201d\n\nAmy Klobuchar on President Trump's handling of Afghan peace talks with the Taliban: \u201cThe whole thing doesn't quite make sense to me. And it's just another example of the President treating foreign policy like it's some kind of game show\u201d #CNNSOTU pic.twitter.com/xAfHOil11L \u2014 CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) September 8, 2019\n\nEchoing Klobuchar\u2019s point, Democratic presidential candidate Juli\u00e1n Castro, who served as Housing and Urban Development secretary under the Obama administration, called Trump\u2019s planned negotiations \u201cvery odd,\u201d drawing a parallel to his \u201celevation\u201d of Kim with several summits.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s another bizarre episode,\u201d Castro said. \u201cIt\u2019s more of his erratic behavior that people are tired of, and that\u2019s one of the reasons I believe that he\u2019s going to lose in 2020.\u201d\n\nJuli\u00e1n Castro on President Trump saying he called off Afghan peace talks with the Taliban: \u201cIt's another bizarre episode.

John Delaney (D-Md.), another presidential contender, also denounced Trump\u2019s actions, noting that to this day, first responders are still dying from the detrimental health effects they faced at ground zero.\n\nHis message came in reaction to Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), who tweeted, \u201cNever should leaders of a terrorist organization that hasn\u2019t renounced 9/11 and continues in evil be allowed in our great country.\u201d\n\nKinzinger wasn\u2019t the only Republican to take a stand on the matter. In a statement of her own, Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) said under no circumstances should Taliban leaders be welcomed to Camp David.\n\n.@RepKinzinger is 100% right. I'm generally supportive of peace talks but NOT this way. Brave first responders are dying everyday as a result of their efforts on that dark day; daughters are walking down the isle without their dads, sons are graduating college without their moms. https://t.co/2RX3USR98S \u2014 John Delaney (@JohnDelaney) September 8, 2019\n\nCamp David is where America\u2019s leaders met to plan our response after al Qaeda, supported by the Taliban, killed 3000 Americans on 9/11.\n\n\n\nNo member of the Taliban should set foot there. Ever.\n\n\n\nThe Taliban still harbors al Qaeda.\n\nThe President is right to end the talks. \u2014 Liz Cheney (@Liz_Cheney) September 8, 2019\n\nRep. Justin Amash (I-Mich.), who ditched the Republican Party in July over its transformation under Trump, later chimed in on the criticism, asking, \u201cHow about we end the war without inviting the Taliban to dinner on the week of 9/11?\u201d", "description": "The now-canceled negotiations were set to take place at Camp David just days before the anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the president reve...", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d755205240000822677c742.jpeg?cache=vku8bi4szz&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
