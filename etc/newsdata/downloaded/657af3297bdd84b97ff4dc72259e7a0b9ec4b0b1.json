UEFA is expected to wait for reports from the match delegate and referee before charging the Bulgarian soccer federation.\n\nUEFA said Tuesday it is awaiting notification of a formal case from its disciplinary committee.\n\nBulgaria hosted England in a partially closed stadium in Sofia as punishment for \"racist behavior\" by fans during a previous home qualifier against Kosovo in June.\n\n\"A second offence is punished with one match played behind closed doors and a fine of 50,000 euros ($55,100),\" the UEFA disciplinary regulations state.\n\nEngland\\'s Raheem Sterling.
