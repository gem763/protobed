The Fed had cut rates in September and said that future reductions would be \"data-dependent\".\n\nStill, a sharp selloff this week has put the S&P 500 on course for its worst week in six, while the Dow was headed for its biggest weekly drop in two months.\n\nShares of Apple Inc rose 1.9%, providing the biggest boost to all three indexes, after a report that the company would ramp up production of iPhone 11 models.\n\nAt 10:15 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 176.96 points, or 0.68%, at 26,378.00, the S&P 500 was up 19.85 points, or 0.68%, at 2,930.48. The Nasdaq Composite was up 57.91 points, or 0.74%, at 7,930.18.\n\nHP Inc tumbled 8.7% after the PC maker said it would cut up to 16% of its workforce as part of a restructuring plan that would result in an overall charge of $1 billion.\n\nInvestors will also keep an eye on U.S. central bank chief Jerome Powell's remarks on Friday for clues on what the Fed would do at its policy meeting later this month. He is due to speak at 2:00 p.m. ET (1800 GMT) in Washington.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.74-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.55-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\n\nThe S&P index recorded 10 new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded six new highs and 23 new lows.
