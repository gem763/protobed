But that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t worth it.\n\nOnce there, it\u2019s clear there\u2019s more to Fiji than the aquamarine waters and white sand beaches that have made it a top honeymoon destination. Forget the sunset walks and candlelit dinners: there\u2019s a wealth of opportunities for adventure seekers and adrenaline junkies.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

However, your eyes soon acclimatise, and swimming back out is a doddle compared to going in \u2013 simply head towards the light.\n\nYou can visit the Sawa-i-Lau caves by boat or as part of a cruise, such as Captain Cook Cruises, Blue Lagoon Cruises or Awesome Adventures Fiji.\n\nClimb a mountain\n\nReaching 763ft above sea level, the climb to the top of Mount Tamasua in the Yasawa Islands is steep but not too long \u2013 it takes about half an hour if you\u2019re walking at a decent pace.\n\nThe soil is crumbly so the descent is more difficult than climbing up, but the reward for venturing through the giant succulents and lush scenery to the peak is views over the Blue Lagoon, tropical reefs and Sawa-i-Lau island.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re willing to get up early enough, you\u2019ll catch the sunrise too.\n\nIsland-hop by seaplane\n\nAs beautiful as the Fijian islands are from the ground and as wonderful as the ocean is when you\u2019re submerged in it, there\u2019s nothing like seeing the land and seascapes from the sky.\n\nJump in a seaplane for a day of island-hopping, where you\u2019ll view turquoise reefs and lush islands from a height of around 1,000ft.\n\nAs well as the captivating scenes below, experience the thrill of taking off from and landing on water \u2013 it\u2019s much more fun than an airport runway.\n\nTravel essentials\n\nGetting there\n\nReturn flights from Heathrow to Fiji (Nadi) via Hong Kong cost \u00a31,183 with British Airways.\n\nMore information\n\nfiji.travel", "description": "With the Duke and Duchess of Sussex paying a 2018 visit to Fiji as part of their tour Down Under, the 333 islands are having a moment \u2013 despite their far-flung location.", "authors": ["Rachel Hosie"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/12/14/17/aerial-beach-dk.jpg"}
