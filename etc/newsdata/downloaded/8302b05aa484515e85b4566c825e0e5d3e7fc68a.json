Despite South Africa's big win in a warmup match last month against Japan, it's the game four years ago that is getting most attention before this Sunday's quarterfinal at Tokyo Stadium. Japan's win over the Springboks at Brighton in 2015 was the biggest shocker ever at the tournament.\n\nThis time, the Japan team knows it won't be sneaking up on any teams.\n\nWales and France will also confirm their lineups for their quarterfinal meeting in Oita on Sunday.\n\nIn the first of the quarterfinals on Saturday, Australia and England will meet in Oita and New Zealand will play Ireland in Tokyo.\n\nJapan coach Jamie Joseph watches his players train in Tokyo, Japan, Thursday, Oct. 17, 2019.
