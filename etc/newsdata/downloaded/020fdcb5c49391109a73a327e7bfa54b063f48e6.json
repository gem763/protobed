A lot of people speak a lot of b******* and it's always the same.'\n\nThe Arsenal captain also refused to use his side's character as an excuse for the defeat at Bramall Lane.\n\n'We have to stop talking about [the mental side of the game] and b******* like this,'\n\n'I'm sorry to say that, but for me it's the same whether you play at home or away \u2013 you have to win and show big character and not look for the same excuse.'\n\nLys Mousset pops up to score an easy tap in that secured a memorable 1-0 win for the Blades\n\nIn Evra's damning verdict of the Gunners, he also said he would relish coming up against Arsenal during his time as a Manchester United player because he sensed they were vulnerable, adding: 'I was so happy to play against them because I knew I was going to win'.\n\nHe also revealed a conversation he had with former Arsenal striker Robin van Persie when the Dutchman famously joined United from north London in 2012.\n\n'Even when Robin van Persie came and the first day I shook his hand and I said, \"Welcome to a man club\".\n\nEvra said that former Arsenal striker Robin van Persie agreed with his sentiments on Arsenal\n\nThe Frenchman said that nothing has changed in their mentality since Arsene Wenger left\n\n'At the beginning he was upset but after one month he said, \"You\u2019re completely right Patrice\". And that's my feeling.\n\n'Nothing has changed - I'm like where is Arsene? Where is Wenger? Because it's the same.'\n\nIn his appearance on Sky Sports, Evra had admitted feeling 'sad' for Luis Suarez in the wake of their racism row as Jamie Carragher apologised for the T-shirts Liverpool wore in support of the striker.\n\nSuarez served an eight-match ban eight years ago after racially abusing Evra during a match between Liverpool and Manchester United at Anfield in October 2011.\n\nEvra recounted the racism row with Liverpool striker Luis Suarez from eight years ago\n\nThe Uruguayan then failed to shake his opponent's hand in the return match at Old Trafford later in the season.\n\nAnd Evra opened up on the whole period during Monday Night Football, admitting that he can't call Suarez a racist, insisting he just used some racist words.\n\nHe said of the failed handshake episode: 'It was unbelievable. All the week, people asking are you going to shake his hand? I was frustrated, I wanted people to talk about the game.\n\n'My Mum asked me and I said \"Mummy I say I'm someone who will forgive, I will shake his hand no matter what\" and he made a mistake - I won't go on holiday with him.\n\n'When he didn't I was like \"what's wrong with that guy, he makes himself worse\". I'm feeling sad for him.'\n\nLiverpool wore t-shirts in support of Suarez in the warmup for a match at Wigan that season\n\nLiverpool courted controversy when they and then-manager Kenny Dalglish wore 'Suarez 7' T-shirts in the warm-up for a clash at Wigan, in support of their player.\n\nEvra said the incident was 'ridiculous', adding: 'Even for the club you put it in danger. You always have to support your players, but this was after the ban. What message are you sending to the world when you do that?'\n\nFellow pundit Carragher, who was Liverpool vice-captain at the time and in the squad, admitted: 'We made a massive mistake, that was obvious'.\n\nJamie Carragher, who was Liverpool vice-captain at the time, has apologised for the episode\n\n'Maybe I look at myself now I didn't have the courage to say... I don't think everyone at the club thought what we were doing was right.\n\n'As a family, football club, your first reaction is to support them and that's wrong.\n\n'I'm not condoning Suarez, it was wrong, for clubs that is the first reaction. And we got it wrong, apologies.'", "description": "Arsenal lost 1-0 on Monday night at Sheffield United courtesy of Lys Mousset's first half goal and afterwards former Manchester United man Patrice Evra said he was not shocked by the result.", "authors": ["Amitai Winehouse For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/09/20026956-0-image-a-36_1571734121797.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
