At a minimum, AG Barr must recuse himself until we get to the bottom of this matter,\u201d House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler said on Twitter.\n\n\u201cAttorney General Barr must set aside from this investigation,\u201d Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas) wrote on Twitter. \u201cHe\u2019s a witness that will be called to testify.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t immediately clear what investigations the Democratic lawmakers were calling on Barr to step aside from. The initial Justice Department statement Wednesday said the agency\u2019s Criminal Division concluded that Trump\u2019s request to Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky didn\u2019t violate campaign finance law.\n\n\u201cAll relevant components of the Department agreed with this legal conclusion, and the Department has concluded the matter,\u201d Kupec said.\n\nStill, the scandal marks the latest example of Barr stoking questions of whether he is prioritizing Trump\u2019s interests over those of the Justice Department. The attorney general raised eyebrows before even being confirmed after he wrote a memo to DOJ officials asserting that Trump\u2019s interactions with ex-FBI director James Comey did not amount to obstruction of justice.\n\nHe further caused alarm when he appeared to front run special counsel Robert Mueller, characterizing Mueller\u2019s conclusions as an exoneration of Trump. The attorney general also caused a stir when it was revealed last month that he had booked Trump Hotel for a 200-person holiday party that he was hosting and paying for.\n\nNew Window How to read Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president: A line-by-line analysis of the conversation that launched an impeachment inquiry.\n\nNow, Barr\u2019s central role in Trump\u2019s Ukraine mess is reviving critics\u2019 concerns about whether he is independent enough from his boss. Some former Justice Department officials said Barr should have completely detached himself from analysis of Trump\u2019s conduct or the whistleblower complaint that Justice officials concluded was not required to be relayed to Congress.\n\n\u201cHow could Barr decide DOJ, and not a Special Counsel, decides this?\u201d former acting Solicitor General Neal Katyal wrote on Twitter. \u201cThis is the paradigmatic case for it\u2014involves possible wrongdoing by POTUS + now Barr himself mentioned in the \u2018transcript.\u2019 SC regs wouldn\u2019t say Barr can then take case and clear Pres.\u201d\n\nKupec said Barr didn\u2019t formally step aside from the issue but the legal questions surrounding the whistleblower complaint were decided by the Justice\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel, which is headed by Steven Engel. He signed the opinion released Wednesday but arrived at in classified form back on Sept. 3.\n\n\u201cThere was no recusal \u2013 OLC handled the advice to DNI,\u201d the Justice spokeswoman said.\n\nDespite the assurances, Barr critics said the handling of complaint continued a pattern of covering for the president.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like they were a key part of the cover up rather than an independent actor pursuing justice,\u201d former Justice spokesman Matt Miller tweeted.\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Xavier Becerra said the latest all-consuming Trump scandal has clearly put Barr in an undesirable spot.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s beyond Watergate. It\u2019s beyond Nixonian,\u201d Becerra told reporters at a news conference in Davis, Calif. \u201cWhat I think is truly a bombshell is that President Trump included the nation\u2019s attorney general, Bill Barr, in his conversation along with his personal political attorney Rudy Giuliani, as the two people that the Ukrainian president should be consulting with in this despicable act to try to create an investigation of Vice President Biden and his family.\u201d\n\nBecerra added, \u201cWhy is it that Attorney General Barr did not recuse himself from any consideration of what should be done with the whistleblower\u2019s complaint? And so, while I think the president is clearly in deep trouble, I think he\u2019s bringing a whole bunch of folks with him as well.\u201d\n\n", "description": "The scandal marks the latest example of whether Barr is prioritizing Trump\u2019s interests over those of the Justice Department.", "authors": ["Josh Gerstein"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/51/12/87d6e38a499088f3189063f6e559/19925-william-barr-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
