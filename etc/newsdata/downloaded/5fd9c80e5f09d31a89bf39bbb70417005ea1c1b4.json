If the opportunity is there and you feel like you can do it, then do it.\n\n\u201cBut I would say if you are in two minds and there\u2019s a bit of doubt, then rather tuck it and try to play one or more phases, and see if you can break the defence and get over the advantage line.\u201d\n\nSouth Africa, who lost 23-13 to NZ in their opening Pool B game, finished runners-up behind the All Blacks and will play the winner of the tightly contested Pool A next Sunday in Tokyo.\n\nDe Allende added that after that opening loss to the All Blacks the side had adapted a knockout mentality for their next three games against Namibia, Italy and Canada with the objective to qualify with bonus-point victories from those matches.\n\n\u201cWe were under a lot more pressure - and I don\u2019t mean that in a negative way,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe knew we had to win at least three of our games with a bonus point, and that is where the pressure came on us a bit.\n\n\u201cLuckily we exceeded those expectations.\u201d", "description": "South Africa midfield back Damian de Allende is unlikely to abandon his conservative playing style any time soon with the World Cup quarter-finals a week away and defences adept at shutting down attacking options out wide.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191012&t=2&i=1440012836&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9B0CC", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
