He said GDP growth is around 2% rate, with a \u201cvery strong\u201d labor market and inflation near a 2% rate.\n\nWilliams noted economists have been notoriously unable to predict recessions.\n\n\u201cEconomists are really good at saying we just had a recession. They are not so good at expecting a recession,\u201d he said.\n\nWhere is the economy going from here? Williams said it was a \u201cmixed picture.\u201d\n\nGlobal economic growth has slowed, trade disputes, and other geopolitical tensions have led to higher uncertainty and this seems to have contributed to a pullback of business investment, and trade between nations seems to be slowing down, he said.\n\n\u201cI think there are definitely a lot of uncertainties and risks out there that we need to be navigating,\u201d Williams said.\n\nThe Fed is grappling with the how to model trade uncertainty, he said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have as much experience with this,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd sentiment seems to change from one week to another, Williams noted.\n\nStocks fell sharply Wednesday on recession fears. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -1.86% closed down 494 points to 26,078.\n\nWilliams, a member of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell\u2019s inner circle, didn\u2019t give any guidance about whether the U.S. central bank would cut interest-rates again at its late October meeting.\n\nThe Fed has cut rates by a quarter-point at its last two meetings.\n\nInvestors think there is a high probability the Fed will cut rates again on Oct. 30.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said the Fed might be cautious going foward given all the uncertainty facing the economy.\n\nRead: Fed\u2019s Barkin says now might be the time for caution", "description": "New York Fed President John Williams on Wednesday downplayed recession fears, saying the baseline economic forecast remains positive.", "authors": ["Greg Robb", "Senior Economics Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HN376_FedWil_ZG_20190715171638.jpg"}
