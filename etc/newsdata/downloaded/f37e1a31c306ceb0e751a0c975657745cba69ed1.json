All were wearing high-visibility jackets and \u201cpress\u201d markings.\n\nIndonesian Veby Indah was injured during protests two days earlier, while standing with colleagues on an overpass, filming a livestream.

The exact percentage of permanent impairment can only be assessed after surgery\u201d.\n\nThe 39-year-old is an associate editor of Suara Hong Kong News, a local outlet which serves the city\u2019s Indonesian community.\n\nThe Hong Kong Journalists Association said it would investigate Vedy\u2019s case. \u201cWe are particularly concerned ... [because] the journalist was not in the immediate vicinity of protesters at the time of the incident, she was clearly identifiable as being a member of the press and was with a number of other journalists at the time also wearing high visibility press markings.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cone country, two systems\u201d arrangement put in place when Hong Kong returned from British colonial rule to Chinese sovereignty protects freedom of the press, and the protests have been covered by hundreds of local and international reporters.\n\nBut there are growing fears that violence and heavy-handed policing is obstructing the media. Alleged protester threats against pro-Beijing outlets are also a concern.\n\nOn Tuesday several journalists were injured in \u2018day of grief\u2019 protests called to mark China\u2019s national day. Pang Pui Yin, a reporter for the Chinese-language news website Local Press, was arrested by police as they dispersed protesters in Mong Kok district, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.\n\nEven though he was clearly identified as a member of the press corps, police initially accused him of unlawful assembly, then bailed him after alleging that he assaulted a police officer. He has been released on bail, but the CPJ called for authorities to drop all charges, and \u201ccease harassing journalists covering protests.\u201d\n\nJournalists who were injured that day include one working for public broadcaster RTHK, who was hit in the head with \u201csome kind of projectile\u201d.

Stand News reported several injuries, including one journalist who was hit in the face by what was thought to be a sponge-tipped round. Another was hit by a rubber bullet.\n\nPolice were also accused of pushing and shoving reporters, and one video posted online showed officers aiming a gun at the face of reporters, who were wearing \u201cpress\u201d markings and high-visibility vests.\n\nProtesters on Wednesday apologised for spraying corrosive material on a journalist while targeting police officers. Police officials have not commented on media injuries.\n\nThe Hong Kong Journalists Association warned that journalists had a right to work without violence or obstruction.\n\n\u201cWe strongly condemn all acts of violence against front-line journalists and urge the police and demonstrators to refrain from maliciously obstructing their regular interviews,\u201d the Hong Kong Journalists Association sad in a statement.\n\n\u201cAnyone who intimidates or attacks front-line journalists on the ground seriously interferes with the freedom of the press and weakens the public\u2019s right to know.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Lillian Yang", "description": "Journalists Association says it will investigate police shooting of reporter at relatively short range with rubber bullet", "authors": ["Emma Graham-Harrison"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a2ab3e4c1512d81d696f4ec13e001bb228cc8f5/0_365_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=837438a4fd936165b29cde6aac2fae64"}
