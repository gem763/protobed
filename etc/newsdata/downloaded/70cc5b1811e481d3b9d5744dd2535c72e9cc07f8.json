For centuries, people thought they weren't real.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nThe Kraken, the mythical beast of the sea, is real.\n\nGiant squid live in the dark depths of the ocean, and very little is known about them to this day.\n\nGiant_Squid_NASA More\n\nMost of what the world has learned about the gargantuan creature, which can grow up to 40 feet long and live in a world devoid of sunlight, is taken from their floating carcasses, or from the belly of sperm whales.\n\nUntil 2005, no scientist had ever photographed a living giant squid. One hadn't been filmed until 2013. But scientists believe there are millions of them out there.\n\nIn June, a NOAA Office of Ocean Exploration and Research expedition captured the first footage of a giant squid in American waters.\n\nThe New Yorker's David Grann wrote that giant squid can be \"larger than a whale and stronger than an elephant, with a beak that can sever steel cables.\"\n\nHere's what is known about the mysterious beast, and why so much is still not known.\n\nLiving 1,300 to 3,000 feet down in the ocean, giant squid inhabit the deepest, darkest places in the world. No one knows for sure how long they live for, how they find partners, how they migrate, where they lay their eggs, or even if they make any sounds. To put it bluntly, the giant squid remains a mystery.\n\nNhk/Nep/Discovery Channel/NHK/NEP/DISCOVERY CHANNEL/AFP", "description": "Giant squid have been recorded in US waters for the first time in history.
