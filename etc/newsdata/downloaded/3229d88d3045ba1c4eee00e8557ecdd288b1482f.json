[Photo/Xinhua]\n\nBERN, Switzerland - State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said here on Tuesday that the United Nations (UN) should become the main platform to practice multilateralism.\n\nAnswering a question during a joint press conference with Swiss Minister of Foreign Affairs Ignazio Cassis in Bern, Wang said that Oct 24 (United Nations Day) is the annual day to mark the founding anniversary of the United Nations, adding that Switzerland is an important venue of multilateral institutions such as the United Nations and the World Trade Organization (WTO).\n\nHe said that it is of special significance to be here to recall the original intention of the establishment of the United Nations, as well as the original ideals and aspirations related to that institution, and to adhere to peace.\n\nThe United Nations was founded after the painful lessons of World War II, and has played an indispensable role in safeguarding world security and stability, Wang said.\n\nNoting that unilateralism and power politics are on the rise in the world, Wang said the authority and status of the United Nations are being challenged as never before.\n\nUnited Nations Day offers an opportunity to review the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, Wang said, while urging countries to abide by the basic norms of international relations, unite against unilateralism and bullying, and safeguard the status and authority of the United Nations.\n\nThe United Nations should become the main platform to practice multilateralism, Wang said.\n\n\"We shall work together to meet various challenges. The United Nations should become the main channel for the peaceful settlement of hot issues, and settle disputes through dialogue and consultation. The United Nations should be the main driving force for the development of human society and actively promote the implementation of the (UN) 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda,\" Wang added.\n\nHe said that the United Nations should keep pace with the times and constantly reform and improve itself. Considering that most of the member countries that joined the United Nations after World War II are developing countries, the United Nations should respect the stances of developing countries and safeguard their legitimate rights and interests.\n\nHe added that China was among the first countries to sign the UN Charter. As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China will do its part to fulfill its international obligations and work with other countries to safeguard the international system with the United Nations at the core, maintain the basic norms of international relations based on the UN Charter, and support the authority of the United Nations and its central role in international affairs.", "description": "Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said here on Tuesday that the United Nations (UN) should become the main platform to practice multilateralism.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/24/5db15411a310cf3e97a2c961.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
