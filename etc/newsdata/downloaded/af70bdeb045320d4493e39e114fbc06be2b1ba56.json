A rigid ideologue, Mr. Bolton has a long record of championing military action against U.S. adversaries, which Mr. Trump resists, and opposing negotiation with the likes of North Korea and Iran, which is the president\u2019s natural instinct. He didn\u2019t alter those views to suit Mr. Trump, and instead battled those who catered to the president\u2019s wishes \u2014 most notably, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Mr. Trump was no doubt telling the truth, for once, when he tweeted, \u201cI disagreed strongly with many of [Mr. Bolton\u2019s] suggestions, as did others in the Administration.\u201d\n\nYet Mr. Bolton, who served in previous Republican administrations, can hardly be blamed for the falling-out. His ultra-hawkish views and habit of bureaucratic infighting were well known, even notorious, in Washington when Mr. Trump hired him in April of last year. But the president, in the hunt for his third national security adviser in just 15 months, simply disregarded the facts. Apparently Mr. Bolton was picked because Mr. Trump had enjoyed watching him on television. The result was to compound the chaos that has characterized the administration\u2019s foreign policy and left Mr. Trump without meaningful accomplishments.\n\nPerversely, considering how out of sync he was with Mr. Trump\u2019s priorities, Mr. Bolton managed to accomplish a fair amount \u2014 if mostly in a negative sense. Last week he helped persuade Mr. Trump to torpedo an agreement with the Afghan Taliban, painstakingly negotiated by the State Department over the course of nearly a year, just before it was to be signed. Earlier this year, he induced the president to set aside State\u2019s work on a possible interim deal with North Korea on its nuclear program, and instead demand that dictator Kim Jong Un immediately commit to giving up all weapons of mass destruction. That helped to precipitate the collapse of the Trump-Kim summit in Hanoi and has led to a prolonged lapse in negotiations, during which North Korea has been testing new missiles.\n\nThe national security adviser\u2019s principal responsibility has traditionally been to oversee a disciplined policymaking process that includes the State Department, the Pentagon and intelligence agencies, and to tee up big decisions for the president. Mr. Bolton didn\u2019t do that. Instead, he sniped at initiatives undertaken by others, like the North Korea talks and Afghan negotiations, and pursued long-standing pet causes of his own \u2014 such as his pointless crusade against the International Criminal Court. He championed an attempted coup against Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, which fell flat.\n\nThis dysfunction was, of course, enabled and even encouraged by Mr. Trump, who has shown no interest in orderly process. During Mr. Bolton\u2019s tenure, the president abruptly reversed course on bombing Iran, as well as making peace with the Taliban, and it has been impossible to keep track of his seesawing positions on China. \u201cSorry, it\u2019s the way I negotiate,\u201d he recently told reporters. Mr. Trump\u2019s fourth national security adviser, if he can find one, will have to be a lot more pliable than Mr. Bolton.", "description": "The national security adviser repeatedly clashed with Trump.", "authors": ["Editorial Board", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Lri5629IMTbInkbFP2oxx-p69PE=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YR2BFWGDQII6TC7XZXRNTYEQKU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
