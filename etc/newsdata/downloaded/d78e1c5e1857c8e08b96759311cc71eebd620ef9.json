They opted to throw the ball on the next four downs and all four passes fell incomplete, which left the score unchanged and left Packers head coach Matt LaFleur to say it was a \u201cgreat question\u201d to ask why the team didn\u2019t try at least one run play to get the ball in the end zone.\n\nOutside of runs by Aaron Rodgers, the Packers managed 31 yards on 15 attempts and LaFleur\u2019s answers about going pass-heavy focused on that lack of success as well as the impact of losing Jamaal Williams to an injury early in the game. LaFleur also noted that having Rodgers played a role in his thinking.\n\n\u201cWhen you have one of the greatest quarterbacks ever, you trust him to continually gain yards and get down the field.
