Wade will also contribute to Turner Sports\u2019 and CBS Sports\u2019 coverage of the men\u2019s basketball Final Four.\n\n\"I\u2019m thrilled and grateful to be joining the WarnerMedia family with many exciting opportunities ahead,\" Wade said in a statement. \"I have great respect for TNT\u2019s team of analysts and their longstanding commitment to quality sports coverage. After sixteen seasons in the NBA, I look forward to connecting with my fans in this new role and bringing my own perspective to the game I love.\"\n\nWade retired after last season \u2014 a 16-year career that included three NBA titles, 13 All-Star Games, eight All-NBA selections and a scoring title. He is one of the greatest shooting guards in NBA history and will be inducted to the Basketball Hall of Fame when he is eligible.\n\nLate in the 2018-19 season, USA TODAY Sports caught up with Wade, and he reflected on his career and retirement from basketball.\n\nAsked what he planned to do with his post-NBA career, Wade said, \"I have no idea. I know I have a lot of kids. I have a beautiful wife (Gabrielle Union) who has a career. I know I\u2019ve got a lot of business things I\u2019m doing. From there, I\u2019ll figure everything else out. It\u2019s going to be different. It\u2019s going to be tough.\"\n\nWade\u2019s son, Zaire, attends Sierra Canyon (Chatsworth, California), and plays on the basketball team with LeBron James\u2019 son, LeBron Jr.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for Wade to figure out what he wanted to do, which is what he did on the court: entertain.\n\n\"Dwyane is a special talent,\" Jeff Zucker, chairman of WarnerMedia News and Sports, said in a statement. \"He\u2019s a transcendent star with a charismatic, engaging and thoughtful personality on and off the court. We\u2019re thrilled to welcome him to the WarnerMedia family and we could not be more excited to partner with him on these special projects.\"\n\nFollow Jeff Zillgitt on Twitter @JeffZillgitt", "description": "Three-time NBA champion and future Hall of Famer Dwyane Wade also will take on role with Bleacher Report in deal with WarnerMedia.", "authors": ["Jeff Zillgitt", "Published P.M.
