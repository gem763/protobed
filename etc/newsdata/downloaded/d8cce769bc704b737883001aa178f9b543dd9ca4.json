'All of this was untrue. Much about the character of Julia I took from my own life, my family.'\n\nNot shy when it came to confronting racial barriers, Carroll won her Tony portraying a high-fashion American model in Paris who has a love affair with a white American author in the 1959 Richard Rodgers musical 'No Strings.' Critic Walter Kerr described her as 'a girl with a sweet smile, brilliant dark eyes and a profile regal enough to belong on a coin.'\n\nCarroll giving her award acceptance speech at the 1962 Tony Awards after winning for her work in 'No Strings'\n\nCarroll in the role of 'Julia Baker' in pioneering show 'Julia.'

She began with a secondary role in 'Carmen Jones' in 1954 and five years later appeared in 'Porgy and Bess,' although her singing voice was dubbed because it wasn't considered strong enough for the Gershwin opera. Her other films included 'Goodbye Again,' ''Hurry Sundown,' ''Paris Blues,' and 'The Split.'\n\nThe 1974 film 'Claudine' provided her most memorable role. She played a hard-bitten single mother of six who finds romance in Harlem with a garbage man played by James Earl Jones.\n\nDiahann Carroll pictured at the Emmy Awards in Los Angeles (left) on September 20, 1987.
