We\u2019ve been here before, through numerous scandals, and always the result is the same: the man at the top has seen his reputation trashed but has made tons over the years and that money, presumably, is safe; meanwhile, the ordinary punter loses their savings. And, yet again, between them is a respectable City brand that sold themselves on trust, and that reassurance was found to be wanting. Not for the first time, too, there is a regulator that failed to read the warning signs and did not act.\n\nThat thunderous noise you can hear is also one that is all too familiar to followers of these sad sagas. It\u2019s of horses bolting and stable doors closing.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

They know that almost 300,000 customers of Hargreaves Lansdown saw their cash disappear as they followed the recommendation of the online investment management supermarket that made Woodford\u2019s fund one of its \u201cbest buys\u201d.\n\nAt the heart of this disaster is rank complacency and carelessness, driven by those three letters long-favoured in the City, and the cause of many a crisis: OPM or Other People\u2019s Money. Those twin villains of ego and hubris played their usual crucial part.\n\nWhen he was with Invesco, Woodford earned his stellar status on the back of buying stock in dull, unheralded companies that paid good dividends. So brilliant was he that Woodford attracted camp followers \u2013 he was watched like a hawk to see where he was going next, and others would quickly pile in.\n\nOnce he was on his own, impatient and possibly anxious to show he could repeat the trick, Woodford went for riskier tech and early-stage growth businesses. Unfortunately, too late, his supporters only noticed the shift when those purchases began to under-perform. Woodford could find no buyers for tech shares that were going nowhere except down. He and his fans were soon trapped in a vicious, downward spiral.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Business news: In pictures Show all 11 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.\n\nBut where did those investors emanate from? There\u2019s no doubt that they were drawn to Woodford by Hargreaves Lansdown. They were the same as would-be diners scanning a restaurant guide for somewhere decent to eat \u2013 they were entitled to reason that the compilers of the ranking had sampled the food, and were keeping it monitored. That\u2019s why you pay good money for the guide; that\u2019s why they paid a fee to Hargreaves Lansdown. No matter that Woodford gave Hargreaves Lansdown customers a discount for choosing his funds. The fact that Hargreaves Lansdown was promoting them, and putting them in its \u201cWealth 50\u201d list, was the real attraction \u2013 the fee reduction was merely icing.\n\nThey still paid cash to Hargreaves Lansdown, even at the discounted rate, and it\u2019s fair now, to ask: for what? They justifiably most likely thought at the very least the firm would have done due diligence, and Woodford\u2019s funds were being highlighted for a reason.\n\nWhat might have given them pause is if they were aware that Woodford\u2019s inclusion on the list did not technically count as investment advice from Hargreaves Lansdown. Neither did the \u201cbest buy\u201d rating fall under the aegis of the Financial Conduct Authority. As such, because it did not qualify as financial advice, it remained unregulated. No one was casting an experienced, objective eye over the \u201cWealth 50\u201d, no one was asking why a fund was there, and whether it should remain.\n\nOf course, when the Hargreaves Lansdown chiefs and the officials from the watchdog come to investing their own money they may take a different, more scrutinising attitude. But this was OPM, and the standards were not so high.\n\nIt was really all about marketing, about attracting investors and their cash, rather than paying due care and attention to where their money was heading. The more people who were drawn in, the greater the revenue for Hargreaves Lansdown, and the larger the fund for Woodford. Theirs was also a spiral for a while, one that was upward.\n\nBut shares can go down as well as up. It\u2019s the most overlooked warning there is, the one that is usually gabbled at ferocious pace at the end of a radio promotion or is tucked away in the small print in a brochure or newspaper advertisement. People are not stupid \u2013 they know shares can fall. They know, though, that the investment platform is charging them, and they assume that someone they trust, someone they\u2019re paying, is reasonably confident that these shares or in Woodford\u2019s case, this fund, is not so risky.\n\nIt\u2019s rank indifference, hypocrisy even, that never fails to deliver: on the one hand, a big City name is pushing something; on the other, the big City name has done virtually nothing to justify its branding being used. Without actually seeing it, you can imagine the shrug: it\u2019s OPM, so who cares?\n\nIn the Woodford collapse, it would pay to see the internal workings of Hargreaves Lansdown in relation to him and his funds, and the correspondence between them. It\u2019s possible that what might be revealed is a high degree of probing and questioning. Or not. I know which one my money is on \u2013 and I suspect it\u2019s a safer bet than following Hargreaves Lansdown\u2019s choice of Woodford.", "description": "As\u00a0the dust settles on the Neil Woodford investment empire, the overwhelming feelings are of anger and deja vu.\u00a0We\u2019ve been here before, through numerous scandals, and always the result is the same: the man at the top has seen his reputation trashed but has made tons over the years and that money, presumably, is safe; meanwhile, the ordinary punter loses their savings.
