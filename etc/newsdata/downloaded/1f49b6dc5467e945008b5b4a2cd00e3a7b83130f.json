In his final three matches, against fifth-seeded Lucas Pouille, third-seeded David Goffin and Millman - all of whom have made a Grand Slam quarterfinal - Djokovic lost a total of 15 games.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t drop a set all week so I played fantastic tennis,\u201d said Djokovic who will next play in Shanghai. \u201cThere are not many negatives here that I can point out so I\u2019m going to Shanghai with great confidence and hope I can finish the year in style.\u201d\n\nSunday\u2019s final followed a familiar pattern to his previous matches here with Djokovic breaking Millman to go up 3-1 in the first set with a perfectly placed forehand volley to the corner.\n\n\u201cObviously the key was to try to fight off the resistance early in the match because he didn\u2019t have much to lose playing finals from qualifications,\u201d Djokovic said. \u201cHe came out and played pretty well but I made that crucial break and I was serving very well which allowed me to get a set advantage.\u201d\n\nThe second set was even more dominant as Djokovic broke his opponent twice to go up 3-0 then held serve the rest of the way.\n\nDjokovic lost only four first-serve points and hit six aces.\n\nDjokovic retired with a left-shoulder injury during his fourth-round match against Stan Wawrinka at the U.S. Open but has shown no lingering effects in Tokyo.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know until one week before the start of this tournament that I would be here,\u201d Djokovic said. \u201cThat\u2019s when I made a decision with my team that I was ready to play.\u201d\n\nThe 32-year-old Serb is making a push to finish as year-end No. 1 for the sixth time, which would tie the mark held by Pete Sampras.\n\nDjokovic now stands alone in third place on the ATP Tour this year with 46 tour-level wins, breaking a tie with Roger Federer. The only players ahead of him are Daniil Medvedev (54) and Rafael Nadal (48).\n\n___\n\nMore AP Tennis: https://www.apnews.com/apf-Tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Novak Djokovic couldn't have asked for a better tournament debut in Tokyo.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jim Armstrong"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/06/japan_open_tennis_11899_c0-117-2806-1753_s1770x1032.jpg?97db1c8bd42ef339b08a97e123d2f6e75ab1b508", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
