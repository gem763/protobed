They produce 5 per cent of the nation's watermelons. The Greensill family's farming business was established by their grandfather Roy in 1947.\n\nLex, whose worth rose to $712 million, has returned from his home in London this week to visit the farms, a trip he does about eight times a year.\n\n\"The joke in the family is that Andrew and Peter are operators of equipment and Lex is just a driver,\" Lex says of his family's indulgence of his time on the harvester.\n\nAdviser to David Cameron\n\nIt's a world away from London, where Lex now rubs shoulders with well-known English executives and politicians \u2013 he was an adviser to former prime minister David Cameron, who he now counts as a friend. He's also advised the White House on supply-chain finance and last year was made a Commander of the British Empire for his services to the British economy.\n\nSteve Smith debuts even after a horror year Atlassian duo supercharge a record year of wealth The fitness star and the Millennial bank Atlassian co-founders Australia\u2019s richest young entrepreneurs Targeting Uber drivers a splendid move for Chris King Where are the women?

Lex studied law at Queensland University of Technology. Andrew, who has a 10 per cent stake in the farming group and doesn't own shares in Greensill Capital, completed an \u00adagricultural \u00adscience degree, while Peter went to agricultural college.\n\n\"Dad sent all of us away, told none of us that we could have a job on the family farm,\" Lex recalls.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"He wanted us all to get a qualification and make our own way in the world. Peter and Andrew in many respects were more capable than me in managing to find their way back to farming and in the family farming business.\"\n\nPeter and Andrew have built and expanded the farming operations (so successful was the watermelon operation it provided enough capital to buy out their parents in 2008). What was a 27-hectare post-war farm has been transformed into a 2000-hectare operation worth an estimated $55 million. Peter and Andrew are a relatively rare commodity: the average age of the Australian farmer is 56.\n\nImpact of late payments\n\n\"It's not extremely difficult to find people that are excited about agriculture, it's probably more difficult for people to string together the business and the operating system and the capital to allow a modern agricultural business to evolve and happen,\" Peter says.\n\n\"I think probably a lot of the exit you see of young agribusiness folk or potentially young farmers is more around being unable to string all of those requirements together.\"\n\nLex's experience growing up on the farm helped shape Greensill Capital. He saw the impact that late payments can have on small farming operations dealing with large multinationals.\n\nThat, and working on supply chain finance for Morgan Stanley and Citigroup. Lex thought the big banks were struggling to \"do it well\".\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile he saw an opportunity to start his own business he was initially reluctant. At the time his wife was pregnant with their first child and Lex wasn't entirely sure that if becoming a father would trigger a need to be more \"responsible\" and stay at a stable job with a big-name bank.\n\n\"The day I got back from paternity leave I handed in my notice and I started my firm,\" Lex recalls.\n\nNever looked back\n\nHe's never looked back. Greensill Capital posted a $20.1 million profit in the 12 months to December 31, 2017. He's now focused on \"exponential\" growth. In the first six months of 2018 Greensill Capital has delivered $3 billion in credit to 25,000 small and medium businesses across Australia, or four times what it managed for all of 2017.\n\n\"Our business is [delivering] ultra-cheap capital to small businesses in every corner of the world. We have democratised capital. That business is a business that isn't just a business that makes money but it's a business that changes the ability, in our case, of millions of people, to create wealth and grow their businesses. That's a fundamental good,\" Lex says.\n\nTo him the trio's \"billionaire status is sort of irrelevant\".\n\n\"What motivates us is we love the businesses we do, in our finance business we enable tens and tens of thousands of battlers in Australia and more than 1.5 million battlers around the world to achieve their dreams by delivering them really cheap capital and in our farming business we really contribute to the local economy and produce great products for Australians.\"", "description": "Peter Greensill had little idea that a deal with older brother Lex seven years ago would turn him into one of the richest people in the country.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.6098%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1312%2C$x_316%2C$y_280/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/939401a8bddb258c872ccbef5b9fd3f7907e1d5a", "published_at": "2018-10-22"}
