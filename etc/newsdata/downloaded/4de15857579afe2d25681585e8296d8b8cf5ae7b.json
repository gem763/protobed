The hosts are just more dynamic in space, and that meant they could take advantage of the errors more effectively and take the chances when they opened. Five points to get the hosts underway, then, but not quite the romp to victory the prognosticators predicted. Russia pounced on an early error to open the scoring, and the errors never truly stopped coming in a pretty lacklustre contest that blustered and blathered and never really found top gear. Eventually, though, Japan's quality told, with a couple of magical touches capitalising on loose Russian defence and opening space for Kotaro Matsushima to score the Brave Blossoms's first World Cup hat-trick. Little to take from the game for either side, really, though Russia do appear to be more competitive than some thought they might be. But the World Cup is, officially, underway. Advertisement FULL TIME FULL TIME: Japan 30-10 Russia 81 minutes Little headway made as Russia begin their movement, and then a pass goes loose, and into the hands of a Japan player. That'll do us... 80 minutes Russia win a penalty and kick to the 22. 79 minutes Away time ticks with the game very much in an end-of-match holding pattern. Japan kick clear well twice, and Russia will have one final go at the Japanese defence. Advertisement 75 minutes More errors as we enter the game's throes. Japan's replacement back Ryohei Yamanaka nearly wriggles his way through a tackle but the tackler gets a claw to his shoelaces, and drags him down. Japan then knock on, of course. Take a drink. 72 minutes That's secured the bonus point for Japan, which is what they would have wanted from this opening fixture. It hasn't been quite the pummeling that most thought it would be, but job done, really, as far as the hosts are confirm. Russia nearly claim a high kick in a dangerous area but the second man there knocks on. Matchwinner Matsushima TRY! TRY! HAT-TRICK FOR KOTARO MATSUSHIMA! I'm not even going to try and describe the entire passage of play, with both teams having opportunities to score after making line breaks, but eventually a loose Russia kick in field hands Japan the ball with a three-man overlap, and it's that man again who provides the finishing touches. Kotaro Matsushima slips a tackle with a clever in to out body movement and sprints around to dive over for his third! Yu Tamura puts over the extra two. Japan 30-10 Russia Advertisement 67 minutes Another string of changes has only worsened the disorganised nature of the game. Plenty of kicks going up in there, and not many are being brought down effectively. Japan scrum near halfway. PENALTY! PENALTY! Perfect strike from Tamura. The lead opens to 13 again. Japan 23-10 Russia Yu Tamura will kick for goal from 45 metres or so, right of centre. 63 minutes Japan go to the box of tricks that has so far rather been left alone, a delicate outside-of-the-boot flip over the top of the Russian defensive line that very nearly finds red-and-white onrushing arms. The penalty was theirs, regardless. Advertisement SUBS A raft of changes as we reach the hour mark, including the introduction of New Zealand-born stalwart Luke Thompson, in his fourth World Cup in a Brave Blossoms jersey. PENALTY! PENALTY! Up go the flags. Japan 20-10 Russia 59 minutes Up goes the hoist as Russia lose momentum near halfway, and up goes Vasily Artemyev, too, and the Russian full-back is a fine aerial operator, winning the contest superbly to move Russia into the Japanese 22, where they win a penalty. Irish-schooled, Artemyev showed some gaelic football skills there, and Yury Kushnarev will kick for the posts.
