Yovanovitch, his former ambassador to Ukraine, were ominous. In a telephone conversation that has set off a political crisis for Mr. Trump, he told Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of Ukraine, that she was \u201cbad news.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s going to go through some things,\u201d he added.\n\nIn fact, she already has gone through quite a bit. Over the past several months, Ms. Yovanovitch, a decorated 33-year veteran of the State Department, has been vilified in the right-wing news media, denounced by the president\u2019s eldest son as a \u201cjoker,\u201d called a Democratic stooge by the president\u2019s personal lawyer and then abruptly recalled from Kiev this May, months ahead of schedule.\n\nHer supposed sin, never backed up by evidence, was that she had shown disloyalty to Mr. Trump, disparaging him behind his back. Her friends, who say her professionalism and history of diplomatic service make that highly unlikely, have another theory: She had turned into collateral damage in efforts by Mr. Trump and Rudolph W. Giuliani, his personal lawyer, to damage the reputation of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., perhaps Mr. Trump\u2019s most prominent Democratic rival in 2020.\n\nAmong the apparent strikes against her: A former Ukrainian prosecutor claimed in an interview with The New York Times that Ms. Yovanovitch had blocked his team from getting visas to the United States to deliver damaging information about Mr. Biden and his son Hunter to the F.B.I.", "description": "Marie Yovanovitch was forced out as ambassador after Trump allies called her disloyal.
