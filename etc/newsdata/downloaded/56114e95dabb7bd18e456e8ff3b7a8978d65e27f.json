You\u2019re seeing either silence from most the Republicans, or Republicans \u2014 obviously, Mitt Romney is at the front of it. I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s beyond comprehension, as David said \u2014we\u2019re early in this \u2014the Democrats is got to keep it tight. It is not beyond comprehension that they can get 20 senators. We all know in a private ballot the Republicans don\u2019t want him there. Nobody wants him there anymore. He\u2019s really not good for anybody. You and I both know, everybody at this table knows they can take a secret ballot, I guarantee you there would be about a 98-2 vote because the Republicans don\u2019t want him there. They just need air cover. As each day goes on, they get a little bit more air cover.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "description": "On Tuesday's broadcast of MSNBC's \"Deadline,\" network contributor Donny Deutsch said\u00a098 Republican senators would vote to remove President Donald Trump if the ballot was private. | Clips", "authors": ["Pam Key"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/07/Deutsch719-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
