(Khalil Ashawi/Reuters)\n\nPresident Trump announced during a Wednesday press conference that the U.S. would be lifting economic sanctions against Turkey, and declared the fragile five-day ceasefire between Turkish and Kurdish forces a success despite sporadic clashes.\n\n\u201cThe government of Turkey informed my administration that they would be stopping combat and their offensive in Syria, and making the ceasefire permanent,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou could also define the word permanent in that part of the world as somewhat questionable, we all understand that. But I do believe it will be permanent.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve therefore instructed the Secretary of the Treasury to lift all sanctions imposed\u201d on Turkey after its invasion of northeast Syria, Trump continued. He hinted the sanctions would be reinstated if \u201csomething happens that we\u2019re not happy with.\u201d\n\nRussian and Turkish forces had earlier come to an agreement on establishing a \u201csafe zone\u201d along the Turkish-Syrian border. Under the agreement, Turkish and Russian forces will remove Kurdish troops and weapons up to 30 kilometers from the border, while Turkey will patrol an area extending 10 kilometers into Syria.\n\nSyrian President Bashar Assad slammed the agreement and Turkey\u2019s incursion into the country\n\n\u201cErdogan is a thief and is now stealing our land,\u201d Assad told state media on a visit to Syria\u2019s northeast region. He further pledged to retake all the territory claimed by Turkey for its safe zone.\n\nHead of the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces General Mazloum Abdi thanked Trump via the SDF Spokesman\u2019s Twitter account.\n\n\u201cWe THANK President Trump for his tireless efforts that stopped the brutal Turkish attack and jihadist groups on our people,\u201d Mazloum\u2019s statement read.\n\nTrump has faced vociferous condemnation from lawmakers in response to his decision to remove American troops from the Syrian-Turkish border, paving the way for a Turkish invasion of the area. Congressmen and other officials have accused Trump of abandoning the Kurdish allies who fought alongside the U.S. against ISIS.", "description": "President Trump announced that the U.S. would be lifting economic sanctions against Turkey, and declared the fragile five-day ceasefire a success.", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "Tobias Hoonhout", "Kevin D.
