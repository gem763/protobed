We must look back on the past handlings and check if there was adequate management of those cases.\"The Agriculture Ministry also decided to extend the 48-hour standstill on transporting pigs.\"To strengthen quarantine efforts near the inter-Korean border areas, the ministry has decided to extend the movement ban on pigs previously issued for Incheon, Gyeonggi-do Province and Gangwon-do Province by another 48 hours, starting from 3:30 AM Friday.\"The ministry will cull all pigs within a 3-kilometer radius of the infected farms in Gimpo and Paju.For the pigs outside that radius, the government will buy the pigs off the farmers.The pigs will then be sent to slaughterhouses where they will be tested before the meat is sold.But in order to do this, farmers must register application forms for purchase to the respective cities in advance.Kim Jae-hee, Arirang News.", "description": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc744 \ub300\ud45c\ud558\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubc29\uc1a1!
