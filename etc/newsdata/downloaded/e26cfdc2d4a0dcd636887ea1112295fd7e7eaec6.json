I hope I am going to keep going like this in the final.\u201d\n\nMannarino is chasing his second ATP Tour title after winning the Libema Open in June at the age of 30 to become the oldest first-time champion on the men\u2019s circuit this year.\n\nThe unseeded Frenchman, now 31, faces his long-time practice partner De Minaur for the first time in Sunday\u2019s final.\n\nAfter impressive wins over Andy Murray and Borna Coric, De Minaur stunned second seed Roberto Bautista Agut 6-2 6-2.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve shown it today, I\u2019ve got this level, the level I brought today,\u201d 20-year-old seventh seed De Minaur said.\n\n\u201cIf I can try to bring this level almost every week, then I\u2019ll be going deep in tournaments and beating these top guys and pushing for titles.\u201d", "description": "France's Adrian Mannarino overcame a mid-match blip to beat Albert Ramos-Vinolas 6-0 4-6 6-1 at the Zhuhai Championships on Saturday, advancing to his second tour-level final.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
