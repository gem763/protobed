What had begun on Friday, with tremors inside U.S. short-term funding markets, was escalating rapidly.\n\nAt a small broker-dealer in New Jersey, Scott Skrym could sense the money draining away.\n\n\u201cThis is crazy!\u201d Skrym exclaimed. A key interest rate -- one the entire marketplace was now fixated on -- was shooting to as high as 10%. That was four times its level a week ago.\n\nNot since the 2008 financial crisis has a spike in money-market rates caused such a stir -- or prompted such a response.\n\nFrom New York to Chicago to Los Angeles, major banks, corporations and investment firms struggled to get answers about what is usually a simple question: Where is the overnight repurchase rate, the grease that keeps the vast global financial system spinning? Rumors flew. Wall Street dealers scurried to protect their clients -- and themselves.\n\nInside the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the powerful markets group had already been canvassing dealers about lending rates. By 10:10 a.m., after an initial, embarrassing misstep, the Fed was pumping $53.2 billion into the market to calm nerves and regain control over interest rates -- its first intervention since the dark days of Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers and the rest.\n\nThe whirlwind day left traders with a host of questions, including the big one: Now what? Shortly after 4 p.m., the Fed announced it would intervene with another repurchase operation on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cToday was a bit of a watershed event,\u201d said John Fath, managing partner at BTG Pactual Asset Management.\n\nPlumbing Problem\n\nOvernight financing is a basic function, but it\u2019s so sensitive that many Wall Street dealers and corporate treasurers decline to talk openly about it. Privately, market participants likened the events of the past few days to to a plumbing problem -- the result of forces that, for most people, are largely hidden from view.\n\nUnlike in 2008, Tuesday\u2019s abrupt rise in short-term rates wasn\u2019t evidence that the financial system was in trouble. Rather, it was the result of a confluence of forces, including corporate tax payments and big Treasury auctions and, ultimately, the swelling U.S. budget deficit.\n\nMark Cabana, head of U.S. interest rate strategy at Bank of America, saw it coming. He warned in a Sept. 13 note that the so-called dollar funding markets were about to be tested.\n\nCorporations had to withdraw cash from money market funds and bank accounts to make quarterly tax payments, while Treasury buyers had to settle up with Uncle Sam for recent purchases. On Friday alone, about $20.4 billion flowed out of money-market funds, according to Peter Crane, president of Crane Data LLC.\n\nSuch technicalities aside, the developments nonetheless showed the Fed was losing control over short-term lending, one of its tools for implementing the monetary policy that helps guide the entire economy.\n\nThe market was so topsy-turvy that the effective fed funds rate rose, even as economists predict the central bank will reduce the benchmark at its policy-making meeting on Wednesday.\n\nThe tumult also points to another worrisome sign: Wall Street is struggling to absorb record sales of Treasury bonds and bills that the Trump administration is using to fund a growing budget deficit. What\u2019s more, many dealers have curtailed trading because of reforms implemented after 2008, making markets more prone to volatility.\n\nGrowing Pressure\n\nTuesday\u2019s intervention marked the culmination of days of growing strains. Everyone knew pressure was building, said the head of rates financing at one major bank. But few expected a spike like this.\n\nBy early Tuesday morning, dealers were whispering that the overnight repo rate would open at about 6%, well above the 3.5% where it had closed the night before.\n\nAs usual, Robert Sabatino, global head of liquidity at UBS Asset Management, was making daily calls to check that counterparties were executing transactions at the prevailing market rate. Some of them were quoting 3%. Sabatino knew the clearing rate was much higher -- between 5% and 6%.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s normal price discovery, but now complicated when the market is in flux,\u201d he said.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The word went out even before the opening bell: the Fed had to step in.Up and down Wall Street, phones lit up Tuesday morning as a crucial market for billions in overnight borrowing suddenly started to dry up.
