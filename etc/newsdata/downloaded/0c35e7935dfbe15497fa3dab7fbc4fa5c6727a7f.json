Sign up here to get it nightly.\n\nThe standoff between Bong Joon-ho and Harvey Weinstein over the U.S. cut of Snowpiercer had all the hallmarks of a scene the director might shoot himself. High drama. The Korean auteur versus the bullish American. Philosophical questions of artistic integrity in the time of mass consumption. Gallows humor.\n\nSnowpiercer is a unique hybrid. It looks like a slick Hollywood action movie with revolutionary themes, depicting a class rebellion set in a sci-fi dystopia led by none other than Captain America himself, Chris Evans. But despite its blockbuster appeal, Snowpiercer languished in limbo in the U.S. The Weinstein Company bought the distribution rights in 2012, but instead of giving the film an immediate release date, Weinstein demanded changes. He wanted to cut 25 minutes. He wanted more action, \u201cmore Chris Evans.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a doomed encounter,\u201d Bong tells me over breakfast one morning in Los Angeles. \u201cI\u2019m someone who until that point had only ever released the \u2018director\u2019s cut\u2019 of my films. I\u2019ve never done an edit I didn\u2019t want to do.\u201d And yet, he says, \u201cWeinstein\u2019s nickname is \u2018Harvey Scissorhands,\u2019 and he took such pride in his edit of the film. I am so proud of my edit!\u201d Bong is a commanding presence, six feet tall and honey-bear shaped. He\u2019s a mesmeric storyteller with killer comic timing, and he does a bombastic Weinstein impression \u2014 all hot air and hand gestures \u2014 punctuated by his wild, authorial hair.\n\nBong remembers one fateful meeting in Tribeca when he and Weinstein watched the movie together. \u201cWow, you are a genius,\u201d he would say. \u201cLet\u2019s cut out the dialogue.\u201d\n\nBong was at a loss: Cutting 25 minutes felt like taking out a major organ. Without the dialogue, the movie became incoherent; character motivation made no sense. That day, he managed to save one scene, the moment when a train guard guts a fish in front of the rebels as a show of intimidation. Bong and his cinematographer loved that shot. \u201cHarvey hated it. Why fish? We need action!\u201d Bong remembers. \u201cI had a headache in that moment: What do I do? So suddenly, I said, \u2018Harvey, this shot means something to me.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Bong? What?\u201d Bong-as-Harvey booms.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something personal,\u201d Bong replies. \u201cMy father was a fisherman. I\u2019m dedicating this shot to my father.\u201d\n\nWeinstein relents immediately: \u201cYou should have said something earlier, Bong! Family is the most important. You have the shot.\u201d\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Thank you,\u2019\u201d Bong says, laughing. \u201cIt was a fucking lie. My father was not a fisherman.\u201d\n\nStill, the disagreement dragged on for months. Weinstein showed his edit to a test audience of about 250 in Paramus, New Jersey, at a giant multiplex that reminded Bong of Kevin Smith\u2019s Mallrats. Bong thought for sure the reaction scores would vindicate him. And indeed, with so much of the dialogue excised, viewers felt lost and gave the film low marks. \u201cOn the inside, I was happy that the scores were bad,\u201d he says. \u201cBut Weinstein comes out and goes, \u2018Bong! Yeah, the score is very bad. Let\u2019s cut out more.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole thing was like a black comedy,\u201d he continues. \u201cIf this was someone else\u2019s movie and you were making a documentary of the situation, it would be really funny. Unfortunately, it was my movie.\u201d\n\nIf it had come down to it, and Weinstein\u2019s cut been released, Bong says he would have taken his name off the movie. But eventually the director prevailed. The distribution contract allowed him to show the original version to another test audience in Pasadena, California, where it played to much higher scores. Meanwhile, news of the conflict had leaked to the press, rallying cinephiles and the film\u2019s stars, including John Hurt and Tilda Swinton, who wanted to see Bong\u2019s version preserved. Weinstein backed down with a compromise: He kicked the movie down to the company\u2019s independent arm, Radius. Instead of a wide release, it got a limited one. \u201cMaybe for [Weinstein], it was some kind of punishment to a filmmaker who doesn\u2019t do what he wants,\u201d says Bong. \u201cBut for me, we were all very happy. Yeah! Director\u2019s cut!\u201d\n\nTo a viewer familiar with Bong\u2019s work, the metatext in the conflict is unmistakable. His films often center on underdogs fighting against authoritarian forces. In his 2006 breakout movie, The Host, a bickering Korean family finds itself battling a giant river monster born of American malfeasance: A U.S. military official orders a Korean lackey to pour hundreds of bottles of formaldehyde directly down the drain (an actual incident that occurred in Seoul in 2000), thereby creating a beast that terrorizes the city of Seoul (that part didn\u2019t happen). The movie is an obvious metaphor for the global superpower that has often bullied and eaten up smaller countries like Korea.\n\nIn Okja, Bong\u2019s follow-up to Snowpiercer, the protagonist is a young Korean girl from the countryside trying to save her pet super-pig from the grip of a multi\u00adnational corporation. Bong slipped in an inside joke about the whole Weinstein ordeal, setting the final slaughterhouse scene in Paramus. After all, he felt a little like Okja, the titular pig, going from Korea to New York only to get dragged all the way to Paramus in order to get sliced and diced for mass consumption. But as the story would have it, both the pig and the movie survived intact.\n\nPhoto: Robert Maxwell\n\nBong and I are heading west in a car toward his hotel in Beverly Hills. He\u2019s in the middle of the North American festival circuit, where he\u2019s been showing his new film, Parasite; he just arrived from Telluride the night before, and he\u2019ll be heading off to Toronto in a few days. He has a \u201ctastemaker screening\u201d later tonight. \u201cIt\u2019s the same in any country: Korea, Japan,\u201d Bong says in Korean. \u201cYou know, doing preview screenings for movie people.\u201d\n\nOf course, we are dancing around his journey into the carnival that is an Academy Awards campaign, which seems to mildly amuse him from a distance. I ask what he thinks of the fact that no Korean film has ever been nominated for an Oscar despite the country\u2019s outsize influence on cinema in the past two decades. \u201cIt\u2019s a little strange, but it\u2019s not a big deal,\u201d he says, shrugging. \u201cThe Oscars are not an international film festival. They\u2019re very local.\u201d\n\nStill, it\u2019s hard not to feel that Bong could make (local) history. In a post-Roma world, maybe Parasite doesn\u2019t get just Best International Film but Best Picture and Best Director nominations, too. Bong has already had a brilliant year: At the Cannes Film Festival this spring, he became the first Korean director to win the Palme d\u2019Or, in a unanimous jury decision. The Korean press was rapturous upon his return. \u201cNormally, people don\u2019t care about film festivals. But I guess people really seem to focus on first place,\u201d he says. He and Parasite star Song Kang-ho were greeted at Incheon airport as if they were the K-Pop group BTS. \u201cIt was an Olympic-gold-medal kind of feeling,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was very awkward in the airport. Super awkward.\u201d\n\nThe director has been a household name in South Korea ever since The Host, which became an instant blockbuster and the highest-grossing movie in the country\u2019s history at the time. Snowpiercer broadened his scope, allowing him to think more globally. Then came Okja \u2014 at a cost of $57 million, Bong\u2019s biggest-budget film to date \u2014 which he made with Netflix because it gave him complete creative control. After the experience with Weinstein, he wanted to ensure that every contract stipulated he have final-cut approval. Netflix didn\u2019t balk at any of his demands. \u201cOther studios were like, \u2018Are you really going to film a little kid going inside of a slaughterhouse?\u2019 \u201d Bong says. \u201cOnly Netflix guaranteed 100 percent approval of everything to me: the final cut and the rating.\u201d\n\nThe Bong Joon-ho Essentials, clockwise from top left: Memories of Murder (2003), The Host (2006), Snowpiercer (2013), and Mother (2009).

At the outset, it\u2019s a black comedy about class differences well suited to our season of scams. It follows the Kim family, who live in a half-basement apartment where the only sunlight trickles in from a narrow window near the ceiling. They catch a break when the eldest son, Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik), is hired as an English tutor for the teenage daughter of the fabulously wealthy Park family. Ki-woo rebrands himself as \u201cKevin\u201d and helps the rest of his family infiltrate the house. Everyone pretends to be someone they\u2019re not: The sister (Park So-dam) becomes an \u201cart therapist\u201d for the youngest son, the father (played by Song) becomes the driver, and the mother (Jang Hye-jin) is hired as the housekeeper. The way Parasite\u2019s story unfolds from there is like a magic trick. It alternately entertains and devastates, like a candy bar with a razor blade tucked inside.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just such a masterful storyteller, and on top of that, he knows how to have fun,\u201d says the actor Steven Yeun, who worked with Bong on Okja. \u201cHe turns it up slightly Technicolor.\u201d His films are rooted in genre conventions like action and horror that eventually give way to crushing realism. Memories of Murder is a scathing black comedy about police incompetence, The Host is an indictment of American hubris disguised as a monster movie, and Okja is a Totoro-esque escape story until the gears of factory farming begin to turn. In Parasite, the scam ultimately reveals something more insidious: that wealth is always built upon poverty and that the two are locked in a constant struggle. The poor wish to be rich, and in order for someone to be rich, someone else must be poor.\n\nBong\u2019s work reflects anxieties he feels every day \u2014 about the climate crisis, the widening income gap. \u201cMy films generally seem to have three components: fear, anxiety, and a kekeke sense of humor,\u201d he says, using the Korean equivalent of \u201cha-ha.\u201d \u201cHumor comes from anxiety, too,\u201d he adds. \u201cAt least when we laugh, there\u2019s a feeling that we\u2019re overcoming some kind of horror.\u201d In his view, our world is already a dystopia, and all tragedy and comedy flows from this fact.\n\nParasite, in particular, hits a nerve, tapping into the persistent feeling that we are on the brink of social collapse. \u201cThe true horror and fear of Parasite isn\u2019t just about how the present-day situation is bad but that it will only continue to get worse,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s my own fear in my life. I\u2019m 50 now, so I\u2019m going to die in about 30 years. My son is 23 now. When he reaches middle age, after I die, will it get better? I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not so hopeful. Still, we have to try to live happily. We can\u2019t cry every day.\u201d (He\u2019s surprisingly sanguine about all of this.)\n\nMore Essentials: Okja (2017) and Parasite (2019).

The trials and exigencies of modern Korean history \u2014 Japanese colonialism, the Korean War, military dictatorship \u2014 have given an entire generation of filmmakers like Lee Chang-dong (Burning), Park Chan-wook (Oldboy), and Bong a sense of breathtaking urgency. Korean filmmaking feels prescient today because of its own, recent entanglements with authoritarianism and poverty. It is less that Korean films have caught up with modern times than that modern times have caught up with Korean cinema.\n\n\u201cOkja, Snowpiercer, Parasite, they\u2019re all stories about capitalism,\u201d Bong says. \u201cBefore it\u2019s a massive, sociological term, capitalism is just our lives.\u201d\n\nBong was born in 1969, the youngest of four, in the southeastern city of Daegu, when South Korea was under the rule of a military dictatorship. His family\u2019s house was near a U.S. military base, and some of his earliest memories are of watching American soldiers passing overhead in low-flying helicopters while the kids yelled what English they knew at them: \u201cTom! James! Hello, gum joo-so!\u201d meaning \u201cGive us some gum!\u201d \u201cThe kids would shout any kind of name, and the American soldiers would wave their hands back,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to invoke the Korean War image of crying children, but those kids existed. The country was quite poor.\u201d\n\nBong\u2019s father was a graphic and industrial designer and professor. His mother worked as a housewife; her father had been an esteemed novelist during the Japanese colonial period. Bong never met him, though. The family was separated after the Korean War, and his maternal grandfather lived out the rest of his life above the 38th parallel in Pyongyang, North Korea. His mother\u2019s sister lived up there, too. The siblings didn\u2019t see each other again for 56 years, until they were reunited during one of the televised events in 2006 that brought together divided families. \u201cFifty-six years,\u201d he says. \u201cTotally fucking crazy.\u201d\n\nHe gazes out the car window, recalling his first visit to L.A. more than a decade ago while on a press tour for The Host. \u201cAt the time, I felt the city looked very strange,\u201d he says dreamily. It was so flat and wide, without the verticality and density that define cities like Seoul. \u201cEverything is very \u2026 scattered,\u201d he says in English. He speaks with unusual precision, as non-native speakers often do. \u201cI cannot imagine what is the borderline of the city. I always want to know the borderline \u2014 it\u2019s my personal problem.\u201d\n\nAt least when we laugh, there\u2019s a feeling that we\u2019re overcoming some kind of horror.\n\nBong went to college to study sociology at Yonsei University in Seoul\u2019s Sinchon neighborhood in 1988, which was a time of political upheaval. \u201cEvery week, there was a demonstration in the university,\u201d he says. Just the year before, South Korea had hit a tipping point in its ongoing fight for democracy. News broke that the police had tortured a student to death, galvanizing nationwide mass protests that forced democratic elections. College campuses were regular battlegrounds where students demonstrated for the expansion of democratic rights, labor unions, and reunification with North Korea. By the time Bong graduated from college in 1995, South Korea was experiencing its first spasms of democracy.\n\n\u201cWe hated going to class,\u201d he recalls. \u201cEvery day was the same: protest during the day, drink at night. Except for a few people, we didn\u2019t have much faith in the professors at the time. So we formed study groups of our own covering politics, aesthetics, history. We\u2019d drink until late at night, talking and debating.\u201d He adds, \u201cI\u2019m not the kind of person who likes to be stuck in a group, so even while we were protesting, I would leave and go watch a movie. The lead organizers probably thought I was a bad activist.\u201d\n\nDuring demonstrations, the protesters threw rocks; the riot police threw rocks back and shot tear-gas canisters from cannons. Bong, along with everyone in his generation, made \u201chumanitarian\u201d Molotov cocktails from a mixture of paint thinner and water \u2014 they were visually explosive but less dangerous than those made with gasoline. \u201cThe other side were young kids like us who got conscripted into the military and sent out here, so we didn\u2019t actually want to injure them,\u201d he says. \u201cStill, both sides were incredibly violent. It was a really dangerous time.\u201d\n\nClouds of tear gas were a near-daily presence during Bong\u2019s first two years on campus. \u201cIt was a very traumatic smell. It\u2019s impossible to describe: nauseating, stinging, hot,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s strange, sometimes I smell it in my dreams. Usually dreams are images, but I sometimes have this sensation of smelling it. It\u2019s really horrible, but I guess that\u2019s the way it would be.\u201d\n\nIn The Host, there is a machine that pours out a tear-gas-like substance called Agent Yellow to disperse protesters. The protagonists fight back with debris and Molotov cocktails in a scene clearly plucked from the director\u2019s activist days. But while his films often have a radical impulse, they\u2019re not didactic. \u201cSong Kang-ho\u2019s character in The Host has no direct relationship with America,\u201d Bong explains. \u201cHe\u2019s just a kind of dumb guy who runs a kiosk on the Han River.\u201d His characters are typically uninterested in politics but get swept up in machinery much larger than them: global capitalism, governmental infrastructure, authoritarian forces.\n\nWe pull up to the Four Seasons, where a fleet of bellhops swarms the car to open the door for us. Just through the hotel entrance, a saleswoman is standing outside a small, glass-walled parfumerie. She hands Bong a sample of Krigler\u2019s Sierra Vista cologne, which she describes as a \u201csexy scent\u201d of cedarwood and jasmine. He takes a sniff. \u201cIt\u2019s better than tear gas,\u201d he says, laughing.\n\nIn 1992, Bong returned from two years of mandatory military service for his junior year of college. South Korea was in the throes of transformation. Censorship laws had relaxed, and unofficial French-style cinematheques were cropping up. The pop group Seo Taiji and Boys debuted, writing lyrics that were increasingly critical of conservative aspects of Korean culture. Film magazines sprang up, and a critic culture rose with them. \u201cThere was a weird explosion of pop culture,\u201d Bong remembers.\n\nBack on campus, he co-founded a cinema club called Yellow Door (\u201cVery stupid name. The door for the group was yellow\u201d) with students from neighboring schools like Hongik University, Ewha Womans University, and Sogang University. \u201cWe watched movies every day, analyzed them, wrote treatments,\u201d he recalls. That\u2019s when he made his first films, including a stop-motion short, Looking for Paradise, about a gorilla trying to escape imprisonment, and a 16-mm. short called White Man (Baeksaekin). I tell him I\u2019ve had difficulty tracking down the latter. \u201cPlease don\u2019t see it,\u201d he pleads, after disclosing it\u2019s an Easter egg on the Korean DVD release of Memories of Murder. \u201cIt\u2019s a super-stupid, fucking boring film. It\u2019s just terrible.\u201d\n\nPark Chan-wook, whose company, Moho Film, produced Snowpiercer, doesn\u2019t remember it that way. It was the early \u201990s, and he was working on an independent film, when a crew member called him and said, \u201cI have finally found a short film that will satisfy your odd taste in movies.\u201d Park watched White Man and says he \u201cwas instantly mesmerized by the film\u2019s grotesque sense of humor.\u201d\n\nBut not until Bong\u2019s second feature, Memories of Murder, did his visual style begin to gel. In another life, he would have been a comic-book artist. Bong meticulously storyboards everything he shoots, and his movies look like individual frames come to life. He sketched out every scene for Parasite and Memories of Murder himself \u2014 complete with dialogue \u2014 and for films with bigger visual effects, like Okja and Snowpiercer, he worked with an artist. \u201cHe gave us storyboards that were fully bound books,\u201d says Yeun of his experience acting in Okja. \u201cThey look like mangas, where you\u2019re just like, Oh, this is the movie.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n/ 3\n\nYeun describes the director as a \u201chuman animator.\u201d He recalls how, on set, Bong would show him a shot with stand-ins so he could picture the composition before stepping into the frame himself. \u201cSome people get jarred by that because they don\u2019t like being told where to stand. But when you see the frame, you\u2019re like, I know what we\u2019re achieving here,\u201d Yeun says. \u201cYou feel like a color.\u201d\n\nTilda Swinton, who plays the colorful villain in both Okja and Snowpiercer, felt similarly. \u201cNot having any particular process myself, I find this method peculiarly liberating. It frees us all to fill the frame, albeit within precise boundaries, with energy and a kind of quick-bursting freshness,\u201d she writes in an email, emphasizing that this method still gives actors plenty of agency. \u201cDirector Bong is perpetually up for being entertained. It is a great feeling to amuse him.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt makes me less anxious,\u201d Bong says of his process. \u201cWithout a storyboard on set in the morning, it\u2019s like those nightmares where you\u2019re in the middle of Manhattan just wearing your underwear. If you have a storyboard, it feels like you\u2019re walking outside in clean, comfortable clothes.\u201d\n\nPerhaps most unconventionally, he doesn\u2019t shoot coverage \u2014 that is, multiple shots from various angles and perspectives that get edited together later. Instead, he shoots exactly what he imagines, editing on set as he goes. \u201cThat process allows him to fully control what the cut is going to be, and the result ends up being very original,\u201d says Kevin Thompson, the production designer for Okja. \u201cHe\u2019s not getting more than he needs.\u201d Bong finds it more efficient because everything about a shot has already been decided, so the cast and crew don\u2019t have to repeat the same thing over and over from different perspectives. They can harness all their energies and focus on the task at hand.\n\nBong\u2019s films often take years to plan (he first thought of the idea for Parasite in 2013) and require a complex wizardry of digital and practical effects. The luxe modernist house owned by the Parks in Parasite looks deceptively simple in its elegance, but it\u2019s one of Bong\u2019s most intricate creations yet. \u201cOn a fundamental level, if the structure of the house isn\u2019t correct, the story doesn\u2019t work,\u201d he says. It was a technical puzzle: The first floor and private front yard were built on an empty outdoor lot in Jeonju, with a green screen placed on top where the second floor would eventually be digitally inserted. The other rooms of the house were built on separate soundstages. \u201cThere are nearly 480 visual-effects shots, but we can never feel it in the movie,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re invisible.\u201d\n\nWe first experience the Park house as the Kims do, luxuriating in the clean, sleek lines and modern furnishings. It\u2019s open, airy, and transparent, a private oasis away from the cramped and dingy space they live in. Eventually, the house opens up like an elaborate jewel box, with plot elements that hinge on the architecture: hiding, eavesdropping, scheming. More than a house, it becomes a map of class psychology and the resentment that simmers beneath the surface.\n\nBong Joon-ho is in his element poking around the Hollyhock House on Hollywood Boulevard, which was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright a century ago. We visit the historic building on his last day in L.A. He\u2019s wanted to come here since the late actor Scott Wilson pointed it out to him on a drive. Bong wanders the space, politely pushing boundaries: He tests locked doors and pokes his head down into a basement that has been roped off from visitors. He wonders what the second floor is like. At this moment, he\u2019s asking one of the docents if we can shut the house\u2019s front doors \u2014 two massive concrete slabs weighing half a ton with hidden locks. The docent grimaces and agrees to shut one.\n\n\u201cWow, it feels like the extension of a wall,\u201d Bong says, marveling at the closed door. \u201cSuddenly, it reminds me of the dialogue of Song Kang-ho in Snowpiercer, do you remember? Song Kang-ho said everybody thinks this is a wall, but actually this is a door, and then they explode it and go out. If we erase the borderline between the door and the wall \u2026\u201d\n\nBong on the set of Parasite. Photo: Courtesy of the studio\n\nWe quietly pad through the house until we reach a room in the corner \u2014 a small, sunny conservatory free of any furnishings. He takes a seat in the middle of the floor with a delighted smile. \u201cShould we lie down?\u201d Bong asks. He laughs and gets up, moving toward the library, which is stocked with children\u2019s books. He points at the bookcase flanking the right side and giggles. \u201cPush and open it. There\u2019s a door behind it.\u201d\n\nAs dark as Bong\u2019s films get, they never lose their sense of play. At times, the jokes are mischievous references the viewer might not catch, like setting the slaughterhouse in Paramus, or elaborate visual gags. In Okja, for instance, a group of top executives huddle in a situation room to discuss how to deal with the super-pig; the shot is a meticulous re-creation of the famous Obama-era photo in which the president, Hillary Clinton, and other officials are gathered to witness the assassination of Osama bin Laden. \u201cThey\u2019re all watching this pig cause a commotion with these really serious expressions,\u201d he says, tickled.\n\nOther times, it\u2019s a love of hyperbole \u2014 like the family wailing over a death in The Host or Jake Gyllenhaal\u2019s insanely over-the-top performance in Okja. Bong likes to have at least one toe across the line at all times. \u201cSometimes he would challenge me,\u201d says Kelly Masterson, who co-wrote the script for Snowpiercer. \u201cHe\u2019d be like, \u2018This should be funny. I don\u2019t know what, but it should be funny.\u2019 \u201d He recalls writing a line for a scene in which the wizened rebel leader, Gilliam (Hurt), advises Curtis (Evans) to \u201ccut out his tongue before he can talk to you\u201d when he meets the train\u2019s creator, Wilford (Ed Harris). Bong suggested they amend the line to \u201cCut out his tongue and eat it.\u201d \u201cWhich is sort of cannibalism,\u201d says Masterson, laughing. \u201cI was just so horrified by that. But he thought it was funny. He would say something like that, and then he would giggle.\u201d\n\nFor now, Bong doesn\u2019t plan on doing another big-budget film like Snowpiercer or Okja. (He\u2019s currently at work on a \u201cslightly scary\u201d Korean film inspired by a news event and an English-language production.) He prefers the size of a movie like Parasite because it allows him to achieve the specificity of his vision.\n\n\u201cYou know how when you were little, you would use a magnifying glass to gather the sunlight into one point and burn a piece of paper?\u201d he explains by way of metaphor. \u201cParasite was like taking a camera lens and gathering all of my concentration and focusing it in on one spot. When the scale is really grand, a bigger budget feels like a handicap. Your energy gets scattered.\u201d\n\nHe adds, \u201cAnd isn\u2019t the smell of burning paper really nice?\u201d\n\nWe stand in the loggia, a transitional space between the living room and the garden, looking out into the enclosed courtyard. The brightly lit grass vividly calls to mind one of the final shots from Parasite: the green, sun-drenched front lawn, glimmering with the promise of the freedom money can provide. The hope in Bong\u2019s movies often springs from this longing: to find a little patch of sunlight to call your own, if only for a moment. The optimism almost makes it crueler.\n\nWe head toward the dining room of the house, which is furnished with a hexagonal wooden table and a fabric light fixture above.\n\n\u201cIf there were a fire, this would burn really easily,\u201d Bong says with a smile. \u201cOf course, one hopes something like that doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\n*A version of this article appears in the September 30, 2019, issue of New York Magazine.
