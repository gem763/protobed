Everything else is hypothetical as we don't know the situation we will be in as a team or I will be in as a manager.'\n\nThere have been multiple cases of racist abuse from fans in 2019, as players look for an end\n\nEngland's football players have been wearing Black History Month shirts in training sessions\n\nSouthgate added: 'The most important thing for me is that all of the players and all of the staff know they are supported.\n\n'Inevitably because we suffered a situation in Montenegro we wanted to be clear what might happen if something happened in the future. We are very clear on that.\n\n'We want the players to be able to concentrate on football, they want to be judged on football.\n\n'What I've got to do is provide a secure, safe environment for them to play.'\n\nSouthgate was asked if Chelsea striker Tammy Abraham saying he would want to walk off if England players suffered racist chanting during a game was in conflict with his version of the team's position.\n\nPart of the stadium for their match against Bulgaria will be closed due to racism from fans\n\nThe manager said: 'We will experience a huge number of questions and anybody that gets one slight nuance adrift of the general feeling and what was discussed as a group is going to be flagged as a possible disagreement.\n\n'That's absolutely not the case, everybody is very clear. My players are being put in very difficult situations every time they are questioned on the subject and you feel one word out of place, one incorrect phrasing, leads to possible problems that could be flagged towards another team, made to make a story towards another team or potentially made to look as if there is a split or disagreement within our camp.\n\n'We're 100 per cent united on how we see things. The players, at the same time, have the right to have a voice. They should speak their mind, openly, and I encourage them to do that because we have the chance to make a difference on a very important topic as well.'\n\nThere was confusion after Tammy Abraham said England will walk off the pitch if abused\n\nManchester City striker Raheem Sterling, who has spoken out against racism after suffering abuse during the 5-1 win away to Montenegro in March, backed his manager's call to let UEFA take action.\n\nSterling said: 'As a player, with the situation that happened in Montenegro, I don't think as a team we were quite prepared and knowing there was a protocol in place.\n\n'As a team, we had a meeting and Gareth sat us down and explained there was a UEFA protocol. Now as players we have got to kind of give UEFA a chance to take that responsibility on board and deal with that situation.\n\n'At this moment in time, full faith in UEFA.'", "description": "England manager Gareth Southgate has stressed his players will follow UEFA protocols if they experience racist chanting during forthcoming European Championship qualifiers.", "authors": ["Press Association Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/19/19498614-0-image-a-8_1570733406460.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
