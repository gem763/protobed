We booked for a five-star resort.\"\n\n(Image: BPM Media)\n\nThe family were moved to the Elegance Hotel, which they claim was a disastrous experience.\n\n\"This Elegance Hotel was not even a two star in my opinion, along with many holidaymakers that were in the same position as us,\" Mrs Hussain said.\n\nThe mum says she was horrified by the state of the hotel and said her daughter came home with an eye infection from the 'filthy' pool - which was bright green.\n\nClaims of exposed wires, brown running water from taps, a smelly apartment and centipedes crawling on the bedroom floor were among complaints outlined by the family to Teletext Holidays.\n\n(Image: BPM Media)\n\nCurtains hanging off the rails, a mattress marked with dirt and ripped wallpaper can also be seen in photos taken by the family.\n\nThey also said there was no entertainment as promised, difficulties getting hold of the reps and a fire exit blocked off by a trolley.\n\nMrs Hussain said: \"We booked all-inclusive so we wouldn't have to worry about going out to eat, but the food was inedible.\n\n\"Drinks were only fizzy so nothing for a young child.\n\n\"The pool was dirty, green and had loose wiring and caused my daughter to catch an eye infection. It was because they didn't clean it. I think the cleaning filter was off/ not working.\n\n(Image: BPM Media)\n\n\"They had two pools - and the second one was closed because a girl cut her foot on a cracked tile.\n\n\"They offered to change our hotel when we called to complain, but we just wanted to come back to the UK. We were lied to and given false promises.\n\n\"This was meant to be a holiday but I\u2019ve been so stressed in Turkey and now that we are back the stress continues.\"\n\nMrs Hussain claims she has yet to receive compensation or a refund.\n\n(Image: BPM Media)\n\nTeletext Holidays says it is investigating the complaints and apologised for the distressed caused to the family.\n\nA spokesperson said: \"Teletext Holidays prides itself on its high level of customer satisfaction, and are committed to putting clients first and making sure their needs are met.\n\n\"As such we were disappointed to hear that our client didn\u2019t enjoy her holiday.\n\n\"We do offer a fair and reasonable complaints policy, and the complaint which Miss Husain sent to our customer relations team today has been acknowledged and is now being thoroughly investigated.\n\n\"We extend our apologies for any inconvenience and distress caused.\"", "description": "Rubeka Hussain, 35, booked an all-inclusive trip to Didum Beach Resort, costing \u00a31,650, through Teletext Holidays after losing their original flights with Thomas Cook in September", "authors": ["Stephanie Balloo", "Image", "Bpm Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20737057.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/7_Green-pool-hell-hotel_1111.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
