(AP Photo/Armando Solis)\n\nMEXICO CITY (AP) \u2014 State and local officials in western Mexico disputed Monday whether the old vigilante \"self-defense\" movement has re-awakened, or whether recent confrontations are just turf battles between gangs.\n\nThe 2013-2014 vigilante movement took control of large swaths of western Michoacan state, purportedly to expel the old Knights Templar drug cartel. The \"self-defense\" groups were largely disarmed after the government sent in thousands of police and troops; officials argued many vigilante groups had been infiltrated by rival gangs.\n\nOver the weekend, vigilantes in the town of Tepalcatepec said they had fought off a massive attack by the Jalisco New Generation Cartel and posted videos showing hundreds of purported vigilante fighters and shot-up pickup trucks surrounded by bodies.\n\nMichoacan state prosecutors say only one body was officially found following the confrontation, but a total of about a dozen people had been wounded.\n\nState officials say the videos showing numerous dead could have been taken at other times and places.\n\nBut town officials in Tepalcatepec were so shaken they announced Monday they were cancelling classes and Sept. 15-16 independence day celebrations.\n\nMayor Felipe Martinez said in a statement that \"we fear more kinds of attacks.\"\n\nBut on Monday, Michoacan Gov. Silvano Aureoles denied there was any resurgence of the vigilante movement, saying the confrontations had been magnified and were turf battles between drug gangs.\n\nAureoles said the vigilantes in Tepalcatepec \u2014 the home town of vigilante leader Jos\u00e9 Mireles \u2014 were simply fighting over turf and drug routes with the Jalisco cartel, which he referred to as the \"four letters,\" a reference to the group's Spanish initials: CJNG.\n\n\"These are rivalries and quarrels between them, and not for charitable purposes,\" Aureoles said. \"This is obviously a struggle over territory and shipment routes.\"\n\nAureoles has criticized federal officials for not cracking down hard enough on drug cartels, and for holding talks with some vigilante groups, who he describes as nothing more than criminals.\n\nMichoacan was where Mexico's 2006-2012 drug war began. Vigilante movements, meanwhile, become a lingering problem in many parts of neighboring Guerrero state.\n\nWhile violence declined in Mexico between 2013 and 2015, it has since surged to higher levels than at the height of the drug war. A massive return of vigilantes might suggest Mexico is returning to the darkest days of the drug war.\n\nIn Morelos state, closer to Mexico City, prosecutors said Monday that gunmen killed five men at a bus station in the state capital of Cuernavaca.\n\nThe Morelos state prosecutors office said a sixth man was wounded in the attack. It said the victims were specifically targeted around 4:40 a.m., but did not offer any possible motive.\n\nMultiple organized crime groups maintain a presence in the city 35 miles (55 kilometers) south of Mexico City.\n\nIn May, a union official accompanying protesting street vendors was shot to death outside city hall along with another trade unionist.\n\nAnd in the northern state of Sinaloa, marines said Monday they had raided four clandestine drug labs and seized about 1,015 gallons (3,840 liters) of liquid methamphetamines.", "description": "State and local officials in western Mexico disputed Monday whether the old vigilante \"self-defense\" movement has re-awakened, or whether recent confrontations are just turf battles between gangs.
