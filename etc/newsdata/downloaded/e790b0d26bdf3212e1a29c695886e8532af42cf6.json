Swallowing venomous animals for a laugh is very much a bloke\u2019s thing.A team led by archaeologist Elanor Sonderman from Texas A&M University re-examined a collection of coprolites \u2013 partly-fossilized turds \u2013 that had been collected from Conejo Shelter site in the Lower Pecos Canyonlands of southwest Texas.One of the samples stood out because it contained not only an entire rodent that had been swallowed without cooking or even skinning, but also a complete rattlesnake including its fangs.The sample dates from approximately 1,500 years ago.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\n(Image: E.

They were an ancient Native American culture that lived in parts of what is now Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, and Colorado.They thrived in Southwestern America for about 4 or 5 thousand years before being gradually supplanted by Navajo tribes.\n\n(Image: E. M. Sonderman et al.)\n\nUS tech site Gizmodo asked Professor Sonderman whether it was possible that the snake remains found into the prehistoric poo by chance, rather than being eaten but she told them this was highly unlikely: \u201cThe indigestible materials include some fibrous portions of plants, fur, bones, and the like.\u201d She told them. \u201cThe indigestible materials in the coprolite were coated in fecal matter. \u201cBased on the archaeological context it is possible that large portions of plant materials might have adhered to the coprolite soon after deposition but these exterior materials were removed from the coprolite before analysis.\u201d Bottom line: \u201cThe fang was inside the coprolite.
