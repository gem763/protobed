The company\u2019s lawyers have yet to respond in court or to media requests.\n\nAccording to the Broward County autopsy report, Awan died as a result of \u201cinhalation of products of combustion with a contributory cause of death of thermal injuries,\u201d while the medical examiner said the victim \u201cwas not identifiable on scene.\u201d\n\nThe car was towed away from the scene of the horror crash after firefighters extinguished the blaze and Awan\u2019s remains were removed. The vehicle subsequently reignited and burned again in the junkyard.\n\nPreviously, CCTV footage showed a Tesla spontaneously combusting in a parking garage in Shanghai.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
