His fastball can appear at any time and hitters are almost guaranteed to see his slider when he is ahead in the count or in two-strike situations. His curveball is used less often against right-handed hitters than it is against lefties but it is effective against both. And, just to keep hitters honest, Verlander will flash a change-up every once in a while. Yes, it\u2019s effective, too.\n\nLet\u2019s start with his fastball. Verlander is 36, but his four-seam fastball still hits almost 100 mph on the radar gun. It averages 95 mph this year, just a few ticks off his career-high set in 2009 (96 mph).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt sets up everything else,\u201d Sean Casey, Verlander\u2019s teammate in 2006 and 2007 and a current broadcaster and commentator for MLB Network, said in a phone interview with The Post. \u201cThat\u2019s why that\u2019s his best pitch. As a hitter I need to respect that first, and then if you are throwing the curveball, change-up and slider, I am in trouble.\u201d\n\nVerlander\u2019s effectiveness with the fastball comes from his ability to use the pitch around the upper part of the strike zone. Among the 190 pitchers who threw at least 500 four-seam fastballs this season, only five got more vertical movement than Verlander. (He got about three more inches of rise on the pitch \u2014 or 21 percent more \u2014 than similar MLB fastballs at his velocity.) The more rise a pitcher gets with his fastball, the harder it is to hit, especially for hitters using an uppercut swing.\n\nVerlander can thank the Astros organization for helping his fastball evolve into something fierce.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhen I first got to the organization, they kind of showed me some of the stuff that they can do, and try to do,\u201d he told USA Today last October. \u201cWhen you get older, every competitive advantage is an advantage, and I wanted that. I joke with guys in the organization that I was probably the first pitcher to come over and ask for more information, because they can kind of give you a lot. I want more. Give me everything you\u2019ve got.\u201d\n\nOne piece of information he receive suggested he throw his fastball from a higher release point, and he incorporated that message. Since joining the club in 2017, he started throwing his fastball from a higher and higher arm slot. The results have been phenomenal. His whiff rate on the pitch has risen from 20 percent in 2017 to almost over 31 percent in 2019. His strikeout rate has seen a similar improvement (24 to 32 percent). Plus, he has no fear of using his fastball as his first pitch (63 percent) or even in the heart of the strike zone (58 percent). Overall, Verlander\u2019s fastball saved the Astros more than half a run per 100 times thrown (0.6), according to FanGraphs, the 11th best mark among the fastballs used by American League starting pitchers.\n\nBecause his fastball is so effective up in the zone, Verlander can keep his breaking pitches low. His slider registered in the strike zone only about 40 percent of the time in each of the past two seasons, the lowest two marks of his career, yet the swinging strike rate on the pitch has seen a sharp increase over the past four years. Batters had a .134 batting average against his slider this season, with an obscene 41 percent strikeout rate. This pitch saved Houston more than three runs per 100 times thrown, making it the fifth-best slider in the majors this season, according to FanGraphs.\n\nVerlander\u2019s curve is also nasty. It\u2019s a traditional 12-6 curve that oftentimes makes opposing batters look silly when they try to make contact. In 2019, his curveball dropped 57 inches, two inches more than similar MLB curveballs at his velocity. Batters are hitting .197 against his curveball (10th best) and a third of batters facing Verlander end their at-bat on the pitch (33 percent). Here he is punching out future Nationals infielder Asdr\u00fabal Cabrera with the hook in April, and the smirk on Cabrera\u2019s face tells you everything you need to know about facing the pitch.\n\nThe velocity difference between his fastball and change-up, his least-used pitch, is about seven miles per hour, three miles per hour short of the ideal difference of 10 mph. That makes the pitch \u201cfirmer,\u201d meaning it induces more groundballs than whiffs. But the key is its deception: Verlander throws it from a similar release point as his fastball, making it difficult for batters to pick up the change of speed until it is too late. This season, including the playoffs, batters are 6 for 41 (.146) in at-bats ending with Verlander\u2019s change-up, with 13 strikeouts.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPut it together with Verlander\u2019s fierce competitiveness, and the Nationals should have a fitting challenge in Game 2.\n\n\u201cHe is as focused as anyone I have ever seen,\u201d Cole said of Verlander to the Houston Chronicle. \u201cHis preparation is second to none.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just trying to win a championship because that\u2019s what I want to do in my heart. I want to win,\u201d Verlander said. \u201cI want to win for my teammates. I want to win for myself. I want to win for the city.\"\n\nRead more about the World Series:\n\nAD\n\nAD", "description": "Of all the pitchers the Washington Nationals will face in the World Series, Verlander is the most versatile.", "authors": ["Neil Greenberg", "Reporter Analyzing Advanced Sports Statistics For The Washington Post"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/4s1p32Z3wqa-JOWixMT1PQ2aZUI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/I5I74KXKJ4I6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
