General Assembly, paves the way to send asylum-seekers to Honduras, one of the world's most violent countries, like its neighbors. A similar arrangement was signed with El Salvador last week; a more comprehensive agreement was previously sealed with Guatemala .\n\nPresident Donald Trump said at a news conference at the United Nations that the agreements, coupled with a crackdown by Mexico following tariff threats by his administration, \"will make a tremendous difference in our southern border.\"\n\nDetails of the Honduran agreement have not been released and much remains unclear, including when it would take effect. A senior Homeland Security Department official described broad outlines on a conference call with reporters and spoke on condition of anonymity, according to briefing ground rules.\n\nHomeland Security announced the agreement in a statement issued in the names of both governments, saying they would work \"to increase protection options for vulnerable populations.\" It said \"coordination and collaboration between the governments of the United States and Honduras has increased to new, unprecedented levels.\"\n\nThe deal completes a central component of Trump's strategy to deter asylum-seekers from entering the U.S. through Mexico . Curbing immigration is the president's signature political issue, and Trump constantly cites \"loopholes\" in the U.S. asylum system.\n\nIt was swiftly condemned by immigrant advocates.\n\n\"This is yet another move in a string of agreements that continue to make a grotesque mockery of the right to asylum,\" said Charanya Krishnaswami, the advocacy director for the Americas at Amnesty International USA. \"We will say it again and again: people cannot be forced to seek safety in countries where they will not be safe.\"\n\nU.S. immigration officials said in March that the U.S. border had reached a breaking point, with tens of thousands of migrant families crossing. That had led to massive overcrowding and reports of fetid and filthy conditions and prolonged detention at U.S. border facilities not meant to hold people more than a few days. It's unclear whether the numbers will rise again as the desert weather cools.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. Supreme Court this month cleared the way for the administration to deny asylum to anyone who traveled through another country to reach the border.\n\nThe asylum ban has taken effect in tandem with U.S. efforts to help impoverished, dangerous and corrupt Central American countries absorb large numbers of people seeking refuge there. The State Department acknowledged the poor conditions in Honduras in a 2018 human rights report.\n\n\"Organized criminal elements, including local and transnational gangs and narcotics traffickers, were significant perpetrators of violent crimes and committed acts of homicide, extortion, kidnapping, torture, human trafficking, intimidation, and other threats and violence directed against human rights defenders, judicial authorities, lawyers, the business community, journalists, bloggers, women, and members of vulnerable populations,\" the report said.\n\nIt said that there were reports \"arbitrary and unlawful killings,\" complaints of torture, arbitrary arrests and detentions and \"harsh and life-threatening prison conditions.\"\n\nIn a nod to the absence of a robust network to absorb refugees, acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan on Monday announced $47 million in aid for Guatemala to build its asylum system. It remains unclear what assistance El Salvador and Honduras may get.\n\nAnd during a meeting with El Salvador's president, Nayib Bukele, on the sidelines of the General Assembly, Trump said the agreements were \"good for all of us.\"\n\nMost families arrested or stopped at the U.S.-Mexico border are from the area known as the Northern Triangle: Guatemala, Honduras or El Salvador. While they would not be returned to their home countries, they would be sent to other countries they passed through. For example, Hondurans must travel through Guatemala to reach the U.S. by land.", "description": "The Trump administration signed a deal Wednesday with a third Central American country that would effectively seal off the region, preventing asylum-seekers traveling through from entering the United States.
