Officials said the baby elephant drowned and the five adults, found in a ravine below the baby, fell trying to reach it.\n\nElephants are stuck Oct. 5 on a small cliff at a waterfall at Khao Yai National Park in central Thailand.

The park is home to about 300 elephants, the news agency reported.\n\nAsian elephants are classified as endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.\n\nThe surviving elephants will probably experience grief. When two elephants died this year at an Indianapolis zoo, officials confirmed that the rest of the herd reacted emotionally.\n\n\"We know that elephants grieve. They are intensely social,\" Indianapolis Zoo President Rob Shumaker said.\n\nContributing: Joel Shannon, USA TODAY; The Associated Press\n\nFollow USA TODAY's Ryan Miller on Twitter @RyanW_Miller\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Elephants in Thailand Khao Yai park die trying to save drowned calf", "description": "Elephant carcasses were found at Haew Narok waterfall in Khao Yai National Park in Thailand.", "authors": ["Ryan W.
