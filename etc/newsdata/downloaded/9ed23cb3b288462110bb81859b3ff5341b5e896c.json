TLLTF, +1.60% TILT, +14.29% said Thursday the temporary vaping ban in its home state of Massachusetts should have little to no impact on its revenue and growth in the short term. The Cambridge-based company, which describes itself as a technology cannabis platform, said the four-month ban will prevent it from selling Jupiter Research LLC products in the Commonwealth, but said those account for less than 2% of Jupiter's overall annual revenue, citing internal company data. The company said the ban, which comes after an outbreak of a serious lung illness that has killed at least eight people and sickened more than 530 and is believed to be linked to vaping, will also have little effect on its subsidiary Commonwealth Alternative Care. \"In the long term, we believe this is an opportunity for regulatory bodies to eliminate many of the unsafe products on the market in Massachusetts,\" the company said. Patients have told doctors they had vaped THC-based products, mostly acquired in the black market, and cannabis companies have urged a greater crackdown on black market activities in its wake. U.S.-listed shares of Tilt are trading at 28 cents and have shed 89% of their value in 2019.", "description": "Tilt Holdings Inc. said Thursday the temporary vaping ban in its home state of Massachusetts should have little to no impact on its revenue and growth in the...", "authors": ["Ciara Linnane", "Corporate News Editor"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
