His attorney, Tebogo Malatji, called the claims \"malicious, yet nonsensical utterances\" and said Surv\u00e9's attacks on Gordhan were unsubstantiated, without basis in any evidence or facts. Malatji did not immediately give additional comment on Saturday.\n\nEarlier in the week, Surv\u00e9 also said he intended to sue the FSCA. The authority, in turn, has said it will defend itself if any such legal action is brought.\n\nIn an emailed response to questions from Fin24 on Friday, Surv\u00e9 said he had never implied that Ramaphosa was part of the raid.\n\nHowever, he said, he had been \"been presented with sufficient evidence to show that \u2026 Gordhan has had several meetings, and with numerous people, including FSCA officials that indicate he had a hand in the matter\".\n\nAsked what evidence he had to indicate this, he responded: \"The evidence will be presented at the appropriate time and in the appropriate forum.\"\n\nWhen asked about an apparent change in tone towards the president, after having said, publicly, that reporters in the Independent stable were intending to publish information on Ramaphosa ahead of the raid, Surv\u00e9 said editors and reporters had told him they had \"sensitive information about several powerful high-ranking political figures\" and had done so \"as a matter of professional courtesy\".\n\n'The Prime Minister'\n\n\"Reporters have clarified this to confirm that their information pertains to Minister Gordan (often referred to as the Prime Minister),\" he said.\n\nHe told Fin24 he was not at liberty to disclose any further information, as the journalists were required to protect their sources.\n\nHe also claimed the FSCA had misrepresented information to a judge, adding that \"several of them pretended to be police officers\" upon arrival at the premises for the raid. Staff were intimidated, Surv\u00e9 said.\n\nOn Friday, the Office of the Chief Justice issued a statement denying previous allegations by Surv\u00e9 that Judge PAL Gamble, who issued the warrants, was friends with Gordhan. Gamble said he had never met the minister.\n\nThe FSCA could not immediately be reached outside of normal office hours to respond to the latest allegations.\n\nSurv\u00e9 said Sekunjalo had lodged a complaint with the FSCA regarding manipulation of the AYO share price by \"asset managers and other parties [\u2026] yet we were the ones raided\".\n\nWhile the FSCA has not elaborated on the information it was seeking, according to Sekunjalo, the raid is related to AYO Technology Solutions, which listed on the JSE in 2017 after receiving a R4.3bn investment by state-owned asset manager the Public Investment Corporation. AYO is a subsidiary of a subsidiary of African Equity Empowerment Investments, which in turn is held by Sekunjalo.\n\nThe PIC earlier this year instituted a court application to claim back the R4.3bn, plus interest, that it had invested in AYO in 2017. AYO is opposing the claim.", "description": "Dr Iqbal Surv\u00e9 is blaming Pravin Gordhan for the raid on his office.", "authors": ["Marelise Van Der Merwe", "Jan Cronje"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/1990/cdc25f8bd9f64010bd12da9e2748da29.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
