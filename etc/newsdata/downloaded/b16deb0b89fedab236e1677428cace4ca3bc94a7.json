After the game, she dished out a bit of trash talk in her post-game interview on the court.\n\n\u201cThey got small forwards guarding me,\u201d Cambage said. \u201cIf they can\u2019t handle it, get in the weight room or get out of the post.\u201d\n\nThe small forward Cambage was referring to was actually center LaToya Sanders, who at a lanky 6-foot-3 is dwarfed by the 6-foot-9 Cambage. The Mystics don\u2019t double-team Cambage, and in Games 1 and 2, they were happy with how Sanders guarded her.\n\nSo Mystics guard Natasha Cloud shot back in her Instagram story and came to Sanders\u2019 defense:\n\nthen cloud came to the defense of latoya, and shatori hit the classic pic.twitter.com/a9pB27ImvJ \u2014 Matt Ellentuck (@mellentuck) September 23, 2019\n\nAs for the \u201cget in the weight room\u201d part, the Mystics covered that too. Cloud shouted \u201cLet\u2019s go, weight room crew!\u201d when the team took the court for practice Monday in Las Vegas, The Washington Post reported. This came after Cloud posted a video of herself and Myisha Hines-Allen doing push-ups with the caption, \u201cWe\u2019ll show you weight room.\u201d\n\nfirst, myisha hynes-allen and natasha cloud did pushups pic.twitter.com/fcXnYcecF0 \u2014 Matt Ellentuck (@mellentuck) September 23, 2019\n\nIt should also be noted that Aces coach Bill Laimbeer, long known for fielding physical teams, told reporters that Cambage\u2019s comment was \u201ccorrect.\u201d\n\nBut the Mystics lead the series 2-1 and can close it out Tuesday night at Mandalay Bay Events Center in Las Vegas. The game tips off at 9 p.m. EST on ESPN2.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
