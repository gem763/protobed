'Will we not fall?'\n\nClutching Scarlett's hand, she edged up one step at a time. Another woman was aghast at the sight of herself in the hall mirror. 'Hello?' she gasped, touching it. 'I thought there was someone on the other side.' And then, changing her story, she added: 'At first I thought it was water.'\n\nIt's an insult to us and to the Himba, to pretend that these people are primitive children oblivious to the simplest Western technologies.\n\nThe whole lot was plonked among huts built from wood and cattle dung by the nomadic Himba people\n\nChannel 4 bosses do like shows about remote African tribes. Earlier this year film-maker Livia Simoka visited the Mbendjele Yaka pygmy people of the Republic of the Congo. They don't have tellies, but they have discovered guns . . . and mobile phones. It's a fair bet they've seen mirrors before.\n\nThe Moffatts, a friendly but self-obsessed bunch, didn't question for a moment whether the Himba were having them on. Scarlett was much more occupied with worries about her figure, and whether she dared wear the local traditional costume \u2014 a necklace, a goatskin skirt and not a lot else.\n\n'I'm hoping that I'll learn to like my body just a little bit more,' she sniffled. 'I think when yer judged on the way ya look it does affect ya.'\n\nPoor little princess. She goes all the way to Africa, sees so much poverty and hardship, and she's still bleating on about 'body confidence' and her delicate feelings.\n\nSelf-pity never saved anyone, a hard fact the volunteer crews of the RNLI drummed home on Saving Lives At Sea (BBC2). With ruthless lack of sentiment, they split all medical emergencies into two categories: 'big sick' and 'little sick'.\n\n'Little sick' means they'll try to patch you up on the water with their first aid kit. 'Big sick' means a high-speed rescue and a trip to hospital \u2014 being winched up to an air-sea helicopter, in the case of a bloke who suffered a stroke while out on his fishing boat.\n\nEvery emergency is a race against time. One kayaker who capsized while watching the puffins off the Scottish coast described how the swell 'washes you about like a sock in a washing machine'. He was half-frozen by the time the crew found him.\n\nBut the biggest drama came as the lifeboatmen of Kinsale, southern Ireland, battled a rising estuary tide to save Paddy \u2014 a horse with its leg caught in a metal frame for trapping oysters.
