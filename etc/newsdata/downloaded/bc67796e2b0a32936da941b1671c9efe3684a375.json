On the contrary. Rovana still has my unconditional support.\"\n\nShe added that Plumb \"unlike others, would always prioritize the European interests and policies that contribute to the consolidation of the European project.\"\n\nHungary's candidate for neighborhood and enlargement commissioner, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Tr\u00f3cs\u00e1nyi, was also rejected by the committee.\n\nOn Sunday Zolt\u00e1n Kov\u00e1cs, spokeperson for Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, called the rejection an \"witch-hunt,\" and blamed \"internationalist\" pro-migration forces. He confirmed Tr\u00f3cs\u00e1nyi's candidature enjoys the government's support in an interview with state-owned radio.\n\nThe unprecedented move by the Legal Affairs Committee means the pair cannot proceed to confirmation hearings that begin next week for von der Leyen's Commission, which is due to take office on November 1.\n\nTheir rejection does not mean new candidates will automatically be put forward however. The committee could suggest ways to clear their conflict of interests concerns.\n\nIn a letter dated Thursday and seen by POLITICO, European Parliament President David Sassoli asked whether the Legal Affairs Committee will \"draw up recommendations aimed at resolving an actual or potential conflict of interest or, as a last resort, will conclude that Commissioner-designate Rovana Plumb is unable to exercise her function.\" He gave the committee until Monday noon to reply.\n\nIf MEPs stick to their guns, Sassoli will ask Commission President-designate Ursula von der Leyen how she plans to proceed. She might withdraw the nominees and ask both governments for alternatives, but D\u0103ncil\u0103 and Kov\u00e1cs' intervention suggests that will not go down well in Bucharest and Budapest.\n\n\"I hope the JURI committee's response will be a positive one, in line with the proposal made by Romania and supported by the President of the European Commission,\" wrote D\u0103ncil\u0103 on Saturday.\n\nHanne Cokelaere, Carmen Paun and Lili Bayer contributed reporting.", "description": "Viorica D\u0103ncil\u0103 said Rovana Plumb had her \u2018unconditional support.\u2019", "authors": ["Paola Tamma", "Florian Eder", "Lili Bayer", "Eddy Wax"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/h_53346603-1-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
