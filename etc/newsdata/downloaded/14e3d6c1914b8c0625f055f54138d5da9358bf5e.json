The Nasdaq Composite Index added 5.49 points, or 0.1%, finishing at 8,182.88. The S&P 500 traded as high as 3,021.99 earlier Thursday -- within striking distance of its all-time closing high of 3,025.86 set on July 26.\n\nWhat's driving the market?\n\nWall Street stocks were higher in morning trade after reports that President Donald Trump was exempting hundreds of Chinese products from tariffs. (link)\n\nTwo negotiating sessions over the two days between the U.S. and Chinese delegations were being held covering agricultural issues and the strengthening of China's intellectual protections and forced transfer of U.S. technology to Chinese firms, Reuters reported (link). Some of the Chinese delegation will visit US farming regions over the weekend but the Montana Farm bureau tweeted that the visit was cancelled (link).\n\n(link)\n\nThe cancellation came as U.S.-Chinese trade talks were held in Washington and U.S. President Donald Trump said he wanted a complete trade deal with the Asian nation (link), not just an agreement for China to buy more U.S. agricultural goods.\n\nOther factors adding some volatility on Friday include \"quadruple witching\", the S&P 500 index, S&P 400 and Sox Semi index will rebalance Friday as well.\n\n\"Friday should be a massive liquidity day for equities markets due to quad witching and the rebalancing of several major index families, pensions planning to rebalance could use this as a prime opportunity to trade into (or out of) positions ahead of month-end,\" wrote Dave Lutz, head of ETF Trading at JonesTrading, in a Friday note.\n\n\"With the S&P 500 outperforming on both a monthly and quarterly basis versus other asset classes, this results in a current projection of $17 billion in selling of U.S. equities from pension funds,\" he added.\n\n\"Quadruple witching creates volatility,\" said Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors, Inc. The sudden lurch downward in the early afternoon wasn't driven by any noticeable technical sell signals, Orlando said in a phone interview, but may have been traders consolidating gains.\n\nMarkets have moved up strongly since the recent bottom, at the end of August, Orlando noted.\"It's probably a good time for profit-taking,\" he said.\n\nInvestors are also pondering the direction of Federal Reserve monetary policy after a quarter percentage point interest rate cut on Wednesday.\n\nOn Friday St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard explained his dissent (link)from the Federal Open Market Committee's decision on Wednesday to reduce rates, saying he advocated for a more substantial 50 basis-point cut because he thinks the manufacturing sector already appears to be in recession.\n\nBoston Fed President Eric Rosengren, on the other hand, was one of two hawkish dissenters at the recent meeting, and he explained his opposition to rate cuts (link) in a Friday statement, arguing that additional monetary stimulus would risk inflated asset prices and increased leverage.\n\nFed vice chair Richard Clarida defended this week's interest rate cut (link)on Friday though, arguing that the U.S. economy remains in a good place but the global picture is worsening.\n\nIn recent weeks, monetary stimulus by central banks around the world has helped to ease fears about slowing global economic growth, but liquidity remains an issue for U.S. money markets given the deluge of U.S. Treasury borrowing to fund a widening fiscal deficit this year. The New York Fed outlined a schedule on Friday (link)that would see it conduct daily repurchasing operations through October 10 to provide money market liquidity.\n\nWhich stocks are in focus?\n\nShares of Apple Inc. (AAPL) were up 0.2% Friday morning, as the new iPhone 11 goes on sale for the first time in stores. J.P. Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee said that healthy preorders (link) for the product indicates a \"robust\" trend for iPhone revenue. The gains led Apple to reclaim a trillion-dollar valuation during early Friday trade.\n\nNetflix Inc. (NFLX) stock fell 5.9%, putting it on track for its third consecutive loss, after falling 2.4% and 1.7% Wednesday and Thursday, respectively. CEO Reed Hastings warned investors at a conference Friday (link) that \"While we've been competing with many people in the last decade, it's a whole new world starting in November . . . It'll be tough competition.\"\n\nShares of McDermott International Inc. (MDR) soared 68% Friday morning, after the energy-services company said it was exploring a sale of its Lummus Technology business (link), which has been valued at $2.5 billion. McDermott's market cap sat at 287.1 million as of Thursday's close. The stock plummeted 73% week-to-Thursday's close over concerns that the firm was considering bankruptcy.\n\nHow are other markets trading?\n\nIn commodities, oil futures rose, with West Texas Intermediate crude for October delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 1.7%, to trade at about $59 a barrel.\n\nGold rose 0.3% to trade at about $1,510.9 an ounce, while the U.S. dollar, as measured by the ICE U.S. Dollar Index , a gauge of the buck against a basket of leading rivals, edged 0.3% higher.\n\nThe 10-year U.S. note was little changed at 1.773%, while the 2-year fell three basis points to 1.710%.\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 20, 2019 13:52 ET (17:52 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
