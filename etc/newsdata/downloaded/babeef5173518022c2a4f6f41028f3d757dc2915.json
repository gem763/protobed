But authorities said the disparity does not necessarily indicate racial bias in local law enforcement.\n\n\u201cWhat I would say to anyone who looks at this report and wants to have a gut reaction \u2014 it\u2019s too early to be upset,\u201d Police Chief Peter Newsham said in a news briefing, adding that he wants to retain outside experts to further analyze the demographics of police stops.\n\nThe 14-page report, which provides data on 11,000 stops from July 22 to Aug. 18, is the Metropolitan Police Department\u2019s first, long-delayed response to a 2016 D.C. law requiring the collection of detailed demographic information about people stopped by police, regardless of whether they are arrested.\n\nThe report isn\u2019t limited to traffic stops. It defines a stop as any \u201ctemporary investigative detention of a person for the purpose of determining whether probable cause exists to make an arrest.\u201d It adds, \u201cIf a person is under a reasonable impression that he or she is not free to leave the [officer\u2019s] presence a stop has occurred.\u201d\n\nAlso Thursday, the raw data that was used to compile the report were uploaded to the department\u2019s website so it can be reviewed by several groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union of D.C., that filed a lawsuit to force the department to comply with the data-collection mandate.\n\n[Court orders D.C. to compile data on police stops.]\n\n\n\nD.C. Police Chief Peter Newsham address the media in a July news conference. (Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)\n\nA spokeswoman for the ACLU had no immediate comment on the data, saying \u201cit\u2019s going to take a while\u201d for the group\u2019s lawyers to study the information.\n\nWhile African Americans made up 70 percent of the people in all police stops, they were 86 percent of those involved in what the report called \u201cnon-ticket stops,\u201d defined as \u201cstops that involved an arrest, search\u201d or police action other than traffic enforcement. The report said 15 percent of people in all stops, and 7 percent of those involved in non-ticket stops, were white.\n\nAs of July 2018, the District\u2019s population was 46.4 percent African American and 45.6 percent white, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nThe reason for disparity in police stops \u201cis the number one question that remains unanswered,\u201d Newsham said when asked about the possibility of racial bias. \u201cThe questions really is, what should our stops look like? . . . This report is a snapshot of what our stops do look like for a four-week period. But we don\u2019t know what they should look like.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cWe\u2019ve already reached out to a couple of organizations to come in and get a sense of that.\u201d\n\nThe data collection is part of an initiative called the Neighborhood Engagement Achieves Results law, known as the NEAR Act, which passed the D.C. Council unanimously three years ago. The legislation transformed the District\u2019s approach to fighting crime by seeking to address the underlying causes of violence and confront those challenges using a health-based model.\n\n[D.C. budget provides funding boost for NEAR Act programs.]\n\nIt established a city agency, the Office of Neighborhood Safety and Engagement, to oversee programs related to the effort. The law also requires police to collect a wide range of data when officers stop and frisk people or conduct stops, including the person\u2019s race, ethnicity and gender, and duration of the stop.\n\nIn complaining about the long delay in providing the data, the ACLU said the police department had \u201cobfuscated, dragged its feet and even misled the public.\u201d After the group and other plaintiffs filed a lawsuit in D.C. Superior Court, a judge in June ordered the department to complete the data collection.\n\nNewsham said the delay was caused by a funding problem, since solved, that left the department with insufficient computer capabilities. Although the department will continue making raw data on police stops available to the public, he said, it will not regularly distill that data into a report, as it did Monday.\n\nRead more:\n\nFound insane in one killing, D.C. man killed again, police say\n\n\u2018Aryan\u2019 and \u2018Octoroon\u2019: Couples challenge racial labels to get married in Virginia\n\n\u2018I\u2019m not giving you the power\u2019: Sister confronts twin\u2019s killer in Va. courtroom\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Chief wants further analysis, saying the cause of the disparity isn\u2019t necessarily racial bias.", "authors": ["Paul Duggan", "Crime Reporter", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/w_pouwAUTigfcA2H8SZ6DjMpQiI=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JMEGU6VMVAI6TFARUYEPTUGC2M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
