Here's what we know right now as we come on the air. Overnight the U.S. Special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker stepped down. Volcker's name was mentioned in the whistle-blower complaint and he is set to speak to investigators next week. The Democrats have issued a subpoena for secretary of state Mike Pompeo. They want him to produce documents related to the investigation. Plus, we're learning new details about storage methods at the white house. Sources telling ABC news the administration changed how transcripts of calls with foreign leaders were stored after two calls in early 2017 were leaked. We have team coverage this morning. Our legal and political analysts are standing by, but we start here with ABC's David Wright who is at the white house with the very latest. David, good morning. Reporter: Good morning, guys. The uproar over Ukraine has now spread to the state department. House investigators want to know if the president sought to enlist the foreign service to do his political dirty work, and that's led to the first subpoenas and the first resignation. The U.S. Special envoy to Ukraine resigned late Friday after the whistle-blower accused him of doing damage control in the alleged effort to get Ukraine to dig up dirt on Joe Biden ahead of the 2020 election. Kurt Volker, a former ambassador, was sent to Ukraine in the wake of the Russia invasion. He's one of several state department officials named in the whistle-blower's complaint. That document which sparked the impeachment inquiry claims Volker and another ambassador sought to help Ukrainian leaders understand and respond to the differing messaging they were receiving from official U.S. Channels on the one hand and from Mr. Giuliani on the other. Rudy Giuliani is the president's private lawyer. The whistle-blower called him a central figure in the alleged effort to pressure Ukraine. Giuliani's name mentioned 30 times in the complaint. Secretary of state Mike Pompeo got served a subpoena Friday. House investigators hope to put state department records under a microscope paying careful attention to any mention of Giuliani. Giuliani told sky news he was acting in an official capacity. The state department asked me to help them deal with the Ukrainian government with regard to meetings with president trump. The state department doesn't investigate a crime. I was asked to do this by the state department. Reporter: Pompeo says he's satisfied all state department officials had an appropriate mission. To create a better relationship between the united States and Ukraine. Reporter: Speaking on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" house speaker Nancy Pelosi said the top priority for the impeachment inquiry is to sort out the facts as soon as possible. We have to stay focused as far as the public is concerned on the fact that the president of the United States used taxpayer dollars to shake down the leader of another country for his own political gain. The rest of it is ancillary. Reporter: But the president won't make that easy tweeting, if that perfect phone call with the president of Ukraine isn't considered appropriate, then no future president can ever again speak to another foreign leader. That former special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker is due to give a deposition later this week on Thursday. Most members of congress have gone back to their districts for autumn recess but the leaders of this house investigation are still here. They want to move this investigation along. David, there is a lot of questions surrounding how the record of this phone call was stored. How did they end up on this top secret server and now we're learning more about how this became the standard operating procedure for these kind of calls between the president and world leaders? Reporter: That's right, Eva. Multiple sources tell ABC news that the white house changed the procedures and started using this classified server after earlier phone calls by the president to the leaders of Australia and Mexico were leaked to the press changing the procedures appeared to stop the leaking problem, but what's not known is if this was the procedure for all phone calls or just certain sensitive phone calls and that's something that house investigators are going to really want to get to the bottom of, Eva. David Wright for us at the white house this morning, thank you. David and Eva, thank you. So much to talk about. Let's bring in a pair of ringers, ABC news supreme court contributor Kate Shaw and from Texas this morning ABC news chief political analyst Matthew dowd. Good morning to both of you. Kate, let me start with you. Let's start with the subpoena the Democrats have issued for documents from the secretary of state. What's the significance to you and is the administration likely to even comply with this because they have stonewalled in the past. Right, so the whistle-blower complaint this week is the beginning of a process. The Democrats on the hill will want to get access to documents and testimony and they'll move quickly and be focused in what they ask for, and I think we're all going to watch closely to see what the white house does. They could fight this and take it to court and a court will look at how strong their need for the information is and what the white house says about why it wants to keep the information back. And I think an impeachment inquiry is a strong reason the house can give for needing access to this information so I think courts are very likely to side with the house investigators. The question I think is how quickly it plays out and it could take some time. You were saying earlier to me off camera there is a possibility that the white house is arguing, if they try to fight it it would be weakened by the fact they've released so many documents up until this point. We had the whistle-blower complaint and dni Maguire's testimony and though could have fought both things and it becomes difficult to fight for secrecy around other things. Their position going into any litigation is not that strong. Let's go to Matthew dowd now. The Democrats say they're moving quickly on this impeachment process. We heard David Wright talk about that. There's talk of wrapping this up before the new year. Why is speed so important for them, and is speed good politically for the president as well? Well, I think speed is important for every side in this because as you know and Kate knows this is not a conviction. This is basically the equivalent of a political indictment where they lay out the charges and then it moves to the senate which then the senate has a process, equivalent of a trial of what the president did and what his punishment should be in this, so I think the speed is important because if it's not done this year, it needs to go to that trial as I say and the trial will be held in the senate next year so I think the president would be better off with a speedy resolution of this this year, and I think the Democrats are better off getting this done and moving it to the senate as quickly as possible. Let's dig in on the risks for the Democrats specifically. If their goal is to get rid of trump, a lot of people are asking why not wait 13 months and let the American people decide in the next election. Well, I think the problem, Dan, that we have here is because this artificial creation has been made that a president can't get indicted that's been created by departments of justice over the last 30 or 40 years, the only way to hold a president accountable for bad behavior or behavior that may come close to violating the law is impeachment between two elections, so over four years the only way to hold a president accountable is impeachment in this. I think if the president is impeached it's only the third time in history so there's risk to the Democrats. This is something profoundly powerful that will affect the American public. I think the Democrats have to be careful that they don't get too far in front of the American public that they get so far in front of the public that they -- the public doesn't go along with what they're doing so I think the Democrats have to be methodical but understand this is an unbelievable pointed profound moment in American history. And the polls show the American public deeply divide the as we have been for awhile now. Kate, one final question to you. There's been a lot of talk about whether there's been a quid pro quo here. In other words, can the Democrats prove that the president explicitly said to Ukraine, you help me investigate Joe Biden or I'm going to withhold U.S. Military aid. That would violate federal bribery statutes but your point as we were discussing earlier again off camera is that you don't have to commit a crime to be impeached. I think that's right, so the constitution says impeachment is for treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors, so I think because the word crime and misdemeanor are both in the constitution there's this tendency to think oh, a high crime, that's like a crime but a very serious one and actually high crimes and misdemeanors are actually quite different from ordinary criminal offenses. The idea has always been this kind of high crime and misdemeanor is a political offense, an abuse of office and public trust so whether or not that kind of conduct violates a criminal statute is actually somewhat immaterial so I actually think it's a mistake to get too bogged down whether elements of a federal crime can be established but that sounds like somewhat how the conversation is playing out. Kate Shaw and Matthew dowd, thank you both.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "description": "The Democrats have issued a subpoena to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, urging him to produce documents related to the investigation.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/190928_gma_wright3_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
