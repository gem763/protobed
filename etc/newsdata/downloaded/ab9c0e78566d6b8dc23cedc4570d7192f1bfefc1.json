For Vatwani it was the beginning of a three-decade-long commitment to treating the \u201cwandering\u201d of India \u2013 mentally ill people left to roam on city streets \u2013 and reuniting them with their families.\n\nAs the patient recovered, he began to speak in English and recall bits of information about his family. This enabled Vatwani to locate his kin in the south-eastern state of Andhra Pradesh, a significant distance from Mumbai. \u201cWe realised then, that there was no organisation in Mumbai, or for that matter in India, which rehabilitated wandering mentally ill people,\u201d Vatwani says. This incident, which occurred more than 30 years ago, was a turning point in the lives of the psychiatrists.\n\nAccording to a 2015-16 survey commissioned by India\u2019s government, nearly 15% of Indian adults suffer from some form of mental illness. This translates to more than 180 million people in the country, though only a minuscule number have access to the necessary medical facilities. There is a severe shortage of psychiatrists, especially in rural areas. According to Vatwani, \u201cOver 80% of the government hospitals in India do not have a psychiatrist. One of the main reasons being that many Indian psychiatrists prefer to move abroad, for better prospects. There are less than 4,000 practising psychiatrists in a nation of over a billion people!\u201d\n\nOf the people who do have access to professional help, very few are willing to seek it. Mental illness continues to be largely a taboo subject in India.\n\nSoon after the first reunion, in 1988, Vatwani and his wife, Dr Smitha Vatwani, set up the Shraddha Rehabilitation Foundation. The word \u201cshraddha\u201d, which comes from Sanskrit, means \u201cdevotion\u2019\u201d. The foundation has been dedicated to rehabilitating wandering mentally ill people and reuniting them post-recovery with their loved ones.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Vatwani in the process of locating the hometown of a patient.

I shudder to think of what they must have endured out there, especially the women. They are wandering in all kinds of severe weather \u2013 sick, hungry and invisible to the world,\u201d Vatwani says.\n\nAfter the Shraddha team has picked up a mentally disturbed person, she or he is taken to the residential treatment centre in Karjat, on the outskirts of Mumbai. Vatwani says: \u201cOur medical treatment is coupled with kindness and empathy, which the patient rarely experienced on the streets. Depending on the severity of the illness, the person will spend anywhere between two to three months at the centre.\u201d\n\nOnce Vatwani has certified a patient as ready to go home, a social worker who speaks the same language (or a close dialect) as the patient accompanies them home. Recognising the Herculean efforts of Shraddha\u2019s committed team of social workers, Vatwani says: \u201cSometimes, patients\u2019 families live in the most remote corners of the country and finding them requires some serious deductive work by the team. Often, we have to get the local police involved to locate the relatives.\u201d\n\nFrom Delhi street child to acclaimed photographer: Vicky Roy \u2013 in pictures Read more\n\nEven after the reunion, the patient\u2019s treatment continues as the foundation regularly sends medication to their home.\n\nShraddha\u2019s rate of reuniting patients with their relatives is a staggering 95%, with more than 8,000 reunions to date, Vatwani says. Some patients have been separated from their families for years, even for decades. Inderjeet Ghai, a 70-year-old from the northern state of Punjab, was reunited with his kin, nearly 54 years after he had gone missing.\n\nMany of the recovered patients have successfully reintegrated into society, with several going on to have jobs and careers. Gangadhar Vinode, 47, who was brought together with his relatives in 1991, after a three-month stay at Shraddha, is today a successful real estate developer in the neighbouring city of Pune.\n\n\u201cIn seven out of 10 [reunions], the relatives are overjoyed at having their missing family member back. Occasionally, in the case of female patients, relatives are hesitant to accept them as they are concerned about what people around them will say. In such situations, the accompanying social worker will explain the importance of having the family\u2019s support and involvement, for the patient\u2019s recovery. We\u2019ve mostly had successful [reunions],\u201d says Vatwani.\n\nFor his decades of service to this vulnerable section of society, in 2018 Vatwani received the Magsaysay award, widely recognised as Asia\u2019s equivalent of the Nobel prize. \u201cGiven the scale of the mental health problem in the country, my contribution is insignificant,\u201d says Vatwani. Despite his humility, however, the award has brought much needed global attention to the cause of wandering mentally ill people, and mental health in general.\n\n\u201cAnyone can be afflicted by a mental illness and end up wandering the streets,\u201d Vatwani says. \u201cDepression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, addiction and other neuroses are so common nowadays. People suffering from these problems need as much love and support as those suffering from a physical illness.\u201d", "description": "Dr Vatwani has spent three decades reuniting patients with mental health problems with their families", "authors": ["Anne Pinto-Rodrigues"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/457f8dd2787e14d6c2df977d2c0ef474963e03b4/0_463_3879_2328/master/3879.jpg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6402f6960587f4434a43c4a695da70ef", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
