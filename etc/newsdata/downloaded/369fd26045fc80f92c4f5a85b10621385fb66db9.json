Duty-free treatment will be revoked for all Thailand's seafood exports to the United States over labor issues, the USTR's office said.\n\nThe United States was also opening reviews of its duty-free treatment for certain products from South Africa over intellectual property issues and Azerbaijan over workers' rights concerns, the USTR's office said in a statement.\n\nSeparate reviews concerning goods from Bolivia, Iraq and Uzbekistan were closed without changes to their treatment, the USTR's office said.
