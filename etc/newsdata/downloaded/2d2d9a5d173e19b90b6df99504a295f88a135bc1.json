Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach\u2019s players wore the look not of players that had won a derby but a war of attrition against themselves. As Marcus Thuram, the summer arrival whose first two Bundesliga goals sealed an ultimately unlikely triumph against Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf on Sunday, took off his shirt and placed it on one of the corner flags, which he then proceeded to gleefully swish above his head, it felt like he was sending the signal miles around of a battle won.\n\nIn isolation recent Bundesliga results look good, with a push into the top six on the back of successive wins over local rivals, at K\u00f6ln last week and now over D\u00fcsseldorf this. Compartmentalising, however, has been impossible for Gladbach\u2019s players and fans. This meant so much because it was \u2013 astonishingly \u2013 their first win at home since they beat Augsburg on 26 January.\n\nInter\u2019s perfect start is flattering but they are in better shape than Milan | Nicky Bandini Read more\n\nBorussia-Park has the aspect of a modern fortress; big, imposing and stood alone some four miles to the south-west of M\u00f6nchengladbach\u2019s centre, with shuttle buses ferrying fans out from the city\u2019s Hauptbahnhof on matchdays. Yet during that run of 11 winless games there this year \u2013 four draws, seven defeats \u2013 it has felt more like a site of desolation than a formidable home turf within which Gladbach can corner enemies.\n\nIt all reached a nadir on Thursday night in the Europa League against Wolfsberg (that\u2019s right, not even Wolfsburg), when much of the gentle optimism surrounding new coach Marco Rose began to evaporate in 45 minutes of embarrassment. Last year\u2019s third-placed side in the Austrian Bundesliga were making a debut in the group stage of European club competition but raced into a three-goal lead by half-time, aided and abetted by some statuesque home defending at set pieces, an achilles heel that the new coach is making a priority to fix.\n\nWolfsberg\u2019s own story is a terrific one but from the Gladbach perspective, there was little other way to analyse it than that they had been humiliated at home by a club from a town whose population could fit into Borussia-Park twice over with room to spare. Eventually finishing 4-0, it was Gladbach\u2019s worst-ever defeat at home in Europe. Kicker\u2019s Oliver Bitter spoke for many when he described it as \u201ca disgrace\u201d and it was the kind of performance, goalkeeper Yann Sommer told journalists after Sunday\u2019s win, \u201cthat must never be repeated\u201d.\n\nIn this context, you know just how important the visit of D\u00fcsseldorf had become. Gladbach started as if they knew it too. They looked timid and it was with the flow of the game that they went a goal down in the seventh minute when Kasim Adams headed home after \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 a corner wasn\u2019t cleared. It was an invidious position to be in against Friedhelm Funkel\u2019s side, one of the last outside Bayern or Dortmund that a team in Gladbach\u2019s situation would want to face. Fortuna are compact, well-drilled and able to pick off opponents with little possession.\n\nGiven all this, and that you could have been forgiven midway through the second half for concluding that D\u00fcsseldorf were on their way to playing out a routine away win, one had to admire Rose\u2019s sang froid. He had rejected the temptation to turn his XI upside down after Thursday\u2019s shaming, only making three changes to his starting lineup. Nor did he make panic substitutions as the minutes ebbed away and the anxiety in the stands was palpable.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Gladbach were on the end of a Europa League hammering from Wolfsberg last week.

Thuram was introduced for his compatriot Alessane Pl\u00e9a (who scored the winner in last week\u2019s derby at K\u00f6ln) in the last 25 minutes and it did the trick. A tidily taken equaliser was followed by a winner, expertly hooked in from close range after a goalmouth scramble that took some unpicking by VAR before it was confirmed that there was no offside in front of the Nordkurve. Already suspecting their potential winning goal was a good one, Borussia-Park and its players erupted as it was confirmed.\n\nRose was blunt in his thoughts on the hero of the day. \u201cFootball is becoming more and more physical,\u201d said the coach, \u201cand those who don\u2019t push their limits will have problems. At K\u00f6ln, Marcus didn\u2019t do what we need for our intense play.\u201d Thuram clearly took it on the chin and showed his own mettle for the high-pressure moment \u2013 the sort of nerve that saw him take, and score, a winning stoppage-time penalty in the Coupe de la Ligue at Paris Saint-Germain for previous club Guingamp last season, having missed one earlier in the game.\n\nIt\u2019s the sort of guts that Gladbach, and Rose, need. After such a chastening week, the recovery is impressive, and promises much going forward.\n\nTalking points\n\n\u2022 Hertha finally registered a first win of the season and former Manchester City winger Javair\u00f4 Dilrosun sparked it with a Ryan Giggs-esque solo goal against Paderborn, although it was hard-going against the Bundesliga\u2019s minnows. \u201cWe\u2019ve been practicing high press training recently, but that didn\u2019t work out,\u201d noted Dilrosun \u2013 so Hertha gave Paderborn the ball and played on the break, a risky but eventually successful strategy.\n\n\u2022 Leverkusen recovered from their bad week \u2013 the beating at Dortmund was followed by a home Champions League loss to Lokomotiv Moscow \u2013 by turning over the other Berliners, Union, whose hopes disappeared when substitute Sebastian Polter saw red three minutes after coming on. \u201cBy the end, it felt like our third game in a week,\u201d noted Leverkusen coach Peter Bosz of his side stoically seeing the game out.\n\n\u2022 Leipzig roll on after winning 3-0 at Werder Bremen, who are having abysmal luck with injuries at the moment \u2013 Niclas F\u00fcllkrug, the most unfortunate of them all, tore an ACL in training this week meaning that Florian Kohfeldt\u2019s team were missing 10 first-teamers (factoring in the banned Nuri Sahin) for the leaders\u2019 visit.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\n\u2022 Dortmund lost ground after frittering more points on the road, conceding an 88th-minute Thomas Delaney own goal at Eintracht Frankfurt to draw 2-2. Despite the feeling that Lucien Favre\u2019s side were coasting, captain Marco Reus was angry with Sky\u2019s post-match suggestion that BVB have a mentality issue away from Westfalen. \u201cI don\u2019t care about your mentality shit, the same shit every week,\u201d he said before abruptly finishing the interview.\n\n\u2022 It was more plain sailing for Bayern, who signalled the beginning of Oktoberfest by beating K\u00f6ln 4-0. Robert Lewandowski\u2019s double means he has nine goals in the Bundesliga already, and he has matched Carsten Janker\u2019s record from 2000-01 of scoring in the first five matches of the league season. He even gave away the chance of a hat-trick in the second half, letting Philippe Coutinho have a penalty to score his first for Bayern.\n\n\u2022 Good news for Schalke too, whose win over Mainz on Friday was their third straight \u2013 and they have as many points already as they did after 11 games last term. Amine Harit, looking more like his old self, netted a sublime late winner. \u201cWe pulled together as a team,\u201d said Suat Serdar, who scored the opener against his old club \u201cThis was especially noticeable in the second half, when things didn\u2019t go so well. It speaks for the team.\u201d", "description": "Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach bounced back from Europa League humiliation with a vital Bundesliga victory", "authors": ["Andy Brassell"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73a9f88b019d12b676ac9522b12afab68934574c/487_100_2963_1778/master/2963.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8c13f228f29c9d9264b7b013621360e9", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
