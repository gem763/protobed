They're obviously looking at the World Cup and saying, 'this is an opportunity for us to give experiences to our citizens, to allow them to engage with the World Cup in any format but also get to go meet, see, support and view an international rugby side.'\"\n\nDeveloping the game\n\nJapan will become the first Asian side to host a rugby World Cup when the Brave Blossoms face Russia in the tournament's curtain-raiser on September 20.\n\nWhereas smoothly integrating the Welsh players into their new Japanese surroundings was always the primary objective of the project, increasing the popularity of rugby in Japan was also a key WRU goal.\n\nWelsh flags are carried through Kitakyushu.\n\n\"We've been introducing young boys and girls, men and women, able and unable into rugby, whatever level of their engagement is,\" Williams said.\n\n\"We've been coaching coaches and we've also been coaching referees. What we're trying to do is build a holistic base that hopefully rugby can thrive within the area. Engaging doesn't have to always be contact rugby or 15 on 15 as predominantly what they see is men's rugby.\n\n\"It could just be having fun with skills, drills, keeping fit, health and well-being ... learning communication skills or the soft-core skills that rugby helps develop within any social team that play along the length and breadth of Wales every weekend.\"\n\nA welcoming nation\n\nDuring five-day spells in Japan, Welsh rugby coaches trained over a thousand people of all ages.\n\nEnvoys from the WRU even played a part in the recent Wasshoi festival -- Kitakyushu's largest summer festival -- where they performed a four-and-a-half minute dance with thousands of local citizens.\n\n\"Every time we go over there, we're just amazed by the warmth and the way we're always welcomed by the Japanese people and citizens,\" said the 39-year-old Williams -- a former Welsh international.\n\n\"Every time, the experiences that we get, and our coaches get, and our employees get is just phenomenal with the welcome, the engagement activities that we do, getting to know one another's cultures, learning how to coach rugby without being able to speak the language at all.\n\n\"So, having to develop your coaching styles with more visual aids and with body language rather than just relying on your words.\"\n\nPhotos: RWC 2019 venues New Zealand beat Australia 34-17 to win its second straight Rugby World Cup at Twickenham Stadium, London in October 2015.
