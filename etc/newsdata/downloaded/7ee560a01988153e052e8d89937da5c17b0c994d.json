Apparently because he spent the offseason negotiating with the Rockets, but those talks haven\u2019t produced a deal.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nShams Charania of The Athletic:\n\nAfter months of discussions, free agent Iman Shumpert has decided to decline the Rockets' contract offer, sources tell @TheAthleticNBA @Stadium. Shumpert will not attend team minicamp this week in Las Vegas. \u2014 Shams Charania (@ShamsCharania) September 17, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nKelly Iko of The Athletic:\n\nSource: Terrence Jones, Nick Young, and Luc Mbah a Moute will be among the players in Vegas for the Rockets\u2019 minicamp. \u2014 Kelly Iko (@KellyIkoNBA) September 17, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nAlykhan Bijani of The Athletic:\n\nSource: Corey Brewer and Raymond Felton will also be at #Rockets\u2019 minicamp too.

The Rockets are close to the luxury tax and probably wouldn\u2019t guarantee Shumpert much. It doesn\u2019t take months to negotiate a simple minimum contract.\n\nShumpert (29) is a credible wing in a league starving for them. He played well for the Kings last season before getting traded to Houston, where he struggled. Other teams should be interested.\n\nThe Rockets have just nine players with guaranteed salaries. There\u2019s plenty of room for some of these past-their-prime veterans to make the regular-season roster. It might mostly depend on which of Terrence Jones (27), Nick Young (34), Luc Mbah a Moute (33), Corey Brewer (33), Raymond Felton (35) and Thabo Sefolosha (35) are in the best shape at this stage.", "description": "Iman Shumpert is the best free agent available.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/C1gRV8H97UA4chVF1mvsWg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/XC.wGY9cprOIYXySacqYGQ--~B/aD01NzY7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/0510002d095acd3529e20eac41dd22d4", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
