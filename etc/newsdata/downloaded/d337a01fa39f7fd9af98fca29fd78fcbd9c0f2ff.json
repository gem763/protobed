Their crime: They didn\u2019t register as a money transfer business.\n\nTheir luck: They drew a sympathetic judge.\n\nOne by one, U.S. District Judge Avern Cohn declined to send them to prison, despite guidelines that call for a few years or more behind bars. He noted that Yemen\u2019s financial system is a mess and its residents desperately need help. Defense lawyers have praised the judge for educating himself about the poorest country in the Arab world and understanding cultural traditions.\n\n\u201cOnly people without compassion\u201d would object to the light sentences, the 95-year-old judge told The Associated Press.\n\n\u201cAs I\u2019ve been here longer,\u201d Cohn said, \u201cI\u2019ve come to the realization that the rules are flexible \u2014 at least to me.\u201d\n\nThe Detroit area is believed to have the highest U.S. population of Yemenis, a demographic that has risen amid war in Yemen that has killed tens of thousands of people and left millions more with food and health care shortages.\n\nMoney sent from abroad is critical. The World Bank estimates that Yemenis received at least $3.3 billion in 2018, a figure some experts consider conservative. Cash from expatriates is \u201chugely important\u201d and remains a \u201cmainstay for many households and the national economy,\u201d said Sheila Carapico, a professor of global studies at the University of Richmond in Virginia.\n\nSince 2018, federal prosecutors in Detroit have charged nine people in an investigation of cash transfers to Yemen. Bank accounts were opened in the names of shell businesses, then used to deposit and wire roughly $90 million over a seven-year period, according to plea agreements filed in court.\n\n\u201cMuch of the currency originated from bodegas in New York City and from businesses and individuals in the metro Detroit area and was sent in a manner to conceal the true ownership of the currency, place it outside reach of law enforcement and evade income taxes,\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney Timothy Wyse said.\n\nThe \u201cevil\u201d is the lack of records to precisely track the cash, he said.\n\nAll nine men have pleaded guilty to failing to register money transfer businesses or making false statements to agents. One, Fahd Samaha, said he charged people only 1%, much less than typical financial service providers. The government said he moved $13 million to Yemen.\n\n\u201cThere were no victims. \u2026 He used the extra money to live and take care of his family,\u201d said Samaha\u2019s attorney, Jalal Dallo.\n\nThe cases were assigned to Cohn, who has been a federal judge since 1979. During a September hearing, he described the conditions in Yemen as \u201chorrendous\u201d and noted that sending men to prison can cause hardship in conservative Muslim families where wives often don\u2019t work outside the home.\n\nIt\u2019s unfair to \u201cshed the traditions and practices of your homeland,\u201d Cohn told Hazem Saleh, who possibly faced five years in custody for handling $22.6 million.\n\nJudges don\u2019t have to follow sentencing guidelines, and Cohn rejected prison terms. He placed Saleh and five others on supervised release, a form of probation. Three others await sentencing.\n\n\u201cPlease look at me as you would look at your own son,\u201d Ahmed Al-Howshabi told the judge in July. \u201cI can truthfully say I did not understand the laws and regulations of operating such a business.\u201d\n\nProsecutors said they had no evidence the scheme was anything more than sending money to relatives and possibly avoiding taxes, but they believed sentences within the guidelines were appropriate.\n\n\u201cSometimes judges agree with us and sometimes they don\u2019t,\u201d U.S. Attorney Matthew Schneider told the AP.\n\nDefense attorney William Swor, whose grandparents emigrated from Syria, said people of Arab descent appear to be under greater scrutiny than others in the U.S.\n\n\u201cIn the post-9/11 world, the government says it wants to know who\u2019s transferring money out of the country. We\u2019ll assume that\u2019s a legitimate concern, but it\u2019s not inherently a dangerous activity,\u201d Swor said.\n\n___\n\nFollow Ed White at http://twitter.com/edwhiteap", "description": "DETROIT (AP) \u2014 A group of Detroit-area men opened bank accounts to move millions of dollars to Yemen, their war-torn native country.
