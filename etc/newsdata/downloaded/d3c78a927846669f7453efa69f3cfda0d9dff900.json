In addition to models with standard Japanese features like bidets and \u201csound princess\u201d modes, the company has also created an ultra-luxurious toilet that costs $11,000 and produces a \u201c360-degree tornado flush.\u201d\n\nBut even we were surprised when we heard that Toto is now selling edible toilets, in miniature, chocolate form.\n\nTo get our hands, and mouths, on them, we took a trip to the Toto toilet museum in the city of Kitakyushu, Fukuoka Prefecture (the same facility Conan O\u2019Brien visited while he was in Japan). Like most museums, it\u2019s got a gift shop, and that\u2019s where we got our package of Toilette Chocolat.\n\nToilette Chocolat actually made its debut back in February. A creation of local chocolatier Gran da Zur, it was such a hit with Valentine\u2019s Day shoppers that they were completely sold out of their initial stock by the end of March, and it\u2019s only now that they\u2019ve got a new batch ready and shipped. In addition to the Toto Museum, you can also find them at some Kitakyushu souvenir shops.\n\nFor 756 yen, you get five chocolates inside a toilet-shaped box, complete with a functioning lid. While you might be expecting them to be a deep brown, they\u2019re actually made of white chocolate, in order to visually represent the pristine porcelain of a brand-new Toto toilet bowl.\n\nAs we unwrapped one, we were struck by how intricate the detailing is. Not only is the shape of the bowl accurately reproduced, the seat and tank are separately molded.\n\nAs for the flavor, Toilette Chocolat is as rich, milky, and sweetly delicious as you\u2019d expect from a mouthful of white chocolate. Considering that many people will be choosing to buy these based on their appearance alone, it\u2019s a sign of Toto and Gran da Zur\u2019s commitment to quality that they actually went to the trouble to make sure that they\u2019d taste good enough to justify eating even without their unusual, giggle-inducing aesthetics.\n\nReally, they\u2019re so good that now we sort of want an upgraded dual-flavor version with a creamy milk chocolate filling for the bowl, because as gross as that would look, it would taste great.\n\nRelated: Toto Museum\n\nRead more stories from SoraNews24.\n\n-- What happened when Conan O\u2019Brien visited the Toto Japanese toilet showroom in Tokyo \u3010Video\u3011\n\n-- Japanese spray toilets receive new standardised symbols to help foreign tourists\n\n-- World\u2019s largest toilet manufacturer lets you assemble your very own miniature paper toilet\n\nExternal Link\n\nhttps://soranews24.com/2019/10/08/japans-chocolate-toilets-are-disturbingly-delicious%E3%80%90photos%E3%80%91/\n\n\u00a9 SoraNews24", "description": "Japanese toilets have achieved international fame for their advanced design and functionality, and Toto sits at the forefront of the country\u2019s commode community.
