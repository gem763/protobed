Teitler told People exclusively. \"Our client will make no further statements.\"\n\nSEE ALSO: Matt Lauer denies rape allegation, says affair was 'consensual'\n\nRoque, who shares three children -- son Jack, 18, daughter Romy, 16, and son Thijs, 12 -- hadn't said anything publicly since Lauer's November 2017 firing from the \"Today\" show following a complaint of sexual misconduct in the workplace and their subsequent headline-making divorce. They finalized their divorce in early September after 20 years of marriage.\n\nHer statement, published on Wednesday night, came after it was revealed that Lauer's former NBC News colleague, Brooke Nevils, who filed the initial complaint against him that resulted in his firing, had also accused him of raping her during their first sexual encounter at the 2014 Sochi Olympics.\n\nNevils' allegation comes in the form of an interview with Ronan Farrow in his upcoming book, \"Catch and Kill: Lies, Spies, and a Conspiracy to Protect Predators,\" first reported by Variety.\n\nNevils, who was working for Lauer's former \"Today\" co-anchor Meredith Vieira at the time, said that after taking six shots of vodka at their hotel bar, Lauer invited her back to his hotel room where he proceeded to allegedly force her into having anal sex with him, despite the fact that she says she \"declined several times.\"\n\nSEE ALSO: 'Today' anchors react to Matt Lauer rape allegation: Watch\n\n\"It was nonconsensual in the sense that I was too drunk to consent,\" she reportedly told Farrow. \"It was nonconsensual in that I said, multiple times, that I didn\u2019t want to have anal sex.\"\n\nShe told Farrow that she proceeded to have \"completely transactional\" sexual encounters with the then-\"Today\" co-anchor back in New York City. Nevils reportedly added that she finally came forward with her claims anonymously to NBC News after being urged to do so by Vieira.\n\nAfter her rape allegation was made public on Wednesday morning, Lauer released a lengthy open letter vehemently denying Nevils' story.\n\n\"In a new book, it is alleged that an extramarital, but consensual, sexual encounter I have previously admitted having, was in fact an assault. It is categorically false, ignores the facts, and defies common sense,\" Lauer wrote. \"I had an extramarital affair with Brooke Nevils in 2014. It began when she came to my hotel room very late one night in Sochi, Russia. We engaged in a variety of sexual acts. We performed oral sex on each other, we had vaginal sex, and we had anal sex. Each act was mutual and completely consensual.\"\n\nSEE ALSO: Matt Lauer's accuser Brooke Nevils thanks her supporters\n\nFor their part, NBC News called Lauer's conduct \"appalling, horrific and reprehensible,\" reminding the public that they terminated him \"within 24 hours\" of \"first learning of the complaint\" from Nevils which, at the time, didn't include her allegation of rape.\n\nNevils went on medical leave the next year and was reportedly paid a seven-figure settlement.", "description": "Annette Roque released a statement amid a new rape allegation brought against her ex-husband, Matt Lauer.", "authors": ["Gibson Johns"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/dKqwFiRkKLODuQOL095oKg--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMDI4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/crop/1621x1062+235+90/resize/1028x675!/format/jpg/quality/85/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-10/69ad9a80-eb65-11e9-a3df-38719ec92432", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
