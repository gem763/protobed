Whether your lingerie drawer is home to 10 identical pairs of black briefs, a trusty T-shirt bra and a tangle of tights, or so much satin it looks like Dita VT\u2019s dressing up box, what if we told you you could give it an easy overhaul by adding just five pieces?\n\nRegardless of whether you wear them for yourself, or for someone else, here are the staples every woman should have in her collection. (Note to buyers: Lovehoney is currently offering 25% off when you buy 2 Lovehoney Lingerie styles. Click here for details.)\n\n#1 The Ultimate Matching Set\n\nThere\u2019s nothing like a matching set to make you feel like you\u2019ve got your life on track. Have a beautiful bra and briefs set on standby and you\u2019ll effortlessly nail that perfectly put-together lingerie look. Plus, you\u2019ll feel amazing knowing you\u2019re wearing sexy lingerie under your clothes.\n\nFrom provocative peek-a-boo cups to longline, retro styles and cleavage-boosting push-up bras, there are endless styles to choose from, not to mention a material for every mood.\n\nLovehoney recommends: Parisienne Black Plunge Longline Bra and Crotchless Thong Set ($64.95)\n\n#2 Game-Changing Legwear\n\nLike good accessories transform an outfit, stockings complete a lingerie set for top-to-toe sexiness.\n\nThere are two styles of stockings to choose from: hold-ups, which stay in place thanks to elasticated tops or silicone strips, and stockings which require a suspender belt or straps to stay up, so you don\u2019t end up with them around your ankles.\n\nWhether you opt for classic nylons, flirty fishnet, vintage-style back-seams or even wet look, stockings are an easy, inexpensive finishing touch. And for those who can\u2019t resist a life hack, suspender tights give you the look of stockings and suspender belt in one easy garment.\n\nLovehoney recommends: Sheer Black Lace Top Thigh High Stockings ($9.95)\n\n#3 Look-At-Me Loungewear\n\nIf \u2018slipping into something a little more comfortable\u2019 means reaching for your PJs or the band T-shirt you\u2019ve slept in since your teens, you need to add a babydoll to your bedwear collection.\n\nWith cups and a full, floaty skirt, a babydoll is a playful and provocative piece of lingerie that flares out from under the bust, skimming over your curves and finishing high on the thigh \u2013 like a naughty nightie. Plus, its less restrictive style means you can roll around the bed (or wherever you happen to be) without a care.\n\nThat fluffy, cocoon-like bathrobe may be super cosy and comforting, but an alluring alternative will give you instant sex kitten credentials when you\u2019re lounging around the house. Choose something light, airy and transparent that you can throw on over your lingerie, or wear when you want a little extra coverage.\n\nLovehoney recommends: Flaunt Me Floral Lace Robe ($34.95)\n\n#4 Effortless All-in-One\n\nWant to create a luscious lingerie look without the fuss, or the frantic rummage for a matching set while your date waits in the next room? Bodies, teddies and playsuits are all-in-one lingerie solutions incorporating a camisole and briefs, and many are crotchless, so you don\u2019t even have to take them off when things get heated.\n\nWant something even slinkier? Wrap your whole body in sheer lace or fishnet with a bodystocking. Just like stockings for your legs, these stretch-to-fit garments fit and flatter your curves, smoothing any imperfections to leave you feeling flawless.\n\nLovehoney recommends: Barely There Sheer Black Crotchless Teddy ($44.95)\n\n#5 Something Showstopping\n\nAnd finally, whether you\u2019re paired up or otherwise, a breathtakingly sexy piece of lingerie will make you feel like a goddess.\n\nA beautiful satin and lace basque that accentuates the parts you love most about yourself, a bustier that puts your silhouette in the spotlight or a classic boned corset that boosts your boobs to a breathtaking degree \u2013 whatever you opt for, parading around in showstopping lingerie can boost your self confidence and leave a lucky admirer\u2019s jaw on the floor.\n\nLovehoney recommends: Moonlight Black Plunge Basque Set ( $69.95 $29.99)\n\nCecile Sharp is a blogger and sex toy expert who writes for Lovehoney Australia.
