The benchmark 10-year JGB futures fell 0.04 point to 154.26, on course for its six consecutive day of losses.\n\nThe three-month overnight index swap rate has risen back to around minus 0.125% compared to a low of minus 0.145% earlier this month.\n\nThe OIS markets have now priced out a serious chance of an interest rate cut at the BOJ's policy announcement on Oct. 30, analysts said.\n\nEarlier this month, markets had almost fully priced in a 10 basis point cut.
