Be brave and be bold\n\nBe brave and bold when it comes your wallpaper.

Thoughtful design\n\nIt's important to thoughtfully curate the furniture pieces in your interiors to ensure guests feel at home.\n\nSmaller details must also be carefully considered to make for a more memorable stay.\n\nAdding accessories as an extra layer - such as cookbooks, record players or locally-made crafts - can be a nice way to add elements of culture and discovery to the home.\n\nSome of the homes on Airbnb have been thrown together with a 'get the job done' attitude.\n\nWhen scrolling through homestay platforms it's glaringly obvious which properties have been crafted with a little more love, and designed with the guest in mind.\n\nIt needn't cost a lot to make the property a little more special and ultimately create an unforgettable experience for guests.\n\nAdd some accessories as an extra layer - such as a drinks trolley, record player and champagne glasses\n\nAccessories can be a nice way to add elements of culture and discovery to the home\n\nIt needn't cost much to make the property a little more special, according to Hostmaker\n\n3.

Enhance a small space\n\nIn smaller spaces, try something more creative. Painting the ceiling is an easy way to enhance small rooms, adding more colour and depth to the space.\n\nIn bedrooms, use dark tones to create an ambience.\n\n5. Lighting\n\nLighting really is the most important aspect for me. It has the ability to change moods.\n\nHanging pendants or statement lighting always completes a tailor-made look and glass is a nice option for something a little more special.\n\nChoose warm bulbs for bedside lamps, or a reading light, as this is more relaxing for guests.\n\nStatement lighting always completes a tailor-made look for your airbnb property\n\n6. Window dressing\n\nDepending on your budget, try not to use roller blinds. Heavier curtains work really well and are an important detail that adds warmth to a room - which is vital in the winter months.\n\nGuests require privacy so adding sheer curtains can add an extra layer of security which many may appreciate.\n\nIt's also worth considering blackout blinds or curtains for a quality night's sleep.\n\n7. Sleep easy\n\nInvest in the best mattress you can. I'd recommend memory foam as this works really well for the majority of guests.\n\nDon't forget that a good night's sleep means happy guests and positive reviews.\n\nLayer up textiles to make the bed a really inviting, luxurious space for guests\n\nPlump plenty of cushions and drape two throws across the end of the bed\n\n8. Dress the bed\n\nLayer up textiles to make the bed a really inviting, luxurious space for guests. Plump plenty of cushions and drape two throws across the end of the bed.\n\nIf the room uses dark paint, embrace this theme and choose a similar colour of bedlinen.\n\nAlways use a high quality of linen to ensure you're recreating the luxury hotel feel.\n\nMake it Instagramable by hanging unique items on the walls, such as a circular mirror\n\nUse a mixture of statement, more expensive pieces of furniture with second-hand items\n\n9. Mix up the furniture\n\nUse a mixture of statement, more expensive pieces of furniture with second-hand, unique items.\n\nMixing up styles is great as this will give your property a boutique hotel aesthetic and will help to inject personality into the space.\n\nIt can tend to be rather bland if you use the same furniture set throughout.\n\n10. Make it 'Instagrammable'\n\nHave fun and hang unique items on the walls to further the boutique style aesthetic.\n\nIt might be a stag's head, an interestingly designed shelving unit or hanging a bike on the wall.\n\nIt gives the room a focus and of course, creates the whole experience highly 'Instagrammable.'", "description": "These interior design tips can bring a five-star hotel level of luxury to a home, and increase the level of bookings you obtain on Airbnb.", "authors": ["Myra Butterworth For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/16/15/5093466-0-image-a-27_1539699316881.jpg", "published_at": "2018-10-19"}
