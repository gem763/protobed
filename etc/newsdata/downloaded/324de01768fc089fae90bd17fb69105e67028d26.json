She did what she had to do under hands and heels in the Eclipse Stakes. Then in the King George it was hands and heels with one flick of the stick and holding on by a neck all the way up the straight.\n\n\u2018It was the same hands and heels in the Yorkshire Oaks against brilliant filly Magical. It\u2019s like winning on points without going for the knockout. As they get older they get a little wiser.\n\nLegendart jockey Frankie Dettori will be on board Enable in the Qatar Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp\n\n\u2018Enable has learned to reserve her energy a little more. The great old trainers will always tell you the thoroughbred racehorse is at its peak at five. They are finally getting all their teeth at four! They still have to continue loving their trade and she does \u2014 she really enjoys it.\u2019\n\nDettori made it 17 Group One wins for season \u2014 beating his previous best tally of 16 in 2001 \u2014 on Gosden\u2019s Anapurna in the Prix Royallieu yesterday. It was heavy ground, but the Arc will be run on virgin turf and Dettori brushed away concerns.\n\nHe said: \u2018It is very soft but it is a different course tomorrow and she coped with soft to win the King George in July and at the Breeders\u2019 Cup last year.\u2019\n\nGosden has tried hard to keep a lid on expectation but admits a win will fully justify Enable\u2019s name being mentioned alongside the great fillies like Allez France, Petit Etoile and Zenyatta.\n\nFrankie Dettori celebrates with Enable after winning the Qatar Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in Paris last year\n\nIn truth, she has probably done enough already. It seems a long way from winning on her debut at Newcastle on a murky November day in 2016 and even the Epsom afternoon when she announced her potential to the world with a win in the Oaks run during a thunderstorm.\n\nGosden added: \u2018When she first arrived the one thing I noticed was the great depth of her girth. She had an amazing body and it was there, this great rib cage \u2014 space for the cardiovascular system plus the lung capacity.\n\n\u2018She has a great stride and a lovely attitude. She moves gracefully. You can combine that with her mental attitude with her physiology you have a great athlete.\u2019 Eight horses have won the Arc twice but none has made it three in a row dating back to 1920. When Treve tried in 2015 she was fourth to the Gosdentrained, Dettori-ridden Golden Horn.\n\nExpectations were equally high. Treve started evens favourite, Enable is odds on.\n\nIt shows nothing can be taken for granted but Enable\u2019s preparation is in stark contrast to the interrupted build-up to last year\u2019s narrow defeat of sadly deceased Sea Of Class.\n\nGosden said: \u2018She gave everything that day. Frankie picked her up and carried her over the line in the last 50 yards.\n\n\u2018I think the quality (opposition) is there again. Ghaiyyath is a relentless galloper. I see him as a real danger and think Waldgeist is underestimated. She will have to be right at the top of her game.", "description": "Trainer John Gosden reckons his wonder horse Enable is 'in the zone' after near-perfect preparation for a bid for a third Arc de Triomphe on Sunday.", "authors": ["Marcus Townend For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/22/19343742-0-image-a-80_1570311138105.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
