He performed his duty to shareholders, the board, and the public by reporting these issues internally, expecting that Juul\u2019s senior management would do the right thing,\u201d his attorney, Harmeet Dhillon, said in an emailed statement to The Post. \u201cInstead, Juul fired him under concocted, false pretenses, and then sought to smear him to justify its misconduct.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJuul is already facing scores of lawsuits and federal scrutiny stemming from allegations it created a youth vaping epidemic. Meanwhile, medical officials are scrambling to unravel a rash of lung illnesses tied to vaping devices that have sickened more than 1,600 users and caused 34 deaths, according to the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Although many of the cases have been linked to black market THC products, public health officials have not ruled out nicotine-based e-cigarettes as a culprit. The panic has caused seven states and several cities, including San Francisco, where Juul is headquartered, to restrict e-cigarettes to various degrees.\n\nThe new lawsuit, first reported by BuzzFeed, comes as Juul announced the layoffs of 500 employees, among them a handful of executives, including chief financial officer Tim Danaher. In a statement to The Post, the company said Breja\u2019s lawsuit and allegations about the contaminated pods were \u201cbaseless.\"\n\n\u201cHe was terminated in March 2019 because he failed to demonstrate the leadership qualities needed in his role,\u201d Juul said in the statement. \u201cThe allegations concerning safety issues with Juul products are equally meritless, and we already investigated the underlying manufacturing issue and determined the product met all applicable specifications. The company will vigorously defend this lawsuit.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBreja, who had been at Uber before joining Juul in May 2018, said he learned about the contaminated pods during an executive meeting on March 12. Breja was asked to recover $7 million from the supplier, Alternative Ingredients, for the bad pods, court documents show.\n\n\u201cThis hypocritical approach of not informing the customers about the contamination on one hand (claiming it was not a serious issue) and charging the supplier for it on the other hand, further concerned Mr. Breja,\u201d the complaint said.\n\nWhen Breja protested, the suit alleged, his supervisor, Danaher, warned that either option would cost the company billions in sales, lead to a \u201csignificant reduction\u201d in Juul\u2019s $38 billion valuation at the time and damage the brand\u2019s reputation, according to the complaint.\n\nAD\n\nTen days after the meeting, the suit said, Breja was fired. He was told he was terminated because he had misrepresented himself as having been CFO at Uber, rather than of a division of the ride-sharing company. Breja denies this, and said he was not permitted to take notes during the termination conversation, according to the complaint.\n\nAD\n\nBreja said he also had pressed the company over its refusal to include a \u201cbest by\u201d or manufacturing date on its products. The complaint said that stemmed from Juul\u2019s plan to resell older inventory that had been returned by distributors. Juul\u2019s advertising says pods lose flavor after about a year.\n\nBut then-chief executive Kevin Burns allegedly dismissed those concerns. \u201cHalf our customers are drunk and vaping \u2026\u201d he said, according to the complaint. \u201cWho \u2026 is going to notice the quality of our pods?\u201d\n\nBurns stepped down as CEO in September, and has since been replaced by K.C. Crosthwaite, a former executive with Altria. The tobacco giant invested $12.8 billion in Juul in December 2018, for a 35 percent stake in the company.\n\nAD", "description": "Siddharth Breja, who had been vice president of global finance for the embattled e-cigarette maker, claims he was \u201cinappropriately terminated\u201d in March.", "authors": ["Taylor Telford", "Reporter Covering National", "Breaking News"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/kF6woji4H8i4DPJ1aj6QRlO95oU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5X2RAHXRCYI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
