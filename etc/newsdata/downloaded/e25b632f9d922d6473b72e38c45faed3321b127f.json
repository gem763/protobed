John Yoo, who worked in the White House Counsel\u2019s Office under George W. Bush , agreed with Ms. Ingraham that the situation was \u201castounding,\u201d adding, \u201csome people might call that espionage.\u201d\n\nBrian Kilmeade, who hosts Fox & Friends, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s favorite shows, said Tuesday morning of Colonel Vindman: \u201cWe also know he was born in the Soviet Union, emigrated with his family. Young. He tends to feel simpatico with the Ukraine.\u201d\n\nSean P. Duffy, a former Republican representative from Wisconsin and pro-Trump commentator, also questioned Colonel Vindman\u2019s loyalties, saying Tuesday during an appearance on CNN: \u201cIt seems very clear that he is incredibly concerned about Ukrainian defense \u2014 I don\u2019t know that he\u2019s concerned about American policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all have an affinity to our homeland where we came from,\u201d Mr. Duffy added.\n\nLater on Twitter, Mr. Duffy appeared to walk back his remarks, praising Colonel Vindman\u2019s service.\n\n\u201cLt. Col. Vindman is an American war hero,\u201d he wrote, adding, \u201cMy point is that Mr. Vindman is an unelected advisor, he gives ADVICE. President Trump sets the policy.\u201d", "description": "The first current White House official appeared on Capitol Hill to testify to lawmakers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/29/us/politics/29dc-impeachbriefing-sub/29dc-impeachbriefing-sub-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
