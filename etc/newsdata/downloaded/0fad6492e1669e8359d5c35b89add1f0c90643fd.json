It is building a plant in China's central city of Wuhan to make Terrafugia branded flying cars, company documents show.\n\nGeely bought a 9.7% stake in Daimler in 2018. The companies have said they plan to build the next generation of Smart electric cars in China through a joint venture. They also plan to form a premium ride-hailing joint venture in China.", "description": "Geely to bring air taxis to China in tie-up with Daimler-backed Volocopter", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXNPEF880BT_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
