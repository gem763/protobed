The stock, which has a one-year return of about 45%, yields 1.7%.\n\nAnother company that Markit expects to announce a dividend increase is Merck (MRK), a large pharmaceutical firm. The stock, which yields 2.7%, has a one-year return of about 20%.\n\nMarkit forecasts that it will raise the quarterly payout by nearly 15% to 63 cents a share. It\u2019s now at 55 cents a share.\n\nThe company has been consistent in increasing its dividend in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year and maintaining the same dividend for four straight quarters, according to a Markit research note. It added that the higher dividend would be in line with the payout ratio the company has targeted of 47% to 50%.\n\nLast year Merck\u2019s payout ratio\u2014the percentage of earnings paid out as dividends\u2014was 44%.\n\nElsewhere, Cintas (CTAS), which rents and sells corporate uniforms, is expected to raise its dividend by nearly 20% to $2.45 a share, according to Markit analyst Paige Anderson.\n\nAnderson noted in part that \u201cthe solid growth the company is experiencing makes for a strong case to increase dividends in line with the payout ratio and dividend growth rates.\u201d\n\nIn its most recent fiscal year, the company\u2019s payout ratio was about 27%. Last year, the company\u2019s board declared a dividend of $2.05 a share, up 27% from $1.62.\n\nThe stock yields 0.8%, and it\u2019s one-year return is about 60%.\n\nWrite to Lawrence C.
