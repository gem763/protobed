As recently as October 2015, a traffic citation for Ofelia listed Epstein\u2019s estate as her place of residence.\n\nOfelia found long-term employment working for Ivana Trump until the socialite sold her Palm Beach home in 2014. That year, Ofelia\u2019s 25-year-old daughter, a law student at Columbia University, landed a summer job with Ivana, too. (An online r\u00e9sum\u00e9 for the daughter, which was found on the website sydex.net, includes a job with \u201cMrs. Ivana Trump\u201d from May 2014 to July 2014.)\n\nGary Lyman, a lawyer for Ivana, told The Daily Beast that the student, who is from Romania, was tasked with helping Ivana pack her things for the move.\n\n\u201cThe connection was the mom\u2014her mom worked for Ivana,\u201d Lyman said, adding that Ofelia\u2019s \u201chusband was the guy who worked for Epstein.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if Epstein played a role in Ofelia\u2019s employment with the Trumps . Ivana declined to answer further questions left with Lyman, and Ofelia and Banasiak declined to comment.\n\nStill, the ties between the Trumps and Epstein run deep. (As The Daily Beast reported, Epstein was also linked to former President Clinton and his family, visiting the White House and donating to the Clinton Foundation.)\n\nIvana Trump's name was registered in Epstein\u2019s infamous Little Black Book, which also contains numbers for President Trump and daughter Ivanka, now-first lady Melania, and Trump\u2019s younger brother, Robert, and his ex-wife Blaine.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy,\u201d Trump told New York in 2002. \u201cHe\u2019s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it\u2014Jeffrey enjoys his social life.\u201d\n\nIn the 1980s and \u201990s, Trump and Epstein enjoyed that social life together until, as Trump claims, they had a falling-out. \u201cThe reason doesn\u2019t make any difference, frankly,\u201d Trump told reporters, days after Epstein\u2019s arrest for child sex-trafficking. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t spoken to him in probably 15 years or more. I wasn\u2019t a big fan of Jeffrey Epstein, that I can tell you.\u201d\n\nEpstein\u2019s brother, Mark, has claimed Trump flew on Jeffrey\u2019s plane \u201cnumerous times\u201d and that the two \u201cwere good friends.\u201d According to another report, in 1992, Trump threw a \"calendar girl\" party at Mar-a-Lago solely for himself, Epstein and 28 young women.\n\nThe reality star often dropped in on the creepy financier's mansion, according to the 2009 deposition of former Epstein staffer Juan Alessi.\n\nTrump \u201cwould come, have dinner,\" Alessi testified as part of one victim's civil case against Epstein. \"He never sat at the table. He eat with me in the kitchen.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid he ever have massages while he was there?\u201d Katherine Ezell, a lawyer for the victim, asked Alessi of Trump.\n\n\u201cNo. Because he's got his own spa,\u201d Alessi answered.\n\n\u201c Trump 'would come, have dinner ... He never sat at the table. He [ate] with me in the kitchen.' \u201d\n\nTrump barred Epstein from Mar-a-Lago after Florida cops filed charges against him, one Trump Organization attorney told the Washington Post. Brad Edwards, an attorney for multiple Epstein victims, has also previously mentioned the supposed ban.\n\nIn a 2010 affidavit, Edwards said he intended to take Trump\u2019s deposition as he battled a lawsuit Epstein had filed against him. \u201cI learned through a source that Trump banned Epstein\u2026 because Epstein sexually assaulted an underage girl at the club,\u201d Edwards stated in the court filing.\n\nIn the same pleading, Edwards named Banasiak as one of several employees that Epstein paid attorneys to represent in the face of a federal criminal probe and stream of civil suits filed by victims.\n\nBanasiak, 66, started working for Epstein in February 2005\u2014one month before Palm Beach police launched their investigation into the perverted hedge-funder\u2019s sexual abuse of underage girls.\n\nThe butler said he entered Epstein's employ shortly after a Maryland staffing agency notified him of a job opening in Florida, according to a 2010 deposition taken in one victim's lawsuit.\n\nBanasiak\u2019s testimony took place during Epstein\u2019s house arrest, following the financier\u2019s 2008 conviction in Florida for soliciting minors for prostitution.\n\nA Polish national who moved to the U.S. in 1980, Banasiak said he previously worked for a Manhattan family and ran a conference center for the Seagram\u2019s beverage company.\n\nGhislaine Maxwell, Epstein's alleged madam, was the first to interview Banasiak for the job. In December 2004, Banasiak met Maxwell in her Manhattan apartment, before visiting with Epstein at his Madison Avenue office.\n\nBanasiak said he flew his belongings down to Florida on Epstein's private jet. And once he arrived in Palm Beach, he moved into a staff house on Epstein\u2019s waterfront property. (Property records indicate Banasiak purchased a $601,368 home in West Palm Beach in 2014.)\n\nAsked about the extent of Maxwell\u2019s and Epstein\u2019s relationship, Banasiak said, \u201cThey were like partners in business.\u201d\n\n\u201c I notice that those young women were coming for massage. And most of the time I opened the door for them and let them in. \u201d\n\n\u201cI don't know what kind of business but she was the one who organized I would say employment with this organization. So, whatever I need, if I have some kind of problem, I contact her,\u201d Banasiak testified. He said when Maxwell wasn\u2019t in Florida, he\u2019d phone her in New York for instructions instead of speaking to Epstein directly.\n\nBanasiak said he was told a few years later to report to Nadia Marcinkova\u2014one of Epstein\u2019s alleged co-conspirators who is accused of participat ing in sex with underage victims in Florida.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long into the butler\u2019s employment when he observed young women visiting the home. Epstein\u2019s assistants Sarah Kellen and Adriana Ross, two more alleged accomplices, told Banasiak what times girls would come over to give Epstein massages.\n\n\u201cI notice that those young women were coming for massage. And most of the time I opened the door for them and let them in,\u201d Banasiak testified.\n\nBanasiak said he didn\u2019t know there was anything illegal about Epstein\u2019s massages until police executed a search warrant in October 2005. \u201cBefore that I didn't know anything about what was going on beside the massage,\u201d he said, adding that he was \u201cshocked\u201d to see police at the mansion.\n\nA month or so before the search warrant, Ross came over with an unidentified man to haul three computers out of Epstein\u2019s home, Banasiak said.\n\nEpstein hired a lawyer for Banasiak, who was subpoenaed by the FBI.\n\nBanasiak said he was concerned about the charges against Epstein but it didn\u2019t impact his future employment because he believed Epstein didn\u2019t realize his victims were minors.\n\n\u201cI assume he didn't know\u2026. the age of those girls,\u201d the butler said.\n\nHe said his duties involved running errands, buying groceries and flowers and collecting cash from the bank, so that he always had $2,000 on hand.\n\nHe answered the door for the young women and led them inside and sometimes paid them after the massages were over. On other occasions, he said, Ross or Kellen would call while Epstein was gone and inform Banasiak a girl was coming over to collect money.\n\nWhen Epstein was on \u201cwork release,\u201d Banasiak said, he gave the inmate rides to the Florida Science Foundation and back to jail.\n\nAt one point, Banasiak said, he rented a vehicle in his own name for one young masseuse at the behest of Kellen. Authorities later identified this woman as one of Epstein\u2019s victims.\n\n\u201c Given that you observed these young females and different females coming to the house, with great frequency, at some point \u2026 did you ever think, hey, this is unusual, this is unusual behavior? \u201d\n\nBanasiak also said modeling agent Jean-Luc Brunel would stay at the home and was comfortable enough to cook in Epstein\u2019s kitchen and swim in his pool, and that sometimes he\u2019d give Brunel rides to and from the airport.\n\nWhen attorney Brad Edwards asked, \u201cGiven that you observed these young females and different females coming to the house, with great frequency, at some point\u2026 did you ever think, hey, this is unusual, this is unusual behavior?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you know, I didn\u2019t question anything. It\u2019s not my job,\u201d Banasiak replied.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not your job?\u201d Edwards asked.\n\n\u201cNot my job,\u201d Banasiak said, adding, \u201cI just do my job\u201d and when someone \u201cshows up\u201d to Epstein\u2019s home it\u2019s \u201cnot to [sic] me to question.\u201d\n\nOn LinkedIn, Banasiak says he\u2019s the \u201cproperty manager\u201d for Neptune LLC, a company associated with Epstein. (That Virgin Islands company was one of several Epstein corporations that donated $5,200 to New Mexico gubernatorial candidate Gary King.)\n\nMarriage records show he wed Ofelia, his second wife, in August 2011.\n\nWhile he purchased a West Palm Beach home with her in 2014, his stepdaughter's listed address in public records is Epstein's El Brillo Way residence.\n\nEarlier this year, the step daughter was sued for a car accident that occurred in Palm Beach County in March 2015. Janusz Banasiak, as owner of the vehicle his stepdaughter was driving, is also named as a defendant in the lawsuit.\n\nA summons in the case, addressed to the young woman, names her place of residence as Epstein\u2019s El Brillo Way mansion. (A crash report from the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles also lists the woman\u2019s address at Epstein\u2019s home.)\n\n\u201c Throughout the month of July, Ofelia posted scenic photos of Gunnison, Colorado, where Epstein's close friends Glenn and Eva Dubin own a ranch. \u201d\n\nAccording to court filings, the plaintiff's lawyers had trouble locating Banasiak to serve the suit, which is pending. \u201cPlaintiff has made a diligent search, on multiple dates and at multiple addresses, to serve Banasiak, but has been unable to do so,\u201d one August 2019 pleading stated. \u201cPlaintiff has a good-faith reason to believe that Banasiak is evading service.\u201d\n\nWhile Banasiak has no other public social media presence, his wife and stepdaughter have frequently posted photos of their travels together, including jaunts to Paris, St. Tropez and the Hamptons this summer.\n\nOfelia's daughter has also posted Instagram photos of herself at a Trump World Tower apartment in 2016 and at The World Bar at the high-rise in 2018.\n\nOn July 4, two days before Epstein\u2019s arrest, Ofelia shared a video of the Rocky Mountains from a plane. Throughout the month of July, Ofelia posted scenic photos of Gunnison, Colorado, where Epstein's close friends Glenn and Eva Dubin own a ranch.\n\nThe Dubins\u2019 longtime chef, Emily Womac, commented with a heart emoji on Ofelia's July 21 photo at the Ouray Hot Springs, and Ofelia responded in kind.\n\nWomac, who declined to comment when reached by The Daily Beast, was also sharing photos of her meals made with Colorado produce.\n\nThe Dubin family declined to comment on whether they know Ofelia and if she works for them, or why she might have been posting from what appeared to be their private ranch .", "description": "Jeffrey Epstein and President Trump\u2019s first ex-wife moved in the same glittering Palm Beach social circles\u2014and hired members of the same family as employees.", "authors": ["Kate Briquelet", "Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571000351/191013-shugerman-ivana-epstein-tease_hhumsa", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
