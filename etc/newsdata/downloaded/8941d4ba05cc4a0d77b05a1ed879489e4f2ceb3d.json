The Maryland graduate known for the last-second three-pointer that forced overtime in the 2006 NCAA tournament championship game that the Terps went on to win is now one victory away from her second WNBA title; she also won one with the Los Angeles Sparks in 2016.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGame 4 is Tuesday in Connecticut.\n\nTo her coaches and teammates, it was obvious that Toliver had an explosive Game 3 coming. The guard is the most visibly intense player on Washington\u2019s roster. A similar competitive fire burns in Elena Delle Donne, but her face is often a blank mask on the court.\n\nToliver, on the other hand, curses and slaps the floor when she misses a shot. She claps and stomps after a turnover. She's the player most likely to get a technical foul for arguing with officials.\n\nIn the days after Game 2, when the Mystics didn\u2019t know whether Delle Donne would be able to play in Game 3 because of a herniated disk that is pinching a nerve in her back, Toliver was mainly just quiet. The reason she left Los Angeles the year after winning a title was that she wanted to bring a championship to a franchise that had never won one, to help build something from the ground up. Now that she\u2019s a game away, her focus is palpable.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOh, she\u2019s wired. I\u2019ll walk up to her randomly like, \u2018Panda, you okay?\u2019 \u201d Tianna Hawkins said, using the team\u2019s nickname for Toliver. \u201cShe\u2019s focused right now. We know to keep our distance from Kristi and let Kristi be Kristi.\u201d\n\nSaid Mystics Coach-General Manager Mike Thibault: \u201cYou could feel a big game coming. You could just sense that her body was starting to feel a little bit better, at least on the offensive end, she could get going and at least make some threes. \u2026 Her will to play, you know, like, to compete at the highest level, rubs off a little bit. It doesn\u2019t even just have to be verbal stuff. You can just tell that she\u2019s locked in.\u201d\n\nToliver\u2019s leadership style is more nonverbal than that of, say, starting guard Natasha Cloud. But Toliver\u2019s particularly steely disposition during the WNBA Finals is something her teammates have noted.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nToliver is the only player in the series who has won a WNBA title. Delle Donne said Monday that one of the biggest lessons Toliver has imparted is the importance of attention to detail during a championship run. She noted that Toliver watches video of each game on her own at night and will come to practice the next day with a fresh scouting report \u2014 usually a task reserved for the coaching staff. That intense studying means Toliver knows not only exactly where her teammates are going to be but how Connecticut\u2019s defense probably will react. That leads to 10 assists in a game.\n\n\u201cHer IQ is just a lot higher than most,\u201d Delle Donne said. \u201c\u2026 Her focus has been key, and it\u2019s going to continue to be. She\u2019s just one of those people: When the moment gets bigger, she gets better.\u201d\n\nToliver\u2019s timing in conducting the offense was on full display Sunday. Washington had 20 assists on 34 field goals and shot 50.7 percent in part because players delivered the ball to the right place at the right time.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSun Coach Curt Miller wasn\u2019t surprised by Toliver\u2019s performance; he has seen her take command in games plenty of times. He was an assistant coach under Brian Agler in Los Angeles when Toliver was on the team in 2015.\n\nMiller\u2019s first memory of Toliver was in her first game of the season that year, when she joined the team after the season had begun after playing overseas.\n\n\u201cKristi arrived and joined us on the road on game day and did not practice and I think went out and maybe had 33 points?\u201d Miller said. (It actually was 30.) \u201c. . . And it was a brand new coach in Brian Agler. So she did not have a practice in the system that we were running.\n\n\u201cShe understands basketball. It\u2019s why she\u2019s a coach in her other life, why she\u2019s going to be a great coach, and then she\u2019s got a demeanor you just love. She doesn\u2019t get sped up. She isn\u2019t overly emotional, plays not with a lot of emotion unless she\u2019s complaining about fouls. She\u2019s a true professional, and it was a pleasure to work with someone like that when I just got in the league.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDuring these WNBA Finals, Toliver will remind her teammates of little details before each game and dole out tips before the Mystics run out onto the court. But in her opinion, the time for big speeches has passed.\n\n\u201cI think the best way for me, in this moment, is to show them,\u201d Toliver said. \u201cI want to play at a championship level, because I think the best way to lead is by example. That\u2019s my job.\u201d\n\nRead more Mystics coverage from Post Sports:\n\nAD", "description": "The only player on either roster who has won a WNBA championship, she had a double-double in Sunday's pivotal Game 3.", "authors": ["Ava Wallace", "Reporter Covering Local Colleges"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/CT6-0dH21FaCRIdVIR7J7h2qjV8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/62VD3MXJH4I6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
