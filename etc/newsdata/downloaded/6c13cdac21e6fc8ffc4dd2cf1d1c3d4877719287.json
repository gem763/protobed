On Monday, after a White House announcement the night before that Mr. Trump was moving American troops out of the way of a threatened Turkish incursion into Syria, Defense Department officials were struggling to put their already piecemeal Syria military strategy back together again.\n\nIt will not be easy. Caught between furious Kurdish allies who see Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement as abandonment, an authoritarian Turkish leader who may take Mr. Trump\u2019s words as tacit permission to move against Kurds in northern Syria, and an American president who has made clear he wants out of the region, the Pentagon is approaching a junction that the military feared was coming for some time.\n\nThe Defense Department \u201cmade lemonade out of lemons\u201d the first time Mr. Trump announced a Syria withdrawal, said Derek Chollet, an assistant secretary of defense in the Obama administration. The Pentagon withdrew 1,000 of its 2,000 troops, moved some command elements to Iraq, and continued to aid Kurdish fighters still fighting the Islamic State and holding some 11,000 Islamic State prisoners of war.", "description": "The Pentagon is scrambling to respond to the words of a president who views Syria and the fight against ISIS as a battle largely won and done for American troops.", "authors": ["Helene Cooper", "Eric Schmitt"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/07/us/politics/07dc-military/07dc-military-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
