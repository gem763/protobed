Most would understand the illiquid nature of unlisted fixed assets and private equity, though few think carefully about the potential to earn an illiquidity premium or the full consequences of not having access to a pool of investments, possibly for some years. When things go wrong, there is no way out.\n\nIt's important for investors to consider other determinants of an equity manager than just performance. If a manager has large positions, it may struggle to realise those when conditions change. And the performance of a fund will change as it gets bigger as it can no longer trade as easily in and out of stocks and may not be able to invest in smaller companies as it cannot stick to its liquidity parameters\n\nThere has been enough said about the allocated weight industry super funds and the Future Fund have to illiquid assets. For these entities it makes absolute sense as they have a long-term horizon and can make a reasonable assessment of the liabilities they might experience as funds are withdrawn. There is unlikely to be an unexpected requirement to shift this money as beneficiaries are largely inactive. Another key feature of these assets is that the pricing is infrequent, giving an apparent sense of stability to any investment portfolio that might otherwise rattle the confidence of the fund members.\n\nWithin listed equities, liquidity is not an irrelevant issue. In an overarching sense, one of the problems of open and transparent market activity is that everyone can participate on the run. Selling or buying of listed stocks is fraught with emotive, tactical and algorithmic patterns that have little bearing on the value of equities.\n\nThere is therefore one key consideration. If circumstances were to change, would one resort to selling listed equities because it's possible rather than they should be sold? Selling is likely to make a major change to the asset allocation within a portfolio as the illiquid investments will appear not to have changed in value as they are not measured on a regular basis.\n\nIn the listed equity bucket, there are also complications. Big cap stocks trade frequently with a large degree of oversight. Down the scale, the pattern changes as stocks fall off the radar of research analysts, or there are other issues such as sticky shareholders including founders and proprietors.", "description": "Liquidity is a key issue for investors to understand - both when conditions change and a fund gets bigger.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7062%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_109/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/30f0bf87a9136e3f1d6a44199590958de8fe57a6", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
