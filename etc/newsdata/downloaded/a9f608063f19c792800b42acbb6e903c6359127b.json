(Susan Walsh/AP)\n\nNorth Korea is willing to hold talks with the United States later this month, its vice foreign minister said, but Washington needs to change its tune if the dialogue is to move ahead.\n\nThe comments came in a statement released late Monday in Pyongyang, a day after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also expressed hope for a resumption in the stop-start dialogue process.\n\n\u201cWe are willing to comprehensively talk through the issues we have discussed so far at an agreed time and place in late September,\u201d Choe Son Hui said in the statement, which was carried by the official Korean Central News Agency.\n\n\u201cI want to believe that the United States will come up with an alternative based on a calculation method that serves the interests of both sides and is acceptable to us,\u201d she said.\n\nIf the United States does not change its approach \u201cat the hard-earned working-level talks with North Korea,\u201d a deal between the two countries will not happen.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly insisted that North Korea can have a \u201cbright future\u201d if it surrenders its nuclear weapons. North Korea, in response, insists that it has no intention of unilaterally giving up its nuclear arsenal, which it says is necessary to deter external aggression and maintain peace on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nThat disagreement, and Trump\u2019s unwillingness to agree to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un\u2019s demands \u2014 the lifting of almost all meaningful sanctions on North Korea in return for a very partial rollback of Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear program \u2014 caused the breakdown of talks at their summit in Hanoi in February.\n\nIn April, Kim said he would give the United States until the end of the year to make a \u201cbold decision\u201d and change its approach to talks. Otherwise, he warned, he would be forced to seek a new path.\n\nNevertheless, Pompeo insists Kim has promised to denuclearize and said Sunday that the administration was \u201chopeful that in the coming days or perhaps weeks we\u2019ll be back at the negotiating table with them.\u201d\n\nTalks between the two sides were supposed to resume soon after the late June summit between Trump and Kim at the demilitarized zone between the two Koreas. But the promised \u201cworking-level\u201d dialogue never took place.\n\nInstead, North Korea continued to conduct tests of short-term ballistic missiles and complained bitterly about U.S.-South Korea military exercises as well as Seoul\u2019s weapons purchases.\n\nBut having made its point, Pyongyang appears finally ready to talk again.\n\nAlthough the ballistic missile tests violate U.N. Security Council resolutions, Pompeo told ABC News\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d that they did not violate the commitments Kim had made to Trump.\n\n\u201cI think President Trump would be very disappointed if Chairman Kim doesn\u2019t return to the negotiating table or conducts missile tests that are inconsistent with the agreements that they made when the two of them were together these three times,\u201d Pompeo said in an interview. The two leaders had also met in Singapore in June 2018.\n\nRead more:\n\nFast, low and hard to stop: North Korea\u2019s missile tests crank up the threat level\n\nNorth Korea spits out insults, launches missiles and rejects talks with South\n\nNorth Korean state media hails Trump-Kim meeting as victory for peace\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui warns, however, that Washington needs to change its approach for the negotiations to succeed.", "authors": ["Simon Denyer", "Tokyo Bureau Chief Covering Japan", "North Korea", "South Korea.", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ZkX7CDmVyhKDDRShgV4IYGiRMQ0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2T6MNPWQFEI6TDA4PSHOPBNYKU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
