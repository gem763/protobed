I\u2019d like to add I was being as discreet as possible and even wear layers to enable me to do this.\n\n\u2018I was the one that was left feeling extremely embarrassed and mortified. We promptly finished up and left.\u2019\n\n\u2018This is normally such a friendly welcoming place so I was extremely disappointed with this attitude, especially in this day and age,\u2019 she added.\n\nMs Truss said young mums \u2018need to realise there are other people around\u2019 and is conscious she has a lot of elderly customers coming into her caf\u00e9.\n\nShe said: \u2018I wouldn\u2019t have gone out of my way to upset or hurt her, that wasn\u2019t my intention.\n\nUnder the Equality Act a mother does not have to cover up if she doesn\u2019t want to (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018I was trying to look after all of my customers. Just because someone feels uncomfortable it doesn\u2019t mean they are nasty.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnder the Equality Act 2010, a business \u2018cannot discriminate against mothers who are breastfeeding a child of any age\u2019 and a mum doesn\u2019t have to cover up if she doesn\u2019t wish to.\n\nMs Truss said she didn\u2019t know it was \u2018against the law\u2019 and insisted she didn\u2019t mean to upset the mum.\n\nSince the incident, a number of people have taken to social media to condemn the cafe as \u2018not child friendly\u2019 and Ms Truss said she has received a \u2018nasty\u2019 backlash.\n\nShe said she would never ask someone to stop breastfeeding \u2013 but admits asking her to cover up to prevent an elderly customer feeling embarrassed, despite the man not saying anything about it.\n\nAcross Somerset, efforts are being made to make the county a welcoming place for breastfeeding, as it has been made a public health priority by Somerset County Council.\n\nOrganisers of Positive About Breastfeeding said people and businesses shouldn\u2019t be shamed and their scheme is about tackling misinformation around the subject.\n\nEmily Hutt, health promotion manager, said: \u2018By supporting the increase in breastfeeding prevalence, we are going some way to reduce inequalities experienced by some groups within the population.\n\n\u2018It is the right of the mother to choose how, and where to feed their baby. We would encourage everyone in Somerset to respect the choice of the mother/family and to be sensitive to the challenges they may be facing as a parent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018This may be with regards to infant feeding or anything that could present itself when transitioning into parenthood.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
