Goldman seconded that sentiment in a research note, estimating a 95 percent chance of a modest reduction during the meeting.\n\n\u201cStrong signaling from Fed leadership indicates that the modest trade war de-escalation since September has not deterred them from completing a 75bp, 1990s-style 'mid-cycle adjustment,'\" the note said.\n\nHowever, Goldman economists said they believe policymakers will tweak the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s post-meeting statement to make it slightly more hawkish \u2014 essentially paving the way to hold borrowing costs steady and putting an end to the series of cuts that began in July.\n\nThose changes include removing the phrase \u201cact as appropriate to sustain the expansion,\" a phrase interpreted by the market as a sign of an impending rate cut, and replacing it with a reference to recent easing and the less decisive \u201cwill act as needed to promote its objectives,\" which references the easing actions already taken.\n\nIn approving the previous cuts, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has cited uncertainty from the U.S.-China trade war, muted inflation and a slowdown in global growth. Since the Fed\u2019s most recent meeting in September, however, President Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping have moved closer toward striking a trade agreement. And, Goldman noted, mixed economic data has pushed back against the downside scenarios under discussion (in the U.S., unemployment dipped to a 50-year low last month).\n\nPlus, meeting minutes from September revealed policymakers were divided over whether to lower interest rates then. Those who voiced opposition to a second cut said the economy had not deteriorated since July, when the Fed cut rates for the first time in a decade.\n\nSeven of 10 members voted in favor of lowering rates, with three dissenting. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard supported a larger, half-percentage point cut; Kansas City Fed President Esther George and Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren, meanwhile, wanted to take no action. Goldman said it doesn't expect any other voting member to join George and Rosengren, who are expected to dissent again.\n\n\u201cPowell will have a \ufb01ne line to walk during the press conference if he hopes to satisfy market participants projecting additional easing as well as the critics of insurance cuts -- both on and off the committee,\u201d Goldman economist Spencer Hill wrote in the note. \u201cRe\ufb02ecting this, we expect a slightly hawkish tone, with Powell alluding to a baseline of unchanged policy but emphasizing data-dependence and the ability to respond quickly if the outlook deteriorates.\u201d\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has cited uncertainty from the U.S.-China trade war, muted inflation and a slowdown in global growth to justify previous cuts.", "authors": ["Megan Henney"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/Powell-4.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
