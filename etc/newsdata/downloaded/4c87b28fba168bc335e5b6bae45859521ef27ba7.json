Illustration: Gluekit\n\nThis post was originally published in November 2017. We have updated it with Netflix\u2019s most recent offerings up to August 2019.\n\nNetflix has spent the last few years and several billions of dollars on a crusade to be taken more seriously. Ever since it began branding its logo on original films in 2015, Netflix\u2019s primary goal has been to divorce itself from the \u201cdigital dollar bin\u201d reputation it established upon first pivoting from the snail-mail service, now an unsettlingly faint memory, to streaming. It was not so long ago that the service formerly known as \u201cNetflix Instant\u201d well, sucked; it was a repository for direct-to-DVD sequels, little-seen stand-up specials, and candy-colored kiddie cartoons seemingly plucked from Lisa Frank\u2019s more vivid night terrors. And so Netflix exec Ted Sarandos made a dignified selection for his first narrative go on the silver screen: Beasts of No Nation, a movie about child militias in Africa, with a well-pedigreed creative team (Cary Fukunaga was comin\u2019 in hot off his True Detective stint, Idris Elba was a brand-name star) and their according awards potential. It\u2019s a real movie, and by my count, a pretty good one.\n\nThe second film they released was the one where a donkey explosively sharts all over Adam Sandler. Since then, Netflix has bagged an Oscar, elbowed its way into Cannes, and spent more than Panama\u2019s gross national product on content. These days, Netflix is made up of a fair amount of movies that attain mere forgettability instead of outright awfulness. But it\u2019s produced some genuinely good films, as well \u2014 as we speak, there is a good shot that Roma will break through in the Oscar Best Picture category. Below, we attempt to rank every single Netflix original movie ever made (excluding documentaries, in the interest of this list remaining \u2026 bingeable).\n\nUnranked: Cam\n\nIn this cyber-thriller, the commonplace annoyances of working on the Internet \u2014 getting back in to a locked account, dealing with trolls, thirsting for numerical affirmations of your output \u2014 assume an uncanny existential terror in league with the eldritch fever dreams of David Lynch. Go-getter cam girl Alice (Madeline Brewer, reinforcing the Lynch comparison with a star-making performance that channels both Naomi Watts and Laura Harring) starts to unravel after she sees someone broadcasting from her channel using her name and her face, who is nonetheless not her. Her frantic maneuvers to secure her livelihood and sense of self climax in a semiotically loaded grand finale that can stand up to the most chilling setpieces of the new millennium. Fortified by verisimilitude that writer Isa Mazzei carried over from her days as a sex worker, directed with neon-laced sleekness by Daniel Goldhaber, and credited as \u201ca film by\u201d the two of them, it\u2019s an inventive and cerebral addition to the recent American horror boom. [Ed. note: Due to conflict-of-interest type reasons \u2014 the filmmakers are friends of mine \u2014 I\u2019ve opted to exclude this entry from the numerical rankings.]\n\n249. Oh, Ramona!\n\n\ufeffAre there just no rules in Romania? The American studio system has safeguards in place to prevent content this sexist, this repugnant, this hysterically deluded about its own rightness to ever reach the public. No such luck in Eastern Europe, where living boner Andrei (Bogdan Iancu) gives himself a makeover from virginal dork into a self-proclaimed \u201cpussy destroyer\u201d with the pick-up-artist getup to match. His new life as a master of seduction mostly entails treating women with flagrant insensitivity while they moon over him anyway, a nauseating wish-fulfillment fantasy straight from the Men\u2019s Right Activist handbook. But wait, there\u2019s more! Exhortations from Andrei that he\u2019s \u201cnot like the other boys,\u201d disgusting nondiegetic insert shots of fingers squelching into ripe produce, and one rousing monologue in which our hero vows to never bed a plus-sized woman ever again all combine to make this a matchlessly rancid piece of work. (Fun fact: the original title was Suck It, Ramona! Wonder why they changed it?)\n\n288. The Do-Over\n\nLet\u2019s start the ranking with the most noxious entry in Sandler\u2019s fruitful collaboration with Netflix. David Spade plays a henpecked beta cuck unsatisfied with his pitiful existence, which makes him receptive to an intriguing offer from old buddy Sandler when they meet up at their high-school reunion. A flimsy scheme to reinvent their lives by pinching a pair of dead guys\u2019 identities goes about as poorly as one could reasonably expect, and mostly just cues up tired gags about being tired. That\u2019s the one faintly redemptive feature of this otherwise barren movie: The Sandler filmography gets a rare flash of self-awareness when Spade\u2019s emasculated loser screams, \u201cI\u2019m so tired of women lying to me and fucking me over!\u201d while in a full-on fist fight with yet another \u201cuntrustworthy female.\u201d\n\n287. Rim of the World\n\nThe filmmaking entity known as \u201cMcG\u201d has to be a government psy-op designed to turn the people of the United States against the moving picture form. Tinfoil hats and red-yarn-covered corkboards aside, I cannot hazard any other guess at how someone who\u2019s made ugliness, stupidity, and taking the easy way out into his directorial signatures could have gotten so far in this industry. With the last-ditch efforts of four unpopular kids (a timid nerd, a mini-greaser, an intense yet largely silent Chinese girl, and an Indian imitation gangsta) to scurry through an alien invasion in progress, McG gets to try his hand at a \u2018Diet Amblin\u2019 style cribbed from Stranger Things. All that separates his latest feature from the word-of-mouth hit series is its orange-Fanta color grading, convivially racist jokes about Jackie Chan, dimestore CGI, and bone-deep idiocy. Whenever the official Netflix twitter account goes on a tear about their commitment to progressivism and art appreciation, this film should be held up as an incriminating counterexample.\n\n286. Game Over, Man!\n\nWhat kind of kompromat does Adam DeVine have on Netflix\u2019s board members? There\u2019s no other way to explain how he keeps getting execrable concept comedies pushed into existence as if through a sphincter. In this putrid Die Hard clone, he reunites with his former Workaholics pals to portray a trio of hotel custodians who must disarm a hit squad holding a weirdly cameo-heavy party hostage. (Spoiler alert: Flying Lotus\u2019s head explodes, Scanners-style. Also: Jillian Bell soils herself.) Slathered in gay-panic gags and reaching its nadir with an anilingus set piece that will leave all those who see it emotionally scarred, it\u2019s a heartening sign that the Sandlerian legacy of, ahem, half-assing it will remain intact for years to come.\n\n285. The Dirt\n\nWith the Oscars all given, we thought that Bohemian Rhapsody had done all the harm that it could possibly do, a false sense of security that left the American public totally unprepared for this unholy Spencer\u2019s Gifts version of the paint-by-numbers musician biopic. As Jeff Tremaine\u2019s boorish take on the M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce legend would have it, what made the hair-metal superstars such meteoric successes was their ability to be bigger assholes than everybody else. They\u2019ll hoover up every narcotic in sight, they\u2019ll bang anything that moves (including and especially your girlfriend), they\u2019re pathologically narcissistic, and the film loves them for it. Each song is in actuality an ode to douchery in all its forms, and boy does it take many forms: every flavor of misogyny we\u2019ve got, an unforgivable extended metaphor likening heroin addiction to a mind-blowing yet unreliable lover, an even worse bid to mine pathos from the death of a child. This selfsame douchery is in the human form of Pete Davidson, too, as a sniveling record executive that the band scorns for being slightly less of a prick than they are. An embarrassment of douche riches, truly.\n\n284. The Outsider\n\nMaybe you already know this film as \u201cthe Jared Leto yakuza Netflix movie.\u201d Maybe you\u2019re friends with one of the critics who were contractually obligated to review it, and consoled them as they rocked back and forth while babbling that they thought The Last Samurai couldn\u2019t get any whiter. Maybe you saw the ads, depicting Leto\u2019s U.S. expat who sets up shop in the Japanese criminal underground and promptly beats them all on their own turf, and maybe you wondered if the full-back koi tattoo wasn\u2019t a little on-the-nose. Maybe you heard the word \u201cSUMO!?\u201d as a distant scream, as thousands impotently begged to understand how such a tone-deaf display of old-school Orientalism could have come to be. When will Jared Leto be stopped, and who among us can do it?\n\n283. You Get Me\n\nAn erotic thriller neither thrilling nor erotic, filled out with a cast of post-Disney starlets and Vine stars temporarily separated from their handlers, this poor-man\u2019s Fatal Attraction plays like a rich symphony of bad choices. We all know the drill: Guy steps out on girlfriend, guy breaks things off with side piece, side piece turns psycho and wreaks vengeful havoc on guy. That time-tested formula gets sullied here by awe-inspiringly dumb dialogue (\u201cI love Tumblr,\u201d one character says, in a subtle reminder that we all someday shall die), and an inability to impose the sexual maturity the story calls for onto the teen characters enacting it. Most troubling of all, this film inadvertently makes the argument that the erotic-thriller tradition necessarily can\u2019t survive in the millennial generation. Up until Lohanian \u2014 Lohanesque? \u2014 star Bella Thorne gets all stabby, the tensest moments see our boy dramatically sending a text message and his sleuthing girlfriend dramatically checking Facebook. The kids have no idea what they\u2019re doing. Get off my sexy, homicidal lawn!\n\n282. True Memoirs of an International Assassin\n\nQ: When is an Adam Sandler movie not an Adam Sandler movie? A: When it\u2019s a showcase for his regular associate Paul \u201cKevin James\u201d Blart, Mall Cop. Though the Sandman does not show his face in this feature \u2014 a dime-store espionage flick that casts Blart as a spy novelist who stumbles into one of his own stories \u2014 his authorial fingerprints of passive chauvinism and total stylistic indifference have been smeared all over the frame. More to the point, this film presents a grossly inaccurate depiction of the writer\u2019s creative process. For starters, who deletes a sentence by repeatedly pressing the \u2018delete\u2019 key for each individual letter? Highlight and delete, man, or at least hold the key down! Who\u2019s got that kind of time?\n\n281. Malibu Rescue\n\nCritiquing this film, which I assume has been made by a crew of ninth-graders with a budget of thirty-seven dollars, makes me feel like a bad sport, as if I\u2019m kicking the last wobbling knee out from a piteous one-legged puppy. But if democratization of content really was the whole idea of Netflix\u2019s streaming revolution, then we must evaluate the puffs of intestinal air right along with the new Cuar\u00f3n, so here goes: a cast of Nickelodeon alumni and [shudder] Instagram influencers take to the sand and surf for a slobs-versus-slobs lifeguard comedy so feather-light that it barely exists. At a suspiciously short 69 minutes \u2014 truly, the nicest run time of all \u2014 it comes and goes without leaving any indentation on your mind or soul, a memory-foam movie if ever there was one. I\u2019m reminded of an old friend\u2019s Alabamian mother, who taught us \u201cbless your heart\u201d as an insult reserved for those too harmlessly dumb to make fun of directly. Bless these people\u2019s hearts, every last one of them.\n\n280. The Kissing Booth\n\nTeens and their mushy, impressionable brains should be kept far away from this putrid rom-com that plays like the most regrettable studio acquisition of 1989. They\u2019ll get all the wrong lessons from the inadvisable courtship between spunky Elle (Joey King) and bad boy Noah (Jacob Elordi), a relationship forbidden due to Elle\u2019s lifelong friendship with Noah\u2019s brother Lee (Joel Courtney). Director Vince Marcello plays off male possessiveness and other manifestations of entitlement \u2014 so much fuss gets made over how this poor girl chooses to dress \u2014 like the order of the day, hardly batting an eye at Noah\u2019s nagging violent tendencies. The movie works tirelessly to uphold the hollow honor of \u201cdude code,\u201d that unspoken etiquette dictating how men may lay claim to and trade access to the women in their lives. Let it instead die the natural death awaiting it.\n\n279. The Ridiculous 6\n\nSandler stretched himself a little bit by getting into genre work with this Western. Springing this viciously unfunny John Ford riff on America two weeks before Christmas 2015 like a present nobody especially wanted, Sandler portrays a leathery cowpuncher on a search for his wayward Pa with his legion of half-brothers. Their ramble through the countryside mostly exists to cue up collar-tug-worthy cracks at Native Americans and an inexplicable number of \u201cjokes\u201d revolving around donkey feces.\n\n278. The Silence\n\nPart of me wishes I could simply cut-and-paste my blurb about Bird Box here with a few altered proper nouns and kick my feet up. That\u2019s more or less what the makers of this movie did, so why should I put in any more effort? The militant sameness enforced by this algorithm has never been so perceivable, as it sculpts a 2016 novel into a remora clinging to the underside of A Quiet Place and its sensory-deprived progeny. The monsters hunting by sound are impish bat freaks in this instance, and until the late-in-the-game introduction of an evil priest, shunted in to fill the empty space where a real antagonist should be, each beat syncs up with a corresponding section of its twin. Not even the divergent casting \u2014 Stanley Tucci leads his family to safety, while Chilling Adventures of Sabrina star Kiernan Shipka is his daughter by cross-promotional synergy \u2014 can provide any sense of individuality. The dead giveaway: It was written by a guy who made his name penning rip-offs.\n\n277. I Am Not An Easy Man\n\nYou\u2019ve got to hand it to France \u2014 they may be as good at churning out unfathomably ill-conceived studio comedies as Hollywood. Hell, given the country\u2019s more casual relationship to the strictures of political correctness, they\u2019re probably even better. Case in point is I Am Not An Easy Man, a \u201ccomedy\u201d that makes I Feel Pretty look like a Betty Friedan book. One afternoon, a chauvinist pig walks into a pole on the street and awakens in a world where the roles of men and women have been completely reversed! The satire just writes itself! Though, in a much more real way, it does not. The script goes for every easy joke, no matter how distasteful; the sight of men running around in Juicy tracksuits with \u201cHOT\u201d on the butt is sub-camp-skit funny, but a scene that faces him with the same sexual harassment he\u2019d previously practiced is nothing but chilling. On the bright side, Bright\u2019s mastery of allegory appears subtle in comparison.\n\n276. A Christmas Prince: The Royal Wedding\n\nHeavy is the head that wears the crown, as they say. Newly coronated queen Amber (a returning Rose McIver) finds the truth in the statement as she gets settled in the throne to the postcard-scenic kingdom of Aldovia \u2014 there\u2019s some embezzling going on in the state kitty, but who cares, really \u2014 just as the film itself learns how hard upholding its own reputation can be. This sequel isn\u2019t shy about reproducing what audiences liked in the unaccountably successful original, adding yet another layer of unoriginality to an already-thick casserole of unoriginality. And when you clone a clone, surprising new genetic defects crop up, such as a mincing Indian manservant/stylist character guaranteed to appeal to homophobes and colonialism nostalgists alike. Those who didn\u2019t wrinkle their lips at the sugary taste of this peppermint-flavored confection the first time around, however, can take solace in the same wheelchair-bound cuteness factory (Honor Kneafsey), the same upstairs-downstairs tensions between the classes, the same chaste paperback lovey-dovery.\n\n275. Girl\n\nThe predominantly cis-gendered critical corps at the Cannes Film Festival gushed over Lukas Dhont\u2019s study of a trans ballerina wrestling for control of her own body, while actual trans viewers out in the world beyond the Croisette largely condemned it. But even for someone with a little less skin in the game of gender, it\u2019s not hard to see the failings of Dhont\u2019s good intentions. (If we\u2019re willing to give him the benefit of that particular doubt, that is.) He assumes a voyeur\u2019s peering vantage point in the many scenes focusing on the private anatomy of Laura (Victor Polster, who, like Dhont, is not trans); we can nearly hear heavy breathing as she carefully tapes down her penis. To say nothing of the remorselessly exploitative finale, in which the mutilation that Laura inflicts on herself is treated not as rock bottom, but as a happy ending. Dhont and Polster have been working the press circuit, repeating ad nauseam that they\u2019re not out to wrong anyone. The canyon between their words and deeds is pan enough, but for more in-depth criticism, read someone who knows what they\u2019re talking about.\n\n274. Mute\n\nYou can\u2019t fault Duncan Jones for believing in himself. This sci-fi epic is an incoherent mess filtered through an intensely personal vision, and the result is something closer to Battlefield Earth than Southland Tales. Jones clearly poured a lot of himself into the outlay of a techno-Berlin in the year 2035, peopled as it is by such oddballs as Silent Amish Bartender Alexander Skarsgard and Flamboyantly Mustachioed Black-Market Surgeon Paul Rudd. The writing confounds the viewer by constantly bursting out into narrative seizures about robot sex or child pornography while remaining steadfastly boring through its two-plus hours. It\u2019s the rare film that\u2019s impossible to describe without making its badness sound more entertaining than it actually is.\n\n273. The Fundamentals of Caring\n\nThat this film could actually manage to be worse than its title is a grim sort of accomplishment. Its pathos is so disingenuous and suffocating that not even Human Embodiment of Charm Paul Rudd can salvage it. He plays a depressed writer (red flag No. 1) who\u2019s going through a divorce (red flag No. 2) following the untimely death of his son (red flag No. 3), and coping by taking new work as a live-in caregiver (red flag No. 4) for a smart-aleck teen (red flag No. 5). Together, they set out on a cross-country road trip (red flag No. 6) and pick up a potential love interest for the boy in a streetwise drifter girl (red flag No. 7), who is also Selena Gomez (red flag No. 8). By starting with a premise so rich with potential for overcooked emotional manipulation, the film sets an uphill battle for itself so steep that it can fall right off the mountain.\n\n272. When We First Met\n\nWhen you\u2019re into someone who\u2019s not into you, it\u2019s hard not to imagine what you could have done differently; if only you had worn this shirt instead of that one, said something smooth instead of something awkward, made a move at just the right moment \u2026 The vast majority of us come to accept that sometimes it\u2019s just not meant to be, and move on. In this rom-com of toxic infatuation, however, Adam DeVine\u2019s lovelorn lame-o spends years secretly lusting after his best friend (Alexandra Daddario) only to happen into a time-travel booth that sends him back to their first night together. The film behaves as if his efforts to use his extensive knowledge of her personality to trick her younger self into falling for him are sweet but misguided. In actuality, he\u2019s a moving embodiment of that immortal Onion article \u201cRomantic-Comedy Behavior Gets Real-Life Man Arrested.\u201d\n\n271. The Holiday Calendar\n\nUntil you give it a quick Google, this one\u2019s a stumper. It\u2019s a pretty by-the-book Yulesploitation flick \u2014 a small-time photographer happens upon an enchanted Advent heirloom and must choose between a hot-jerk doctor or her childhood bestie, who\u2019s thoughtful and a good listener! \u2014 except for leading actress Kat Graham. Films like this live and die with the winningness of their leads, and both the script and camera treat Graham like she\u2019s a project-carrying name, despite the fact that her lifeless performance could be easily interchanged with that of any other C-lister. But one online search and, ah, it all becomes clear: Graham has spent years as the star of The Vampire Diaries. Except that this ploy to parley her niche notability onto a broader mainstream platform doesn\u2019t stand a chance unless Graham\u2019s got the chops to back it up. The script doesn\u2019t do her any favors, but it\u2019s not as if she\u2019s ready to meet it halfway, either.\n\n270. Father of the Year\n\nOur world is full of unknowable mysteries: How does the aurora borealis form? What happened to D.B. Cooper? And for the love of all that is holy, what is going on with David Spade\u2019s accent in this half-baked Happy Madison production? His character Wayne seems to hail from the same stretch of the Rust Belt as Spade\u2019s dirtbag extraordinaire Joe Dirt, but his voice places him somewhere in the Little Australia neighborhood of Boston. That\u2019s the sturdiest point of interest in this comedy of beta-male manners that pits Wayne against rival dad Mardy (Nat Faxon, who has an Oscar), much to the chagrin of their college-aged sons (Joey Bragg and Matt Shively). Their idiotic feud to determine the top paterfamilias leads to accidental MDMA-dropping and male breast enhancement, but the mischief does little to perk up an otherwise stultifying family outing. This film is the equal and opposite reaction to the era of the Hot Dad.\n\n269. Good Sam\n\nKate Melville\u2019s adaptation of an airport paperback with attractive sales figures bills itself as a \u201cfeel-good mystery,\u201d naturally posing the question of to whom this all feels good. Only the most warmth-starved hearts would fall for this film\u2019s hokey brand of email-forward optimism as it wins over the jaded one by one. Some incognito do-gooder has been leaving bags of cold hard cash with strangers around New York, but doubtful cub reporter Kate Bradley (Tiya Sircar, better known as The Good Place\u2019s Vicky) wants to find the real story. A street-toughened city gal, she can\u2019t believe someone could possibly be so generous, and only through a saltine-flavored love triangle with a businessman \u2014 bad \u2014 and a firefighter \u2014 good \u2014 can she uncover the identity of the anonymous donor. Between the \u201cpractice random acts of kindness\u201d hogwash and the DOA romcom hogwash, there\u2019s simply too much hogwash to go around.\n\n268. A Christmas Prince\n\nI\u2019ve got a theory that if you showed this Yuletide rom-com to someone who had never seen a movie before \u2014 ideally, someone who had never even heard of movies \u2014 it would positively charm them. Few movies cycle through the clich\u00e9s of their genre with such a rigorous lack of imagination, and if someone hadn\u2019t already grown tired of the klutzy but cute workin\u2019 girl who falls for a debonair, rich Adonis, they\u2019d feel for our gal Amber (Rose McIver). They wouldn\u2019t bat an eye at the ludicrous plot sending this newly minted reporter on her first-ever assignment to report on the royal family of a fictitious European nation, and they wouldn\u2019t think twice about the improbable mix-up that brings Amber closer to the dashing prince under the pretext of mistaken identity. They wouldn\u2019t roll their eyes at Amber\u2019s conniving brunette-haired foil, or the last-minute deus ex machina that brings the leads \u2014 who met earlier that week \u2014 together in marriage. This theoretical person would take it all at face value and love it. Sadly, we cannot be so na\u00efve.\n\n267. The Babysitter\n\nThis \u201980s-throwback slasher from notorious Charlie\u2019s Angels: Full Throttle director McG is an inexplicable Satanic-panic flick that pits a nail-biting kid against his hottie coed caretaker and the rest of her death cult. Why, when he first catches an eyeful of the group (which also includes Bella Thorne, suddenly everywhere) turning a game of spin the bottle into a bloodbath, do the words \u201cWHAT THE FUCK\u201d suddenly fly onto the screen in giant red text? And then later on, when he uses a handy knife given to him by his good pal Anton Chekov in the first act, why does McG throw the phrase \u201cPOCKET KNIFE \u2026 BITCHES!\u201d in our faces? Why does the film break up its PG-13 comedy with geysers of gore that John Woo might call \u201ca little much?\u201d Why, after getting shot in the chest, is Bella Thorne unconcerned about her own health and wholly preoccupied with her cans no longer being perfect? Why is there so much trouble in the world?\n\n266. Brij Mohan Amar Rahe\n\nEvidently a satisfactory number of people tuned in for Brahman Naman and Lust Stories, because Netflix has continued their campaign to sew up the Indian sex farce with this comedy that Adam Sandler might describe as \u201ca little on-the-nose.\u201d Not since the days of the Entourage movie has a script\u2019s gender politics so transparently outed itself as being written by men: bra shop proprietor Brij Mohan (Arjun Mathur) can\u2019t stand his humorless shrew of a wife (Nidhi Singh) and wants to begin anew with his 24-year-old girl on the side, so he pulls a move I call the Slimeball Tom Sawyer and fakes his own death. Of course he can\u2019t make a clean getaway, and eventually he (in the guise of his assumed identity, Amar) faces a comeuppance. Seeing someone contemptible get their just desserts should be gratifying, and yet the absence of any character that isn\u2019t a mean-spirited manifestation of male insecurity prohibits that feeling. It is, at least, slightly less unpleasant than The Do-Over, though not for lack of trying.\n\n265. The Last Summer\n\nWhile I\u2019m steadfast in my belief that \u201cThe Summer That Changed Everything\u201d is one of cinema\u2019s most dependable subgenres, William Bindley did his darndest to convince me otherwise with this soulless imitation. The almost-too-telegenic graduates that this film follows for three magical months before college \u2014 an ensemble led by K.J. Apa, better known as TV\u2019s Hot Archie Who Fucks, and Maia Mitchell of The Fosters \u2014 scarcely register as human. Bindley sends them on Instagram-filtered walk-and-talks down Chicago streets at magic hour, rattling off notable alumni of NYU\u2019s film school (she\u2019s a cineaste-in-training, he has dreams of EDM stardom), and not for one second does it resemble a conversation between members of our species. They\u2019re not even the smart-mouthed comic-strip characters of a Can\u2019t Hardly Wait, a clear influence on the film\u2019s open stock-type-bandying. They\u2019re an adult\u2019s idea of teens, portrayed by twenty-somethings that look thirty, animated by a dope\u2019s idea of wit.\n\n264. Blockbuster\n\nWhere did the French get their reputation as masters of romance? July Hygreck\u2019s tone-deaf rom-com could singlehandedly rewrite the national caricature, so repellent is its approach to courtship. Lola (Charlotte Gabris) kicks Jeremy (Syrus Shahidi) to the curb with good reason, and still the film tacitly cheers him on as he goes about whipping up a DIY superhero movie to win her back. Because Lola loves the capes-and-tights set, this gesture is presented as a thoughtful, quirky demonstration of devotion in the vein of Be Kind Rewind (that Lola\u2019s favorite director is explicitly stated to be Michel Gondry, who cameos in the film, should not come as a surprise), instead of an unsavory homage to the guy who wouldn\u2019t stop playing piano. The most baffling aspect of all is that a female director would be behind this blend of toxic male entitlement and high-viscosity corn syrup.\n\n263. Budapest\n\nIn Europe, gangs of bros raise the bachelor party to the Nth degree with so-called \u201cstag weekends,\u201d non-stop bacchanals of liquor-chugging, cross-dressing, and generally dishonorable behavior. In this aspirationally moronic comedy from (where else!) France, two suit-wearers (Manu Payet and Jonathan Cohen) make a career change into the party industry, arranging such unspeakable getaways under the banner of Crazy Tours. This premise mostly acts as a container for lots of narcotics, pendulous breasts, and other monkey business, all of which is for nothing more than its own sake. The contentious debate over depiction vs. endorsement \u2014 whether a film can show men behaving badly without condoning their seductive misbehavior, the question Martin Scorsese must re-answer every five years \u2014 ends here, with a film that makes zero effort to interrogate or rise above itself. One-time Hitman director Xavier Gens is simply too accommodating to the men making all the accommodations.\n\n262. Bright\n\nWhile definitely the most high-profile bad Netflix movie \u2014 a budget big enough to lure Suicide Squad director David Ayer and star Will Smith, plentiful CGI, a log line as simple as \u201corc cop\u201d \u2014 this feature-length insult to the concept of allegory is not quite the worst in the library. But credit Ayer for giving it the ol\u2019 college try, rehashing the racial commentary of his breakout script Training Day for an alternate Los Angeles where hulking magical beasties stand in for black folks. From this unsound premise he weaves an incomprehensible story involving a powerful magic wand, Noomi Rapace as a tremulous elf, and latent plot-hole-fixing superpowers revealed at just the right moment. The merciful among you may feel moved to award Ayer some pity points for following an original thought instead of churning through more franchise fare, but the script relinquishes any goodwill with four simple words: \u201cFairy lives don\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\n261. iBoy\n\nThe primary utility of this rinky-dink attempt at a superhero movie (I\u2019ll say this but once: Do not produce an effects-driven action film if you do not have the budget to make those effects look good) is to determine Game of Thrones star Maisie Williams\u2019s viability as a big-screen quantity. That\u2019s really the only intriguing question in this unattractive, rote squandering of a neat concept, namely, a crime-fighter with the power to interface with all electrical devices. While some of us might use technopathy to redistribute wealth or expose covert wrongdoing, our hero Tom (Bill Milner) instead goes after neighborhood toughs like a USB-enabled Kick-Ass. Williams, as Tom\u2019s inevitable love interest, is fine.\n\n260. The After Party\n\nWorldStarHipHop, that august online repository of fight clips, uploaded freestyles, and twerk videos, produced this misbegotten rap comedy in their first foray into feature-length entertainment. We know this because of the big honkin\u2019 Worldstar logo that flashes over the screen in the opening seconds, and because of the guy who yells the trademark \u201cWORLDSTAAAAAR!\u201d when grinding MC Owen (up-and-coming rapper Kyle) projectile pukes on Wiz Khalifa in front of a hundred recording iPhones, and because the website makes him a laughingstock in the very industry he\u2019s trying to break into. But even without the name-drops, the Worldstar stamp would still be evident from the long line of rapper cameos, some better than others. (Jadakiss stopping by to drop a little knowledge about Eric B. and Rakim plays a tad better than [checks notes] Desiigner musing on his love for cute animal vids.) Netflix\u2019s attempts to game the numbers have never been as undisguised as when Owen and his best friend/manager Jeff (Harrison Holzer) try to glad-hand for a record deal with living catchphrase machine\u2013slash\u2013animate social-media account DJ Khaled. \u201cWise up!\u201d is Mr. Khaled\u2019s advice, words the film itself would\u2019ve been smart to heed.\n\n259. Tau\n\nRiding high off his Oscar win for a Winston Churchill buried under pounds of prosthetic jowl, Gary Oldman estranged himself even further from humanity by voicing the artificially intelligent computer program that gives this dismal sci-fi project its title. Looming over a captive test subject (Maika Monroe), Tau\u2019s twisted creator (Ed Skrein) explains that this A.I. is so advanced that it must be \u201ccut off from the outside world,\u201d which amounts to Tau acting like a complete dumbass all of the time. Left alone with Monroe\u2019s wily prisoner, he peppers her with infantile questions mostly about what different words mean, eventually segueing into a pas de deux most accurately described as \u201cEx Machina on stupid pills.\u201d What does it mean to live, Tau wonders; this critic found himself wondering the same thing, albeit in a more existentially despairing tenor.\n\n258. Sandy Wexler\n\nThis biopic of a fictitious, incompetent, ill-mannered talent manager benefited from the subtle handicap of lowered expectations, exceeding the likes of The Do-Over with a handful of decent one-liners and some amusing celebrity cameos. One gets the impression that Sandler\u2019s actually trying in this train wreck, as opposed to the more passive train wrecks that preceded it. But praising the \u201cbest Adam Sandler movie for Netflix\u201d is like choosing your favorite dental procedure. Either way, by the time it\u2019s over, you won\u2019t be able to feel part of your face.\n\n257. The Tribe\n\nHow the same laws requiring Lee Daniels to slap his name on The Butler fail to prevent confusion between this stink-bomb and the superlative 2015 film of the same title (also on Netflix as recently as a few months ago!) eludes me. God save any poor soul looking for the latter who lands on the former, another dispatch from French studio comedy hell. [Deep breath, as if bearing the weight of all my past mistakes:] A layoff-happy meanie CEO shrugs off his long-lost birth mother when she accosts him outside his office building, but after a head injury leaves him a little slow on the uptake, he happily joins [second deep breath] her predominantly elderly dance troupe. A film so brazenly lazy and slapdash doesn\u2019t qualify for full sentences, so: Butt jokes. Big-man-dancing jokes. Family! CEO nice. Movie!\n\n256. #realityhigh\n\nOne day, Congress will pass a bill rendering hashtag movie titles punishable by law, but until then, we\u2019re stuck with this utterly clueless Clueless wannabe. (Or Easy A. Hell, even The DUFF. This is the saddest kind of bad movie, one that feels like a worse version of so many wonderful movies.) The latest in a long line of films that know teenagers use social media but utterly fail to understand how, this pat after-school special dispenses nuggets of wisdom about being true to yourself and knowing who your friends are that possess all the depth and nuance of a tweet. I pray that today\u2019s teens, for their own sake, will get better nostalgia objects than this one.\n\n255. The Cloverfield Paradox\n\nThe greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the viewership of Super Bowl LII to watch this movie. Turns out all the hubbub over the zero-warning release was all compensation \u2014 for a plot cobbled together from no fewer than four classics, for cut-rate production values suggesting the producers set most of their $45 million budget on fire, and perhaps the most cynical, mercenary approach to connected-universe franchising yet. Gugu Mbatha-Raw does her best as an astronaut mourning the death of her children (would you believe that comes up later on in the film?) as she and her colleagues inadvertently shoot themselves into an unpredictable parallel dimension. A handful of nifty set pieces get kneecapped by technical shortcomings, and the big reveal as to what the hell this all has to do with Cloverfield is so cheap, so manipulative, and so nihilistic that it could have come from one of the latter seasons of The Walking Dead.\n\n254. Polar\n\nThe dream of the \u201990s \u2014 when making Pulp Fiction, but dumber and more violent, was the highest station to which an up-and-coming director could aspire \u2014 is alive with Jonas \u00c5kerlund\u2019s stylized-to-a-fault translation of a noir-shaded comic series. Hit man Mads Mikkelsen is two weeks out from hanging up his holsters, so he does the safe thing and savors some well-earned R&R over two uneventful weeks. Sike! His boss (Matt Lucas) sends his underlings to kill the much-feared \u201cBlack Kaiser\u201d so that the cost of his pension won\u2019t come out of the company kitty. But \u00c5kerlund has no time to get hung up on the vindictive side of human resources, he\u2019s off smacking us across the face with freeze-frame title introduction cards for each bundle of quirks passed off as a character. The constant Ol\u2019 Faithfuls of blood are plenty, the imbecilic non-twist clarifying the purpose of Vanessa Hudgens is just too much, and killing an angelic French bulldog for no other reason than jollies is the final straw.\n\n253. The Red Sea Diving Resort\n\nThe expression \u201cbad for the Jews\u201d refers to the quality of being deleterious to the Jewish people, used in cases when one of our own has done something particularly shameful as well as instances of goyim doing harm to the community. This film falls under the second category of BFTJ, in casting a red-blooded and blue-eyed Chris Evans as a Mossad agent named Ari Levinson. Tapping Captain America to portray an Israeli commando would be like getting J-Law to play Anne Frank; Jewish viewers can smell the falsity like a brisket cooking in the oven. The boneheaded miscasting and the underlying unfamiliarity with the culture hamper the whole of this Argo-style extraction thriller, which pulls out the Talmudic passage from Schindler\u2019s List at a make-or-break moment that ends up broken. Throw in one severely mislaid \u201cHungry Like the Wolf\u201d montage and an undeserved final-act moral stand, and we hit peak BFTJ. Slavery, genocide, and now this?\n\n252. Death Note\n\nAfter slogging through this American anime adaptation, the best thing a viewer can say about director Adam Wingard is that he\u2019s a master of misdirection. We were all so focused on the question of whitewashing in this originally Asian property that the media narrative almost entirely ignored how defiantly uninteresting this movie is. How could a story that reimagines Dostoevsky\u2019s Raskolnikov as a hot genius teen on a lethal mission to cleanse the world of evil and features real-life god of death Willem Dafoe as an apple-munching CGI god of death, possibly turn out so dull? It\u2019s not just the visual flatness that trades the bustle of metropolitan Japan for permanently grey Seattle, but that this morality tale\u2019s moralizing is fundamentally inconsistent. It contradicts itself too many times to make any lucid point.\n\n251. The Week Of\n\nAnything setting up Rachel Dratch to do a long-form Lawng Eyeland accent cannot be all bad. But she\u2019s merely a supporting player on Netflix\u2019s latest two-hour episode of the Adam Sandler show, a hellacious and unending variety program in which the softest-working man in show business alternates between his tiny-man squeaking and his angry-man yelling. (Not all funny voices are created equal.) Dratch and Sandler are the proud parents of the bride in this nuptial culture clash as they struggle to fit in with the black groom\u2019s family, in particular his suave surgeon dad Chris Rock. There\u2019s a bit of Lady Bird\u2013ish insight on the awkwardness of being in the lower half of the middle class, but it\u2019s hard to hear over the sound of Sandler\u2019s strangulated yowling.\n\n250. Happy Anniversary\n\nHow can the end product of a team-up between two performers as generously lovable as No\u00ebl Wells and Ben Schwartz and a bulldog puppy end up so grating and charmless? Blame writer-director Jared Stern, the guy responsible for The Intern and the short-lived sitcom Dr. Ken, who packs this portrait of a disintegrating romance with unbearable one-liners like, \u201cIt\u2019s not called gently reclining in love, it\u2019s called falling in love!\u201d The film traces their slow breakup from fight to fight, forgetting to first give the audience a compelling reason to root for these two self-absorbed platitude factories to stay together. Without that, their separation feels only right and overdue, eons removed from the mournful register Stern\u2019s going for. The film gets to the conclusion that some relationships aren\u2019t worth struggling for about 80 minutes after everyone else.\n\n249. Walk. Ride. Rodeo\n\nLast year, Chlo\u00e9 Zhao spun a heartland tragedy with The Rider, a glowingly received film about an injured rodeo star\u2019s convalescence and eventual return to the ring. Amberley Snyder\u2019s life story clip-clops down the same dusty Wyoming road \u2014 the real-life 19-year-old would not let a car crash paralyzing her from the waist down keep her from her purpose \u2014 but director Conor Allyn and star Spencer Locke\u2019s interpretation of it reduces her struggle to an outline of itself. Though the facts may be real and the stunts authentic, her pain is all fake. The country-rock soundtrack plays at cookouts in the deepest reaches of Hell, and as Amberley\u2019s mother, Missi Pyle is acting in an entirely different (and likely better) movie. Only the most dedicated horse girls will be able to make it through this rough ride without getting thrown.\n\n248. Extinction\n\nUniversal had a good reason to ditch this sci-fi genocide allegory with scant days to go before its theatrical release. Somebody high up must have yanked the rip cord after witnessing the dopey plot twist too predictable to conceal here: maintenance worker Michael Pe\u00f1a\u2019s recurring nightmares about alien annihilation have sprung to life, imperiling his dutiful wife Lizzy Caplan and their formidably annoying kids. Or so you thought \u2014 the invading \u201caliens\u201d are actually humans, and the Pe\u00f1a-Caplan family are all artificially intelligent androids! A rogue human comes to learn that the bots can feel, just like flesh-and-blood homo sapiens, cuing up the sagacity that killing people is wrong. A leaden work of Commentary 101 dressed as an action tentpole \u2014 more like Bore of the Worlds, am I right? \u2014 it is also proof that an effects-driven film can look heavily produced without looking polished.\n\n\ufeff247. Special Correspondents\n\nWhile drumming up publicity during postproduction, director-writer-star Ricky Gervais said of this motion picture, \u201cEven though it would certainly be billed as a comedy, it\u2019s not a big, broad, loud, obvious, one \u2026 It\u2019s a bit satirical.\u201d One gets the sense Gervais knew, deep down, how dismal his reviews would be, and moreover, the specific nature of that dismalness. For this big, broad, loud, obvious comedy does indeed aspire to satire with its harebrained plot about two thick-skulled news-radio journalists ginning up a bogus Ecuadorian revolution from the safety of a guest room in America. But Gervais cannot muster either the brains or balls to say anything substantive about the anything-goes state of modern media or hectic banana republics in South America. The heroically distasteful Gervais of The Office feels so far away.\n\n246. Murder Mystery\n\nThe Sandler-Netflix special relationship bears something close to fruit with this longform Agatha Christie homage nonetheless hobbled by its auteur\u2019s same old peccadilloes. For starters, his loudly stated identification with the blue-collar clock-punchers of America rings hollow as the man himself continues to be devoured by his own wealth. He and Jennifer Aniston portray Nick and Audrey Spitz, a beat cop and a hairdresser \u2014 regulah New Yawkahs \u2014 and their dynamic continues another unfavorable trend of Sandler\u2019s oeuvre in how little they like each other. It\u2019s a dispiriting view of matrimony, and though it casts a disparaging light on husbands in general, the simple enjoyment of unraveling a mystery largely transcends the film\u2019s overall Sandler-ness. With the noted exception, that is, of Adeel Akhtar\u2019s \u201890s-era wanksta Maharaja, who sucks all the oxygen out of every scene he\u2019s in like a finely-tuned Dyson.\n\n245. The Most Hated Woman in America\n\nThis biopic of atheism activist Madalyn Murray O\u2019Hair is a platform for Melissa Leo that would\u2019ve been an abandoned Oscar horse ten years ago, and barely exists now. Leo gets to chew a whole lot of scenery as she takes the fight to remove prayer from public schools into court, attracts scorn from every corner of society, and eventually gets herself abducted. Melissa Leo diehards will relish the chance to see her don all manner of creative hairpieces and Coke-bottle glasses that I\u2019m pretty sure get a little bit bigger with every passing scene. Regular people will wonder how a film ostensibly dealing with First Amendment rights could possibly generate zero original insight.\n\n244. Christmas Inheritance\n\nSweet Home Alabama heads north of the Mason-Dixon in this seasonal rom-com that could be most charitably praised as \u201cnot A Christmas Prince.\u201d Well-meaning but hopelessly pampered Ellen (Eliza Taylor) grows a conscience while traveling to her provincial hometown of Snow Falls, the quaintest frost-laced village Thomas Kinkade never imagined. If she wants her massive inheritance, she\u2019ll first have to deliver a letter to her father\u2019s former business partner using no more than the $100 in her pocket, a quest that wins her the heart of human mayonnaise jar Jake Lacy and teaches her a valuable lesson about checking her privilege. Will someone start a GoFundMe for Andie MacDowell so she doesn\u2019t have to take paycheck gigs like this ever again?\n\n243. David Brent: Life on the Road\n\nHaving successfully alienated his fanbase with a steady stream of smug press appearances and awards-show hosting gigs, perhaps Ricky Gervais figured he\u2019d do well to shut up and play the hits. He took the biggest crowd-pleaser in his repertoire (fatuous boob David Brent of the British Office) out of mothballs for this uninspired spin-off that finds the former middle manager, reduced now to grunt work at a toilet chemical company, touring with his band Foregone Conclusion. Leaving behind the setting of Wernham Hogg and the co-workers that went with it reveals the conceptual limits of the Brent\u2019s constant self-humiliation. The touring band that refuses to be in a room with him even as they empty his life savings, the brutal un-self-awareness \u2014 without the hard-earned underlying note of sympathy, it\u2019s all just sadistic.\n\n242. Sara\u2019s Notebook\n\nIn case you thought Americans had sole title to the \u201caccount of third-world strife through the safe viewpoint of a well-meaning white person\u201d movie, Spain is here to set you straight. Visiting the same morass of violence and political destabilization that plagued Beasts of No Nation\u2019s corner of Africa, this film sends Laura (B\u00e9len Rueda) into the middle of the Congo\u2019s mineral wars to search for her wayward sister, no matter the costs. What\u2019s clearly intended as a tribute to one woman\u2019s bravery amidst inhumanity completely misses the point by leaving the Africans this war actually affects on the sideline. It\u2019s not as catastrophically clueless as Sean Penn\u2019s The Last Face, but this transgression is accentuated by the presence of Beasts of No Nation in Netflix\u2019s streaming library, a film that does correctly everything this film does wrong.\n\n241. IO\n\nI\u2019m putting my foot down, and ruling that a post-apocalyptic setting shall no longer pass muster as an excuse to skimp out on production design. The nondescript French fields in which Jonathan Helpert shot this sneeze of a movie look more like, well, fields with some crap thrown all over the place than a wasteland made arid by an unbreathable atmosphere. It\u2019s here that survivors Margaret Qualley and Anthony Mackie rendezvous, do a little amateur beekeeping, and toy with the idea of repopulating the Earth. That they seem totally mismatched in terms of temperament and age (Qualley was 21 during filming, to Mackie\u2019s 37) may be the idea, but what an idea to expound upon. Their unendurable trip to a still-standing art museum will make you sympathize with the gaseous cloud.\n\n240. Point Blank\n\nThere\u2019s a point early on in this motion picture when Anthony Mackie yells the words \u201cnot without my wife!\u201d This is the action-movie equivalent of a cowboy saying \u201cThis town ain\u2019t big enough for the two of us\u201d in a Western, an evocation of a clich\u00e9 so ossified that it can\u2019t possibly be serious in 2019. And yet! Joe Lynch\u2019s film explicitly adapts the French production \u00c0 bout portant, and Americans will most likely make the mental link to Michael Mann\u2019s expertly done Collateral, but it feels derivative in a less pinpointed sense than that \u2014 the store-brand cereal of manly-man shooters. Viewers might retain memories of the surplus of \u201980s New Wave hits on the soundtrack, or perhaps the hoodlum with a cinephile streak who likes to kick it while watching Sorcerer and commenting on the genius of William Friedkin. But mostly they\u2019ll hold on to that lack of memorability as a thing unto itself, as the absence of flavor, when concentrated enough, becomes a flavor of its own.\n\n239. Sierra Burgess Is a Loser\n\nThe insidious influence of the almighty algorithm feels more palpable in some movies than others. Everything about Ian Samuels\u2019s riff on Cyrano de Bergerac \u2014 its niche as a teen-friendly rom-com, the cast being led by Shannon \u201cBarb from Stranger Things\u201d Purser and Noah \u201cPeter Kavinsky from To All the Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before\u201d Centineo, a plot oriented around texting \u2014 could have been decided by consensus. Though that leaves the question of how one film can be both focus-grouped to death and completely bereft of any self-knowledge regarding tone or character. Sierra Burgess may not be a loser, but she\u2019s still kinda insufferable, the sort of self-pitying nerd who considers it an own to tell a bathroom bully she means Quasimodo, not Bilbo. Her scheme to win the man of her dreams involves deceiving him and intentionally humiliating her one friend. For many viewers, Purser can get away with this because (1) she\u2019s a girl, and (2) doesn\u2019t conform to mainstream body standards, but there\u2019s something rotten just beneath the marching-band uniform.\n\n238. Duck Duck Goose\n\nChildren, if your parents have exposed you to this very-bad-no-good cartoon, tell your teacher, religious official, or another responsible adult in your area. They should know better than to subject an innocent child to the volley of poop jokes, age-inappropriate pop-culture references, and pathos-as-afterthought contained in this sub-Minions animated abomination. Jim Gaffigan voices a carefree goose bachelor who ends up in custody of two defenseless baby ducks separated from their flock. (DUCK. DUCK. GOOSE. DO YOU GET IT?!) He has no choice but to take them under his wing and return them from whence they came, learning some threadbare lessons about responsibility along the way. And because this film was produced by the Wanda Media Company as well as Jiangsu Yuandongli Computer Animation Company, and because we are at the mercy of the Chinese entertainment economy, the film is set in China. It\u2019s all very weird and pretty terrible.\n\n237. XOXO\n\nImagine Nashville (the Robert Altman movie, not the TV show where Hayden Panettiere is secretly Taylor Swift), but with EDM instead of country-western music. Now remove that film\u2019s soul-sickness over the fluctuating American character and replace it with a pat star-is-born narrative that was already done to death when We Are Your Friends dropped the beat one year earlier. Throw in a handful of barely identifiable TV players, such as That Cute Girl From Modern Family, Wasn\u2019t He on The Good Wife?, and Chris D\u2019Elia. Then take a tab of MDMA, wait about 40 minutes (30 if it\u2019s pure), and tape a tablet playing the Coachella livestream on a loop to your head. For all intents and purposes, you have now seen the film XOXO.\n\n236. Blood Will Tell\n\nCops have a saying that when a woman dies under mysterious circumstances, nine times out of ten, the husband did it. This thriller coming to us via Spain poses the question as to whether that might be the case, then expects us to spend the next couple hours stroking our chins about the all-but-assured. Choleric widower Elias (Oscar Marintez) sure seems to be the guilty party, but we\u2019ll have to join his son-in-law Santiago (Diego Vel\u00e1zquez) as he investigates his mother\u2019s quote-unquote \u201caccidental\u201d death to be sure. The truth comes out, as we knew it would, only to conceal a more pointless and vacuous version of the truth within itself. In other words, some twists are best left un-twisted, especially the ones slapped together from convenience and happenstance just to set up a belabored full-circle ending.\n\n235. Paradox\n\nI got yer paradox right here: How could a sci-fi\u2013Western featuring Neil Young as a futuristic bandit roving the countryside in search of computer keyboards and Super 8 cameras feel like such a chore, even at 73 minutes? Trace the project\u2019s roots back to director Daryl Hannah\u2019s relationship with Young and this self-indulgent vanity project starts to make a little more sense. More amateurish than Amateur, this dilettante\u2019s dabble plods from one farmland pseudo-koan to another while Hannah and her costume-closet players wander aimlessly through the prairies. Young is, at best, conscious. I\u2019m tempted to liken Hannah\u2019s calamitous approach to The Room, another labor of love from someone with too much money and too little oversight, but at least Tommy Wiseau talks funny. Call me when this gets the Disaster Artist treatment by the mid-2030s.\n\n234. How It Ends\n\nDirector David M. Rosenthal takes The Road less traveled by, and unfortunately, it makes all the difference. Will (Theo James) and Tom (Forest Whitaker) blaze a path from Chicago to Seattle after a whopper of an earthquake threatens their mutually beloved Sam (Kat Graham), Will\u2019s fianc\u00e9e and Tom\u2019s daughter. A lopsided script deals them the usual barriers \u2014 roving gangs of ravagers, further weather cataclysms, injury \u2014 and when they do finally make it out West, what awaits them there pales in comparison to what they\u2019ve been through. The poor judgment extends to casting as well, with Whitaker acting circles around James. In a film economy besotted with end-times narratives, many of which can be streamed right from Netflix, there\u2019s little cause to bother with a below-average entry such as this.\n\n233. I Am Mother\n\nAs with Orbiter 9, this film also toys with the makeup of the Passengers blueprint, only sans the artful CGI that kept the former from total worthlessness. No such luck this time around, as a screamingly heavy-handed script drains all the tension from what\u2019s been designed to compress on itself like a pressure cooker. Distant future, uninhabitable world, hermetically sealed environment, last living girl (Clara Rugaard), android caretaker, you know the drill. A survivor from the outside (Hilary Swank) warns that the robot cannot be trusted; gee willikers, wonder if the Earth\u2019s atmosphere might not be so hostile after all? Not even a voice performance from Rose Byrne as Mother can bust through the thicket of boredom; for all we know, her contribution could have been literally phoned in. I demand to know who loved Passengers enough to have planted the seedling for this emergent trend.\n\n232. Naked\n\nThose in search of English filmmaker Mike Leigh\u2019s stupendous 1993 portrait of one unmoored drifter\u2019s search for meaning in life are in for a big surprise. They are also in for a whole lot of Marlon Wayans\u2019s bare ass. That\u2019s pretty much the whole joke in this Groundhog Day disciple: trapping the funnyman in an hour-long temporal loop that always begins with him waking up, birthday-suited, in an elevator. The tired \u201cimmature guy learns to sack up and accept the responsibility of adult love\u201d arc might be forgiven if the movie ensconcing it had the decency to be funnier.\n\n231. Maria\n\nLike a DJ set curated from the refuse bin at a record store condemned by the U.N., a diverse array of bad music forms the soundtrack (and lone distinguishing feature) of this Filipino beat-em-up. Korn-knockoff nu-metal, screamo, idiot-rawk like Andrew W.K. without the ebullient stage presence \u2014 all grating noise, from front to back. Submerged beneath the sonic onslaught, a female assassin clearly descended from the Besson lineage of lithe killers loses her husband and son, priming her for a berserker rage that\u2019ll leave a trail of snapped femurs in its wake. Such a baggy setup would suggest a display case for an elevated level of fight choreography or cinematography, but director Pedring Lopez and DP Pao Orendain forgot to come through with that much. They left behind a sluggish film that hustles only in brief spurts, and worst of all, they dropped in a cheeky reference to \u201cfake news\u201d for the amusement of\u2026 who, exactly?\n\n230. To Each, Her Own\n\nAnother culture-clash comedy to keep the International Collection cluttered, this one by way of France: Simone (Sarah Stern) doesn\u2019t have the brass ovaries to inform her devoutly Jewish family that she\u2019s married to Claire (Julia Piaton), and then starts to question her own identity as a lesbian when she gets the hots for a hunky Senegalese chef (Jean-Christophe Folly). If this came out in America, some PR flack would have known enough to work the \u201cproudly un-PC!\u201d angle, but because it comes from our less optics-conscious Gallic neighbors, it\u2019s just plain old racist. The script busts out every antiquated stereotype in the book, with plenty of unimaginative caricature to go around for the Jews, the Muslims, the LBTQ community, and whoever else might be curious enough to watch this best-forgotten cringefest.\n\n229. The Princess Switch\n\nSo, you\u2019ve mainlined both A Christmas Prince movies and your burgeoning addiction to regally themed holiday-specific entertainment has not been fully slaked. Stave off the shakes with this Prince and the Pauper-style trifle that sends Vanessa Hudgens to the Belgravian palace to compete in a reality show that is pointedly not related to The Great British Bake-Off. (Belgravia seems to be in Eastern Europe, though everyone has a crisp British accent, and Belgravia is a real place in the U.K. Just something to consider as you wait for the movie to end.) A swap-\u2019em-up between the lowly baker and her royal look-alike pairs the former with the next in line for the throne and the latter with the commoner\u2019s platonic BFF, and inexorably, the film shambles toward that thing where symmetrical-faced people end up together despite their relationship being founded on a trust-decimating lie. But Hudgens has the juice, and she\u2019d work wonders with a script capable of keeping up with her screwball moxie.\n\n228. Dry Martina\n\nIt is with a heavy heart that I must report that the title of this motion picture is indeed a pun, that the main character is a woman named Martina (Antonella Costa) and that she has literally gone dry down there as a result of her recent lack of sexual attention. The once-vivacious singer regains her zest for life when a woman claiming to be her long-lost sister pops up with her Don Juan-ish boyfriend in tow. Martina wastes no time luring the guy to bed, spoken-for as he may be, and setting off on what could be fairly characterized as an erotic rampage. It all sounds much saucier than it ends up being, with too much time frittered away on life-coach-type gum-flapping about finding yourself. More nettlesome still, director Che Sandoval sometimes stoops to gentle mockery of Martina\u2019s more lascivious side, as if there\u2019s something inherently comedic about the pairing of a woman in her fifties with the need to be touched.\n\n227. The Last Laugh\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a Netflix comedy about the enduring homosocial bond between an aging performer and his coot of an agent that isn\u2019t The Kominsky Method, then you\u2019re in luck. (And I\u2019ve got some questions about your way of seeing the world.) Greg Pritikin, director of the criminally underseen Adrien Brody vehicle Dummy, plugs Chevy Chase and Richard Dreyfuss into the the machine that takes in geriatric acting legends and spits out toothless jokes about dentures. Dreyfuss is the graying stand-up to Chase\u2019s agent in decline, but they\u2019re both delivering the same old tight five about the mind and body\u2019s slow, undignified breakdown. And as is the case with many comics of a certain age, there\u2019s some uncomfortably behind-the-times material in the mix \u2014 in the year 2019, why must we be made to watch a flirtation flower between Chase and Andie Macdowell?\n\n226. Orbiter 9\n\nOnly God and Ted Sarandos will ever know why, but Netflix seems to be willing to buy up just about any sci-fi project it can get its licensing contracts on. This Spanish-language beneficiary of that policy has a Passengers thing going on, with another sexy spaceship-dweller manipulated into intercourse under false pretexts with a man she doesn\u2019t realize is her captor. Director Hatem Khraiche sees the putrid foundation of this premise more clearly than Morten Tyldum ever did, but the lack of star power as a serviceable distraction leaves the match-up a wash. Let the record show that Passengers and Visually Lush Spanish Passengers are equally skippable!\n\n225. Bird Box\n\nNetflix trumpeted Susanne Bier\u2019s sense-swapped duplicate of A Quiet Place \u2014 the survivors of a post-apocalyptic infestation of \u2026 something must now live without sight, instead of speech \u2014 as their biggest blockbuster to date. There\u2019s a part of me that refuses to believe this, both because Netflix expects us to unquestioningly accept the veracity of data it has compiled, and because Bird Box is a tangibly stale take on a subgenre that\u2019s already been all but run into the ground. Then there\u2019s another part of me that does believe this, because Bier\u2019s workmanlike direction, Sandra Bullock\u2019s performance (best described as \u201cawake\u201d), and the Blacklist-damning writing are all baseline-digestible enough to make for a hit. \u201cDigestible\u201d emerges as the dominant descriptor for an unnotable film as thin as gruel, and that passes through you just as quickly.\n\n224. The Highwaymen\n\nYou may think that Bonnie and Clyde were a pair of sexy, morally ambiguous counterculture types thumbing their nose at John Q. Law and polite society, but that\u2019s only because you\u2019ve been brainwashed by Arthur Penn\u2019s anti-Establishment propaganda film from 1967. At least, that\u2019s the record that this pathetic work of geri-action wants to set straight. The two Texas Rangers (Kevin Costner and Woody Harrelson, tired) tasked with apprehending the no-goodniks insist that there\u2019s nothing compelling about two of the most fascinating figures in crime history, the corollary being that working as a cop and following the rules is the real bee\u2019s knees. Perhaps the reactionary politics wouldn\u2019t be such an annoyance if the the acting, writing, or photography were anything to write home about. But wooden turnouts from the two stars and a script the recalls the Community scene where Chevy Chase\u2019s Pierce fantasized about young people telling him he\u2019s still relevant are best left in its imagined past.\n\n223. Gnome Alone\n\nHere\u2019s a clarification I cannot believe I have to make: This film is in no way related to competing lawn-ornaments-sprung-to-life cartoon Gnomeo and Juliet, or its sequel, Sherlock Gnomes. (It also bears no relation to Call Me By Your Gnome, Gnomer Pyle U.S.M.C., or Gnome, Open City, which are movies I have made up.) Already, it should be apparent that these movies exist primarily because the \u201c-ome\u201d syllable lends itself to a wide variety of rhymes, and all it takes is one glance at the cast lists to identify who wore the wordplay better. World-renowned puppeteer Jeff Dunham, industry plant Becky G, \u201cVine star\u201d Nash Grier, Disney Channel grad Olivia Holt, and former Fall Out Boy guitarist Patrick Stump have convened for a rehash of the us-versus-them bedlam of Cats and Dogs or The Boss Baby, pitting the animate dwarves against grape-looking gremlins called Troggs. Love your children, love yourself, and just go with Gnomeo if the offspring insists on diminutive-sized fun.\n\n222. Secret Obsession\n\nWhat\u2019s so secret about this obsession, really? See if you can guess where this is headed: A pretty and otherwise trait-free amnesiac (Brenda Song) wakes up in a hospital to find her husband (Mike Vogel), who hastily notifies her that she has no job, family, or friends. He brings her back to his tucked-away home in the forest, but is it so the lovers can have some alone time, or because this guy\u2019s a psycho trying to plant false recollections? In no universe could it possibly be anything but that second one, and director Peter Sullivan\u2019s screenplay with Kraig Wenman can\u2019t even give grounds for its own existence beyond the final denouement\u2019s confirmation of what everyone already knew. Alfred Hitchcock understood that this game of suspense is all about the slow build; Sullivan barely stops to smell the blood-flecked roses on his way to a straightened-out twist that he can\u2019t see his audience seeing coming.\n\n221. Wine Country\n\nGene Siskel had a saying about his rubric for evaluating movies, that he\u2019d ask himself, \u201cIs this movie more interesting than a documentary about the same actors having lunch?\u201d Getting sketch luminaries Maya Rudolph, Rachel Dratch, Ana Gasteyer, Paula Pell, and Emily Spivey on the roster puts director Amy Poehler up against it, but still, she didn\u2019t have to whiff with such uncharacteristic laziness. They\u2019ve convened in Napa for Dratch\u2019s big five-oh, all of them hurtling towards their own equally mundane crises about crappy marriages and workaholism and health scares. For those readers under the impression that the film would be above pitting these adult women against one another in a series of behind-the-back kvetch-a-thons, congratulations, you have given Poehler too much credit. She coasts through the production with the same minimum of giving-a-shit that Adam Sandler brings to his Grown Ups franchise, eating up what must be half an hour with karaoke-singalong scenes sent from the deepest reaches of hell.\n\n220. Suzzanna: Buried Alive\n\nSomeone up there (at Netflix HQ) likes Rocky Soraya. His The 3rd Eye and Sabrina must have gone over like gangbusters with the suits, as they\u2019ve now bought another, decidedly lesser, film from the Indonesian genre madman. While those earlier movies lounged atop well-worn haunted-mansion eeriness, this one rests on mythology, specifically the hair-raising sundel bolong: Legend has it that women who die mid-pregnancy will give birth through a hole in their back while inside their grave, then return to intimidate those who wronged them in life until they\u2019re six feet under, too. That sounds like a wholly original horror concept \u2014 a commodity now more precious than gold \u2014 until Soraya falls back on Western visual language to bring the undead Suzzanna (Luna Maya) back to wheezing, dreadful life. However rooted in regional culture, this looks and moves like the least-attended title playing at your local AMC.\n\n219. Sometimes\n\nA notion that could be the stuff of great black-box theater turns into a limply mounted The More You Know advert in this single-issue drama imported from India. Seven strangers sit in a doctor\u2019s waiting room, all of them uncomfortable because the results of their HIV tests are on the way and they know there\u2019s one positive in the mix. Their forced, unnatural dialogue gracelessly outs them as hailing from different walks of life, going just short of superimposing the words \u201cit could happen to you, too!\u201d over the frame. Though that could have very well happened, as the film\u2019s not afraid to be as literal as possible; after the final scene, the production team shows up onscreen to fully spell out how serious the spread of AIDS has become in the subcontinent, but by that point, we all know.\n\n218. The 3rd Eye 2\n\nFor those wondering if an over-allotment of funds was the issue keeping The 3rd Eye from greatness, this sequel \u2014 Netflix\u2019s fourth Rocky Soraya joint, making him the closest thing Indonesia\u2019s got Adam Sandler \u2014 answers the question with a definitive \u201ctidak.\u201d That would be \u201cno,\u201d my overall reaction to a chintzy-looking film with zero impetus to push itself past the off-brand-Blumhouse standard that the series set just last year. Offing the little sister of hero Alia (Jessica Mila) at the starter\u2019s pistol hints at a shrewder refining of the material, but to no avail. Whatever isn\u2019t actively dragging down the film is on loan from somewhere else; mostly the previous installment, but one notably eerie illustration has been copied out of Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark. With production values bordering on the derelict, including one earthquake very clearly created by shaking the camera around, Soraya tests just how much coasting he can get away with, and finds that Netflix\u2019s limit does not exist.\n\n217. Sand Castle\n\nAfter a few cinematic treatments, a sense of character begins to crystallize for America\u2019s major wars: WWII was a noble mission, the brutality of which nobody could anticipate; Vietnam was an anything-goes quagmire of senseless chaos; and the post-9/11 war on terror has been defined by its lack of definition. This account of one American squadron\u2019s FUBAR efforts to repair a water pump in 2003 Iraq parrots back the analysis already put forth by other fictive postmortems: that sketchily defined parameters made this an unwinnable war, an occupation with no clearly demarcated start date, exit strategy, objective, enemy, or battles. Nicholas Hoult, to his credit, plays his reluctant soldier as a bit savvier than the usual bumpkin on a collision course with shell shock. But otherwise, Brazilian filmmaker Fernando Coimbra contributes nothing novel to the conversation.\n\n216. 5 Star Christmas\n\nA proper farce requires stopwatch-precise timing, allowing the manic momentum to mount and crest and subside in regimented beats. When that doesn\u2019t happen, the result looks a lot like this draining goof-about from Italy\u2019s risible Marco Risi. Prime Minister Franco Rispoli (Massimo Ghini) has to spend the holidays in Budapest on work \u2014 a perfect cover for a dalliance with his political rival and mistress, Senator Giulia Rossi (Martina Stella). When they discover a corpse in a Santa suit wedged in the window of their luxe hotel room, things get all fine settimana at Bernie\u2019s before going completely off the rails. In the commedia dell\u2019arte tradition, that feeling of naughty anarchy belies a tight-gripped control noticeably absent as Risi drags during lengths of tedium and sprints past one plot device after another to get to the resolution. And on top of all that, the gap in age and attractiveness between PM Rispoli and Senator Rossi is, in a word, noticeable.\n\n215. Someone Great\n\nThe Twitter commentariat has already gotten this one dead to rights with the diss juste: It\u2019s as if someone force-fed a computer program millennial slang until it choked to death, and its final croaks formed the dialogue of this script. During a big night-on-the-town send-off for Jenny (Gina Rodriguez) with ride-or-dies Blair (Brittany Snow) and Erin (DeWanda Wise) before she relocates to San Francisco for a choice Rolling Stone gig \u2014 please suspend all disbelief at the door \u2014 the gal pals talk in a pidgin of buzzwords and catchphrases that vaguely resembles a trending-topics chart. Stuck in their m\u00e9lange of up-to-the-second references is Lakeith Stanfield as Jenny\u2019s ex, flitting through flashbacks and living rent-free in her head. It\u2019s a classic rom-com switcheroo to reveal that the real romance was with the friends our gal has made, and the overlaid particulars of being young and poor in the New York media scene do little to spiff it up.\n\n214. \ufeffJo Pil-ho: The Dawning Rage\n\nAs the Coen brothers so wisely opined in the script for Barton Fink, when a screenwriter needs to soften a rough-and-tumble character, he gives them a dog or a kid. This Korean import takes the latter tack, assigning a corrupt officer of the law (Sun Kyun-lee) a distrustful teen (Jeon So-mi) to tag along as he goes on the lam from a sham real estate group\u2019s knuckle-cracking fixer (Park Hae-joon). Doesn\u2019t take a script doctor to predict that the two lone wolves will coax a newfound sense of virtue out of one another, and with that much squared away, there\u2019s little else to engage a viewer. The feats of martial arts never surpass the second-rate, Sun can\u2019t sell his character\u2019s transformation, and an isolated frame would be impossible to differentiate from the rest of Netflix\u2019s recent Korean acquisitions. Without Netflix, it would\u2019ve lived and died in obscurity, bothering nobody and wowing the same.\n\n213. What Happened to Monday\n\nThere\u2019s no denying that Noomi Rapace certainly does a lot of acting in this sci-fi dud, playing identical septuplets forced to live underground in a future society under a one-child policy. Each septuplet gets to stray out in the world under a shared identity for one day of the week, though they all have one distinctive character trait, Multiplicity style. A ludicrous conspiracy plot linking government officials and nefarious schemes to control the populace through resource withholding gives the film shape, explained through endless and interminable dumps of exposition and implausible turns of plot. (Of course Glenn Close did it. Glenn Close always did it!) Director Tommy Wirkola\u2019s fatal error was evidently blowing his entire budget on hairpieces; this film\u2019s wig budget makes RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u2019s wig budget look like Key & Peele\u2019s wig budget.\n\n212. The 3rd Eye\n\nWhile the intricacies of Netflix\u2019s acquisition criteria remain a mystery to the public, it outwardly appears that all a genre movie needs is one defining hook to set it apart from the rest of the lot. In the case of this Indonesian selection from Rocky Soraya, the notion that all human beings possess the latent ability to perceive supernatural activity, which only needs to be \u201cactivated,\u201d is what sets the film apart from rank-and-file J-horror. Throughout their girlhood, Abel (Bianca Hello) was plagued by visions of unnatural apparitions, while her sister Alia (Jessica Mila) wasn\u2019t sure what to believe. As young adults, they return to the house where they grew up following the death of their parents, and Alia starts to get a much clearer bead on the phantoms her sister once screamed about. Realized with a inadvertently charming lack of technical polish, the film cycles through the usual haunted-house tricks as steadily and as predictably as a carnival ride.\n\n211. Ali\u2019s Wedding\n\nActor Osamah Sami reworked his own memoir Good Muslim Boy and stars as an outsize version of himself in this unabashedly mawkish comedy of manners set among Australia\u2019s Muslim population. As Ali, Sami faces the same generational frictions as Kumail Nanjiani did in The Big Sick: parents turning up the heat on an arranged marriage when he\u2019s got his eye on someone of his own choosing, additional pressure to achieve in a field of little interest to him. Ali lies to his family about his med school test scores and sets a series of farces in motion, all as he pursues his crush Dianne (Helenna Sawires) in a lunge at personal agency. Though Jeffrey Walker\u2019s film won awards Down Under, an unbothered comfort with the hoariest of clich\u00e9s \u2014 he does the running-to-the-plane bit, and not even in an ironic way \u2014 makes a drag of this one.\n\n210. Irreplaceable You\n\nRemember that \u201cModern Love\u201d column where the woman dying of cancer makes her husband a dating profile so she can find him a suitable replacement? It\u2019s okay if you didn\u2019t, because this isn\u2019t based on that, though it might as well be. (Don\u2019t worry, Universal\u2019s got an authorized adaptation coming down the pipe.) Gugu Mbatha-Raw rejects her own limitations by fixing up love of her waning life Michiel Huisman, though of course she\u2019ll have to face her cold fate eventually. On the way to a banal final moral, director Stephanie Laing indulges in all manner of shameless emotional manipulations, the most egregious of which revolves around a rascally terminal patient portrayed by Christopher Walken. He puts a brave face on while withstanding suffering, both within and without the context of the film.\n\n209. Juanita\n\nAlfre Woodard gets her groove back in this menopausal comedy that just so happens to be written by her husband Roderick Spencer. Some may find it a bit strange that a white man would choose to center his first screenplay about mature black womanhood; some more eyebrows will rise when his script introduces Juanita as a self-described \u201cghetto clich\u00e9,\u201d caring for her unmarried daughter\u2019s baby as well as her adult son, who acts like one. She catches a bus to Butte, Montana, presumably a choice vacation spot for the Woodard-Roderick family, then gets her blood pumping by rehabilitating a flagging restaurant and shacking up with its fetching Native chef (Adam Beach). That all of the jokes fall flat is a straightforward enough issue \u2014 poor Blair Underwood, reduced to playing a version of himself sub-classified \u201cSex Fantasy Man\u201d \u2014 but passing off a glorified getaway as a work of art or entertainment is a touch more subtle in its insidiousness.\n\n208. The Climb\n\nIn 2005, a French-Algerian free spirit who had never set foot on a mountain in his life summited Everest through sheer force of will. Pride for his banlieue motivated him to keep going when the going got tough, holding up a sign marked \u201c93\u201d to shout them out when he reached the peak. In this fictionalized treatment of events, stand-in Samy (Ahmed Sylla) does it all for a girl, his sign now marked \u201cNadia\u201d at the unearned triumphant ending visible from several snowcapped miles away. Samy believes conquering the tallest mountain on the planet will prove to Nadia that he\u2019s reliable and win her love; as far as I can tell, it proves that he\u2019s impulsive and prone to highly impractical gestures of grandeur. Forcing this story into the mold of a romance negates the inspirational overtones and makes Nadia into a trophy awarded to Samy right on cue.\n\n207. Sabrina\n\nMaybe I\u2019m getting cynical, but I can\u2019t shake the suspicion that Netflix licensed this Indonesian creepshow for the purpose of conning an unsuspecting user looking for The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina into clicking. In my defense, though, there aren\u2019t many other reasons for Netflix to want the third installment of a little-known horror series not even regarded all that highly in its home nation. There\u2019s no need to bone up on the first two, both because the final chapter of Rocky Soraya\u2019s \u201cThe Doll\u201d trilogy bears little relation to the other entries, and because after however many Conjurings, American audiences know precisely what to expect from another bloodthirsty-doll movie. My research suggests that some encoded details will make this a richer experience for Indonesians and those familiar with the culture. As for me and my fellow ignoramuses, we can take the murderous plaything\u2019s spine-tingling eyeballs and leave the rest.\n\n206. Girls With Balls\n\nThe witless title is probably the worst thing about this low-rent horror entry crossing a ladies\u2019 volleyball team with a horde of devil worshippers. The best thing would be French acting legend Denis Lavant as the face-painted leader of that very cabal, going above and beyond his already lofty standard for goblinesque physicality. Everything in between falls just out of bounds, or goes wide, or whatever the proper sporting metaphor might be for this particular occasion. Point is, the film stretches its 77 minutes to maximum length with a feeble blend of lesbian humor, out-of-nowhere cowboy-musical selections, and noticeably professional makeup effects. (Director Olivier Afonso, behind the camera for the first time, hails from the faux-gore department in a long line of Z-movies past.) But even listing the incongruous elements making up this film runs the risk of piquing interest that it cannot generate itself. There\u2019s really nothing there.\n\n205. Clinical\n\nEverybody knows therapists are just as unwell as their patients, but Dr. Jane Mathis (Vinessa Shaw) has a little bit more going on upstairs than the usual head-case shrink. She\u2019s still haunted by the memory of a patient she couldn\u2019t save, and in a more literal capacity, by the girl\u2019s ghost. A new patient (Mad Men\u2019s Kevin Rahm, unrecognizable beneath his disfigured-face prosthetics) dredges up these painful remembrances for Jane, and might just create some new ones while he\u2019s at it. The horror elements are about as fearsome as lukewarm tapioca pudding, but the movie earns a couple points for experimenting with an unorthodox parallel structure of storytelling, as Jane\u2019s plot unfolds in tandem with her patient\u2019s recounting of his own tribulations.\n\n204. Yucat\u00e1n\n\nI swear, I\u2019m getting closer and closer to solving the riddle of Netflix\u2019s business model. Take this Spanish-language con game transplanting Dirty Rotten Scoundrels from the French Riviera to a luxury cruise liner: The much-touted popularity of Like Father surely compelled Netflix to seek out other vacation-ship-based entertainment, and with scamming currently on-trend, this was a no-brainer buy. Until the day that equations can account for quality, however, we\u2019re stuck with chasms of unfunniness such as this one. The scramble between competing hucksters to rip off a kindly old lottery winner is so base, so broad, so reliant on creaky stereotypes, you\u2019ll forget it\u2019s not French. The scene that strikes one dancer with a severe case of onstage diarrhea represents the film\u2019s lowest point, and yet that passage\u2019s guiding dim-wittedness colors everything that comes before and after.\n\n203. Anon\n\nI was rooting for you, Gattaca director Andrew Niccol, we were all rooting for you! He had proven himself a skilled conceptual alchemist ever since writing The Truman Show, magicking shaky ideas into forward-looking brilliance with nothing but good ol\u2019 scriptwriting. The big innovation of this sci-fi misstep is the Mind\u2019s Eye, a nonstop heads-up display located in the brain that makes everyday life look like a video game. Niccol has been wise about future panic up until now, when he alternately ignores and simplifies the implications of a complete eradication of privacy. He assigns a pat killer-on-the-loose plot to an intriguing hook, casting Clive Owen as the hard-nosed detective hunting a murderer off the universal grid, and Amanda Seyfried goes digital femme fatale as a woman mysteriously exempt from the omnipresent readout. Their individual arcs cannot hope to compete with the fascination of the world containing them, a world we\u2019re never permitted to fully explore. Substitute teachers looking to keep eighth-graders busy for an hour would be better off with another Gattaca rewatch.\n\n202. Close\n\nPlease, the term \u201cbodyguard\u201d is so pass\u00e9. The preferred nomenclature is \u201cclose protection officer,\u201d at least according to the no-nonsense Sam Carlson (an avatar for Jacquie Davis, respected in her field for keeping an eye on the likes of J.K. Rowling and the Royal Family). Noomi Rapace holds up her end of the bargain in the leading role, spitting gasoline as she ferries petulant heiress Zoe (Sophie N\u00e9lisse) through a mission gone belly-up in Morocco. Director Vicky Jewson does not, saddling Sam with emotional baggage that turns her own womanhood against her, and succumbing to her own paltry-budget limitations. Like the wall of motion-sensor shotguns, \u201cNoomi Rapace as mainstream action hero\u201d is a thought that should work in practice. But without sufficient funding and off-screen talent, she never stood a chance.\n\n201. In Family I Trust\n\nLight enough to be blown away by a single sneeze, this Spanish-language romcom sends another hapless single lady home to regroup and rediscover her inner goddess, or something. Those not immediately put off by the preceding sentence may have a better time with absolute ding-dong Bea (Clara Lago), who kicks the film off by setting her man up with a foxy newscaster she knows he has a crush on and then flipping her lid when they hook up. This writer, however, genuinely wished ill on the galumphing everygirl and every last member of her twee little family, from her straight-guy-gay-joke of a brother (Carlos Cuevas) to her faith healer mom (Carmen Maura, in a role strangely reminiscent of the \u201cI definitely have breast cancer\u201d lady). Bea finds refuge in the embrace of a widower with a souped-up hot-pink hot rod, the two perfect for one another in their equal proportions of dullardry.\n\n200. Mercy\n\nAdult children tend to show their true colors when their parents reach their deathbed. But divvying up possessions with Post-it notes is nothing compared to the lengths four half-brothers are willing to sink to just to get at their deteriorating mama\u2019s money. The \u201cbig broken family\u201d subset of drama gets an injection of horror when a gang of masked intruders storm the house, their employer and motivations unclear. They\u2019re obviously in cahoots with one of the brothers, and director-writer Chris Sparling posits which one made the call as the suspense-generating question, but he\u2019s made one fatal miscalculation: For that approach to work, the audience must first be given a reason, any reason at all, to care about what happens to these people. With each brother blander than the next, however, the big reveal wields all the dramatic heft of a balloon.\n\n199. Rock My Heart\n\nHold the damn phone \u2014 another work of hardcore inspiration-porn about a spunky white girl overcoming a debilitating medical condition to attain her equestrian dreams? Didn\u2019t Walk. Ride. Repeat. just come out, like, last month? In fact it did, and if anything, that\u2019s to this German doppelganger\u2019s benefit; by comparison, just about anything looks a touch less sappy. The broken bones have been exchanged for a heart condition and the older mentor has more bite, but aside from the language barrier, this film clip-clops along the exact same hoof tracks as its horsey forefather. (Which was, itself, following the trail of The Rider.) Who will defend this poor creature, so overtaxed as an analog for ornery characters learning discipline and control in bush-league indies? Have some mercy, directors, and cease beating a dead \u2014 oh, well, you know.\n\n198. Music Teacher\n\nNot to paint India or its cinema with too broad a brush, but it sure has plenty of movies about developmentally stunted men getting in touch with their feelings because of the efforts of tolerant, accommodating women. Take Beni (Manav Kaul), an educator with a chip on his shoulder and unrealized fantasies of musical superstardom. To make matters more agonizing, his former pupil Jyotsna (Amrita Bagchi) announces a homecoming concert after eight years of making a name for herself at the uppermost pop echelon. Will they find love? Duh-doy, but only after she helps him through the negativity he\u2019s still fostering, which raises the question of why she even bothers. She\u2019s young and famous and gorgeous, and he\u2019s \u2026 the main character. This is one of those romances at which a rational viewer can\u2019t help but yell, through a mouth filled with Ben & Jerry\u2019s, \u201cGIRL, YOU CAN DO SO MUCH BETTER.\u201d\n\n197. In the Shadow of Iris\n\nFrench erotic thrillers are like the beef stew of cinematic genres: Throw all the ingredients together in the pot, let everything get soft and savory, and it\u2019s nearly impossible to foul up. I wish I could explain to you how a film with such magnanimous proportions of asphyxiations and underbutt could still be so lethargic, but I\u2019m stumped myself. My suspects: the film\u2019s sanitized cinematography, which fights the lurid subject matter and comes, fittingly, from a man named Bastard; the dueling male leads, who are both personality vacuums; and the prime suspect, an unsporting attitude toward sexuality of the deviant variety. Erotic-thriller sex should be scary in a hot way, not scary in a 50 Shades of Grey way.\n\n196. Shimmer Lake\n\nSmarter than the average Coen Brothers ripoff (looking at you, Cut Bank), this one has the good sense to also be a Memento ripoff. Moving in reverse for no apparent reason, writer-director Oren Uziel squanders a handful of wonderful character actors (Michael Stuhlbarg has his fun even though his character belongs in a different, more interesting movie; Oliver Platt does a bang-up job with his haughty inspector) and some attractive photography on an ill-fated crime saga that resolves itself before it\u2019s even begun. As Uziel\u2019s clear inspiration Marge Gunderson might say, \u201cAnd for what? A little bit of money.\u201d\n\n195. Spectral\n\nWhat we have here is an expensive concept for a film (a small platoon of soldiers gets picked off by invisible foes, a conflict dutifully outed by critics as a variation on \u201cAliens goes Xbox\u201d) that has been granted perhaps half of the budget it needed to succeed. Throwing more money at a production rarely solves problems, but for a premise that wholly orients itself around the near-pornographic gazing upon military weaponry \u2014 much of it fantastical, engineered with futuristic technologies explained at length \u2014 looking good is everything. Without the required aesthetic polish, all that\u2019s left is a scrawny weakling flexing technical muscles it doesn\u2019t have.\n\n194. Brain on Fire\n\nSusannah Cahalan had it all: a great job writing for the New York Post, a devoted boyfriend, bright prospects. Just as it seemed like life couldn\u2019t get much better, she started acting strangely, blacking out for long spans of time, and behaving in an increasingly erratic manner. Cahalan\u2019s real-life account of frightened confusion at her own brain\u2019s rebellion didn\u2019t require much jazzing up for this dramatization, in which Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz portrays the walking medical mystery. As disturbing as the premise could be, director Gerard Barrett can\u2019t translate the internal psychological havoc to the visual medium quite so effectively. And while she certainly gives it her all, Moretz can\u2019t hope to outshine the poor script and listless lensing. A jumbled union of the medical thriller and psycho-terror, it\u2019s a waste of a perfectly good movie title.\n\n193. Candy Jar\n\nHe\u2019s a young paragon of black excellence with a pristine sense for matching sweaters to ties. She\u2019s a Type-A flibbertigibbet with an internal monologue that just won\u2019t quit. They don\u2019t see eye-to-eye on anything in this high-school comedy, but can these two master debaters put their differences aside long enough to win the state championship, find friendship, or maybe something more? Let me put it this way: Is there a peppy \u201cgettin\u2019 stuff done!\u201d montage? On both counts, the answer is a confidently intoned yes. It\u2019s as dull as it sounds, and only made worse by the despair of seeing Uzo Aduba and Christina Hendricks roped into this as the leads\u2019 respective moms. And that title? Not a symbol for anything, not even pertinent to the story, simply an object present in a faculty member\u2019s office. The title is an enigma more engrossing than the film containing it.\n\n192. Coin Heist\n\nCoins are amazing \u2014 designed using lasers, mass-produced through an elaborate assembly line of casting and forging, inspected down to the tiniest detail for flaws so minute only professionals can see them, and all for something we keep in our pockets only to trade for chewing gum. That said, it is a bad sign indeed when a viewer finds himself more interested in the quiet dignity of coin-making than in the plot of the film he\u2019s currently watching. This caper about a gang of high-schoolers who overcome their clique divisions to save their school by stealing $10 million is so tiresomely familiar \u2014 both as a heist movie and a teen movie \u2014 that watching it even for the first time already feels like a remote memory.\n\n191. To the Bone\n\nThe words \u201canorexia comedy\u201d rightly set off alarm bells, but a winning performance from Lily Collins nearly salvages this tonal tightrope walk. She\u2019s biting and inviting as a young artist in recovery for an intense eating disorder. Unfortunately, two worthwhile performances have gotten trapped in this otherwise maudlin film: there\u2019s Collins, and an unexpected turn from Keanu Reeves as a tough-love physician with a heart of gold. Ninety minutes of those two shooting sarcastic remarks back and forth would\u2019ve been dandy, but Alex Sharp and his intolerable romantic subplot have other plans.\n\n190. The Motive\n\nThey say you\u2019ve got to write what you know, but that poses a problem for \u00c1lvaro (Javier Guti\u00e9rrez), who has a paralyzing lack of inspiration and no shortage of literary ambition. Eager to prove to his accomplished novelist wife (Maria Le\u00f3n) that he\u2019s got the power of the pen, he begins to manipulate the residents of his apartment complex into unwittingly play-acting little domestic dramas he manufactures. The meta angle should open up all sorts of theoretical avenues about authenticity and the gap between real life and what feels like real life in fiction \u2014 and then it just, uh, doesn\u2019t. Director Manuel Mart\u00edn Cuenca lets \u00c1lvaro\u2019s misdeeds pile up until he\u2019s in way over his head, but he\u2019s only made to answer for his actions in the most superficial, how-will-he-get-out-of-this-one capacity. He turns what could have been Spain\u2019s reply to Adaptation. into something both Charlie Kaufman and \u201cCharlie Kaufman\u201d would sniff at.\n\n189. Unicorn Store\n\nNetflix\u2019s bestest friend Brie Larson made her directorial debut with this salute to sensitive artists who won\u2019t let a lack of skill or discipline stop them from following their muse. It is, regrettably, an apt pairing of auteur and subject. After auditioning and being rejected for the role years earlier, Larson gets the last laugh by leading as Kit, an art student booted from her program when a professor deems her Lisa Frank\u2013esque paintings insufficiently serious. (Also there\u2019s a unicorn. It\u2019s a metaphor \u2014 or is it?) In a film that can\u2019t decide whether it\u2019s for kids or for adults who think like them, that forgets to have an ending, and that would be unfunny if only we knew for certain it was angling toward comedy, that false-dilemma fallacy is the most high-priority issue. Childlike earnestness does not insulate art from criticism, or from being shitty, just as straight-facedness doesn\u2019t guarantee maturity.\n\n188. Bomb Scared\n\nYou thought eating disorders were a testy source for laughs? Here\u2019s the terrorism spoof you asked for! This Spanish-language comedy focuses on a dunderheaded gang of Basque-separatist extremists, impatiently awaiting their next mission while Spain makes a run at the World Cup in the background. Director Borja Cobeaga treats their mission to await instruction in a safe house like a tedious office job and the characters like bumbling wage slaves instead of radicalized killers. If that sounds like a trivial approach to a serious topic, the film\u2019s more mature understanding of how cells amass new members and perpetuate themselves saves quite a bit of face.\n\n187. 4 Latas\n\nA whole lot of desert separates Spain and the Malian city of Timbuktu, a huge tract of sand in which the sparseness allows for horseplay that wouldn\u2019t fly in more densely peopled climes. What better setting for a trip between amigos, the meat of this Spanish-language comedy on the move? Three buddies (one of whom is played by the reliable Jean Reno) made the schlep back in \u201979, and with one of them now on his deathbed in Africa, his pals and tagalong daughter (Susana Abaitua) retrace their steps one last time in his vintage ride. (The title refers to the regional nickname of their Renault 4, a best-selling French hatchback ubiquitous during the \u201970s.) The film does everything that films about oldsters taking to the road have trained us to anticipate: drug experiences all in good fun, May-December pairings for the shoehorned hints of romance, chin-up humor about the impending visit from the Grim Reaper. Like most food for old people, it\u2019s soft and goes down with minimal difficulty but lacks in spiciness.\n\n186. The Lighthouse of the Orcas\n\nSpain\u2019s Gerardo Olivares goes into manual override on the audience\u2019s water works in this tragic bedtime story, forcibly cranking the dials to 11 with facile pathos-bait. A mother (Maribel Verd\u00fa) whisks her autistic son (Joaqu\u00edn Rapalini) away to Patagonia when the unresponsive boy suddenly perks up upon seeing majestic orca whales on the television. Putting down new roots in a rustic village as picturesque as a South American Nancy Meyers set, they fall in with a hunky whale trainer (Joaqu\u00edn Furriel) and form a surrogate family unit too pure to last in a compromised world. Set aside the fact that Olivares clearly believes the autistic possess the ability to commune with animals on a telepathic level, as well as the throw-up-your-hands-in-futile-frustration ending \u2014 what right does he have to play the \u201csad little kid\u201d card, having done none of the character work to earn it? The boy\u2019s an abstraction, and a crudely drawn one at that.\n\n185. Battle\n\nWith the notable exception of Wim Wenders\u2019s Pina, dance movies are never really about dance. They\u2019re usually about something more pedestrian, like \u201cfinding yourself\u201d or \u201csharing common ground\u201d or, in the case of this Norwegian hoof-off, both. From the director\u2019s chair, Katarina Launing upholds the obligatory classical-versus-modern dichotomy with a one-two-step plotline stripping a spoiled ballerina (Lisa Teige, whose presence on internationally known teen soap Skam could explain how this ended up on Netflix\u2019s radar) of Daddy\u2019s wealth and sending her to an inner-city rec center to learn hip-hop. One hopes that top-flight choreography might pick up the slack left by cookie-cutter writing, but alas, these Scandinavian posers have already been served by their American cousins. Skam-heads aside, best moonwalk your way to Step Sisters instead.\n\n184. \u00c1nimas\n\nAh, the imaginary friend twist: easily bungled, often unnecessary, pretty much a death wish for anyone not named David Fincher. That won\u2019t stop Laura Alvea and Jose F. Ortu\u00f1o, the writing-directorial team behind this world-out-of-whack thriller brought to our fair shores from Spain and Belgium. They want us to furrow our brows over the relationship between teenaged abuse survivor Bram (Iv\u00e1n Pellicer) and \u00c1lex (Clare Durant), his confidante and support system. When we should be pondering whether \u00c1lex may be jealous over Bram\u2019s interest in hot-to-trot Anchi (Chacha Huang), we\u2019re actually wondering why no one else seems to interact with or even be aware of \u00c1lex\u2019s basic existence. Until, of course, we figure out the game \u2014 at which point all that remains are some eye-catching diversions with pink, green, and yellow, along with a few practical effects shots not worth writing home about. There is only one Tyler Durden.\n\n183. The Resistance Banker\n\nJust when you thought every conceivable angle had been taken on the Holocaust movie, in comes Dutch filmmaker Joram L\u00fcrsen to make dramatic hay from the white-knuckle thrills of money-lending. The Netherlands\u2019s choice to represent the nation at the Oscars this year, this period piece digs into the nitty-gritty of how revolutions stay afloat through the story of a banker who dared to fund the anti-Nazi forces. The first half digs deep into the logistics of finance, so deep that those viewers not bringing their A-game may lose sight of the surface, though those who find such talk fascinating will appreciate that L\u00fcrsen\u2019s done his homework. Walraven van Hall is no Oskar Schindler \u2014 though this biopic wants him to be so very badly \u2014 and star Barry Atsma does a commendable job of giving this real-life human being an identity of his own. Still, this film and Schindler\u2019s List share all the same preoccupations and insecurities, making the question of \u201cdoes activism still count if you profit off of it?\u201d a bit redundant here.\n\n182. White Fang\n\nFor students weaseling their way out of reading Jack London\u2019s classic wolfdog bildungsroman for a class assignment, this animated adaptation could be a godsend. For those of us who aren\u2019t prepping a book report: The animation is weird and yet not weird enough to be morbidly captivating, the sketchy Native American spirit-world business is very much of a piece with its turn-of-the-century era, and the live-action Ethan Hawke version from 1991 hasn\u2019t gone anywhere. Even comfort-food vocal performances from Rashida Jones and Nick Offerman in a mini Parks and Rec reunion do little to perk up this neutered take on London\u2019s writing. His White F", "description": "From \u201cRoma\u201d and \u201cBuster Scruggs\u201d to \u201cBird Box\u201d and \u201cBright,\u201d we rank every Netflix original movie that\u2019s ever been made.", "authors": ["Charles Bramesco"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/02/13/13-netflix-film-ranking-update.w1200.h630.jpg"}
