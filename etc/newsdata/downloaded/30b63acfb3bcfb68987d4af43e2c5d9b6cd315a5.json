(AP) - California will be without starting quarterback Chase Garbers indefinitely because of an apparent shoulder injury he suffered in Friday\u2019s loss to Arizona State.\n\nGarbers was scrambling when he fell on his throwing arm late in the second quarter against the Sun Devils. After being taken to the locker room for examination, Garbers emerged in the second half wearing a splint.\n\nCoach Justin Wilcox declined on Monday to say what the nature or severity of Garbers injury is, saying only that it is an upper body injury.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s kind of all we can say about it,\u201d Wilcox said. \u201cI understand the interest. There\u2019s only so much we can say. He\u2019ll be back hopefully as fast as humanly possible.\u201d\n\nA redshirt sophomore who split time as a starter in 2018, Garbers was coming off his best game with the Golden Bears after throwing for a career-best 357 yards and four touchdowns in a win at Mississippi on Sept. 21.\n\nGarbers led Cal on an early scoring driving against Arizona State and was 9 of 12 for 177 yards and a touchdown before getting hurt.\n\n\u201cI thought he was really coming into his own,\u201d Wilcox said. \u201cEven in that game, he finished 9 of 12 and two of (the incompletions) were dropped. So you feel for him. He puts a ton of time in this too. But it\u2019s part of it. It\u2019ll be next man up.\u201d\n\nDevon Modster, a transfer from UCLA who struggled in the second half after replacing Garbers, will start Saturday against at No. 13 Oregon. Modster was 5 of 14 for 23 yards and an interception in the end zone against Arizona State. Afterward, he called his performance terrible.\n\n\u201cI definitely think he can play better,\u201d Wilcox said. \u201cWe have confidence in Devon and the rest of the guys to step up to the challenge.\u201d\n\nModster completed 51 of 79 attempts for 671 yards and four touchdowns during one season with UCLA. He was forced to sit out Cal\u2019s first three games this season because of transfer rules and wasn\u2019t eligible until Sept. 21.\n\nWilcox expects the Bears to make subtle schematic changes with Modster at quarterback.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like you make a wholesale change to the offense but there\u2019s certain things that Devon does that maybe we lean a little bit more on,\u201d Wilcox said. \u201cBut a lot of the structure will look similar.\u201d\n\nThe loss to the Sun Devils knocked the Golden Bears out of the Top 25. Cal\u2019s No. 15 ranking was its highest in a decade.\n\n__\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "California will be without starting quarterback Chase Garbers indefinitely because of an apparent shoulder injury he suffered in Friday's loss to Arizona State.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Michael Wagaman"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/30/arizona_state_california_football_85881_c0-142-3400-2124_s1770x1032.jpg?c52a0096a216a79ba5fcf65096afe65401717e03", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
