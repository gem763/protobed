The bill, which would have allowed suspects to be sent to mainland China for trial in courts controlled by the Communist party, prompted months of protests before Lam agreed last month to withdraw it.\n\nCiting people briefed on the discussions on Lam, the Financial Times reported that Beijing plans to replace her next year. The chief executive has become a lightning rod for sweeping protests over fears Beijing is tightening its grip and limiting the freedoms enjoyed under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d principle enshrined when Britain handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997.\n\nHong Kong leader forced to deliver key speech via video after protests Read more\n\nSpeculation over Lam\u2019s future came as a man whose murder case prompted the the extradition bill was released from prison.\n\nChan Tong-kai, who is alleged to have killed his pregnant girlfriend while on holiday in Taiwan, was freed from a Hong Kong jail on Wednesday morning after serving 18 months for money laundering. Chan, who cannot be tried in Hong Kong for a crime committed in Taiwan, was charged for stealing funds from his girlfriend.\n\nLam\u2019s government had argued for changing its fugitives law to allow suspects to be sent to jurisdictions where Hong Kong does not have extradition agreements, like Taiwan, Macau, as well as mainland China, in order to plug the loopholes exposed in cases like Chan\u2019s.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Chan Tong-kai, a Hong Kong citizen who was accused of murdering his girlfriend in Taiwan last year, leaves from Pik Uk Prison Photograph: Tyrone Siu/Reuters\n\nSpeaking outside of the maximum security Pik Uk Correctional Institution, Chan bowed and said he had made the \u201cworst mistake\u201d of his life and said he was willing to hand himself over to Taiwan authorities now he was out of jail in Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cFor my impulsive act and the things I did wrong, I am willing to surrender myself to Taiwan to face sentencing,\u201d he said.\n\nChan has previously said he would be willing to surrender himself to Taiwan authorities. In response to allegations he had been coerced, Hong Kong officials said his decision was \u201cpurely out of his own free will.\u201d In a statement on Sunday, the government said: \u201cAllegations that Chan was manipulated to surrender or his decision was out of political manoeuvring are totally groundless.\u201d\n\nHong Kong on Wednesday rejected a request from Taiwan to send law enforcement officers to escort Chan to Taiwan, where he faces murder charges, and said Taiwan\u2019s offer was \u201cdisrespectful\u201d to Hong Kong\u2019s jurisdictional power.\n\nTaiwan had previously refused to allow Chan to surrender himself, demanding instead the establishment of a mutual legal assistance framework with Hong Kong first. Taiwan president Tsai Ing-wen has called the Hong Kong government \u201cirresponsible\u201d for how it is dealing with Chan\u2019s case.\n\nThe withdrawal of the extradition bill is unlikely to calm protests, as protesters promise to keep demonstrating until all of their demands are met. Other demands include Lam standing down as well as an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality during the protests.\n\nOn Wednesday, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying rejected the Financial Times report, calling it \u201crumour\u201d backed by ulterior motives.\n\nSources told the Financial Times that officials in China wanted a stabilised situation before a final decision can be made on any leadership changes, because they did not want to be seen to be giving in to violence.\n\nIf Chinese president Xi Jinping decides to go ahead, Lam\u2019s successor would be appointed by March and cover the remainder of her term, which ends in 2022, the newspaper said.\n\nAccording to the FT, Lam\u2019s top successors include a former head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Norman Chan, and Henry Tang, who has also served as the territory\u2019s financial secretary and chief secretary for administration, the report said.\n\n\u201cOriginally they were going to wait to take action until unrest settles down. Now there seems like there is no end. It\u2019s now concluded that there\u2019s no expected timeline for the unrest to stop. We\u2019re just going to create more and more damage,\u201d said Michael Tien, a pro-Beijing legislator.\n\nTien said he had not been part of any briefings about Lam\u2019s stepping down but has been aware of discussions of the possibility since August. \u201cThe [Chinese Communist Party] will never, never not hold anyone accountable,\u201d he said.\n\nIn September, in response to a Reuters report about a recording of Lam saying she would step down if she could, Lam said she had never asked the Chinese government to let her resign to end the Chinese-ruled city\u2019s political crisis.\n\nAlthough the extradition bill was finally withdrawn, the protests have continued, defying police rulings banning them.\n\nChina has denied accusation it is eroding the freedoms granted in 1997, and has blamed foreign nations such as the United States and Britain for inciting unrest.", "description": "Speculation over Hong Kong chief executive\u2019s future comes as man whose murder case prompted the extradition bill is released from prison", "authors": ["Lily Kuo"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9972f19281bd817568b4e7a93a225bc77a173c0/0_21_2161_1297/master/2161.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7e5eb0a23b50f37be5c0acaa595d1009", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
