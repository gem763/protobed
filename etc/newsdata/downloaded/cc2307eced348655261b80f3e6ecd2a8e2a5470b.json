SIMONS ISLAND, Ga.\u2014Rescuers scoured the Georgia coast on Sunday for four missing crew members of a cargo ship that overturned and caught fire, but the efforts ran into trouble due to flames and instability of the ship, the U.S. Coast Guard said.\n\nThe Golden Ray cargo ship\u2019s problems began Sunday morning when it listed heavily and rolled on its side in St. Simons Sound near the Port of Brunswick with 23 crew members and one pilot on board.\n\nCoast Guard Capt. John Reed said 20 were safely evacuated from the ship before rescuers determined the situation was too risky to go further inside the vessel.\n\nCapt. Reed said rescue teams were trying to stabilize the 656-foot vehicle carrier to continue their search for the missing crew members, but they have been unable to determine if the fire is still burning. The Coast Guard tweeted Sunday afternoon that one of its groups, called the Atlantic Strike Team, was preparing to go to the site to assess what it called a complex situation. \u201cOnce salvage professionals have determined the vessel to be stable, we will identify the best option to continue our rescue efforts for the four crew members who remain on board,\u201d Capt. Reed said at a news conference Sunday afternoon. Search and rescue operations involve federal, state and local agencies. Coast Guard Lt. Lloyd Heflin said rescuers remained on the scene. \u201cThey continue to do what they can. It is a complex situation. We\u2019re looking not just for the safety to be able to rescue the people that are on board, but also to be able to provide safety for our crew. It\u2019s ongoing,\u201d he said. The Coast Guard said it was notified by a 911 call at about 2 a.m. Sunday of a capsized vessel. The cause of the incident remains under investigation. Petty Officer third Class Ryan Dickinson said it isn\u2019t clear if weather conditions caused the ship to lurch. Hurricane Dorian brushed past the Georgia coast last week before being downgraded to a posttropical cyclone. The Coast Guard said the overturned ship hasn\u2019t released any pollutants, but mitigation responses are ready in case they are needed. The Golden Ray, which the Coast Guard said was transporting cars, is flagged out of the Marshall Islands and was headed to Baltimore, according to the website vesselfinder.com. The ship\u2019s registered owner is a South Korean company. The Port of Brunswick is currently closed to vessel traffic, with an established emergency safety zone in St. Simons Sound. Vessels aren\u2019t authorized within a half mile of the Golden Ray. The port is one of the busiest U.S. seaports for shipping automobiles. Nearly 614,000 vehicles and heavy machinery units moved across its docks in the 2019 fiscal year that ended June 30, according to the Georgia Ports Authority. \u2014Copyright 2019, the Associated Press.\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
