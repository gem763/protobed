(AP) \u2014 \u201cI\u2019d like to thank the academy\u201d is a phrase many only ever get to say in front of their bathroom mirrors. But 16 student filmmakers actually got to utter those words on stage Thursday at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science in Beverly Hills.\n\nNot only that: They\u2019re all also eligible to compete in the 2020 Academy Awards. That\u2019s the power of the Student Academy Awards, an event that is now in its 46th year.\n\nIt was an emotional night for many, like Kalee McCollaum of Brigham Young University.\n\n\u201cI never thought those words would come out of my mouth,\u201d she said on the stage flanked by two giant Oscar statuettes in the Samuel L. Goldwyn theater. McCollaum won the gold medal for animation for her short, \u201cGrendel.\u201d\n\nWinners are now eligible for the animated short, live action short and documentary short categories at the Oscars.\n\nPhil Lord and Chris Miller, who co-directed \u201cThe Lego Movie,\u201d presented the animation awards, deadpanning that \u201cno one ever thanks the presenter.\u201d\n\n\u201cI opened three envelopes, I got two paper cuts,\u201d Miller said.\n\nWinners join an esteemed list of past Student Academy Award winners like Pete Docter, Cary Fukunaga, Spike Lee, Patricia Riggen and Robert Zemeckis.\n\n\u201cQueen & Slim\u201d director Melina Matsoukas, who presented the narrative awards, said she had joked earlier about how she was never invited to the awards when she was a film student.\n\n\u201cNow I understand why, that was incredible,\u201d Matsoukas said, following a highlight reel of the projects.\n\nZoel Aeschbacher, of Switzerland, took the gold prize in the international narrative category for his drama, \u201cBonobo,\u201d about how a broken elevator affects the residents of a public housing unit.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting the gold one,\u201d he said, nervously telling the audience that he bought a special suit for the event.\n\nPrincess Garrett, of Villanova University, who won for her documentary short, \u201cSankofa,\u201d about the loss of African identity in black males, gave a spirited speech alongside her large crew.\n\n\u201cBeing complacent is not the answer,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cIf you are not fighting to end the problem, you are the problem.\u201d\n\nSome were a little less enthusiastic about the spotlight, however.\n\n\u201cAfter all those speeches I think I might be too shy for this kind of situation,\u201d said Yifan Sun, of Poland, who won the gold medal in the international documentary category for \u201cFamily,\u201d about a girl adopted by a Belgian family who finds her birth family in China.\n\nPresenter Rory Kennedy assured her that she did \u201ca fantastic job.\u201d\n\nAnd Asher Jelinsky, who is gender nonbinary, won the domestic narrative category for \u201cMiller & Son,\u201d about a trans woman who works at an auto shop during the day and can be herself at night. Authenticity in casting was of utmost importance to Jelinsky.\n\n\u201cThis film would have not been nearly as impactful without your talent,\u201d Jelinsky said to the film\u2019s star, Jesse James Keitel.\n\nThere were 1,615 entries from 360 colleges and universities around the world. Categories recognized include narrative, documentary, animated and alternative/experimental productions by American and international college students.\n\nWinners are voted on by members of the film academy. This year a record 752 members participated.\n\nThe Student Academy Awards is a tradition dating back to 1973 that helps spotlight emerging talent. Tickets to the ceremony are free to the public, who stand in line outside hoping to get a spot in the room.\n\n\u201cYou are the future of film: a future that is diverse, international and very bright,\u201d said film academy president David Rubin. \u201cOn behalf of all the members of the academy, we can\u2019t wait to see the stories you next tell.\u201d\n\nThe 2019 Student Academy Award winners:\n\n\u2014 \u201cPatron Saint,\u201d Georden West, Emerson College\n\n\u2014 \u201cGame Changer,\u201d Aviv Mano, Ringling College of Art and Design\n\n\u2014 \u201cGrendel,\u201d Kalee McCollaum, Brigham Young University\n\n\u2014 \u201cTwo,\u201d Emre Okten, University of Southern California\n\n\u2014 \u201cDaughter,\u201d Daria Kashcheeva, Film and TV School of the Academy of Performing Arts, Prague\n\n\u2014 \u201cAll That Remains,\u201d Eva Rendle, University of California, Berkeley\n\n\u2014 \u201cSankofa,\u201d Princess Garrett, Villanova University\n\n\u2014 \u201cSomething to Say,\u201d Abby Lieberman and Joshua Lucas, Columbia University\n\n\u2014 \u201cFamily,\u201d Yifan Sun, The Polish National Film, Television and Theatre School, Lodz\n\n\u2014 \u201cMiller & Son,\u201d Asher Jelinsky, American Film Institute\n\n\u2014 \u201cThe Chef,\u201d Hao Zheng, American Film Institute\n\n\u2014 \u201cTree #3,\u201d Omer Ben-Shachar, American Film Institute\n\n\u2014 \u201cBonobo,\u201d Zoel Aeschbacher, Ecole Cantonale d\u2019Art de Lausanne (ECAL)\n\n\u2014 \u201cDog Eat Dog,\u201d Rikke Gregersen, Westerdals Kristiania University College\n\n\u2014 \u201cNovember 1st,\u201d Charlie Manton, National Film and Television School", "description": "BEVERLY HILLS, Calif.
