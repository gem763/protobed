There is a valuable role for packaging, but it must always be collected, recycled and reused.'\n\nCoca-Cola, whose other brands include Fanta and Sprite, says it hopes consumers will start to see bottles made with plastic using enhanced recycling technology on the shelves by next year.\n\nThe Mail led a campaign calling for a charge on plastic bags which has hugely reduced the number given out by supermarkets each year.\n\nIt has also successfully called for a ban on plastic microbeads in cosmetics, and is campaigning for a deposit return scheme for plastic bottles.", "description": "Volunteers collected plastic waste from 84 beaches in Spain and Portugal that was combined with similar waste taken from the Mediterranean to make the bottles.", "authors": ["James Tozer For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/00/19276704-0-image-a-166_1570145365499.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
