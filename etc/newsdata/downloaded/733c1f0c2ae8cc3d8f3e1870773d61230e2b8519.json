Quite an extravaganza is planned, even as protesters in Hong Kong plan a counter-rally. China's opposition to democracy in Hong Kong and in China itself is not just the recalcitrance of cranky old men. It's part of the Chinese Communist state's founding mission.\n\nTake the speech of Mao Zedong on July 1, 1949, as his Communist armies neared victory. The speech was titled, \u201cOn the People\u2019s Democratic Dictatorship.\u201d Instead of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, it spoke of \u201cthe extinction of classes, state power and parties,\u201d of \u201ca socialist and communist society,\u201d of the nationalization of private enterprise and the socialization of agriculture, of a \u201cgreat and splendid socialist state\u201d in Russia,and especially of \u201ca powerful state apparatus\u201d in the hands of a \u201cpeople\u2019s democratic dictatorship.\u201d\n\nTragically, unbelievably, this vision appealed not only to many Chinese but even to Americans and Europeans, some of them prominent. But from the beginning it went terribly wrong, as really should have been predicted. Communism created desperate poverty in China. The \u201cGreat Leap Forward\u201d led to mass starvation. The Cultural Revolution unleashed \u201can extended paroxysm of revolutionary madness\u201d in which \u201ctens of millions of innocent victims were persecuted, professionally ruined, mentally deranged, physically maimed and even killed.\u201d Estimates of the number of unnatural deaths during Mao\u2019s tenure range from 15 million to 80 million. This is so monstrous that we can\u2019t really comprehend it. What inspired many American and European leftists was that Mao really seemed to believe in the communist vision. And the attempt to actually implement communism leads to disaster and death.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "A terrible regime.", "authors": ["David Boaz"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6lGzr5svPYXa9Irsx.3bZQ--~B/aD05NjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/086fc926e9455fb52d7d3da5346e96a1", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
