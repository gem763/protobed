Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, at a news conference on Capitol Hill on Oct. 2. (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg News)\n\nThe doorway is narrowing for President Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to broker a deal on lowering drug prices as Democrats pursue impeachment \u2014 but neither side has shut the door quite yet.\n\nAdministration officials met early this month with top Pelosi health aide Wendell Primus to discuss the speaker\u2019s drug pricing proposal, for which the Congressional Budget Office released a partial cost estimate on Friday. The White House has notably refrained from criticizing the Pelosi bill \u2014 which would allow the federal government to directly negotiate lower prices for hundreds of Medicare drugs \u2014 even as congressional Republicans slam it.\n\nIndeed, the Pelosi bill contains plenty that Trump might like, including tying some prices in Medicare to lower prices in other advanced economies \u2014 an approach the president has sought as a way to stop foreign \u201cfreeloading\u201d off higher prices in the United States. Lobbyists and wonks say it\u2019s possible to imagine a path forward for Trump and Pelosi, who have both promised to take on the high cost of prescription drugs.\n\nBut what began as a bipartisan effort this year could easily fracture as political tensions rise \u2014 and nothing ultimately happens to reduce the skyrocketing prices borne by American patients.\n\n\u201cA bipartisan deal seems highly unlikely at this point,\u201d said Shawn Gremminger, senior director of federal relations for the liberal patient advocacy group Families USA, adding that \u201cit was only ever going to happen with Trump leaning hard on wary Senate Republicans.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith that not likely at this point, it is hard to see how a compromise can actually happen,\u201d he said. \u201cPlus, progressive voices making the case to not \u2018give Trump a win\u2019 on drugs are only growing louder, meaning even that side is likely to back off.\u201d\n\nBiden and his son Hunter Biden attend an NCAA basketball game in 2010. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)\n\nThe impeachment wheels will certainly be turning as Congress returns to Washington today after a two-week break:\n\n\u2014U.S. ambassador Gordon Sondland \u2014 who will be asked about Trump\u2019s efforts to persuade Ukraine to investigate former vice president Joe Biden \u2014 will be deposed before House investigators on Thursday.\n\n\u2014On a Friday call with her caucus, Pelosi emphasized the focus of the inquiry should remain on Trump\u2019s interactions with Ukraine, even as some Democrats have suggested the probe should be expanded.\n\n\u201cDemocrats are doubling down on their Ukraine probe at lightning speed, scheduling additional closed-door depositions with Trump officials, including former National Security Council official Fiona Hill, and issuing new subpoenas to Trump associates for documents,\u201d my colleagues Rachael Bade and Mike DeBonis report.\n\nWith this backdrop, it\u2019s difficult to imagine all the pieces coming together for drug pricing changes, which would be difficult even under the best of circumstances. Pelosi has said she will continue negotiating on drug pricing even amid the impeachment investigation, but Trump called it a \u201ccamouflage\u201d as she seeks election wins next year.\n\nNancy Pelosi just said that she is interested in lowering prescription drug prices & working on the desperately needed USMCA. She is incapable of working on either. It is just camouflage for trying to win an election through impeachment. The Do Nothing Democrats are stuck in mud! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 2, 2019\n\nThen there\u2019s the intense opposition from the pharmaceutical industry, whose influential lobbying group held a media briefing last week to lay out its opposition to not just the Pelosi bill but also a bipartisan proposal from the Senate Finance Committee.\n\n\u201cThis will have a huge, negative impact on our members, but also for the ecosystem as a whole,\u201d Stephen Ubl, president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, told reporters on Thursday. \u201cThis would be nuclear winter for organizations that rely on private investment for financing.\u201d\n\nIn a shift from where PhRMA has stood in the past, Ubl notably said he\u2019s open to and even wants legislation to lower drug prices \u2014 as long as it\u2019s \u201cbalanced.\u201d\n\nThe group supports legislation called the Creates Act, which would prevent branded drugmakers from guarding their medications so other companies can't develop alternatives. But it especially wants a ban on rebates drugmakers pay to pharmacy benefit managers and a cap on patient out-of-pocket costs in Medicare \u2014 both of which would raise costs for insurers, not drugmakers.\n\n\u201cI think we would like to see a balanced package emerge from the legislative process this year \u2026 as long as that product is balanced, that we actually solve the problems,\u201d Ubl said.\n\nUbl said it would be \u201cunfortunate\u201d were the impeachment proceedings to derail drug pricing legislation \u2014 and said he thinks there is still room for a bipartisan deal.\n\n\u201cI think both the administration and Congress have a vested interest in some form of legislative accomplishment,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump speaks during a campaign rally at the Lake Charles Civic Center on Friday. (Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nTo Ubl\u2019s point, lawmakers and policymakers are certainly talking a lot about drug pricing restructuring, both publicly and behind the scenes.\n\nAdministration officials have met with Republican Hill staffers, who would have a lot of work to convince their bosses to get on board with legislation allowing direct negotiations in Medicare. Republican staffers with the Energy and Commerce Committee and Ways and Means Committee hosted industry lobbyists in meetings last week, an aide told me.\n\nJoe Grogan, head of the White House Domestic Policy Council, said he and other officials had a \u201cgreat\u201d conversation with Primus when they met to discuss a path forward. Grogan said he thinks there\u2019s \u201can opportunity\u201d to get there \u2014 but also said \u201cit is a shame that [Democrats] have gotten distracted at this point.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see how all this stuff around impeachment ends,\u201d Grogan said at an event held by the research firm Prevision Policy.\n\nYou are reading The Health 202, our must-read newsletter on health policy.

She didn't know to report monhtly wages and work hours.(Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)\n\nAHH: A panel of federal appeals court judges appeared skeptical about the Trump administration allowing states to mandate that some adults work to maintain Medicaid coverage, our Post colleague Amy Goldstein writes.\n\nA Justice Department attorney, Alisa Klein, told judges that the administration believes work requirements improve people\u2019s health and can help them toward getting jobs and acquiring private health plans, which would alleviate the burden on public funds.\n\nBut during oral arguments in a pair of cases over Medicaid work requirements in Arkansas and Kansas, all three judges repeatedly said senior Trump health officials had neglected to consider that people would lose health insurance under the new rules, Amy writes.\n\n\u201cThe other things you say may be laudable goals, but to say they outweigh the principal goal [of Medicaid] seems a bit strange,\u201d Judge David B. Sentelle, the only Republican on the panel, told the attorney.\n\nThe cases could have major consequences for other states that have sought to implement such requirements.\n\nA new barrier is built along the Texas-Mexico border near downtown El Paso in January. (Eric Gay/AP)\n\nOOF: Federal judges in New York, California and Washington state ruled against the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cpublic charge\u201d rule to block immigrants from acquiring green cards if they are dependent or may become dependent on public benefits such as Medicaid.\n\nThe rule, which was set to take effect on Tuesday, would assess immigrants\u2019 use of services including food stamps, housing or health care. The judges' decisions were the latest setback for the administration that has prioritized efforts to tighten the nation\u2019s immigration system, our Post colleague Nick Miroff reports. New York Judge George B. Daniels called the rule \u201cunlawful, arbitrary and capricious.\u201d\n\nKen Cuccinelli, the acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, signaled the administration would appeal. \u201cAn objective judiciary will see that this rule lies squarely within long-held existing law,\u201d Cuccinelli said in a statement. \u201cLong-standing federal law requires aliens to rely on their own capabilities and the resources of their families, sponsors, and private organizations in their communities to succeed. The public charge regulation defines this long-standing law to ensure those seeking to come or stay in the United States can support themselves financially and will not rely on public benefits.\u201d\n\n\u201cU.S. immigration laws have long held provisions allowing the government to bar immigrants who are considered at risk of becoming dependent on public support, but the Trump administration\u2019s initiative would expand the types of benefits that could be taken into consideration, including Medicaid, food assistance and federal housing vouchers,\u201d Nick reports. \u201cImmigrant advocates and officials in several jurisdictions have claimed the measures have had a chilling effect even before their implementation, discouraging families from seeking medical care, shelter and food.\u201d\n\nJeffrey Manzanares, 33, was hospitalized in the intensive care unit of the University of Utah Hospital in September. (Marisela Trujillo/Reuters)\n\nOUCH: Federal health officials say some patients sickened with the mysterious vaping-related lung-illness are being hospitalized a second time. Authorities continue to investigate the spate of illnesses that has sickened at least 1,299 people across the country. At least 28 people have died in the outbreak.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of a handful of patients who have been readmitted for clinical care after discharge for lung injury,\u201d said Anne Schuchat, the principal deputy director at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, our Post colleague Lena H. Sun reports.\n\n\u201cThe hospital readmissions have taken place as quickly as five days and up to 55 days after discharge, Schuchat said. It\u2019s not known what triggered the relapses. In some cases, patients had resumed vaping,\u201d Lena adds. \u201cIt\u2019s also possible that initial lung damage made patients more vulnerable to other illness. Another possibility, she said, is that treatment with steroids, which many clinicians have been using to care for such injuries, may \u2018set you up for increased infection risk.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cWe are not seeing a meaningful drop-off in new cases, and unfortunately many more people have been hospitalized with lung injury each week,\u201d Schuchat said during a news conference. Officials still don\u2019t know what\u2019s causing the illnesses and she added there may end up being more than one cause.\n\nHEALTH ON THE HILL\n\nA man uses a vape device in this illustration picture. (Reuters/Adnan Abidi/Illustration)\n\n\u2014 The House Energy and Commerce Committee and the Massachusetts attorney general\u2019s office are both investigating whether manufacturers of vaping products used social media bots to push their products and market e-cigarettes with misleading information.\n\nThe committee sent information requests to five manufacturers, calling for details including what usernames were used and whether the bot accounts noted their ties to the companies, the Wall Street Journal\u2019s John D. McKinnon reports. It\u2019s the latest probe from lawmakers and officials into how such products are being marketed and sold amid concerns about youth vaping.\n\n\u201cTwo major players, Reynolds American Inc. and Juul Labs Inc. haven\u2019t used bots, according to spokesmen. NJOY LLC also hasn\u2019t used bots, according to a person familiar with the matter. Japan Tobacco International USA Inc. said it hasn\u2019t used bots either. Another firm contacted by the House committee, Fontem Ventures, didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment,\u201d John reports.\n\n\u201cSocial-media bots are programmed accounts that automatically conduct tasks such as generating messages and reposting content,\u201d he adds. \u201cThere is nothing inherently wrong with their use, which is widespread on the internet. But they can be used for everything from pumping up a user\u2019s social-media following to padding an online advertisement\u2019s audience to amplifying phony marketing claims.\u201d\n\nOPIOID OPTICS\n\nA bottle of prescription painkiller OxyContin. (George Frey/Reuters)\n\n\u2014 A bankruptcy judge ruled to temporarily halt legal action against Purdue Pharma and its embattled owners, the Sackler family.\n\nThe ruling pauses action for three weeks in the numerous state and federal lawsuits against the company and Sackler family members. During that time, the opioid manufacturer \u201cagreed to address one of the key concerns \u2014 access to more information about the Sacklers\u2019 finances \u2014 raised by state attorneys general who objected to including the family in the temporary injunction,\u201d our Post colleague Renae Merle reports.\n\nThe company had initially asked for a 180-day stay. \u201cThe company argued that halting litigation was necessary to allow progress on a tentative settlement with more than 2,600 plaintiffs who have accused Purdue of deceptively marketing its blockbuster opioid pain pill, OxyContin,\u201d Renae reports. \u201cWithout that protection, the Sacklers had said they may back out of the settlement, valued at $10 billion to $12 billion. As part of that deal, the Sacklers agreed to relinquish control of their firm and contribute at least $3 billion to the settlement.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Renae and our colleague Lenny Bernstein wrote last week about why the company chose to file for bankruptcy in White Plains, N.Y., despite being headquartered in Connecticut and incorporated in Delaware.\n\n\u201cLarge corporations have considerable flexibility in choosing where to file bankruptcy.
