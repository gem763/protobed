But it can also be challenging not having to work.\n\nTake it from Kristy Shen and Bryce Leung of Millennial Revolution. The two former computer engineers quit their jobs at 31 as millionaires to travel the world. In their book, \u201cQuit Like a Millionaire,\u201d they said they needed to first overcome the three most common fears surrounding early retirement: running out of money, loss of community, and loss of identity.\n\n\u201cFear is necessary for survival,\u201d they wrote. \u201cBut the point of life isn\u2019t to hide under your bed and never take any risks. The point of life is taking the leap but bringing a parachute \u2013 just in case.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s how they tackled the \u201cdark side\u201d of early retirement.\n\nTo avoid running out of money, they were strategic about their savings\n\nThe easiest way to run out of money during early retirement is to deplete your investment portfolio during the first five years by selling stock into a down market, according to Shen and Leung. To deal with this, they suggest using a cash cushion \u2013 a reserve fund of savings you can draw from to avoid a full portfolio withdrawal during the down years.\n\nThey also suggest having a yield shield, which is a combination of dividends and interest from exchange-traded funds (ETFs) \u2013 a collection of investments such as stocks and bonds \u2013 that can be delivered as cash without selling any assets.\n\nRead more: 8 people who retired before age 45 reveal how the decision changed their money habits\n\nUnexpected health care costs and inflation could also factor into running out of money, they said. But traveling has helped them sidestep inflation, since it\u2019s a per-country effect. They also purchased expat insurance, which is less expensive than domestic insurance plans if you\u2019re an American retiring abroad.\n\n\u201cOur experience, after being retired for three years and having gone through a market crash in year one, has taught us that the fear of running out of money is overblown,\u201d they wrote. \u201cNot only has our net worth grown by $300,000, our expenses continue to drop. We\u2019re safer and richer than when we left.\u201d\n\nThey made friends at conferences and meet-ups\n\nEarly retiree Tony went back to work a year and a half after retiring early, partly because he missed social interaction. In a podcast with fellow early retiree Brandon of The Mad Fientist, he said that aspiring early retirees need to prepare for how they\u2019ll build human connection once they leave work.\n\nShen and Leung put it simply: When you\u2019re working, colleagues are your social circle. And others may not understand your decision to retire, they said.\n\n\u201cThe confident ones will be happy for you,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe unhappy ones will blame you for invalidating their own path.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe longer you\u2019re retired, the more confident you become,\u201d they continued. \u201cAnd if you lose friends by choosing a different path, those friendships weren\u2019t worth keeping in the first place.\u201d\n\nBut you also gain a new community by joining the FIRE movement. It opens up opportunities to meet new people \u2013 something Shen and Leung said they barely had time to do when working. Since retiring early, they\u2019ve made genuine friendships with people all over the world from FIRE-related conferences and meet-ups.\n\nJohn from ESI Money also suggests joining a club or gym and volunteering to meet people and connect socially.\n\nRead more: What 8 people wish they knew before retiring in their 20s and 30s\n\nEarly retirement allowed them to build a better identity\n\n\u201cFor some people what they do is who they are,\u201d John wrote. \u201cThen when the job is over, they don\u2019t know who they are any more.\u201d\n\nHe said that to get through early retirement, people need to find new activities to replace the time and meaning they got from work. Those could be recreational (hobbies, traveling, etc.), volunteering (church, non-profits, etc.), or occupational (a part-time job to help them feel productive again), he said.\n\nAs Shen and Leung put it: \u201cLose one identity, build a better one.\u201d\n\nBeing financially independent, they said, doesn\u2019t have to be about quitting your job and traveling the world \u2013 it\u2019s about choices.\n\n\u201cBecoming financially independent is about designing the life you want,\u201d they wrote. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve built a portfolio large enough that 4% of it covers your expenses each year, work is an option, not a mandate. If you want to fully retire like us and travel the world, do that. If you like your job, continue working with a more flexible schedule.\u201d\n\nThey advise getting rich and then following your passion so you don\u2019t have to worry about when or where your next payout is coming from. If your passions lead to failure, it will only hurt emotionally, not financially \u2013 if, that is, you have a portfolio to rely on that pays your expenses, they said.\n\nThey added: \u201cThere will always be worries when you go against the norm. But just like the perceived danger during a turbulent plane ride, they\u2019re mostly in your head.\u201d", "description": "Business Insider - People have three common fears about retiring early, according to two early retirees: running out of money, loss of community, and loss of identity..
