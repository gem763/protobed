Green army vehicles on flatbed train cars, apparently heading west, toward Russia\u2019s borders with Ukraine and Belarus.\n\nThe next day, social media users spotted Russian-made armored vehicles speeding down a highway in Belarus. \u201cThe local forest is literally crammed with armored vehicles,\u201d reported Charter \u201997, a Belarusian news website.\n\nRussia, like all major military powers, frequently moves its military forces around its own territory and deploys them to allied countries for exercises. The Belarusian and Russian armies as recently as September conducted a major military exercise involving 12,000 troops and 950 vehicles.\n\nWhat\u2019s remarkable\u2014and, for many, worrying\u2014about the October sightings is where they took place: near the Suwalki Gap, where two NATO countries, Poland and Lithuania, have a roughly 40-mile border running through heavily forested territory that separates close Russian ally Belarus from Russia\u2019s enclave on the Baltic Sea, Kaliningrad.\n\nAs tensions between Russia and the West escalate and Russia cements its land-grab in Ukraine, U.S. and allied military planners have cast a nervous gaze on this contentious bit of real estate. If the new cold war turns hot, the Suwalki Gap just might be where the fighting starts.\n\nFor NATO, that\u2019s a problem. The Suwalki Gap, which some experts also call the \u201cSuwalki Corridor,\u201d is on the alliance\u2019s territorial fringes, where European military might is at its thinnest. But it butts up against a major concentration of Russian forces in Kaliningrad.\n\n\u201cThe Suwa\u0142ki Corridor is where the many weaknesses in NATO\u2019s strategy and force posture converge,\u201d Ben Hodges, Janusz Bugajski, and Peter Doran explained in a 2018 report for the Center for European Policy in Washington, D.C..\n\nHodges, for one, knows what he\u2019s talking about. A retired U.S. Army general, Hodges from 2014 to 2017 commanded thousands of American ground troops in Europe. Right before retiring he organized NATO\u2019s first major exercise along the Suwalki Gap.\n\n\u201cThe gap is vulnerable,\u201d he warned at the time.\n\nWith 29 member states including the United States, NATO possesses far more military power than Russia. But many of NATO\u2019s reserves of troops and tanks are based hundreds or, in the case of American forces, thousands of miles from potential battlefields such as the Suwalki Gap. Russia, on the other hand, has concentrated troops and vehicles in its Western Military District, just a short trip by road or rail to the Suwalki Gap.\n\nThe imbalance is striking. In 2014 and 2015 the California think-tank RAND simulated a Russian attack across the Suwalki Gap. The Russians should be able quickly to mobilize 25 battalions\u2014around 10,000 ground troops\u2014for the assault, RAND calculated. NATO would be able immediately to mobilize just 17 battalions with around 6,800 troops.\n\nBut the troop-count belies the true balance of power. Every battalion Russia could call up for the attack possesses armored vehicles, including heavy tanks. Just one of NATO\u2019s nearby units has any armored vehicles at all. And those vehicles are Stryker armored cars belonging to a U.S. Army reconnaissance unit.\n\nThe Stryker\u2019s biggest weapon is a 30-millimeter-diameter cannon. Russian tanks pack 125-millimeter-diameter guns with an order of magnitude more explosive power.\n\n\u201c By and large, NATO\u2019s infantry found themselves unable even to retreat successfully and were destroyed in place. \u201d \u2014 Rand Corporation on Sulwaki Gap War-Game Results\n\nWhen RAND gamed out the Suwalki Gap battle, the results were chilling, if not surprising. \u201cNATO\u2019s light forces were not only outgunned by the much heavier Russian units, but their lack of maneuverability meant that they could be pinned and bypassed if the Russian players so desired,\u201d RAND explained. \u201cBy and large, NATO\u2019s infantry found themselves unable even to retreat successfully and were destroyed in place.\u201d\n\nIn RAND\u2019s admittedly extreme case-study, Russia quickly closes the Suwalki Gap, creating a territorial bridge between Belarus and Kaliningrad and cutting off NATO states Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia from the rest of the alliance.\n\nSuch a move could incite a major war. Indeed, for Russia that could be the point\u2014to start a fight that it views as inevitable, and to do so on its own terms.\n\n\u201cWhile Russia is unlikely to start a military campaign just to capture Suwalki, it would undoubtedly try to secure this territory if conflict were to emerge in the region,\u201d Agnia Grigas, a Lithuania-born American political scientist and Russia expert, told The Daily Beast.\n\nThere would be warning signs of an impending Russian attack, the experts at RAND and the Center for European Policy explained. Russian battalions could speed in and out of the Suwalki Gap, temporarily holding sections of the border and testing NATO\u2019s resolve.\n\nThe possibility of Russia launching small-scale incursions as a prelude to a bigger assault helps to explain the alarm over the October troop-sightings. But secret probes are equally likely. These could involve the same type of \u201chybrid\u201d Russian forces\u2014basically, intelligence operatives and special forces commandos in disguise\u2014that appeared in Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula right before Russian tanks rolled in.\n\nThese so-called \u201clittle green men\u201d could scout out invasion routes, mobilize pro-Russian locals and prepare to seize government buildings and set up checkpoints. Detecting these interlopers is critical for NATO\u2019s defense.\n\n\u201cNATO has to watch not only Russian build-up in Kaliningrad and Belarus but also Russia\u2019s soft power and intelligence operations in Suwalki,\u201d Grigas said.\n\nBut there\u2019s a problem. Lithuania controls one side of the Suwalki Gap. Poland controls the other. Both countries are NATO members, but they haven\u2019t always gotten along. \u201cPoland and Lithuania are cooperating allies today but they have a history of tensions and conflict over territory and minorities,\u201d Grigas explained.\n\nThe Kremlin could exploit those tensions, Grigas said. Russia might count on Lithuania and Poland refusing to share information as more and more little green men appeared in each other\u2019s territory.\n\nAfter years of war games, simulations and studies\u2014and occasional scares such as Russia\u2019s October troop movements\u2014NATO is well aware of its problems along the Suwalki Gap. And the alliance is taking steps to try to solve them.\n\nThe U.S. Army has begun installing heavier weapons and other new gear on the Stryker armored vehicles that would be the first to fight any Russian invasion force. The Army has announced that in early 2020 it will practice deploying 20,000 troops from the United States to Europe in order to \u201cbuild readiness within the alliance and deter potential adversaries.\u201d NATO in September set up a new headquarters in Germany whose sole job is speeding reinforcements around alliance territory.\n\nAs for those Russian vehicles in the woods in Belarus? \u201cI have no idea what is going on or whether it's significant,\u201d Pavel Podvig, an independent expert on the Russian military, told The Daily Beast. \u201cI hope it's not.\u201d", "description": "On the territorial fringes of the alliance, where European military might is at its thinnest, an overconfident Putin might exploit the weakness to conduct a new \u201chybrid\u201d war.", "authors": ["David Axe"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1572039521/191011-axe-russia-tease_lzfcaq", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
