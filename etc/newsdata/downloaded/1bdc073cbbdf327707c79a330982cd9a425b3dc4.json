It\u2019s ridiculous. We\u2019re all trying to get psyched up, but shaking hands with your opponent \u2014 that\u2019s NFL etiquette. And when you pull bush league stuff, that\u2019s disrespectful to the game. And believe me, that\u2019s gonna get us fired up.\u201d\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nApparently it did, as Sherman picked off Mayfield two minutes into the game. Sherman wasn\u2019t the only one to take a shot at Mayfield on a miserable night, as Nick Bosa clowned his college-era flag-waving celebration.\n\nSherman said it was particularly offensive for a young player to not participate in the perfunctory ritual.\n\n\u201cRespect the game,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cYou can have rivals, but pay your respect in that moment \u2014 especially when you\u2019re young. He hasn\u2019t earned anything in this league. How many games has he won? He\u2019s acting like he was the MVP last year. If [Patrick] Mahomes did that, it would be one thing. But he would never do that, because he has too much respect for the game.\n\n\u201cAnd when you see a guy who doesn\u2019t? You humble him every chance you get. Because eventually, he will have respect for the league \u2014 or he\u2019ll be out of it.\u201d\n\nOf course, Sherman\u2019s never been afraid to play with a bit of edge himself, but Monday night, he was willing to pile on after a miserable night by Mayfield. Sherman mentioned Mayfield\u2019s preseason slight of Giants rookie Daniel Jones in GQ as further evidence.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason for him to say and do those things, especially given how little he\u2019s accomplished,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cThat\u2019s where he\u2019s gonna have to grow up. He might get there, but he has a long way to go.\u201d\n\nAnd he apparently needs to begin by shaking hands.", "description": "Richard Sherman was annoyed with Baker Mayfield before the game even started.
