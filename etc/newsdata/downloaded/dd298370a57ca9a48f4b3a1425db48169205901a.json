The centre-left Socialists are well ahead in opinion polls after recording the lowest budget deficit in the 45 years of Portugal\u2019s democratic history. And the economy is on course to grow 1.9% this year, above the EU average.\n\n\u201cPerhaps it\u2019s best for the austerity not to end completely, or we run the risk of going overboard as happened before the crisis,\u201d said Nuno Almeida, 31, a karate teacher in the town of Barreiro, south of Lisbon.\n\nAlmeida, who has a second job in a publishing house, said he plans to vote for the Socialists because they \u201cbalance out discipline and progress\u201d.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t want to go through the suffering again and are now much more lucid about deficits and the budget,\u201d said Almeida, whose livelihood was hit when he lost many of his fee-paying pupils during the 2011-14 crisis.\n\nWhile Costa\u2019s government declared in 2016 that it had \u201cturned the page on austerity\u201d by reversing some pay cuts and tax hikes imposed by the previous administration, it has since become more frugal. It has refused to raise salaries for teachers and civil servants, while the total tax burden reached a record high 35.4% of GDP in 2018.\n\nEven with wages largely stuck at pre-crisis levels of almost a decade ago, ordinary people say they have felt improvements lately.\n\nPortugal's Prime Minister and Socialist Party (PS) candidate Antonio Costa attends an electoral campaign rally in Lisbon, Portugal September 24, 2019.

I believe the country will continue to evolve.\u201d\n\nTourism is Portugal\u2019s major source of revenue and has helped its recovery.\n\nFinance minister Mario Centeno, who is also chairman of the Eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers, now promises a small budget surplus next year, but so does the main opposition centre-right party PSD, which could make potential post-election agreements easier. The Socialists are still unlikely to win an outright majority but are expected to increase their number of seats in parliament.\n\nIn a sign that Centeno\u2019s tenure has become a standard for sound fiscal and economic policies, PSD leader Rui Rio told Costa in a recent debate: \u201cI also have my own Mario Centeno\u201d.\n\nAny deviation from the deficit-busting course is politically risky, as Rio knows from the European elections in May, when PSD suffered its worst-ever result, capturing just 22% of the vote.\n\nJust ahead of those elections, Costa had accused PSD of compromising fiscal stability when PSD briefly sided with the far-left in backing a bill that would have raised teachers\u2019 wages. The bill was never approved.\n\n\u201cThe big irony of this election ... and the big difficulty for the right is that they have lost the banner of budget balance and the Socialists have raised it,\u201d said political analyst Antonio Costa Pinto. \u201cThe centre-right and the centre-left appreciate these values, and that\u2019s the bulk of the electorate.\u201d\n\nEven the far-left parties have contributed to the deficit-cutting policies, helping to approve all four annual budgets despite blaming underfunded public healthcare and education on Centeno\u2019s \u201cobsession with the deficit\u201d.\n\nPortugal's Prime Minister and Socialist Party (PS) candidate Antonio Costa hugs with his Finance minister Mario Centeno during an electoral campaign rally in Lisbon, Portugal September 24, 2019.

And although the government budgeted for a 31% increase in public investment this year to 2.1% of GDP - still one of the lowest levels in the EU - it rose by just 3% in the first seven months.", "description": "Portugal's Socialist Prime Minister Antonio Costa aims to retain power at Sunday's parliamentary election with a pledge that looks like an unlikely vote-winner for western Europe's poorest country - no backtracking on tight spending controls.", "authors": ["Sergio Goncalves", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436662408&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9213Z", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
