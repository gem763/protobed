Everyone at Orlando\u2019s Stonewall Bar listened intently.\n\nHunter described the shame he would experience keeping his gayness a secret. He outlined the trauma he\u2019d endure during conversion therapy, and the rejection that would come from his religious community. He explained complications squaring his identity with his strong evangelical faith.\n\nHunter was speaking publicly for the first time of his personal experience with conversion therapy at an event promoting a ban of the practice in Orange County, Florida.\n\nConversion therapy, or reparative therapy, is an effort to change an individual\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity through psychotherapy, counseling, or intensive gender-performative camps.\n\nWhile talk therapy is most commonly used, some practitioners have incorporated \u201caversion treatments, such as inducing nausea, vomiting, or paralysis\u201d and electric shock treatment, according to the Williams Institute of UCLA.\n\nThe practices have been widely debunked and deemed dangerous by the American Psychological Association and the American Psychiatric Association. Conversion therapy has been outlawed in 21 other Florida communities, including Miami, Tampa, and most recently Alachua County. Nationwide, it\u2019s banned in 18 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico.\n\nThe Williams Institute estimates 20,000 LGBT youths (13-17) will receive conversion therapy from a licensed professional in states where it's permitted, and 57,000 LGBT youths (13-17) across all states will receive conversion therapy from religious organizations.\n\n\u201c[Conversion therapy presents] significant risk of harm by subjecting individuals to forms of treatment which have not been scientifically validated and by undermining self-esteem when sexual orientation fails to change,\u201d the American Psychiatric Association said in a 2013 statement.\n\nOrlando activists Andrew Chang and Eric Rollings started an online petition to ban the practice in Orange County. The petition, addressed to county commissioners, outlines the irreparable consequences of conversion therapy, and how LGBT youth in particular are the most vulnerable.\n\nOrlando activists told The Daily Beast that similar statewide bills have died without a hearing, so activists are pushing the ban in as many counties, cities, and municipalities as possible to set a precedent for Florida\u2019s capitol.\n\nIf enacted, the Orange County ban would specifically protect LGBT youth from conversion therapy by licensed therapists. Activists argue minors being subjected to this involuntarily is child abuse. Similar counseling through churches, however, would continue to be protected under religious freedom laws.\n\nConversion therapy is rooted in the idea that queerness, or anything outside of identifying as cisgender, is a mental disorder that needs to be \u201cfixed.\u201d As a result, patients who undergo this pseudoscience are often left with anxiety, depression, suicidality and PTSD.\n\nGay, lesbian and bisexual youth that are rejected by their families are eight times more likely to attempt suicide than those raised in affirming homes, according to a San Francisco State University study.\n\n\u201cIt makes you constantly torture yourself mentally, it\u2019s almost like it creates a sort of OCD state where you\u2019re just trying to get rid of any thoughts that might be gay,\u201d said Selkie MacNicol [not her real name, but a pen name she asked to use], a 23-year-old conversion therapy survivor.\n\nAt 17, MacNicol started conversion therapy with a licensed therapist in Winter Park, a ritzy suburb of Orlando. Soon after, MacNicol says her physical and emotional health deteriorated from porphyria, a chronic illness that flared from stress.\n\n\u201cIt was triggered by the therapy, I ended up in the ER with stomach pain and pain all over. I couldn\u2019t swallow,\u201d she said.\n\nMacNicol found solace in LGBT communities online and said they \u201crehabilitated\u201d her from the toxic conditioning of conversion therapy. MacNicol now manages a blog supporting others in similar situations.\n\n\u201cI started to notice that the more I accepted myself, the more my health improved,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll always probably have a disability. There\u2019s varying levels; I can have a disability and be hopeful or I can have a disability and be helpless, and that\u2019s much worse.\u201d\n\nStephanie Preston-Hughes, a licensed Orlando therapist who specializes in care for LGBT clients and has treated more than a dozen survivors, said ex-gay therapy is almost always offered by Christian religious groups. \u201cIt\u2019s inherently based on a judgement that homosexuality is wrong, it\u2019s a sin, that it can be changed,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cFrom my perspective as a mental health professional, it\u2019s really an intent to inflict religious beliefs on other people,\u201d Preston-Hughes said.\n\n\u201cPeople commit suicide over this,\u201d she added. \u201cIt is not an overstatement to say this is literally a life and death issue.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about who we are as men\u201d\n\nTwo weeks after Jordan Hunter\u2019s public address, he spoke with The Daily Beast at cafe in Downtown Orlando. Hunter sipped his iced chai tea in the late afternoon sun, armed with an infectious smile and fire-red hair. He has a deep-south politeness and accent to match.\n\nHunter grew up in an evangelical Baptist church in New Port Richey, a small town nestled in Florida's Gulf Coast. He first came out as gay at 15 to a youth pastor, confessing that he \u201cstruggled\u201d with homosexuality and needed the church\u2019s help.\n\n\u201cI had no idea what to do or what to think or how to feel,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know any gay people in the church.\u201d\n\nHunter said immediately after coming out, the youth pastor and church clergy \u201cfervently prayed\u201d over the teen. The pastor offered to suggest books and set up counseling with one of the pastors in the church but, Hunter said, \u201cHe never talked to me about it again.\u201d\n\nEyeing a future in ministry himself, Hunter later interned at a Methodist church and moved to a Bible college in Atlanta.\n\nDuring his time at Bible college, Hunter had a same-sex experience, and, overcome with guilt, confessed to leaders at the college. The administration decided before he could continue his studies in Atlanta, he would have to \u201cdevote more attention\u201d to his same sex attractions and recommended Big Fish Ministry, a conversion therapy residential treatment center in Orlando.\n\nBig Fish Ministry\u2019s owner, Matthew Walker, is vocal to readers of his blog about his experience \u201covercoming homosexuality,\u201d and his site claims the ministry is for men over 18 who \u201cstruggle with Same-Sex Attraction (SSA) and homosexuality and seek to live a Christ centered life in regards to their sexuality.\u201d\n\n\u201cI moved in with a total stranger who just wanted to pry into my life and pretty much have me divulge everything to him,\u201d Hunter said.\n\nA copy of Big Fish Ministry\u2019s house rules reviewed by The Daily Beast showed participants were forced to install spyware on their computers to monitor their search history, and assigned \u201caccountability partners\u201d to deter participants from looking at porn.\n\n\u201cOur sex drive is a wild beast in need of taming,\u201d the rules state. \u201cI have no way to monitor this except through conversation and honesty\u2026 Masturbation is a childish way to ease our pain. We have got to attack our problems like men do. Head on!\u201d\n\nExperts told The Daily Beast exaggerated gender roles are a key component of conversion therapy.\n\n\u201cIt was all about who were are as men ,\u201d Hunter said of the program. \u201cIt was very chauvinistic.\u201d\n\nBig Fish Ministry\u2019s current programs include a four-day $350 fishing trip excursion for men seeking \u201cmentoring for sexual brokenness\u201d and hourly Skype and FaceTime counseling sessions.\n\n\u201cI was suicidal,\u201d Hunter said of his time at Big Fish Ministry. \u201cI felt like my entire focus was on my sex life. It wasn\u2019t about what I wanted to do with my life. It wasn\u2019t about building a career, it wasn\u2019t about becoming a better person or learning or growing.\u201d\n\nFor many, conversion therapy manifests as isolation and terror. Hunter said he felt he didn\u2019t belong in the faith community because he was gay, nor the gay community because of his faith.\n\n\u201cI kept it all to myself,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cIt was a lot.\u201d\n\nBig Fish Ministry did not respond to The Daily Beast's request for comment.\n\n\u201cYou cannot change your sexual orientation\u201d\n\nAside from all things Disney, Orlando doubles as a hub for evangelical organizations and megachurches.\n\nAmong them is the now-shuttered Exodus International, which reigned as the largest ex-gay organization in the world for more than three decades.\n\nChange is Possible!\u2014Exodus\u2019 mantra\u2014was misleading in that the ministry wasn\u2019t in the business of changing one\u2019s sexuality, but rather repressing it.\n\n\u201cI never called myself straight or heterosexual; I just didn\u2019t call myself gay.\u201d former Exodus International President Alan Chambers told The Daily Beast.\n\n\u201cYou cannot change your sexual orientation,\u201d Chambers said. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important for me to be involved, not just as someone who experienced trauma, but as someone who caused trauma.\u201d\n\nChambers said his shift from president of the largest ex-gay organization to an LGBT activist was not one that came easily. He alleged that as he started to challenge the practices and ethics of Exodus, many members of the church began to turn on him. Then, after telling CNN\u2019s Lisa Ling that he believes Christian homosexuals can go to heaven, the theological infrastructure of Exodus began to crumble.\n\nIn 2012, Chambers publicly denounced conversion therapy and apologized. In 2013, the board voted to close.\n\nRandy Thomas, another former Exodus leader, joined Chambers in denouncing the practice and is now working with LGBT activists to raise awareness of the dangers of conversion therapy.\n\nThomas told The Daily Beast after a close friend\u2019s suicide in 2013, his \u201cblinders were ripped off.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe couldn\u2019t reconcile who he was as a gay man and his faith,\u201d Thomas said of his late friend, between tears. \u201cI couldn\u2019t hyper-spiritualize that away.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like the first time you ever put on glasses; if you\u2019re nearsighted you don\u2019t know you\u2019re nearsighted until you put the glasses on. Well that moment made me see clearly: Oh my god, what have I been a part of? How did I get here?\u201d\n\nThough Exodus International has closed, conversion therapy quietly continues in the Orlando area. Several sources told The Daily Beast that there were between 12 and 15 known providers that practice conversion therapy and actively advertise it in Orange County.\n\nActivists say they keep the list of providers confidential to protect the identity of minors subjected to the practice and to prevent providers from rebranding and moving locations.\n\n\u201cPulse changed everything\u201d\n\nBrandon Wolf is a Pulse survivor and media relations manager for Equality Florida.\n\nWolf was in the bathroom washing his hands when his two best friends, Drew Leinonen and Juan Guerrero, were among the 49 murdered during the 2016 Pulse massacre. Wolf said he was once a \u201ccomplacent ultra millennial,\u201d but the mass shooting jolted him into action.\n\nAs he told The Daily Beast, \u201cPulse changed everything,\u201d\n\nThe days following Pulse, Wolf explained, there was an onslaught of television talking heads speaking about the Orlando LGBT community and the pain the city was reeling from.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t see queer people of color talking about how this impacted them,\u201d he said flatly.\n\n\u201cI realized if I stayed complacent and didn\u2019t become engaged with the political process, didn\u2019t become engaged with my community, that some of our stories would never be told.\u201d\n\nWolf, along with Equality Florida and a collective of Orlando LGBT groups, backed the anti-conversion therapy online petition, and are currently working with local lawmakers to bring the bill banning conversion therapy in Orange County to light. To date, the bill has died in the legislature several times without a hearing.\n\nOrlando, especially post-Pulse, is celebrated as a progressive, inclusive pocket of Florida. Orlando\u2019s mayor Buddy Dyer was recently championed \u201camong the most vocal champions for the LGBTQ community\u201d by the Equality Florida Action PAC.\n\nThere are memorials and #OrlandoStrong murals sprinkled throughout the city. The bandshell in the heart of downtown is freshly painted as a rainbow in honor of the Pulse victims.\n\nYet despite Orlando\u2019s LGBT-friendly reputation, the reality is most people aren\u2019t aware that conversion therapy is still practiced in the area.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about exposure and how many people actually know this exists and the dangers of it,\u201d said Jennifer Foster, Executive Director of One Orlando Alliance.\n\nFoster said she\u2019s optimistic about a conversion therapy ban passing in Orange County, but anticipates pushback from far-right religious groups like Liberty Counsel, who have challenged similar ordinances in the state.\n\nOther immediate obstacles gaining nationwide attention threaten to stall the initiative\u2014namely, the threat of an Orlando child detention center for migrants and potential hurricanes brewing in the Atlantic.\n\nLast January, then-Orange County mayor Theresa Jacobs told the Orlando Sentinel conversion therapy was \u201cnot an issue that\u2019s on our radar.\u201d\n\nAfter several activists, therapists, and survivors spoke at a September 10 Board of County Commissioners meeting, Orange County Mayor Demings responded that the while the board agreed with the ban, they were still investigating the legal ramifications for the state.\n\n\"While we may support you, we are still gathering information about whether or not at the county level it is an appropriate place to create laws or regulations [for conversion therapy].\"\n\n\"We'll meet with you in the very near future,\" he assured.\n\nEric Rollings, an LGBT activist and spokesperson for the petition, said the next step is a meeting with Mayor Deming\u2019s Chief of Staff and a county attorney on September 30th.\n\n\u201cYou will find God.\u201d\n\nBack at Stonewall Bar, Hunter finished reading his letter to his future self.\n\n\u201cYou will feel the love of God in the people around you and the community you build.\n\nThat love you find will take that terrible, dark secret you kept for so many years and it will transform it into a beautiful truth. One that you will be so proud of.\u201d\n\nHe swallowed, blinking back tears. \u201cI know you, I am you, I love you.\u201d", "description": "Conversion therapy is quietly thriving in the Sunshine State, and central Florida\u2019s LGBTQ activists have had enough.", "authors": ["Sarah Rogers", "Director Of Photography"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569353795/190924-rogers-conversion-therapy-tease_ekz2am", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
