The New York Times reported about the bias on Wednesday, saying it was redacted in a memo Inspector General of the Intelligence Community Michael Atkinson provided to the House Intelligence Committee:\n\nIn submitting his complaint, the whistle-blower identified three facts that could be used to accuse him of potential bias against Mr. Trump, the documents showed. Two were redacted. The third indicated that the whistle-blower is a registered Democrat, a fact first reported by CNN last week that has widely circulated since.\n\n\"The fact that the whistleblower has three political biases against the President shows just how rigged this whole impeachment process is. It\u2019s getting ridiculous,\" a congressional source with direct knowledge of the matter told Townhall.\n\n\"First, it\u2019s Adam Schiff conducting Democratic impeachment efforts behind closed doors. Next, it\u2019s Speaker Pelosi refusing to vote on an impeachment inquiry. Now, we learn their star witness is entrenched in partisanship. Where does it end?\u201d the source added.\n\nThe whistleblower's lawyers, Andrew Bakaj and Mark Zaid, released a statement on Wednesday in response to the Washington Examiner's report.\n\n\"First, our client has never worked for or advised a political candidate, campaign, or party. Second, our client has spent their entire government career in apolitical, civil servant positions in the Executive Branch. Third, in these positions, our client has come into contact with presidential candidates from both parties in their roles as elected officials \u2013 not as candidates. Fourth, the whistleblower voluntarily provided relevant career information to the ICIG in order to facilitate an assessment of the credibility of the complaint. Fifth, as a result, the ICIG concluded \u2013 as is well known \u2013 that the complaint was both urgent and credible.\"\n\n\"Finally, the whistleblower is not the story,\" they asserted.\n\nThe whistleblower's complaint said Trump's phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was inappropriate because Trump was \"using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.\"", "description": ".10/10/2019 11:00:50AM EST.", "authors": ["Julio Rosas", "Guy Benson", "Cortney O'Brien", "Timothy Meads", "Leah Barkoukis"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/233/ce482cc3-e9d5-499c-8624-5977d1b94aa9.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
