The S&P 500 is up just over 19% year-to-date. The energy sector\u2019s performance over the past year-over-year is more glaring, with a 21% decline.\n\nPrices for West Texas Intermediate, (CL=F) the U.S. benchmark for crude, currently stand at roughly $56 a barrel, a rise of 14.7% so far this year, but a decline of 18.7% year-over-year. On Sept. 16, oil prices surged some 15%, reaching as high as roughly $63 a barrel after air strikes in Saudi Arabia disrupted production. The one-day surge was short-lived.\n\n\u201cAbsolute and relative valuations are at lows with small-cap E&Ps [exploration & production] trading below book value and at price levels seen almost 25 years ago,\u201d be wrote. \u201cIn contrast, corporate sentiment is bullish with insider purchases rising to cycle highs and shareholder return at ~6% with stronger buyback announcements and higher dividends.\u201d\n\nLakos-Bujas also sees 2020 benefits to the sector from increased central bank stimulus and hopes of thawing U.S.-China trade relations.\n\nAMS More\n\nScott Gamm is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
