It is expected to rise to R4.5 trillion in the next three years,\u201d Mboweni said.\n\nHe pointed out that the bleak situation would force the government to make difficult decisions, which may include slowing growth in wages and imposing additional revenue measures, essential managing the government\u2019s salary costs and finding more ways of generating revenue.\n\n\u201cThe consequence of not acting now would be gravely negative for South Africa. Over time, the country would likely face mounting debt service costs and higher interest rates and may enter a debt trap. The unemployment crisis would worsen, and government debt could balloon. This is an outcome we are determined to avoid,\u201d he said.\n\nRead: Unemployment, Eskom, should be focus of budget speech\n\nMboweni said this year\u2019s consolidated budget deficit is projected at 5.9% of GDP in the current year. Last year\u2019s projection, which was also off the mark, was 3.6% but was eventually estimated at 4%.\n\nEconomic growth is projected to be 0.2% less than last year\u2019s estimate of 0.7%, which at the time was based on the fact that the economy had just experienced a technical recession.\n\n\u201cThe economy is now forecast to grow at 0.5% in 2019 compared with the 1.5% expected in February. Growth is projected to slowly rise to 1.7% in 2022, supported by household consumption and private-sector investment.\u201d\n\nMboweni said government is set to spend R6.3 trillion over the medium term and R3 trillion of that will go to three priority areas, namely, education, social development and health.\n\nWith Sars now projected to collect less than it did last year, Mboweni said revenue forecasts were now more cautious.\n\n\u201cWe now expect to collect R1.37 trillion this year. This is R53 billion, or 4%, less than we expected. Looking ahead, our revenue forecasts are prudent. We assume an elasticity of one, which means a one to-one relationship between growth in taxes and economic growth, after adjusting for tax measures,\u201d he said.\n\nMore money for \u2018expensive money\u2019\u2026\n\nGovernment expects to be paying more for its borrowed money with projections expecting the service costs to exceed expenditure on some of the key priority area such as health in three years\u2019 time.\n\nMboweni said with the budget deficit averaging 6.2% of the GDP, the country must expect to spend at least more to service its loans.\n\n\u2018The consolidated budget deficit averages 6.2% of GDP over the next three years. Debt and debt-service costs will continue to increase, with the debt-to-GDP ratio now estimated at 71.3% in 2022/23,\u2019\n\nCredit growth, Mboweni said, has been on the up since last year with the private sector credit extensions rising up to 6.2% last month while there has been a significant home loans which grew 5% year on year.\n\nMboweni admitted that the economy is still looking very bleak and but summarised the problem as government spending more than it makes in revenue, a problem, he said, would be tackled by employing debt stabilisation measures.\n\n\u201cOur problem is that we spend more than we earn. It is as simple as that. To stabilise debt, government will target a primary balance by 2022/23. The target measure excludes support to Eskom, because that is part of a separate process,\u201d he said.\n\nRead: No more free lunch for \u2018spoilt brat\u2019 Eskom\n\nSince his last budget in February, treasury has had to pump R26 billion into Eskom, R11 billion to state-owned companies and R430 million infrastructure for student housing, funds Mboweni said have had to be drawn from partly from the contingency reserve, provisional allocations as well as declared unspent funds carried over.\n\nDividing the cake\u2026\n\nMboweni said government is set to spend R6.3 trillion over the medium term and R3 trillion of that will go to three priority areas, namely, education, social development and health.\n\nThe national debt, which this year exceeded the R3 trillion mark, is also expected to increase by 50% over the next three years and mostly likely reach more than 70% of GDP in 2022/23 financial year.\n\n\u201cApproximately half of non-interest spending goes to national government, and the other half to provinces and municipalities. We have achieved many social gains over the past 25 years. Our social spending programmes can be sustained over the long-term provided we make reasonable and prudent choices. On our current trajectory, by the end of the three-year framework, debt service costs will be bigger than spending on health and economic development.\n\nMboweni also tabled, together with the medium term budget policy statement, seven other bills, namely Adjustments Appropriation, the Rates and Monetary Amounts, Amendment of Revenue Laws Bill, The Taxation Laws Amendment, the Division of Revenue Amendment Bill, the Tax Administration Laws Amendment and the 2019 Adjusted Estimates of National Expenditure bills.", "description": "Finance Minister Tito Mboweni has announced that the country\u2019s debt crisis has finally reached an all time high of R3 trillion and if nothing is done about it will increase by to R4.5 trillion over the next three years.", "authors": ["Lesetja Malope"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8458/38c26e3e84644af7b2f0114706ee680a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
