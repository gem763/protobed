He\u2019s a real leader and he\u2019s shown that again on Thursday.\n\n\u201cYou know just during the week all the micro chats he\u2019ll be having, and not just with the same players over and over again, he goes and seeks players out.\n\n\u201cHe gets what he wants out of them. He has so much experience and knowledge of the game that you have to take on board whatever he says.\n\n\u201cWhen you reflect on what he says you sometimes end up looking back at the video and realising he\u2019s dead right.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s so accurate in what he says to you. And he can make you a better player just by you talking to him.\u201d", "description": "Coach Joe Schmidt is confident the fly-half will be fit and firing for the match.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/05/wire-19324046-1570251211-122_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
