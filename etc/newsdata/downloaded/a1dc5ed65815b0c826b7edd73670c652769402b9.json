In addition, insurers would have to meet a 2.5% capital buffer. If they fall short of that buffer the Fed will limit capital distributions and bonus payments.\n\nThe move mirrors how the Fed helped shore up the big banks following the financial crisis of 2008, in some cases limiting the distribution of dividends based on how well the companies were capitalized.", "description": "The Fed gives insurance giants a new mandate.", "authors": ["Jennifer Schonberger"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/fed-insurers-iStock.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
