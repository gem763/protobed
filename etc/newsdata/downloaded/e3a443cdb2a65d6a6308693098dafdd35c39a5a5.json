Separately, State\u2019s inspector general is due to soon release a major report into alleged political retaliation against career staffers under Pompeo\u2019s predecessor, Rex Tillerson.\n\nThe inspector general recently released a separate report that found an assistant secretary of state, Kevin Moley, acted abusively toward career staff. Pompeo, however, has not fired Moley.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/9f/5e/efb5847e4b42a358b4de7e606b6b/ukraine-site.png\"\n\nSeparately, but still alarming to career employees, are Trump\u2019s attacks on the unnamed whistleblower whose complaint helped prompt the impeachment inquiry. The president has cast the whistleblower\u2019s sources as \u201cspies\u201d engaged in \u201ctreason\u201d and implied that they should be executed. He\u2019s also sought to unmask the whistleblower, saying in a series of tweets Tuesday: \u201cWhy aren\u2019t we entitled to interview & learn everything about the Whistleblower, and also the person who gave all of the false information to him.\u201d\n\nYovanovitch is one of several State Department employees House investigators hope to interview as they dig into the impeachment inquiry. She originally was supposed to be deposed Wednesday, before being rescheduled to Oct. 11. The impeachment inquiry was launched after revelations that Trump asked Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate one of his 2020 political rivals, former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nSeparately, a congressional aide confirmed Tuesday evening that the State Department inspector general has made an \u201curgent request\u201d to brief Hill staffers on Ukraine-related issues Wednesday.\n\nYovanovitch, a decorated diplomat with more than 30 years in the U.S. Foreign Service, came under fire earlier this year by Trump\u2019s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, as well as Donald Trump Jr., and elements in the conservative media. They claimed that she had an anti-Trump bias, and there were indirect allegations that she\u2019d tried to block Ukrainian investigations into Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nYovanovitch was known for pressing Ukraine\u2019s government to fight corruption, a position long held by the U.S. government, which has been sending military aid to Ukraine in its battle against Russia. But the conservative attacks nonetheless appeared to undermine her. Pompeo pulled Yovanovitch out of Kyiv in May, some two months before she was due to leave the post.\n\nThe maelstrom of attacks on Yovanovitch seemed to reach all the way to the Oval Office. In a July 25 phone call with Ukraine\u2019s new president, Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump trashed the ambassador and even appeared to make a veiled threat against her.\n\n\u201cThe former ambassador from the United States, the woman, was bad news,\u201d Trump said, adding later, \u201cShe\u2019s going to go through some things.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s comments, revealed in a detailed call memo released by the White House, spurred outrage among the thousands of Civil and Foreign Service officers who work at State or have done so in the past. Organizations such as the American Academy of Diplomacy and the American Foreign Service Association put out statements in her support.\n\n\u201cWhatever views the administration has of Ambassador Yovanovitch\u2019s performance, we call on the administration to make clear that retaliation for political reasons will not be tolerated,\u201d wrote the academy, a nonpartisan group of former U.S. diplomats.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

That means they implement U.S. policy regardless of which party or which president is in power. They provide expertise and institutional memory that is supposed to aid an administration\u2019s political appointees.\n\nBut from the beginning, Trump\u2019s political appointees viewed the career staffers with suspicion, suggesting that they comprised a \u201cdeep state\u201d determined to derail the Republican president\u2019s agenda. Conservative media outlets fueled such claims. Some printed lists of career staffers dubbed \u201cObama holdovers,\u201d even though many had joined government long before Barack Obama was president.\n\nAt the same time, State Department employees angered Trump political appointees early on when around 1,000 signed on to a \u201c dissent memo\u201d expressing their unhappiness with Trump\u2019s executive order banning the citizens of several Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States.\n\nSean Spicer, the White House press secretary at the time, said if the \u201ccareer bureaucrats\u201d had a problem with the order, \u201cthey should either get with the program or they can go.\u201d\n\nPompeo\u2019s role in the drama is mixed. When he first joined the Trump administration, he led the CIA, and he spoke highly of the men and women who worked for him. He took over as the chief U.S. diplomat from Tillerson, whose support for steep budget cuts, obsession with reorganizing the State Department, and failure to turn to its experts alienated many career diplomats.\n\nPompeo promised to bring \u201cswagger\u201d back to the State Department, and he named a number of career diplomats to top posts. At the same time, he has been exceptionally careful not to show any differences between himself and Trump, so he\u2019s often not publicly defended his department.\n\nFor instance, he\u2019s said virtually nothing in public to criticize Trump\u2019s repeated efforts to dramatically cut the State Department\u2019s budget. He\u2019s insisted that he won\u2019t tolerate political retaliation against career staffers, but he\u2019s failed to take steps that many staffers feel is necessary to hold people accountable.\n\nIn some cases, it\u2019s not clear what Pompeo can do. He has not fired Moley, for example, but, according to his aides, that\u2019s because Moley holds a Senate-confirmed role and Pompeo legally can\u2019t oust him. Department leaders have counseled Moley about his actions and say they are implementing a \u201ccorrective action plan\u201d for his bureau. They won\u2019t say, however, if Pompeo has ever asked Trump to use his authority to fire Moley.\n\nA former State Department official told POLITICO that Pompeo tried to protect Yovanovitch behind the scenes, and that his decision to pull her out of Kyiv early may have helped her. She wasn\u2019t fired by Trump; instead, she\u2019s still on the U.S. payroll and spending time at Georgetown University. Yovanovitch could not be reached for comment.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201909/895/1155968404_6090747453001_6090743461001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\"\n\nPompeo listened in on the July 25 call between Trump and Zelensky, according to a Wall Street Journal account that the State Department is not disputing. But he\u2019s ignored or deflected questions about the call and his decision to withdraw the ambassador.\n\nThe secretary\u2019s letter Tuesday offered some of his most effusive praise of his employees. \u201cI will use all means at my disposal to prevent and expose any attempts to intimidate the dedicated professionals whom I am proud to lead and serve alongside at the Department of State,\u201d he wrote.\n\nBut given the context, lawmakers and many in the career ranks didn\u2019t buy his concern as sincere. Three Democratic House committee chairmen \u2013 Eliot Engel of New York, Adam Schiff of California, and Elijah Cummings of Maryland \u2013 accused Pompeo of trying to bully people from appearing on the Hill.\n\nPompeo \u201cshould immediately cease intimidating Department witnesses in order to protect himself and the President,\u201d the lawmakers wrote. \u201cAny effort to intimidate witnesses or prevent them from talking with Congress\u2014including State Department employees\u2014is illegal and will constitute evidence of obstruction of the impeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\nPompeo\u2019s letter also drew derisive comments from people who remember his time as a congressman, when he loudly pressured the Clinton-led State Department to release information about the 2012 attack that killed four Americans, including an ambassador, in Benghazi, Libya.\n\n\u201cIt is a bit rich,\u201d said Gordon, who reported to Clinton during her time in Foggy Bottom.\n\nSome veteran government employees fear the revelations from the impeachment inquiry will further demoralize the Foreign Service and others who work for the State Department.\n\nOne sign of that? Since the memo detailing Trump\u2019s call with his Ukrainian counterpart was released, dozens of Foreign Service officers have joined a private Facebook group for those considering quitting their jobs, a member of the group told POLITICO.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/ed/8e/bc84b8ab412ca28a960d4fc5fa09/20191001-mike-pompeo-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
