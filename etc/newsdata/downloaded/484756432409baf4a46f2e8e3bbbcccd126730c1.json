Men had stronger adverse reactions than women.\n\nRoss Dalzell, of Barclays Smart Investor, says: 'It's clear the industry needs to rethink the way we talk about investing.'\n\na.murray@dailymail.co.uk", "description": "Participants in the trial, run by researchers at Goldsmiths, University of London, were asked to fill in questionnaires about their feelings and complete a 'Stroop test' to assess their reaction times.", "authors": ["Amelia Murray For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
