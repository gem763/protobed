Having overcome the tricky and hardened challenged posed by the Springboks \u2013 a side that, since 2016, is slowly returning to its former glories \u2013 it\u2019s a safe assumption to make.\n\nBecause, the reality is, the All Blacks are only going to get better from here on in. Saturday\u2019s performance offered just a glimpse of what is in store from Steve Hansen\u2019s men as they move find their form and rhythm on the sport\u2019s grandest of stages. Hansen himself was quick to point this out in his post-match press conference.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

No, but you\u2019re never going to be at this stage of the tournament.\u201d Indeed, like an iceberg in cold waters, there\u2019s so much more beneath the surface to this New Zealand side.\n\nTake the Richie Mo\u2019unga-Beauden Barrett tandem. Hansen had gambled in deploying the dual playmaker approach, something that had yielded mixed results in their last outing together against South Africa over the summer. Here, though, the two men pulled the strings, with their vision, pace and intelligence put to good effect once the All Blacks had readjusted to their opponent\u2019s rush defence.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

After operating within the same passing line for the opening 20 minutes, Mo\u2019unga and Barrett split to either side of the ruck, offering themselves as potential first receivers in both directions. The manner in which these two players chop and change, mix and match, doing so frequently and unexpectedly over the course of 80 minutes, is only going to improve with time and practice as the World Cup progresses. It\u2019s a terrifying option, one that will becoming increasingly hard for opposition teams to counteract.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only going to get better,\u201d Barrett said of his partnership with Mo\u2019unga after the win. \u201cI love playing with Rich, he\u2019s a super talent and hopefully for this team we can figure out how we get the best out of other and do what\u2019s best for this team. We\u2019ve got a lot more potential in us. It\u2019s exciting.\u201d\n\nBarrett, in particular, is set to tap into a rich new vein of talent from full-back. With extra time and space at his disposal, the two-time World Champion can burn the furnace to reach greater speeds, hit the gaps and unlock opposition defences before seeking the offload \u2013 such is the efficacy of his handling. We saw it against South Africa. The 28-year-old looked charged every time he received the ball from deep, a fizzing, bucking force of energy, while his kicking adds yet another dangerous weapon to New Zealand\u2019s arsenal.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s an outstanding player and on his day he\u2019s the best player in the world and we saw that tonight,\u201d Mo\u2019unga said. \u201cI could hear him and I was trying to give him the ball every time he wanted it. When Beauden Barrett wants the ball, you just give it to him and watch out.\u201d In what was just his second game in this set-up, it\u2019s scary to think the heights he will scale at this World Cup.\n\nHansen\u2019s second gamble came in the shape of George Bridge and Sevu Reece, two wings who have combined for just five previous Test starts. Nonetheless, both men showed what they\u2019re capable of to spark New Zealand\u2019s 17-point turnaround in the first half.\n\nIt was Reece who initially received Mo\u2019unga\u2019s cross-field kick, speeding away from Makazole Mapimpi down the right flank before feeding Ardie Savea. From there, the ball was recycled, with South Africa\u2019s rush defence out of sorts, and eventually worked to Bridge on the opposite side of the pitch to drive home his side\u2019s first try. Within a matter of seconds, the All Blacks had sprung into life after a period of sustained pressure from the Springboks. If this is what they\u2019re capable of with their backs against the wall, imagine what is to come from New Zealand in full control of the flow of play.\n\n\u201cThe boys showed a lot of fortitude,\u201d Hansen afterwards. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get a lot of chances but when they came, we took them.\u201d This was ultimately the difference in Saturday\u2019s clash. As these two heavyweight giants lined up against one another under the bright lights, exchanging fierce blows in what Hansen described as a \u201ctitanic\u201d struggle, it was the Kiwis who made sure theirs counted. Assuming they don\u2019t recline into a state of complacency after overcoming this sizeable challenge, things are only going to get better for New Zealand.", "description": "It was a passing comment made by Rassie Erasmus in the wake of defeat, one that was uttered with any real consideration\u00a0but said so much about perceptions of the All Blacks. \u201cI think New Zealand\u00a0will have some tough competition going through to the final,\u201d the South Africa\u00a0coach said as he reflected upon the Yokohama spectacle that had unfolded moments earlier.", "authors": ["Samuel Lovett"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/22/04/new-zealand.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
