People are hungry. Neuquen is the richest province in the country, and yet we\u2019re living like this? It\u2019s a disgrace.\u201d\n\nMr Macri started well - attempting to peel back 20 years of Peronist economic illusion by resuming the publication of financial data, stripping away subsidies, and resolving long-standing feuds with international financial organisations.\n\nBut that soon stalled, due to both bad luck \u2013 the worst drought in 40 years, the US raising interest rates \u2013 and arrogance. Mr Macri seemed to believe his pro-business rhetoric was enough.\n\nBy 2018 the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had approved the largest bailout package in its 73-year history \u2013 a $57 billion loan designed to shore up the country\u2019s faltering economy and end its pattern of cyclical crises. The cash injection has not worked and Argentina\u2019s annual inflation rate is the highest in the region at 54 per cent.\n\nThe Peronists have a new face in Alberto Fernandez, a 60-year-old former Cabinet secretary, but Mrs Kirchner still looms large as his running mate.\n\nAlberto Fernandez, who polls say is on track to be elected as president on Sunday, with his running mate, Cristina Kirchner More\n\nIn May she arranged a meeting with Mr Fernandez to inform him, he said, that she was choosing him as the candidate. She would only run as his vice president \u201cbecause the country needs someone who does not divide, but rather unites,\u201d he recounted.\n\nHe insists he is more than just her puppet, but few believe him.\n\nThe announcement of her position on the ticket destabilised financial markets, as investors realised with horror that South America\u2019s second-largest economy could soon be ruled once more by a populist who delighted in disrupting the international financial order.\n\nThe charismatic 66-year-old, who has been frequently compared to Eva Peron, has 11 corruption, bribery and money laundering cases pending against her dating from her time as president between 2007-15.\n\nShe denies the allegations, describing them as politically-motivated, but the testimony of her former chauffeur has been particularly damning.\n\nIn court testimony, he described driving bags of cash bribes to her from construction companies \u2013 40 bags of money were even stashed away inside the mausoleum of Mrs Kirchner\u2019s late husband and predecessor, Nestor, who died in 2010.\n\nHer former planning minister is now serving a six-year sentence after he was caught throwing $9 million in cash over the wall of a convent outside Buenos Aires, in an attempt to hide it from investigators.And at the start of the year the newspaper Clarin calculated that 28 of her former officials or business associates were behind bars, mainly on corruption charges.", "description": "When Andrea Espinosa began offering food from her home in the Argentinian district of Neuquen eight years ago, it was just to hungry school kids.
