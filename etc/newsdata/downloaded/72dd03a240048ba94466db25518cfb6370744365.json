The report was similar to an allegation lodged against Kavanaugh last year by former classmate Deborah Ramirez. Stier informed senators and the FBI of the incident during Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation hearings, but it was never investigated, according to the Times.\n\nAt the time, Christine Blasey Ford publicly accused Kavanaugh of pinning her to a bed and trying to take off her clothes at a high school party, and she testified before senators at the hearings.\n\nFollowing the Times\u2019 story, Castro called for Kavanaugh\u2019s impeachment, tweeting: \u201cIt\u2019s more clear than ever that Brett Kavanaugh lied under oath.\u201d He called Kavanaugh\u2019s ascendence a \u201cshame to the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s more clear than ever that Brett Kavanaugh lied under oath. He should be impeached.\n\n\n\nAnd Congress should review the failure of the Department of Justice to properly investigate the matter. https://t.co/Yg1eh0CkNl \u2014 Juli\u00e1n Castro (@JulianCastro) September 15, 2019\n\nRep. Sean Casten (D-Ill.) echoed Castro\u2019s accusation that Kavanaugh lied under oath to the United States Senate, adding that the majority of senators \u201cdidn\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t feel like we talk enough about the fact that Kavanaugh lied under oath to the United States Senate and the majority of United States Senators didn\u2019t care. https://t.co/YY5OGMUqXb \u2014 Sean Casten (@SeanCasten) September 14, 2019\n\nFormer U.S. attorney Joyce Vance called for a \u201cfull congressional investigation\u201d into Kavanaugh\u2019s behavior and a probe into his past to \u201cdetermine whether someone, and if so who, gave orders that kept the FBI from investigating credible allegations.\u201d\n\nThere must be a full Congressional investigation to determine whether someone, and if so who, gave orders that kept the FBI from investigating credible allegations & speaking to witnesses who reached out to them. We were told this was a full investigation. https://t.co/sp6JhfJZti \u2014 Joyce Alene (@JoyceWhiteVance) September 15, 2019\n\nAnother former U.S. attorney, Harry Litman, called the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh a \u201ctotal con job.\u201d\n\nNY Times find 7 people who heard about the Ramirez incident years before. But per WH instructions, and Senate R insistence, the FBI interviewed none of them or 18 other witnesses. The renewed background investigation was a total con job.https://t.co/MoeVUv0dce \u2014 Harry Litman (@harrylitman) September 14, 2019", "description": "The presidential contender and some former U.S. attorneys also called for an examination of investigation failures from Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7dbe653b0000039fd3a53d.jpeg?cache=06oa0dtgzk&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
