Some of the women \u2013 though not all \u2013 were forced into prostitution.\n\nOne was turned back at Calais by UK Border Force officers.\n\nShe had no possessions or money and was accompanied by Gombar, who had two suitcases containing his possessions. He abandoned her at the ferry port.\n\nJurors today returned verdicts after more than five days of deliberations.\n\nGombar was found guilty of 13 charges involving eight of the women. An accusation involving a ninth woman was found not proven.\n\nWagle was convicted of four charges mainly involving one of the victims.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nSandorova was meantime guilty of six charges featuring two women. Adam was finally convicted of seven charges involving three victims.\n\nLord Beckett remanded the gang - all from Govanhill - in custody pending sentencing for reports.\n\nThey will return to the dock in Edinburgh on November 8.\n\nThe trial, which lasted around seven weeks, heard how all of the women had come to Scotland with the promise of a better life and a job.\n\nBut, they were either forced to take part in marriages against their will or made to work as prostitutes.\n\nJurors heard the harrowing stories of the vulnerable victims who arrived penniless, with no possessions and only the clothes they were wearing.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nTheir ID cards, which could have helped them to flee back home were snatched.\n\nThe women - who did not speak any English - were watched and never allowed out on their own.\n\nThe horrific crimes only came to light after one brave woman managed to escape and run to a shop in the southside of the city for help.\n\nShe spoke only Roma and Slovakian - but, the shopkeeper - who did not understand her - phoned police.\n\nThe officers asked two young girls in the store to help with translation.\n\nThey then managed to work out that Gombar had her ID card. The document was found in Gombar's flat.\n\nProsecutor Kath Harper said: \u201cVojtech Gombar shows a startlingly clear, compelling and powerful pattern of behaviour in recruiting, transporting and exploiting these women.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"He exploited them by either forcing them into marriage with virtual strangers from which he benefitted financially and/ or forcing them into prostitution from which he and his associates benefitted.\u201d\n\nThe court heard that one of the women was forced to have sex with two or three men Pakistani men in a day for at least eight months.\n\nMs Harper said: \u201cHer autonomy was completely stripped from her and her body became nothing but a vehicle for Gombar and others to make money.\n\n\"It is perhaps hard to imagine a more callous and uncaring way to treat another human being.\u201d\n\nOne woman told of how Sandorova gave her a short skirt and 'sexy' clothing so that she would look more provocative and make money from prostitution.\n\nAnother victim overheard a conversation between Adam and Gombar.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nShe told the court: \u201cI believe he was involved in a similar thing to what Vojtech Gombar was doing, like taking girls and so on.\n\n\u201cAt the time he had no girls, however I heard him say he be doing the same thing as Gombar, according to what I heard he was planning to get girls for sale.\u201d\n\nMs Harper said: \u201cRatislav Adam was acting along with Gombar in controlling one woman and keeping her in servitude, if not slavery.\n\n\"He sold a woman in the city centre of Glasgow along with Jana Sandorova to Anil Wagle.\n\n\u201cAfter varying amounts of time the women did get away, but it was rarely anything to do with the accused.\u201d\n\nLord Beckett heaped praise on the Slovakian authorities in helping get justice in Scotland.\n\nHe said: \"Without the invaluable, international co-operation this trial could not have taken place.\n\n\"Their efforts has allowed justice to be done in relation to very serious and damaging criminal conduct.\"", "description": "The human tracking group lured their victims from Slovakia with \"false promises\" of a better life and job", "authors": ["Wilma Riley", "Grant Mccabe", "Image", "Spindrift", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20562299.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-Glasgow-gang.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
