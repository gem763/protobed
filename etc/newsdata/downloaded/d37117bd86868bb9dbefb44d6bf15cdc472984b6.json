Some are waiting to be given refugee status. Some have already had their applications rejected, and face a very uncertain future.\n\nDriven from their home countries by the threat of war or persecution, many asylum seekers choose to escape to Hong Kong, a relatively safe, stable region. The majority come from South Asia, while some are from Southeast Asia, and a small minority are from Africa.\n\nTo be an asylum seeker is to exist in a kind of limbo: waiting for refugee status can take as long as 15 years, and in the meantime, asylum seekers cannot work. Homeless and unemployed, they depend on supermarket coupons from the government, live in shared dormitories, and are given the lowest priority at public hospitals\n\nIt may not be home, but the volunteers at Christian Action do their best to make the spaces as welcoming as possible, providing books and other entertainment.

They also work to raise public awareness about what it\u2019s like to be an asylum seeker in Hong Kong through events like the Refugee Walk.\n\nThe tour begins in Arthur Street in Yau Ma Tei, and ends at Chungking Mansions in Tsim Sha Tsui, stopping at facilities along the way that were built to provide aid or shelter to refugees and asylum seekers.\n\nThe first place we stop at is Yau Ma Tei Community Centre. This is where asylum seekers in Hong Kong need to go when they first arrive in the city. Here, they can meet with lawyers to discuss the process of getting refugee status. Until they receive this status, they cannot have a permanent home.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s dying trades: a tour of pawnshops, coppersmiths and more with \u2018Sunset Survivor\u2019 author Lindsay Varty\n\nThis is when social workers like Andrews step in. The Christian Action Centre for Refugees \u2013 our next stop on the tour \u2013 provides halls of residence for those in need.\n\nOne of the asylum seekers we meet there is an elderly South Asian woman, who gives us a tour of her temporary home.\n\nShe lives in a small, dim flat with 11 bedrooms, a toilet and a kitchen shared between 20 people. She carries her identification papers \u2013 bearing her name and nationality, but no known birth date \u2013 at all times. She tells us tearfully that she left her home country to escape conflict, that she lost many things when she left, and hopes she can see her children again one day.\n\nPeople living at the centre often have to rely on donations or government coupons to buy food and clothing.

In addition, they offer classes in everything from English and Chinese to music and knitting. British Council also provides English lessons and organises weekly debates.\n\nAs we walk, we hear stories of asylum seekers and refugees who have had to overcome extreme hardship: leaving families behind, surviving on just one meal a day, and waiting years to be able to live with the same rights as everyone else. But with hard work and the unwavering support of volunteers, they have all found a place to call home.\n\nEdited by Charlotte Ames-Ettridge", "description": "We spoke to some of the people being helped by Christian Action about the hardships they must endure while their applications are processed.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/9b66933c-ee3b-11e9-9f3d-785f2d889e39imagehires153124.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
