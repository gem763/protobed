The feature lets users remove unwanted objects videos, and it uses Adobe Sensei\u2019s machine learning platform to replace the tediousness of having to edit frame by frame.\n\nWhile content-aware fill in Photoshop can remove unwanted objects from still images, today\u2019s feature is impressive because it can automatically track objects in moving scenes and replace the missing pixels. The feature was first previewed at Adobe Sneaks in 2017 under the name Project Cloak as an experimental tool. The tool is available now for Creative Cloud subscribers. It\u2019ll come in handy for post-production editing, like removing boom mics, special effects wires, or people who inadvertently make their way into the final shot.\n\nAhead of the NAB 2019 show for video professionals, Adobe also released some updates to its other video-editing software, some of which are also powered by Adobe Sensei. Auto-ducking for Ambience uses AI to analyze other audio clips for a seamless mix in Audition and Premiere Pro. A new Freeform Project Panel lets editors better organize and storyboard their clips in Premiere Pro, and Character Animator is getting better puppet rigging.\n\nYou can learn more about the spring 2019 releases here and get a detailed how-to on the process on Adobe\u2019s blog here.", "description": "Adobe\u2019s After Effects now has the power of Photoshop\u2019s content-aware fill for video, as introduced in its latest update.
