As a leader on the golf course, some of the younger ones and rookies really look up to her and respect her and I think it\u2019s great to have that experience on the golf course.\n\n\u201cI had no doubt in my mind she would be an asset for the team so I broached the subject with her (of selection) and I think she was really quite delighted.\u201d\n\nWhile Matthew opted for experience, her counterpart Inkster put more weight on current form when she overlooked nine-times veteran Cristie Kerr, whose 21 career points is a U.S. team record.\n\nMichelle Wie is not on the team either, as the former child prodigy was not available as she rehabilitates a debilitating wrist injury.\n\nInkster said she would have loved to have picked 41-year-old Kerr, but could not ignore the form of a player without a top-10 finish since May.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s kind of struggled this year,\u201d said Inkster.\n\n\u201cIf I saw any light at the end of the tunnel, I probably would have picked her in a heartbeat.\u201d\n\nInkster maintained she was not concerned at her team\u2019s overall inexperience.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re young but I think we\u2019re good,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of players with a lot of heart and I really think they won\u2019t be intimidated, which I like.\u201d", "description": "Even though women's golf is dominated by Asian players who are not eligible for this week's Solheim Cup, the event nonetheless remains a highlight of the calendar with two evenly-matched teams and a genuine rivalry nearly three decades in the making.", "authors": ["Andrew Both", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1427922463&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8811I-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
