Maybe we\u2019ll give that a shot someday,\" he said.\n\nTrump's reference Monday was clearly facetious, even eliciting a laugh from Infantino. Still, it's noteworthy given that some Democrats \u2014 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi among them \u2014 have expressed doubts about whether he'd respect the results of an election that ousted him from the White House.\n\n\"I hope you're going to remember me in 2026,\" Trump told Infantino.\n\n\"Oh, for sure,\" he replied.\n\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this story misspelled Xi Jinping's name.", "description": "Trump might have to stay until the 2026 FIFA World Cup, he told FIFA chief Gianni Infantino.", "authors": ["Arren Kimbel-Sannit"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/43/f5/725818274e7baba3f664b0cfe1de/20190909-trump-fifa-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
