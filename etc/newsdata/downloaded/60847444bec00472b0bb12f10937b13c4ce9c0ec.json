Mr. President: don't listen to Lindsey Graham and Chuck Schumer and others who\u2019ve been wrong for so long,\u201d referring to the longtime senators.\n\nThat same evening, a largescale U.S. Special Operations forces raid on a compound in northern Syria\u2019s Idlib Province occurred where the terrorist leader was thought to be hiding.\n\nCheney tweeted Sunday evening in response to Paul\u2019s tweet: \u201cLast night, while @randpaul was advocating withdrawal of our troops, those troops were engaged in a daring raid to kill the ISIS leader.
