I\u2019ve always wanted to go forward and help the team to create as many chances as possible.\n\n\"It\u2019s obviously down to the lads to put the ball into the back of the net, because football is a team game and without them this record wouldn\u2019t be possible.\n\n(Image: Guiness World Records)\n\n\"It\u2019s an unbelievably proud moment for me and my family, and something I hope will stand for a few years.\u201d\n\nAlexander-Arnold credited fellow Liverpool full-back Andy Robertson for spurring him on to the record.\n\nHe and Robertson dominated the right and left-hand sides for Liverpool last season, and their friendly rivalry for who could achieve the most assists spurred them on to a combined 29 assists in all competitions.\n\nLeft-back Robertson achieved an impressive 11 assists in the Premier League, and a further two in the Champions League, leaving Alexander-Arnold with the Guinness World Records title and the bragging rights.\n\n(Image: Andrew Powell)\n\nAlexander-Arnold said of Robertson: \u201cHe probably thought he had the competition wrapped up! Near the end of the season we both hit really good form, we were both getting lots of assists and it was good to help the team in those games that we needed to win.\u201d\n\nHe also thanked centre-back and PFA player of the year Virgil van Dijk, saying: \u201cHe is a world-class player and the best I have played with. We benefited a lot last season knowing we have players like Virgil giving us the protection behind us.\"\n\nThat corner to set up Origi for the semi-final winner against Barcelona at Anfield was surely Alexander-Arnold's most famous assist of the season - and perhaps the most important.\n\nHaving placed the ball by the corner flag, the right-back pretended to walk away before quickly turning back and whipping in a cross for the unmarked Origi to fire home, competing a 4-0 win to seal a 403 aggregate victory.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nAlexander-Arnold said: \u201cI looked over into the box and saw that all the Barcelona players had switched off. I saw Divock in there and thought \u2018why not?\u2019\n\n\"It was a really special goal - everything fell into place so perfectly. Hopefully it will stay in the memories of everyone who was there or watching that night.\u201d\n\nAmong the other footballing record-breakers to appear in Guinness World Records 2020 are:\n\nYoungest player to be nominated for the Ballon D\u2019Or - Killian Mbapp\u00e9 (18 years, 293 days)\n\nFirst winner of the women\u2019s Ballon D\u2019Or - Ada Hegerberg\n\nMost goals scored in the UEFA Women\u2019s Champions League - Anja Mittag (51)\n\nFastest goal scored in the EPL - Shane Long (7.69 seconds)\n\nYoungest player to score a hat-trick in the UEFA Europa League - Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix (19 years, 152 days)\n\n(Image: Rodrigo Jimenez/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nMost regular season goals in the National Women\u2019s Soccer League - Samantha Kerr (63)\n\nMost goals scored in La Liga - Lionel Messi (417)\n\nMost World Cup finals as captain - Rafael Marquez (5)\n\nOldest player at a FIFA World cup - Essam El-Hadary (45 years, 161 days)\n\nMost EPL Hat-tricks - Sergio Ag\u00fcero and Alan Shearer (11)\n\nThere are 34 pages dedicated to record-breaking sports stars in Guinness World Records 2020, out now priced \u00a320.
