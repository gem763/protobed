REUTERS/Stephen Lam\n\nThe social media giant is putting $10 million into the \u201cDeepfake Detection Challenge,\u201d which aims to spur detection research. As part of the project, Facebook is commissioning researchers to produce realistic deepfakes to create a data set for testing detection tools.\n\nThe company said the videos, which will be released in December, will feature paid actors and that no user data would be utilized.\n\nIn the run-up to the U.S. presidential election in November 2020, social platforms have been under pressure to tackle the threat of deepfakes, which use artificial intelligence to create hyper-realistic videos where a person appears to say or do something they did not.\n\nWhile there has not been a well-crafted deepfake video with major political consequences in the United States, the potential for manipulated video to cause turmoil was recently demonstrated by a \u201ccheapfake\u201d clip of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, manually slowed down to make her speech seem slurred.\n\nIn August, the Democratic National Committee demonstrated the threat from deepfake videos by creating one of its own Chairman Tom Perez, to make the audience at hacker convention Def Con think the real Perez had Skyped into the conference.\n\n\u201cThey (deepfakes) lower the bar for an adversary that wants to create manipulated media,\u201d said Matt Turek, who runs DARPA\u2019s Media Forensics program.\n\nSome researchers are working on systems to authenticate a video or image at the point of capture through digital watermarking. But the rapid evolution of deepfake technology has created an arms race between deepfake creators and those trying to detect videos.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a cat-and-mouse game. If I design a detection for deepfakes, I\u2019m giving the attacker a new discriminator to test against,\u201d said Siddharth Garg, an assistant professor of computer engineering at New York University\u2019s Tandon School.\n\nThe technology is also growing more accessible for less-skilled creators. Last week, a Chinese app called Zao that allows users to convincingly morph their faces onto movie stars rocketed to the top of the country\u2019s app store, though it also faced a backlash over privacy concerns.\n\nSome online deepfake creators have also been tapping into this market for easy-to-make deepfakes. Machine-learning enthusiasts based in countries from Poland to Japan are making it easier for people to access custom deepfakes. They are uploading step-by-step YouTube tutorials, charging $30 for 50 words of an AI-powered Trump voice impersonation and running self-service websites that churn out deepfakes.\n\nThe Deepfake Detection Challenge is not the first time that Facebook, which does not currently have a specific policy regarding deepfake videos, has funded academic research into the threat.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff demanded in July that Facebook, Twitter Inc and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google, which owns YouTube, share their plans to tackle deepfakes. Facebook said it is spending $7.5 million on teams at the University of California, Berkeley, the University of Maryland and Cornell University in response to the threat.\n\nOne of these teams, run by UC Berkeley Professor Hany Farid, is building \u201csoft biometric models,\u201d which map real politicians\u2019 facial quirks, from Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019 eyebrow jumps to Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s head turns, to detect if a new video is fake.\n\nFacebook\u2019s new contest, which builds on its ties with these researchers, will involve academics from Cornell Tech, MIT, University of Oxford, UC Berkeley, University of Maryland, College Park, and University at Albany-SUNY.\n\nIn a statement on Thursday, Schiff called the contest a \u201cpromising step.\u201d", "description": "Facebook Inc is teaming up with Microsoft Corp, the Partnership on AI coalition and academics from several universities to launch a contest to better detect deepfakes, the company said in a blog post https://ai.facebook.com/blog/deepfake-detection-challenge on Thursday.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Culliford", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190905&t=2&i=1426680101&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8423G", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
