Tom Baker was \u201cmy\u201d Doctor, so the chances of ever seeing the old William Hartnell or Patrick Troughton adventures were absolutely zero. In the days before endless repeats and on-demand viewing, paperbacks were the only way I could experience those stories.\n\nWhen Star Wars came to my local cinema in early 1978, I immediately bought the novelisation, which was credited to director George Lucas. To my later chagrin, it was the \u201cSpecial Young Readers\u2019 Edition\u201d with a yellow cover; I always wondered what I missed out on by not having the \u201cproper\u201d one. (I assume my parents insisted on the watered-down version for eight-year-old me, for fear of Barbarella-style space sexytimes lurking between its covers.)\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Extra dimensions \u2026 Photograph: David Barnett\n\nOnce I had seen Star Wars at the cinema, that was that. There was no way I\u2019d be taken to see it again, home video was not a thing, so poring over the book, which I have still, was my only way of reliving this amazing, wondrous story. I later learned that although Lucas had the byline, the book \u2013 which hadn\u2019t yet earned the title A New Hope \u2013 was actually written by Alan Dean Foster, the undisputed king of novelisations in the 70s and 80s. Dicks and Foster took up the most space on my childhood bookshelves, the latter writing book versions of a string of blockbusters: Alien, Terminator, The Black Hole, Clash of the Titans, The Last Starfighter, Star Trek: The Motion Picture \u2026 so when my daughter bought the novelisation of Star Wars: The Force Awakens three years ago, I had a weird frisson to see Foster\u2019s name again.\n\nNovelisations have traditionally served the geekier end of pop culture, where merchandise, collectibles and complete sets are more valued than among aficionados of, say, Pedro Alm\u00f3dovar. (There might be a novelisation of Volver out there.) But it is curious that they survived home video, never mind streaming. They\u2019re strange beasts, anyway; we\u2019ve seen the movie, we know how it ends, we know who lives or dies \u2013 so why bother putting it all on the page?\n\nBecause: the best novelisation writers add depth, backstory and extra dimensions to what we see on the screen, flesh out ideas and sub-plots that are wrapped up in a pithy one-liner in the movie, or end up on the cutting-room floor. They can enrich fictional universes \u2013 as with The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams, which began life on the radio, and Neil Gaiman\u2019s Neverwhere, written after the TV series.\n\nGaiman was one of many writers who credit Dicks\u2019s Doctor Who adaptations with firing their own literary ambitions, saying he had decided at 11 that he would one day write a Who episode himself (he did) because Dicks had shown him how. Adam Christopher, author of a Stranger Things novel, has said novelisations \u201cinstilled a love and understanding of story in me\". So there was no question about his future career: \u201cI wanted to be a writer like Terrance Dicks.\u201d\n\nNovelisations are a springboard for both writers and readers \u2013 sometimes in surprising ways. Aged 12, I bought the novelisation of Blade Runner, not knowing that the book with Harrison Ford\u2019s Deckard on the cover was actually Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? I was confused because it bore little relation to the film I\u2019d watched, but also intrigued. I\u2019d never heard of Philip K Dick, but it led me to find out more. It turned out he wasn\u2019t a relation to the Dicks already taking up so much space on my bookshelf, but I didn\u2019t hold it against him.", "description": "As a child in the lost age before video on demand, these screen-to-book stories drew me further into sci-fi \u2013 as well as many authors working today", "authors": ["David Barnett"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f9db6d94e241ae5af6a5b4ec67768376329c6fd/0_0_2534_1520/master/2534.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e3d740d80954777d5dff07a4299f88da", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
