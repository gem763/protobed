Most economists are expecting a rate cut of 25 bps. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has already cut interest rates by 110 bps so far this year. India\u2019s GDP growth has deteriorated to a low of 5% in the last quarter, while the inflation has remained below RBI\u2019s benchmark level of 4%.\n\nEconomists believe that the lingering slowdown concerns and benign inflation will force RBI to lower interest rates, most likely by 0.25%. However, I have a few reasons to believe why RBI could lower interest rates by as much as 40 bps or even 50 bps.\n\nRBI has made it very clear that reviving growth is the highest priority for it right now. However, the economic fundamentals at both global and domestic levels have continued to deteriorate. Let\u2019s first talk about the condition of the global economy. The US and European economies have slowed down tremendously over the past few weeks.\n\nThe private payroll growth for the US came out to be lower than expected in September, while the US manufacturing growth came out to be the weakest in the last ten years. Europe is on the verge of recession now, while China\u2019s economy has also slowed down, clearly getting impacted by the trade war.\n\nBack home in the domestic market, the deterioration in the banking sector continues. Growing NPAs, exposure to the slowing real estate sector, and corporate governance issues are some of the factors behind this deterioration. It all started with the news that over two-thirds of the Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative Bank's assets were exposed to debt-ridden Housing Development (NS: ) and Infrastructure Ltd. Indiabulls (NS: ) shares also declined by a whopping 34% on Tuesday after reports of accounting irregularities and siphoning off of own funds by the owners. Growing NPAs and corporate governance issues have been haunting Yes Bank (NS: ), and its stock has shown tremendous amounts of volatility over the last few days.\n\nAlthough the Indian Finance Minister announced a game-changing reform a few days back in the form of the corporate tax rate reduction, it may not provide the desired results. Another problem for RBI is that the banks are unable to pass the same amount of rate cuts to consumers in the form of lower loan rates.\n\nHence, given the deteriorating global and domestic economy, RBI will have no choice but to make an interest rate cut yet again tomorrow. The only question that now arises is to what extent will it cut the rates. I am keeping my fingers crossed.", "description": "Market Overview Analysis by Investing.com (Puneet Sikka/Investing.com) covering: Housing Development and Infrastructure Ltd, Yes Bank Ltd, Indiabulls Housing Finance Ltd.
