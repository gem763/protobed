He says he has supported the industry more than his Conservative predecessor, spending $4.5 billion (US$3.5 billion) to save a key pipeline project from cancellation, taking flak from the environmental camp in the process.\n\nBut critics including his main challenger, Conservative leader Andrew Scheer, hammer him for abandoning a pipeline through British Columbia, failing to push through another line to Canada\u2019s east coast and passing a law that they say will make major energy projects impossible to approve. Trudeau\u2019s comment at a town hall meeting in Ontario back in 2017 that the country needs to phase out the oilsands has added to the sense that it\u2019s not just specific policies but the industry\u2019s very existence that\u2019s on the ballot.\n\n\u201cDo we want our energy industry to be a global player, or do we want our industry to go into hibernation and we\u2019ll just slowly shut it down?\u201d Derek Evans, chief executive officer of oilsands producer MEG Energy Corp., said in an interview. \u201cThat\u2019s the point we\u2019re at.\u201d\n\nThe source of the dilemma lies in the expanse of forests and marshes surrounding Fort McMurray. These lands contain the world\u2019s third-largest crude reserves, but the sticky bitumen extracted needs to be transported to market, and that means building hugely contentious pipelines. At present, there just aren\u2019t enough of them for an energy sector that accounts for a tenth of Canada\u2019s economy and a fifth of its exports.\n\nIn recent years, rising production from the oilsands has strained against limited pipeline capacity, exacerbated by delays to projects like TC Energy Corp.\u2019s Keystone XL. That has weighed on regional oil prices and prompted companies including Royal Dutch Shell Plc and ConocoPhillips to sell off Canadian assets in a US$30 billion-plus capital exodus.\n\nA year ago, the pipeline pinch reached crisis proportions, sending Canadian heavy crude prices crashing below US$15 a barrel and prompting Alberta\u2019s government to intervene with mandated production cuts to stave off a full collapse. While prices have rebounded, the situation remains tenuous, hitting Alberta\u2019s economy hard and inflaming opposition to Trudeau\u2019s federal government.\n\nThe political predicament is encapsulated in the proposed expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline, which carries the heavy crude extracted near Fort McMurray about 1,150 kilometres (715 miles) westward to a Pacific port near Vancouver.\n\nIn 2013, then-owner Kinder Morgan Inc. of Houston won federal approval to triple the line\u2019s capacity, promising to alleviate the bottlenecks and help Canadian crude reach new markets in Asia. But the proposal hit so much opposition \u2014 legal challenges, protests and a British Columbia government pledging to block it \u2014 that by last year Kinder was ready to abandon it.\n\nThen, in a move that stunned the nation, Trudeau\u2019s government swept in to buy it, vowing it\u2019d be built. Yet the purchase won Trudeau little support in deeply conservative Alberta, and it only hurt his standing with environmentalists, earning him the nickname \u201cJustin Crudeau.\u201d While opposition remains, construction on the project has begun.\n\nNaomi Klein, the prominent Canadian writer and activist, said the purchase highlights the \u201cutterly hypocritical\u201d position Trudeau has taken since coming to power, allowing the oilsands to expand while claiming to make Canada a climate leader.\n\n\u201cWhat we need to be doing is investing the billions of dollars that the Trudeau government has been spending buying pipelines on rolling out renewable infrastructure,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cWe have not done that. We\u2019ve wasted precious time.\u201d\n\nTrudeau\u2019s energy policy thus risks alienating voters on both sides of a debate that is increasingly becoming a key dividing line across Canada. It\u2019s a political reality that Scheer is playing upon, portraying his Conservative Party as a champion of the oil sector and pledging to remove the stricter environmental regulation brought in by Trudeau. With her party polling at a record, Green leader Elizabeth May also sees an opening.\n\nCurrent polls suggest a close race, with Trudeau\u2019s Liberals set to lose their majority. That raises the prospect of a minority Liberal government with the even more environmentally minded Green Party and New Democratic Party \u2014 \u201ca nightmare\u201d outcome for oilsands advocates like Picard, but arguably one in tune with voters in large parts of Canada.\n\nWhat we need to be doing is investing the billions of dollars that the Trudeau government has been spending buying pipelines on rolling out renewable infrastructure Naomi Klein\n\nMay characterizes the election as a referendum on climate, representing Canada\u2019s last chance to help fight global warming. \u201cWe can\u2019t negotiate with the global atmosphere to say, \u2018We need a bit more time,\u2019\u201d said May, whose campaign platform displays a photo of her being arrested protesting against the Trans Mountain pipeline.\n\nThat sentiment has traction across the country in Quebec, where about 500,000 people filled Montreal\u2019s streets for a climate march led by Greta Thunberg last month. Environmentalist opposition from Quebec played a key role in TC Energy abandoning its Energy East pipeline, which would have crossed the province en route to Canada\u2019s Atlantic Coast, displacing oil imports from the U.S. and allowing Canadian oil to be shipped to new markets like India.\n\nBritish Columbia, Ontario and Quebec \u2014 which produces so much hydropower that it has to export some to the U.S. \u2014 have all invested heavily to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, and Alberta shouldn\u2019t get a \u201cfree pass\u201d in cutting its own, said Karel Mayrand, director of the David Suzuki Foundation for Quebec and Atlantic Canada, a non-profit environmentalist organization.\n\n\u201cYou could say \u2018Alberta can export its oil, and Quebec can export its electricity and everyone shakes hands,\u2019\u201d Mayrand said. \u201cBut the problem is that for a growing share of the population, in Canada as well as in Quebec, accepting this means throwing all of Canada\u2019s climate goals out of the window.\u201d\n\nAlbertans meanwhile feel \u201cextreme disappointment\u201d that other provinces have blocked the pipelines that could help its industry, viewing it as an attack on their entire identity, said Rafi Tahmazian, a senior portfolio manager and energy expert for Canoe Financial in Calgary, Alberta\u2019s largest city.\n\nA minority Trudeau government with the Greens\u2019 May and New Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh, both strident pipeline opponents, would create further pain for the industry and lead to turmoil in Alberta, including even increased talk about seceding from Canada, he said.\n\nAt the Trans Mountain terminus near Vancouver, the oil paradoxically arrives in a region banking on a post-carbon, tech-dominated economy. Businesses here pay North America\u2019s highest emissions tax, electricity is generated almost entirely from hydropower, and all new vehicles will be zero-emission by 2040.\n\nLegend has it that the sediments from the deep blue inlet at the Westridge Marine Terminal, the pipeline\u2019s end, were moulded to create the Ur-mother of the Tsleil-Waututh, an indigenous group that\u2019s at the forefront of a legal battle against the expansion.\n\nExpanding the pipeline as planned would mean a seven-fold increase in oil tankers navigating a narrow route through Vancouver\u2019s increasingly congested harbour, and activists say it\u2019s only a matter of time until a spill would occur. Local municipalities and the provincial government have joined First Nation groups in the legal challenge. Vancouver\u2019s mayor was arrested protesting it last year alongside Green Party leader May.\n\nIt\u2019s the sharp end of a dilemma over climate and energy that will confront whichever government emerges from the election.\n\n\u201cThis battle will continue,\u201d said Grand Chief Stewart Phillip, the president of the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs. \u201cIt\u2019ll continue until we finally declare victory.\u201d\n\nBloomberg.com", "description": "The election is a referendum on a dispute central to the country's identity: Is Canada a global oil superpower or is it a leader in fighting climate change?", "authors": ["Kevin Orland", "Natalie Obiko Pearson", "Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/oilsands.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
