I am not sure.\n\nProtester Phil Kingston who glued himself to a DLR train at Shadwell in east London (Extinction Rebellion/PA)\n\n\u201cI think we will have to have a period of reflection. It is too early to say.\n\n\u201cI think we need to take stock of it.\u201d\n\nMr Rees, a PR worker from London, said the intention was not to \u201cinconvenience hard-working people\u201d, and said he did not think the apparently unsympathetic mood on the platform was indicative of a decrease in public support despite many posts on the XR London Facebook page expressing concerns that the stunt was counterproductive and should not have gone ahead.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is not our intention to target individuals or inconvenience hard-working people.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a life or death situation right now.\n\n\u201cThe only thing the Government is interested in is money, so that\u2019s why the transport system was targeted.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re causing disruption but people are impacted, it is nothing compared with the disruption that is coming down the line, let me tell you.\n\nA man trying to dislodge Extinction Rebellion protesters on the roof of an Underground train at Canning Town station in east London (CharWilkoo/PA)\n\n\u201cIt (the footage) was really horrifying, I\u2019m deeply distressed by it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned for everybody who was caught up in it.\n\n\u201cI really hope he (the protester) is all right. My understanding is he is in custody.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it (the footage) is reflective (of the public support).\n\n\u201cThe passive support at the beginning of last week is not what we need.\n\n\u201cWhat we need is active support, people who are willing to get arrested, and that doesn\u2019t have to come from a majority.\u201d\n\nHe said the protests were carried out by activists \u201caffiliated\u201d to Extinction Rebellion, meaning anyone with the same ideals could act under the XR banner.\n\nBritish Transport Police said four people have been arrested after there were also protest incidents at Shadwell and Stratford stations.\n\nThe action is the latest in a series from the anti-climate change group, who have been banned from protesting in London.\n\nA legal bid to overturn the order is expected to reach the High Court on Thursday afternoon.\n\nSince last week, protesters have targeted London City Airport, shut down areas around Parliament and the Bank of England, and blockaded Google\u2019s HQ, with more than 1,600 people arrested.\n\nThe local MP reacted angrily to Thursday\u2019s travel disruption.\n\nJim Fitzpatrick, Labour MP for Poplar and Limehouse, asked: \u201cSo what point is Extinction Rebellion making shutting down east London\u2019s public transport system, preventing ordinary people from getting to work, school, hospital?\u201d\n\nBut XR co-founder Clare Farrell defended the Tube action and said: \u201cThe public, I don\u2019t think, realise quite how serious this situation is.\u201d\n\nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan condemned Thursday morning\u2019s protest, calling it \u201can unfair burden on our already overstretched police officers\u201d.", "description": "Extinction Rebellion organisers said they will `take stock\u00b4 after members of the public reacted with anger over rush-hour disruption.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/11/wire-19831676-1571307240-86_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
