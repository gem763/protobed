He has been having an affair with Cain\u2019s wife Moira (Natalie J Robb) for a number of months but as Cain discovers the truth, he flies off the handle \u2013 with deadly results.\n\nAt first, Cain jumps to the conclusion that it\u2019s Pete Barton (Anthony Quinlan) that Moira has been seeing in secret. Faith (Sally Dexter) has joined the dots but got it somewhat wrong so Cain lures Pete to the farm and takes him hostage.\n\nSeeing how on edge Cain is, Pete fears for his life and eventually blurts out that the one Moira has been sleeping wth is Nate.\n\nDescribing his character\u2019s shock at the revelation, Jeff told Metro.co.uk: \u2018It is not a penny dropping moment. I think it is even more shocking than the Pete thing, as to him Nate is just some mid-twenties farm hand who works for Moira \u2013 not some threat to his marriage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We see at the end of an episode Cain shutting a barn door and the audience are left not knowing what he\u2019s done but then you see next that he\u2019s got fuel in the boot of his car so I think you will wonder what he\u2019s up to.\u2019\n\nCain traps Nate and Moira into going on a fishing trip with him and by the time they realise that he knows about the affair, it\u2019s too late to escape. And things get seriously out of hand as Cain brutally attacks Nate, intent on killing him.\n\nJeff revealed: \u2018Nate is younger, fitter, stronger, taller but they are fairly equally matched as Cain is very fired up \u2013 he finds this inner strength to exact his anger and his frustrations certainly come out.\n\n\u2018I can say that trouble on the boat certainly happens and Moira gets caught up in it too.\u2019\n\nAs Moira ends up underwater and tangled in weeds, a catastrophic explosion ends up ripping through the boat, putting everyone involved at serious risk. Will anyone survive?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Will he resort to murder?", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/22_10_emm_nate_cain_moira_06-ab57_1570448269.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
