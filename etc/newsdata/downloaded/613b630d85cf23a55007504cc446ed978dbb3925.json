To find the best bed for your dog, basic information like your pup\u2019s age and weight will factor in. As well as the more particular stuff like your dog\u2019s sleeping style, if they run hot or need some warming up, whether they chew things, are a nervous pee-er, or love to track mud into the house. Like picking a human mattress, you\u2019ll want to consider what makes your pup most comfortable. Dr. Lisa Lippman, a veterinarian at Fuzzy Pet Health, explains that \u201cdogs can sleep for up to 80 percent of the day, so choosing where they spend all that time is no small decision.\u201d\n\nDr. Rachel Barrack, a veterinarian and the founder of Animal Acupuncture in NYC, suggests beginning your search with your dog\u2019s size. \u201cMeasure from nose to tail,\u201d says Barrack, who recommends opting for a bed that\u2019s slightly too big, giving your pup room to spread out. Because there are so many different styles and brands to choose from, we talked to Lippman, Barrack, and nine other dog experts, including a dog acupuncturist, dog trainers, veterinarians, and one of the internet\u2019s first dog-fluencer parents, about the best of the best in dog beds.\n\nBest Overall Dog Bed\n\nCasper Memory Foam Dog Bed Of all the dog beds mentioned by our 12 experts, this Casper memory-foam dog bed is the one we heard about most. It comes recommended by five of our experts: Barrack, Lippman, Dr. Zay Satchu, co-founder and chief veterinary officer of Bond Vet, Logan Mikhly, co-owner of Boris and Horton, an off-leash dog caf\u00e9 in Manhattan, and Yena Kim, creator and owner of Menswear Dog, a stylish Shiba Inu named Bodhi with over 300,000 Instagram followers. \u201cWe tried a lot of dog beds and currently use a Casper,\u201d says Kim. \u201cIt\u2019s got a memory-foam base, so Bodhi feels rested with full soft support.\u201d Mikhly loves that Casper beds are \u201cdurable and easy to clean.\u201d And Barrack, whose clients rave about their Casper dog beds, says that \u201cbecause it\u2019s engineered by Casper, it\u2019s basically a human-grade mattress.\u201d She also likes that the cover is machine washable and the zippers are hidden \u201cso your dog won\u2019t be able to chew on them.\u201d Satchu says she recommends Casper dog beds after sitting on one herself. She likes that they\u2019re nice-looking, easy to clean, and \u201corthopedic for older dogs to aid with their achy joints.\u201d Though Casper is her current favorite (and Bodhi\u2019s), Kim recognizes that not all dogs have the same needs and advises focusing on what\u2019s unique about your dog before purchasing a new bed. \u201cYou\u2019ll know you\u2019ve made the right choice when you hand your dog a treat and he takes it to his bed to enjoy it.\u201d From $150 at Amazon Buy From $125 at Casper Buy\n\nBest memory-foam dog bed for big dogs\n\nBig Barker 7-inch Pillowtop Orthopedic Dog Bed Two of our experts, Erin Askeland, a certified dog behaviorist and training manager at Camp Bow Wow, and Devin Stagg of Pupford, a company specializing in dog training and healthy dog food, recommend Big Barker bolster dog beds for their durable and supportive foam, which is designed for extra-large dogs and older big dogs with joint pain. Askeland recommends these heavy-duty bolster beds (which Big Barker guarantees will hold their shape for ten years) \u201cfor dogs who like to sprawl and rest their head.\u201d Stagg, whose two Labs sleep on Big Barker beds, is a fan of their machine-washable covers, saying, \u201cEven if your dog is potty-trained, stains and spills can ruin the integrity of a dog bed, so make sure you buy a bed with a cover you can remove and clean.\u201d From $240 at Amazon Buy From $240 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest less-expensive memory-foam dog bed\n\nPetFusion Memory Foam Dog Bed with Waterproof liner & removable cover Askeland has four dogs who sleep on several different beds, including this three-sided memory-foam bolster bed with a water-resistant cover. According to her, it\u2019s \u201can upscale bed with a sturdy, removable cover and very thick, dense foam that doesn\u2019t immediately flatten.\u201d The Petfusion Ultimate bed is around half the price and comparable in size to a Big Barker bed, making it a good choice for folks on a budget or buying in multiples. From $90 at Amazon Buy From $90 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest memory-foam couch-style dog bed\n\nORVIS Memory Foam Deep Dish Dog Bed Like the Big Barker bolster bed, this memory-foam bed from Orvis isn\u2019t cheap. But both Lippman and Askeland, who recommend it, say that you\u2019re better off investing in high-quality products from well-known brands you can trust. \u201cOrvis makes sturdy products that hold up over time. This might be a more expensive bed, but it will last you quite a while,\u201d says Askeland. And Lippman says, \u201cI love Orvis. They have a range of massive beds for large and giant dog breeds, with quality memory foam to comfortably keep their bodies from touching the floor.\u201d From $309 at Amazon Buy From $309 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest less-expensive couch-style dog bed\n\nLa-Z-Boy Tucker Sofa Dog Bed $100 (was $120, now 17% off) Dr. Jeff Weber, a veterinarian in Culver City, California, says most healthy dogs are happy sleeping on the floor, so getting them a dedicated bed is already a \u201cslam dunk.\u201d But for dogs of all sizes with joint problems, you should look for an orthopedic bed. He recommends this sofa-style bed because it\u2019s \u201csoft on pressure points yet firm enough to offer good support for achy joints.\u201d Though it comes in only one size. This La-Z-Boy sofa will run you less than half what the small-size Orvis sofa-style dog bed costs. $100 at Chewy Buy\n\nBest dog bed for skinny breeds\n\n\n\n\n\nPendleton Pet Classics Kuddler Both Mikhly and Dr. Whitney Miller, director of veterinary medicine at Petco, recommend this soft four-sided dog bed from Pendleton. Mikhly\u2019s dog and cat are both fans of the cushy bed. Miller says it\u2019s a great option for the colder months because the recycled high-loft memory fiber keeps leaner breeds off the floor. It also provides cushioning for pressure points like elbows and hips, which if not properly protected \u201ccan lead to pain, skin damage, and in some cases even skin wounds.\u201d $150 at Amazon Buy $150 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest dog bed for older dogs\n\nJax and Bones Dottie Dozer Bolster $56 (was $58, now 3% off) Older dogs and dogs with less meat on their bones may not find extra-thick foam beds comfortable because they don\u2019t weigh enough to sink in at all. Instead, soft, pillowy beds tend to be cozier and easier on their joints. When Barrack\u2019s dog, a 4.5-pound, 11-year-old Chihuahua named Eloise (a.k.a. Lil Weezy) isn\u2019t snuggling next to her owner in a human bed, she sleeps on a Jax and Bones bed. \u201cIt\u2019s a soft, fluffy bed that\u2019s gentle on her older joints. Plus, it\u2019s available in a small size for my little pup and comes in colors that work with my home.\u201d Askeland recommends the Jax and Bones bolster bed because, while it\u2019s soft, it\u2019s also sturdy, and you can remove the pillow and exterior bed cover for cleaning. $56 at Wayfair Buy\n\nBest less-expensive bed for small dogs\n\nBest Friends by Sheri Luxury Shag Faux Fur Donut Cuddler Pet Bed Jessica Gore, a CPDT-KA (certified professional animal behaviorist) in Los Angeles, recommends a shag donut-shaped bed for dogs who sleep curled up in a ball and need some support as well as some extra warmth. \u201cI just love, love, love the Shag Donut Cuddler from Best Friends by Sheri. It\u2019s great for warm snuggling and cuddling and provides just enough support and security for smaller body types.\u201d Gore also stresses that your dog\u2019s bed should be able to stand up to a lot of wear. \u201cExpect your dog\u2019s bed to get used. There may be circling, digging, scratching, dragging, and lots of repeat plopping, which can cause significant wear and tear in no time.\u201d From $35 at Amazon Buy From $35 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest (and most stylish) mattress-style dog bed\n\nDusen Dusen Terra Embroidered Dog Bed Most of our experts suggest keeping several dog beds throughout your home so that your pup has a comfortable place to nap in every room. \u201cMost dogs need more than one bed,\u201d says Dr. Jennifer Coates, a veterinarian who serves on the Pet Life Today advisory board, adding, \u201cDogs want to be where their people are, so make sure there are several in the areas where you spend most of your time and where you expect your dog to spend the night.\u201d Askeland and Mikhly both recommend Dusen Dusen\u2019s flat dog bed, which doubles as a floor pillow because, according to Askeland, \u201cit has a nice removable cover that you can wash and could look nice as part of room d\u00e9cor.\u201d Mikhly says this dog bed is her personal favorite because of its bright colors and how well it blends in with non-dog d\u00e9cor, saying, \u201cIt looks more like furniture than a pet item.\u201d $184 at Nordstrom Buy\n\nBest customizable mattress-style dog bed\n\nBackup Design Indigo Shibori Pet Bed // Medium \u201cThe most common misconception is that dog beds have to be ugly.\u201d says Kimberly Freeman, a dog trainer and canine-lifestyle expert in London. But if you can\u2019t find a dog bed that matches your living-room d\u00e9cor, Freeman suggests getting a custom cover made from a fabric you love. Mikhly recommends this customizable dog bed from Backup Design, which she calls \u201cbeautiful,\u201d saying, \u201cI love the idea of using Etsy to find something unique to fit your personal style.\u201d From $135 at Etsy Buy\n\nBest cave-style dog bed for burrowers\n\nSnoozer Orthopedic Luxury Microsuede Cozy Cave Pet Bed Both Askeland and Lippman recommend this cave-style bed from Furhaven, which comes with a snuggly built-in cover (which you can remove in warmer weather) that Askeland says is \u201cessentially a blanket attached to the top of the bed that a dog can slide under to cuddle.\u201d Lippman\u2019s Rhodesian Ridgeback, Chloe, loves to burrow under the fleece-lined top. She says, \u201cIt\u2019s the perfect bed for pups that love to burrow under the covers and get super cozy before they sleep.\u201d $41 at Amazon Buy $41 at Amazon Buy\n\nThe best cooling cot-style dog bed\n\nK9 Ballistics Durable Chew Resistant Raised Dog Bed- Ballistic Fabric \u201cSome large dogs may prefer a cooler place to plop, like a Bernese mountain dog, so a giant fluffy bed may not be ideal,\u201d says Gore. \u201cK9 Ballistics offer durable dog beds for the larger or heavier types. Their cots are also a cooler option that provide dogs with support and are easy to clean.\u201d Satchu\u2019s dogs use elevated cot-style beds when they\u2019re not sleeping in their kennels. And Weber says his own dogs share his California-king bed with him most of the time, but if you\u2019re not into co-sleeping, he suggests prioritizing practical things like ease of cleaning when shopping for a dog bed. He likes cot-style beds because they\u2019re practically dog-fluid proof \u2014 you can rinse them with a hose and there\u2019s no expensive foam core to worry about. If you want to add a little extra cushioning to your dog\u2019s cot, he suggests adding a soft washable blanket. From $109 at Amazon Buy From $109 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest dog bed for travel or camping\n\n\n\n\n\nKurgo Waterproof Dog Bed This lightweight, waterproof, and packable mat is among the other dog beds in rotation at Askeland\u2019s house. She loves that it \u201ccan be rolled up and carried easily\u201d (it\u2019s also machine washable), making it a perfect travel bed for the car or camping \u2014 or a cold-weather addition to the above nylon cot from K9 Ballistics. $58 at Amazon Buy $58 at Amazon Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
