Harvin would later spend time with the Jets and Bills before calling it a career in 2016.\n\nMaking Harvin's accomplishments all the more impressive is the fact that he apparently did it all high.\n\nIn an interview for Bleacher Report's \"Untold Stories\" series with Master Tesfatsion, Harvin revealed that he was high for every game of his NFL career.\n\nHarvin told Tesfatsion that his marijuana use stemmed from issues he had with anxiety.\n\n\"The only thing that really seemed to work is when I would smoke marijuana,\" Harvin said. \"There's not a game I've played in that I wasn't high.\"\n\nHarvin said he hopes to end the stigma around marijuana.\n\n\"And that's what I want the world to see today. It's not a stigma, or people doing it and getting in a whole bunch of trouble \u2014 it's people that's just living regular life.\"\n\nYou can watch Harvin's full interview below.\n\nWhile the use of marijuana is still banned by the league, several former players have spoken since their playing days about smoking to deal with aches, pains, and, as in Harvin's case, anxiety.\n\nWith marijuana legalization now making its way through some states for both medical and recreational use, it's possible that the league's ban could be the subject of debate during the next negotiations between the NFLPA and the league.\n\nNFL WEEK 5: Our official predictions for who wins this weekend\n\nThe best value plays in your DraftKings lineup for Week 5 of the NFL season\n\n'Believe in your teammate, believe in each other': Patrick Mahomes was mic'd up for a powerful speech ahead of Chiefs' winning drive\n\nNFL POWER RANKINGS: Where every team stands heading into Week 5", "description": "Percy Harvin told Bleacher Report that he was high for every game he every played in the NFL in a candid interview.", "authors": ["Tyler Lauletta"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/544531df6bb3f7bc107d5fb6?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
