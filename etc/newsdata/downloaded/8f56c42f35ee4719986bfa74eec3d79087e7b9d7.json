We highlight the surgical workflow division which has been a soft spot,\" Johan Unnerus, analyst at Pareto Securities, told Reuters.\n\n\"Another reason for the share price reaction is that Getinge's share has lagged the local equity market lately,\" Unnerus added.\n\nThird-quarter net sales and order intake at the maker of products for surgery, intensive care, infection control and sterilisation increased by 4.8% and 3.5%, respectively.\n\nThe company maintained its outlook for 2019 sales growth of 2% to 4%.\n\n\"Operating expenses are reduced sequentially, compared with the preceding quarter, which is a sign that our restructuring measures are starting to show results,\" said Perjos.\n\n($1 = 9.6850 Swedish crowns) (Editing by Clarence Fernandez and Jason Neely)", "description": "By Colm FultonSTOCKHOLM, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Getinge beat  third-quarter core profit expectations, sending shares in the  Swedish medical technology group up...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
