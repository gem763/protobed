He has previously denied some of the allegations, telling the Daily Beast in 2018 that the claim he sold the fragment of the first chapter of the Gospel of Mark to Hobby Lobby \u201cis not true.\u201d An Oxford spokesman confirmed to The Post that it is working with the Papyri Project and conducting its own investigation. The Green family and Hobby Lobby did not respond directly to The Post late Monday, but a museum spokeswoman said Hobby Lobby bought the artifacts \u201cin good faith.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEarly copies of the New Testament are very rare. The oldest, nearly complete copy dates to the 5th century and most substantial manuscript fragments come from no earlier than the 3rd century. Obbink was a decorated scholar who studied these earliest iterations of the Bible and headed the Papyri Project from 1998 to 2016.\n\nIn February 2012, speculation spread that the oldest known biblical fragment had been discovered and examined by a small and tight-lipped group of scholars and artifact dealers. Those who had seen it couldn\u2019t say much about the so-called \u201cFirst-Century Mark.\u201d They all described the text as the first few verses from the Gospel, which was allegedly recorded in the first 100 years after the birth of Jesus. The lucky few who claimed to have laid eyes on the rare and invaluable artifact said they were bound by nondisclosure agreements to keep secret the identity of the Mark\u2019s owner.\n\nFor many prominent religion scholars, the NDA may as well have been a name tag. Only the Green Collection required scholars to sign the agreements at the time, the Daily Beast reported earlier this year. Steve Green, the president of Hobby Lobby who amassed one of the largest private collections of biblical artifacts in the world in just 10 years, even hinted that the fragment might be part of his massive archive. \u201cAt some point it was like, this is an item I want to pursue,\u201d he told the authors of \u201cBible Nation,\u201d when they asked the crafting mogul what he knew about the first-century Mark while researching their 2017 book.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nScott Carroll, who served as director for the Green Collection, publicly said he\u2019d first seen the fragment in late 2011, laid out on a pool table in Obbink\u2019s Oxford office among classical busts and Egyptian funerary masks. He refused to say who owned the verses or whether he\u2019d helped Green buy them.\n\nThe existence of the ancient Bible passage and its possible owner remained a frustrating mystery for nearly six years, until the Egypt Exploration Society published a suspiciously similar fragment from the Gospel of Mark in June 2018. But the ancient Bible story the university published dated to the late 2nd or early 3rd century and had never been for sale, the nonprofit said. The Egypt Exploration Society acknowledged the fragment it published was likely the rumored and ill-named \u201cFirst-Century Mark,\u201d but denied ever asking researchers to sign an NDA.\n\n\u201cProfessor Obbink insists that he never said the papyrus was for sale,\u201d the Egypt Exploration Society said at the time, \u201cand that while he did receive some payments from the Green Collection for advice on other matters, he did not accept any payment for or towards purchase of this text.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat story slowly began to dissolve under scrutiny, officials say. Nearly a year later, the Museum of the Bible, Green\u2019s pet project in Washington, where he displays many items from his biblical collection, shared documents that appeared to show that Obbink had sold the Mark fragment and three other ancient Bible pages, to Hobby Lobby Stores in 2013. In the sales agreement, Obbink had been permitted to retain possession of the fragments for research purposes.\n\nIn June, the Egypt Exploration Society opened an investigation, in partnership with the Bible museum, to suss out what had happened. The nonprofit banned Obbink from accessing the Papyri Project archives. Oxford also opened its own investigation into the allegedly fraudulent sales.\n\nAfter investigating its collection, the Egypt Exploration Society announced on Monday that it had found at least 13 other Bible fragments had gone missing.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe [Egypt Exploration Society] is also pursuing identification and recovery of other texts, or parts of texts, which have or may have been illicitly removed from its collection,\u201d the nonprofit said in a statement Monday.\n\nObbink allegedly swiped the Bible fragments, which include passages from Genesis, Psalms and an ancient copy of the Ten Commandments, in 2010, when Green was in the early years of building his private collection. The catalogue cards and photographs of the texts also disappeared from the Oxford collection.\n\n\u201cThe items referenced were acquired by Hobby Lobby Stores in good faith between 2010 and 2013, but sold by a known expert from Oxford University,\u201d a Museum of the Bible spokeswoman said in a statement shared Tuesday with The Post.\n\nAD\n\nThe Bible museum said Monday it will return the fragments to the Egypt Exploration Society, which will store them once again on the Oxford campus.\n\nAD\n\nThe controversy over the illicit Bible fragments is hardly the first for Steve Green and his museum.\n\n\u201c[The rare manuscript world] is sometimes seen from the outside as seedy,\u201d Carroll told The Post in 2014, during the construction of Green\u2019s museum. Since its opening, the museum and its founder have run into several mishaps involving illicit artifacts.\n\nIn 2017, federal investigators announced that they had been probing Hobby Lobby after the company illegally purchased thousands of ancient cuneiform tablets and clay bullae stolen from Iraqi archaeological sites. The company eventually settled with the Justice Department and agreed to pay a $3 million fine and return all of the illegally imported artifacts to Iraq.\n\nAD\n\nThe Museum of the Bible removed five prominently featured segments of the Dead Sea Scrolls last October after a Trinity Western University researcher told the institution he suspected at least seven of its scroll fragments might be \u201cmodern forgeries.\u201d Fragments from the Dead Sea Scrolls would be from the oldest known copy of the Hebrew Bible.\n\nAD\n\nIn a statement provided to The Post on Tuesday, museum spokeswoman Heather Cirmo said the Bible fragments that belong to the Egypt Exploration Society came to the museum before it adopted a more robust set of policies for assessing the provenance of artifacts in 2016.\n\n\u201cFormer employees who have not been associated with the museum since 2012 made the decision,\u201d to accept the 13 Bible fragments, she said. \u201cSince then, Museum of the Bible curators and registrars began rigorously reviewing all acquisitions and researching documentation and dealers, with special attention on antiquities, items that may originate in modern conflict zones, and agents who are now known to [have] sold items of questionable origin or authenticity.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "The Egypt Exploration Society said a University of Oxford professor illegally sold Bible fragments to Hobby Lobby Stores without permission in 2010.", "authors": ["Katie Shepherd", "Morning Mix Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/m_YyJM07qGC2fTshVRSuOHbU8OI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/D6C56XC56AI6RMVYBCSTRWO32Y.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
