The title of the documents: Project Voldemort.\n\nThe files in Voldemort, a reference to the fictional antagonist in the popular Harry Potter children\u2019s books, chronicled Facebook\u2019s moves that threatened to undermine Snap\u2019s business, including discouraging popular account holders, or influencers, from referencing Snap on their Instagram accounts, according to people familiar with the project. Executives also suspected Instagram was preventing Snap content from trending on its app, the people said.\n\nIn recent months, the FTC has made contact with dozens of tech executives and app developers, people familiar with the outreach said. The agency\u2019s investigators are also talking to executives from startups that became defunct after losing access to Facebook\u2019s platform in addition to founders who sold their companies to Facebook, according to people familiar with the conversations.\n\nFacebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg in Washington on Sept. 19.

Discussions with rivals are typical in antitrust probes, he said.\n\nInside Facebook, senior leaders are concerned about the possibility of rivals divulging damaging information to federal officials and have discussed ways to improve the company\u2019s relationships around Silicon Valley, according to a person familiar with the discussions.\n\nThe FTC investigation is one of several antitrust probes into Facebook and major tech giants in the U.S. and around the world. Earlier this month, the House Judiciary Committee requested Facebook executive communications about the company\u2019s decisions to buy the photo- and video-sharing network Instagram in 2012 and the messaging app WhatsApp in 2014. Lawmakers have contacted several of those companies\u2019 rivals as part of that probe, the Journal reported previously.\n\nThe House panel can\u2019t take enforcement actions against the companies. The FTC, however, can.\n\nRelated: How the Microsoft Antitrust Case Paved the Way for Big Tech The Department of Justice is investigating the largest American tech firms for alleged monopolistic behavior. Roughly 20 years ago, a similar case threatened to destabilize Microsoft. WSJ explains.\n\nOne area of focus for the FTC is Onavo, an Israeli mobile-analytics startup that Facebook purchased in 2013. Onavo offered a free mobile app that described itself as a way to \u201ckeep you and your data safe\u201d by creating a virtual private network. To do this, the company redirected internet traffic on Onavo to Facebook\u2019s servers, which allowed it to log every action in a central database.\n\nThat enabled Facebook to quietly track what users did on their phones, including which apps they used and for how long, the Journal reported in 2017. Onavo data was frequently cited in internal research and strategy decks, according to former employees and internal documents, and helped inform Facebook\u2019s acquisition of WhatsApp for $22 billion in 2014. Facebook shut down the Onavo app earlier this year amid growing scrutiny of its data-collection practices.\n\nSnap was founded in 2011, when Facebook was already the dominant player in social media. It quickly became a social-media hit after its Snapchat messaging app took off among young people. At one point, Facebook\u2014through Onavo\u2014was able to see Snap data as specific as the number of messages a user sent or how much time those users spent in specific Snapchat features, the former employees said. Facebook couldn\u2019t see the content of the messages or images. The visibility into Snap usage lessened considerably after Snap encrypted its app traffic.\n\nA Facebook spokeswoman said the app was similar to other industry market research tools.\n\nAnother focus of the investigation is whether Facebook Chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg acquired or tried to buy startups that he feared would later become competitors, according to people familiar with the investigation. In some cases, after Facebook\u2019s overtures were spurned, the social-media giant copied features of the former targets.\n\nFor example, when Mr. Zuckerberg met with the founders of startups, including Evan Spiegel, chief executive of Snap, and Dennis Crowley, co-founder of Foursquare Inc., he presented them with two scenarios: either they accept the price he was offering for their companies, or face Facebook\u2019s efforts to copy their products and make operating more difficult, according to people familiar with the matter. In both cases, after the companies rejected the overtures, Facebook soon after released features that mimicked the products from Snap and Foursquare.\n\nFoursquare in 2014 started shifting from a consumer-focused app to providing location-based tech and data to businesses.\n\nFacebook rolled out a string of products similar to Snap\u2019s most popular features, including stories, filters and stickers. Snap\u2019s growth waned at times, in part due to competition from Instagram, and it now has around 200 million daily users, less than 15% of Facebook\u2019s total. After a rocky patch in 2018 due in part to a botched redesign, Snap is once again adding users and its stock has rebounded. Snap has also managed to attract more young users between the ages of 13 and 34 in the U.S. than Facebook and Instagram.\n\nThe Facebook spokeswoman said consumers gain more choices when two companies offer similar services and features.\n\n\u201cThis is competition at work and one of the longtime hallmarks of the tech sector,\u201d she said. \u201cBusinesses continually build and iterate on concepts and ideas in the marketplace\u2014making them better or taking them in different directions. This is good for consumers.\u201d\n\nExternally, Snap has often addressed the tension with humor. After Snap launched filters tied to specific regions, in 2014, it created one that only appeared for Snap users at Facebook\u2019s headquarters. The filter showed an image of Snap\u2019s ghost logo laughing, pointing at the user, presumably an employee of Facebook.\n\nA major point of frustration for Snap executives was the belief that Facebook was preventing Snap\u2019s most popular content from trending on Instagram, which they considered to be an abuse of monopoly power. When users uploaded to Instagram videos and images of Snap\u2019s most popular lenses\u2014such as people vomiting rainbows and wearing bunny ears\u2014the users also often included the hashtag #snapchat and the name of the lens.\n\nIn the Project Voldemort documents, according to people familiar with them, Snap executives noted their belief that Instagram was blocking searches of these Snap-related terms and not including this content on Instagram\u2019s \u201cexplore\u201d page where users discover new content.\n\nInstagram representatives also started pressuring influencers to stop adding Snapchat links to their Instagram profile pages, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe Instagram representatives suggested to some influencers that they could potentially void the users\u2019 \u201cverified\u201d status, which signifies that an account is legitimate and popular, according to a person familiar with the discussions.\n\nLosing the blue check mark that comes with being verified can undermine an influencer\u2019s ability to secure paid deals, which can range from hundreds to millions of dollars depending on the influencer\u2019s popularity.\n\nIn 2016, Instagram added a rule that prevented users from adding links to their Snapchat profiles.\n\nFacebook\u2019s tactics have long engendered concern across Silicon Valley, said Paul Keable, chief strategy officer at Ashley Madison. The dating site, which caters to married people seeking affairs, is blocked from advertising on Facebook, which now operates its own dating feature.\n\n\u201cFacebook has created a scenario where they get to pick and choose who wins based on their personal whims,\u201d Mr. Keable said. \u201cAll while running their own competitive products.\u201d\n\nMr. Keable said he hopes he can work with Facebook to improve its relationship with the dating industry. He said he hasn\u2019t been in touch with regulators but will provide information if asked.\n\n\u2014Emily Glazer and John D.
