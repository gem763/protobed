Cory A. Booker of New Jersey backed the millionaire tax cut, which failed on a mostly party-line vote, but several of his rivals for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination dodged the vote.\n\nSens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernard Sanders of Vermont, who are running on tax-the-rich platforms, were no-shows. Sen. Kamala D. Harris of California, a Democratic presidential hopeful who vows to repeal President Trump\u2019s tax cuts \u201cDay One\u201d of her presidency, also was absent.\n\nThe Democrats used a rare procedural move to force the vote that would have reversed the part of President Trump\u2019s law to put a cap on deductions for state and local taxes.\n\nThe measure would have allowed a bigger deduction on federal income tax returns for residents in high-tax states, but more than half of the savings would have gone to families earning more than $1 million a year, according to Congress\u2019 tax scorekeeper.\n\nRepublicans said the entire episode smacked of hypocrisy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s bad enough that my Democratic colleagues want to unwind tax reform, but it\u2019s downright comical that their top priority \u2014 their top priority \u2014 is helping wealthy people in blue states find loopholes to pay even less,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, said before the vote.\n\nThe Democrats sought to remove the new $10,000 cap on the state and local deduction. The cap was placed as part of the 2017 Republican tax bill to end a system under which the federal government essentially subsidized high state and local taxes.\n\nThe effects are more pronounced in solidly Democratic states such as New York, New Jersey, Illinois and California, where higher state and local taxes translate to more lucrative write-offs on federal returns during tax-filing season.\n\nIf the cap was repealed, more than half of the ensuing benefits \u2014 an estimated $40.4 billion in 2019 \u2014 would go to people making at least $1 million, according to a June estimate from the Joint Committee on Taxation, Congress\u2019 impartial tax scorekeeper.\n\nSenate Minority Whip Richard J. Durbin, Illinois Democrat, said the cap needed to be adjusted because it was hurting more than millionaires.\n\n\u201cIt is hitting people in my part of the world, which clearly are slightly above middle class or the upper limits of middle class. Property has gone up so much in value that a family with an ordinary income is paying property taxes that they never dreamed of,\u201d he told The Washington Times.\n\nThe measure, known as a resolution of disapproval, fell in a 43-52 vote with two senators crossing the aisle.\n\nSen. Michael Bennet of Colorado, who also is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, joined the chamber\u2019s Republicans in voting \u201cno.\u201d Sen. Rand Paul, Kentucky Republican, went the other way.\n\nDemocratic opposition to the new cap has been \u201cpuzzling,\u201d said Nicole Kaeding, vice president of policy promotion at the National Taxpayers Union Foundation.\n\n\u201cIt seems to fly in the face of the rhetoric used both by Democratic presidential candidates and then just Democrats in Congress in general,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause limiting the SALT deduction means limiting a deduction that benefits high-income individuals.\u201d\n\nDemocrats argue that many of their middle-class constituents do benefit from the deduction, pointing to IRS data that has shown nearly nine out of every 10 filers who claim the deduction make less than $200,000 per year, and more than half earn less than $100,000.\n\nDemocrats also accuse Republicans of including the provision specifically to punish blue states.\n\nA federal judge recently dismissed a challenge to the new cap filed by a coalition of East Coast states, including New York and New Jersey. The lawsuit accused the Trump administration of imposing an \u201cunconstitutional assault\u201d on state sovereignty.\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, said his state was looking at its options, including a potential appeal.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is this policy is unprecedented, unlawful, punitive and politically motivated \u2014 and it must be stopped,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said.\n\nStates such as New York and New Jersey also tried to pass workarounds that would let their residents effectively pay their state and local taxes as charitable contributions, then write them off on their federal returns to lower their overall tax bill.\n\nThe Trump administration responded with a new rule in June that gutted the workarounds. New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut then sued to try to reverse it.\n\nThe Senate vote would have negated that Treasury Department rule.\n\nThe move let Democratic lawmakers voice their displeasure with the Republicans\u2019 $1.5 trillion tax cuts without having to vote to reverse the entire law, Ms. Kaeding said.\n\nAmong other provisions, the 2017 law also lowered individual tax rates across the board and doubled the standard deduction.\n\n\u201cThe reason why we have not seen a repeal vote in Congress is a repeal of the [law] would raise taxes on low- and middle-income individuals,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so they\u2019re unwilling to take that vote.\u201d\n\n\u2981 Ryan Lovelace contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
