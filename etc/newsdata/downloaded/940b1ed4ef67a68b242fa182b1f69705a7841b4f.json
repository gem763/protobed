Of that number, only 25,000 had registered so far, the NAO found.\n\nThe report also highlighted the fact that in September, the government acknowledged that the arrangements made for the Northern Ireland and Ireland land border were unlikely to be sustainable \"beyond the very short term\" because of \"significant economic, legal and biosecurity risks\", as well as the \"potential for civil unrest\".\n\nAnd although the government had made contingency plans in the event that the UK left the European Union without a deal on 29 March, the watchdog said that some of those plans had not been updated since.\n\nIs the UK ready?\n\nOther plans, systems and infrastructure had \"mostly\" been developed in time for the first day after Brexit, the NAO said, however it said it was concerned that they may not work exactly as planned.\n\n\"Preparing the UK border for EU exit with or without a deal is extremely complex and has required a huge amount of work from many government departments, agencies and third parties such as traders.\n\n\"Despite their efforts, significant risks remain which may have consequences for the public and businesses,\" said the NAO's head Gareth Davies.", "description": "With two weeks to go, the National Audit Office warns governments and firms are not fully prepared.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/16E8B/production/_107353839_hi053222669.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
