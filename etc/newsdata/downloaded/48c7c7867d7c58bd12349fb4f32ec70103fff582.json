I\u2019m back from book leave and back to business. Let\u2019s get this \u2026 party \u2026 started.\n\nThe Commentary\n\nYou might have thought that after \u201cBut her emails!\u201d-ing Hillary Clinton out of the presidency in 2016 (ushering in the questionable brand of leadership we now grapple with daily), political commentators might have reconsidered the outsize level of scrutiny to which we subject female political candidates, recognizing it as both sexist and unproductive.\n\nIf so, you thought wrong!\n\nThis week, Sen. Kamala D. Harris was called upon to account for allegations of sexual assault at her husband\u2019s law firm, a place where she does not and has never worked. And Sen. Elizabeth Warren, newly crowned Democratic front-runner, was diverted from discussing her myriad plans (this week, she revealed two: on climate justice and LGBTQ equality) to defend her claim of being pushed out of her first teaching job for being visibly pregnant. Though the timeline math and testimony from her contemporaries all point to her story being true, it\u2019s still difficult for many to believe that pregnancy discrimination may be present even if one\u2019s boss did not write \u201cReason for Firing: She\u2019s Too Pregnant\u201d on any forms.\n\nWe\u2019ve come a long way, baby.\n\nSpeaking of change, or potential change, at least: Impeachment is heating up! With evidence accumulating and public sentiment shifting rapidly (a new Fox News poll shows that 51 percent of voters would like to see Trump impeached and removed from office, including more than 1 in 10 Republicans), there\u2019s a chance, however outside, that the incumbent might no longer be a shoo-in for the 2020 Republican nomination.\n\nBut what is the Post Pundit 2020 Power Ranking if not a vehicle for obsessing over outside chances? So with that in mind, this week we\u2019ve got for you a bonus ranking: the Top 10 Republicans situated to win the nomination should it not go to Trump. Is Vice President Pence really next in line? Does Bill Weld have a chance? Will a new conservative hero emerge from the shadows of Trump Tower (or, more likely, the Rocky Mountains \u2014 we see you, Mitt Romney!)?\n\nLet us know your thoughts, and we\u2019ll weigh in with ours.

Bush, Marco Rubio, Justin Amash, Don Jr., Rick Scott, Liz Cheney, Bob Corker \u2026 and Ted Nugent\n\nFrom the Annotations\n\nThe perfect-storm scenario: If both Trump and Pence get impeached and removed from office, she becomes president and runs in 2020 as an incumbent. Karen Tumulty, on Nancy Pelosi\n\nMr. Conscience of a Conservative wants Republicans to \u201csave their souls.\u201d Perhaps he could convince voters the best place to buy a ticket to heaven is at the ballot box. And as far as his own celestial fate goes, he might earn some points by running instead of telling other people to do it.
