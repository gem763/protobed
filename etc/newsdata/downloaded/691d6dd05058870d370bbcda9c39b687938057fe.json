Those include ex-Tory, ex-Change UK Lib Dem Heidi Allen - who says public life has been \"utterly dehumanising\".\n\nMeanwhile Speaker John Bercow is finally calling it a day after nearly a decade in the grand chair in the House of Commons.\n\nHere's the full list of MPs who've announced they are standing down so far.\n\nSome of the biggest names\n\nKen Clarke\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nWhen people talk about \u201cTory Big Beasts\u201d, the image they have in their head is 77-year-old Ken Clarke. The Rushcliffe MP holds the title of \u2018father of the house\u2019 - which means he\u2019s the longest serving MP, having been sworn in a few minutes earlier than Labour \u2019s Dennis Skinner.\n\nAnd he\u2019s been a cabinet minister under three successive Tory Prime Ministers - Education Secretary under Margaret Thatcher, Home Secretary and Chancellor under John Major and Justice Secretary under David Cameron.\n\nIn fact, he was one of only five ministers to serve throughout the whole of the 18 years of Tory governments led by Thatcher and Major.\n\nHe\u2019s socially and economically liberal, and has been president of the Tory Reform Group since 1997.\n\nAnd he\u2019s perhaps been the Conservative Party\u2019s proudest and most prominent pro-European voices for several decades. He had the Tory whip removed weeks before finally standing down for voting to block a no-deal Brexit.\n\nJohn Bercow\n\n(Image: UK PARLIAMENTARY RECORDING UNIT HANDOUT/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nCommons Speaker John Bercow announced in September that he would stand down.\n\nHe developed a reputation for standing up for MPs' rights against the government - granting more emergency debates and urgent questions in the Commons.\n\nBut he later faced fierce criticism from Brexiteers, who questioned his impartiality on the issue of Europe.\n\nThe ex-Tory MP succeeded the late Michael Martin as Speaker in 2009.\n\nAmber Rudd\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nMs Rudd's departure means the House of Commons will lose one of its most prominent anti-hard-Brexit MPs.\n\nShe resigned as DWP Secretary in solidarity with 21 Tories who lost the whip in September.\n\nYet she also had changed her position in the past, moving from vowing to block a no-deal Brexit to saying it would have to be left open as an option.\n\nBorn in London in 1963, she was the fourth child of stockbroker Tony Rudd and magistrate Ethne Fitzgerald.\n\nShe went to Cheltenham Ladies' College and Queen's College in London before reading History at Edinburgh University.\n\nShe married the writer A.A. Gill and the couple had two children together in the 1990s but later divorced. Gill, who died in 2016, referred to Rudd as 'the Silver Spoon' in his reviews and she was an aristocracy advisor to Four Weddings And A Funeral.\n\nMs Rudd was forced to resign as Home Secretary over the Windrush scandal after she misled MPs by denying removal targets existed. An internal inquiry later found she was not given full information herself.\n\nHer brother Roland Rudd runs the People's Vote campaign - where he is embroiled in a furious row with his own staff over a botched bid to oust senior staff.\n\nJo Johnson\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nBoris Johnson's younger brother suggested the PM was failing the national interest as he announced he'd quit in September.\n\nThe Orpington MP said he had been \"torn between family loyalty and the national interest\" but that it was \"time for others \" to take on his role.\n\nThe Universities and Science minister had previously quit the government when Theresa May as PM over her handling of Brexit.\n\nRemainer Jo Johnson added that it had been an \"honour\" to serve his constituents since 2009.\n\nSir Nicholas Soames\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nSir Nicholas Soames is an important talisman in Conservative circles as the grandson of Sir Winston Churchill - but lost the whip last month when he decided to block no-deal Brexit.\n\nThe 71-year-old MP for Mid Sussex claimed a no-deal Brexit would be the \"most serious crisis\" Britain has faced since the Second World War.\n\nThe a staunch pro-European who was a minister under John Major, also claimed Margaret Thatcher would not have taken the UK out of the EU.\n\nConfirming his decision he said: \"I will be voting against the government with a very heavy heart.\"\n\nBut he was later spotted grinning during his final vote after 36 years - to trigger an election hours after having the whip restored by Boris Johnson.\n\nOwen Smith\n\n(Image: Christopher Furlong)\n\nThe MP rose to prominence when he took on Jeremy Corbyn for the Labour leadership following the EU referendum in 2016.\n\nHis ill-fated campaign saw him denying making a joke about a 29-inch penis, though he did finish with more than 38% of members' votes.\n\nThe MP of nine years later worked in Jeremy Corbyn's Shadow Cabinet as Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary while Stormont was collapsed.\n\nHeidi Allen\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nLib Dem Heidi Allen will quit as an MP at the next General Election , blaming the \"nastiness\" of British politics.\n\nThe former Tory MP and Change UK leader switched parties more than faced elections after she initially became dissatisfied with the Conservatives over welfare cuts.\n\nShe said she was \"heartbroken\" by the decision, but had become \"exhausted\" from being shouted at in the street and sworn at on social media.\n\nIn a letter to her constituents in South Cambridgeshire, she wrote: \"I am exhausted by the invasion into my privacy and the nastiness and intimidation that has become commonplace.\n\n\"Nobody in any job should have to put up with threats, aggressive emails, being shouted at in the street, sworn at on social media, nor have to install panic alarms at home.\"\n\nVince Cable\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nThe former Lib Dem leader Vince Cable has been one of the party's most controversial figures.\n\nA key figure in the Coalition, where he was Business Secretary, lost his Twickenham seat in 2015 - before returning to Parliament in 2017 and taking on the job of leading his part.\n\nA one-time Labour Party member and ex-economics lecturer, Sir Vince appeared on the Christmas edition of BBC One's Strictly Come Dancing in 2010.\n\nSir Vince, 76, was replaced by East Dunbartonshire MP Jo Swinson and warned there would be \"battles about Brexit to come\"\n\nWhen he became leader in 2017, he was the oldest person to be appointed head of a major party since Winston Churchill.\n\nA grandfather, he is married and has three children.\n\nFull list of MPs standing down\n\nSpeaker\n\nJohn Bercow (Buckingham): \u201cIt is with a heavy heart that I step down as MP for this great constituency\u201d.\n\nTories\n\nNicky Morgan (Loughborough): \"The abuse for doing the job of a modern MP can only be justified if, ultimately, parliament does what it is supposed to do - represent those we serve in all areas of policy, respect votes cast by the electorate and make decisions in the overall national interest.\"\n\nMark Field (Cities of London and Westminster): \u201cThe current speculation that a General Election may be imminent has forced me to make the very difficult decision not to offer myself as your candidate for the next election\u201d.\n\nNick Hurd (Ruislip, Northwood & Pinner): It\u2019s time to \u201cembrace a new challenge\u201d.\n\nJo Johnson (Orpington): \u201cI\u2019ve been torn between family loyalty and the national interest\u201d.\n\nDavid Jones (Clwyd West): \u201cAt a personal level, I wish to dedicate more of my time to my family\u201d.\n\nDavid Tredinnick (Bosworth): \u201cIt\u2019s time to make way for a younger candidate with new ideas\u201d.\n\nClaire Perry (Devizes): \"Stepping down as a Tory MP to run the UN climate talks in Glasgow next year. It\u2019s been the privilege of my life to represent the people of the wonderful Devizes constituency where I live and which I love\u201d.\n\nKeith Simpson (Broadland): \u201cI\u2019m the ripe old age of 70 and I decided some time ago that I will not stand again\u201d.\n\nGlyn Davies (Montgomeryshire): \u201cIt is a difficult time and I will be glad to see the behind of it\u201d.\n\nJeremy Lefroy (Stafford): \u201cIt was the right thing to do to give my association enough time to select a new candidate rather than scrambling around at the last minute\u201d.\n\nRichard Benyon (Newbury): \u201cI don\u2019t think it is fair to the Association to continue the uncertainty about my being eligible to stand, let alone my willingness.\u201d\n\nAlistair Burt (North East Bedfordshire): \u201cIt is unfair for me to present you with a conflict of interest between my views and those of the party at an election\u201d\n\nRichard Harrington (Watford): He said it had \u201calways been my intention to step down at the next General Election\u201d.\n\nMark Prisk (Hertford and Stortford): \u201cThis has been a difficult decision, but I have always believed that if you seek election it must be wholehearted and that you should be committed to serve a whole five-year parliament. I cannot make that commitment\u201d.\n\nMichael Fallon (Sevenoaks): \u201cSadly I have decided that this parliament will be my last. I have served as an MP, for both Darlington and Sevenoaks, for more than 30 years - quite long enough.\u201d\n\nCaroline Spelman (Meriden): \u201cMyself, my family and my staff have borne an enormous brunt of abuse and I think quite frankly we\u2019ve had enough\u201d.\n\nSeema Kennedy (South Ribble): \u201cI have decided not to stand as a candidate for the next general election.It is now time for me to focus on other priorities in my life\u201d.\n\nSir Nicholas Soames (Mid Sussex): \u201cI am not standing at the next election and I am thus approaching the end of 37 years service to this house, of which I have been proud and honoured beyond words to be a member\u201d.\n\nBill Grant (Ayr, Carrick and Cumnock): \u201cI have served my country in some form of public service for 53 years, and to leave that service now when the country is facing such an enormous challenge has been difficult to consider.\u201d\n\nHugo Swire (Devon): \"It was my original intention to stand down in 2022, when the next general election was scheduled to be held.\"\n\nMims Davies (Eastleigh): \u201cI am a single parent of two wonderful girls and, over the last few years, it has been become increasingly difficult to juggle the responsibilities have I first and foremost as a mother and, secondly, as an MP and minister.\u201d\n\nSarah Newton (Truro and Falmouth): \u201cI have decided not to seek re-election at the forthcoming General Election so that I can pursue other interests.\u201d\n\nSir Patrick McLoughlin (Derbyshire Dales): \"I think it's time to let someone else have that opportunity.\"\n\nPeter Heaton-Jones (North Devon): \u201cThis is a purely personal decision. It is based on several factors, including a significant change in my family circumstances since my re-election in 2017. In addition, this has been one of the most intense periods in recent political history, and I think it is telling that a relatively high number of MPs are deciding to stand down now.\u201d\n\nDavid Lidington (Aylesbury): \u201cPolitics imposes a heavy cost on family and private life.\u201d\n\nAlan Duncan (Rutland and Melton): Confirmed he\u2019d be standing down after the election was called.\n\nIndependent former Tories\n\nAmber Rudd (Hastings & Rye): \u201cI\u2019m not finished with politics, I\u2019m just not standing at this election\u201d.\n\nOliver Letwin (West Dorset): His office confirmed his intention to stand down from the Commons at the next election.\n\nGuto Bebb (Aberconwy): \u201cI'm not quite sure why the Conservative Party have decided to become a type of populist English nationalist party and that might work for one election. I don't feel any affinity to that.\u201d\n\nJustine Greening (Putney): \u201cIt is very clear to me that my concerns about the Conservative Party becoming the Brexit party in effect have come to pass.\u201d\n\nKen Clarke (Rushcliffe): \u201cYou've got to hold yourself out as being able to do five more years and do the job properly.\u201d\n\nNick Boles (Grantham): \u201cIt will be time for somebody else\u2026 I\u2019ll go and do one other thing - God knows what.\u201d\n\nRory Stewart (Penrith and the Border): \u201cI\u2019m now coming to the very end of my time in Parliament\u201d.\n\nLabour\n\nOwen Smith (Pontypridd): \u201cThe truth is that Brexit is not compatible with my values. It is a right-wing ideological project, it is a nativist project, it is fuelled by lies and it was delivered deceitfully in 2016.\u201d\n\nRonnie Campbell (Blyth Valley): \u201cIt has been an absolute privilege to serve the people of Blyth Valley and I sincerely thank them for all their support over the years. I feel that it\u2019s time, at my age, that I was put out to grass.\u201d\n\nJim Fitzpatrick (Poplar and Limehouse): \u201cLabour HQ asked if I\u2019ll stand again, here is my official response. In the event of a snap election a volunteer parachutist may be needed if no time for full selection procedures to represent the great seat of Poplar and Limehouse!!\u201d\n\nKate Hoey (Vauxhall): \u201cNow that the national Labour party has started the process for the 2022 election I have decided that after 30 years as the MP for Vauxhall I will not seek re-election as a Labour candidate.\u201d\n\nRoberta Blackman-Woods (City of Durham): \u201cI am afraid it is just time for me to stand down for a whole host of largely personal reasons.\u201d\n\nGloria De Piero (Ashfield): \"I question whether I can give you the commitment you deserve for what could be a further eight years.\"\n\nPaul Farrelly (Newcastle-under-Lyme): \"I also still have a young family to support, and it would not be fair on them, really, to carry on beyond the next election, with all the stresses and strains that go with the job of being a dutiful member of parliament.\u201d\n\nJohn Mann (Bassetlaw) - resigned as an MP before election was called to take up seat in the House of Lords: \"The power of the Prime Minister, Speaker and the whips will all need to be reconsidered if our democracy is to properly function. I am not holding my breath at such maturity.\"\n\nAnn Clwyd (Cynon Valley): \"It has been a great honour to represent the people of the Cynon Valley for so long. I am very grateful for the support for both me and the Labour Party. I will continue to fight for the Labour Party at the next general election - whenever it comes.\"\n\nIan Lucas (Wrexham): \"I am 60 next year. I have been an MP since I was 40. I think the time is right for me to choose to follow a different path in the years to come.\u201d\n\nKevin Barron (Rother Valley): \u201cI am pretty sure that I will be the last Yorkshire miner as an MP, although politics can at times be challenging it is the greatest way of giving a voice to the voiceless.\u201d\n\nGeoffrey Robinson (Coventry North West): \u201cThere is nothing more important or rewarding than helping people, however I need to be fully fit to be able to undertake the job properly.\u201d\n\nStephen Pound (Ealing North) Ealing Labour tweeted: \u201cEaling Labour would like to thank him for the tremendous service given to our community, and many within the community will miss him greatly. Sending you the warmest wishes for the future Steve.\u201d\n\nAdrian Bailey (West Bromwich West): \"My head said that I would be committing myself to work until I was nearly eighty years old and that, whilst I am very fit both mentally and physically, a younger person, more attuned and comfortable with political campaigning in a social media age would be better placed to promote Labour\u2019s policies and values in the next Parliament. Consequently, I have decided that I no longer wish to be considered for re-election.\"\n\nAlbert Owen (Ynys Mon): \"Being an MP is an intense full-time job. My decision not to seek re-election is for personal reasons, I simply want to do other things and spend more quality time with my family.\"\n\nHelen Jones (Warrington North): \u201cI am deeply grateful to the voters here who have elected me at six General Elections.\u201d\n\nJim Cunningham (Coventry South): \u201cIt has been the honour of my professional life to serve as your Member of Parliament for the last 27 years, but the time has come to hand over the baton to someone new.\u201d\n\nStephen Twigg (Liverpool West Derby): \u201cAs I approach my mid-fifties I want to have the opportunity to take on something new\u201d\n\nTeresa Pearce (Erith and Thamesmead): \u201cI have made the decision to not stand at the next election, there are many reasons some personal, some not. But I will be 65 in February and I think it\u2019s time to step away. It has been a real privilege to serve my community in these past nine years.\u201d\n\nLib Dem\n\nHeidi Allen (South Cambridgeshire): \u201cNobody in any job should have to put up with threats, aggressive emails, being shouted at in the street, sworn at on social media, nor have to install panic alarms at home. Of course public scrutiny is to be expected, but lines are all too often regularly crossed and the effect is utterly dehumanising.\"\n\nNorman Lamb (North Norfolk): \u201cI think we are in a very sad and disturbing place in our politics.\u201d\n\nVince Cable (Twickenham): \u201cI would not be able to commit to a five year term from now until possibly 2024/25.\u201d\n\nThe Independent Group for Change\n\nJoan Ryan (Enfield North): \u201cWhen I stood in 2017 I always intended to serve only one more term in Parliament.\u201d\n\nAnn Coffey (Stockport): \"After a lot of consideration I have decided not to stand for election again. Can I thank you all for the support and kindness you have shown to me over the years. It has been much appreciated.\"", "description": "More than 50 MPs are standing down at the 2019 general election - with many blaming the pressures of today's politics.
