These sharp changes in angles trap air and pressure, and disperse the energy outwards, easing the boat back into the water.\n\nTheir efforts will pay off on Tuesday when Defence Industry Minister Melissa Price officially launches their first boat, Whiskey Alpha, at the Pacific Maritime Expo in Sydney.\n\nThe biennial expo bills itself as the Indo-Pacific's most comprehensive maritime industry event, with hundreds of exhibitors across defence and commercial shipbuilding.\n\nAttached to the three-day expo is the Royal Australia Navy's Seapower conference, with senior naval commanders from the US, Indonesia, India, Japan, France and the Pacific among representatives from 35 countries attending. Like so much of public policy, China's rise will be a dominant feature of discussions.\n\nWhen the expo was held two years ago, it set the scene for a final flurry of lobbying over the $35 billion frigate contract and manoeuvring ahead of a looming decision on the offshore patrol vessels. The frigate contract was ultimately awarded to British defence giant BAE Systems.\n\nThis year's event lacks a blockbuster bidding war, with no major shipbuilding or acquisition decisions expected for several years.\n\nInstead it will showcase the small and medium enterprise defence ecosystem emerging in Australia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGovernment data shows that since December 2016, the Defence Innovation Hub has awarded 101 contracts to businesses, worth $145 million, to develop advanced technology, such as autonomous vehicles, enhanced radars, cyber threat countermeasures and improving the accuracy and range of weapons.\n\nMs Price said 85 per cent of these contracts were with small businesses.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re harnessing the innovative nature and entrepreneurial spirit of small business, and it\u2019s starting to have a real impact on the world stage,\" she said.\n\nThe Whiskey Project, which has been nominated for an innovation award, ticks a couple of boxes. It is a veteran-owned start-up and has received advice from the federal Centre for Defence Industry Capability on how to break into the industry.\n\nThe business, which plans to build boats at Morisset on NSW's Lake Macquarie, hopes the Morrison government's $500 million downpayment to upgrade special forces equipment as part of Project Greyfin will open doors to supply the Australian military.\n\nThe navy's current inflatable boats have been involved in 13 capsizings and 19 near misses since 2003, necessitating operational restrictions on their use.\n\nA study found 95 per cent of the US navy's special boat operators suffered an injury in its inflatable boats.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"You'd think 'You just need to toughen up' but injuries are avoidable if we had the right watercraft. We are fixing well-known problems,\" he said.\n\nAs well as military purposes, the ability to customise Whiskey Alpha means the boat could also be attractive to civilian operators, such as police and marine rescue services.\n\nDespite the government's ambitions to make Australia a top 10 defence exporter, recent data shows it has slipped from 18th to 25th in rankings. And there is concern that obtaining defence export permits was taking too long.", "description": "The region's biggest maritime expo gets underway in Sydney this week, giving start-ups a chance to show their wares.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2891%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_21%2C$y_18/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/5cdc5356496b2b4bac6b8ee3dfffee686135541b", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
