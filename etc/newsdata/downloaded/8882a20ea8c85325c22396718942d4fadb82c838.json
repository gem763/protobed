Younger, university-educated people are being wooed by the city's \"lifestyle\" appeal of access and cheaper housing compared to Melbourne and Sydney.\n\n\"We want to be a part of it,\" he said.\n\nThe civic precinct comprises a council-occupied building of around 10,000sq m and a second, slightly larger commercial building. Quintessential is the developer of both. The Geelong council will retain its new headquarters through a fund through-style deal. The second building will be developed, funded and owned by Quintessential.\n\nThe new council HQ will have 10,000 sq m of office space.\n\nThe upside for the council is a project delivered without an increase in rates. In fact, it is forecast to generate a return of around $1.2 million annually once efficiencies and rental returns are factored in, according to Geelong mayor Bruce Harwood.\n\n\"We\u2019re also future-proofing the city\u2019s workplace needs and requirements for the next 20 to 30 years,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe project is a boon for local player Cross Laminated Offsite Solutions (CLOS), creating more jobs at its manufacturing facility in nearby Avalon.\n\n\u201cThe announcement is hugely exciting for CLOS, which is still very new, but clearly the industry is leaning on our commitment to advanced manufacturing,\" said managing director John Fitzgibbon.\n\nTimber for the building product will be sourced from local and global supply chains.", "description": "Through its latest civic precinct deal, Quintessential will have close to a $500 million exposure to Victoria's second city.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5521%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/851e498c57d9395b8b6f88d0f2742698300fd186", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
