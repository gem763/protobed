'Today was my first top-10 win, so I'm super proud of myself for that.\n\n'It was a good match, Kiki played great, and obviously I couldn't ask for anything better so far in this tournament.\n\n'I guess (Linz is) my little lucky place. I got in as a lucky loser and I'm in the semis, so I hope I can keep this going.'\n\nBertens' defeat also means she still has work to do to secure a place at the WTA Finals.\n\nIn the last four, Gauff will take on Germany's Andrea Petkovic, who defeated Viktoria Kuzmova 6-4 6-1.\n\nEighth seed Ekaterina Alexandrova of Russia booked her place with a 6-2 6-4 win over France's Kristina Mladenovic. Latvia's Jelena Ostapenko overcame Kazakhstan's Elena Rybakina 7-5 6-1.\n\nAt the Tianjin Open, Veronika Kudermetova knocked out third seed Dayana Yastremska with a convincing 6-4 6-0 victory.\n\nShe is bidding to reach her first WTA Tour final, and to do so must get past a resurgent Heather Watson, who followed up her upset of Wang Qiang with a 7-5 6-7 (4) 7-6 (6) victory over Magda Linette that took more than three hours.\n\nOns Jabeur won two tie-breaks to see off sixth seed Yulia Putintseva and will face Swede Rebecca Peterson in the last four.", "description": "Coco Gauff claimed her first top-10 scalp to reach the semi-finals of the Upper Austria Ladies Linz.
