Robots are amongst the avant-garde technologies driving this development.'", "description": "Groups like\u00a0the Institute for Human & Machine Cognition have been plucking away at making a robot called the\u00a0Planar Elliptical Runner (PER) - a bipedal bot that relies mostly on mechanics.", "authors": ["James Pero For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/20/19803476-0-image-a-2_1571254298637.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
