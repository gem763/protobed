Scorers: Otamendi 20, Aguero 38, 56 SOUTHAMPTON (5-3-2): McCarthy; Valery, Danso, Stephens, Bednarek, Hojbjerg; Ward-Prowse, Armstrong, Romeu (Vokins 90+1); Long (Redmond 68), Boufal (Adams 69) Subs: Yoshida, Vestergaard, Ings, Gunn. Scorer: Stephens 75 Booked: Romeu Referee: Jon Moss\n\n\u2018A defeat but a reaction,\u2019 was Hasenhuttl\u2019s assessment.\n\n\u2018After a very very difficult night on Friday to come here and play against one of the strongest sides on the planet, I can think of an easier challenges.\n\n\u2018You can concede goals and then the mental net breaks and it\u2019s difficult for the players, so the goal was to keep the game open as long as possible.\u2019\n\nStill, Southampton are out of the Carabao Cup and it\u2019s fair to say they\u2019re not out of the woods yet either.\n\nThey must return to the Etihad on Saturday to face a stronger City side who will be even more determined to secure three Premier League points than they are to hold onto this trophy for the third year in a row.\n\nPep Guardiola\u2019s team have scored five goals or more on no fewer than 14 occasions since the start of last season \u2013 including a 9-0 win over Burton Albion here in the semi-finals of this competition.\n\nThey are more than capable of inflicting the same kind of pain as Southampton suffered at St Mary\u2019s on Friday, even though Guardiola made nine changes on Tuesday night.\n\nThe most notable saw Doyle handed his full first-team debut after impressing for the senior side on tour last summer.\n\nThe 18-year-old\u2019s pedigree could not be better. He is the grandson of former City favourites Mike Doyle \u2013 who lifted this trophy in 1976 \u2013 and Glyn Pardoe.\n\nDoyle is also the club\u2019s youth team skipper and played here with the confidence and composure of a captain in an unfamiliar defensive midfield role.\n\n\u2018Tommy played so well for a first game in a position that is not natural for him. Congratulations on his debut,\u2019 said Guardiola.\n\nAguero doubled the lead with a tidy goal on his 350th appearance for the club\n\nPep Guardiola's side delivered their usual slick football to pick Southampton apart\n\n\u2018I didn't have another alternative, honestly, but he was with us in pre-season and I saw him a few times in the academy. I didn't have any doubts he would play well.\u2019\n\nHasenhuttl made six changes of his own. He kept to the same 5-3-2 formation but it was one with damage limitation in mind.\n\nIndeed, the visitors had 23 per cent possession and hardly got out of their own half before City made a breakthrough in the 20th minute.\n\nSaints could have been more switched on as a short corner was played to Bernardo Silva, and he clipped a simple cross to the edge of the six-yard box where Nicolas Otamendi rose above Jan Bednarek to nod home.\n\nThe second goal arrived seven minutes before half-time and again the visitors were exposed all too easily.\n\nCity fans enjoyed seeing young Tommy Doyle get the start for the Carabao Cup champions\n\nAguero again showed his predatory instincts in the box to prod home City's third of the game\n\nPhil Foden congratulated the experienced striker as the Etihad crowd celebrated his effort\n\nCity worked the ball from left to right where Riyad Mahrez fed Kyle Walker on the overlap. His cross found Sergio Aguero unmarked in front of goal and the Argentine volleyed in with the inside of his right foot.\n\nSaints goalkeeper Alex McCarthy made a string of fine saves before Aguero touched the third goal past him after Mahrez\u2019s shot had been blocked by Bednarek.\n\nCredit to the visitors, they grew more adventurous and Jack Stephens headed in from a James Ward-Prowse corner in the 75th minute.\n\nSo City go through but for Southampton there is at least a degree of redemption and something to build on in three days\u2019 time.\n\nJack Stephens gave Saints some reward for their adventure in the second half", "description": "CHRIS WHEELER AT THE ETIHAD: On a night when the appearance of teenager Tommy Doyle gave a nod to Manchester City's past, Southampton were just happy to put a shameful chapter to bed.", "authors": ["Chris Wheeler For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/21/20348472-0-image-a-4_1572386244496.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
