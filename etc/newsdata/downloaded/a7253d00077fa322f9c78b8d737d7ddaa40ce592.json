We were being drained out of the system. We have detected that this is just how these matters are handled by lawyers representing the Sita,\u201d Ruiters said.\n\n\u201cThey created a whistle-blower policy while I was suspended. It was approved while I was suspended and I was charged under that policy,\u201d Kgatle said.\n\nBut, Ntutule Tshenye, Sita\u2019s acting CEO, said there were 11 charges against Ruiters and Kgatle relating to irregular procurement, dereliction of duty, doing private business using company resources and gross misconduct.\n\nTshenye said the Sita has, for the past three years, implemented a board mandated effort to root out corruption and maladministration.\n\n\u201cThe disciplinary hearings of Kgatle and Ruiters fell within the ambit of the priority work being done at this time. These broader efforts of the Sita cleanup ultimately led to more than 180 Sita employees being either dismissed, suspended or resigning.\n\n\u201cIt was a defining moment for Sita. But, as with any important and necessary changes, it was an extremely difficult time for the agency and staff,\u201d Tshenye said.\n\nCharges brought against Ruiters and Kgatle, he said, were part of Sita\u2019s work to heed government\u2019s call for a clean and improved public service.\n\n\u201cGovernment\u2019s call to all state-owned enterprises was clear: employees should not be doing business with the state and employees should be prudent in discharging their duties, especially when using tax-payer money and employees actions should be ethical.\n\n\u201cWe respect the dignity of our former employees and to be fair to your readers and the public, it should be acknowledged that in both Kgatle\u2019s and Ruiter\u2019s cases, the charges against them were not linked to alleged whistle-blowing,\u201d Tshenye said.\n\nIn his petition to the Zondo commission, seen by City Press, Ruiters lists an number of allegations relating to how certain managers working with some board members, circumvented procurement processes in appointing service providers.\n\nIn his submission, Ruiters claimed that renowned law firms and forensic investigators were also hired to allegedly purge whistle-blowers.\n\nCity Press has seen communication between Ruiters and the commission\u2019s acting secretary Peter Pedlar confirming receipt of his submission and indicating that it would be assessed.\n\nMbuyiselo Stemela, the commission\u2019s spokesperson, had not responded to questions at the time of writing.\n\nRuiters also submitted a similar complaint to Mkhwebane\u2019s office last year but it was rejected on the basis that he had to exhaust his disciplinary matter at the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) and the Labour Court.\n\nBut Kgatle\u2019s complaint to the Public Protector was accepted. In August last year her office wrote to the Sita board chairperson Zukile Nomvete indicating that an investigation into maladministration and procurement of service providers was underway.\n\nMkhwebane\u2019s office also requested specific documents relating to procurement of service providers.\n\nTshenye said the Sita has been cooperating with Mkhwebane\u2019s office since February last year.\n\nOupa Segalwe, acting spokesperson for Mkhwebane\u2019s office, said during an assessment process to determine jurisdiction and merit, it was discovered that Ruiters already had a pending case at the CCMA.\n\n\u201cHe was then advised to exhaust that process first. However, there was a part of his complaint which mirrored the issues that formed part of the complaint lodged anonymously.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, these issues are being dealt with under Kgatle\u2019s matter. The anonymous complainant lodged the complaint as part of a group of employees, including Ruiters,\u201d Segalwe said.\n\nHe said allegations of the failure by the Sita to implement a whistle-blowing policy and the alleged victimisation of those who allegedly blew the whistle on corruption were among matters that were being investigated.", "description": "Claims of irregular appointment of consultants and rampant corruption by executive managers have rocked the State Information Technology Agency (Sita).", "authors": ["Msindisi Fengu"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9349/251408f07bfe4c5b9642683984decbb7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
