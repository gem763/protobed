The company unveiled a pricey new Jet Ski-style watercraft called Orca at an event in Toronto Tuesday night that can last for up to two hours on a full charge.\n\nThe Orca has a top speed of 65 miles per hour, and has 134kW of power (about 180 horsepower) on offer, which sounds like it will make for a fun ride. The 23kWh battery can be charged on standard or level 2 (240V) outlets, or more quickly with a DC fast charger (from 0 to 80 percent in 20 minutes), provided owners can find one of those near enough to the water (or with enough space to fit a truck and trailer).\n\nTaiga Motors says it\u2019s gone to great lengths to build a battery back that not only can withstand the punishment of riding at up to 65 miles per hour on open water, but one that won\u2019t lose its overall capacity when stowed away for the winter. It also won\u2019t require owners to suffer through the time-consuming \u201cwinterization\u201d process, since there are fewer moving parts. All Orcas will come with a five-year, 20,000 kilometer (roughly 12,427 miles) warranty.\n\nGrid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Orca has a waterproof digital display between the handlebars, where riders can tap into what sounds like a fair bit of technology, like GPS maps, LTE, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth radios, information from embedded water temperature sensors, and feeds from onboard cameras and a sonar unit. And it wouldn\u2019t be a modern mobility machine without a companion smartphone app and the ability to accept over-the-air updates, both of which Taiga Motors promises will accompany the Orca.\n\nNone of this comes cheap, though, as Taiga Motors is targeting a whopping $24,000 for the Orca when it goes into production in 2020. (For reference, Kawasaki sells Jet Ski-branded watercraft that range between roughly $10,000 and $18,000.) Following in the footsteps of automotive startups like Tesla and NIO, Taiga Motors will also sell a more expensive \u201cfounders edition\u201d Orca for $28,000 that features unspecified \u201cexclusive design elements and high-performance packages.\u201d\n\nSome of that price comes from the fact that the Orca\u2019s body is made completely out of carbon fiber, which Taiga Motors likely had to employ to help keep the weight down. Even with carbon fiber, the Orca weighs in at 580 pounds \u2014 with nearly half (275 pounds) coming from the battery alone. Those who do buy an Orca will at least be able to customize pretty much everything about its appearance, from the watercraft\u2019s colors, to its finish, to the shade and texture of the deck mat.\n\nRelated The Nikola Wav is an electric watercraft with a 4K display and cruise control\n\nTaiga Motors isn\u2019t likely to find a huge audience for a $24,000 personal watercraft, and even if it did, manufacturing in high volume can be a huge drain on a small company\u2019s resources. So Taiga Motors says it will build just 400 standard Orcas, and including the founders edition, only 500 will be made in total. The startup says it\u2019s already planning next-generation electric watercraft that start at under $14,000, and claims it\u2019s developing both inboard and outboard electric motors.\n\nTaiga Motors isn\u2019t the only company wading into the electric personal watercraft space, but most others haven\u2019t yet left the concept phase. (In fact, the most high-profile one to appear before the Orca\u2019s announcement came earlier this year from electric truck startup Nikola Motor Company, which only showed off its concept after acquiring another startup in this space.)\n\nBut if Taiga Motors sticks to this ambitious timeline, it may be one of the first to pull off the idea \u2014 a fact the startup sounds very aware of. \u201cThis is the first step in Taiga\u2019s mission to accelerate mass market adoption of electric alternatives,\u201d the company writes in a press release. \u201cOwners of an Orca will proudly hold their place in history as having led the transition towards better watersports.\u201d", "description": "Montreal startup Taiga Motors has announced a 180-horsepower electric watercraft with a top speed of 65 miles per hour, a suite of high-tech features, and a jaw-dropping price tag.
