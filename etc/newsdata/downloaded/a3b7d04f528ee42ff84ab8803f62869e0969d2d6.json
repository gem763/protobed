Miah allegedly maintained a hotel in Tapachula, Mexico, where he housed and fed aliens and provided them with plane tickets to locations in northern Mexico where the aliens were met by other smugglers who transported them to the U.S. border.\"\n\nLast week Bangladeshi citizen Moktar Hoosain pleaded guilty to smuggling charges and plans to help illegal aliens cross the border. Hoosain and Miah were co-conspirators and worked together in Mexico.\n\n\u201cHuman smuggling rings endanger the security of the United States,\u201d Assistant Attorney General Brian Benczkowski said in a statement. \u201cThis arrest sends a strong message that the Department is dedicated to holding accountable those who conspire to subvert our nation\u2019s immigration laws for their own profit.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cSecuring our borders is a national security and law enforcement priority,\u201d Southern District of Texas U.S. Attorney Ryan Patrick added. \u201cOften, disparate organizations cooperate in an effort to exploit our border. The great investigative work by multiple agencies stopped this group and is able to bring foreign based defendants to justice.\u201d\n\nMiah was presented to a judge yesterday in the Southern District of Texas. He will be transferred to Laredo as his case moves forward.", "description": ".10/02/2019 12:20:06PM EST.", "authors": ["Katie Pavlich", "Cortney O'Brien", "Guy Benson", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/133/d63885bf-3c7a-4a9a-bcbd-ac2735c54d62.png"}
