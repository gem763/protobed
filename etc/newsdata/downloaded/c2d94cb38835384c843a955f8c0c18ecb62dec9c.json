USA TODAY\n\nThings were going well for No. 5 Oklahoma in the first half against West Virginia at Gaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium.\n\nThen the Sooner Schooner took a scary tumble.\n\nSooners quarterback and Heisman trophy front-runner Jalen Hurts dashed into the end zone for a two-yard score to make it 28-7, and the classic Oklahoma tradition proceeded as normal. Except the covered wagon, pulled by horses Boomer and Sooner, toppled over during a sharp turn near the 15-yard line, sending the two riders \u2014 a man and woman \u2014 to the ground.\n\nBoth of the occupants were up and walking after the incident and appeared unhurt. Boomer and Sooner also looked to be fine and were escorted off the field.\n\n\"We believe (the accident) was the result of weight distribution among riders in the rear of the wagon. Three individuals were evaluated at the stadium and released. All others reported that they were uninjured,\" the Oklahoma athletic department said in a statement. \"Upon initial evaluation, it also appears the ponies are uninjured. Medical staff responded immediately as did the expert horse handlers and veterinarian who staff all games. We are grateful that the injuries were not serious and for the staff members who responded so well.\"\n\nScary scene in Norman.\n\nSooner Schooner flips. pic.twitter.com/Y7tcTjaJ5f \u2014 Matt Schick (@ESPN_Schick) October 19, 2019\n\nThis is the second consecutive season there has been an incident on the Sooner Schooner. Last year, a member of the Ruf/Nek men's spirit squad nearly fell out of the back of the Sooner Schooner wagon during a touchdown celebration against Oklahoma State.\n\nIn the extended version of the video, Fox play-by-play man Gus Johnson offered a call of the spill. \"Watch her ability to roll,\" he said. \"When she hits the ground, nice roll.\"\n\nExtended version of the Oklahoma wagon crash.pic.twitter.com/rptvVWKMCu \u2014 Dov Kleiman (@NFL_DovKleiman) October 19, 2019\n\nThe Sooner Schooner is an official mascot of the sports teams at Oklahoma, as it's a scaled-down replica of the Studebaker Conestoga wagon used by settlers of the Oklahoma Territory around the time of the Land Run of 1889.\n\nContributing: Scott Gleeson", "description": "Things were going well for No. 5 Oklahoma against West Virginia.
