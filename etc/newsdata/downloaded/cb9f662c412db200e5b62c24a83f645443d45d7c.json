The uncertainty around Brexit is an ongoing challenge.\u201d\n\nIn the small towns and villages that rely heavily on seasonal tourism, the mood is even more gloomy on the ground.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeter O\u2019Sullivan, a butcher in the picturesque village of Sneem on the popular Ring of Kerry tourist route in Ireland\u2019s south-west, says the number of British visitors to the area has fallen by 50 per cent this year.\n\nHe's the third-generation to run the family business, which has won a string of awards for its black pudding and home-made sausages.\n\n\u201cWe've seen a big fall-off in 2019,\u201d Mr O\u2019Sullivan said. \u201cBrexit is not a good idea. Apart from affecting tourism, people see it as putting up a fence between our neighbour and our closest trading nation.\n\n\u201cFarming is a big part of this community and if you don\u2019t have an outlet for your produce you are going to be in trouble aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nThe village of Adare, 20 kilometres south of Limerick, is renowned for its quaint thatched cottages. Shopkeepers there are also complaining about a drop in tourist traffic.\n\n\u201cLast season we were taking \u20ac4000 or \u20ac5000 a day; this year we would be lucky to\n\nput through \u20ac1000,\u201d one shop assistant said. \u201cThe buses are coming in but there are 10 people in the buses rather than 30. Brexit is a disaster; it should never have happened.\u201d\n\nFor more on Josephine McKenna's tour through Ireland, see Sophisticated Traveller, out in the The Australian Financial Review on October 18.", "description": "As Boris Johnson goes for broke to seal a last-minute Brexit deal, Ireland is already counting the tourism cost of no deal - to the tune of about $620 million  year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.54%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_914%2C$y_397/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/da23d25079b548d9ada24ecf1653fffea192e44b", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
