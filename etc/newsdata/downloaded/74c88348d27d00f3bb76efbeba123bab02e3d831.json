However, a No Deal would, in the IMF's view, lead to a slump.\n\nThe UK's uptick for next year is largely based around Chancellor Sajid Javid's relatively generous spending review. But that hasn't wound its way through the Commons yet. Tricky for a minority administration.\n\nMuch of Gopinath's recipes for recovery are a form of self-help and one suspects she has Donald Trump partly in mind.\n\nUS-China, Iran and Turkey could be regarded as self-harming diplomacy. Even fierce critics cannot blame Trump for meltdown in Argentina. Growth in world trade of only 1 per cent cannot be wholly blamed on the White House.\n\nAs the World Economic Outlook report points out, manufacturing has been hollowed out partly as a result of a 3 per cent decline in car production in 2018.\n\nThat largely explains why Germany is close to the bottom of the G7 growth league with growth of 0.5 per cent this year \u2013 only Italy is worse.\n\nExtinction Rebellion may want carbon-emitting cars off the road. But its agenda means economic dislocation, fewer jobs and less prosperity.\n\nThe IMF thinks monetary policy may have run its course. That means countries with fiscal space \u2013 in Britain we have been calling it headroom \u2013 are encouraged to spend. Britain has limited space but Boris Johnson seems determined to end fixing the roof.\n\nGermany, which has all the headroom in the world, remains trapped by its historical baggage. Never again the burden of post-war debts (bravely forgiven by the Allies) or the inflation madness of the 1930s.\n\nBut persuading it to behave like Europe's locomotive is like asking Donald Trump to stop his incendiary geopolitical tweeting.\n\nReverse gear\n\nOne favourite cry of the people who support Remain is that it will crush foreign direct investment (FDI) in the UK.\n\nThe recent spate of private equity bids, including the offer for Sophos, points to something different.\n\nBut the really big change according to IMF analysis is Trump's tax reforms. In 2018 FDI came to a near-standstill.\n\nIn the period 2011-17, US multinationals, including the tech giants, stored $300billion a year in the accounts of overseas offshoots, many of them in low-tax destinations.\n\nIn 2018 they brought home $230billion, which is exactly what the White House wanted.\n\nQuite a victory for the tweeter-in-chief.\n\nVictory lap\n\nThe latest quarterly results from the US banks demonstrate how big a winner Jamie Dimon's JP Morgan has proved to be from the financial crisis.\n\nIts absorption of the retail banking assets of Washington Mutual turned it from a New York bank into a national institution.\n\nAnd its acquisition of Bear Stearns strengthened its Wall Street exposure.\n\nGoldman in contrast remains heavily dependent on bids and deals and taking stakes in firms. The bank suffered a 26 per cent decline in third-quarter earnings.\n\nIts effort to build retail operations from the ground up are a slow burner for Wall Street's provider of the good and the great to enter public service.", "description": "The IMF's new top economist, Gita Gopinath, is not happy about the global economy which is at its weakest in 2019 since the financial crisis and not forecast to do much better next year.", "authors": ["Alex Brummer For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
