Starring: Linda Hamilton, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Mackenzie Davis, Natalia Reyes, and Gabriel Luna. 15 cert, 128 mins.\n\nThe Terminator may be near-indestructible, but his movies certainly aren\u2019t. Ever since 2003\u2019s Rise of the Machines signalled the start of franchise\u2019s slow descent into calamity and despair, fans have been praying for salvation. Terminator: Dark Fate, yet another attempt at resuscitation, is perfectly fine. At times, it\u2019s even quite good. But its existence will feel like a small miracle to some \u2013 proof that the future of the Terminator movies isn\u2019t entirely apocalyptic. It\u2019s the saga's best sequel since Terminator 2: Judgment Day, however you might interpret that.\n\nThe film, directed by Deadpool\u2019s Tim Miller, takes what will inevitably be known as \u201cThe Force Awakens approach\u201d to sequels. It\u2019s a subtle reboot, attempting to soothe any bad vibes by running straight into the arms of the familiar. In fact, Dark Fate takes it one step further by flat-out denying the existence of its inferior sequels. It\u2019s a follow-up to Judgment Day and Judgment Day only \u2013 anything else has now been relegated to an \u201calternate timeline\u201d. You\u2019ll have heard the plot before: a Terminator (Gabriel Luna\u2019s Rev-9) has arrived from a future where machines have taken control, sent to annihilate a target (Natalia Reyes\u2019s Dani) whose existence threatens their dominion. Meanwhile, a member of the human rebellion (Mackenzie Davis\u2019s Grace, an augmented super-soldier) has also been sent back to try and stop the termination from taking place. Not only is Arnold Schwarzenegger back, but so is Linda Hamilton\u2019s Sarah Connor.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThere are references and callbacks galore \u2013 some welcome, some self-indulgent. Not one, but two major action sequences are set in an industrial warehouse (you know it\u2019s a Terminator film if someone\u2019s getting crushed in a big vice). The franchise has often struggled to land on a tone that balances the grittiness of its technophobic dystopia with the cutesy \u201cHasta la vista, baby\u201d catchphrases. But Dark Fate manages to get around this, at least in part, thanks to a healthy dose of self-awareness. Though there\u2019s a whiff of contractual obligation to Arnold Schwarzenegger\u2019s role, the film\u2019s screenwriting team \u2013 David S Goyer, Justin Rhodes, and Billy Ray \u2013 are playful and ironic when it comes to the character\u2019s legacy. It\u2019s genuinely funny, for once.\n\nDoes it have anything genuinely new to offer? Sort of, but not really. The stunt choreography is intermittently inventive and Davis fights like there\u2019s a fire burning inside of her. But the film too often slides into a CGI blur \u2013 with zero sense of who\u2019s where and what\u2019s going on \u2013 and is thematically scattershot. We see much of the film through Dani\u2019s eyes, as a young woman living in Mexico, working in a factory whose employees are slowly being replaced by robots. It\u2019s a welcome (and much-needed) change of perspective, certainly, but the film\u2019s attempts to work in a commentary on immigration feel half-baked. A sequence set at the US border control isn't nearly as scathing as it needs to be, beyond one guard\u2019s insistence that the people being kept in cages are to be called \u201cdetainees\u201d and not \u201cprisoners\u201d.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. 37 sequels that are even better than the original Show all 37 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch. 37 sequels that are even better than the original 1/37 Aliens (1986) Ridley Scott's Alien may be an acclaimed horror film, but sequel Aliens \u2013 directed by James Cameron \u2013 is a stone cold action classic. Gone is the ignorant Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) of the original in favour of a hardened badass who returns to the moon, accompanied by a group of space marines, to take on the alien queen. How many years between sequel and original? Seven 20th Century Fox 2/37 Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999) It wasn't until the arrival of Austin Powers sequel The Spy Who Shagged Me that Mike Myers's comic creations were fully wedged into the hearts of film lovers. If the original was the perfect introduction to Austin's groovy world, the follow-up was an altogether funnier, bigger and more quotable affair. How many years between sequel and original? Two New Line Cinema 3/37 Avengers: Endgame (2019) Capping off not only your own franchise but a decade-long series consisting of 22 films is no mean feat \u2013 and yet Avengers: Endgame balanced all the playing pieces to do so with gargantuan success. How many years between sequel and original? Seven Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures 4/37 Back to the Future Part II (1989) The first sequel to Robert Zemeckis's Back to the Future is an amusing adventure that sees Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) travel... well, back to the future, to prevent his own son from sabotaging the family legacy. How many years between sequel and original? Four Universal Pictures 5/37 Batman Returns (1992) It was the addition of both Michelle Pfeiffer and Danny DeVito \u2013 as Catwoman and the Penguin, respectively \u2013 that made Tim Burton's sequel Batman Returns an even more memorable watch than the original. How many years between sequel and original? Three Warner Bros 6/37 Before Sunset (2004) Each instalment of Richard Linklater's Before trilogy is as good as the last. But, if there is a peak, it surely arrives with number two \u2013 Before Sunset \u2013 which reunites would-be lovers Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) nine years after they first met in Before Sunrise (1995). How many years between sequel and original? Nine Warner Independent Pictures 7/37 The Bourne Ultimatum (2007) There's a blistering chase sequence midway through The Bourne Ultimatum involving Matt Damon's amnesiac spy and journalist Simon Ross (Paddy Considine). It's adeptly directed by Paul Greengrass \u2013 here at the top of his game \u2013 and is all the proof you need that the original trilogy improved with each new film. How many years between sequel and original? Five Universal Pictures 8/37 Bride of Frankenstein (1935) Depicting Mary Shelley's classic creature as a pleasant guy just looking for a companion, Bride of Frankenstein is one of the greatest monster movies, let alone sequels, in cinema history. How many years between sequel and original? Four Universal Pictures 9/37 The Dark Knight (2008) Batman Begins may have been the perfect origin story for the caped crusader, but nothing could have prepared film fans for the classic its sequel would become. Christopher Nolan intelligently crafted The Dark Knight into one of the greatest follow-ups ever made, with several standout action sequences and an untouchable performance from Heath Ledger as the Joker. One for the ages. How many years between sequel and original? Three Warner Bros 10/37 Dawn of the Dead (1978) George A Romero ditched the entire cast of Night of the Living Dead for its first sequel, Dawn of the Dead, which showed the effects of the zombie apocalypse on a much larger scale than depicted in the black-and-white original. One of the most entertaining horror films ever made. How many years between sequel and original? 10 United Film Distribution Company 11/37 Hellboy II: The Golden Army (2008) The glory you feel watching Hellboy II: The Golden Army comes from the knowledge that you're watching a studio allow Guillermo del Toro to do whatever the hell he wants. A scintillating oddity of a follow-up that surpasses the 2004 original within minutes. How many years between sequel and original? Four Universal Pictures 12/37 Evil Dead II (1987) Not so much an improvement on the first as one that rips up its rule book completely: Sam Raimi took the character of Ash (Bruce Campbell), who viewers first met in influential 1981 horror The Evil Dead, and placed him in the heart of what is essentially a slapstick comedy. How many years between sequel and original? Six De Laurentiis Entertainment Group 13/37 Fast & Furious 5 (2011) After the lacklustre fourth instalment, Fast & Furious 5 was the reinvention the series desperately needed. Bringing in Dwayne Johnson as the bad guy was a genius stroke and the final set-piece \u2013 a car dragging a bank vault through the streets of Rio \u2013 remains as entertaining as anything the long-running series has ever done. How many years between sequel and original? 10 Universal Pictures 14/37 The Godfather Part II (1974) The Godfather Part II set the highest benchmark for what sequels should be, but so rarely are \u2013 a crucial chapter in a saga. The film won Robert De Niro an Oscar for his efforts, playing the same role Marlon Brando won an Oscar for two years before. This, alongside another film on this list, is one of two sequels to ever win Best Picture (keep scrolling to find out the other one). How many years between sequel and original? Two Paramount Pictures 15/37 The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966) The fact that Sergio Leone had barely any money to make The Good, the Bad and the Ugly \u2013 the third film in his \"Man With no Name\" trilogy \u2013 fortuitously led to the casting of the relatively unknown Clint Eastwood. Leone's film, beautifully soundtracked by Ennio Morricone, is a masterwork that proves less is more: its most classic dialogue-free scenes derived from the fact that Leone had no time to shoot dialogue. How many years between sequel and original? Two Produzioni Europee Associate 16/37 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004) Gone was the warm glow of Hogwarts in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n's adaptation of the JK Rowling novel proved the franchise could win widespread acclaim, as well as ticket receipts, if put in the hands of interesting directors. How many years between sequel and original? Three Warner Bros 17/37 How to Train Your Dragon 2 (2014) Could How to Train Your Dragon endure as one of the most beloved yet underrated franchises of all time? Quite possibly \u2013 and its first sequel, which features breathless flight sequences and animation to marvel at, is solid evidence of this. How many years between sequel and original? Four Universal Pictures 18/37 The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013) Despite essentially rehashing the plot of the first film, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is a bolder, more exciting and, yes, deadlier outing for Jennifer Lawrence's heroine Katniss Everdeen. How many years between sequel and original? One Lionsgate 19/37 Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989) If Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade isn't better than series opener Raiders of the Lost Ark, it's certainly as good. This is thanks to the addition of Sean Connery's Henry Jones Sr \u2013 the father of Harrison Ford's whip-cracking archaeologist. How many years between sequel and original? Eight Paramount Pictures 20/37 Iron Man 3 (2013) Perhaps it was down to relief that Iron Man 3 was so revered by critics (lest we forget Iron Man 2 is one of Marvel's biggest duds). But, Robert Downey Jr's third solo outing as Tony Starl boasts enough laughs and thrills, not to mention a doozy of a twist, that earns its placement on this list. How many years between sequel and original? Five Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures 21/37 Lethal Weapon 2 (1989) Lethal Weapon 2 takes what made the original so fun \u2013 the wit and twist-filled action \u2013 and amps it up as far as it can possibly go. That it throws in Joe Pesci for good measure just makes the results even more sizzling. How many years between sequel and original? Two Warner Bros 22/37 Logan (2017) Logan rectified the mistakes of Wolverine's earlier standalone films thanks to James Mangold's decision to place the character in a far grittier film than he was used to (it was rated 15 in the UK). The result remains a perfect send-off to one of X-Men's greatest characters, who first played the role in 2000. How many years between sequel and original? 17 20th Century Fox 23/37 The Raid 2 Gareth Evans's sequel to The Raid is more of the glorious same, only \u2013 somehow \u2013 more ambitious. Two hours and 30 minutes of breathlessly-paced fight sequences that's unlike anything caught on film before. How many years between sequel and original? Three Sony Pictures Classics 24/37 The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003) The second sequel to ever win Best Picture is all about the payoff. While each film in Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy delivers in what it needs to, this final chapter balances all the plates to dish out an epic conclusion that surely would have been everything JRR Tolkien wanted from an adaptation of his classic novels. How many years between sequel and original? Two New Line Cinema 25/37 Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) Nobody could have predicted quite how breathlessly entertaining Mad Max: Fury Road would be. George Miller's dystopian chase film refuses to relent from the very first second and is just as entertaining with every watch \u2013 and far superior to the Mel Gibson original, which was released in 1979. How many years between sequel and original? 36 Warner Bros Pictures 26/37 Mission: Impossible \u2013 Fallout (2018) There has never been a bad Mission: Impossible film. However, since Christopher McQuarrie stepped into the fold as director, the series has taken just as many audacious leaps as its lead star, the stunt-loving Tom Cruise. Fallout is a multi-layered, twisty action film that will undoubtedly go down as a franchise classic. How many years between sequel and original? 22 Paramount Pictures 27/37 National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (1989) All it took was the spirit of Christmas for the Griswolds to get the film they deserved. Chevy Chase heads up this one liner-filled festive treat that's probably the only Vacation film worth your time. How many years between sequel and original? Four 28/37 Paddington 2 (2017) One critic described Paddington 2 as \"the Godfather Part II of Peruvian Bear movies\" and they were not wrong. The sequel somehow manages to convey more charm than the original \u2013 which in itself is extremely charming \u2013 and has the benefit of starring Hugh Grant as a villainous actor named Phoenix Buchanan. A delight. How many years between sequel and original? Three StudioCanal 29/37 Shrek 2 (2004) All eyes were on Shrek 2 thanks to the unprecedented success of the fantastic original, which was released in 2001. What people didn't expect, though, was that the follow-up would be just as hilarious and even more enchanting. How many years between sequel and original? Three DreamWorks Pictures 30/37 Spider-Man 2 (2004) Sam Raimi managed to outdo himself with Spider-Man 2 (the first one remains a superhero standout) with help from Alfred Molina's Doctor Octopus and some nightmarish scenes in which the Evil Dead filmmaker delves into his bursting bag of horror movie tricks. How many years between sequel and original? Two Sony Pictures Releasing 31/37 Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan (1982) By placing the emphasis on character as opposed to action, Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan righted the wrongs of the classic TV show's first big screen adventure, a dud that was released in 1979. The result is a staggeringly improved follow-up. How many years between sequel and original? thREE Paramount Pictures 32/37 Star Wars: Episode V \u2013 The Empire Strikes Back (1980) The Empire Strikes Back would make this list for its twist alone, which ranks as one of the greatest in cinema history, but the film also represents so much more. Episode V established the Star Wars franchise's staying power by proving A New Hope was no fluke. How many years between sequel and original? Three 20th Century Fox 33/37 War for the Planet of the Apes (2017) With War for the Planet of the Apes, Fox's closing chapter of the rebooted trilogy, Matt Reeves delivered a near-faultless arthouse film parading as a mo-cap monkey-filled blockbuster. How many years between sequel and original? Six 20th Century Fox 34/37 10 Cloverfield Lane (2016) It would have been easy to chalk up 10 Cloverfield Lane's acclaim to the fact it was a \"secret\" up until a month before it was released. The fact remains, though, that this \"spiritual successor\" to 2008 found-footage thriller Cloverfield is a gruellingly tense chamber piece that's even more nail-biting than the first. How many years between sequel and original? Eight Paramount Pictures 35/37 Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991) Those who believed you couldn't get a more groundbreaking film than The Terminator likely burst a vessel after watching Judgement Day, a sequel that reshaped what people wanted from their action movies forevermore. It did so while subverting expectation in the most simplest of ways \u2013 by turning Arnie's killing machine, the terrifying villain in the first, into a cuddly force for good. How many years between sequel and original? Seven TriStar Pictures 36/37 Thor: Ragnarok (2017) When Taika Waititi took the keys to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, he walked away with one of its greatest films: Thor: Ragnarok. The finished product is Asgards apart from the first of the hero's two adventures, starring Chris Hemsworth, that were released in 2011 and 2013. How many years between sequel and original? Six Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures 37/37 Toy Story 2 (1999) Sure, the third and fourth instalments might have the emotional payoffs, but \u2013 thanks to a series of standout scenes (the traffic cone pileup, anyone?) \u2013 it's Toy Story 2 that stands tall as the best of Pixar's sequels. How many years between sequel and original? Four Buena Vista Pictures 1/37 Aliens (1986) Ridley Scott's Alien may be an acclaimed horror film, but sequel Aliens \u2013 directed by James Cameron \u2013 is a stone cold action classic.

Eight Paramount Pictures 35/37 Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991) Those who believed you couldn't get a more groundbreaking film than The Terminator likely burst a vessel after watching Judgement Day, a sequel that reshaped what people wanted from their action movies forevermore. It did so while subverting expectation in the most simplest of ways \u2013 by turning Arnie's killing machine, the terrifying villain in the first, into a cuddly force for good. How many years between sequel and original? Seven TriStar Pictures 36/37 Thor: Ragnarok (2017) When Taika Waititi took the keys to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, he walked away with one of its greatest films: Thor: Ragnarok. The finished product is Asgards apart from the first of the hero's two adventures, starring Chris Hemsworth, that were released in 2011 and 2013. How many years between sequel and original? Six Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures 37/37 Toy Story 2 (1999) Sure, the third and fourth instalments might have the emotional payoffs, but \u2013 thanks to a series of standout scenes (the traffic cone pileup, anyone?) \u2013 it's Toy Story 2 that stands tall as the best of Pixar's sequels. How many years between sequel and original? Four Buena Vista Pictures\n\nIn the end, it\u2019s the film\u2019s three female leads that come to the rescue. Given how depressingly rare it is to see women even talking to each other in an action movie, I suppose Terminator: Dark Fate should be commended for this \u2013 even if there's a jarring lack of women behind the scenes. And Hamilton, Reyes, and Davis do bounce off each other beautifully, representing three very different pillars of female strength. Hamilton\u2019s Sarah is still all grit and nerve. (When asked about grief, she snaps back: \u201cYou just have to learn to live with it\u201d.) Reyes brings sincerity to Dani, becoming the everywoman we can believe in. Davis is the conflicted soldier: tough on the outside, brittle on the inside. Thanks to them, if Terminator: Dark Fate does end up being the franchise\u2019s last breath, it will have at least have died with some dignity.\n\nTerminator: Dark Fate is out in UK cinemas now", "description": "Dir: Tim Miller.
