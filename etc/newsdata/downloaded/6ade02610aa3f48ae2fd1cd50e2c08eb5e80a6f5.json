Reports Third Quarter 2019 Results", "language": "en", "text": "Focused inventory reduction and strong product support revenues help offset macro headwinds\n\nCALGARY, Alberta \u2014 Rocky Mountain Dealerships Inc. (TSX:RME, and hereinafter \u201cRME\u201d), Canada\u2019s largest agriculture equipment dealer, today reported its financial results for the three months ended September 30, 2019. Unless otherwise stated, all amounts are expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars.\n\n\u201cRME demonstrated our resiliency during the third quarter of 2019 in response to unusual and in our view temporary market conditions affecting our industry and created by macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. We reduced inventories by approximately $62 million from second quarter 2019 levels, the second largest inventory decrease in our history. Our focus was on reducing inventories and strengthening the balance sheet, which defensively positions RME against an uncertain macroeconomic outlook. We continued to make positive progress on the higher margin, product support side of the business, with an increase in revenues of $2.3 million (4.8%) year-over-year,\u201d stated Garrett Ganden, President and Chief Executive Officer.\n\n\u201cOur team responded admirably in a highly competitive and uncertain industry environment by getting deals done, moving equipment and generating cash while also maintaining our position in the market.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was little change in the political and macroeconomic uncertainty which has persisted throughout the year and continues to weigh on industry sales1. Deliveries of new agriculture units in the Canadian marketplace continued to decline in the third quarter, which are now approaching levels not seen since 2004. Despite these challenging industry conditions, RME\u2019s established network of professionals and dealerships stand ready to deliver superior customer service and quality products with a target to deliver long-term value for our shareholders.\u201d\n\nSUMMARY OF THE QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019\n\nTotal equipment inventory decreased $55,953 (10.0%) to $504,327 compared to $560,280 in the second quarter of 2019 \u2013 the second largest equipment inventory decrease in RME\u2019s history. Total equipment inventory increased $38,498 (8.3%) compared to the same period in 2018;\n\nGross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to 15.0% compared to 15.5% for the same period in 2018;\n\nProduct support revenues increased by $2,270 (4.8%) to $49,504 compared with $47,234 in the same period of 2018;\n\nOperating SG&A decreased $1,897 (9.1%) to $18,860 compared with $20,757 for the same period in 2018. As a percentage of sales, operating SG&A increased to 10.2% compared with 8.9% for the same period in 2018;\n\nSales decreased $49,307 (21.1%) to $184,067 compared with $233,374 for the same period in 2018 due primarily to declines in new and used same store equipment sales of $31,271 and $21,467 respectively, reflecting weaker 2019 demand and a considerable delay in harvest progress across the Canadian prairies; and\n\nMaintained reasonable balance sheet strength \u2013 with net debt of $62,416 and net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.45x.\n\nSELECTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION\n\nThree Months Ended September 30, $ thousands 2019 2018 Change % Sales 184,067 233,374 (49,307) (21.1) Cost of sales 156,420 197,139 (40,719) (20.7) Gross profit 27,647 36,235 (8,588) (23.7) Gross profit as a % of sales 15.0 15.5 (0.5) Selling, general and administrative 22,365 24,255 (1,890) (7.8) Loss on derivative financial instruments 426 511 (85) (16.6) Earnings before finance costs and income taxes 4,856 11,469 (6,613) (57.7) Finance costs 4,953 3,885 1,068 27.5 (Loss) earnings before income taxes (97) 7,584 (7,681) (101.3) Income taxes 19 2,070 (2,051) (99.1) Net (loss) earnings (116) 5,514 (5,630) (102.1) Net (loss) earnings as a % of sales (0.1) 2.4 (2.5) (Loss) earnings per share Basic (0.01) 0.28 (0.29) (103.6) Diluted (0.01) 0.28 (0.29) (103.6) Dividends per share 0.1225 0.1225 \u2014 \u2014 Book value / share \u2013 September 30 9.80 10.24 (0.44) (4.3) Non-IFRS Measures(1) Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share 0.00 0.29 (0.29) (100.0) Adjusted EBITDA 4,475 12,211 (7,736) (63.4) Operating SG&A 18,860 20,757 (1,897) (9.1) Operating SG&A as a % of sales 10.2 8.9 1.3 Operating Cash Flow before Changes in Floor Plan 68,341 48,376 19,965 41.3\n\n(1) See further discussion in \u201cNon-IFRS Measures\u201d and \u201cReconciliation of Non-IFRS Measures to IFRS\u201d sections below.\n\nSUMMARY OF RESULTS FOR THE QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019\n\nUnresolved trade disputes surrounding Canadian agriculture commodities continued to weigh on crop prices and farmer sentiment during the third quarter of 2019. Meanwhile, snowfall in several regions and heavy rain in others stalled 2019 harvest activity, with all three Canadian Prairie Provinces reporting significant delays in harvest progress as of the end of the third quarter of 2019. These conditions continue to temper customer demand for equipment. Nonetheless, RME achieved an encouraging 10.1% or $61,654 reduction in overall inventory levels during the third quarter of 2019, while growing both parts and service revenues.\n\nSALES AND MARGINS\n\nSales decreased 21.1% or $49,307 to $184,067 compared with $233,374 for the same period in 2018 due primarily to declines in new and used same store equipment sales of $31,271 and $21,467, respectively. These declines reflect weaker 2019 demand and a considerable delay in harvest progress across the Canadian Prairies.\n\nGross margin percentage decreased by 0.5% to 15.0% from 15.5% in the same period in 2018 as a result of lower realized pricing on used agriculture equipment sales combined with a reduction in manufacturer incentives.\n\nGross profit dollars decreased by 23.7% or $8,588 to $27,647 from $36,235 for the same period in 2018.\n\nCOST STRUCTURE\n\nAs a percentage of sales, Operating SG&A for the third quarter of 2019 increased by 1.3% to 10.2% compared with 8.9% for the same period in 2018, as the decline in sales outpaced the reduction in Operating SG&A.\n\nFinance costs for the quarter ended September 30, 2019 increased 27.5% or $1,068 to $4,953 compared with $3,885 during the same period in 2018 due to an increase in the average level of interest-bearing floor plan payable.\n\nEARNINGS\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for the quarter ended September 30, 2019 decreased by 63.4% or $7,736 to $4,475 compared with $12,211 for the same period in 2018.\n\nAdjusted Diluted Earnings per Share decreased by $0.29 to $0.00 for the third quarter of 2019, compared with $0.29 for the same period of 2018.\n\nBALANCE SHEET AND INVENTORY\n\nInventory turns over the trailing twelve-months ended September 30, 2019 were 1.26 times, down from 1.73 times for fiscal 2018, reflecting the aforementioned decline in sales activity in combination with an increase in the average level of inventory on hand.\n\nMARKET FUNDAMENTALS AND OUTLOOK\n\nRME is primarily engaged in the business of selling agriculture equipment to grain, oilseed and pulse crop farmers in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba.\n\nIn addition to equipment price, demand for agriculture equipment is supported by farming incomes which, in turn, are a function of commodity prices, quantity and quality of the crop, as well as input costs. Many of these factors are influenced by weather conditions on both a local and, to an extent, global basis. Changes in these demand drivers can cause our customers\u2019 buying patterns to shift. The agriculture sector exhibits cyclical surges in demand and profitability driven by these macroeconomic factors, as well as other factors that can impact our industry.\n\nEquipment utilization rates, by contrast, are less volatile as agricultural equipment tends to incur hours in the field regardless of weather or economic conditions. The business of farming requires producers to work their fields each year. Circumstances may exist, however, that cause farmers to opt for used equipment in lieu of new equipment, or they may elect to maintain rather than replace their fleets. Our broad range of product and service offerings enables us to respond to these shifts in buying patterns and provides a measure of stability within our financial results.\n\nTRADE DISPUTES\n\nTrade barriers between Canada and several of its agriculture commodity trading partners continue to impede farmers\u2019 ability to deliver their crops to key end markets. China, with its ban on Canadian canola, joins India, Saudi Arabia and others in implementing trade barriers affecting Canadian agriculture products including canola, wheat and lentils. The severity of these disputes continues to weigh on agriculture commodity prices and overall farmer sentiment which, in turn, tempers demand for RME\u2019s product and service offerings. In its September 2019 Ag Tractor and Combine Report for Canada, the Association of Equipment Manufacturers reported year-to-date sales declines in major product categories including 4WD tractors (down 33%) and self-propelled combines (down 28%), a manifestation of this downturn in sentiment.\n\nCROP OUTLOOK\n\nLate-September brought snowfall in several regions and heavy rain in others, stalling the 2019 harvest. All three Canadian Prairie Provinces reported significant delays in harvest completion with Alberta 34% complete (5-year average of 54%)2, Saskatchewan 47% complete (5-year average of 75%)3 and Manitoba 67% complete (3-year average of 76%)4.\n\nWhile these weather conditions are expected to negatively impact both grade and yield, the precipitation has helped replenish topsoil moisture levels.\n\nIn its Outlook for Principal Field Crops dated October 18, 2019, Agriculture and Agri-Foods Canada estimates seeded area to be relatively comparable to last year with higher yields boosting overall production of principal field crops in 2019 over 2018 levels. However, with a considerable amount of the crop still in the fields, the impact of recent weather conditions on area harvested and grade is uncertain.\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (\u201cMD&A\u201d)\n\nThe MD&A as well as the unaudited financial statements and notes to the financial statements for the quarters ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, are available online at www.rockymtn.com and www.sedar.com.\n\nNON-IFRS MEASURES\n\nWe use terms which do not have standardized meanings under IFRS. As these non-IFRS financial measures do not have standardized meanings prescribed by IFRS, they are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Our definition for each term is as follows:\n\n\u201cAdjusted Diluted Earnings per Share\u201d calculated by eliminating from net (loss) earnings, the after-tax impact of the losses (gains) arising from RME\u2019s derivative financial instruments and DSUs, as well as the expense (recovery) associated with its SARs. These items arise primarily from changes in RME\u2019s share price as well as fluctuations in interest rates and are not reflective of RME\u2019s core operations. RME also adjusts for any non-recurring charges (recoveries) recognized in net (loss) earnings. Management deems nonrecurring charges (recoveries) to be unusual or infrequent items that RME incurs outside of its common day-to-day operations. Adjusting for these items allows management to isolate and analyze diluted earnings per share from core business operations. For the periods presented, costs associated with the acquisition and integration of complementary businesses have been classified as non-recurring charges.\n\n\u201cAdjusted EBITDA\u201d is derived by eliminating the following items from net (loss) earnings: finance costs associated with long-term debt; income taxes; depreciation and amortization; the impact of the losses (gains) arising from derivative financial instruments and DSUs; and the expense (recovery) associated with SARs. Adjusting net (loss) earnings for these items allows management to consistently compare periods by removing the impact of fluctuations in tax rates, long-term assets, financing costs related to RME\u2019s capital structure and RME\u2019s share price. RME also adjusts for any non-recurring charges (recoveries) recognized in Adjusted EBITDA. Management deems nonrecurring charges (recoveries) to be unusual or infrequent items that RME incurs outside of its common day-to-day operations. Adjusting for these items allows management to isolate and analyze EBITDA from core business operations. For the periods presented, costs associated with the acquisition and integration of complementary businesses have been classified as non-recurring charges.\n\n\u201cOperating SG&A\u201d is calculated by eliminating from SG&A, depreciation and amortization expense as well as the impact of the gains arising from RME\u2019s DSUs and the expense (recovery) associated with its SARs. These items arise primarily from changes in RME\u2019s share price and are not reflective of RME\u2019s core operations. RME also adjusts for any non-recurring charges (recoveries) recognized in SG&A. Management deems non-recurring charges (recoveries) to be unusual or infrequent items that RME incurs outside of its common day-to-day operations. For the periods presented, costs associated with the acquisition and integration of complementary businesses have been classified as non-recurring charges. The assessment of Operating SG&A facilitates the evaluation of discretionary expenses from ongoing operations.\n\n\u201cOperating Cash Flow before Changes in Floor Plan\u201d is calculated by eliminating the impact of the change in floor plan payable (excluding floor plan assumed pursuant to business combinations and the non-cash impact of changes in floor plan arising from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on U.S. denominated floor plan facilities) from cash flows from operating activities. Adjusting cash flows from operating activities for changes in the balance of floor plan payable allows management to isolate and analyze operating cash flows during a period, prior to any sources or uses of cash associated with equipment financing decisions.\n\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-IFRS MEASURES TO IFRS\n\nADJUSTED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE\n\nThree Months Ended September 30, $ thousands 2019 2018 (Loss) earnings used in the calculation of diluted (loss)\n\nearnings per share (116) 5,514 Loss on derivative financial instruments 426 511 Gain on DSUs (139) (63) SAR recovery \u2014 (343) Acquisition and integration costs \u2014 236 Tax effect of adjustments 26.5% (2018 \u2013 27%) (76) (92) Earnings used in the calculation of Adjusted\n\nDiluted Earnings per Share 95 5,763 Weighted average diluted shares used in the\n\ncalculation of diluted (loss) earnings per share (in thousands) 19,257 19,888 Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share 0.00 0.29\n\nADJUSTED EBITDA\n\nThree Months Ended September 30, $ thousands 2019 2018 Net (loss) earnings (116) 5,514 Finance costs associated with long-term debt 641 618 Depreciation and amortization expense 3,644 3,668 Income taxes 19 2,070 EBITDA 4,188 11,870 Loss on derivative financial instruments 426 511 Gain on DSUs (139) (63) SAR recovery \u2014 (343) Acquisition and integration costs \u2014 236 Adjusted EBITDA 4,475 12,211\n\nOPERATING SG&A\n\nThree Months Ended September 30, $ thousands 2019 2018 SG&A 22,365 24,255 Depreciation and amortization expense (3,644) (3,668) Gain on DSUs 139 63 SAR recovery \u2014 343 Acquisition and integration costs \u2014 (236) Operating SG&A 18,860 20,757 Operating SG&A as a % of sales 10.2 8.9\n\nOPERATING CASH FLOW BEFORE CHANGES IN FLOOR PLAN\n\nThree Months Ended September 30, $ thousands 2019 2018 Cash flow from operating activities 10,387 16,903 Net increase in floor plan payable 57,816 9,706 Change in floor plan arising from changes in foreign exchange rates 138 \u2014 Floor plan assumed pursuant to business combinations \u2014 21,767 Operating Cash Flow before Changes in Floor Plan 68,341 48,376\n\nCONFERENCE CALL\n\nRME will host a conference call and webcast to discuss the quarter at 9:00 a.m. MT (11:00 a.m. ET) today.
