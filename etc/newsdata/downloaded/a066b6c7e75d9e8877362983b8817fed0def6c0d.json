To do business in China, the company adopts to local dictates, distasteful as they may be to its CEO Tim Cook, an outspoken gay rights advocate and privacy crusader. It\u2019s an ironic inversion of a longstanding argument in the West that by bringing China into the world trade system, the country would adopt western values. Instead, China is asking tech companies to adopt its values \u2014 and Apple is willing to pay that price.\n\nIn early 2018 as development on Apple\u2019s slate of exclusive Apple TV+ programming was underway, the company\u2019s leadership gave guidance to the creators of some of those shows to avoid portraying China in a poor light, BuzzFeed News has learned. Sources in position to know said the instruction was communicated by Eddy Cue, Apple\u2019s SVP of internet software and services, and Morgan Wandell, its head of international content development. It was part of Apple\u2019s ongoing efforts to remain in China\u2019s good graces after a 2016 incident in which Beijing shut down Apple\u2019s iBooks Store and iTunes Movies six months after they debuted in the country.", "description": "", "authors": ["Buzzfeednews.Com Article Alexkantrowitz Apple-China-Tv-Protesters-Hong-Kong-Tim-Cook"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
