So why are we so lonely? | Harry Readhead", "language": "en", "text": "It might seem vaguely ludicrous that the generation that grew up in the \u201csocial\u201d world, graduating from Bebo and MySpace to Facebook and Instagram, has trouble with loneliness. But among millennials, it\u2019s incredibly common. One YouGov poll found that nearly a quarter of all millennials could not name a single friend. The same survey showed that close to a third of this generation \u2013 my generation \u2013 \u201calways\u201d or \u201coften\u201d feel lonely.\n\nPerfectionism is destroying the mental health of my millennial generation | Daisy Buchanan Read more\n\nLoneliness is hard to address because it can be symptomatic of other forms of emotional turmoil \u2013 depression, for instance. Although feeling lonely is not a mental illness in its own right, the two are often strongly linked, and it is often a complex response to perceived isolation or lack of social connection. The fact that it is invisible \u2013 and that there is still considerable stigma attached to it \u2013 compounds the problem.\n\nIt perhaps makes sense that loneliness is especially taboo among those whose friendships ostensibly number in the thousands. But this is part of the problem: in fact, the connection between loneliness and social media is well established. For all their virtues, we know that social media platforms exploit the psychology of the user to keep that user glued to the screen. Having grown up with (and to at least some extent been shaped by) social media, millennials have been especially vulnerable to its worst psychological effects, such as creating an illusory impression of connection and the sense that everyone else is living an impossibly rich, varied and active life. And this, unsurprisingly, can translate to a feeling of loneliness in the real world.\n\nGPs should consider 'prescribing' millennials social activities to tackle these feelings of isolation\n\nOf course, millennials don\u2019t have the monopoly on social isolation; older people are also increasingly feeling lonely. I\u2019m fortunate: I have many close relationships, a family and a job. But when seemingly happy friends started telling me they were lonely and lost, I signed up to be a volunteer counsellor with Shout, a 24/7 text service for people in crisis.\n\nBut much more needs to be done with millennials specifically in mind. In addition to more counselling, GPs should consider \u201cprescribing\u201d millennials social activities to tackle these feelings of isolation. Book clubs, sports teams and meet-ups can all help young people build face-to-face relationships, as well as digital ones they already have on social media.\n\nDespite what you might read, millennials are generally resourceful, passionate, imaginative people. We are entirely capable of facing up to the challenges of the coming years. But we also need to recognise the limits of social media in providing genuine relationships and preventing loneliness. Technology has transformed our lives and mostly for the better, but it is not a panacea \u2013 and we need to recognise that.\n\n\u2022 Harry Readhead is a freelance journalist, ghostwriter and book critic", "description": "Social media has stoked a loneliness epidemic among my generation that needs to be addressed, says Harry Readhead", "authors": ["Harry Readhead"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75f2f151551a6bfcb3a60ffdf44c9f6eadc4521d/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=621b852fc241932e22628eb1dab8ed0b", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
