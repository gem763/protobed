Read all about it! Coldplay found the most extra way to reveal the track list for their upcoming double album (also extra, for the record) and, no, it\u2019s not just an elaborate Instagram post. The band placed a classified ad with the title, track list, and release date in newspapers across the globe. Papers in Australia, France, New Zealand, Malaysia, and the United Kingdom showed the ad, some retaining Coldplay\u2019s format and others replacing it with their own. The new project, titled Everyday Life, is actually two albums in one: Sunrise and Sunset. According to their ads, Sunrise will feature songs \u201cSunrise,\u201d \u201cChurch,\u201d \u201cTrouble In Town,\u201d \u201cBrokEn,\u201d \u201cDaddy,\u201d \u201cWOTW / POTP,\u201d \u201cArabesque,\u201d and \u201cWhen I Need A Friend.\u201d As for Sunset: \u201cGuns,\u201d \u201cOrphans,\u201d \u201c\u00c8k\u00f3\u201d (the Yoruba word for Lagos), \u201cCry Cry Cry,\u201d \u201cOld Friends,\u201d \u201c\u0628\u0646\u06cc \u0622\u062f\u0645\u201d (bani adam in Arabic, meaning \u201cmankind\u201d), \u201cChampion of the World,\u201d and \u201cEveryday Life.\u201d\n\nTrack list for Coldplay\u2019s new album listed in the classifieds of the Sydney Morning Herald @coldplay @coldplayxtra pic.twitter.com/KnKX07rtLk \u2014 Kate Lyons (@MsKateLyons) October 24, 2019\n\nThe track lists are very sorority girl before and after she went to Nigeria and came back with a tapestry, a hunger for jollof, and a new lease on life. Big study-abroad energy. The band has previously been accused of cultural appropriation, for example, with the song \u201cPrincess of China.\u201d We\u2019ll find out if Everyday Life adds to that tradition when it drops on November 22. The old-fashioned ink-and-paper track-list reveal echoes Coldplay\u2019s decision to send typewritten album announcements to fans. (They did, ultimately, post it on Instagram themselves, so really what difference did it make?) Soon, all these tiny baby clues are hopefully going to come together to make a banging Coldplay album and not some sort of Goop stationery collab.", "description": "Coldplay has announced the track list for their upcoming album, \u2018Everyday Life,\u2019 which features two records, \u2018Sunrise\u2019 and \u2018Sunset.\u2019", "authors": ["Zoe Haylock"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/24/24-chris-martin-coldplay.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
