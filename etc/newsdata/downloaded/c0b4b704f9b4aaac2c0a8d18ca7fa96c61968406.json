A lot of guys have been here and are in their second World Cup, and we have empowered these guys to handle the situation.\n\n\"I must mention, being a forwards coach and my contact time with the forwards, how mature the guys have become over the last three or four years.\"\n\nKick-off on Saturday is at 11:00 (SA time).", "description": "Springbok skipper Siya Kolisi will earn his 50th Test cap in Saturday's Rugby World Cup final against England.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7960/ff1eb6f5481a44c3b53c400057b82b20.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
