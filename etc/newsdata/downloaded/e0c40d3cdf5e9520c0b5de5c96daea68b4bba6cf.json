Each of the agency directors went as far as to describe which types of companies their regulatory bodies oversee.\n\nRelated: SEC Rejects Bitwise\u2019s Latest Bitcoin ETF Proposal\n\nIn his comments, Blanco seemingly applied the BSA to virtual currency service providers, noting that his agency published interpretive guidance in May to address \u201cmoney transmission denominated in value that substitutes for currency,\u201d including cryptocurrencies.\n\n\u201cAs set forth in the 2019 CVC Guidance, a number of digital asset-related activities qualify a person as an MSB [money services business] that would be regulated by FinCEN,\u201d he said. \u201cFinCEN\u2019s BSA regulations also provide that any person \u2018registered with, and functionally regulated or examined by, the SEC or the CFTC,\u2019 would not be subject to the BSA obligations applicable to MSBs, but instead would be subject to the BSA obligations of such a type of regulated entity.\u201d\n\nClayton said his agency\u2019s mandate is to protect investors, ensure fair markets and aid capital formation, which generally oversees the securities space, but added that the BSA does provide the SEC with some other requirements.\n\n\u201cBroker-dealers and mutual funds are required to implement reasonably-designed AML Programs and report suspicious activity. These rules are not limited in their application to activities involving digital assets that are \u2018securities\u2019 under the federal securities laws,\u201d he said.\n\nJay Clayton image via CoinDesk archives\n\nRelated Stories", "description": "The heads of three U.S. financial regulators warned the crypto industry to abide by banking laws in a joint statement published Friday.", "authors": ["Nikhilesh De"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/mgMzwt4dEm.LvrbJrTuYkg--~B/aD0xMDA0O3c9MTUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/coindesk_75/21cb1cfeeafff35b6e1a808de71f19e0", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
