The Chinese group owns 29.99 per cent of Bacanora and a 22.5 per cent stake in its Sonora lithium mining and processing project in Mexico. Bacanora has received \u00a322million, and Ganfeng\u2019s vice president Wang Xiaoshen has joined its board. Chinese firms have been buying lithium deposits as demand for the metal used in electric car batteries has boomed. Shares grew 7.3 per cent, or 2.5p, to 37p.\n\nJP Morgan downgraded its stock from \u2018neutral\u2019 to \u2018underweight\u2019 and trimmed its target price back from 1073p to 1050p \u2013 based on their estimate that there will be a further 85 warehouses, at a value of 6.1p per share each.\n\nBut the downgrade bruised Ocado\u2019s stock, which closed 1.5 per cent lower, down 19.5p, at 1302.5p. M&S, recently relegated from the FTSE 100, rose 1.7 per cent, or 3.2p, to 189.05p.\n\nMid-cap Ukrainian iron ore miner Ferrexpo tumbled 3.1 per cent, or 4.55p, to 143.15p after the firm\u2019s board backed its chief executive, billionaire Kostyantin Zhevago, amid allegations of misconduct surrounding a former business of his.\n\nMedia reports last week said Ukrainian authorities were seeking to put Zhevago on an international wanted list after he failed to report for questioning about a bank he owned until 2015.\n\nHe denies any wrongdoing \u2013 and the board said it understands he has not been served with any legal notices.\n\nSeparately, Ferrexpo has been mired in scandal this year over questions about funds donated to a charity connected with the mining group.\n\nElsewhere, the Footsie\u2019s major mining firms suffered after data about the Chinese economy showed that the Asian superpower\u2019s exports tumbled by 6.5 per cent and imports by 8.5 per cent last month, as the ongoing trade spat with the US took its toll.\n\nChina is the world\u2019s largest consumer of metals, which it uses in building and manufacturing.\n\nThe disappointing figures knocked 2.5 per cent, or 49.6p, off Anglo American, which closed at 1935p, while Rio Tinto fell 2.2 per cent, or 94.5p, to 4115p and Glencore slid 2.8 per cent, or 6.65p, to 230.85p.\n\nAs markets waited in limbo over the outcome of US-China trade talks and about what will happen next with Brexit, the Footsie fell 0.5 per cent, or 33.63 points, to 7213.45 and the FTSE 250, which is more swayed by what happens in the UK, lost 0.6 per cent, or 111.81 points, to close at 19929.9.\n\nEmerging markets investor Ashmore rose 1 per cent, or 5p, to 484p, after the amount of losses it made in the three months to the end of September was offset by bringing in slightly more in new business.\n\nThis meant its assets were virtually flat \u2013 at \u00a373billion \u2013 when compared with the quarter before.\n\nRail operators were in the red for much of the day following reports that Prime Minister Boris Johnson is keen to overhaul the franchise model, which has been used since the 1990s when the rail system was privatised.\n\nStagecoach, which runs the West Coast franchise, closed down 1.2 per cent, or 1.7p, at 142.5p, as First Group, which operates Great Western Railway, closed flat at 128.5p.\n\nOn AIM, fresh cream cakes seller Cake Box lost 3 per cent, or 5p, to end at 165p after it forecast sales for the six months through September will rise 6 per cent to \u00a38.8million.", "description": "According to JP Morgan brokers, Ocado's market value is 'already stretched'.
