But outside the window, chaos reigns and great palls of tear gas hang over the street as black-clad protesters fight a pitched battle with police. Welcome to Grappa\u2019s\u2014the Italian restaurant with a ringside seat at the Hong Kong protests.\n\nAn extraordinary, almost surreal video filmed from inside the restaurant\u2014a long-standing fixture on Hong Kong\u2019s dining scene\u2014shows an Oct. 6 clash between anti-government protesters and police on Queen\u2019s Road East. Opposite is the swanky Three Pacific Place office complex. The area is on the front line of the Hong Kong protests because it is near Hong Kong\u2019s main government offices and legislature. Thousands of protesters rally regularly at these official buildings before they are driven away. Pursued by police firing tear gas, protesters often retreat down Queen\u2019s Road East, a convenient side street that is home to Grappa\u2019s and many other businesses. Of course, on most days of the week there are no protests and customers dine in perfect safety, but when there are disturbances, Grappa\u2019s provides a front-row perch for anybody unfortunate enough to be caught inside.\n\nIn the video, voices can be heard providing an excited narrative. \u201cOh, [a projectile] hit the umbrella! You can hear it!\u201d somebody says in Cantonese. \u201cThey\u2019re using water to put out the tear gas,\u201d remarks another with interest, as though commenting on a sporting match.\n\n\n\nBut then the bravado quickly gives way to concern. \u201cOh my god, I can\u2019t breathe anymore,\u201d says a Philippine-accented voice in English. \u201cIt\u2019s too much.\u201d\n\n\u201cHey can\u2019t you smell it [tear gas]?\u201d the Cantonese speaker asks. \u201cOf course I can!\u201d somebody replies, before being told: \u201cQuickly! Cover your nose!\u201d\n\nThe stark reality is that the protests have been disastrous for Hong Kong\u2019s hospitality sector. Takings have plummeted as most people prefer to cook at home or get their food delivered. Restaurants have been laying off staff, asking them to take unpaid leave, or switching full time staff to casual terms. Tourists are also staying away. According to the Hong Kong Tourism Board, visitor arrivals in August fell by 40% year on year owing to the unrest. That\u2019s terrible news for an economy already taking a hit from the Sino-U.S. trade war.\n\nStill, the video reflects admirable resilience on the part of Hong Kong business owners. \u201cFor all the chaos, the city has shown a remarkable ability to carry on with its role as one of the world\u2019s premier financial and commercial hubs,\u201d noted a recent article in Bloomberg. The same article drew attention to another extraordinary sight on a recent Sunday at Hutchison House\u2014a prestigious office tower, owned by famed billionaire Li Ka-Shing, that is undergoing redevelopment. While protesters rampaged in the surrounding streets, construction workers could be made out on the top of the structure, working incessantly and building for tomorrow.\n\n\u2014With reporting by Aria Chen / Hong Kong", "description": "Watch a surreal video filmed from inside the eatery of the street battle outside", "authors": ["Time Staff"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/q4n61FiLRhdceJ_nhEmkyA--~B/aD0xMjAyO3c9MTc0NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/dfb4cd7e4ac3becbc5f25a5152c103d0", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
