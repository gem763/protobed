I salute them, and back their calls to ensure that the people must have their say on whatever Boris Johnson has come up with.\n\nBrexhate, the increase in hate crimes, intolerance and fear caused by the referendum result in 2016, has been a black hole that has sucked the life out of our country for far too long. It has created a terrible discourse in our political life, and given free rein to far-right haters to sow their simplistic message of division.\n\nRather than dialling down this mood and working to bring people together, Johnson has added fuel to the fire with his bombast and bluster. Our reckless leader is wrecking our country.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

The \u201c\u00a3350m a week to the NHS\u201d was their battle-cry, but this figure was really their battle-lie. The British public\u2019s anger over that infamous claim on the side of that bus, or lies about Turkey\u2019s ascension to the EU, are still real and raw.\n\nJohnson and the extreme right don\u2019t want the people to have their say because they\u2019re scared of what the result might be now their lies and half-truths have caught up with them and people can see what Brexit will really mean.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

They are running scared because the people know what a disaster Brexit will be for jobs, our economy, our communities and our place in the world. People didn\u2019t vote to be poorer, and they didn\u2019t vote for years of wrangling over our final divorce with Brussels, which is what leaving will really mean. Any deal is just the beginning of Brexit hell, not the end of it.\n\nJohnson is the anti-Churchill and wants to destroy Churchill\u2019s dream of the United Countries of Europe. Brits don\u2019t quit, and he would not have wanted us to turn our backs on our continental neighbours. Churchill was fighting the extreme right wing back in the 1930s and we are now fighting them once again. Churchill wanted Britain to be great, as do I; Donald Trump, Boris Trump and Nigel Trump want us to be Little England again.\n\nTheir dream of Little England is about closing ourselves off, pulling up the draw bridge and turning our backs on the world. They don\u2019t care if Brexit ends the union, and our country and continent splinters apart. Theirs is a simplistic 1930s view of politics, and we know what happened then. Division, disaster, and death on an industrial scale.\n\nIn the 21st century, this backwards world view is folly. We need to come together, and learn to live and work together in some shape or form. People instinctively know this, and that\u2019s why so many are marching with hope, not hate, to demand a People\u2019s Vote and the chance to turn the page on this terrible chapter in British politics.\n\nOur country is at breaking point. In these tough times, despite some trying for compromise, our MPs can\u2019t reach an agreement. That\u2019s why whatever happens in parliament on Saturday \u2013 and I hope MPs vote down Johnson\u2019s half-baked, terrible Brexit plan \u2013 the Great British public must have their say on what happens next. People are marching on Saturday to say we want our future back.", "description": "Tens of thousands of people will be descending on London from all corners of the country to demand a vote on the Brexit deal.
