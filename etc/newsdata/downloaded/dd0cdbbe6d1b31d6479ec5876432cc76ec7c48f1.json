On Sunday, Ms. Pelosi, a devout impeachment skeptic, gave the administration until Thursday to hand over the whistle-blower complaint or face \u201ca whole new stage of investigation.\u201d Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, felt moved to tweet that it was \u201ccritical\u201d for the facts to come out.\n\nCome Monday, and rolling into Tuesday, Washington was buzzing with a nervous energy. Everyone was on high alert, frantically scanning for signs of where things were headed next. Ms. Pelosi was canvassing her members about impeachment. With every House Democrat who stepped forward to speak about Ukraine \u2014 Debbie Dingell, Rosa DeLauro, John Lewis \u2014 the scramble to analyze the odds of impeachment began anew. In a Monday op-ed in The Washington Post, seven freshman House Democrats, including some from districts Mr. Trump won in 2016, came out in favor of a formal impeachment investigation. Twitter was awash in clich\u00e9d metaphors describing the shifting politics \u2014 the dam was breaking, the tide was turning, the winds were shifting. (In the real world, it always bears remembering, most people were less transfixed by the news from Washington.)\n\nRepublicans remained notably tepid about rushing to the president\u2019s defense. The Senate Intelligence Committee, led by Richard Burr of North Carolina, opened an investigation into the matter and made clear it wanted to hear from the whistle-blower as soon as possible. Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, publicly asserted that he had pushed for the funding for Ukraine and received no explanation for why it had been held up by the administration.\n\nAt some point Tuesday, the rumbling began that Ms. Pelosi would hold an afternoon news conference to announce the opening of a formal impeachment inquiry. Shortly after 2 o\u2019clock, Mr. Trump tweeted that he had authorized the release of the \u201ccomplete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript\u201d of his call with Mr. Zelensky.", "description": "It\u2019s a start, maybe.", "authors": ["The Editorial Board"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/25/opinion/25stakes_alt/25stakes_alt-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
