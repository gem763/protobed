This analysis aims first to contrast CEO compensation with other companies that have similar market capitalization. Then we'll look at a snap shot of the business growth. Third, we'll reflect on the total return to shareholders over three years, as a second measure of business performance. This method should give us information to assess how appropriately the company pays the CEO.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Nationwide Building Society\n\nHow Does Joe Garner's Compensation Compare With Similar Sized Companies?\n\nAccording to our data, Nationwide Building Society has a market capitalization of UK\u00a31.7b, and paid its CEO total annual compensation worth UK\u00a32.4m over the year to April 2019. That's a modest increase of 2.4% on the prior year year. While this analysis focuses on total compensation, it's worth noting the salary is lower, valued at UK\u00a3885k. Importantly, there may be performance hurdles relating to the non-salary component of the total compensation. We examined companies with market caps from UK\u00a3804m to UK\u00a32.6b, and discovered that the median CEO total compensation of that group was UK\u00a31.4m.\n\nAs you can see, Joe Garner is paid more than the median CEO pay at companies of a similar size, in the same market. However, this does not necessarily mean Nationwide Building Society is paying too much. A closer look at the performance of the underlying business will give us a better idea about whether the pay is particularly generous.\n\nYou can see, below, how CEO compensation at Nationwide Building Society has changed over time.\n\nLSE:NBS CEO Compensation, September 24th 2019 More\n\nIs Nationwide Building Society Growing?\n\nOn average over the last three years, Nationwide Building Society has shrunk earnings per share by 43% each year (measured with a line of best fit). In the last year, its revenue is down 1.6%.\n\nUnfortunately, earnings per share have trended lower over the last three years. And the impression is worse when you consider revenue is down year-on-year. It's hard to argue the company is firing on all cylinders, so shareholders might be averse to high CEO remuneration. Although we don't have analyst forecasts you might want to assess this data-rich visualization of earnings, revenue and cash flow.\n\nHas Nationwide Building Society Been A Good Investment?\n\nNationwide Building Society has served shareholders reasonably well, with a total return of 26% over three years. But they probably wouldn't be so happy as to think the CEO should be paid more than is normal, for companies around this size.\n\nIn Summary...\n\n\n\n\n\nWe compared the total CEO remuneration paid by Nationwide Building Society, and compared it to remuneration at a group of similar sized companies. We found that it pays well over the median amount paid in the benchmark group.\n\nWe think many shareholders would be underwhelmed with the business growth over the last three years. And while shareholder returns have been respectable, they have hardly been superb. So we doubt many shareholders would consider the CEO pay to be particularly modest!
