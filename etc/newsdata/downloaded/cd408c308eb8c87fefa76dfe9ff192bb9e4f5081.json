It has funded the Libyan Coast Guard to catch and return migrant boats to North Africa. It has set up centers in distant Niger to process asylum seekers, if they ever make it that far. Most don\u2019t.\n\nEven as that arm\u2019s-length network comes under criticism on humanitarian grounds, it is so overwhelmed that the European Union is seeking to expand it, as the bloc aims to buttress an approach that has drastically cut the number of migrants crossing the Mediterranean.\n\nIt is now preparing to finish a deal, this time in Rwanda, to create yet another node that it hopes will help alleviate some of the mounting strains on its outsourcing network.", "description": "The European Union is preparing to pay Rwanda to host migrants evacuated from Libya, extending an outsourcing policy that is already under criticism.", "authors": ["Matina Stevis-Gridneff"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/26/world/xxeu-migrants1/xxeu-migrants1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
