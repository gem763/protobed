Sokolowski-USA TODAY Sports\n\nAndreas Johnsson contributed a goal and an assist, and John Tavares and Auston Matthews each scored a goal for the Maple Leafs, who won their second consecutive game following a three-game losing streak. Toronto goalie Frederik Andersen made 27 saves.\n\nAll of Toronto\u2019s scoring came in the second period, with Rielly matching the club assist mark set by Rick Vaive on March 12, 1984.\n\nLightning 3, Canadiens 1\n\nSteven Stamkos scored a goal and an assist, and Nikita Kucherov recorded two assists as Tampa Bay earned a victory at Montreal. The Lightning, who are 9-1-2 in their past 12 games against the Canadiens, also got goals from Braydon Coburn and Tyler Johnson.\n\nStamkos\u2019 fourth goal of the season put Tampa Bay ahead 2-1 just 1:04 into the second period. It was the 397th goal of Stamkos\u2019 career, breaking a tie with Hall of Famers Dave Keon and Paul Coffey for 98th on the NHL\u2019s all-time goal-scoring list.\n\nThe Lightning trailed 1-0 after a dominant opening start minutes from the Canadiens that included Jeff Petry\u2019s power-play goal at 15:46 into the first period.\n\nHurricanes 2, Kings 0\n\nMartin Necas scored in the second period, Sebastian Aho added a late empty-netter, and Carolina overcame a slow start to earn a victory at Los Angeles.\n\nWith their high-powered offense held in check, the Hurricanes picked things up on defense in the opener of a four-game road trip and a three-game swing through California. Petr Mrazek made 31 saves while earning his first shutout of the season and improving to 4-0-0.\n\nAfter winning its first five games of the season, Carolina took a 3-2 defeat at home against the Columbus Blue Jackets on Saturday before bouncing back Tuesday. The latest win came in an unexpected low-scoring affair between the high-scoring Hurricanes and the defense-challenged Kings.\n\nCoyotes 4, Jets 2\n\nChristian Dvorak and Nick Schmaltz ignited a three-goal second period as Arizona blew past host Winnipeg.\n\nDvorak recorded his sixth career two-goal game, and Schmaltz added a goal as the Arizona linemates broke a 1-1 tie by potting all of their tallies in the second. The Coyotes, who improved to 2-0-1 in the past three games, netted goals on both of their power plays after entering the game 0-for-9 on the season.\n\nSchmaltz contributed two assists for a three-point game. Conor Garland notched a goal for the Coyotes, Oliver Ekman-Larsson chipped in two helpers, and Darcy Kuemper recorded 38 saves on 40 shots to improve to 2-2-0.\n\nFlames 3, Flyers 1\n\nMichael Frolik celebrated his 800th NHL game in fine fashion by scoring once amidst a memorable first couple of shifts as host Calgary beat Philadelphia.\n\nFlames goalie David Rittich made 21 saves to backstop his team to a victory that snapped a two-game losing skid.\n\nFrolik opened the scoring 95 seconds into the affair, just the second time this season the Flames got the first goal. Then Andrew Mangiapane provided the hosts with something that\u2019s been missing so far this season, a goal from the bottom two lines, when he doubled the lead at 14:15 of the second period.\n\nPredators 5, Golden Knights 2\n\nKyle Turris and Nick Bonino each had a goal and an assist, and Pekka Rinne finished with 33 saves to lead Nashville to a victory over Vegas in Las Vegas.\n\nColton Sissons, Calle Jarnkrok and Filip Forsberg also netted goals for Nashville, which has scored at least five goals in four of its first six games. Ryan Ellis added a pair of assists.\n\nMark Stone and Reilly Smith scored goals and Marc-Andre Fleury made 34 saves for Vegas, which had a two-game win streak snapped.\n\nCanucks 5, Red Wings 1\n\nJ.T. Miller scored two power-play goals, and Thatcher Demko made 26 saves to win his first start of the season as Vancouver capped an unbeaten homestand with a victory over Detroit.\n\nElias Pettersson and Alexander Edler each had a goal and two assists for the Canucks, who improved to 3-0 at Rogers Arena. Troy Stecher also scored for the Canucks, who were 3-for-5 with the man advantage, and Brock Boeser added three assists.\n\nDylan Larkin scored the lone goal for Detroit, and Jonathan Bernier stopped 27 of 32 shots.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "Mitchell Marner scored a goal and added two assists, Morgan Rielly tied a team record with four assists in one period, and the Toronto Maple Leafs defeated the visiting Minnesota Wild 4-2 Tuesday night.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441379889&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F0DT-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
