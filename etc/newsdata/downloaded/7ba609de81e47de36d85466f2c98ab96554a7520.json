It teased and toyed with the question of who would be Logan\u2019s sacrificial lamb, it took a detour through the achingly sad, dark places in Tom and Shiv\u2019s marriage, it wound its way back around to the most obvious and most correct choice for a sacrifice. And then, it twisted the knife in the most surprising and satisfying way.\n\nLet\u2019s start with a quick recap: The previous episode ended Logan\u2019s promise that a \u201cblood sacrifice\u201d would have to be made to appease his shareholders.\n\nThat\u2019s roughly where the finale began, too: Logan hears from a major shareholder that, actually, the best blood sacrifice might be him.\n\nThen the whole Roy family gets on a giant yacht on the Mediterranean and it\u2019s off to the races.\n\nRoman\u2019s eyebrows, seen here responding to the knowledge that the axe is about to fall, should be nominated for their own special eyebrow Emmy.\n\nAt breakfast, everyone sits around the table to discuss the best optics for the sacrifice, prompting pretty much everyone to ask: What about Tom?\n\nLogan is \u2026 dubious.\n\nNo conclusions are drawn, and then Kendall and Logan go for a father-son boat ride that is not ominous at all.\n\nIn a brief scene that will change the way I eat chicken forever, Tom decides that if he\u2019s going to be sacrificed, he\u2019s going down swinging.\n\nThis is the only \u201cputting sunglasses on\u201d meme you can use now. Sorry, I don\u2019t make the rules.\n\nIf you put on sunglasses, you\u2019re walking away with a big \u201cscrew you.\u201d But if you put on headphones too, you\u2019re the one who\u2019s getting screwed.\n\nLogan finally tells Kendall that the sacrifice is going to be him. Kendall looks completely shattered.\n\nThis kiss is surely a Godfather reference that should\u2019ve warned us all what was going to happen, but I still didn\u2019t see it coming!\n\nShiv, watching the press conference where everyone expects Kendall to fall on his sword, knows things are very bad.\n\nBUT KENDALL ROY IS NOT GOING DOWN LIKE THIS! HE WILL NOT BE THE BOAR ON THE FLOOR TODAY.\n\nShiv is stunned.\n\nRoman is also stunned (also feat. eyebrows).\n\nKEN-W-A DROPS THE MIC!!\n\nIs Logan proud here? Stunned? Horrified? Could this really be the final blow for L to the OG? RIP to a real one.", "description": "The Succession season finale was everything I could have possibly dreamed.
