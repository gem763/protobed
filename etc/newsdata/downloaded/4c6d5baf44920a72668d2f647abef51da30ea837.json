The military also denies any involvement in civilian politics.\n\nElection authorities rejected opposition complaints of rigging in the 2018 vote.\n\nRehman is a veteran politician who heads an alliance with several seats in the National Assembly and provincial assemblies. But his real influence comes from his ability to mobilise support, particularly in numerous religious schools, or madrasas, across the country.\n\nThe main opposition parties of former prime ministers Nawaz Sharif and Benazir Bhutto have both said they would back Rehman's campaign against Khan, though have also said they would not support any unconstitutional action.\n\nThe government has said it wants negotiations with the opposition while vowing that no one would be allowed to paralyse life in the capital.\n\n\"Only the state has the monopoly over violence,\" Information Minister Firdous Ashiq Awan said on Monday, adding that it was not fair for the opposition to destabilise the country at a time of tension with old rival India over the disputed Kashmir region.\n\nPakistan has also been struggling to avert a balance of payments crisis and to prevent its debt from spiralling out of control.
