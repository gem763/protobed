That would be the sensible way forward.\"\n\nEarlier, the prime minister warned he would seek an election if MPs dismissed the plan.", "description": "UK Prime Minister Boris Johns has suffered another defeat after MPs rejected a motion to examine the government's Brexit bill in the House of Commons in three days.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/23/5daf5635a310cf3e97a27ca5.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
