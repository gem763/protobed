There was also a planned visit to a pub near the Trump resort owned by a distant cousin. The rest of Pence\u2019s meetings were in Dublin. Instead of staying in Dublin and heading to Doonbeg one evening to visit the pub, Pence went the other direction.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nUpdate: After this article published, a representative for the vice president noted that Pence had also briefly met with customs officials at the Shannon airport.\n\nPerhaps this was indeed a logistical decision made after Hurricane Dorian upended Pence\u2019s plans and not something related to Trump. But it\u2019s hard to believe that Trump\u2019s views weren\u2019t a consideration, given how commonly Trump properties have been used by government agencies and political groups since he took office.\n\nOh, and given that Pence\u2019s team at one point admitted that Trump had made the suggestion.\n\nWe learned last month of another egregious example of a Trump ally selecting a Trump Organization property to benefit from the government\u2019s generosity. Attorney General William P. Barr selected Trump\u2019s hotel in Washington as the site of a family holiday party in December \u2014 possibly benefiting Trump\u2019s private company to the tune of more than $30,000. While Pence\u2019s staff told reporters that he was paying his family\u2019s costs for staying at the Trump property in Ireland, The Post has documented a number of other examples where Trump visits to Trump Organization properties has resulted in spending from other government agencies at the same property during the visit.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nData on government spending at Trump properties is limited, as it generally involves submitting Freedom of Information Act requests for data. That said, groups such as ProPublica have compiled existing data focused on the beginning of 2017 to determine where and when government agencies and political action committees have spent money at Trump properties.\n\nOn nearly 500 days of Trump\u2019s 958-days-old presidency, political action committees or government agencies including the departments of Defense and State have spent money at Trump Organization properties.\n\nYou can see on the chart above how limited spending data for government agencies is. It\u2019s safe to assume that spending at Trump properties didn\u2019t stop after June 2017. CNN has reported that Defense spent about $173,000 at Trump properties from October 2017 to November 2018, spending not indicated on the graph above.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe constant political spending is also important. Before Trump\u2019s clinching the Republican Party\u2019s nomination in May 2016, political groups not directly derived from Trump\u2019s campaign had spent only about $2,300 at Trump properties in the 2016 spending cycle. By Election Day, that surged to $33,000. In the 2018 cycle, according to ProPublica data, the number jumped to $2.75 million.\n\nWhat\u2019s missing from the chart above are Trump\u2019s own visits to his company\u2019s properties (and, on one occasion, a property in Hawaii that licenses his name). We\u2019ve compiled this data before; Trump has visited his own properties at a rate of more than twice a week since becoming president.\n\nIf we combine those visits with the documented visits/spending in the first chart, the attention lavished on the Trump Organization is more obvious. On 682 of Trump\u2019s 958 days in office, Trump, a government agency or official or a political action committee has visited or spent money at a Trump property.\n\nThat\u2019s more than seven out of every 10 days, or about five days out of every week.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAgain, maybe Pence\u2019s decision to stay at the Trump Organization property was a purely logistical one. And perhaps the dozens of other times government officials have chosen to spend money at Trump properties were simple economic calculations. Perhaps Barr couldn\u2019t find another venue that met his family\u2019s needs for its holiday party. Perhaps the dozens of political groups spending money at Trump properties simply appreciate the available amenities in a way they didn\u2019t before Trump becoming the Republican nominee for president.\n\nOr perhaps there\u2019s another motivation.\n\nA previous version of this report inaccurately said that Attorney General William P. Barr is planning to hold a Justice Department party at the Trump hotel in Washington. The party is for Barr\u2019s family.\n\nAD", "description": "At least.", "authors": ["Philip Bump", "National Correspondent Focused Largely On The Numbers Behind Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/hZzGNMx8Pqt-Bo-DW_Jy6Aei40U=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/M4M366GOS4I6TJRABKIWK3L5WY.jpg"}
