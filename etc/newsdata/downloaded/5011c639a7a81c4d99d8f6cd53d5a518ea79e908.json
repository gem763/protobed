Its phone sales reached 200 million units by Oct 22, 64 days ahead of last year.\n\nMeanwhile, the phone maker also unveiled a line of new 5G products at the news conference in Shenzhen, including Mate 30 5G phones, 5G mobile Wi-Fi and its first 5G commercial module for the industrial market.", "description": "Foldable smartphones are becoming a new trend among major handset brands, but industry experts believe their high price remains the biggest obstacle to their popularity in the short term.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/24/5db0fd15a310cf3e97a2aeba.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
