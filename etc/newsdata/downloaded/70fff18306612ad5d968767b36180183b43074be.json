Rarely in modern history has the death of one man been so consequential.\n\nWhen the dissident and writer walked into his country\u2019s consulate in Istanbul on 2 October last year, Saudi Arabia was enjoying a moment in the global spotlight. Its ambitious leader had embarked on an extensive reform programme that was starting to overcome doubters.\n\nWorld leaders including Donald Trump and Emmanuel Macron were clamouring to be seen alongside Mohammed bin Salman, a thirtysomething prince who had promised to change the world.\n\nAll that was overturned in the minutes after Khashoggi entered the Saudi diplomatic mission, where a team of state assassins ambushed and butchered the critic and columnist \u2013 all captured on hidden microphones planted by Turkish spies.\n\nThe brutality was captured in its entirety, laying bare a premeditated mob-style hit that was soon traced to the door of the Saudi royal court. And there its stain remains 12 months on \u2013 despite Crown Prince Mohammed\u2019s repeated denials that he had personally issued the \u201ckill order\u201d.\n\nThe aftershocks continue to ripple through the region\u2019s capitals and battlefields.\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mohammed bin Salman said in a television interview that he took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.

In the year since Khashoggi\u2019s assassination, Prince Mohammed has largely been isolated. The acclaim he enjoyed while tabling a remarkable array of reforms has given way to outrage and recrimination.\n\nThe prestige brought to the kingdom by Trump\u2019s 2017 state visit \u2013 which reset Washington from its Obama-era pivot to Iran to a default support for Saudi Arabia \u2013 has cost the US leader.\n\nTrump\u2019s tough talk about alliances has stopped short at defending the desert kingdom \u2013 even after a devastating drone and missile attack on oil facilities that both countries blame on Iran.\n\nThat attack, which Washington and Riyadh insist was launched by regular Iranian forces, from Iranian soil \u2013 not Houthi proxies in Yemen who claimed responsibility \u2013 took offline half of Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil production, and clipped 5% from the world\u2019s daily supply.\n\nIt was described as an act of war and was widely predicted to provoke a US response. But no retaliation has come, partly because of Trump\u2019s reluctance to commit US forces to another regional conflict, and partly because of re-election calculations. The potential fallout from defending such a tainted friend is also believed to have been a factor.\n\nHas Saudi Arabia got away with the murder of Jamal Khashoggi? \u2013 podcast Read more\n\nIn the eyes of Saudi Arabia\u2019s rivals, Khashoggi\u2019s murder has derailed Prince Mohammed, 34, and lessened his family\u2019s claim to be protector of Islam\u2019s holiest shrines, through which the modern House of Saud draws much of its legitimacy. Iran and Turkey also lay claim to speaking on behalf of Islam and each hold stronger regional hands.\n\nTurkey\u2019s propaganda efforts have centred on diminishing Prince Mohammed to the point where he is no longer seen as an obvious heir to his father, King Salman.\n\nIn doing so, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan believes he has weakened an opposing axis comprised of Prince Mohammed, the United Arab Emirates\u2019 leader, Mohammed bin Zayed, and President Sisi of Egypt.\n\nLining up on the other side are the Turkish leader, the Emir of Qatar and the remnants of Egypt\u2019s Muslim Brotherhood, many senior members of which live in exile in both countries.\n\nThe Brotherhood remains the bogeyman of Erdo\u011fan\u2019s rivals, yet their collective goal of weakening political Islam as a regional presence has stalled, largely due to Saudi\u2019s loss of regional clout.\n\nKhashoggi, who had voiced regular support for political Islam including in one of the last columns he wrote for the Washington Post, has become a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre for the Erdo\u011fan axis and for those claiming Prince Mohammed\u2019s reform programme was largely a smokescreen for him to grab power.\n\nAfter laying low for much of the year, the Crown Prince agreed to two interviews broadcast ahead of the anniversary of Khashoggi\u2019s death.\n\nHe told Frontline, an investigative strand on the American TV channel PBS, that because the killing \u201chappened on my watch, I bear full responsibility\u201d.\n\nThe collective, rather than personal, claim has done little to appease those demanding the de facto leader face global justice for the murder, which has been pinned on the 15-man team dispatched from Riyadh to lie in wait for Khashoggi.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Turkish forensic science officers leave after searching the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 18 October 2018.

He has not been charged with any offence, but has been nominally removed from his roles.\n\nFive of the alleged hit squad are facing the death penalty in Riyadh, where global demands for retribution for the crime resonate less.\n\nDomestic agendas dominate discourse in Saudi Arabia, where Khashoggi is rarely discussed. Nor is the fate of other dissidents who have defied the Saudi state and remain in prison, such as Loujain al-Hathloul, a women\u2019s rights activist who has been imprisoned for the last two years and is charged with undermining state security.\n\nMany Saudis remain reluctant to speak out inside the country and are even fearful of doing so on trips abroad. \u201cWe have learned the Syrian way,\u201d said one woman in Beirut. \u201cWe can have whatever freedoms the state says we have. Still, it\u2019s better than nothing.\u201d\n\nThree months ago, guardianship laws restricting women from many life decisions, including divorce and travel, were lifted \u2013 potentially the most transformative move yet among the cultural and economic reforms that Prince Mohammed continues to roll out.\n\nHis efforts at home to remake Saudi Arabia into an Arab nationalist police state \u2013 in the mould of Abu Dhabi rather than Cairo \u2013 are continuing more or less as billed.\n\nHis bid to recast himself as a statesman, however, has failed \u2013 and may never recover.\n\nKhashoggi\u2019s death appears certain to define the nominal heir throughout his life and remains a threat to the destiny he sees for himself \u2013 a coronation after the death of his father, who is aged 83.\n\nWhile he will probably still win the throne, Prince Mohammed\u2019s bid to win the region is now far less certain.", "description": "The Saudi Crown Prince\u2019s reputation may never recover after the assassination a year ago", "authors": ["Martin Chulov"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31eb59bdc852851ed2767a051df70d47c2fd2a7b/0_189_3998_2400/master/3998.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=46b4f32f1a4d68e8ecf996907dd0c615"}
