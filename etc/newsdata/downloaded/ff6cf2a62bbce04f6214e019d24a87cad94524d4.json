Evan's wife Sabrina can be heard berating him as he cycles up to the car window on her pink bike\n\nDefiant: As the Indiana dad-of-three's wife tells him she's 'going to have him committed' in the hilarious clip, he doesn't even flinch\n\nIn a new viral video posted by Evan's wife Sabrina, she jokingly said that Michael Myers 'strikes again' and that she wishes Halloween were over already.\n\nThe clip shows Evan in the mask made infamous by the mental patient character in the Halloween slasher movies released during the 1970s and 1980s.\n\n'Oh my God. What the hell are you doing,' Sabrina can be heard saying as Evan cycles past on her pink bike and brakes to a halt.\n\n'Oh my God, are we these people now? Riding around with a skeleton baby and my bike?'\n\nHer defiant husband merely stares back at her without moving a muscle.\n\nNot batting an eyelid: Evan's youngest son doesn't seem to mind his dad's penchant for the creepy costume\n\nTrailing behind him, a skeleton baby can be seen in the attached trailer.\n\nSabrina adds: 'Oh my God. Seriously, get home, or I'm going to have you committed!'\n\nGag: Come Halloween time, Sabrina knows Evan will be pranking her with moves like putting a skeleton in the car seat, pictured\n\nAs he cycles off and the Halloween theme tune plays faintly, Sabrina turns to her eldest son and says incredulously, 'I leave to pick you up for a football game and your dad does this c**p.'\n\nHer son simply laughs in response as, evidently, he's used to his dad's macabre hobby.\n\nAnd while she might sound like she's fed up of her husband's shenanigans, it's all in jest.\n\nSabrina even runs a Facebook page called 'Michael Myers of Decatur' where the couple post hilarious - yet equally chilling - videos of Evan's antics.\n\nIn a video posted earlier this week, Evan aka Michael can be seen peering in the window of his son's karate studio.\n\nAnother clip shows him feeding the couple's one-year-old son in a rocking chair while in his alter ego's getup.\n\nHe was even filmed attempting to navigate a hover board before comically falling off it - with his fake knife still grasped in his hands.\n\n'Idiot': Viral videos show Evan goofing around in costume as Sabrina rolls her eyes and calls him an idiot as he falls off his hover board, right\n\nJokers: Sabrina and Evan have been sharing the pranks online for over five years and have found themselves with a social media fan club\n\nOff duty: For the other eleven months of the year, Evan looks like your typical dad-of-three, but he makes up for it at Halloween\n\nIn the background, Sabrina can be heard muttering 'Idiot' under her breath.\n\nThe videos routinely rack up hundreds of thousands of views and shares and the Zimmermans have even become sought-after neighbors.\n\n'Is that house for sale next door? I would love to move next to you guys just to see this every Halloween season,' said one Facebook commentor.\n\n'I'm up and moving to your neighborhood to see this every year,' one person added.\n\n'Is that a For Sale/Rent sign across the street??? ... because if so I\u2019m moving that way just to watch you guys all day,' echoed a similar sentiment.\n\n'I want you as my friends so badly,' said another.", "description": "A Halloween-loving dad-of-three trolls his neighborhood in Indiana every October by donning a Michael Myers costume in viral videos that his wife captures and posts to social media", "authors": ["Freya Drohan For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/21/20196894-0-image-a-186_1572034756861.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
