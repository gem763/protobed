We've got a little bit of a marathon here,\" he said after the three-hour hearing in New York City's northern suburbs.\n\nPurdue's bankruptcy filing has effectively frozen all litigation against the company, which its lawyers said has been spending more than $250 million a year on legal and professional fees, but it has not stopped lawsuits against the Sacklers from moving forward.\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James, who is suing the Sacklers and opposes the proposed settlement, said last week that her office found that members of the family used Swiss and other accounts to transfer $1 billion to themselves.\n\nAttorney Marshall Huebner representing Purdue Pharma as seen in court on Tuesday, September 17, 2019, in White Plains, New York. Aggie Kenny\n\nPurdue lawyer Marshall Huebner said he hoped states that are opposed to the proposed settlement could be persuaded to change their positions.\n\n\"It is, in essence, America itself that stands to benefit or lose from the success or failure of these reorganization proceedings,\" Huebner said.\n\nNone of the Sacklers attended the hearing, but the family name did come up several times as Purdue lawyers declared that they wouldn't benefit from any steps taken Tuesday to keep the company in business.\n\nAs the bankruptcy unfolds, Purdue will continue to pay its approximately 700 employees under preexisting salary structures.\n\nNo member of the Sackler family is an employee and none will receive payments, Purdue lawyer Eli Vonnegut said.\n\nBecause of commitments Purdue made before the bankruptcy filing, the company will pay sign-on bonuses to five employees and retention bonuses to about 100 employees. The company agreed to hold off on seeking to continue other bonus plans, such as incentive bonuses.\n\nDrain, the judge, also allowed the company to continue covering legal fees for current and former employees, which Vonnegut estimated wouldn't exceed $1.5 million per month. The company stopped covering legal fees for members of the family on March 1, he said.\n\n\"We swear up and down that no payments will go to the Sacklers,\" Vonnegut said.\n\nPurdue lawyers argued that the sign-on and retention bonuses were vital to attracting and keeping top talent in a tumultuous time for the company. Covering employee legal fees is important to morale and sends a strong signal that the company backs the people who work for it, the lawyers said.\n\nBankruptcy trustee Paul Schwartzberg objected, saying the bonuses went \"way beyond\" normal compensation and were padding the pockets of employees who already make upward of $300,000 a year.\n\nCassandra Gauthier contributed to this report.", "description": "Lawyers for the pharmaceutical company secured permission to maintain business as usual \u2014 paying employees and vendors, supplying pills to distributors and keeping current on taxes and insurance", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/18/8ad61398-b8b9-4cb8-aab0-e9836c26a87f/thumbnail/1200x630g6/231d2ffb2d7d6a0bb1a6a33f709b0467/gettyimages-1134500886.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
