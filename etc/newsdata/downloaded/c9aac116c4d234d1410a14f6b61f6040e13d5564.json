Other research in animals has shown that maternal stress can raise levels of the stress hormone cortisol in the uterus, affecting the offspring.\n\n\u201cWhat's clear from our study is that maternal mental health matters, not only for the mother but also for her future child,\u201d said Professor Monk.", "description": "Stressed women are more likely to have a girl than a boy, research has shown.", "authors": ["Henry Bodkin", "Science Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/01/TELEMMGLPICT000018255677-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq1qK9fS0WD7QU0EDCDdqwlh8X6iOpiIWEItn7dHA-Jwo.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
