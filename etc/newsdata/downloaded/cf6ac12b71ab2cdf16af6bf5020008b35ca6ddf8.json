The resolution now has every Senate Republican except for Sens. Mitt Romney (R-UT), Susan Collins (R-ME), and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) cosponsoring it.\n\nThe Graham-McConnell resolution would allow President Trump the ability to confront his accusers, call witnesses on his behalf, have a basic understanding of the accusations against him, allow for House Republicans to participate in all proceedings, and give them an equal amount of authority to issue subpoenas.\n\nSen. Johnny Isakson\u2019s (R-GA) office told Breitbart News in a comment Friday that he wants to ensure a \u201cfair process\u201d for the impeachment proceedings.\n\nConservative organizations have also backed Sen. Graham\u2019s initiative, urging senators to back the resolution.\n\nThe Club for Growth announced Friday that they will \u201ckey vote\u201d Sen. Graham\u2019s resolution so that Pelosi \u201ccan\u2019t deny Republicans and President Trump basic constitutional rights.\u201d\n\nClub for Growth President David McIntosh said a statement Friday:\n\nLiberals know how unpopular their socialist policies are so they\u2019re resorting to false attacks and character assassination to try to win in 2020, and it won\u2019t work. We are asking all Senators to cosponsor S.Res. 378 and send a clear message that Nancy Pelosi can\u2019t deny Republicans and President Trump basic constitutional rights and shouldn\u2019t use impeachment as a crutch to overcome her own electoral challenges.\n\nThe Tea Party Patriots Action Honorary Chairman Jenny Beth Martin applauded Sen. Graham\u2019s resolution in a statement, saying:\n\nThree cheers for S.Res. 378, Sen. Graham\u2019s condemnation of the House\u2019s unprecedented so-called \u2018impeachment\u2019 action! What Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff and their cronies have done with their kangaroo court is so far beyond the pale it would be laughable, if it weren\u2019t so serious, and we\u2019re encouraged to see that the vast majority of GOP Senators, including the Majority Leader, have already signed on as cosponsors. What Pelosi and Schiff have done in the House is a sham. No due process, no right to confront one\u2019s accuser, no right to cross-examine witnesses, no right to bring in one\u2019s own witnesses, no right even to be present while witnesses are being interviewed \u2026 somewhere in Moscow, there\u2019s a former Stalin-era \u2018show trial\u2019 \u2018prosecutor\u2019 rolling over in his grave.\n\nEven some Republican attorneys general have backed Sen. Graham\u2019s resolution.\n\nArkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge tweeted Thursday night, \u201cWhen something as serious as impeachment is being discussed, it is crucial that the public have transparency in the process. Democracy dies in the dark.\u201d\n\nWhen something as serious as impeachment is being discussed, it is crucial that the public have transparency in the process.

Rand Paul (R-KY) cheered Sen. Graham\u2019s \u201csymbolic resolution\u201d to condemn the secret impeachment proceedings; however, Paul said the Senate Judiciary Committee should \u201chold hearings and subpoena witnesses to find out how this hoax got started.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m fully supportive of @LindseyGrahamSC symbolic resolution to condemn the secret impeachment proceedings in the House of Reps. How about the @senjudiciary actually hold hearings and subpoena witnesses to find out how this hoax got started? Long past due! \u2014 Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) October 24, 2019\n\nRep. Lee Zeldin (R-NY) said there are many House Republicans that would like Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Graham to start investigating the origins of the intelligence officer\u2019s \u201cwhistleblower complaint.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are members of the House who would like [Graham] to take that to the next level,\u201d Zeldin told POLITICO Wednesday. \u201cThe Senate Judiciary Committee might be that vehicle to let the American people more in on what the whole story is.\u201d", "description": "Conservatives have made the House Democrats' secretive and closed-door practices a rallying cry for supporters of President Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Sean Moran"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Lindsey-Graham-Resolution-Press-Conference-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
