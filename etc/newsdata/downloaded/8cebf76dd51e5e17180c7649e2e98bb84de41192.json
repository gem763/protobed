In addition to a sanctions package, lawmakers are also discussing a resolution that would formally oppose Trump's decision to pull back U.S. troops and call on him to reverse course.\n\n\"President Trump should use this moment to step up, do the right thing, and correct course. He can listen to his national security and military advisors, and to the chorus of bipartisan voices in Congress and across the world who made it clear that this was a grave mistake worth reversing,\" Schumer, Reed and Menendez added.\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) added in a tweet that \"sanctions are a necessary step\u2014as long as they are stringent & swift\u2014but more must be done to help repair the broken promises & shattered lives caused by Trump\u2019s reckless & senseless betrayals.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiBiden on impeachment: 'I'm the only reason' it's happening Democrats to offer resolution demanding Trump reverse Syria decision Rand Paul calls for probe of Democrats over Ukraine letter MORE (D-Calif.) and Sen.
