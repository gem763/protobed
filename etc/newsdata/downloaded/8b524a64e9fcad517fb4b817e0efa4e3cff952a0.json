Why should I go to his funeral? I don\u2019t have fuel,\u201d a Harare resident told the Agence France-Presse news agency. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to hear anything about him anymore. He is the cause of our problems.\u201d\n\nAnother, Amos Siduna, added: \u201cI didn\u2019t like him, but I still wanted to attend just to see for myself that he is gone... but kombis [minivan taxis] want $3.50 just to get to the stadium. That\u2019s too much money for me just to go and say \u2018bye bye\u2019 to a corpse. Mugabe\u2019s corpse. No.\u201d\n\nAmelia Tukande, who was selling mobile phone chargers near the stadium, added: \u201cWhat will I get if I go there? What will Mugabe do for me now that he failed to do when he was alive? It is a waste of time. I have to work for my family.\u201d\n\nThe funeral was attended by some supporters of the former president, who led a bitter guerrilla war to end white-minority rule in the country when it was known as Rhodesia.\n\nSupporters of Zimbabwe\u2019s ruling Zanu-PF party also attended.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

It is now $9. I am just here to say, \u2018Sorry President Mugabe, we didn\u2019t know things will be worse.\u2019\u201d\n\nAgencies contributed to this report", "description": "African leaders praised Zimbabwe\u2019s former president Robert Mugabe as a hero during a poorly-attended funeral at the country\u2019s National Sports Stadium.", "authors": ["Conrad Duncan"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/14/16/mugabe-funeral.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
