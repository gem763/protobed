This portfolio integrates mobile voice, mobile video, rich communication services (RCS) and SMS messaging, voicemail, interactive voice response (IVR), chatbots, SpamShield\u2122 fraud management and monetization enablers into secure, carrier-grade cloud offerings.\n\nThese are combined with digital enablement capabilities for provisioning, onboarding, and invoicing businesses via an intuitive, omnichannel interface. This embedded functionality avoids long, complex and costly integrations with the existing legacy business support systems (BSS) of the service provider or channel partner, accelerating time-to-market and time-to-revenue.\n\nMavenir\u2019s Mobile Business Fabric solutions are currently deployed and under deployment in several Tier 1 MNOs in the US, UK, Spain, Germany, India and Japan.\n\n\u201cMavenir\u2019s vision is to transform mobile network economics and accelerate the business transformation for mobile operators and channel partners,\u201d said Guillaume Le Mener, SVP and GM, Mobile Enterprise Solutions, Mavenir. \u201cMobile Business Fabric is a cohesive portfolio that provides true mobile-native experiences and addresses the deskless mobile user base to generate additional revenue streams, protect their existing customer base and reduce customer churn.\u201d\n\nSupporting Information:\n\nToday, 80% of the global workforce are mobile \u201cdeskless\u201d first line workers and the top 8 deskless industries\u2014agriculture, education, healthcare, retail, hospitality, manufacturing, transportation and construction\u2014employ 2.7 billion employees i .\n\n. Deskless mobile workers require simplified workflows leveraging their powerful mobile devices on the go.\n\nToday, the majority of solutions in the market have been designed for office workers and then adapted to include some limited mobility capabilities. This can lead to user frustration, particularly for emerging mobile small and medium businesses (SMBs), which have been underserved.\n\nMavenir\u2019s Mobile Business Fabric flips the paradigm over with a mobile-native portfolio that doesn\u2019t require IT administrators, hardware investments, or complex device management, while providing seamless onboarding to help accelerate time to revenue.\n\n\u201cAs an innovative and agile Software as a Service (SaaS) solution, Mavenir\u2019s Mobile Business Fabric portfolio enables our global partners to target the Enterprise market, as well as the underserved SMB segment,\u201d said Marek Wasilewski, SVP, Global Enterprise Channel. \u201cOur disruptive solutions designed for the deskless mobile workers\u2014who typically have an I want to do it myself and I want it now mentality\u2014simplify onboarding, remove management complexity, and, ultimately, are focused on adding positive business outcomes.\u201d\n\nThe Mobile Business Fabric portfolio comes to market with the following solutions:\n\nMobile Business Messaging \u2014 RCS Business Messaging as a service that enables MNOs to address the brands\u2019 need to communicate with customers on the mobile messaging channel\u2014including marketing campaigns (A2P) and chatbots (P2A)\u2014leveraging Mavenir\u2019s RBM Partner Ecosystem to accelerate time-to-revenue.\n\n\u2014 RCS Business Messaging as a service that enables MNOs to address the brands\u2019 need to communicate with customers on the mobile messaging channel\u2014including marketing campaigns (A2P) and chatbots (P2A)\u2014leveraging Mavenir\u2019s RBM Partner Ecosystem to accelerate time-to-revenue.
