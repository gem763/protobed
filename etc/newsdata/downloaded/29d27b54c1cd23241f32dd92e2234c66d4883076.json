We are not a Cabinet of sock puppets and nodding dogs.'\n\nAnother Cabinet minister said it would be 'very hard' for them to stay in the government if the Tories decided to become a No Deal party.\n\nThey also predicted a 'very large number' of Tory MPs would quit if Mr Johnson campaigned for a bad break from Brussels.\n\nThere is increasing speculation that the PM will ditch attempts to strike a deal with the EU in the coming days after his proposals were effectively killed off in a furious phone call with German chancellor Angela Merkel.\n\nMs Merkel reportedly said that Northern Ireland would have to stay in the EU's customs union to avoid a hard border and for a deal to be agreed but Mr Johnson refused on the grounds that would separate Ulster from the rest of the UK.\n\nMeanwhile, the suggestion the Tories could commit to a No Deal Brexit as their preferred outcome was bolstered by a bombshell briefing from a Number 10 source earlier this week.\n\nThe source told The Spectator magazine that if the EU rejects the PM's proposals and then offers a Brexit delay, Number 10 will 'make clear that this government will not negotiate further so any delay would be totally pointless'.\n\nMr Smith, the Northern Ireland Secretary, appeared to hint at his red lines for staying in the Cabinet in a tweet sent yesterday\n\nGeoffrey Cox, pictured leaving Downing Street yesterday, has reportedly threatened to quit the Cabinet if the PM does not comply with an anti-No Deal law\n\nThe source continued: 'They think now that if there is another delay we will keep coming back with new proposals. This won't happen.\n\n'We'll either leave with No Deal on 31 October or there will be an election and then we will leave with No Deal.'\n\nMr Smith appeared to hint at his red lines for remaining as Northern Ireland Secretary yesterday when he tweeted: 'I am clear that any threat on withdrawing security cooperation with Ireland is unacceptable. This is not in the interest of NI or the Union.'\n\nMs Morgan, the Culture Secretary, has previously outlined her opposition to a No Deal Brexit and surprised many in Westminster when she accepted a job in Mr Johnson's Cabinet given his stance that a bad break must be an option.\n\nMr Hancock, the Health Secretary, has also previously opposed a No Deal split but subsequently dropped that opposition.\n\nBoth Mr Cox and Mr Buckland, as Attorney General and Justice Secretary respectively, would be likely to quit if Mr Johnson tried to dodge or frustrate an anti-No Deal law passed by MPs.", "description": "Amid reports that scores of backbenchers could quit in a revolt over the hardline tactic a group led by ex-Minister Damian Green met the Prime Minister in Downing Street today.", "authors": ["David Wilcock", "Whitehall Correspondent", "Jack Maidment", "Deputy Political Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/18/19503210-0-image-a-95_1570642229936.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
