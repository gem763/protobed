You could add pacifist (albeit a militant one who once got arrested after a heated debate with a soldier) and anti-racist, for as Blake\u2019s devastating portrayal of a hanged slave in this show illustrates, he passionately protested against Africa\u2019s subjugation.\n\nHeavenly visions of hell: Alan Moore on the sublime art of William Blake Read more\n\nAnd how about feminist? There is even a book of children\u2019s stories that he illustrated for Mary Wollstonecraft, author of the 1792 manifesto A Vindication of the Rights of Woman. This hackish kids\u2019 book wasn\u2019t the finest hour for either, but it shows their connection through the radical publisher Joseph Johnson, while Blake\u2019s great frontispiece to his own original work Visions of the Daughters of Albion, done in about 1795, shows what he learned from Wollstonecraft: a man and woman are chained back to back, the woman\u2019s head lowered in despair. \u201cEnslaved, the Daughters of Albion weep \u2026\u201d\n\nThis is not an exhibition of some old master honoured by kings and collected by aristocrats. It is a raw encounter with a heretical artisan who was ignored and despised in his lifetime and whose self-taught genius comes out of the popular culture of 18th-century London. In another of the book-illustration jobs he did to keep the tyger from the door, Blake depicts London on May Day. Milkmaids and street kids dance to celebrate the one day that belongs to the people. The entire show begins with Glad Day, a cosmic male nude stretching out his arms, in about 1795, to greet the light of a new age.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The devil in all of us? \u2026 The Ghost of a Flea, c 1819, by William Blake. Photograph: Tate Britain\n\nYet this opening image leads in unexpected directions. It introduces Blake as an artist of the eye. You find yourself forgetting what Glad Day means and just enjoying the scintillating psychedelic colours and strong decisive lines. This is a kind of shock. Yes, this Londoner born in Soho in 1757 studied for a time at the Royal Academy (open to talented plebeians such as him and the Covent Garden barber\u2019s son JMW Turner), was apprenticed to an engraver, and earned what little he ever did as a professional printmaker and artist.\n\nBut his greatness rests \u2013 doesn\u2019t it? \u2013 on his command of the English language. The Tyger and Jerusalem, just to take his biggest hits, will always be read and sung. His self-published illuminated books used the \u201cinfernal\u201d method he said he was taught by the ghost of his dead brother Robert, in which he removed everything except his raised words and pictures from a metal plate with acid. In these books, his art comes as a free gift with his verses \u2013 but is it great art in its own right? Critics conventionally say no. Blake is the contemporary of Constable and Turner but lacks their observational genius, they claim.\n\nTate Britain defies the snobs and sceptics by showing Blake as a straight artist, with only the barest nod to his writings. Blake fans, too, may be enraged at this disavowal of his poetic genius. But it\u2019s worth the loss to get such a stupendous revelation that he is also a genius of art.\n\nThere\u2019s not a dull moment in the razor-sharp artistic apocalypse unveiled here. The Great Red Dragon and the Beast from the Sea, lent by Washington DC\u2019s National Gallery of Art \u2013 the work eaten by a serial killer in Thomas Harris\u2019s Red Dragon \u2013 has to be one of the most compelling delineations of hellish monstrosity in world art. Multi-faced and muscular, the Red Dragon is charged in every sinew with evil \u2013 but it is one of us. It is near the Tate\u2019s own The Good and Evil Angels, with its fire-baked flying golem whose dead empty eyes burn into your mind. Is it an image of the devil in all of us?\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Gothic sensuality \u2026 Newton 1795-c 1805, by William Blake. Photograph: Lucy Dawkins/Tate Britain\n\nFor we are none of us pure. In a depiction of Eve and the serpent, she takes a pear-shaped fruit straight from the serpent\u2019s mouth. It\u2019s clearly an image of cosmic fellatio. Blake is an artist of gothic sensuality. The Night of Enitharmon\u2019s Joy depicts a fleshy raven-haired woman sitting among nightmare animals that could easily have been etched by his contemporary Goya. Behind her back, a naked man and woman embrace.\n\nThis is the art of revolution all right, but not according to anyone\u2019s book but Blake\u2019s own. The French Revolution and the European wars it precipitated dominated his most creative years. His images project the hopes and terrors of his age on a universal scale inspired by Michelangelo\u2019s Sistine Chapel, which the impoverished Blake never saw. That majestic bigness is all in his mind. Entering the exhibition, you see small images lost in big rooms. All the gigantism of Blake\u2019s vision is concentrated in these little printed and hand-coloured pages. Then as you look closer, something mysterious happens. It may be the weird corals under a turquoise sea where his Newton sits in terrible thought, or the pitiable drowning god Urizen, but you fall into Blake\u2019s cosmos and see things his way. His tiny forms become colossal. His symbols blaze with truth.\n\nTyranny and slavery, freedom and fulfilment fight it out in his moral universe but what makes their battle enduring is the depth with which he distils our divided and contrary natures. I believe there really is a Red Dragon. It lives, like all Blake\u2019s images, in the human heart. I must have caught Blake\u2019s religion. It\u2019s a heretic faith in humanity, a belief that everything is holy.\n\nIn this exhibition you will see images that look death and suffering in the eye and still believe in a redeemed humanity, a Glad Day. Blake expresses the worst and best of us. To see this show in all its variety and generosity and not love him, you would need a heart as wizened and shrunken as the tyrant Nebuchadnezzar who crawls below the ocean in one of his most coruscating images. He blows away Constable and Turner \u2013 and that\u2019s with his writing hand tied behind his back.", "description": "We rightly acclaim his writing, but this exhibition brings us Blake the consummate visual artist, depicter of humanity\u2019s divided nature", "authors": ["Jonathan Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6bdfd5c0fd7957224bc0cb6ec1f14d12f3c21cbd/0_637_6892_4135/master/6892.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTUucG5n&enable=upscale&s=cc6d806cb920947278f2d4450b14e031", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
