Bakaj is now the principal attorney for the career CIA officer who worked on the National Security Council under Presidents Barack Obama and Trump before departing and filing a whistleblower complaint with the Intelligence Community inspector general.\n\nThe claim from Gayl helped build opposition to the war and President George W. Bush, who was portrayed as incompetent, and fueled Obama's 2008 victory, which propelled Biden into the vice presidency. But it has come under renewed scrutiny in recent years.\n\nGayl's ability to connect with the staff of a powerful congressional committee, the laudatory media coverage of his complaints, and the link to Biden present striking parallels with the Ukraine whistleblower a dozen years on.\n\nIn 2007, Biden, then a senator for Delaware, referred to the report in his criticism of Bush\u2019s handling of the war. \"I have absolutely no faith, none whatsoever, in this president to voluntarily do what should be done,\" he said. \u201dThe only way it is going to happen is when our Republican friends stop voting with the president and start voting to end this war by supporting our troops.\"\n\nErin Logan, a Biden adviser who worked on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, connected Gayl to USA Today, which wrote about Gayl\u2019s complaint and exposed the problem to a national audience. Logan went on to become a senior Pentagon and National Security Council official in the Obama administration.\n\nHouse Democrats, who won back the majority six years into Bush\u2019s term largely from voter opposition to the war in Iraq, weighed impeaching Bush over his handling of the war. But at least one report rejected Gayl\u2019s claim about the vehicles.\n\nBakaj conducted a \u201creprisal investigation\u201d as a senior investigator for the Defense Department Office of the Inspector General after Gayl\u2019s security clearance was revoked and he was punished with a pay reduction by the military for disclosing the matter.\n\nLike Gayl\u2019s account, the anonymous whistleblower\u2019s report about Trump\u2019s call has been found to include inaccuracies. Republicans, suspecting political influence, are eager to find out the extent of his contact with senior House Democrats before his decision to file a whistleblower complaint. Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff of California is working to shield the Trump whistleblower's identity and said his testimony was no longer necessary, after first describing it as critical to the inquiry.\n\nRepublicans are demanding the whistleblower testify publicly about his claim, which does not match a transcript of the president\u2019s call with Zelensky. Among the discredited claims, Republicans said, is one that Trump \u201cinstructed Vice President Pence to cancel his planned travel to Ukraine to attend President Zelensky\u2019s inauguration.\u201d\n\nThe whistleblower also claimed former Special Envoy for Ukraine Kurt Volker and Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland had \u201cspoken with\u201d Trump\u2019s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, \u201cIn an attempt to contain damage to U.S. national security.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn light of these inconsistencies between facts as alleged by the employee and information obtained during the so-called impeachment inquiry, the Committee ought to fully access the sources and credibility of the employee,\u201d Jim Jordan, Devin Nunes, and Michael McCaul wrote to Schiff last week.\n\nMore than a decade ago, Bakaj helped Gayl after his damning claim that the military was allowing U.S. military and Iraqi civilians die rather than pursue safer offensive and defensive equipment, namely armored Humvees to protect against an onslaught of improvised explosive devices, or IEDs, which accounted for half of U.S. casualties in the war.\n\nA civilian report issued in 2017 by retired Marine Lt. Col. Steve Chill, who obtained documents and emails, countered the claim by Gayl and found an armored Humvee development program was long in the works and of the \u201chighest priority,\u201d contradicting Gayl\u2019s whisleblower claim. \u201cThese perceptions about Marine Corps negligence surrounding the MRAP efforts reflect ignorance of the facts,\u201d Chill said in his report.\n\nPentagon officials reported success with the MRAPs and said the vehicles saved lives. \u201cMRAP is singularly responsible for saving the lives and limbs of thousands of service members in Iraq and Afghanistan,\u201d then-Deputy Secretary of Defense Ash Carter said in 2012.\n\nBakaj is now fighting to keep the Trump whistleblower anonymous and is resisting the GOP\u2019s call for him to testify. \u201cNO Member of Congress knows the whistleblower\u2019s identity. And that\u2019s exactly the point \u2013 to make sure federal employees can come forward to report wrongdoing anonymously and without repercussion,\u201d Bakaj told Jordan via Twitter last week.", "description": "The lawyer representing the anonymous CIA employee who blew the whistle on President Trump's dealings with Ukraine once assisted a whistleblower who worked with Joe Biden's staff to accuse the military of failing to provide armored vehicles to the troops in Iraq.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1fb5299/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2279x1196+0+63/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmediadc.brightspotcdn.com%2Fa3%2Fe2%2Fa75fefad466bb15022c0d1874bd5%2Fwhistleblower-complaint-10.01.19.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
