A vote is due in parliament later on Monday.\n\nThe latest delay plan envisages that Britain could be out on Dec. 1 or Jan. 1 should parliament ratify the agreement in November or December, respectively, according to diplomats who deal with Brexit in Brussels.\n\nThe EU will state that the extension, the third granted so Britain can sort out its departure, will not be used to renegotiate the divorce treaty again and that London should not impede other essential work by the EU on projects from budgets to climate policies.", "description": "EU likely to agree Brexit delay as PM Johnson seeks an election", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9R0GE_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
