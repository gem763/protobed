(Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)\n\nThe acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, William Taylor, testified on Tuesday that he was told the delivery of military aid to Ukraine was contingent on Ukraine promising to investigate corruption allegations against former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter, according to the Washington Post.\n\nTaylor had previously sent a message to Gordon Sondland, ambassador to the EU, on September 9, writing: \u201cAs I said on the phone, I think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d\n\n\u201cDuring that phone call, Ambassador Sondland told me that President Trump had told him that he wants [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelensky to state publicly that Ukraine will investigate Burisma and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election,\u201d Taylor told House impeachment investigators. Hunter Biden was a former board member of Burisma, a Ukrainian natural-gas company, while his father was vice president.\n\n\u201cAmbassador Sondland also told me that he now recognized that he had made a mistake by earlier telling the Ukrainian officials to whom he spoke that a White House meeting with President Zelensky was dependent on a public announcement of investigations \u2014 in fact, Ambassador Sondland said, \u2018everything\u2019 was dependent on such an announcement, including security assistance,\u2019\u201d Taylor continued.\n\n\u201cHe said that President Trump wanted President Zelensky \u2018in a public box\u2019 by making a public statement about ordering such investigations.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was just the most damning testimony I\u2019ve heard,\u201d commented Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D., Fla.).\n\nActing White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney had told reporters on Thursday that Trump had ordered a halt to military aid to Ukraine to pressure the country to investigate interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential elections. Trump and allies have repeatedly alleged that evidence for that interference can be found on a Ukrainian server for Crowdstrike, a cyber security company, following a theory that has been repeatedly debunked.\n\nWhen a reporter said Mulvaney was describing a \u201cquid pro quo,\u201d Mulvaney responded, \u201cWe do that all the time with foreign policy.\u201d\n\nThe next day Mulvaney walked back his comments.\n\n\u201cLet me be clear, there was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukrainian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election,\u201d Mulvaney said. \u201cThe president never told me to withhold any money until the Ukrainians did anything related to the server.\u201d", "description": "Acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor testified on Tuesday that he was told the delivery of military aid to Ukraine was contingent on Ukraine promising to investigate corruption allegations against former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter, according to the Washington Post.", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "Robert Verbruggen", "Andrew C.
