The tag refers to the not uncommon practice of men rolling up their shirts and exposing their barenaked midriffs\u2014a simple cooling technique that\u2019s been embraced in some of the nation\u2019s balmier climes. But while temperatures soar in parts of China, authorities in the eastern city of Jinan are cracking down on the \u201cuncivilised behaviour\u201d of cropped shirts and exposed bellies\u2014claiming it\u2019s \u201cseriously affecting the image of the city,\u201d The Guardian reports.\n\nJinan City issued a notice stating that anyone caught violating the new guidelines and rocking a Beijing bikini could face punishment, particularly in densely populated areas such as parks, public squares, buses, and business areas. Authorities specifically called out the city's older men, referred to as bang ye or \u201cexposing grandfathers\u201d, who they accused of tarnishing the city's image as well \u201cthe perception and feeling of the public\u201d.\n\n\"Urban civilisation is related to everyone,\u201d a spokesperson for the city's civility department said in a recent interview with Beijing Youth Daily. \u201cWe also hope that we can start from scratch and jointly maintain the image of the city.\u201d The spokesperson added that \u201cin recent years, as people have become more civil, cases of people being shirtless have decreased,\u201d but said \u201cthere are still some incidents that impact the city\u2019s image and its citizens\u2019 feelings.\u201d\n\nThe city\u2019s new regulations also discourage residents from other \u201cunseemly\u201d public behaviours such as taking off shoes to air out feet, bathing in bodies of water, spitting on the ground, and queue jumping. Jinan isn\u2019t the first Chinese city to crack down on the Beijing bikini, though. Earlier this year, authorities in Tianjin, in the country\u2019s northeast, issued guidelines stating that those who show too much skin in public could be hit with fines of up to 200 yuan (about $30 USD), according to Sixth Tone.\n\nMany have welcomed Jinan\u2019s recent decision, with commenters on Weibo agreeing that Beijing bikinis are \u201ctoo uncivilised\u201d to be permitted in Chinese cities.\n\n\u201cThe streets are full of middle-aged men showing their bellies,\u201d wrote one Weibo user. \u201cThose with genuine class will not do this. Women on the street do not wish to see your bodies!\u201d\n\nFollow Gavin on Twitter or Instagram\n\nSign up for our newsletter to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.", "description": "The so-called \"Beijing bikini\" is a popular way for Chinese men to cool off.
