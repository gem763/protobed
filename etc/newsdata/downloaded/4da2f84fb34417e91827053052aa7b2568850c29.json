(Lauren Lumpkin/The Washington Post)\n\nThey came with notecards, highlighters and cogent arguments. And their muggy classroom transformed into a courtroom.\n\nAdvanced Placement U.S. Government students at Frederick Douglass High School in Upper Marlboro, Md., spent one morning this week in moot court, a simulation that law students use to practice delivering arguments.\n\nThe teenagers, ahead of Constitution Day this past Tuesday, took on the roles of judges and attorneys while examining Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission v. American Humanist Association \u2014 better known as the Bladensburg Peace Cross case.\n\nThe case involving a 40-foot-tall, 94-year-old, granite-and-concrete cross hits close to home for the students. It unfolded about a 30-minute car ride away from the suburban high school.\n\nThe cross was built on city-owned property in Bladensburg, Md., as a memorial for 49 World War I soldiers from Prince George\u2019s County. The state took it over in 1961.\n\nThe legal battle began when the American Humanist Association accused the state government of unconstitutionally endorsing Christianity with the cross. The nonprofit atheist organization has filed similar lawsuits in other states.\n\n\n\nThe Bladensburg, Md., Peace Cross. (Kevin Wolf/AP)\n\nThe case in Maryland moved through lower courts, and the Supreme Court agreed to hear it in February.\n\nTessa Guarracino, who teaches the government class at Douglass High, said she was impressed with the way her students handled the case.\n\n\u201cI was very proud at how into it they got,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if a lot of 14- and 15-year-olds can say they are passionate about constitutional law.\u201d\n\nThe students spent the weekend researching the case and preparing their arguments. Guarracino\u2019s preparation started before, in July, at a two-day training session by Street Law \u2014 a legal education nonprofit group founded by Georgetown University law students in 1972.\n\n\u201cSeveral law students had the idea that they could teach D.C. high school students about the law and that would help some people avoid legal problems,\u201d said Lee Arbetman, the group\u2019s executive director. \u201cIn a democracy, it doesn\u2019t make sense for only lawyers to know about the law.\u201d\n\nWhat started as a local initiative has grown into an operation with programming in 49 states and 45 countries. In its early days, Street Law deployed lawyers to schools to teach law lessons. Now, high school teachers \u2014 such as Guarracino \u2014 do the work, too.\n\nGuarracino directed her class of 35 students to split into groups of three \u2014 one judge for every two attorneys. Guarracino served as a judge, too.\n\nEach student attorney responded to questions from the judge, scribbled notes while the opposition spoke and delivered a rebuttal.\n\n\u201cThis is very similar to the way real lawyers argue in front of the Supreme Court,\u201d Guarracino told the class.\n\nDavon Chapman, 15, said the exercise solidified his interest in becoming a lawyer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s strengthened my abilities to make persuasive arguments and be more versatile when it comes to knowing about the community,\u201d he said.\n\nTo prepare, the teenagers studied the establishment clause of the First Amendment, which prevents the federal government and states from setting up houses of worship or passing laws that favor one religion over another.\n\nThen, they brought in legal precedent from similar cases to construct their arguments.\n\nEvery student attorney was instructed to defend the state or the American Humanist Association. The assignments did not always align with the students\u2019 personal views.\n\n\u201cThis case makes you have an open mind to everyone\u2019s perspective and everyone\u2019s beliefs,\u201d said Kayln Stanford, 15.\n\nKhandi Walker, 15, said the exercise challenged her biases.\n\nIn June, the Supreme Court in a 7-to-2 ruling upheld the cross display and rejected the humanists\u2019 argument that the monument represented a religious endorsement.\n\nJustice Samuel A. Alito Jr. wrote the majority opinion, saying the Bladensburg cross is more than a symbol of Christianity.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the cross is undoubtedly a Christian symbol should not blind one to everything else that the Bladensburg Cross has come to represent: a symbolic resting place for ancestors who never returned home, a place for the community to gather and honor all veterans and their sacrifices for this nation, and a historical landmark,\u201d Alito wrote.\n\nAlito was joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Clarence Thomas, Stephen G. Breyer, Elena Kagan, Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh.\n\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote in her dissenting opinion that the government\u2019s maintenance of the cross has the same effect as endorsing Christianity. Justice Sonia Sotomayor also dissented.\n\nThe monument continues to tower over a busy intersection on a highway about a mile northeast of the border line separating Maryland and the District.\n\nMost of the judges in Guarracino\u2019s class sided with the two dissenters on the Supreme Court. The students suggested the state of Maryland substitute the cross with something secular, like a plaque or a statue of a soldier.\n\nJamia Handon, 15, said she did not expect the Supreme Court to rule the way it did.\n\n\u201cI was surprised,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you have to remember, this country is very diverse in what people believe in.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Their Maryland classroom became a courtroom so they could practice legal arguments.", "authors": ["Lauren Lumpkin", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/7IG5JfI6dopybaJmBaJL8zp3d00=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KD3UAZWYXMI6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
