(Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)\n\nWashington Redskins wide receiver Paul Richardson Jr. grabbed his face mask in disbelief, unable to hide his emotion after he had snuck behind the Dallas Cowboys\u2019 secondary early in the fourth quarter on Sunday. He was all alone 40 yards downfield, wide open for a surefire touchdown \u2014 yet quarterback Case Keenum didn\u2019t see Richardson, instead throwing underneath into coverage for a near interception.\n\n\u201cI totally missed Paul. He was wide open and I just totally missed him,\u201d Keenum said in a somber tone after a humbling 31-21 loss, a second consecutive division setback that underscored a glaring problem for the Redskins to open the season: an inability to generate big plays.\n\nWashington had just two plays of 20 yards or more Sunday, both of which belonged to rookie wide receiver Terry McLaurin, and now the Redskins are searching for any other playmakers to step up for an injury-prone unit that was simply outgunned against the muscular Cowboys at FedEx Field.\n\n\u201cIt was frustrating,\u201d Richardson said, shaking his head.\n\n\u201cWe have to reload our shells and come back firing,\u201d Keenum added, although it remains unclear who is going to do the firing when the Chicago Bears visit for \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d next week.\n\n[Boswell: Think the Redskins\u2019 start to the season has been bad? It may be about to get worse.]\n\nWith much of its offensive firepower sidelined indefinitely \u2014 Pro Bowl left tackle Trent Williams is still holding out, running back Derrius Guice is on injured reserve with a torn meniscus, and tight end Jordan Reed missed a second consecutive game Sunday while in concussion protocol \u2014 McLaurin has arguably been the only bright spot. He hauled in a late touchdown and finished with the offense\u2019s longest play of the day \u2014 a 27-yard reception \u2014 as part of an impressive 10-catch, 187-yard, two-touchdown start to his NFL career, which is just two games old. But beyond McLaurin, there are questions as to where this unit will find a spark next week, let alone the next 14 games.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s hard to kind of call it right now,\u201d running back Adrian Peterson said of the offense\u2019s struggles.\n\nKeenum was underwhelming. Peterson rushed for just 25 yards on 10 carries. Richardson caught a nine-yard touchdown pass but was targeted just three times. A cast of other contributors struggled to make plays; backup running back Chris Thompson was used mostly on checkdowns, catching five passes for 46 yards, and Keenum threw behind him on a crucial fourth and three at the Dallas 46-yard line early in the fourth quarter. Washington also worked to incorporate speedy rookie wide receiver Steven Sims, who received more carries (three for 16 yards) than targets (one catch for one yard).\n\n\u201cWe definitely feel that we have to go make a play,\u201d Sims said.\n\nWashington\u2019s lack of big plays was magnified by Dallas\u2019s collection of talent, which after a slow start electrified a crowd that was overwhelmingly full of blue and white jerseys. It wasn\u2019t just quarterback Dak Prescott, who completed his final 18 passes and threw for 269 yards and three touchdowns \u2014 including a third-quarter strike to star wide receiver Amari Cooper.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just Cooper commanding constant attention from Washington\u2019s secondary, nor was it just running back Ezekiel Elliott posting 111 yards and a bruising late touchdown. It was also little-known receivers who complemented those stars: Michael Gallup led the way with six catches, and Devin Smith torched Redskins cornerback Josh Norman for a 51-yard touchdown catch in the first half.\n\nWashington, despite all of its speed with McLaurin, Richardson and even Sims, rarely took shots down the field with Keenum on Sunday. The most glaring miss came when Keenum didn\u2019t see a wide-open Richardson on the aforementioned third down early in the fourth quarter. Washington went just 2 for 9 on third downs and committed a string of crucial holding penalties.\n\n\u201cWe want to put the ball in the air so we can make plays,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cWe know that it\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\nWashington wants to move the ball on the ground, too, and Peterson noted how important it would be to quickly revive the offense before Chicago\u2019s high-caliber defense visits next week. Peterson smiled a few times during his postgame interview session while answering questions about a milestone on Sunday: He scored a one-yard touchdown in the first half to pass Jim Brown for fifth on the NFL\u2019s all-time rushing touchdowns list. But he could hardly celebrate it, because Washington\u2019s ineptitude on offense had returned.\n\nIt will take much more than Peterson to get back on track. Keenum said that he needs to call the plays quicker, and the \u201coffense needs to communicate better.\u201d He also faced questions about improving his timing with his receivers during this early first season in Washington, which has been already been mired by an 0-2 start in which the Redskins haven\u2019t come close to matching the playmaking of their two NFC East opponents.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what the NFL season is about,\u201d Keenum said. \u201cIt is about progressing and finding what you do well, to be better at it.\u201d\n\nMore Redskins coverage:\n\nThe key moments from Redskins\u2019 loss to the Cowboys\n\nSvrluga: The Redskins\u2019 defense was supposed to be the strength of the team.
