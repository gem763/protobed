Smith and Carlson recently traded jabs after a guest on the latter\u2019s called senior judicial analyst Andrew Napolitano a \u201cfool\u201d in response to his view that Trump committed a crime.\n\nNetwork president Jay Wallace described Smith in a prepared statement as \u201cone of the premier newscasters of his generation and his extraordinary body of work is among the finest journalism in the industry.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis integrity and outstanding reporting from the field helped put Fox News on the map and there is simply no better breaking news anchor who has the ability to transport a viewer to a place of conflict, tragedy, despair or elation through his masterful delivery,\u201d Wallace continued.\n\nSmith said he \u201cwon\u2019t be reporting elsewhere, at least in the near future,\u201d under his agreement with Fox News. Meanwhile, rotating anchors will host the 3 p.m. slot until a new program is announced, the network said.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/79/a4/0ae94adc4db4b8dff5d669d5b5c0/191011-shepard-smith-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
