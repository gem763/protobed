People can change, but I don't think you can rebuild that trust.'\n\nAs the discussion moved on to whether both parties are responsible when one person cheats, the model said she felt in no way responsible for Jamie's affair.\n\nShe said: 'Never did I feel responsible for what happened.\n\n'I think I've had so much therapy to teach me to love myself, to respect myself. And if you can respect yourself, then someone will respect you.'", "description": "Danielle Lloyd, 35, from Liverpool, appeared on GMB to discuss Hillary Clinton's recent claim that staying with her husband Bill after cheating scandals was the most 'gutsy' decision she'd made.", "authors": ["Monica Greep For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/10/19291668-0-image-a-21_1570182906905.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
