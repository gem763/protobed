REUTERS/Sarah Silbiger\n\n\u201cOur obligation is to use our tools to support the economy, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll continue to do,\u201d Powell said at the University of Zurich.\n\nStill, he said, \u201cWe are clearly at a time where there is a range of views\u201d among Fed policymakers meeting Sept. 17-18 to decide on rates.\n\nPowell\u2019s careful wording reflects a split within the U.S. central bank about how best to respond to an economy where the job market and consumer spending are strong but rising trade tensions between Beijing and Washington, Britain\u2019s possibly messy exit from the European Union, and a broad global slowdown pose risks.\n\nBoston Fed President Eric Rosengren for instance has made the case for leaving rates where they are until those risks are more tangible in the economic data.\n\nOthers including St. Louis Fed President James Bullard have called for a half-a-percentage point interest-rate cut to get ahead of the trade war risks and bring the Fed\u2019s policy rate more in line with market expectations. Meanwhile, financial markets are betting Fed policymakers will agree to split the difference and follow their quarter-point rate cut in July with another one later this month.\n\nPowell said policymakers will be closely watching geopolitical risks, financial conditions, and other incoming economic data as they weigh what to do.\n\nMIXED DATA\n\nFed officials are particularly focused on whether a drop in business spending and a manufacturing slump brought on by rising trade uncertainty is spreading to other parts of the economy. Factory activity declined in August as U.S. President Donald Trump ratcheted up tariffs on imports from China, and China retaliated in kind.\n\nFed research published earlier this week estimated that trade uncertainty could shave about $200 billion from U.S. GDP by early 2020, as companies hold off on investments.\n\nBut so far there are few signs the uncertainty is translating into job loss. U.S. job growth slowed more than expected in August, a government report showed Friday, but strong wage gains and a rebound in hours worked suggested resilience.\n\nPowell, who spoke a few hours after the jobs report, said it was his expectation the U.S. and world economies would continue to grow moderately and would avoid any recession.\n\nBut there are also troubling signs in financial markets, most notably an inversion of the Treasury yield curve, which historically has pointed to a recession 18 months to two years ahead. The Fed\u2019s target range for its benchmark policy rate, now 2% to 2.25%, exceeds yields on nearly all Treasuries.\n\nTrump on Friday kept up his call for the Fed to lower interest rates, saying policymakers were wrong to raise them last year.\n\nPowell for his part said he wasn\u2019t listening to Trump, or to a call from former New York Fed President Bill Dudley for factoring the 2020 presidential election into his rate-setting decisions.\n\n\u201cPolitical factors play absolutely no role in our process, and my colleagues and I would not tolerate any attempt to include them in our decision-making or our discussions,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are going to act as appropriate to sustain the expansion.\u201d\n\nPowell\u2019s remarks are the last publicly scheduled comments from a U.S. central banker before the Fed\u2019s September meeting.", "description": "The U.S. Federal Reserve will continue to act \"as appropriate\" to sustain the economic expansion in the world's biggest economy, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Friday in Zurich, sticking to a phrase that financial markets have read as signaling further interest-rate reductions ahead.", "authors": ["John Revill", "Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1427001843&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF851LW-OCABS", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
