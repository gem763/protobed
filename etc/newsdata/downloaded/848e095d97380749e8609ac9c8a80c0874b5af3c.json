They also tried to set fire to ATMs and branches of mainland Chinese banks, setting off sprinklers in at least two.As night fell, protesters returned to the streets, setting trash on fire in intersections. Police responded with more tear gas.Many of the protesters wore masks in defiance of a recently introduced ban on face coverings at public gatherings, and volunteers handed more out to the crowd.Organizers said they wanted to use their right to protest as guaranteed by the city's constitution despite the risk of arrest.\"We're using peaceful, rational, nonviolent ways to voice our demands,\" Figo Chan, vice convener of the Civil Human Rights Front, told reporters. \"We're not afraid of being arrested. What I'm most scared of is everyone giving up on our principles.\"\n\nThe group has organized some of the movement's biggest protest marches. One of its leaders, Jimmy Sham, was attacked on Wednesday by assailants wielding hammers.On Saturday, Hong Kong police arrested a 22-year-old man on suspicion of stabbing a teenage activist who was distributing leaflets near a wall plastered with pro-democracy messages. A witness told local broadcaster RTHK that the assailant shouted afterward that Hong Kong is \"a part of China\" and other pro-Beijing messages.The protest movement sprang out of opposition to a government proposal for an extradition bill that would have sent suspects to mainland China to stand trial, and then ballooned into broader demands for full democracy and an inquiry into alleged police brutality.", "description": "Police beefed up security measures for the unauthorized rally, the latest chapter in unrest that has disrupted life in the financial hub since early June.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/4245164/1000x563_nbc-afp_1lk9ul_f819cbbb8539806a63540ef7719b3ca7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
