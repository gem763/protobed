Cheng later contacted Tan to work in Alethia.\n\nTan also revealed that she believed Cheng had difficulties obtaining her representative license.\n\nSoon after joining the company, Tan was appointed as a director of Altheia. According to Tan, Cheng told her that this was because the firm required at least two directors with relevant experience in order to obtain the capital market license needed to register as a fund management company.\n\nTan added that she later left the company because it was \u201cnot acting as an actual fund management firm\u201d.\n\nSuspicions aroused\n\nApart from not giving advice to clients and conducting management activities such as portfolio analysis, Tan noticed that Alethia effectively only had four clients. The four British Virgin Islands-registered companies were owned by three Malaysian nationals: Idris bin Abdullah, Oei Cheu Kok, and Neo Kim Hock.\n\nWhile Tan said they did not know how they were connected, she explained that these account holders were a \u201cgroup\u201d together with Soh and his alleged co-conspirator, Quah Su-Ling.\n\nTan was given authority to place orders in the trading accounts of these companies, as well as that of a company owned by Cheng\u2019s father, Alethia Elite. However, she soon realised that trades under these accounts were made in only four counters: Blumont Group, LionGold Corp, Asiasons Capital (now Attilan Group), and Inno-Pacific Holdings (now Innopac Holdings).\n\nDuring examination-in-chief by deputy public prosecutor Jiang Ke-Yue, Tan said that Cheng referred to these four counters as the \u201cJS shares\u201d \u2013 referring to John Soh. When asked why this was the case, Tan said that this was because Soh was the \u201cboss of all these counters\u201d.\n\nTan recounted an incident when Soh called the office looking for Cheng. She noted that throughout her time in the company, none of the other clients had ever called the office or given her instructions to place orders.\n\nSoh had tried to place an order to buy 1.2 million LionGold shares once \u201cthe screen appear 1 million shares sold,\u201d Tan said. Following this phone call, Tan said that Cheng told her to \u201conly take instructions on placing orders from [her]\u201d. However, Cheng then confirmed the instruction to buy 1.2 million LionGold shares.\n\nIn court on Thursday, Tan testified that this aroused her suspicions. She explained that Soh\u2019s instruction was \u201cnot a simple buy or sell order\u201d, and that she believed it was \u201cactually a market manipulation\u201d. She added that she believed that Soh and Quah were in fact the ones instructing trade orders in the accounts.\n\nBizarre love triangle\n\nTan said that she suspected that Cheng had business dealings with Soh, but could not be sure of the details.\n\nHowever, on further probing by DPP Jiang, Tan revealed that Cheng had shared that she was \u201cunhappy\u201d to be \u201cin a love triangle with Soh and Quah\u201d. According to Tan, this was because \u201c[Cheng] felt Soh preferred Quah to her\u201d.\n\nWhile Cheng is said to have been in a \u201cromantic relationship\u201d with Soh, the latter was also believed to be \u201cromantically involved\u201d with his alleged co-conspirator Quah.\n\nTan said that as she often stayed late in the office in the course of her work, Cheng would often share details of her relationship with Soh. On some occasions, Cheng would also chat with Tan about this over WhatsApp messages.\n\nAccording to Tan, Cheng shared more \u201cabout [her] romantic relationship [with Soh] than [their] business dealings\u201d.\n\nDPP Jiang in court on Thursday displayed several messages exchanged between Tan and Cheng, which showed Cheng\u2019s displeasure with Soh and Quah being together. Cheng also referred to Quah as \u201cAunty\u201d \u2013 a disparaging term for an elderly woman.\n\n\u201cBasically, all the messages are complaints from [Cheng] about Mr John Soh and Ms Quah Su-Ling,\u201d says Tan, when asked by DPP Jiang about a series of messages exchanged on April 11, 2013.", "description": "SINGAPORE (Oct 24): The former personal assistant to Adeline Cheng Jo-Ee, the former romantic partner of alleged 2013 penny stock crash mastermind John Soh Chee Wen, revealed in court on Thursday that she had suspected that Cheng\u2019s company was involved in the manipulation on stocks.
