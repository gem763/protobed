(AP) - Two adults and three children were found dead with gunshot wounds in a Massachusetts home Monday, authorities said.\n\nThe five family members were found in an Abington condominium complex at about 7:30 a.m. by a relative who showed up to take the children to school, Plymouth District Attorney Timothy Cruz said at a news conference.\n\n\"It's a crime, a crime occurred in that building. Three little children are gone forever,\" said Cruz, who also noted it appears they died of gunshot wounds.\n\nHe said there is no threat to the public but would not elaborate further on what happened, saying it's still under investigation.\n\nThe district attorney's office identified the deceased as 40-year-old Deirdre Zaccardi, 43-year-old Joseph Zaccardi, 11-year-old Alexis Zaccardi and 9-year-old twins Nathaniel and Kathryn Zaccardi.\n\nAbington police Chief David Majenski said there was no history of domestic issues with the family.\n\nA woman from the Massachusetts Chief Medical Examiners Office, center, uses a gurney to place human remains into a vehicle as law enforcement officers hold caution tape at a home where two adults and three children were found dead with gunshot wounds, Monday, Oct. 7, 2019, in Abington, Mass.
