REUTERS/Peter Nicholls\n\nLOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The sequel to Walt Disney Co\u2019s 2014 hit \u201cMaleficent,\u201d which begins rolling out in global theaters on Wednesday, puts three women at the center of a fight for control between humans and fairies.\n\nAngelina Jolie stars in \u201cMaleficent: Mistress of Evil\u201d as the titular villain and dark fairy godmother to Aurora, the queen of the fairies played by Elle Fanning.\n\nWhen Aurora becomes engaged to the human Prince Phillip, the pending marriage brings Maleficent in conflict with Aurora\u2019s future mother-in-law, Queen Ingrith, who is played by Michelle Pfeiffer.\n\nIt is the rare Hollywood movie where men are in secondary roles. \u201cThey\u2019re just not the focus\u201d in this film, Pfeiffer told Reuters in an interview.\n\nChiwetel Ejiofor, in the role of a mysterious figure named Conall, said the movie plays with many of the traditional narratives typical to fairy tales.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s like 100 tropes that are exploded in this film,\u201d Ejiofor said. \u201cSeeing those explored in different ways, I think is very exciting.\u201d\n\nThe sequel reflects the message of the original, which urged people not to judge a book by its cover or to attach labels to others that ostracize them.\n\nThe sequel amplifies the look with more fantastical creatures and more intricate costumes.\n\n\u201cYou try that little bit harder to say \u2018We\u2019ve got to give them something better or we\u2019ve got to give them something a little more fun,\u201d said Jolie, who also acted as a producer of the film, \u201cor this would make a better Halloween costume for the kids.\u201d", "description": "The sequel to Walt Disney Co's 2014 hit \"Maleficent,\" which begins rolling out in global theaters on Wednesday, puts three women at the center of a fight for control between humans and fairies.", "authors": ["Rollo Ross", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441252490&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E1Y8", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
