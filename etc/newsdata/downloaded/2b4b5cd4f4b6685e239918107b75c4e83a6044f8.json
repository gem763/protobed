The orchard sits back from the main road, which in places is no more than a potholed track that cuts through jungles and villages. The plot of land is tranquil and filled with birdsong.\n\nFor 42 years Sugio has cultivated his hectare, diligently planting a variety of colourful fruits and vegetables. He points out corn, durian, rambutan, pepper and sweet potato plots; ducks and chickens wander around in the afternoon sun. \u201cWe have everything we need here,\u201d he says. \u201cOur family can\u2019t even eat everything before it spoils, so we sell it at the market. Our life is already perfect.\u201d\n\nBut he worries it might not be perfect much longer. The future of Sugio\u2019s farm is under threat because it sits on land that has been earmarked for the site of Indonesia\u2019s new capital, which is set to be moved from Jakarta to the sparsely-populated regencies of Kutai Kartanegara and Penajam Paser Utara on the island of Borneo.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sugio in his beloved orchard, which sits on land designated for the new capital.

Explaining the rationale, Jokowi said that, \u201cA capital city is not just a symbol of national identity, but also a representation of the progress of the nation. This is for the realisation of economic equality and justice.\u201d\n\nThe move comes amid dire predictions for the future of Jakarta \u2013 home to 30 million people \u2013 which is sinking due to unregulated groundwater extraction and prone to widespread flooding and congestion.\n\nThe logic of the plan, first mooted nearly 70 years ago, is also to escape Java\u2019s earthquake risk and copy the good management of Seoul, the greenness of Singapore and Washington\u2019s separation of administration from business.\n\nIf parliament approves the project, approximately 1.5 million people will move to the new capital in East Kalimantan at an estimated cost of 466 trillion rupiah ($32.7bn). A new government framework is expected to be set up on site by 2024 when the president finishes his second and final term in office. Jakarta will continue to be a commercial and financial centre, and the majority of its nearly 10 million residents are likely to stay.\n\nBut the proposed move is already causing concern amongst local residents in East Kalimantan including Sugio\u2019s niece, Wiwit. \u201cI saw the announcement about the new capital on TV and I was so shocked,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat will become of people like us? If they bulldoze our homes to build a new capital, where will we go?\u201d\n\nSugio and his family were resettled in East Kalimantan as part of former president Suharto\u2019s transmigration program in the 1970s. In an effort to encourage residents to move from densely populated areas to less crowded parts of the country, families were relocated from Java to other locations across the archipelago including Kalimantan. Sugio made the move from Banyuwangi in East Java in 1977. The government gave each family of parcel of land measuring one hectare and Wiwit points out the absurdity of the government now taking back this land to make room for the new capital. \u201cThis is our home,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is my birthplace. We have brought up our children and grandchildren here. We don\u2019t want to leave and we will fight if we have to.\u201d\n\nAsked if there were any possible positive aspects to the proposed relocation of the capital, Wiwit, who owns a small stall selling mixed rice dishes, said that she will open a larger restaurant to help feed the new government workers who will move to East Kalimantan from Jakarta.\n\nOther residents also have concerns about the move. Jubaen, 53, is the cultural chief of Pemaluan, a village inside the planned capital zone, and a member of the indigenous Paser Balik tribe. \u201cIn town people will kill their best friends, but here we have a strong sense of community. If we have to move, all of that will be lost,\u201d he said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jubaen, cultural chief of Pemaluan, a village in the development zone, fears the loss of community feeling. Photograph: Aisyah Llewellyn/The Guardian\n\nJubaen says he witnessed the destruction of surrounding areas by logging and mining companies firsthand over the years, and fear that the new capital will make things even worse. \u201cWhen I was younger we could go into the nearby forest and collect honey and fruit, but then the area was taken over by ITCI,\u201d said Jubaen.\n\nITCI, or the International Timber Corporation, is a logging company owned by Hashim Djojohadikusumo, the brother of former presidential hopeful Prabowo Subianto who was defeated by Jokowi in the election in April 2019. Much of the land in the new capital zone is owned by coal mines, palm oil plantations and logging companies. These companies are expected to profit by selling their land back to the government to make way for the new capital.\n\nExperts have warned that the new capital is an environmental crisis waiting to happen. Bernaulus Saragih, a lecturer in the forestry department at Mulawarman University in Samarinda, East Kalimantan, tells the Guardian the effect on the environment will be massive. \u201cThere will be changes in the water systems and environmental drainage, as well as forest encroachment.\u201d\n\nHe said forests in the region are home to endangered orangutans that and Balikpapan Bay, which will become the local port, is a habitat for endangered dugong.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Current resident Wiwit was shocked at the announcement, but says that one positive aspect is the possibility of expanding her business. Photograph: Aisyah Llewellyn/The Guardian\n\nThe government has pledged there will be no building in protected forest and says it plans to reforest abandoned mines and illegal palm oil plantations.\n\nThis week planning minister Brodjonegoro floated the idea of an orangutan conservation centre similar to one for giant pandas in the Chinese city of Chengdu. The Guardian contacted the Indonesian government for comment, but did not get a response.\n\nConservationists remain unconvinced that there would be no spillover effects from moving the capital.\n\nLike many other residents, Yustinus Sapto, a local environmental researcher and activist based in Samarinda, is critical of the proposed move, pointing out that the region needs to fix its environmental problems caused by mining and logging companies first.\n\nJakarta at 30 million: my city is choking and sinking \u2013 it needs a new Plan B Read more\n\n\u201cMost of East Kalimantan\u2019s orangutans are in rehabilitation centres now,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are meant to live in the forest canopy, but due to logging and other environmental damage, the trees are now further apart and they can\u2019t swing from one to another.\u201d\n\nAs a result, the orangutans have to descend to the forest floor leaving them vulnerable to predators and where they grow weak from lack of exercise, he says. In recent years this has caused problems for rehabilitation centres that aim to release injured animals back into the wild once they have been rehabilitated, but increasingly struggle to find safe places to do so.\n\n\u201cWe need to preserve and restore the ecosystem in East Kalimantan,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you ask an environmental expert how to do that, their answer will be that it\u2019s easy. Just rip up all the buildings and let it return to nature \u2013 the opposite of building a new capital.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn East Kalimantan we\u2019re not scared of things like terrorism, \u201c he adds. \u201cWe\u2019re scared of cement.\u201d\n\nFollow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "Plan formally announced in August will see 1.5 million people move to new capital, but residents and conservationists have expressed deep concerns", "authors": ["Aisyah Llewellyn In East Kalimantan"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81c47ac2f179409bcc844726544baf2c5722f0ed/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=beb74e05a748be611e245b8a9bb10afc", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
