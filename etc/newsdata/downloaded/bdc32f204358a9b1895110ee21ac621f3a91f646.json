It\u2019s Duskull!\n\nDuskull Details\n\nType: Ghost\n\nAverage Height: 2' 07\"\n\nAverage Weight: 15kg.\n\nFirst Added In Generation III\n\nDuskull is a small ghost Pok\u00e9mon creature who is said to grab up disobedient children. Parents use this story to scare their kids and make them behave. But the stories of Duskull are based on true facts. According to Pok\u00e9dex entries listed on Bulbapedia, Duskull loves the sound of crying children. I\u2019m not exaggerating. This is the actual text from multiple Poked\u00e9x entries from multiple games. It not only loves the sound of crying children, but it will even try to make children cry using their powers.\n\nDuskull can actually turn invisible and pass through thick walls, which is useful when you are trying to hunt down children. It is said that Duskull will even phase through walls to scare children, just to hear them cry. Duskull seems like an arsehole, honestly.\n\nIf you become Duskull\u2019s target, it will hunt you all night long. Pok\u00e9dex entries make this very clear. Duskull will not stop hunting their victims until either they catch their target or the sun comes up. What will Duskull do once it catches you? I\u2019m not sure. Nothing good, I assume. Regardless, I think a bunch of kids in the Pokemon universe are going to be on their best behaviour after hearing about Duskull, the ghost who loves crying kids.\n\nFavourite Fan Art\n\nEven though Duskull is a creepy ghost that loves making kids cry, that doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t also be cute. They have a nice little pumpkin too. Awww... I guess Duskull isn\u2019t so bad...\n\nRandom Facts\n\nDuskull is usually found in floating around, alone, in the dark woods.\n\nFor some reason, Duskull only has one eye. Which means that isn\u2019t their skull they are wearing.\n\nIt is said that if Duskull glares at a person with its creepy red-eye, it can make that person freeze in terror.\n\nBest Comment From Last Week\n\nA few years ago I caught a shiny Gourgeist on Halloween night while in the emergency room wearing a pirate outfit. My friend cut her thumb and needed stitches, and I had to sit there for 5 hours. It was actually the most boring Halloween I ever experienced. -Anotherburnerboy\n\nHospitals are maybe the most boring places on Earth. If you are there for medical reasons or someone you know is in a bad condition, it might not feel boring. But just sitting around a hospital for minor reasons is like hanging out in a black hole that sucks all time and fun into it. So you sound like a great friend for staying there on Halloween night. (And you were smart to bring something to play to kill the time.)", "description": "Every Pok\u00e9mon is interesting and worth talking about.
