Yet what repulses us isn\u2019t the fact that in this city children as young as three are forced to live in such squalor; it\u2019s the sight of a child defecating by the roadside.\n\nIn this city, two and a half people live in a mansion and are tended to by a half-dozen servants, who live cramped in a tent outside. High unemployment means that labor is cheap: The price of dinner for two at a local French cafe is the monthly wage of a nanny or an round-the-clock security guard.\n\nThose who preach resilience and civic responsibility are often the people who have built themselves little fortresses that are city-proof. The lack of civic amenities affects them very little; in fact, they are the ones responsible for the lack of civic amenities.\n\nMy street is full of politicians and bureaucrats who spend their lives going through the revolving door of power. As soon as there is an electrical outage in the neighborhood, a thousand generators fire up \u2014 the rumble reminds me of that sequence in \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d when formations of helicopters suddenly appear on the screen ready to bomb a serene village. In my neighborhood, it could be raining fire outside, but the air-conditioners will keep our living rooms at a steady 18 degrees Celsius (about 64 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\nDespite our love for air-conditioners and our two-maids-per-child compulsions, we know about climate change : We are trying to ban plastic bags. We just haven\u2019t bothered to think of an alternative for the millions of working people who get their tea or their lunch delivered in one.\n\nIt\u2019s increasingly clear that the people who produce the most garbage do little to solve the problem \u2014 other than to poorly pay their servants to throw the trash far enough away that they can\u2019t smell it. For them, the shopping mall built on reclaimed stretches of the Arabian Sea is not the problem; the 3-year-old defecating in public across the road is. These are people who can\u2019t tell the difference between garbage and hard-working people. Some people have to pick trash to make a living, and they are then treated like trash.\n\nThrough Karachi\u2019s affluent neighborhoods, young boys walk with a bag as large as themselves slung over their shoulders. The more enterprising ones have two bags slung over a bicycle. They go through the garbage we\u2019ve dumped, picking out plastic, empty glass bottles of smuggled Scotch whisky, squashed tins of Heineken, cardboard boxes of pizza, discarded household implements \u2014 anything that can be recycled, anything that can be sold. By evening, with their bags full, they make about 200 rupees (less than $1.30), just enough for two meals or, for some of them, a daily fix. I haven\u2019t seen more hardworking drug addicts in my life.", "description": "And other tales of pollution in Karachi.", "authors": ["Mohammed Hanif"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/27/opinion/27Hanif-03/27Hanif-03-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
