He played in four World Cups, captained his country five times and dazzled spectators on many more occasions with his marauding runs down the wing.\n\nThe 33-year-old danger man called time on his international career Thursday.\n\n\"I believe it's time to sign off and let someone else fill that jersey and live that dream,\" he said in a social media posting. \"Thank you Canada.\"\n\nVan der Merwe scored many highlight-reel tries but the best may have come at the 2015 World Cup when he combined with Ciaran Hearn for a spectacular score against Italy that saw the winger fend off a string of would-be tacklers deep in the Canadian end after an Italy kickoff.\n\nDTH Van Der Merwe scores against the U.S. in a World Cup qualifier in June. (Michael P. Hall/Canadian Press)\n\nVan der Merwe had seen the Italians were narrow on their kickoff chase and told then-coach Kieran Crowley about the possibilities down the flank. Then he executed the vision.\n\nIt speaks volumes that while van der Merwe calls it his favourite try, he remembers the result more \u2014 Italy rallied to win 23-18.\n\n\"If I think of a favourite time, it's got to have to do something to with my whole team and not just my own personal accolades,\" he said.\n\nHe points to Canada's 25-20 victory over Tonga at the 2011 World Cup as a career highlight. \"Something so so special,\" he said.\n\nIt was his only win in four trips to the tournament.\n\nCanada's recent World Cup campaign in Japan was cut short as Typhoon Hagibis forced the cancellation of its final group game against Namibia on Oct. 13.\n\nVan der Merwe acknowledges that the cancellation prompted him to \u2014 briefly \u2014 rethink his retirement plans. \"Is this really the way I wanted it to end?\" he thought.\n\nHe came to the conclusion that not everyone gets to write a fairy-tale ending to their career. \"This is just the way mine was supposed to end,\" he said.\n\nHe was hoping to join a select band of players who have scored in four World Cups. But Canada registered just two tries in heavy losses to Italy, New Zealand and South Africa.\n\nVan der Merwe will continue to play club rugby. He has one year left on his contract with the Glasgow Warriors and says he will look to keep playing after the season.\n\nHe is due to report back Monday to Glasgow, where he holds the club record for tries with 55 in 115 appearances.\n\n\"A top-class player, a top-class finisher,\" said Canada coach Kingsley Jones.\n\n'Hell of a career'\n\n\"Hell of a career ... would have loved to play alongside of you for Canada,\" said former Canada captain Al Charron, a member of the World Rugby Hall of Fame.\n\n\"In my opinion you are the GOAT for Canadian rugby alongside the likes of Gareth (Rees), Ro Hindson & Gord MacKinnon.\"\n\nNow in his second stint with Glasgow, van der Merwe has also played for Saracens and Newcastle Falcons in England and the Scarlets in Wales.\n\nVan der Merwe was born and raised in Worcester, South Africa. His father, a doctor, brought his family of five to Saskatchewan for a better future.\n\nAfter satisfying rugby's residency requirements, van der Merwe made his debut for Canada against Barbados in June 2006.\n\nFive of his tries for Canada came at the repechage tournament last November in France when he helped the national side qualify for the World Cup with wins over Kenya, Germany and Hong Kong.\n\n\"That was tough times,\" he recalled. \"Probably the darkest time of my career. It was just a matter of fact of where we are as a Canadian program. And then just the pressures of knowing that that's the last straw. If we don't qualify, what happens to this program? What happens to the youngsters? What happen to the grassroots levels in Canada?\"\n\n\"It was a tough time in my career. I'm glad it's over. I'm glad we came out on top and I was able to play another World Cup,\" he added.\n\nHe sees the two-year-old Major League Rugby, the North American pro circuit, as a plus for Canadian rugby in the future. But he says the country needs more teams than just the Toronto Arrows.\n\nHe also believes the recently reinstated Pacific Pride program, with former star forward Jamie Cudmore helping develop young talent, \"will be huge for us.\"\n\n\"Home will always be Canada. We'll always come back when we're done with rugby,\" said van der Merwe, who sees the West Coast as his post-rugby destination for his wife and three kids.\n\nWill coach part-time\n\nHe plans to start coaching part-time with GHA, a local Glasgow club, this season to see if he likes it.\n\nBorn April 28, he shares his birthday and name \u2014 Daniel Tailliferre Hauman \u2014 with his father. His dad was called DTH until university but became Danny when he became a doctor.\n\n\"I step away with many fond memories on and off the field,\" he wrote in his farewell posting. \"Travelling the world, meeting new people, embracing different cultures are just some of the many blessing of playing this beautiful game.\"\n\nVan der Merwe went on to thank his Canadian teammates for \"all the awesome memories.\"\n\n\"I can truly say that in 13 years I only had great teammates,\" he said. \"Guys I would do anything for.\"\n\nHe also thanked the Canadian fans, his family and wife Gill.", "description": "DTH van der Merwe, Canada's all-time leading try-scorer, is retiring from international rugby in the wake of his fourth World Cup.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5324923.1571339671!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/rgu-van-der-merwe-20191017.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
