REUTERS/Simon Dawson\n\nLloyd\u2019s, which is made up of 99 syndicate members and focuses on large commercial insurance, has suffered two years of steep losses due to natural catastrophes and is facing uncertainty due to Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union.\n\nIt has been moving slowly to process some of its trades online, but much business is still done face-to-face in Lloyd\u2019s City of London tower.\n\nSimplifying and automating its processes could cut the cost of doing business at Lloyd\u2019s to 25-30% of premium revenue, compared with a current 40%, it said.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to take a step in the right direction,\u201d Lloyd\u2019s chief executive John Neal told Reuters, adding that initial estimates for the costs of the changes were in the \u201clow hundreds of millions\u201d of pounds.\n\nOne of the new electronic exchanges will focus on simpler risks and the other on more complex risks, with \u201cearly builds\u201d of both in place by December 2020, Lloyd\u2019s said. Improved technology will be rolled out in 2021 and 202.\n\nLloyd\u2019s said that to pay for the changes it could use surplus funds, raise senior debt or securitise business against future income flows, but would not increase the levy it charges members.\n\nIn an attempt to compete with centres such as Bermuda, Lloyd\u2019s is also looking to attract participants offering insurance-linked securities such as catastrophe bonds.\n\nIt is also offering syndicates the ability to set up without a physical presence at Lloyd\u2019s.\n\nLloyd\u2019s said on Monday that reinsurance group Munich Re (MUVGn.DE), which already has a presence at Lloyd\u2019s, was setting up the first remote \u201csyndicate-in-a-box\u201d which will focus on newer areas such as renewable energy.\n\nLloyd\u2019s is also pushing its members to improve their underwriting performance, and Neal told an event to launch the detailed strategy that the market expects a combined ratio below 100% for 2019, which indicates an underwriting profit.\n\nSome brokers and smaller insurers, which have already undergone years of tough competition, fear there will be no place for them in the new-look Lloyd\u2019s.\n\n\u201cEfficiency must not replace advocacy,\u201d said Simon Matson, CEO of broker Gallagher UK.\n\n\u201cOur role as brokers has been, and always will be, as the advocate for the customer.\u201d\n\nFILE PHOTO: Signage is seen inside the Lloyd's of London building in the City of London financial district in London, Britain, April 16, 2019.
