If you are looking at the fine she got it was a quarter of what she got away with. No justice was done.\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\n'I imagine she will be paying back a pound a week, we were never asking for that money back anyway.\n\n'She's got away with some of that money as well whether she's got it or spent it I wouldn't know.'\n\nHe said he had seen Mr Mahone for a drink a fortnight ago and he was 'doing OK.'\n\nAt the home in Cleator Moor, Cumbria, he once shared with Doran, Mr Mahone's mother said that he did not wish to comment.\n\nIn a victim personal statement he described how his trust in women has been shattered.\n\nThe nuclear process worker at Sellafield said: ' 'I felt so let down. I trusted her and was getting ready to settle down and spend the rest of my life with her.\n\n'I loved her at the time and I have not been able to move on because I cannot trust anyone else in the way I trusted Rachel.\n\n'I am trying to move on but I find it difficult to talk to women because I am scared of getting hurt.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n'My friends are gutted, they don't want the money back, they just want justice done. My friends could have turned on me but they didn't.\n\n'I don't want to see Rachel again I just want some closure. Maybe when she has been sentenced I will regain some of my confidence and kickstart my life again.\n\n'I want Rachel to learn from what she has done.'\n\nDoran's barrister Kim Whittlestone told the court that she had begun a new relationship.\n\nShe said: 'She has started building bridges. She has commenced a new relationship and is now in employment at a local factory who are aware of theoffending behaviour earning \u00a319 a week.\n\n'She lives with her new partner in privately rented accommodation'\n\nMs Whittlestone said that her family had 'effectively washed their hands of her' after her deceit came to light. Doran had ended up in a hostel, she said, where she'd made an attempt to commit suicide.\n\n(Image: MDM)\n\nThe continuing rift was confirmed by her father Joseph today.\n\nHe told Mailonline: 'I've jacked her off, I don't see her, I don't know who she's with or anything else.'\n\nJudge Nicholas Barker told Doran: 'You still have difficulty understanding where the truth lies.'\n\nHe sentenced her to the suspended sentence and ordered she compensation of \u00a33,600 at a rate of \u00a3150 a month which he said should be split equally between the stag party.\n\nHe also ordered that she do 20 rehabilitation activity days and 240 hours unpaid work to fill up her time when she was not at work.", "description": "Rachel Doran, 32, swindled her ex Chris Mahone and his friends out of the cash - leaving them stranded at Leeds Bradford airport as they prepared to fly to Ibiza", "authors": ["Kevin Donald", "Image", "Facebook", "Mdm", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20750857.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Bride-vanishes-with-\u00a311000-of-stag-party-cash.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
