Meyers said the president was \u201clike a stepdad who just scored backstage passes to Hootie and the Blowfish\u201d.\n\nSeth Meyers: 'That's what Trump does, he betrays everybody' Read more\n\nThe tweet was referring to the killing of Baghdadi and Meyers said Trump couldn\u2019t stop himself from making it \u201csuper weird\u201d during the rambling press conference afterwards. During the performance, Trump noted the great quality of the footage he was watching during the mission, comparing it to a movie. \u201cHonestly, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if, to keep him busy while they carried out the mission, they made him watch an actual movie,\u201d he said.\n\nMeyers also joked that Trump was \u201cstill 50/50 on whether navy Seals are actual seals\u201d.\n\nTrump claimed he didn\u2019t tell Nancy Pelosi about it before it happened because he didn\u2019t want to risk a leak. \u201cIt seems weird to criticise Pelosi for leaks since every time your lawyer farts, he FaceTimes CNN,\u201d Meyers joked.\n\nTrevor Noah\n\nThe Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) Trump announces the killing of ISIS leader al-Baghdadi, then manages to turn the whole thing into a dick-measuring contest with Obama. pic.twitter.com/aWdgnkjyEx\n\nOn The Daily Show, Trevor Noah mentioned that Baghdadi was killed because his courier had tipped off the Americans over his whereabouts, which he said was \u201ca great reminder to always tip your delivery guy\u201d.\n\nNoah played a montage of Trump\u2019s press conference, claiming that, rather than a president, \u201che sounds like a dude on the local news who just saw some shit\u201d.\n\nTrump also used the occasion to downplay the killing of Osama bin Laden and, in turn, Barack Obama. \u201cTrump is the only person who can turn a unifying occasion into a dick-measuring contest,\u201d he said.\n\nNoah added: \u201cThe whole conversation is ridiculous.\u201d\n\nStephen Colbert\n\nOn The Late Show, Stephen Colbert also spoke about Baghdadi: \u201cI would also like to congratulate President Donald J Trump but he just makes it so damn hard.\u201d\n\nHe also played footage from Trump\u2019s incoherent 50-minute press conference and focused on a clip in which Trump claims that the killing of Bin Laden wasn\u2019t a big deal in comparison. \u201cYou know how I know that killing Bin Laden was a big deal?\u201d Colbert said. \u201cBecause Barack Obama never had to say that killing Bin Laden was a big deal.\u201d\n\nTrump claimed that killing Baghdadi was like killing a dog, which led Colbert to joke: \u201cWe did the humane thing: we gave him a suicide vest and chased him down a tunnel.\u201d\n\nThe US also received help from the Syrian Kurds despite Trump recently putting an end to any assistance at the Syrian-Turkish border. \u201cThat is truly going above and beyond,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cIt\u2019s like your ex volunteering to help move your waterbed after you cheated on her and forced her to fight the Turkish army alone.\u201d\n\nJimmy Kimmel\n\nOn Jimmy Kimmel Live! the host started by covering Trump getting booed at a World Series game in Washington DC. \u201cUsually to get booed that much at a game in Washington DC, you have to play for the Redskins,\u201d he quipped. \u201cI guess the orange skins count, too.\u201d\n\nKimmel showed footage of Trump\u2019s crestfallen face and joked: \u201cYou know he\u2019s gonna be throwing himself a big rally in Alabama after that to make him feel great again.\u201d\n\nHe also referred to Trump\u2019s cryptic weekend tweet, joking that people might have thought it meant Kid Rock had been named secretary of state.\n\nHe then spoke about Trump saying that Baghdadi had died like a dog. \u201cWhat does that even mean? He accidentally ate one of those giant-sized Hershey bars?\u201d", "description": "Late-night hosts discussed Trump\u2019s rambling reaction to the death of the Isis leader and the crowd\u2019s reaction to his appearance at a World Series game", "authors": ["Guardian Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f165de65a71a6c3489e7e37c3a04ecf38a9749e/39_0_1458_875/master/1458.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9176281ebcb5ee63ef7ca5b4829e574f", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
