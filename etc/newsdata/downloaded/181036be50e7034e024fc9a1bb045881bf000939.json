(Picture: Getty Images)\n\nEd Sheeran\u2019s team doesn\u2019t want to \u2018overkill\u2019 the singer \u2013 but we don\u2019t think they\u2019ve done that just yet.\n\nThe star was recently named Britain\u2019s richest celebrity under 30, months after it was revealed he was well on his way to becoming a billionaire.\n\nBut it seems his manager, Stuart Camp, is well aware that people may become \u2018sick\u2019 of the Castle On The Hill hitmaker \u2013 despite his success.\n\nWhen chatting on BBC Music Introducing podcast Does My Music Suck? he spoke about his concerns surrounding the 28-year-old\u2019s fame.\n\nHis team are mindful of \u2018overkill\u2019 (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nHe told listeners: \u2018I never want anyone to be bored of him. But I guess if he\u2019s top of the charts then they\u2019re possibly not.\n\n\u2018You just want to make sure that\u2019s a fair representation.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe music mogul added: \u2018We\u2019re very conscious of not doing overkill. Bizarrely, we\u2019ve been doing it for 10 years where we really have overkilled, but no one seems to be sick of it.\n\n\u2018We are very conscious of too much Ed Sheeran.\u2019\n\nAs if there can ever be such a thing?\n\nEd has topped the charts on a number of occasions, with his single Shape Of You becoming Spotify\u2019s most-streamed track to date.\n\nHe was recently named the richest celeb under 30 (Picture: Getty Images )\n\nBut it seems as though he\u2019s about to take a back seat when it comes to hitting the road, as Stuart recently revealed the singer would be taking a break from touring.\n\nHe said: \u2018[Ed] won\u2019t sit still for long. He\u2019s not the holiday sort. But things may change \u2013 he could have a young family relatively soon.\u2019\n\nAnd the star seemingly confirmed this when he said during his last show: \u2018As you may or not know, I\u2019ve been on the Divide tour for over two years now and this is the last day of the whole thing.\n\n\u2018There is something very bittersweet about it. I love that you guys are here and we are ending it in Ipswich. This is my last gig for probably 18 months.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It\u2019s been an emotional day for a lot of people backstage. It kind of feels like, in a weird way, that you\u2019re breaking up with a girlfriend that you\u2019ve been with for years. It sounds odd but it has been a long tour.\u2019\n\nHowever, his hiatus lasted all of two minutes, as he has since made a surprise appearance at Khalid\u2019s London gig \u2013 where they performed Beautiful People.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
