The chance to challenge Bayern Munich's utter dominance of German football might also appeal to the famously combative manager.\n\nBild report that Mourinho is Dortmund's No 1 choice to take over from Lucien Favre, whose side have made an inconsistent start to the season having been proclaimed by some to be favourites to win the Bundesliga ahead of the mighty Bayern.\n\nMourinho has already been in communication with Hans-Joachim Watzke, the Dortmund chief executive, but Bild also suggest that former RB Leipzig boss Ralf Rangnick could be in the frame for the job.\n\nIt is thought that Mourinho would need to take a huge drop in salary compared with his reported \u00a324million-a-year wages at United.\n\nMourinho has been enjoying life as a pundit but is keen to return to football management\n\nAt Dortmund he would work with the likes of Julian Brandt, Jadon Sancho and Achraf Hakimi\n\nFavre's future isn't in immediate jeopardy at Dortmund but the club are assessing their options as they plan a way to challenge Bayern over the longer term.\n\nDortmund are fourth in the Bundesliga after eight games, having won four and drawn three. Favre's side have only lost once in the league so far.\n\nThey currently top this year's Champions League 'group of death' ahead of Barcelona and Inter Milan. They take on Antonio Conte's Inter at the San Siro on Wednesday night.", "description": "Jose Mourinho is being lined up by Borussia Dortmund to take over as their new manager, and the club are in 'regular contact' with him, according to reports in Germany.", "authors": ["Tom Farmery For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/08/20072560-0-image-a-7_1571815987261.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
