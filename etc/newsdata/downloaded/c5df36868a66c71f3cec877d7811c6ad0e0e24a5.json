One Guardian Australia staffer asks another to explain what it means \u2026 quickly\n\nWho is Caroline Calloway, and why can't the internet stop talking about her?\n\nHi Alyx. Who is Caroline Calloway, and why could no one stop talking about her at the pub last night?\n\nCaroline Calloway is the subject of an intense, emotionally complex long read in New York Magazine\u2019s the Cut. It was written by her former close friend and ghostwriter Natalie Beach, and now the internet can\u2019t stop talking about her \u2013 largely because Calloway herself can\u2019t stop talking about the article.\n\nTwitter has blown up. The Reddit thread about the story has 4,000 comments and counting. People are saying they\u2019re going to take the day off to watch the drama unfold.\n\n\u2728 aisling \ud83c\udf08 (@aislingd19) I was starting to think the Natalie/Caroline Calloway article was a myth omg EVERYONE STAY CALM IT'S HERE!!!!!!! https://t.co/2BPkQQ6uAT\n\nVirginia (@virginiabergs) I cannot believe Caroline Calloway is still going. When will this end. I want my life back.\n\nThe reason for the obsession isn\u2019t just the piece itself, which is a complex, knotty look at toxic female friendship, class difference and mental illness.\n\nCalloway has 780,000-plus Instagram followers. As soon as she received an email from Beach forewarning her that the article was coming, she started writing about the piece on her Instagram feed and on her stories, and sharing screenshots of private conversations. She built a huge amount of hype for the story before it came out, teetering between magnanimity and hysteria.\n\nSince the story dropped, Calloway has been taking to Instagram to obsessively posting about the article and her relationship with the writer, rewriting the history of her own Instagram feed to edit Beach into the narrative.\n\ngreat ratsby (@jayratsbynyc) caroline calloway - \u201ci don\u2019t have a lot of memories from the four years i was increasingly addicted to adderall\u201d\n\nalso caroline calloway - *currently in depth detailing who wrote exactly what for all 600+ of her instagram posts since 2013* pic.twitter.com/XIAQksX6K3\n\nWhy have I heard this name before?\n\nCalloway has been bubbling in and out of mainstream consciousness for several years. She blew up in 2015 as an early Instagram influencer who signed a six-figure book deal. Then in January she was at the centre of a Fyre festival-style meltdown, when her $165-a-ticket \u201ccreativity workshops\u201d turned out to be a disappointing shambles for her fans. She accidentally ordered too many mason jars (1,200 of them!); she promised attendees home-cooked lunch but allegedly delivered soggy eggplant on Wholefoods spinach salads. At one point, while pinning orchids into attendees\u2019 hair, she whispered: \u201cThe secret to flower crowns is there is no secret.\u201d The whole disaster was documented in real time via Instagram stories by both Calloway and her customers. Although her apologies have been complicated, Calloway did refund many customers who purchased tickets for the events.\n\nFrom Fyre festival to Hustlers: why are we so obsessed with scammers? Read more\n\nTwo weeks ago she wrote a widely shared piece for Refinery 29 titled What Taylor Swift\u2019s Lover taught me about being a scammer, which included the truly superb line, \u201cScamming is my brand right now, but it\u2019s a narrative I would like to be excluded from.\u201d\n\nSo tell me about this New York Magazine piece?\n\nFirst of all, clear your schedule, because it\u2019ll take you 30 minutes to read the whole thing properly. It chronicles seven years of intermittent codependency between Beach and Calloway.\n\nThe pair met at college. Calloway was rich and pretty and exciting, and Beach was a poor student working odd jobs and struggling with self-image. The class difference between Beach and Calloway is central to the piece. Calloway led a glamorous life filled with international travel and nights out with aristocrats. She frequently brought Beach along for the ride, even though Beach says she couldn\u2019t afford to keep up.\n\nBeach claims she was sometimes financially dependent on Calloway, working as her ghostwriter in exchange for a plane ticket, cash and, at one stage, accommodation. This was a problem because Calloway, according to Beach, was incredibly unreliable. At one point in Beach\u2019s story, she yanks Beach\u2019s housing for the summer out from under her, leaving her basically homeless. Calloway confirmed the story to a fact-checker at New York Magazine.\n\nOn top of the messy monetary entanglements, Beach also resents Calloway, even as she\u2019s crafting a perfect image of Calloway\u2019s life through ghostwritten Instagram captions and, later, a book proposal.\n\n\n\nEj Dickson (@ejdickson) If you can\u2019t identify the Caroline Calloway in all of your female friendships, then you are the Caroline Calloway\n\nMolly Lambert \ud83e\udd94 (@mollylambert) Caroline Calloway is Elena Ferrante\n\nThere\u2019s a mental health element to it that seems to be making some people uneasy. What are the ethics here?\n\nCalloway has been open about her addiction to Adderall. In the piece Beach describes Calloway\u2019s bouts of depression, where she wouldn\u2019t get out of bed, change her clothes or shower for days. Beach does not paint a portrait of a well woman. Though Calloway says she no longer abuses Adderall, the way she documents herself on Instagram makes her seem like a person in a state of perpetual meltdown. A lot of people are understandably uncomfortable grabbing the popcorn and watching that unfold.\n\nTRUST ME, I'M A PUBLIC FIGURE (@vblackburnmusic) I've many thoughts on the Caroline Calloway ish but I'll start here:\n\n\n\ny'all are publicly saying some truly brutal things to/about someone who's been openly recovering from drug abuse + mental health problems. yesterday it was trending...right alongside #WorldSuicidePreventionDay\n\nAlyssa Rhoney (@pho_lyssa) I\u2019ve never been one of Caroline Calloway\u2019s fans, but I gotta be honest, I think the way she\u2019s being crucified is actually kind of disgusting. She very clearly struggles with mental illness, which is not in her control. She has also already been publicly shamed plenty. (1/7)\n\nYet, Calloway also wields power and influence. She profits from the attention \u2013 a minefield in itself. Now Beach will profit from that attention too.\n\nIt\u2019s important to read Beach\u2019s piece in the context of Calloway\u2019s own documentation of her life \u2013 many of the uglier facts of the story aren\u2019t news to Calloway\u2019s followers. What\u2019s new is Beach\u2019s perspective.\n\nThis whole saga seems to have monopolised conversations, tabs and Twitter for the last two days \u2013 at least for a certain group of people. What does that say about us?\n\nCaroline Calloway is a hot mess. But she\u2019s a hot mess who\u2019s wealthy, young, white and well \u2026 hot. This mines a deep seam in our collective imagination. From Empress Elisabeth to Edie Sedgwick to Cat Marnell, other young white women love stories of girls who are richer and more messed up than they are. We love the darkness of picking whether we\u2019re a Natalie or a Caroline. We love reflecting on the times we\u2019ve switched from one to the other.\n\nPlenty of people don\u2019t have the time or the privilege to get into this nonsense, which Roxane Gay has called \u201ca white girl journey\u201d.\n\nJenna Wortham (@jennydeluxe) we really do live in two americas! ive ... never heard of caroline calloway\n\nKB (@KaraRBrown) Every WOC on my timeline has been bored by that white lady scammer story.\n\n\n\nJust an observation!\n\nNakkiah Lui (@nakkiahlui) Is there anything more complicated and difficult to understand in the entire world then Quantum Physics and friendships between middle/upper middle class white girls who meet doing creative writing class together at an east coast college? #carolinecalloway\n\nBut, speaking personally, as someone whose life looks just enough like Calloway\u2019s and Beach\u2019s to get into it, this hit my system harder than a triple shot cocomilk latte.", "description": "An essay about an Instagram influencer and an intense female friendship that turned toxic is blowing up online.
