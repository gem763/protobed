His personal life is exactly that - personal. Another example is Alfa Romeo driver Kimi Raikkonen, who has only been spotted once holding his wife Minttu's hand when in his race suit. But then again, he is not called the 'Iceman' for nothing. However, having seen other footage of Raikkonen with his wife and two children, there is a warmth that hints at a very different man off the track.\n\nREAD | Leclerc splits with girlfriend as Ferrari pressure intensifies\n\nOther drivers like Mercedes' Valtteri Bottas show more public affection by kissing his wife, former Olympic swimmer Emilia, after one of his first great qualifying sessions.\n\nA change to the list is Ferrari driver Charles Leclerc, who recently broke up with his girlfriend, Italian model Giada Gianni, who he had been dating since 2015. The couple reportedly broke up quite recently because the star-driver wants to focus on his career. His reason sounds similar to Lewis Hamilton who had broken up with his long-time girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger a few years ago.\n\nIt's clear that these guys take their racing very seriously, but when all is said and done, they are loving partners and family men to these stunning women.\n\nCheck out the video:", "description": "In Formula 1 the main focus is the drivers and their cars, but what about the wives and girlfriends who stand on the sidelines come race day.
