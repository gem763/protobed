Then cause a fuss saying it\u2019s false advertising when there\u2019s less than 80pcs.\"\n\nMeanwhile, others are finding even more ways to save money, with James Dougal saying how he used his points on the KFC Colonel Club app to get the 80-piece bucket for under \u00a31. He said, \"Was even better for me....used my \u00a35 voucher to make it 99p!\"\n\n(Image: HotUKDeals)\n\nBut the popcorn chicken offer isn't the only deal going on at KFC right now, with the chain also announcing an array of other discounts yesterday, including a hot wings bucket with 20 wings for \u00a35.99, two fillet burgers for \u00a36 (usually \u00a37.98), a 12 piece dipping boneless feast for \u00a316 (usually \u00a318.99), and finally, a boneless banquet for \u00a35.49 (usually \u00a36.49).", "description": "Popcorn chicken fans... prepare yourselves, as you can now get an entire 80-piece bucket of the stuff at KFC", "authors": ["Molly Holt", "Image", "Hotukdeals"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20714307.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Screen-Shot-2019-10-24-at-125203.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
