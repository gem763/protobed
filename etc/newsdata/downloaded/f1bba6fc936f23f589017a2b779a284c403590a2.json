You can run the ball more physically up inside . . . and I think it just gives you a totally different dimension,\u201d Callahan said.\n\nAD\n\nCallahan said he has had a fullback on most of his teams, and finds that it adds a dynamic, less predictable element to an offense. The presence of a fullback, he thinks, can lead to more chunk-yardage plays \u2014 something the Redskins haven\u2019t been able to do enough in the last couple years.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI think you do as many things as you can to keep the linebackers at bay, keep them honest and make them bite on the run a little heavier and then open up your passing game and vice versa and you have an opportunity to play hardball every now and then,\u201d Callahan said.\n\nBurton might play a key role in Sunday\u2019s game against San Francisco, especially since running back Chris Thompson missed his second practice this week with a foot injury. Also missing Thursday\u2019s practice was cornerback Josh Norman, who has a thigh injury. Callahan said he hopes Norman might be able to practice on Friday and play on Sunday.\n\nAD\n\nOthers out on Thursday were safety Deshazor Everett (ankle), linebacker Josh Harvey-Clemons (hamstring) and guard Wes Martin (chest). Tight end Vernon Davis, recovering from a concussion, was limited.\n\nMore Redskins coverage:\n\nAD", "description": "Washington added fullback Michael Burton in hopes of adding a dynamic, less predictable element.", "authors": ["Les Carpenter", "Reporter Covering Washington Redskins"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/T-bvuUYHydham9zowg3oTD2Yu5o=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZWEP2IHK4II6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
