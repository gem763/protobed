The Astros are now just one win away from a second World Series title in three years.\n\nThe series was on the line for the Washington Nationals as they ventured into Minute Maid Park for a Game 6 showdown against the Houston Astros.\n\nIt was win or go home time for the Nationals and in the end they did it comfortably, walking away with the 7-2 victory to force Game 7 on Thursday.\n\nBut the game wasn\u2019t without controversy and in the seventh inning things threatened to boil over as fans, commentators and social media erupted.\n\nStream live coverage of the 2019 World Series with ESPN on KAYO.

His swing just collected the ball and dropped it down in front of the pitcher, he took off for first as the throw from pitcher Brad Peacock was made.\n\nPeacock rifled the ball to first base, right into Turner\u2019s path as he touched first base. The ball hit Turner and rolled into foul territory as Houston first baseman Yuli Gurriel lost his glove, and it appeared the Nationals would have men on second and third with none out.\n\nBut that\u2019s when the controversy began.\n\nHome plate umpire Sam Holbrook threw the night\u2019s biggest curveball, calling Turner out for interference and ordering the runner, Yan Gomes, back to first base.\n\nThe Nationals vigorously protested the call, but the play was not reviewable. Replays, however, showed that Turner didn\u2019t interfere at all.\n\nTrea Turner was called out on this play.\n\n\n\n\"That's a potentially series changing call.\" - Joe @Buck pic.twitter.com/E3Po7hSNcR \u2014 FOX Sports: MLB (@MLBONFOX) October 30, 2019\n\nThe call from the umpire didn\u2019t slow down the Nationals as they increased their lead in the inning out to 5-2 courtesy of an Anthony Rendon two-run homer, before going on to win the game.\n\nBut the anger didn\u2019t subside with manager Dave Martinez blowing up at the umpires in the innings and being held back by coaches Chip Hale and Tim Bogar before he was eventually thrown out of the game.\n\nDuring the 7th inning stretch, Nationals Manager Dave Martinez was visibly upset with the umpires and was ejected during the exchange. pic.twitter.com/AZ23MusrNN \u2014 FOX Sports: MLB (@MLBONFOX) October 30, 2019\n\nThe reaction from the commentary team was one of bemusement over the decision to call Turner out, despite footage showing he hadn\u2019t deviated off his path.\n\nFans on social media were just as volatile as Martinez was as they vented over the potentially series-changing call.\n\nBut while many fans took aim at the umpires, Kate Upton, wife of Astros pitcher Justin Verlander, was quick to put the fault back on Turner.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t within the base path. Those who don\u2019t know the rule you HAVE to run inside the 2 lines. Not sure why the review is taking so long... pic.twitter.com/SzUJTA4L70 \u2014 Kate Upton (@KateUpton) October 30, 2019\n\nHer tweet receive a host of backlash from fans and she then took aim at the \u201cmisogynist\u201d comments being thrown her way.\n\nI LOVE talking about sports and reading all of the dumb misogynist comments. It reminds me that women need to keep fighting for equality. It\u2019s 2019 but feels like the 1950s. #feminist \u2014 Kate Upton (@KateUpton) October 30, 2019\n\nOf course that didn\u2019t stop the flood of backlash being slung by the bulk of social media fans who weren\u2019t happy with the umpiring decision.\n\nWhat????? How do you make that call???? He\u2019s literally right on the bag. That\u2019s atrocious. Umps inserting themselves in the game again. \u2014 Ryan Ruocco (@RyanRuocco) October 30, 2019\n\nThat is an absolutely awful call... what are we doin? \u2014 Jake Arrieta (@JArrieta34) October 30, 2019\n\nHow is Trea Turner interfering while stepping ON the first base bag? He was literally on the bag when the glove was dislodged.\n\n\n\nThat was a TERRIBLE call in a massive moment. From 2nd and 3rd with nobody out to 1st and 3rd with 1 out. Good lord. \u2014 Grant Paulsen (@granthpaulsen) October 30, 2019\n\nAfter the game Major League Baseball\u2019s chief officer Joe Torre explained the decisions behind the controversial call.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a 45-foot restraining line where you\u2019re supposed to run as a baserunner, in between those lines,\u201d Torre said.\n\n\u201cHe ran to first base. That wasn\u2019t the call, the call was the fact that he interfered with Gurriel trying to catch the ball. If you notice, the glove came off his hand. That\u2019s when Sam Holbrook called him out for, basically, interference.\u201d\n\nMLB's chief baseball officer, Joe Torre, explains all aspects of Trea Turner's controversial runner interference call to @Ken_Rosenthal. pic.twitter.com/SEJDUuwRB7 \u2014 FOX Sports: MLB (@MLBONFOX) October 30, 2019\n\nThe explanation from Torre however didn\u2019t sit well with fans who quickly directed their anger in his direction.\n\nWOW. Papi, A-Rod and Frank Thomas all agree it was an egregious call, bad judgement, and aren\u2019t satisfied with Torre\u2019s explanation. \u2014 Matt Whitlock (@mattdizwhitlock) October 30, 2019\n\nOh boy, Torre doesn't have a clue... \u2014 Ryan M.
