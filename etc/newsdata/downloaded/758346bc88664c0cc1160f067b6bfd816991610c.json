America should keep their word.\"\n\nMr Trump defended his decision in a series of breathless tweets, writing: \u201cI was elected on getting out of these ridiculous endless wars, where our great Military functions as a policing operation to the benefit of people who don\u2019t even like the USA (sic).\u201d\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham, a top Republican ally of Mr Trump, said Congress could impose economic sanctions on Turkey and threaten its Nato membership if Ankara invaded Syria.", "description": "Donald Trump's allies have turned on the president after he took the decision to green-light an offensive by Turkish on its Kurdish allies in Syria.", "authors": ["Josie Ensor", "Mark Almond", "Charles Moore"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/07/TELEMMGLPICT000212272523-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqD3d2dmOlWYuQkR76XZjLQGgaQVecUj8rxrsgG1lkhqs.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
