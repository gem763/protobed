Though, as some industry watchers have been quick to point out, the label could be applied rather closer to home in the near future, should Brexit comes to pass\u2026\n\nSome parts of the 5G report on risk of non-EU cyberattacks may accidentally gain a new unexpected meaning after #Brexit (https://t.co/o7gyV0hqCv) https://t.co/VgU30kRz4p \u2014 Lukasz Olejnik (@lukOlejnik) October 9, 2019\n\nBack in March, as European telecom industry concern swirled about how to respond to US pressure to block Huawei, the Commission stepped in to issue a series of recommendations \u2014 urging Member States to step up individual and collective attention to mitigate potential security risks as they roll out 5G networks.\n\nToday\u2019s risk assessment report follows on from that.\n\nIt identifies a number of \u201csecurity challenges\u201d that the report suggests are \u201clikely to appear or become more prominent in 5G networks\u201d vs current mobile networks \u2014 linked to the expanded use of software to run 5G networks; and software and apps that will be enabled by and run on the next-gen networks.\n\nThe role of suppliers in building and operating 5G networks is also noted as a security challenge, with the report warning of a \u201cdegree of dependency on individual suppliers\u201d, and also of too many eggs being placed in the basket of a single 5G supplier.\n\nSumming up the effects expected to follow 5G rollouts, per the report, it predicts:\n\nAn increased exposure to attacks and more potential entry points for attackers : With 5G networks increasingly based on software, risks related to major security flaws, such as those deriving from poor software development processes within suppliers are gaining in importance. They could also make it easier for threat actors to maliciously insert backdoors into products and make them harder to detect.\n\n: With 5G networks increasingly based on software, risks related to major security flaws, such as those deriving from poor software development processes within suppliers are gaining in importance. They could also make it easier for threat actors to maliciously insert backdoors into products and make them harder to detect. Due to new characteristics of the 5G network architecture and new functionalities, certain pieces of network equipment or functions are becoming more sensitive , such as base stations or key technical management functions of the networks.\n\n, such as base stations or key technical management functions of the networks. An increased exposure to risks related to the reliance of mobile network operators on suppliers . This will also lead to a higher number of attacks paths that might be exploited by threat actors and increase the potential severity of the impact of such attacks. Among the various potential actors, non-EU States or State-backed are considered as the most serious ones and the most likely to target 5G networks.\n\n.

Among the various potential actors, non-EU States or State-backed are considered as the most serious ones and the most likely to target 5G networks. In this context of increased exposure to attacks facilitated by suppliers, the risk profile of individual suppliers will become particularly important, including the likelihood of the supplier being subject to interference from a non-EU country.\n\nwill become particularly important, including the likelihood of the supplier being subject to interference from a non-EU country. Increased risks from major dependencies on suppliers : a major dependency on a single supplier increases the exposure to a potential supply interruption, resulting for instance from a commercial failure, and its consequences. It also aggravates the potential impact of weaknesses or vulnerabilities, and of their possible exploitation by threat actors, in particular where the dependency concerns a supplier presenting a high degree of risk.\n\n: a major dependency on a single supplier increases the exposure to a potential supply interruption, resulting for instance from a commercial failure, and its consequences. It also aggravates the potential impact of weaknesses or vulnerabilities, and of their possible exploitation by threat actors, in particular where the dependency concerns a supplier presenting a high degree of risk. Threats to availability and integrity of networks will become major security concerns: in addition to confidentiality and privacy threats, with 5G networks expected to become the backbone of many critical IT applications, the integrity and availability of those networks will become major national security concerns and a major security challenge from an EU perspective.\n\nThe high level report is a compilation of Member States\u2019 national risk assessments, working with the Commission and the European Agency for Cybersecurity. It\u2019s couched as just a first step in developing a European response to securing 5G networks.\n\n\u201cIt highlights the elements that are of particular strategic relevance for the EU,\u201d the report says in self-summary. \u201cAs such, it does not aim at presenting an exhaustive analysis of all relevant aspects or types of individual cybersecurity risks related to 5G networks.\u201d\n\nThe next step will be the development, by December 31, of a toolbox of mitigating measures, agreed by the Network and Information Systems Cooperation Group, which will be aimed at addressing identified risks at national and Union level.\n\n\u201cBy 1 October 2020, Member States \u2013 in cooperation with the Commission \u2013 should assess the effects of the Recommendation in order to determine whether there is a need for further action. This assessment should take into account the outcome of the coordinated European risk assessment and of the effectiveness of the measures,\u201d the Commission adds.\n\nFor the toolbox a variety of measures are likely to be considered, per the report \u2014 consisting of existing security requirements for previous generations of mobile networks with \u201ccontingency approaches\u201d that have been defined through standardisation by the mobile telephony standards body, 3GPP, especially for core and access levels of 5G networks.\n\nBut it also warns that \u201cfundamental differences in how 5G operates also means that the current security measures as deployed on 4G networks might not be wholly effective or sufficiently comprehensive to mitigate the identified security risks\u201d, adding that: \u201cFurthermore, the nature and characteristics of some of these risks makes it necessary to determine if they may be addressed through technical measures alone.\n\n\u201cThe assessment of these measures will be undertaken in the subsequent phase of the implementation of the Commission Recommendation. This will lead to the identification of a toolbox of appropriate, effective and proportionate possible risk management measures to mitigate cybersecurity risks identified by Member States within this process.\u201d\n\nThe report concludes with a final line saying that \u201cconsideration should also be given to the development of the European industrial capacity in terms of software development, equipment manufacturing, laboratory testing, conformity evaluation, etc\u201d \u2014 packing an awful lot into a single sentence.\n\nThe implication is that the business of 5G security will need to get commensurately large to scale to meet the multi-dimensional security challenge that goes hand in glove with the next-gen tech. Just banning a single supplier isn\u2019t going to cut it.", "description": "European Union Member States have published a joint risk assessment report into 5G technology which highlights increased security risks that will require a new approach to securing telecoms infrastructure.
