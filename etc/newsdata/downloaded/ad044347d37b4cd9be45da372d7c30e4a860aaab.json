Getty\n\nNo one would ever pretend Javid was a gifted orator.\n\nBut his stilted performance on his first big event was so bad it made his predecessor \u201cSpreadsheet Phil\u201d Hammond look like the charismatic god of numbers by comparison.\n\nThis was Stumbling Saj at his worst.\n\nHe\u2019d been told to let loose the billions and you might have thought that spraying great chunks of other people\u2019s money around would have been a novel and exciting experience for a former banker turned Tory chancellor.\n\nHere\u2019s some billions for education. Here\u2019s some for social care. Here\u2019s some for defence. Veterans, rough sleepers, youth services, we love all of you. You can have some cash too.\n\nYet despite being ordered to cough up that trolley full of sweets, Javid looked for all the world as if he was the bloke in the corner with no mates at the accountants\u2019 annual ball.\n\nIn 20 years of watching these things I can honestly say I have never seen a worse performance. Dismal doesn\u2019t even begin to describe it.\n\nIt took him five minutes or so just to get to the subject of spending. First we had to listen to him saying exactly the same thing as Boris Johnson\u2019s been saying about Brexit, for which read: telling the same lies.\n\nJohn Bercow, the speaker, had to intervene twice to tell him to get on with the business in hand.\n\nHe nonetheless ploughed on with desperate stuff about how awesome the UK economy is when it actuality shrank in the second quarter and is looking more likely to fall into a full-scale Brexit recession courtesy of him and his colleagues by the day.\n\nWhen he finally got around to some actual spending pledges, he drew ironic cheers.\n\nEven they died when the detail finally emerged.\n\nIt was half arsed even as bribes go, just some numbers plucked out of the air in an attempt to show the public that the Tory party has been reshaped in Don Dominic\u2019s image and will now pretend it cares about the little guy as well as Brexit.\n\nExcept it doesn\u2019t. John Appleby, chief economist at the Nuffield Trust, summed it up when he described the spending review as \u201ca missed opportunity to turn around years of cuts to the crucial budgets that support the NHS and the patients who depend on it\u201d. But the criticisms weren\u2019t just about health.\n\nAusterity, John McDonnell correctly stated, was a choice not a necessity and a new chancellor claiming to end it delivered nothing more than a \u201ccompendium of meaningless platitudes\u201d. They will all be under threat in the event of a no-deal Brexit anyway, on which he wasted yet another \u00a32bn.\n\nMcDonnell wasn\u2019t at his best but he didn\u2019t need to be. A half dead rabbit would have looked good by comparison to Javid.\n\nBut perhaps the chancellor\u2019s lack of conviction shouldn\u2019t come as a great surprise. It was noted that he was deprived of a media guru when Don Dominic had his aide Sonia Khan removed from Downing Street by a gun-toting copper. But he didn\u2019t really need one. He is little more than a PR man for his bosses.\n\nHe\u2019d better step up his game as regards to that or he\u2019ll find that he\u2019s next out of the building, perhaps in the gun-toting company of one of the new officers Johnson wants to hire to polish up his law-and-order credentials.", "description": "Today\u2019s spending round was unworthy of the name.
