Coltrane recorded the tracks in 1963. The album is titled \u201cBoth Directions at Once.\u201d\n\nThe name of Coltrane\u2019s work epitomizes what Democrats are trying to do with impeachment right now \u2013 and everything else on Capitol Hill. Go both directions at once.\n\nAfter all, Democrats dove headfirst into the impeachment inquiry surrounding President Trump this week. It became \u201creal.\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., had announced her support for the inquiry nearly a month ago, but Congress soon afterward departed Washington for a weekslong recess in late September.\n\nWhen lawmakers returned to Capitol Hill last Tuesday afternoon, impeachment truly got real. Most members started pouring back into the Capitol after 4 p.m. ET Tuesday. Pelosi conducted a series of leadership meetings. The House began a vote series on the floor at 6:30 p.m., but Democrats scheduled a rare caucus meeting for 6 p.m.\n\nDemocrats usually hold their weekly caucus meeting the next morning - the day after members return to Washington. But, an additional caucus conclave \u2013 especially in the evening \u2013 surely meant something\u2019s up.\n\nReporters also flooded the Capitol last Tuesday afternoon, knowing impeachment was \u201cgetting real\u201d as lawmakers returned to Washington. The House Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs Committees already had run through several days of closed-door interviews with witnesses over the recess, but it was altogether different with all the lawmakers back in town. What had their constituents told them about impeachment? Was this the right thing to do? Were Democrats playing this wrong? Will Republicans break with the president?\n\nPelosi led an afternoon news conference with House Education & Labor Committee Chairman Bobby Scott, D-Va., about college affordability. Naturally, a few reporters peppered Pelosi with questions about impeachment, not tuition costs. One question centered on why the speaker wouldn\u2019t call a vote on the floor to formalize the impeachment probe. Republicans have crowed for days that Democrats weren\u2019t handling impeachment properly without such a vote.\n\nDuring the news conference with Scott, Pelosi suggested she might say something about such a formal vote after meeting with her leadership team and caucus.\n\nThe Capitol buzzed.\n\nBut, when various members of Pelosi\u2019s inner circle left the leadership suite a couple of hours later, nobody seemed sure if the speaker would call a vote.\n\n\u201cIf that\u2019s what she\u2019s planning,\u201d one Democrat said, \u201cShe\u2019s holding her cards really close.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when Pelosi\u2019s staff announced a rare evening news conference. \u201c6:30\u201d was the prospective time, but insiders suggested it would really start closer to 7 p.m. with roll-call votes on the floor and the full caucus huddling. Surely the speaker had a big announcement about impeachment to summon reporters to the House studio at that hour.\n\nRepublicans have demanded a vote for weeks. It wasn\u2019t long ago that they planned to weaponize such a roll-call tally against Democrats representing swing districts. A vote to establish the parameters of the impeachment inquiry by the full House \u2013 which happened in 1974 with President Richard Nixon and in 1998 with President Bill Clinton \u2013 would be different from actually voting to impeach. But, Republicans supposedly thought they could boomerang that vote against the 31 Democrats in districts where Trump had prevailed. Republicans would ask, do those Democrats support an \u201cextreme\u201d idea like impeachment propounded by Pelosi, or are they with the president?\n\nBut, the idea of a vote on the structure of impeachment may have evolved. The Trump administration has been adamant it won\u2019t cooperate with the Democrats\u2019 impeachment investigation without a vote. So, one wondered if Pelosi might take them up on that dare. The administration wouldn\u2019t have a leg to stand on if the House approved such a resolution. President Trump\u2019s defenders in Congress have spent most of their time arguing about the process. They want process? Well, Democrats could well give them \u201cprocess.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m certainly open to that,\u201d said Rep. Dean Phillips, D-Minn., when asked about such a vote. \u201cMost of us are on the record about that already.\u201d\n\nBut, contrary to the thinking a few weeks ago, a vote to set parameters of the inquiry could flip on Republicans. For some House Republicans from Texas, North Carolina, Florida, Nevada and Michigan, a vote for an impeachment inquiry could be problematic. If those swing-district Republicans vote against the inquiry, Democrats may well have weaponized the vote against the GOP. Moreover, if any Republicans vote with the Democrats for \u201can inquiry,\u201d each likely will face a Trump-aligned challenger. That\u2019s to say nothing of drawing the ire of the president himself. If vulnerable Republicans oppose launching the investigation, they could face trouble in the general election.\n\nTRUMP SAYS PELOSI SHOULD INVESTIGATE OBAMA'S SYRIA RED LINE, SCHIFF SHOULD BE 'DEPOSED'\n\nBut, there would be no such vote.\n\nAs reporters waited in the House studio, word filtered in that Pelosi would not call a vote to formalize the impeachment process. But, the speaker would have a special guest at the news conference: House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif.\n\nPelosi\u2019s press event began precisely at 7 p.m. \u2013initially sans Schiff. And, instead of updating reporters on impeachment, Pelosi spoke about a myriad of other subjects: efforts to reduce the cost of prescription drugs, the college tuition legislation, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, firearms, sanctions against Turkey. The speaker barely said anything about impeachment until Schiff arrived.\n\nOnly, it wouldn\u2019t be Pelosi addressing impeachment. Pelosi would yield to Schiff.\n\nWhat happened next was remarkable.\n\nActions speak louder than words. Pelosi then walked off the dais, leaving Schiff at the lectern. Pelosi took a seat in the front row of the Radio/TV Gallery Studio, amid the reporters, to listen to Schiff. All she lacked was a notebook and a tape recorder.\n\nThere are lots of ways to read Pelosi\u2019s decision to defer to Schiff. It was almost to indicate that impeachment was under Schiff\u2019s silo, and his only. Congressional leaders frequently have liked to cede power to their committee chairs \u2013 or, at least, give the illusion of ceding power to committee chairs. Perhaps the speaker was distancing herself from impeachment, or indicating that the House would conduct its impeachment investigation and simultaneously work on other legislation. A skeptic might have viewed Pelosi\u2019s decision to sit in the front row as a way to divorce herself from the impeachment inquiry, or say, \u201cAdam, it\u2019s all on you. Don\u2019t screw this up.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThat\u2019s the narrow path Democrats must now walk \u2013 balancing impeachment with discussions about education, trade, guns and medicine. But, impeachment has seemed to consume nearly every headline, every conversation at the Capitol. It\u2019s unclear how Democrats could slice through the impeachment noise with their other messages. Impeachment could be seen as just too muscular. Perhaps Democrats trod this path at their own peril.\n\nThere\u2019s only one way to walk that course. Or, as John Coltrane might say, go \u201cBoth Directions at Once.\u201d", "description": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi yielded to Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff at a news conference \u2013 and what happened next was remarkable.", "authors": ["Chad Pergram"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/16/694940094001_6095131421001_6095130881001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
