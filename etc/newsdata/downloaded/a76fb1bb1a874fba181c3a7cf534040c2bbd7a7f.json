While the Court has not granted relief each time it has been sought, the government has gotten much of what it wants in high-profile cases such as the \u201ctravel ban,\u201d the transgender military service ban, and the asylum rule. And, as Vladeck pointed out, until last week no one on the Court had even suggested that the government was abusing these procedures.\n\nSotomayor\u2019s dissent breaks the silence. But the majority, and in particular Chief Justice John Roberts, have stayed mum, suggesting to Vladeck that the Court has shifted its view of emergency motions. \u201cThat silence,\u201d Vladeck told me in an interview, \u201cis certainly resonating in the Solicitor General\u2019s office\u201d\u2014meaning that the government may now feel secure in asking the high court to rein in judges below.\n\nOne common response to Vladeck\u2019s statistics is that the Court\u2019s aggressiveness has been spurred by an increase in so-called nationwide injunctions issued by district judges. \u201cThat\u2019s way too easy,\u201d Vladeck said. Although there has been an increase in such injunctions (it began in the Obama years), many emergency stays have been issued in cases where no nationwide injunction is at stake, or in more or less routine disputes over \u201cdiscovery,\u201d the information the government must provide when it is sued. To Vladeck, the real change is that the new conservative majority is willing to in essence decide the cases before they are briefed or argued\u2014to predict that the government will win when the case finally reaches them, and thus should have its way in the interim.\n\nIn the article, Vladeck points out that one of the factors a court must decide is whether either party will suffer \u201cirreparable injury\u201d\u2014either because an injunction is granted, harming the defendants, or denied, harming the plaintiffs. Thus, in a suit against the government, courts must balance the damage to the government caused by the delay of a possibly lawful policy against the harm to plaintiffs caused by being subjected to a possibly unlawful action. Under Trump, the government seems to be suffering all the harm. Vladeck argued that the Court should explain this shift. \u201cIf what\u2019s going on in these cases is that the majority is no longer interested in considering the harm that these policies are\u2014or could be\u2014inflicting while they are in force, it would behoove them to say so,\u201d he told me.\n\nThe government\u2019s use of these procedures smacks of entitlement, of a sense that Republicans went to great trouble to tilt the Court in their favor and should now reap their reward. Similarly, some conservatives have muttered that lower courts are wandering out of their lanes, with one Trump defender attacking anti-administration rulings as \u201cthe judicial resistance.\u201d Indeed, in a surly dissent in the census case last June, Justice Clarence Thomas branded District Judge Jesse Furman, who had ruled against the government at trial, \u201ca judge predisposed to distrust\u201d the administration. Thomas also claimed Furman had \u201ccreate[d] an eye-catching conspiracy web\u201d out of unrelated facts. As judicial conduct used to be measured, it was a shocking breach of protocol. Yet Thomas\u2019s opinion was joined by Trump\u2019s two appointees, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nWhich brings us back to my initial question. What is the Supreme Court today, in 2019? I fear it has taken on the role of enforcing Trump\u2019s will against fellow judges.", "description": "This administration seems to regard \u201cextraordinary relief\u201d from the high court as nothing more than its due.", "authors": ["Garrett Epps", "Professor Of Constitutional Law At The University Of Baltimore"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/AP_18282529819598/facebook.jpg?1568470211", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
