But a digital revolution across corporate America is changing that.\n\nNow, as companies invest billions of dollars to increase their tech capabilities, CIOs are increasingly becoming critical leaders within organizations. Next up could be assuming the role of CEO, says MuleSoft founder Ross Mason.\n\n\"Everything's up for disruption,\" he told Business Insider. Companies \"need someone at the helm that really understands how technology can be leveraged ... to drive a very different outcome.\"\n\nMason is in one of the best positions to know the pipeline of future leaders. As founder of a firm whose platform allows companies to quickly link different applications together, he regularly counsels CEOs and CIOs on their digital overhauls.\n\nMuleSoft was bought by Salesforce in 2018 for $6.5 billion. Since then, the software giant has used MuleSoft's integration tools to roll out industry-specific data platforms, most recently one to give manufacturers greater insight into customer demand.\n\nFirst comes 'being at the table,' then comes running the table\n\nWhile Mason says only a small subset of CIOs could assume the top role now, that will quickly change as organizations throughout industries increasingly make software a more central part of their operations.\n\nTake Walmart, for example, which is spending significantly to upgrade its digital operations. It has an innovation hub in New York where the retailer tries out new, artificial-intelligence-powered technology. And CEO Doug McMillon has even referred to Walmart as a \"technology company\" in presentations.\n\n\"The first step is being at the table, and the second step is actually aligning the strategy of the business and IT strategy together,\" Mason said. \"The third step is 'we are a software company.'\"\n\nPart of the reason why Mason and others think more CIOs will be tapped for the top job more frequently is because their role is quickly expanding and becoming more central to a company's operations.\n\nOver the past few years, the IT department has evolved beyond what Mason refers to as \"order takers,\" or those tasked with making sure laptops work properly and other tech problems are addressed.\n\nNow, the CIO is often in charge of implementing a company's digital revamp, which in many cases is also the top goal of the company as a whole. That responsibility gives them more direct access to top leadership like the board of directors, according to Mason.\n\nAll eyes are on the CIO now\n\nThat sort of visibility is what helps information heads become more vital to the organization, but it still requires buy-in from the top brass of the company.\n\n\"It's a lot easier in today's climate [for CIOs] to get the ear of the CEO and talk about aligning the IT strategy and the business strategy, but it has to come from the CEO,\" he said.\n\nWhen Steve Easterbrook came on as McDonald's CEO in 2015, for example, he outlined four areas of focus, including modernizing in-store technology. And he wanted it done quickly, telling investors that the fast-food chain would have 20,000 locations running its mobile ordering application by the end of 2017.\n\nEach of those goals heavily involved IT, and the job fell to then-CIO Frank Liberio to implement. While it was a daunting task, it also meant he would have a much closer interaction with Easterbrook.\n\n\"Technology needed to go at a speed that it's never gone before,\" Liberio said at a recent MuleSoft conference in New York City. \"I remember [Steve] talking to me saying, 'Frank, I've never not lived up to a commitment to Wall Street, so this is something you have to figure out how to get done.'\"\n\nBy December 2017, Liberio's team achieved the rollout goal.\n\nTo date, it's still rare for IT heads to make the jump to top executive. In one big example, Yvonne Wassenaar went from being CIO of New Relic Inc., a software analytics company, to CEO of drone company Airware. She has since moved on to become CEO of software automation firm Puppet.\n\n\"Ideally, we'll start to see a lot more of that,\" Mason said. \"I think it'll happen.\"", "description": "Digital transformations within companies are empowering CIOs and placing them in more direct contact with top leadership.", "authors": ["Joe Williams"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5ce568150dc33f015a166e13?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
