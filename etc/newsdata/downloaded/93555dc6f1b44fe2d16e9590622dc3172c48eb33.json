Social media can have that effect.\n\nSince the US-led invasion in 2003, Iraqi journalists have usually attributed unrest on the streets to sectarianism \u2013 the divide between primarily Shia and Sunni Muslims. They can not do that this time. Iraqi protesters are demanding an overhaul of the political system.\n\nGiven the scale of the protests, it is little wonder that politicians, the security forces they control and the media outlets they own are closing ranks to protect the status quo.\n\nBut Iraqi protesters, determined to have their movement covered, turn to a comedy programme rather than a news broadcast to tell their story. They sent footage of the deadly security response to the Albasheer Show, a comedy programme hosted by Ahmed Albasheer, which airs on German broadcaster Deutsche Welle\u2019s Arabic service.\n\n\u201cThe Albasheer Show is a platform for the Iraqi people. He is always addressing their concerns and especially at a time when Iraqi channels have been prohibited from showing the reality of Iraq, from showing the protests, his coverage has been crucial,\u201d journalist Azhar al-Rubaie tells Al Jazeera.\n\nAlbasheer airs his criticism in the programme, arguing that the people on the streets need to be heard.\n\nRenad Mansour of the Chatham House Iraq Initiative comments on Albasheer saying: \u201cHis biggest criticism is: where is our media? Why are they showing cartoons? Why are they showing cooking shows?\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cI mean this is probably one of the biggest moments in post-2003 Iraq, and mainstream media isn't really covering it. His point was we don't have a free and fair media, mainstream media in our country.\u201d\n\nAida al-Kaisy, of the London School of Economics\u2019 conflict research programme, explains there are major challenges to producing objective news in Iraq.\n\n\u201cThere is no political will in Iraq for an independent media because what an independent media will do is expose corruption on a grand scale,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cIt'll also give voice to marginalised groups in Iraq who haven't necessarily been given a platform that might call to question the current political system.\u201d\n\nUntil 2003 and the fall of Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi media landscape was barren, consisting of just one TV channel, four radio stations and five newspapers \u2013 all state-controlled. Satellite dishes were illegal.\n\nAs the country transitioned out of the Hussein era, dozens of new broadcast outlets went to air that the US led-coalition authority said would safeguard the country\u2019s new democracy.\n\nAll it took to acquire a licence to broadcast was the money to buy one. But very few Iraqis could afford one. Those who could tended to come with political connections.\n\nA decade and a half later, what has resulted is a new landscape, politically partisan owners and channels more devoted to their owners\u2019 interests than those of the viewer.\n\nBilal Wahab, fellow at The Washington Institute, argues that partisan media outlets designed to cover protests against sectarian political parties could not take a side with these protests and did not know how to handle them.\n\n\u201cThis is the protest of a majority Shia youth against a majority Shia-led government. So they didn't know what to do. So they decided just not to cover it,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cSo, in a way, the system failed. Like, you know, system error.\u201d\n\nContributors:\n\nAida al-Kaisy - senior teaching fellow, SOAS\n\nBilal Wahab - fellow, The Washington Institute\n\nRenad Mansour - research fellow, MENA Programme, Chatham House\n\nAzhar Rubaie - journalist\n\nSource: Al Jazeera News", "description": "Determined to air their views, protesters turn to a comedy programme, not a news broadcast, to tell their story.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/13/66f6f4b2510e4a509d83f6645e9ecb47_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
