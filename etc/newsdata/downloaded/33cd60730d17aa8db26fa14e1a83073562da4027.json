It does not mean we will stay in the EU beyond 31 October. We will leave.\"", "description": "If no deal is agreed by 19 October, Boris Johnson will comply with Benn Act, government document says.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/ACA7/production/_109099144_mediaitem109099143.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
