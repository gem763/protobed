LeMahieu hit the second pitch of the game into the right-field seats off Cy Young favorite Justin Verlander -- the first leadoff homer at Yankee Stadium since Derek Jeter in 2004 -- and ended when Aaron Hicks hit a three-run homer off the right-field foul pole.\n\nJust like that, the Yankees set a Yankee Stadium record. Never in their storied franchise history, spanning 405 games, had they ever hit two homers in the first inning of a postseason game.\n\nVerlander, who had permitted just four runs and two homers in his last four postseason starts against the Yankees, wound up giving up that many to the first five batters he faced.\n\nWhy, it was the first time Verlander gave up four runs in any single inning since Aug. 11, 2014, against Pittsburgh Pirates.\n\n\u201cThe fastball command wasn\u2019t very good,\u2019\u2019 Verlander said, \u201cand the slider was just hanging. I wasn\u2019t really able to execute anything.\u2019\u2019\n\nVerlander settled back down, commanding his fastball again, retiring 20 of the next 21 batters.\n\n\u201cAt that point,\u2019\u2019 Verlander said, \u201cyou\u2019re hoping and praying your team can scratch and claw and get back in the game.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Yankees refused to let them.\n\nThe Astros, who scored a run in the first on an infield single, a passed ball and a wild pitch, were shut down the rest of the way. James Paxton, throwing 112 pitches, the most by a Yankees\u2019 pitcher this season, went seven innings before turning the game over to the bullpen.\n\nIt was the first time in baseball history that two teams scored in the first inning, and never scored again the rest of the game.\n\nCC: Yankees star pitcher ends career in style\n\nBRYCE: Former Nationals star watches from afar\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re a tough group,\u2019\u2019 Yankees manager Aaron Boone says, \u201cthey really are. Certainly, that first inning started a little rough, but it didn't faze them. They continued to grind, continued to make plays.\n\n\u201cBut it's what they've been good at all year, coming in the next day with an energy and a focus and an edge and a hunger. And it showed up again today. I'm not surprised.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe only surprised himself when he went to the mound with two outs in the seventh inning and Robinson Chirinos at the plate. He was ready to pull Paxton with a torrent of boos from the crowd every step he took. He checked on him, Paxton told him he wanted one more batter, and Boone came back alone, hearing thunderous cheers from the sellout crowd of 48,483.\n\nMoments later, it was Boone gasping for breath when Chirinos\u2019 deep fly ball to left field fell just a foot shy of going over the fence.\n\n\u201cHe gave me the chance to compete and keep on going,\u2019\u2019 Paxton said. \u201cI wanted it. And I did everything I could.\u2019\u2019\n\nIt was that kind of evening for the Yankees, with veteran J.A. Happ saying, \u201cYou talk about a game of inches. Unbelievable.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Astros, of course, still are sitting pretty. They lead 3 games to 2 with Gerrit Cole in their back pocket, a pitcher who is 19-0 with a 1.59 ERA in his last 25 starts.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re up 3-2, we\u2019re in the driver\u2019s seat,\u2019\u2019 Verlander said. \u201cWe\u2019re going back to Houston. But this is a great ballclub. This team is stacked. So these boys are not going to lay down for us.\n\n\u201cWe have to go take care of business at home.\u2019\u2019\n\nYet, when you see crazing things happening like Friday night at Yankee Stadium, the Astros know anything is possible.\n\nIf they\u2019re going to win their second World Series in three years, they\u2019re eventually going to have to hit. They are hitting just .210 this postseason, scoring just 35 runs in 10 games.\n\nThey\u2019ve been pitiful against the Yankees, hitting just .178. Yordan Alvarez, the heavy favorite to win the National League Rookie of the Year, has disappeared. He is one-for-19 this series with nine strikeouts, including three times Friday.\n\nIt\u2019s enough to give a team hope, no matter the odds stacked against them.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how we\u2019re going to piece it together,\u2019\u2019 LeMahieu said, \u201cbut today was a big step gaining confidence. I think we all kind of expected something good to happen today.\n\n\u201cThe first inning kind of got us get our swagger on a little bit again.\u2019\u2019\n\nAnd just like that, the Yankees are alive, and still awfully dangerous.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what this team is about, we\u2019ve never been defined by wins and losses,\u2019\u2019 Yankees slugger Aaron Judge said. \u201cWe always get up after we get knocked down. We always fight back.\n\n\u201cI know with their crowd everybody will be on us. It will be a tough situation. But we\u2019re looking forward to it. This is what we wanted.\n\n\u201cWe thought this series would go six or seven games, and here it is.\u2019\u2019\n\nFollow Nightengale on Twitter @Bnightengale", "description": "The Yankees homered twice in the first inning off Justin Verlander as New York beat Houston in Game 5 of the ALCS.", "authors": ["Bob Nightengale", "Published P.M.
