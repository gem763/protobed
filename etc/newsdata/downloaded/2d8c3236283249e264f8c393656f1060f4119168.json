That includes weighing a number of potential geopolitical flash points and trade talks against a backdrop of weakening U.S. consumer confidence and slowing global economic growth, McMillion said.\n\nRead: Blackstone\u2019s billionaire co-founder says investors should worry about these 5 market dilemmas\n\nU.S.-China trade talks will continue in mid-October, the Federal Reserve meets again in late October, and the U.K. will face an end-of-the month deadline that could see it exit the European Union without a withdrawal agreement, she noted.\n\nU.S. stocks enter October and the final quarter of 2019 in good shape, however. Both the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.71% and the S&P 500 sit 1.6% away from record closes set on July 15 and July 26, respectively.\n\nBut if worries about volatility weren\u2019t enough, some analysts argue that October has also developed a reputation as a \u201cjinx month\u201d for stocks, though that may be a result of historic market crashes in 1929, 1987 and 2008. Those not-so-minor hiccups aside, October historically is fairly average.\n\nSee: A \u2018jinx month\u2019 for the stock market is about to get under way \u2014 that\u2019s very bad news for small-cap investors\n\nSo if nothing else, investors might want to buckle up in anticipation of a potentially rough ride. But how?\n\nMcMillion proposed investors follow a three-pronged strategy: rebalance portfolios to match strategic allocation targets, increase asset quality to reduce risk by cutting allocations to small-cap stocks and both corporate and municipal high-yield fixed income, and modestly increase cash holdings.", "description": "Investors enter this October with a longer-than-usual list of worries.", "authors": ["William Watts", "Deputy Markets Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-FV607_lava_2_ZG_20171004095909.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
