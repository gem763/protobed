Turkey launched airstrikes on northeastern Syria on Wednesday, prompting condemnation from European governments and both parties in Congress.\n\nBut during a \u201cPBS NewsHour\u201d interview released on Wednesday, Pompeo denied that the administration had granted permission for Turkish aggression, saying: \u201cThe United States didn\u2019t give Turkey a green light.\u201d\n\nStill, Pompeo said, Turkey had a \u201clegitimate security concern,\u201d adding that the U.S. has supported Turkey in preventing violence from spilling into the country. He also made it clear that his priority was defending the U.S. from terrorism, even though that could come at the cost of not protecting the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, who have been loyal allies to the U.S. in the fight against ISIS.\n\nPompeo maintained that it became clear after Trump\u2019s call with Erdo\u011fan that U.S. troops were in danger in northeastern Syria. Pompeo said the withdrawal was to protect them.\n\nTrump, in a tweet on Monday, pledged to \u201ctotally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey\u201d if it does anything he views to be \u201coff limits.\u201d But that hasn\u2019t allayed fears among his own national security leaders, who felt blindsided by the withdrawal, and members of Congress from both parties.\n\nAs I have stated strongly before, and just to reiterate, if Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I\u2019ve done before!). They must, with Europe and others, watch over... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 7, 2019\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a loyal Trump ally, made a rare break from the president and criticized the withdrawal. Senator Lindsey Graham (Republican-South Carolina), another stalwart supporter of the president, said the withdrawal could lead to the return of ISIS, and released a bill with Senator Chris Van Hollen (Democrat-Maryland) to sanction Turkey for the strikes.\n\nPBS\u2019 Judy Woodruff brought up the remarks from congressional Republicans, but Pompeo rejected the criticism. He argued that the administration had already had success in eradicating religious extremism in the region, including ISIS\u2019 losses in territory in recent years.\n\n\u201cI love Senator Graham, he is a friend, but remember where we were when this administration came into office and now just judge us by our results,\u201d Pompeo said, repeating the claim that the Trump administration had taken down ISIS.\n\nHe added: \u201cThere are a dozen other countries where the threat from radical Islamic terrorism continues to exist, and we, the United States, has to make sure we position our forces, our resources appropriately to reduce that threat to the United States.\u201d\n\nPompeo also touched on Trump\u2019s Ukraine scandal, which is at the center of the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry. Trump asked President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden \u2014 a request that has been blasted as asking for foreign interference in a U.S. election \u2014 according to a readout of a phone call between the two leaders in late July.\n\nPompeo characterized the call as a legitimate part of the administration\u2019s effort to eradicate corruption in the former Soviet state.\n\n\u201cI know what this administration has done with respect to Ukraine,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked diligently on this. I\u2019m proud of our results. I remember where Obama left Ukraine; it left it at 80 percent of the size that it was when he came into office.\"\n\nTrump said a similar line during a September bilateral meeting with Zelenskiy in New York. After Zelenskiy lamented the loss of Ukrainian territory in the past decade, Trump said: \u201cIf you remember, you lost Crimea during a different administration, not during the Trump administration.\u201d\n\nRussia invaded and seized parts of eastern Ukraine in 2014, prompting condemnation from Western countries, including the U.S.", "description": "Trump indicated he wasn\u2019t worried about ISIS fighters escaping northern Syria, because if they do, \u2018they\u2019re going to be escaping to Europe.\u2019", "authors": ["Matthew Choi"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1180081872-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
