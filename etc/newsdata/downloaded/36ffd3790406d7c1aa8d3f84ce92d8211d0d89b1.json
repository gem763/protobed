I told them we have a lot of quality and talent. But first we have to run and fight.\"\n\nPhotos: Euro 2016 Finals: France Portugal Cristiano Ronaldo celebrated with teammate Eder, the goalscorer, after Portugal defeated France 1-0 to win Euro 2016.

In fairness, Payet won the ball with his tackle, but in the follow through collided with the Portugal captain's left knee.\n\nAmid the intensity there was skill as well from France, notably when Payet delicately chipped the ball to Griezmann, whose header was superbly tipped over the bar by Patricio.\n\nJust past the quarter hour mark, Ronaldo needed more treatment on his left leg with the captain only returning to the action after the Portuguese medical team applied plenty of strapping to his left knee.\n\nBut on 23 minutes Ronaldo went down again and this time referee Clattenburg signaled for a stretcher, with the Portuguese captain distraught and in tears as he was ferried away.\n\nRicardo Quaresma replaced Ronaldo, but Portugal soon had others things to worry about when Sissoko created some space before blasting a shot that Patricio pushed away.\n\nSoon after Cedric Soares was yellow carded for kneeing Payet in the back.\n\nUnited by football, though taking a break for 90 mins - Friends Anthony Bidel, Helene Pianzola & Miguel Tischhauser pic.twitter.com/xJNJxJZYgM \u2014 John Sinnott (@JohnSinnott) July 10, 2016\n\nEuropean governing body UEFA had predicted a global audience of 300 million people would be watching this final, but with Ronaldo off and Portugal concentrating on their defensive duties this showpiece at times was less show and more attrition.\n\nJust before the hour, France coach Deschamps withdrew Payet, replacing him with Kingsley Coman in a bid to break the deadlock.\n\nPayet had been key to France's progress to the final, but the French forward wasn't quite on his game and Deschamps didn't rule out tiredness playing a part in the rather subdued performance he gave.\n\nIt was Coman who teed up another chance for Griezmann, with the Atletico Madrid forward going agonizingly close with a header.\n\nRonaldo was guiding his team from the touchline during extra-time.\n\nAmid the impasse, Sissoko continued to have a barnstorming game, notably tracking a dangerous run from Renato Sanches.\n\nFrance was soon back on the attack but Patricio again came to his side's rescue, conjuring up a brilliant one-handed save to deny Oliver Giroud.\n\nThat was Giroud's final part in the proceedings as Deschamps introduced Gignac.\n\nIn contrast to Patricio, French goalkeeper Hugo Lloris had relatively little to do, but as the game edged towards extra time he had to tip away a dangerous cross from Nani and then deal with Quaresma's hooked shot.\n\nPatricio was soon back in action and once more it was Sissoko providing the threat, launching a shot that the Portuguese goalkeeper flung himself to his right before pushing the ball away.\n\nIn stoppage time substitute Andr\u00e9-Pierre Gignac came desperately close to snatching the win for France when he bedazzled Pepe, leaving the Portuguese defender on the floor, only to then hit his shot against the post.\n\nDuring extra time, Portugal began to threaten Lloris' goal more often and the French goalkeeper was mightily relieved when Guerreiro's beautifully taken free kick hit the bar.\n\nAnd then substitute Eder broke free and from just outside the French penalty area he struck a low shot that beat Lloris' despairing dive.\n\nPortugal had to hold on for another 11 minutes, but it did so to deprive France of a third European Championship triumph.\n\nCue more tears from Ronaldo -- and who can blame him.", "description": "Portugal gatecrashed France's Euro 2016 party to win the European Championship for the first time in its history -- and all this without their Cristiano Ronaldo.", "authors": ["John Sinnott"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160710222344-portugal-tease-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2016-07-10"}
