That\u2019s 110 percent.\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "Then business came up. Lerner didn\u2019t sour when asked about the future of Anthony Rendon. He did get a bit more serious while expressing that he wants the all-star third baseman to be with the franchise beyond this year. Rendon will become a free agent following this season, and as a National League MVP candidate he should attract offers on the open market.\n\n\u201cWe certainly want to keep him. That\u2019s 110 percent,\u201d Lerner said. \u201cIt\u2019s really in Tony\u2019s and his family\u2019s hands at this point. They have to decide what they want to do. He\u2019s earned that right as a free agent. It couldn\u2019t happen to a better guy. We love him to death.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn early September, the Nationals offered Rendon a seven-year deal in the range of $210 million to $215 million, according to multiple people with knowledge of the situation. There are deferrals in the contract, according to those people, that would be paid within the seven years after the contract expires. The offer is not expected to keep Rendon from testing free agency. He has been saying since mid-summer that he is interested in seeing what\u2019s out there, often likening it to visiting a few lots while car shopping.\n\nBut Rendon always adds that he is interested in returning to Washington. He was drafted by the Nationals in 2011 and has been with the franchise since. This season was his best from start to finish, and he has been a key part of the postseason run. Lerner\u2019s perspective is critical because such big spending is an ownership decision. He didn\u2019t say a lot in his first public comments about Rendon but indicated it\u2019s now up to the player, his family and his representation to consider what\u2019s on the table.\n\nThere are obvious parallels to Rendon\u2019s impending free agency and what the Nationals experienced with Bryce Harper last fall. The Nationals offered Harper a 10-year, $300 million deal late last September. That deal, however, had deferrals that wouldn\u2019t pay out until 2052. Harper wound up signing with the Philadelphia Phillies for 13 years and $330 million. Listening to Lerner, and judging all signs since spring, it seems Washington wants to make sure Rendon sticks around.\n\n\u201cI hope that his decision is to stay here,\u201d Lerner said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll go pick him up and bring him over.\u201d\n\nRead more Nats coverage:\n\nAD", "description": "Lerner spoke with reporters ahead of Game 4 of the NLCS on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Jesse Dougherty", "Reporter Covering The Washington Nationals."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/01IScV7CZvH1aFnF6dMBVYnK3w0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RCCBYIHOZAI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
