The towering Columbus statue at Columbus Circle in New York City now needs 24-hour guards after Mayor Bill de Blasio put it on the list of a commission to review \u201coffensive\u201d memorials.\n\nAnd according to Far Left Watch, a watchdog organization, Antifa and other left-wing groups plan to deface and attack Columbus statues across the country on Columbus Day.\n\nIt is unfortunate to see what was once a uniting figure\u2014who represented American courage, optimism, and even immigrants\u2014is suddenly in the crosshairs for destruction. We owe it to Columbus and ourselves to be more respectful of the man who made the existence of our country possible.\n\nOnce Revered, Now Maligned\n\nA few historians and activists began to attack Columbus\u2019 legacy in the late 20th century. They concocted a new narrative of Columbus as a rapacious pillager and a genocidal maniac.\n\nFar-left historian Howard Zinn, in particular, had a huge impact on changing the minds of a generation of Americans about the Columbus legacy. Zinn not only maligned Columbus, but attacked the larger migration from the Old World to the new that he ushered in.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just Columbus who was a monster, according to Zinn, it was the driving ethos of the civilization that ultimately developed in the wake of his discovery: the United States.\n\n\u201cBehind the English invasion of North America,\u201d Zinn wrote, \u201cbehind their massacre of Indians, their deception, their brutality, was that special powerful drive born in civilizations based on private profit.\u201d\n\nThe truth is that Columbus set out for the New World thinking he would spread Christianity to regions where it didn\u2019t exist. While Columbus, and certainly his Spanish benefactors, had an interest in the goods and gold he could return from what they thought would be Asia, the explorer\u2019s primary motivation was religious.\n\n\u201cThis conviction that God destined him to be an instrument for spreading the faith was far more potent than the desire to win glory, wealth, and worldly honors,\u201d wrote historian Samuel Eliot Morison over a half-century ago.\n\nIn fact, as contemporary historian Carol Delaney noted, even the money Columbus sought was primarily dedicated to religious purposes. Delaney said in an interview with the Catholic fraternal organization the Knights of Columbus:\n\nEverybody knows that Columbus was trying to find gold, but they don\u2019t know what the gold was for: to fund a crusade to take Jerusalem back from the Muslims before the end of the world. A lot of people at the time thought that the apocalypse was coming because of all the signs: the plague, famine, earthquakes, and so forth. And it was believed that before the end, Jerusalem had to be back in Christian hands so that Christ could return in judgment.\n\nColumbus critics don\u2019t just stop at accusing him of greed. One of the biggest allegations against him is that he waged a genocidal war and engaged in acts of cruelty against indigenous people in the Americas.\n\nBut historians like Delaney have debunked these claims.\n\nRather than cruel, Columbus was mostly benign in his interaction with native populations. While deprivations did occur, Columbus was quick to punish those under his command who committed unjust acts against local populations.\n\n\u201cColumbus strictly told the crew not to do things like maraud, or rape, and instead to treat the native people with respect,\u201d Delaney said. \u201cThere are many examples in his writings where he gave instructions to this effect. Most of the time when injustices occurred, Columbus wasn\u2019t even there. There were terrible diseases that got communicated to the natives, but he can\u2019t be blamed for that.\u201d\n\nColumbus certainly wasn\u2019t a man without flaws or attitudes that would be unacceptable today.\n\nBut even as a man of an earlier age in which violence and cruelty were often the norm between different cultures and people, Columbus did not engage in the savage acts that have been pinned on him.\n\nHow Americans Once Viewed Columbus\n\nFor much of the 19th and 20th centuries, most Americans were taught about Columbus\u2019 discovery of the New World in school.\n\n\u201cIn 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue \u2026 \u201d went a popular poem about the Italian explorer who flew under the Spanish flag. At one time, Americans marveled at what seemed like an unbelievably courageous voyage across unknown waters with the limited tools and maps of the 15th century.\n\nIt is difficult in the 21st century to imagine what Columbus faced as he crossed the Atlantic in search of what he thought was a route to Asia. The hardship and danger was immense. If things went awry, there would be nothing to save his little flotilla besides hope, prayer, and a little courage.\n\nMost people, even in the 1490s, knew that the Earth was round. However, Columbus made a nevertheless history-altering discovery.\n\nThe world was a much bigger place than most had imagined, and though Columbus never personally realized the scope of his discovery, he opened up a new world that would one day become a forefront of human civilization.\n\nThis is the man and the history that earlier generations of Americans came to respect and admire.\n\nUnfortunately, Zinn and others\u2019 caricature of Columbus and American civilization has stuck and in an era in which radicals and activists search the country for problematic statues to destroy, Columbus is a prime target.\n\nKu Klux Klan Pushed Anti-Columbus Rhetoric\n\nMuch of the modern rhetoric about Columbus mirrors attacks lobbed at him in the 19th century by anti-Catholic and anti-Italian groups like the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nIn fact, Columbus Day became a nationally celebrated holiday following a mass lynching of Italians in New Orleans\u2014the largest incident of lynching in American history.\n\nIn 1892\u2014the 400th anniversary of the Columbus voyage\u2014President Benjamin Harrison called for a national celebration of Columbus and his achievements. Americans patriotically celebrated Columbus and erected numerous statues in his honor as the country embraced him.\n\nThough American appreciation of Columbus deepened, some groups weren\u2019t pleased.\n\nAs the pro-Columbus website The Truth About Columbus points out, the Ku Klux Klan worked to stop Columbus Day celebrations, smash statues, and reverse his growing influence on American culture.\n\nAccording to The Truth About Columbus, in the 1920s, the Klan \u201cattempted to remove Columbus Day as a state holiday in Oregon,\u201d burned a cross \u201cto disturb a Columbus Day celebration in Pennsylvania,\u201d and successfully \u201copposed the erection of a statue of Columbus in Richmond, Virginia, only to see the decision to reject the statue reversed.\u201d\n\nAttempts to quash Columbus failed, but they have re-emerged in our own time through the actions of far-left groups who want to see his legacy buried and diminished forever.\n\nThis would be a tragic loss for our generation and those of the future.\n\nThe bravery and boldness that Columbus displayed in his trek to America have been inherent in the American cultural DNA from the beginning.\n\nWe may never have the class, the taste, the sophistication of the Old World upper crust. But what we do have is a reverence for simple virtues of strength, boldness, and a willingness to push the envelope to secure for ourselves a better future than those who\u2019ve come before.\n\nWe are a civilization that admires those who push the limits of the frontier, who don\u2019t merely accept what is and want something more. The spirit that drove us west and in modernity, to the moon, is what we celebrate in men like Columbus.\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan said it best in a Columbus Day tribute:\n\nColumbus is justly admired as a brilliant navigator, a fearless man of action, a visionary who opened the eyes of an older world to an entirely new one. Above all, he personifies a view of the world that many see as quintessentially American: not merely optimistic, but scornful of the very notion of despair.\n\nWhen we have lost these things, when we no longer have the capacity to celebrate men like Columbus, as imperfect as they sometimes were, we will have lost what has made us great, and distinct.", "description": "While radicals have tried to smear Columbus, it is important for Americans to at least try to inform themselves about what is under siege.", "authors": ["Jarrett Stepman"], "top_image": "https://www.dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/171006_Columbus.jpg", "published_at": "2017-10-06"}
