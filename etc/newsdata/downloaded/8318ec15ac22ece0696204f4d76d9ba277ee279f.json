Some of those [operations] were sophisticated. Some of those included blue chip companies of great world reputation \u2026 that is the shocking part,\" he said.\n\nHe said that government through its various agencies- such as the prosecuting authorities and crime intelligence authorities to bring to book those complicit in corruption.\n\n\n\n\"I am more confident that I have been in the past that the [National] Prosecuting Authority will be going after those complicit in criminal activity.
