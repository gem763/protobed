Fox Corp. networks broadcast the matches in English.\n\nThe rest of the discrepancy could be due to a number of potential factors, including high demand for last-minute ad buys, according to a Kantar spokesman.\n\nThe research company used different data sets to calculate its earlier figure, which was based in part on ad spending in the 2015 FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup, and its final estimate, which used actual data from ad buyers and sellers.\n\n\u201cDemand was high for the Women\u2019s World Cup in the U.S.,\u201d said Jeremy Carey, managing director at Omnicom Group sports ad buying agency Optimum Sports. \u201c[Fox] sold every impression they could sell.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. women\u2019s team drew massive publicity during its run toward a fourth World Cup title this summer, aided by its dominance on the field and co-captain Megan Rapinoe, who made headlines this summer after a video surfaced of her saying she wouldn\u2019t visit the White House if the team won.\n\nMoney in the World Cup took the spotlight after the U.S. women\u2019s team this year sued the U.S. Soccer Federation, claiming its players make less than players on the U.S. men\u2019s team despite the fact that the women hold the same job responsibilities and win more. U.S. Soccer, a nonprofit, denies discriminating against the women\u2019s team.\n\nThe complex nature of soccer\u2019s business arrangements and differences between the tournaments make it hard to directly compare revenue and player compensation.\n\nThe men\u2019s World Cup last year drew $350 million in TV advertising in the U.S., Kantar said. Its estimates in both cases count ads during halftime, pre- and post-match coverage and encore telecasts, plus other peripheral programming. Kantar has updated its methodology since the prior World Cups, four years earlier.\n\nThe women\u2019s tournament spanned 52 matches, compared with 64 for the men\u2019s, and included about half the commercial time, according to Kantar.\n\nTV ad revenue doesn\u2019t flow directly to players\u2019 pay. U.S. Soccer pays the teams from revenue generated through operations such as ticket sales and sponsorships.\n\nTV programmers spend hundreds of millions of dollars for the rights to the tournaments, but those deals are between the TV networks and FIFA, soccer\u2019s global governing body.\n\nA Fox spokesperson said it does not comment on its financials.\n\nStrong ad sales and ratings for a World Cup, however, can reflect team popularity and translate into revenue for U.S. Soccer. The ongoing five-game U.S. women\u2019s team victory tour, for instance, recently drew nearly 50,000 ticket-buying fans in Philadelphia.\n\nThere\u2019s been an \u201cawakening\u201d in terms of how brand clients are thinking about the Women\u2019s World Cup, said Andre Schunk, executive vice president at sports marketing agency Octagon.\n\nThe women\u2019s tournament as a whole averaged 992,000 U.S. viewers, according to Nielsen. The men\u2019s contest averaged 2.3 million U.S. viewers across all matches.\n\nStill, the women\u2019s championship match this year averaged far more viewers in the U.S. than the most recent men\u2019s final, according to Nielsen. (The U.S. men failed to qualify for the 2018 tournament in Russia.)\n\nFox charged more for ads in this year\u2019s Women\u2019s World Cup, which took place in France, than in the 2015 tournament in Canada, despite the fact that advertisers last time had the benefit of a U.S.-friendly North American time zone, said Optimum\u2019s Mr. Carey. Strong viewership in 2015 served as a base for Fox when selling ads, and advertisers saw the value in this year\u2019s tournament, he said.\n\nThe Women\u2019s World Cup represented Visa Inc.\u2019s largest global marketing outlay in 2019, said Chris Curtin, chief brand and innovation marketing officer at the company.\n\nVisa, the official payment services sponsor for FIFA, secured a contract with U.S. Soccer that allocates at least 50% of the company\u2019s investment to the U.S. women\u2019s team and the federation\u2019s women\u2019s programming initiatives, according to a spokesperson.\n\nFox Corp. and Wall Street Journal parent News Corp share common ownership.\n\nWrite to Alexandra Bruell at alexandra.bruell@wsj.com and Rachel Bachman at rachel.bachman@wsj.com", "description": "Advertisers shelled out almost $100 million on U.S. TV commercials in and around the 2019 FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup, exceeding expectations.", "authors": ["Alexandra Bruell", "Rachel Bachman", "Alexandra.Bruell Wsj.Com", "Rachel.Bachman Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106988/social", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
