Affected stores could shutter by year\u2019s end \u2014 but the employees who stand to lose their jobs aren\u2019t idly waiting to learn their fate.\n\nSeveral hundred full- and part-time Forever 21 employees are in the early stages of organizing for worker protections, according to the New York-based labor rights group, United for Respect. The mobilization follows the successful efforts of workers at Toys R Us and Sears following their companies\u2019 liquidation or downsizing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing how Toys R Us was a game changer,\u201d Lily Wang, deputy campaigns director for United for Respect told The Washington Post. \u201cIt was a real moment, and now we\u2019re seeing it unfold with companies that go bankrupt. Workers realize they don\u2019t have to normalize [this] problem.\u201d\n\nOrganizing efforts by traditional retail employees is a boon for the labor movement, which President Trump has sought to weaken in recent years. Despite those efforts, approval of labor unions hovers near its highest level in 50 years, according to Gallup. Labor has also emerged as a key campaign issue among Democratic presidential candidates like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who called for Forever 21 workers to be fairly compensated.\n\nHundreds of workers have reached out to the labor group since the weekend, Wang said. \u201cPeople are upset and anxious about their future, their employment and their store.\u201d\n\nCurrent employees did not want to go on record with their experiences due to fears of retribution from the company; Wang said several employees cited past instances where Forever 21 swiftly closed stores with little warning or explanation, which prompted their concerns over how the company would treat employees amid bankruptcy.\n\n[Toys R Us workers are training Sears workers to fight for severance]\n\nForever 21 did not respond to requests for comment, but Executive Vice President Linda Chang said in a statement announcing the bankruptcy filing, \u201cThis was an important and necessary step to secure the future of our Company, which will enable us to reorganize our business and reposition Forever 21.\u201d\n\nNow, United for Respect is looking to maintain momentum from this summer\u2019s victory with Toys R Us.\n\nWhen the toy company announced last year it would shutter its 800 U.S. stores and lay off 33,000 employees, workers fought and won a $20 million severance fund from the investment firms that bought the toy company a decade earlier. Although the sum was less than a third of what labor advocates say the company owed to its employees, it signaled a new level of possibility for worker rights and compensation in the face of layoffs and reorganizations.\n\nWang credited the maturation and history of other grass-roots labor movements, like the fight for a $15 minimum wage, with propelling United for Respect\u2019s current efforts.\n\n\u201cWe have learned over and over again from the past week, workers are at the bottom in terms of priority for any claims or wages,\u201d Wang said. \u201cWorkers deserve to know their pay and benefits are protected before executives can get their bonuses.\u201d\n\n[\u2018A tipping point in fast fashion\u2019: Forever 21\u2019s bankruptcy signals the shifting priorities of young shoppers]\n\nThe threat of being laid off with little to no severance isn\u2019t the only financial pressure workers face, said Hyunseob Kim, an assistant finance professor at the Johnson Graduate School of Management at Cornell University who specializes in labor economics.\n\nThe impact on a worker\u2019s income can last as long as seven years when taking into account lost earning potential, the unpaid time and resources spent looking for a new job, and the periods full-time workers may spend earning less if only part-time work is available, he said. Skills specific to a particular store or industry don\u2019t always translate across industries, further reducing a worker\u2019s earning potential.\n\nWe\u2019re hearing from Forever 21 employees that hours are being cut, positions are being eliminated, and some people have been demoted in preparation for the bankruptcy.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re here for you. You\u2019re not alone.\n\n\n\nGet ready to fight for what you deserve.

Kim said traditional brick-and-mortar companies face the twin threats of more nimble e-commerce and rising rents, especially in major metro areas where they\u2019re squeezed on both the revenue and the rental expense side. Forever 21 also embarked on an aggressive expansion outside the United States and, according to Forbes, had a habit of signing 10-year leases on massive retail spaces in the United States.\n\nBut perhaps the company\u2019s biggest blind spot wasn\u2019t real estate or international expansion, but the changing tastes of its core customers: teens and young adults.\n\n\u201cIf you take everything that\u2019s happening in retail, we unfortunately know there will be more retail bankruptcies on the horizon,\u201d Wang, the labor organizer said. \u201cThere\u2019s a real opportunity for Forever 21 employees to realize the power they have and make sure they have a voice in this organization.\u201d\n\nIn the months ahead, Forever 21 is expected to release more details about the future of dozens of U.S. stores. According to court documents filed in the bankruptcy motion, the company\u2019s decisions will have an impact on roughly 6,400 full-time employees in the United States and more than 26,000 part-time workers.\n\nRead more:\n\nWeather community grieves NOAA scientist\u2019s death in rough seas along North Carolina coast\n\nWatch a jailed Colombian politician escape through a window during a dentist appointment\n\nMatt Lieberman, son of a former VP nominee, launches Senate run in Georgia", "description": "As the fast fashion retailer negotiates debts and plots out the future, workers want to ensure their fair share.", "authors": ["Kim Bellware", "Reporter Covering National Breaking News", "October At Am", "Kim Bellware Is A General Assignment Reporter For The Washington Post.
