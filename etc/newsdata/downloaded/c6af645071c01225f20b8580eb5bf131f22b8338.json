For many, in doing so, the French President might have jeopardised the EU's decade-long strategy towards the Balkans.\n\nZaev told Euronews\u2019 Efi Koutsokosta that he regarded the failure to begin accession talks as a betrayal:\n\n\u201cAll countries of the western Balkans have an EU integration agenda, but in my country happened a lot of positive things. We are a very rare positive example in terms of bilateral issues here in the region. The agreement with Greece is a rare kind of agreement. This kind of agreement has been present in the past only after wars, when the politicians sit and make agreements.\n\n\u201cWe changed our name, we changed our constitution, we got the majority in a process of 120 days, a very painful process because there were a lot of threats by the nationalists and radicals in our country and after that, the message (from Europe) was \u201cOK, you are ready\u201d but now we are not ready. Really, we can wait but it's a big disappointment for us.\n\n\"We changed everything in the country. We changed all signs in our public institutions, signs with all our neighbours in the airports, in our documentation, websites, everything. We are in the process.\u201d\n\nZaev is anxious that the stalling in EU accession talks could encourage the return of nationalism and extremism:\n\n\u201cI'm afraid very much. If there is positive soil for nationalism and radicalism to rise again, it will mean big damage to the whole Balkans. And when the Balkans have a problem, Europe has a problem.\"\n\nREAD MORE: The background to the renaming", "description": "North Macedonia's Prime Minister has warned that the agreement with Greece that led to his country's renaming could be in danger.\n\nZoran Zaev's comments follow the European Union\u2019s decision not to begin accession negotiations with the Balkan nation.
