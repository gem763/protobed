Whatever side you end up on, it sounds like you\u2019ll be very satisfied.\n\nFor sweets, there\u2019s something called the \u2018Williams Dessert Sticks\u2019 which is a choice of a \u2018seasonal ice cream stick\u2019 (intriguing) dipped in dark or milk chocolate, and paired with a choice of three toppings. I don\u2019t know what any of this would look like but I feel like I\u2019m making a deal with the Cursed Frogurt guy from The Simpsons.\n\nJumping right into the Grill\u2019d world domination trend, Williams already has a shop open on Level 5 in Sydney\u2019s Pitt St Westfield and a spot in Melbourne\u2019s South Yarra predicted to open in October, the team has plans to expand in 15 more locations over the next three years.", "description": "Williams is the newest venture from the Grill'd team, and its first burger joint in Sydney's Pitt St Mall looks like a real fancy-ass Grill'd.", "authors": ["Courtney Fry"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/williams-burger-days-fb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
