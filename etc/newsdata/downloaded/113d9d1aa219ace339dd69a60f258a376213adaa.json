(Image: Warner Bros.)\n\nAfter months of rumours and speculation, we finally know who\u2019s back, who isn\u2019t, and who\u2019s arriving for the first time when it comes to the cast of James Gunn\u2019s Suicide Squad sequel. And my god, it\u2019s a hell of a big cast.\n\nJames Gunn just took to Twitter to reveal the first official confirmation of The Suicide Squad\u2019s complete cast. Like Gunn says though, don\u2019t get too attached: this is the Suicide Squad after all, and the reason there\u2019s so many of them is because a good chunk of these stars will be playing corpses by the end of the film.\n\nA lot of it confirms the rumours that have been circling from the past few months, even the wildest ones like John Cena, Taika Waititi, Peter Capaldi, and Idris Elba. But there are still a few surprises in there...mainly around who\u2019s not back, like a certain Joker himself, Jared Leto. Maybe he has other things to do? Anyway, here\u2019s who\u2019s actually returning from the divisive original:\n\nViola Davis, as Amanda Waller\n\nMargot Robbie, as Harley Quinn\n\nJai Courtney, as Captain Boomerang\n\nJoel Kinnaman, as Rick Flag\n\nWho are the rest of them are playing? Your guess is as good as ours right now, but we do have a few suggestions.\n\nThe Suicide Squad is currently slated for an August 6, 2021 release.", "description": "After months of rumours and speculation, we finally know who\u2019s back, who isn\u2019t, and who\u2019s arriving for the first time when it comes to the cast of James Gunn\u2019s Suicide Squad sequel.
