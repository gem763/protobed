The last couple of years have taught us that such thinking was, at best, complacent. The rise of nationalism across the continent has fuelled some unacceptable behaviour and some have taken it upon themselves to think that a football crowd is the right place to give voice to their appalling views.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

But some of the views expressed about Uefa\u2019s approach to fighting racism have been a long way off the mark. Uefa, in close cooperation with the FARE network (Football Against Racism Europe), instituted the three-stage protocol for identifying and tackling racist behaviour during games.\n\n\u201cUefa\u2019s sanctions are among the toughest in sport for clubs and associations whose supporters are racist at our matches. The minimum sanction is a partial closure of the stadium \u2013 a move which costs the hosts at least hundreds of thousands in lost revenue and attaches a stigma to their supporters.\n\n\u201cUefa is the only football body to ban a player for ten matches for racist behaviour \u2013 the most severe punishment level in the game. Believe me, Uefa is committed to doing everything it can to eliminate this disease from football. We cannot afford to be content with this; we must always strive to strengthen our resolve.\n\n\u201cMore broadly, the football family \u2013 everyone from administrators to players, coaches and fans \u2013 needs to work with governments and NGOs to wage war on the racists and to marginalise their abhorrent views to the fringes of society. Football associations themselves cannot solve this problem. Governments too need to do more in this area. Only by working together in the name of decency and honour will we make progress.\u201d", "description": "Uefa president Aleksander\u00a0Ceferin\u00a0has urged the \u201cfootball family\u201d to \u201cwage war on the racists\u201d in a statement following the racist abuse that\u00a0England\u00a0players suffered during their Euro 2020 qualifier\u00a0against Bulgaria.", "authors": ["Jack Rathborn"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/15/10/england-bulgaria.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
