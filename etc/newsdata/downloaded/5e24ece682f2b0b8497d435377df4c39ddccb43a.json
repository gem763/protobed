Obviously, our first-team manager has a say,\" he said.\n\n(Image: Sunday Mirror)\n\n\u201cAngel, Tahith, and James could have gone out on loan but he wanted to keep them here and have a look at them on tour. So a decision will be made, no doubt, for January as well. Hopefully, all three will be in the first team and not going anywhere.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been presented with an opportunity and they\u2019ve taken the opportunity so now a couple of them are regulars on the team sheet each week. We\u2019ve had opportunities that have cropped up from nowhere. That\u2019s football.\n\n\u201cHopefully, some of the lads out on loan now will also catch the eye as some have gone out with a perception of their ability and where they\u2019ll end up but hopefully they\u2019ll come back and people will say maybe we\u2019ve got a little diamond.\u201d\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nOn the process that United staff members go through before deciding upon a destination, Parry adds: \"We draw up a player\u2019s needs before we start the process.\n\n\"I\u2019m not kidding that we tick every box, because we can\u2019t, but there have been a few clubs for one or two players, that we didn\u2019t think were suitable.\n\n\"On the face of it, it might look a good move, but we didn\u2019t think it was, for one reason or another, so we looked elsewhere.\u201d\n\nUnited have been tipped to make a move for Juventus striker Mario Mandzukic in January with Solskjaer expected to be given funds to strengthen.", "description": "Manchester United have been forced to call upon several youngsters this season amid mounting injury problems", "authors": ["Liam Prenderville", "Image", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Sunday Mirror", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20583540.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Premier-League-Newcastle-United-v-Manchester-United.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
