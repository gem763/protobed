Within days, Turkey had advanced into the area and began attacking Kurdish fighters, threatening instability in the region and the resurgence of ISIS.\n\nTrump, however, has insisted the cease-fire is a victory, boasting on Friday that \u201cwe've had tremendous success, I think, over the last couple of days.\u201d\n\n\u201cLittle bit unconventional, little bit of hard love \u2014 I told you that, a lot of pain for a couple days, and sometimes you have to go through some pain before you get a good solution. But the Kurds are very happy about it. President Erdogan of Turkey is satisfied with it. And we are in a very strong position,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House after a call with NASA astronauts.\n\nEsper in his statement also said that he and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Mark Milley briefed the Senate and House Armed Services committees Thursday in classified hearings on the events that led to Turkey's incursion into Syria.\n\n\u201cWe had a very serious, candid, and constructive discussion about where we've been, where we are, and where we are going when it comes to Syria and Turkey. I appreciated the members taking the time to hear from us, and we are thankful for their continued support to our service members,\u201d Esper said.\n\nHe added that he just spoke with his Turkish counterpart by phone, during which he \u201creiterated the United States' position that Turkey must adhere to the full terms of this agreement, and that we expect Turkey to ensure the safety and well-being of all people in the area controlled by Turkish Forces.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis ceasefire is a much needed step in protecting those vulnerable populations. I also reminded him of Turkey's responsibility for maintaining security of the ISIS detainees located in the affected areas.\u201d", "description": "Defense Secretary Mark Esper will travel to the Middle East and Brussels this weekend to meet with his Turkish counterpart and other NATO allies following the fragile cease-fire announced in Syria on Thursday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/turkey_invades_syria_10132019_1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
