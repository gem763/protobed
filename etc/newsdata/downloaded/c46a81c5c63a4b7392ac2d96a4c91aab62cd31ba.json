But sooner or later we will have to do it, because I have every confidence in Hong Kong's fundamentals.\"\n\nWhat happened?\n\nIn a leaked transcript of an August address to businesspeople, published by Reuters news agency, Ms Lam said that four of the eight firms had turned the job down straightaway.\n\nThe other four firms were then invited to a briefing with the government.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Carrie Lam told reporters she was told that the \"time is not right\" for a PR strategy\n\nAccording to the brief, published in the PR industry paper The Holmes Report, the government wanted a firm to \"address negative perceptions in key markets overseas to maintain confidence in Hong Kong\", and to \"underscore the strengths and attributes that differentiate Hong Kong from other cities in the region and bring out the success of one country, two systems\".\n\nNone of the four remaining firms bid for the contract.\n\nSpeaking to the publication, a representative for one of these firms criticised the government for trying to develop a PR strategy \"while the streets are on fire\".\n\nWhat is the situation in Hong Kong?\n\nThe protests began in June in opposition to a proposed bill, which would have made it possible for people in Hong Kong to be extradited to mainland China.\n\nCritics said they could have faced human rights abuses.\n\nThe bill was initially shelved, and later withdrawn completely, but this has failed to quell the protesters' anger.\n\nNow, protesters are calling for full democracy and an investigation into allegations of police brutality during the protests, among other demands.", "description": "Amid ongoing protests the government contacted eight PR firms, but all of them turned down the job.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/D0F5/production/_108839435_hi056526311.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
