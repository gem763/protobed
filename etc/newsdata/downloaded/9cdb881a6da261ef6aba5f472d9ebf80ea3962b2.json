By June there were 1 007 EVs on the road, including hybrid EVs and battery EVs.\n\n\u201cGlobally, air pollution is a silent killer, with about 5.5 million people killed every year. The economic impact is in excess of R30 billion in South Africa,\u201d Parmar says.\n\n\n\nAt the UN special climate summit last week, many plans and commitments were put forward in an effort to reduce greenhouse emissions by 2030.\n\nThe City of Cape Town committed to \u201cfossil fuel-free streets\u201d by that year.\n\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa said in a statement to the UN that South Africa \u201chas introduced a carbon tax \u2026 and finalised a green transport strategy\u201d, but acknowledged that \u201cmeeting these commitments would be very challenging\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, the EV market in South Africa is steadily growing.\n\nBy June there were 1 007 EVs on the road, including hybrid EVs and battery EVs.\n\nParmar says EV-type cars have been in the country since 2005, but they came to prominence when the Optimal Energy Joule was unveiled in 2008.\n\nUnfortunately that project was shut down in 2012 after funding dried up and since then the larger car manufacturers entered the market.\n\nUptake was slow, with 2016 and 2017 recording no growth.\n\n\u00adHowever, over the past year, growth in EVs on the road has risen by nearly 100%.\n\n\n\nOne of the main problems with regards to uptake is import tariffs.\n\nCurrently, EVs imported from Europe attract a 25% tariff compared with the 18% tariff that combustion engines attract.\n\n\u201cThese vehicles are classified as luxury items, that\u2019s why they attract that tariff,\u201d Parmar says.\n\nBrian Hastie, who is part of Jaguar Land Rover\u2019s EV board and is chairman of the EV subcommittee of the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of SA, says \u201ccompanies are citing the higher import duty that is affecting the price position\u201d.\n\nHe adds that \u201cthere is no logic for EVs to attract a higher duty rate, especially because they are a good thing. It\u2019s historical and there\u2019s nothing to substantiate it.\u201d\n\nHowever, this is only part of the problem.\n\nNot all the EV models that big brands have released globally are available in South Africa.\n\nMost brands with EVs in South Africa are still premium and can range in price from R500 000 to R2 million.\n\nHastie says the EV industry, together with car manufacturers, is putting in place a document that will convince government why tariffs and duties should be reduced or even scrapped.\n\nHe says the document will also look at what incentives can be given to consumers to help the uptake of EVs because \u201cglobally, across many markets, the uptake of EVs has been coupled with incentives\u201d.\n\nThese incentives will not be there forever, only until \u201cconsumers understand the value proposition of electric vehicles, such as lower running costs, and that they can live with one [in terms of infrastructure]\u201d.\n\nHastie says once momentum is achieved, production costs will decline and the cars will become cheaper.\n\nINFRASTRUCTURE\n\nBoth Parmar and Hastie agree that more can be done with regards to infrastructure, but a lot has already been rolled out.\n\nAccording to plugshare.com, an app and web-based application that tracks publicly available charging ports, there are at least 128 charging locations \u2013 most of them located in Gauteng.\n\n\u201cBeyond this, any time the EV is idle is an opportunity to charge it because the car comes with a convenience cable, which means an electric vehicle can be charged from a wall socket,\u201d Parmar says.\n\nAlthough the wall chargers are slow (charging at about 4kW/hour), those available in public spaces can charge a car to full capacity within two hours (charging at60kW/hour), while the slow chargers could take anywhere between seven and 11 hours, depending on the EV model.\n\nAnother concern is range anxiety, how far EVs can travel on a full charge.\n\nWell, anywhere from 250km to 450km, depending on the model, the experts say, but it would be wise to plan your trips.\n\nMANUFACTURING AN EV\n\nStats SA noted that last year motor vehicle production posted a 3.5% growth rate after two consecutive years of decline.\n\nThis while \u201cfactories involved in the production of vehicle accessories had the most to celebrate, enjoying a 9.2% rise in activity\u201d.\n\nWe are not manufacturing any electric vehicles in South Africa and that\u2019s a challenge\n\nParmar says the automotive industry contributes 7% to GDP, but with about 680 000 vehicles manufactured for export it could see some tough economic times ahead if it doesn\u2019t adapt, especially with many countries starting to set dates \u2013 mostly 2030 \u2013 for the complete ban of combustion engines.\n\n\u201cWe are not manufacturing any electric vehicles in South Africa and that\u2019s a challenge,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa is going to lose its principal markets of export [for motor vehicles],\u201d he adds.\n\nHastie agrees that South Africa\u2019s exports would need to contain EVs or some form of EV components, especially if local demand does not take off.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got the raw materials and minerals available in this country for both electric motors and batteries, so create a battery industry,\u201d Hastie says, but quickly notes that if South Africa is too reliant on exports and doesn\u2019t grow the local base, then this too will fail.\n\nUltimately, both agree there are opportunities for South Africa to learn from and even surpass other countries when it comes to EVs, especially with 5.1 million electric car sales globally last year, 2 million more than in 2017.\n\nThis trend only seems to be rising, and the sooner South Africa joins the movement the better \u2013 for the economy and for the environment.", "description": "With natural resources to manufacture electric vehicles, SA is best placed to lead the production of earth-friendly transportation and reap the vast rewards thereof.", "authors": ["Muhammad Hussain"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/217/2b94961f9cba4c229b7ab94a88642ef6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
