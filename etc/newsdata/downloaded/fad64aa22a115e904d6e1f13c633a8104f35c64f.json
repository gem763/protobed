This time, the siblings\u2019 ages are 4, 3, 2 and 1, but Lamont said he is up to the challenge of raising so many young ones on his own.\n\n\u201cI want to be the difference; make a difference by being a difference for these youths,\u201d he stated, adding that he will do anything in his power to give his children a bright future.\n\nIn March, Breitbart News reported that a single father who had already raised six adopted children was planning on adopting a seventh.\n\nJoe Toles, 60, from Queens, New York, said \u201cThere\u2019s never going to be the perfect time to start or expand your family. But this feels like the right thing to do.\u201d\n\nThe young man Toles adopted was a 20-year-old named Jhon, a native of the Dominican Republic who has special needs.\n\nToles said he grew up in the foster care system, so he knows what it is like to be a teenager and young adult searching for a forever family.\n\n\u201cIt takes work, but I make the effort in nurturing the relationships,\u201d the former guidance counselor said. \u201cUntil I took the plunge, I would never have understood the real difference it\u2019s made to all our lives. Love happens and it changes everything.\u201d\n\nToles said even though kids in foster care have a more likely chance of becoming homeless and dropping out of school, his experience was different thanks to a track coach he met during high school.\n\n\u201cThe coach said, \u2018I treat you the way you deserve to be treated,\u2019 and that\u2019s the way I raise my sons,\u201d he stated.", "description": "An adoptive father in Buffalo, New York, is making a huge difference in the lives of five siblings, all under the age of five.", "authors": ["Amy Furr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/young-children-at-play-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
