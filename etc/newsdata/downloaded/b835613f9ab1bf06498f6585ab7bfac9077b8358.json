I wish Antonio nothing but the best.\"\n\nBrown arrived in Oakland in an off-season trade after an acrimonious end to his tenure with the Pittsburgh Steelers, where he feuded with quarterback Ben Roethlisberger and was benched for the final game of last season.\n\nThe Raiders snapped him up with a three-year deal worth a reported $54.1 million.\n\n- 'New beginning' -\n\nThe 31-year-old seven-time Pro-Bowler was forced to miss two weeks of training camp in August after reporting for duty with frostbite on his feet, which he blamed on a cryotherapy mishap.\n\nHe vented angrily against the NFL over new safety regulations forcing players to switch to a new type of helmet.\n\nThe Raiders had welcomed Brown back into the fold on Friday, after he apologized for the dust-up with Mayock.\n\nBut after he was fined for conduct detrimental to the team, a sanction that would have cost him $30 million in guaranteed salary, Brown said he wanted out.\n\n\"I have worked my whole life to prove that the system is blind to see talent like mines (sic),\" Brown wrote on Instagram.\n\n\"Now that everyone sees it, they want me to conform to that same system that has failed me all those years. I'm not mad at anyone. I'm just asking for the freedom to prove them all wrong. Release me @raiders. #NOMore\"\n\nBrown's agent Drew Rosenhaus soon said that the player was \"looking forward to a new beginning\" and the Patriots could certainly be the team to supply that.\n\nNew England have a history of betting on star talent that has run afoul of other teams. This year their roster features wide receiver Josh Gordon, who was reinstated from indefinite suspension under the league's substance abuse policy in August.\n\nGordon and Brown now have a chance to prove themselves -- alongside stalwart receivers Julian Edelman and Demaryius Thomas -- as targets for one of the all-time greats in Brady.", "description": "Mercurial receiver Antonio Brown is reportedly headed to the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots, hours after he was cut by the Oakland Raiders before he could make his debut with the NFL stragglers.
