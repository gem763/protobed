CNN-affiliate 7 News said he had earlier been diagnosed with terminal esophagus and stomach cancer.\n\nMilat was sentenced to life behind bars in 1996 over a series of brutal killings in the Australian state of New South Wales. Known as the \"Backpacker Murders,\" the seven victims were men and women who were either tourists to Australia or were traveling through the area.\n\nThe victims were stabbed, shot or beaten to death, with one decapitated.
