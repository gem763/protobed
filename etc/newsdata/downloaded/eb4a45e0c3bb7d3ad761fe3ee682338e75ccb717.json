When I\u2019m having fun, I\u2019m the best in the world.\u201d\n\nAdesanya\u2019s slick striking style has played its part in a host of exciting octagon encounters already in his career, but the 30-year-old said he wanted to make his fight feel even bigger, and revisited his for a dance routine that had previously been rejected at one of his earlier fights.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a dancer. I\u2019m an entertainer. I don\u2019t have to worry about it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe came up with that on Wednesday. I tried to do it at the (Anderson) Silva fight in February and the UFC was like, \u2018No, we can\u2019t have that.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018Oh. (Expletive) you, then.\u2019\n\n\u201cAnd then (for) this fight, this is my show, I\u2019m headlining this (expletive). So I was like, \u2018No. I\u2019m going to do it my way, or no way.'\u201d\n\nAdesanya said he knew that his way of expressing himself would bring out the haters. But the self-confident New Zealander said he won\u2019t temper his enthusiasm for his career to appease the doubters.\n\n\u201cNo one is doing anything like I\u2019m doing,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a 60,000-seat arena. People, after seeing that entrance, I bet you the green-eyed monsters were like, \u2018I (expletive) hope this guy loses.\u2019 I\u2019m sure some of you in here, as well. \u2018Ah. This (expletive). Look at him, he thinks he\u2019s the (expletive), man. I hope he loses. I hope he gets flatlined.\u2019\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ingrained in us. It\u2019s this tall poppy syndrome. It\u2019s this jealousy that we see someone shining, you feel it takes away from your own shine. I\u2019m like, \u2018Look, I can\u2019t dim my shine just because some people feel uncomfortable.'\u201d\n\nAdesanya said he was happy to push the envelope, citing a pair of his contemporaries as inspiration for his dance-routine entrance.\n\n\u201cWho else on this kind of stage is going to do that before they go and whup some ass? I think James Te Huna is the only one who\u2019s ever done it, from what I can remember, with the \u2018Men in Black\u2019 intro, and Anderson Silva did it in PRIDE with his Michael Jackson (expletive).\u201d\n\nHe also had a tongue-in-cheek word for one of the world\u2019s biggest pop stars.\n\n\u201cIf I could sing, trust me, Justin Bieber wouldn\u2019t even have a job! But, ha! You don\u2019t want to hear me sing.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to realize \u2013 this is a spectacle, this is a big stadium. I had to give them a show and set the tone. There\u2019s no one like me.
