Others have focused on the rise in clean-energy-related jobs put out by the U.S. Department of Energy or state sources, but those fail to provide the whole picture.\n\nThat's why Maslin and lead author Lucien Georgeson accumulated their own data on the U.S. green economy, drawing on hundreds of often private databases containing granular, real-world business and transaction statistics.\n\nThey concluded that almost 9.5 million Americans, or about 4% of the workforce, are employed in a \"green economy\" that generates $1.31 trillion in annual revenue, or about 7% of U.S. annual GDP.\n\nThat's about 16.5% of the green economy worldwide, according to the analysis published in Palgrave Communications.\n\nThe numbers rose more than 20% over the 2013-2016 fiscal years, led by the renewable energy sector. Growth was also seen in already established environmental businesses, including air pollution, recycling and waste management, land remediation and water treatment.\n\nWhat the analysis calls \"low-carbon\" sectors - including electric vehicles, energy efficiency, and green finance - are making an up-and-coming contribution as well.\n\nWhen the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics collected data on the nation's green economy, it did so through a survey of businesses, which left judgment of what's green to respondents.\n\nBy using transaction data, the researchers said they are able to determine what fraction of a company's sales are green. Their bottom-up, transaction-based method also makes it much easier to compare nations' various efforts.\n\nThe U.S. is ahead of China and other nations, but its lead may not last as other nations align national and state-level policies with green growth.\n\nNext steps for the research include updating the findings beyond 2016, and eventually applying their database-diving approach to assemble a better picture of global green trade.", "description": "National database for clean business says American industry is leading the way, but suggests China is not far behind.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/15/6cad6cec3beb48d3896762f0fc381361_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
