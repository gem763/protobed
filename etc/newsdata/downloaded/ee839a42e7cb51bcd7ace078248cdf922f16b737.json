Although the biggest takeaway from Kelly\u2019s memoir is that Queen Elizabeth has a lot of personality, the forthcoming book also reveals five surprising royal secrets. Read on to find out what hot goss Kelly\u2019s book includes.\n\n1. That Iconic Michelle Obama Hug\n\nAlthough many speculated that the former First Lady broke royal protocol when she hugged Her Majesty during their pre G-20 summit rendezvous in 2009, Kelly reveals that the queen actually welcomed the greeting. Kelly wrote that the queen saw it as \u201ca natural instinct to show affection and respect for another great woman.\u201d The more you know.\n\n2. Her Majesty\u2019s James Bond Cameo\n\nThe 2012 Olympics opened with a shocking (but super funny) video in which Her Majesty met James Bond (Daniel Craig) and jumped out of a helicopter on a special mission. As it turns out, the queen said she would only agree to be a part of the video if she could utter her iconic line: \u201cGood evening, Mr. Bond.\u201d\n\n3. If the Shoe Fits\u2026\n\nEver wonder why Queen Elizabeth\u2019s shoes never seem to bother her? Well, the monarch avoids blisters and barking dogs thanks to Kelly, who personally wears her new shoes in order to stretch them out. Why? Well, they wear the same shoe size and Her Majesty simply doesn\u2019t have the time to stretch her own shoes out. Fair.\n\n4. The Royal Christening Tea\n\nYou know that iconic christening robe that all modern royals have been baptized in? It\u2019s a replica modeled after Queen Victoria\u2019s daughter\u2019s gown, which was first worn in 1841. To recreate the antique coloring, Kelly dyed the remake in cold tea.\n\n5. She\u2019s in on the Joke\n\nQueen Elizabeth may come off as deferential and serious in public, but in private she loves a good joke. One April Fool\u2019s Day, Kelly planted a toy stuffed bird on the queen\u2019s balcony and pretended it was dead. When Queen Elizabeth learned that Kelly was joking with her, she dished it right back and said she\u2019d fire her. Spoiler alert: She didn\u2019t.\n\nYou never stop surprising us, Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nRELATED: The Royal Family Just Announced Deets on Prince Charles\u2019s Next Big Tour\u2014Here\u2019s Everything We Know", "description": "ICYMI: Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s longtime personal assistant and senior dresser, Angela Kelly, just majorly spilled the royal tea (with the...", "authors": ["Editor Purewow.Com", "Purewow"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/r9RSku0LR1o81Tvjdrq2gQ--~B/aD00NTY7dz01OTQ7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/purewow_185/cc4cd89833b95195064bce186d55c5a0", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
