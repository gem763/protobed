Anything other than victory against host Japan in Yokohama Sunday will see the Scots eliminated before the knockout stages.\n\nBut the arrival of Typhoon Hagibis could cause the game to be called off, meaning the result would go down as a 0-0 draw.\n\nThat would suit Japan, which is top of Pool A on 14 points, but consign third-placed Scotland to an early flight home. Ireland, which takes on Samoa Saturday, is second on 11 points with the top two teams going through.\n\nWith hopes hanging by a thread, Scotland coach Gregor Townsend has pleaded with organizers to ensure the game goes ahead.\n\n\"I hope everyone involved in the tournament wants the game to be played and will do their utmost for the game to be played,\" Townsend told reporters Thursday.\n\n\"I have looked at the weather and Sunday night is meant to be nice and calm.\n\n\"Now what may happen is infrastructure may not be in place, even though the weather is nice. We have got to believe, and have faith in the organizers, that the game will be played, even if it is behind closed doors or played at a different venue.\"\n\nScotland's head coach Gregor Townsend is hopeful his team's match against Japan will go ahead.\n\nDesperate times for the Scots\n\nBecause of the impending typhoon, Saturday's fixtures involving New Zealand and Italy as well as England's match against France have already been called off.\n\nItaly's fate -- and that of the three other teams whose games were canceled -- had already been sealed so there are major repercussions.\n\nBut Italy's captain Sergio Parisse criticized World Rugby after his tournament came to a disappointing end, saying: \"If New Zealand needed four or five points against us [the match] would not have been canceled.\"\n\nTownsend, however, refused to speculate when asked if he had any doubts the game would go ahead given the fact that host Japan would progress if not.\n\n\"No, you can't,\" he said. \"This is a Rugby World Cup, the biggest tournament we play in once every four years, the third biggest sporting event in the world. Obviously, we are involved in a game where a winner can go through, or a winner with a certain number of points could go through and the loser not go through.\n\n\"I'm sure that has been in the minds of those who arranged the fixtures as well as the weather forecast for the next two or three days.\"\n\nScotland's fly-half Adam Hastings (center) in action against Russia.\n\nKeeping faith\n\nHagibis is expected to make landfall Saturday and experts have warned that it could potentially be more powerful than Typhoon Ida, which caused widespread destruction in 1958.\n\nBut Townsend added: \"It would make things very unusual for any World Cup in any sport to be decided by the game being called off on one day.\n\n\"If we are looking outside the hotel window on Sunday and it's sunny, it would be quite strange if a game could not be played that day or the next day.\n\n\"If they have made the decision that the game will still be played in Yokohama, they must be pretty certain that the game will go ahead.\"\n\nJapanese players celebrate their victory over Ireland. Another win will secure top spot in Pool A.\n\nToo close to call\n\nScotland has had less time to prepare for the game than Japan. The host was last in action on October 5 in a 38-19 win over Samoa while Scotland routed Russia 61-0 Wednesday.\n\n\"We know this is a tight turnaround,\" Townsend said. \"Japan have had a good rest going into this game, like they have for all their games. We have always known we would have a three day turnaround. The players have had a meeting today. We will have another meeting tonight. They are firmly focused on what we need to do to win this game.\"\n\nWith one eye on the training field and the other fixed on a weather app, Townsend faces his toughest assignment yet as Scotland coach.\n\nIn the past, a run out against Japan would constitute an almost certain walk-over.", "description": "Scotland faces a premature exit from the Rugby World Cup.
