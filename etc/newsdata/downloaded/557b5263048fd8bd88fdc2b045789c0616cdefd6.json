He gave an exclusive interview to PJMedia's Megan Fox when it happened.\n\nSabo posted the following image with his announcement about PayPal.\n\n\"My wife had warned me about doing business with PayPal,\" the artist told PJM. \"I'd constantly tell her that they provided a great service which makes starting an online store easy.\"\n\n\"I trusted them,\" he explained. \"I worked in the start-ups for many years and it sucks to see what they've become. The people of PayPal obviously haven't taken note of how many once-giants are less than memories now. Their time will come soon as well. When it comes to the transfer of money, trust is paramount.\"\n\n\"They've lost that trust with me,\" he added. \"We are living in Orwellian times.\"\n\nSabo insists in his Facebook post that he will keep fighting to be able to earn a living. \"We'll find an alternative way to generate income and I'm sure they will work to hit that as well. And then we'll find another.\" He also said he expected this would happen. \"2020 is right around the corner and they are doing everything they can to silence our side. At least they finally did it so now I can move on.\"\n\n_____\n\nMatt Margolis is the author of Trumping Obama: How President Trump Saved Us From Barack Obama's Legacy and the bestselling book The Worst President in History: The Legacy of Barack Obama.
