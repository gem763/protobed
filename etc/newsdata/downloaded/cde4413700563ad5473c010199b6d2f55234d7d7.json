What must we do, so that you can stop this culling?'\u201d\n\nAs CBC describes it, Eltahawy\u2019s new book calls for women to \u201charness anger, attention-seeking, ambition, power, profanity, lust and violence in order to truly be liberated from what she describes as the \u2018tentacles of the octopus known as patriarchy.'\u201d\n\nIn her interview with the broadcaster, Eltahawy said \u201cI want people to imagine patriarchy as an octopus. The head of that octopus is patriarchy because that is the ideology that moves the eight tentacles of the octopus. And each one of those tentacles is what we call systems of oppression, or various institutions that oppress us. So it would be white supremacy, capitalism, misogyny, homophobia, bigotry, ableism, things like that.\u201d\n\nI want people to understand that patriarchy is not men,\u201d she caveated. \u201cI\u2019m talking about an ideology that uses systems of institutions and oppressions to privilege male dominance.\u201d\n\nAfter insisting that \u201cpatriarchy\u201d is not men, she went on to \u201cimagine\u201d killing a certain number of men a week in order to fight against it.\n\nEltahawy hit back at women who criticized her for defending violence, saying that those who did so were \u201cmore upset and disturbed at the imaginary scenario of violence against your sons than the actual violence that is committed every day against your daughters or someone else\u2019s daughter\u201d \u2014 excluding the possibility that they might simply object to violence in general.\n\nFar from living under a mythical patriarchy that oppresses women, a recent study has shown that both men and women are more likely to prioritize women\u2019s welfare above that of men, and are more reluctant to harm women compared to men.\n\nAre you an insider at Google, Facebook, Twitter or any other tech company who wants to confidentially reveal wrongdoing or political bias at your company?
