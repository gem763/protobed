Sign up here.\n\nHappy Friday everyone,\n\nSeptember is officially upon us, which thankfully means cooler weather and the oft-cited \"Fall Sprint\" in media circles.\n\nA bit of bad news, however: I was really excited for some big, quality hurricane-fueled surf out at Rockaway Beach this weekend \u2014 forecasts like this are once in a blue moon for the East Coast. Unfortunately, Mayor De Blasio's office has other ideas and has closed all New York City beaches to surfing this weekend over concerns about rip currents.\n\nYour friendly cannabis industry reporter is pretty bummed about that.\n\nAnyway, let's get to it:\n\nOn Thursday, we held our inaugural cannabis industry webinar with Headset CEO Cy Scott, joined by Poseidon Asset Management Partners Emily and Morgan Paxhia.\n\nIn the webinar, Scott walked us through his tips for crafting the perfect pitch deck to hook potential investors. Headset raised a $12 million Series A earlier this year, led by Poseidon.\n\nYou can watch the webinar in its entirety here.\n\nIn other news, vaping related illnesses and deaths continued to climb over the week. Regulators and doctors are still unsure of the root cause of these, but it appears that the illnesses stem from both nicotine-containing vapes, as well as THC-containing vapes.\n\nAnd it's not yet clear whether illicit vapes are solely to blame, as state health officials in Oregon confirmed that a middle-aged man had died after purchasing cannabis oil from a regulated dispensary. Former FDA chief Scott Gottlieb has an editorial in The Washington Post going over the dangers of vaping both nicotine and THC.\n\nOn the Canadian cannabis front, CannTrust's woes continue. A recent report from BNN Bloomberg found that senior staff at CannTrust brought illicit cannabis seeds into their licensed production facilities, resulting in illegally-grown pot entering the regulated market.\n\nThe company has since laid off 20% of its staff\u2014 or 180 people \u2014 as it restructures in light of all the recent turmoil\n\nIn (slightly) more upbeat news, I had the pleasure of sitting down with Brendan Kennedy, Tilray's CEO, in BI's Manhattan offices on Wednesday where he laid out his view of the cannabis landscape. Cowen analyst Vivien Azer slashed her price target on Tilray by 60% but still maintained her outperform rating on the stock.\n\nMore stories from around the BI newsroom:\n\nCannabis companies are growing rapidly. They're a great place to look for jobs, from entry-level retail positions all the way up to senior management.\n\nTo get a sense of how to best land a job in the booming industry, Business Insider spoke with some of the top recruiters in the cannabis world.\n\nThey told us their best tips \u2014 and explained why being passionate about cannabis isn't enough to land a new role.\n\nThe CEO of Headset, a data-analytics provider for the cannabis industry, revealed his key advice for making a successful pitch to potential investors.\n\nScott emphasized the importance of having a clear and concise mission statement that \"aligns everyone to the organization\" and hooks investors.\n\nThe company recently brought in $12 million from its series A funding round.\n\nThis one is from my colleague Hilary Brueck on Insider's science and health team, who has been doggedly covering the vape illness story all week.\n\nOn Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said more than 450 \"possible cases\" of vaping-related lung illnesses have been tallied so far. At least four people have died after vaping.\n\nMany of the cases involve vaping THC and other cannabinoids, but some happened after vapers inhaled only nicotine.\n\nThe safest thing to do, the CDC says, is \"consider not using e-cigarettes.\"\n\nCapital raises, M&A activity, partnerships, and launches", "description": "In this edition, we talked to recruiters about how to land your dream job in cannabis, walk through Headset's pitch deck with CEO Cy Scott, and more.", "authors": ["Jeremy Berke"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d72a06d2e22af25354af38d-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
