But it's a very real thing to be going through behind the scenes.'\n\nShe added: 'I'm the first one to go, 'oh my gosh I'm so sorry I would never do that.' When people are saying things that are just untrue and they have been told they are untrue but they are allowed to still say them, I don't know anybody in the world that would feel like that's okay. And that's different to just scrutiny.'\n\nThe programme came after Prince Harry announced he planned sue the Mail On Sunday, referring to his late mother Princess Diana as he explained: 'Though this action may not be the safe one, it is the right one.\n\n'Because my deepest fear is history repeating itself. I\u2019ve seen what happens when someone I love is commoditised to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person. I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces.'", "description": "Author and mental health advocate Matt Haig has slammed critics who dismiss the Duchess of Sussex's feelings with the argument that she is 'rich and famous'.", "authors": ["Jessica Rach For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/10/20275502-0-image-a-14_1572260279949.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
