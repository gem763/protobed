No excuse...just stop and do better.\"\n\n(Image: Rachel McCollin/McLean/Twitter)\n\nAuthor Lissa Evans blasted: \"Oh God, so we haven't moved on *one inch*, have we?\n\n\"Pathetic, embarrassing and counter-productive - sack your marketing team.\"\n\nAnother fan added: \"\u2018Just\u2019 being the \u2018the best mum in the world\u2019 is deemed to be less worthy than being \u2018really good at stuff\u2019?\n\nThe BBC Springwatch account said they were \"sorry for any offence caused\" in a reply to Rachel.\n\nThey tweeted: \"Hi Rachel, we are very sorry for any offence caused by these products as this was absolutely not our intention.\n\n\"We are sensitive to feedback and will pass your concerns over to our buying team for review.\"\n\nBut other fans of the show defended the packaging, with one social media user dubbing it a \"snowflake society comment.\"\n\nAnd dad Gary Waddison dubbed the complaint ridiculous.\n\nHe posted: \"What a ridiculous complaint. Lots of ladies and girls would love a \u2018girly\u2019 pink bird box.\n\n\"Perhaps they should sell gender neutral bird boxes for the permanently offended.\"\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nIt comes as the Beeb finds itself plunged into a row over claims of equal pay with presenter Samira Ahmed.\n\nThe presenter, 51, who works on TV and radio, says she was paid considerably less than Jeremy Vine.\n\nEarlier this week, the National Union of Journalist revealed she was paid \u00a3465 for every episode of BBC News show Newswatch, while Vine received up to \u00a33,000 an episode of Points Of View.\n\nThe row is set to be discussed in an employment tribunal starting today in which Ms Ahmen is set to describe the work as comparable, which the BBC denies.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Kits for women are pink and designed for \"the best mum in the world\", while men have a brown kit which says \"because dad's are really good at this\"", "authors": ["Rosaleen Fenton", "Image", "Shared Content Unit", "Rachel Mccollin Mclean Twitter", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20755233.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_dBR_SCU_110619corgi_04.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
