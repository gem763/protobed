A photo opportunity was being arranged by the White House press team.\n\nThe family resisted Trump\u2019s pressure to have a meeting, saying it was not appropriate to do so at such short notice and they wanted Sacoolas to return to the UK to help with the police investigation.\n\nLawyers for the Dunn family accused the White House of being directed by the national security adviser, Robert O\u2019Brien, who they described as a \u201cnincompoop\u201d. More private efforts at arranging a meeting are under way.", "description": "Boris Johnson unaware of plan for meeting with Harry Dunn\u2019s family, says spokeswoman", "authors": ["Patrick Wintour", "Barbara Ellen"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f89ea440718ba41f9ded5950eea322bda5b82282/0_114_4008_2405/master/4008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d436f8e9529c6f2162bff31cb74f61a7", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
