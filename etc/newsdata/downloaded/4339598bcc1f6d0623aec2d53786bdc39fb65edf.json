REUTERS/Toru Hanai\n\nAnalysts said investor sentiment was fragile with civil unrest in Hong Kong, tensions in the Middle East and worries over whether the United States and China would sign a trade deal soon. Moves were further exaggerated by low volumes as Japanese markets were shut for a public holiday.\n\nChinese shares opened in the negative territory, with the blue-chip index .CSI300 down 1.5%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index .HSI was 0.8% weaker after a weekend of sometimes violent protests that saw pro-democracy activists vandalise a railway station and shopping mall.\n\nSouth Korea's Kospi .KS11 was a touch weaker after disappointing trade data while Australian and New Zealand shares bucked the trend and were both about 0.3% higher.\n\nThat left MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS down 0.3% at 509.94 points. It is still up more than 3% so far in September.\n\n\u201cThere are real concerns about the impact on economies from the trade dispute,\u201d said Michael McCarthy, Sydney-based strategist at CMC Markets. \u201cPeople are probably getting an idea that this will be a long negotiation. And the longer it lingers the more impact it will have economically.\u201d\n\nE-mini futures for U.S. S&P 500 ESc1 and the Dow 1YMc1, however, climbed nearly 0.4% each.\n\nOver the weekend, the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s office issued a brief statement characterising the two days of talks with China as \u201cproductive.\u201d It added that a principal-level trade meeting in Washington would take place in October, as previously planned.\n\nChina\u2019s Commerce Ministry, in a brief statement, described the talks as \u201cconstructive\u201d, and said they had also had a good discussion on \u201cdetailed arrangements\u201d for the high-level talks in October.\n\nAdditionally, the United States removed tariffs from more than 400 Chinese products in response to requests from U.S. companies.\n\nDespite the improved tone, markets still remain unconvinced about the possibility of deal soon.\n\nInvestors were rattled by news on Friday that Chinese officials unexpectedly cancelled a visit to U.S. farms this week following their two days of negotiations in Washington.\n\nOne Shanghai-based analyst at Tebon Securities said the cancellation had hit investor sentiment and could be a major drag on Chinese A-shares in the near-term.\n\nNews that five Yemeni civilians were killed in air strikes by the Saudi-led coalition further soured investor appetite.\n\nOIL SHOCK\n\nMideast tensions and worries about oil supplies helped Brent crude LCOc1 futures jump 1%, or 64 cents, to $64.92 a barrel, while U.S. crude CLc1 futures rose 0.98%, or 57 cents, to $58.66 a barrel. [O/R]\n\nThe Pentagon has ordered additional troops to be deployed in the Gulf region to strengthen Saudi Arabia\u2019s air and missile defences following an attack on Saudi oil facilities.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday the additional troops are for \u201cdeterrence and defence\u201d and Washington aimed to avoid war with Iran.\n\nMarkets will closely watch September manufacturing activity surveys due from the United States and European Union later in the day for any signs of a rebound.\n\nAction in currency markets was muted.\n\nThe dollar gained 0.14% against the safe haven Japanese yen to 107.69 JPY= after easing 0.5% last week. The risk-sensitive Australian dollar AUD=D3 was up 0.24% at $0.6780.\n\nThe euro EUR=D3 was a shade higher as was the British pound GBP=. That left the dollar index .DXY slightly weaker at 98.449.\n\nWith risk appetite waning, spot gold XAU= pared early losses to be flat at $1,516.39 an ounce.", "description": "Most Asian share markets slipped on Monday as investors waited for more clarity on the Sino-U.S. trade talks after recent negotiations, while oil gained more than 1% as Middle East tensions remained elevated.", "authors": ["Swati Pandey", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1432767196&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M002", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
