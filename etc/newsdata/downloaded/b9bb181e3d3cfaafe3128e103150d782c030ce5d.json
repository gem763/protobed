Mr. Bolton left last week over differences with the president on a range of policy matters.\n\nMr. Trump said finalists for the job are Robert O\u2019Brien, a top hostage-affairs official with the State Department; Rick Waddell, a former deputy White House national security adviser; Lisa E. Gordon-Hagerty, Energy Department undersecretary for nuclear security; Fred Fleitz, who served as chief of staff and executive secretary on the National Security Council last year; and Keith Kellogg, who serves as national security adviser to Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nKeith Kellogg at the White House last year.

The new national security adviser will also take a leading role in finding a solution to the crisis in Venezuela, as well as the president\u2019s efforts to get North Korea to denuclearize.\n\nWrite to Vivian Salama at vivian.salama@wsj.com", "description": "President Trump revealed his short list for a new national security adviser, citing a number of current and former administration officials to succeed the recently departed John Bolton.", "authors": ["Vivian Salama", "Vivian.Salama Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107980/social", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
