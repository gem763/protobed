This was a 100-year effort. That\u2019s what\u2019s insane about this process.\n\n\"Your next step should be, early buy-in to Medicare for early retirees and then take on the fact that President Trump\u2019s budget has the largest cut in Medicare ever,\" Emanuel continued.\n\nEmanuel's comments came after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., came out against a \"Medicare-for-all\" system last month and cautioned 2020 presidential candidates against embracing the idea.\n\nPELOSI COMES OUT AGAINST 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL,' TELLS 2020 DEMOCRATS TO FOLLOW OBAMACARE BLUEPRINT\n\n\u201cWe think the right path is the Affordable Care Act,\" Pelosi said on CNBC's \"Mad Money,\" \"and that is a path to health care for all Americans.\"\n\nPelosi said when Democrats seize control of the presidency again, they can deliver on their more ambitious health-care promises.\n\n\"I always say to people, when we win, we can put everything on the table and see what it means in terms of benefits for the consumer, cost to them, and costs to business, to corporate America, which is paying a lot of their price, as well as cost to the federal government and local government,\" she said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThus far, Sens.
