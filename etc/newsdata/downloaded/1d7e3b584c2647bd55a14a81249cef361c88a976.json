So, we are now consulting about whether it\u2019s better to go long, therefore, rather than to go short.\u201d\n\nMcDonnell said Johnson was \u201cdemeaning the office of prime minister\u201d by suggesting it was cowardice that was preventing an election. \u201cI wish he would put aside Donald Trump\u2019s script for a time and have a serious discussion,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe want a general election as well but we want it in the interests of the country when we have prevented a no-deal Brexit, and on that basis we have got to determine the date.\u201d\n\nMcDonnell said the party was consulting over the next few days about when the best time to hold the election would be.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking now at taking legal advice on how secure that bill is, but we\u2019re also consulting the other opposition parties, and our own party on the date of a general election,\u201d he said.\n\nSenior Labour figures, including Keir Starmer, have suggested that the election should not take place until the extension to Brexit has actually been secured, to ensure Johnson cannot repeal the legislation against no deal.\n\nMultiple Labour MPs have insisted the party must not back any election until after 31 October so that Johnson is forced to request the extension \u2013 a move the prime minister has repeatedly insisted he will not do.\n\nLabour MP Tonia Antoniazzi said on Twitter that a general election must be called after 31 October because \u201cthis PM is a Liar and the the UK will not be taken for fools\u201d.\n\nBen Bradshaw, the former Labour cabinet minister, said his call for an election was a \u201clast desperate throw of dice\u201d from which Labour should not rescue him.\n\n\u201cLabour and the other opposition parties must not save him, but ensure an election is only called after 31 October, when he will have failed completely,\u201d he said.\n\nShadow Foreign Office minister Helen Goodman said Johnson was \u201ctrying with his friends in the press to bully us into agreeing an election at a time which is not in the national interest\u201d.", "description": "John McDonnell acknowledges \u2018different views\u2019 on timing with MPs concerned that PM will ignore parliament", "authors": ["Jessica Elgot", "Owen Jones", "Zoe Williams"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e90218d7ed592ae9dd0202946eca22dbe3a61a69/0_0_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=903a6e88b6a0dc38ea22a63b3322bcfa", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
