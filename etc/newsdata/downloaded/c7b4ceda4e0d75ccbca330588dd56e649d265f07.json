Coleman did not immediately respond to phone and email messages Friday. Two messages were left at a phone number associated with Sanders seeking comment on Chanchez\u2019s accusation.\n\nOn Instagram, Chanchez, now 37, recounted an assault he said happened in Montgomery, Alabama, when he was around 14.\n\nHe said Sanders had been grooming him with explicit sexual banter. One day, he wrote, Sanders was giving him a ride home from his house when he detoured, pulled to the side of a dirt road and said he wanted to talk to Chanchez about his future.\n\n\u201cHe worked at a university so he said he\u2019s only looking out for me and my future. Then out of nowhere he said he wanted to see what the girls are going crazy over, then he reached over unzipped my pants and told me to trust him,\u201d Chanchez wrote.\n\nChanchez wrote that Sanders performed oral sex on him. Afterward, he said, Sanders ordered him to keep quiet about it. \u201cHe told me he\u2019s a very powerful man and if I\u2019d ever told anyone he would ruin my life and no one would believe me anyways,\u201d Chanchez wrote.\n\nHe said he buried the memory for decades.\n\n\u201cAs a man, a black man, I always thought acknowledging this would make me less of a man. I was afraid to be judged, talked about, laughed at or even worse \u2026 not believed at all.\u201d\n\nThe actor said Friday that he had not contemplated filing a police report in Alabama, but that he decided to speak out now in part to prevent Sanders from hurting anyone else: \u201cNo one will leave their kid around him now and say they didn\u2019t know that he\u2019s a pedophile.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press does not typically name people who say they are the victims of sexual assault unless they identify themselves publicly, as Chanchez has done.\n\nThe case at East Stroudsburg University, a state-run university in the Pocono Mountains, involved college-age accusers.\n\nThere, the former students said Sanders used his high-powered job to offer them gifts, scholarships and campus jobs, then sexually harassed or assaulted them, including with forced oral sex. The students\u2019 lawyer has portrayed Sanders, who is black, as a predator who targeted emotionally fragile black men from broken homes because he believed they would be less likely to report the abuse.\n\nThe state\u2019s investigation into Sanders, which led to his 2008 ouster from East Stroudsburg, found he \u201cexercised exceedingly poor judgment toward\u201d students and mishandled donor funds, according to his termination letter.\n\nSanders has never been charged with a crime and has always categorically denied sexually touching any of the men. A federal jury sided with the former university official in a 2014 lawsuit brought by the students.\n\nSanders, who faced a similar accusation of sexual misconduct when he worked at Stillman College in Alabama in the 1990s, filed a wrongful termination suit against the state of Pennsylvania last year. A federal judge dismissed it.\n\nThe accusers in the East Stroudsburg case saw Chanchez\u2019s post this week, said their attorney, Albert R. Murray Jr.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re sick about this. They have to relive it all over again,\u201d he said Friday.\n\nMurray, a former federal prosecutor, has long accused Pennsylvania authorities of a cover-up in the Sanders case, saying Sanders was never subject to a proper criminal investigation.\n\nPennsylvania\u2019s state university system - which is separate from Penn State University, whose former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky was convicted of child sexual abuse - has consistently refused to release its investigative report on Sanders. A spokesman said Chanchez\u2019s allegations have not changed its position.\n\nChanchez told the AP that he had been unaware of the Pennsylvania case but that he \u201cfigured that maybe I wasn\u2019t the only one.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Actor Hosea Chanchez says a friend's father sexually assaulted him in Alabama when he was 14 years old, identifying his abuser as a college administrator who later worked at a state university in Pennsylvania and faced accusations that he harassed and molested several male students.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Michael Rubinkam"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/06/sexual_misconduct-college_official-chanchez_67173_c0-274-2685-1839_s1770x1032.jpg?5055e78d4de8211f9e09796743a2060518b6890f", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
