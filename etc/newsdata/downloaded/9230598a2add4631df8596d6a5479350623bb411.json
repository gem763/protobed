Trebek says it can be hard to offer support to other people fighting similar cancer battles while going through one himself. \u201cA lot of people are coming to me and looking for help, reassurance, and that\u2019s tough,\u201d he explained, recalling a conversation with a woman distraught over her own new pancreatic cancer diagnosis. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m strong enough or intelligent enough to help alleviate some of that despair, so it\u2019s tough on me.\u201d\n\nBut as difficult as the past year has been for him, Alex Trebek seems hearteningly optimistic about his future, whatever that future might be. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of dying,\u201d he said. \u201cAs I told somebody the other day, one thing they\u2019re not gonna say at my funeral as a part of a eulogy: \u2018He was taken from us too soon.\u2019 I\u2019m 79 years old. So, hey, I\u2019ve lived a good life, a full life, and I\u2019m nearing the end of that life. I know that.\u201d Says Trebek. \u201cIf it happens, it happens. And why should I be afraid of it?\u201d Trebek has hosted Jeopardy! since 1984.", "description": "Alex Trebek opens up about his battle with Stage 4 pancreatic cancer and discusses his decision to keep hosting Jeopardy! in recent interview.", "authors": ["Halle Kiefer"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/26/8-Alex-Trebek.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
