It is feared that removing the weapons could signal the end of relations between the Nato allies, while leaving them in place could put the weapons of mass destruction at risk.\n\nThe conundrum comes just a month after Mr Erdogan said it was \u201cunacceptable\u201d that Turkey was not allowed its own supply of the weapons under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty the country signed in 1980.\n\nA phone call between Mr Trump and Mr Erdogan last week, and the US president's subsequent decision to withdraw from Syria after clearing out Isis-held territory, is said to have been described as an \u201coff script\u201d moment by American diplomats.\n\nAfter announcing the removal of troops to end America\u2019s \u201cendless wars\u201d, Mr Trump has been forced to repeatedly ramp up his rhetoric towards Turkey, calling for a ceasefire and slapping sanctions on top officials.\n\nBut this does not appear to have stopped the Turkish campaign.

Reports suggest dozens have died amid accusations of war crimes.\n\nMeanwhile Russia has been able to assert its dominance in parts of the country previously secured by the US, stepping into the void left by the country to serve as a power broker between Turkey and Syria.\n\nFollowing the withdrawal, the chair of the US Senate\u2019s armed services committee Jack Reed said: \u201cThis president keeps blindsiding our military and diplomatic leaders and partners with impulsive moves like this that benefit Russia and authoritarian regimes.\n\n\u201cIf this president were serious about ending wars and winning peace, he\u2019d actually articulate a strategy that would protect against a re-emergence of Isis and provide for the safety of our Syrian partners.\n\n\u201cBut he has repeatedly failed to do that. Instead, this is another example of Donald Trump creating chaos, undermining US interests, and benefiting Russia and the Assad regime.\u201d", "description": "An estimated 50 US nuclear bombs are effectively being held hostage in Turkey as Washington attempts to find a diplomatic way of responding to the country\u2019s invasion of Syria, officials are reported to have warned.
