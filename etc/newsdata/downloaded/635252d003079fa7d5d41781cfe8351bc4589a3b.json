If there\u2019s anything Hollywood wants out of Robert Evans, it\u2019s to see him fail.\u201d\n\nHollywood ultimately got its wish \u2013 and then some. The greased-haired, turtleneck-wearing Evans, the ultimate old-school movie boss caricature, was to eventually fall spectacularly.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nHe buckled not only beneath film failure and meteoric fortune loss in the 1980s \u2013 in 10 years he dropped from a worth of $11million to $37 \u2013 but also scandal as salacious than anything his films could muster.\n\nFirst, a drug addiction and a conviction for cocaine trafficking, and allegations of a real-life mob-style murder.\n\nThen too, there was the disastrous love life of the \u201cpeacock\u201d\u2013 no less than seven failed marriages, one lasting nine days, another destroyed by the advances of love rival Steve McQueen.\n\nFor the philanderer who ushered a string of leading ladies rumoured to include Grace Kelly and Raquel Welch beneath his mink bedspread, some would argue it was little less than he deserved.\n\nBut ultimately, when Evans died on Saturday aged 89, he wasn\u2019t a failure and wasn\u2019t disliked. Somehow, he had bounced back, with a best-selling autobiography and a revived film career.\n\n(Image: imdb)\n\n(Image: WireImage)\n\nDespite all the shenanigans, he was respected in the film industry as a legend. Perhaps it was because whatever else he was, he was always himself.\n\nOnce asked who his favourite character was, he replied: \u201cPopeye. \u2018I yam what I yam. That\u2019s all what I yam.\u2019\u201d\n\nBorn Robert J Shapira to a Jewish dentist in New York on June 29, 1930 \u2013 Evans was adopted in honour of his paternal grandmother\u2019s maiden name \u2013 he quickly warmed to the limelight.\n\nHe had a talent for mimicry, and aged 14 landed himself a slot on a radio show, and was later taken on as a trainee actor by Paramount. But he was dropped six months later and started selling women\u2019s trousers with his brother\u2019s clothing business.\n\nPerhaps the salesman in him was always his greatest gift. The business took off and he boasted \u201cwomen were responsible for making me a millionaire by my twenties\u201d.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\n(Image: Zoetrope Pictures)\n\nBut his big break into acting was still to come. In 1956, he was lounging by the pool at the Beverley Hills Hotel when he was spotted by MGM film star Norma Shearer who decided the good-looking lad was perfect to play her late husband, Irving Thalberg, in Man of a Thousand Faces.\n\nLater that year, Evans was also cast as a bullfighter alongside Ava Gardner in The Sun Also Rises.\n\nCocky Evans wasn\u2019t actually that good \u2013 even Ava wanted him dropped.\n\nBut director Darryl F Zanuck famously declared: \u201cThe kid stays in the picture\u201d \u2013 a tagline which would follow Evans for the rest of his life.\n\nEvans, however, recognised his talents lay elsewhere and decided he \u201cwanted to be the guy who makes the decisions, not the guy who has the decisions made for him\u201d.\n\n(Image: Paramount)\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nHe craved Zanuck\u2019s power, and by 1966 had convinced Paramount to make him head of production.\n\nThe Odd Couple, then Rosemary\u2019s Baby \u2013 directed by Roman Polanski who he \u201cdiscovered\u201d \u2013 followed.\n\nThen came hits True Grit with John Wayne, Love Story with Ali MacGraw and Ryan O\u2019Neal, and Robert Redford\u2019s The Great Gatsby.\n\nEvans helped transform Paramount\u2019s fortunes, and the successes trailblazed a lavish lifestyle. A French Regency mansion in Beverly Hills came complete with a cinema where an English butler served guests including pals Jack Nicholson and Warren Beatty brandy \u2013 and the next morning reminded Evans of the names of the ladies who\u2019d slept over.\n\nMeanwhile, \u201cthe peacock\u201d was in and out of nuptials faster than directing suites. He once cockily described himself as a \u201cladies\u2019 man\u201d who was sensitive to \u201ca \u2018void\u2019 most women share\u201d \u2013 the need for \u201ca male embracer \u2013 not sex, affirmation\u201d. Actress wives Sharon Hugueny and Camilla Sparv came and went. But number three, actress Ali MacGraw, star of Love Story, and mother of Evans\u2019 son Josh, was thought to be the love of his life.\n\n\u201cHer lethal embrace, her extraordinary affection, love, affirmation, fetching femininity, caress to family and friends, gave me an adrenaline I never thought I had,\u201d said Evans. They married in 1969, but she left him after falling under Steve McQueen\u2019s spell on the set of The Getaway in 1972.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\n(Image: GC Images)\n\nBizarrely, Evans, ever the social animal, was pals with Henry Kissinger, who reportedly said: \u201cIf I can negotiate with the North Vietnamese I think I can smooth the way with Ali.\u201d\n\nBut Evans stoically replied: \u201cHenry, you know countries but you don\u2019t know women. When it\u2019s over, it\u2019s over.\u201d\n\nWife No4 Miss America Phyllis George, lasted less than a year. And the fifth came 20 years later, and was the briefest of all \u2013 he and Dynasty actress Catherine Oxenberg met as he recovered from a stroke, and parted after just nine days, still pals.\n\nShe was followed by Leslie Ann Woodward, then Lady Victoria White, who divorced him in 2006.\n\nEvans wasn\u2019t too keen on monogamy, he admitted. Something Sylvester Stallone could attest to. He once claimed Evans told him they had something in common, then produced a \u201cvery X-rated polaroid\u201d of Stallone\u2019s girlfriend, naked.\n\nBut while his love life was chequered, Evans\u2019 career continued to be golden for a while.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nThe Godfather, for which he insisted on hiring mainly Italian-Americans \u2013 \u201cI want to smell the spaghetti\u201d \u2013 became the No.1 hit of 1972, winning three Academy Awards.\n\nIt was Evans\u2019 influential mob fixer pal, Sidney Korshak, once an advisor to gangster Al Capone, who leant on the right people to get Al Pacino out of a contract at Evans\u2019 demand so he could star in it. With no choice, Pacino\u2019s agent yelled down the phone at Evans: \u201cThe midget\u2019s yours.\u201d\n\nAfter seven years with Paramount, Evans was itching to set up an independent studio, and became the first actor to do so. Movies like Chinatown and Marathon Man followed, but dogged by cocaine addiction, in 1980, he was implicated in a drug-buying bust, pleaded guilty to misdemeanour drug charges and was put on probation. He later said the episode turned his life \u201cto one of disgrace\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, films failed, most fabulously Harlem dance club film The Cotton Club. In 1983 its financial backer, Roy Radin, was murdered. His bullet-riddled body found stuffed with dynamite.\n\nEvans had been introduced to him by Karen DeLayne Greenberger, a West Coast cocaine trafficker, who he admitted to an affair with. In 1991 she and three others were found guilty of the murder. Evans was never charged but his reputation was ruined.\n\nHe recalled: \u201cThe lowest point of my life was being at my son Josh\u2019s graduation and the headline in the newspaper that day was that Bob Evans was involved in the Cotton Club murder.\u201d\n\nDepression followed, and he was forced to sell his estate \u2013 until pal Nicholson bought it back for him.\n\nThese failures didn\u2019t prove the end for Evans. In 1991 he returned to\n\nParamount, producing films including The Saint and his final credit, 2003\u2019s How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days. Evans then remarked: \u201cI\u2019m a little battered. But I like myself.
