Sarah Palin, whose husband, Todd Palin, has reportedly filed for divorce, once joked about the prospect in an email exchange, calling it a matter of \u201cwhen\u201d rather than \u201cif.\u201d\n\nThe apparent quip came to light in February 2012 when a trove of 17,000 records was released by state officials in response to a Freedom of Information Act request.\n\nWithin the mountain of files was an email sent September 2007 during her governorship to aides Kris Perry and Frank Bailey. Todd Palin, another one of her aides at the time, was copied.\n\n\u201cSo speaking of .... If we, er, when we get a divorce, does that quell \u2018conflict of interest\u2019 accusations about BP?\u201d she wrote, referring to her husband\u2019s work on the British oil company\u2019s North Pipeline.\n\n\u201cVERY funny,\u201d Bailey replied, indicating the remark was made in jest.\n\nThe day after HuffPost reported on the email, the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee\u2019s office said she was \u201cclearly speaking tongue-in-cheek.\u201d\n\nHowever, according to the Anchorage Daily News, Todd Palin filed for divorce on Friday, pointing to an \u201cincompatibility of temperament between the parties such that they find it impossible to live together as husband and wife.\u201d\n\nThe two have been married for 31 years.", "description": "Records released in 2012 by Alaska officials revealed the former governor and vice presidential candidate once quipped about the possibility in an email.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d76d4452300001005512987.jpeg?cache=8ib2wlrvae&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
