The creature was 20 feet long.\n\nAccording to a new study published in the journal PLOS One, these creatures' large jaws allowed them to chomp through tough foods like mature leaves, stems, and branches when other food sources were scarce.\n\nOnly one animal today has similar jaw bones and muscles: giant pandas, which also eat hard-to-chew, thick vegetation like bamboo shoots. In fact, the new research indicates, the kangaroo's jaw was more similar in shape and function to that of today's giant pandas than to modern-day kangaroos.\n\n\"In general, they would have appeared quite different to modern-day kangaroos, with more thick-set bodies, long muscular arms with extended fingers, often only a single big toe on each foot, and box-shaped heads that were shaped more like a koala's,\" study author D. Rex Mitchell told Newsweek.\n\ngiant kangaroo skull More\n\nMike Lee/South Australian Museum\n\nJaws like a giant panda's\n\nScientists already guessed that these giant kangaroos' jaws enabled them to consume hard-to-chew vegetation. Mitchell decided to test that theory by determining how much force the skull could resist.\n\nSo he created 3D digital models of a short-faced kangaroo skull and simulated the mechanical forces at play. Mitchell found that the giant cheekbones of this ancient animal supported large muscles that would have prevented the animal's jaw from dislocating during giant bites. The bones on the front and top of its skull formed an arch that helped keep the muscles from twisting.\n\nAccording to the study, the extinct kangaroo's physiology suggests that it had adapted to take advantage of foods that were difficult to chew more than any Australian herbivore alive today. Modern-day kangaroos, by contrast, prefer grasses, flowers, ferns, and moss.\n\nGiant panda More\n\nWang He/Getty Images\n\n\"The ability to consume parts of plants that other herbivores of the time could not would have offered them a competitive edge when times were tough,\" Mitchell said.", "description": "Extinct Australian kangaroos weighed more than 250 pounds and had powerful jaws to crunch through tough vegetation, much like today's giant pandas.", "authors": ["Aylin Woodward"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/sRs559PucItEL4kLkfjQ.Q--~B/aD01NDk7dz04MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/business_insider_articles_888/6402b9276ee656fb554dea9e1cbb34d3", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
