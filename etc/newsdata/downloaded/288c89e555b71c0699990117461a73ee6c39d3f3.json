The first panda was born at 6:54 p.m. and approximately one hour later, the second baby was born.\n\n\"Meng Meng became a mom \u2013 twice! We are so happy, we are speechless!\" the zoo wrote in the post.\n\nLOVABLE BABY DEER GETS BRIGHT PINK CAST AFTER BEING HIT BY CAR\n\nBreeding pandas in captivity is extremely difficult, according to the BBC. There are approximately 400 pandas living in zoos around the world, set up via conversation projects with China, the pandas' native country.\n\nAccording to the World Wildlife Fund, there are 1,864 pandas in the wild in China. At birth, the creatures are the size of a stick of butter, but can grow up to 330 pounds as an adult, the organization added. They subsist on diets made up of bamboo and have to eat between 26 to 84 pounds of it every day.\n\nMeng Meng has taken to her two new cubs, the zoo said. \"She placed the tiny creature gently on her belly and began to warm it lovingly with her big paws, warm breath, and the soft fur of her cheeks,\" the zoo told the Associated Press.\n\nThe sex of the babies is currently unknown, but it has been confirmed by the zoo that the cubs were 136 and 186 grams at birth, respectively.\n\nMeng Meng and her 9-year-old partner, Jiao Qing, are on loan from China, having arrived in Berlin in June 2017. In addition to mating with each other this past April, Meng Meng was also artificially inseminated to increase the likelihood of pregnancy.\n\nZoo Berlin said that Meng Meng and the babies would be out of sight from visitors until further notice, but Jiao Qing would continue to be on display.\n\nChina often donates pandas to zoos as a symbol of close relations with a country, the BBC added. There has been some speculation that U.S. zoos which have pandas could lose access to them due to the ongoing trade war between the two countries.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "A pair of panda cub twins were born at a zoo in Berlin, Germany over the weekend, the first time the exotic animal has been born in the country.", "authors": ["Chris Ciaccia"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/panda-cub-3.jpg"}
