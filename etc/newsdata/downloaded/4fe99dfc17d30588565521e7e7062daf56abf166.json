From Leonardo DiCaprio to Jason Momoa and activists like Greta Thunberg, everyone is appealing to the world leaders to not deny the science of climate change and address the issue with utmost importance.\n\nOn the other hand, in Mumbai, trees are being cut in huge numbers, to build a metro car shed in the Aarey Colony. People are coming out in huge numbers to protest against the same. Mumbai Police, in turn, has arrested 29 of them.\n\nMost of the people on social media are also expressing anger and these include Bollywood celebrities as well. From Varun Dhawan to Swara Bhasker, everyone took to social media to express their rage. Amid all this, Twinkle Khanna and Dia Mirza were trolled among other celebrities.\n\nIt all started after a social media user asked Karan Johar and Twinkle Khanna to give up their SUVs and start using Mumbai Locals instead. \"Hey twinkle, karan stop using your SUVs and start using local trains before preaching about environment.. okay?\", he wrote.\n\nThis is called Massacre! Wasting 24 lakh litre of water for a scene is called Massacre!!

Many people claim that Film City has encroached more of the Aarey Colony\u2019s area than what is being now encroached for metro shed. People on social media claimed that Bollywood is equally responsible for the destruction of Aarey Colony.\n\nThose who are giving lecture on 'safe environment'\n\nCan they please explain this?\n\nWe are support 'Aarey forest'\n\nBut before ,please explain this\ud83d\udc47\n\nHypocrites @karanjohar @ReallySwara@ShraddhaKapoor\n\n#ShutDownFilmCity pic.twitter.com/8D9s9loQrD \u2014 Proud to be an INDIAN (@noneedof_n) October 5, 2019\n\n#ShutDownFilmCity bollywood hyprocrites sitting in their 8 cylinder fuel guzzling SUV's talking about aarey when they are the worst offenders.
