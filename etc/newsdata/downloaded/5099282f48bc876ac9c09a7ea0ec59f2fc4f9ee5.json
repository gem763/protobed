However, it is also promising early adopters a $1.99/month fee for the first year of membership.\n\nTo start with, Play Pass will be limited to US-based subscribers, but the firm has suggested that it will be extended to other countries soon.\n\n\"Apple has worked really hard to curate some cutting-edge content of a very high quality,\" commented Ben Wood from the consultancy CCS Insight.\n\n\"But Google has been able to throw a wider net and get more titles.\n\n\"And that somewhat neutralises the threat that Apple Arcade could pose if someone was thinking about switching from iPhone to Android on that basis.\"\n\nImage copyright Google Image caption Play Pass contains a selection of child-centric content including Sago Mini and Toca Boca games\n\nIncluded apps highlighted by Google include:\n\nAccuweather - a weather-forecasting service that normally features ads and a variety of in-app fees ranging from 99 cents to $3.99\n\nStar Wars: Knights of the Old Republic - a sci-fi role-playing game that launched on Android in December 2014, which currently costs $9.99 to buy\n\nRisk - a digital version of the world domination board game, which usually charges up to $7.99 for in-app items\n\nPic Stitch - a program that turns a selection of photos into a collage, which normally charges $3.99 an item for additional content\n\nApple Arcade, by contrast, promises to deliver access to more than 100 \"new games\" that are not otherwise available on iOS, and in some cases cannot be bought for other platforms either.", "description": "It will charge $4.99 a month for access to more than 350 apps, posing a challenge to Apple Arcade.", "authors": ["Leo Kelion", "Technology Desk Editor"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/AD72/production/_108920444_b752aaa1-5587-4952-aaf7-1eb39db5ce79.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
