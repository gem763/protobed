Experts have since said amputations may have been wrongly blamed on a spider bite, and authorities now consider a bacterial infection to be responsible for the man\u2019s injuries. Despite this, the damage to the largely harmless white-tail may have been done.\n\nThe venom from the white-tailed spider is listed as non-lethal. It has not been shown to cause necrotic ulcers, which could result in the need for amputation. And there has never been any clear evidence necrotising arachnidism \u2013 the name give to a syndrome where the skin blisters and ulcerates following spider bites \u2013 has been seen in Australia.\n\nThere is currently no clinical test to determine if you have been bitten by a spider. And there is no blood or swab test that can be performed to positively identify what spider it is if a bite is suspected. Whether it is a bite from a spider or another insect, the management is the same \u2013 most will get better without any medical treatment.\n\nSpiders in Australia\n\nThe majority of spiders in Australia are voracious predators of insects. For the most part, they play a useful role in lowering insect numbers.\n\nThe venom transmitted through bites of some Australian spiders can cause harm to humans and even be life-threatening. The better known of these are the redback spider (Latrodectus hasselti), and the funnel-web spiders (genera Atrax and Hadronyche). Antivenom is available for both spiders.\n\nRedback spider venom can cause a lot of pain. Advice would be to go to hospital if pain lasts for longer than a few hours and simple pain relief is not helping. Funnel-web spider venom can cause local swelling in addition to increasing heartbeat, salivation, muscle spasms and respiratory distress (trouble breathing).\n\nWithout appropriate first aid, quick access to hospital and antivenom, these bites can be lethal. For the \u201cbig black hairy\u201d funnel-webs, appropriate first aid needs to be applied and it is advisable to call 000.", "description": "Recent news reports that a man had both his legs amputated after being bitten by a white-tailed spider have again cast this spider in a negative light.
