However, in a memo sent on Monday and obtained by the Daily Beast, G/O Media Editorial Director Paul Maidment informed Deadspin writers that they were to put their focus exclusively on sports.\n\nMaidment wrote:\n\nTo create as much great sports journalism as we can requires a 100% focus of our resources on sports. And it will be the sole focus. Deadspin will write only about sports and that which is relevant to sports in some way. Where such subjects touch on sports, they are fair game for Deadspin. Where they do not, they are not. We have plenty of other sites that write about politics, pop culture, the arts, and the rest, and they\u2019re the appropriate place for such work.\n\nAccording to the Daily Beast:\n\nDeadspin has often featured important politics and media articles, often in a subvertical titled The Concourse, and has poked fun at criticism of its decision to write about other non-sports topics, even selling \u201cStick to Sports\u201d merchandise on its site. But non-sports coverage has also often been a traffic-booster for the site. Sources have told The Daily Beast that, among other articles, writer David Roth\u2019s political commentary often tops the site\u2019s most-read articles, as has writer Drew Magary\u2019s annual hater\u2019s guide to the Williams-Sonoma holiday catalog. The tug-of-war over Deadpin\u2019s editorial mandate to stick to sports has been a long-running source of internal frustration and amusement for the site\u2019s staff.\n\nThat frustration has turned into a revolt among Deadspin staffers.\n\nOn Tuesday, the day after the directive was issued, the Deadspin began posting several stories that had no connection to sports whatsoever. As a result Deadspin Deputy Editor Barry Petchesky was fired.\n\n\u201cHi! I\u2019ve just been fired from Deadspin for not sticking to sports,\u201d Petchesky tweeted.\n\n\u201cTop postings on Tuesday included \u2018Woman Furiously S\u2014s on Floor of Tim Hortons, Throws it At Employees,\u2019 as well as \u2018What Did We Get Stuck in Our Rectums Last Year,\u2019 and \u2018The Hateful Life and Spiteful Death of the Man Who Was Vig the Carpatian,\u2019 the New York Post reports.\n\nPaul Maidment, the G/O editorial director who wrote the memo telling staffers to focus on sports, defended his company\u2019s stance in a statement issued Tuesday.\n\n\u201cYesterday I sent a memo to Deadspin staff stating that our sports site should be focused on sports coverage. As I made clear in that note, sports touches on nearly every aspect of life \u2014 from politics to business to pop culture and more. We believe that Deadspin reporters and editors should go after every conceivable story, as long as it has something to do with sports.\n\n\u201cWe are sorry that some on the Deadspin staff don\u2019t agree with that editorial direction and refuse to work within that incredibly broad mandate.\u201d\n\nThe Writers Guild of America East, the union to which Deadspin staffers belong, issued a strong rebuke to G/O Media over Petchesky\u2019s firing.\n\nEarlier today, @JimSpanfeller, CEO of G/O Media, fired our colleague and longtime Deadspin Deputy Editor Barry Petchesky. This will not stand. We will have updates soon. \u2014 GMG Union (@gmgunion) October 29, 2019\n\n\u201cThe revolt comes as aggressive cost cutting appears to have dramatically improved the company\u2019s finances. In early October, G/O Media said that the company actually posted a quarterly profit after laying off 25 staffers since Grey Hill Partners\u2019 April takeover. On October 10, the company also abruptly shut down its snarky web site Splinter, saying it did not see a long term path to profitability,\u201d the New York Post reports.\n\nFollow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter @themightygwinn", "description": "Deadspin has been given a new directive from their new managers: Stick to Sports.", "authors": ["Dylan Gwinn"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/John-Taggart_-The-Washington-Post-via-Getty-Images-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
