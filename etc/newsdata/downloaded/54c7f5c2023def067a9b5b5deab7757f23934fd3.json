The walk lasted 12 minutes and 9 seconds.\n\nDuring the mission, his spacesuit filled with air to the point where he struggled to get back into the spacecraft.\n\nHe flew in space a second time in 1975, as part of the historic Apollo-Soyuz mission, the first US-Soviet space flight, which occurred as the two superpowers were pursuing a policy of detente during the Cold War.\n\nLeonov trained as a military pilot before becoming a cosmonaut. He received a \u2018Hero of the Soviet Union\u2019 medal - one of the Russian state\u2019s most prestigious awards - twice and has a small crater on the Moon named after him.\n\nLeonov helped train other cosmonauts before retiring in 1992, a year after the Soviet Union collapsed. He devoted himself to private business and his twin passions of art and writing in later life.\n\nFollowing his walk in space, he was quoted as saying: \"The Earth was small, light blue, and so touchingly alone, our home that must be defended like a holy relic. The Earth was absolutely round. I believe I never knew what the word round meant until I saw Earth from space.\"\n\nAt the news of his death, tributes poured in from space organisations around the world, with NASA saying \"his venture into the vacuum of space began the history of extravehicular activity that makes today's Space Station maintenance possible\".\n\nThough not as well known around the world as the first man in space, Yuri Gagarin, Leonov was a household name in Russia.\n\nTass reports he died after battling a long illness.", "description": "The Russian cosmonaut flew in space twice as part of two historic missions.", "authors": ["Luke Hurst"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/22/43/40/1000x563_cmsv2_47d44484-1af8-5424-a12e-a18f7edca8b0-4224340.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
