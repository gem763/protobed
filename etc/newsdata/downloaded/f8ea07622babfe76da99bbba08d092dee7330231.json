REUTERS/Tyrone Siu/File Photo\n\nTAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan\u2019s export orders likely fell for an eleventh straight month in September but at a slower pace than the previous month, a Reuters poll showed, as weak demand for electronics continued to hurt the growth outlook for the island\u2019s manufacturers.\n\nThe median forecast from the poll of 13 economists was for export orders to drop 4.9% from a year earlier. The forecasts ranged widely from a decline of 1.2% to a sharp drop of 10.05%.\n\nOrders in August fell 8.3%, the most in five months, as tepid demand for smartphones outweighed an improving export outlook ahead of the peak year-end season for gadgets.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s export orders are a leading indicator of demand for Asia\u2019s exports and for hi-tech gadgets, and typically lead actual exports by two to three months.", "description": "Taiwan's export orders likely fell for an eleventh straight month in September but at a slower pace than the previous month, a Reuters poll showed, as weak demand for electronics continued to hurt the growth outlook for the island's manufacturers.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442160719&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H0AV", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
