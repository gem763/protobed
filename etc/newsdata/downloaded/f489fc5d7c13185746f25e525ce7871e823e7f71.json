Deshaun Watson has a great case to be right behind him.\n\nMahomes\u2019 Kansas City Chiefs and Watson\u2019s Houston Texans face off Sunday in what should be the most entertaining game of the day. Most Las Vegas sportsbooks have the over/under for Texans-Chiefs at 55 points, easily the largest total on the board this week. This is going to be an exciting matchup.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nAll of a sudden there are some questions about the Chiefs. They looked like the first- or second-best team in the NFL before last week, without much argument. Then the Indianapolis Colts came to Kansas City and pushed them around, handing the Chiefs their first loss of the season. Kansas City has a long injury list with some key players, though Tyreek Hill has a chance to return this week from a shoulder injury. Mahomes is banged up, too. He limped around on an ankle injury he aggravated twice against the Colts. The Chiefs won\u2019t be at full strength this week.\n\nThe Texans have been hard to predict, but they\u2019re coming off a great game. Watson threw for 426 yards, five touchdowns and no interceptions against an overmatched Atlanta Falcons defense in a 53-32 win last week. It was a perfect 158.3 passer rating. Among starting quarterbacks, Watson ranks second in the NFL in passer rating and Mahomes is third. Wilson leads the league.\n\nStory continues\n\nHouston is a 4.5-point underdog at Kansas City, and I like the Texans getting those points. The Chiefs have a ton of injuries and it showed last week. The Texans can score a ton, too, thanks to their dynamic quarterback, and I think Watson can at least keep it close. If nothing else, settle in for what should be the best quarterback matchup we\u2019ll see all season.\n\nHouston Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson (4) is coming off a huge game against the Falcons. (Getty Images)\n\nHere are the Week 6 NFL against-the-spread picks:\n\nSUPERCONTEST\n\nJaguars (-1.5) over Saints: This feels like a letdown spot for the Saints. They come out of a rough scheduling spot of tough teams or divisional rivals to face a Jaguars team that will be tough to get up for. Remember when it seemed the Saints would be in good shape if they went 3-3 without Drew Brees? Well, they\u2019ve already got the three wins without him. Jalen Ramsey\u2019s status is crucial here though, because he is one of the few cornerbacks who can reasonably cover Michael Thomas.\n\nFalcons (-2.5) over Cardinals: I understand the Falcons aren\u2019t good. Their defense in particular is bad. But the Cardinals are bad, too. Atlanta just has more top-end talent, and I don\u2019t see how the Cardinals slow them down. This could be a surprisingly entertaining game with a ton of points. And if the Falcons lose, I don\u2019t see how coach Dan Quinn has his job by Week 7.\n\nRedskins (-3.5) over Dolphins: Washington is bad. Really bad. But before you take the Dolphins here, remember that Miami has looked like the worst team in the NFL\u2019s modern era through the first quarter of the season.\n\n49ers (+3.5) over Rams: It\u2019s never the best idea to put too much stock into what we just saw. On Monday night, the 49ers looked incredible in blowing out the Browns. Recency bias can be intoxicating. But I\u2019m starting to believe in this 49ers team. They really are sound across the board. This is a fascinating matchup.\n\nBroncos (-2.5) over Titans: Let\u2019s imagine an alternate universe in which the Broncos didn\u2019t get bad roughing-the-passer penalties against the Bears or Jaguars, and they don\u2019t lose on last-second field goals. We\u2019d think a lot differently about a 3-2 Broncos team, right? The loss to the Raiders actually doesn\u2019t look too bad now. A loss at the Packers wasn\u2019t a blowout. Are the Broncos secretly kind of good?\n\nAnd here are the rest of the picks ...\n\nPatriots (-16.5) over Giants (picked Thursday): It has to say something about how good the Patriots are that they covered a spread this large and it still felt underwhelming. They really weren\u2019t at their best and it didn\u2019t matter.\n\nPanthers (-2) over Buccaneers: The early London game is back. Imagine if the Panthers had been able to punch in that fourth-down play late in the first meeting against Tampa Bay. Maybe they\u2019re sitting at 4-1 and we\u2019re looking at them as one of the NFL\u2019s best teams, even with Kyle Allen at quarterback. I like what I\u2019ve seen out of the Panthers. It\u2019s impressive how they\u2019ve turned their season around after an 0-2 start.\n\nSeahawks (-1.5) over Browns: Cleveland has been either bad or mediocre in four of five games. Seattle is clearly the better team in this matchup and it\u2019s not really close. It\u2019s a little strange how low the spread is.\n\nEagles (+3) over Vikings: We all know the drill by now. The Vikings beat bad teams and lose to good teams. The best win of the Kirk Cousins era in Minnesota was actually against the Eagles last season, though for most of last season the Eagles weren\u2019t good. Until the Vikings beat a good team, I\u2019ll just ride this pattern we have seen since the start of last season.\n\nBengals (+11.5) over Ravens: Do we know the Ravens are good? They blasted the Dolphins. Other than that? Their wins were relatively close ones against the Cardinals and the Steelers, who finished the game with their third-string quarterback and still went to overtime. The Ravens weren\u2019t all that close against the Chiefs and looked bad against the Browns, and that\u2019s Cleveland\u2019s only decent game of the season. The Bengals stink, but I really don\u2019t buy the Ravens right now.\n\nCowboys (-7) over Jets: Sam Darnold is back, but I wonder how much that bout with mono took out of him. And Dallas has handled business against bad teams.\n\nChargers (-7) over Steelers: I\u2019m sure the Steelers\u2019 doctors know what they\u2019re doing, and they can properly determine if Mason Rudolph should be cleared to play. But we all saw Rudolph gets knocked unconscious last week. It was one of the scariest injuries you\u2019ll see. The Steelers are 1-4. They have a bye next week. There\u2019s no reason for Rudolph to be rushed back for Sunday\u2019s game. Hopefully the Steelers play it safe with him.\n\nLions (+4) over Packers: Green Bay\u2019s passing offense without Davante Adams isn\u2019t great. I\u2019ll assume Lions coach Matt Patricia has a better game plan than the Cowboys did against the Adams-less Packers last week. This feels like a close Packers win.\n\nLast week: 7-8\n\nSeason to date: 41-38\n\nSuperContest: 1-3-1 last week, 10-14-1 season to date\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nFrank Schwab is a writer for Yahoo Sports.
