(Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)\n\nWe\u2019d all like to be a little happier.\n\nDeep down we know that true happiness probably comes from working through our issues, being nice to other people, finding a job that fulfills us, and getting rid of those massive worries like financial insecurity and climate change.\n\nBut that\u2019s quite a lot of work, so we\u2019d rather focus on quick, simple wins that people claim are the secrets to joy.\n\nSo, what can we do today to make ourselves happier?\n\nAccording to a new bit of research, we should be singing in the shower and forgiving our enemies. Easy.\n\nBupa Care Homes commissioned a survey of 2,000 adults to celebrate Silver Sunday, a nationwide event taking place on Sunday 6 October to help tackle loneliness (as loneliness doesn\u2019t make you happy, FYI).\n\nThis Sunday a load of Bupa homes will open their doors to host activities including roast dinners, pub quizzes, dances, and Mad Hatter\u2019s tea parties. If you\u2019re in need of something to bring some cheer to your day, you can check if a home near you is taking part.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut in the meantime, we can learn from what those who were surveyed said are the keys to happiness.\n\nAs you might expect, a lot of people said social connection is pretty important (handy, considering this survey is promoting that exact thing), as well as looking after your physical wellbeing and taking part in relaxing activities.\n\nHow many things are you ticking off?\n\nThe 40 secrets to happiness, according to the survey: Laughter Having a good relationship with your family Being fit and healthy Getting enough sleep Seeing your loved ones regularly Financial security Having a partner Getting regular exercise Being able to laugh at yourself Making others happy Eating healthily Being able to forgive yourself for your own mistakes Being polite Having a close friendship group Having a hobby Going on holiday at least once a year Being able to forgive others Falling in love at least once Having a pet Being kind to strangers Travelling the world and experiencing other cultures Spending time with the kids Living close to your family A good cup of tea Being a regular reader Feeling like part of a community An occasional tipple Saying hello/good morning/good afternoon etc to strangers Getting your five fruit and vegetables a day Knowing your neighbours Cooking/baking Having a successful job Indulging yourself in snacks/sweet treats Singing in the car/kitchen/shower Doing charitable work A busy social life Dancing Mum\u2019s cooking Calling home once a week Painting or drawing\n\nMORE: When I was diagnosed with cancer I told myself every day how amazing I am\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: Strong Women: \u2018Two of my friends took their own lives \u2013 now I\u2019m walking 1,000 miles to raise awareness\u2019\n\nMORE: Sex doll maker creates replicas of dead partners to combat loneliness: \u2018I\u2019m providing comfort\u2019\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Getting enough sleep, social connection, and painting are among the things that make you happy, according to a survey of 2,000 people.", "authors": ["Ellen Scott"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/feature-size_1570274677.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
