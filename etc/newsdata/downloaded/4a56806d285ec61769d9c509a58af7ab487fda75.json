I love that music, the first album I bought was Off The Wall.\u2019\n\nAddressing the serious allegations against the late musician, Peter explained: \u2018I have always said that we\u2019ve got to keep the music separate. The reason I say that, one is because if you\u2019re going to go there and say you can\u2019t listen to the music because there\u2019s allegations, do you listen to the music pre any supposed allegations, where do you go with it?\n\n\u2018Someone was listening to Rihanna the other day and there was a sample of a Michael Jackson song, and she was telling me she was unsure about listening to Michael Jackson. So where do you draw that line?\u2019\n\nPeter will play Jackson in Thriller for two weeks (Picture: Rex\n\nJackson\u2019s estate have vehemently denied Robson and Safechuck\u2019s allegations on the late singer\u2019s behalf.\n\nContinuing to defend his musical idol, Peter told Kate Garraway and Ben Shephard: \u2018This show is about the music.\n\n\u2018I always have to say that they are allegations.\n\n\u2018A friend of mine who loved R Kelly as much as they loved Michael Jackson, will not listen to R Kelly because they saw video footage, evidence, whatever the documentary was.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Mysterious Girl singer added: \u2018I think that might be where the difference is, is this is still based on allegations. It doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s no truth in it or you can in any way ignore it. But we\u2019re not at that point where we know what happened.\n\n\u2018I love the music, this is all about the music.\u2019\n\nGood Morning Britain airs weekdays on ITV at 6am.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
