In the meantime they have to be good players.\"\n\nRouhani said Tuesday that Iran would continue to scale back its commitments under the 2015 nuclear deal if sanctions were not lifted.\n\nThe United States reimposed sanctions on Iran after pulling out from the deal in 2018. In turn, Iran has increased enrichment of uranium and its stockpiles beyond the levels stipulated by the 2015 agreement.\n\n\"Our path is clear: if they return to their commitments, we will do the same, and we are looking after settling issues through the logical way,\" Rouhani said.", "description": "Renewed hopes for talks between US President Donald Trump and his Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhani were dealt a blow on Tuesday when Rouhani said there would be no meeting until economic sanctions imposed on Tehran are removed.", "authors": ["Mitchell Mccluskey", "Tara John"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190508072030-hasan-rohani-super-tease.jpg"}
