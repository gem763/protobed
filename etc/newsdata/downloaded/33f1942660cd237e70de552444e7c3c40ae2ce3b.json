Surveillance video footage of the incident, which occurred a little over a year ago, reportedly shows her writhing around on her small bed, covered in sweat, before giving birth to her son in the empty cell.\n\nOn Wednesday Diana Sanchez filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in Colorado, the Washington Post reports. The suit states that on July 31, 2018, rather than \u201censuring that Ms. Sanchez was able to give birth in a safe and sanitary setting,\u201d nurses and deputies \u201ccallously made her labor alone for hours,\u201d forcing her into a \u201chorrific experience.\u201d The Denver Sheriff\u2019s Department said that the 26-year-old had been taken into custody two weeks before she gave birth on charges related to identity theft.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that when Sanchez was booked, medical personnel noted that she was more than eight months pregnant. A little over two weeks later, according to the complaint, Sanchez told deputies and nurses that she was experiencing contractions \u201cat least eight times that morning.\u201d Shortly afterward, she notified a deputy that she had abdominal pain and her water had broken. A nurse requested a van to take Sanchez to the hospital at this time, but jail officials were reportedly aware that their protocol for acquiring the van could take \u201cmultiple hours.\u201d According to the complaint, video footage shows that only once Sanchez\u2019s baby was born did a man wearing surgical gloves enter the cell, apparently to inspect the infant. More than 30 minutes after she gave birth, Sanchez was taken to a hospital.\n\nSanchez filed her lawsuit after an internal investigation conducted by the Denver Sheriff Department cleared all the jail deputies of wrongdoing. The suit names as defendants the city and county of Denver and Denver Health Medical Center, as well as six individuals. Sanchez\u2019s lawyer Mari Newman told the Post that the fruitless investigation is \u201cemblematic of how broken the system really is \u2026 They claim to have done a review, and their conclusion is that nothing was wrong with the fact that a woman was never taken to the hospital and ended up giving birth in a dirty, cold, hard jail cell. It\u2019s really unfathomable.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the sheriff\u2019s department told KDVR on Wednesday that deputies were following protocol, which has since been amended.\n\nSanchez recounted her awful experience to KDVR last year, telling the local news outlet, \u201cThe pain is indescribable and what hurts me more though is that fact that nobody cared.\u201d She went on, \u201cThey put my son\u2019s life at risk \u2026 when I got to the hospital, [the doctors] said that I could have bled to death.\u201d", "description": "Diana Sanchez filed a lawsuit claiming she was forced to give birth in a jail cell alone and without medical care last year.", "authors": ["Hannah Gold"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/08/29/29-prison-cell.w1200.h630.jpg"}
