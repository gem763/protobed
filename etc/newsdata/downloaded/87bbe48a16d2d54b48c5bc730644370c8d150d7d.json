This sturdy umbrella is fully automatic and has a large vented canopy. It took us a lot of force to get it to invert, and it resisted both a light spray and driving rain in our tests. The fabric is very securely attached to the spokes, too. Though not the lightest umbrella we tested (it weighs in at just under a pound), we still found this model comfortable to carry. The Samsonite comes in red and black.\n\nWarranty: Limited 10 years (defects only)\n\nLength: 11.6 in.\n\nWeight: 0.82 lbs.\n\nReviewed: April 2013\n\nPrice When Reviewed: $30.00", "description": "For an umbrella that should survive plenty of spring showers, be sure to check out the Samsonite Windguard Auto Open Close", "authors": ["The Good Housekeeping Institute"], "top_image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/ghk.h-cdn.co/assets/cm/15/11/55007cbae1554-samsonite-windguard-auto-open-close-umbrella-mdn.jpg?crop=1xw:0.5xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2013-06-06"}
