And the fact of the matter is, Hillary Clinton has a right to be upset. The Russians did a full-throttle attack on her, and the entire intelligence community agreed, all 17 entities, with a high level of certainty, that the Russians attacked her, they attacked the democratic process to help \u2013.\u201d\n\nHost Erin Burnett then cut in to ask, \u201cDoes that justify what she did, though, to Congresswoman Gabbard?\u201d\n\nQuigley responded, \u201cI have no idea whether or not that\u2019s accurate. I can only reflect on the matters that have been before me that I have knowledge of. If it\u2019s accurate, she has every right to confront her with that. And the Russians will try to make an asset of anyone that they possibly can.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "description": "On Monday's broadcast of CNN's \"OutFront,\" Representative Mike Quigley (D-IL) stated that he has \"no idea\" whether or not former Secretary of State | Clips", "authors": ["Ian Hanchett"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/04/Quigley-44-Thumbnail-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
