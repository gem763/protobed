That gives Apollo a chance to buy those companies at very appealing prices.\n\nHarris said that, overall, companies on public stock markets trade at double-digit multiples compared with their respective earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), a critical measurement of how profitable that company is. But Apollo's last fund was made up of companies it acquired for just six times their EBITDA over the past three years.\n\nWhy was the fund able to pay a price that low for promising companies? Harris offered several reasons.\n\n1) The average investor struggles to analyze complicated companies\n\nThe most critical reason may be that the public is reluctant to back complex businesses.\n\n\"We've been able to buy great companies really well, really cheaply, because they've been misvalued by the public markets because they don't fit in a box,\" he said. \"If you don't fit the box in the public markets, you can't raise money.\"\n\nAs an example, he mentioned Smart & Final, a company Apollo bought in June for $1.1 billion. He argued that investors weren't sure how to evaluate the company, which included both a warehouse-style grocery store and a food-service business.\n\n\"More and more, the public markets are suited for simple companies' growth, things that are easy to understand,\" he said. \"We were able to buy it at six times cash flow.\"\n\nHarris said Apollo would probably break Smart & Final into two companies, and it has high expectations for both divisions separately.\n\n2) The average investor gets too psyched out by the prospect of industry disruption\n\nHe added that a second factor seemed to make Wall Street nervous about Smart & Final during its short run as a public company. That was the threat of Amazon and other companies upending its business. While that phenomenon is undeniably real, he suggested investors were too cautious about some companies exposed to it.\n\n\"What we're finding is that if anything has a hint of internet disintermediation, if it's complicated, we can buy it,\" Harris said.\n\n3) The average investor is too focused on the near term\n\nHe also criticized short-termism, saying investors often overemphasize traditional measurements like quarterly earnings targets, and along the way, they can miss out on the greater potential of a business.\n\n\"If you have a long-run strategy, you need to invest, you need to build a plant, you need to grow ... your earnings might have to go down first,\" he said. \"We own companies for five to seven years, or even longer, typically, and so you can take that longer-term point of view.\"\n\n4) The average investor is too scared of debt\n\nHe added that investors were also more averse to leverage than they should be. Properly deployed, leverage can enhance a company's growth and get it a tax break \u2014 but investors' shyness around it means companies that borrow, or need to borrow, can get punished.\n\n\"There are many, many companies that make sense for private equity where private equity will afford them the opportunity to grow,\" he said.", "description": "Apollo Global Management cofounder Josh Harris details the mistakes investors make in valuing stocks and how his private-equity firm benefits.", "authors": ["Marley Jay"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8a2fb32e22af48250a4fef?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
