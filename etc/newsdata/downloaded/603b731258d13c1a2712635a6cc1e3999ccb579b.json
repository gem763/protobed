(NTB Scanpix / Ryan Kelly / Reuters)\n\nIn the forthcoming issue of National Review, I have a piece about Tanya Chan, who is a Hong Konger: She is a legislator and a democracy leader, in the thick of it all. She is also an inspiration.\n\nToday, I talked with Denise Ho \u2014 who is also an inspiration. She, too, is a Hong Konger, and a democracy leader, in the thick of it all. She is also a pop star \u2014 a household name in Hong Kong and beyond. Her activism has not come without costs. She has paid a price in engagements, endorsements, etc. Obviously, she is persona non grata in Mainland China \u2014 which is a very, very big market. But she could not remain silent. Something within her impelled her to join the others in the streets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor my podcast with her \u2014 a Q&A \u2014 go here.\n\nWe met at Town Hall in New York City, where the Oslo Freedom Forum was holding a special session. (On the fa\u00e7ade of Town Hall, it says in big, bold letters, \u201cYe shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.\u201d) We talk about her life and career. The prospects for democracy in Hong Kong. The brutality of the police. The question of Taiwan. And other key subjects.\n\nShe says that all people who favor democracy, freedom, and human rights \u2014 wherever they live \u2014 are linked. They are allies, and should stand together against oppressors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUsually, Q&A goes out with music by Glazunov (which is how the show is introduced, too) \u2014 the last movement of his Symphony No. 5, \u201cHeroic.\u201d This time, it goes out with a Denise Ho song.
