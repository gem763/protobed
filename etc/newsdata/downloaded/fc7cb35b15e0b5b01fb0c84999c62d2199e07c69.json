A parliamentary judicial panel had recommended rejecting Lauber.\n\nA scheduled vote in June was delayed in fallout from reports of a third and undeclared meeting between Lauber and FIFA president Gianni Infantino in June 2017.\n\nThough Lauber has been recused from 25 FIFA-related criminal proceedings - by order of Switzerland\u2019s federal criminal court in June - lawyers for some defendants have argued his actions have harmed the integrity of investigations.\n\nCriminal proceedings are open against former FIFA president Sepp Blatter, former secretary general Jerome Valcke and Nasser Al-Khelaifi, the Paris Saint-Germain president who is a member of European soccer body UEFA\u2019s executive committee. They deny wrongdoing and have not been charged.\n\nThree members of the German organizing committee for the 2006 World Cup and then-FIFA secretary general Urs Linsi have been charged with fraud or complicity in fraud.\n\nLauber previously acknowledged two undeclared meetings in 2016 when they were reported in the Football Leaks series last November.\n\nReports in April of a third meeting where Lauber also took no notes led to the office overseeing Swiss federal prosecutors opening a disciplinary case.\n\nSwiss federal prosecutors are in their fifth year of investigating suspected wrongdoing linked to international soccer officials.\n\nThey have shared evidence with the U.S. Department of Justice which has secured more than 40 guilty pleas, convictions and indictments in its sprawling and ongoing soccer investigation.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Switzerland's lawmakers have given embattled attorney general Michael Lauber four more years in office despite criticism of his handling of corruption investigations linked to soccer governing body FIFA.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/25/switzerland_fifa_investigation_lauber_73620_c0-117-2817-1759_s1770x1032.jpg?6dfa61851b3236dbc27b195af869fe7b4124a123", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
