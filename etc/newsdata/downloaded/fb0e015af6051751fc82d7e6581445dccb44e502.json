However, as OnePlus has grown, so too has the price of its phones, from $529 for the original OnePlus One to almost $1,000 for the OnePlus 7 Pro. With the new OnePlus 7T, OnePlus is using its latest handset as a chance to reset expectations when it comes to how we judge good performance and value.\n\nEditor's Note: OnePlus' phones are not widely available in Australia, but can be bought online at retailers like Dick Smith and Kogan.\n\nOnePlus 7T WHAT IS IT? A mid-range phone with a 6.55-inch screen PRICE $US600 ($889) LIKE Triple cams, flat screen, 90Hz display, excellent performance and battery life DON'T LIKE No headphone jack, wireless charging, microSD card slot, or official water-resistance rating\n\nStarting at $US600 ($889) (and on sale October 19), the OnePlus 7T is actually $100 cheaper than the OnePlus 7 Pro we got earlier this year.\n\nDespite its more affordable price tag, the OP7T still has the most important feature from its predecessor: a screen with a wonderfully smooth 90Hz refresh rate. After using phones like the Razer Phone 2, Asus ROG Phone, and both the OP7 Pro and OP7T, while the overall effect can be subtle, having a higher than normal refresh rate really does add a sense of fluidity that makes using the phone feel more polished and stable. And when you combine that with the OP7T\u2019s vibrant OLED panel, you get an entrancing viewing experience that\u2019s hard to give up when switching back to handsets with standard 60Hz screens.\n\nMeanwhile, on the inside, the OP7T features a new Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+ chip that offers 10 to 15 per cent better performance for both CPU and GPU.\n\nThat might not sound like much \u2014 to the point you may not notice if you\u2019re just browsing the web or checking in on social media \u2014 but in gaming, that extra performance does help you avoid some extra jank or lag than you might have encountered otherwise. And considering Samsung\u2019s latest $1,699 flagship \u2014 the Galaxy Note 10 \u2014 only comes with a vanilla processor, the OP7T\u2019s ample performance is a welcome bonus.\n\nHowever, because of the 7T\u2019s slightly lower price, OnePlus did have to make a few adjustments for some of the phone\u2019s other features. Though for a lot of people, many of OnePlus\u2019 changes could be viewed less as trade-offs, and more like sidegrades that function as a refreshing throwback to a time when phones were just a bit simpler.\n\nSo instead of the 6.67-inch 3120 x 1440 screen One Plus gave the 7 Pro, the 7T has a 6.55-inch display with a 2400 x 1080 resolution, which is a bit easier to handle for people with smaller hands. The OP7T also has a flat display instead of the curvy 3D glass panel used on the OP7 Pro, which should be a boon to the slice of people that believe phones with sloping displays are harder to use.\n\nPhoto: Sam Rutherford, Gizmodo Photo: Sam Rutherford, Gizmodo Photo: Sam Rutherford, Gizmodo Photo: Sam Rutherford, Gizmodo Photo: Sam Rutherford, Gizmodo The OP7T\u2019s rear cams are even aligned in a T-shape. Neat, right? Photo: Sam Rutherford, Gizmodo Photo: Sam Rutherford, Gizmodo Photo: Sam Rutherford, Gizmodo OP7T (left) versus the OP7 Pro (right). Photo: Sam Rutherford, Gizmodo The OP7T\u2019s notch is a tiny bit more distracting compared to the OP7 Pro\u2019s all-screen design, but it\u2019s not a big deal.\n\nThe OP7T also has a notch for its selfie cam instead of a motorised pop-up, which admittedly isn\u2019t quite as exciting, but does make you feel better about the phone\u2019s lifetime durability. Sadly, after axing the headphone jack on its phones earlier this spring, it seems the days of getting 3.5mm jacks on OnePlus phones are gone for good, as the 7T\u2019s only port is a USB-C connection on the bottom.\n\nThat\u2019s kind of a shame because if the OP7T had a headphone jack and a removable plastic back, the OP7T would almost be a perfect phone for Android diehards who still reminisce about the glory days of phones like the Galaxy S5.\n\nThe OP7T\u2019s other major upgrade is the addition of a 16-MP 117-degree ultra-wide camera alongside its 48-MP main cam and 12-MP 2x telephoto cam, which is OnePlus\u2019 first-ever triple cam setup. With triple rear cameras modules becoming standard equipment for practically every high-end phone this year, it\u2019s nice to see a phone that cost almost half as much hop on that trend as well. OnePlus even added a Super Stabilisation mode to the new ultra-wide camera that combines optical and electronic image stabilisation to capture smoother, more shake-free videos.\n\nWhile I\u2019m partial to the OP7 Pro\u2019s richer Nebula Blue colour (right), the OP7T\u2019s light hue ain\u2019t bad either. And if blue isn\u2019t your thing, the OP7T also comes in grey. (Photo: Sam Rutherford, Gizmodo)\n\nThat said, while the OP7T image quality is pretty good and more than competent for anyone\u2019s whose main portal for photography is Instagram, in a head-to-head photo comparison between the 7T and true flagship phones like the Note 10, OnePlus still sits a tier behind Samsung, Google, and Apple.\n\nIn typical situations like taking pictures of apples at a grocery store or of what I had for dinner, the OP7T\u2019s photos consistently lacked sharpness compared to its more expensive competition, while also going overboard on colour saturation. Meanwhile, when I took a picture of a nearby street mural, the OP7T fell just short on things like details and white balance. And with its Nightscape mode turned on, the OP7T had trouble topping Google\u2019s Night Sight on the Pixel 3, producing a darker, yellower final image.\n\nPhoto: Sam Rutherford, Gizmodo For some reason, the OP7T has a tendency to go overboard on colour saturation. Photo: Sam Rutherford, Gizmodo Here\u2019s another example of the OP7T going a bit too hard on colour saturation. Photo: Sam Rutherford, Gizmodo Photo: Sam Rutherford, Gizmodo While the OP7T\u2019s ultra-wide camera isn\u2019t quite as wide was what you get from the Note 10, it does have less barrel distortion.

That\u2019s almost an hour longer than the OP7 Pro (13:36) and the standard Note 10 (13:46), but still half an hour shy of the Note 10+\u2019s time of 15:05. OnePlus has even upgraded the OP7T\u2019s charging speeds, so that from a completely dead battery, I was able to get a 39 per cent charge after 15 minutes, and 73 per cent after just half an hour.\n\nAs for the rest of the phone, OnePlus has kept important features like its handy alert slider, in-display fingerprint reader (which is actually a touch faster than before) and Oxygen OS, which remains super clean and easy to use, and is also one of, if not the first Android skins to get the update to Android 10.\n\nPhoto: Sam Rutherford, Gizmodo\n\nWhile the OnePlus 7T may not be as flashy as some of its competitors or even some of OnePlus\u2019 other handsets, it nails almost all of a phone\u2019s most important features while still packing in a few big-ticket items like its 90Hz screen, in-display fingerprint reader, and triple rear cameras. It\u2019s a simple phone with an almost nostalgic approach. Sure, $US600 ($889) is double what the original OnePlus cost at launch, but even after all these years, OnePlus is still delivering on its guiding mission of offering big specs at half the price (or close enough) of today\u2019s flagship devices.\n\nREADME", "description": "From its humble start making \u201cflagship killers\u201d in 2014, OnePlus has become one of the fastest-growing smartphone makers, ranking in the top five globally and overtaking brands like Sony, HTC and even LG \u2014 the same companies OnePlus once sought to take down.
