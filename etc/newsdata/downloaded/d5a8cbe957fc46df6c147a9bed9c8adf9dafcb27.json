That is my challenge to Justin Trudeau today,\" he said.\n\nReporters asked Trudeau to respond today to Scheer's statement during a campaign event in Whitby, Ont.\n\n\"Those claims are entirely untrue,\" he said. \"It is unfortunate that the Conservatives keep having to make up attacks against us. But all they're offering is cuts. Cuts four times greater than (Ontario Premier) Doug Ford's. So perhaps that's all they can do, is make things up.\"\n\nTrudeau has consistently cited the Ford government's austerity measures throughout the campaign, warning that Scheer would impose the same deep cuts in ways that would harm Canadians.\n\nLiberal Leader Justin Trudeau accuses the Conservatives of spreading disinformation after leader Andrew Scheer claimed the Liberals would hike the GST. Trudeau is then asked if he could be accused of the same thing for pressing Scheer on the abortion issue. 1:43\n\nScheer has promised multiple tax breaks and credits during the campaign and has said he would pay for them by cutting foreign aid by 25 per cent and withdrawing $1.5 billion in corporate subsidies. He also has pledged to erase the deficit in five years.\n\nTrudeau was asked if his repeated questions and claims about Scheer's position on abortion \u2014 made even though the Conservative leader has insisted he would not act to limit access to abortion services \u2014 also amount to disinformation.\n\nTrudeau said Scheer has never stated he would stand up for reproductive services in New Brunswick, where the only abortion clinic in the province is closing down due to a lack of provincial funding.\n\nAccess to abortion\n\n\"We need a federal government that will unequivocally stand up and defend women's rights, not passively accept what the law is even though they don't personally agree with it,\" he said.\n\n\"We need a government that will fight for women's rights, and that's exactly what we will do in New Brunswick and anywhere else where access to reproductive rights and services are limited by Conservative governments.\"\n\nNDP Leader Jagmeet Singh today accused Scheer of \"making stuff up\" and said the NDP has no plan to increase the GST.\n\n\"I think people can tell from the repeated, desperate attempt to misinform Canadians that Mr. Scheer is getting desperate, and that he's trying to make things up to scare people because our message of hope is working,\" he said during a stop in Port Alberni, B.C.\n\nHe\u2019s pointing out the possible consequences of a Trudeau/NDP coalition.<br><br>Without Trudeau explaining to Canadians which taxes he will raise to buy the NDP\u2019s support, we\u2019re left to guess. <br><br>Could be the GST. Could be something else. <a href=\"https://t.co/1CofAXARIL\">https://t.co/1CofAXARIL</a> \u2014@BrockWHarrison\n\nScheer's director of communications Brock Harrison tweeted that the Conservative leader was \"pointing out the possible consequences of a Trudeau-NDP coalition.\"\n\n\"Without Trudeau explaining to Canadians which taxes he will raise to buy the NDP's support, we're left to guess. Could be the GST.
