Quintal made a call at 2:45 a.m. on Thursday to a \"third party\" in Warren and \"asked for help,\" according to the sheriff's office, who said the third party then contacted their office.\n\n\"Deputies and Michigan State Police arrived on scene at 2:58 a.m. and observed evidence of possible foul play but were unable to locate Adrienne,\" police wrote on Facebook.\n\nWEST POINT CADET GOES MISSING IN NEW YORK ALONG WITH HIS RIFLE, SPARKING MASSIVE SEARCH\n\nQuintal's son, Nick White, told FOX2 on Monday that his mother went up north with her boyfriend to the family cabin, but the boyfriend returned to their home in Southfield, Mich. on Thursday, two days before Quintal was reported missing.\n\n\"He was up there with her, he came home to drop supplies off, we are working on the condo here,\" White said.\n\nQuintal was at the cabin to do some work on it, according to White.\n\n\"She was also just getting ready for hunting and hanging out and enjoying the wildlife,\" he told FOX2.\n\nThe sheriff's office said the 47-year-old's purse, phone and car remained on the property.\n\nPHOENIX OFFICIALS FLEW TO MEXICO TO HELP FIND MISSING MAN WHO FELL IN SINKHOLE, WAS SWEPT AWAY IN STORM DRAIN\n\nInvestigators attempted to track Quintal's movements with a K-9 team but were unable to find her. White told FOX2 that police were out with a dog searching all of Thursday morning before a search party made another attempt later to find his mother.\n\nOver the weekend, local and state police joined the Benzie-Manistee Community Emergency Response Team with a group of about 20 people, but the searchers again came up empty.\n\nCERT public information officer Glenn Zaring told WWTV the group was out until 4:30 p.m. on Saturday doing sweeps of areas after using a computer program to help them track the probabilities of where someone may be located.\n\n\u201cWe were actually searching almost like the back swampy area from Little Platte Lake up into some very thick hunting woods along Indian Hill Road,\u201d Zaring told the television station.\n\nOfficials are expected to be out Tuesday morning with a drone in another attempt to find Quintal, according to WWTV.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nQuintal, who goes by the name Ada, has long brown hair with brown eyes, according to police.
