Now, however, it looks like the Sony X900F series has gotten a permanent price cut, bringing the total for the 55-inch model for to $998. That's $200 less than it used to be.\n\nPrice cuts are even more impressive for the larger models. You can get the 65-inch model for $1,198, or $400 off its old price, and the 75-inch model for $1,998, or $800 off its original price. Alternatively, there's a smaller 49-inch model that's available for $898, or $100 off its old price.\n\nThere's plenty to like about the Sony X900F beyond the price. Easily the best thing about this range of TVs is its image quality. As someone who has used the TV personally, I was impressed with the TVs excellent color-reproduction, which is thanks in large to its 4K HDR X1 Extreme Processor and support for Dolby Vision. Black levels are pretty incredible too, despite this TV not being an OLED TV. That's thanks to the full-array local dimming technology, which allows the TV to switch off sections of the back-lighting during dark scenes. It's all a bit technical, but the end result is that you'll get deep, natural black levels that approach even OLED panels.\n\nThere are other handy features too. The TV has Android TV built into it, which is handy for streaming television and running apps, and supports things like Google Chromecast. On the back, you'll get four HDMI ports, three USB port, an Ethernet port, and more \u2014 plenty for most people.\n\nAt these prices, the Sony X900F becomes more competitive when compared to excellent but lower-priced options from Vizio and TCL, and any TV in this series makes a great choice for those in the market for a new TV. Just pick the size that best fits your space.", "description": "Sony X900F TV is a great option because it offers remarkable picture quality and has smart features built right in.
