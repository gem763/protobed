Every state but Alaska has confirmed at least one of the 1,604 cases of lung damage\n\nThe agency is scheduled reveal further details on its investigation on Friday.\n\nHealth officials have homed their investigation in on THC pods believed to be behind the majority of the illnesses, but warn that they cannot yet rule out nicotine as a cause of the spate of illnesses.\n\nSeveral states, including New York, Oregon and Michigan, Washington, Utah, Montana and Rhode Island have attempted to ban flavored e-cigarettes and Massachusetts put a temporary ban on the sale of all vapes.\n\nBut many of these moves face legal challenges, including in New York, where a court has blocked the state's ban.\n\nOn the federal level, President Trump said that his administration wanted to pull flavored e-cigarettes - which are widely blamed for getting young people who have never before smoked - from the market nationwide.\n\nBut then the President seemed to curb his previous statement, instead tweeting that we need to get counterfeits off the market.\n\nCounterfeit or bootleg e-cigarettes that officials believe have been adulterated to contain THC have become the prime suspects in the search for the culprit of the this year's vaping illness epidemic.\n\nSome 76 percent of EVALI patients have said they used e-cigarettes containing THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana.\n\nBut many of these are made by bootleggers\n\nLast week, the CDC went a step further, recommending that 'people refrain from using e-cigarettes, or vaping, products that contain nicotine.'\n\nIt's also urged that no one should use vaping products that contain THC, which were used by 76 percent of those who developed lung illnesses.\n\nInvestigators continue to search for an explanation of what about and how e-cigarettes are triggering life-threatening lung damage.\n\nRecent analysis of the lung tissue of people with EVALI suggested that toxic chemicals released when e-liquids are heated may be damaging lungs.\n\nOthers have theorized that oils, including the glycerin base used in many vaping products or vitamin E acetate may be triggering inflammation and injury.\n\nIn the meantime, officials say that people using nicotine e-cigarettes as quit aids should not go back to smoking combustible cigarette, but are particularly warning young people and pregnant women against vaping.\n\nIn an effort to stem illnesses and deaths, states including Washington, Rhode Island and New York are implementing bans on flavored e-cigarettes thought to entice youth and teenagers.\n\nMassachusetts has gone a step further and banned the sale of all e-cigarettes.\n\nA judge overturned Michigan's attempt to ban flavored e-cigarettes on Tuesday.\n\nMeanwhile, a Florida woman filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Juul, claiming that her son, Daniel Wakefield, had died at age 18 after using the companies popular products.\n\nA number of other individuals, cities and states have sued the company for deceptive marketing that they claim got teens and youth hooked on Juuling.", "description": "Experts still don't know what is causing the outbreak of life-threatening lung illnesses linked to vaping but are warning against THC and bootleg e-cigarettes, which most victims report using.", "authors": ["Natalie Rahhal Deputy Health Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/22/20154598-0-image-a-11_1571951680481.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
