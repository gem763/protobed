From 1993 to 2003, she was also on the House Intelligence Committee and has continued to play an active role in her ex officio status as a House leader.\n\nWithout doubt, she was influenced this week by the shifting currents in her caucus on impeachment. But when she spoke of a \u201cgrave new chapter of lawlessness,\u201d it was also as Nancy Pelosi the legislator, not just as a political leader.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/9f/5e/efb5847e4b42a358b4de7e606b6b/ukraine-site.png\"\n\nFor Senate Republicans, the picture is more complicated. But some are having second thoughts after allowing Trump to run roughshod over Congress\u2019 appropriations power.\n\nUnlike aid for Puerto Rico or Central America, Ukrainian assistance is something the GOP cares about as much as Democrats do. Second, unlike Trump\u2019s use of emergency powers to build his border wall, the president\u2019s goal in this case had less to do with some shared goal for his party \u2014 such as slowing immigration \u2014 and more his political self-interest.\n\nIndeed, given the revelations this week, it\u2019s striking to revisit a debate on the same Ukrainian aid issue when the Republican-controlled Senate Appropriations Committee met to draft spending bills for the coming fiscal year.\n\nThe date was Sept. 12, just hours after the White House had sent notice to the committee that it was finally releasing Defense and State Department funds that lawmakers had approved in the 2018 and 2019 budgets for Ukraine.\n\nWaiting any longer would have put the entire package in danger, since big portions of the appropriations were due to expire on Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year. This provoked a debate as to what to do next and how best to avoid a repeat performance by the White House going into 2020.\n\nLed by Sen. Richard Durbin (D-Ill.), committee Democrats proposed to challenge the president by withholding a small portion of the 2020 Pentagon budget until the next installment of military aid for Kiev was released. Committee Chairman Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) prevailed on Durbin to withdraw his amendment, but not before a discussion that in retrospect, shows how clueless Republicans were about what was really going on at the White House.\n\nSen. John Kennedy (R-La.), a member of the committee, is a highly educated attorney with a Phi Beta Kappa pin and degree from Oxford. He vowed to \u201cburn fresh hell\u201d if future aid to Ukraine were withheld again by the White House. Yet in the same voice, he plaintively turned to committee Democrats like Durbin and Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, asking them to explain what the stall had been about.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019ve got the message. If you are listening in the Ukraine on CPAN, you\u2019re gonna get the money.\u201d - Sen. Lindsey Graham\n\nProviding no answer, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) assured his colleagues that the White House had learned its lesson and there would be no future delays in aid for Ukraine. \u201cI think they\u2019ve got the message. If you are listening in the Ukraine on C-SPAN, you\u2019re gonna get the money,\u201d Graham said.\n\nIn defense of the administration, perhaps no Republican walked out on a limb more than Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma.\n\nLankford has been a devoted supporter of Ukraine aid, traveling himself to Kiev around Memorial Day to meet with people close to the new president, Volodymyr Zelensky, after his election last spring. Like others on the committee, Lankford said he had become impatient with the delays but suggested it all could be explained by the president showing \u201cdue diligence.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do think this year was an exceptional year,\u201d Lankford said. \u201cIt was entirely reasonable that the United States spend a couple of months getting to know him [Zelensky], his administration and to figure out if he was going to be pro-Russian or pro-West. Because no one knew which direction Zelensky was going to go.\u201d\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/76/1d/89d23a804d4d95f3083b6e9593d4/trumpimpeachment.jpg\"\n\n\u201cIn the past several months, I think it took longer than it should have. I think we should have moved faster than we moved but there was due diligence in the process.\u201d\n\nShelby also spoke of allowing time for \u201cdue diligence.\u201d Yet from the summary released this week of the president\u2019s actual conversation with Zelensky, there\u2019s little evidence that this weighed heavily with Trump.\n\nInstead, the president devoted more time to pressing Ukraine to do more to investigate his Democratic political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nIn a brief interview Thursday, Lankford insisted that he did not feel used and saw nothing upsetting in the president\u2019s remarks about Biden.\n\nThe Oklahoman said it was Zelensky who introduced the topic when the Ukrainian leader referenced his dealings with the president's personal attorney Rudolph Giuliani, who had been Trump\u2019s point man on the issue. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t bother me and when I was there, all of the local press \u2026 the Ukraine press was obsessed with Rudy Giuliani. They were very focused on it so it didn\u2019t surprise me that Zelensky brought it up.\u201d\n\nWhen the topic came up again in the Senate panel on Thursday this week, Graham again vowed: \u201cI want to send a clear signal that we\u2019re going to keep helping the Ukraine.\u201d But Durbin reminded him: \u201cThe plot has thickened dramatically since then as to why [the Ukraine dollars] were being held and under what circumstances.\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["-", "Sen.
