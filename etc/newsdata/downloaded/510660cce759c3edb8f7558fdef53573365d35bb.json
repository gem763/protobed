Mark Dixon, IWG's CEO, is in talks with investment banks about creating a standalone business that would become a publicly traded rival to WeWork, according to SkyNews.\n\nIWG's current market cap in London is \u00a33.64 billion ($4.5 billion), and if the company pursues this plan, its US business could be worth as much as \u00a33 billion ($3.7 billion) as a standalone franchise. IWG generated about 41% of its $3.4 billion of revenue in the Americas last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s interesting: IWG is larger than WeWork in terms of space. The company has ~60 million square feet (5.6 million square meters) globally, while WeWork had 45 million square feet as of March. WeWork\u2019s largest backer SoftBank has valued the company at $47 billion, which is way more than IWG\u2019s market cap as noted above. Plus, WeWork\u2019s IPO may be among the year\u2019s biggest.\n\nIWG CEO Mark Dixon said earlier this month that WeWork\u2019s visibility has helped his company\u2019s U.S. business. \u201cThat\u2019s a market that\u2019s deemed to be very competitive,\u201d Dixon said. \u201cIt is the home of WeWork, so by WeWork and others talking more in the market, it generates more business for us.\u201d\n\nAs I noted on Friday, the co-working market is out of control. There\u2019s Convene, Knotel, Industrious, Spacious, The Yard, The Wing, and Alley \u2014 all smaller rivals with plenty of venture capital to go around. I\u2019m not convinced that any of them, including IWG, will challenge WeWork\u2019s business in any real way, but like Dixon said, they all stand to reap the benefits if its IPO goes well.\n\nANOTHER IPO: On Friday, DataDog filed its S-1 on Friday. Datadog, a New York-based cloud app monitoring service, increased its revenue roughly 97% last year to $200 million in 2018 on $11 million profit loss. Datadog previously raised $147.9 million in equity at a valuation of $640 million from investors including ICONIQ Capital and Index Ventures. Check out the S-1 here.\n\nPEOPLE MOVES: Dean Takahashi, who is the second-most powerful figure at the Yale Investment Office, is stepping aside, according to Institutional Investor.
