Several Bahamians interviewed by Reuters \u2013 on Great Abaco, in Nassau and in Florida, where hundreds of evacuees stepped off a cruise ship on Saturday \u2013 said they might attempt to emigrate to the United States rather than face an uncertain reconstruction at home.\n\nIt is not clear whether U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, which has sought to severely restrict legal and illegal immigration, will smooth the path. But a growing chorus of Congress members call for a suspension of visa requirements to help reunite stranded Bahamians with U.S. relatives.\n\nWhen asked on Monday whether he would consider loosening immigration rules to aid storm-stricken Bahamians, Trump asserted the Bahamas had \u201ctremendous problems\u201d with allowing \u201cvery bad people\u201d into the country, and that he wanted to ensure those people do not make it to the United States.\n\n\u201cWe have to be very careful,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cEverybody needs totally proper documentation.\u201d\n\nDorian pummeled the Bahamas with 200 mile-per-hour winds last week, causing immense destruction among the Abacos islands. Authorities have said at least 45 people died.\n\nOn Sunday, Bahamians were ordered off a ferry headed to Florida if they did not have a U.S. visa, even though others without visas had already travelled to the United States as long as they had a passport and proof of no criminal record.\n\nU.S. Customs blamed the incident on the ferry operator.\n\nPASSPORT LOST IN FLOOD\n\nBut for Bahamians like Anthony Morley, 61, who waited out the storm on a restaurant rooftop, the existing rules may prove too much of an obstacle.\n\nMorley said his passport was lost in the flood. But he does not believe he can stay long in the capital Nassau, where the demand for housing and jobs far outstrips the supply.\n\n\u201cThe government says everyone\u2019s being fed, and that\u2019s good,\u201d Morley said. \u201cBut for food I can fish. What I need is a house. I don\u2019t have a bed, a refrigerator. I don\u2019t even have a Bible.\u201d\n\nRepublicans Marco Rubio and Rick Scott, the two U.S. senators from Florida, which has the country\u2019s largest population of Bahamian-Americans, have asked Trump to relax visa requirements to allow Bahamians to stay with relatives in the United States.\n\nDemocratic U.S. Representative Frederica Wilson of Florida has sent a letter expressing support for a program known as Temporary Protected Status, which allows foreign nationals whose home countries have been hurt by a war or natural disaster to live and work in the United States.\n\nFourteen other members of Florida\u2019s 27-seat congressional delegation, including two Republicans, co-signed the letter, and Wilson\u2019s office said she expected others to do so this week.\n\nTPS is a limited tool, giving legal status only to those already living in the United States, and lasting for up to 18 months, though in the past administrations have often extended them for years.\n\nSome natural disasters, like Hurricane Mitch\u2019s devastation of Honduras and Nicaragua in 1998, have led to TPS declarations for those countries.\n\nWORKING TO END TPS\n\nOther hurricanes have not prompted TPS. Haiti suffered a series of devastating hurricanes starting with Jeanne in 2004, but Haitians did not receive TPS until January 2010, when a massive earthquake destroyed much of the country.\n\nThe U.S. government currently grants TPS to 10 countries, but the Trump administration has worked to end protections for several of those countries as part of its broader anti-immigration push.\n\nFor Bahamians looking to come to the United States, the Trump administration could consider \u201chumanitarian parole,\u201d which is offered case by case to individuals who face extremely dire circumstances.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A boat is seen stranded on land in the wake of Hurricane Dorian in Marsh Harbour, Great Abaco, Bahamas, September 8, 2019.
