The office of Gov. Jared Polis Jared Schutz PolisFreedom of the press under fire in Colorado Democrats grill BLM chief over plans to move officials out of DC Colorado governor pokes fun at FaceApp MORE (D-Colo.) pressed rural media outlets in his state to remove two stories because it disapproved of the source that originally reported an otherwise benign story.\n\nThe controversy began in September after Polis announced the formation, via executive order, of a new office called the \u201cOffice of Future of Work,\" which the governor says will \u201cprepare workers for the jobs of the future\" due to \"technology, cost of education and a shifting need for skills.\u201d Polis also stated that the Future of Work office will research the Rocky Mountain State's evolving economy to help the administration shape its policy initiative.\n\nOne writer, Derek Draplin, penned a story for a nonprofit media outlet called The Center Square. Drapin wrote about the governor's plan, quoting supporters and critics alike.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOne critic was a Colorado GOP spokesperson who mocked the governor for creating another regulatory bureaucracy with \"undefined goals, broad powers, and a name straight from the brain of George Orwell.\" In a political world of increasingly sharp elbows, the comment was relatively tame. In the end, the published story was factually correct and about as straightforward as they come.\n\nThe Center Square allows its content to be reprinted, so two rural publications picked up the story. No surprise there, given the state of the newspaper business in which resources are limited due to falling ad revenue and, therefore, depleted staffing, especially in rural places.\n\nThe first of the two small papers was the Kiowa County Press in Eads, Colo. (population 609). The other was the Chronicle-News in Trinidad, Colo. (population 8,100).\n\nSo it was curious that Gov. Polis's spokesman, Conor Cahill, asked the two small publications to remove the articles \u2014 not because there was some egregious error that warranted such a request, but because the original source, The Center Square, is owned by the Franklin News Foundation, which \"supports and funds public-interest journalism at the state and local levels,\" according to its website. Its mission is \u201cto hold government accountable through objective, balanced, citizen-focused public journalism with a taxpayer sensibility.\"\n\nCahill's argument is that this mission makes The Center Square biased to the right and therefore not objective. The governor's spokesperson also said the Franklin News Foundation has donors that have included groups funded by Charles Koch Foundation and therefore can't be reputable. Cahill said he was \u201calarmed\u201d that the story \u201cwas being reprinted by reputable news outlets in the state.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe editors at the respective small newspapers rightly refused Cahill's request to take down the story, citing the lack of factual errors. The Center Square penned a follow-up story on Cahill's request, which was picked up by the Denver Post and Associated Press.\n\nWorking over the refs is common in journalism \u2014 but only if a bad call has been committed and is apparent for everyone to see.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite a big 'ask' to request that a story be taken down, especially when you\u2019re not pointing out inaccuracies in the story,\u201d Jeffrey Roberts, executive director of the Colorado Freedom of Information Coalition, told The Washington Post. \u201cUltimately, it\u2019s the newspaper\u2019s decision about what they want to publish.\u201d\n\nMaking baseless requests, premised on some funding that may have been provided to publications, could set a dangerous precedent if publications actually begin to acquiesce to such demands.\n\nFor example, here's how The Washington Post describes the political leanings of its owner, Jeff Bezos Jeffrey (Jeff) Preston BezosFreedom of the press under fire in Colorado Krystal Ball defends Sanders amid reports that campaign is struggling UPS gets FAA approval to operate drone fleet MORE, in an August 2013 story: \"Campaign finance records show that Bezos has mostly given to Democratic candidates for federal and state office, including Washington's two senators, Patty Murray Patricia (Patty) Lynn MurrayFreedom of the press under fire in Colorado Ninth woman accuses Al Franken of inappropriate contact Schumer throws support behind Pelosi impeachment inquiry MORE and Maria Cantwell Maria Elaine CantwellFreedom of the press under fire in Colorado Watchdog: Energy Department not doing enough to protect grid against cyber attacks Hillicon Valley: Zuckerberg courts critics on Capitol Hill | Amazon makes climate pledge | Senate panel approves 0M for state election security MORE.\"\n\nDoes that mean President Trump Donald John TrumpGordon Sondland expected to appear for House deposition Ivanka Trump on impeachment: 'Everything's a question of priorities' Second intel official considering filing complaint over Trump: report MORE can point to the political party that Bezos seems to prefer as a reason to take down every factual story published in the Post about him or his administration? Of course not.\n\nThere\u2019s a great irony in Polis's spokesperson asking for the story to be removed. The request ended up drawing infinitely more attention to the story than it would have received had it been left alone to be read by a fraction of the readers who are now aware of it.\n\nJoe Concha is a media reporter for The Hill and co-host of \"WOR Tonight with Joe Concha,\" weeknights on 710-WOR in New York.
