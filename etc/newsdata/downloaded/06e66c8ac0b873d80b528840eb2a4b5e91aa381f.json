Every journalist is in that position at one time or another.\n\nBut it\u2019s still embarrassing when the public gets to see how news stories come about. It\u2019s not a whole lot less disgusting than the way sausages are made.\n\nHere\u2019s my guess for what happens next:\n\nComey isn\u2019t off the hook yet. And The Times had better be prepared for more embarrassment when the rest of Horowitz\u2019s investigations on what the FBI did under Comey comes out.\n\nThe reporter who got the memo from Comey in the now-criticized instance also was part of a team that, back in 2017, wrote a story on direct contact between Trump advisers and Russian officials before the 2016 election.\n\nIt was a blockbuster attempt to prove collusion between Trump\u2019s people and the Russians. And, as the report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller proved, it was also untrue.\n\nBut you didn\u2019t have to wait for Mueller\u2019s report to know that. On June 9, 2017, The Times reported \u2014 not very publicly \u2013\u2014 that Comey said of the paper\u2019s Trump/Russia article \u201cin the main, it was not true.\u201d\n\nMaybe that\u2019s why Comey decided to start leaking stuff to The Times. At least the paper would get something right.\n\nA lot of people weighed in on my recent column about college students wasting money by pursuing degrees that will result in too much debt and not a big enough paycheck when they get a job.\n\nI recently mentioned a masters degree that I have that wasn\u2019t helpful in my career. This is part of a comment from a reader that shows just how tricky it is to pick the right field of study.\n\nJohn: \u201cMany high school students applying to colleges have no idea what course of study to pursue because they have not yet decided on a career choice. Wouldn\u2019t it make more sense to first find out where there is a demand before deciding on a career path?\n\nWhen that has been decided, then one should decide whether to go to college or to trade school.\u201d J.J.C.\n\nDear J.J.C. That would be very smart to do. But here\u2019s the problem. The job market can, and often does, change from the time a kid enters college to the time he graduates. That was usually four years back when I was in school; more now.\n\nAlso, there is a lot to be said about going into a profession that you will enjoy for the rest of your life. It isn\u2019t only about earning a living. Plumbers shouldn\u2019t be writers. And writers shouldn\u2019t be under sinks \u2013 as I can attest from personal experience.\n\nWhat\u2019s really needed in picking a career is a lot of luck. So good luck to everyone going back to school.", "description": "That was the day after the Justice Department\u2019s internal investigator, Michael Horowitz, blasted Comey for being deceitful about memos he leaked, through a friend, to The Times.", "authors": ["John Crudele", "September"], "top_image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/james-comey.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200"}
