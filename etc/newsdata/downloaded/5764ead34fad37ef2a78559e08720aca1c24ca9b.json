Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., during a Wednesday hearing.\n\nThe company recently announced that to protect political speech it would no longer fact-check ads from politicians, essentially allowing campaigns to pay Facebook to spread disinformation.\n\nAt the hearing of the House Financial Services Committee, Zuckerberg said the company\u2019s policy was to take down posts from anyone, including politicians, calling for violence or attempting to suppress voter turnout or participation in the census, but his response to other questions was less clear.\n\n\u201cCould I run ads targeting Republicans in primaries saying that they voted for the Green New Deal?\u201d asked Ocasio-Cortez. \u201cIf you\u2019re not fact-checking political advertisements, I\u2019m just trying to understand the bounds here, what\u2019s fair game.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know the answer to that off the top of my head,\u201d said Zuckerberg. \u201cI think probably.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you see a potential problem here with a complete lack of fact checking on political advertisements?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, Congresswoman, I think lying is bad,\u201d said Zuckerberg. \u201cAnd I think if you were to run an ad that had a lie, that would be bad.\u201d But he said it wasn\u2019t Facebook\u2019s role \u201cto prevent your constituents or people in an election from seeing that you had lied.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you won\u2019t take down lies, or you will take down lies?\u201d asked Ocasio-Cortez. \u201cI think that\u2019s a pretty simple yes or no.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a democracy, I believe that people should be able to see for themselves what politicians that they may or may not vote for are saying and judge their character for themselves,\u201d said Zuckerberg.\n\nZuckerberg was testifying about Facebook\u2019s plan to launch a new digital currency, to be called Libra. Earlier in the hearing under questioning from Rep. Sean Casten, D-Ill., the Facebook CEO was unable to confirm that hate speech from a candidate running for office would be removed from the social network. Casten cited a former member of the American Nazi Party who ran for Congress and won a Republican primary in 2018.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m asking the question whether you can spread hate speech if you\u2019re an elected official or trying to be, but you would not be allowed to if you were not in that capacity,\u201d said Casten.\n\n\u201cCongressman, I think that depends on a bunch of specifics,\u201d said Zuckerberg, \u201cthat I\u2019m not familiar with this case and can\u2019t answer to.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s rather shocking,\u201d said Casten. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a hard question.\u201d\n\nMark Zuckerberg; Rep.

On Sept. 19, Zuckerberg and Trump had a surprise meeting at the White House, which the president referred to as \u201cnice.\u201d Facebook announced a change in policy on Sept. 24: It would not fact-check or remove content by politicians even if the posts violate the company\u2019s rules. Nick Clegg, the company\u2019s vice president of global affairs and communications, wrote, \u201cIt is not our role to intervene when politicians speak,\u201d adding that would be done only if a politician\u2019s speech endangers people.\n\nThe Trump campaign has spent millions on Facebook, including $5 million over the past three months.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, a leading critic of Facebook, posted a deliberately false ad on the social network earlier this month to prove the dangers of the current system.\n\n\u201cBreaking news: Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook just endorsed Donald Trump for re-election,\u201d reads the ad. \u201cYou\u2019re probably shocked, and you might be thinking, \u2018how could this possibly be true?\u2019 Well it\u2019s not. (Sorry.) But what Zuckerberg *has* done is given Trump free rein to lie on his platform -- and then to pay Facebook gobs of money to push out their lies to American voters.\u201d", "description": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg struggled to explain the social media company\u2019s new policy on fact-checking political ads under questioning from Rep.
