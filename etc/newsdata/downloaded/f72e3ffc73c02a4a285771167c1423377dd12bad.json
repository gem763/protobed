State officials are deciding whether to appeal.\n\nThe ruling came hours after the president sued to block New York prosecutors from their push to obtain his returns as part of a criminal investigation into payments made to two women who claimed to have affairs with Trump.\n\nThe two Democratic-led states have emerged as Trump\u2019s most ardent foes, fighting not just for his tax returns but repeatedly suing his administration over his environmental, immigration and other policies.\n\nIn California, Democrats have argued that the president\u2019s tax returns provide critical information about his financial history and business dealings. While the New York battle is part of a criminal investigation, lawmakers there also have pushed for the disclosure of his state returns, drawing another Trump lawsuit.\n\n\u201cStates have a legal and moral duty to restore public confidence in government and ensure leaders seeking the highest offices meet minimal standards,\u201d said Jesse Melgar, a spokesman for Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nHe did not address whether California plans to appeal the ruling. Secretary of State Alex Padilla, who\u2019s in charge of elections, said the state will consider its options when the judge releases a written ruling by Oct. 1.\n\nIn court in Sacramento, Trump\u2019s lawyers conceded that the president would likely forgo the state\u2019s primary ballot rather than release his returns. U.S. District Judge Morrison England Jr. questioned why releasing tax returns was such a hurdle but was ultimately open to arguments opposing the law.\n\nHe appeared swayed by arguments that the U.S. Constitution, not states, sets the qualifications to run for president and that a federal law requiring candidates to release financial information supersedes the state\u2019s power to seek additional details.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care how you skin the cat, it\u2019s an unconstitutional law,\u201d said Harmeet Dhillon, who represented the state and national Republican parties.\n\nTrump counsel Jay Sekulow said he was \u201cencouraged\u201d by the tentative ruling.\n\nRepublican lawyers also eagerly pointed to California\u2019s former Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat who vetoed a similar law in 2017. Brown argued it would create a slippery slope that could lead states to impose requirements like medical records or college transcripts.\n\n\u201cThe elephant in the room is President Trump\u2019s tax returns \u2014 that\u2019s what this is about,\u201d Judge England said. \u201cBut it does have implications that are far reaching.\u201d\n\nThe state\u2019s lawyers said it\u2019s within California\u2019s power to regulate its primary elections, and it called the requirement a measure of ballot access, not a new qualification to run for president.\n\n\u201cWe remain firm in our belief that SB 27 is constitutional and provides invaluable transparency for voters as they decide who will hold the most powerful office in the United States,\u201d Padilla, the secretary of state, said in a statement.\n\nIn New York, Trump\u2019s attorneys on Thursday sued Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr., who recently subpoenaed the president\u2019s accounting firm for eight years of state and federal tax returns.\n\nThey called the subpoena a \u201cbad faith effort to harass\u201d Trump and said Vance, a Democrat, had overstepped his constitutional authority.\n\nUnlike in California, the New York case is part of a criminal investigation and a grand jury issued the subpoenas.\n\nA spokesman for Vance said his office had received the lawsuit \u201cand will respond as appropriate in court.\u201d\n\nDemocratic-led congressional committees also are trying to obtain Trump\u2019s tax returns and other records that could provide a window into his finances. Trump and three of his children sued in April seeking to block two House committees from getting records that his longtime lender, Deutsche Bank, has said include tax returns.", "description": "President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to keep his tax returns private played out on both coasts Thursday, with a California judge handing him an initial victory...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-FX224_17trum_ZG_20171029163452.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
