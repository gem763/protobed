migration to Europe \u2018commonplace\u2019 despite risks", "language": "en", "text": "Beijing (AFP) \u2013 The discovery of 39 bodies believed to be Chinese nationals in a truck in Britain is a stark reminder that many in the world\u2019s second biggest economy will still take perilous journeys to build a life elsewhere.\n\nChinese people expressed shock at the news that the victims found in a refrigerated container near London on Wednesday could be their compatriots.\n\nA decades-long economic boom pulled millions of people out of poverty and turned hundreds into billionaires, but the wealth has yet to reach all corners of China and thousands still seek opportunities abroad.\n\nWhile little is yet known about the case, it has echoes of another tragedy in 2000, when 58 Chinese immigrants were discovered dead in a Dutch truck in the English port of Dover.\n\n\u201cOn a daily basis, people from China are being smuggled and trafficked all over the world,\u201d said Matt Friedman, a human trafficking expert at The Mekong Club, an NGO which battles against modern slavery.\n\nAccording to a 2018 British government report, China is the fourth most common country of origin for potential victims, up from fifth the previous year.\n\nFriedman said those targeted by people traffickers in China are often \u201cnot the poorest of poor people\u201d but those struggling to find the work they need at home, while the agent \u2014 often from the same community \u2014 convinces them they can earn more overseas.\n\n\u201c\u2018Maybe I can get more if I buy into what this person\u2026 is telling me\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd as a result of that, you have people who get tricked and deceived into taking these trips, only to come to realise that maybe they made a mistake.\n\n\u201cBut once they\u2019re on the journey, there\u2019s not much you can do about it.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Widening income gap \u2013\n\nWith precise details still unfolding, there is also a possibility the victims might be political refugees fleeing persecution.\n\nThe 2018 UN Global Trends report said there were 212,100 Chinese refugees and 94,400 Chinese people seeking asylum internationally.\n\nThis is up from 7,742 Chinese asylum seekers in its 2010 report.\n\nHua Po, a Beijing-based political analyst, said the flow of Chinese workers to Europe has gone up as \u201cChina\u2019s own policy has become more and more conservative and closed\u201d under President Xi Jinping.\n\n\u201cThe survival of private enterprises is becoming more and more difficult, resulting in an increase in the number of unemployed people,\u201d Hua told AFP.\n\n\u201cThis group of unemployed people may choose to seek opportunities in other countries.\u201d\n\nShi Yinhong, professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing, said illegal immigration from China was \u201ccommonplace\u201d.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s economy has developed rapidly in recent years, but there are more and more income differences,\u201d Shi told AFP.\n\n\u201cSome people always think that there will be better employment opportunities abroad \u2014 and they don\u2019t know anything about the status of illegal immigrants.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Exploitation \u2013\n\nIllegal migration puts its victims at the mercy of organised crime networks.\n\nA report from British charity Women for Refugee Women said it had seen increasing number of women from China detained in the Yarl\u2019s Wood immigration detention centre, many brought to Britain and forced into sexual exploitation or forced labour to \u201cpay off\u201d family debts.\n\nOne woman told the refugee charity that her husband owed money to a gang in China.\n\n\u201cOne day they captured me and said I would have to go and work overseas to pay back his debt,\u201d she said.\n\nThere is speculation that an organised \u201csnakehead\u201d gang \u2014 which helps smuggle migrants out of China to Europe \u2014 could be behind this week\u2019s tragedy.\n\nEuropean police agency Europol warned in 2015 after an investigation that \u201corganised crime groups from China\u201d were trafficking victims to Europe on forged documents to work in brothels, massage parlours, nail studios or restaurants.\n\n\u201cSmuggled migrants from China often fly as close as possible to their destinations, landing in countries without visa requirements or where entry controls are weak,\u201d said Rebecca Miller, from the UN Office on Drugs and Crime in Bangkok.\n\nEastern Europe, the Baltic states, and Russia are often transits and Spain is a main entry point for smuggled Chinese nationals into the Schengen area, from where they are smuggled by car or truck to Britain.\n\nThe price can be hefty.\n\nA report last year in the European-based The Chinese Weekly interviewed Chinese immigrants who said snakehead gangs had brought them into Britain via Spain for a cost of around 160,000 yuan ($22,600).\n\nThe migrants said the trafficker helped them prepare answers to basic questions in English and gave them false passports complete with fake British visas.\n\nIn 2013, Spanish and French police dismantled a human trafficking ring that smuggled Chinese migrants into Europe and the United States, charging up to 50,000 euros ($55,000) per person.\n\nThere was shock and sadness in China as the news emerged, with more than 870 million views on the social media platform Weibo by Friday morning.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not giving people a better life, then how can you have the right to blame others for struggling to survive,\u201d wrote one.", "description": "Beijing (AFP) \u2013 The discovery of 39 bodies believed to be Chinese nationals in a truck in Britain is a stark reminder that many in
