REUTERS/Richa Naidu\n\nThe market for adult diapers, disposable underwear and absorbent pads is growing fast, up 9% last year to $9 billion, having doubled in the last decade, according to Euromonitor.\n\nBut manufacturers like market leaders Essity (ESSITYa.ST) and Kimberly-Clark Corp (KMB.N) reckon only half of the more than 400 million adults likely to be affected by weak bladders, are buying the right products, because they are too embarrassed.\n\nCompanies are trying various methods to change attitudes, including making products more discreet, avoiding terms like diapers or nappies, and placing items in the personal care aisle, next to deodorants and menstrual pads, rather than in the baby products section.\n\nThey are also trying to normalize discussions around the subject through advertising.\n\nIn Japan, where adult incontinence products have outsold baby diaper sales since around 2013 due to a rapidly ageing population, market leader Unicharm Corp (8113.T) has adopted the phrase \u201cchoi more\u201d in its advertising, which translates as \u201clil\u2019 dribble\u201d, to make light of the problem.\n\n\u201cWhat we are doing is trying to let people know that incontinence, even among young people, is normal,\u201d said Unicharm spokesman Hitoshi Watanabe.\n\nThe company is focusing particularly on people with mild bladder issues where it sees the biggest growth as people lead more active lives. Unicharm\u2019s sales of absorbent pads and liners that target this market were up 8% last year.\n\nIn the U.S., market leader Kimberly-Clark has this year given its 35-year-old Depend brand a makeover, introducing thinner, softer and more fitted products that can be worn discreetly, in an effort to make them more acceptable.\n\nThe changes are just the latest in a decade-long attempt to win over consumers, which started with manufacturers dropping the \u2018diaper\u2019 label, to loosen the association older customers might have with a loss of control in their life.\n\nYet it is still difficult for companies to persuade people they should buy specially made incontinence products.\n\n\u201cPeople keep the fact that they have incontinence secret from their loved ones, from their husbands, brothers and sisters \u2013 this is a deep secret for many consumers and yet it\u2019s just a fact of life, it\u2019s a physiological reality,\u201d said Fiona Tomlin, who leads Kimberly-Clark\u2019s adult and feminine care division.\n\nManufacturers have been particularly keen to win over women, who are more than twice as likely as men to experience bladder weakness, due to childbirth.\n\nKimberly-Clark has reached out to them directly over the years in light-hearted ad campaigns featuring actresses Whoopi Goldberg and Kirstie Alley.\n\nGraphic: Incontinence affects three times more women than men, here\n\nSECRET\u2019S OUT\n\nKimberly-Clark\u2019s Poise brand is aimed at younger women like Ellie Foster, a 31-year-old from Maine, who has struggled with leaks since having her first child a year-and-a-half ago but is too embarrassed to buy products that might help her.\n\n\u201cAt first I did, but it was definitely weird picking out adult diapers to wear,\u201d said Foster. \u201cYou feel like you\u2019re in the old lady section.\u201d\n\nSweden\u2019s Essity, the global industry leader, is also trying to reach a younger audience with its TENA brand and a new line of black, low-rise disposable underwear called Silhouette Noir.\n\nThe advert\u2019s tagline reads: \u2018secret\u2019s out: 1 in 3 women have incontinence\u2019.\n\nAround 12% of all women and 5% of men experience some form of urinary incontinence, although conditions vary from mild and temporary to serious and chronic, according to the Global Forum on Incontinence, which is backed by Essity.\n\nEssity said it tries to package and market its products in a way that avoids associations with ageing.\n\n\u201cDesigning products and packaging it as feminine and discreet as possible for females and as masculine and discreet as possible for men helps,\u201d said Ulrika Kolsrud, president of Essity\u2019s health and medical solutions.\n\nGetting the message across to potential customers can sometimes be a tricky path to tread. A few years ago, SCA (SCAb.ST) - from which Essity was spun off in 2017 - mailed samples of its products to Swedish men above 55, only to receive a barrage of complaints.\n\nBut efforts are starting to pay off. Five years ago, adult incontinence products were used by around 13% of the target adult female audience in France and the UK and that is now closer to 20%, according to research firm Kantar.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nThat does, of course, leave huge potential for further sales growth. As Kolsrud puts it: \u201cIf incontinence was a country, it would be the third largest country in the world.\u201d\n\nFor the interactive graphic, click here: here", "description": "The time may not be far off when more adults need diapers than babies as the population grows older, potentially a huge opportunity for manufacturers of incontinence products - if they can lift the stigma that has long constrained sales.", "authors": ["Richa Naidu", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191022&t=2&i=1443637541&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9L0IM", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
