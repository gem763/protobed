Now, after using a unit for a few weeks, I\u2019m sure I won\u2019t forget it. Hands down, this is my favorite dry-herb vaporizer.\n\nThere\u2019s a certain level of convenience that comes with using a high-end herb vaporizer. Rather than dealing with ashes and smoke, or sticky concentrates and leaky cartridges, you simply vaporize fresh, ground herb and discard the desiccated plant bits. It\u2019s the tastiest way to enjoy your cannabis, especially if you prefer potent, flavorful strains.\n\nUnfortunately dry-herb vapes usually fall short when it comes to the act of actually consuming cannabis. My experience is that they\u2019re great for micro-dosing or the \u201conce or twice a day\u201d user, but they\u2019re more trouble than they\u2019re worth if you\u2019re a habitual or heavy-use consumer.\n\nThe MV1 changes all that. It\u2019s the first vape I\u2019ve tried that solves the battery-life problem, overheating issues, and cleaning nightmares that other dry-herb vapes have. It\u2019s effectively an electronic one-hitter you can use all day and a session pipe you can pass around at the same time.\n\nIt can also handle concentrates, and comes with everything you need for both dry-herb and concentrate use. However I did not test it with concentrate, this review only covers its use with dry, ground herb.\n\nThough it\u2019s recently been reduced to $225, the MV1 is certainly not cheap. This puts is squarely in competition with the Pax 3 and Firefly 2+, which is a tough place for newcomer Ghost Vapes to find its first and only product. However, I\u2019m sure I won\u2019t be the only reviewer to say it\u2019s landed with aplomb. The only area I\u2019d say the competition bests the MV1 is in portability.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the looks. I love the MV1\u2019s aesthetic, but I labor to describe it. Understated steampunk? Retro-future? Whatever it is, I think it\u2019s gorgeous but I hate the flashing green lights. Everything about this thing screams elegance and then a light flashes at me like the notification signal on a smartphone. This is a personal preference, and in defense of the light, it serves the purpose of indicating that the device is on and heating, and it\u2019s a quick reference for battery life.\n\nThe MV1 comes in five different colors, I reviewed the Rose Gold unit because black and silver gadgets are a dime a dozen. They all look fantastic, but the Rose Gold seems to stand out the most to me, which may or may not be a good thing depending on where you\u2019re using it.\n\nIt\u2019s incredibly simple to use. There\u2019s a mechanical switch that releases the oven door. You pull out a \u2018crucible\u2019 and load it with herb, then plop it back in the arm. You shut the door, turn on the vape with three quick pressses on the power button, and then press and hold the operation button. After a few seconds (seriously, it\u2019s very fast) a haptic signal (vibration) lets you know your herb is ready. You then take a 10-second draw on the vape, hold your breath for a few seconds, exhale, and listen to Kid Cudi or The Beatles or something.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, the even heating of the MV1\u2019s convection system produces the best tasting and most evenly vaporized herb I\u2019ve ever vaped, and it does so consistently.\n\nWhat\u2019s innovative here is both the convection oven itself and the MV1\u2019s unique design. Typically, you have to stir your herbs halfway through a session when you\u2019re using dry-herb vapes, but the MV1\u2019s even-heating makes this unnecessary, ensuring you get the full flavor without having to burn your fingers or risk flinging dried flower everywhere if you\u2019ve over-packed and try to stir.\n\nCredit: Nicole Gray\n\nIt also has a cleverly placed heat sink that keeps the unit from overheating in your hand and keeps your vapor cool and comfortable while you\u2019re drawing it. The unit recycles heat to save energy and, thanks to a decent battery, it\u2019ll make it through a few heavy sessions before you need to charge it. Battery life is pretty good, but if you\u2019ll be using the MV1 daily you\u2019ll want the optional high-speed battery charger and an additional battery. This will take your charging time down from eight hours to two, and give you a spare to keep juiced.\n\nSpeaking of accessories, the MV1 also has an optional \u2018crucible loader\u2019 that I tried out. On first glance, I thought it was a bit excessive. But, it\u2019s one of those \u201cthey thought of everything\u201d gadgets that at least some people will welcome.\n\nIt\u2019s like a pill sorter that you put five loaded crucibles in so you can use them later. It\u2019s actually quite convenient if you\u2019re traveling \u2013 nobody wants to be sprinkling loose-leaf into a bowl in the back of a car or while walking down the beach. And, for caretakers, this could let you set up a medicinal cannabis user with doses for the day.\n\nUsing the MV1 is a breeze and so is cleanup. My biggest pet peeve with dry-herb vapes is that, once they\u2019re lousy with resin, it can be nearly impossible to clean them out. There\u2019s nothing worse than being in the middle of a session and realizing your vape\u2019s clogged. You don\u2019t have that problem with the MV1. You can access every nook and cranny that resin may build up in with ease, the MV1 comes apart intuitively to expose all those places.\n\nThe MV1 is a bit bulky, and I wish the crucible were about half-again the size it is, but otherwise I have no complaints. This is a premium product that\u2019s perfect for light-use vapers who don\u2019t want to waste herb in between uses and habitual users who go through multiple bowls per session.\n\nI highly recommend the MV1. It\u2019s my favorite vape. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a better choice on the market, at any price, for dry-herb use. You can pick one up on the Ghost Vapes website here.\n\nFor more gear, gadget, and hardware news and reviews, follow Plugged on Twitter and Flipboard.", "description": "", "authors": ["Tristan Greene", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/plugged?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2Fghostvape_feat.jpg&signature=92324cb8ffa488db941a3b2d9b5dfe85", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
