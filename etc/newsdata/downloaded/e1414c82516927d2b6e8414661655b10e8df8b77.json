We need maximum calm, he is a great player.\n\n\"It has been an added value in recent years, we must thank him. If he considers it appropriate to leave, we will satisfy him, otherwise he will consider other solutions.\"\n\n(Image: Splash News)\n\nReports claim Mandzukic is set to be offered an 18-month deal at Old Trafford, worth around \u00a34.4million per year.\n\nThat would keep him at the club until the summer of 2021 and ensure Ole Gunnar Solskjaer finally replaces Romelu Lukaku after struggling for goals since his departure.\n\nThe target man has scored 44 goals in 162 games for the Turin side since his move from Atletico Madrid in 2015.\n\n(Image: Juventus FC via Getty Images)\n\nHe is viewed as a short-term solution to United's goal drought, with Solskjaer's side failing to score more than one goal in a game since their opening day demolition of Chelsea .\n\n\"You don't have to be a rocket scientist to know it's a forward we're going to try to recruit next time,\" Solskjaer recently said.\n\n\"We're looking for some creativity and goals, but they [potential signings] have to be the right one.\n\n\"There were strikers available [in the summer] but not the ones we wanted. We couldn't get the one we wanted.\"", "description": "Juventus sporting director Fabio Paratici has provided an update on the future of Mario Mandzukic amid Man Utd rumours", "authors": ["Rich Jones", "Image", "Afp Getty Images", "Splash News", "Juventus Fc Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article13575334.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_FBL-ITA-SERIEA-AC-MILAN-JUVENTUS.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
