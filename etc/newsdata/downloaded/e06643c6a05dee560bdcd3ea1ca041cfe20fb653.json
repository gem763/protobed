Consequently, high school vapers adopt traditional cigarette use at rates 4 to 7 times those of their non-vaping peers.\n\nWhat's happening: To curb youth vaping, cities and states have begun to raise purchase ages and issue their own bans on e-cigarette flavors.\n\nMeanwhile, major retailers such as Walmart, Costco and Kroger have stopped selling e-cigarettes.\n\nYes, but: These well-intentioned measures could inadvertently jeopardize longstanding efforts to reduce adult tobacco use.\n\nWhat to watch: Despite having first asserted its authority over e-cigarettes in May 2016, the FDA acknowledged last month that it should have acted sooner and more aggressively. A groundswell of federal policy efforts could soon play catch-up.\n\nAn expected FDA ban on flavored e-cigarettes should lessen vaping's appeal to young adults. The agency has already recommended that consumers buy vaping products only in stores and refrain from using them with THC oil, which has been linked to many of the recent illnesses and deaths.\n\nThe Senate is considering a \"T21\" provision in the Lower Health Care Costs Act to raise the age of purchase for tobacco and e-cigarettes from 18 to 21 nationwide.\n\nThe bottom line: Informed federal policies and strong enforcement could help prevent nicotine addiction from taking root in a new generation.\n\nRonald DePinho is chairman of Unite to Prevent Cancer and a professor at and past president of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.", "description": "High school vapers are now turning to traditional cigarettes at higher rates.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/4UKMcaSgBefkhRJ4AiSTm6bOklk=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/10/10/1570737265841.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
