Jarrad Henderson, USA TODAY\n\nDELBARTON, W.Va. \u2013 The coal miner\u2019s son had studied his county\u2019s rough-and-tumble labor history, written his dissertation on it, taught his high school students about it.\n\nNow Eric Starr, who knew history never repeats itself, felt history doing just that. And he was part of it.\n\nStanding at a secret meeting like those held by striking miners a century ago, dressed in black except for a red bandana like the ones those miners wore, he exhorted his fellow public school teachers to defy the governor and their own unions and stay out on strike.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going back,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been sold out!\u2019\u2019\n\nEric Starr is one of the many teachers who helped lead the strikes out of Mingo County in West Virginia. A year later, not much has changed. (Photo: Jarrad Henderson, USA TODAY)\n\nThat was last winter. Mingo County teachers \u2013 with no legal right to strike, no encouragement from their union and little prospect of victory \u2013 became the first in West Virginia to vote to walk out over their health plan and their pay.\n\nThe one-day walkout spread.\n\nOn Feb. 22, 2018, teachers across West Virginia went on strike, sparking a movement that spread to other red states, including Oklahoma and Arizona, and then, this year, to Los Angeles and Denver. On Thursday, teachers plan to strike in Oakland, California.\n\nBut the 2018 West Virginia teacher strike, which changed so much nationally, didn\u2019t change that much back where it started. And on Tuesday, West Virginia teachers again staged a walkout \u2013 just to maintain the status quo.\n\nStarr sees the irony.\n\n\u201cI love seeing what\u2019s going on elsewhere,\u2019\u2019 he says. He\u2019s 28, in his fourth year of teaching. \u201cBut West Virginia can be a slow place to change.\u2019\u2019\n\nWhen the 2018 West Virginia strike ended March 7, it seemed like a great victory for public school teachers, who for years had been blamed widely for the failures of American schools, and for West Virginia schools in particular.\n\nBut history, even when it repeats itself, isn\u2019t that simple. The 2018 strike\u2019s legacy is still in doubt.\n\nThe state\u2019s promise of a dedicated funding source for public employees\u2019 health insurance \u2013 the main issue in the strike \u2013 remains unfulfilled.\n\nDespite a 5 percent raise, teacher pay remains far behind neighboring states\u2019, a disparity that explains why the year began with 700 classroom vacancies, or 4 percent of the state teacher force.\n\nThe settlement did not increase the number of school specialists, like counselors and nurses, to help students from families scarred by the state\u2019s opioid epidemic.\n\nThe teachers\u2019 vow during the strike to \u201cremember in November\u2019\u2019 produced only mixed results. Republicans, most of whom opposed teacher demands, kept control of both houses in the Legislature. This year they revived proposals that helped prompt the 2018 strike. Teachers and service personnel went on strike again.\n\nThe walkout on Tuesday closed schools in nearly every West Virginia county, and lawmakers sidelined the education legislation teachers were protesting. That's a victory for teachers.\n\nBut, teachers say, they are still waiting for the kinds of policies that would show them respect. Suspicious of the state's GOP leaders, teachers are striking again Wednesday, to ensure lawmakers don't revive the bill in question. Nearly all schools are closed.\n\nTeachers in America: No matter where they work, they feel disrespect\n\nJennyerin Steele Staats, a special education teacher from Jackson County, holds her sign aloft outside of the West Virginia Capitol on the fourth day of statewide walkouts in 2018. (Photo: Craig Hudson, Charleston Gazette-Mail via AP)\n\n'Any talks of striking'?\n\nIf last year's strike wasn\u2019t revolutionary, it was remarkable.\n\nAt a time when organized labor seems in terminal decline, a national public school teachers\u2019 movement emerged from the coalfields of southern West Virginia, one of the most isolated and conservative corners of America.\n\nAt a time when political partisanship is peaking \u2013 and despite the Democratic slant of teachers\u2019 unions \u2013 the strike united Clinton and Trump voters. It was a political unicorn: a \u201cliberal\u201d cause advocated by conservatives.\n\nBut it was no anomaly. Children here are raised on stories of battles between miners and mine companies in what came to be known as \u201cBloody Mingo.\u2019\u2019 Many of the teachers who walked out were first on picket lines when they were in diapers.\n\nYet these old passions might not have been revived without a weapon the miners never enjoyed \u2013 social media.\n\nOn Jan. 6, 2018, a teacher posted an innocent query on a Facebook page: \u201cJust curious if there are any talks of striking.\u2019\u2019\n\nSoon, there was talk of little else.\n\nPoll: Even when teachers strike, Americans give them high grades. Unions fare worse.\n\nWelcome to the Mountain State\n\nJay O\u2019Neal is a middle school social studies teacher who moved to West Virginia in 2015. After his first year, he realized that because of increasing health insurance costs, he\u2019d take home $450 less than the previous year.\n\nTeachers across the nation lost ground economically during and after the Great Recession, as states slashed education spending. West Virginia, whose signature coal industry has collapsed, ranked 48th in teacher pay before the strike, according to the National Education Association.\n\nYet teaching in West Virginia has gotten harder as students have gotten needier, partly because of the opioid crisis. Many are in a household with neither biological parent, and teachers sometimes must find ways to keep kids fed over the weekend, or get their electricity turned back on. One of O\u2019Neal\u2019s students found his father with a needle sticking out of his arm, dead of an overdose.\n\nO\u2019Neal wasn\u2019t born into West Virginia\u2019s \u201cstrike culture.\u2019\u2019 But in October 2017 he started a Facebook group page to unite members of the state\u2019s two main teacher unions, the West Virginia Education Association and the rival West Virginia Federation of Teachers.\n\nHis timing was propitious. The state\u2019s public employee health insurance agency had announced a new round of cost-saving measures. One based premiums for family coverage on the household\u2019s total income, rather than just the teacher\u2019s. Another was a wellness program that would effectively penalize those who didn\u2019t do things like provide personal biometric data, go to the gym or wear an activity tracker like a Fitbit.\n\nThe program was anathema to famously independent-minded West Virginians. What business is it of some bean-counter what my spouse makes? Or what I weigh?\n\nO\u2019Neal heard plenty of grumbling in the teachers\u2019 lounge, but little or nothing in public or on Facebook. His teachers' page had only about 1,000 members. \u201cI don\u2019t get it,\u2019\u2019 he told a friend. \u201cNothing\u2019s happening.\u2019\u2019\n\nIt was as if \"strike\" was a dirty word. \u201cEveryone was thinking about it,\u2019\u2019 recalls Eric Starr. \u201cThen someone worked up the guts to say it.\u2019\u2019\n\nEric Starr shows off a ballot used to decide if teachers, staff and administrators will go on strike to protest a controversial education bill in West Virginia. (Photo: Jarrad Henderson, USA TODAY)\n\nStrike fever\n\nThat someone was Rachel Kittle, a 32-year-old special education teacher from \u2013 no surprise \u2013 the coalfields. She didn\u2019t feel gutsy, however. Striking was just what she and her colleagues were already talking about.\n\nShortly after her Jan. 6 post \u2013 \u201cany talks of striking?\u2019\u2019 \u2013 O\u2019Neal got a message from a friend: \u201cHave you looked at Facebook?\u2019\u2019\n\nTEACHERS' VICTORY:Showed 'power of women'\n\nThere was Kittle\u2019s query, followed by an explosion of comments. The first was dismissive: \u201cThe unions are terrified and the teachers are unwilling.\u2019\u2019 But there were other voices:\n\n\u201cNot all teachers.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cThere will not be an end to the cuts until a line is drawn.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cAs long as you take it without protesting, they will keep giving it to you.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cTeachers went on strike in 1990. How did that get organized?\u2019\u2019\n\nSoon, O\u2019Neal couldn\u2019t keep up with requests to join the group.\n\nStrike fever spiked after Gov. Jim Justice, who\u2019d been elected as a Democrat with union support before becoming a Republican to back Trump, proposed a mere 1 percent raise in his State of the State address.\n\nDale Lee, president of the WVEA union, felt compelled to address the topic at a rally on Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Teachers expecting a call to the barricades were disappointed.\n\n\u201cI've heard a lot of people talk about, \"It's time for a walkout; it's time for a strike,' \" Lee said. \u201cIt's not the first step in what we should do to achieve our goals.\u2019\u2019\n\nBut this was a battle in which union leaders would be followers.\n\nEric Starr speaks with his class about economic systems at Tugg Valley High School in Williamson, W.Va. (Photo: Jarrad Henderson, USA TODAY)\n\nIt started in the coalfields\n\nOn Jan. 23, Mingo County teachers became the first in the state to decide to skip school for a day to go to the state capital to protest. They called it \u201cFed Up Friday.\u2019\u2019 Several other southern coalfield counties quickly followed suit.\n\nWithout a right to strike or bargain collectively, the teacher unions had become more practiced at lobbying the state officials who set their members\u2019 compensation than at confronting them. Now, they struggled to catch up with the rank and file. A WVFT official told the Charleston Gazette-Mail that the union didn\u2019t know how many counties had decided to walk out, but was sending staffers to county meetings \u201cto find out what\u2019s going on.\u2019\u2019\n\nOn Fed Up Friday, teachers from the coalfields gathered in the capitol rotunda in Charleston to protest. As they chanted, colleagues around the state watched.\n\nA month later, on Feb. 22, after another one-day walkout and a statewide strike authorization vote, 20,000 teachers went out.\n\nTimeline: How the 2018 West Virginia teacher strike evolved\n\nSchool was closed in all 55 counties. Superintendents, already facing a teacher shortage, didn\u2019t have nearly enough subs to hold classes. The teachers would never lose a day\u2019s pay.\n\nPublic opinion seemed with the teachers. When the attorney general said the strike was illegal and offered to go to court on behalf of county school boards, he got no takers.\n\nFive days into the strike, the governor and the union leaders, who\u2019d been negotiating, announced a settlement, including a 5 percent raise. They told teachers to go back to work two days later, on March 1.\n\nBut the Senate\u2019s Republican leaders had not signed off; the rank and file had not been consulted; and the governor, some teachers pointed out, was a coal-company owner. \u201cWe weren\u2019t gonna fall for his word,\u2019\u2019 Kittle recalls. Teachers outside the capitol chanted: \u201cBack to the table!\u2019\u2019 and \u201cWe got sold out!\u2019\u2019\n\nAt county meetings like the one in Mingo where Eric Starr spoke up, the rank and file agreed. They weren\u2019t going back \u2013 they were going wildcat.\n\nThe strikes spread\n\nMeanwhile, in Arizona, a teacher named Noah Karvelis had started a Facebook page like the one in West Virginia. Most of his colleagues supported a strike in their state, he tweeted, \u201cespecially with \u2026 WV\u2019s success.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe created a Facebook event that called on Arizona teachers to wear red: \u201cWest Virginia is showing the entire nation what happens when teachers stand in solidarity.\u2019\u2019\n\nFinally, West Virginia\u2019s Republican Senate agreed to a 5 percent raise for all state employees. And the governor promised to freeze health insurance premiums for 18 months; to create a task force to find a dedicated source of health insurance funding; and to waive higher costs for workers who didn\u2019t comply with the wellness plan.\n\nOn March 7, after nine canceled school days, the teachers went back to class.\n\nBut teachers in other states started to walk out. On April 2, Oklahoma and some counties in Kentucky; April 26, Arizona; April 27, Colorado. On May 16, North Carolina teachers staged a one-day walkout and rally.\n\nMariana Tovar, an Arizona teacher, cheers during the RedforEd walkout at the state Capitol in Phoenix on May 3. (Photo: Cheryl Evans/The Republic)\n\nA glass half empty?\n\nA year later, it\u2019s easy to emphasize what the West Virginia teacher strike didn\u2019t do.\n\nThe raise, which averaged about $2,000 per teacher, was hardly life-changing. It let teachers pay off some bills or pay down some loans, or maybe buy a car. But their colleagues continue to flee to higher-paying districts in other states. Mingo High School, for instance, has been trying since May to replace its choir director, who left for a similar job in Ohio that paid $10,000 more. No one has even applied for the vacancy.\n\nAs for health insurance, the governor has proposed $150 million in the state budget to stabilize employees\u2019 costs. But there still has been no agreement on how to insulate such funding from the yearly budget process.\n\nThe strike\u2019s political legacy is also unclear. Some fault teachers for not mobilizing enough relatives and friends to vote; some say teachers themselves didn\u2019t turn out in enough numbers, reviving memories of the pre-strike complacency that frustrated activists like O\u2019Neal.\n\nWhatever its cause, the teachers\u2019 failure in November to elect more supporters in the Legislature came back to haunt them this year.\n\nThe broad education bill that prompted Tuesday\u2019s walkout would have given teachers another 5 percent raise, but also allowed the state to establish its first charter schools. It would have let parents take taxpayer money for their child's education in public school and spend it on options such as private school. Those were the sorts of issues behind the 2018 strike.\n\nTo kill legislation that hadn't even been passed, teachers had to strike again. They won a victory in ensuring their situation didn't get worse. But it also didn't get better.\n\nTeachers and school personnel celebrate at the West Virginia Capitol after the House of Delegates voted to sideline indefinitely a controversial education bill on Tuesday. (Photo: Craig Hudson, AP)\n\nThe old-time miners went on strike against mine owners. Today, public teachers ultimately strike against taxpayers, personal or commercial. Taxpayers are voters, and voters say they\u2019re for higher teacher salaries. They also say they\u2019re against higher taxes.\n\nTalk of the nation\n\nIn one way, the strike didn\u2019t so much revive history as reverse it.\n\nWith the fall of coal, a region once famed for sometimes-cussed independence became synonymous instead with a fatalistic acceptance of the status quo and a dependence on welfare, from food stamps to disability pay.\n\nThe strike, however, put West Virginia suddenly in the vanguard of the middle working class.\n\nMingo Central High School teacher Robin Ellis is a Republican, but she has helped to lead striking teachers in West Virginia. She\u2019s the daughter of an 83-year-old retired union miner who went on strike several times. (Photo: Jarrad Henderson, USAT)\n\nNo one personifies that reversal more than Robin Ellis, a Mingo High English teacher who is also a grandmother, a social conservative, a Republican and one of the 69 percent of West Virginians (and 83 percent of Mingo residents) who voted for Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\nShe\u2019s also the daughter of an 83-year-old retired union miner who went on strike several times.\n\nDuring last year's strike, Ellis stood on her town\u2019s main street to flag down motorists and, as traffic backed up, make the teachers\u2019 case. And, like young Eric Starr, she rose at a meeting after the tentative settlement to urge her colleagues to stay out.\n\nShe says the strike was about more than money or respect. It was about an obligation to the generations past. \u201cThe word \u2018strike\u2019 prompts something in us here,\u2019\u2019 she says.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think my daddy has ever been prouder of me.\u2019\u2019\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2019/02/20/teacher-strike-west-virginia-school-closings-education-bill/2848476002/", "description": "\u201cCurious if there are any talks of striking.\u2019\u2019 How a West Virginia teacher's Facebook post started a national movement -- and why teachers struck again this week", "authors": ["Rick Hampson", "Published A.M.
