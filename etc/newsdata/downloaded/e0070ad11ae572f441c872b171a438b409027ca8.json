Not Donald Trump, on the eve of an election year, so he joined the \u201cHowdy, Modi!\u201d party here to proclaim, with the Indian prime minister, a great future of shared values and mutual reinforcement for the world\u2019s two largest democracies.\n\nIt was quite a rah-rah Lone Star State show, boasting Indian-Texan cheerleaders. It was also freighted with political significance. Less than two months after Narendra Modi, with strong backing from Parliament, revoked Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, eliminating the special autonomous status of the Kashmir region and clamping down on the mainly Muslim territory, Trump chose to signal approval by standing side-by-side with the prime minister.\n\nThe president got his biggest cheer by saying the United States was determined to help protect India from the threat of \u201cradical Islamic terrorism.\u201d As for Modi, he brought the house down when he declared that his \u201cnew India\u201d was bidding farewell to open defecation, taxes that are an obstacle to jobs, 350,000 shell companies, 80 million fake names used to defraud the government and \u2014 wait for it \u2014 Article 370.\n\n\u201cThis article has deprived the people of Jammu and Kashmir of development and equal rights,\u201d Modi said. \u201cThe forces fanning terror and terrorism were exploiting the situation.\u201d", "description": "Trump joins Modi as the Indian prime minister defends the takeover of Kashmir and casts scorn on Pakistan.", "authors": ["Roger Cohen"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/22/opinion/22Cohen/merlin_161287422_b0286c49-522f-4aae-8e9c-7c1b9020acc4-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
