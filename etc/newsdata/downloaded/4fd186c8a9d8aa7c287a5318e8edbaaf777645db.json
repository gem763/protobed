You might then wonder\u2014as The Washington Post did in a September piece\u2014whether that reflects interference by TikTok\u2019s Beijing-based parent firm, ByteDance.\n\nOn Wednesday, The Guardian reported on leaked documentation indicating that the company did suppress certain videos, specifically about Tiananmen Square, Tibetan independence, and the banned religious group Falun Gong. ByteDance told the paper that the documents in question were no longer in use, but their existence was enough to invite further speculation.\n\nAnd TikTok isn\u2019t doing one thing that would help its users stop wondering. Unlike such older social platforms as Snapchat, Instagram, and Twitter, which post regular transparency reports documenting how often governments around the world have demanded data about its users or the removal of their posts, TikTok does not. (The company did not respond to my request for comment.)\n\nGoogle pioneered the concept of the transparency report in 2010, but it took off after Edward Snowden revealed massive surveillance by the NSA, in 2013. Within the next two years, transparency reporting had spread to almost every large tech firm with a large consumer business\u2014not just Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft, but even more politics-averse corporations such as Amazon and the largest telecom carriers.", "description": "More and more companies are failing to issue transparency reports to tell consumers how much of their information governments have demanded.", "authors": ["Rob Pegoraro"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/GettyImages_1015939026/facebook.jpg?1569619405", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
