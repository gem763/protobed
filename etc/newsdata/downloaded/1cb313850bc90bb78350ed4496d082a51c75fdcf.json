Second one just left.\"\n\nThe sign is in front of a private residence in Constance Bay.\n\nMcCrimmon wrote that she struggled with what to do after seeing the sign, but decided it was important to speak out against intolerance and suggestions of violence.\n\nMcCrimmon, a Canadian Forces veteran, said she \"wore a flak jacket in Afghanistan to help secure the people there the right to vote.\"\n\nI wore a flak jacket in Afghanistan to help secure the people there, the right to vote. Damned if I would allow this to pass unchallenged. 2/2 \u2014@karenmccrimmon\n\nConservative candidate Justina McCaffrey, whose sign was pictured beside the homemade one, agreed that \"threats of political violence have no place in our democracy.\"\n\nShe said she's asked her campaign staff to remove her own sign from the property.\n\nCouldn\u2019t agree more with you, Karen. Threats of political violence have no place in our democracy. I\u2019ve instructed my campaign to remove our sign from this property. \u2014@JustinaCPC\n\nOther candidates in the rural west Ottawa riding spoke out against the sign, too.\n\nEven though the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NDP?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@NDP</a>/<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TeamCornraad?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#TeamCornraad</a> are not mentioned in these signs, I do not condone any mention of violance even in a joking manner!
