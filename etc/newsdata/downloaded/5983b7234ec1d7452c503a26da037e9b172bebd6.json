(AP) - Tommy Tolles closed with a birdie for a 7-under 65 and the first-round lead Friday in the Dominion Energy Charity Classic, the first of three tournaments in the Charles Schwab Cup playoffs.\n\nThe 52-year-old Tolles had seven birdies in the bogey-free round in cool, breezy conditions on The Country Club of Virginia\u2019s James River Course.\n\n\u201cFirst really good round of the year,\u201d Tolles said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I was saving it for, but for the most part, the whole year has just been a write-off, but that right there was something different.\n\n\u201cIt was a little bit of everything. Other than the last tee shot, I kept almost all my tee shots in play. Even if I missed a fairway, I missed it on the proper side, was able to still kind of have access to the green. I missed a couple greens, hit some great chips.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s winless in three seasons on the 50-and-over tour and entered the week 59th in the Charles Schwab Cup standings, with the top 54 advancing to the Invesco QQQ Championship on Nov. 1-3 in Thousand Oaks, California.\n\n\u201cI felt a little bit different out there,\u201d Tolles said. \u201cOnce you start to get off to a good start, start making birdies on top of birdies instead of birdies and then backing up, obviously you get into a different comfort zone or whatever and it tends to free you up a little bit. \u201c\n\nColin Montgomerie and Scott Parel shot 66, and Miguel Angel Jimenez, Retief Goosen and Rocco Mediate were at 67.\n\nMontgomerie also had a bogey-free round.\n\n\u201cIt was breezy and cold so a bogey-free round is very good,\u201d Montgomerie said. \u201cDelighted with the start. obviously. You would expect, 6 under around there today, you would expect to be leading. It\u2019s amazing the scoring around here and what people can do.\u201d\n\nCharles Schwab Cup leader Scott McCarron was at 68 with John Daly, Marco Dawson and Carlos Franco. Instead of the season points being reset, they will be continued through the Charles Schwab Cup Championship, with points counting double.\n\nBernhard Langer opened with a 70. He entered the playoffs at No. 7, his lowest ranking since the postseason began in 2016.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Tommy Tolles closed with a birdie for a 7-under 65 and the first-round lead Friday in the Dominion Energy Charity Classic, the first of three tournaments in the Charles Schwab Cup playoffs.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
