Born to German Jewish immigrants turned Confederate supporters in 1858, Untermyer described himself \u201cas one of German parentage, whose ancestors were for centuries imbedded in the soil of that land,\u201d and someone with the \u201cstrongest feeling of sympathy toward the German people.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Untermyer grew up in the clubby confines of the German immigrant elite. His law firm was a partnership of German-American relatives. He even married a non-Jewish German woman Minnie Carl.
