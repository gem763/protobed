The Department of Justice confirmed today that it is investigating Ukraine\u2019s involvement in 2016 election meddling.\n\n\u201cI would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike \u2026 I guess you have one of your wealthy people \u2026 The server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation. I think you\u2019re surrounding yourself with some of the same people. I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it. As you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance, but they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it\u2019s very important that you do it if that\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\nPrior to the release of the transcript, media and other Democrats misrepresented the phone call as an abuse of office. It is unclear how a United States president attempting to get to the bottom of foreign interference in democratic U.S. elections constitutes an abuse of power, as many Democrats have alleged in recent days. The focus on the phone call comes ahead of the much-anticipated release of an Inspector General report on political spying abuses by the Obama administration as well as declassification of materials expected to detail efforts to spy on the Obama administration\u2019s political opponents using false information.\n\nWhile the media have largely ignored Ukraine\u2019s outsize role in election meddling in 2016, a Politico article headlined \u201cUkrainian efforts to sabotage Trump backfire\u201d details the efforts former officials made to support Hillary Clinton in her campaign against Donald Trump. Much of the so-called Russia scandal involves political players in Ukraine, including Trump\u2019s former campaign manager Paul Manafort and Christopher Steele, the author of the debunked \u201cdossier\u201d alleging a grand conspiracy of collusion between Trump and Russia. Steele was secretly funded through cutouts by Clinton and the Democratic National Committee.\n\nWhile it is unclear specifically what Trump was referring to with Crowdstrike, the company founded by a Russian-born businessman was tapped by the Democratic National Committee, which funded the Steele dossier, to examine its servers after they were hacked during the 2016 campaign. The company alleged that Russian actors had hacked the server.\n\nCrowdstrike was forced to revise and retract \u201cstatements it used to buttress claims of Russian hacking during last year\u2019s American presidential election campaign\u201d after it was accused of misrepresenting data. Some cybersecurity experts strongly questioned its unequivocal claims regarding Russian hacking. Its report on Ukrainian artillery losses was widely circulated in the media before it was revised and retracted.\n\nThe Department of Justice confirmed today that Ukraine\u2019s role in 2016 election meddling is being investigated and that some Ukrainians are already cooperating with the probe. \u201cA Department of Justice team led by U.S. Attorney John Durham is separately exploring the extent to which a number of countries, including Ukraine, played a role in the counterintelligence investigation directed at the Trump campaign during the 2016 election,\u201d DOJ spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said in a statement. \u201cWhile the Attorney General has yet to contact Ukraine in connection with this investigation, certain Ukrainians who are not members of the government have volunteered information to Mr. Durham, which he is evaluating.\u201d", "description": "In a July phone call with Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump asked the leader to assist the U.S. in its investigation of foreign interference in the 2016 elections.", "authors": ["Mollie Hemingway"], "top_image": "https://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/donald-trump-for-Ukraine-piece.png", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
