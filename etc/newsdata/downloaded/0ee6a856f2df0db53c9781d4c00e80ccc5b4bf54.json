He wore them for only minutes, though, because the strap broke.\n\nHe didn\u2019t wear them when he started against Namibia on Sunday because in the warmup they fogged up in the humidity.\n\nSavea said he will persist with them because he needs to. The vision in his left eye is failing - his sight is already blurry - and he needs the goggles to protect his right eye to reduce the risk of going totally blind.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll keep training in them, and if they\u2019re working, they\u2019re working,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard with the conditions. If they\u2019re not working on game day, I\u2019ll park it up, but if they are, sweet.\u201d\n\nWith the lingering humidity and heat in the Japanese autumn, Savea said, \u201cIt\u2019s probably the worst time to try them.\n\n\u201cI sweat a lot, and having the sweat come through my eyes was pretty tough.\n\n\u201cLike anything you try that\u2019s new, it takes a bit of time (to get used to). But I\u2019ll continue on giving them a crack, and find a way that I can wear them.\u201d\n\nDuring games, Savea has an arrangement with team doctor Tony Page, who has spare goggles and a lens cleaner. Savea says he will go to Page if needed when there\u2019s breaks in play. But, so far, they haven\u2019t had to coordinate much. New Zealand next plays Italy on Saturday in Toyota in a quarterfinal decider.\n\nThe reaction to Savea wearing goggles has been overwhelmingly positive, from congratulations from the first player to wear them in test rugby, Italy\u2019s Ian McKinley, to memes on social media, to kids wearing them.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think of that when I decided to wear the goggles. Seeing youngsters being inspired to wear them now and try rugby is pretty awesome,\u201d Savea said. \u201cIt\u2019s been good to see the hype about it.\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s just about getting used to it, just trusting that process, and thinking of the bigger picture and protecting my vision.\u201d\n\nHe said a few of his fellow All Blacks have tried out the goggles.\n\n\u201cThey just like how cool it looks,\u201d he said with a grin.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The first player to wear goggles in a Rugby World Cup is having issues with them.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Foster Niumata"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
