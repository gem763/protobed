It\u2019s another to see it for yourself.\n\nI could hardly recognize this once-captivating city of breathtaking views, delectable food and cool jazz. Today it\u2019s occupied by an army of homeless men and women who have turned Baghdad-by-the-bay into Bombay-by-the-bay with some of the dirtiest slums in America.\n\nI first visited San Francisco in 1964 as a member of Barry Goldwater\u2019s political team that wrapped up the Republican presidential nomination for the candidate who offered a conservative choice, not a liberal echo.\n\nThen, we freely roamed the streets and hills of the city. Today, you watch your step lest you slip on human feces. Then, Goldwater Girls in their white cowboy hats and boots welcomed delegates and guests at the Cow Palace. Today, homeless men openly urinate in Union Square.\n\nThen, we shared copies of \u201cThe Conscience of a Conservative.\u201d Now, the homeless share their needles. Then, we opposed the legalization of marijuana. Now, Californians seem to grow more weed than oranges.\n\nWhat has happened? Why is America slouching like some rough beast \u2014 not toward Bethlehem, but Gomorrah? Beyond dispute, things feel as if they are failing apart, and the common rules of a civil society no longer seem to apply.\n\nThen, most Americans agreed that the family is the basic bloc of society. Now, according to the rising generation, the nuclear family is disappearing, gay rights take precedence over every other kind of right, Washington is accepted as primarily responsible for our welfare, and socialism is the tidal wave of the future.\n\nWhat has happened? A major reason is the influence, in and out of the academy, of political philosophers such as John Rawls, who argues that everything is relative and there is no absolute right or wrong. Rawls is the liberals\u2019 favorite philosopher because he believes, as politics professor Jerome Foss puts it, that \u201cthe purpose of government is to rectify every injustice.\u201d Not so the Founders, who instituted a system of checks and balances to limit the role of government.\n\nThe government that Rawls envisions, says Mr. Foss, \u201cis empowered to enforce a theory without any institutional restraints.\u201d So much for the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution and their reliance on certain \u201cself-evident\u201d truths, accumulated through 2,500 years of Western civilization from Jerusalem to Athens to Rome to London to Philadelphia.\n\nI was a stranger in a strange land in San Francisco as I watched the people tread the sidewalks carefully on the way to work and shrug in embarrassment about the feces and the needles and the homeless tents that sprout like weeds. I reflected on what the plain-speaking Barry Goldwater might say about the tragic decline of this once magical city, and I believe it would be something like: \u201cLet\u2019s cut out the crap and clean it up!\u201d And then he would quote Milton Friedman on the importance of freedom \u2014 and, equally, the importance of what you do with that freedom.\n\nI might have gone home depressed and saddened by what I had seen, but my next stop was Dallas. After a day among its shining skyscrapers, clean streets and parks, and optimistic can-do residents, my spirits soared. All was not lost.\n\nThe young professionals whom I met were excited about what tomorrow might bring. Dallas, not San Francisco, is the future, unless the citizens of Baghdad-by-the-bay resolve to take back their city.\n\n\u2022 Lee Edwards is the Distinguished Fellow in Conservative Thought in the B.
