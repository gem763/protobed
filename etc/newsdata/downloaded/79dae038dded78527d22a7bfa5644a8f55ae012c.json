Yes, it makes phone calls and sends texts, even if Microsoft doesn\u2019t seem to want to call it a phone (or a comeback).\n\nThe success of this surprise return to phone hardware could rest on how Microsoft intends to market it. The company\u2019s current lineup of Surface laptops and tablets is generally targeted at the high end of the electronics market \u2013 corporate users and gadget enthusiasts who value the sharp design or need the ability to blend work and personal functions on one device. Microsoft\u2019s overall strategy for the broader Surface hardware business has never been to become one of the biggest laptop or tablet sellers, and the company has only a couple of percentage points of the worldwide tablet market, according to IDC. The question is whether the company will take the same approach with the Duo phone\u2014will it be a hero device aimed at a small percentage of the market, meant to showcase how the company\u2019s cloud-based services work in a mobile world? Or is Microsoft aiming to pose a serious challenge to other smartphone makers? With the device a year away, it\u2019s not clear if Microsoft has worked out its plan yet.\n\nAt the unveiling in New York, Chief Product Officer Panos Panay took pains to focus on the Duo\u2019s similarities to other Surfaces, even as he noted that the press and analysts in the audience would headline its ability to make calls and send texts. \u201cYou\u2019re going to talk about this as a phone,\u201d he said when previewing it at the company\u2019s annual hardware event. \u201cMake no mistake, this product is a Surface.\u201d Panay even told Wired he doesn\u2019t want people to call it a phone.\n\nChief Executive Officer Satya Nadella and other executives have frequently responded to questions about whether or when Microsoft would make a phone again by pledging that the company wouldn\u2019t do so unless it had a differentiated product and a significant point of view. In the Duo, the company thinks it has just that. A portable, foldable device with two screens \u2013 not a folding screen like Samsung Electronics Co.\u2019s Galaxy Fold \u2013 that can merge Microsoft\u2019s apps with those made for Google\u2019s Android operating system.\n\nEither way, the move is significant both strategically and in historical context. Phones became the white whale of Nadella\u2019s predecessor, Steve Ballmer, who negotiated the $9.5 billion purchase of Nokia Oyj\u2019s handset business in 2013 in a desperate attempt to get traction in a growing market. Though designing and selling one model of a Surface phone is a smaller investment than that disastrous deal, another failure here would sting. It would also dent Nadella\u2019s reputation as Microsoft\u2019s turnaround king and a shrewd judge of which businesses to home in on and which to jettison.\n\nFew things represent the impotence of Microsoft\u2019s waning tech leadership in the aughts than its missteps in mobile. Indeed, even in a period when sales and profit rose and Microsoft created massive businesses in Xbox and server software, it was the poor execution and strategy in phones that colored public perception of the company. Years before Apple Inc. and Google pioneered the modern smartphone market, Microsoft began its foray into phone software in the early 2000s \u2013 and had fielded handheld-organizer programs even earlier than that. Yet its products never caught on. In 2007, then-CEO Ballmer publicly derided Apple\u2019s first iPhone, and Microsoft mobile executives had the same take on Android, arguing that Windows already offered an operating system for phone makers to load on their handsets.\n\nAs Android and Apple's iOS ate away at Windows Phone\u2019s market share, Microsoft increasingly looked to Nokia as a savior, first striking a partnership to put Windows on Nokia handsets. Ultimately Ballmer fought his board and pushed through a plan to acquire that handset business in the waning days of his tenure as CEO. Nadella, who had initially voted against the purchase when Ballmer polled his top executives, stuck with it. Less than 18 months later, that call came back to bite him as Microsoft had to write down almost the whole value of the deal. Microsoft fired most of Nokia\u2019s workers and exited the phone business.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Now that Microsoft has restored some of its former glory, the company is\u00a0going for an even more unlikely comeback: rewriting the history of its much-maligned phone business.Three years after retreating\u00a0from the smartphone business, Microsoft on Wednesday took the wraps off\u00a0the Surface", "authors": ["Dina Bass"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/OCdlnhQjnu1j4E8lNouMaw--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_technology_68/c7ae2fd1b90b10d0cbf0f95184f80861"}
