Biden \u201cwas only a good vice president because he understood how to kiss Barack Obama\u2019s ass\u201d and took aim at Minnesota\u2019s influx of Somali refugees, including liberal Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar.\n\nIn his first campaign rally since Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry against him, Mr. Trump went after Mr. Biden and his son, Hunter, over the younger Biden\u2019s lucrative deals with a Ukrainian gas company and with China while the father was vice president.\n\nTo a packed arena of 20,000 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Mr. Trump said, \u201cI want to see Hunter asked these questions: \u2018You know nothing about anything, frankly, Hunter, you\u2019re a loser. Why did you get $1.5 billion [from China], Hunter?\u201d\n\nMr. Trump went on, \u201cAnd your father was never considered smart. He was never considered a good senator. He was only a good vice president because he understood how to kiss Barack Obama\u2019s ass.\u201d\n\nIt was Mr. Trump\u2019s fourth trip to Minnesota, a state he narrowly lost to Hillary Clinton in 2016 and is campaigning hard to win next year. A Republican hasn\u2019t won the state in a presidential election since 1972.\n\nThe president was visiting the district of Somali-born Ms. Omar, with whom has been feuding continuously this year. He didn\u2019t miss the opportunity to blast the freshman lawmaker in her own backyard during his 90-minute-plus speech.\n\nHe told Minnesotans of the liberal Ms. Omar\u2019s election in 2018, \u201cI know you people\u2026. how the hell did that ever happen?\u201d\n\n\u201cCongresswoman Omar is an America-hating socialist,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cShe minimized the Sept. 11 attack on our homeland. She pleaded for compassion for ISIS recruits right here in Minnesota.\u201d\n\nThe president repeated his criticism that \u201cRep. Omar has a history of launching virulent, anti-Semitic screeds whether you like it or not.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you have such a person representing you in Minnesota? I\u2019m very angry at you people right now,\u201d the president said, tongue in cheek, before turning serious again. \u201cShe is a disgrace to our country and she is one of the big reasons that I\u2019m going to win and the Republican Party is going to win Minnesota in 13 months.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump said Minnesotans should vote for him because he\u2019s kept his promise to crack down on liberal refugee policies.\n\n\u201cAs you know, leaders in Washington brought large numbers of refugees to your state from Somalia without considering the impact on schools and communities and taxpayers,\u201d he said. \u201cI promised you that as president, I would give local communities a greater say in refugee policy and put in place enhanced vetting and responsible immigration controls. And I\u2019ve done that. Since coming into office, I have reduced refugee resettlement by 85%.\u201d\n\nHe added to cheers from the crowd, \u201cAnd as you know, maybe especially in Minnesota, I kept another promise: I issued an executive action making clear that no refugees will be resettled in any city or any state without the express written consent of that city or that state. So speak to your mayor [Democrat Jacob Frey]. Believe me, no other president would be doing that.\u201d\n\nThe president said the impeachment effort is just the latest attempt by \u201cthe wretched Washington swamp \u2026 to nullify\u201d his election.\n\n\u201cThey know they can\u2019t win the 2020 election, so they\u2019re pursuing the insane impeachment,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThey want to erase your vote like it never existed. They want to erase your voice and erase your future. But they will fail because in America, the people rule again.\u201d\n\nAmid accusations by Democrats and a whistleblower that he pressured Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate the Bidens, Mr. Trump devoted a good portion of his speech to attacking the Democratic candidate and his son. The president said he would \u201clove\u201d to run against Mr. Biden.\n\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t beat him in a debate, you\u2019ve got a big problem,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s totally owned and totally controlled by the Washington swamp.\u201d\n\nThe president said Hunter Biden has now dropped out of public view since the controversy arose.\n\n\u201cJoe\u2019s son Hunter got thrown out of the Navy and then he became a genius on Wall Street in about two days,\u201d he said. By the way, what the hell ever happened to Hunter? Where is he? Let\u2019s do another t-shirt: Where\u2019s Hunter?\u201d\n\nMr. Trump also referred to a report in the Washington Examiner Thursday night that the anonymous whistleblower who launched the impeachment inquiry against him had worked with Mr. Biden in the White House.\n\n\u201cIn a brand-new report, just came out as I\u2019m walking on the stage, hard to believe, actually, it turns out that [when] Joe Biden was vice president, he worked with the so-called whistleblower,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThis is nothing but a partisan witch hunt, sabotage. And I\u2019m sure they [the media] are going to say it\u2019s a totally unsubstantiated story.\u201d\n\nHe predicted that Democrats will suffer \u201ca backlash the likes of which we\u2019ve never seen\u201d because of their impeachment effort.\n\n\u201cDemocrats are on a crusade to destroy our democracy,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe will never let it happen. We will defeat them.\u201d\n\nThe president also referred to Turkey\u2019s military attacks this week on Kurds in northern Syria who have been allies of the U.S. in defeating the Islamic State. Mr. Trump has been criticized for withdrawing U.S. troops and abandoning the Kurds, but he said it\u2019s time to bring American soldiers home from long-term deployments in the Middle East.\n\n\u201cWe left, we won,\u201d he said. \u201cTake a victory, United States. It\u2019s time to bring them home. We\u2019ve lost thousands of brave soldiers. We spent $8 trillion. We\u2019ve done our job.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
