Ron Helus was scheduled to take place this Sunday at Newbury Park High School, but now all the donations are being returned after organizers said Thousand Oaks Police Chief Tim Hagel convinced organizations to drop out, a local Fox affiliate reported.\n\nMike Randall, vice president of the Fallen Officers Foundation, which organized the event, told the Fox affiliate that Chief Hagel called him and said the speaker list would cause a backlash.\n\n\u201cHe basically said over and over in the conversation, \u2018This is not Trump country, that slogan \u2018Make America Great\u2019 is not favorable, popular, within 1,200 square miles,\u201d Mr. Randall said. \u201c\u2018We don\u2019t want Republicans here.\u2019 I could not believe it. We were totally floored by this comment.\u201d\n\nMr. Randall said the police chief later texted him to say he was pulling out of the event after discussing the issue with the Venturas County Sheriff\u2019s Department, which also decided to drop out.\n\n\u201cHe goes, \u2018Yeah this ain\u2019t gonna work for us.\u2019 I said, \u2018You\u2019re not gonna support this with the honor guard?\u2019 and he goes, \u2018No we\u2019re not bringing the honor guard. We\u2019re not coming, we\u2019re not going to be there, not supporting it,\u2019\u201d Mr. Randall recalled.\n\nHe said they were forced to postpone the event indefinitely after other sponsors and politicians followed suit.\n\nThe Ventura County Sheriff\u2019s Department and Sheriff Bill Ayub later issued a statement explaining their decision to drop out of the event.\n\n\u201cAs the event began to materialize, we became concerned with the behavior of some of the organizers of the event,\u201d the statement said. \u201cAlthough I believe the organizers had good intentions, the event was moving in a direction we no longer felt comfortable supporting.\u201d\n\nSinger Joy Villa, who was slated the sing the national anthem at the game, slammed the department\u2019s decision as \u201cdespicable.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re shutting down an event because of the way conservatives think, because I support the president?\u201d she said, Fox reported. \u201cThis is disgusting, I\u2019m appalled, and in all my years being an out conservative, I\u2019ve never seen something so despicable like this.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
