(As this article went to press, exactly one\u2014 Mitt Romney of Utah\u2014had expressed strong concern about the president\u2019s conduct in the Ukrainian controversy.) Nor is there any evidence that impeaching the president would increase Democrats\u2019 odds of defeating him in the election. Judging by public opinion, the reverse seems more likely.\n\nOn the other hand, inaction isn\u2019t an option because it would have the effect of normalizing presidential conduct that is anything but normal\u2014and accepting the unacceptable as a fait accompli. This presents a dilemma for Democrats, many of whom believe that there are only two paths\u2014impeaching the president or doing nothing.\n\nFortunately for them and for the country, there is a third choice, provided by law: a resolution formally censuring the president. There is precedent. In 1834 the Senate censured President Andrew Jackson for withholding documents related to his defunding the Bank of the United States, one of the most hotly disputed decisions of his presidency.", "description": "", "authors": ["William Galston", "Wsj.Com Articles"], "top_image": ""}
