Scheer has failed to draw crowds to his campaign events, and has been forced to defend past remarks on same-sex marriage and abortion.\n\nCanada leaders' debate: tarnished Trudeau puts climate crisis at heart of election Read more\n\nAnd even after the prime minister became entangled in two scandals \u2013 ethics violations and images showing him in racist blackface, polls show Scheer and Trudeau locked in a dead heat. Conservative strategists worry that Scheer has failed to galvanize voters \u2013 and that Ford has become so toxic that he is hampering the party\u2019s chances of forming a government.\n\nAs recently as late spring, Conservatives were basking in poll numbers that put them comfortably ahead of Trudeau\u2019s party.\n\nAnd in Ontario \u2013 where the Conservatives were overturning the legacy of an unpopular Liberal provincial government \u2013 the federal party was confident they had a strong ally.\n\nFord was a relatively new face to mainstream conservative politics: his early political career was overshadowed by his younger brother Rob, the notorious former Toronto mayor who admitted smoking crack while in office.\n\nDespite several years as a city councillor, the elder Ford only entered provincial politics after his brother\u2019s death, and his candidacy was initially viewed with skepticism.\n\nBut his blunt language and appeal to \u201cthe common folk\u201d soon drew comparisons with Donald Trump. And after he became premier of Ontario, Ford was quickly elevated to celebrity status within conservative circles, often appearing with Scheer at party events.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m putting the prime minister on notice,\u201d Ford told a cheering crowd last year. \u201cJustin Trudeau, you\u2019re next.\u201d\n\nIn recent months, however, Ford has experienced a stunning reversal of fortune. His government has been dogged by protests over steep cuts to education, patronage scandals and looming labour strikes.\n\nFord has also gone to war with the federal government over a carbon tax, spending millions on a legal fight the majority of Ontario residents oppose. His approval rating has dropped to 25%, making him the second-most disliked premier in the country.\n\n\u201cHe came in really wanting to quickly undo a lot of the signature policies of the previous government,\u201d said Omar Yan Khan, a political strategist in Toronto.\n\n\u201c[Ford\u2019s government] have been getting quite a bit of blowback from some of those decisions and it\u2019s led to a little bit of buyer\u2019s remorse on the part of many in the Ontario electorate.\u201d\n\nA recent poll from the Angus Reid Institute found that 85% of Ontario says the \u201cpolicies and actions\u201d of Ford\u2019s government would make them less likely to vote for Scheer\u2019s Conservatives in the federal election \u2013 and 71% suggested it would direct them towards the Liberals.\n\nBecause of Ontario\u2019s electoral weight, it is virtually impossible for a party to win a general election in Canada without success in the province.\n\nTrudeau's environmental record on the line in Canada election year Read more\n\nConservatives have traditionally done well in the region\u2019s rural areas, but the 21 October election is likely to hinge on the ethnically diverse suburbs of Toronto, a suburban sprawl known as the 905 (for its dialing code).\n\n905 voters can be fickle: they granted the Conservatives a majority in 2011 \u2013 only to snatch it back in 2015, when Trudeau swept the province.\n\nEarlier this year, the Conservatives held a 10-point lead over the Liberals in Ontario \u2013 but that has now become a 10-point deficit, driven largely by Ford\u2019s unpopularity, said Frank Graves, head of polling firm Ekos Research. \u201cThat\u2019s an enormous transfer of seats from one side of the ledger to the other,\u201d he said.\n\nThe cold math of parliament suggests Scheer, who has no viable allies on the right, needs to win an outright majority to have any hope of forming a government.\n\nAnything short of this allows Trudeau to strike deals with left-of-centre parties to stay in power.\n\n\u201cOntario is now turning into something of a political proxy war,\u201d said Shachi Kurl, executive director at Angus Reid. \u201cAnd Scheer is dealing with the Ford factor, which is a drag on the Conservative\u2019s political fortunes.\u201d\n\nBefore Trudeau swept to power in 2015, the Conservatives governed Canada for nearly a decade and they retain immense support in rural areas and the western heartlands of the country\u2019s oil industry.\n\nBut in an election taking place amid a climate emergency and rising income inequality, the party\u2019s pledge to quash carbon pricing legislation and cut taxes have not resonated with voters.\n\nMeanwhile, Scheer, who narrowly won control of the party in 2017, has struggled to carve out a distinct identity, lacking the charisma \u2013 and name recognition of Trudeau.\n\nGentrification under Trudeau's nose: how his electoral district is struggling with evictions Read more\n\nEager to capitalize on Conservative weaknesses in Ontario, Trudeau has taken to mentioning Ford every at every opportunity \u2013 so much so that at the last leaders\u2019 debate on Monday, Scheer accused the prime minister of being \u201coddly obsessed with provincial politics\u201d.\n\nBut in a tacit admission that Ford is electoral kryptonite, the Conservatives recently took the unprecedented step of parachuting in a different Conservative premier to campaign in Ontario. Over the weekend, the Alberta premier, Jason Kenney, toured the south of the province, stumping for Scheer.
