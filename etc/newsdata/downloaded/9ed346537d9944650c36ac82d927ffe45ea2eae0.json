Let\u2019s break down which iPhone 11 might be best for you, and whether or not it\u2019s actually time for an upgrade.\n\nAside from some hands-on time with the new iPhone 11, 11 Pro, and 11 Pro Max after Apple\u2019s event earlier this week, we haven\u2019t yet had an opportunity to test drive any of the new hardware.\n\nWe\u2019ll be sharing more in-depth analysis of the new iPhones in the coming weeks, but for now, we\u2019ve got enough information to make some well-educated decisions for today, September 13, when Apple officially begins iPhone 11 pre-orders.\n\nFor Most People\u2026\n\nBuy the 128GB iPhone 11 in black\n\nWhy iPhone 11?\n\nLast September we recommended the mid-range iPhone XS for those looking to upgrade right away. But this year we\u2019re instead giving the nod to the entry-level iPhone 11. Starting at $1,199 it\u2019s around $600 cheaper than the iPhone 11 Pro.\n\nThe iPhone 11 might not have the triple-camera setup that the 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max do, but its double camera setup will be more than adequate for even shutterbugs. All of the advanced features of Apple\u2019s Portrait mode are included, as well as the front-facing 12-megapixel camera with slow-motion \u201cslofie\u201d capabilities. The iPhone 11 also runs the same A13 Bionic processor as the 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max, and Apple promises an extra hour of battery life over the iPhone XR.\n\nYou\u2019ll lose bragging rights given the iPhone 11 still uses an LCD with lower resolution than the 11 Pro\u2019s OLED screen. And overall, the 11 is slightly larger and heavier than the next step up, but you can use the money you save to buy an Apple Watch Series 3 and still have some money leftover.\n\nWhy 128GB?\n\nIf you do anything more than make calls on your iPhone, 64GB is simply not enough storage. Games on the iTunes App Store now regularly weigh in at a few gigs in size, photos snapped with a 12MP camera quickly add up, and now that you can make slow-motion \u201cslofie\u201d videos using the iPhone 11's front camera, you\u2019re going to find 64GB of storage disappearing faster than ever.\n\nThe storage capacity decisions were a little easier with the iPhone XS last year as Apple had eliminated the 128GB option, offering 256GB of storage for just $150 more than the 64GB base model. But with the iPhone 11 your options are limited to 128GB for an extra $80, or 256GB for an extra $250.\n\nGiven the increased cost of storage, we recommend the 128GB upgrade and then relying on cloud-based services to offload and backup photos and videos as often as possible to ensure you don\u2019t max out your device. But if running out of storage is just too stressful a thought to manage, the 256GB option should keep you safe for another year.\n\n...But maybe try the 256GB iPhone 11 Pro in space grey if photography is your thing?\n\nThey say the best camera is the one you have with you, and if one upgrade stands out among the updates Apple made to the iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max, it\u2019s the shooting capabilities of the device you already carry around all day long.\n\nThe addition of a third camera on the back might seem excessive, but it allows the iPhone 11 Pro to finally both zoom in and out on a scene without resorting to digital trickery which never yields optimal results. That\u2019s a feature that\u2019s typically been the domain of dedicated shooters, but on the iPhone 11, it manages to justify the device\u2019s \u201cPro\u201d moniker.\n\nThe iPhone has also become a legitimate replacement for bulky video cameras with 4K and slo-mo capabilities. With the 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max\u2019s triple-camera setup, videographers can now capture three different takes of a scene at varying zoom levels\u2014all at the same time. The iPhone 11 Pro is $550 more than the iPhone 11, and upgrading the 64GB base model to 256GB of storage, which is all but essential for extensive photography use, adds another $250 on top of that.\n\nBut for $1,999 you also get Apple\u2019s best and brightest HDR OLED display which is ideal for doing photo edits right on the device, an upgrade to a stainless steel housing instead of aluminium, and four extra hours of battery life compared to the iPhone XS. The improvements made to the iPhone 11 line\u2019s 4G LTE performance will also be appreciated once you start trying to back up photos to the cloud.\n\nThere are exceptions\u2026\n\nEveryone uses their phones differently and has unique needs for the device they carry around and use all day long.\n\nWhy iPhone 11 Pro Max?\n\nIt\u2019s all about that bigger 6.5-inch OLED screen. It offers more resolution than the other two iPhone 11 models making it the ideal viewfinder for photographers, videographers, and editors. Bigger isn\u2019t always better, but at 6.2 inches tall the iPhone 11 Pro Max has the same guts as the iPhone 11 line, leaving some extra room for a bigger battery inside. Apple claims it will run five hours longer than last year\u2019s iPhone XS Max, which should go a long way to helping your charging anxieties.\n\nWhy iPhone XR?\n\nThe iPhone XR was Apple\u2019s best selling phone in 2018 and even outsold all of the competition through the first half of 2019. It\u2019s still an excellent phone with FaceID security, a beautiful edge-to-edge screen with the Home button removed and some Portrait Mode capabilities thanks to a clever use of AI to add photographic effects like background blur to your shots.\n\nWhy iPhone 8?\n\nReleased alongside the original iPhone X, the iPhone 8 is a few years old now, but Apple is still keeping it around. At $859 for the 128GB model, or $1,029 for the larger 128GB iPhone 8 Plus, it\u2019s still an excellent smartphone and offers one feature that none of Apple\u2019s higher-end models do: a physical home button with Touch ID fingerprint security for those still not sure about Face ID.\n\nIt\u2019s also the perfect choice if you\u2019ve got parents who\u2019ve been using iPhones for years and you don\u2019t want to have to teach them how to memorise all of the new gestures needed to navigate the iPhone X and above. When their iPhone SE or iPhone 6 finally dies, the iPhone 8 is a solid upgrade path.\n\nWhy iPhone?\n\nDid Apple\u2019s latest reveals leave you wanting more? Does the iPhone feel like it\u2019s no longer the innovation leader? Here are some excellent alternatives if you\u2019re thinking of jumping ship and switching platforms.\n\nJust don\u2019t upgrade\n\nHow long has it been since your last iPhone upgrade? Do you really find yourself frustrated with your current iPhone\u2019s capabilities? The past few iPhone upgrades haven\u2019t exactly been giant leaps, and the performance improvements made to the latest and greatest iPhones aren\u2019t really obvious unless you\u2019re playing graphically intense games.\n\nDo your friends care if the photo you just shared to Instagram was taken with a 10-megapixel or 12-megapixel camera? Do you ever actually use the iPhone X\u2019s Portrait Mode features? You just spent an entire summer with your current iPhone, capturing memorable moments, sharing them with friends, and staying connected to each other. Unless your iPhone is physically broken, it\u2019s going to keep on working just fine, and your friends will still keep in touch if you\u2019re using last year\u2019s model.\n\nIf you still need that annual ego boost, just remind your early-adopting friends that making iPhones and even recycling iPhones takes quite a toll on the environment and the Earth\u2019s natural resources, despite Apple\u2019s claims to the contrary. By skipping the iPhone 11 lineup, you\u2019re doing your part to battle climate change.", "description": "Another September is here, and as we say goodbye to the Winter, we once again say hello to the agonising upgrade decisions following Apple\u2019s annual iPhone event.
