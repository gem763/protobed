The custodial sentence was less than prosecutors asked for.\n\nThe star of Desperate Housewives and other hits pleaded guilty in May, to a single count of conspiracy and fraud, after admitting to paying $15,000 to boost her older daughter\u2019s SAT scores in 2017 with the help of William \u201cRick\u201d Singer, an admission consultant. She was the first parent to be sentenced among 34 charged in the scheme.\n\nHuffman also received a a $30,000 fine, 250 hours community service and a year probation.\n\nThey argued that lesser penalties, including probation, would mean little to someone with \u201ca large home in the Hollywood Hills with an infinity pool\u201d. A large fine, they said, would be \u201clittle more than a rounding error\u201d for someone worth tens of millions of dollars.\n\nHuffman\u2019s lawyers said she should get a year of probation, 250 hours of community service and a $20,000 fine. They said she was only a \u201ccustomer\u201d in the scheme and that, in other cases of academic fraud, only the ringleaders have gone to prison.\n\nThe case was seen as an indicator of what is to come for others. Over the next two months, nearly a dozen other parents are scheduled to be sentenced. A total of 15 parents have pleaded guilty while 19 are fighting the charges.\n\nOn Friday Huffman held hands with her husband, the actor William H Macy, as they arrived at federal court in Boston. She did not speak to reporters. Macy was not charged.\n\nHours before Huffman\u2019s sentencing, a federal judge announced that the size of bribes paid in the case would not necessarily influence the severity of sentences. That settled a dispute between prosecutors, who said bigger bribes should lead to sharper penalties, and the court\u2019s probation office, which disagreed after concluding that the scheme caused no financial loss.\n\nThe US district judge Indira Talwani sided with the probation office but said all factors would be considered in sentencing decisions.\n\nThe amount Huffman paid is relatively low compared with other bribes alleged in the scheme. Some parents are accused of paying up to $500,000 to get their children into elite schools by having them labeled as recruited athletes for sports they didn\u2019t even play.\n\nIn a 4 September letter asking for leniency, Huffman said she turned to the scheme because her daughter\u2019s low math scores jeopardized her dream of going to college and pursuing a career in acting. She now carries \u201ca deep and abiding shame\u201d, she said.\n\nProsecutors countered that Huffman knew the scheme was wrong but chose to participate anyway. They said she wasn\u2019t driven by need or desperation, \u201cbut by a sense of entitlement, or at least moral cluelessness\u201d.\n\nAmong those fighting the charges are the actor Lori Loughlin and her fashion designer husband, Mossimo Giannulli, who are accused of paying to get their two daughters admitted to the University of Southern California as fake athletes.\n\nAuthorities say it is the biggest college admissions case ever prosecuted by the justice department, with a total of 51 people charged.", "description": "Actor pleaded guilty in May to conspiracy and fraud after admitting to paying $15,000 to boost daughter\u2019s SAT scores", "authors": ["Associated Press In Boston"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/caeaaaddcff0ca11d083e1b59f04840d2aa1db55/0_381_3434_2060/master/3434.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f99608ff03b44c56f720a7692faaeb5b", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
