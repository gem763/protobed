So many of my childhood memories involve my father, the church, and his ministry. One of my earliest memories is walking into my parent\u2019s room one Sunday morning before church. As I walked into the doorway I saw my dad pacing back and forth, referencing his notes and preaching his sermon for the perfectly pressed suits in his closet.\n\nWhen I was young I didn\u2019t pay too much attention to his job, other than the fact that everyone knew my name and everyone wanted to shake dad\u2019s hand after services. I was never bothered that we were always the first to arrive or the last to leave the building \u2013 I loved playing hide and seek in the pews and the nursery with my friends while my parents did their thing.\n\nWhen I was in high school, my dad\u2019s profession sometimes struck me as an inconvenience, when well-meaning church members gave me unsolicited advice about something I was wearing or a boy I was seeing. It wasn\u2019t always fun to have to be at every church potluck or youth event, and I found myself annoyed when we were late to my favorite place for Sunday lunch because dad had been cornered after a service to talk with a member.\n\nCHICAGO SUED BY STUDENTS BLOCKED FROM SPREADING THE GOSPEL AT MILLENNIUM PARK\n\nAs it can be at that age, I was in my own little world. I didn\u2019t see the heavyweight he carried in his role. I loved hearing him preach and I was in awe of his ability to share the Gospel, but naively I assumed it was all very easy for him.\n\nNow I\u2019m older and maybe a little wiser, married to a pastor and seeing my father\u2019s lifelong ministry in a brand new light. There was so much I didn\u2019t realize or grasp about my father\u2019s ministry until I grew up.\n\nHe\u2019s been a minister for 40 years now and I think back on how he was done so much to be the hands and feet of Jesus. He has conducted countless weddings and funerals, prayed with widows, sat with families before surgeries and been the person to make the call no one should ever have to make after a terrible accident.\n\nFor 40 years, with the help of my wonderful mother, he has served others and answered God\u2019s call on his life to be a fisher of men. He loves sharing God\u2019s great love and I dare say he\u2019s one of the best, but like most pastors, there is so much you don\u2019t see.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nYou don\u2019t see the hours upon hours he spends studying.\n\nYou don\u2019t see how he still gets \"nervous sick\" every Sunday morning, unable to eat breakfast, because he wants to speak the truth boldly and in love.\n\nYou don\u2019t see how he gives every bit of his energy teaching and preaching and greeting and counseling all day every Sunday so then he crashes hard that night at home.\n\nChurch, I\u2019m here to challenge you today to take a few minutes and write your pastor a thank you note.

They are not immune to Satan\u2019s attacks because of their title. They are flawed humans striving to be a little more like Jesus every day and to make this world a better place. They carry their own burdens and oftentimes, the burdens of so many.\n\nThey lose their tempers, they fly off the handle, and sometimes, they want to throw in the towel completely because sometimes, the weight feels too heavy.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWords fail me when I think about the string of suicides involving high-profile pastors at large churches this year.
