(AP) - An official at a Virginia high school says some of its football players have been punished for using racist taunts and slurs against their opponents in two social media videos.\n\nThe Daily Press reports Poquoson City Public Schools Superintendent Jennifer Parish didn\u2019t release the identity of the city high school students or say how they were punished. The videos appear to show Poquoson High students and some school football players at an off-campus party and feature threats and obscene language.\n\nThe school forfeited a football game last week over the videos and is set to play against a different high school on Thursday. Parish says the school is \u201cmoving forward.\u201d Police Chief Cliff Bowen said there\u2019s \u201cno probable cause\u201d for arrests based on the video, but an investigation remains ongoing.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Daily Press, http://www.dailypress.com/\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "An official at a Virginia high school says some of its football players have been punished for using racist taunts and slurs against their opponents in two social media videos.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
