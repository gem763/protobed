Anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller brought a case in England, while a cross-party group of MPs and peers launched a separate challenge in Scotland. A third case was heard in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe English and Northern Irish courts ruled with the government, while Scotland\u2019s Court of Session decided that the suspension of parliament was unlawful.\n\nThe Supreme Court will hear three days of evidence before making a ruling that could have a seismic impact on the future of Mr Johnson\u2019s government and the fate of Brexit.\n\nSir John Major, the former prime minister, is expected to address the court in support of Ms Miller\u2019s case on Thursday.\n\nOpening the hearing on behalf of Ms Miller, Lord Pannick, a prominent barrister, told the 11 judges that \u201cno prime minister has abused his power in the manner in which we allege in at least the last 50 years.\u201d\n\nHe said Mr Johnson had acted unlawfully by advising the Queen to prorogue parliament for an \u201cexceptional\u201d length of time, telling the court: \u201cThe exceptional length of the prorogation in this case is strong evidence that the prime minister\u2019s motive was to silence parliament for that period because he sees parliament as an obstacle to the furtherance of his political aims.\u201d\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

He insisted that parliament was suspended to allow for a Queen\u2019s Speech.\n\nHe said it was not true that the decision had resulted in parliament being closed for five weeks, because much of that period was covered by the usual three-week parliamentary recess for party conferences.\n\nAs a result, he said, Mr Johnson\u2019s decision meant \u201cthat only seven sitting days would be lost to parliament if it was prorogued during that period\u201d.\n\nHowever, in a significant exchange under questioning from Supreme Court judge Lord Kerr, Lord Keen appeared unable to explain why parliament had needed to be prorogued in early September to allow for a Queen\u2019s Speech in mid-October. He was forced to accept that a suspension beginning as late as early October could still have resulted in the Queen\u2019s Speech taking place on the same day \u2013 14 October.\n\nCrucially, it is unclear what will happen if the court rules that Mr Johnson\u2019s advice to the Queen was unlawful.\n\nWhile he insisted that the government would abide by the ruling, Lord Keen refused to rule out Mr Johnson simply proroguing parliament again.\n\nAsked whether this was a possibility, he replied: \u201cI\u2019m not in a position to comment on that.\n\n\u201cThat will have to be addressed by the decision maker.\u201d\n\nOne of the judges, Lord Carnwath, asked for the issue to be clarified in writing on behalf of the prime minister.\n\nWhile dozens of pro-Brexit and anti-Brexit protesters clashed outside the court, other members of the public queued for hours to secure front-row seats at the historic proceedings.\n\nMillions more tuned in online, with the Supreme Court live stream accessed 4.4 million times during the morning session alone.

Getty\n\nAt the centre of the complex case is the question of whether the decision to prorogue parliament is justiciable \u2013 in other words, a matter for the courts.\n\nLord Pannick insisted that it was \u201cwell-established that the executive is answerable to parliament for matters of politics and answerable to the courts for matters of law\u201d.\n\nHe said that, if the court rules that the issue is not justiciable, the judges would effectively be saying that there is nothing to stop the prime minister suspending parliament for as long as he or she saw fit \u2013 a deeply worrying precedent, he claimed.\n\nBut Lord Keen said parliament had had the opportunity to legislate to block the prorogation and did not do so, and that the issue was not a matter for the courts.\n\nHe said: \u201cInsofar as the Inner House [of the Court of Session] has sought to declare the prorogation unlawful, I will take no issue with their order. But, insofar as they purport to declare that the prorogation is null and of no effect, I submit that they have simply gone where the court could not go.\u201d\n\nThe issue is one of the central questions that the 11 judges will have to decide on later this week. Downing Street will be watching the case closely, knowing the verdict could have a major impact on the future of Brexit \u2013 not to mention that of Mr Johnson\u2019s government.", "description": "Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend parliament was an abuse of power not seen for at least 50 years, Britain\u2019s highest court has heard.
