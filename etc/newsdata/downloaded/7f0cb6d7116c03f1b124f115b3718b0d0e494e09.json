The young man was said to have \u201cnever been to school.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe said he needed help and wanted to put an end to the situation he was in,\u201d Chris Westerbeek, the pub\u2019s owner, told the the Dutch news outlet, Dagblad Noorden.\n\nWesterbeek added that the young man snuck out of the home in the middle of the night because he was closely watched during the day.\n\nWhen police arrived at the farmhouse, they discovered a secret staircase hidden behind a cupboard in the living room that led them to the living space underneath the house.\n\nAuthorities discovered that the family had been living in the \u201cenclosed space\u201d for up to seven years and were cloistered there because they expected a cataclysm to befall the world.\n\nA neighbor told the Dutch newspaper that he did not even know that there was more than just the one person he ever saw living on the property.\n\nAuthorities found that the family had created a self-sustaining vegetable farm and needed almost no contact with the outside world.\n\nOfficials are still investigating and trying to ascertain the familial relationships between the seven people found living in the cellar.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.", "description": "Officials became involved when the parents of a family near the town of Ruinerwold were flagged for not sending their children to school.", "authors": ["Warner Todd Huston"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-618830118-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
