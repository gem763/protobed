They Can't Say Why Not.", "language": "en", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS Sen. John Cornyn said Donald Trump's call with the Ukrainian president, in which Trump repeatedly pressured him to investigate Joe Biden during a conversation about U.S. aid to Ukraine, was definitely not a quid pro quo. But he wouldn't say why not.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2015 When Republicans headed home late last week for a two-week recess, they were armed with White House talking points to help them try to defend the bombshell revelation that President Donald Trump pressured a foreign government to interfere in the 2020 U.S. election to help him win.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be clear, there was no quid pro quo for Ukraine to get US aid in exchange for looking into Biden or his son,\u201d reads one of the talking points.\n\nIt\u2019s a reference to what we all learned last week when the White House released a summary of a July phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky: that Trump pressed Zelensky to \u201cdo us a favor\u201d and investigate potential 2020 rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter. More than that, Trump repeatedly made his request during a conversation about U.S. military aid to Ukraine after complaining that Ukraine has not reciprocated adequately in exchange for that aid.\n\nWas this a quid pro quo? It certainly looks like it. Trump even used the words \u201cdo us a favor\u201d as he dangled something in front of Zelensky that he desperately needs. If this wasn\u2019t a quid pro quo \u2015 which Republicans are being coached to say \u2015 then what would have to be different about this phone conversation to make it so?\n\nHuffPost posed this question to Senate Republicans as they were trying to get out of town on Thursday. Predictably, some insisted it was not a tit-for-tat conversation.\n\n\u201cDo I think it amounts to a quid pro quo? Absolutely not,\u201d said Sen. John Cornyn (Texas).\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Sen. Tim Scott (S.C.). \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you can extrapolate to that,\u201d added Sen. Pat Toomey (Pa.).\n\nOK, what needs to be different about the call to constitute a quid pro quo?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to speculate on things like that,\u201d Cornyn said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even think about it,\u201d said Scott, slipping into a senators-only elevator.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to get into a bunch of hypotheticals about what the president could have said that he didn\u2019t say,\u201d Toomey said.\n\nLegally, the answer doesn\u2019t really matter; the mere fact that Trump tried to solicit a favor from Zelensky in connection with a U.S. election could be a federal crime. But if GOP lawmakers plan to use the no-quid-pro-quo talking point, they ought to at least be able to say why.\n\nSen. James Inhofe (Okla.) said he saw no quid pro quo, but seemed befuddled when asked what would need to be different about that phone conversation to qualify.\n\n\u201cWhat would it look like?\u201d he asked. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of a tough question.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Sen. James Inhofe said it's a \"tough question\" on whether Trump pressuring the Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden during a discussion on U.S. aid to the country counts as a quid pro quo.\n\nSome Republican senators avoided the question altogether.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not discussing it at all,\u201d Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) said, walking briskly away from reporters. \u201cRight now, I have more questions than I have answers.\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t read it,\u201d Sen. Mike Crapo (Idaho) said of the summary of the phone call, which had been released more than 24 hours earlier and was all the talk on the Hill. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not commenting on any of that,\u201d said Mike Enzi (Wyo.). Asked if he had read the phone call summary, he only repeated, \u201cI\u2019m not commenting on any of that.\u201d\n\nOthers feigned ignorance.\n\n\u201cWhat I saw, he asked him to look into something but I \u2015 I\u2019m new,\u201d said Sen. Rick Scott (Fla.), who has been a U.S. senator since January and was the governor of Florida from 2011 to 2019. \u201cThere\u2019s got to be a process.\u201d\n\nRegardless of the talking points Republicans use to defend the president, the situation is clearly stressing out some of them. Sen. David Perdue (Ga.) snapped at reporters on Thursday as they asked for comment in response to the whistleblower complaint against Trump released earlier that day. It revealed even more damning details about the president\u2019s conversations with Ukraine and White House efforts to cover them up.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, it\u2019s not a whistleblower,\u201d Perdue falsely claimed, walking quickly down a Senate hallway with reporters trailing him. \u201cThis is second or third or fourthhand information.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut in terms of the information...\u201d began a reporter.\n\n\u201cExcuse me, you asked me a question,\u201d Perdue interrupted. \u201cLet me answer the goddamn question.\u201d", "description": "\"That\u2019s kind of a tough question,\" Sen.
