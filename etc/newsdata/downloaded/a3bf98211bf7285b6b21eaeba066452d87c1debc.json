Fraser added: 'As I see it today, there's potential merit in being private simply to get away from the capital markets.'\n\nHe told the Mail he blamed markets for Sirius's struggles to raise more cash, saying banks and other big institutions that would usually commit to funding were 'failing' companies.\n\nThe chief executive's comments came at a sensitive time for Sirius, which is in a review process and has publicly said it is weighing up two options \u2013 either trying to raise more funding through the debt markets or by bringing in a strategic investor.\n\nThe business has enough money to keep trading until next spring but it is also cutting costs \u2013 including hundreds of jobs \u2013 in the meantime.\n\nBringing in a partner would likely cement investors' losses as it would dilute current shareholders' stakes.\n\nBut after Fraser's intervention, Sirius said there were no plans to quit the stock market. A spokesman added: 'Our focus is on completing our strategic review and unlocking the value of our project for our shareholders, our community, and the UK as a whole.'\n\nFraser brought Sirius to the market in 2011 by reversing his group, York Potash, into an existing company.\n\nThe ambitious mining project, based a few miles away from the seaside town of Whitby, grabbed the imagination of 85,000 retail investors who piled in to support the company.\n\nIts share price hit a high of 44p in 2016 but has since tumbled to 3.4p last night, falling another 4.3 per cent, or 0.15p yesterday, stinging retail investors for their loyalty.\n\nSomeone who bought \u00a310,000 of shares in August 2016 would have around \u00a3766-worth now.\n\nWhile Sirius's mining project has huge set-up costs, the company has always insisted that, once constructed, it would be cheap to run.\n\nAs well as building two mile-deep shafts to get to a deposit of polyhalite, it is also constructing a 23-mile-long tunnel to house a conveyor belt that would transport chipped pieces of rock from the mine to a port on Teesside.\n\nThere, it would be crushed and processed into fine granules that could easily be spread on crops by farmers.", "description": "Chris Fraser last week suggested the company, which plans to build a \u00a34 billion potash mine under the North York Moors National Park, may be better off quitting the stock market.", "authors": ["Francesca Washtell For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
