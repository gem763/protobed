Bullish pre-season talk and plenty of investment led many Evertonians to believe that this was the \u00adseason to crash the top-six party. They still might but, with a meagre 10 points from as many games, Marco Silva\u2019s side are in the bottom, not top, six.\n\nDespite renewed optimism following a convincing home win over West Ham United, Everton\u2019s travails continue away from Goodison Park, most recently seen in their dramatic and controversial 3-2 \u00addefeat by Brighton, whom they now trail by two points. They have collected only a solitary point away from home so far this season.\n\nThose supporters calling for change may be casting envious glances towards the Amex Stadium, where Graham Potter is bringing about a new \u00adculture and playing style with the early signs \u00adencouraging.\n\nAppreciative of his achievements but increasingly restless with Chris Hughton\u2019s more pragmatic \u00adapproach, Brighton gambled and went for a man untested at the highest level.\n\nShould the Goodison hierarchy make a change, then an equally bold appointment may be needed if they are to truly disrupt the Premier League \u00adpecking order.", "description": "On Saturday evening #Silvaout was once again trending on Twitter.", "authors": ["Tom Prentki", "Chris Bascombe", "Keith Hackett"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/27/TELEMMGLPICT000214204370-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqQD_lvq6mq_uCaUPZ98j-IAIP039L9PQwt-L9kNZIh0c.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
