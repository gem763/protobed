But, adhering to White House instructions, he declined to answer questions on matters not included in the Mueller report, incensing Democrats on the panel as he did so.\n\nLess than three hours into the hearing, a visibly frustrated House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D., N.Y.) told the room: \u201cArticle III of the Nixon impeachment was based on this kind of obstruction of Congress by President Nixon.\u201d The hearing was aimed at helping House Democrats determine whether to recommend articles of impeachment against Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cYour behavior in this hearing room has been completely unacceptable,\u201d Mr. Nadler told Mr. Lewandowski as he concluded the hearing. He said voting to hold Mr. Lewandowski in contempt of Congress was \u201ccertainly under consideration.\u201d\n\nMr. Lewandowski\u2019s testimony was the latest example of the challenge Democrats face in investigating the Trump administration, which has ranged from unresponsive to combative in its responses to the dozens of subpoenas and document requests the House has sent its way. Holding a hearing with a subject like Mr. Lewandowski allows Democrats to highlight the White House\u2019s obstruction of its investigations, but also exposes the limits of the panel\u2019s ability to obtain new information.\n\nThe hearing whiplashed between frustrated Democrats criticizing Mr. Lewandowski for refusing to answer even the most basic questions about his interactions with Mr. Trump, and sympathetic Republicans praising his leadership of the Trump campaign and asking him about his favorite football team.\n\nOn Thursday, the House Judiciary Committee approved a resolution to formalize procedures for its Trump impeachment investigation.

Hank Johnson (D., Ga.) declared about an hour in. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to get an answer out of you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you for putting up with the harassment that you\u2019re putting up with right now,\u201d Rep. Ken Buck (R., Colo.) told the former campaign manager moments later.\n\nMr. Lewandowski\u2019s most revealing comments came near the end of the hearing under questioning from Democratic counsel Barry Berke, during which Mr. Lewandowski broadly affirmed the accuracy of the Mueller report. \u201cI have stated to the best of my knowledge that most of the information in the Mueller report is accurate,\u201d he said. He also acknowledged not being truthful in media interviews about his interactions with the president regarding Mr. Sessions. \u201cI have no obligation to be honest with the media,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Lewandowski\u2019s performance immediately met with praise from Mr. Trump. On his flight to Mountain View, Calif., Mr. Trump wrote: \u201cSuch a beautiful Opening Statement by Corey Lewandowski!\u201d\n\nWhen the hearing broke for a brief recess, Mr. Lewandowski issued his own tweet: a plug for the website he launched to help him with a possible Senate campaign in New Hampshire.\n\n\u201cYou are not on the campaign trail yet,\u201d Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D., N.Y.) chided Mr. Lewandowski when the hearing resumed. \u201cThis is the House Judiciary Committee\u2014act like you know the difference.\u201d\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS What do you hope comes from Mr. Lewandowski\u2019s hearing? Join the conversation below.\n\nThe hearing devolved into partisan bickering soon after it began, as ranking member Rep. Doug Collins (R., Ga.) likened the panel\u2019s proceedings to \u201cLet\u2019s read the Mueller report for audiobook,\u201d accused Mr. Nadler of breaking the rules and motioned to adjourn\u2014a move that was swiftly rejected.\n\nLawmakers feuded over the purpose of the hearing and each other\u2019s tactics. When Mr. Buck asked Mr. Lewandowski whether he believed Russian President Vladimir Putin was laughing about \u201cuseful idiots\u201d in the Democratic Party, Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D., Texas) interrupted: \u201cI would not engage in any behavior that could be described as idiot. Never in my life or my colleagues\u2019 have we ever discussed behaving like idiots.\u201d\n\nProdded by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R., Fla.) to speculate about Democrats\u2019 motive for calling the hearing, a stony-faced Mr. Lewandowski replied: \u201cI think they hate this president more than they love their country.\u201d\n\nRep. Ted Lieu (D., Calif.), a former active-duty officer in the U.S. Air Force, sharply rebuked him for that assertion later in the hearing.\n\nIn his report, Mr. Mueller said he didn\u2019t establish a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia, and that he declined to make a decision on whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice, citing a Justice Department policy that a sitting president can\u2019t be indicted. He made clear he wasn\u2019t exonerating Mr. Trump.\n\nAccording to Mr. Mueller\u2019s report, Mr. Trump in June 2017 dictated a message for Mr. Lewandowski to deliver to then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, directing Mr. Sessions to publicly announce that the special counsel investigation was \u201cvery unfair\u201d to the president and that Mr. Trump had done nothing wrong. The president also wanted Mr. Sessions, who had recused himself from the special counsel investigation, to say that he would meet with Mr. Mueller and direct him to limit his probe to \u201cinvestigating election meddling for future elections.\u201d\n\nA month later, Mr. Trump inquired about the status of his message with Mr. Lewandowski, who told him it would be delivered soon. Instead, Mr. Lewandowski asked Rick Dearborn, a former chief of staff to Mr. Sessions who at the time was serving as the White House deputy chief of staff for policy, to deliver the message to Mr. Sessions. Mr. Dearborn didn\u2019t follow through, according to the Mueller report.\n\nMr. Lewandowski told the committee on Tuesday that he didn\u2019t have misgivings about delivering the message, but that he had gone on vacation.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee has also subpoenaed Mr. Dearborn\u2019s testimony, as well as that of former White House staff secretary Rob Porter.\n\nOn Monday, the White House sought to restrict or halt all three men\u2019s testimony by arguing that Congress can\u2019t compel the president\u2019s senior advisers to testify about their conversations. White House counsel Pat Cipollone told the House committee on Monday that a member of his office would accompany Mr. Lewandowski to the hearing.\n\nMr. Nadler opened Tuesday\u2019s hearing by calling the White House\u2019s efforts to curtail or halt testimony from Mr. Trump\u2019s associates a \u201cdangerous new stretch\u201d of the law and \u201can absolute cover-up.\u201d\n\nAt the witness table, Mr. Lewandowski wore a dark suit with a light blue shirt and had his fingers clasped. He was flanked by a communications adviser, Emily Miller, and his lawyer, Peter Chavkin. Also accompanying him was David Bossie, a deputy campaign manager for Mr. Trump in 2016 who has since written two books with Mr. Lewandowski.\n\nWrite to Rebecca Ballhaus at Rebecca.Ballhaus@wsj.com and Siobhan Hughes at siobhan.hughes@wsj.com", "description": "Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski stonewalled House Judiciary Committee lawmakers about his conversations with President Trump for nearly six hours, after the White House sought to impose limits on his testimony.", "authors": ["Rebecca Ballhaus", "Siobhan Hughes", "Rebecca.Ballhaus Wsj.Com", "Siobhan.Hughes Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107967/social", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
