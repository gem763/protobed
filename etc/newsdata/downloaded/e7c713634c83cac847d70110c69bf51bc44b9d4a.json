In part 1 of this unusual road trip, Erin takes us to the scene of the crime - the house where the murders took place is now The Lizzie Borden Bed and Breakfast/Museum. We learn about the Borden family and what happened on that fateful day in August of 1892. It was a brutal crime scene and there are actual death photos hanging in the house.
