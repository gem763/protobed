With your press they want to see something positive in the country.\"\n\nOne reporter suggested to Trump that he would \"definitely\" be deserving of the Nobel Peace Prize if he's able to mediate a solution to the tensions in the disputed Kashmir region.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m gonna get a Nobel Prize for a lot of things, if they gave it out fairly, which they don\u2019t,\" Trump said.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe reportedly nominated Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize earlier this year at the request of the U.S. government.\n\n\"They gave one to [former President] Obama immediately upon his ascent to the presidency, and he had no idea why he got it,\" Trump said. \"And you know what? That was the only thing I agreed with him on.\"\n\nKhan, who was seated next to Trump, laughed as the president shared his thoughts on the Nobel process.\n\nObama received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009 for his \"efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples.\"\n\nThe same reporter who raised the Nobel possibility, credited Trump for being an \"honest\" leader, and reporters spoke openly about how they felt the Kashmir dispute might play out.\n\n\"This is the kind of reporter I like. I like this reporter. Are you a member of his team?\" Trump said, motioning to Khan.\n\nThe conflict between India and Pakistan over the disputed territory has persisted for decades, but tensions flared earlier this year after a February suicide attack that killed more than 40 Indian soldiers in the part of Kashmir that is controlled by India.\n\nSenators have urged Trump to take immediate action to help address the worsening humanitarian crisis in the region.\n\nTrump on Monday said he would be happy to mediate if both Khan and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi made the request. India has previously denied asking Trump to get involved in the discussions.\n\n\"I have a very good relationship with Prime Minister Modi, I have a very good relationship with Prime Minister Khan. And if at any time they say you know we have some points that we think we can maybe iron out, I think I\u2019d be an extremely good arbitrator,\" Trump said.\n\n\"I\u2019ve never failed as an arbitrator,\" he added. \"I\u2019ve been asked to arbitrate disputes, pretty big ones, from friends. And I\u2019ve done it in a good successful fashion.\"", "description": "President Trump on Monday\u00a0said during a spirited exchange with Pakistani\u00a0reporters that he would be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize \"if they gave it out fairly.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald_092019getty_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
