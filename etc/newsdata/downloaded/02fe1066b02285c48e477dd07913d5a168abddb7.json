In countries all around the world, there are not enough good leaders. That is certainly true in the United States. I think Americans of every party would agree that there are not enough good leaders.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nThe same is true at the state and local levels: we need more and better leaders. And in businesses, nonprofits and families \u2014 there are not enough good leaders.\n\nThe good news is that leaders can be developed, and everyone wins when leaders develop other good leaders. If you are a leader \u2014 at any level or of any capacity \u2014 your organization will benefit when you start developing leaders.\n\nOne of the greatest ways for a leader to invest in oneself is to develop other leaders. Smart leaders invest in their people and teach them to do the same.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just your organization that benefits when you develop leaders. You benefit too. One of the greatest ways for a leader to invest in oneself is to develop other leaders. Smart leaders invest in their people and teach them to do the same.\n\nI think about it this way: I have an Intentional Relationship Account with the leaders I want to develop. I make regular deposits into each one, and while the process takes time, I\u2019ve done this long enough that I know this practice is what produces my greatest leadership return.\n\nIn fact, I\u2019ve spent so much time practicing this that it\u2019s the subject of my latest book, \"The Leader\u2019s Greatest Return,\" which will release in January.\n\nTo keep things practical, I\u2019m going to assume that you have a system that helps you identify and attract talented leaders to your organization. It\u2019s a big assumption, but a necessary one for keeping this post brief. (Let me say, however, that if you don\u2019t have a system for identifying and attracting leaders, you need to spend some major thinking time to get that figured out.)\n\nHere are some of the key investments I make to develop my leaders.\n\nConnection\n\nBefore you lead and develop people, you need to connect with them. You need to find common ground with potential leaders, which is less about ability and more a function of attitude.\n\nSoft skills, such as asking questions and listening, having empathy for people\u2019s journeys, and understanding their perspectives, are crucial in today\u2019s environment because people don\u2019t follow you when they understand you. They follow you when they feel understood.\n\nEquipping\n\nWhen you start equipping leaders and helping them become great at their jobs, you begin experiencing the compounding of influence, time, energy, resources, ideas, money and effectiveness.\n\nYour goal is always to equip people in such a way that they learn not only to do their jobs well and to lead, but also to develop their own equipping leader\u2019s mindset.\n\nEmpowering\n\nIt\u2019s very difficult for leaders to rise if their leader refuses to put the wind of empowerment under their wings.\n\nYou empower people when you earn their respect, build healthy relationships, and provide an environment where others are free to try, fail, learn, improve, and try again.\n\nPositioning\n\nGetting people into a role where they can succeed is vital for a leader who wants to develop leaders. This means making sure that you know what each role requires, that you know which leader\u2019s strengths fit which role, and know when adjustments are needed.\n\nToo many leaders have a \u201cset it and forget it\u201d mindset when it comes to positioning leaders on their teams; wise leaders understand the benefit of making shifts when necessary.\n\nMentoring\n\nMentoring isn\u2019t teaching a lesson or a skill. It\u2019s discipling another person. It involves discerning where they are, knowing where they are supposed to go, and giving them the tools required for getting there.\n\nPay close attention to individual styles, strengths, weaknesses, motivations, histories, aspirations and more. To be an effective mentor to other leaders, you need to understand where people need to grow in order to reach the next level of their development.\n\nThe good news about this list is that you can start making these same investments into your leaders right now. And like any good investment, the sooner you start, the longer you can invest, and the greater the compound interest you\u2019ll receive.\n\nThere is nothing in this world that gives a greater ROI to a leader than attracting, developing, and multiplying leaders. It\u2019s the best investment you can make as a leader.\n\nEditor's note: The five ideas mentioned here are covered in greater depth in Maxwell's upcoming book \"The Leader\u2019s Greatest Return.\"\n\nJohn C.
