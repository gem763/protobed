Because this is who will help to raise your children, these are the people who will work to continue Sandeep's work. These are the ones who will work to bring down hate. This is your family.\"\n\nMark Mulligan/Houston Chronicle via AP\n\n\"Someone asked me how I would best described Sandeep,\" Garcia said. \"And I would say look at this magnificent crowd of diversity. Especially in the midst of division that we sometimes find ourselves in, look at this unity. There are few who could do this, in life much less in death.\"\n\n\"We are all better because of Sandeep Dhaliwal,\" he said.\n\nMark Mulligan/Houston Chronicle via AP\n\nAt the vigil, the sheriff recalled one example of the deputy's commitment to community; when a woman was having trouble lowering her garage door and Dhaliwal saw her struggling, he offered to stay and keep an eye on her home so she could head to work.\n\nDhaliwal also loved children and would pin them as honorary deputies with their own badges, the sheriff said.\n\nOne of my favorite images of my friend Sandeep Dhaliwal is of him engaging w this child. At tonight\u2019s vigil honoring Sandeep, I had the amazing privilege to connect with the same child, Connor. We both miss our friend & come together to remember him. #LongLiveDhaliwal #HouNews pic.twitter.com/eNbHd2lTHU \u2014 Ed Gonzalez (@SheriffEd_HCSO) October 1, 2019\n\nAfter the vigil, Gonzalez said he went to a convenience store in the area where Dhaliwal worked.\n\n\"The clerk greeted me & asked how I was doing. I replied I was sad for the loss of my friend,\" he tweeted. \"Not surprising, he too knew Sandeep & mourned also. Said Sandeep would stop by & watch over them.\"\n\nLeaving tonight\u2019s vigil I stopped at a c-store in the community Deputy Dhaliwal served. The clerk greeted me & asked how I was doing.
