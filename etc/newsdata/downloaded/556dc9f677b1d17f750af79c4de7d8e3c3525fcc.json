The group\u2019s predictions for this year include trends like CBD and faux meats.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at what Whole Foods is predicting for 2020:\n\nRegenerative agriculture: This term basically refers to farming practices that restore degraded soil, improve biodiversity and increase carbon capture in order to benefit the environment, according to Whole Foods. The store said it expects that brands that embrace these practices will see a boost next year.\n\nWide world of flour: Consumers are seeking out more kinds of flour as they try their hands at new dishes from around the world, such as teff flour used in Ethiopian injera, Whole Foods said. The chain expects more flours made from vegetables and fruit \u2014 including bananas \u2014 will make their way into pantries. Snacks have also been getting into the trend, such as chips made with tigernut flour.\n\nI can\u2019t believe it\u2019s butter: If it hasn\u2019t been made into butter yet, it will be in 2020, according to Whole Foods. Watermelon seed butter? Sure. Macadamia nut butter? Why not? Many of these alternatives will avoid allergens and also appeal to those on vegan, paleo or keto diets.\n\nWest African foods: Traditional West African flavors have been \u201cpopping up everywhere in food and beverage,\u201d according to Whole Foods. Many West African dishes use a base of tomatoes, onions and chili peppers. Peanuts, ginger and lemongrass are also common.\n\nKeep it fresh: Fresh, refrigerated snacks are growing in popularity, according to Whole Foods. The store is seeing more people buying single-serving snacks like hard-boiled eggs with savory toppings, pickled vegetables, drinkable soups, dippers and snack bars with fresh fruit.\n\nLess meat, not faux meat: Butchers and meat brands will get in on the plant-based trend by cooking up meat-plant blends, according to While Foods. Some chefs have already been experimenting with this, making burgers with a beef-mushroom blend or other ingredients.\n\nSoy long, and thanks for all the dishes: More vegan dishes will rely on non-animal alternatives besides those made from soy, Whole Foods predicted. Instead, food makers will use new blends with items like grains and mung beans.\n\nFoodie kiddies: Children are getting less picky and more adventurous with their food, according to Whole Foods. As parents introduce their children to new foods, the kids are dining on sushi, fermented foods and pasta made from alternative flours.\n\nMocktails: Non-alcoholic drinks and cocktails have been gaining in popularity, and Whole Foods said that trend will continue in 2020. New zero-proof apertifs and hops-infused sparkling waters will even be able to be enjoyed straight out of the bottle or can, no mixing necessary.\n\nSweet tooth: Sugar alternatives are moving beyond the typical sweeteners to new syrupy reductions from sources like monk fruit, pomegranates, coconut and dates, according to Whole Foods. So are syrups from starches like sorghum and sweet potato, for flavors like molasses or honey in baking or beverages.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "Whole Foods the next boogie snacks you\u2019re going to want to eat before you do.", "authors": ["James Leggate"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/2020_Trends_-_Group_Trend_Image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
