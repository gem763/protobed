Since 2017, the global fund has invested in more than 25 growth-stage companies that are making a measurable positive social and/or environmental impact. TPG also recently closed on US$1.2 billion for a second Rise Fund that\u2019s expected to eventually total about US$3 billion. That includes $500 million in assets from The Evercare Health Fund, which TPG purchased last June.\n\nRise's investments fall across seven sectors, including agriculture, education, and healthcare. For energy, a major part of the strategy is to find companies across the globe working to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gas emissions on the climate, says Rick Needham, energy sector lead for the fund.\n\nThat means focusing on companies addressing \u201cthree main pillars of decarbonization\u201d: low carbon energy, energy efficiency, and electrification, Needham says.\n\nIn addition, Rise seeks to invest in companies that can provide energy to the billion consumers in developing markets who don\u2019t have access to electricity and the three billion who cook over open flames.\n\nNeedham spoke with Penta recently about the fund\u2019s strategy for investing in alternative energy.\n\nInvesting in Decarbonization\n\nIn June 2018, Rise invested US$70 million in Fourth Partner Energy, a distributed energy company in Hyderabad, India, that offers commercial, industrial, and public-sector rooftop solar systems.\n\n\u201cOne big theme in the energy space is decentralization,\u201d Needham says. \u201cFrom a market perspective, those distributed assets will sometimes sell at prices higher than utility-scale projects.\u201d\n\nBuilding out distributed solar systems at scale can be tough, but Rise was attracted to Fourth Partner because of its success with blue-chip customers like Pepsi, Nestle and Schneider Electric, he says.\n\nFourth Partner also \u201chad great customer focus, and was delivering the kinds of savings and energy that the customers were promised, such as almost every customer they had was a repeat customer that kept coming back,\u201d Needham says.\n\nThe investment in Fourth Partner meets Rise's goal of financing low-carbon projects, while its June 2018 purchase of CLEAResult in Austin, Texas\u2014a co-investment with TPG\u2014meets its goal to invest in energy efficiency. (Financial terms of the acquisition from General Atlantic, a global growth equity firm, were not disclosed).\n\nCLEAResult serves residential, institutional, commercial, and industrial utility customers across the U.S. with energy-efficiency services and programs. The firm also provides demand response technology, which allows customers to turn off energy-intensive appliances during times of peak energy demand.\n\n\u201cThey will be shifting even more so into things like beneficial electrification, electric vehicle charging, storage\u2014all these things that don\u2019t just provide energy efficiency, but provide utilities the ability not only to lower demand, but also to manage it by time and location,\u201d Needham says.\n\nThis is \u201ca general theme that\u2019s happening in the energy world too\u2014as more renewables get deployed, flexibility becomes key, and the ability to manage [energy use] by time and location is becoming more important.\u201d\n\nWhy Rise Hasn\u2019t Invested in Electrification...Yet\n\nIn electrification, the third pillar of Rise's decarbonization strategy, the firm is looking at transportation\u2014electric vehicles, in other words\u2014as well as industrial processes.\n\n\u201cIf you were to shift those over to electrification, then in the process of decarbonizing your grid, you are also decarbonizing those processes which originally were liquid-fuel based,\u201d Needham says.\n\nWhile the fund has looked hard at a \u201cmobility\u201d company in the electrification space, Rise didn\u2019t invest as interest from other investors pushed the valuation too high. The situation is a classic problem in impact investing, Needham says. \u201cIn these cases, we find an interesting company, but there are other investors, [who are] maybe not as hard nosed about the kind of returns we want to find for our investors.\u201d\n\nThis is particularly true in electric vehicles, where a large amount of investment is being funneled into companies Rise considers unproven. A few companies have valuations in the hundreds of millions, or even US$1 billion, and \u201cdon\u2019t have a vehicle on the road,\u201d Needham says.\n\nThe fund is also wary of electric vehicle companies because of expected future competition in the sector. \u201cBattery prices have been declining 80% or so since 2010, so the economics of these vehicles are getting better and better,\u201d he says. \u201cWithin a few years they will be nearly cost-competitive with an [internal combustion] engine vehicle.\u201d\n\nThe potential competition is widespread and global. \u201cEven though it\u2019s not yet at a scale, it\u2019s at a projected scale and a projected inflection point that\u2019s coming,\u201d Needham says.\n\nEnergy Access\n\nTPG also has yet to find the right investment in energy access. The problem is finding a company that has the scale to handle the size investment the fund would make (typically at least US$50 million to US$150 million), Needham says.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s been difficult to find companies with a proven ability to run a good, profitable business that can scale, he says.\n\nOne reason Rise avoids making small investments is that the fund becomes actively involved with the companies it invests in, helping them to grow, Needham says. \u201cIf we had a portfolio that was too large, we wouldn\u2019t be able to live up to that promise of delivering that.\u201d", "description": "The world\u2019s largest impact investing fund is focusing on decarbonization and energy access", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-112650/social", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
