She started working in a children\u2019s home in Hackney when she was just 18 and she has worked as a childminder and youth worker, as well as running her own youth club in Islington with her sister for ten years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJessie finally had the opportunity to become a foster carer for the first time when she was 45.\n\nThough she had thought she was too old to foster, Jessie found Five Rivers Child Care, an independent fostering agency and social enterprise, and she began providing emergency and respite care to vulnerable young people.\n\nIn Greater London, there are currently 4,090 children in foster care and 900 foster carers are needed across the region to meet demand and help support vulnerable children and young adults.\n\n\u2018There are a lot of barriers that hold people back from fostering, but whatever background you\u2019re from, everybody has love in their hearts to give to a young person in need,\u2019 says Jessie.\n\n\u2018I thought I would be considered too old to foster, but I couldn\u2019t have lived with myself if I didn\u2019t apply and I\u2019m so glad I did.\n\n\u2018It is such a privilege to share someone\u2019s life and to watch them grow up. It has been a journey for me and to be supporting so many children is such a wonderful feeling.\n\n\u2018I tell every child that I\u2019ve ever looked after that I will always be there for them.\u2019\n\nPeople from all walks of life can become foster carers as long as they are over 21.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis includes single people, co-habiting couples, same-sex couples and people living in rented accommodation. The only requirement is a spare room for each foster child.\n\n* Names have been changed to protect the identities of the children in care.\n\nMORE: Mixed Up: \u2018Don\u2019t tell me to pick a side \u2013 I am mixed-race, so I am both\u2019\n\nMORE: People are using #ShareBlackStories to celebrate Black History Month on Instagram\n\nMORE: Man with cerebral palsy becomes elite bodybuilder to prove \u2018anything is possible\u2019\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Jessie Hall is an incredible foster mum and she thinks it's vital for foster children to learn about their heritage and culture.", "authors": ["Natalie Morris"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jessie-Hall-has-cared-for-23-children-over-the-last-fifteen-years-43af_1570701237.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
