Wokeness will trigger outrage over . . . anything.\n\nExpressing support for self-determination, even.\n\nEspecially if there's money's on the table.\n\nHouston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey is doing the Genuflection Tour for having had the effrontery to express support for exactly that - for the people of Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cFight for Freedom,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cStand With Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nThis offended the authoritarian heavies running the Chinese government on the mainland - who are very much opposed to the desire of Hong People\u2019s people for the freedom to not be absorbed into the mainland and live under the thumb of the authoritarian heavies who run the mainland.\n\nHong Kong has been independent of mainland China - and the communists who control it - since the end of World War II. The former British colony is supposed to remain independent of the mainland until at least 2047 under the terms of a deal with the Chinese communists, who agreed to a policy of \u201cone country, two systems.\u201d\n\nBut 2047 isn't soon enough, apparently, for the heavies - who are in something of a hurry. They want to absorb Hong Kong right away.\n\nLiterally.\n\nThe mainland heavies don't just want the island. They want its people. And they're taking them . . . with the help of Hong Kong's increasingly henpecked government, which is caving in to the enormous pressure being applied by the presence - literally next door - of those Chinese heavies.\n\nUnder something called the Fugitive Offenders law, people are being \"extradited\" - black-bagged - off the streets of Hong Kong and taking them back to the mainland . . . there to learn the proper attitude toward the heavies.\n\nMorey\u2019s tweet objected to this.\n\nAnd then the Chinese heavies objected to him. But instead of standing with Morey, the NBA got heavy. Because China is big business for the NBA. Lots of money is on the table - and the Chinese heavies threatened to take it off.\n\nChina's state-run TV network said it would not show Rockets games as punishment for Morey's tweet and Tencent - a Chinese-run \"media partner\" of the NBA - suspended a streaming deal worth $1.5 billion over the next five years.\n\nChinese athletic apparel giant Li-Ning said it was \"upset\" with Morey.\n\nAnd so the NBA quickly labeled his tweet \u201cregrettable\u201d and \"deeply offensive.\"\n\nIt did not explain why.\n\nIt did channel the ghost of Neville Chamberlain - through NBA Chief Communications Officer Mike Bass - who released an embarrassingly servile statement which said that the league has \" . . .great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that sports and the NBA can be used as a unifying force to bridge cultural divides and bring people together.\u201d\n\nNot quite peace in our time . . . but close.\n\nThe NBA is even ejecting fans who dare to offend the Chinese - in America. The Philly Inquirer reports that Sixers fan Sam Wachs was ejected from the Wells Fargo Center earlier this week during an exhibition game between the Sixers and the Guangzhou Loong-Lions . . . for holding a sign expressing support for pro-democracy protestors in Hong Kong.\n\nRockets owner Tilman Fertitta also threw Morey under the bus, publicly disassociating himself and the team from Morey.\n\nOver money.\n\nWhich apparently trumps everything. Including Morey's self-respect.\n\nMorey - wanting to remain employed by the Rockets - performed the required genuflection.\n\n\u201cI did not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China,\u201d Morey hair-shirted. \"I was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event. I have had a lot of opportunity since that tweet to hear and consider other perspectives.\"\n\nAnd then:\n\n\u201cI have always appreciated the significant support our Chinese fans and sponsors have provided and I would hope that those who are upset will know that offending or misunderstanding them was not my intention. My tweets are my own and in no way represent the Rockets or the NBA.\u201d\n\nHe might have followed the manly example of South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, who responded in an entirely different way to being pressured by the heavies running mainland China. Who pulled every South Park episode off the air and vacuumed every online discussion, clip and link to or about South Park from the Internet in China ... as retaliation for South Park's mocking of the heavies who run the mainland.\n\nParker and Stone didn't suit up for the Genuflection Tour. They did what Morey and the NBA should have done.\n\nThey gave the Chinese heavies the finger - but much more cleverly.\n\n\"Like the NBA, we welcome the Chinese censors into our homes and into our hearts,\" the pair wrote in a hilarious and important statement released shortly after Morey's obsequious one. \"We too love money more than freedom and democracy. Xi (Jinping, the head Chinese heavy) doesn't look like Winnie the Pooh at all. Tune into our 300th episode this Wednesday at 10! Long live the great Communist Party of China. May the autumn sorghum harvest be bountiful. We good now, China?\"\n\nThis may cost South Park some money - but it earned its creators something of infinitely more value.\n\nTheir self-respect.\n\nA.J.
