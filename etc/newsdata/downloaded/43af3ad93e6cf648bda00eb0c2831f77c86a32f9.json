Part of that response has been the creation of new cities. From Forest City in Malaysia to the Norman Foster designed Masdar City in the United Arab Emirates, the race is on to learn the right lessons from the past and build attractive, dynamic, sustainable places of the future.\n\nSongdo, South Korea\n\nUnder construction since 2005, Songdo sits about 30 kilometers south west of Seoul, on land reclaimed from the Yellow Sea. Pitched as a city of the future, Songdo was to be an orderly, quiet alternative to bustling Seoul, appealing both to families seeking a calmer life and businesses seeking the latest in high rise office space \u2014 all connected to the world by South Korea\u2019s largest airport, across a nearby bridge.\n\nProgress has been stop-start, however, and the completion date has been pushed back repeatedly. Initial estimates for the city\u2019s completion promised 2015. The current date is 2022. Businesses have not arrived as quickly as hoped, and population growth has been slower than anticipated, currently 100,000 residents instead of a hoped-for 300,000.\n\nForty percent of Songdo\u2019s land is green space, its promoters claim. Much of the infrastructure is centralized, including a state-of-the-art waste disposal system that mostly eliminates garbage trucks, sucking trash to a central processor via a system of tubes. A dense web of bike lanes has been designed to cut reliance on the car. Reports about the feel of the place have been mixed, however, with some describing the rare pleasure of hearing birdsong in a city, while others have called the quiet eerie.\n\nPart of the video for pop megahit \u00a8Gangnam Style\u00a8 was filmed here, apparently because it was easier to find an empty, quiet spot to shoot than in actual Gangnam, back in Seoul.\n\nMasdar City, United Arab Emirates\n\nInitiated in 2006, Masdar City\u2019s planners envisioned it as the world\u2019s first zero-carbon city. Unfortunately, the scorching local heat, which places unusually high demands on electricity production, have planners dialing that promise back and aiming for \u201clow carbon.\u201d\n\nSome of the city\u2019s other initiatives have worked better. Designed by Norman Foster, the architect behind Wembley Stadium in London and Apple Park in California, the city\u2019s streets are laid out to increase shade and feature towers that draw down a cooling wind. Use of private vehicles is tightly restricted. The city houses a number of research institutes focused on developing green technology.\n\nThough progress has been much slower than expected, planners expect 50,000 residents by 2030, plus a daytime population inflated by 40,000 commuters from places like nearby Abu Dhabi. The city has drawn some praise for contributing to planners\u2019 understanding of how to develop sustainable communities. But with its high walls, it has also drawn criticism, with critics saying it looks like an entire city built as a gated community.\n\nEko Atlantic, Nigeria\n\nThis new urban center on Nigeria\u2019s southeast coast, just outside Lagos, is planned as a regional financial hub, providing housing for 250,000 people and work for 150,000 daily commuters. Built on ten square kilometers of land dredged from the sea means it also has an eight-kilometer seawall made of five-ton concrete blocks, to protect (hopefully) against flooding.\n\nThe city's developers, the Chagoury Group, claim the project will help alleviate a chronic shortage of real estate in one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing megacities. Critics say the high end project risks leaving Lagos\u2019 urban poor behind. Other concerns say the city\u2019s footprint could make flooding worse elsewhere along Nigeria\u2019s coast.\n\nForest City, Malaysia\n\nLocated at a strategic point at the tip of the Malaysian peninsula, the $100 billion \u201cemerging futuristic urban development\u201d sits close to regional hub Singapore. Much closer than capital Kuala Lumpur.\n\nOriginally envisaged as a \u201cvibrant city...synchronized with the world\u201d, the development has become a political flash point between Kuala Lumpur and Beijing, after 94-year old Malaysian leader Mahathir Mohamad moved to curtail foreign buyers from investing in the development. Led by the Chinese developer Country Garden Pacificview and a Malaysian government-backed entity, many early buyers are Chinese nationals, and much of the funding for the building has been Chinese, drawing Mahathir\u2019s ire.\n\nBuilt on four artificial islands, Forest City aims to house 700,000 residents in what backers call a technologically-advanced, environmentally-friendly setting.\n\nIndonesia\u2019s new, yet-to-be-named capital\n\nIndonesia\u2019s president last month announced plans to build a new capital on an out-of-the-way patch of the island of Borneo seeking to alleviate some of the strain on the overcrowded current capital of Jakarta, which is rapidly sinking into the sea as residents draw water from the aquifers which support it.\n\nPlans for its design of the new city, which was mooted for decades, are sketchy so far. Though it has yet to be given a name, the government expects it to have 200,000-300,000 residents within five years, and Indonesia\u2019s planning minister told Reuters lessons would be learned from Seoul, Singapore and Washington.\n\nConcerns are already being expressed about what the new administrative center will mean for the natural environment on Borneo, home to many rare species, including the orangutan, and already subject to rapid deforestation. Indonesia wouldn\u2019t be the first country to build a new capital from scratch. Similar projects have been executed in countries across the world from Brazil to Myanmar to Australia and the United States. The new city is expected to cost Indonesia around $33 billion.", "description": "(For better or worse)", "authors": ["Charlie Duxbury", "Omar Marques"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/futurecities_cmyk-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
