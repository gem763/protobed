Since then, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America have all been linked to the mega-listing.\n\nJPMorgan Chase declined to comment and the other banks did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n\u201cIf you go ahead as lead coordinators in raising tens of billions of dollars for the world\u2019s biggest climate polluter \u2026 it will be clear that your words of environmental and social concern are devoid of all sincerity, and that when push comes to shove your concerns for short-term profit outweigh all else,\u201d the groups said.\n\nThe letter was also signed by the Rainforest Alliance Network, Sierra Club, Indigenous Environmental Network, 350.org, BankTrack and Share Action.\n\nThe letter comes after a Guardian investigation into the world\u2019s 20 most polluting companies revealed Saudi Aramco as the biggest single contributor to the global climate crisis. The company has produced around 4.4% of the world\u2019s total carbon dioxide and methane emissions since 1965.\n\nAramco is also expected to lead the growth in fossil fuel production between 2018 and 2030, the period in which experts have warned that climate action is crucial to prevent runaway global heating. Oil Change International estimates that the company will produce enough oil and gas to emit the equivalent of 27bn tonnes of carbon dioxide, or 4.7% of the world\u2019s carbon budget, if governments hope to keep global temperatures from rising 1.5 degrees C above pre-industrialised levels.\n\nThe state oil giant is highly sought after by investors for its enormous oil reserves and world-leading profits. It reported profits of $46.9bn for the first six months of this year, down from $53.2bn in the first half of last year but still well ahead of the world\u2019s six biggest listed oil companies combined.\n\nAramco produced 13.2m barrels of oil a day in the first half of the year, more than four times the rate of production of rivals such as ExxonMobil.", "description": "Eight green groups send letter to express concern over planned market float", "authors": ["Jillian Ambrose"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd87fa96f00cb08ac9e9862896988c24b4c55cd6/150_0_3044_1827/master/3044.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=81e77a28c573ab8902d84b98f28368d8", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
