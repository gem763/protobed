The pair were flown back by helicopter to the mine site, where they were given a meal and the chance to shower before joining a contractor charter flight from the mine to Timmins Ontario.\n\n\"We are extremely proud of our Victor Mine team for their quick and professional action to what could have been a very serious situation,\" said Al Collins, Superintendent Asset Services at Victor Mine who coordinated the support from the mine. \"Weather in the remote northern region can be quite harsh this time of the year, but fortunately everything went well and we have a happy ending.\"\n\nThe Victor Mine, Ontario's first and only Diamond mine, which ended operations in May of this year is a multiple award winner for safety, including two national John T. Ryan Awards as the safest mine in Canada in 2015 and 2016.\n\n- ends -\n\nContact\n\nTom Ormsby Tel 403 930 0991 x2703 Mob 403 464 5516 tom.ormsby@debeersgroup.com\n\nAbout De Beers Group\n\nDe Beers Group is a member of the Anglo American plc group.
