Hybrid models use a 2.5-litre Atkinson-cycle engine, combined with an electric motor and a CVT transmission, and feature all-wheel-drive.\n\nAll models also get Android Auto and Apple Carplay capability, something previously unheard of in a Toyota showroom.\n\nToyota is also readying a third variant to be added to the lineup, a plug-in hybrid, set for a debut in Los Angeles at that auto show. According to Toyota, the model \u201cwill become the most powerful RAV4 yet.\u201d We\u2019re hoping this means the focus for the new vehicle will be driving pleasure, rather than economy.", "description": "Thinking green instead?
