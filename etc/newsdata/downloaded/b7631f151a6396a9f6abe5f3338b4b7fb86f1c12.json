And maybe that's why Raku Inoue was the perfect artist for this month's assignment.\n\nBased in Montreal, Inoue makes art from petals and twigs and whatever he can forage from his backyard (and/or florist). But it all began as a new hobby \u2014 just a creative outlet from his ad agency desk job.\n\nThat's the story he shared with us a couple years back (watch it here), and his reputation has only blossomed since then. Below, he gives us an update. There's some info on his logo design, too. Read on.\n\nName: Raku Inoue\n\nAge: 39\n\nHomebase: Montreal\n\nHow do you like to describe your art practice?\n\nMy art is like a therapeutic exercise to me. I do it because it gives me challenges to overcome, and when I'm done, it fills me with a sense of accomplishment. It is a feeling that's quite intoxicating.\n\nLet's talk about your design! What inspired your take on the CBC Arts logo?\n\nMost of my creations are inspired by nature and its beauty. The main source of inspiration may vary from textures, colours, the subjects or perhaps all three. I just love to experiment and see what I can achieve with what nature offers in the form of raw materials.\n\nWhat plants and flowers did you use to make the image?\n\nI used Craspedia and Leucanthemum, which was kindly supplied by Florsani, a flower farm/distributor in Ecuador. Everything else \u2014 such as Crocus and other little wild flowers \u2014 are from my backyard. Same goes for the kiwi tree vines which were used to create the \"art\" type.\n\nWhat's the project you're most proud of?\n\n[It's] hard for me to give a definitive answer since my tastes and preferences shift from time to time. It's like when I'm asked, \"what is my favourite colour\"? That depends on my mood on that day and how I'm feeling. However, I can say with certainty that the first [piece from the] Natura Insects [series], which was a rose petal beetle, is very close to my heart. After all, this Natura Insects series gave me the opportunity to be featured in National Geographic this past August, and I'm very proud of that.\n\n(CBC Arts)\n\nWho is the last artist you discovered online?\n\nI have to admit that I don't spend too much time navigating online for artistic discovery, but recently, I got in touch with a chef by the name of Douglas McMaster from Silo London. I love his zero-waste approach to cooking. He has published a book called The Zero Waste Blueprint: A Food System for the Future. His viewpoints inspire me tremendously.\n\nWhat work of art do you wish you owned?\n\nHow about a full-course meal prepared by Douglas?! I have the perfect spot to put his work: in my belly.\n\nWhat's your favourite place to see art?\n\nI do love going to museums and exhibitions, of course, but I see art in all places. Being artistic is being open-minded and letting yourself be inspired by the things that surround you at that time. So for me, art is everywhere.\n\nWhere can we see more from you?\n\nDefinitely not on Facebook. But I am quite active on Instagram and I also post on Behance Network. I also have my official website, but that is still under construction.\n\nEvery month, we feature a new take on the CBC Arts logo created by a Canadian artist.
