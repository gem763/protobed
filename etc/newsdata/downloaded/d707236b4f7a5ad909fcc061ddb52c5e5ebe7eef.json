Yet there is one persistent expectation that tends to follow me, and others like me, wherever I go: that I play the role of genteel sidekick.\n\nThis summer, for instance, European Council President Donald Tusk shared a video on Instagram from the G7 meeting in Biarritz, France. The video was of Melania Trump, Brigitte Macron, Malgosia Tusk and Akie Abe \u2014 spouses of President Trump, President Emmanuel Macron of France, Mr. Tusk and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan \u2014 gazing out to sea, dresses fluttering in the wind. The caption: \u201cThe light side of the Force.\u201d\n\nAs the spouse of a head of state, the Instagram made me cringe. It is regrettable to see independent, intelligent women reduced to props who exist to support their husbands\u2019 political agendas \u2014 to see them celebrated first and foremost for their sartorial decisions or, as Mr. Tusk\u2019s post implied, their demure and gentle demeanors. In 2019, can we not do better than presume the spouses of our leaders have nothing more worthwhile to do with their time than traipse after their other halves to sample wines, watch traditional dances and take in the view while their (almost exclusively) male counterparts take care of Serious Business?", "description": "", "authors": ["Eliza Reid", "Nytimes.Com Opinion First-Ladies.Html"], "top_image": ""}
