Jones slid up into Keselowski, whose No. 2 Ford hit the outside wall and caromed back across the track into a tire barrier located against the inside wall.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nKeselowski\u2019s car hardly scrubbed off any speed after the first impact and had a violent collision with the tires. He crawled from the car, which was propped up by the protruding wall and barrier.\n\n\u201cI probably came down on Erik just a little bit more than I thought I did, and he got loose, no air on the car,\u201d Keselowski told NBC\u2019s Kelli Stavast. \u201cI hit the wall there, and there\u2019s this spot on the wall with just an atrocious angle.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what that spot is for, but it does not need to be there. We found it. That\u2019s how racing goes. You find the things and we found this. This track really was part of the safety revolution about 15, 20 years ago. I think it\u2019s time for another.\u201d\n\nThe SAFER barrier was developed by Indianapolis Motor Speedway and made its debut at the 2.5-mile oval in 2002. The energy-absorbing walls (which are constructed of steel and Stryofoam) since have been mandated by NASCAR at all of its tracks.\n\nJones, who also was eliminated in the wreck, took the blame after being checked and released from the care center.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cI got loose and made a mistake,\u201d Jones, who locked into the playoffs by winning last Monday\u2019s Southern 500, told NBC. \u201cI didn\u2019t think Brad was going to be too tight on me, and I just lost it. It\u2019s my fault. I feel bad for (Keselowski), and I feel bad about our team as well. It\u2019s a shame \u2026 Wasn\u2019t anticipating enough and drove in too hard for it.\u201d\n\nThe wreck resulted in a red flag to replace the tire barrier.\n\nAfter the race, IMS President Doug Boles told Fox Sports\u2019 Bob Pockrass he\u2019s already had a conversation with Keselowski about improvements that could be made to that area he hit.\n\nGood conversation. Appreciate him listening and asking. https://t.co/CHVor0CLBe \u2014 Brad Keselowski (@keselowski) September 8, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc thankful.
