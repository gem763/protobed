Nearly all the other 14 officers were named during their federal trial.\n\nMosby says her office has no choice but to right the wrongs when sworn police officers are involved in planting drugs and guns, making illegal arrests and bringing false charges.\n\nWith expanded authorities under a new state law, Mosby\u2019s staff will file 200 cases a week, with judges holding daily hearings to consider erasing bad convictions.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nInformation from: The Baltimore Sun, http://www.baltimoresun.com", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
