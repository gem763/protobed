He's been poked and prodded a lot, but he's a little fighter.\"\n\nCourtesy Kayla Land\n\nIn Colton's case, doctors said a bone marrow transplant would be the only way to save his life. Without it, even the smallest germs could put him at risk for an infection that his body could not handle, according to Shereck.\n\nThe family quickly tested his two siblings, Khloe and 8-year-old Krissy, through the Be the Match registry, a process that involves just a simple swab of a cheek to collect DNA.\n\nJust two weeks ago, the Lands found out that Khloe had the right immune system genes to save her brother.\n\n\"My husband and I were hoping it was our older daughter because she understood and she wanted to be the one to help her little brother,\" said Land. \"When we found it was Khloe, she was really excited at first and then fear kicked in within about 30 seconds and she broke down and told us how scared she was.\"\n\nLand bought a special superhero dress for Khloe to wear on transplant day and to help make her feel special in the days ahead.\n\n\"Khloe tells Colton all the time that she's going to save his life, so she knows that he wouldn't have a good chance of living if it wasn't for her,\" Land said. \"But we've tried to make things as minimal as possible.\"\n\nKhloe is expected to leave the hospital on the same day as the procedure, which requires removing marrow from her back. Her cells will then be transplanted into Colton through a PICC line. The infant will stay in the hospital for at least one month as his body adapts to his sister's cells.\n\nThe Lands, who live about four hours from the hospital, will have to live nearby for another three months as doctors continue to monitor Colton's progress.\n\nCourtesy Kayla Land\n\nLand quit her job to be able to stay with Colton in Portland while her husband and daughters commute back and forth for visits.\n\nThe family is also home-schooling Khloe and Krissy this year as they also need to be careful about catching an infection that could be passed on to their brother.\n\nOnce Colton recovers from the transplant, he's expected to lead a healthy life, according to Shereck, who advocates for everyone, especially people in minority groups, to register with Be the Match to see if they, like, Khloe, can help save a life.\n\nLand is looking forward to the day she can watch Colton and his sisters go outside and play together.\n\n\"Doctors have told us that around one year after transplant he can live a normal life as a kid and be out playing in the dirt and being with other kids,\" she said.", "description": "Khloe Land was deemed a", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/colton-2-ht-ps-190913_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
