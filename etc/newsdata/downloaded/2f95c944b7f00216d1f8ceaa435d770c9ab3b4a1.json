Stelter continued,\u201cAnd there are good reasons why they believed him. It\u2019s hard to imagine why anyone would think of orchestrating something like this.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAna Cabrera, CNN anchor, was equally flummoxed Saturday night: \u201cThe big question, then, is why?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhy he would make something like this up?\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s senior entertainment reporter Lisa France was comparably engulfed by confusion. \u201cIf he actually did this, why in the world would he do this?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhy? That\u2019s what everyone wants to know.\u201d\n\nA bit later, Stelter chimed in again: \u201cThis is about why he might \u2014 and, so far, we don\u2019t know. But why he might have made this up. It just boggles the mind.\u201d\n\nIt boggles the mind! One struggles in vain to think of another profession in which someone could evince or affect as much incompetence as Stelter and Co. and expect to remain employed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDr. Brian Stelter, in a Mexico City ER in 1940: \u201cMr. Trotsky, I\u2019ve run all of the tests and I just don\u2019t understand why you say your head hurts.\u201d Leon Trotsky: \u201cI have an ice axe sticking out of my skull.\u201d Stelter in 1974 Washington: \u201cI don\u2019t see how there could be a Watergate cover-up since all of the president\u2019s men have assured me they\u2019ve done nothing wrong.\u201d Stelter is the guy who can\u2019t figure out why robbers keep turning up at banks.\n\nStelter was a toddler when a black teen named Tawana Brawley made up a story about six white men raping her, smearing her with feces, scrawling \u201cKKK\u201d and \u201cn****r\u201d on her torso with charcoal, and leaving her in a trash bag. He has lived nearly his entire life in the era of hate-crime hoaxes. He surely remembers the Duke-lacrosse gang-rape hoax of 2006, the University of Virginia gang-rape hoax of 2014, the incident just after Trump\u2019s election when a woman on the New York City subway claimed drunken white men had ripped off her hijab. There are lots of other examples. Hey, do you remember as far back as January, when an Indian man tried to portray himself as the victim of a hateful mob of Trump-backing teenage goons? George Will once wrote of campuses, \u201cWhen they make victimhood a coveted status that confers privileges, victims proliferate.\u201d When the media can be relied upon to credit hysterics and axe-grinders the way campus administrators do, America effectively becomes a vast campus.\n\nThe reasons for Smollett\u2019s hoax didn\u2019t boggle anyone\u2019s mind, assuming that the mind in question was functioning above the level of someone who eats a bowl of lead-paint chips for breakfast. In America, victimhood is currency. It is easily converted into actual currency, and if Smollett had gotten away with his hoax, he had every reason to expect that his vastly increased celebrity would have led to the salary bump Chicago police said he wanted from his show Empire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf Stelter was awake in this country in the days following January 29, he noticed what Smollett gained after the phony attack: Nationwide attention. Outpourings of sympathy. Messages of support from the president and leading presidential candidates. Heartfelt encouragement from activist groups and high-ranking celebrities and also Ellen Page. Wall-to-wall coverage on TMZ. A coveted long segment on Good Morning America. For two and a half weeks, the previously obscure performer was the most talked-about actor in America, and this during Oscar season. (Sorry, Christian Bale and Rami Malek.)\n\nAs John McWhorter wrote in The Atlantic, Smollett was in search of \u201cvictimhood chic,\u201d having \u201ccome of age in an era when nothing he could have done or said would have made him look more interesting than being attacked on the basis of his color and sexual orientation.\u201d Smollett could \u201cplay a prophet out of a sense that playing a singer on television is not as glamorous as getting beaten up by white guys.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSmollett purchased with his story things of immeasurable value: Attention, sympathy, love. The world\u2019s eyes were upon him when, the weekend after the attack, he gave a tearful, impassioned performance on stage in L.A. \u201cI had to be here tonight, y\u2019all. I couldn\u2019t let those motherf***ers win. I will always stand for love. I will only stand for love.\u201d Sure.\n\nHey, CNN, you know how when the president of the United States says something you don\u2019t think is true, you say, \u201cTrump says\u201d or \u201cTrump claims\u201d or \u201cTrump alleges\u201d? Do you know you\u2019re allowed to do that with others who say stuff that looks like it\u2019s probably not true? It would be good for you, and good for the country, if you maintained in good working order the B.S. detector of any small-market newspaper\u2019s metro editor and expressed interest in seeing evidence before you started believing wildly implausible tales. Plus CNN would be more amusing, and seem less like a deranged presidential stalker, if it started snark-chyroning people other than Trump. \u201cSmall-time actor claims big bias crime (it smells fishy)\u201d would have been fun.", "description": "The American media are full of people who have no idea why a fading celebrity, Jussie Smollett, would want to fake a hate crime against himself.", "authors": ["Kyle Smith", "Andrew C.
