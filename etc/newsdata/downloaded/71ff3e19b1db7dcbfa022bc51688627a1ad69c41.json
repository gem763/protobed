It\u2019s believed that volcanic activity is responsible for roughly four of the five largest mass extinctions during the last 500 million years.\n\n\u2018Prior to industrialism, volcanic activity was the major release mechanism of large amounts of mercury from the Earth\u2019s crust,\u2019 Sanei said.\n\n\u2018That makes it possible to use mercury in sediments to trace major volcanic activity in the Earth\u2019s past.\u2019\n\nWill humans cause another mass extinction? (Picture: Getty)\n\nThe team found that mutated mercury spores became more common as mercury levels increased.\n\n\u2018In some of my counts I found almost only mutated spores and no normal ones, which is very unusual,\u2019 Sofie Lindstr\u00f6m added.\n\nIt\u2019s believed soaring mercury levels caused mass poisoning and therefore \u2018help to explain the sudden deterioration of the ecosystem\u2019.\n\n\u201cThis could hint to that the whole food chain might have been negatively affected,\u2019 Lindstr\u00f6m added.\n\n\u2018Generally, we prefer simple explanations to mass extinctions such as meteorite impacts or climate change, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that simple.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018As our study suggests there could very well be a cocktail effect of CO2 and global warming, toxins like mercury, and other factors as well.\u2019\n\n\u2018Still, it is very difficult to say how big the importance of one factor is because mass extinctions like this are very likely very complex events. Our study shows that mercury affected the ferns and likely also other plants, and it may also have had an impact on the entire food chain.\u2019\n\nThe researchers claimed their study of the end-Triassic mass extinction \u2018in many ways draws parallels to the current global situation\u2019.\n\n\u2018Our global society emits a lot of the same substances and greenhouse gases as these huge volcanic provinces did during these mass extinctions. Therefore, studies in what happened back then might help us to prevent it from happening again,\u2019 Lindstr\u00f6m concluded.", "description": "And human pollution could have a similar effect to lethal natural processes which caused the ancient cataclysm.", "authors": ["Jasper Hamill"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/eforest-a182_1572369097.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
