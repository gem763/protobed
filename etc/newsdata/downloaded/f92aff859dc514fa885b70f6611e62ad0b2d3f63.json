But all the rest are the source of our problems. That is what is happening today. All those who are not playing his game are 'traitors' or a 'collaborator', or 'surrenderers'.\n\n\"Well in my opinion, dear colleagues the real traitor is he or she who risks bringing disaster upon his country, its economy, and its citizens, by pushing Britain out of the European Union. That is in my opinion, a traitor.\"\n\nMr Verhofstadt's incendiary remarks come after Boris Johnson and other Brexiteers were criticised for adopting hardline rhetoric themselves, branding a bill to prevent no-deal the \"Surrender Act\" and calling for \"Britain first\" policies.\n\nIn the same debate Brexit Party MEP Martin Daubney hit back at Mr Verhofstadt's speech, telling him: \"You don't respect democracy ... you've lost, my friend, goodbye.\"\n\nMr Verhofstadt also criticised Leave-leaning Labour MPs who had said they would vote for Mr Johnson's proposal. He noted that the plan removed protections for environmental, social and labour standard protections that Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement included.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

I think the proposal that Boris Johnson put forward exactly one week ago was not serious at all, dear colleagues.\n\n\"Not serious at all, because it was in fact \u2013 I call it a virtual proposal - not a real proposal.
