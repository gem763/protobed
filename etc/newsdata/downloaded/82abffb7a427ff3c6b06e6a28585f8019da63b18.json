The law was enacted in 2014, but it\u2019s been halted from taking effect while the Supreme Court considered whether to act. \u201cWe are definitely excited that it\u2019s gonna finally be heard and a decision is gonna be made,\u201d she added.\n\nAnd while the law doesn\u2019t directly challenge, anti-abortion activists haven\u2019t lost sight of the grand prize.\u201cThe Supreme Court can address the viability ofin any abortion case that comes before the court,\u201d said Steve Aden, chief legal officer for the national anti-abortion organization Americans United for Life. He added, \u201cAt the very least we\u2019ll get, I expect, quite a lot more clarity on where the court stands on abortion by the end of this term in June.\u201d\n\n\n\nREAD: Federal judge rips \u2018abortion reversal\u2019 as \u2018devoid of scientific support.\u2019\n\nThe fact that the court is devoting time to the case at all signals that there are justices who may be less than satisfied with its 2016 decision to strike down a Texas law nearly identical to the Louisiana regulation. At the time, abortion rights activists heralded that case \u2014 Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt \u2014 as a sweeping smackdown of so-called TRAP laws, or \u201ctargeted regulations of abortion providers.\u201d They say laws that demand abortion providers have local admitting privileges are medically unnecessary and aimed at forcing clinics to shutter.\n\nAbortion rights supporters say that if the Supreme Court lets Louisiana\u2019s law go into effect, the protections once guaranteed by Whole Woman\u2019s Health will be gutted.\n\nLawyers at the Center for Reproductive Rights had asked the Supreme Court to rule without even hearing oral arguments because they felt the case\u2019s outcome was so obvious.\n\n\u201cThis is the very definition of an open-and-shut case. The facts, the law, and the Constitution have not changed since 2016,\u201d Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights, told reporters during a call Friday.\n\nThe administrator of the Louisiana abortion clinic that sued over the law was disappointed that the justices believe they need to hear arguments in her case.\n\n\u201cMy initial reaction was like, \u2018Oh my God, I\u2019m relieved, I\u2019m relieved, OK, they\u2019re going to hear my case,\u2019\u201d Kathaleen Pittman of Hope Medical Group for Women told VICE News. \u201cThen that was immediately replaced with frustration and absolute anger. Why are they having to hear this?\u201d\n\nREAD: 'I am honestly scared to death': Small abortion clinics are fighting for survival over Trump\u2019s new abortion rules.\n\nNone of the anti-abortion activists who spoke with VICE News, however, believed that the precedent set by the Whole Woman\u2019s Health decision would be necessarily nullified if Louisiana's law is allowed to go into effect. They maintained that the Whole Woman\u2019s Health ruling was narrow, and didn\u2019t necessarily apply to every state that has mandated that abortion providers get admitting privileges.\n\n\u201cShould the constitutionality of each state\u2019s admitting privileges laws be judged on the basis of that state\u2019s own facts and circumstances?\u201d Aden said. \u201cYes. That\u2019s the way the Supreme Court has set this up. They preside as the nation\u2019s chief abortion regulator.\u201d\n\nIf the Supreme Court rules in their favor, that take will likely be cemented as true.\n\n\u201cI know it surprises some of those on the pro-abortion side, who probably were relying on the fact that the Supreme Court has often gone many, many years between decisions,\u201d added Kristi Hamrick, chief media strategist for Students for Life, which has representatives on more than 1,200 campuses. \u201cBut that\u2019s inappropriate. The court should weigh in on this human rights issue.\u201d\n\nThis year, Students for Life is not only lobbying legislators, but the group\u2019s president is also embarking on a fall speaking tour about \u201ca world after Roe,\u201d Hamrick said. Students for Life has always focused on preparing the country for the day after the Supreme Court overturns Roe, Hamrick said, even though people used to laugh at that mission.\n\n\u201cNow, many of us, even on the pro-choice side of things, believe that\u2019s not only possible but probable.\u201d\n\nCover: Pro-life abortion protesters, with red tape over their mouths, stand in silent protest on the first day of the new session of the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday, Oct. 7, 2019.
