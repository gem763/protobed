Constraint imposes discipline and we felt it was the right thing for our investors to maintain discipline and a consistent fund size across vintages.\u201d\n\nAirTree's basic investment premise has not changed a great deal since its first fund was established; it aims to get on board a start-up on its first smaller funding round, before putting its deep pockets to good use with larger follow on investments.\n\nMr Blair said the interest from super funds in backing venture capital was a significant shift for the broader Australian innovation economy.\n\nUntil recently super funds largely viewed start-up investment as too risky, and the individual cheque sizes too small in comparison to their vast pools of capital, to make the due diligence worthwhile.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever Mr Blair said institutions had been suitably convinced that the potential for making big gains was good enough to take the sector seriously.\n\nHe said \"$100 million locally led funding rounds are now possible and Australia and New Zealand are now spawning a billion-dollar tech company per year on average\".\n\n\"The interest from super funds this time compared to our 2014 fund was like chalk and cheese. We were also lucky to bring on endowments, which gives us an additional sense of purpose. Australian venture capital is starting to prove itself out as an institutional asset class.\"\n\nThe AirTree team has grown significantly since its first fund was raised. Louise Kennerley\n\nAirTree partner James Cameron said the process of raising the third round had enabled the fund to have valuable conversations with institutional investors, in which they were given interesting insights into how they were performing in comparison to VC peers in the US.\n\nHe said they were told that AirTree's first two funds were well above the benchmark for top US VC funds.\n\nDespite having a large amount of capital to deploy it is becoming increasingly important for VC funds to be able to display their comparative quality, as the most promising start-ups have more options when sourcing funds.\n\n\"It\u2019s still too early to talk about returns in any meaningful way, but events like Prospa\u2019s ASX listing in June are starting to show what\u2019s possible,\u201d Mr Cameron said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Capital is absolutely a commodity in this market. Great companies have a tonne of options, so to attract the best founders to work with us we need to offer much more than just money.\n\n\"For some, that can mean empathy for the struggle - we\u2019ve walked in their shoes and know how hard it is. And for others, it\u2019s our portfolio services team which provides recruitment support, expertise, connections and advocacy.\"\n\nPersonnel expansion\n\nAs well as increasing the amount of money in its coffers over the last five years, AirTree has also expanded its personnel significantly. At the same time as closing its third fund, it has promoted Elicia McDonald from its investment team to become a Principal, with a mandate to lead new investments.\n\nMeanwhile Emily Close has been promoted from a business development and community role to join the investment team as an associate.\n\nLocal VC funds have come in for criticism in recent times for a lack of gender diversity in senior investment roles. A study of Australia's 13 leading funds by The Australian Financial Review earlier this month found that of 50 partners, only 11 were women.\n\nThat ratio holds true at AirTree, where one of its five partners - finance and operations partner Helen Norton - is a woman.\n\n\"Clearly we have a lot of work to do when it comes to diversity in VC. We actually have an inclusion clause in our standard term sheet which requires our companies to interview at least one candidate from an under-represented population for C-level roles,\" Mr Blair said.\n\n\"We do the same for all roles at AirTree and are committed to developing a strong pipeline of VC talent. Helen, Elicia and Emily have all more than earned their respective promotions and it\u2019s been wonderful to watch them step up and take on more responsibility.\u201d", "description": "One of the country's best known VCs has closed a big new fund to target fast growing companies, saying institutional investors are now much more eager to join the fray.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3979%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_230%2C$y_340/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/7bd83f455e4e4169c0f42d73718be574845f42bb", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
