For one of them it will be for the last time.\n\n\n\n12.45pm (approx) - Debate on the Grenfell fire tragedy.\n\n\n\nWhat I am reading:\n\n\n\nJeremy Corbyn in the Mirror on Labour\u2019s election plans", "description": "A handful of votes in a handful of seats could determine the result of the general election", "authors": ["Jason Beattie", "Image", "Rob Pinney Lnp", "Peter Summers", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20754192.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Westminster-Politics.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
