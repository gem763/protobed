USA TODAY\n\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. \u2014 Listening to Bill Belichick talk about the Giants, you'd think he might be expecting to see them a second time after their Thursday night meeting.\n\nThat's usually how Belichick handles these things: praise the opponent before looking to dismantle everything about that said opponent. The Giants are different for Belichick, though, considering the love he has for the franchise dating back to his time here as an assistant on Bill Parcells' staff for two Super Bowl wins in 1986 and 1990.\n\n\"My thoughts are just trying to prepare our team on a short week for a really good Giants team, a team that has gotten a little bit of a spark, a very dangerous and explosive team that we've got to turn around on a short week,\" Belichick said.\n\nThe Patriots are the defending Super Bowl champions. They're currently 5-0 and their defense has given up 20 points total in five games. Of course, Tom Brady and Super Bowl MVP Julian Edelman, among others, are on the other side of the ball.\n\n\"We've had our moments, but right now it's just focusing on the challenge ahead with the Giants,\" Belichick said. \"The Giants have so many weapons on offense: a great tight end, two great quarterbacks, probably the best running back in the league, a very good receiving group, very experienced on the offensive line ... they're well coached, they have a great scheme, a very well-balanced offense and that's a lot for me, a lot for us to handle and try to prepare for. They can run it, they can throw it, throw it deep, throw it to the backs, throw it to the tight ends, catch and run plays, playaction, drop back, misdirection, you name it - it's a lot to get ready for.\"\n\nThose Giants are currently 2-3 and coming off a 28-10 loss at home to the Vikings.\n\nHere is what Belichick had to say about Daniel Jones, Saquon Barkley and Eli Manning during a Monday morning conference call with reporters who cover Big Blue:\n\nImpressed with Daniel Jones\n\nNew York Giants quarterback Daniel Jones (8) walks off the field after his first loss.

He took a visit to meet with the team \u2013 in a noteworthy twist, Jones left Foxborough and detoured to East Rutherford, where he met with the Giants, who ended up drafting him No. 6 overall.\n\nHere were Belichick's thoughts on Jones, specifically what he revealed about his time with the Patriots:\n\n\"We had a great visit. He spent most of the day here, spent a lot of time with our offensive coaches: [offensive coordinator] Josh [McDaniels], [assistant quarterbacks coach] Mick Lombardi, guys that work with that position on the offensive side of the ball. We had a good visit, great conversation, kinda talked about a lot of things. Very mature, certainly a good understanding of the Duke offense and Coach [David] Cutcliffe, and some of the things that they were doing there. Again, good grasp of the offensive system - protections, routes, route concepts and why they're using different combinations in certain situations. And actually, I think it was kind of a change of plans at the end of his visit, I think he was supposed to go somewhere, but then he ended up going to the Giants from here. And so, when I saw that, I kinda, I could figure out there was something going on there.\"\n\nBelichick has amassed a 17-5 record in games against rookie quarterbacks, including an 11-0 mark at home. Those who have beaten the Patriots: Ben Roethlisberger (2004), Mark Sanchez (2009), Colt McCoy (2010), Russell Wilson (2012) and Geno Smith (2013). The Patriots have beaten five rookie quarterbacks since.\n\n\"He's an impressive player and a very impressive person. We had a great visit,\" Belichick said of Jones. \"Playing quarterback in New York is not the easiest thing in the world, but he's got a lot of maturity and a good head on his shoulders, has good perspective on football and overall leadership and the position that comes with that role on and off the field. I'm sure he's done well and will continue to do well.\"\n\nOn Saquon Barkley's potential return\n\n\"Outstanding player. We haven't faced him and kinda hope we don't. But, we need to be ready for him. I'm sure, he's a very competitive guy, I'm sure he's doing all he can to be ready to go, I know it was close last week, so we'll probably get him.\"\n\nBelichick went on to offer a glowing scouting report on the reigning Offensive Rookie of the Year.\n\n\"He can do it all: great power, speed, they use him well in the passing game. He's very hard to tackle in the open field. He's hard to tackle anywhere,\" he said of Barkley. \"He's got good vision, good quickness, he can play in space, he's elusive, he's got power. Really, with 2,000 yards from scrimmage last year, that pretty much says it all right there. Plus, we know he can return kickoffs, and everything else.\n\nHe's got a ton of skill and as good as any back we've seen on film. We watched a lot of him last year because we didn't expect him to play in preseason, but just in getting ready for the Giants in the preseason, we saw a lot of last year's film. What a player he was for them, and he was an explosive player, dynamic player this year. We definitely have to be ready for him.\"\n\nRespect for Eli Manning\n\n\"I have a ton of respect for Eli,\" Belichick said. \"He's a great person. Very professional Team oriented. I spent over a decade at the Giants, and I have an appreciation for playing quarterback for that franchise in that environment. I think he's done a tremendous job and certainly had a lot of success against us. I have a great deal of respect for him. But I'm really focused on trying to coach our team, and I need to do a better job of my job, and I'm not really looking to evaluate what everybody else is doing. I've got my own full plate here. I'm trying to coach the Patriots.\"\n\nEmail: stapleton@northjersey.com Twitter: @art_stapleton", "description": "In prepping to play the Giants on Thursday, Patriots coach Bill Belichick offered a lot of praise for Daniel Jones, Saquon Barkley and Eli Manning.", "authors": ["Art Stapleton", "Published P.M.
