Just down the road, Bolton Wanderers were also in a race against time to save their future.\n\nHowever, Bolton were saved in the final hours as the club administrators announced a late takeover by Football Ventures Limited had been completed. An ending Bury supporters could have only wished for.\n\nDale was a toxic figure at Bury and couldn't find a buyer and they sadly dropped out the EFL\n\nBarrett-Baxendale is understood to have facilitated the call between Kenwright and Jevans, which took place in the stands at Villa Park after fans had left the Premier League match.\n\nSubsequently, Jevans declined Kenwright's \u00a31million offer.\n\nThe EFL did not comment on the matter but did make it clear it is against league rules for an individual to have 'an interest or influence over more than one club' and that clubs are not allowed to 'directly or indirectly: lend to, gift money to, purchase future receivables from or guarantee the debts or obligations' of another club'.\n\nTherefore, despite his act of generosity, Everton chairman Bill Kenwright would have been breaching the EFL rules by lending Bury FC money in their time of need.", "description": "In a last ditch attempt to salvage Bury FC, Everton chairman Bill Kenwright offered \u00a31million of his own money to help save the doomed League One club.", "authors": ["Ieuan Ivett For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/10/20239154-0-image-a-5_1572171028815.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
