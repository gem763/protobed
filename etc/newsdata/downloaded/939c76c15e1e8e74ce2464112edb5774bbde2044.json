That would apply to the affected MacBook Pros.\n\nIn addition to the FAA, a number of airlines and regulatory bodies throughout the world have issued guidance relating to the hazardous laptops.\n\nScroll down for a list of airlines, agencies, and countries that have banned or restricted the recalled MacBook Pro from flights.\n\nTo see if your laptop is affected, visit Apple's recall page and enter the serial number, which can be found by clicking the small Apple logo in the upper-left corner of the menu bar and then clicking \"About This Mac.\"", "description": "Certain models of the laptop were banned from flights after Apple issued a recall.
