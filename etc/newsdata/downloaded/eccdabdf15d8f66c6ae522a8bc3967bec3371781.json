This time, multiple news have arrived from Colombia and Venezuela.\n\nThe Coffee Axis town of Pereira, in Colombia\u2019s western Risaralda department, appears to be turning into the country\u2019s unofficial cryptocurrency capital. The town has a population of just over 474,000, but, per a report from El Diario, boasts at least 29 stores that accept cryptocurrency as a means of payment.\n\nThe country\u2019s government does not recognize cryptocurrencies as legal tender. But Bogota has not yet moved to stop Pereira businesses from pushing ahead with their crypto pay plans.\n\nThe news outlet reports that most of the businesses that accept cryptocurrency payments in the town are \u201cappliances retailers.\u201d Other Coffee Axis towns are also stepping up their crypto pay game \u2013 with between eight and 20 businesses thought to be accepting bitcoin and altcoin pay in nearby Manizales and at least five in Armenia, the capital of the Quindio Department.\n\nThe news outlet quotes a Paxful spokesperson as stating the company\u2019s platform has seen over USD 1 million worth of cryptocurrency transactions processed so far in 2019.\n\nMeanwhile, across the border in equally crypto-keen Venezuela, President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro says the country is conducting numerous international and domestic transactions in its Petro cryptocurrency. The Petro is the brainchild of the Maduro regime and is backed by the country\u2019s oil reserves \u2013 although United States President Donald Trump has imposed a blanket ban on companies and states trading in the cryptocurrency.\n\nWithout providing any proofs, Maduro stated, \u201cIn many parts of the world, you can already make purchases using the [Petro].\u201d\n\nAccording to the government\u2019s media arm, Maduro has also promised new announcements regarding cryptocurrencies in the days ahead.\n\nAs previously reported, Maduro recently announced he wanted to use cryptocurrencies to pay off Venezuela\u2019s international creditors \u2013 primarily in Russia and China. Cryptonews.com also reported that Maduro appears to be in possession of large quantities of both bitcoin and ethereum \u2013 and could look to pay Caracas\u2019 debts off using these tokens.\n\nReuters reported that Russia\u2019s deputy prime minister Yuri Borisov traveled to Venezuela this weekend to meet Maduro \u2013 with the president\u2019s cryptocurrency-powered economic plan presumably on the agenda.\n\nAlso in Venezuela, crypto-keen department store Traki has installed its first Bitcoin ATM. The department store has 49 branches in locations all over the country, and says it processed over 1,000 crypto pay transactions in the period March 2019 to September 2019.\n\nPer a Twitter user who shared a photograph of the new ATM, the machine allows customers to buy BTC and Dash tokens and is located in the Traki store in the El Recreo Shopping Mall, in Caracas\u2019 Sabana Grande shopping district.\n\nHoy se hace historia con esta apertura al p\u00fablico del primer #CajeroCripto En @TRAKIenganchate El Recreo ya puedes\u2026 https://t.co/0945vYGjvn \u2014 Alejandro Fernandes (@alefcripto)\n\nAnd elsewhere in the region, Peru\u2019s ports say they will adopt blockchain technology.\n\nPer Port Portal (via Diario Bitcoin), the National Port Authority of Peru announced it wants to use blockchain and other Industry 4.0 advances in a bid to attract international investment to the country\u2019s USD 47.2 billion/year shipping industry.", "description": "It seems that Latin America dominates crypto adoption news agenda with new announcements every week.
