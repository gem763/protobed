It doesn\u2019t take a stable genius to see the magnitude of this conflict. Or how destructive it is to our national security. https://t.co/X4yhTS2q1Z \u2014 Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) August 29, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s almost like Schiff couldn\u2019t help himself and had to share something he thought he knew \u2026 remember when he told the world he had proof that Trump colluded with Russia?\n\nThis guy is a train wreck.\n\nSeriously.\n\nWait a minute. Check this out: Schiff tweeted this exact same Trump-Ukraine \"collusion\" narrative a month ago. Hmm \u2026 Exactly how long have Schiffty-Schiff and Dems been working with this \"whistleblower\"? Smelling more and more like prefabrication https://t.co/cRXi222Zwi \u2014 Paul Sperry (@paulsperry_) September 27, 2019\n\nHow long indeed?\n\nDemocrats have proven themselves even dirtier than we realized, and Adam Schiff is leading that charge.\n\nLetter to Schiff from WB dated 8/12, I believe. He's known for weeks. \u2014 Bonny Wright\ud83d\udc1d (@miamivandynyu) September 27, 2019\n\nSo why sit on it?\n\nVery fishy \u2014 Lisa (@kittywhisperer7) September 27, 2019\n\nSomething stinks in Denmark.\n\nWhat a coincidence. \u2014 KMarie (@kmjohnson116) September 27, 2019\n\nRight?\n\nHrm.\n\nYou're a parody \u2014 Crib72 (@Crib722) September 26, 2019\n\nHe\u2019s proven that time and time again.\n\nYet Schiff claimed he didn\u2019t know and the information didn\u2019t flow to congress. Schiff is a liar. \u2014 peonie (@whitepeoni) September 27, 2019\n\nAnd a parody.\n\nSo Schiff really has been \u2018sitting\u2019 on this information, sort of like when Feinstein sat on the magical Christine Blasey-Ford letter \u2026 how anyone can take these people the least bit seriously is beyond us.\n\nRelated:\n\nTake SO many seats!
