Lindsey Graham of South Carolina indicated he could be open to impeaching the president, if evidence emerged that Trump had engaged in a \"quid pro quo\" arrangement with Ukraine in an effort to secure compromising information on Democrat rival Joe Biden.\n\nSen. Romney of Utah listed reasons for impeaching the president, including racist rhetoric, extramarital affairs, and abandonment of the US' Kurdish allies in Syria.\n\nAs things stand, Democrats still appear to be far short of the 20 Republican allies they would need to remove the president from office after an impeachment trial.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nFor most of his presidency, amid controversy and provocation, Trump has been able to rely on a so-called \"red wall\" of support from congressional Republicans, on top of his extremely solid support among the GOP grass roots.\n\nBut recent comments from two senators, and reports of widespread opposition from within his own party to his plans to host the G7 summit at his own Florida gold club, show that weaknesses exist.\n\nIn an interview with Axios TV, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, usually among the president's staunchest allies, expressed rare exasperation at the president's behavior. He said he could still back impeachment if evidence emerged that the president had broken the law.\n\nCalling Trump a \"handful\" and \"an equal opportunity abuser of people,\" he addressed the whistleblower's complaint behind the impeachment inquiry, a document alleging that the president sought to trade military aid for political favors from Ukraine in a \"quid pro quo\" arrangement.\n\n\"If you could show me that, you know, Trump actually was engaging in a quid pro quo outside the phone call, that would be very disturbing,\" he said.\n\nSen. Mitt Romney of Utah went a step further in his interview with the outlet, listing the grounds for removing the president from office. Sources close to the senator \u2014 a longstanding critic of Trump \u2014 told the outlet he would be among the first to vote to convict Trump.\n\n\"He has elements, I'm sure, of honor in his life. And there's things that I think are not honorable. And I mention that because of the payment to a porn star for sexual relations outside of marriage,\" said Romney.\n\nThe remark was a reference to accusations from the president's former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, that Trump authorized hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels.\n\nMitt Romney speaks to journalists on January 24, 2019. Romney said he would be 'studying' a vote to block the president declaring a national emergency.

Scott Applewhite) Associated Press\n\nAnd the numbers may bear out this belief.\n\nFor the president to be removed from office after a Senate impeachment trial, 20 Republicans must join the 45 Senate Democrats and 2 Independents to meet the 67 vote threshold for removal to take place.\n\nAxios has identified only eight Republican senators, including Romney but not including Graham, whose vote may be in the balance. Most of them face re-election battles in 2020.\n\nGraham's possible defection could be much more worrying for Trump, as it may encourage other Republicans privately critical of the president but publicly supportive to break cover and vote to remove him from office.\n\nHowever, such a shift seems unlikely straight away, as Graham made a point of praising the president's domestic agenda in his Axios interview.\n\nMeaning that though signs of weakness have appeared, the wall at this point still stands.", "description": "Trump has faced criticism and opposition from moderate Republicans in recent days, exposing weaknesses in support assumed to be impregnable.", "authors": ["Tom Porter"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5dad9bcecc4a0a375d0defa4?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
