REUTERS/Rebecca Cook/File Photo\n\nNegotiators from the United Auto Workers already faced contentious talks with General Motors Co (GM.N), Ford Motor Co (F.N) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) (FCHA.MI) (FCAU.N), focusing on thorny issues like healthcare costs and profit-sharing at a time when U.S. new vehicle sales are declining.\n\nBut Saturday\u2019s deadline could be overshadowed by the latest revelations in a mushrooming corruption scandal, of vast sums being spent on lavish entertainment by labor leaders - including $440 bottles of champagne originally created to please a Russian czar and scantily clad women to light union leaders\u2019 cigars.\n\nThe union had hoped to put the federal probe behind it by electing Gary Jones, a former regional director for the union, as president in 2018. He was chosen as he seemed far removed from the scandal.\n\nBut Vance Pearson, 58, served as Jones\u2019 second in command from 2016 to 2018 and replaced him last year as director of the UAW\u2019s so-called \u201cRegion 5,\u201d which covers 17 western and southwestern U.S. states.\n\nPearson\u2019s arrest comes just two weeks after the FBI conducted searches including at Jones\u2019 home, as part of an ongoing corruption probe into illegal payments to union officials.\n\nJones has not been charged with any wrongdoing. A lawyer for Jones did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAdding to intrigue, the complaint makes frequent reference to someone identified only as \u201cUAW Official A,\u201d saying government agents had seized $30,000 in cash from the individual\u2019s residence.\n\nSteven Bernstein, a Tampa-based labor attorney at Fisher Phillips LLP, said the latest charges create a \u201cdifficult dynamic\u201d for the union in talks with automakers.\n\n\u201cThis does have the potential to compromise whatever leverage the union\u2019s leaders think they have,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a statement, the UAW said \u201cwe strongly believe that the government has misconstrued any number of facts and emphasize that these are merely allegations, not proof of wrongdoing.\u201d\n\nLast week, the UAW said it would target GM first out of the Detroit automakers for focused contract talks.\n\nGM said in a statement it was \u201coutraged and deeply concerned\u201d by the revelations.\n\n\u201cThese serious allegations represent a stunning abuse of power and trust,\u201d the company said.\n\nThe widening probe raises questions about whether the U.S. government might seek to take over the UAW. Peter Henning, a Wayne State University law professor and former federal prosecutor, said a UAW takeover would be \u201cthe nuclear option.\u201d\n\nIn 1988, the Justice Department sued to force out senior leaders at the International Brotherhood of Teamsters union and appoint a trustee because of the union\u2019s connection to organized crime. The government oversaw the union from March 1989 until 2015 when it agreed to a five-year transition period that will end in February 2020.\n\nCRISTAL CHAMPAGNE FOR $1,760\n\nThe complaint said between 2014 and 2018 Pearson and other leading UAW officials had submitted \u201cfraudulent expense forms.\u201d\n\nMuch of the complaint centers on conferences held by the UAW\u2019s Region 5 in Palm Springs, California. The allegations include that, through a \u201cmaster account\u201d set up at a Palm Springs hotel, union officials embezzled more than $600,000 spent on lavish living for weeks or months at a time. Agents had also found similar payments from accounts at two other hotels.\n\nThe complaint singles out a dinner at a local restaurant on New Year\u2019s Eve 2016 that cost $6,600, including four bottles of Louis Roederer Cristal champagne for a total of $1,760.\n\nThe complaint quotes from the Louis Roederer website that the Cristal was \u201ccreated in 1876 to satisfy the demanding tastes of (Russian) Tsar Alexander II,\u201d who was assassinated by a revolutionary in 1881.\n\nHarley Shaiken, a labor expert at the University of California-Berkeley, said the news could be a distraction for negotiators, but the union and its members are focused on a new contract.\n\n\u201cUAW members are focused on how a deal will affect them,\u201d he said. \u201cBut even a small number of angry members could color a ratification vote on a contract.\u201d\n\nRelated Coverage Factbox: Highlights from criminal complaint in widening UAW corruption probe\n\nThe ongoing scandal also affects a labor organization closely allied with Democrats a little over a year away from a U.S. presidential election. The UAW represents tens of thousands of workers in the battleground states of Ohio and Michigan.\n\nTo date, nine people have pleaded guilty in connection with the ongoing investigation into illegal payoffs to UAW officials by FCA executives and corruption within the UAW.\n\nLast week, former UAW official Michael Grimes pleaded guilty to wire fraud and money laundering. Grimes was an official in the union\u2019s GM department until retiring in 2018.", "description": "Just two days before the UAW's contracts with Detroit automakers were due to expire, U.S. prosecutors arrested and charged a senior union official on Thursday with embezzlement, releasing a complaint that alleges he spent member dues on lavish parties for union leaders, with liquor, cigars and women to light them.", "authors": ["Nick Carey", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1429210261&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B1Z7", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
