In an interview on former Barack Obama adviser David Plouffe\u2019s podcast, Hillary Clinton offered what might be called the Unified Theory of Russian Interference in the 2016 election. Hillary warns that Tulsi Gabbard could launch a third-party bid on behalf of her Russian handlers in 2020 \u2014 just the same way that Green Party nominee Jill Stein did in 2016.\n\nOn second thought, perhaps Hillary has had a little too much vodka of late:\n\nColor WaPo analyst Aaron Blake unimpressed by Hillary\u2019s conspiracy-theory rantings about either Gabbard or Stein:\n\nIn a conversation on former Obama campaign manager David Plouffe\u2019s podcast, Clinton suggested the Russians are leveraging a number of top U.S. politicians. She suggested Russia had kompromat on Trump. She accused 2016 Green Party nominee Jill Stein of being a \u201cRussian asset.\u201d And she suggested Russia might back Gabbard as a third-party candidate. \u201cThey\u2019re also going to do third-party again,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI\u2019m not making any predictions, but I think they\u2019ve got their eye on someone who\u2019s currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate. She\u2019s the favorite of the Russians. They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far.\u201d The \u201cagain\u201d referred to Stein, whom some Clinton supporters have accused (rather baselessly) of serving as a spoiler for Clinton in 2016. Stein got around 1 percent of the vote in the three decisive states \u2014 Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2014 but exit polls showed most of her voters wouldn\u2019t have supported either Clinton or Trump if Stein weren\u2019t running. Clinton then flat-out labeled Stein a \u201cRussian asset.\u201d \u201cAnd that\u2019s assuming Jill Stein will give it up, which she might not because she\u2019s also a Russian asset,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cYeah, she\u2019s a Russian asset \u2014 I mean, totally. They know they can\u2019t win without a third-party candidate. So I don\u2019t know who it\u2019s going to be, but I will guarantee you they will have a vigorous third-party challenge in the key states that they most needed.\u201d\n\nThe part about Stein is especially lunatic. The Green Party might be fringy and socialist, but it\u2019s a long-established minor party that had ballot access in 31 states by the 2006 midterms, and expanded it to 45 states for the 2016 election. After the 2016 election, Hillary wasn\u2019t complaining about Stein as she launched recount campaigns in the \u201cblue wall\u201d states Hillary lost, attempting to discredit Trump\u2019s victory over baseless allegations of cheating and (of course) Russian manipulation of ballot results.\n\nThe allegation against Gabbard is only slightly less insane. And yes, Hillary spokesman Nick Merrill confirmed, that\u2019s exactly who Hillary meant:\n\nUpdate from @merica: when asked if the former secretary of state was referring to Gabbard, Clinton spox Nick Merrill said, \u201cIf the nesting doll fits.\u201d \u201cThis is not some outlandish claim,\u201d Merrill added. \u201cThis is reality.\u201d \u2014 Rebecca Buck (@RebeccaBuck) October 18, 2019\n\nThat\u2019s just nuts. Let\u2019s say for a hot moment that Russian intelligence would pick a Manchurian Candidate for a presidential election. Would they choose someone who\u2019s barely been in politics, someone who\u2019s already viewed as rather fringy, and who can\u2019t acquire much of her own support? Of course not. It would be all risk, no reward.\n\nAs for the impact of all that \u201cgrooming\u201d and the sites and the bots oh my, take a look at RCP\u2019s full polling aggregation for this year. Gabbard hasn\u2019t scored above 3% in any poll, and she has a lot more zeroes than threes. Her current polling aggregation average is 1.2%. If the Russians are \u201cgrooming\u201d her, they\u2019re terrible at their jobs.\n\nThis, of course, is part of the same conceit of Russiagate all along. We have spent the last three years hyperventilating over a Russian \u201cmerry prankster\u201d disinformation campaign that spent $25 million in a cycle where the two candidates and their allies spent well over two billion dollars on messaging. No one \u2014 not a single person \u2014 has ever shown that the Russian social-media campaign ever changed a single voter\u2019s mind, regardless of their intent.\n\nThis is an insane conspiracy theory, and it\u2019s a demonstration that Hillary has simply lost her mind in the wake of her incompetent performance in 2016. The irony of this is that Hillary\u2019s doing this as part of her book tour for her new tome The Book of Gutsy Women. It seems that Hillary doesn\u2019t appreciate some \u201cgutsy women\u201d as much as others.", "description": "\"That's assuming Jill Stein will give it up ... she's also a Russian asset.
