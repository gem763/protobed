(Shell logo above)\n\n'The National Theatre has declared a climate emergency today ... Shell have been valued and longstanding supporters of the National Theatre ... This membership will come to an end in June 2020,' a National Theatre spokeswoman said.\n\nShell, which had been giving the theatre around 15,000 pounds a year as a corporate member, said 'heightened awareness of climate change... is a good thing'.\n\n'As a company, we agree that urgent action is needed. What will really accelerate change is effective policy, investment in technology innovation and deployment, and changing customer behaviour,' a Shell spokesman added.\n\nThe Royal Shakespeare Company (pictured above) has cut ties with oil giant BP\n\nBP (logo above) said it was disappointed and dismayed that the RSC has decided to end the partnership\n\nThe National Theatre's statement also claimed it could make a difference by inspiring people to make a change, and the National would examine the way it operates and make alterations to be more environmentally friendly.\n\nIt said: 'Theatre, like all industries, has an impact: We create work that is inherently temporary; that makes use of raw materials, of heat, light and sound; that asks people to travel to a particular location at a particular time.\n\n'However, we believe theatre can be part of the solution - we tell stories, shape culture and encourage empathy and understanding. Our industry is made up of creative and inspiring people who are motivated to make change.\n\n'The scale of the change required means we are already scrutinising every part of the way we operate.'\n\nIn the case of the RSC, BP had sponsored the RSC's \u00a35 ticket scheme for 16-25-year olds, since 2013.\n\nThe move by the RSC may have also been spurred on by actors such as Sir Mark Rylance, who quit the company over the issue\n\nThe company has since said it was 'disappointed and dismayed that the RSC has decided to end our partnership early.'\n\n'We recognise the world is on an unsustainable path and needs to transition rapidly to net-zero in the coming decades.\n\n'The debate centres around how to deliver this whilst meeting the world's growing energy demands.\n\n'BP is focused on this dual challenge, we are in action, have ambitious plans for the future and welcome engagement with all about how to make the energy we produce cleaner and better.\n\n'Ironically, the increasing polarisation of debate, and attempts to exclude companies committed to making real progress, is exactly what is not needed.\n\n'This global challenge needs everyone, companies, governments and individuals, to work together to achieve a low carbon future,' a statement from BP said.\n\nArtistic director for the RSC Gregory Doran, and executive direction Catherine Mallyon said young people have told them that the BP sponsorship had put a 'barrier' between them and their engagement with the RSC.\n\n'We cannot ignore that message,' they said.\n\nThe move may have also been spurred on by actors such as Sir Mark Rylance, who quit the company over the issue.\n\nThe RSC added it had 'listened to a wide and varied range of voices' over recent months.\n\nMany of the protests have been inspired by climate activist Greta Thunberg (pictured above)\n\nSenior climate campaigner for Greenpeace UK Mel Evans said: 'This week the world of Big Oil sponsorships has seen more break-ups than an episode of Love Island. The curtains are coming down fast on this long-running farce where the joke is ultimately on all of us.\n\n'As the impacts of the climate emergency play out all around the world, the reputational damage of being associated with the industry fuelling the problem far outweighs any financial benefit.\n\n'It's time for oil giants to get the moral of the story, ditch a business model that's destroying our world, and shift to renewable energy.'", "description": "The National Theatre said the move was part of a broader 'climate emergency' initiative to reduce its carbon impact.\nThe RSC announced on Wednesday that it would drop BP as its sponsor.", "authors": ["Chantalle Edmunds For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/17/19307256-0-image-a-16_1570207860017.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
