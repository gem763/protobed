Instagram head Adam Mosseri explained the decision in a company blog post stating:\n\nThis past month, we further expanded our policies to prohibit more types of self-harm and suicide content. We will no longer allow fictional depictions of self-harm or suicide on Instagram, such as drawings or memes or content from films or comics that use graphic imagery. We will also remove other imagery that may not show self-harm or suicide, but does include associated materials or methods.\n\nMosseri met with the UK\u2019s health secretary earlier this year to discuss how Instagram deals with self-harm content. Instagram has faced pressure in the UK to make changes following a public outcry after a 14-year-old schoolgirl committed suicide after viewing suicide content on Instagram. Facebook announced that it would be prohibiting self-harm related images such as those that depict cutting, and would be restricting access to photos and videos of healed scars by not recommending it in searches.\n\nInstagram stated that it has doubled the amount of self-harm related content that it has acted on following the policy change with Mosseri stating that in the three months following the ban on graphic images of cutting it has \u201cremoved, reduced the visibility of, or added sensitivity screens to more than 834,000 pieces of content.\u201d\n\nMosseri told BBC News: \u201cIt will take time to fully implement. It\u2019s not going to be the last step we take.\u201d Mosseri stated in the blog post that the new policy is \u201cbased on expert advice from academics and mental health organizations like the Samaritans in the UK and National Suicide Prevention Line in the US\u201d, saying: \u201cWe aim to strike the difficult balance between allowing people to share their mental health experiences while also protecting others from being exposed to potentially harmful content.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cAccounts sharing this type of content will also not be recommended in search or in our discovery surfaces, like Explore. And we\u2019ll send more people more resources with localized helplines like the Samaritans and PAPYRUS in the UK or the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and The Trevor Project in the United States.\u201d\n\nMosseri stated that the issues are complex and \u201cno single company or set of policies and practices alone can solve.\u201d Mosseri adds: \u201cBut getting our approach right requires more than a single change to our policies or a one-time update to our technology. Our work here is never done. Our policies and technology have to evolve as new trends emerge and behaviors change.\u201d\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
