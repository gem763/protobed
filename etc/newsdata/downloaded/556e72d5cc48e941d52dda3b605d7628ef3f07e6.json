This means you can\u2019t share your screenshots and trophies with your Facebook friends from your console, as well as a few other limitations that, though minor, are annoying.\n\nAs Sony points out in their article on the issue, \u201cFacebook will no longer be offered as a destination to share screenshots, videos, music, trophy details, or links to gameplay broadcasts.\u201d You also won\u2019t be able to link your Facebook friends to your PS4 account. If you\u2019re using a picture from Facebook as your profile, you\u2019ll have to change that too.\n\nWebsite VG247 points out that this could be related to changes Facebook made to data sharing following the Cambridge Analytica scandal.\n\nIn a news post from July, Facebook wrote that it would \u201cimmediately\u201d be ending PlayStation\u2019s \u201caccess to friend data.\u201d Perhaps \u201cimmediately\u201d is... now?\n\nA spokesperson for Facebook provided the following statement: \u201cWe\u2019re working with Sony to finalise an updated contract designed to improve the Facebook integration on PlayStation. While these discussions are in progress, Facebook features will not be available on PlayStation 4. We hope to bring these features back as soon as our teams reach agreement.\u201d)\n\nI mainly use Facebook on my PlayStation to send screenshots to myself for work. It was a nice feature to have. At least no one can spam their trophies at you anymore.\n\nKotaku has also reached out to Sony for further comment.", "description": "Starting today, the PlayStation 4 will no longer support Facebook integration.
