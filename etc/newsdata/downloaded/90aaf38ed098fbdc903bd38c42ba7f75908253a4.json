In his shop alone, he sells the gun from about 30 different manufacturers.\n\nColt said its decision to stop selling the gun to civilians was driven by the market.\n\n\"The fact of the matter is that over the last few years, the market for modern sporting rifles has experienced significant excess manufacturing capacity. Given this level of manufacturing capacity, we believe there is adequate supply for modern sporting rifles for the foreseeable future,\" President and CEO of Colt Dennis Veilleux said in a statement Thursday.\n\nWhile sales of the rifle usually go up after mass shootings because policymakers say they will consider greater restrictions, that hasn't been the case under the Trump administration, said Timothy Lytton, an associate dean at Georgia State University and author of the book \"Suing the Gun Industry.\"\n\n\"If we see a new administration, that is likely to advance an agenda that includes further gun control measures ... you're likely to see a spike in the demand,\" Lytton said.", "description": "Gun maker Colt announced Thursday that it will halt its production of AR-15 rifles for civilian sales, but the news might not be as exciting for gun control advocates as it first appears.
