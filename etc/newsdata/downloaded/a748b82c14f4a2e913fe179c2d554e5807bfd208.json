Let's take a look at the permutations.\n\nHamilton has six wins in 2019\n\nThe Mercedes driver currently leads the drivers' championship by 73 points ahead of team mate Valtteri Bottas and 103 points in front of Ferrari's Charles Leclerc.\n\nAfter Hamilton's win in Sochi at the end of September, there are 130 points left from five races to score. If Hamilton wins in Suzuka on Sunday, he will dismiss all the drivers except Bottas from the title race.\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember, Hamilton cannot be crowned champion in the land of the rising sun, but with six wins (more than any other driver) already this season he cannot be beaten if he ties on points with another driver at the end of the season.\n\nFor Hamilton to claim the title in Mexico on October 27, he will need to be 78 points clear of his closest rival at the end of the weekend, which translates into an increase of five points or more over the next two races.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMercedes' 1-2 win in Sochi propelled the British-based team to 571 points in the constructors' standings, 162 ahead of Ferrari.\n\nMercedes can claim the championship if they score 14 more points than Ferrari in Japan this weekend with four races left.", "description": "Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton can't wrap up his sixth Formula 1 world title in Suzuka this weekend, however he can help Mercedes win their sixth consecutive constructors' title.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9447/ee247b296dca408f93332226f22d50b1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
