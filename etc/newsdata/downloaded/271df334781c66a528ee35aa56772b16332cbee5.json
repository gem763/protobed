Speaking Thursday at a news conference, Mulvaney essentially acknowledged a quid pro quo with Ukraine that Trump has long denied, saying U.S. aid was withheld from Kyiv to push for an investigation of the Democratic National Committee and the 2016 election. He later clarified his remarks.\n\nTrump appeared satisfied with Mulvaney's clarification and the president dismissed the entire House inquiry as \"a terrible witch hunt. This is so bad for our country.\"\n\nBut former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who ran against Trump in the 2016 Republican primary, said he now supports impeaching the president.\n\nMulvaney's admission, he said, was the \"final straw.\" ''The last 24 hours has really forced me to review all of this,\" Kasich said on CNN.\n\nIn Congress, at least one Republican, Rep. Francis Rooney of Florida, spoke out publicly, telling reporters that he and others were concerned by Mulvaney's remarks. Rooney said he's open to considering all sides in the impeachment inquiry. He also said Mulvaney's comments cannot simply undone by a follow-up statement.\n\n\"It's not an Etch-A-Sketch,\" said Rooney, a former ambassador to the Holy See under President George W. Bush.\n\n\"The only thing I can assume is, he meant what he had to say \u2014 that there was a quid pro quo on this stuff,\" he said.\n\nThe tumult over Mulvaney's remarks capped a momentous week in the impeachment investigation as the admission, from highest levels of the administration, undercut the White House defense and pushed more evidence into the inquiry.\n\nGOP leaders tried to contain the fallout. But four weeks into the inquiry, the events around Trump's interaction with the Ukraine president, which are are at the heart of impeachment, have upended Washington.\n\nA beloved House chairman, Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., a leading figure in the investigation, died amid ongoing health challenges.\n\nThe Energy Secretary, Rick Perry, who has been caught up in the probe, announced his resignation. On Friday, the Energy Department sent a letter to House committee chairs saying it would not comply with a subpoena for documents and communications.\n\nThe march toward an impeachment vote now seems all but inevitable, so much so that the highest-ranking Republican, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, privately told his GOP colleagues this week to expect action in the House by Thanksgiving with a Senate trial by Christmas.\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi has given no timeline for conclusion but wants the inquiry completed \"expeditiously.\" She said Thursday that facts of the investigation will determine next steps.\n\n\"The timeline will depend on the truth line,\" she told reporters.\n\nThis week's hours of back-to-back closed-door hearings from diplomats and former top aides appeared to be providing investigators with a remarkably consistent account of the run-up and aftermath of Trump's call with Ukraine President Volodymy Zelenskiy.\n\nIn that July call, Trump asked the newly elected Zelenskiy for a \"favor\" in investigating the Democratic National Committee's email situation, which was central to the 2016 election, as well as a Ukraine gas company, Burisma, linked to the family of Trump's 2020 Democratic rival, Joe Biden, according to a rough transcript of the phone conversation released by the White House.\n\nRepublican leaders tried to align with Trump Friday, amid their own mixed messages as House Democrats, who already issued a subpoena to Mulvaney for documents, now want to hear directly from him.\n\nRep. Kevin McCarthy, the House GOP leader, cited Mulvaney's clarification as evidence that there was no quid pro quo. He said witnesses have also testified similarly behind closed doors in the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\"We've been very clear,\" McCarthy said. \"There was no quid pro quo.\"\n\nLawmakers involved in the three House committees conducting the investigation want to hear more next week, which promises another packed schedule of witnesses appearing behind closed doors.", "description": "The shifting White House explanation for President Donald Trump's decision to withhold military aid from Ukraine drew alarm Friday from Republicans as the impeachment inquiry brought a new test of their alliance.
