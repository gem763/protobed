The two fighters first competed against one another at Bellator 165 in November 2016.\n\nThen-champion Chandler and then-challenger Henderson went toe-to-toe for five rounds. In the eyes of all three judges, Chandler did enough to retain his title by unanimous decision.\n\nSince their first collision, Chandler has competed five times, going 3-2. He lost his lightweight title to Brent Primus in June 2017 and regained it in April 2018.\n\nIn his most recent bout at Bellator 221 in May 2019, Chandler once again lost his belt. In a champion vs. champion superfight, Chandler was knocked out by perennial featherweight strapholder Patricio Freire. The bout lasted only 61 seconds, before Chandler ate a barrage of punches which ended the fight.\n\nAs for Henderson, \u201cSmooth\u201d has also competed five times since his first meeting with Chandler. Since he suffered a split decision loss to Patricky Freire at Bellator 183, Henderson has won his four most recent outings.\n\nAt Bellator 227 in September, Henderson defeated fellow UFC veteran Myles Jury by unanimous decision.\n\nBellator Japan takes place Sunday, Dec. 29 at Saitama Super Arena in Tokyo. The main card airs on Paramount network after prelims on MMA Junkie.
