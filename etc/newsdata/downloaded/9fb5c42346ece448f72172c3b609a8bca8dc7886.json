We don\u2019t care, you deserve it.\u2019 Because everybody talked about how you looked or how you dressed or the jokes you made.\u2019\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Megan Fox Confirms Dating Shia LaBeouf & Admits to Spitefully Writing on Brian Austin Green\u2019s Wall\n\nWhile Fox shares feminist ideals, she said she doesn\u2019t feel as though \u201cthere is a space in feminism\u201d for her.\n\n\u201cEven though I consider myself a feminist, I feel like feminists don\u2019t want me to be a part of their group. What is supporting other females if there are only certain ones of us we support?\u201d she said. \u201cIf I have to be an academic or have to be non-threatening to you in some way? Why can\u2019t I be a part of the group as well?\u201d\n\nIt was when Fox became pregnant with her first child, son Noah, with husband Brian Austin Green, that things began to get better for the Transformers actress.\n\n\u201cI think it took getting pregnant \u2014 that was the first real breakthrough where my consciousness shifted and my mind opened up and I was able to see from a birds-eye view and breath and take it in,\u201d Fox explained. \u201cAnd then another kid, and then another kid and with every kid, I feel like that\u2019s always been the doorway into a better version of myself.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Noah, Fox and Green also share two other sons \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd Bodhi, 5, and Journey, 3.\n\nView photos Megan Fox in Jennifer's Body | Moviestore/Shutterstock More", "description": "Megan Fox Had a Psychological Breakdown After Jennifer's Body", "authors": ["Alexia Fernandez"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Lpr6go1LF0ZdKYic7JQVzg--~B/aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/267c8115aa7262d51174609f39b47cb4", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
