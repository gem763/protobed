Critics charged that Trump abandoned Syrian Kurdish allies who had lost hundreds of fighters while helping beat back the extremist group.\n\nTurkey regards the Kurdish-led militias in Syria as a security threat because of their links to a Kurdish militant group that has fought a decades-long insurgency inside Turkey.\n\nA cease-fire agreement reached by the United States and the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Thursday committed Turkey to a five-day pause in the offensive to allow the Syrian-Kurdish fighters to withdraw from a \u201csafe zone\u201d in northeastern Syria.\n\nBoth Turkey and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have accused each other of violating the cease-fire\u2019s terms, while U.S. officials have said the truce is generally holding.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs part of the ongoing U.S. withdrawal, a convoy of dozens of vehicles left Syria on Monday, most flying large American flags. Videos that circulated online showed some residents in northern Syria heckling the soldiers and pelting vehicles with objects, said to be rocks and rotten vegetables.\n\nTrump has defended the withdrawal as part of his overarching pledge to stop U.S. involvement in \u201cendless wars\u201d in the Middle East.\n\nBut that pledge has come with significant caveats. The Pentagon announced earlier this month that it was sending 1,800 additional troops to Saudi Arabia after attacks on two oil facilities there that the United States has blamed on Iran.\n\nAD\n\nThe proposal to keep securing oil fields in Syria, indefinitely, could rely on a force of about 200 U.S. troops in eastern Syria, a U.S. official said. It was intended to deter not only the Islamic State from profiting from the oil, the official said, but also Syria\u2019s own government, which is steadily recovering territory it lost during the civil war as it advances with backing from Russia and Iran.\n\nAD\n\nTrump hinted at the plans two days ago, when he wrote on Twitter that \u201cwe have secured the oil,\u201d without providing more detail. On Sunday, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said on the Fox News Channel that the United States was going to \u201cdeny the oil fields falling into Iranian hands.\u201d\n\nGraham, a Trump ally who had criticized the administration for its handling of the Turkish offensive, said he was \u201cincreasingly optimistic it could turn out well.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe big thing for me is the oil fields,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe we are on the verge of a joint venture between us and the Syrian Democratic Forces, who helped destroy ISIS and keep them destroyed, to modernize the oil fields and make sure they get the revenue, not the Iranians, not Assad.\u201d\n\nGeorge reported from Kabul.
