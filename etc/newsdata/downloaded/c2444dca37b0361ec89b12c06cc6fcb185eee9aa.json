The company said it is \u201ctaking the necessary steps and measures so that no similar incident[s] will happen again in the future.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe quality and safety of our products, as well as the welfare of our consumers, are our top priorities. Rest assured that we are doing our (sic) best we could to serve our customers with the best quality products and services,\u201d it added.\n\nThe controversial video first appeared last night when it was shared by several Facebook accounts. It shows a man wearing a red Gardenia shirt stealing slices of bread from at least four bags of loaves. After committing the act, he closes each bag then returns them to the crate where he took them from.\n\nThe dude is like the local version of Jean Valjean, without the singing.\n\nWatch the video below to see how he pulled it off.\n\nIn a follow-up statement that appeared just this afternoon, Gardenia said the loaves of bread inside the truck were unsold products that were taken from stores which were going to be brought back to its plant. They clarified that they were not new products that were going to be delivered to bakeries.\n\n\u201cThe personnel involved is now undergoing [an] administrative due process,\u201d Gardenia added.\n\nThing is, plenty of Filipinos just feel plain bad for the guy. After all, how bad off to you need to be to steal bread one slice at a time?\n\nPosting on Gardenia\u2019s Facebook account, Jel Runkle wrote, \u201cWhile we are very disgusted with these acts, and we are definitely with you in improving your packaging, logistics, [the] safety of consumers, etc.to gain our trust again. Please be mindful also that these men are just hungry and trying to feed their families. Please at least try to give them reasonable punishment that will not cost them their livelihood.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Gardenia/FB More\n\nOthers however were all too happy to play Javert in this little morality tale.\n\n\u201cA person should never resort to any crime despite their situation. Think again,\u201d Rasil Aquino wrote.\n\nPhoto: Gardenia/FB More\n\nMeanwhile, Froiland Steve said there\u2019s more to this issue than just theft.\n\n\u201cDo you even understand the severity of the effects of his actions?\u201d he asked Runkle. \u201cNot only to the company but to the health of its consumers. Now they have to endure losses, they have to change their packaging and review different processes from manufacturing to logistics. Do you even understand the possible diseases this may cause?\u201d\n\nPhoto: Gardenia/FB More\n\nOthers, however, suggested the company should be properly sealing their products to avoid tampering. \u201cYou should have sealed well your products,\u201d wrote Rene Austria.\n\nPhoto: Gardenia/FB More\n\nShould this man be punished?
