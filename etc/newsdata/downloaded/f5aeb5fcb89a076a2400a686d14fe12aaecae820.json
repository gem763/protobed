In many countries, such as Mexico, sugary drinks are more accessible than potable water which is increasingly scarce.\n\nThe fear of losing investment also plays a role in states' hesitation to implement certain tougher regulations, according to Ralston.\n\n\"Just like the climate crisis, we are witnessing a critical failure of government to respect and protect our children's rights to good health now and into the future. Both global heating and childhood obesity are suffering from a lack of government leadership, and a hostile commercial environment resisting change,\" she said.\n\n\"We know we can do better, and we must.\"", "description": "Experts say that not a single country is on track to meet targets for tackling childhood obesity.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/3/e9db2fa9ac5b4c6daa25ff97fa2b32ee_18.jpg"}
