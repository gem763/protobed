That's why we wrote this book.\"\n\nJulia Khaled is thrilled that people can now borrow a book inspired by her from the library. (Mirna Khaled/Facebook)\n\nJulia, who has cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair, wasn't always able to find picture books with characters that looked like her.\n\nAfter the family arrived in Canada in 2015, Julia began attending school alongside her twin brother Jalal. That was already a big change from the situation she had faced back in Lebanon, where schools wouldn't accept her because of her wheelchair.\n\nIn Lebanon, Julia's mother Mirna Khaled worked as an assistant principal, and Jalal attended school. Every morning, they had to leave Julia behind, \"in the house with my mom, crying and feeling so bad because she's not going to school with other kids,\" said Mirna\n\n\"That was really hard on me, on her, and on us as a family.\"\n\nMirna Khaled hopes Julia and Bella will encourage people to be more accepting of children with special needs.\n\nBut even after Julia had started school in Canada, she still didn't see herself in the books she was able to find at the library.\n\n\"It's really hard to see that our kids are not represented,\" said Mirna. \"We are part of the community, right?\"\n\nMirna said it's important that children with special needs are represented in art and media. So she and her sister wrote and illustrated a children's book inspired by Julia, titled Julia and Bella.\n\nThe book tells the story of two friends, one of whom, Julia, is in a wheelchair. After a bully takes Julia's headband, Bella helps her get a new one. Mirna hopes the book will encourage people to be more accepting of people with special needs.\n\n\"This is what the book says, that each person is beautiful in their way.\"\n\nJulia Khaled hopes the book will help people better understand children with special needs. \"I want people to know about cerebral palsy and that it\u2019s okay to be in a wheelchair.\" ( Andrew Friesen/CBC)\n\nSharing the book through the library\n\nJulia said being able to see herself represented in a book has been a special experience. \"My heart shines up when I see myself,\" she said.\n\nJulia and Bella is now available at libraries across Calgary, including the city's new central library. \"It's amazing to have my book in the library,\" said Julia.\n\nEven after having helped put out a book, Julia's not done. Julia and her brother Jalal \"have lots of new ideas,\" said Mirna.\n\nTo find out what Julia's next project might be, readers will just have to keep their eyes on the library shelves.\n\nOriginally aired in April 2019", "description": "9-year-old Julia Khaled couldn't find any kids books about wheelchair users like herself.
