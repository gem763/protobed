In any group, you cannot say the whole group is poisoned.\"\n\nShe compared it to the recent #MenAreTrash conversation, which reared its head again in public discourse and social media following the tragic deaths of Uyinene Mrwetyana, Jesse Hess, and other young women last month.\n\n\"Even with it, I say not all men are trash,\" Madonsela said.\n\n'Toxic masculinity', student debt\n\nOn toxic masculinity, although not defining it, she reasoned that it could be a determining factor when assessing social justice ills.\n\n\"The world is distorted because of the devaluing of certain people. Patriarchy has been at the core of devaluing people.\"\n\nMadonsela, before \"sipping tea\", concluded by speaking about how she felt her generation had \"failed to level the playing fields\" at universities.\n\nShe bemoaned higher education issues such as student and historical debt.\n\n\"Why do we have a society where people can be at university and fall through the cracks purely because of poverty?\n\n\"Education is a major determinant of poverty,\" Madonsela told Zille.\n\nShe said that, before the end of the year, she was planning on climbing the Drakensberg to raise funds that dealt specifically with the historical debt that students were burdened with.\n\nWatch to the full podcast here:\n\n- Compiled by Kamva Somdyala", "description": "In the latest installment of Tea with Helen, Helen Zille and Thuli Madonsela touch on a range of topics that include corruption, land, social justice and race.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7091/3d0332acaafa4bd8ad775a0346e117ce.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
