I always worry a little bit when you come out of a big game which is easy to get up for and a reaction was needed, when you say 'I was proud of my players today' because you need to be proud of your players every single week.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"You couldn't be more confident going into the game against Norwich than you were against Liverpool.\n\n\" Manchester United have let you down this season. West Ham , Southampton , other games of this nature where they've been really poor.\n\n\"Can those players get up for those games, can they break teams down who defend deep and counter-attack on them?\"\n\nCarragher fears United's lack of a goal threat will see them miss out on a top-six spot.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nThe former Liverpool defender was speaking ahead of Leicester's stunning 9-0 demolition of Southampton, which fired the Foxes up to second in the Premier League table and confirmed their intent to upset the traditional big guns this season.\n\nUnited finished sixth last season after their form nosedived towards the end of the campaign, and Carragher said: \"I don't think they'll get top four.\n\n\"When we're talking about Leicester getting top six and we're not quite sure who will miss out, certainly Man United will be one of the big candidates of the top six to miss out, with Leicester going strong.\n\n(Image: Manchester United via Getty Imag)\n\n\"I think it was promising last week for Manchester United, I think first-half they were excellent. But you can't play like that against the majority of teams they come up against.\n\n\"Actually seeing Manchester United in the next couple of games against Norwich and Bournemouth , they're tests for Manchester United - are they good enough to go and open those teams up?\n\n\"They have a massive problem, they can't score more than one goal in a game.\"", "description": "With rampant Leicester looking to upset the traditional big guns, United look most likely to drop out of top six", "authors": ["Gareth Bicknell", "Image", "Pa", "Getty Images", "Manchester United Via Getty Imag"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article18994595.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Manchester-City-v-Liverpool-Premier-League-Etihad-Stadium.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
