(AP) - A bill expected to be introduced during the 2020 legislative session could end greyhound racing in West Virginia.\n\nNews outlets report Republican Senate President Mitch Carmichael released an opinion piece Tuesday calling for an end to the practice. He\u2019s now facing opposition from some state delegates.\n\nThe Parkersburg News and Sentinel reports the casinos make video lottery payments of about $15 million each year to the West Virginia Lottery Commission. The lottery commission transfers the money into purse accounts at the casinos and the racing commission.\n\nCarmichael says the money subsidizes the greyhound industry, but could be better invested in roads and education.\n\nDemocratic Delegate Shawn Fluharty says the money doesn\u2019t come from taxpayer dollars. He says ending greyhound racing would eliminate as many as 1,700 jobs in West Virginia.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A bill expected to be introduced during the 2020 legislative session could end greyhound racing in West Virginia.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
