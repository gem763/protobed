It was accepted because Facebook does not submit ads from politicians for third-party fact checking.\n\nThe ad, which ran on Facebook in a few different variations, claimed that \"Joe Biden promised Ukraine $1 billion dollars if they fired the prosecutor investigating his son's company,\" according to Facebook's ads library.\n\nOne version of the Trump ad including a debunked claim about Biden. Facebook Ads Library\n\nTwo of Facebook's fact-checking partners \u2014 PolitiFact and Factcheck.org \u2014 had previously debunked this claim.\n\nIn its misinformation policy for ads, Facebook says that it \"prohibits ads that include claims debunked by third-party fact checkers or, in certain circumstances, claims debunked by organizations with particular expertise.\"\n\nHowever, a Facebook spokesperson told Business Insider that ads from politicians are not eligible for third-party fact-checking review. Nick Clegg, Facebook's VP of Global Affairs and Communications, publicly announced these policies in a Facebook blog post on Sep. 24.\n\nIn total, the Trump campaign spent over $1.6 million on Facebook ads from Sep. 25 to Oct. 1, according to Facebook's ads library (comparatively, Elizabeth Warren spent $285,000 and Biden spent $122,000 in the same period).\n\nOn Monday night, Warren challenged Facebook on the suspicious timing of its misinformation policies, calling into question a private meeting between Trump and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Sep. 19.\n\nWarren cited Judd Legum's reporting on Popular Information, which asserts that Facebook had recently changed its advertising policies on misinformation, thereby allowing Trump to lie in ads.\n\nBut according to Facebook, its policies have not changed, and political figures have been exempt from the fact-checking process for more than a year now, depicted in its eligibility guidelines. Clegg's speech summarized as much:\n\n\"We don't believe that it's an appropriate role for us to referee political debates and prevent a politician's speech from reaching its audience and being subject to public debate and scrutiny. That's why Facebook exempts politicians from our third-party fact-checking program. We have had this policy on the books for over a year now, posted publicly on our site under our eligibility guidelines. This means that we will not send organic content or ads from politicians to our third-party fact-checking partners for review.\"\n\nHowever, it is true that Facebook recently changed the wording of its misinformation policy \u2014 instead of \"Misinformation,\" section 13 was previously titled \"Misleading or False Content\" and largely governed deceptive claims and business practices.\n\nFacebook has moved this down to section 31 and 32 of its policies, which are now titled \"Misleading Claims\" and \"Unacceptable Business Practices.\" It appears that Facebook is trying to delineate more specifically between misinformation in a public interest capacity, and misleading content in a business capacity.\n\nA Facebook spokesperson told Business Insider that these recent announcements and policy tweaks are meant to provide transparency ahead of US and global elections.\n\nWith Trump ratcheting up his Facebook ad spending and deceitful rhetoric, the platform's policy decisions will continue to be scrutinized. And while Facebook believes it is staying impartial by doing little to regulate political speech, it may actually be helping Trump in doing so.\n\nFacebook does not have an envious position. Its policies are complex and difficult to understand, with countless rules and separate exceptions for advertising, original content, fact-checking, and more.\n\nWhen Facebook doesn't regulate political speech, it disregards truth and responsibility. But if Facebook did regulate political speech, it would have to devise even more complex policies, and there would be widespread complaints of bias \u2014 something it clearly does not want to deal with.\n\nFor now, Facebook is sticking to the former. This choice has resulted in a stunning truth: the Trump campaign is paying Facebook millions of dollars to promote its lies, and this doesn't violate any of Facebook's rules.", "description": "Facebook's policies have come under scrutiny as the Trump campaign spends millions on misleading or false ads.
