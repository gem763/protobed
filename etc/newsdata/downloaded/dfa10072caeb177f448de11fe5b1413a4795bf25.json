My father was given a tablet that was found over a year ago. We left it with lost and found and it was given back to us after the reclaim period ended. The find my phone machine feature was not disabled of course and my father contacted apple hoping they would be able to use that feature to get the device back to its owner. He was upset that apple would not contact its owner because of \u201cprivacy\u201d issues. He felt they were cornering the owner into buying a new device instead of contacting them that someone had found their device. It\u2019s now just sitting in his home unused. Is there a way he can get it up and running for himself?\n\nLet\u2019s get the bad news out of the way. If you\u2019re staring at an Activation Lock, you\u2019re stuck. Apple isn\u2019t going to remove this for you, nor do you have any way to do this yourself. You would have to contact the original owner of the device\u2014which it seems like you\u2019re unable to do\u2014to have them enter their Apple ID/password or passcode on the iPad, or erase and remove the iPad from their iCloud account.\n\nTo be succinct, activation lock = bad. You are now the proud owner of an expensive paperweight, not a tablet.\n\nAnd, no, booting your iPad into recovery mode and attempting to reset it by connecting it to a Mac isn\u2019t going to help. You\u2019ll still see the Activation Lock screen when you try to set up your iPad, because that\u2019s tied into Apple\u2019s Find My feature.\n\nOn the plus side, this is at least encouraging for those who own devices that have been lost and/or stolen. With Find My activated, an attacker is only going to be able to use the iPhone for parts\u2014nothing more. That doesn\u2019t get you your device back, I realise, but hopefully it\u2019s at least some kind of deterrent for a potential iPhone or iPad thief.\n\nAs for Apple\u2019s reluctance to unlock your device, disable Activation Lock, or even tell you the contact information for the device\u2019s previous owner, that\u2019s all to be expected. While you\u2019re simply trying to gain access to a device that\u2019s clearly been lost for some time\u2014and likely forgotten\u2014Apple has no way of verifying your story.\n\nConsider the alternative. Suppose you recently lost your iPhone and someone had picked it up, either as an innocent purchasing it from someone who stole it from you, or something they found and decided to keep (if they had no way of contacting you). Or, worse, suppose someone just stole your iPhone out of your hands.\n\nWould you want this thief to be able to hit up any ol\u2019 Apple store and eradicate your only security measure\u2014Find My\u2014with a simple story? Again, I realise that most iPhone thieves nowadays are probably just selling the devices for parts (or hoping you haven\u2019t turned Find My on), but I do think it\u2019s at least a slight setback to some would-be attackers to know that a device they\u2019re targeting will be little more than a brick, assuming they lack the technical know-how to disassemble it.\n\nSimilarly, I would not want a company to cough up personal information about me\u2014my email, my phone number, or any other method to reach me\u2014simply because someone found (or stole) my phone. While I realise that means I\u2019m shutting the door on a potential recovery option, I feel a lot better knowing that I can just use Find My to provide that information by marking my device as lost, rather than worrying that Apple is going to give a thief even more details about me.\n\nIn a perfect world, you\u2019d be able to report a device as lost or stolen to Apple, which could be a way to give Apple permission to provide some means to contact you if a device was taken in to an Apple Store. That\u2019s getting a bit nitpicky, though; and, again, you can always report a device as lost yourself via Find My. Apple, rightly so, probably prefers not to get involved as much as possible, lest it find itself in some tricky grey areas over who technically owns a missing device\u2014especially if a second person purchased a device that was previously reported as missing. Yikes.\n\nSpeaking of, this is exactly why it is critical that you verify \u201cFind My\u201d is turned off whenever your purchasing a secondhand iPhone or iPad. Apple could not be any clearer about this, and for good reason; if you buy a device with the activation lock still turned on, you won\u2019t be able to do anything with it when you go to reset it and set it up with your account credentials.\n\nWhile this answer doesn\u2019t provide you the outcome you were looking for, I hope it at least explains a bit why the iPad you found is probably useless at this point. That\u2019s a bummer for you, but think of the bright side\u2014you didn\u2019t lose an expensive tablet you paid for. Rather, you simply can\u2019t use an expensive tablet you found.", "description": "Apple\u2019s \u201cFind My\u201d feature can be a powerful tool for recovering lost or stolen devices.
