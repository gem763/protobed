The whistleblower complaint\n\n\"In the course of my official duties, I have received information from multiple U.S. Government officials that the President of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election. This interference includes, among other things, pressuring a foreign country to investigate one of the President's main domestic political rivals. The President's personal lawyer, Mr. Rudolph Giuliani, is a central figure in this effort. Attorney General Barr appears to be involved as well.\"\n\nSo begins a 9-page document \u2014 much, but not all of which has subsequently been substantiated. Read it.\n\nThe whistleblower alleges White House officials restricted access to records of the July call for political reasons \u2014 and had taken similar extreme measures with previous calls.\n\nHe describes efforts by Giuliani to secure Ukrainian cooperation in investigating the Bidens, and by Volker and Sondland to help the Ukrainians \"navigate\" Trump's demands.\n\nHe draws a line between Trump's suspension of military aid and pressure on Zelensky to \"play ball\" with the investigations.\n\n2. The Trump-Zelensky call memo:\n\n\"[W]e are almost ready to buy more Javelins [missiles] from the United States for defense purposes.\"\n\n\u2014 Zelensky\n\n\"I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it.\"\n\n\u2014 Trump\n\nThat's the most hotly debated portion of a 5-page partial transcript of the July call. Read the memo.\n\nTrump's accusers claim that in that exchange, he's directly linking the delivery of sorely needed military aid with politically motivated investigations.\n\nTrump has repeatedly described the call as \"perfect.\"\n\n3. The text messages:\n\n\"As I said on the phone, I think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\"\n\n\u2014 Bill Taylor, on Sept. 9\n\n\"Bill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump\u2019s intentions. The President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind. The President is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelensky promised during his campaign I suggest we stop the back and forth by text.\"\n\n\u2014 Gordon Sondland, in response\n\nThe text messages released by Volker show him and Sondland working with Giuliani to secure Ukrainian commitments to pursue the investigations Trump wants. Read the texts.\n\nHours before the Trump-Zelensky call, Volker tells Yermak he's been told by the White House that Zelensky must convince Trump \"he will investigate / 'get to the bottom of what happened' in 2016\" \u2014 before securing a White House invitation.\n\nTaylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, is a recurring voice of concern.\n\nHe threatens to resign in one text and in another asks, \"Are we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?\"\n\nThe Wall Street Journal and others have reported that before denying to Taylor via text that there is a quid pro quo, Sondland phoned Trump directly.\n\nThe big picture: Everyone agrees that Trump pressed Zelensky to investigate the Bidens and matters relating to the 2016 election.\n\nTrump and his allies paint that as part of an effort to encourage Ukraine to root out corruption. They also claim the whistleblower was politically motivated.\n\nDemocrats who consider this grounds for impeachment claim Trump betrayed America\u2019s interests and sold out Ukraine to further his own political aims.\n\nThe latest headlines", "description": "What we know so far and where this scandal is heading.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/_00Ikn8QcEtAK13FMH2OhPkwIb4=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/10/08/1570563309390.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
