And then a couple of months later when I was six months pregnant and it was pretty obvious, the principal called me in, wished me luck, and said he was going to hire someone else for the job.\n\n'All I know is I was 22 years old, I was 6 months pregnant, and the job that I had been promised for the next year was going to someone else. The principal said they were going to hire someone else for my job.\n\n'When someone calls you in and says the job that you've been hired for for the next year is no longer yours. ''We're giving it to someone else'', I think that's being shown the door.'\n\nWarren's resignation was 'accepted with regret' by the school bard, according to documents that recently emerged\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren speaking in SEIU Unions For All Summit last Friday. She has claimed on the campaign trail she was left go from a previous teaching job because she was pregnant\n\nLocal newspaper reports from 1971 stated Warren was 'leaving to raise a family' and that she had 'resigned for personal reasons', despite being offered her speech pathology role for another school year.\n\nIn other accounts Warren gave to news outlets in 2007 and in an interview at the University of California, Berkeley, Warren said she left the school due to not having the right certificates and decided to not go back to teaching after returning to graduate school.\n\nAsked by CBS News why she gave a different account at Berkeley more than a decade ago, Warren said her life since her election to the Senate in 2012 caused her to 'open up' about her past and led her to write a book about her journey through teaching and politics.\n\nIn her 2014 memoir, A Fighting Chance, published after she became a Massachusetts senator, Warren gave a similar account of her departure from Riverdale Elementary.\n\nThe revelations come as Warren's campaign has been boosted by polls showing her popularity has surged to become neck and neck with former vice president Joe Biden.", "description": "Democrat presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren previously stated she was 'shown the door' from her job at a New Jersey primary school in the early 1970s because she was 'visibly pregnant'.", "authors": ["Chris Dyer For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/09/19434016-0-image-a-2_1570524216915.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
