The pound GBPUSD, -0.2481% \u2014 which in recent months has reliably moved in diametric opposition to Johnson\u2019s political fortunes \u2014 made gains, rising 0.48%. The FTSE 100 UKX, -0.47% declined 0.5%.\n\nMarkets\u2019 subdued response reflects a lack of certainty, investors said. The Supreme Court\u2019s ruling provides a dramatic political rebuke for Johnson, and significant cheer for his opponents, but its ultimate effect on how, when and whether Brexit takes place is at best unclear.\n\nHere, we take a look at some possible scenarios for what happens next:\n\nParliament returns\n\nMost immediately, the U.K. Parliament will now reconvene. It is now due to return on Wednesday, the BBC reported, just a day after the Supreme Court judgment was handed down.\n\nThis creates political headaches for Johnson \u2014 ones he had sought to avoid via the suspension\u2014because his government has lost its majority in Parliament.\n\nFollowing his ouster of 21 pro-EU rebels from the Conservative Party in early September, Johnson\u2019s government has a majority of minus-43. Johnson has lost every parliamentary vote he has staged since he became prime minister on July 24.\n\nThe Conservative rebels are now likely to team up with opposition parties to cause maximum pain and embarrassment for the government over its handling of Brexit \u2014 which is still due to take place by Oct. 31.\n\nAn indication came in the final hours before the legislature was suspended, or prorogued, on Sept. 10. Leading Conservative rebel Dominic Grieve successfully passed a measure calling for the publication of the government\u2019s internal contingency-planning documents for a disorderly break with the European Union, revealing the extent of the disruption to trade and the economy.\n\nThe nightmare for Johnson could be that Parliament\u2019s fractious gaggle of opposition groups \u2014 ranging from Labour, to the rebel Conservatives, to a host of smaller parties and independent MPs \u2014 now put together a stable working relationship to inflict further defeats.\n\nCould Johnson just suspend Parliament again?\n\nSome have speculated he will try to do exactly this, but, while the Supreme Court ruling doesn\u2019t make that impossible, it does make it difficult.\n\nThe U.K.\u2019s Parliament is usually suspended for a period of a few days each year for administrative purposes. It is this traditional procedure Johnson stood accused of abusing, by using it to shut down the legislature for five weeks ahead of the Brexit deadline.\n\nSo the judges weren\u2019t able to declare that governments can\u2019t ever prorogue Parliament. That leaves a legal door open for Johnson to try again, by the book this time.\n\nThe problem is that having tried and failed once, he can be sure of intense scrutiny. According to Charles Brastred, a partner at the law firm Hogan Lovells, Johnson \u201cwould have to give cogent and lawful reasons for doing so, and it is unlikely that it could be of anything like the length previously intended.\u201d\n\nParliament cannot prevent its own prorogation, but it could, for example, pass a motion calling on the queen not to allow it.\n\nThe first unwritten article of Britain\u2019s famously unwritten constitution is \u201cdon\u2019t involve the queen in political controversy.\u201d Asking the monarch for a second nonroutine suspension \u2014 in the face of the Supreme Court ruling \u2014 would fail that test, to put it mildly. Her majesty\u2019s advisers might privately express a strong wish that such a request not be made at all.\n\nWill Parliament bring down Johnson\u2019s government?\n\nIn the wake of the Supreme Court decision, Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, called on Johnson to \u201cconsider his position.\u201d But as several commentators pointed out, if Corbyn aims to oust Johnson, he now has a simple way of doing it: calling a vote of no confidence.\n\nIf Johnson lost that, his government would fall. But, despite its lack of a majority, it is not certain that he would lose. It is an open question what the Conservative rebels sacked by Johnson would do, in particular.\n\nCorbyn has said he only wants to call a vote if he can be reasonably confident of winning it. And even if he decided to go all-out for a U.K. general election, he has to convince all the other opposition parties and former Conservatives.\n\nThe problem with that is the looming Brexit deadline. If Parliament \u2014 and the judges \u2014 couldn't stomach the idea of suspending the legislature during Brexit, what are the chances they will agree to dissolve it for an election during Brexit?\n\nCorbyn has said that now that Parliament is returning, he will hold talks with his fellow opposition leaders on the way forward. It is unlikely they will all agree to bring Johnson down, unless they can pull off something unlikely and almost unprecedented \u2014 of which more below.\n\nSo where does all this leave Brexit?\n\nThe short answer is that it leaves much where we were before \u2014 except with Parliament sitting, and with more opportunity to make mischief and inflict defeats upon the government.\n\nBut Johnson is likely to remain in place as prime minister up until Oct. 31, in charge of negotiating with the EU and attempting to deliver an exit package that a majority of Parliament will vote for, by that date.\n\nSigns of progress on that front haven't been encouraging, with EU leaders insisting they don\u2019t like Johnson\u2019s ideas so far. Preparations for a disruptive U.K.-EU breach continue apace.\n\nOne of Parliament\u2019s last acts before the suspension early this month was to pass a new law mandating Johnson to ask the EU for another extension of the Brexit deadline, if he doesn\u2019t secure a deal. Johnson is adamant he won\u2019t, but he also says he will respect the law.\n\nJohnson may have some clever stratagem by which those two things can be true, but the opposition seems confident he will either have to break his promise or resign.\n\nAnd if Johnson does go \u2014 either by resignation or ouster \u2014 there is another maneuver the opposition could try.\n\nUnder U.K. law there is a loophole that could give the country a new, non-Johnson government in a matter of days, without an election. If Parliament passes a vote of no-confidence in a prime minister, there is a 14-day grace period during which another prime minister could emerge. His or her only qualification for the role would be that she or he could \u201ccommand a majority in Parliament.\u201d\n\nIn other words, if every single opposition group, plus the Conservative rebels, lined up behind Corbyn \u2014 or a compromise candidate \u2014 the U.K. could see a temporary National Unity Government devoted to halting Johnson and resolving the Brexit impasse one way or another. For example, it could decide to hold a second public vote on whether Brexit is a good idea at all.\n\nAnd Labour is increasingly coming around to the idea of such a vote, under sustained pressure from the smaller Liberal Democrat Party, which has vowed to reverse Brexit altogether.\n\nAt Labour\u2019s annual conference gathering this week, Labour\u2019s shadow Brexit minister, Kier Starmer, said he believes there is \u201ca growing consensus\u201d in Parliament for a second referendum.\n\nThanks to the judges, there are now several extra weeks for that consensus to continue growing.
