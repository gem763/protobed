With fewer than 200 residents on less than 1 sq km, two wind turbines already ensure much of the community\u2019s energy is renewable, and a large proportion of the homes are solar powered. The island produces more energy than it consumes, and stores the excess on a self-contained grid.\n\nGapado is a test case in a bigger project to curb emissions from the entire Jeju province by 2030. It\u2019s a bold plan, especially given the region\u2019s reputation as a tourism hotspot: Gapado lies just off Jejudo, a large tropical getaway with more than 15 million visitors a year.\n\nThough the number of holidaymakers is expected to rise, the tourist-clogged province wants to convert all vehicles and electricity generation to renewable energy by the end of the next decade. That plan, however, says nothing of the carbon emissions caused by planes: the flight route between Jeju International and Seoul Gimpo earned the title of the world\u2019s busiest in 2018, with 76,000 fights to and from Seoul.\n\nA hotel- and airplane-filled hotspot setting such an ambitious environmental goal may sound zealous. But the project, which emphasises renewable energy such as solar and wind, is a crucial one for places like Jeju \u2013 because its future as a destination may depend on it.\n\n\u201cThe effects of climate change, like sea level rise, will impact islands around the world,\u201d says Kass Rohrbach, a deputy director at environmental organisation the Sierra Club.\n\nThese days, \u2018zero-carbon\u2019 projects \u2013 places trying to decrease the harmful carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels \u2013 are common all over the world. They are trying to counteract the 37 gigatonnes of global CO2 emissions that were recorded last year, a number that keeps rising. Plus, this week, a landmark United Nations report warned that global average sea levels could rise up to 1.1m by 2100 \u2013 bad news for islands like Jeju.\n\nThe good news is, though small, Gapado could show the rest of South Korea how sustainability is done. And it\u2019s also all part of a growing global effort.\n\n\u201cTwo countries, Bhutan and Suriname, are already carbon-neutral,\u201d points out Jacob Corvidae, a zero-carbon city expert at the Rocky Mountain Institute, a US clean energy organisation. \u201cWe already have commitments to carbon neutrality that accounts for 16% of the world's GDP. We expect this number to grow dramatically in the next decade.\u201d\n\nSo as other destinations look to do the same, Jeju\u2019s Gapado might well provide a model for a carbon-free future.", "description": "The South Korean holiday province of Jeju needs to find a sustainable energy solution to ensure a thriving future.
