Here\u2019s how to achieve perfection.\n\nThe advice seemed \u201ccounterintuitive,\u201d the reader said.\n\nThis person\u2019s gut was right. The advice is incorrect. I would find me another loan officer.\n\nWhat else is she getting wrong?\n\nBefore I get to why the recommendation is bad, let\u2019s look at the FICO credit-scoring model most used by lenders.\n\nThe basic FICO score ranges from a low of 300 to a high of 850. (There are industry-specific scores that go from 250 to 900.) The two factors that impact your score the most \u2014 up or down \u2014 are your payment history and amounts owed. Understanding payment history is easy. You need to pay your credit accounts on time \u2014 all the time. Late payments can take your score down. In fact, in a recent report, FICO said consumers with a perfect credit score of 850 have no reported history of missed payments.\n\nAD\n\nHaving some late payments won\u2019t necessarily tank your score. FICO looks at how recent and frequent you\u2019re delinquent.\n\nAD\n\nBeing 90 days late is worse than being 30 days late. As each year passes, the late payments have less impact on your score. Most dings will stay on your report for seven years from the date of delinquency. Over time, you can counteract this negative information by staying current with your payments.\n\nFICO also looks at how much debt you have outstanding. The models examine how you manage a mix of credit, such as a mortgage and credit card. Specifically, the model factors in your credit utilization, which is the percentage of amounts owed, compared with your credit limits.\n\nAD\n\nNot all outstanding debts are measured the same. Revolving debts, such as a credit card, typically carry more weight than installment loans, such as an auto loan or mortgage. Consistently paying your revolving account balances off helps improve your score.\n\nAD\n\nLow credit utilization can push you into an excellent credit range. For example, the average revolving utilization for folks with an 850 score is 4.1 percent\n\nYou may have been told that if you keep your utilization below 30 percent, you\u2019re good. But that\u2019s just a benchmark used to discourage overextending yourself. If you want to be like folks with an 850 score, you need to keep your utilization in the single digits for each card and overall.\n\nAD\n\nThe Trump impeachment inquiry is just one more thing for investors to worry about\n\nSo let\u2019s get back to the advice of carrying a credit card balance. I asked real estate expert and columnist Ilyce Glink what she thought of the reader\u2019s case. Glink is the author of \u201c100 Questions Every First-Time Home Buyer Should Ask.\u201d\n\nThis person is \u201cgetting terrible advice,\u201d Glink said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to run a balance to have a higher credit score. Ever.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nGlink says it\u2019s all about on-time payments and how many different types of open lines of credit you have \u2014 car loan, mortgage and student loans, credit cards, etc.\n\nIf you want to get the best mortgage loan deal, here\u2019s how you raise your score, Glink says.\n\n\u25cf Preferably pay off all debts owed at the end of the month. But at least pay your monthly minimums on time.\n\nAD\n\n\u25cf To boost your credit score, make sure you have at least two open credit cards, and pay those off each month. A lender may want to see that the card is active but that just means you\u2019re using it. You don\u2019t have to have a rolling balance.\n\n\u25cf If you have a balance, then don\u2019t use more than 30 percent of your total available credit per card. So, if you have a maximum credit limit of $1,000, don\u2019t run a balance of more than $300.\n\nWhat\u2019s key to a good credit score is handling your debt responsibly \u2014 month after month after month. But as soon as you can, get rid of it, because you don\u2019t need to keep it around like it\u2019s a pet.\n\nReaders may write to Michelle Singletary at The Washington Post, 1301 K St. NW, Washington, D.C. 20071 or michelle.singletary@washpost.com.
