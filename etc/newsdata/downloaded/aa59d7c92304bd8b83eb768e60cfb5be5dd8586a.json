She was the only woman and person of colour in the writers\u2019 room when she was hired on the Office at the age of 24, and claimed that after the show was nominated for an Emmy, the Television Academy told her there were too many names on the producing team \u2013 and made her justify her spot on the list.\n\n\u201cThey made me, not any of the other producers, fill out a whole form and write an essay about all my contributions as a writer and a producer,\u201d she said. \u201cI had to get letters from all the other male, white producers saying that I had contributed, when my actual record stood for itself.\u201d\n\nHow Mindy Kaling\u2019s Late Night exposes TV\u2019s women-less writers rooms Read more\n\nIn a statement to the LA Times, the Academy said that at the time \u201cevery performer producer and writer producer was asked to justify their producer credit,\u201d claiming that \u201cno one person was singled out.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was an increasing concern years ago regarding the number of performers and writers seeking producer credits,\u201d the spokesperson continued. \u201cAt the time the Producers Guild worked with the Television Academy to correctly vet producer eligibility.\u201d\n\nBut on Twitter, Kaling has criticised their response, saying it \u201cdoesn\u2019t make any sense\u201d.\n\n\u201cI *was* singled out. There were other Office writer-performer-producers who were NOT cut from the list. Just me. The most junior person, and woman of colour. Easiest to dismiss. Just sayin\u2019.\u201d\n\nMindy Kaling (@mindykaling) Respectfully, the Academy\u2019s statement doesn\u2019t make any sense. I *was* singled out. There were other Office writer-performer-producers who were NOT cut from the list. Just me. The most junior person, and woman of color. Easiest to dismiss. Just sayin\u2019. https://t.co/frT2pQUfLF\n\nKaling, who has worked on the show throughout its nine-year run as an actor, writer, director and executive producer, did end up getting credited in the category. She said she \u201cnever wanted to bring up that incident because The Office was one of the greatest creative experiences of my life, and who would want to have an adversarial relationship with the academy?\u201d\n\nBut, she said, the incident was \u201chumiliating\u201d after she had worked so hard writing and editing on the show, and \u201cnot mentioning it seemed like glossing over my story\u201d.\n\nMindy Kaling (@mindykaling) I\u2019ve never wanted to bring up that incident because The Office was one of the greatest creative experiences of my life, and who would want to have an adversarial relationship with the Academy, who has the ongoing power to enhance our careers with awards? (1)\n\nMindy Kaling (@mindykaling) (2) But I worked so hard and it was humiliating. I had written so many episodes, put in so much time in the editing room, just to have the Academy discard it because they couldn\u2019t fathom I was capable of doing it all. Thankfully I was rescued by my friends, the other producers.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have [to] be bailed out because of the kindness of more powerful white male colleagues,\u201d she said in a third tweet. \u201cThis was like ten years ago. Maybe it wouldn\u2019t happen now. But it happened to me.\u201d\n\nIn the interview with Elle, Kaling said she has been treated like she didn\u2019t belong in the industry throughout her entire career. She was the first woman of colour to write, star in and create a primetime sitcom, The Mindy Project, but said she had been shouted off the set by a security guard \u2013 despite her face and name being on the billboard she pointed him to.\n\n\u201cIt really doesn\u2019t matter how much money I have,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m treated badly with enough regularity that it keeps me humble.\u201d\n\nWhile she has now embraced her role as a role model, Kaling said that as a woman of colour, she has always been held to a different standard than white producers.\n\n\u201cIt used to frustrate me a lot that I felt way more scrutinised by women and women of colour than white show-runners were on shows with all-white casts,\u201d she said. \u201cI just wanted to be a writer. I didn\u2019t necessarily look at it as being like, \u2018Well, you also have to be a spokesperson.\u2019 That\u2019s not what I signed up for.\u201d\n\nNever Have I Ever, which Kaling co-created, wrote and co-executive produced, is due out on Netflix in 2020.", "description": "Kaling says TV Academy forced her to justify inclusion on team\u2019s production team in nomination for prize", "authors": ["Guardian Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0cf9afebd3734f9f96fb896f32b7aba5c773f29d/0_291_2667_1600/master/2667.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8da211fd06c669e26efeb9797afff6be", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
