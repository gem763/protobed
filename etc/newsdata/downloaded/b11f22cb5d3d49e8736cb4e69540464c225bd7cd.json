This underscores the competition we face, not only in the U.S. but around the globe. We will work constructively with state attorneys general and we welcome a conversation with policymakers about the competitive environment in which we operate.\u201d\n\nLaunched in 2004 as a social networking site exclusively for students of select U.S. colleges, Facebook has swelled over the past 15 years to boast more than 2 billion monthly active users across the platform as of June 2017.\n\nFacebook expanded operations beyond its flagship product in the interim, and the company currently controls two widely popular smartphone messaging apps \u2014 Messenger and WhatsApp \u2014 in addition to the Instagram photo- and video-sharing service it acquired in 2012, among other products.\n\nState attorneys general are not the first antitrust regulators to recently set their sights on Facebook.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee\u2019s subcommittee on antitrust issues announced in June that its members would investigate potential antitrust violations on the part of major tech companies, including Facebook, and has since held related hearings on Capitol Hill.\n\nFacebook confirmed in a quarterly report filed the following month that the company is facing a separate antitrust investigation conducted by the Federal Trade Commission, meanwhile. That disclosure came the same day the FTC announced a $5 billion settlement with Facebook for mishandling user data.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
