If Chrome users ever choose to use a Google account with the Chrome browser and then saved passwords in Chrome, this is the website where those passwords are synced to.\n\nThe passwords.google.com website has been around for a while but has only been known to Chrome power users. But starting today, Google wants all Chrome users to consider it the company's official \"password manager.\"\n\nHere is where they'll be able to see a list of all the passwords they've ever saved in Chrome, and also access the new Password Checkup feature.\n\nTo use the new feature, a new button that says \"Check Passwords\" will be available. Once pressed, Google will take all the user's passwords and check them against an internal database of over four billion user credentials that have been leaked online via breaches at other companies.\n\nIf a username & password combo is found in this database, Google will warn the user that they need to change the password for that account, as they're at risk of having the account hijacked by hackers.\n\nOn Android devices, the Password Checkup feature takes all the account details saved on a device and checks them against the same Google internal database. Users can access Password Checkup on their device via the official \"Google\" Android app.\n\nComing to Chrome later this year\n\nThe Password Checkup feature is based on an eponymously named Chrome extension that Google launched in February, which allowed users to test their locally saved Chrome passwords for any leaked credentials.\n\nBut while the extension worked great, Google also plans to add Password Checkup inside Chrome itself later this year. Currently, the feature is already available in Chrome Canary, the Chrome version where the company tests features before they enter the Chrome Beta and Chrome Stable release cycle.\n\nTo enable Password Checkup in Chrome Canary, users must navigate to the chrome://flags section and enable the \"Password Leak Detection\" feature (chrome://flags/#password-leak-detection).\n\nImage: ZDNet\n\nWhen this feature is enabled, a new option appears in the Chrome Settings panel, in the Passwords section.\n\nThe upcoming Chrome Password Checkup feature won't work unless users have chosen to use a Google account as a Chrome profile.\n\nThis should quench any users' fears that \"Google is scanning Chrome passwords without permission,\" as the feature won't work unless users specifically sign into Chrome with a Google account, and sync passwords.\n\nImage: ZDNet\n\nGoogle's push towards improving password security is part of the company's broader plan of bolstering the security of its entire service.\n\nOnline accounts are all interconnected through thin wires -- namely usernames and passwords. Password reuse can often lead from the compromise of an initial account to hacks at multiple services. Google accounts often sit at the center of this web of personal accounts since most people use a Gmail address to register on most of their online services.\n\nGmail addresses are considered the holy grail of all hacks, since if an attacker compromises one, they can use it to reset passwords at multiple other services.\n\nPassword reuse has been the easiest way through which attackers jump this web of interconnected accounts, in the hopes of hitting the jackpot -- a Google account or an account with access to financial resources.\n\nOne way to prevent this has been to use two-step verification (2SV) or two-factor authentication (2FA) solutions, of which Google has been the main proponent and a driving force over the past few years.\n\nBut since the start of the year, and through the launch of the Password Checkup Chrome extension, Google also began pushing for the use of unique passwords, and eradication of password reuse.\n\nAnd password reuse is a major problem nowadays. A recent survey conducted by Google and The Harris Poll on a sample of 3,419 Americans has shown that users tend to use simplistic passwords, or tend to reuse passwords across accounts to make their lives easier.\n\n\u25cf Nearly one out of four Americans (24%) have used the following common passwords, or some variation: \"abc123,\" \"Password,\" \"123456,\" \"Iloveyou,\" \"111111,\" \"Qwerty,\" \"Admin\" or \"Welcome.\"\n\n\u25cf 59% of U.S. adults have incorporated a name (their own, a family member's, a partner's, or a pet's) or a birthday (their own, a child's, or a partner's) into their password to an online account\n\n\u25cf 22% have used their own name as part of their password.\n\n\u25cf One-third (33%) have used their pet's name or a variation as their password, while only 15% have used their spouse or partner's name and 14% have used their children's names.\n\n\u25cf 27% have attempted to guess someone else's password.\n\n\u25cf Of that group, 17% have guessed correctly.\n\n\u25cf 43% have access to someone else's active password.\n\n\u25cf Another 43% have shared their password with someone else, including:\n\n\u25cb 22% who have shared their password for a TV or movie streaming service\n\n\u25cb 20% who have shared their email account password\n\n\u25cb 17% who have shared their password for their social media accounts\n\n\u25cb 17% who have shared their password for their online shopping accounts\n\n\u25cf Despite 57% of password-sharers saying they share their passwords with their significant others, only 11% of Americans report changing their password after a breakup.\n\n\u25cf 37% use two-factor authentication.\n\n\u25cf One-third (34%) change their passwords regularly.\n\n\u25cf Only 15% use a password manager.\n\n\u25cf 36% keep track of passwords by writing them on a piece of paper.\n\n\u25cf Two-thirds (66%) use the same password for more than one online account.\n\n\u25cf 4 in 10 Americans say their personal information has been compromised online.\n\n\u25cf 47% of those whose information has been compromised lost money due to the compromise, including 12% who lost more than $500.\n\n\u25cf 38% report losing time because of a data breach.\n\n\u25cf Still, less than half of Americans (45%) would change their password to an online account following a data breach.", "description": "Google's Password Checkup is currently available for Android devices and Google's web dashboard.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/02/e04f06ca-c484-4447-9f79-23e5f2e91c03/thumbnail/770x578/bf646a7b2711f5a17324e98def354add/google-password-checkup.png"}
