Robert Mueller Robert (Bob) Swan MuellerFox News legal analyst says Trump call with Ukraine leader could be 'more serious' than what Mueller 'dragged up' Lewandowski says Mueller report was 'very clear' in proving 'there was no obstruction,' despite having 'never' read it Fox's Cavuto roasts Trump over criticism of network MORE spent a year telling us what we already knew in 2016, when candidate Donald Trump Donald John TrumpSchedule for additional depositions in impeachment inquiry revealed Sondland attorney disputes key portions of Taylor testimony: report Impeachment inquiry might be public by mid-November: report MORE made his infamous public plea, \u201cRussia, if you are listening, I hope you are able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.\u201d\n\nWe knew it definitively after numerous national security officials had announced that Russia was deliberately interfering with the 2016 election and responsible for the Wikileaks hack, and Trump went well beyond what normally would have disqualified a candidate in the minds of voters to what should have led to a Justice Department inquiry and what should certainly have led Democrats to change the narrative from the contents of the emails of Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonOcasio-Cortez reelection campaign refunds ,000 in donations from pro-Trump former Facebook exec Hillary Clinton celebrates Central Park's first statues honoring women Booker: 'Democrats don't need more candidates to enter' MORE to the character of candidate Trump.\n\nThe right knows what the left refuses to comprehend. What moves voters is not primarily the facts but the way leaders present those facts. It is a lesson they should have learned from the election of Trump, the saga of James Comey James Brien ComeyCNN's Jeffrey Toobin says he regrets role in playing up Clinton email story Federal prosecutors interviewed multiple FBI officials for Russia probe review: report State cites 38 people for violations in Clinton email review MORE, and the conclusion of the special counsel investigation. It looked like they finally got it right this time, but they now seem to be gravitating back toward reading voters the Congressional Record and assuming that the facts speak for themselves.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThey do not. Facts are politically inert ,unless they are embedded in understandable and compelling language, evocative verbal or visual imagery, and compelling narratives, which head off potential counternarratives at the pass. Once again, Democrats have the language wrong. What is wrong with quid pro quo? For starters, Americans do not speak Latin. Quid pro quo is the language of the courtroom and constitutional law, not the kitchen table. If you want to convince people who speak Spanish, do not talk to them in English. So if you want to convince voters who speak English, do not talk to them in Latin.\n\nDespite weeks of discussions on television since the whistle blew, I suspect if you polled the public, even the educated public, and provided a multiple-choice \u201ctest\u201d with at least two plausible answers, the vast majority would get it wrong. That it is irrelevant to whether the President committed high crimes and misdemeanors is an endlessly debated argument about which, as a voter, I shouldn\u2019t even know. Quid pro quo is also as evocative as it is intelligible to the average voter. It is the sequel to \u201cobstruction,\u201d which Democrats never explained to the American people in everyday language, either, during a year of endless discussions of the trailer to the box office failure of \u201cRobert Mueller\u2019s Day Off.\u201d\n\nHow about the imagery? Where have been the vivid descriptions of all the blood spilled in Russian incursions into Crimea and Ukraine; Putin, the former KGB wolf at their doorstep with his tanks as the Ukrainians bravely struggle for survival, and the bind in which Trump and his thugs placed their new president, at whom he and Pence thumbed their noses by skipping his inauguration?\n\nWhere has been the television coverage of what we are told repeatedly is gripping deposition testimony by amazing men like Ambassador Taylor, with impeccable credentials and integrity, just as we heard about Mueller? Democrats have had a strong reason to hold this initial phase of investigations in secret, but they might want to let the public in on the secret. All voters have heard is legalistic language about grand juries, leaving the door open for the Republican counternarrative about a partisan witch hunt.\n\nI heard the first argument for the secrecy this week, for the first time, which Democrats should have explained from the start: that we don\u2019t want Trump\u2019s witnesses to hear each other because we don\u2019t want them to coordinate their stories. So for God\u2019s sake, tell that to the American people. Otherwise, this does look like a partisan affair, and all the times voters hear, \u201cI can\u2019t discuss that\u201d from House Democrats just bolsters the GOP narrative.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAs for the Democratic narrative, Adam Schiff Adam Bennett SchiffOvernight Defense: Trump lifts sanctions on Turkey | 'Small number' of troops to remain by Syrian oil fields | Defense official's impeachment testimony delayed five hours after Republicans storm secure room Graham walks back 'that's nuts' comment on GOP congressmen storming impeachment hearing GOP lawmaker shares audio of phone call he made from highly classified SCIF room MORE has done an extraordinary job at both leading and speaking clearly, at least dropping ominous breadcrumbs to voters about why they should be concerned. But the imagery is wrong, not just in the absence of televised testimony. Surely someone tasked with staging should have told him about the camera angle from which he speaks every day on the House steps, as he moves his head left and right, with the media recording him from below. It makes him appear unnatural and distant, as voters see more of his nostrils than his pupils. Humans are primates, and we gauge truth-telling from whether someone looks us in the eyes.\n\nFinally, if Democrats delay a full House vote on articles of impeachment until after Thanksgiving, it will probably be game, set, match for Trump, who will argue that it\u2019s time to let voters decide at the ballot box, not to circumvent the process with an election-year impeachment. Sure, Democrats can collect more evidence. And they can continue to do so as the opposition party in 2019.\n\nDrew Westen is a psychology professor at Emory University and author of \u201cPolitical Brain: The Role of Emotion in Deciding the Fate of the Nation.\u201d", "description": "We have seen this movie before.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald_20191009getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
