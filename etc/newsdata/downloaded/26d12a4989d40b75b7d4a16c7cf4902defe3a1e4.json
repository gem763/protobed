I thought if we could all focus and fast \u2013 families who pray together stay together.\u201d\n\nJesus is King set to be released on Friday while another entitled Jesus is Born will be released around Christmas. The two albums are expected to take a far more evangelical tone than his previous work.\n\nDuring the nearly two-hour interview West also reaffirmed his intention to one day run for president, while also confirming that he continues to support President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cFor the greatest artist in human existence to put a red hat on was God\u2019s practical joke to all liberals. Like, \u2018No! Not Kanye!'\u201d he said, in reference to him regularly donning Trump\u2019s trademark \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 cap.\n\n\u201cThere will be a time when I will be the president of the U.S. and I will remember \u2026 any founder that didn\u2019t have the capacity to understand culturally what we were doing,\u201d he said.\n\nThe 42-year-old Grammy-winner also stated his conviction that he is the greatest artist of all time, declaring it simply a matter of fact.\n\n\u201cAnd now \u2014 I am unquestionably, undoubtedly, the greatest human artist of all time,\u201d he declared. \u201cIt\u2019s not even a question at this point. It\u2019s just a fact.\u201d\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "Rap superstar Kanye West revealed he asked artists working on his latest album, \"Jesus is King\" to refrain from premarital sex.", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/kanyekingno1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
