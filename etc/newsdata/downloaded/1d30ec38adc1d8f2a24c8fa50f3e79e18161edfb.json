REUTERS/Baz Ratner/Files\n\nFrustrated conservationists hope Friday\u2019s arrival of the environmentally-conscious Pope Francis will spotlight the island that lost 2% of primary rainforest last year, the highest of any tropical nation according to the World Resources Institute.\n\n\u201cHe should say that this forest is God\u2019s creation. He gave it to us and for our own benefit,\u201d said Anselme Toto Volahy, researcher from Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t manage it well, we will destroy ourselves.\u201d\n\nThe Kirindy forest, on the west of the island, spans 100,000 hectares (245,000 acres) but has lost almost half its size in two decades. Wastelands of blackened stumps are broken only by scorched trunks and twisted boughs of baobab trees resistant to fires.\n\nKirindy is home to a multitude of rare species, including the tiny Madame Berthe\u2019s mouse lemur, the world\u2019s smallest primate, which only exists there. Bug-eyed and weighing just 35 grams (1.25 ounces), the lemur\u2019s habitat may be completely destroyed in three years, said Volahy, though the animal might go sooner.\n\nMatthias Markolf, a lemur specialist at the German Primate Centre in Kirindy, has not spotted it for two years.\n\n\u201cWe do not find Berthe in places that we used to find it before,\u201d he said. \u201cIt might go extinct in the next couple of years if deforestation continues.\u201d\n\n\u2018THE SOIL IS DYING\u2019\n\nWith more than 80% of its species native, Madagascar has more unique plants and animals than the rest of Africa together.\n\nBut as well as farmers\u2019 fires, the island is facing increasingly powerful storms and extended droughts at the sharp edge of global climate change.\n\nWhen a 2016 harvest failed in the south, thousands of farmers migrated to the west - to Kirindy - accelerating the forest\u2019s destruction.\n\nUnscrupulous businessmen linked to local politicians pay around 50,000 ariary ($13.40) for every hectare of forest cleared, say village elders. It is backbreaking labour, but there is no shortage of workers in a nation where 90 percent of people survive on less than $2 per day.\n\n\u201cWe had to eat cactus and mango, from the morning to the evening,\u201d said 24-year-old Sonlinde Nathaly, recalling the drought that drove her and others from the south in a migration wave that coincided with a massive spike in deforestation.\n\nSatellite data shows Kirindy lost 4% of its area in the last two years, said Volahy, pacing through a clearing scattered with singed maize husks and giant snail shells bleached white by the blaze.\n\nAfter trees are felled, the area is torched to clear land for maize. Middlemen take the crops to big cities, where the kernels become untraceable, potentially entering the supply chain for big companies.\n\n\u201cSince 2013 we have worked with people from the government. The deal was, we cut (the forest) and grow maize,\u201d said Nahit\u00e0, vice president of the local administration in Lambokely, a dusty village that used to hug thick forest.\n\nNow the wooden houses cluster forlornly in a barren landscape. The shallow soils are worn out after three harvests of maize and peanuts, driving farmers further into the forest.\n\n\u201cThe soil is dying,\u201d said Phrosalia Soriana, a 36-year-old farmer. \u201cThe people in charge of the forest tell us that we are doing wrong.\u201d But, she asks, how else can she feed her family?\n\nUNTOUCHABLES?\n\nIn the past nine months, the government has made some efforts to slow the destruction, arresting several farmers and destroying corn in the protected area.\n\nBut bigger players remain free.\n\n\u201cTo totally eradicate the problem, we have to touch the untouchables,\u201d said Liana Rakotoson from Fanamby, a local conservation group investigating the maize business in Kirindy.\n\nProsecutors want to go after politicians involved and big companies that buy the maize.\n\nBut Andrianirina Francis, deputy prosecutor for Menabe region, said building a case is hard because farmers\u2019 maize crops are mixed before being sold on.\n\n\u201cThe product passes through many hands,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, big companies, like national brewery the STAR group, have a responsibility to know their suppliers, he insisted. \u201cTons and tons and tons of corn come from the destruction of the forest,\u201d Francis said, but \u201cSTAR never asks where their product comes from.\u201d\n\nSince 2011, French beverage company Castel has owned STAR, which is also Coca-Cola\u2019s Madagascar bottling partner.\n\nCastel and Coca-Cola did not respond to requests for comment. Francis Ambroise, the general manager of STAR in Madagascar, said the company accounted for only around 2% of the maize market. Most went to feed cattle, he said.\n\n\u201cThe company has supply contracts preventing sellers from sourcing their maize from the forest or any other protected area,\u201d he told Reuters.\n\nSlideshow (16 Images)\n\n\u201cWe work with (environmental group) Fanamby to control our suppliers, respect the contracts\u2019 clauses and to ensure the traceability of our maize supply ... using maize from protected areas would be against what we consider to be our society responsibility.\u201d\n\nBut Tiana Andriamanana, executive director of Fanamby, said \u201cthe chaotic market makes traceability impossible.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverybody sees the trucks of maize coming back and forth, usually at night, but nobody records where they go.\u201d", "description": "As a shocked world watches fires ravage the Amazon, slash-and-burn farmers are wreaking proportionally worse destruction half a world away in Madagascar, driving humanity's smallest relative - the Madame Berthe\u2019s mouse lemur - to extinction.", "authors": ["Rondro Ratsimbazafy", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1426890612&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8510I", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
