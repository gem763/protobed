Chris Pearce\n\nOn Friday, Mr Wilson, whose fund owns 4.7 per cent of Macquarie, accepted Nine's $1.46 per share deal. It comes after ad-man John Singleton and venture capitalist Mark Carnegie sold their stakes to Nine, taking the deal through the 90 per cent threshold it needs to compulsorily acquire the rest of Macquarie's shares.\n\nTo take the matter further, Mr Wilson would need to have either gone to court or the takeovers panel.\n\nBy accepting Nine's offer before Monday's 7pm deadline, Mr Wilson will get his payment earlier than if he held onto the shares and waited for compulsory acquisition.\n\nMr Wilson is still adamant the deal undervalues Macquarie and was an opportunistic bid by Nine.", "description": "Wilson Asset Management chairman Geoff Wilson is pulling up stumps on his campaign for a higher offer for Macquarie Media after Nine secured the holding it needs to sweep up the rest of the radio broadcaster.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.8059%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_412%2C$y_110/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/b26fb6f6509bfcf988e32d0fbeccbfe7ae4c1081", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
