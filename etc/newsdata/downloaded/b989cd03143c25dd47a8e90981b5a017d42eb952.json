Further ferry contracts were later cancelled at a reported cost of 50 million pounds ($63m) to the taxpayer.\n\nThe new contracts will remain in place for the next four years in case further help is needed.\n\nA pharmaceutical industry group said the announcement would help companies finalise their plans for a no-deal Brexit.\n\n\"This capacity is an important part of our members' preparations,\" said Mike Thompson, chief executive of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry.\n\n\"Stockpiles are also in place, and some companies have already sourced their own alternative ferry routes.\"\n\nThe \"no-deal\" preparations were announced as police officers warned a disorderly EU withdrawal would lead to forces around the country being forced to prioritise which criminal activity to deal with.\n\nNational Police Chiefs' Council lead, Chief Constable Charlie Hall also warned there was a chance a no-deal Brexit could result in difficulties arresting foreign suspects, while there was a spike in September in the number of MPs accessing a dedicated police service designed to offer added security to parliamentarians.", "description": "But any concessions made by Boris Johnson likely to be seen as betrayals by hard line Eurosceptics in his own party.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/11/9771e360e2994b1ea73a8d6309391634_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
