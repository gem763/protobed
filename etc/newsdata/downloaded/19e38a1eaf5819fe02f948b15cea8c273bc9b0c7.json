(Niklas Halle\u2019n/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nChristopher Gloyne, a retired accountant, has voted exclusively for the Conservative Party for 60 years. But he just tore up his party membership card because he\u2019s furious at Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\n\n\u201cHe is deliberately bypassing 400 years of parliamentary democracy by what he\u2019s doing,\u201d said Gloyne, 78, who stood, wrapped in a blue European Union flag, in a large protest Saturday near the prime minister\u2019s office at 10 Downing Street.\n\nJohnson, who took over as prime minister in July, drove a spike into a raw nerve in Britain when he announced last week that he intends to suspend Parliament for five weeks, sharply limiting members\u2019 opportunity to debate the terms of Britain\u2019s Oct. 31 Brexit divorce from the European Union.\n\nThat maneuver set up a potentially ferocious showdown on Tuesday, when Parliament returns from its summer recess. Jeremy Corbyn, Johnson\u2019s chief rival as leader of the opposition Labour Party, has promised to fight Johnson in the House of Commons, calling his action a \u201csmash and grab\u201d on democracy.\n\nBrexit has already deeply divided and wounded Britain, but Johnson\u2019s move has provoked a new level of anger, creating one of the most emotional moments in recent British history.\n\nFrom Scotland to Northern Ireland to England, Britons are accusing each other of assaulting the world\u2019s most storied and emulated democracy, hurling their rage in the starkest of terms.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not military, but it\u2019s most certainly a coup,\u201d said Sue Harding, 58, a nurse in the National Health Service. She called Johnson\u2019s plan to suspend Parliament \u201cheartbreaking.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy father fought in World War II against the Nazis and the rise of the far right, only to have this,\u201d she said while protesting near Downing Street. \u201cIt makes me ashamed to say I am British.\u201d\n\n[Anger over Brexit push without Parliament reaches Johnson\u2019s doorstep]\n\nJohnson has defended the suspension, scheduled to start next week, as legal and benign, a chance for his new government to make a fresh start after taking office just five weeks ago. He said lawmakers would still have plenty of time to debate Brexit.\n\nSuspending Parliament at this time of year is fairly typical. But doing it for so long \u2014 and with such a hugely significant political decision looming \u2014 is highly unusual. It\u2019s also a major political gamble for Johnson, who has staked his job on a promise of Brexit by Halloween, \u201cdo or die.\u201d\n\n\n\nA demonstrator shouts during an anti-Brexit protest Saturday in London. (Henry Nicholls/Reuters)\n\nCorbyn and others have accused Johnson of trampling democratic norms in an attempt to ram though Brexit, which British voters approved by a narrow margin in a 2016 referendum.\n\nThey say Johnson is so determined to deliver Brexit \u2014 which his predecessor, Theresa May, was unable to do \u2014 that he\u2019s willing to cause lasting damage to a democratic system that has long been a beacon around the world.\n\n\u201cWe are mourning. What\u2019s happening is wrong,\u201d said Elizabeth Mahmoud, her eyes filling with tears on Saturday.\n\nAt 64, the caterer was attending her first political demonstration. Her young granddaughter held a sign that read, \u201cHistory is Watching.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople look to the British Parliament for fairness, for freedom and for everybody to get a voice,\u201d Mahmoud said. \u201cPlease don\u2019t take our voice away.\u201d\n\nMahmoud moved to Britain from Germany 40 years ago. Her parents lived through the horrors of World War II in her homeland, she said.\n\n\u201cGermans are still burdened with that guilt,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know what government can do to its people, and we definitely don\u2019t want that to start happening here. It\u2019s not political. It\u2019s what Britain is about. It\u2019s moral.\u201d\n\n[Johnson asked the queen to suspend Parliament. Why didn\u2019t she just say no?]\n\nEven members of Johnson\u2019s Conservative Party who support Brexit have lined up against his decision to suspend Parliament. The day after his announcement, two key Johnson political allies resigned from their posts.\n\nJohnson\u2019s supporters argue that anti-Brexit activists are the ones subverting democracy by not honoring the will of the people reflected in the referendum.\n\n\u201cA lot of us are frustrated and angry because our vote has not been respected,\u201d said James Saunders, 35, part of a group of marchers who carried British flags and taunted anti-Johnson protesters on Saturday.\n\nHe praised Johnson\u2019s maneuver as necessary to stop Corbyn and others from pushing for a second referendum on Brexit.\n\n\u201cIf that happens,\u201d he said, \u201cdemocracy will be destroyed in the United Kingdom.\u201d\n\nJohnson painted the situation as a choice between his plan and \u201cchaos.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you going to side with Jeremy Corbyn and those who want to cancel the referendum?\u201d he asked in an interview published in the Sunday Times. \u201cAre you going to side with those who want to scrub the democratic verdict of the people \u2014 and plunge this country into chaos?\u201d\n\nSaturday\u2019s national protests did not necessarily pit \u201cLeave\u201d against \u201cRemain.\u201d It was largely people from both sides of the debate, joining to oppose Johnson\u2019s move to suspend Parliament.\n\nJames Cashman, a history student at the University of Oxford, carried a sign that read, \u201cI voted to leave. This is not my will.\u201d\n\n\u201cI voted to leave because I wanted to protect and promote parliamentary sovereignty, the right of the British people to make laws enacted in a British Parliament,\u201d said Cashman, 21.\n\n\u201cBut how can I sit at home when Boris Johnson has chosen to basically suspend British democracy by closing Parliament?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt is absolutely an outrage. Once you let them do it once, they will do it again.\u201d\n\n[Former British leader joins bid to derail shuttering of Parliament amid Brexit crisis]\n\nSome are fighting Johnson in court cases filed in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Former Conservative prime minister John Major is supporting one of the challenges \u2014 an unusual move by a former leader against a sitting one.\n\nA Scottish judge on Friday temporarily sided with Johnson, rejecting an appeal filed by 75 \u00adanti-Brexit legislators to block the suspension of Parliament. Hearings in that case and the others are scheduled for this week.\n\nBut even the protesters interviewed over the weekend said the legal challenges were a long shot. Most said that they believed Johnson has the legal right to suspend Parliament and that the real battle is political and will be fought in Parliament when legislators return on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a very fiery day,\u201d said Tim Grant, 52, an insurance executive. \u201cI hope some sense and decency prevails. But I\u2019m not super optimistic.\u201d\n\nGrant noted that Britain has no formal, written constitution \u2014 the country\u2019s democracy is largely guided by tradition and precedent. He called it \u201ca great opportunity for people who are malevolent to pretty much do whatever they like.\u201d\n\nMichael Lewis, a 48-year-old computer engineer, said Johnson was pushing for a \u201cno deal\u201d Brexit, in which Britain would leave the European Union without agreements in place to regulate trade, border security and other issues.\n\nAnalysts have warned that such an outcome would lead to shortages of food and medicine and other economic and social problems. Johnson has dismissed those concerns as \u201cProject Fear.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe recognize that a majority of people in the referendum did actually vote for Brexit,\u201d Lewis said. But he said the consequences were not clear when the people voted.\n\n\u201cIn the parliamentary democracy that we have, it\u2019s now up to Parliament to scrutinize that deal, and they are being prevented from doing their job,\u201d he said.\n\nThe British government on Sunday launched a giant \u201cGet Ready for Brexit\u201d campaign, featuring billboards and ads directing Britons to a website with detailed information about how to prepare themselves and their businesses for a no-deal Brexit.\n\n[Johnson seizes momentum on Brexit with combative move to suspend Parliament]\n\nTensions were ratcheted up still higher Sunday when Michael Gove, a key Brexit adviser to Johnson, said on the BBC that the government would not necessarily abide by Brexit legislation passed by Parliament this week.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see what the legislation says,\u201d Gove said.\n\nThat brought immediate fury from opponents.\n\n\u201cThe Tory attack on our democracy is getting worse,\u201d tweeted John McDonnell, the Labour Party shadow chancellor. \u201cThis is a startling move beyond anything we\u2019ve ever seen. Johnson government is becoming an elective dictatorship.\u201d\n\nThe looming political showdown could lead to anything from a negotiated legislative solution to a vote of no-confidence in Johnson and a new general election.\n\nBut the damage to British democracy \u2014 or at least to public faith in it \u2014 might already be done.\n\n\u201cThe British public is fundamentally divided against itself,\u201d said Steven Fielding, a political history professor at the University of Nottingham. \u201cNo matter what Britain does, it will not get rid of the divisions for at least a generation.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAllies of British prime minister resign amid outrage over Parliament suspension\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "Britons on both sides of the divide are accusing each other of assaulting hundreds of years of democracy.", "authors": ["Kevin Sullivan", "Senior Correspondent Covering National", "International Affairs", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/YI2Vj_B4iS_OhItlDNn6hHqdinc=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/72SHH7GM3YI6TDA4PSHOPBNYKU.jpg"}
