But the texts kept coming. Finally, he checked Obama\u2019s Facebook page for himself.\n\n\u201cAnd I saw my name on there,\u201d he says. \u201cThen I started picturing him reading some of the sillier stuff that I wrote in there, like, \u2018Oh my God, the president read a thing I wrote about J.J. Redick\u2019s penis.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe nod from Obama was one of many accolades for the best-selling \u201cBasketball (And Other Things).\u201d Now, Serrano is back with the second book in the series, \u201cMovies (And Other Things),\u201d which hit shelves this week.\n\nAD\n\nSerrano\u2019s new book follows the same Q&A format as the previous one. Serrano, a staff writer for the Ringer website, uses idiosyncratic humor \u2014 plus illustrations by Arturo Torres \u2014 to explore a film-themed question in each of his 30 chapters. Among them: \u201cWere the \u2018Jurassic Park\u2019 raptors just misunderstood?\u201d \u201cWhich movie death hurt you the most as an adult?\u201d and \u201cWhich race was white-saviored the best by Kevin Costner?\u201d\n\nSpeaking from his office in Houston, Serrano discussed putting together the second installment in his \u201c(And Other Things)\u201d series.\n\nQ: So how did \u201cMovies (And Other Things)\u201d come about?\n\nAD\n\nA: I really liked working on the basketball book. I liked the format and how set everything was. Each chapter is its own thing, and you don\u2019t have to read it in order. You can read whatever chapters you want, and you\u2019re fine. But they all sort of have the same feel and a through line that connects them all. When Arturo and I decided, \u201cAll right, let\u2019s do another book,\u201d it just made sense to us.\n\nAD\n\nHow did the success of \u201cBasketball (And Other Things)\u201d affect your approach to this book?\n\nI try to make it a point, whenever I\u2019m writing stuff, to just assume nobody is ever going to read it. That makes it easier.\n\nYou got John Leguizamo and Don Cheadle to write the forward and afterward, respectively. How did you react when they joined the project?\n\nAD\n\nOh dude, I . . . lost my mind. I\u2019ve followed John Leguizamo\u2019s career for 20 years, and we\u2019ve had this very one-sided relationship where anything he\u2019s in, I\u2019m going to go see it. It\u2019s the same with Don Cheadle. He showed up in my life very early and has been there for a long, long time. He\u2019s always been just this exceptionally cool movie star. So to be able to have them do the forward and afterward was a big achievement for me. But more than anything else, I just wanted to use it as an excuse to try to have a conversation with these two guys that I\u2019ve looked up to.\n\nAD\n\nThis book tackles a lot of amusing questions. What was the most enjoyable chapter to write?\n\nIn my head right now, they all suck and they\u2019re all terrible and none of them are funny or smart, because I\u2019ve just gone so, so many times through them. But if I had to pick one, I think \u201cWho\u2019s in the perfect heist movie crew?\u201d was the most purely fun to write. I had to spend two weeks watching every heist movie that I could think of, or that was on any list on the Internet anywhere, to make sure that I didn\u2019t miss anything. I could think of worse ways to spend a couple weeks than watching \u201cSet If Off\u201d and \u201cPoint Break\u201d and \u201cOcean\u2019s Eleven,\u201d \u201cTwelve,\u201d \u201cThirteen\u201d and \u201c8.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOne highlight is the chapter in which you imagine \u201cHalloween\u201d villain Michael Myers conducting an NBA-style postgame press conference after a night of slayings. What did you find so entertaining about that premise?\n\nAD\n\nWhat\u2019s the opposite of what you know Michael Myers to be? To me, that would be this sort of secretly funny, almost tender person who likes to talk about the stuff that he\u2019s doing. He never one time says one single word ever in any of the movies, so if I got to pick a dream scenario, I would like to see him answering a bunch of questions. It was just a silly, dumb thing that made me laugh.\n\nYou made the Marvel Cinematic Universe chapter a transcript of a conversation you had with your three young sons after seeing \u201cAvengers: Endgame.\u201d How did you land on that concept?\n\nAD\n\nI thought it would be interesting in 10 years to look back and have this conversation saved forever. It\u2019s going to be in the book for a long, long time, and even if it\u2019s not meaningful to anybody else, it\u2019s going to mean a lot to me to think back to that time in all of our lives. As silly as the idea of Iron Man fighting Thanos is, it\u2019s also a moment that we had together and a bunch of other people had, and let\u2019s be a little sentimental for at least this one chapter.\n\nAD\n\nWhat\u2019s next for you and the \u201c(And Other Things)\u201d series?\n\nWe\u2019re definitely doing a third \u201c(And Other Things).\u201d But I don\u2019t know exactly what we\u2019re going to do just yet. I would guess it\u2019s between rap or television. Both of those would be fun projects to spend two years of my life working on with Arturo again.\n\nThomas Floyd is a freelance journalist who writes about arts and entertainment for The Washington Post.
