It brought to maturity the strategic instincts that defined him in subsequent battles \u2014 including his contested stewardship of the Thomas hearings \u2014 and that shape his candidacy today.\n\nThe fate of Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign, and perhaps a future presidency, may hinge on whether that version of leadership, defined by collegiality and adherence to procedure, can inspire Democrats and coax cooperation from Republicans. In the presidential race, there is no Ted Kennedy to sound a trumpet for the left while Mr. Biden plays a methodical inside game. And there are no Republicans to be found in the Senate like Specter, who eventually, at Mr. Biden\u2019s urging, quit the G.O.P. to become a Democrat before his death in 2012.\n\nStill, Mr. Gitenstein said he had encouraged the former vice president to draw public attention to his role in the 1987 court fight. The defeat of Robert Bork averted a solidly conservative majority, handing the court\u2019s decisive seat to the more pliant Anthony M. Kennedy, who became a decisive figure in a generation\u2019s worth of eclectic rulings on subjects from campaign finance and union rights to abortion and the legal definition of marriage.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he or anyone else makes enough of the fact that, but for Biden, Roe would be dead 30 years ago, and, but for Biden, we wouldn\u2019t have the gay marriage decision,\u201d Mr. Gitenstein said. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to him about it. He\u2019s got so much on his platter.\u201d\n\nMr. DeConcini, who at 82 is a supporter of Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign, said he hoped a strategy of moderation could prevail again.\n\nBut he admitted to having doubts.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to think so, I really would,\u201d Mr. DeConcini said. \u201cI\u2019m just not sure.\u201d", "description": "In the clash over Robert H.
