He knows it, his players know it.\n\n\u2018As a professional, you just know. You know when an \u00adopponent is quality and better than you. I\u2019m not saying that means they\u2019ll inevitably win. But you still know.\n\n\u2018Even in the 80s when Liverpool were the ones winning \u00adeverything, no Bryan Robson side thought they were inferior.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ll bet Sir Alex Ferguson (along with Gary Neville) will be watching with an impeding sense of fear and horror.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShould Liverpool cement their place in the record books tomorrow, Fowler is hoping his old club don\u2019t overcelebrate in the way the class of 2000 did when a Danny Murphy goal helped the Reds record a rare Old Trafford win.\n\nHe added: \u2018On one occasion we went to Old Trafford in December 2000, they hadn\u2019t lost at home for two years and we beat them, with a Danny Murphy free-kick.\n\n\u2018At the end, some of the lads went a bit crazy, celebrated wildly, but I didn\u2019t, just clapped the fans and got off the pitch.\n\n\u2018The next day, Gerard Houllier called me into his office. He had a bit of a go at me, wanted to know why I didn\u2019t join in with the team, didn\u2019t join in with the \u2018spirit\u2019 of the \u00adoccasion. \u201cBecause it was \u00adembarrassing,\u201d I said.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018We are Liverpool. Beating Manchester United isn\u2019t a huge achievement. That\u2019s what little clubs do\u2026 we\u2019re not a little club. We don\u2019t celebrate like we\u2019ve just won the league simply \u00adbecause we beat them.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018He accepted my point \u00adeventually. There were reasons we didn\u2019t win the league, but we were a damn good side, who could match any team, and went into every game, even against United, believing that.\n\n\u2018If they do win [tomorrow], as the bookies \u00adoverwhelmingly suggest they will, then I\u2019d be gutted if I saw them celebrating wildly.\u2019\n\nMORE: Juventus set price for Manchester United to sign former Liverpool star Emre Can\n\nMORE: Manchester United star Paul Pogba posts fresh injury update after Liverpool blow", "description": "Robbie Fowler believes Manchester United legends Sir Alex Ferguson and Gary Neville will be watching on in fear when Premier League leaders Liverpool turn up at Old Trafford tomorrow.
