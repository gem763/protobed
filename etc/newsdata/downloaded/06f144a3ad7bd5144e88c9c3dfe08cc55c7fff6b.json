The We Company's debt hit record lows on Wednesday, trading at 85 cents on the dollar. The credit-ratings agency Fitch Ratings downgraded the company further into speculative or noninvestment-grade territory earlier this week.\n\n\"This is indicative of the persistent reach for yield which has pushed people into companies which don't belong in high yield,\" John McClain, a portfolio manager at Diamond Hill, a US investment firm that manages fixed-income funds, told Business Insider in an interview.\n\nKnock-on effect\n\n\"This house-of-cards failing could have a knock-on effect for SoftBank and other unicorn IPOs as people start to focus more on cash flow than simply growth,\" he added.\n\nThe debt is now among the most expensive to short in the $9.5 trillion US corporate-debt market, according to Sam Pierson, a director at IHS Markit's securities-lending division. It now costs 5.5%, plus the cost of new borrowing, to borrow WeWork debt, which now yields almost 12%.\n\nThe We Company's bond prices.

Now Adam Neumann has been removed as CEO, and its IPO plans have been shelved.\n\nThe company's inaugural junk bonds yielded 7.875% and attracted plenty of investor interest, following in the path of other fast-growing tech companies like Uber, Tesla, and Netflix in tapping the high-yield market. Investors have become increasingly wary, however, of cash-burning companies piling on leverage amid dubious financials.\n\nWeWork's recently mooted plans of issuing even more junk debt was met with derision from investors.\n\nWeWork and SoftBank didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.", "description": "Some $67 million of We's debt is on loan. \"Now that investors are finally doing credit work on the name, they aren't liking what they see,\" one fund manager said.", "authors": ["Callum Burroughs"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d7ba63e2e22af21c40abc5a?width=1200&format=jpeg"}
