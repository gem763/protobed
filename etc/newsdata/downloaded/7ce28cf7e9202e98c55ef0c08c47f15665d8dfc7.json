She shares this serenity gladly. Today she calms young models with advice she was given by Bethann Hardison, a long-time activist who has fought to diversify the fashion industry for decades: \u201cClose your eyes, take a deep breath, open your eyes, and walk.\u201d\n\nMost of us are lucky to have one shot on life\u2019s merry-go-round, but for JoAni Johnson the ride just keeps getting faster. Having grown up in the 1960s at the height of the civil rights movement, she now finds herself being feted as an exemplar of fashion\u2019s reckoning with runway racism and misogyny as brands scramble to connect with millennial customers. When, in May, she was hired to model Rihanna\u2019s fashion line, Fenty, fashion bloggers swooned at the symbolism of a young black designer choosing an older black woman as her muse.\n\nOlder women who defy convention have been having something of a moment lately. Maybe you\u2019re among the 3.8 million people who follows Baddiewinkle, the 90-year-old Instagram celebrity who posts images of herself in garish attire alongside innuendo-laden captions. And perhaps you have seen the New York Times video of Inge Ginsburg, the 96-year-old Holocaust survivor who fronts a death-metal band in Switzerland. Then there\u2019s Iris Apfel, the lavishly accessorized subject of a documentary by Albert Maysles. Last February, Apfel signed with modelling agency IMG, home of Kate Moss and Karlie Kloss. She is 97. You can buy a Barbie doll in her likeness.\n\nYou\u2019d have to be a killjoy not to admire the ways in which these women thumb their noses at social pieties, but it\u2019s hard to avoid a whiff of the Victorian sideshow in the way they are presented to us as kooks. Baddiewinkle may be a delicious riposte to a culture that has stigmatised the old as dull, but we also need templates to show how age can be strong, eloquent and beautiful.\n\nJohnson, 67, has walked the runway for Ozwald Boateng and Eileen Fisher, and featured in ads for Pyer Moss, arguably America\u2019s hottest fashion label. When Peter, her husband of 21 years, died two months after her first fashion show, Johnson felt compelled to continue. It was his enthusiasm that had pushed her forward. \u201cHe encouraged me all the way,\u201d she says. Her voice is gentle and clear. \u201cHe was so proud.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Grey power: JoAni Johnson wears a floral top by simonerocha.com and sculptural gold earrings by mishodesigns.com.

The walks were a way of mapping a city they\u2019d seen change and change again, but also of affirming the unchanging fact of their place in it. Having grown up in Harlem, the daughter of Jamaican immigrants, Johnson knew all about cycles of decline and resurrection.\n\nIt was during one of their walks, one afternoon in 2016, that Johnson found herself posing, reluctantly, for a street photographer who had doubled back to ask to take her portrait. \u201cAfter that, I started getting contacted,\u201d she says matter-of-factly.\n\nShe was cast in a video for Allure magazine, showcasing older, self-empowered women. When the video went viral, more bookings followed. If you needed an example of the ways in which social media has reshaped visibility and representation, that Instagram post would be a good place to start. It was the catapult that launched Johnson\u2019s modelling career.\n\nOlder models are not a new phenomenon \u2013 the legendary Australian model, Jennifer Hocking, was rediscovered in her 70s by Mario Testino; in 2017 Lauren Hutton, then 73, starred in an underwear campaign for Calvin Klein; earlier this year, Daphne Selfe, received a British Empire Award for a modelling career that is still going strong at 90. But those models got their starts young. Their reappearance in later life taps into a collective nostalgia. Johnson, by contrast, is emblematic of something new: a reflexive instinct of primarily young designers to think beyond the conflation of beauty with youth.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Runway reckoning: JoAni Johnson wears ecru blazer and trousers by acnestudios.com; silk shirt by equipmentfr.com and trainers by adidas.com. Photograph: Heather Favell/The Observer\n\nFor Bethann Hardison, it would be a mistake to think of Johnson\u2019s sudden ubiquity as just a trend for older women. \u201cI give Rihanna more credit than that,\u201d she says. \u201cI think she\u2019s smart and has good taste, and she just found JoAni attractive.\u201d She pauses. \u201cI find her attractive,\u201d she adds. In other words, when people look at Johnson in campaigns for Fenty are they seeing an older woman, or just a beautiful woman? For Hardison, true success will be the day we refer to Johnson as simply a model, without qualifiers around race or age.\n\nEvery generation has its cultural reference points. For Johnson it was the Beatles and Twiggy; it was the beret sported by Faye Dunaway in Bonnie & Clyde; it was the mini skirt she rigged from her school uniform. \u201cAs soon as we left school we rolled them up so they were short and cute with our white blouse and little blazer,\u201d she laughs.\n\nAt least the makeshift mini was more successful than her Beatles shag. \u201cI took a bowl, put it over my head and cut off my hair,\u201d she recalls. \u201cMy mother went crazy.\u201d\n\nHer mother is 94 now, and still a powerhouse who attends church every day. \u201cShe loves to dress,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cAll my family were into dressing well \u2013 the way you looked played a very big part, especially if you were a person of colour.\u201d It\u2019s why Harlem has a storied place in fashion history. \u201cYou see photos of 125th street from the 1920s and 30s and everyone was dressed to the T.\u201d\n\nAt college, Johnson studied biology and art. It was a restless era and she felt giddy on the atmosphere of protest and idealism. \u201cWe were looking for possibility and change,\u201d she recalls.\n\n\u201cWe were in environments where there were so many roadblocks, and the only way to get it changed was to do something, actively \u2013 so we did.\u201d History was happening, but much of it was discernible only in hindsight. She saw Angela Davis speak before her name was synonymous with the Black Panthers and revolution. \u201cI wasn\u2019t like, \u2018We\u2019re going to see Angela Davis,\u2019 Johnson says. \u201cPeople didn\u2019t know those names until they became who they were.\u201d\n\nHer first job after college was in New York\u2019s garment district, before she moved on to ride the wave of designer jeans as a sales associate in the 1980s, briefly designing scratch \u2019n\u2019 sniff clothes for children, including a T-shirt that smelled, alas, like a Hershey\u2019s chocolate bar.\n\nAfter taking time out to raise her child, she made her way back into the corporate world, one of very few black women to find herself in a senior marketing position, when she was struck by an anomaly. She and her colleague were the only employees working on a proposal in the office on New Year\u2019s Eve. \u201cI said, \u2018Why are we the only people dedicated enough to make this happen?\u2019\u201d\n\nJohnson knew the answer, of course. \u201cThey were going to question us about everything, because we were women and we were black,\u201d she says. The sense of being scrutinised, of having to hurdle a higher bar, was not new. \u201cIt\u2019s better today, but you are always challenged,\u201d she says.\n\nBut that New Year\u2019s Eve, Johnson and her colleague downed tools and left the building. \u201cWe went to the Plaza Hotel for tea and we had a marvellous time,\u201d she says. They did it again the following year, this time with their daughters in tow. The next year their sisters joined in. \u201cBy the time we left the Plaza we were 18 people,\u201d Johnson recalled.\n\nToo many to continue sitting together, they began hosting tea meet-ups on their own. When a member opened a tea shop, Johnson seized her opportunity. \u201cI found my niche in blending,\u201d she says.\n\nToday Johnson\u2019s tea blends find their way into fancy New York restaurants where they are often used to create speciality cocktails. She misses drinking tea with her husband who died in November 2017, less than two months after she appeared in her first New York Fashion Week.\n\n\u201cHe dressed impeccably,\u201d she says. \u201cHe had a collection of shoes and he could tell me every shoemaker from the stitches they used.\u201d The shoes are still at home in Harlem, all 150 pairs of them. Johnson can\u2019t bear to part with them. She smiles, fondly, then recalls his giddy excitement for her first fashion week. \u201cHe debated for about a week what to wear,\u201d she says. \u201cHe ended up in a pair of black jeans with his vintage peace scarf from the 1960s.\u201d She remembers spotting him scuttling back and forth to take photographs. \u201cHe was fabulous,\u201d she says. \u201cJust fabulous.\u201d\n\nRecently, she attended a cocktail party and could not understand why she felt so discomposed. There was something at the edge of her consciousness that she only figured out as she was leaving.\n\n\u201cThe place that the event was held was where my husband got down on one knee and asked me to marry him,\u201d she recalls, before smiling her dazzling supermodel smile. \u201cAnd then I felt joy.\u201d\n\nMakeup by Colleen Creighton using Fenty Beauty by Rihanna at Kramer + Kramer; hair by Koji Ichikawa at the Club NYC using Laicale; photographer\u2019s assistant Lee Grubb; fashion assistant Peter Bevan\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.
