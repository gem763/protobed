August was a brutally volatile month for the stock market with wild swings in both directions. In addition, with multiple brief inversions of the yield curve during the month, fears of a possible recession sent market watchers into a frenzy.\n\n\u201cAmid the volatility of financial markets seeming to mirror the rest of the world, the U.S. job market has remained a veritable pillar of stability,\u201d Mark Hamrick, Bankrate.com\u2019s senior economic analyst, wrote in an email to Yahoo Finance. \u201cIn terms of relatively stability, the upcoming August employment reading should be no exception, with the emphasis on \u2018should.\u2019 The key question is whether the U.S. economy continues to grow in the face of these headwinds.\u201d\n\nA help wanted sign. More\n\nThough consensus estimates call for a decline in job additions from last month, some economists are predicting a much healthier picture for the overall labor market.\n\nMorgan Stanley economist Ellen Zenter predicts that the U.S. economy added a cool 181,000 jobs in August. \u201cMost key data on the labor market for August out so far have sent rather positive signals,\u201d Zenter wrote in a note to clients Thursday. For one, in the July survey week, initial jobless claims continued to run at low levels and there were no particular indications that the rate of hiring might have slowed markedly. Secondly, the August labor market differential reported by the Conference Board rose to a multi-year high again. Thirdly, the ADP employment report surprised to the upside with underlying strength being rather broad based. Together, these point to still healthy underlying labor market conditions.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Wells Fargo economist Sam Bullard predicts that only 135,000 jobs were added in August. \u201cMonthly job gains have slowed so far this year, yet the underlying pace is still solid enough to promote moderate GDP growth,\u201d Bullard wrote in a note Thursday. \u201cThat said, the U.S. labor market is not immune to the deceleration in the pace of overall economic growth we have seen recently, and will ultimately show up in future hiring plans.\u201d\n\nThe BLS report comes after a new report from ADP Research Institute and Moody\u2019s on Thursday showed that job growth in the U.S. private sector was better than economists\u2019 expectations in August . The U.S. private sector added 195,000 positions in August, higher than the 148,000 positions Wall Street was predicting.\n\nJuly\u2019s figure was revised down to 142,000, from the 156,000 positions that was initially reported.\n\n\u201cIn August we saw a rebound in private-sector employment,\u201d Ahu Yildirmaz, vice president and co-head of the ADP Research Institute said in a statement. \u201cThis is the first time in the last 12 months that we have seen balanced job growth across small, medium and large-sized companies.\u201d\n\nMark Zandi, chief economist of Moody\u2019s Analytics, added, \u201cBusinesses are holding firm on their payrolls despite the slowing economy. Hiring has moderated, but layoffs remain low. As long as this continues recession will remain at bay.\u201d\n\nThough the ADP report is not always a reliable indicator of what the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) report will illustrate, it does provide a bit of insight into the health of employment in the U.S.\n\nYahoo Finance All Markets Summit More\n\n\u2014\n\nHeidi Chung is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
