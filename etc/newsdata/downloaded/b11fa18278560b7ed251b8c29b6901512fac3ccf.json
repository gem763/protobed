The event\u2019s organizer pointed to the dress code, which stated that young women were required to wear dresses.\n\n\u201cI thought there had to be a misunderstanding,\u201d Darcy\u2019s mother, Melissa Krueger, told Yahoo on Friday. \u201cWhat century are we in!?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHer confusion was understandable. Jumpsuits have exploded in popularity in recent years, becoming practically ubiquitous at weddings and other formal occasions. Once associated with the 1970s, the flattering one-piece garments are now a staple of the Oscars red carpet, and white jumpsuits have become a trendy alternative to bridal gowns. And while women have been dressing up in pantsuits and so-called \u201cmenswear\u201d for decades, many of today\u2019s teenagers are rejecting traditional gender norms altogether. Last month, Brandon Allen, a gay high school senior in Memphis, accepted the gender-neutral title of \u201cHomecoming Royalty\u201d in a floor-length gown, telling the Commercial Appeal, \u201cI decided to wear a dress because I strongly believe in the fact that I\u2019m a queen.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThough Darcy received a refund on her $50 homecoming ticket, she and her mother were angered to learn that she wouldn\u2019t be allowed to attend the dance unless she went home and changed first.\n\n\u201cThe bigger question is, why can\u2019t a girl wear something other than a dress?\u201d Darcy\u2019s mother told CNN. \u201cThis isn\u2019t \u2018Little House on the Prairie.\u2019\u201d\n\nAD\n\nDenied entrance to to her Senior Homecoming dance. Posted by Melissa Krueger on Friday, September 27, 2019\n\nNeither had predicted that the 17-year-old\u2019s fashionable wide-legged jumpsuit would be an issue. The dress code for the Tampa Bay Homeschool Homecoming Dance specified that young women were expected to wear semiformal dresses, but the rules seemed mostly intended to ensure that teenagers dressed modestly.\n\n\u201cPlease plan your attire within a conservative manner,\u201d a since-deleted Facebook post read. \u201cWe do allow strapless and knee length short dresses, as well as 2 piece dresses with less than 2\u2032 gap at midsection. We highly discourage dresses that are too revealing and that are simply too short. Dresses that expose a plunging neckline or backlines are NOT appropriate.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe guidelines also noted that jeans, T-shirts and baseball caps weren\u2019t allowed, but since Darcy\u2019s dressy jumpsuit would have fit right in at a wedding or any other formal event, neither she nor her mother thought twice about it. \u201cIt didn\u2019t cross my mind her outfit would be in violation,\u201d Krueger told NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show.\n\nAD\n\nFrom certain angles, Darcy\u2019s flowy bodysuit could have easily been mistaken for an ankle-length dress. But the teenager told \u201cToday\u201d that while she was waiting in line, the event planner, Stephanie Voth, caught a glimpse of her pant legs.\n\n\u201cThe moment she saw my legs move, she immediately denied me entrance,\u201d Darcy said. \u201cIt felt very dismissive and inconsiderate.\u201d\n\nIn an emailed statement to WFTS, Voth defended the policy.\n\n\u201cWe have 2 private events every year for our students,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThese events have a dress code. This particular event 390 students bought tickets. Only 1 student had to be turned away and it was due to dress code. We offered her an opportunity to come back if she could change into the dress code. We would have loved to had 100% attendance. However, her ticket was refunded after the event and we confirmed that she did not return.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDarcy told \u201cToday\u201d that she wasn\u2019t willing to go home and change just so she could attend the event.\n\n\u201cThat was not an option for me once I realized the only reason I couldn\u2019t go in was because I wasn\u2019t wearing an actual dress,\u201d she said. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t support that idea. My initial reaction was to call my mom since she had dropped me off there to just come and pick me up and go home. I didn\u2019t want to be there anymore.\u201d\n\nUp until that point, the 17-year-old had been excited for the dance, which was supposed to be an opportunity for home-schooled students to experience a traditional homecoming. But she went home upset instead. \u201cFeeling awful,\u201d her mother wrote on Facebook. \u201c#seniorhocoruined.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBy early Monday morning, nearly 500 people had commented on the post, complimenting Darcy\u2019s \u201cstunning,\u201d \u201camazing\u201d and \u201cclassy\u201d jumpsuit. A local photographer, Jennie Ellis, volunteered to do a free photo shoot with the 17-year-old. Others questioned whether the rule was intended to discourage LGBTQ teenagers from attending the dance.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf you open the door to a girl wearing a pantsuit \u2026 oh lordy lordy!!\u201d wrote one commenter. \u201cNext thing you know there\u2019ll be a girl in a tuxedo.\u201d\n\nAbsolutely stunning. Beauty. Power. Strength of heart. Thank you Jennie Ellis Posted by Melissa Krueger on Friday, October 4, 2019\n\nVoth, who could not be reached for comment late Sunday night, told \u201cToday\u201d that the dress code was \u201csubmitted and approved by the parents of our community group,\u201d and her role was simply to enforce and execute it.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe dress code issue was a pantsuit does not qualify as a dress,\u201d she wrote in an emailed statement.\n\nKrueger told Yahoo that her daughter, who has been home-schooled for most of her academic career, has attended multiple events organized by the same group before, but now isn\u2019t sure if she wants to go to her senior prom.\n\n\u201cAs of now, Darcy does not plan on attending future events,\u201d she said. \u201cIf she is given a sincere apology and the rules are changed to clearly state that girls can wear dressy jumpsuits and pant attire, then she might consider it.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "17-year-old Darcy Krueger was told that she could only attend the event if she went home and changed.
