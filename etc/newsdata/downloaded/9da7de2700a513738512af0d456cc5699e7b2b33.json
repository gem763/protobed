It failed to medal for the first time since 2002, where it was sixth.\n\nThe men\u2019s national team came into the tournament as two-time defending champions, with a 58-game tournament winning streak dating back to 2008. It also came in as a completely different team than the initial roster suggested following a long list of NBA stars and experienced Team USA players backing out ahead of camp.\n\nKobe Bryant, a two-time Olympic gold medalist, said he doesn\u2019t see who wasn\u2019t there as the issue for the U.S. It\u2019s about how the rest of the world has improved to the country\u2019s level.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nBryant: Rest of world caught up to USA\n\nBryant is in China for the FIBA World Cup finals between Spain and Argentina this weekend as an ambassador. He told reporters Team USA should get used to losing.\n\nVia NBC Sports:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of the rest of the world catching up to the U.S. The rest of the world has been caught up for quite some time. It\u2019s to the point where us in the U.S. are going to win some, going to lose some. There\u2019s just great basketball being played. Whether it\u2019s Redeem [team] two, no matter what team it is, it\u2019s not going to be easy.\u201d\n\nBryant delivered a gold medal in 2008 as part of the \u201cRedeem Team\u201d after a string of disappointing finishes. It began the 58-game streak that ended with the U.S. loss to France this week. The former Los Angeles Lakers star never lost a game with Team USA.\n\n\u2018Days of 1992 Dream Team are gone\u2019\n\nBryant doesn\u2019t think a roster sans headliners such as LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard and any of the Golden State Warriors stars had anything to do with the team\u2019s disappointing finish.\n\nStory continues\n\nHe recounted the 2008 final against Spain, with a Redeem Team of Bryant, James, Dwyane Wade, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Bosh, Chris Paul and Jason Kidd. Team USA led by only two at one point in the fourth quarter and had to pull away in the closing minutes to win, 118-107.\n\nVia the Associated Press:\n\n\"You have to remember, on the Redeem Team we needed a hell of a fourth quarter to beat Spain. That was a hell of a team we had. We still needed a real late push to beat Spain in that gold-medal match. So I say that to say put the best players that you think are going to make the best U.S. team out on the floor, we are still going to have challenges. \u201cIt's not going to be a cakewalk. The days of the '92 Barcelona Dream Team are gone. They're over, so it's going to be tough.\"\n\nTeam USA will play Poland in the seventh-place game on Saturday. The next major tournament is the 2020 Tokyo Olympics next summer, where the U.S. will go for a fourth consecutive gold. NBA superstars who did not participate in the World Cup have said they\u2019d like to play for the Olympics.\n\nKobe Bryant said it won't be a 'cake walk' for Team USA anymore.
