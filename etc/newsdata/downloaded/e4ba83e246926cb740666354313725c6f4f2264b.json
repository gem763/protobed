The president has made it very clear that he\u2019s going to use every tool available to him and his administration to address this crisis at the southern border,\u201d he said from the White House briefing room.\n\nU.S. officials said the reduction is in large part due to Mexico, which after threats by Mr. Trump increased its own enforcement at its southern and northern borders.\n\nMr. Morgan said Mexico has \u201cstepped up\u201d as a great partner, even dispatching a national guard division for border security.\n\nHe said numbers could improve, however.\n\n\u201cWe need them to do more,\u201d Mr. Morgan said. \u201cWe need Mexico to do more.\u201d\n\nHe acknowledged that illegal border crossings often drop in warmer seasons, but said the recent decreases are far higher than what\u2019s typical.\n\n\u201cIt has nothing to do with seasonal trends,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Morgan said it\u2019s difficult to quantify how much of a drop he needs to see before the administration declares an end to the border \u201cemergency.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I could see around 500 [apprehensions] a day, that\u2019s manageable,\u201d he said. \u201cWould I say that\u2019s the magic number? The magic number is zero, but we have to be realistic.\u201d\n\nMr. Morgan also said U.S. officials universally support Mr. Trump\u2019s push to build a wall at the border, saying \u201cit works\u201d and that the president will continue construction.\n\n\u201cThis is not a vanity project,\u201d Mr. Morgan said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
