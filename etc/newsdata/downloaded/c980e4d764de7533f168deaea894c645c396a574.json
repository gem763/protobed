REUTERS/Phil Noble\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Britain\u2019s government plans to introduce new legislation to make it easier and faster to bring home stranded holidaymakers after the collapse of tour company Thomas Cook led to the country\u2019s biggest ever peacetime repatriation.\n\nThe UK Civil Aviation Authority was forced to begin flying more than 150,000 tourists home last month after the world\u2019s oldest travel company failed to secure investment to keep flying.\n\nTransport minister Grant Shapps said he wanted to change the current system to allow failed airlines to be placed in special administration, so the company\u2019s planes and crew can keep flying meaning passengers can return home faster.\n\nThe government was unable to use Thomas Cook aeroplanes and instead had to build what was in effect a temporary airline, using spare capacity from other operators, to bring passengers back.\n\n\u201cThe recent collapse of Thomas Cook demonstrated not only the impact of the collapse of a major airline on both staff and passengers, but also the complexity and cost of repatriating those affected,\u201d Shapps said.\n\n\u201cBeing able to make use of existing assets and staff in order to get people home will help to cut the costs of these repatriation efforts when they occur, make repatriation easier to deliver and also reduce the disruption felt by passengers.\u201d\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s office said the new legislation will be included in the government\u2019s Queen\u2019s speech on Monday. It typically lists the main priorities and legislation the government aims to pass.\n\nThe idea of using dormant aircraft was included in a list of recommendations in a government review earlier this year conducted after the collapse of Monarch Airlines in 2017, which left more than 100,000 tourists stranded overseas.\n\n\u201cBeing able to make use of existing assets and staff in order to get people home will help to cut the costs of these repatriation efforts when they occur, make repatriation easier to deliver and also reduce the disruption felt by passengers,\u201d Shapps said.", "description": "Britain's government plans to introduce new legislation to make it easier and faster to bring home stranded holidaymakers after the collapse of tour company Thomas Cook led to the country\u2019s biggest ever peacetime repatriation.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439848550&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A25Q", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
