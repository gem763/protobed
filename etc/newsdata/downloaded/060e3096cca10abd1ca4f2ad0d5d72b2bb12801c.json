The writhing barbel were too much of a temptation and so the leopard slowly approached the puddle \u2013 planning the hunt.\n\nMs McCurdy said: 'We watched as the barbel splashed and moved about in the pool, in the little water there was to swim in'\n\n'He hesitated for a while and then made his move. At first, it seemed like the barbel were slipping from his grasp as they viciously splashed \u2013 causing the leopard to dip his head almost completely into the muddy water.\n\n'He finally grabbed a hold of his prize, then moved back below us out of sight.'\n\nLeopards are carnivores who prey on any animal that comes across their path, including gazelles, amphibians, fish, antelopes, cheetah cubs, baboons, rodents, monkeys, snakes, large birds, warthogs and porcupines.\n\nThe morning after the incident the group went for another drive in the direction of the waterhole and found the same leopard - identified by the head-to-tail coat of mud - sitting on an embankment in the distance.\n\nHe walked over to where an 'enormous' barbel was lying in the sand.\n\nMs McCurdy said the puddle seemed like it used to be a 'thriving waterhole' that dried up to just a puddle due to the heat and very little rain over the summer\n\nThe group were not sure if this had been the same one that was caught the day before, or if this one was a fresh catch for the day.\n\nThe leopard picked up the barbel and took it to the shade of a Nyala Berry Tree where it could finally feast on its meal.\n\nMs McCurdy said said it was a 'very exciting' sighting, and 'definitely not something you see every day'.", "description": "The hungry predator dips its paws in the muddy water\u00a0in South Africa's Kruger National Park before biting down on a floundering barbel and hauling it away.", "authors": ["Henry Martin For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/13/20325732-0-image-a-41_1572354425960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
