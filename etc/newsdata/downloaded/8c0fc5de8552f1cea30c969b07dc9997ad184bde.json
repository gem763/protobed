Heat water to between 100-110 Fahrenheit, add to bowl of a stand mixer. Add salt and brown sugar, gently stir. Sprinkle package of yeast over the water and gently stir, letting stand five minutes. Yeast will be activated when it appears foamy. Add flour and butter to the bowl, turn mixer on low to let dough form. Increase the speed of the mixer as dough begins to form a ball. Let the mix sit for five minutes, until the dough forms a smooth, shiny ball and all ingredients are incorporated. Remove stand mixer hook from dough and toss the dough in oil lightly. Cover the bowl with a towel and let dough proof for 50-60 minutes or until the dough doubles in size. Using a food scale to weigh and divide, portion the dough into 10 even balls. Before you form the pretzels, add water and baking soda to a medium-sized pan. Bring to a low boil. To form pretzels, prepare a baking sheet with parchment paper, lightly brush with oil. Lightly flour a work surface to prevent sticking. Roll out one portion of dough into a long rope, 24 inches long and about \u00bd inch thick. Holding the ends tight, create a twist in the dough. Gently press the ends of the rope to opposite sides of the center of the dough, place on prepared baking sheet. Continue with the remaining portions of dough. Work in batches as needed. Pre-heat oven to 450 degrees. Place each pretzel into the now boiling pot of water and baking soda. Using a spatula, lightly move water across the top of the pretzel. Cook for 30 seconds and return to baking sheet. Continue with the remaining portions of dough. Prepare an egg wash with egg yolk and water. Using a pastry brush, apply egg wash to each pretzel. Sprinkle pretzels with toppings of your choice. When oven is pre-heated, bake pretzels for 10-12 minutes or until pretzels are evenly brown, rotating halfway through cooking time. Remove and let cool for 5 minutes before enjoying.\n\nServe with:\n\nMustard of choice\n\nBeer Cheese (Homemade recipe below)\n\nBEER CHEESE RECIPE CARD\n\nRecipe by Kristopher Juniel\n\nIngredients\n\n\u00bc cup butter\n\n\u00bc cup flour\n\n1 cup German beer\n\n1 cup whole milk\n\n1 teaspoon salt\n\n\u00bd teaspoon garlic powder\n\n\u00bd teaspoon mustard powder\n\n\u00bd teaspoon Worcestershire sauce\n\n\u00bd teaspoon hot sauce\n\n3 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese\n\nInstructions\n\nHeat a saucepan over medium-low heat and add butter.
