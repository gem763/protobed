Courtesy of the Dunn Family\n\nThe woman, Anne Sacoolas, 42, has since returned to the U.S. She is a suspect in the investigation into the fatal crash that killed 19-year-old Harry Dunn in the village of Croughton, England, in late August, according to British police, who said last week they were pursuing \"diplomatic channels\" to ensure the investigation continued.\n\nDunn was driving a motorcycle when he collided with a Volvo XC90 going the wrong way, according to police.
