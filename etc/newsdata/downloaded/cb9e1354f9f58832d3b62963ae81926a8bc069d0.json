Paul Mitchell\u2019s surprise retirement began with a President Trump tweet.\n\nMoments after Trump\u2019s July 14 missive telling four U.S. congresswomen of color to \u201cgo back\u201d to their countries of origin, the congressman from Michigan phoned a fellow House GOP leader and asked him to get Trump to stop. \u201cIt\u2019s the wrong thing for a leader to say,\u201d he told the leader, whom he declined to name. \u201cIt\u2019s politically damaging to the party, to the country.\u201d\n\nThree days later, Mitchell was awaiting a prime-time CNN appearance when he saw footage of Trump rallygoers chanting \u201csend her back!,\u201d aimed at one of the congresswomen, Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.). Stunned, Mitchell said he scribbled questions marks on a notepad to silently ask an aide: \u201cHow do I even respond to this on TV?\u201d\n\nBut one of the final straws was the unwillingness of people in Trump\u2019s orbit to listen. Mitchell implored Vice President Pence, his chief of staff Marc Short and \u201cany human being that has any influence in the White House\u201d to arrange a one-on-one conversation between him and the president so he could express his concerns.\n\nIt never happened. And 10 days after the Trump tweet, Mitchell \u2014 a two-term lawmaker who thought he\u2019d be in Congress for years to come \u2014 announced his retirement.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here for a purpose \u2014 and it\u2019s not this petty, childish b------t,\u201d Mitchell, 62, said in an interview in early September. Pence\u2019s office declined to comment.\n\n\n\nRep. Paul Mitchell (R-Mich.) walks down the House steps in February 2018. (Bill Clark/AP)\n\nMitchell is among a growing list of House Republicans \u2014 18 to date \u2014 who have announced plans to resign, retire or run for another office, part of a snowballing exodus that many Republicans fear is imperiling their chances of regaining control of the House in the 2020 elections.\n\nAnd the problem for the GOP is bigger than retirements. Since Trump\u2019s inauguration, a Washington Post analysis shows that nearly 40 percent of the 241 Republicans who were in office in January 2017 are gone or leaving because of election losses, retirements including former House speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.), and some such as Mitchell who are simply quitting in disgust.\n\nThe vast turnover is a reminder of just how much Trump has remade the GOP \u2014 and of the purge of those who dare to oppose him. Former congressman Mark Sanford (R-S.C.) lost his June 2018 primary after challenging Trump; he\u2019s now a Republican presidential candidate. Rep. Justin Amash (I-Mich.), the only Republican to accuse Trump of impeachable acts, quit the GOP in July citing the \u201cpartisan death spiral.\u201d His political future is uncertain.\n\nMitchell, who hails from a Republican-leaning district that Trump won easily in 2016, simply decided he had enough. He has a 9-year-old son with a learning disability and remaining in a highly polarized Washington just wasn\u2019t worth the trade-off, he said.\n\n\u201cDid any member of this conference expect that their job would start out every morning trying to go through the list of what\u2019s happening in tweets of the day?\u201d Mitchell asked, referring to Trump\u2019s Twitter habits. \u201cWe're not moving forward right now. We are simply thrashing around.\u201d\n\nThe retirement numbers are particularly staggering. All told, 41 House Republicans have left national politics or announced they won\u2019t seek reelection in the nearly three years since Trump took office. That dwarfs the 25 Democrats who retired in the first four years of former president Barack Obama\u2019s tenure \u2014 and Republicans privately predict this is only the beginning.\n\nMost of the departing Republicans publicly cite family as the reason for leaving. But behind the scenes Republicans say the trend highlights a greater pessimism about the direction of the party under Trump \u2014 and their ability to win back the House next year.\n\nThe president has doubled down on an all-base strategy for his reelection campaign, making some Republicans ask whether Trump has put his own political future ahead of the long-term viability of the party of Abraham Lincoln.\n\n\u201cIf the party doesn't start looking like America, there will not be a party in America,\u201d said Rep. Will Hurd (R-Tex.), the only black House Republican, who announced his retirement in August.\n\n[Texas Rep. Hurd, lone black Republican in House, won\u2019t seek reelection]\n\nHouse Republicans knew Trump was going to be a problem in the suburbs well before they lost 29 incumbents and their majority in the 2018 elections. In a private meeting at Camp David in early 2018, then-House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) tried to explain to Trump why the suburbs were key to the GOP keeping the House.\n\nPublicly, Republicans rarely challenge or criticize Trump, showering him with chants of \u201cfour more years\u201d as he spoke to the House GOP at a policy retreat in Baltimore last week.\n\nDuring a fundraiser before his speech, Trump bragged that he was the reason the GOP won a North Carolina special election held days earlier, according to an individual in the room who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak freely. The president had hosted a rally for Dan Bishop the night before the election \u2014 but Trump carried the district by 12 points in 2016 and the seat should not have been competitive.\n\n\u201cHe has not been a net positive for suburban House Republicans, I mean, that\u2019s a truism,\u201d said former congressman Ryan Costello (R-Pa.), a moderate Republican who retired in 2018 rather than face a difficult reelection in the Philadelphia suburbs. \u201cDown ballot, for the Republicans, you are basically judged by whatever the president does, and not by what you do.\u201d\n\nEven in leadership circles, there\u2019s an admission that Trump isn\u2019t helping the party in the suburbs. No one, however, is willing to say it aloud.\n\n\u201cUnless we figure out exactly how we\u2019re going to win back suburban voters, we\u2019re going to be in the minority for a while,\u201d said a GOP leadership aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk frankly.\n\nThe aide said such knowledge has been driving many of the recent retirements: \u201cI think a lot of members are pretty nervous that Trump doesn\u2019t win reelection. And then we\u2019re in the minority and we have a Democrat in the White House. . . . We\u2019re in the wilderness right now, but if you lose the White House, then that is the extreme wilderness.\u201d\n\nTim Murtaugh, a spokesman for the Trump campaign, pushed back, saying, \u201cthe only people who can find fault with President Trump\u2019s influence on the Republican Party are those who have seen their own power and control wither away.\u201d\n\nAfter the 2012 election, when Republicans failed to beat Obama, the party conducted an internal \u201cautopsy\u201d and determined that the GOP needed to do more to attract minorities. That plan yielded success in the House with the election of two black Republicans \u2014 Hurd and Utah\u2019s Mia Love, Hispanics such as Carlos Curbelo of Miami, and five GOP women.\n\nBut Curbelo, who lost in the Democratic wave last year along with Love, said Trump \u201chijacked everything,\u201d effectively erasing all the progress they\u2019ve made with minorities.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s turned [the GOP] into a personal vessel for his brand,\u201d Curbelo said. \u201cThe president seems to be doubling down on an all-base strategy, perhaps that can work for him . . . but it certainly makes it very difficult for Republicans to win a majority of seats in the House.\u201d\n\nHurd, a former CIA official who would have faced a difficult reelection in a Democratic-leaning district, has been increasingly vocal about the direction of the party. He told a Republican LGBTQ group in June that the GOP wasn\u2019t expanding in some places because unnamed people weren\u2019t following \u201creal basic things that we should all learn when we\u2019re in kindergarten\u201d: \u201cDon\u2019t be a racist. Don\u2019t be a misogynist, right? Don\u2019t be a homophobe.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe electorate is changing . . . and if you\u2019re not staying up to date, and if you\u2019re not talking to people who are going to be future voters, then you\u2019re going to have a problem at the ballot box,\u201d Hurd said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s women in the suburbs, minorities and young people \u2014 those are going to be the key groups and key voters in 2020.\u201d\n\nThe quiet frustration with Trump extends beyond Republicans in swing districts, according to multiple GOP officials. One Republican aide close to Rep. Martha Roby, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak frankly, said the Alabamian decided to retire in part because she was tired of pretending she backed Trump.\n\nRoby was one of the first Republicans to disavow Trump after he bragged about grabbing women by their private parts in a video that emerged days before the 2016 election.\n\n[Trump recorded having extremely lewd conversation about women in 2005]\n\nRoby\u2019s conservative base turned on her, however, and the next election cycle she had to reverse course and embrace Trump to defeat a primary challenger.\n\n\u201cIt would not matter who is president or speaker of the House. Rep. Roby has chosen to close this chapter,\u201d said Emily Taylor, a spokeswoman for Roby.\n\nA former House Republican close with Rep. Susan Brooks said she also has struggled with Trump\u2019s tone, though the Indiana Republican pushed back on the suggestion that frustration with Trump was the reason for her retirement.\n\nBrooks, 59, who is one of 13 House GOP women and the lawmaker tasked with recruiting GOP candidates, said in a statement that she was \u201cready to pass the baton\u201d and sought a more flexible schedule.\n\nInterviews with about a half dozen of the retiring GOP members in the past two weeks found a reluctance to speak freely about Trump and his impact.\n\nRep. Rob Bishop (R-Utah) said Trump\u2019s tweets are \u201cmore divisive\u201d than he would like, but the former Natural Resources Committee chairman said he\u2019s leaving because \u201cthis is the maximum ability I have to be helpful to the state.\u201d Bishop is term-limited on the panel.\n\nRep. John Shimkus (R-Ill.), another retiring member, declined to say whether he had any problems with Trump.\n\n\u201cThe president is the de facto head of the party by definition, but the party for me is less government, individual responsibility, lower taxes, more personal freedoms and liberties,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cPeople come and go. Personalities are personalities,\u201d he added.\n\nMitchell has been perhaps the most forthright about his reasons for leaving. A pragmatic-minded former businessman, he came to Congress in 2017 to work on health care and trade. Two years later, he blamed both parties for putting partisan sniping above solutions.\n\nTrump\u2019s tweet telling Omar, Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) and Ayanna S. Pressley (D-Mass.) to \u201cfix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came,\u201d upset him. Three were born in the United States; Omar, a Somali refu\u00adgee, became a U.S. citizen as a teenager.\n\nMitchell said he always taught his children that \u201cyou don\u2019t stare at people that look different; you don\u2019t assume bad things because people look different than you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe personal diminishing of someone else is destructive to a country,\u201d he said.\n\nAs Mitchell headed home that July weekend, he asked himself: Would the divisiveness get any better?\n\nHis decision was difficult, said an emotional Mitchell.\n\n\u201cFewer than 12,500 people have ever done this. Congress has the opportunity to do incredible things for this country. I worked hard to be here. I love what it stands for. But I can\u2019t afflict that trade-off, that sacrifice on [my son], when in fact all we\u2019re sacrificing is just time because . . . we\u2019re not solving the nation\u2019s problems here,\u201d he said.", "description": "Nearly 40 percent of House Republicans have left or lost since Trump\u2019s inauguration, and privately some in the GOP say the president is the reason.", "authors": ["Rachael Bade", "Congressional Reporter", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Y344dABgnd5opyisPvGR5W-3bdE=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DA4ZCIG3DAI6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
