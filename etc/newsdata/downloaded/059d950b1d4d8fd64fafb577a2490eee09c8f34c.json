It listed the firm\u2019s legal representative as Zhu Xiaotong, Tesla\u2019s boss in China.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.\n\nWhile the purpose of the construction company remains unclear, Tesla has been building car manufacturing facilities in Shanghai since January with an estimated annual capacity of 250,000 vehicles for the initial phase.\n\nThe $2 billion factory, Tesla\u2019s first in China, was a major bet by the company as it faces more competition from domestic electric vehicle makers and its earnings have been hit by increased tariffs on U.S. imports.", "description": "U.S. electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc has registered a construction company in China, a business registration filing shows, the latest sign Tesla is pushing ahead with its plans in the world's biggest auto market.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435951193&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9035L", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
