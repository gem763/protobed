Johnson a \u201cbig fool\u201d for leading America deeper into the Vietnam War. The song has a platoon fording a river that goes from knee deep to neck deep in the Big Muddy -- \u201cand the big fool says to push on.\u201d\n\nForty years later, in 2008, an 8-year-old in Adair Park in Atlanta\u2019s Westside had a bicycle that needed new tires and tubes. Tim O\u2019Mara, who owned a video production company, and his wife Becky, who worked at a local church, wanted to be good neighbors. They offered to fix the bike if the girl would do chores in their yard.\n\nShe worked so diligently that she ended up with a new bike -- and soon children throughout the neighborhood wanted the same. Before long children learning how to repair and assemble bicycles filled the O\u2019Mara driveway on Saturdays. Five years later Tim and Becky had created a bike shop and gone all-in on a nonprofit that became WORLD\u2019s Southeast Region Hope Award winner in 2013.\n\nBy itself that might look like a cute tale about a ministry, but the story of Bearings Bike Shop is more than that. During the past half-century American education has become one-dimensional: Every student is supposed to attend college, even though most students are not inclined to sit in a classroom and discuss abstractions.\n\nNationally, one-fourth of high-school freshmen now fail to graduate in four years. Half of students who start college drop out during or after their first year. Others hang around, often learning little but piling up debt. Meanwhile, the United States faces a skills gap. Young workers who gain the skills and self-discipline to become technicians and mechanics can readily move from poverty to the middle class. Nevertheless, many liberal politicians and their National Education Association funders are big fools who demand \u201ccollege for all.\u201d\n\nAtlanta\u2019s Westside is typical in that regard: Becky O\u2019Mara says students without academic aptitude \u201care told that college is the path ... you feel like a failure.\u201d Tim O\u2019Mara has seen how accomplishments change self-perception: \u201cWhen you give a kid a bike and you start building things for the first time, they\u2019re like, I can\u2019t do this. And then we do it piece by piece. They learn those pieces and then they build a whole bike and all of a sudden their confidence really takes off.\u201d\n\nI saw at Bearings the wall charts that show day by day whether students take care of their tools, show up on time, and display the other \u201csoft skills\u201d future employees will need. Using donated bikes of varying quality, kids who stick with the program also gain \u201chard skills,\u201d becoming accomplished mechanics with skills transferable to other tasks. About 250 students participated in the program last year.\n\nAs students work, they listen to Christian rap and through that, along with spoken-word CDs, many encounter the gospel. Bearings has also seen tragedies. The little girl who earned the first bicycle has had numerous problems. One Bearings regular grew up with a single mom, a dad in jail, a sister who had her first child at age 14, and a younger brother killed this past March. Still, he\u2019s now working with a small-business owner outfitting camper vans.\n\nJames Garfield, president in 1881 when American colleges were just starting to turn into German-style universities, defined an ideal college as theologian \u201cMark Hopkins on one end of a log and a student on the other.\u201d We can improve American education for students with mechanical rather than academic aptitude: How about an O\u2019Mara fixing one wheel of a bicycle and a student fixing the other?\n\nClassical Christian schools have been a wonderful innovation of the past three decades. Christian mechanics schools and training programs are rare. If you know of a good nonprofit one, please nominate it for next year\u2019s Hope Awards by writing to ckoh@wng.org.
