It\u2019s something that\u2019s always a possibility throughout this month in this part of the world. A couple have already skipped past Japan, but this could come into play over the weekend.\u200b\n\n\u201cThe Ireland game cannot be postponed, it has to be played that day. If it cannot be played that day then it\u2019s two points for each team. Whether it can be played in another venue, I\u2019m not too sure.\u201d\u200b\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve obviously got Japan in the back of our minds but the front of our minds is all about Russia and delivering a winning performance and getting a bonus point. It\u2019s important we build on the momentum that we created against Samoa. If we don\u2019t get a bonus point then the challenge against Japan is even more difficult. If we don\u2019t win against Russia, we are out of the tournament.", "description": "What is it?", "authors": ["Telegraph Sport", "Brian Moore", "Daniel Schofield", "Mick Cleary"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/rugby-world-cup/2019/10/08/TELEMMGLPICT000211460567-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
