Cronos Group Inc.\u2019s estimates range from a loss of $1.40 to a profit of $2.14.\n\nBy comparison, the average spread for consumer staples is 27 cents and the average spread for energy is 79 cents.\n\nIt\u2019s an indication of how difficult it is to get a handle on the outlook for an emerging sector when there\u2019s still plenty of uncertainty about what the future holds, said Greg Taylor, chief investment officer at Purpose Investments Inc. and manager of the Purpose Marijuana Opportunities Fund.\n\n\u201cA lot of these companies rushed out to become public and are really learning on the fly about how to do a lot of things, and one of those is how to handle expectations,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re an analyst it\u2019s hard to have a ton of confidence in guidance, or you might not be getting any guidance at all.\u201d\n\nHexo Stumble\n\nThat uncertainty has taken a toll on valuations. Pot stocks have lost more than half their value since their highs earlier this year, with the Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index ETF down about 53 per cent since March 19.\n\nHexo Corp., for example, recently cut its fiscal fourth-quarter revenue guidance to a range of $14.5 million to $16.5 million after previously saying it would double from the third-quarter level of $13 million. It also withdrew its fiscal 2020 guidance for $400 million in sales and announced Thursday it would cut about 200 of its 822 staff members.\n\nAnalysts who cover Hexo have steadily cut their average earnings per share outlook for the current year, from a loss of 7.6 cents in January to a loss of 21 cents today.\n\n\u201cThis is a sector that\u2019s relatively new and a lot of the analysts who have been bullish over the last year have been burned already,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re getting a wider range \u2014 you might get a few who are still newer to the names and want to take a risk, but most have been so disappointed with the recent performance that they\u2019ve put lower expectations in their models.\u201d\n\nBloomberg.com", "description": "During a year in which pot stocks have cratered, the outlook for earnings has become hazier than almost any other sector", "authors": ["Kristine Owram", "Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/canopy.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
