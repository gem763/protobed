Elijah Cummings, D-Md., who died on Oct. 17 at age 68.\n\nBarack Obama was among them.\n\n\u201cElijah Cummings came from good soil,\u201d the former president said at the service, which was held at New Psalmist Baptist Church in Baltimore. \u201cAnd in this sturdy frame, goodness took root.\u201d\n\nObama pointed out that Cummings was the son of sharecroppers.\n\n\u201cThey were the proverbial salt of the earth,\u201d he said. \u201cThey passed on that strength and that grit but also that kindness and that faith to their son.\u201d\n\nObama recalled meeting Cummings\u2019s mother, Ruth.\n\n\u201cShe told me she prayed for me every day. And I knew it was true,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes people say they\u2019re praying for you, and you don\u2019t know. They might be praying about you, but you don\u2019t know if they\u2019re praying for you. But I knew Miss Ruth was telling the truth.\u201d\n\nFormer President Barack Obama speaks at the funeral for Rep. Elijah Cummings in Baltimore on Friday.

But Elijah Cummings was honorable before he was elected to office. There's a difference.\"\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton, who spoke before Obama, said Cummings\u2019s legacy will be \u201chow ardently he honored his oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Cummings became the first African-American lawmaker to lie in state in the Capitol.\n\n\u201cElijah brought people together,\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said. \u201cYesterday\u2019s service was very bipartisan. In fact, it took bipartisan agreement for Elijah to lie in repose on the same catafalque that Abraham Lincoln lay in repose.\u201d\n\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was the first to deliver a eulogy at the service. She remembered Cummings as \u201ca great man, a moral leader and a friend.\u201d\n\nClinton compared Cummings to the Prophet Elijah from the Old Testament.\n\n\u201cLike the prophet, our Elijah could call down fire from heaven,\u201d she said. \u201cBut he also prayed and worked for healing.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe liked to remind all of us that you can\u2019t get so caught up in who you are fighting that you forget what you are fighting for,\u201d Clinton added. \u201cEven his political adversaries recognized that it wasn\u2019t really about politics for our Elijah. He led from his soul.\u201d\n\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton speaks during the funeral service.

Thomas Sr. explained that the speakers had been chosen by Cummings himself.\n\n\u201cElijah wrote his funeral program and determined who he wanted to do what,\u201d he said to the assembled dignitaries. \u201cSome of you may be wondering why you are not doing anything, so I wanted to give you clarity.\u201d\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more coverage from Yahoo News:", "description": "Former presidents and world leaders delivered powerful eulogies at the funeral for Rep.
