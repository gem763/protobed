But when it comes to, like, traveling on a plane... [the] 12-year-old? My favorite,\" she joked. \"When it comes to dressing yourself, he can dress himself -- [the twins] they don't even know how to say 'shirt.'\"\n\nThe actress also said those taking issue with her comments \"need to relax.\"\n\n\"He's my favorite for many reasons, but that doesn't mean that I don't genuinely love all three of my boys,\" she said.", "description": "Jaime Pressly shared a post earlier this month labeling her oldest son as her", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/jaime-pressly-gty-aa-191016_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
