My assignment was preventing rogue states and terrorists from getting nuclear weapons. You name a hot spot, I lived it. [images of Iran, Iraq, Syria, Pakistan and North Korea] Then Dick Cheney\u2019s chief of staff took revenge against my husband and leaked my identity. His name: Scooter Libby. Guess who pardoned him last year? [image of President Trump]\u201d\n\n\u2014 Valerie Plame, voice-over in a video ad, released Sept. 9, 2019\n\nPlame, who was at the center of a noteworthy controversy during the George W. Bush administration, is running to win the Democratic nomination for a House seat representing a strongly Democratic district in New Mexico. In this slick and compelling ad, she tells the story that made her famous while showing off some fancy driving skills.\n\nThe ad strongly suggests that Plame was an undercover operative in places such as Iran and North Korea, when that was not the case. Plame, however, was operations chief at the Joint Task Force on Iraq of the Counterproliferation Division of the CIA\u2019s clandestine operations directorate when her name was publicly disclosed in a column written by Robert Novak and published in The Washington Post on July 14, 2003.\n\nBut was Scooter Libby, Vice President Richard B. Cheney\u2019s chief of staff, the source of the leak? Libby was convicted of perjury and lying to the FBI during its investigation, but he was not charged with leaking Plame\u2019s name.\n\n(Note: the writer of this fact check testified as a defense witness for Libby during his trial.)\n\nThe Facts\n\nDuring his State of the Union address in 2003, President Bush said 16 fateful words: \u201cThe British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa.\u201d\n\nThat later turned out to be very wrong.\n\nOn May 6, 2003, New York Times columnist Nicholas D. Kristof wrote: \u201cI'm told by a person involved in the Niger caper that more than a year ago the vice president's office asked for an investigation of the uranium deal, so a former U.S. ambassador to Africa was dispatched to Niger. In February 2002, according to someone present at the meetings, that envoy reported to the C.I.A. and State Department that the information was unequivocally wrong and that the documents had been forged.\u201d\n\nThat ambassador was Joseph Wilson, Plame\u2019s husband. Wilson was a source for Kristof and also Post reporter Walter Pincus, who wrote in more detail about Wilson\u2019s trip on June 12, 2003, without identifying him. It later turned out that Wilson had misled reporters about having made conclusions about the forged documents in making his report to the CIA.\n\nOn July 6, 2003, Wilson publicly identified himself in an opinion article for the New York Times: \u201cWhat I Didn\u2019t Find in Africa.\u201d\n\nBehind the scenes, Cheney\u2019s office was freaking out, especially over the reference in Kristof\u2019s column that suggested that Cheney\u2019s office had ordered the trip. When Pincus came calling with questions, the office got especially antsy. On May 29, 2003, according to Libby\u2019s indictment, Libby contacted undersecretary of state Marc Grossman and asked for more information on the trip. (The results of Wilson\u2019s trip had not been transmitted to the vice president\u2019s office.)\n\nBy June 12, Grossman had told Libby that Wilson\u2019s wife worked at the CIA and was involved in planning the trip. This was placed in a memo that was later repackaged for Secretary of State Colin Powell. Meanwhile, Cheney told Libby that Plame worked in counterproliferation at the CIA.\n\nThe memo, marked secret, was later declassified and contained this line: \u201cIn a February 19, 2002, meeting convened by Valerie Wilson, a CIA WMD manager, and the wife of Joe Wilson, he previewed his plans and rationale for going to Niger.\u201d The paragraph mentioning Plame is marked \u201cS/NF,\u201d meaning it was classified and could not be revealed to foreign nationals, but it\u2019s unclear if this designation specifically referred to Plame\u2019s role.\n\n(Wilson, in her memoir \u201cFair Game,\u201d says a colleague suggested having her husband check out the information and that she simply conveyed the request and introduced him to her colleagues.)\n\nThe memo written at the State Department circulated among top officials. After Pincus\u2019s article appeared, Post reporter Bob Woodward interviewed Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage, who told him Wilson\u2019s wife sent him to Niger and works on WMD at the CIA. But Woodward didn\u2019t write about it.\n\nThe indictment says that on June 23, Libby told New York Times reporter Judith Miller that he believed Wilson\u2019s wife worked at the CIA. That narrative was later thrown in doubt when Miller later recanted her testimony at the trial, which was damaging to Libby\u2019s case, as she was the only reporter who had claimed Libby volunteered information about Plame. (Miller\u2019s retraction led to Libby getting his law license back well before he was pardoned by Trump.)\n\nOn July 7, Libby had lunch with White House spokesman Ari Fleischer and told him that Wilson\u2019s wife worked at the CIA, indicating the subject was not widely known but not suggesting it was classified, Fleischer testified at the trial. That same day, Fleischer acknowledged to reporters that the 16 words in Bush\u2019s speech were \u201cincorrect.\u201d\n\nSo Libby was clearly talking about Wilson and Plame\u2019s possible role in his trip, at least within the administration. But the leak that tipped the soup came from elsewhere.\n\nOn July 8, Armitage told columnist Robert Novak that Wilson\u2019s wife worked for CIA on weapons of mass destruction and suggested her husband for the mission. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I may be the guy who caused this whole thing,\u201d Armitage later told a colleague. \u201cI may have been the leaker. I talked to Novak.\u201d\n\nNovak confirmed the tip with senior White House aide Karl Rove on July 9. \u201cI\u2019ve heard that,\u201d Rove replies. (Rove\u2019s source was apparently Libby.) Novak then rounded out his reporting with a conversation with a CIA spokesman, Bill Harlow. Novak testified at the trial that Libby never discussed Plame with him in their conversations.\n\nOn July 14, Novak\u2019s column is published in The Post and includes this passage:\n\nWilson never worked for the CIA, but his wife, Valerie Plame, is an agency operative on weapons of mass destruction. Two senior administration officials told me that Wilson\u2019s wife suggested sending him to Niger to investigate the Italian report. The CIA says its counterproliferation officials selected Wilson and asked his wife to contact him.\n\nNovak\u2019s column caused a stir, especially after David Corn in the Nation labeled it a \u201cWhite House Smear\u201d and Newsday published an article on July 22 titled \u201cColumnist Blows CIA Agent\u2019s Cover,\u201d saying administration officials violated the law by disclosing her name. (The links, unfortunately, are dead.)\n\nRove also told Matthew Cooper of Time magazine on July 11 that Wilson\u2019s wife worked at the CIA on WMD and authorized Wilsons\u2019s trip; Libby said in a conversation with Cooper on July 12 that he had heard reporters were saying Wilson\u2019s wife worked at the CIA, which Cooper took as confirmation.\n\nMeanwhile, Fleischer disclosed Plame\u2019s employment to NBC\u2019s David Gregory and other reporters, including Pincus (who did not publish anything). Fleischer said at the trial no one directed him to spread the word about Plame. \u201cI made the judgment on my own to say that to the press,\u201d he said. (Pincus testified that Fleischer told him about Plame, but Fleischer said he did not recall doing so.)\n\nTime, on July 17, published an article \u2014 titled \u201cA War on Wilson?\u201d \u2014 that mentioned that Plame is a CIA official, crediting Novak for being first with the information.\n\nLibby was charged and convicted of misleading investigators about his conversations with reporters, in particular a claim that he received information about Plame from NBC\u2019s Tim Russert. But the only article that directly can be traced to Libby is the item in Time magazine \u2014 in which Libby said he only tangentially confirmed information already obtained by the reporter \u2014 and the jury acquitted Libby on the charge of lying about what he told Cooper.\n\n\u201cFrom his trial, it was clear that Libby gave Valerie\u2019s name to New York Times reporter Judith Miller,\u201d said Plame spokesman Daniel Garcia. \u201cPlease recall that Scooter Libby was convicted of obstruction of justice because he attempted to hide information from the prosecutors. He obstructed justice, perjured himself and was held accountable until Donald Trump pardoned him. No one suggested he leaked it.\u201d\n\nThe Pinocchio Test\n\nPlame\u2019s name and CIA role was first disclosed in Robert Novak\u2019s column. Novak\u2019s original source was Armitage, and his confirming sources were Rove and a CIA spokesman. Novak\u2019s column led to the firestorm that launched a federal investigation. But no evidence shows that Libby disclosed Plame\u2019s role to Novak.\n\nAdministration officials were certainly eager to try to discredit Wilson, who had emerged as a damaging critic about the failed search to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. One can possibly draw a fuzzy line from Libby\u2019s inquiries about Wilson\u2019s role, the subsequent State Department report and Libby\u2019s conversations with administration officials to the eventual leak of Plame\u2019s name. The possible seeding of the leak is what keeps this statement from being a Four-Pinocchio claim.\n\nPlame earns Three Pinocchios.\n\nThree Pinocchios\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter\n\nThe Fact Checker is a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network code of principles", "description": "Libby, chief of staff to vice president Cheney, was convicted of perjury, but he was not the source of the article that first disclosed a CIA operative's name.", "authors": ["Glenn Kessler", "The Fact Checker", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/myprJxoIDCEwlbbgMEFzLbYyB2g=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2MZ6TIVFLBFNHJXPM7JIONYPKI.png", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
