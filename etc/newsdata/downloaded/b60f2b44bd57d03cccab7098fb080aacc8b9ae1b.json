Before the latest Kavanaugh kerfuffle, I would have agreed.\n\nAfter the latest Kavanaugh kerfuffle, I think this probably won\u2019t matter.\n\nThese would be completely anodyne comments coming from a judge in any other administration, but Trump is Trump.\n\nIn comments Saturday at a panel at William & Mary Law School, Judge Barrett backed Chief Justice John Roberts \u2019s public statement last year that judges shouldn\u2019t be seen as ideological mirrors of their patrons, which came after President Trump called a ruling that he opposed on immigration the product of an \u201cObama judge.\u201d \u201cThe chief justice, I think, articulated what members of the judiciary feel,\u201d Judge Barrett said of his comments to Mr. Trump. \u201cThe chief justice responded and pushed back and said, \u2018You know, we don\u2019t have Obama judges.\u2019\u201d\u2026 The moderator, William & Mary law professor Allison Orr Larsen, asked the judges what they perceived as the greatest threat to the judiciary. Judge Barrett said it was \u201cpeople perceiving us as partisan.\u201d While judges differ in their legal theories and methods\u2014and their votes sometimes can be predicted along ideological lines\u2014they aren\u2019t driven to produce specific outcomes, she said.\n\n\u201cI wish it were otherwise, but I think this makes Justice Barrett less likely,\u201d said Ponnuru about those comments. He\u2019s not crazy to feel that way. Trump prizes loyalty above all things and what Barrett did at William & Mary was not only signal that she wouldn\u2019t necessarily be \u201cloyal\u201d to him as a judge \u2014 again, standard patter in any other era \u2014 but she took John Roberts\u2019s side against the president in a dispute that got major media attention. Remember?\n\nJUST IN: Chief Justice John Roberts speaks out in defense of an \"independent judiciary\" in the wake of President Trump's latest attack on the judiciary.

It would be great if the 9th Circuit was indeed an \u201cindependent judiciary,\u201d but if it is why\u2026\u2026 \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 21, 2018\n\n\u2026..are so many opposing view (on Border and Safety) cases filed there, and why are a vast number of those cases overturned. Please study the numbers, they are shocking. We need protection and security \u2013 these rulings are making our country unsafe! Very dangerous and unwise! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 21, 2018\n\nThat wasn\u2019t the first time Trump had worried about disloyalty from a \u201cTrump judge\u201d either:\n\n[E]arlier this year [in 2017], Trump talked about rescinding Gorsuch\u2019s nomination, venting angrily to advisers after his Supreme Court pick was critical of the president\u2019s escalating attacks on the federal judiciary in private meetings with legislators. Trump, according to several people with knowledge of the discussions, was upset that Gorsuch had pointedly distanced himself from the president in a private February meeting with Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), telling the senator he found Trump\u2019s repeated attacks on the federal judiciary \u201cdisheartening\u201d and \u201cdemoralizing.\u201d The president worried that Gorsuch would not be \u201cloyal,\u201d one of the people said, and told aides that he was tempted to pull Gorsuch\u2019s nomination \u2014 and that he knew plenty of other judges who would want the job.\n\nNow here\u2019s Barrett in a public forum echoing Gorsuch\u2019s point about Trump\u2019s demoralizing attacks on judicial independence, albeit in more tactful terms. To top it all off, Politico reported last year that Barrett\u2019s interview with Trump for the SCOTUS seat that eventually went to Brett Kavanaugh didn\u2019t go well, with Barrett having \u201cperformed poorly\u201d \u2014 whatever that means. Presumably it means they didn\u2019t hit it off. Like I said at the time, go figure that a bookish Catholic mom and the guy responsible for the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape didn\u2019t have great personal chemistry.\n\nPut it all together and you can see why Ponnuru\u2019s concerned. For all her strengths, Barrett\u2019s unlikely to appeal to Trump as the option available to him who\u2019s most likely to be \u201cloyal.\u201d Imagine, in fact, that the current Court renders a major decision that goes against him before the next vacancy opens up, with Gorsuch or Kavanaugh or both joining the anti-Trump majority. Trump will blow a gasket. Loyalty will become even more prized to him in a nominee than it is now. That means looking beyond Barrett.\n\nBut there\u2019s one thing she has in her favor that\u2019s very important, so much so that Trump simply won\u2019t be able to resist nominating her. No, not the fact that she\u2019s a woman; there are plenty of other talented Republican women judges. And no, not the fact that her devout Catholic faith appears to make her a better bet to vote to overturn Roe than most nominees. (Barrett might even take offense at that suggestion.) What she has in her favor is that she\u2019s unquestionably the candidate whose nomination the GOP base has concluded would own the libs the hardest. In particular, if Ginsburg\u2019s seat were to open up, there\u2019s probably no substitute for Barrett whom righty activists would accept at this point. If you want to see Liberal Tears \u2014 and that\u2019s what much of Republican politics is about now \u2014 then the choice is clear.\n\nAnd now that righties are newly and justifiably enraged at the latest Kavanaugh smear, Liberal Tears are the only thing that will slake their thirst.\n\nIf so, it backfired completely, since it has only hardened the right's resolve to ram Amy Coney Barrett down progressives' throats when the time comes to replace RBG. And the base would revolt if it's anyone else. So, perversely, the left has boxed Trump in on this. Congrats. https://t.co/IvHiOsUQFV \u2014 Varad Mehta (@varadmehta) September 17, 2019\n\nReplacing the left\u2019s judicial heroine, the Notorious RBG, with a judge who\u2019s cracked up to be the female version of Antonin Scalia would be an ideological triumph for conservatives so total that I don\u2019t think Trump could resist. He\u2019d be reluctant to go with Barrett because of all the things I laid out above, but his arm would be twisted. Barrett\u2019s supporters would lean on him by assuring him that literally nothing he could do between now and Election Day would get them as psyched to vote as pulling off the ultimate Court-related lib-owning would. He\u2019d have no choice but to nominate her, whatever his personal misgivings.
