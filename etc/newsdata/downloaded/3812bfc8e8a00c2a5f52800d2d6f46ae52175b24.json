Photo: Getty Images, Yandy\n\nIt has been exactly one year since Yandy, your go-to retailer for Sexy Halloween Costumes, pulled its horny take on The Handmaid\u2019s Tale from the market. (Time sure flies when it\u2019s a flat circle.) The \u201cBrave Red Maiden\u201d getup encouraged wearers to \u201cbe bold and speak your mind,\u201d even those of them who inhabited an \u201cupsetting dystopian future \u2026 where women no longer have a say.\u201d Just slip into your red mini dress, grab your aggressively ventilated cloak and your Hot Bonnet, the sales pitch whispered, seductively \u2014 Aunt Lydia be damned!\n\nConsumers, however, were not seduced: Many read the costume as \u201ca symbol of women\u2019s oppression, rather than an expression of women\u2019s empowerment,\u201d as Yandy observed in its apology statement.\n\nFor all the offense taken, Margaret Atwood, author of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale and the ideator of Handmaid gear, seemed mostly unruffled. Promoting her new book, The Testaments, on Late Night With Seth Meyers, Atwood laughed off the Brave Red Maiden as \u201csort of the \u2018French maid with the duster\u2019 version\u201d of her story, calmly agreeing with Meyers that Yandy had \u201csort of missed the point.\u201d When the host asked her if it frustrated her, to see someone skew the message of her work so badly, she replied, stone-faced: \u201cI have. A sense. Of humor.\u201d\n\nPunctuation mine, to mimic Atwood\u2019s emphasis:\n\nWith respect to that last bit: sure yes maybe! Although that\u2019s basically me trying to convince you I really am having a nice time doing Twitter. But perhaps the reason Atwood can\u2019t be worked into a huff is that this particular Yandy brainchild, as their costumes go, isn\u2019t that sexy \u2014 I mean, have you seen their interpretation of Mr. Rogers?\n\nStay in touch.
