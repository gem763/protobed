He initially declined to pursue criminal charges, but he changed his mind after discussing it with his mother, according to the police report.\n\n\u201cWhat happened keeps repeating in his head, him being called that word,\u201d an officer wrote, after her interview with the student. \u201cHe said the incident replays (in his head) every day, every second, and it is frustrating. Every time he feels pain in his hand, he is reminded of it.\u201d\n\nWhen questioned by police, Rawlings, meanwhile, said that Frazier\u2014who allegedly had blood on his arms and shirt when he was questioned\u2014was \u201cheavily intoxicated\u201d and that the victim started yelling at him from across the street, according to the report. Police said Rawlings smelled like alcohol and told officers that he was trying to kick Frazier to \u201cget him to stop fighting\u201d but that he couldn\u2019t be sure whether he\u2019d hit him.\n\nFrazier, who allegedly had slurred speech and also smelled of alcohol at the time of his interview, denied to officers that he had been drinking or hanging out at the residence hall that evening.\n\n\u201cWhen asked about the abrasions on his arm, he denied having them,\u201d an officer wrote in the report. \u201cWhen asked about the blood on his shirt, he stated, \u2018I don\u2019t know.\u2019\u201d\n\nThree days later, both Frazier and Rawlings were charged with misdemeanor assault, said University of Arizona Police Chief Brian Seastone in a statement. A university spokesman also noted, in an email to The Daily Beast, that Arizona does not have a hate crime law on the books but that a report on the alleged assault was written up for the federal authorities.\n\nFrazier and Rawlings\u2019 code of conduct cases are being handled by the university\u2019s dean of students.\n\nIn the days after the attack, 300 people attended a protest on campus that was organized by the Black Student Union, which has demanded the expulsions of both men and criticized officers for seeking misdemeanor charges, the Daily Star reported.\n\n\u201cThe attack\u2014deemed a \u2018minor\u2019 injury by the UAPD\u2014minimizes the emotional impact caused, thereby disenfranchising the lives of the black student body at our university,\u201d the group reportedly said in a statement after the incident.\n\nPolice have said that Frazier and Rawlings were not charged with a felony because state statutes mandate that a victim must sustain \u201cserious physical injury, temporary but substantial disfigurement, temporary but substantial loss or impairment of any body organ or part, or a fracture of any body part\u201d for a felony to apply.\n\nThe victim had scrapes on his hands and knees and told police he was going to get checked for a concussion, according to the police report.\n\nIn a letter to students and faculty following the alleged attack, University of Arizona President Robert Robbins said: \u201cI want our community to know that racism, bias and violence will not be tolerated at this University.\u201d\n\n\u201cI write to you today out of anger, disappointment and regret,\u201d said Robbins. \u201cInclusion is one of our primary values, and this is one of those moments that defines us and our community at the University of Arizona.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to come together and let people know, without qualification, that intolerance and discrimination have no home here,\u201d he added. \u201cUnless we have a safe environment, free from violence, discrimination and hate, students will not be free to learn and pursue their dreams.\u201d\n\nRawlings and Frazier attended criminal arraignment hearings on Monday in Pima County Justice Court, according to the Daily Star. At the hearing, the judge reportedly told both men they were to avoid contact with the victim and that they were not allowed to return to the scene of the alleged attack. The judge also reportedly gave Rawlings permission to live with his parents in California.\n\nDan Cooper, who represents Frazier, told The Daily Beast on Tuesday that he could not comment on the report or the allegations, except to say: \u201cThings are not always as they initially appear.\u201d\n\nNeither Cooper nor Rawlings\u2019 attorney, Louis Fidel, would comment on the suspension to The Daily Beast.", "description": "The victim was near a residence hall when two students screamed at him, repeatedly called him the n-word, and punched him in the head \u201cfive times,\u201d according to a police report.", "authors": ["Olivia Messer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1968,w_3500,x_0,y_45/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569351619/RTX12OBY_ufj0g6", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
