Instead, the European champions have been punished with a fine, \u00a3100,000 of which is suspended.\n\nThe issue surrounded Chirivella, who came off the bench in the 63rd minute, and the absence of an international transfer certificate \u2013 required after the 22-year-old returned from a loan spell with the Spanish club Extremadura last season.\n\nLiverpool v Red Bull Salzburg: Champions League \u2013 live!

The club will be liable for the suspended sum of 100,000, plus an additional sanction, if they were to again field an ineligible player in the Carabao Cup between now and the end of next season.\u201d\n\nA Liverpool club spokesperson said: \u201cThe club accepts the judgement, outcome and punishment imposed by the EFL. We believe it is proportionate with the technical indiscretion committed and will be making no further representations. Even though there were mitigating factors, which were beyond our control or jurisdiction, we believe it appropriate we apologise to the competition\u2019s governing body and also to Milton Keynes Dons.\u201d", "description": "Liverpool have been fined \u00a3200,000 for fielding ineligible player in Carabao Cup match against MK Dons in September, with \u00a3100,000 of it suspended", "authors": ["Mark Dobson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e3ee25a616788b4ce8437b73588eb6217f1fdfc/0_63_4368_2622/master/4368.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=199898c5a1e7bf963bacdd7ca123db69"}
