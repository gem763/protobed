Weaver's decision to step down as leader does not affect the current British Columbia arrangement since he is keeping his seat.\n\nThe NDP hold 41 seats versus the Liberals' 42, while the Greens hold three in British Columbia's legislature.\n\nWeaver, 57, announced his decision on Twitter, saying the Greens \"are going strong, as am I.\"\n\n\"But with this great swell of enthusiasm around climate action... I feel it is the right time for me to pass the baton to this next generation of leaders.\"\n\nWeaver said on Twitter last month that he was hospitalized with labyrinthitis, an inflammation in the inner ear that causes symptoms including nausea and vertigo, although he said his choice to step down was unrelated.\n\nBefore entering politics, Weaver was a scientist and lead author on several U.N. reports on climate change.\n\nThe leadership contest will likely take place at the Green Party convention in June 2020, according to a party news release.
