The plan would also get rid of private credit reporting agencies, replacing them with a public debt registry that would not include debt from medical costs.\n\nThe campaign released a statement that touched on some of the familiar themes the candidate has expressed in the past about how healthcare should be a human right and not a profit-making commodity.\n\n\u201cThe very concept of medical debt should not exist,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cIn the wealthiest country in the history of the world, one illness or disease should not ruin a family\u2019s financial life and future.\u201d\n\nAccording to Reuters, the Sanders campaign said the proposed plan would be paid for with a tax on corporations based on their pay for chief executives. And the Los Angeles Times reported that the federal government would negotiate and pay past-due medical bills that have been reported to credit agencies.\n\n\u201cIt is immoral and unconscionable that families across the country are finding themselves nearly broke or bankrupt because of crippling medical debt while the healthcare industry made more than $100 billion in profits last year,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nSanders has long been an advocate for equal access to healthcare and authored the Medicare for All bill. But his latest proposal takes that concept a step further by eliminating medical debt as well.", "description": "Music, Film, TV and Political News Coverage", "authors": ["Peter Wade", "Peter Wade'S Most Recent Stories", "Bernie Sanders", "New Plan Wipes Out", "Billion Of Americans", "Existing Medical Debt", "Biden Calls Female Moderator", "Sweetheart", "After Defending Lgbtq Record", "Professional Climbers Are Laughing At Trump S"], "top_image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/shutterstock_editorial_10416975e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
