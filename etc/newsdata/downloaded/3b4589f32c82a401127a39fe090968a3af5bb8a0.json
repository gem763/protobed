But in the past year or so, some manufacturers have cottoned on to the idea and started releasing devices that can keep up with more than a dozen tabs. You\u2019ll end up spending $500 or more for the privilege, but that\u2019s still much less than Google charges for the Pixelbook.\n\nThe HP Chromebook x2 is such a device. But instead of just presenting itself as a very good Chromebook, it\u2019s designed to sell you on the fact that you can detach the keyboard and use it as a tablet. A detachable keyboard has a different set of trade-offs than the more traditional 360-degree hinge you\u2019ll find on other \u201cconvertible\u201d Chromebooks. If you think you\u2019ll use it in tablet mode a lot, it means you can save some weight by leaving the keyboard behind. And if you keep the keyboard attached, you don\u2019t have to feel the keyboard behind the screen when it\u2019s folded up.\n\nAt $599.99, the HP Chromebook x2 is pricier than most Chromebooks, but in line with the \u201csemi-pro\u201d tier we\u2019re starting to see more and more. In theory, it is designed for a world where Chrome OS is flexible enough and powerful enough to contend with pretty much every big-screened operating system you can think of: Windows, macOS, and iOS on the iPad. That world still has more potential than reality, but in the meantime, the x2 comports itself decently enough.\n\nIn the weird world of convertible laptops, we spend an inordinate amount of time talking about the various ways companies try to square having a full keyboard with a tablet. That usually means talking a lot about hinges, where the guts of the machine are located, and awkward words like \u201clapability.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to solving those problems, the x2 is a little more ambitious than usual. It puts the entire computer behind the screen so that the keyboard is little more than a (thankfully included) accessory for typing. But unlike other full tablets with keyboard attachments, this keyboard has a much nicer and more laptop-like hinge.\n\nIt opens like a regular laptop, and the hinge is strong enough to hold the tablet up at a workable angle without too much wobble. The keyboard doesn\u2019t have much beyond a trackpad, stylus loop, and keys, so it doesn\u2019t weigh all that much. Figuring out the right balance so the screen doesn\u2019t tip the whole thing over when it\u2019s open is a challenge \u2014 one many other manufacturers have mucked up in the past.\n\nThe x2 mostly lives up to that challenge. On a desk, it is completely stable in laptop mode, even with the screen tilted as far as it can go. It\u2019s also stable on my lap, but only barely so. You can tell it\u2019s top-heavy, but it shouldn\u2019t tip over on you. There\u2019s a slight wobble when you tap the screen.\n\nI\u2019m also happy with how the display comes off the keyboard: you just remove it. There\u2019s no button to push to separate it, and you can attach it just as easily. It\u2019s held on by magnets that are just strong enough to keep the whole thing together but not so strong that it\u2019s a struggle to separate.\n\nThe keyboard deck is a faux leather that I don\u2019t love, but it isn\u2019t offensive. The trackpad is large and accurate, and the keys are nice to type on. Unfortunately, the keyboard isn\u2019t backlit. The tablet itself is, of course, a little thicker than you might want \u2014 especially compared to an iPad \u2014 and the bezels are noticeably large in this day and age.\n\nAgainst the odds, HP pulled off this convertible form factor\n\nHP put most of its engineering trickery into the hinge, but the rest of it holds up, too. The two speakers are front-facing, the rear of the device feels like ceramic, and the stylus is well-balanced and accurate.\n\nSo long as you stay in the \u201cChromebook zone\u201d of using a reasonable number of web apps and browser tabs, you\u2019ll have no problems with the performance of the x2. That zone is somewhere south of a dozen tabs or web app windows and an Android app or two \u2014 none of which are heavy-load software like photo editors or video editors. (Honestly, good luck finding something acceptable for that last one on Chrome OS.)\n\nHP Chromebook x2 Specs Processor: Intel Core m3-7Y30\n\nRAM: 4GB\n\nStorage: 32GB\n\nPorts: Two USB-C, microSD, headphone jack\n\nDisplay: 12.3-inch, 2400 x 1600 pixel\n\nBattery: 48Wh, rated to 10.5 hours\n\nDimensions: 11.5 x 8.32 x .33 inches\n\nWeight: 3.07 lbs. with keyboard; tablet 1.62 lbs.\n\nKeyboard (not backlit) and stylus included\n\nTo say a device does well in the \u201cChromebook zone\u201d might seem like damning with faint praise, but I don\u2019t mean it to. The x2 performs very well in that zone, without too many slowdowns or bugs. But unlike the Pixelbook, it\u2019s more difficult to push the x2 out beyond what you\u2019re used to with Chromebooks. Its m-series processor is capable but struggles under heavy load.\n\nThe biggest issue is that at $599, the x2\u2019s 4GB of RAM means you\u2019re going to have to keep an eye on how much you\u2019ve got open. I\u2019ve found that using this with my everyday loadout of ten-ish tabs and apps is fine, but pushing beyond my usual workload is... pushing it.\n\nMore than anything, though, the anemic 32GB of storage really grates. It means you will be depending on cloud storage quite a bit. That\u2019s par for the course for a lot of Chromebooks, but as Android (and Linux) apps become more viable on these machines, 32GB of storage doesn\u2019t feel like nearly enough.\n\nI\u2019ve been pleased but not wowed by the battery life. HP says it should last north of 10 hours, but I haven\u2019t hit that duration. If you use it for basic stuff, you will probably be able to get a full day. But to me, this still feels like most laptops: close to a full day but not quite.\n\nChromebook users have a good sense of what I mean by the \u201cChromebook zone.\u201d The basic bet with the x2 and other premium Chromebooks is that there is a growing number of people who have used low-end Chromebooks all through school and want something a little nicer when they head off to more school or whatever else is next. The x2 is a lot nicer than the sub-$300 devices that have largely defined Chromebooks for years.\n\nIf you\u2019re just looking for a really solid Chrome OS laptop, you would probably be better served by a Samsung Chromebook Pro, which has nearly identical specs but weighs a little less than the x2. But the x2 is meant to be more than just a solid Chrome OS laptop. It\u2019s also a tablet \u2014 and that\u2019s where things get tricky.\n\nI am on record as believing that Chrome OS is not great in tablet mode right now. If you expect that you\u2019ll be happy with full-screen apps, watching movies, and very occasional split screen, the x2 can do all those just fine. But tablet mode still lacks polish on Chrome OS.\n\nI\u2019ve used the x2 with both the stable and beta builds of the operating system, and I can see the company is slowly but surely addressing some of the bigger problems. Responsiveness in putting apps in split screen and generally moving stuff around is already better than it was six weeks ago.\n\nThe HP Chromebook x2 is good, but it\u2019s surrounded on all sides by better options for most people\n\nThere\u2019s more coming, too. For those brave enough to delve into the Developer channel, an almost entirely new tablet-optimized interface awaits. Chrome Unboxed did a deep dive on the state of the tablet interface right now, and it\u2019s likely that all of it is coming for devices like the x2. A good bet for when we\u2019ll see it is this October when Google is rumored to be releasing another Chromebook of its own, possibly with a detachable screen. In fact, if you\u2019re at all interested in a Chrome OS tablet, you should absolutely wait to see what Google announces before making your purchase.\n\nThat puts the x2 in a tricky spot. The software update that would make it easier to recommend isn\u2019t out yet, and it\u2019s possible that the update will come with competition directly from Google itself. And $599.99 is also a tricky price point since Chromebooks that cost significantly less offer nearly as much \u2014 to say nothing of the $329 iPad. Spending just $100 or $200 more can get you a more powerful Pixelbook, Windows device, or iPad Pro.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly possible that the HP Chromebook x2 has found a sweet spot in the middle of all of those devices, but as of this writing, I don\u2019t think it has. It\u2019s a well-made, decently performing machine hampered by too little onboard storage and software that isn\u2019t quite living up to its potential. I hope the latter problem will be addressed soon, but it\u2019s never a good idea to buy a product based on the hope of future updates.", "description": "The first consumer tablet running Chrome OS is here, the HP Chromebook x2.
