That could interrupt the manufacture of a wide range of\n\nconsumer, industrial and military goods, including mobile\n\nphones, electric vehicles, batteries, and fighter\n\njets. Miners in Congo have struggled to secure their sites from\n\nsmall scale prospectors digging for minerals. In June, 43\n\nillegal miners were killed by a landslide at a Glencore\n\nfacility in Congo, highlighting the challenge.\n\nWhen it first introduced ERGI, the State Department said\n\nCanada was part of the initiative, but the U.S. neighbor was not\n\nlisted as a member on Thursday because Foreign Minister Chrystia\n\nFreeland stayed at home for the election campaign period.\n\nA U.S. official said the Trump administration \"remains\n\nhopeful that Canada will join the initiative in the near\n\nfuture.\"\n\nOther nations have invested in the United States. An\n\nAustralian investment group, formerly known as Morzev Pty Ltd\n\nbefore changing its name to USA Rare Earth, is developing the\n\nRound Top mine in Texas with Texas Mineral Resources Corp\n\n.\n\n\"Australia sees Round Top as a key investment into the U.S.\n\ncritical materials space,\" said Pini Althaus, USA Rare Earth's\n\nchief executive.\n\nCanada's Medallion Resources Ltd , a rival rare\n\nearths company, is considering investing in the United States\n\nand on Thursday said it found a way to automate part of its\n\nproduction process.", "description": "UPDATE 1-Nine countries join U.S. strategic minerals initiative", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/STOCK-EXCHANGE-RUSSIAN-TRADING-SYSTEMS_800x533_L_1414427815.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
