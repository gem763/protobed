I get what he\u2019s saying.\u2019\n\nShe went on: \u2018Look at Sam Smith who has come out as non-binary. Piers blames Sam for the Brits axing it\u2019s male/female categories. Listen, I love Sam but biologically the singer\u2019s a male.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s still a penis there! It\u2019s science!\u2019\n\n\u2018There\u2019s still a penis there!

I hope you can see me like I see myself now. Thank you,\u2019 they wrote.\n\nIn response, Piers said he believe they made the announcement because the \u2018splurge of publicity\u2019 would be beneficial.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPiers said: \u2018If 10% of the population decide they are not going to identify as male or female, where does that leave the demographic make up of this country going forward?\u2019\n\nMORE: Barbara Windsor enjoys evening with Matt Lucas as she makes rare public appearance at the theatre\n\nMORE: Lucifer superfan Kelly Clarkson visits Tom Ellis on set as she teases season 5 surprise", "description": "Kerry Katona has waded into the ongoing #FirePiers debate, defending the Good Morning Britain host and misgendering Sam Smith.
