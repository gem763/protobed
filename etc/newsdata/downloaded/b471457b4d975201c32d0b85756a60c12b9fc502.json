The legendary director\u2019s latest, The Irishman, had a lot of things stacked against it in the public\u2019s eye: CGI de-aging, another Mob story, a rescinded wide release, and a 209-minute run time. After bolting to the bathroom, critics who attended a screening of the movie at the New York Film Festival tweeted their reactions to the epic, which stars Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Harvey Keitel. The dispatches confirm some things we already knew, like how Martin Scorsese is one talented SOB, it\u2019s not GoodFellas, and that CGI de-aging is weird. But they\u2019ve also revealed vital details, like the fact that Pacino eats a lot of ice cream and wears \u201cincredible jammies.\u201d Please, enjoy some spoiler-free reactions (notably not reviews!) to The Irishman and decide if it\u2019s worth it to catch it in theaters on November 1 or wait for it to hit Netflix on November 27.\n\nTHE IRISHMAN is a quintessential Scorsese epic that moves easily over three and a half hours without dragging. To be able to maintain that kind of pacing in such a long film is the sign of a true master \ud83d\ude4c \u2014 Tia Glista @ NYFF (@tiaelisabeth) September 27, 2019\n\nHaving now seen The Irishman, I can confirm that Martin Scorsese is good at making movies.\n\n\n\nAlso it doesn\u2019t feel at all like 3.5 hours. \u2014 Adam Epstein (@aepstein) September 27, 2019\n\nAl Pacino eats so much ice cream in THE IRISHMAN. five stars #NYFF57 \u2014 fran hoepfner (@franhoepfner) September 27, 2019\n\nTHE IRISHMAN is Marty\u2019s old man movie! it\u2019s about how you gotta have fifty conversations to do anything and everybody\u2019s got an ego and it\u2019s mostly just people chatting to each other and getting grumpy. terrific!! \u2014 David Sims (@davidlsims) September 27, 2019\n\nalso THE IRISHMAN joe pesci make me a salad challenge \u2014 karen han (@karenyhan) September 27, 2019\n\nYou don't feel THE IRISHMAN's 3.5-hour runtime. You do feel the grisly machinations of mob life, the momentum of some epic tracking shots, the mise en scene of 300 different restaurants, the gravity of Joe Pesci's face, and the agony a life's conscience served cold. \u2014 Emily Buder (@elbuder) September 27, 2019\n\nthe irishman is scorsese\u2019s greatest hits album: a history of american violence filtered through a set of energetic, familiar performances. also, one of the tracks is remastered weirdly and just doesn\u2019t feel right (i\u2019m talking about robert de niro\u2019s cgi face) \u2014 John DiLillo @ NYFF (@dilillicious) September 27, 2019\n\nTHE IRISHMAN: Pacino unhinges his jaw and swallows this thing whole like a python choking down a gazelle carcass, berserker mode king shit \u2014 Charles Bramesco (@intothecrevasse) September 27, 2019\n\nTHE IRISHMAN is not GOODFELLAS/CASINO part 3. Different pace different tone. It is, however, absolutely fucking fantastic and I am floored. All hail the King. \u2014 Jordan Hoffman (@jhoffman) September 27, 2019\n\nTHE IRISHMAN is like a greatest hits album from a master of the medium. Yes, that\u2019s a positive.\n\n\n\nThe artifice of de-aging is more feature than bug.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s not \u201cslow.\u201d It often moves like lightening & elsewhere it\u2019s downright Bressonian.\n\n\n\nThis is not a review! Those are embargoed. \u2014 erickohn (@erickohn) September 27, 2019", "description": "Critics at New York Film Festival react to Martin Scorsese\u2019s mob epic \u2018The Irishman\u2019 starring Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Al Pacino.", "authors": ["Zoe Haylock"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/27/27-the-irishman.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
