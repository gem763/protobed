But it could complicate the already difficult task of rescue workers, who were still searching for about 1,300 missing people. Prime Minister Hubert Minnis has warned that the death toll may increase significantly.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center said late Friday that Humberto was likely to strengthen gradually and become a hurricane in two or three days. Parts of the Bahamas were expected to get two to four inches of rain, and up to six inches in some spots. The eastern coast of the United States from Central Florida through South Carolina could get two to four inches.\n\nSome residents along Florida\u2019s east coast were advised to monitor the progress of Humberto, which could bring strong winds in some places over the weekend.", "description": "The new storm is not expected to pack Hurricane Dorian\u2019s destructive power, but it could complicate a difficult recovery.", "authors": ["Rachel Knowles", "Kirk Semple"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/14/us/politics/14storm/14storm-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
