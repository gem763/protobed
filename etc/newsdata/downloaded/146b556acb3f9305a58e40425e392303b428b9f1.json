(AP) - The Patriots have placed left tackle Isaiah Wynn on injured reserve, marking the latest blow to an already injury-riddled offensive line.\n\nWynn suffered a foot injury in the first quarter of New England\u2019s 43-0 win at Miami on Sunday and did not return to the game. The Patriots filled Wynn\u2019s roster spot Tuesday by signing veteran lineman Caleb Benenoch, who has played in 35 games with 22 starts for Tampa Bay over the past four seasons.\n\nThis is the second straight season that Wynn has gone on IR. A preseason Achilles tendon injury caused him to miss his entire rookie season in 2018.\n\nIt is part of a string of injuries to hit the Patriots\u2019 starting offensive line this season. Center David Andrews began the season on injured reserve after blood clots were discovered in his lungs.\n\nIn addition, starting right tackle Marcus Cannon did not play against the Dolphins as he continues to recover from the shoulder injury he sustained during the Patriots\u2019 season opener. Marshall Newsome, who was signed last week, started in Cannon\u2019s place against Miami.\n\nCoach Bill Belichick said Tuesday that they are dealing with the shuffling up front this season.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re trying to do the best they can,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of them anticipated or had a chance to plan for, some happened rather quickly and you have to react to those. But yeah, that group is a hardworking group. \u2026 Overall we\u2019ve just tried to take it day by day and do the things that we can do.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Patriots have placed left tackle Isaiah Wynn on injured reserve, marking the latest blow to an already injury-riddled offensive line.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Kyle Hightower"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
