Typically, the company releases three new iPhones \u2014 and this year isn\u2019t an exception.\n\nOf the three devices, the iPhone 11 is the entry-level model \u2014 and probably the most suitable for the majority of people. Helpfully, we\u2019ve put together a video that guides you through the new features of the iPhone 11 and its major selling points. You can watch that at the top of the page.\n\nBut don\u2019t want to use your eyes to stare at moving images? Just want some good old fashioned text? Well, we\u2019ve got that for you too.\n\nWhat\u2019s the iPhone 11\u2019s predecessor?\n\nThat, friends, would be the iPhone XR. So, in this piece, it makes a lot of sense to talk about the iPhone 11 in regards to the phone it directly suceeded.\n\nWhat\u2019s new with the camera?\n\nWhile the iPhone XR had a single lens, the iPhone 11 now has TWO. Yes, TWO LENSES WOOOO!\n\nThe iPhone 11 has a normal wide-angle camera, with the addition of an ultra wide-angle one. Basically, this means you can fit more stuff in your photos than before. Honestly, this extra lens makes a big difference, especially when taking photos in enclosed spaces or with lots of people.\n\nAnother big addition to the iPhone 11 is the software. Specifically, Night Mode. If you\u2019re shooting still scenes outside, the impact it has is magical. Colors balance out, the contrast is sorted, but everything still retains that dark aesthetic. It\u2019s a big upgrade from the XR.\n\nOn top of this, the company will soon roll out Deep Fusion (specifically, with iOS 13.2), which will help improve texture, details, and deliver noise reduction in situations where the lighting isn\u2019t very good. So far, the results look impressive.\n\nAnd, of course, the same video features you enjoyed with the XR (like recording in 4k) all still remain with the iPhone 11.\n\nIs there a new chip in the iPhone 11?\n\nDamn straight there is! The chip in the iPhone XR was an A12 and looked like this:\n\nWowww look at this goddamn chip!\n\nAnd the new chip? Well, that\u2019s the A13. And I don\u2019t have a picture of it, but I assume it\u2019d look something like this:\n\nSometimes, I impress myself with my own talent.\n\nWhile it\u2019s not the most exciting update, the A13 chip does bring some serious benefits to the iPhone 11, including better image processing, and battery life.\n\nAnd what\u2019s iPhone 11\u2019s battery life like?\n\nThe iPhone XR had the best battery life of Apple\u2018s previous range of phones, and the iPhone 11 has been gifted with an extra hour of juice on top of that. In my time testing the phone so far, I can\u2019t say I notice a huge amount of difference, but the iPhone 11 can easily last you over a day.\n\nWhat about the iPhone 11\u2019s colors?\n\nThe iPhone XR\u2019s color scheme was bold and brash, with vivid tones making the phones pop. Have a gander:\n\nHow very 2018.\n\nBut that scheme has changed with the iPhone 11. This time round, Apple has included a lot more pastel, soft colors, that feel a lot more modern, and understated:\n\n~ f r e s h ~\n\nPrice\n\nA big benefit of the iPhone 11 is that it\u2019s cheaper that the XR\u2019s launch price, starting at $699 for the base model.\n\nWhat\u2019s not changed?\n\nIt seems important to maybe note some of the things that haven\u2019t changed between the iPhone XR and iPhone 11. First up is the screen, which remains a 6.1-inch Liquid Retina LCD display.\n\nIn my use, this still looks sharp, crisp, and is more than good enough for day-to-day use. I would\u2019ve liked an OLED display, but I guess Apple needs to save costs somewhere.\n\nStorage options also remain the same, with 64GB, 128GB, and 256GB models available. Ideally, I\u2019d like to see the 64GB models discontinued, as that\u2019s really not enough space for the majority of people. But, I do understand the impact of a low price point, and the importance of selling an iCloud subscription to users \u2014 even if I don\u2019t like it.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever wanted to know how you\u2019ll look talking on the iPhone 11, it\u2019s like this.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nAfter a short time with the iPhone 11, we\u2019re big fans. It\u2019s a well manufactured phone that feels slick, polished, and delivers solid upgrades over the the XR.\n\nIf you\u2019re using an iPhone 8 or below, the iPhone 11 is almost definitely worth the upgrade. If you\u2019re running with an iPhone X or XR, you can definitely benefit from the iPhone 11 \u2014 but it\u2019s not essential.\n\nSo, there you have it!
