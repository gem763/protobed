Apple did this not by hitting viewers over the head with the specs of its big tablet or fancy pencil, but through a bit of reverse psychology: at the end of the ad, the young iPad Pro user asks innocently, \u201cWhat\u2019s a computer?\u201d\n\nPoint being: the whole notion of a \u201ccomputer\u201d is being redefined for generations of people who are being raised on (or by) touchscreen devices with desktop-grade processing power.\n\nThe thing is, the tablet market is actually on the decline when you look at global shipments, and it has been for awhile. There are different ways to categorize tablets; research firm IDC differentiates \u201cslate\u201d tablets from \u201cdetachable tablets,\u201d which means you can say that one of these categories has slowed but the other is on the up-and-up, and it would be true.\n\nThere\u2019s a convergence happening, for sure. It\u2019s a place where tablets now have very powerful processors and laptops now have touchscreen and stylus pens. But none of these things make it any easier to say definitively what a computer is in the modern age. People tend to hang on to their tablets longer, and replace them less frequently, which aligns them more with laptops; but slate tablets also run on mobile operating systems, which means few people are thinking \u201cLet me edit my entire feature-length film\u201d or \u201cLet me work on that massive Excel spreadsheet\u201d on them.\n\nI can\u2019t promise that we manage to come to a conclusive answer in the latest episode of Versus, but it\u2019s a topic that\u2019s at least worthy of a good debate. And isn\u2019t that what Versus is all about?", "description": "The tablet market is on the decline when you look at global shipments, and it has been for awhile.
