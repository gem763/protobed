As mentioned in my article last week, 11310 and 11401 were the resistance levels. Nifty tried hard to cross above the 11310 levels but could only close above 11310 (closed 11313.30 on 9th Oct.) just once in a week and dragged down on the very next day. The close given on Friday is just below the resistance level.\n\nSo, what is in the bag of Nifty for coming days ?\n\nhas been really testing patience and skills of traders and investors by its volatility and unexpected price behavior which left retailers clueless and failed to predict the direction.\n\nnow seems to be taking strong support near 11120 to 11170 range which will work as good support for the coming days. Upside targets for Nifty are 11377, which will also be the first resistance and once sustained and crossed we may see further rally upto 11410 - 11454 - 11496 and 11526 in the coming week.\n\nSeveral good and hurting sentiments that may affect the market for this week are 1. Positive outcome of talks between USA and China to curb trade war and USA announced to suspend further tariff hike on Chinese imports after partial trade deal.\n\n2. World Bank slashes India's GDP Growth forecast to 6% in the current fiscal year. RBI also downgraded the growth forecast a weak ago.\n\n3. The earnings season has already kick-started and this week a couple of heavyweights like HUL, WIPRO, RELIANCE, HDFC BANK, etc. will declare their Q2 earnings.\n\n4. October being a festive month including Navratri and Diwali, major focus will also be on selling the performance of Auto Companies.\n\nThis week shall prove to be a decisive and important week and shall give further direction to the market. 15th October could be an important day for Nifty50 as well as . Traders and Investors should wait for upside confirmation for initiating longs. A couple of volatile sessions cannot be ruled out to shake the confidence in weak hands.\n\nTechnical Levels Of Other Important Indices 1.
