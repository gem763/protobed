U.S. District Court Judge Victor Marrero earlier Monday was unsparing toward the president's legal team as he dismissed Trump\u2019s lawsuit seeking to block the subpoena.\n\nMarrero, who was appointed by then-President Bill Clinton, wrote that \u201cthe expansive notion of constitutional immunity invoked here to shield the President from judicial process would constitute an overreach of executive power,\u201d and that Trump\u2019s argument essentially claims \u201cthat a constitutional domain exists in this country in which not only the President, but, derivatively, relatives and persons and business entities associated with him in potentially unlawful private activities, are in fact above the law.\u201d\n\nThe subpoena, which covers records from January 2011 through the present, is part of an ongoing probe of the Trump Organization by District Attorney Cy Vance\u2019s office. Trump argued that Mazars USA should not have to release the tax records because sitting presidents should be immune from state investigations.\n\nMarrero ruled that the federal court should abstain from the matter, as the investigation is part of an ongoing state prosecution. Recognizing that an appellate court may take issue with this decision, Marrero sought to explain at length why he was rejecting Trump's immunity claim and denying the request for an injunction against the subpoena.\n\nIn doing so, he even challenged conventional legal wisdom regarding the high hurdles to presidential prosecution.\n\nThe judge said it may be Justice Department policy not to prosecute a sitting president, but stressed that the policy derives from Office of Legal Counsel guidance, not established law.\n\n\u201c[T]he theory has gained a certain degree of axiomatic acceptance, and the DOJ Memos which propagate it have assumed substantial legal force as if their conclusion were inscribed on constitutional tablets so-etched by the Supreme Court,\u201d Marrero wrote. \u201cThe Court considers such popular currency for the categorical concept and its legal support as not warranted.\u201d\n\nThe DOJ\u2019s position on presidential prosecution was recently invoked during former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia probe, when he explained that he was not making a traditional prosecutorial determination, citing the policy.\n\nAfter Marrero issued his decision, Trump tweeted what appeared to be a reference to Vance\u2019s case.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cThe Radical Left Democrats have failed on all fronts, so now they are pushing local New York City and State Democrat prosecutors to go get President Trump,\u201d he said.", "description": "President Trump was granted at least a brief reprieve Monday after a federal judge issued a scathing\u00a0order allowing the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office to subpoena his tax returns from accounting firm Mazars USA.", "authors": ["Ronn Blitzer"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/06/694940094001_6092681612001_6092685626001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
