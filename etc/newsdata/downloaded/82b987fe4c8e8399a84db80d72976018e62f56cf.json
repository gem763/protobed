A rally and a mystery I wanted to solve.", "language": "en", "text": "The March for Trump, organized by Women for Trump, was more like a puddle.\n\nBut I wanted to mingle with these folks.\n\nI wanted to hear from the women waving the big pink \u201cWomen for Trump\u201d flags or wearing the \u201cWomen for Trump\u201d hats. They are the WFTs. And though others may assemble those three letters differently when describing their movement, I wanted to hear why they remain die-hards in a dwindling minority.\n\nAD\n\nBecause there was no denying it \u2014 the crowd was tiny. I\u2019ve covered 20 years of marches in Washington \u2014 from the World Bank protests at the turn of the century to 2017\u2019s ocean-of-pink Women\u2019s March \u2014 and this gathering was barely there.\n\nAD\n\nBrittany Sechrist, 30, a stay-at-home mom, had traveled from Lebanon County, Pa., to support President Trump.\n\n\u201cI like what he\u2019s doing,\u201d Sechrist said. She\u2019s been to other Trump rallies, but this one was important to her because she wants to stop the impeachment process.\n\nI asked her why women should get behind Trump.\n\n\u201cOh, for many, many reasons,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd that was about all I could get.\n\nBut why?\n\nI asked this again and again. I approached the women with the big signs and hats and goofy American-flag sunglasses. I asked the women in plain coats and sensible shoes. I wanted to hear from them all. Why would they support a serial adulterer who bragged about grabbing women\u2019s genitals and has been accused of sexual assault by multiple women?\n\nAD\n\nMany women can\u2019t stomach Trump. A July Quinnipiac poll found that only 34 percent of women overall approved of the job Trump is doing, compared with 61 percent who disapproved.\n\nAD\n\nIn a Washington Post-Schar School poll taken this month, the gender gap is also wide when in comes to impeachment, with 65 percent of women saying they are in favor of the inquiry, compared with 51 percent of men.\n\nThe women on the Capitol lawn approving of him, for the most part, didn\u2019t want to talk to me once I introduced myself as a columnist with The Post, which Trump calls the Amazon Washington Post in his disparaging tweets.\n\n\u201cUm, no thanks.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not interested.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nCome on! I\u2019m not even the \u201cFailing New York Times.\u201d\n\nThe ones who would talk to me said the same things:\n\n\u201cI want him to know I am here for him.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are standing by him.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe needs to know women are here.\u201d\n\nTammy Wynette lives on.\n\n\u201cThis man does not have to do what he is doing,\u201d Amy Kremer, the organizer of the event, said when she took the podium. She said Trump could be living a life of luxury, traveling the world and golfing.\n\nAD\n\n(Wait. Isn\u2019t that what he\u2019s doing? And we\u2019re the ones paying for it.)\n\nAs Kremer spoke, dozens of women whooped and cheered and hollered, clearly grateful that Trump has left his reality-TV show, his failed casinos, his failed university and all his bankruptcies to run the United States.\n\nAD\n\nBut why, specifically, is he good for American women, I wanted to know.\n\nWas there a woman who believes the Equal Rights Amendment is an old idea that\u2019s no longer relevant? Or a woman who believes it was Melania Trump who brought family values and Christmas back to the White House? Or a military mom who is so glad funding for military child care will instead be used to build the wall?\n\nMaybe, because we\u2019re face-to-face and not anonymous and online, I could get to the bottom of this.\n\nBut in most cases (except for Sechrist \u2014 thank you for your civility), when I asked the women they responded with an attack on the media or the elected officials running the impeachment inquiry. They didn\u2019t need online anonymity to make their judgments, even though most of them didn\u2019t want to give me their names.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSame with the speakers, who talked about the deep state, about conspiracy theories and \u2014 don\u2019t worry, they didn\u2019t forget \u2014 Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails.\n\nRep. Steven Scalise (R-La.), was greeted like a hero when he took the podium and speculated that Clinton\u2019s server could be \u201cat the bottom of the Potomac.\u201d\n\nEach of the speakers looked upon the small crowd and marveled at its spirit.\n\nThe rally\u2019s size, though?\n\n\u201cThere would be a lot more of us here if that didn\u2019t happen,\u201d a woman who drove in from Chantilly, Va., told me.\n\nWhat happened? A conspiracy, natch.\n\nOrganizers said bus companies across the nation canceled the buses hired to bring supporters to the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe feel this was done intentionally and will be issuing a statement at a later time,\u201d Kremer said in a statement posted on the March for Trump\u2019s Facebook page.\n\nAD\n\nFrom bus stations in Pennsylvania to a Walmart parking lot in North Carolina, Trump supporters said they were left in the cold and dark early Thursday, waiting for buses that didn\u2019t show up.\n\nThe president they think they have \u2014 a man who will unite our country and treat everyone with respect \u2014 he hasn\u2019t shown up, either.\n\nRead more Petula Dvorak:\n\nAD", "description": "Why would women support this president?", "authors": ["Petula Dvorak", "Local Columnist"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Ps_Q7lpsharXxbQL-Fo_AXFdhQ4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5EZLB5HRAII6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
