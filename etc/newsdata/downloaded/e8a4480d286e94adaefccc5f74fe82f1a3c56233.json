Turns out the shorts also sold out at the speed of Amazon shipping!\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nGQ, the men's lifestyle magazine, reported Tuesday that Bezos\u2019 go-to trunks from luxury brand Vilebrequin became a hot commodity after the package king made the vibrant shorts his vacation uniform. The French swimwear is a wardrobe staple for high-rollers in the rich and famous haunts of St Tropez and St Bart's. Fashion search engine Lyst just ranked the swimwear in the Top 10 hottest men's products.\n\n\u201cAs seen on Jeff Bezos, the Vilebrequin octopus print swim shorts were searched for on Lyst more than 4,000 times over the past 3 months, while the brand saw a 105% rise in page views this quarter.\u201d - Lyst\n\nThe world's richest man, with a net worth of $110 billion according to Forbes, was apparently wearing a 2018 version of the Octopus Moorea Trunks which sell for a whopping $280!\n\nWhile Bezos' exact trunks are apparently sold out everywhere, fat cats who want to make a splash like Bezos can still buy them in other colors on Amazon of all places!\n\nAnd if you already own a pair, you may be able to fetch top dollar re-selling them on sites like eBay and Poshmark.\n\nThe bachelor life is apparently wearing well on Bezos who only a year ago was mocked after he was declared a \"style icon\" by The New York Times\n\nBACHELOR SUMMER FOR AMAZON KING JEFF BEZOS\n\nCelebrity fashion stylist Kristen Robertiello tells FOX Business while Bezos might be an \u201caccidental influencer\u201d in this circumstance, she believes he is an automatic influencer just by the nature of who he is in the business world and could potentially start capitalizing on that. \"Anyone who has the influence to sell out on something just by wearing it is absolutely an influencer,\" Robertiello said.\n\nShe anticipates he would have a broad reach among a wide variety of ages and gender if he became a full-fledged influencer.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t just be men interested in his posts, because women often look for inspiration when they shop for the men in their lives. - Kristen Robertiello, KR Wardrobe Design\n\nPeople take notice of whatever Bezos does, big or small. He created a stir a few years ago when he appeared at a conference looking buff in a quilted vest, skewered on social media as the opposite of the Wall Street uniform.\n\nJEFF BEZOS' GIRLFRIEND'S DIVORCE TO BE FINALIZED\n\nRobertiello says influencers like herself are shaping how companies do business.\n\n\u201cThe power of the brand ambassador, the power of the influencer is so huge that companies are actually taking away their marketing budgets and reducing them and are reallocating it towards influencers because there is so much power in that. It\u2019s a less expensive way to advertise.\u201d\n\nShe noted that a lot of influencers are just Instagram celebrities, and depending on their following, they can charge anywhere from a few hundred dollars to a few thousand per post. A Hollywood A-lister could potentially charge hundreds or thousands or millions if they are viewed as \u201cinfluential\u201d enough.\n\nWhen it comes to scoring on social media, Robertiello said that people are showing a preference for less glam or staged photo ops in exchange for low-key snapshots, which seems to fit the aesthetic of Bezos\u2019 Twitter and Instagram \u2013 both having 1.1 million followers each.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nRobertiello, also a brand ambassador with influencer platform LikeToKnowIt, says customers are demanding authenticity.\n\n\u201cOne of the big things that they\u2019re promoting now is that influencers who are spending all this money on these beautiful shots and are paying to do these beautiful shoots, that\u2019s not selling,\u201d she explained. \u201cThe number one selling photograph on LikeToKnowIt, for example, is a mirror selfie. So on Instagram, what people want to see is relatable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey want that real-life moment. They want to relate to the person that they\u2019re interested in. They want that quick selfie or that family moment or something along those lines instead of something fake.\u201d\n\nVilbrequin and Amazon did not immediately respond to FOX Business' request for comment.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Amazon king's luxury trunks sell out after summer of love with new girlfriend", "authors": ["Cortney Moore"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/bezos-shorts.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
