Has somebody been hitting the eggnog too early?\n\nNowadays, it\u2019s true, we\u2019ve corralled our spooks and specters within the confines of Halloween, but for centuries the long, dark nights of winter inspired tales of supernatural visitors. In 1963, enough of that ancient practice of telling scary ghost stories during Yuletide still lingered for Pola and Wyle to include it in their lyrics. And even today, the tradition haunts us in what remains the season\u2019s most popular holiday tale: \u201cA Christmas Carol,\u201d written by Charles Dickens in 1843.\n\n\u201cMarley was dead,\u201d Dickens begins. \u201cThere is no doubt that Marley was dead.\u201d When Scrooge endures that spectral visitation from his old partner in chains, the man has been underground for seven years.\n\nBut now \u2014 to borrow the words of another great Victorian writer \u2014 the rumors of his death are greatly exaggerated. Marley lives. Jon Clinch has revived the life behind the famous ghost in a prequel that fleshes out the early relationship between the two old misers in \u201cA Christmas Carol.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhen it comes to such literary pickpocketing, Clinch is a regular Oliver Twist. His first novel was \u201cFinn,\u201d a gripping, often lurid tale about Huckleberry Finn\u2019s pap. Like Gregory Maguire, who gave us the backstory on the Wicked Witch of the West in \u201cWicked,\u201d Clinch creates wholly original stories that snap together with the edges of classics we all know.\n\nIn \u201cMarley,\u201d he begins when Jacob and Ebenezer are students at Professor Drabb\u2019s Academy for Boys, a boarding school even grimmer than Mr. Gradgrind\u2019s classroom in \u201cHard Times.\u201d (Allusions to Dickens\u2019s novels appear throughout these pages like Easter eggs.) With an amusing imitation of Dickens\u2019s style, Clinch writes that the academy has \u201call the qualities of a prison but the warmth, all the qualities of a graveyard but the fresh air.\u201d The founder is a strong proponent of \u201cManly Self-Determination,\u201d which in practice means that the \u201cchildren toiled like the damned.\u201d Alone and naive, young Ebenezer falls under the protection of a savvier boy named Jacob who quickly takes advantage of him, and with that, the foundation of the partnership between Scrooge & Marley is set.\n\nAlthough Clinch relies on the details provided in \u201cA Christmas Carol,\u201d he never seems cramped by them. Whereas Dickens describes Scrooge as \u201ca squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous, old sinner,\u201d that still leaves plenty of room to imagine what he was like when he was getting started in 1800. Clinch doesn\u2019t merely introduce a younger \u201ccovetous old sinner\u201d; he presents a Scrooge quite unlike that flinty Grinch. His Scrooge is hard-working, even chilly, but he\u2019s also sincere and honorable. What\u2019s more, as we know from \u201cA Christmas Carol,\u201d he\u2019s in love with a young woman. In Dickens\u2019s version, we see the bitter end of their relationship, but in \u201cMarley,\u201d we follow the full arc of Scrooge\u2019s affection.\n\nHow this ambitious businessman eventually ends up pleading with a spirit for the salvation of his soul is just one of the questions this novel sets out to answer. Clinch is more interested in Scrooge\u2019s partner, Jacob, who \u201cpossesses a grace that his partner lacks.\u201d He\u2019s a veritable chameleon. \u201cHis coloration, his appearance, good God his very dimensions, seem amenable to modification in service of the moment\u2019s need,\u201d Clinch writes. \u201cJacob Marley can be all things to all men. And especially to all women.\u201d We come to know him as more cunning than Fagin and cleverer than Mr. Tulkinghorn. And unbeknown to Scrooge, Marley is a master forger who has built a vast enterprise of front companies, shell businesses and phony proprietors that would impress even Donald Trump\u2019s accountants.\n\nBut Dickens never specifies the exact nature of Scrooge\u2019s business. Almost two centuries later, that omission allows Clinch just the space he needs to imagine something lucrative, repellent and historically believable buried deep beneath all the fraud and accounting shenanigans: slavery. That clever bit of speculation provides the moral complications the novel needs to plumb the dimensions of both men. Scrooge is determined to separate their business from the unspeakable trade, while Marley hopes to continue draining profit from African captives \u2014 even if he has to hide those transactions from his partner\u2019s eagle-eye.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIf \u201cMarley\u201d has any flaws, it\u2019s that this Battle of the Bookkeepers is not sufficiently dramatic to carry along the whole story. To its own detriment, the narrative concentrates too much on genteel domestic scenes and refined romantic conversations. Inexplicably, a potentially fantastic story line involving Marley in America takes place offstage. Alas, we hear just the barest details of that New World adventure, which gives us more time for drawing-room chatter. Unfortunately, that\u2019s typical of this novel: Its violent acts are related with Victorian decorum; its emotional range is as tightly drawn as Mother Scrooge\u2019s corset.\n\nThe result is a costume drama that pleasantly mimics Dickens\u2019s tone and presents a plausible backstory to his most familiar creation but fails to generate enough of its own energy. \u201cMarley\u201d remains a derivative side story. We\u2019re never chilled by anything close to the terror that Scrooge feels before his own gravestone. We never feel anything like the elation of his early-morning reformation. We never brush away embarrassed tears at anything like Tiny Tim\u2019s sappy blessing.\n\nDickens, after all, offers more than complicated plots and comical characters. He knew the profound pleasure of succumbing to unbridled pathos and joy. If you can\u2019t give us that, well, then . . . bah, humbug.\n\nRon Charles writes about books for The Washington Post and hosts TotallyHipVideoBookReview.com.\n\nMarley\n\nBy Jon Clinch\n\nAtria. 285 pp. $27\n\nAD", "description": "A whole new take on Scrooge and his one-time business partner, Jacob Marley", "authors": ["Ron Charles", "Critic", "Book World"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/w3X0j2TLzIC1Mvydg7DEm56cxDI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2OIPUXHUIEI6TLMLQXRKUAFVZY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
