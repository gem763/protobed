We don\u2019t create enough chances to deserve to win a game of football.\n\nManchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer says it will take time to turn their form around\n\nUnited suffered yet another humiliating defeat on Sunday, losing 1-0 to Newcastle United\n\n\u2018I've got to say sorry to the fans because we're not winning games, but that's down to us starting a rebuild.\n\n\u2018It will take however long it will have to take. It's a journey we've started on and the culture is getting there. I can't give you any time but we're getting there.\n\n\u2018This is not a similar situation to Everton last year when I felt people had given up, these boys give everything for the shirt.\n\n\u2018But confidence is a big thing in players. It\u2019s only results and performances that will give you confidence. When there is a decision to be made they don\u2019t do it instinctively. That has affected us.\n\n\u2018Now we have given ourselves a tough task of making the top six, never mind the top four. We need results straight away to get momentum.\n\n\u2018But we need to clear our head and get ready for Liverpool. This is the perfect timing for an international break.\u2019\n\nUnited return to the visit of the league leaders in a fortnight\u2019s time but, on this evidence, there is little chance of denying them an 18th straight victory, which would equal an all-time record.\n\nGoalkeeper David de Gea appears to have little confidence in those charged with scoring goals at the opposite end of the park.\n\n\u2018This is the most difficult time since I\u2019ve been here,\u2019 said the Spaniard. \u2018We can\u2019t even score just one goal in two games.\n\nDavid de Gea later said that this is his most trying time as a United player\n\nSolskjaer and United play Liverpool at Old Trafford in their next Premier League game\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t know why, what is happening. Sorry to the fans. We will keep fighting. But come on, we conceded a goal from our corner. That cannot happen. It\u2019s unacceptable. Not just this game, but the whole season has not been good.\u2019\n\nNewcastle\u2019s winning goal came during a spell of visiting pressure but, in truth, United had deserved nothing from the game.\n\n\u2018The first half performance was such a disappointment, I couldn\u2019t see that coming before the game,\u2019 added Solskjaer.\n\n\u2018It was like a hot potato, the ball was bouncing off our feet. The second half was better but you could still see a couple of counter attacks coming even before the goal.", "description": "CRAIG HOPE: Ole Gunnar Solskjaer says Manchester United will be doing well to make the top six this season after slumping to another uninspiring defeat at Newcastle.", "authors": ["Craig Hope For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/20/19369250-0-image-a-29_1570390179343.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
