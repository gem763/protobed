It had a margin of error of 3 percentage points.\n\nThough Fox News' programming is often criticized for having a conservative bias, its scientific polling is generally seen as credible. It is overseen jointly by Democratic and Republican pollsters.\n\nThe House of Representatives is currently conducting an impeachment inquiry that was sparked by revelations that Trump had withheld congressionally approved military aid to Ukraine while he pressured that country's president to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading contender for the Democratic presidential nomination, and Biden's son Hunter.\n\nA Quinnipiac University poll on Tuesday found that 45% of registered voters said Trump should be impeached, with 49% opposing that idea. The split in the same poll, was 47-47 the prior week, but was 37% percent for impeachment, and 57% against in July.\n\nAlso Tuesday, an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found that 43 percent of Americans believe that Trump should be impeached and removed from office, compared with 49 percent who opposed impeachment.", "description": "The Fox News poll found that 51 percent of voters want President Trump impeached and removed from office, compared with 42 percent in July.", "authors": ["Dan Mangan"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106161038-1570043665061finger.jpg?v=1570713370", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
