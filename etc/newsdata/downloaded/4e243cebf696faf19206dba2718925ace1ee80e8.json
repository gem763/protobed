REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File Photo\n\nMILAN (Reuters) - Italian prosecutors have opened an investigation into alleged tax evasion targeting U.S. streaming service Netflix, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said on Thursday.\n\nProsecutors in Milan say Netflix should pay taxes in Italy despite the fact that is has no physical presence locally because of the digital infrastructure it uses to stream content to 1.4 million users in the country, the source said.\n\nThe source confirmed a report in Italian daily Corriere della Sera.\n\nProsecutors argue that cables and computer servers used by Netflix amount to a physical presence in Italy.\n\nThe source said the probe had been triggered by checks conducted by Italy\u2019s tax police. Given the size of the alleged tax evasion prosecutors were obligated to open an investigation, the source said.\n\nNo Netflix executive is under investigation because the probe is still at a preliminary stage, the source said.\n\nMilan prosecutors in the past have probed other U.S. tech giants such as Apple, Amazon and Facebook for dodging taxes, allowing Italy to net several billion euros in fines and tax payments.\n\nIt was not immediately possible to obtain a comment from Netflix.", "description": "Italian prosecutors have opened an investigation into alleged tax evasion targeting U.S. streaming service Netflix, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436560104&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF920I1-OCATC"}
