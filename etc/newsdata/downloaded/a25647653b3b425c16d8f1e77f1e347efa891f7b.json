The move has scared away some global customers, but with few alternative suppliers of heavy oil, Indian refiner Reliance Industries Ltd (RELI.NS) has been buying Venezuelan crude from Russian major Rosneft (ROSN.MM). The company is set to resume direct oil loadings in the South American nation after a four-month pause.\n\nSitharaman said the Indian government has expressed its view to the United States.\n\n\u201cIn specific issues which are critical for India\u2019s strategic interests, we have explained to the United States that India is a strategic partner for the United States of America and you want a strategic partner to be strong and not weakened,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe value the strong partnership with the USA, but we should equally be allowed to be a strong economy.\u201d\n\nThe International Monetary Fund earlier on Tuesday lowered its outlook for Indian growth in 2019, citing weaker-than-expected domestic demand. The U.S.-China trade war will cut 2019 global growth to its slowest pace since the 2008/09 financial crisis, the IMF said.\n\nIndia\u2019s gross domestic product grew at its weakest pace since 2013 between April and June, stoking expectations of further stimulus.\n\n\u201cGlobal headwinds ... are getting stronger by the day,\u201d Sitharaman said. Asked about further fiscal stimulus, she said: \u201cI have not closed the door\u201d on that.\n\nNew Delhi has been trying to boost domestic growth through an infrastructure package and a new loan programme organised with the banking sector that has doled out loans worth over 80,000 crore (8.7 billion pounds), she said.\n\nThe finance minister defended the government\u2019s controversial actions in Jammu and Kashmir in August. India stripped the Muslim-majority portion of the state, which is claimed by both India and Pakistan, of autonomy on Aug. 5. Since then the government has shut off phone networks, imposed curfew-like restrictions in some areas, and arrested thousands, including hundreds of local politicians.\n\nThe removal of the constitutional article that granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir will boost the region and the country\u2019s economic potential, she said.\n\nHuman rights groups say the crackdown is spreading fear among the local population. For decades before India\u2019s recent actions, women, scheduled castes, and nomadic tribes were denied human rights in Kashmir, Sitharaman said. \u201cWhere was the global community\u2019s human rights concern at that time?\u201d", "description": "India wants to comply with global sanctions, including U.S. sanctions on Venezuela and Russia, but also needs to maintain its own strength and strategic interests, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in an interview on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441280666&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E230", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
