Most abandoned the country as Islamic rule grew more pervasive.\n\nOver the weekend, Sudanese writer Haidar Al-Mukashafi said on television that the Jewish presence in Sudan dates back over 1000 years, and there was even a rumor in the Sudanese city of Merow that Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu was born and raised in Sudan.\n\nIn his interview, Al-Mukashafi said that Jews and other minorities may come back to Sudan if reforms take place and there are sufficient incentives to do so.\n\nLast week, Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok announced the formation of the new government as part of the country\u2019s transition to democracy, the first since the overthrow of the dictatorship of Omar al Bashir last April.\n\nIn July, the Transitional Military Council (TMC) and the Forces of Freedom and Change (FFC) alliance agreed to a 39-month transitional process to return to democracy, including the creation of executive, legislative, and judicial structures and procedures.\n\nThe new transition team, Hamdok said at a press conference, is currently made up of 18 ministers who will be joined by two more and will immediately begin their work \u201cin a harmonious and collective manner.\u201d\n\nThe new executive includes four women, including Asmaa Abdallah, who has become the nation\u2019s first female foreign minister.\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome", "description": "Sudan\u2019s new Minister of Religious Affairs has called on Jewish expatriates to return home following the ousting of dictator Omar al Bashir.", "authors": ["Thomas D.
