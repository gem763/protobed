I think he is the only one I have. Other players can play in that position but Fernandinho is a clever player and so intelligent -- an incredible guy.\n\n\"He did well the first game he played. Of course he has a lot of experience and personality, and what he says the people follow him in the locker room so it's important.\"\n\nRight-back Walker is another player who could move into the centre of defence in an emergency but, with Fernandinho in the veteran stage of his career now at 34, Guardiola is one injury away from a full-blown crisis.\n\nstr/jw/bsp\n\nMANCHESTER UNITED", "description": "Fernandinho stepped seamlessly into Manchester City's backline in midweek to ease Pep Guardiola's defensive woes but the Premier League champions know their stretched resources will be tested by a physical Watford side on Saturday.
