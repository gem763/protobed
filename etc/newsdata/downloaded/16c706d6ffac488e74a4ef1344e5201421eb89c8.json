'Cause a 'stache is a 'stache. And we shouldn\u2019t let our perfectly good ones go to waste.'\n\nMovember was the optimal time for Billie to launch its latest message about body hair as the month of November is typically dedicated to males growing out their mustaches to raise awareness for men's health.\n\nNow, the razor brand hopes women can join in on the cause by modeling their own facial hair without the pressure to hide it.\n\nTime for change: The ad showed women using different hair removal methods in an attempt to remove their mustaches. At the end, the brand encouraged people to embrace them instead\n\nPriority: 'We\u2019re hoping to encourage women to feel more comfortable with their upper lip hair,' Billie Co-Founder Georgina Gooley said\n\nGirl gang: The new ad comes at the beginning of Movember, a movement followed by men in November to promote men's health\n\n'We\u2019re hoping to encourage women to feel more comfortable with their upper lip hair,' Gooley said. 'We\u2019ve spent our lives going to great lengths to hide them and we want women to be able to sport them out in the open if they want.'\n\nPeople who participate in the campaign are encouraged to visit Billie's Movember team page to donate money. Billie vows to match 100 per cent of donations up to $50,000.\n\n'Since we\u2019re encouraging women to celebrate their own mustaches by joining the Billie Movember team, we also wanted to make sure we\u2019re doing our part to support the cause,' the brand explained.\n\nBillie first made headlines when it released its Project Body hair campaign in 2018 to challenge how razor ads show female hair.\n\nAt the time, the release of the ad sparked conversations about body hair and how it should be viewed because campaign models were shown with armpit and leg hair instead of smooth skin.\n\nGood cause: Billie is encouraging people to donate to their Movember page to promote the cause. The brand will then match 100 per cent donated for up to $50,000\n\nStarting a movement: The new ad comes on the heels of Billie previously using its campaigns to cover other feminine body hair, like pubic and armpit hair\n\n'Prior to Project Body Hair, razor brands only ever showed razors gliding over women's completely hairless skin,' Gooley said. 'For more than a century, women\u2019s body hair was deemed too \"taboo\" to ever actually show. Our campaign was a historic first and has started to dissolve the unrealistic depictions of women in mass media.'\n\nBillie has also noticed more inclusive messaging towards body hair from other brands after it released Project Body Hair.\n\nThen this summer, the brand created its Red, White, and You Do You campaign showing off women at the beach with pubic hair \u2014 which also sparked conversations about females and their body hair.\n\nAnd Gooley revealed the company has no intention of slowing down from its messaging, saying this next year for Billie 'will be a big one' for the company.\n\n'We\u2019re so glad that Billie has opened the doors for other brands to finally portray women in a more multi-dimensional way,' Gooley added. 'We\u2019re happy to be championing this change and excited to keep moving the industry forward.'", "description": "Billie made its mark in the industry by ads showing female body hair.
