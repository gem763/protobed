Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez slammed a commercial aired during ABC\u2019s Democratic presidential debate Thursday showing a picture of her being set on fire.\n\nThe 30-second ad \u2014 which aired on Sinclair\u2019s D.C. affiliate WJLA \u2014 showed the New York Democrat\u2019s photo being torched to reveal a pile of skulls as the narrator, New Faces GOP PAC founder Elizabeth Heng, calls Ms. Ocasio-Cortez the \u201cface of socialism and ignorance.\u201d\n\nMs. Heng continued to narrate while showing what appears to be images of mass graves and piles of bones, calling out Ms. Ocasio-Cortez for not knowing socialism leads to \u201cforced obedience and starvation.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy skin is not white, I\u2019m not outrageous, racist, nor socialist. I\u2019m a Republican,\u201d the narrator said.\n\nMs. Ocasio-Cortez claimed the ad was racially motivated.\n\n\u201cRepublicans are running TV ads setting pictures of me on fire to convince people they aren\u2019t racist. Life is weird!\u201d she tweeted. \u201cKnow that this wasn\u2019t an ad for young conservatives of color - that was the pretense. What you just watched was a love letter to the GOP\u2019s white supremacist case.\u201d\n\nMs. Heng responded: \u201cNot Republicans. Me. Are you really calling me a racist @aoc? I\u2019m calling all Democrats out for supporting an evil ideology. Or are you just in Congress to hang out with celebrities and tweet out ridiculous ideas like the green new deal?\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
