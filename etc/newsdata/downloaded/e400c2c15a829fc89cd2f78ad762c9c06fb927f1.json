They married in 1987, and during their time together had three children: Rumer, 31, Scout, 28, and Tallulah Belle, 25. The couple divorced in 2000 after growing apart.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, Moore writes that Willis thought her acting career took time away from their family, and he reportedly told her he wasn\u2019t sure if he wanted to be married.\n\nDespite that friction, Moore writes, \u201cIt\u2019s a funny thing to say, but I\u2019m very proud of our divorce.\u201d\n\nBruce Willis and Demi Moore | Ron Wolfson/WireImage More\n\n\u201cI think Bruce was fearful at the beginning that I was going to make our split difficult, and that I would express my anger and whatever baggage that I had from our marriage by obstructing his access to the kids \u2014 that I\u2019d turn to all of those ploys divorcing couples use as weapons,\u201d she continues. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t, and neither did he.\u201d\n\nMoore admits the split \u201cwasn\u2019t easy at first, but we managed to move the heart of our relationship, the heart of what created out family, into something new that gave the girls a loving, supportive environment with both parents.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Moore says, \u201cWe felt more connected than we did before the divorce.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Demi Moore Writes About Addiction, Marriages to Bruce Willis and Ashton Kutcher in New Memoir\n\nBruce Willis and Demi Moore in 1988 | Ron Galella/WireImage More\n\nThat wasn\u2019t the case for Moore and Ashton Kutcher, following their separation in 2011 after marrying in 2005. (They finalized their divorce in 2013.)\n\n\u201cI lost me,\u201d Moore told Diane Sawyer in an interview about her book that aired on Monday\u2019s Good Morning America. \u201cI think the thing if I were to look back, I would say I blinded myself and I lost myself.\u201d\n\nMoore and Kutcher split in the midst of reports that Kutcher cheated on Moore.\n\nMeanwhile, Moore and Willis have remained on strong terms. In March, she attended her ex-husband\u2019s vow renewal ceremony to wife Emma Heming.\n\nInside Out is now available for purchase.", "description": "Demi Moore's 'Very Proud' of Her Divorce from Bruce Willis", "authors": ["Nigel Smith"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/IjM0YJ.ug1kSWO9pwOY8rQ--~B/aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/b41f874b5eb817fae1ecf40cf70ba089", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
