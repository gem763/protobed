He was 89.\n\nA representative for Evans confirmed that Evans died on Saturday. No other details were immediately available.\n\nHis career was a story of comebacks and reinventions. Evans had launched a successful women\u2019s clothing line with his brother, Charles, and was visiting Los Angeles on business when actress Norma Shearer saw him sunbathing by the pool at the Beverly Hills Hotel. She persuaded her husband, movie mogul Irving Thalberg, to hire the handsome, dark-haired 26-year-old to play Thalberg himself in \u201cMan of a Thousand Faces,\u201d a film about horror movie star Lon Chaney.\n\nAfter acting roles faded, Evans re-emerged as head of production at Paramount Pictures and quickly converted the studio from a maker of mediocre films to the biggest hit machine in Hollywood, home to \u201cThe Godfather\u201d and \u201cLove Story\u201d among others.\n\nYears later, and with many flops in between, he produced the 2003 Kate Hudson-Matthew McConaughey film \u201cHow to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.\u201d In 1997, he was widely believed the model for Dustin Hoffman\u2019s petty-minded Hollywood producer in the satire Wag the Dog.\u201d\n\nEvans continued the drama off screen by marrying some of the industry\u2019s most glamorous women.
