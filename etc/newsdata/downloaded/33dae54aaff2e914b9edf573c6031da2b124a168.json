Murray was, after all, speaking in the immediate aftermath of a highly fraught contest where he had told his Italian opponent to \u2018shut up\u2019 during an on-court row and failed to serve out the match twice before going down in a third set tiebreak.\n\nMurray rowed with Fognini (Picture: TPN/Getty)\n\nThe fact he\u2019s disappointed at all is testament to how far he\u2019s come. Murray is no longer playing just for fun. Gone are the days where he\u2019s just grateful to not be in agony. The serial winner is back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis was just Murray\u2019s ninth singles match at tour-level since undergoing a hip resurfacing operation in January, four of which he\u2019s won. Two of the players who beat him \u2013 Alex de Minaur in Zhuhai and Dominic Thiem in Beijing \u2013 went on to win the title. Fognini still could, theoretically, do the same in Shanghai.\n\nFor a man who was in agony putting his socks on nine months ago, it\u2019s easy to lose perspective on what he\u2019s already achieved. Murray\u2019s three-week stint in China has unquestionably been a roaring success.\n\nSo dramatic has his improvement been, both in terms of ball-striking and physicality, since the nondescript defeats in the American hard court summer, few would now bet against him returning to the upper echelons of the sport.\n\nThat belief was likely first instilled in many with a straight sets win over Italy\u2019s Matteo Berrettini.\n\nA US Open semi-finalist a matter of weeks before and, at the time, the eighth-best performing male player in 2019, it was a first-round match Murray was simply expected to lose. He won in two tight sets.\n\nAndy Murray's results in China Zhuhai R1: 6-3 6-7 6-1 Sandgren\n\nR2: 6-4 2-6 4-6 De Minuar Beijing R1: 7-6 7-6 Berrettini\n\nR2: 7-6 6-7 6-1 Norrie\n\nQF: 2-6 6-7 Thiem Shanghai R1: 2-6 6-2 6-3 Londero\n\nR2: 6-7 6-2 6-7 Fognini\n\nThere have been times where he hasn\u2019t played well. He looked on his last legs against compatriot Cameron Norrie a day after his battling win over Berrettini only to thump him 6-1 in a decider.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAgainst Juan Ignacio Londero, his forehand went AWOL in the first set only to make the necessary adjustments and win in three.\n\nThe fight has always been there. Indeed, in the first nine matches of his initial return from the hip injury in the summer of 2018, Murray actually racked up more wins (5) than he has now.\n\nAndy Murray was disappointed after his loss to Fabio Fognini (Picture: TPN/Getty Images)\n\nIn the same year, there were wins over then top-20 players Kyle Edmund and David Goffin. Murray, despite often being in sheer agony, ended the season with seven wins to five losses. Even on one leg, his battling qualities alone are a force to be reckoned with.\n\nThese wins in China have been somewhat different. Murray is pain free. He\u2019s not been left sobbing into his towel at the side of the court as he did after beating Marius Copil to reach the quarter-finals in Washington, lamenting the suffering he\u2019d gone through to win. The fight remains but it\u2019s more sustainable.\n\nHis movement is unrecognisable from the sorry hobbling athlete who was desperately clawing at former glories. Watching Murray has become an enjoyable experience again.\n\nThis HAS to be one of the points of the season!?! Incredible from @andy_murray \ud83d\ude31 \ud83c\udfa5: @TennisTV #RolexShMasters pic.twitter.com/Iz0Z10pTG7 \u2014 ATP Tour (@atptour) October 8, 2019\n\nWhether that be with surging darts to the net, the incessant chuntering at himself and his team, the stunning backhand passes, the sarcastic self-congratulation, the yowls as he races to retrieve from an uncomfortable position, the cries of \u2018Let\u2019s Go!\u2019 as he wins an important point. Murray is box office again for, almost, all the right reasons. Even though he probably shouldn\u2019t have engaged with wind-up merchant Fognini, it was somewhat satisfying watching him tell the Italian to pipe down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe exciting part is still to come. Murray is not here to make up the numbers. Gone are the days where he\u2019s smiling about just being on court, it\u2019s full steam ahead with a focus on being fully fit and ready to be a genuine force at the Australian Open next year.\n\nJust to hammer it home one last time: this is the same man who tearfully considered retiring in Melbourne just nine months ago, who has undergone an operation from which no singles player has ever returned to elite tennis.\n\nBut that was the past. Murray\u2019s efforts in China have seen us all look to the future. In Zhuhai he rated his level \u2013 which has since continued to improve \u2013 at world No. 60 or 70, so how soon will he return to the top-50 or, even, top-20? Will he be British No. 1 by the end of next year? Can he seriously add to his three Grand Slam titles?\n\nAll will be answered in due course but the wider landscape is a far cry from the disappointment Murray was feeling on Tuesday.\n\nAs he leaves China, he could be forgiven for thinking this is the start of something special.
