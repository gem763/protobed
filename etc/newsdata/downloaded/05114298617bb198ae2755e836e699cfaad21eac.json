The newspaper cited people familiar with the matter who were granted anonymity.\n\nMastercard had no comment. Facebook and Visa did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.\n\nFacebook has faced regulatory pushback over Libra since unveiling it in June. The idea is to open online purchasing to millions of people who do not have access to bank accounts and reduce the cost of sending money across borders. But Facebook already faces scrutiny over its poor record on privacy.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
