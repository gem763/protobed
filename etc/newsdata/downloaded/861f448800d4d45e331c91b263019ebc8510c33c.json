Kaplan said he had been a strong proponent of the two rate cuts so far this year but now was open to the idea that the central bank could take some time to assess the economy and the stimulus from those two moves. The Dallas Fed president said that businesses were cutting back on plans due to trade uncertainty but haven't taken the next step of actively cutting back on their workforce.

Kaplan is not a voting member of the Fed interest-rate committee this year.", "description": "Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said Friday that he's not sure whether the central bank should cut rates at its meeting at the end of the month. \"I'm...", "authors": ["Greg Robb", "Senior Economics Reporter"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
