It was worth the wait", "language": "en", "text": "The world\u2019s most popular headphones are getting an overdue refresh. Apple Inc. on Tuesday took the wraps off the Beats Solo Pro, the first major redesign of the on-ear pair since Apple acquired Beats Electronics back in 2014. Based on our first try of the Pro variant, the wait was worth it.\n\n\u201cNot one electrical or mechanical component in these headphones exists in prior Beats headphones,\u201d Luke Wood, president of Beats, said at a press briefing in Tokyo. The Solo Pro took more than three years of development but Wood said that the end result represents \u201cdream headphones\u201d for all the engineers who worked on it. Unconstrained by the limits of smaller manufacturers, Beats leveraged Apple\u2019s scale to get primacy among suppliers, devised entirely new custom-made transducers just for the Solo Pro, and harnessed the talents of the same engineering teams that worked on the iPhone 11 Pro.\n\nThe side arms of the Solo Pro are now made of anodized aluminum, adding a hitherto absent touch of premium allure, sturdiness and a more consistent clamping force on the user\u2019s head. This new pair of headphones is still not the most accommodating for people with larger skulls, but comfort is improved relative to its predecessor, the Beats Solo 3. That\u2019s in large part down to the overhauled cushions: they no longer have an inner seam that can touch the ear, their surface area has been increased by 70 per cent and they have 35 per cent greater volume, offering more padding.\n\nActive noise cancelling makes its debut on the Solo line with this model, and it works extremely well. \u201cThe ANC world is really big,\u201d said Wood. These new headphones expand it further by \u201ctaking ANC to a whole other customer.\u201d A feature that was once narrowly designed to appeal to long-haul air travelelrs is now becoming mainstream, and Apple\u2019s embrace of it with the Solo Pro is an acknowledgment and accelerant of that trend.\n\nOne thing that will make the Solo Pro less appealing to frequent flyers, however, is the complete absence of an analog connector \u2014 users will have to connect wirelessly over Bluetooth or purchase an accessory, as there\u2019s no option to connect these with a classic 3.5mm plug.\n\nAmong the subtle but important changes Apple has made in this upgrade is a general redesign to reduce water ingress. Sport is the second most popular use case for the Beats Solo, so Apple made sure to make its latest iteration resistant to sweat and splashes with new gaskets and coverings to protect the precious electronics within. They\u2019re still not waterproof headphones, but they\u2019re much more durable, to go with their nicer feel from the improved cushions and metal frame.\n\nThe Beats Solo Pro still collapse down as before, however now their opening and closing serves as the on-off switch as well. There\u2019s just one button to switch between active noise cancelling, no noise cancelling, and the transparency mode that lets you hear your surroundings, and the classic music and volume controls are still present as clicky buttons on the right ear cup. Apple has rightly resisted the temptation of building in fiddly touch controls.\n\nFeaturing Apple\u2019s excellent H1 wireless chip, a whole new circuit board design and a bespoke digital-to-analog converter, these are the most intricately designed and engineered headphones from either brand. Wood proudly described the Solo Pro as \u201cextremely proprietary,\u201d though it\u2019s a little disappointing that Apple is sticking with a Lightning connector for charging instead of USB-C, which it uses on its iPad Pro and MacBook Pro devices. Away from a charger, the Solo Pro will last 22 hours with ANC turned on or 40 hours without it.\n\nThe Beats Solo Pro go on sale Oct. 30 for US$299, and the Beats Solo 3 will remain in Apple\u2019s lineup for now at a reduced price of US$199. A collaboration with superstar producer Pharrell Williams will see three limited-time colourways \u2014 a dark navy, a turquoise and a summery mix of orange and red \u2014 go on sale alongside the default black, grey and white options.\n\nBloomberg.com", "description": "This is the first major redesign of the on-ear pair since Apple acquired Beats Electronics back in 2014", "authors": ["Vlad Savov", "Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/beats.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
