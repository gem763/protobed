The match was only confirmed at the last minute after safety inspections.\n\n\"The brave performance of Japan Rugby Team, who never give up, will give courage and energy to those who suffered damage from the typhoon,\" tweeted Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.\n\nSunday's victory carried echoes of 2011 when the Japanese women's football team lifted the World Cup, embodying the resilience of a nation recovering from the deadly earthquake and tsunami earlier that year.\n\nAlthough reports of the typhoon dominated Japanese newspapers, the rugby victory featured on the front pages of all the major titles, including the Nikkei business daily.\n\n\"Cherry in full bloom,\" the mass-circulation Yomiuri Shimbun wrote in a headline, using Japan's original nickname of the Cherry Blossoms -- now usually given as the Brave Blossoms.\n\n\"Japan's strength is real,\" Yomiuri said.\n\nJapan now head into a quarterfinal against South Africa on Sunday and their wins, and the manner of their performances, have made World Cup rivals sit up and take notice.\n\nAll Blacks coach Steve Hansen said Japan should now be regarded as a Tier One nation -- meaning the Six Nations and Rugby Championship sides -- after their rise up the rankings.\n\n\"Without a doubt, they would have to be considered like they are playing and performing like a Tier One nation,\" said Hansen. \"They are now in the top eight in the world on performance. They are playing quality rugby so I think Japan should be very, very proud.\"\n\nFrance scrum-half Baptiste Serin said Japan, with their quick thought and handling combined with strong structural play, were \"doing good for today's rugby\".\n\n\"They have an inspiring style, you can see they have self-belief,\" said the admiring Serin, praising Japan's \"technical quality\".\n\n\"What strikes me is the way they have of being available for each other, of always backing each other up.\"\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP", "description": "Japan rose to a record rankings high of seventh on Monday after their historic run to the Rugby World Cup quarter-finals, providing some respite as the host nation reels from a deadly typhoon.
