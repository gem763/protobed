The suspension will remain in effect until it can demonstrate the breaches no longer exist or that the suspension was unfounded.\n\nShares tumbled as much as 17% when they resumed trading following the announcement.\n\nThe suspension won\u2019t change much in the short term as the Vaughan, Ontario based company had already halted all sales and shipments of its products.\n\nHealth Canada, the government agency responsible for cannabis regulations, told CannTrust that it could potentially address the suspension by taking measures to ensure pot will be produced and distributed only as authorized and to recover cannabis that wasn\u2019t authorized by the license. It would also need to improve key personnel\u2019s knowledge of and compliance with regulations; and to improve record keeping and inventory tracking.\n\nCannTrust\u2019s management and board are reviewing the suspension with counsel and other advisers, the company said.\n\nThe breaches, which included growing pot in unlicensed parts of its greenhouse in Pelham, Ontario, led to the firing of Chief Executive Officer Peter Aceto and a joint investigation by securities regulators and police. The company has hired Greenhill & Co. to explore potential alternatives, including a sale.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Kristine Owram in Toronto at kowram@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Brad Olesen at bolesen3@bloomberg.net, ;David Scanlan at dscanlan@bloomberg.net, Jacqueline Thorpe\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- CannTrust Holdings Inc., the beleaguered pot company that\u2019s lost 75% of its value after breaching regulations, had its license suspended by the Canadian government.The company won\u2019t be able to sell or produce cannabis, other than cultivating and harvesting existing plants, CannTrust said", "authors": ["Kristine Owram"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ZRt8OYQUbMUgkvN1A.Irdg--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/3d32bfd3d2ed8be6c0ea0b8f56e7590b", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
