No such thing as just getting it done. Rather, we just enter a new phase.\n\nBoris Johnson 'sabotage' letter to EU 'would break law' Read more\n\n\u201cIf there is no deal, I believe that\u2019s possible, it will cause severe disruption for British and Irish people alike. We will have to get back to the negotiating table. When we do, the first and only items on the agenda will be citizens\u2019 rights, the financial settlement and the Irish border. All the issues we had resolved in the withdrawal agreement we made with your predecessor. An agreement made in good faith by 28 governments,\u201d he said.\n\nVaradkar warned that even if a deal was agreed, the British should not be deluded about the future relationship talks.\n\n\u201cWe will enter talks on a future relationship agreement between the EU and UK. It\u2019s going to be tough dealing with issues ranging from tariffs to fishing rights, product standards and state aid. It will then have to be ratified by 31 parliaments,\u201d he said.\n\nHe told Johnson free trade agreements (FTA) were notoriously difficult to strike but Ireland would be his friend and ally.\n\n\u201cNegotiating FTAs with the EU and US and securing their ratification in less than three years is going to be a herculean task for you. We want to be your friend and ally, your Athena, in doing so,\u201d he said.\n\nJohnson refused to answer questions about the Irish border or when he had last visited it, but said his preference was for a deal.\n\nThe two agreed there would be no breakthrough at their hour-long meeting on Monday morning but Johnson was confident the Irish border backstop could be replaced.\n\n\u201cLike you, I\u2019ve looked carefully at no deal and I\u2019ve assessed its consequences,\u201d he said. \u201cBe in no doubt, that outcome would be a failure of statecraft of which we would all be responsible. I would overwhelmingly prefer a solution.\u201d\n\nWhat is the Brexit backstop? Read more\n\nVaradkar\u2019s words echoed those of his deputy, Simon Coveney, who told an audience that included Michael Gove on Friday that Anglo-Irish relations had been severely \u201cdented\u201d by a letter from Johnson to the European council president, Donald Tusk, in August in which the prime minister rowed back on commitments made by Theresa May to Ireland a year before she struck her Brexit deal.\n\nJohnson confirmed he was moving ahead with his proposal to create a single regulatory zone north and south of the border for food and agriculture. Checks on animals and fresh produce would be carried out at ports and airports, rather than the border, and there would be pre-clearance systems for large, \u201ctrusted\u201d traders.\n\nJohnson said it would go \u201ca long way\u201d in solving the Irish border problem, although Varadkar told reporters on Sunday it would not be enough to replace the backstop in Theresa May\u2019s deal.\n\n\n\nJohnson said he did not underestimate the political sensitivities of the border issue but he would double down to find a solution for the \u201csake of business, farmers and millions of ordinary people\u201d.\n\n\n\n\u201cI have one message that I want to land with you today Leo and that is that I want to find a deal. I want to get a deal,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe landing zone is clear to everybody. We need to find a way in ensuring that the UK is not locked in the backstop arrangements so there is a way out while giving Ireland assurances that it needs.\n\n\n\nJohnson denied not putting in the effort required to get a deal, saying he could not share the \u201cabundance of proposals\u201d on the table with the press.\n\n\n\nNo questions were allowed from British print journalists in a carefully managed press conference that took place before the talks, leaving Johnson unchallenged about Amber Rudd\u2019s attack on his lack of deal planning or the prospect of him breaking the law to achieve Brexit on 31 October.\n\n\n\nHe said he was \u201cundaunted by whatever may take place in parliament\u201d but did not illuminate what this would entail.\n\n", "description": "Leo Varadkar says UK and EU will still have to negotiate, with same problems on agenda", "authors": ["Lisa O'Carroll"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52af26a904ac20bd6792e41ec8b361007a41ea60/0_0_4012_2407/master/4012.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8777986ca71cdfc3ad356364a14bf7ee", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
