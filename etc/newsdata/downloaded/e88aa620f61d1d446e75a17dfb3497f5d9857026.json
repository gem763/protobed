It'll tell you what you need to know", "language": "en", "text": "This week has been a bad week for the Trump administration, even by its usual standards. Besides the usual racism and corruption allegations came the news of a whistleblower, someone who considered the president\u2019s behavior so deeply disturbing that they had to come forward.\n\nAll of this was made slightly more amazing due to the fact that Rudy Giuliani actually admitted to meddling in May in the New York Times when he told Ken Vogal, \u201cWe\u2019re not meddling in an election; we\u2019re meddling in an investigation, which we have a right to do.\u201d So perhaps we shouldn\u2019t have been surprised that the foreign government the whistleblower was whistleblowing about was Ukraine.\n\nLike with any crisis in Trumpworld, the Trump Mobius strip of propaganda rolled out a rapid and slightly insane response. Trump\u2019s propagandists met yet another allegation of presidential malfeasance with a smorgasbord of obfuscation, confession, deflection, confusion, and unbridled hostility.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe morning after the whistleblower\u2019s allegations came to light, the president\u2019s favorite breakfast show cheerfully explained to its viewers that what looked like potential treason was in fact merely \u201cthe art of the deal.\u201d Yes, possible corruption was actually just deal-making! Geraldo Rivera chimed in to call out the whistleblower for being \u201cannoying, this is a punk, a punk who's snitching out the president's phone calls to a foreign leader\u201d. Newt Gingrich volunteered an \u201cexecutive powers\u201d defense. Gingrich has himself been plagued by ethics scandals, so perhaps he\u2019s the perfect person to defend such an ethically challenged president.\n\nBut Fox is just one of the many arms in the president\u2019s propaganda octopus. The Gateway Pundit asked: \u201cWhat would a Deep State hit be without Hillary Clinton, the most crooked woman in Washington DC?\u201d Wait, what? Yes, this publication managed to spin the whistleblower allegation into an indictment of Hillary Clinton. Another Trumpy news site called Amgreatness argued that the president can do whatever he wants because of the constitution. I'm not a constitutional scholar but I\u2019m going to go out on a limb here and say: no, no he can\u2019t.\n\nBut no one shills for the president quite like the members of his own party, and Missouri Senator Josh Hawley is always happy to go on Fox News and blame \u201canother deep state attack\u201d on whatever\u2019s got the president into trouble this time. Likewise, Tennessee\u2019s Marsha Blackburn blamed the Democrats for the whistleblower, saying, \"You will never see the attacks stopped. The left will not give up because they cannot even accept the fact that they lost.\" All of this is made sillier by the fact that none of these people know who the whistleblower is.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

John McCain, of course, is well-known as the one member of the Republican Party who stood up to Trump before he died of brain cancer. His daughter, Meghan, has been somewhat critical of the president \u2014 but not today. Today she somehow conflated Assange and the whistleblower by making an odd defensive argument in favor of Trump. Specifically, she said: \u201cThere are liberals who were fine with Assange\u2019s leaks but are screaming bloody murder right now about this whistleblower.\u201d It\u2019s not clear what the connection is between this whistleblower and WikiLeaks (unless Meghan McCain knows something the rest of us don\u2019t) but it sure functioned as another valiant attempt to shift blame away from the president of the United States.\n\nTrump\u2019s post-crisis news cycles are in some ways the most enlightening: they show us just how in bed the Republican Party is with him. The president\u2019s defenders will die on all the hills for their leader, and the strategies are becoming wearingly obvious. First, they will start by denying or ignoring something, or by saying that the president was just joking and you\u2019re not supposed to take him literally or figuratively or in whatever way you did. Then, sooner or later, they almost always get around to the defense that if a crime is committed by the president of the United States, it\u2019s not really a crime at all (this rationale was also used by Nixon.)\n\nThe idea that the president gets a pass to commit crimes because he\u2019s the president or because they aren\u2019t really crimes when he does them is some really impressive thought jujitsu. But the even more impressive fact is that we barely know anything about the whistleblower and already Team Trump is committed to discrediting them.\n\nIf none of this means anything, than why is Team Trump working so hard?", "description": "This week has been a bad week for the Trump administration, even by its usual standards.", "authors": ["Molly Jong-Fast"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/20/18/2019-09-20T164906Z-1689133224-RC1452743550-RTRMADP-3-USA-TRUMP.JPG", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
