No Democrat has won more than 40 percent of the vote there since Walden was first elected in 1998.\n\nWalden ruled out running for any other office, saying he will instead \u201cclose the public service chapter of my life, thankful for the friends I\u2019ve made and the successful work we\u2019ve done together.\u201d\n\nWalden, who prided himself on working in a bipartisan fashion despite an increasingly polarized atmosphere on Capitol Hill, is currently serving in his 11th term in the House.\n\nChip Somodevilla/Getty Images, FILE\n\nHe served as chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee during the 115th Congress, and has worked to address the opioid crisis and expand broadband access in the United States.

Greg\u2019s voice, ideas and leadership will be missed in the House.\u201d\n\nRep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., praised Walden\u2019s \u201cpioneering spirit\u201d and \u201cclear focus on big solutions.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom historic legislation to combat the opioid crisis, to expanding rural broadband and 5G technology, building the 21st century economy, lowering prescription drug prices, and supporting innovation in energy and healthcare, Greg has kept the focus and mission of our committee on what matters the most\u2014improving the lives of those we serve,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cI\u2019ll miss working with him.\u201d\n\nWalden, 62, got his start on Capitol Hill as a press secretary and chief of staff to former Rep.
