The storm is forecast to approach close to Florida late Monday night and turn north, skirting the coast and coming near the Georgia and South Carolina coasts Wednesday night and Thursday.\n\nFlood Risk As a hurricane\u2019s strength intensifies, so does its potential to cause flooding along the coast.

Miami Category 4 is a storm with wind speeds of 130 to 156 miles an hour. Category 5 is defined as having wind speeds of 157 miles an hour or faster. Any storm from Category 3 up is considered a major hurricane. Though forecasters said Monday the hurricane isn\u2019t projected to make landfall in Florida, \u201conly a slight deviation to the left of the official forecast track would bring the core of Dorian near or over the Florida east coast. NASA\u2019s CloudSat satellite provides an animation of Dorian after passing Puerto Rico when it was a Tropical Storm. CloudSat uses an advanced cloud-profiling radar that can determine height, different layers and the areas where the heavier bands of rain are found within the storm system. The animation shows Dorian with some cloud tops extending about 9 miles into the atmosphere. The colors represent the size of water or ice droplets inside the storm: Deep red and pink indicate larger droplets with areas of moderate and heavy rainfall.
