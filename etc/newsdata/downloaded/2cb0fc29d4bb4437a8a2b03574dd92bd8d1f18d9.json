It would have the right to make public transcripts of depositions taken in private.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Trump impeachment: Last week was the most dramatic so far\n\nIn the second phase, a public report on the findings would be sent to the House Judiciary Committee which would conduct its own proceedings and report on \"such resolutions, articles of impeachment, or other recommendations as it deems proper\".\n\nPresident Trump's lawyers would be allowed to take part in the Judiciary Committee stage.\n\nRepublicans on the committees would be able to subpoena documents or witnesses - although they could still be blocked as both committees are Democrat-controlled.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said a House vote on the resolution will take place on Thursday.\n\nWhat do Mr Trump's supporters say?\n\n\"The resolution put forward by Speaker Pelosi confirms that House Democrats' impeachment has been an illegitimate sham from the start as it lacked any proper authorisation by a House vote,\" said White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham.\n\nHouse Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, speaking before the resolution was unveiled, said the entire process was a \"sham.\"\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Leading Democrat Adam Schiff would oversee public hearings in the next stage\n\nReferring to the closed-door meetings and depositions he said: \"You can't put the genie back in the bottle. Due process starts at the beginning.\"\n\nWhat did Col Vindman say?\n\nIn an opening statement released ahead of Tuesday's closed-door testimony, Col Vindman said his worries began at a 10 July meeting between US and Ukrainian national security officials.\n\nThe meeting was cut short by then-National Security Adviser John Bolton when talk arose of Ukraine opening investigations for the White House, Col Vindman said.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Decorated veteran Alexander Vindman is a Ukraine specialist within the US National Security Council\n\nUS Ambassador Gordon Sondland had brought up \"Ukraine delivering specific investigations in order to secure [a] meeting with the president\" which alarmed Mr Bolton and Col Vindman.\n\nAt a debriefing afterwards, Col Vindman said the ambassador again \"emphasised the importance that Ukraine deliver the investigations into the 2016 election, the Bidens and Burisma\".\n\n\"I stated to Amb Sondland that his statements were inappropriate, that the request to investigate Biden and his son had nothing to do with national security.\"\n\nFollowing this incident, Col Vindman reported his concerns to the National Security Council's lead counsel. He reported his objections again after the 25 July call.\n\nCol Vindman said he attempted to edit a White House transcript of the call to include some missing details, US media, citing sources, report.\n\nWhile some amendments were accepted, other omissions remained, including a reference to Burisma by Mr Zelensky, and Mr Trump alleging there were recordings of Mr Biden discussing corruption in Ukraine, the New York Times and Washington Post report.\n\nPresident Trump has previously described the transcript as \"exact\".\n\nWhat was the reaction?\n\nAs the testimony was due to begin, Mr Trump suggested Col Vindman was a \"Never Trumper witness\" in a tweet.\n\nOther conservatives have also attacked Col Vindman's credibility because he was born in Ukraine - though some have since defended the veteran officer.\n\nSkip Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump Supposedly, according to the Corrupt Media, the Ukraine call \u201cconcerned\u201d today\u2019s Never Trumper witness. Was he on the same call that I was? Can\u2019t be possible! Please ask him to read the Transcript of the call. Witch Hunt! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 29, 2019 Report\n\nRepublican congresswoman Liz Cheney denounced these gibes as \"shameful\", while Senator Mitt Romney called the criticism \"absurd\" and \"disgusting\".\n\n\"This is a decorated American soldier and he should be given the respect that his service to our country demands,\" he said.\n\nBut many other Republicans stood by Mr Trump. House Minority leader Kevin McCarthy said Col Vindman was \"wrong\".\n\n\"Nothing in that phone call is impeachable,\" he said.", "description": "A resolution lays out how the House will take the inquiry against the president into a public phase.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0F7D/production/_109456930_057643284.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
