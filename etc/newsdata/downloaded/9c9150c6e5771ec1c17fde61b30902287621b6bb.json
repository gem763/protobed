Under the draft law, a woman who has unlawfully terminated her pregnancy could face four years in prison.\n\nIndicative of Indonesia\u2019s increasing religious conservatism, the new draft further recognises any \u201cliving law\u201d, which could be interpreted to include local sharia or customary laws at the local level, of which there are hundreds across the country that discriminate against women, LGBT people and religious minorities.\n\nThe new code also looks set to rollback Indonesia\u2019s notable press freedoms by making it a criminal offence to insult the president and vice president.\n\nThis week, on the back of another problematic law that is widely expected to weaken a critical anti-corruption commission, the media published scathing caricatures of the president \u2013 content that could be deemed unlawful in the future.\n\nThe new code will further expand the existing blasphemy law, and outlines a 10-year prison term for associating with organisations that follow a Marxist-Leninist ideology.", "description": "New draft bill, decades in the making, could also criminalise insulting the president and tightens abortion laws", "authors": ["Kate Lamb"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be974e328a7929325434c6fe21b37ec7ca959d3d/218_25_1548_929/master/1548.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2ee07f8af9b736dcfd5a23977a16d813", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
