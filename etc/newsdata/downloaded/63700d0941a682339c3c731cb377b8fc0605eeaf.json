Following its two-day policy meeting, the central bank said it would lower its benchmark overnight lending rate to a target range of 1.75% to 2%.\n\nThe yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note which had fallen as much as 6 basis points ahead of the FOMC meeting, trimmed its fall to about 5 basis points to 1.76% after the decision. Yields rise as prices drop.\n\nThe FOMC also did not point to further cuts, a sign some market commentators deemed more restrictive \u2014 or hawkish \u2014than anticipated. Three Fed regional presidents \u2013 Esther George of Kansas City, Eric Rosengren of Boston and James Bullard of St. Louis \u2013 each voted against the cut.\n\nThis market reaction is exactly consistent with what you'd expect out of a \"hawkish cut,\" said Jim Caron, Managing Director of Global Fixed Income at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. \"The big disappointment was that there wasn't an entree into doing more in response to trade tensions or oil\" price action.\n\nCaron added that the Fed's hesitation to lower rates further compared to the relatively looser European Central Bank \"will drive the dollar.\"\n\n\"A strong dollar is bad for weaker global asset prices because a lot of debt is priced in dollars,\" he added. \"Emerging markets do poorly, U.S. exports do poorly ... it's a much more challenging environment.\"\n\nThe U.S. central bank on July 31 cut rates for the first time since December 2008 with those in favor citing slower economic activity, \"muted inflation\" and tensions between the world's largest trading partners.\n\nBut while Powell categorized the July cut at the time as a mere \"midcycle adjustment\" based on a comparatively healthy domestic economy, the U.S.-China trade war worsened almost as soon as the Fed announced the cut. President Donald Trump on Aug. 1, one day later, announced that the U.S. would extend tariffs to practically all Chinese imports and scolded Beijing for reneging on promises to buy American crops and stem the sale of Fentanyl.\n\nThe Fed's also had trouble keeping the effective federal funds rate \u2014 the actual interest banks charge each other overnight \u2014 below the upper bound of its target range between 2% and 2.25%. The effective federal funds rate rose to 2.3% on Tuesday, breaking above the range for the first time since the global credit crisis more than a decade ago as a confluence of factors including corporate tax day and less liquidity pushed the price of capital up.", "description": "U.S. debt yields fell ahead of what investors across Wall Street expected will be the Federal Reserve's second move to cut rates in 2019.", "authors": ["Thomas Franck"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105761898-1551198269327gettyimages-1127587466.jpeg?v=1568804932"}
