US forces had had him under surveillance for weeks before the president gave the go-ahead for a mission to capture or kill.\n\nThe president thanked the governments of Russia, Turkey, Syria and Iraq, as well as Kurdish forces, for their assistance, which apparently helped the op go off like a charm, with no American lives lost, but multiple ISIS ones.\n\nThe raid also captured considerable information that should help run down scattered remnants and assets of the terrorist group across Syria and Iraq.\n\nSomething calling itself the Islamic State may survive, as has al Qaeda. To prevent any ISIS revival, Washington will need to keep Iran-aligned extremists from again radicalizing the region\u2019s Sunnis, as Tehran\u2019s pawns did after President Barack Obama pulled the last US forces out of Iraq.\n\nIndeed, to check Iran and protect the Syrian Kurds who helped smash ISIS in Syria, Trump is looking to deploy some US forces in the oil-rich areas of northeast Syria, a part of the Kurdish heartland, which seems a wise precaution.\n\nWashington can\u2019t force peace on the region, but it can stand by its friends and against its enemies \u2014 as well as hunting down the worst vermin, like al-Baghdadi.", "description": "A rapist and author of countless atrocities, al-Baghdadi had taken refuge in a part of Syria controlled by al Qaeda, from which he\u2019d broken years ago when he founded his so-called Islamic State.", "authors": ["Post Editorial Board", "October"], "top_image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-dead-rot-hell.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
