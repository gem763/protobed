Home Where You Can Train Like The Hulk Lists for $3.9 Million", "language": "en", "text": "Lou Ferrigno \u2019s life is imitating his art. The 2009 comedy \u201cI Love You, Man\u201d revolves partly around a real-estate agent\u2019s attempt to sell Mr. Ferrigno\u2019s Los Angeles home, with the actor playing himself. Now Mr. Ferrigno is listing his real life Los Angeles-area home for $3.9 million.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny\u2014it\u2019s like I\u2019m repeating what happened\u201d in the movie, said Mr. Ferrigno, 67, a former professional bodybuilder and actor who played the title role in TV\u2019s \u201cThe Incredible Hulk.\u201d He pointed out that he doesn\u2019t have a huge statue of himself in the backyard, as depicted in the film; the statue is smaller, and located inside the house.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s funny\u2014it\u2019s like I\u2019m repeating what happened\u2019 in the movie, said Mr. Ferrigno, referring to the 2009 comedy \u2018I Love You, Man.\u2019 The movie revolves partly around a real-estate agent\u2019s attempt to sell Mr. Ferrigno\u2019s Los Angeles home, with the actor playing himself.

In reality he lives in Santa Monica, not too far from the beach, in a traditional-style home built in the 1920s, said Alphonso Lascano of Hilton & Hyland, who has the listing with colleague Bjorn Farrugia.\n\nLocated in the Gillette\u2019s Regent Square area, the yellow, brick and stucco home measures about 3,500 square feet with five bedrooms. It sits on a roughly 9,000-square-foot lot, which is large for Santa Monica, Mr. Lascano said. Many older homes in this area are being torn down and replaced with new, larger houses, said Mr. Lascano, who said the same thing is likely to happen to this house, Hulk-related history aside.\n\nLocated in the Gillette\u2019s Regent Square area, Mr. Ferrigno\u2019s home measures about 3,500 square feet with five bedrooms.

At the time Mr. Ferrigno was in the midst of his stint playing the Hulk, he said, and the couple liked that the house was convenient to filming locations and the beach.\n\nMr. Ferrigno and his wife Carla Ferrigno have lived in the house since 1980, while Mr. Ferrigno was in the midst of his stint playing the title role in TV\u2019s \u2018The Incredible Hulk.\u2019 Photo: Universal/Everett Collection\n\nMr. Ferrigno, who also works as a personal trainer, turned a free-standing garage on the property into what he calls \u201cthe best home gym in the country,\u201d a roughly 1,000-square-foot space where he said he has trained the likes of Michael Jackson and Chuck Norris over the years.\n\nThe couple raised their three children in the house, Mr. Ferrigno said. They are selling because they\u2019ve purchased a property in Northern California on roughly 6 acres, and Mr. Ferrigno said he\u2019s looking forward to having more space for a \u201cman cave,\u201d where he can do woodworking and store his collection of rifles and bows and arrows. Plus, \u201cI like to be in the woods and the country,\u201d he said.\n\nAs a bodybuilder, Mr. Ferrigno won a Mr. America and two Mr. Universe titles, and appeared in the bodybuilding documentary, \u201cPumping Iron.\u201d In addition to the television show, he has played the Hulk in several movies.\n\nWrite to Candace Taylor at Candace.Taylor@wsj.com", "description": "Lou Ferrigno, who played the fictional superhero on television, is selling his Santa Monica property with what he calls \u2018the best home gym in the country.\u2019", "authors": ["Candace Taylor", "Candace.Taylor Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107112/social", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
