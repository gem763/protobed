This modem will reportedly be paired with a new Apple chipset \u2014 likely to be called the A14 Bionic \u2014 that\u2019ll be the first from the company to be built using a 5-nanometer process.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve heard rumors that Apple is planning on releasing its first 5G phones in 2020, nor is it the first time we\u2019ve heard there\u2019ll be three of them. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo made a similar prediction back in July. What\u2019s new are the reports of the exact Qualcomm modem Apple plans to use after the two companies settled their ongoing legal dispute back in April. In the longer term, Apple is thought to be working on its own in-house modems having acquired the majority of Intel\u2019s smartphone modem business in July.\n\nHuawei is also thought to be working on a 5nm chip\n\nThe report also corroborates previous rumors that Apple is planning to switch to a 5nm fabrication process for its chips next year, moving away from the 7nm process that it\u2019s used since the A12 Bionic chip debuted in 2018. Apple rival Huawei is also thought to be working on a 5nm chip of its own that\u2019s set to launch in a similar period next year.\n\nAs well as 5G connectivity and a new chip fabrication process, next year\u2019s iPhones are also expected to be Apple\u2019s first redesign of its flagship phones since 2017, and could feature an in-display fingerprint sensor. In addition to its three flagship devices, Apple could also release a low-cost successor to the iPhone SE towards the beginning of the year.", "description": "Three of Apple\u2019s phones will reportedly release with 5G connectivity next year using Qualcomm\u2019s X55 modem.
