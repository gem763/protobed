They were built in the early 20th century. This one was an iron ore mine.\u201d\n\nNEWSLETTERS Beast Travel Digest Get the entire world in your inbox.

It has a rusty \u2018Do Not Enter\u2019 sign nailed on it, a hollow window on its front sealed with metal and a missing block on the side that\u2019s just big enough for him to stick his head and chest through. \u201cThis was an entry/exit point. We\u2019re going to go in from here.\u201d\n\nJust like that, he pulls himself up and wiggles his body through the makeshift opening. I follow, clumsily. Then it\u2019s the rest of the crew: five other guys, all covered up, and with a ton of camera gear on them. They\u2019re HK Urbex, a so-called anonymous collective that explores abandoned sites in and around Hong Kong.\n\nThe mine is one such site. Running at the foot of one of Hong Kong\u2019s highest mountains, in what\u2019s now a county park in the New Territories district, they tell me it operated from 1906 until the mid \u201970s, when the mining industry died down. As many as 5,000 miners worked there at its peak of production.\n\nOther expeditions HK Urbex has undertaken include crumbling mansions, and buildings slated for demolition, forgotten city attractions\u2014Hong Kong\u2019s largest movie studio, a failed theme-park\u2014and decrepit public venues like a former slaughterhouse, hospitals, and movie theaters. They\u2019ve also ventured into military barracks, bomb shelters, and observatories.\n\nThey\u2019ve also dived into eerie spaces in Japan and China. Urbexing exists across the globe\u2014the hashtag counts some 7 million entries on Instagram\u2014from Detroit, an haven for urban ruins, to the U.K. In New York City, it became a thing in the \u201990s, only to collapse after 9/11 due to heightened security measures across the city\u2014though some of its underbelly still lures adventurers.\n\nMost of the places infiltrated require trespassing, and often involve wriggling through dark holes or finding access points hidden from view, down slippery paths or wired fences. On quite a few occasions, the Hong Kong group has had to sneak past security guards, or run away from them and cut their plans short.\n\nAll long-term Hong Kong residents, these urban explorers have been at it since 2013, when the guy who lent me the helmet, who goes by the alias of Ghost, and another explorer, Echo Delta\u2014both of whom work in video and media\u2014came across a few forsaken spaces while scouting locations for a film they wanted to make. They decided to look for more and formed HK Urbex. A few friends, mostly fellow videographers, soon began joining their \u201calternative jaunts\u201d as one of them, codename Pripyat, describes their ventures.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re often the first people to re-enter these places in a long, long time,\u201d says Ghost. \u201cAnd even more often we\u2019re the last. It\u2019s both bittersweet and slightly unsettling.\u201d\n\nAs we start our descent, the latter descriptor definitely applies. Holding a tattered rope in one hand and a flashlight in the other, we take cautious steps down a track of rough rocks and rubble. In the span of a few minutes the air dampens, and natural light begins to fade. By the time we reach the first tunnel, we\u2019re in complete darkness.\n\nFor the next three hours we progress farther into the gloom of the black, narrow arteries of the 113-year-old mine, 300 feet below ground. Throughout, the HK Urbex guys film, photograph, and look for traces of the past with a quasi-archaeological approach (and find some: an oxidized tea pot and four cups left to rot on an improvised table, a resting area with bunk beds, old working tools).\n\nThe collective documents everything they do on all their outings\u2014as well as extensively researching the history of each venue beforehand. They never share the exact locations of the sites, to avoid having thrill-seekers, photography hobbyists, or YouTubers looking to \u201cshock\u201d viewers going in (for this piece, I was asked not to share specifics of the places we discussed and explored).\n\n\u201cDocumenting is the whole point of it,\u201d says Ghost. \u201cWe want to create an archive of Hong Kong\u2019s past\u2014both colonial and more recent. We are here to help preserve what\u2019s left of the city\u2019s original spirit.\u201d\n\nThe others reiterate that intention. \u201cIt\u2019s not about the adrenaline or breaking the rules. It\u2019s about telling a story,\u201d says Pripyat.\n\nThat story is one of a city that since the 1997 handover to China from British colonial rule has been undergoing an identity transformation, both in its skyline, with the rise of soaring towers, multi-billion projects, and glitzy complexes replacing many older buildings, and politically, as the mainland has tightened its grip on the local government\u2014a situation met with increased discontent from many residents, as currently ongoing protests against a contentious extradition bill have made clear.\n\nHK Urbex says its work is a way of confronting these issues and getting people to pay attention to their heritage. \u201cHong Kong is disappearing one building at the time,\u201d Echo Delta says. \u201cPlaces like this [mine] are part of our collective memory. They\u2019re our history pillars, and lot of people just don\u2019t seem to care, or even be aware of them. We try change that.\u201d\n\nTo that end, the group posts most of their footage on YouTube and on their Facebook page. That\u2019s also why they use pseudonyms and wear masks (although the potential legal actions they face also play a part in that). \u201cWe\u2019re not the focus here,\u201d Echo Delta says. \u201cHong Kong is.\u201d\n\n\u201c In a property market that\u2019s the most expensive in the world, many of the relics composing the fabric of old Hong Kong have already disappeared. \u201d\n\nTo date, Hong Kong counts 120 declared monuments, all of which are permanently protected from demolition. The government\u2019s Antiquities and Monuments Office (AMO) has also granted grades to 1,444 historic buildings according to their historic merit. This second classification does not legally shield them from being torn down or altered, however. In fact, with a property market that\u2019s the most expensive in the world and increasing land scarcity, many of the relics composing the fabric of old Hong Kong have already disappeared or been sealed off, waiting for jackhammers to come in.\n\n\u201cThe AMO is a pretty powerless institution,\u201d Echo Delta says. \u201cConservancy groups, too, are praiseworthy but haven\u2019t achieved that much in terms of tangible steps to safeguard our heritage distinctiveness. At the end of the day, there\u2019s no political will to change things. It\u2019s all profit-driven.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany structures are privately-owned, and become what I call \u2018limbo spaces,\u2019\u201d Ghost adds. \u201cSometimes they stay abandoned for years before redevelopment begins, which is both a waste and a pure display of indifference to their cultural value.\u201d The 1930 Bauhaus-style Central Market, which was closed to the public for over a decade and is now going to be transformed into a cultural and retail center, is a case in point. Bruce Lee\u2019s mansion, where the actor lived till his death in 1973, is another. The mansion endured years of neglect and a short stint as a love hotel until, in November 2018, the charitable trust owning the property announced it would turn it into a center for Chinese Studies. Ghost calls it \u201ca missed opportunity\u201d to pay homage to an iconic figure for Hong Kong.\n\nHK Urbex\u2019s documentarian mission has extended to all these places. But the collective is also fascinated by everyday buildings. Two months after we toured the mine, we enter a kindergarten and elementary school in the moneyed neighborhood of mid-levels that\u2019s been closed for at least two decades. Inside, the classrooms are filled with dust and detritus, but they\u2019re also still full of toys, trophies, desks, and old TVs and VHS systems. The complex feels both apocalyptic and frozen in time, as if both students and teachers left in a hurry, leaving everything behind.\n\n\u201cThe items we find are often as interesting as the buildings themselves,\u201d Pripyat says. \u201cThey are part of the storytelling, too\u2014they evoke not just the past but other people\u2019s lives. What they cared about or kept or even played with. You can\u2019t find that in history books.\u201d\n\nAlthough they don\u2019t recommend that residents or travelers trespass on properties, the group says urban exploration gives you a whole new understanding and appreciation for Hong Kong. \u201cNow more than ever,\u201d Echo Delta is keen to stress, \u201cwe\u2014and younger people especially\u2014are grappling to define what the future of our city is going to look like. Recognizing our legacy is key to that process.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re keen on urbexing, you don\u2019t necessarily have to go down a mine. As we slip out of the school and walk towards a bus stop, Ghost points at a barely noticeable iron door anchored onto a wall on the side of the road. \u201cThe entrance to a World War II war tunnel.\u201d A few blocks down, he nods towards a building featuring faded Art Deco details and fenced off windows. Another derelict site.\n\n\u201cAbandoned places are going fast, but many are still around us,\u201d he says. \u201cYou just have to learn how to look.\u201d", "description": "HK Urbex explores abandoned buildings, goes down closed mine shafts, and pokes through WWII tunnels, all in the name of recording the city\u2019s forgotten history.", "authors": ["Marianna Cerini"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1566615332/190823-hk-tease_koxl6u"}
