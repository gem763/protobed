More Democrat/Crooked Media con..... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 23, 2019 Report\n\nHe has also tacitly questioned the \"supposed\" whistleblower's patriotism.\n\nSkip Twitter post 2 by @realDonaldTrump ....know the correct facts. Is he on our Country\u2019s side. Where does he come from. Is this all about Schiff & the Democrats again after years of being wrong? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 23, 2019 Report\n\nWhat are other US politicians saying?\n\nCongressional Democrats say the phone call - raised by a whistleblower in a formal complaint - is important because it helps to shed light on the president's dealings with the foreign leader.\n\nCritics of the White House say that Mr Trump put pressure on Mr Zelensky, urging him to tell officials in his government to investigate business activities related to Hunter Biden, who was a board member for a company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch.\n\nDemocrats said that the president wanted the Ukrainians to start the investigation into corruption because this could sully the reputation of Hunter and his father.\n\nRepublicans have said little about the controversy. This shows the partisan nature of the controversy, which has - like much else in Washington - been divided by party politics.\n\nHowever, at least one Republican, Mitt Romney, a US senator from Utah, said he would like to know more.\n\nSkip Twitter post by @MittRomney If the President asked or pressured Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme. Critical for the facts to come out. \u2014 Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) September 22, 2019 Report\n\nWhat happened to the whistleblower's complaint?\n\nAfter receiving the complaint, the inspector general informed Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, and said the matter was \"urgent\". The intelligence community whistleblower law says the director has seven days to pass the complaint along to congressional intelligence committees.\n\nThat didn't happen.\n\nInstead, Mr Maguire spoke to a lawyer who told him the issue was not \"urgent\", at least according to legal standards, according to the New York Times.\n\nAs a result, Mr Maguire decided that the members of the congressional oversight committees did not need to see it.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Trump: \"It's a partisan whistleblower\"\n\nOn 9 September, the inspector general informed Congress about the complaint's existence, but not the details. Democrats in Congress have since clamoured for more information - including a transcript of Mr Trump's call - but the administration has refused to co-operate.\n\nAnd that's where things currently stand.\n\nMr Maguire is scheduled to testify publicly before the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday, and lawmakers are likely to say they want to see the complaint. If that does not work, House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff might file a lawsuit, according to CNN, to try and get access to it.\n\nSo did the president do something illegal?\n\nThe most damning allegation is that the president pressured a foreign leader for damaging information about a political opponent while holding out the prospect of US military aid.\n\nIs that illegal? We do have some very recent precedent.\n\nIt certainly recalls the recently concluded two-year Robert Mueller investigation into possible Trump campaign ties to Russian election-meddling in 2016.\n\nThe special counsel's report detailed multiple contacts between the campaign and Russian nationals, including the June 2016 meeting between top campaign officials such as Donald Trump Jr and several Russians with ties to the Kremlin.\n\nThere has been some debate over whether soliciting opposition research from a foreign government constitutes a campaign finance violation, but Mr Mueller declined to file charges.\n\nMr Trump's Ukrainian call could also potentially run afoul of federal bribery statutes. The special counsel concluded that Justice Department policy guidelines prohibit a sitting president from being indicted, however, so even if Mr Trump did commit some kind of crime with his actions, he's safe at the moment from criminal prosecution.\n\nWith this in mind, a more relevant question might be \u2026\n\nDid Mr Trump commit an impeachable offence?\n\nThe constitutional process for handling a president who committed illegal and-or unethical acts is impeachment by a majority of the House of Representatives and conviction and removal by a two-thirds majority of the US Senate.\n\nThe US constitution outlines the grounds for impeachment as \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors\". When it comes down to it, an \"impeachable offense\" is whatever a majority of the House says it is.\n\nEver since the conclusion of the Mueller investigation, the drumbeat for impeachment among Democrats - who hold a comfortable majority in the House - has been steadily increasing. Up to now, however, the House Democratic leadership has been loathe to push ahead with a formal investigation that could lead to an impeachment vote.\n\nSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi has suggested that such a move could damage the electoral prospects of Democrats in moderate congressional districts and would in the end be meaningless because the Republicans who hold the majority in the Senate would never vote to remove the president.\n\nWith the latest Ukraine allegations, however, some Democrats have started to speak in a more assertive manner about their desire to impeach the president. \"The president is pushing us down this road,\" said Mr Schiff on CNN.\n\nAt some point the calculus in the House could change and Democrats who are saying there is a moral responsibility to impeach the president could gain the upper hand.\n\nIs there anything to these allegations about Joe Biden and his son?\n\nThe allegations against the Bidens pushed by Mr Trump and his lawyer, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, centre on the then-vice-president's successful effort to force out top Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin in 2016.\n\nMr Shokin's office was responsible for investigations into a Ukrainian gas company, Burisima Holdings, which at the time was paying Hunter Biden, Mr Biden's son, as much as $50,000 a month to serve on its board of directors.\n\nMr Trump, Mr Guiliani and others allege that the vice-president's pressure, which included the threat to withhold $1bn in US loan guarantees to the country, was an effort to protect his son and his company from potentially criminal exposure.\n\nImage copyright Pool/Getty Images Image caption Former President Barack Obama sits with former Vice-President Joe Biden and his son Hunter at a basketball game in 2010\n\nAt the very least, according to critics, the Biden family's ties to Ukraine raise the perception of a possible conflict of interest.\n\nCutting against these allegations is the fact that Mr Biden was not the only public official - in the US, among EU countries and in Ukraine - calling for Mr Shokin's removal.\n\nAnd as the New York Times recently noted, the Ukrainian prosecutor was not \"aggressively pursuing\" investigations into Burisima at the time, but was accused of using the threat of prosecution to solicit bribes from company leaders.\n\nIn addition, Mr Shokin's replacement, Yuriy Lutsenko, continued to investigate Burisima for 10 months before ending all legal proceedings.\n\nSo is this 2016 all over again?\n\nAs noted, the parallels between this Ukraine episode and events surrounding 2016 Russian election-meddling story are unmistakable. There are, however, key differences.\n\nBack in 2016, Mr Trump was a private citizen aspiring to the White House. His campaign may have been approached by foreign nationals offering assistance, but according to the Mueller investigation, the overtures either led to nothing or were rebuffed outright.\n\nNow Mr Trump - with all the powers of the presidency at his disposal - is alleged to have initiated the contact with a foreign leader. While he denies pressuring the Ukrainian president, his critics say blocking military aid while repeatedly asking for an investigation into the Bidens makes Mr Trump's objective crystal clear.\n\nReporting by Anthony Zurcher and Tara McKelvey", "description": "There's a new political controversy in the US - it's complex but we break it down into bite-sized chunks.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/AAB6/production/_108920734_donald_joe_hunter.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
