Six weeks later, WeWork's board of directors ousted the controversial CEO Neumann and replaced him with two co-CEOs, who shelved the IPO indefinitely.\n\nRead more: Sex, tequila, and a tiger: Employees inside Adam Neumann's WeWork talk about the nonstop party to attain a $100 billion dream and the messy reality that tanked it\n\nCo-CEOs' first weeks in office\n\nAfter taking the co-CEO role on September 24, Artie Minson and Sebastian Gunningham immediately turned their attention to rescuing WeWork.
