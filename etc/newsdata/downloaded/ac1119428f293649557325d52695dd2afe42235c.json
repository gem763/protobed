She noted that when Obama decided to intervene against ISIS in 2014, and later to launch a train-and-equip program for local forces, his administration specified that they were not to fight Assad, only ISIS. \u201cThat is the biggest contradiction of all,\u201d she said.\n\nRead: How ISIS returns\n\nFrom that contradiction flowed many others. The U.S. decision to back the Syrian Kurds against ISIS was always fraught, and not just because of America\u2019s own repeated history of courting and then abandoning the Kurds in wartime. U.S. officials routinely praised their competence in battle and highlighted their sacrifices in fighting ISIS. But the Syrian Kurdish militias were also considered by Turkey, not to mention U.S. intelligence, an offshoot of the designated terrorist group the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, which waged a decades-long insurgency within Turkey in a bid for its own autonomy.\n\nThus the seeds of Sunday\u2019s betrayal of one partner, the Kurds, were sown in an earlier betrayal of a treaty ally, Turkey. If it were the U.S. in Turkey\u2019s position, it would be as if a NATO ally\u2014say, the U.K.\u2014were supporting an al-Qaeda statelet in Mexico in order to fight some other group there, but offered to help keep it 20 miles away from the border.\n\nOr not exactly like that, because the U.S. actually tried to get Turkey to help against ISIS, and found Turkey\u2019s own proxies in Syria \u201criddled with extremists, many tied to al-Qaeda,\u201d in the words of Brett McGurk, who served as Obama\u2019s, and then Trump\u2019s, envoy to the coalition to defeat ISIS until he resigned in 2018. The Kurds, meanwhile, were a non-state partner of the United States, and they faced enemies from numerous sides. These included Turkey as well as potentially the regime of Assad, who vowed to take back \u201cevery inch\u201d of Syria and warned: \u201cTo those groups who are betting on the Americans, we say the Americans will not protect you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do think [U.S. Syria policy] is collapsing under the weight of its contradictions,\u201d Jennifer Cafarella, the research director at the Institute for the Study of War, told me. \u201cWe\u2019ve decided to become involved enough [in Syria] to be accountable for what happens, but not enough to actually determine the outcome,\u201d said Cafarella, who thinks the U.S. should be giving more support to the Kurds.\n\nIn a call with reporters yesterday afternoon, a senior administration official inadvertently highlighted the incoherence of the friendships the U.S. has been trying to maintain with two mortal enemies in northeast Syria. Trump, this official said, was acting to protect American troops from getting caught in the crossfire between the Turks and the Kurds. So the plan was that American soldiers would have to retreat from one friend, Turkey, and abandon another, the Syrian Kurds, for fear of getting killed by either one.", "description": "Did the president betray the Kurds or help dismantle a contradictory strategy in Syria?
