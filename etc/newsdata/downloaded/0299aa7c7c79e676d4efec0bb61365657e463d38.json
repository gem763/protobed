He didn't realize, however, how massive the reptile was until he and five other fishermen managed to wrangle it on the boat.\n\n\u201cIt was just unbelievable. I really can't describe it. You need to see it,\u201d Snelson told ABC Atlanta affiliate WSB-TV.\n\n\u201cWe'll have it 'life-size' mounted. I guess I'll have to build a house around it. It's going to be a monster laying on the living room floor for a while,\u201d he said.\n\nThe previous record for largest alligator caught was a 13-foot reptile in 2013, according to Georgia Outdoor News.\n\nThe hunting season for alligators in Georgia runs from August to October this year, according to the state\u2019s department of natural resources.\n\nAnyone with a valid hunting license can participate but there is a one-bag limit.", "description": "A Georgia man caught a record-breaking alligator.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/alligator-ht-er-190909_hpMain_v4x3_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
