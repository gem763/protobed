Police have used the blue dye to identify protesters.\n\nIt was the heaviest use of water canons by police and many people hit with the water developed coughs, suggesting an irritant may be mixed with the water.\n\nAs riot police advanced protesters fell back to their next barricade, unlike past rallies when they stood and clashed with police, throwing petrol bombs and bricks.\n\nRelated Coverage Hong Kong police and protesters exchange tear gas and petrol bombs\n\nAlong the march route, protesters trashed metro stations and hundreds of shops, throwing goods onto the streets. Several Chinese banks were targeted.\n\nProtesters have in the past targeted Chinese banks and shops with links to mainland China, leaving mainland Chinese living in Hong Kong worried about their safety.\n\nOne trashed shop on Sunday had notices left on its shutters saying it was attacked because it was owned by mainland Chinese mobs who had attacked innocent people. \u201cWe never rob. We don\u2019t forgive. We don\u2019t forget\u201d, said the notice.\n\nBy nightfall only small groups of protesters remained, with one group throwing petrol bombs down a street towards police who responded with tear gas. Large numbers of riot police guarded several intersections.\n\nPolice said they had seized more than 40 petrol bombs that they believe may have been en route to the protest.\n\nThey said protesters had set fire to numerous road barriers and trashed shops in several Kowloon districts. Police detonated what they said was an explosive device surrounded by broken bricks and left in the middle of a street.\n\nThe unrest was sparked four months ago by a bill that would have allowed extradition to mainland China for trial in Communist Party-controlled courts. It has since widened into a pro-democracy movement.\n\nThe protests in the city pose the biggest popular challenge to China\u2019s President Xi Jinping since he took power. Beijing has denied eroding Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms and Xi has vowed to crush any attempt to split China.\n\n\u2018HONGKONGERS RESIST\u2019\n\nPolice had declared Sunday\u2019s march illegal due to concerns over public safety. Protesters, ranging from young students to the elderly, many carrying umbrellas to shield their faces from street surveillance cameras, face arrest.\n\nAn anti-government demonstrator throws a petrol bomb at Sham Shui Po Police Station during a protest in Hong Kong, China, October 20, 2019. REUTERS/Tyrone Siu\n\nFor the first few hours, the march was peaceful.\n\nAt the start of the march banners reading \u201cFree Hong Kong\u201d stretched across the ground. Other posters read \u201cHongKongers Resist\u201d, while graffiti on one wall said \u201cBetter Dead than Red\u201d.\n\nHardcore protesters set up road blocks and sprayed graffiti saying: \u201cWe chose to die on our feet rather than live on our knees!\u201d Some tore up pavement bricks for clashes with police.\n\nProtesters believe the police\u2019s refusal to issue a permit for Sunday\u2019s march was an attempt to limit their numbers, as some would fear being arrested.\n\n\u201cThe government pretends we just want to destroy the city. We\u2019ll be out for as long as it takes to let the world know it is them who are destroying it,\u201d said Ray, 24, who planned to go home after a few hours as he feared arrest.\n\nHong Kong is governed under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula, which permits the city freedoms not available on the mainland such as an independent judiciary.\n\nProtesters are angry at Hong Kong\u2019s leader Carrie Lam for what they see as her failure to protect those freedoms from an encroaching Beijing, imposing colonial-era emergency powers, and allowing what they say is excessive force by police.\n\n\u201cCarrie Lam is not listening to us at all. This may work in China but not in Hong Kong,\u201d said Cheung, a 33-year-old woman wearing a face mask and black T-shirt.\n\nLam\u2019s annual policy speech last Wednesday failed to address protesters\u2019 demands.\n\nProtesters have five core demands: universal suffrage, an independent inquiry into police action against protesters, amnesty for those charged, an end to describing protesters as rioters, and the formal withdrawal of the extradition bill.\n\nLam has said the bill is dead, but it is yet to be formally withdrawn. She has rejected the other demands. On Sunday she said a police complaints inquiry will be completed by December.\n\nSlideshow (19 Images)\n\nTwo people have been shot and wounded by police and thousands injured since the protests escalated in June.
