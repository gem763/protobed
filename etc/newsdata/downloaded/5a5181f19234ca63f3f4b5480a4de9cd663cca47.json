The statement was posted on the encrypted messaging platform Telegram Sept. 2, but it's unclear when Lorber was taken into custody.\n\nLorber is accused of violating Article 228 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation. In 2018, 100,000 people were arrested in Russia for breaking that same law, according to the Times.\n\nPace University confirmed to USA TODAY that Lorber is a student there.\n\nRep. Max Rose, D-N.Y., who represents Staten Island where Lorber lives, according to NBC News, issued a statement about the arrest over the weekend.\n\n\"I\u2019m working to help get Audrey home as soon as possible because no American citizen should be held in jail for a medical condition,\" Rose said on social media.\n\nFollow N'dea Yancey-Bragg on Twitter: @NdeaYanceyBragg\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: New York college student arrested in Russia for medical marijuana", "description": "Audrey Lorber, a student at Pace University, was stopped at the airport in St. Petersburg with 19.05 grams of medical marijuana.", "authors": ["N'Dea Yancey-Bragg", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/m/social/images/social_default_logo-1481777.png", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
