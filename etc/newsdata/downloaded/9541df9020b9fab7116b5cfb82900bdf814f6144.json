Esper lashed out Thursday at Turkey for its military assault across the border on Syrian Kurdish fighters.\n\nSpeaking at the German Marshall Fund, Esper said Turkey\u2019s \u201cunwarranted\u201d invasion into Syria jeopardizes gains made there in recent years as the U.S.-led coalition and allied Syrian Kurdish forces battled the Islamic State group.\n\n\u201cTurkey put us all in a very terrible situation. I think the incursion was unwarranted,\u201d he said. \u201cI think President Erdogan was fixated on making this incursion for one reason or another and there was not a possibility that we were going to start a war with a NATO ally.\u201d\n\nHe said Turkey is heading in the wrong direction, spinning closer to Russia, adding, \u201cI think that is unfortunate and I think we all need to work together to strengthen our partnership with Turkey and make sure they trend back to being the strong, reliable ally, responsible ally that they\u2019ve been in the past.\u201d\n\nHis comments come on the heels of President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement Wednesday that the U.S. is lifting sanctions on Turkey after the NATO ally agreed to permanently stop fighting Kurdish forces in Syria. And he spoke just a day after he was in Iraq to discuss the withdrawal and the Islamic State threat with Iraqi leaders and his military commanders.\n\nTrump is defending his decision to withdraw about 1,000 American troops from Syria, largely abandoning the Syrian Kurdish fighters who battled IS alongside the U.S. for the last several years. Trump has declared victory, saying the move is saving lives, but it also cedes control of a large swath of the border to Turkey, Russia and the Syrian government.\n\nTrump has agreed that 200 to 300 U.S. troops will remain at the Al Tanf garrison in southern Syria. And Esper has said the U.S. is still discussing a plan that would leave another small residual force in eastern Syria, near oil facilities that are under the control of the SDF. Those troops would help secure the oil from IS.\n\nEsper is expected to meet with Turkey\u2019s defense minister, Hulusi Akar, at the meeting of NATO defense chiefs Thursday. In previous discussions, Esper and other U.S. leaders were unable to convince Turkey to not invade Syria to push back Syrian Kurdish fighters whom Ankara considers terrorists.\n\nEsper\u2019s stop in Brussels for the NATO meeting and speech caps a six-day trip that included his first visits as secretary to the two major warzones where U.S. troops are deployed - Iraq and Afghanistan. He also spent several days in Saudi Arabia.\n\nIn his speech, Esper also urged allies to join in the effort to help Saudi Arabia defend itself and the broader Gulf region against Iranian threats.\n\nAnd he repeated familiar warnings about the increasing threats from China and Russia. He said China is trying to reshape the world in its favor, and is using its power to impact other nations\u2019 economies and political decisions.\n\nOther nations, he said, must enter their relationships with China with open eyes, and be aware of its militarization of the South China Sea and ongoing thefts of intellectual property.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "After spending four tumultuous days engulfed in the chaotic ramifications of the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria, U.S. Defense Secretary Mark T.
