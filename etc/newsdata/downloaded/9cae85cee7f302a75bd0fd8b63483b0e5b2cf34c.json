U.S. gold futures GCcv1 settled 0.6%\n\nlower at $1,504.4 an ounce.\n\n\"The fact that gold fell sharply on what was a dubious\n\n'positive' trade headline and was unable to recover suggests the\n\nmarket remains long and frustrated from last week after the\n\npayrolls release failed to signal imminent danger,\" said Tai\n\nWong, head of base and precious metals derivatives trading at\n\nBMO.\n\nChinese Commerce Ministry said China was ready for a deal\n\nwith the United States on parts of negotiations both sides agree\n\nupon, according to a FOX reporter tweet. Meanwhile, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said\n\nthere could be progress during the talks in Washington and that\n\ndelisting Chinese companies traded on U.S. exchanges 'is not on\n\nthe table.' Optimistic signals from both sides calmed nerves over the\n\noutcome of this week's trade talks and lifted U.S. stocks.\n\nMKTS/GLOB\n\nFurther weighing on gold's appeal, the dollar rose\n\n0.2% against a basket of major currencies. USD/\n\nAlso on investors' radar was the Federal Reserve Open Market\n\nCommittee's minutes from its September meeting on Wednesday.\n\nA string of weak U.S. economic data, including sluggish\n\nmanufacturing activity and a sharp slowdown in services industry\n\ngrowth, heightened recession fears, although Friday's decent\n\njobs report halted bullion's upside. \"Last week was getting fairly bullish for gold with the ISM\n\nand non-manufacturing numbers, but the jobs number was not\n\nterrible and that sort of dampened the bullishness in gold,\"\n\nsaid Ryan McKay, a commodity strategist at TD Securities.\n\nSpeculators slashed their bullish positions in COMEX gold\n\nand trimmed bullish bets on silver contracts in the week to Oct.\n\n1, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said on\n\nFriday. CFTC/\n\n\"Gold continues to get appraised against the U.S. bond\n\nyields and what the Fed is going to do next,\" said AxiTrader\n\nmarket strategist Stephen Innes in a note.\n\n\"So, while price action seems supportive enough to suggest a\n\nlong bias remains intact, ... market participants likely need\n\nfurther evidence from the Fed Board that they are shifting to an\n\neasing bias to push prices significantly higher.\"\n\nLower interest rates tend to increase investor interest in\n\nnon-yielding bullion.\n\nElsewhere, silver dipped 0.8% to $17.42 an ounce.\n\nPlatinum XPT= rose 0.2% to $877.81 and palladium XPD=\n\nedged 0.1% higher to $1,666.87.\n\n\n\nMoney managers' positions in COMEX gold https://tmsnrt.rs/2IvOB8i\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n\n", "description": "PRECIOUS-Gold dips 1% as trade hopes lifts dollar, stocks", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEB880JW_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
