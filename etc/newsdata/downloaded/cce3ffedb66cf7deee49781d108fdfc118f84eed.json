Local officials confirmed the news.\n\nItaly's government formally took office on Tuesday, promising a new approach to migration following the hardline clampdown on rescue ships introduced by former interior minister, Matteo Salvini, who heads the far-right League.\n\nPrime Minister Giuseppe Conte said on Thursday that \"several EU countries\" had agreed to take in the Africans aboard the Ocean Viking, but did not give further details and did not immediately let Ocean Viking enter Italian waters.\n\n\"We needed a bit of time, but Ocean Viking has finally been assigned a safe port. Small signs of discontinuity,\" said Matteo Orfini, a senior member of the center-left Democratic Party (PD) which has replaced the League within the ruling coalition.\n\nSalvini's tough line on immigration fuelled the popularity of his League party, which pulled out of its coalition with the 5-Star Movement last month in a vain attempt to trigger new elections.\n\nDuring his 14 months at the interior ministry, he introduced new security decrees barring rescue ships from entering Italian waters, saying Italy had borne too much responsibility for handling African migration to Europe.\n\nShips that defied the decrees risked being impounded and were threatened with fines of up to a million euros ($1.1 million).", "description": "In break with past, Rome lets charity ship head to Italian port", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/world_news_3_69x52._800x533_L_1419494235.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
