The previous day, it announced the diversion of $3.6 billion in military construction projects to build 175 miles of wall on the southern border.\n\nThe amount of funds reallocated from the USFK is smaller than that from the U.S. Forces Japan and other major regions. Some $257.34 million for eight military construction projects will be reallocated from Guam, which would provide backup support for Korea in a war, including the dispatch of B-1 and B-52 strategic bombers. This could affect the military preparedness for any war on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nThe \"TANGO\" bunker would serve as a wartime command post for the Korea-U.S. Combined Forces Command. It is perhaps no great loss since the two countries had planned to maintain and improve it only until Seoul takes over wartime troop control, even though USFK headquarters has been moved from Yongsan to Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province.\n\nBut the drone hangar was planned in Gunsan for the USFK to house Gray Eagle drones it had planned to put into operations early this year, but the budget cut could delay that.\n\nThe Defense Ministry here pledged to \"do its best to make sure that this will not affect its combat preparedness through close consultations with the U.S.\"\n\nUnfortunately the Pentagon has notified the ministry that the reallocation of funds will not affect Seoul's share of the USFK upkeep cost, which is up for renegotiation, according to a ministry spokesman. But it promised the projects have not been canceled but will only be postponed.\n\nA total of $1.84 billion is being reallocated from construction projects for overseas U.S. military bases in 19 countries.", "description": "U.S. to Divert USFK Budget to Trump's Border Wall", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://image.chosun.com/facebook/newson.gif", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
