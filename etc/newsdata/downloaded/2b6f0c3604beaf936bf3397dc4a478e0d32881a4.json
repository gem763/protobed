(Eva Hambach/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nAs news of the Trump administration\u2019s plan to ban most flavored e-cigarettes rippled across social media, another topic quickly hijacked the conversation: gun control. Pointing out that the thousands of gun deaths in the United States vastly outnumber the six fatalities attributed to vaping, some activists and legislators bemoaned the lack of meaningful action on guns. They renewed demands for gun-control measures such as bans on assault rifles.\n\n\u201cNow do AR-15s,\u201d tweeted Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who was among several prominent voices, including Moms Demand Action founder Shannon Watts, the March for Our Lives movement, comedian Dave Weasel and actress Bette Midler, in drawing the comparison with guns.\n\n[hides vape pen inside a gun] https://t.co/adgYNfdLt0 \u2014 Fred Delicious (@Fred_Delicious) September 11, 2019\n\nIn announcing his intent to crack down on e-cigarettes, President Trump on Wednesday cited concern for young people, saying, \u201cWe can\u2019t allow people to get sick. And we can\u2019t have our youth be so affected.\u201d The first lady feels \u201cvery, very strongly\u201d about the problem because of their 13-year-old son, Barron, he added.\n\nThose comments added to the anger over the absence of progress on gun control, with Twitter commentators expressing astonishment that the first couple sees e-cigarettes as the greater threat.\n\nA lot of us didn\u2019t make it home to say anything. https://t.co/IRT6FLgxe2 \u2014 March For Our Lives (@AMarch4OurLives) September 12, 2019\n\nGood thing they\u2019re banning vaping so kids don\u2019t die before they have the chance to get shot in school. \u2014 The Volatile Mermaid (@OhNoSheTwitnt) September 12, 2019\n\nYOU CAN\u2019T HAVE A VAPE PEN, PLAY WITH YOUR GUN INSTEAD pic.twitter.com/tq6uzk1lFC \u2014 Pundamentalism (@Pundamentalism) September 12, 2019\n\nCalls for legislation addressing gun violence have ramped up in recent months. On Thursday, one day after Trump\u2019s e-cigarette announcement, the CEOs of 145 U.S. companies urged Senate leaders to expand background checks for gun purchases and strengthen red-flag laws. The executives, who lead companies such as Yelp, Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods and Levi Strauss, wrote that they had a responsibility to \u201cstand up for the safety of our employees, customers and all Americans in the communities we serve across the country.\"\n\n\u201cDoing nothing about America\u2019s gun-violence crisis is simply unacceptable and it is time to stand with the American public on gun safety,\" the letter said.\n\n[Her temperature spiked the day she decided to stop vaping. Now she\u2019s on life support.]\n\nResearch has consistently found that a majority of Americans support background checks, gun licensing, assault weapons bans and other gun-control laws. Yet more than 20 years have passed since Congress passed significant gun-safety regulations.\n\nIn comparing politicians\u2019 willingness to address vaping with their hesitation on guns, some Twitter commentators made sarcastic use of familiar arguments against gun control.\n\nSelling more vapes is the only answer here.\n\n\n\nThe only thing that stops a bad guy with a vape, is a good guy with a vape. \u2014 Gissur Simonarson \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\udff4\udb40\udc67\udb40\udc62\udb40\udc73\udb40\udc63\udb40\udc74\udb40\udc7f (@GissiSim) September 12, 2019\n\n1. Vapes don't kill people, people kill people.\n\n2. Banning vapes will just mean that only bad guys can vape.\n\n3.
