On Thursday, one day after Trump\u2019s e-cigarette announcement, the CEOs of 145 U.S. companies urged Senate leaders to expand background checks for gun purchases and strengthen red-flag laws. The executives, who lead companies such as Yelp, Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods and Levi Strauss, wrote that they had a responsibility to \u201cstand up for the safety of our employees, customers and all Americans in the communities we serve across the country.\"\n\n\u201cDoing nothing about America\u2019s gun-violence crisis is simply unacceptable and it is time to stand with the American public on gun safety,\" the letter said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHer temperature spiked the day she decided to stop vaping. Now she\u2019s on life support.\n\nResearch has consistently found that a majority of Americans support background checks, gun licensing, assault weapons bans and other gun-control laws. Yet more than 20 years have passed since Congress passed significant gun-safety regulations.\n\nIn comparing politicians\u2019 willingness to address vaping with their hesitation on guns, some Twitter commentators made sarcastic use of familiar arguments against gun control.\n\nSelling more vapes is the only answer here.\n\n\n\nThe only thing that stops a bad guy with a vape, is a good guy with a vape. \u2014 Gissur Simonarson \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\udff4\udb40\udc67\udb40\udc62\udb40\udc73\udb40\udc63\udb40\udc74\udb40\udc7f (@GissiSim) September 12, 2019\n\n1.
