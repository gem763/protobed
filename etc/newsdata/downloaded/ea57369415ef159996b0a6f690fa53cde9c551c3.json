He is now hoping to turn that into a majority.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be a tough election and we are going to do the best we can,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Let the people decide\u2019 \u2013\n\nBritain\u2019s first December vote in nearly 100 years and third general election in four years finds the main opposition Labour Party splintered by bitter infighting.\n\nPro-EU supporters from big cities have been at loggerheads with Brexit-backing groups such as trade unions as well as party leader Jeremy Corbyn.\n\nBut the veteran socialist is an energetic campaigner who nearly managed to secure an upset victory in the last general election in 2017.\n\nCorbyn calls the vote \u201ca once-in-a-generation chance to transform our country\u201d and is promising \u201cthe most ambitious and radical campaign for real change\u201d.\n\nHis deputy and finance spokesman John McDonnell hailed his boss\u2019s abilities on the stump.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ll have a majority government by Christmas, so I can\u2019t think of a better Christmas present,\u201d he told BBC radio on Wednesday.\n\nLabour\u2019s Brexit promise is to seize power and then strike a more European-friendly agreement with Brussels that preserves many of the existing trade ties.\n\nIt would then let voters choose between that deal and the option of simply staying in the EU.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re saying \u2014 democracy, let the people decide,\u201d McDonnell said.\n\n\u2013 New hopefuls \u2013\n\nThe two other main players are adopting much firmer Brexit stances.\n\nThe fast-rising Liberal Democrats are going into the vote on a simple promise of stopping the EU-UK divorce by any means.\n\nThe party used a similar message to finish a surprising second in the European Parliament elections in May.\n\nA poll of polls compiled by Britain Elects put them in third place with 18 percent of the vote. The Conservatives led second-place Labour by 35 to 25 percent.\n\nA similar outcome could turn the Liberal Democrats into powerbrokers who decide the makeup and direction of the new government.\n\nBut party leader Jo Swinson said her polling showed the party was \u201cwithin a small swing\u201d of winning \u201chundreds of seats\u201d.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t be clearer. Neither Boris Johnson nor Corbyn is fit to be prime minister,\u201d Swinson told BBC radio.\n\n\u201cOur country deserves a better choice, and I am standing as candidate to be prime minister.\u201d\n\nThe Brexit Party of anti-European populist Nigel Farage stands on the opposite end of the political spectrum and holds fourth place on 11 percent.\n\nFarage was one of the Brexit campaign\u2019s figureheads who won the May European poll within months of forming his new group.\n\nBut his party\u2019s impact has been muted by Johnson\u2019s own firm pro-Brexit message. Farage is now denouncing Johnson\u2019s agreement with Brussels as a sellout of Brexit interests.", "description": "London (AFP) \u2013 Britain\u2019s political leaders tested their election pitches on Wednesday after parliament backed Prime Minister Boris", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/30/40f90a_can-clearer-boris-johnson-nor-corbyn-is-fit-prime-minister-liberal-democrats-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
