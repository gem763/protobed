Amy Klobuchar is using her first television ad of the 2020 presidential campaign to drive home the message that she could be a good antidote for the polarization of the Trump era.\n\nThe \u201cAll of America\u201d ad features television footage from the presidential debates, where Ms. Klobuchar of Minnesota distanced herself from her far-left Democratic rivals.\n\n\u201cIf you feel stuck in the middle of the extremes in our politics, and you are tired of the noise and the nonsense, you have a home with me,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar says in the ad. \u201cI am someone that tells the truth. I don\u2019t make promises that I can\u2019t keep. I have people\u2019s back, and I believe that to win you bring people with you and that is how you govern as well.\u201d\n\nMs. Klobuchar is among a number of underdog candidates who have lagged in the polls but still believe they have a path to the nomination.\n\nShe is betting that her Midwest roots will play well with the voters who turn out for the Iowa caucuses, which kick off the nomination race and set the tone for the rest of the race.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be the president for half of America, I want to be the president for all of America,\u201d the senator says.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
