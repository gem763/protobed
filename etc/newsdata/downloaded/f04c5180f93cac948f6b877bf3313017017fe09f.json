Max Rose Max RoseNY Rep.

Rose has been spearheading the efforts to look into how Congress can help tech platforms crack down on the scourge of violent and bigoted communities online.\n\n\"Because it feels like a game of whack-a-mole with extremist content pushed to other platforms like Telegram, it just means we have to redouble our efforts,\" he said.\n\nWhy Telegram?: Telegram is favored among extremists because it consists of public channels where users can post relatively unfiltered content, as well as a private encrypted messaging service where people can communicate without fear of surveillance. For years, Telegram was known as the go-to app for al Qaeda and ISIS terrorists, attracting those pushed off mainstream platforms like Facebook and Twitter.\n\nRead more here\n\nWARREN VS FACEBOOK: Sen.

The Obama administration repeatedly said it sought to oust the prosecutor because of concerns he was not doing enough to root out corruption.\n\n\"Facebook already helped elect Donald Trump once. Now, they're deliberately allowing a candidate to intentionally lie to the American people. This is a serious threat to our democracy,\" Warren tweeted Wednesday. \"We need transparency and accountability from Facebook.\"\n\nFacebook's side: Facebook announced this week that it would not remove the 30-second video from the Trump campaign, saying its decision was \"grounded in Facebook's fundamental belief in free expression, respect for the democratic process, and belief that in mature democracies with a free press, political speech is already arguably the most scrutinized speech there is.\"\n\nRead more here.\n\nSTOP RIGHT THERE: California Gov.
