Here\u2019s why. Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\nStory Highlights Most of the people at risk live in Asian countries such as China, India, Bangladesh, and Vietnam.\n\nThe study used improved methods to measure the actual elevation of land throughout Asia.\n\nScientists say global warming will be the primary cause of future sea-level rise.\n\nWorldwide, some 300 million people live where dangerous climate-triggered flooding will occur by mid-century, a new study suggests.\n\nThat's three times higher than previous estimates of 80 million. Most of the people at risk live in Asian countries such as China, India, Bangladesh, Vietnam and Indonesia.\n\nThe study shows \"the potential of climate change to reshape cities, economies, coastlines, and entire global regions within our lifetimes,\u201d said study lead author Scott Kulp, a senior scientist at Climate Central, a New Jersey-based non-profit organization.\n\n\u201cAs the tideline rises higher than the ground people call home, nations will increasingly confront questions about whether, how much, and how long coastal defenses can protect them,\u201d Kulp said.\n\nThe study used improved methods to measure the actual elevation of land throughout Asia. It found that in many locations, the land was actually several feet lower than had been thought.\n\nSea-level rise is one of the main impacts from global warming. Here's how it works: As the Earth's temperature warms, so do the seas. Heat-trapping greenhouse gases cause more land ice (glaciers and ice sheets) to melt and water to expand. Warmer water simply takes up more room than cooler water.\n\nGlobal warming will be the primary cause of future sea-level rise. The greatest uncertainty is how quickly the massive West Antarctic ice sheet will melt.\n\nOver the course of the 21st century, global sea levels are projected to rise between about 2 and 7 feet, and possibly more, according to Climate Central.\n\nIn this Sept. 4, 2019, file photo, people hold hands and navigate their way through a flooded street as it rains in Mumbai, India. The number of people threatened by climate change-triggered flooding is about three times higher than previously thought, a new study says. But it's not because of more water. It's because the land, especially in Asia and the developing world, is several feet lower than what had been calculated.
