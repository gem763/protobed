Last week my line was bitten clean in two by a shark near the harbour.'\n\nThis image posted online showed a fisherman holding half a whaler shark with its entrails hanging out in Middle Harbour\n\nLast month, an eight-year-old boy reeled in a whopping 314kg tiger shark off the NSW coast.\n\nJayden Millauro was fishing with his dad Jonathan and boat captain Ibby Dardas off the coast when he reeled in the beast.\n\nThe fishermen threw out a line of bait and the giant creature swam up to the back of their 7.3 metre boat, called The Undertaker, when Jayden managed to hook it.\n\nWhile the boy's father Jonathan Millauro wouldn't reveal the exact location of the catch, he did say it was near Brown Mountains, off the continental shelf.", "description": "Thomas Williams was on his way home from Manly Point on Sydney's northern beaches when he noticed an ominous fin a few metres from the bow of his yacht on Thursday morning.", "authors": ["Sahar Mourad For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/00/19862454-0-image-a-2_1571354618782.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
