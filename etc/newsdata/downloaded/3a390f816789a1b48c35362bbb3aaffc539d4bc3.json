And the identity of the culprit, in the minds of thousands of Tampa Bay Buccaneers fans on Sunday, was clear.\n\nThe Bucs lost 32-31 to the New York Giants. Thanks to rookie kicker Matt Gay, they\u2019d left five points \u2013 and a win \u2013 on the table. Gay missed three kicks, none more agonizing than a 34-yard field goal as time expired that sailed narrowly wide of the upright.\n\nAnd the fifth-round pick from Utah took the blame. Never mind that he\u2019d made four of his five field goal attempts, one from 52 yards. \u201cI have to make it from all around the field,\u201d he said postgame. \u201cHave to make them [from] short, from long. ... It has to go through.\u201d\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n[Watch live NFL games all season long for free on the Yahoo Sports app]\n\nYet there was another culprit, one whose final-minute gaffe was even more unforgivable. One play prior to Gay\u2019s 34-yard miss, with the ball on the 9-yard line and the clock stopped, the Bucs were flagged for delay of game. Why?\n\n\u201cI just took it on purpose,\u201d Bucs head coach Bruce Arians said postgame. \u201cYeah, he\u2019s better back, that field goal is easier five yards back.\u201d\n\nAnd if that sounds ludicrous, well, that\u2019s because it is.\n\n\u201cMakes no sense,\u201d kicking guru Chris Sailer told Yahoo Sports.\n\nAnother kicking coach who preferred to remain anonymous went a step further: \u201cCompletely asinine.\u201d\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers kicker Matt Gay looks down dejectedly after his costly miss against the Giants. (Getty)\n\nWhy taking a penalty makes no sense\n\nIn the wake of Tampa Bay\u2019s loss, Yahoo Sports reached out to several kicking experts to ask if there was any legitimate rationale for taking the delay of game. The answer, in short, was no.\n\n\u201cFrom what I have gathered about this situation,\u201d kicking coach Brandon Kornblue told Yahoo Sports, \u201cthat is absurd.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cI'm not sure what the coach is thinking,\u201d said Hugo Castellanos, a California-based coach. \u201cHe said he felt the kicker would be better from five yards further. We don't know what kind of communication took place between him and the kicker, but I would certainly not have made that kick more difficult by pushing it back.\u201d\n\nBoth Kornblue and Castellanos said that the only situation in which a coach should even consider moving a kick back five yards is if the ball is near the goal line on the hash marks, as opposed to in the middle of the field.\n\n\u201cSome coaches believe that it is a bit easier to avoid a sharp angle,\u201d Kornblue said, if the field goal is from less than 20 yards.\n\nBut, he clarifies: \u201cIt would never be better to kick farther from down the middle.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly what Gay was doing. The Bucs had the ball on the 9, right hash, with 13 seconds and one timeout remaining. After Jameis Winston\u2019s spike and the subsequent delay of game, Winston centered the ball. The Bucs then called time with four seconds left to set up a potential game-winner from dead center \u2013 but from 34 yards away instead of 29, thanks to the unnecessary penalty.\n\nIt was so \u201cabsurd\u201d that Kornblue, who has trained multiple NFL specialists, almost thought Arians\u2019 explanation was sarcastic.\n\nSailer, a former kicker and punter at UCLA, reiterated the others, himself, and common sense: \u201cIt makes no sense that you\u2019d want to kick from further out.\u201d\n\nData doesn\u2019t support the decision\n\nYears worth of NFL data agree with the experts. Since 2010, per Pro Football Reference data, NFL kickers have attempted 228 field goals from 29 yards out and 234 from 34 yards. The league-wide percentage from 29 yards is 94 percent. From five yards back?\n\nIt\u2019s 87.3 percent.\n\n(Data via Pro Football Reference. Table: Henry Bushnell/Yahoo Sports)\n\nVariance accentuates the disparity a bit. But it is indeed a disparity, and does confirm that Arians was flat-out wrong. Broaden the sample size, and the numbers tell a similar story. NFL kickers have hit 94.4 percent of their field goals from 28-30 yards this decade. Move the range back to 33-35, and their accuracy drops to 91.1.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear why Arians thought a 34-yarder would be easier than a 29-yarder. Or perhaps he didn\u2019t believe it at all. Perhaps it was an excuse for his own poor clock management. At his day-after news conference on Monday, he seemed to change his story slightly:\n\n#Bucs coach Bruce Arians explains what happened on delay of game penalty before Gay\u2019s missed FG attempt yesterday. A little different than yesterday\u2019s explanation, but seems evident that he didn\u2019t want Gay kicking from right haha no matter the distance. #GoBucs #NYGvsTN pic.twitter.com/TSAfSro2IV \u2014 Eduardo A. Encina (@EddieInTheYard) September 23, 2019\n\nEither way, though, he erred.\n\nSo did Gay, of course. \u201cHe\u2019s gotta make the kick,\u201d Arians said.\n\n\u201cFive yards isn\u2019t going to make a difference, really,\u201d Winston added.\n\nBut then a reporter shot back: \u201cDid you see the field goal? Five yards would\u2019ve made a difference.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nYahoo Sports\u2019 Jeff Eisenberg contributed reporting.\n\nHenry Bushnell is a features writer for Yahoo Sports.
