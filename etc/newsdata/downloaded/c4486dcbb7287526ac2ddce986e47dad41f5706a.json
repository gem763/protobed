Stage to Pressure World to Act on Venezuela", "language": "en", "text": "Latin American leaders called on the international community to find solutions to the crisis in Venezuela during the United Nations General Assembly this week.\n\nDictator Nicol\u00e1s Maduro opted not to attend this year\u2019s assembly alongside his closest ally, Cuban leader Ra\u00fal Castro, making socialist Bolivian leader Evo Morales the only Latin American ally of the regime to take the stage. Rather than defending Maduro, Morales used his speech to rail against global capitalism and its impact on the environment.\n\nHowever, the majority of regional leaders used their speech to call for the restoration of democracy in Venezuela, whose crisis is increasingly affecting the region as a whole.\n\nBrazil\u2019s Jair Bolsonaro\n\nBrazilian President Jair Bolsonaro blamed the current crisis on the \u201ccruelties of socialism,\u201d which have transformed Venezuela from one of the most prosperous countries in the region to one of the poorest in the world.\n\n\u201cVenezuela, formerly a vibrant and democratic country, is now experiencing the cruelties of socialism,\u201d he said, adding that the country was effectively controlled by Cuban military officials.\n\nThe conservative firebrand also admitted that despite the ousting of multiple left-wing governments in recent years, socialist ideology \u201cis still alive\u201d across the continent. \u201cWe will work with other countries to restore democracy in Venezuela and to fight socialism,\u201d he declared.\n\nEcuador\u2019s Lenin Moreno\n\nEcuadorian President Lenin Moreno called on the United Nations and the international community to find a solution to remove the \u201cdespotic\u201d Maduro regime, acknowledging that his country was struggling to manage the inflow of Venezuelan refugees entering the country.\n\n\u201cWe have welcomed some 500,000 Venezuelans brothers and sisters, victims of the worst exodus of our continent,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is now the job of the United Nations to find a definitive solution to the crisis in Venezuela.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn Ecuador, despite our insufficiencies of resources, we have attended to all those who reached our land up until the month of August,\u201d he said on Wednesday. \u201cToday, in this worldwide democratic forum, we call upon everyone to have a dialogue with the victims of this conflict, to help them to find a way out of a disaster created by an irresponsible de facto government. \u201d\n\nArgentina\u2019s Mauricio Macri\n\nArgentine President Mauricio Macri pledged to bring the Maduro regime to the International Criminal Court on charges of crimes against humanity.\n\n\u201cArgentina will bring to the International Criminal Court the crimes against humanity of the Venezuelan dictatorship,\u201d Macri said, before pleading with Maduro to accept the humanitarian aid offered by the rest of the region.\n\n\u201cWe are part of a regional response that seeks to mitigate the difficulties of millions of Venezuelan citizens,\u201d he added, pointing Argentina has already accepted 130,000 Venezuelan migrants.\n\nColombia\u2019s Iv\u00e1n Duque\n\nColombian President Iv\u00e1n Duque used his address to provide \u201cconclusive proof\u201d of the Maduro regime\u2019s support for Marxist terrorist groups within Colombia, many of whose leaders seek refuge in the neighboring country.\n\n\u201cMy government has irrefutable and conclusive proof that corroborates the support of the dictatorship for criminal and narco-terrorist groups that operate in Venezuela to try and attack Colombia,\u201d Duque said, holding up a copy of the dossier. \u201cThis dossier, of 128 pages, contains the evidence that shows the complicity of the regime of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro with the terrorist cartels that attack the Colombian people.\u201d\n\nPeru\u2019s Mart\u00edn Vizcarra\n\n\u201cWithout a doubt, a break in constitutional order and the entrenchment of power by an illegitimate regime in Venezuela is the root of a political, institutional, and humanitarian crisis which has led to an exodus of more than four million people,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cPeru will continue promoting initiatives to restore democracy in Venezuela in a peaceful process led by the Venezuelans themselves, and we will continue to condemn the regime\u2019s egregious human rights violations,\u201d he continued.\n\nChile\u2019s Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era\n\nChilean President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era blasted the regime as \u201ca corrupt and incompetent dictatorship that does not respect human rights and freedoms and has undeniable links with drug trafficking.\u201d\n\nHe added that the country\u2019s economic predicament has led to \u201cmassive migration\u201d of approximately four million people, and as such Venezuela has become \u201ca cause that all of Latin America is committed to.\u201d\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com", "description": "Latin American leaders called on the international community to find solutions to the crisis in Venezuela during this week's U.N Assembly.", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/protest-Venezuela-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
