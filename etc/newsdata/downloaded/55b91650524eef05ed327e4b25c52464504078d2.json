The new movie appears to draw on both King\u2019s novel and Stanley Kubrick\u2019s iconic 1980 film, using King\u2019s narrative about the adult Danny Torrance but featuring several callbacks to Kubrick\u2019s version of the original novel.\n\nMike Flanagan\u2019s adaptation of Doctor Sleep, which stars Ewan McGregor, was expected to distance itself from The Shining film, given that King has publicly slammed Kubrick\u2019s movie on more than one occasion. However, the new trailer directly references the movie, including a pointed shot of Room 237 (in the novel it was labeled Room 217).\n\nDiscussing the new release, producer Trevor Macy explained, \u201cIt is an adaptation of the novel Doctor Sleep, which is Stephen King\u2019s sequel to his novel, The Shining. But this also exists very much in the same cinematic universe that Kubrick established in his adaptation of The Shining.\u201d\n\nThis diplomatic approach came as a shock, mainly because of King\u2019s visceral dislike of Kubrick\u2019s film. Speaking to The Paris Review back in 2006, he said the film was \u201cToo cold\u201d and that there was \u201cNo sense of emotional investment in the family whatsoever[.]\u201d Further elaborating, King said that Shelley Duvall as Wendy was \u201cbasically a scream machine.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no sense of her involvement in the family dynamic at all,\u201d he argued, \u201cAnd Kubrick didn\u2019t seem to have any idea that Jack Nicholson was playing the same motorcycle psycho that he played in all those biker films he did [...]. The guy is crazy. So where is the tragedy if the guy shows up for his job interview and he\u2019s already bonkers? No, I hated what Kubrick did with that.\u201d", "description": "The trailer for Doctor Sleep, a film adaptation of Stephen King\u2019s The Shining sequel, is a treat for horror enthusiasts.", "authors": ["Biba Kang"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/films/2019/06/14/TELEMMGLPICT000001768162-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqgRl8BouVbC6HZnydG5Kn5giNZPxGyPPYFVxbQmnVxzE.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-06-14"}
