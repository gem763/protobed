Their goal: win more time to scrutinize the 110-page draft law that would execute the 585-page Brexit withdrawal agreement, instead of rushing it through this week.\n\nParliament\u2019s tactical victory here \u2014 seeming to force Johnson to break his political promise to have Britain out of the EU by the end of this month \u2014 could see them winning a battle but losing the war.\n\nWhile a defiant Johnson said he still wanted to leave the bloc on Oct. 31, and that the government would \u201caccelerate our preparations for a no-deal outcome,\u201d Parliament has most likely set the United Kingdom on course toward a December national election.\n\nFor the election to happen, the EU first needs to grant an extension to the Oct. 31 Brexit deadline, something the European Council\u2019s president, Donald Tusk, supports. Labour Party or Scottish National Party lawmakers would also need to join the Conservatives in voting to force the election.\n\nThe person most likely to win a national election: Johnson.\n\nJohnson\u2019s Conservative Party has led 55 consecutive national opinion polls. The latest, published Tuesday by YouGov, gives the Conservatives a 15-point lead over opposition Labour.\n\nEqually, an election would afford EU supporters in the Labour and Liberal Democrat parties the opportunity to organize a pro-EU electoral front. The parties could work together to block a new Johnson government and \u2014 if they win a majority of parliamentary seats \u2014 stop Brexit altogether.\n\nThe pro-EU minor parties and the on-the-fence Labour Party are unlikely to be able to put their differences aside, however. Labour is also unlikely to ditch Jeremy Corbyn, its wildly unpopular leader.\n\nThat means Johnson may have the last laugh. \u201cOne way or another, we will leave the EU with this deal to which this House has just given its assent,\u201d he said Tuesday. Given his poll numbers, and given that his Brexit deal is the only option that has won the support of Parliament, he might be right.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/25/a3/323803bc421ea833e64c62c00eca/190723-boris-johnson-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
