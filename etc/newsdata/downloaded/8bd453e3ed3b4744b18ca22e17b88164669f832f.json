They\u2019re gambling that refusing a settlement will lead to a much bigger payoff. Republican attorneys general are angling to persuade a bankruptcy judge to order a quick but guaranteed payout for opioids victims.\n\nThe partisan split \u2014 most of the 24 states rejecting the Purdue deal are led by Democrats \u2014 marks two different strategies, with the GOP going for a more pragmatic approach that may also reflect the party\u2019s traditionally closer relationship with industry. Democrats meanwhile are aiming to send a broader message about corporate accountability, not just to Purdue, but to the large collection of even more powerful companies still tied up in opioid litigation. They are leery of a repeat of the financial crisis, where companies were dissolved but their leaders weren't punished.\n\nEven as the split lays bare two different philosophies, it could complicate a global settlement of the opioid crisis, which plaintiffs have estimated will cost the country nearly half a trillion dollars in substance abuse treatment, criminal justice, health care and other costs. Resolution of the Purdue case could tip off drug companies and distributors on how to emerge from the litigation at the lowest cost.\n\n\u201cThe clear message is, we aren\u2019t rolling over here,\u201d Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said. \u201cWe are representing our states and our citizens who have suffered extensive harm and we want to make sure we obtain a sufficient amount to address what is a public health crisis.\"\n\nPOLITICO Pulse newsletter Get the latest on the health care fight, every weekday morning \u2014 in your inbox.

Last week, the New York attorney general told a state court judge her office had uncovered evidence the Sacklers had siphoned money out of Purdue to devalue the company and hide their wealth from lawsuits.\n\n\u201cThe Sacklers have withdrawn the vast majority of the value of this company so Purdue Pharma, the drug company, is just a shell of itself,\u201d said North Carolina\u2019s Democratic attorney general, Josh Stein. \u201cI believe they need to be held accountable.\u201d\n\nThe vitriol reflects the Sacklers' position as the poster children of drug industry malfeasance in an opioid epidemic that has killed an estimated 400,000 people over the past two decades. Purdue\u2019s Oxycontin was seen as a much-abused drug in the early phase of the epidemic, but the company only holds about 3 percent of the opioid market in the United States now.\n\nPurdue, which made its first appearance in a New York bankruptcy court on Tuesday, has reached a tentative deal with 24 states and nearly 2,000 cities and counties that would put the company's assets into a public health benefit trust. The Sacklers would also sell their international drug company Mundipharma and contribute the money from that sale to the settlement. The Sacklers would also pony up at least $3 billion from the sale of another company.\n\nThe company and the family behind it would admit no wrongdoing as part of the deal, a key sticking point for those who oppose it.\n\nThe company sparked outrage anew in a White Plains, N.Y., court this week by asking to pay \"certain employees\" $34 million in bonuses to keep them from leaving Purdue during its trials, The Washington Post reported. Plaintiffs in the case said Purdue should put all its funds into repairing the damage of the opioid crisis it is alleged to have helped cause.\n\nDemocratic attorneys general are skeptical the deal will be as large as their GOP counterparts suggest, because its size is largely determined by the sale of the Sackler's international drug company and the volume of drugs the new Purdue trust sells in the future.\n\n\u201cFrankly any suggestion that Purdue has put $10 billion to $12 billion on the table is false. ... No one has offered $10 to $12 billion in guaranteed cash. It\u2019s all very contingent,\u201d said Connecticut Attorney General William Tong, a Democrat.\n\nThe Texas attorney general\u2019s office says it is confident the deal would bring a minimum of $4 billion.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201710/3294/1155968404_5631055177001_5630877304001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true\n\nThe settlement does not touch moneys the Sackler family allegedly pulled out of Purdue over the years, several attorneys general said, and many are wary of appearing to let them off the hook.\n\nThe holdouts seem \"less interested in securing whatever money they can get, the realistic money that is out there, [than] sending a political message,\u201d said John Leppard, who tracks health policy implications on financial markets for Washington Analysis.\n\nColorado's Weiser says it's about leverage, keeping the pressure on the Sacklers to get a better deal.\n\n\u201cAs long as the Sacklers have to worry about their liability, they have a considerable incentive to reach a fair and just settlement,\u201d he said.\n\nTo that end, North Carolina on Tuesday became the latest state to sue the Sackler family in state court, saying they \u201chelped create and fuel the opioid crisis.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Sacklers have not been willing to put meaningful skin in the game to help clean up the mess they\u2019ve helped create,\u201d Stein said in a statement. The Sacklers must be held accountable. They need to write a check.\u201d\n\nOne of the critical issues the court will decide is whether Democrats will have a chance to fight for a bigger check by holding out, or are mistakenly putting their citizens at the back of a very long line.\n\n\u201cThis is a very high stakes game of poker they are playing right now and they are trying to see who blinks first,\u201d said Jonathan Lipson, an expert in bankruptcy law at Temple University.\n\nIf the bankruptcy judge stays or ends all outside litigation against the Sacklers, states that agree to the deal could be paid well ahead of the states that did not.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a pecking order in bankruptcy ... and those who have agreed to a settlement kind of have first dibs,\u201d said Leppard.\n\nWhile Republicans tend to be closer than Democrats to the pharmaceutical industry, they say they are cutting the deal for pragmatic reasons. Protracted litigation will only slow their access to billions of dollars needed for public health programs to fight the opioids crisis, the GOP attorneys general say. The longer Purdue is tied up in legal proceedings, the less money the company will have left for any payout.\n\nAnd they are skeptical of the Democratic attorneys general plans to take on the Sackler family directly.\n\n\u201cEven if you were able to get to personal liability, most of this money is located overseas in a series of trusts. What you\u2019re talking about is taking a long shot to litigate over 10 to 12 years to chase ... money around the globe. ... That doesn\u2019t strike me as a good risk,\u201d said Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost, a Republican.\n\nThat argument won over New Mexico and Michigan, the two Democratic-led states that agreed to the settlement. Nebraska is the only state that hasn\u2019t joined in the litigation.\n\nMichigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said her state is \u201cbest served by an infusion of funds into our state as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one is doubting the moral culpability of anyone involved, but moral culpability doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into legal liability for one, and it doesn\u2019t translate into those damages actually being paid,\u201d said an official for the Texas attorney general\u2019s office.\n\nStates on both sides say their deliberations continue. \u201cNobody has stopped talking,\u201d said Connecticut\u2019s Tong.\n\n", "description": "The vitriol reflects the Sacklers' position as the poster children of drug industry malfeasance.", "authors": ["Sarah Karlin-Smith", "Dan Goldberg", "Brianna Ehley"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/91/36/7bebc4d3414392aa4ae6e04718d9/190326-purdue-pharma-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
