The fault is thought to affect around one in every 500 devices.\n\nIrish officials two days ago recalled three batches of Emerade pens thought to be affected by the error.\n\nBut because of a critical shortage of auto-injectors, their UK counterpart said the faulty devices cannot be recalled and replaced.\n\nBatches of the Emerade auto-injector pens - which come in doses of 150, 300 and 500 micrograms - are used to treat acute allergic reactions to food such as peanuts. Some have reportedly failed to activate\n\nIt is presumed Ireland's healthcare system was able to dish out replacement adrenaline pens due to its smaller population.\n\nThe NHS, however, states the supply issue is 'critical' and pens should be saved for those who 'truly need them'.\n\nAround 250,000 allergy sufferers in the UK rely on auto-injectors, which are available on prescription in the UK.\n\nThe most common brand is EpiPen, but Jext and Emerade are also doled out on the NHS as alternatives. They are all also available privately.\n\nEmerade pens are the only brand which offer three strengths - 150mcg, 300mcg and 500mcg of adrenaline.\n\nThe Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) warned all three versions could be affected by the fault.\n\nIt also urged patients to try activating failed pens in emergency situations in a stark warning issued today alongside the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC).\n\nSamantha Atkinson, MHRA director of inspection, enforcement and standards, said: 'It is important to always carry two pens.\n\n'At the first signs of anaphylaxis, the patient or carer should administer an Emerade pen by pressing it firmly against the thigh.\n\n'If the pen fails to activate, they should immediately use the second pen.' She added 999 should be immediately called.\n\n'While waiting for the ambulance, additional attempts should be made to activate a failed pen if the patient is not improving,' Ms Atkinson added.\n\n'Patient safety is our highest priority and our role, as regulator, is to make sure medicines and medical devices are safe and effective.\n\n'Patients experiencing any problem with Emerade failing to activate should report the incident... and keep the pen for further examination.'\n\nWHAT IS ANAPHYLACTIC SHOCK? Anaphylaxis, also known as anaphylactic shock, can kill within minutes. It is a severe and potentially life-threatening reaction to a trigger, such as an allergy. The reaction can often be triggered by certain foods, including peanuts and shellfish. However, some medicines, bee stings, and even latex used in condoms can also cause the life-threatening reaction. According to the NHS, it occurs when the immune system overreacts to a trigger. Symptoms include: feeling lightheaded or faint; breathing difficulties \u2013 such as fast, shallow breathing; wheezing; a fast heartbeat; clammy skin; confusion and anxiety and collapsing or losing consciousness. It is considered a medical emergency and requires immediate treatment. Insect stings are not dangerous for most victims but a person does not necessarily have to have a pre-existing condition to be in danger. An incremental build-up of stings can cause a person to develop an allergy, with a subsequent sting triggering the anaphylactic reaction.\n\nAnaphylaxis, or anaphylactic shock, can kill in minutes. It is a severe and potentially life-threatening reaction to a trigger, such as an allergy.\n\nIt can cause swelling of the throat or tongue, shortness of breath, vomiting, and low blood pressure within minutes.\n\nThe MHRA has written to clinicians asking them to share this advice with all patients and carers who use an Emerade pen.\n\nEmma Hammett, founder of FirstAidForLife, said adrenaline pens, in particular Emerade versions, had been known to misfire.\n\nShe added: 'Our advice is for anyone prescribed an adrenaline auto-injector to have immediate access to two at all times.\n\n'There have been reported manufacturing faults, which have resulted in the device failing completely, or failing to deliver the necessary dose.\n\n'The Emerade pens were misfiring over summer and were recalled due to being faulty.\n\n'The problem was thought to be fixed but this new issue shows it can happen often.'\n\nA separate batch of Emerade pens were found to be faulty in July, with many of the needles not being released from the device.\n\nBut the MHRA says the new issue has to do with adrenaline failing to shoot through the needle into the patient's leg.\n\nMs Hammett added that some sufferers were unable to get access to two pens at all times due to shortages.\n\n'A big problem is that there are huge shortages and pharmacies are being told to cut back on how many adrenaline pens they prescribe.\n\n'Children are supposed to have two pens at home, two at school and two at granny's house. But they don't always have this access anymore.'\n\nThe MHRA and DHSC advise patients who suffer a reaction to press the pen firmly up against their thigh and if it fails to activate immediately use their spare pen.\n\nMailOnline reported last October that pharmacists were being told to cut back on the amount of adrenaline pens doled out to children.\n\nAmid a 'critical' global shortage, the NHS told chemists to ask parents how many adrenaline pens they have at home before deciding how many to give out.\n\nBausch & Lomb UK Limited, the manufacturers of the Emerade pens, is said to be looking into the issue. The firm did not comment.", "description": "Around 374,000 Emerade pens are currently in the hands of patients in the UK. The fault is thought to affect around one in every 500 devices.
