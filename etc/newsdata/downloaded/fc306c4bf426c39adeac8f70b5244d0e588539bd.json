That's because there are a number of areas that are too small to create a ratings point, so agencies couldn't target long-tail TV audiences in more remote communities.\n\nThe big picture: Most agencies don't transact on impressions at the local broadcast level, says Kathy Doyle, EVP of Local Investment at MAGNA Global. \"We were the first ones, and as far as I know. The other media agencies I've spoken to were talking about putting it in place for 2020, last I heard.\"\n\nWhat's next: Expect other local television groups to move to impressions quickly. Once agencies begin transacting at the local level for one group via impressions, the entire ecosystem will follow.\n\nTV networks plan to include out-of-home (OOH) audiences in national ratings in 2020, Variety's Brian Steinberg reports. That would have major ramifications for networks like ESPN and CNBC, which are mostly viewed out-of-home.\n\nThe bottom line: \"This is a game-changer for local,\" says Frank Comerford, the chief revenue officer and president of commercial operations for NBCUniversal Owned Television Stations.", "description": "Local TV and radio are the last forms of media to still rely on traditional ratings points to measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/-DkNk4nWABUQhX3OXhNRAcmt6LA=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/09/10/1568122899920.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
