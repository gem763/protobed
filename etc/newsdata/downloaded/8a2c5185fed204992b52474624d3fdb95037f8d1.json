John C. Fr\u00e9mont, the man after whom Tesla\u2019s hometown of 233,000 was named in 1956, was America\u2019s Pathfinder. As a pioneer, he helped popularize the settling of the West. As a soldier, he helped expand America. And as a politician, he helped hew the path for America to become the land of the free.\n\nBut Tesla stockholders beware: Fr\u00e9mont\u2019s biography, like California\u2019s history, was rocked by earthquakes. The army arrested and court-martialed him. Abraham Lincoln fired him. The Panic of 1873 bankrupted him.", "description": "John C.
