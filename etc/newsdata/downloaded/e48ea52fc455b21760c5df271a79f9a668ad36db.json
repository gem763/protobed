Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the third-ranking House Republican, claimed Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump is partly to blame for Turkey\u2019s invasion of northern Syria.\n\nThough Trump has faced bipartisan backlash for withdrawing American troops from the region ahead of the Turkish assault against U.S-allied Kurdish forces, Cheney said Democrats should also be held responsible for the crisis.\n\n\u201cThe impeachment proceedings that are going on and what the Democrats are doing themselves to try to weaken this president is part of this,\u201d Cheney said Monday on \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was not an accident that the Turks chose this moment to roll across the border,\u201d Cheney added. \u201cAnd I think the Democrats have got to pay very careful attention to the damage that they\u2019re doing with impeachment proceedings.\u201d\n\n.@RepLizCheney says that Turkey decided to attack the Kurds base on the Democrats starting impeachment proceedings. The Democrats don't have control over Trump's decision to withdraw military from the region. pic.twitter.com/1ANgViU1T8 \u2014 Oliver Willis (@owillis) October 14, 2019\n\nA spokesman for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who launched the impeachment inquiry into Trump last month over his dealings with Ukraine, called Cheney\u2019s theory \u201cdelusional.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is strong bipartisan opposition to the President\u2019s decision to let Turkey bomb Northern Syria and effectively unleash ISIS,\u201d a spokesperson for Pelosi told HuffPost in a statement. \u201cNo delusional talking point can change that fact.\u201d\n\nTurkey launched an incursion on Thursday against the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, the main U.S. ally in the fight against ISIS in Syria, days after Trump announced the U.S. was withdrawing its forces in the region.\n\nOver 130,000 people have been displaced and hundreds of ISIS supporters have escaped as Turkish-led forces have targeted Syrian border towns held by Kurdish militia. Turkish-backed Arab fighters have killed several Kurdish captives as well as Hervin Khalaf, the head of a Kurdish political party.\n\nForeign policy experts say Trump\u2019s decision to abandon the Kurds is immoral and a threat to U.S national security.\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper said Sunday that the U.S. tried to \u201cdissuade\u201d Turkey from attacking the Kurds, but Trump has repeatedly stated he\u2019s OK with the opposing forces fighting.\n\n\u201cThe Kurds and Turkey have been fighting for many years,\u201d Trump tweeted Sunday. \u201cOthers may want to come in and fight for one side or the other. Let them!\u201d\n\nThough Republicans quickly pushed back on Trump\u2019s moves, which essentially greenlighted Turkey\u2019s invasion, some have begun to retreat in their criticism of the president.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), normally a Trump supporter who was among the most vocal critics of the U.S. withdrawal, went easy on the president during an appearance Monday on \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d\n\n\u201cI blame Turkey,\u201d Graham said. \u201d[Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan] made the biggest mistake of his political life. The president has tried to hold this together.\u201d\n\nCheney and Graham are spearheading a bipartisan push for sanctions against Turkey as the country\u2019s military assault against the Kurds intensifies. Graham said he is set to meet with Trump to discuss the sanctions Monday afternoon.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to crush Erdogan until he stops the bloodshed,\u201d Graham said.\n\nLove HuffPost?
