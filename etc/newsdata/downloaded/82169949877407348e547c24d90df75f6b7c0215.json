Lately, I\u2019ve started hearing one that goes something like this: Sure, what Trump did was \u201cinappropriate\u201d and wrong\u2014but it isn\u2019t impeachable.\n\nAt first blush, the sounds both plausible and nuanced. One could surely imagine a scenario where a president does something that is bad but not bad enough to warrant removal from office. In fact, it happens all the time. It was often said\u2014by Democrats, and even by a number of Republicans\u2014of Bill Clinton. What is more, one might even be tempted to congratulate these honest Republicans for making this brave concession. Of course, it\u2019s not bravery, but desperation, which leads one to grasp for what is the last possible argument to settle on after all the better ones have been tried and abandoned.\n\nThe only problem is that this is an intellectually dishonest and untenable position.", "description": "Now it\u2019s that what Potus did was bad, but not bad enough for impeachment.
