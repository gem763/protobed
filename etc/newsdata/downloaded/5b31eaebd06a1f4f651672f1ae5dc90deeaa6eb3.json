Since Extinction Rebellion itself floated the idea earlier this year, the protest movement has clearly had second thoughts, saying it \u201cdoes not support an action at Heathrow as designed at this time\u201d.\n\nStopping buses crossing Waterloo Bridge, Parliament Square and Oxford Circus while the Metropolitan Police stood and watched generated plenty of publicity for the climate change protestors. While hundreds of thousands of Londoners were inconvenienced by the protests, there was evidently a lot of support.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

mood changed. Vanloads of police from as far away as South Wales were drafted in to prevent a shutdown.\n\nThe heavy response was partly because Heathrow is seen as a vital piece of national infrastructure \u2013 which, for campaigners concerned about the environmental damage caused by aviation, makes it a prime target. But the authorities know that Europe\u2019s biggest airport is also a prime prospective target for terrorists.\n\nHeathrow Pause insists: \u201cWe are committed to taking every possible step to ensure nobody is hurt or endangered, and have put stringent safety measures and protocols in place regarding the use of drones, to guarantee the action complies with our objectives and concerns.\u201d\n\nBut there is alarm that a peaceful protest aimed at halting flights could be exploited by a terror group.\n\nLetting fly a \u201cswarm\u201d of drones near Heathrow could divert resources away from policing the airport perimeter. And an event supposed to involve only \u201ctoy\u201d drones could be used as cover for something far more sinister.\n\nHow, though, could the authorities hope to close down a mass drone attack when the person (or people) behind the 33-hour closure of Gatwick just before Christmas 2018 has yet to be found?\n\nThe perpetrator of that travel-wrecking episode may have been an environmentalist, but he or she was professional and sophisticated. The Heathrow Pause protest looks like being neither.\n\nIf drones do get off the ground in one of the open spaces around the airport at 3am on Friday 13 September, I do not expect them still to be flying by the time the first flight from the Far East touches down at Heathrow 90 minutes later.", "description": "Shutting down Europe\u2019s busiest airport should be a walk in the park: that is the view of the Heathrow Pause group of climate activists.
