It also had the largest LGBTQ presence on a prime-time series.\n\n\"At this point in time, in our existence, if 'Pose' were to receive an Emmy, that would be global validation,\" Jackson, who plays Elektra, told ABC News. \"Even if it's just in the U.S.\"\n\nBut a win could be more than just validation.\n\n\"You're saying to people that we recognize this story. We recognize and we acknowledge and we uplift,\" she said. \"Because ... we don't need validation.\"\n\nJackson went on, \"We need you to see that we're here, we need you to see that our stories are truth. And we're going to need you to get off those stories and start helping to be able to live in spaces where we don't have to fear for our lives.\"\n\nHer co-star, Indya Moore, who plays Angel, agreed, adding that the show's significance goes beyond the idea of winning an award.\n\n\"Just to imagine how 'Pose' influenced the way that people raise their children...or changing the ways they love their kids,\" the actor said. \"And that literally changes the future of your child's life. The way that you love them, the way you make space for them. And to know something like 'Pose' influences people and their hearts and their family dynamics this way. I mean it's just something that cannot be measured by an award.\"\n\nThe 71st Emmy Awards will air this Sunday night on FOX.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
