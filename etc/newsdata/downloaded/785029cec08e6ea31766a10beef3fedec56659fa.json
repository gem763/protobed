It focuses on whether Facebook\u2019s FB, +0.70% dominance is stifling competition, limiting choice for consumers and costing advertisers more money.\n\n\u201cBig Tech must account for its actions,\u201d Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry, a Republican, said in a statement.\n\nThe group of attorneys general also worries about Facebook\u2019s handling of customer data, James said. That drew scrutiny after firms were able to harvest information in attempts to influence the 2016 presidential election.\n\nFacebook didn\u2019t immediately respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nThe group backing the state-level probe by the seven states and Washington now includes 21 Democratic attorneys general, 18 Republicans and an independent from 39 states and Guam. The list also includes several states that cannot confirm their participation in pending investigations, James said.\n\nFacebook and other tech giants have also been feeling the heat from federal regulators. The Federal Trade Commission recently fined Facebook $5 billion for privacy violations, but consumer advocates and some public officials criticized that as too lenient.\n\nA separate investigation, led by Texas and supported by attorneys general from 48 states, Puerto Rico and Washington is looking at whether Alphabet\u2019s GOOGL, +0.90% GOOG, +0.86% Google is engaging in monopolistic behavior with its dominant online search and advertising business.\n\nDistrict of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine, a Democrat involved in both investigations, said in a statement that he wants to ensure Facebook is \u201cgiving a fair shake\u201d to the American people.\n\n\u201cNo company gets a pass if it throttles competitors and exploits consumers,\u201d Racine said.", "description": "Facebook\u2019s latest foes: nearly every U.S. state.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GN074_facebo_ZG_20180724162821.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
