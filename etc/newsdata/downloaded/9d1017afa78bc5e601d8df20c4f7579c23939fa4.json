Sources also hint that the device could actually hit the shelves alongside its budget offerings in 2020 spring (with Pixel 4a and 4a XL, maybe).\n\nHowever, this isn't a bad thing, considering that 5G is still in its early stages in the US and the chipset handling 5G connectivity still lacks optimisation to enable better battery life.\n\nDon't Miss 349 SHARES 304 SHARES 265 SHARES\n\nGoogle\n\nSpeaking of Google's Pixel 4 and Pixel 4XL, the Mountain View giant has already teased the images of Pixel 4, giving us a clear idea for what we can expect from the smartphone. Moreover, leaks post that have given us even more information of this flagship.\n\nThe Pixel 4 is expected to feature a 5.8-inch display, while the 4XL is set to offer a 6.4-inch panel. Both are expected to have a Quad HD+ resolution. The top of the display is going to house a bunch of sensors (as teased by Google) that will enable gesture-based navigation by simply waving on top of the screen.\n\nBen Geskin\n\nUnder the hood, Pixel 4 and Pixel 4XL is expected to get Qualcomm's Snapdragon 855 Plus, a slightly overclocked version of the regular Snapdragon 855, paired with 6GB of RAM as well as 128GB and 256GB storage variants.\n\nGoogle teased a dual-camera setup on the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4XL. While there is no exact information about the primary camera, the secondary camera is expected to get a 16-megapixel sensor with a telephoto lens for crispy zoom images. The device is also expected to get a single front camera for selfies this time.", "description": "After iPhone 11, the next phone everyone's anticipating this year is the Pixel 4 by Google.
