Instead, Buttigieg offered a list of proposals to fix the VA.\n\nOf the many ways the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is different from his better-known rivals, there is this: his ingrained emotional restraint in a show-all-tell-all era.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t really get the warm fuzzies from him,\u201d said Lisa Ann Spilman, a retired Air Force officer who attended Buttigieg\u2019s event. \u201cBut I really like how intelligent and down to earth he is.\u201d\n\nAs Buttigieg, whose campaign appears better positioned organizationally in Iowa and financially overall than former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s, attempts to climb into the top tier of Democrats, voters will be taking a measure of him in all ways, including whether he can make the kind of personal connection they have come to expect, at least since Bill Clinton showed he could feel their pain.\n\nButtigieg chafes at being labeled an emotionless technocrat, and his supporters cite his intellectual agility as his main draw, particularly against someone like President Donald Trump, whose strained relationship with the truth is so frequently on display.\n\nIn a candidate debate Tuesday, Buttigieg showed rare outward fire, pointedly challenging Sen. Elizabeth Warren on her health care plan and former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke on gun control. \u201cI don\u2019t need lessons from you on courage, political or personal,\u201d Buttigieg said to O\u2019Rourke.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind being a little professorial at times,\u201d Buttigieg acknowledged in a conversation with reporters last month. He added, \u201cSometimes I think I\u2019m misread because I\u2019m laidback. I\u2019m misread as being bloodless.\u201d\n\nBut to describe him as wooden or mechanical gets it wrong. Upbeat in his trademark white shirt with sleeves half-rolled, Buttigieg projects energy and youthful diligence.\n\nHe is not a fiery podium speaker like Sen. Bernie Sanders. He isn\u2019t given to big hugs or open self-reflection, like Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren.\n\nIn interactions with voters, Buttigieg\u2019s style is evolving. During a late summer stop in southeast Iowa, he noted his mother-in-law \u201cis alive because of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d but moved on without describing her illness or asking if his audience had similar experiences.\n\nIt\u2019s notable because Buttigieg is trying to frame his message around empathy in what he calls the nation\u2019s \u201ccrisis of belonging.\u201d\n\nAnd it does not always work. When the question turned to cancer at the Iowa State Fair, he said before discussing his plans, \u201cCancer took my father earlier this year, so this is personal,\u201d skipping over any elaboration of the pillar Joe Buttigieg was to his only child.\n\nWhen the questioner noted her family\u2019s loss, he said politely, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. So, we\u2019re in the same boat,\u201d and then turned to a discussion of research.\n\nButtigieg\u2019s mother, Anne Montgomery, says in boyhood, her son was fun, curious, literate and multitalented, but \u201ca reserved person.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a part of his life for a long time,\u201d she said in an Associated Press interview.\n\nWhat Buttigieg suggests is his tendency to \u201ccompartmentalize\u201d has been a liability for some other candidates, most notably for the 1988 Democratic presidential nominee, Michael Dukakis.\n\nHe offered an almost programmatic answer when asked during a nationally televised debate if he would support the death penalty if his wife were raped and murdered.\n\nDukakis, who lost in a landslide, acknowledges today that he \u201cbotched it\u201d and that his answer fed the narrative that the pragmatic, policy-oriented Massachusetts governor was emotionless.\n\nButtigieg, Dukakis told the AP, is warm and thoughtful, \u201cbut he also happens to be very, very bright, and that, I think, is the biggest part of his appeal.\u201d Dukakis has endorsed his home state senator, Warren.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a typical politician,\u201d said Kelsie Goodman, an associate principal for a Des Moines area high school who first saw Buttigieg at an event last month. \u201cAnd he\u2019s an intellectual judo master.\u201d\n\nAs the campaign progresses, there are signs Buttigieg is becoming more comfortable opening up.\n\nAt an outdoor event at Des Moines\u2019 Theodore Roosevelt High School last Saturday, he ignited laughter and cheers for his answer to a question about how he would approach debating Trump.\n\n\u201cWe know what he\u2019s going to do, and it just doesn\u2019t get to me. Look, I can deal with bullies. I\u2019m gay and I grew up in Indiana. I\u2019ll be fine,\u201d he deadpanned.\n\nIn a rare personal revelation, he told reporters on a bus ride across northern Iowa that he dreads the thought of his husband, Chasten, being subjected to the cruelties of modern politics.\n\n\u201cAnother agonizing feeling is to watch that happening to someone you love,\u201d he said. \u201cAt least if it\u2019s happening to me, I can go out there and fight back.\u201d\n\nStill, what Buttigieg\u2019s most vocal advocates praise as his coolness so far seems to be doing little to dampen views of him in Iowa, where he has invested heavily in time and money in hopes of a breakthrough finish. In a September CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll, 69% of likely Iowa caucus participants said they viewed Buttigieg favorably, second only to Warren.\n\nWhere Buttigieg clearly connects personally is along the rope line with supporters and when the merely curious meet him after he leaves the stage.\n\nIn these moments, he has met people who describe their own stories of stepping out of the shadows, as Buttigieg did coming out as a gay man in 2015. Buttigieg regularly mentions Iowa teenager Bridgette Bissell, who described the courage she took from meeting him to announce she was autistic.\n\nSimilar moments, Buttigieg says, prompted him to build his campaign around repairing Americans\u2019 sense of connectedness.\n\nIn Waterloo recently, local organizer Caitlin Reedy introduced Buttigieg to hundreds at a riverside rally, explaining that she was drawn to him by having experienced the uneasiness of sharing her diagnosis with diabetes.\n\nLeaning forward in his chair on the bus the next day, Buttigieg said the campaign was teaching him how people \u2014 feeling left out racially, ethnically, culturally, economically \u2014 yearn to connect.\n\n\u201cWhere it comes is from going through the process of understanding that you\u2019re different,\u201d he said, \u201cand then understanding that that\u2019s part of what you have to offer.\u201d\n\n\u201cJoin me in picturing that kind of presidency,\u201d he told more than 600 in Waterloo, \u201cnot for the glorification of the president, but for the unification of the people.\u201d", "description": "WATERLOO, Iowa (AP) \u2014 John McAnear, a 77-year-old Air Force veteran, stood in an audience of hundreds in suburban Des Moines with an oxygen tank at his", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/17/dc144c_election-2020-pete-buttigieg-65309-pete-buttigieg-in-oct-15-2019-photo-democratic-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
