The owners, Jeff and Paulette Carpoff, have not been yet charged with any crimes, but two employees pleaded guilty last week to fraud and the Carpoffs agreed to sell the cars and put the proceeds into a seized assets account until the matter is settled. It was the largest auction of a single collection ever held by the federal law enforcement agency.\n\nThe Trans Am was a replica of the one Reynolds drove in \u201cSmokey and the Bandit\u201d and attracted the fifth highest bid among the cars at the Woodland, Calif., event.\n\nAhead of it was another replica, this one of the 1967 Mustang Shelby GT500SE Super Snake known as \u201cEleanor\u201d from the 2000 film \u201cGone in 60 Seconds,\u201d that went for $200,000.\n\nA similar 1967 Shelby GT500SE tribute, but not an official Eleanor car, that was built by Riley Performance Motorsports with a 790 hp supercharged V8 was next at $206,000.\n\nAn authentic and fully restored 1969 Dodge Daytona sold for $215,000 to come in second behind one more GT500SE continuation car that went for $232,000.\n\nAnother notable car that sold for $167,000 was a 2007 Ford Mustang Shelby GT500 that the Carpoffs bought for $1 million at an auction benefiting Las Vegas first responders three weeks after the city was rocked by a mass shooting that took 58 lives in October 2017.\n\nAll but one of the cars, trucks, boats and motorcycles found new owners, with a top price of $1,051,225 paid for a 2018 Prevost Featherlite H3-45 motorhome.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "description": "Burt Reynolds' 'Bandit' Trans Am among the lots sold.", "authors": ["Gary Gastelu", "Gary Gastelu Is Foxnews.Com'S Automotive Editor.
