From dealing with crazy fans professing their love to super fans who turn into bona fide stalkers - these women got candid about the perils of stardom and how they dealt with it.\n\nNikita Dutta\n\nInstagram\n\nLast seen in Kabir Singh, Nikita Dutta recently had a weird experience that left her feeling restless.

She went on to block him, but that's when things got worse.\n\n\" When I was out of the country shooting, the same guy followed me down to the country I was in. I don\u2019t know how he got to know where I was because it was nowhere out in the news. He knew the hotel I was staying in and he stayed in the same hotel, one day when I was walking out of the gym, we bumped into each other. Even while I was flying back, he was on the same flight back with me\", revealed a terrified Nikita.\n\nNikita didn't want things to get messy which is why she didn't file a complaint against him but simply stopped going to that particular gym.

All of a sudden new apps and icons too started appearing on her phone.\n\n\"Worse was when I saw a new icon called screen recording on my phone and it was on. I also didn't have anything in my photo gallery anymore. That was the moment I changed all my passwords and took all security measures possible. It is very scary how someone can go to this length to stalk you. That surely led me to doubt every person on social media and I posted limited info on social media\", says Parul.\n\nChitrashi Rawat\n\nInstagram\n\nFormer Indian hockey player and film actress, Chitrashi Rawat had a disturbing experience while traveling for a shoot a few years back in Delhi.
