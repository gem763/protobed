Within an hour, the rescue sent a plane to pick up the dog, named Miracle, and send him to the facility\u2019s location in Palm Beach County, Florida, for life-saving medical treatment.\n\nThe people involved in Miracle\u2019s rescue estimate that he had been trapped for more than three weeks.\n\n\u201cWhat an incredible story that we were able to discover this dog alive after being trapped for so long,\u201d Simmons said in a statement. \u201cWe are using the latest technology for our recovery teams to locate these animals. In this case drones played a key role.\u201d\n\nThe rescue said that Miracle is the 138th dog to be rescued from the Bahamas, which is still recovering from the effects of September\u2019s Category 5 storm.", "description": "A search-and-rescue team discovered a dog alive under a pile of debris in the Bahamas, more than three weeks after Hurricane Dorian.", "authors": ["Katherine Rodriguez"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/wi/ap/05/a6d7f3_aptopix-tropical-weather-north-carolina-50369-mobile-homes-are-upended-e1567723722779-639x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
