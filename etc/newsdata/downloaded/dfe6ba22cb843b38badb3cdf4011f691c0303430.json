On the other hand, the upside moves couldn\u2019t gain traction, as the lack of conviction from either side was apparent. Investors are waiting and waiting for the right signals, including more earnings reports.\n\nIt was encouraging to see the broader indices move higher without Technology in the leadership role. Conversely, I\u2019m very impressed with the action in the Industrial sector. A couple of my favorite names (United Rental- URI and JB Hunt-JBHT) posted financial results and opened lower only to reverse and power much higher, which is a clear sign of future confidence in the domestic economy.\n\nHealth care continues to rebound after a year of pressure from political saber rattling and the avalanche of legal troubles. Sans those questions and anxieties, this could still be the cheapest sector in the market. Of course, pressure to lower drug prices and the potential of the entire medical industry being blown to bits by a Warren presidency are dark clouds.\n\n(For the record, I think at this moment she would win the democrat nod but not the White House.)\n\nS&P 500 Index +0.28% Communication Services (XLC) +0.59% Consumer Discretionary (XLY) +0.26% Consumer Staples (XLP) +0.46% Energy (XLE) +0.07% Financials (XLF) +0.07% Health Care (XLV) +0.74% Industrials (XLI) +0.49% Materials (XLB) +0.26% Real Estate (XLRE) +0.66% Technology (XLK) -0.20% Utilities (XLU) +0.25%\n\nManufacturers See a Deal\n\nThe Philly Fed Manufacturing report came in slightly below consensus, but inside the data is a development that I think is bigger than the headline miss \u2013 it looks like manufacturing sees a deal on the China trade front.\n\nAll the major categories, including general activity, new orders and work week, are sharply lower this month, and conversely, sharply higher looking six months out.\n\nRight now manufacturers are lowering work weeks because they don\u2019t want to lose high skilled talent, as it would cost a lot more to train new workers in the future.\n\nPhilly Fed Manufacturing Report Current Future October September October September General Activity 5.6 12.0 33.8 20.8 New Orders 26.2 24.8 39.9 35.2 Shipments 18.9 26.4 42.9 41.3 Work Week 10.8 13.0 12.5 5.3\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be a chartist to see the sharp and very rare divergence in between how manufacturers feel now versus their optimism about the future. My interpretation is many are seeing a true trade deal being signed, sealed and delivered in the next six months.\n\nChina\u2019s Stumbling Economy\n\nChina\u2019s third quarter GDP number was released last night and landed with a thud. The official 6.0% (wink-wink) rate of growth is the lowest in almost 28 years.\n\nOfficials state that 90% of the downside pressure came from the trade war. Otherwise, the print would have been 6.5%. The news makes a deal more likely even if the public bluster suggests this news was no big deal.\n\nToday\u2019s Session\n\nMost of the big-name earnings releases have beaten the street, which makes it surprising the futures aren\u2019t higher. Some of that might have to do with anxiety over today\u2019s Fed speakers offering the last glimpse into a potential rate decision (after today the Fed goes into blackout).\n\nKO\n\nEarnings $0.56 vs $0.56 estimate\n\nRevenue $9.51b vs 9.42b estimate\n\nOrganic sales growth 5% vs 4.1% estimate\n\nNorth America +3%\n\nAsia +3%\n\nEMEA +4%\n\nReaffirmed FY19 guidance, organic revenues ~5%, EPS growth -1% to +1%.
