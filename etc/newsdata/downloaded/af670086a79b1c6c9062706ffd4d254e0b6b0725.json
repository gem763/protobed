It\u2019s really, really violent. People\u2019s heads get blown off.\u201d\n\nThe clip was a parody of a scene from Kingsman: The Secret Service. Trump\u2019s face was superimposed into the video, and it depicted him murdering his political enemies, including Griffin.\n\nAlways great to sit down and catch up with my friend @WendyWilliams to talk about @AHellOfAStory today. Hope you can watch! pic.twitter.com/NK8Nn5DSCP \u2014 Kathy Griffin (@kathygriffin) October 15, 2019\n\nGriffin made the rare television appearance to promote her new film, Kathy Griffin: A Hell of a Story. It focuses on the backlash she continues to receive over her infamous 2017 post of a photo of her holding up a bloodied Donald Trump mask.\n\n\u201cThe fact [is] this photo I took was not illegal, covered by the first amendment,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cYou can be offended by it, it\u2019s OK. It was a mask with ketchup.\u201d\n\nWilliams brought up the fake Trump massacre video and how it was affecting Griffin.\n\n\u201cKathy, how do people receive you in the streets?\u201d Williams asked.\n\n\u201cAll kinds of ways,\u201d Griffin responded. \u201cIt depends. Things have gotten better now. I will say this video is not going to help, so I have already been in contact with the FBI, again. People are a little bit of everything. I have been confronted on the streets many times.\u201d\n\nMany on Twitter were unsympathetic to the 58-year-old comedian\u2019s situation.\n\nEver notice that when a comedian crosses a line, they play the victim when consequences show up? There are consequences to everything.... pic.twitter.com/tdk9ubyvTN \u2014 AndysWonkyEye (@eye_andys) October 15, 2019\n\nKathy Griffin was just on Wendy Williams Show complaining how bad she was treated after she showed that \"Trump chopped head\" photo. Poor thing was even on the \"no fly list\". And her rich friends disowned her. awe\n\n\n\nDumb ass should have known what she was doing. \u2014 Proud Troll (@EvaEldridge6) October 15, 2019\n\nSome were happy Williams brought Griffin onto the show, while others pondered why there was such a double standard.\n\nThat was really great that @WendyWilliams put @kathygriffin on her show today, bc it sounds like all of Hollywood has been unfairly alienating Kathy for the past 2 years.\n\n\n\nStop the McCarthyism, Hollywood people, and HIRE KATHY GRIFFIN! #hirekathy #hirekathygriffin #dumptrump \u2014 Apple Plotnick Jannotta (@booksbyapple) October 15, 2019\n\nSomeone explain to me why @kathygriffin had her life destroyed, but the creators of the ultra-violent pro-Trump video that was shown at a Trump resort remain unknown, in the shadows and unscathed by their actions? \u2014 Bill Prady (@billprady) October 15, 2019\n\nGriffin said the U.S. Government opened a full investigation into the matter, putting her on the no-fly list and later officially exonerating her.\n\n\u201cThey were investigating me,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cThey were considering charging me with a crime of conspiracy to assassinate the President of the United States.\u201d\n\nThe comedian also touched on how the incident has had a profound impact on her relationship with family.\n\n\u201cNone of my family members talk to me,\u201d Kathy revealed. \u201cNot one Griffin has contacted me.\u201d\n\n'The View' hosts condemn Trump's response to fake massacre video: 'It starts at the top':\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:", "description": "Kathy Griffin appeared on 'The Wendy Williams Show' on Tuesday and talked about how the recent release of a fake Trump massacre video is affecting her.", "authors": ["Arjuna Ramgopal"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/qYirypSFIMhlbTU2CHDtBw--~B/aD0zOTY3O3c9NTg5NztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-08/2349ae10-cb0f-11e9-bfef-765ba2dca3be", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
