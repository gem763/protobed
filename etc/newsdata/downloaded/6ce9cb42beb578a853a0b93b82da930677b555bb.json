However, the five-time PGA Tour winner quickly gets his revenge, instead making the Australian repeat \u2018you\u2019re not going to need to know that\u2019 in his native language.\n\nDay mucks around with a putter in the classroom, using it to knock McIlroy's cap off his head\n\nThe players take it in turns to rib each other, with Matsuyama mocking Woods' famous 'glutes'\n\nThings escalate from there as Matsuyama explains how respect for the elders is important in Japanese culture - before promptly mocking veteran Woods and his famous \u2018glutes\u2019.\n\nAnd while discussing respect, Matsuyama takes aim at McIlroy and Day, showing clips of the Northern Irishman launching a club into a lake and the 2015 US PGA champion celebrating wildly after making a putt.\n\nWoods does manage to get a measure of revenge on his teacher, joking that \u2018the video paused\u2019 while watching a snippet of Matsuyama\u2019s trademark swing.\n\nBut Tiger saves his best gag until last, cleverly using his newfound linguistic skills to make McIlroy, who hasn\u2019t been paying much attention, to admit he\u2019s going to lose their four-way battle in Japan.\n\nAll four players will take part in The Challenge: Japan Skins in Tokyo later this month\n\nTiger Woods, Rory McIlroy, Jason Day and Hideki Matsuyama will go head-to-head in The Challenge: Japan Skins in a unique event to be streamed in full exclusively and free on GOLFTV* internationally.\n\n*Due to existing rights agreements in the UK and Ireland, fans will be required to subscribe to watch The Challenge.
