Nine of those victims died in the shooting.\n\nThe gunman was able to fire so many rounds so quickly because he used a 100-round magazine. That meant he didn\u2019t have to stop firing to reload. If police hadn\u2019t already been on the scene and able to return fire so quickly, many more almost certainly would have lost their lives.\n\nIn the aftermath, it\u2019s once again clear that civilians shouldn\u2019t be allowed to legally own high-capacity ammunition magazines whose only purpose is to inflict a lot of bloodshed quickly.\n\nThe primary effect of a high-capacity magazine \u2014 which is defined as a magazine holding more than 10 rounds \u2014 is more dead bodies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast week,the House Judiciary Committee advanced a bill that would ban such ammunition magazines \u2014 the Keep America Safe Act \u2014 along with bills to promote so-called red flag, or extreme risk, laws, which keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people, and a bill that prevents those convicted of hate crimes from purchasing or owning weapons.\n\nAll of this is common-sense legislation, but I particularly want to focus on the Keep America Safe Act; it matches a provision in my latest assault weapons ban, which I introduced in the Senate in January.\n\nThe new ban would update the very effective Assault Weapons Ban I wrote in 1994, which unfortunately expired in 2004. Until we are able to pass a new assault weapons ban, we should at least begin to dry up the supply of deadly firearm accessories available to the public, starting with high-capacity magazines.\n\nIt\u2019s no mystery why shooters frequently choose high-capacity magazines. Simply put, they result in more carnage. When a shooter has a single magazine that holds 30, 50, even 100 rounds of ammunition, it\u2019s easy to just keep firing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPreventing the use of high-capacity magazines is particularly important because many mass shootings are actually stopped when the shooter must pause to reload. The extra seconds for reloading can also provide victims with the chance to fight or flee.\n\nWe saw this happen when a gunman opened fire at a 2011 Tucson event for then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.). Bystanders were able to wrestle the shooter to the ground only after he had to pause and reload.\n\nBut it\u2019s not enough to simply stop the sale of new high-capacity magazines. We also need to address the supply already on the street. The Keep Americans Safe Act includes another provision of my assault weapons ban that would allow federal funds to be used to buy back high-capacity magazines, providing an incentive for people to retire such magazines.\n\nIt\u2019s true that eliminating high-capacity magazines won\u2019t stop all shootings, nor will the other gun safety laws passed by the House last week. No legislation can accomplish that absolutely. But these laws, and especially the magazine ban, can limit the death toll without impeding anyone\u2019s gun rights.\n\nThe full House is expected to pass the high-capacity magazine ban, the extreme-risk bill and the hate crimes bill later this month. And they\u2019ve already passed bills to require universal background checks and close the \u201cCharleston loophole,\u201d which allows a gun to be purchased even if a background check isn\u2019t completed.\n\nThose votes reflect the will of the people. Gun safety proposals are supported by a large majority of the public. In multiple polls this year \u2014 including an NPR/PBS/Marist poll released last week \u2014 two-thirds of all Americans support banning high-capacity magazines.\n\nSadly, Senate Republicans refuse to allow a vote on any of these common-sense bills. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said last week he won\u2019t act without direction from President Trump, and so far there has been nothing but silence from the White House.\n\nThe president and the Senate Republican leadership need to allow the high-capacity magazine ban to be debated and voted upon. The longer the Senate stalls, the more lives are put at risk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSen.
