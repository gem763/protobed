Silverwood has already pledged support to Dom Sibley, vowing to give him time to settle in as an opener alongside Rory Burns. It means Joe Denly is likely to move to three, giving Root more protection and time to gather his thoughts before going out to bat.\n\nRoot has moved up and down from no 3 over the past two years without finding a settled role in the side. Trevor Bayliss believed in having his best batsman at three where he could exert most influence over the game but it has just not suited Root.\n\nSilverwood has said his team will apply old fashioned basics in Test cricket and that means creating an established top five made up of specialist batsmen built around Root.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want a coach who will come in and smother white-ball cricket and Eoin. But we want someone who is going to give Joe more support, put more structure in place around him and really together form that DNA of what a Test team looks like, which I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve quite got to yet,\u201d said Ashley Giles, the England director.", "description": "Chris Silverwood\u2019s most pressing challenge as England head coach is to help Joe Root rediscover his form with his lack of runs a major reason why Australia were able to retain the Ashes last summer.", "authors": ["Nick Hoult", "Cricket News Correspondent", "Michael Vaughan", "Simon Heffer"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/cricket/2019/10/11/TELEMMGLPICT000209464746-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqaRL1kC4G7DT9ZsZm6Pe3PehAFAI_f6ud569StXyOKH0.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
