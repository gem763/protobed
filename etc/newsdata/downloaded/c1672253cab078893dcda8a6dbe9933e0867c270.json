Ms Swinson has not responded to requests for comment, or replied to the letter from Ms Butler. Mr Wilson declined to add to his previous statement.\n\nMs Butler said: \u2018If he felt he could do that to me it makes me worry about what he could do to others. I could have not raised it or ignored but actually it is too hurtful and I am worried about other people.\u2019\n\nThe Labour MP said Mr Wilson\u2019s response was \u2018depressing, upsetting and shocking\u2019 and has written to Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson (Picture: PA; Twitter)\n\nRecalling the \u2018depressing, upsetting and shocking\u2019 initial exchange in the lift, she added: \u2018I couldn\u2019t believe it, it took me a moment just to take on board what was happening to me. So when I relive the story, when I tell the racist incident, I don\u2019t mind if people want to say \u201cwhat happened\u201d, but to categorically say \u201cit is not true\u201d, because of their lived experience as a white male is just not on.\u2019\n\nAddressing the issue of discrimination more broadly at the Terrace bar, Ms Butler argued that racism in Britain \u2018was getting worse on one hand\u2019, and becoming more \u2018overt\u2019 \u2013 where previously it was covert.\n\nDawn Butler at the Terrace bar\n\nShe said the England football team should not have to put up with the kind of abuse they received in Bulgaria this week and that social media was playing both a positive and negative role in the battle against racism.\n\nLeader of Hong Kong pro-democracy protests attacked with hammers\n\nAdding that \u2018racism is suffered every single day by people of colour\u2019, she continued: \u2018Whether they are head of a bank (or) they work in a shop, they suffer race discrimination every single day and I am not going to sit back, as a Member of Parliament, and allow people to undermine our lived experience.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a reference to civil rights icon Martin Luther King, she said she wanted people to be judged \u2018by the content of their character\u2019, and that she talked about \u2018painful\u2019 incidents to bring about social change \u2013 not because she liked doing so or wanted sympathy.\n\nShe added: \u2018What we need in the struggle to fight racism is allies, so if you have never lived it be grateful that you have never lived it and instead of trying to criticise or be obnoxious just be a bloody good ally and just help make society a better place to live.\u2019\n\nBut, Ms Butler said she is \u2018filled with positivity\u2019 because there are \u2018overwhelmingly\u2019 more people that want to show solidarity in standing up to racism and \u2018believe that together we can fight for a better society.\u2019\n\nA Downing Street spokesperson said: \u2018The Prime Minister has apologised for any offence he has caused with his previous remarks.\n\n\u2018We are deeply concerned at any hatred which is directed against British Muslims and others because of their faith or heritage. This is utterly unacceptable and does not reflect the values our society or our country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We take a zero tolerance approach to discrimination of any kind, and consistently take decisive action to deal with any incidents of hatred, abuse or intimidation\u2019.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
