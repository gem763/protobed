REUTERS/Rafael Marchante\n\nSix years ago, Corona turned vegetarian after watching a documentary about the suffering of animals in the food industry and started looking for a political reflection of his beliefs, which he found in the then little-known PAN.\n\n\u201cThey defend animal rights: not just the rich ladies\u2019 kitties and pooches, but all the animals, and the environment, that\u2019s what attracted me,\u201d said Corona, a 40-year-old dog owner, who transcends PAN\u2019s typical big-city, student-age voter base.\n\nThe party\u2019s rise to a potentially decisive role in parliament is a sign of the times, in an age when the increasing fractiousness of politics in Western democracies is giving more power to movements once seen as having mainly niche appeal.\n\nCorona voted PAN in the last election in 2015, helping it enter parliament for the first time with a single seat in the 230-seat house.\n\nNow PAN has reached a turning point of its own, predicted to win four seats or more in an Oct. 6 parliamentary election. That could be just enough for Socialist Prime Minister Antonio Costa to make PAN his new ally if he fails to win a full majority.\n\nPAN leader Andre Silva, a vegetarian who scuba-dives and attends group movement sessions known as \u201cbiodance\u201d, told Reuters his party \u201cdoes not see itself in the obsolete left-right dichotomy\u201d.\n\nIt is open to backing the government in parliament if it commits to making \u201ca clear change in our productivist, oil-dependent, highly carbonised economy\u201d, he said.\n\nEnvironmentalist parties in Europe are hardly new: Germany\u2019s Greens joined a national coalition government as far back as 1998. But the last few years have seen a surge in interest across the continent as the mainstream post-war centre-left and centre-right have lost their dominance. In Portugal\u2019s case, the Green Party has long been allied with the Communists, leaving an opening for a less ideological approach.\n\nAside from seeking more humane treatment of animals, PAN has urged the government to declare a climate emergency.\n\n\u201cWith your help, we\u2019re still on time,\u201d heralds its campaign video released this week, calling to \u201celect people with the right mentality to embrace the emergency that is everyone\u2019s.\u201d\n\nOft-derided by critics as \u201cThe Animal Party\u201d that values critter rights higher than human ones, PAN argues that it seeks to promote a better world of harmony between humans and nature.\n\nTENSIONS RISE ON THE LEFT\n\nWith the budget almost balanced and the economy growing above the European average, premier Costa\u2019s minority Socialist government is expected to win additional parliament seats but still fall a few short of a full majority, polls show.\n\nOver the past four years, Costa has ruled with parliamentary backing from two far-left, eurosceptic parties - the Left Bloc and the Communists. But the relationship has been uncomfortable, with fights breaking out every year over the budget.\n\nIf, as some polls predict, the Socialists end up just one ally short of a majority, PAN could be a preferred partner. Unlike the far left, it is not opposed to European budgetary rules or Portugal\u2019s NATO commitments.\n\nA Socialist party source who did not want to be identified said that internal projections showed PAN could get as many as seven seats, including three in Lisbon and two in Porto.\n\nCosta has praised PAN\u2019s support for his government\u2019s budgets and expressed willingness \u201cto continue working with PAN\u201d.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\n\u201cIn the objectives, there is no division between us,\u201d Costa told PAN\u2019s Silva in a recent television debate.\n\nA government decision to postpone a planned auction of licenses to explore for lithium mining, at least until after the election, may have been a signal to PAN, which objects to such exploration in some parts of the country.\n\n\u201cIn the past year, we\u2019ve seen the more traditional parties talking about animals and the environment, copying PAN\u2019s agenda,\u201d said Corona, the party supporter. \u201cIt\u2019s just a hunt for votes. Had they been so worried they would have taken measures years ago.\u201d", "description": "They want lower taxes on pet food and oppose bull-fights: with these proposals, Portugal's People-Animals-Nature party could become\u00a0a kingmaker in a national election next week, its ratings swelled by voters like car factory worker Alexandre Corona.", "authors": ["Sergio Goncalves", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434505369&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q0QS", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
