Johnson: Stop \u2018Trying to Make Donald Trump Feel Better!\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "On this Sunday\u2019s broadcast of NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) had a heated interview with anchor Chuck Todd.\n\nAsking about a Friday report by The Wall Street Journal, Chuck Todd said, \u201cLet me start with something you told the \u201cWall Street Journal\u201d late last week, you said Gordon Sunland seemed to imply that the frozen military aid was a promise for investigations, you said, at that suggestion, \u2018I winced. my reaction was, oh, God, I don\u2019t want to see those two things combined.\u2019 Why did you wince? And what did you mean by those two things combined?\n\nJohnson said, \u201cWell, first of all, your set-up piece was typically very unbiased. Let me first before I start answering the detailed questions, let me talk about why I am pretty sympathetic with what President Trump has gone through. I am 64-years-old. I have never in my lifetime seeing a president after being elected after having some measure of well wishes from his opponents. I\u2019ve never seen an administration sabotaged from the day after the election. I\u2019ve never seen no measure of honeymoon whatsoever. So what President Trump had to endure a false allegation \u2014 by the way you have John Brennan on, you ought to ask director Brennan, what did Peter Strzok mean when he texted Lisa Page on December 15, 2016, quote\u2014.\u201d\n\nTodd interjected, \u201cSenator, what does this has to do with Ukraine.\u201d\n\nJohnson shot back, \u201cIt has everything to do with Ukraine.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cHe would like to know, I would like to know. I know his supporters would like to know, where did this all come from? You planted that false story? I have my third letter into the inspector general of the Intelligence Committee asking to just confirm, just confirm, are you investigating those leaks that Peter Strzok talked about with Lisa Page?\u201d\n\nTodd said, \u201cI have no idea why Fox News propaganda stuff is popping up on here.\u201d\n\nJohnson said, \u201cBecause that is exactly why President Trump is upset, and why his supporters are upset, with the news media!\u201d\n\nTodd replied, \u201cSenator Johnson, please! Can we please answer the question that I asked you, instead of trying to make Donald Trump feel better here that you\u2019re not criticizing him?! I\u2019m just trying to ask a simple question of what made you wince?\u201d\n\nJohnson said, \u201cBecause I didn\u2019t want those connected.\u201d\n\nAfter an extended back and forth, Todd ended the heated interview by saying, \u201cI\u2019m sorry that you choose to come on this way.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "description": "On this Sunday's broadcast of NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Sen.
