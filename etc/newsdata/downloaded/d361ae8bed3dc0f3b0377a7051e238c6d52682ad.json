In the bumpy last months of 2018, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin urged a government investigation of high-speed trading. After the recent August chop, some said the exit of traditional dealers from market-making had hurt stock-trading liquidity.\n\nAnd when someone blames high-frequency traders for causing market volatility, the data nerds at Citadel Securities fire up a study. Citadel\u2019s latest study examines whether stock-trading liquidity on exchanges has declined and aggravated the market\u2019s mood swings. The firm concludes it has not.\n\nThe stock market\u2019s structure has certainly changed with the rise of trading algorithms, electronic market-making and new investment products, acknowledges Gregg Berman, Citadel\u2019s market analytics chief. \u201cSo has the amount of liquidity changed?\u201d he wonders, rhetorically. His answer: \u201cLiquidity has basically remained constant.\u201d\n\nCitadel Securities is the market-making business started by hedge-fund manager Ken Griffin. Its ears have been burning ever since Michael Lewis cast it as a villain in Flash Boys. More-careful examinations disproved Lewis\u2019s claim that computerized market-making hurts investors, but his book\u2019s popularity left a sting.\n\nUsing data feeds and computing power unavailable to almost anyone else, Citadel looked at the order books of the 13 U.S. exchanges for all the stocks in the S&P 500 and the Russell 2000 indexes at 10-second increments since mid-2011.\n\nIn a liquid market, a trader can buy or sell their desired amount of stock without the order moving the price much. Most liquidity studies never look beyond the top of an exchange\u2019s order book, where it shows the number of shares available at the best bid or offer price\u2014the quote. Citadel\u2019s computer muscle allowed it to look deep in the order books, where additional liquidity is available at slightly wider spreads to fill bigger orders. That makes its study one of the first to look at the liquidity available to complete institutional trades worth millions of dollars.\n\nFor the stocks that comprise the two indexes, exchange liquidity has remained stable in the past eight years, says Citadel. The spreads at which traders could complete trades of $1 million and $10 million stayed constant, remaining unperturbed even in periods when the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, spiked. For giant orders of $100 million worth of stock, Citadel found that spreads would have varied with jumps in the VIX, but the range of liquidity was the same over the long term.\n\nThe study also looked at liquidity trends for six individual stocks, including giants like Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) and one of the S&P 500\u2019s smallest stocks, News Corp (NWS), the parent of Barron\u2019s. It confirms what has been reported here and elsewhere: Shrinking spreads in the age of computerized market-making make it cheaper to trade the small orders of retail investors and institutions.\n\nThe story is different for large orders. The spread to complete a $1 million order for the stock of Microsoft or Bank of America hasn\u2019t fallen at the same pace as the quoted spread for a small order. This could be a reason that some buy-side traders aren\u2019t fans of computerized market-making.\n\nBut on closer examination, the Citadel data show that the cost to execute million-dollar trades of those two stocks has declined over time\u2014just not as much as it has for the little guy. Even for orders worth $10 million, spreads have remained about the same. \u201cWhen you add it all together,\u201d says Berman, \u201cliquidity is equal or better than before.\u201d\n\nA funny thing happened to the stock of News Corp. The Citadel data show that in late 2016, News Corp spreads abruptly widened for trades of every size, raising trading costs for every investor, then narrowed again last year. What happened is that News Corp stock became part of the Tick Size Pilot Program, a misguided experiment in which Congress bullied the Securities and Exchange Commission into imposing wider spreads on the trading of 1,200 smaller stocks. Their hope was that liquidity would improve if the wide spreads attracted more dealers into market-making.\n\nInstead, the program made liquidity worse. By the time it ended, the artificial spreads had cost traders hundreds of millions of dollars. The expensive experiment decisively found one thing that makes liquidity worse\u2014letting politicians set the market\u2019s rules.\n\nWrite to Bill Alpert at william.alpert@barrons.com", "description": "Citadel Securities looked into whether stock-trading liquidity has declined and aggravated the market\u2019s mood swings.
