If they continue to fail to comply, they will be served with subpoenas in short order,\u201d an official working on the impeachment inquiry said.\n\nParnas told the Miami Herald last month that Ukraine\u2019s government has access to information on alleged wrongdoing by Joe Biden and his son Hunter and other U.S. officials overseas \u2014 but that the U.S. government proved indifferent to receiving it through official channels. Parnas said his and Fruman\u2019s friendship with Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani was their avenue to get the information into the Trump administration\u2019s hands.\n\n\u201cI got certain information and I thought it was my duty to hand it over,\u201d he told the Miami Herald on September 26.\n\nTrump\u2019s request to investigate Joe Biden, a political rival, during a July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky after withholding U.S. military aid to Ukraine is at the heart of the impeachment inquiry by House Democrats.\n\nThe House committees also subpoenaed Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Office of Management and Budget Russell Vought on Monday for documents related to the withholding of the Ukraianian military aid.\n\nThe decision of Fruman and Parnas to not comply with committee requests came as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo pushed back on impeachment efforts. Pompeo had signaled he would not allow diplomats to provide testimony, and on Monday a key witness was a no-show.\n\nGeorge Kent, the deputy assistant secretary of state for Europe and Eurasia, did not show up for a deposition scheduled on Monday before the three House committees conducting the impeachment inquiry, the Washington Post reported, citing unidentified sources.\n\nKent is a career diplomat who served as deputy chief of mission from 2015 to 2018 at the U.S. embassy in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital. Before that, Kent led anti-corruption efforts for the State Department in Europe.\n\nPompeo has complained Democrats were not giving the State Department time to prepare, and last week suggested Democrats were harassing professional diplomats.\n\nHowever, in his now-infamous July call, President Trump spoke poorly of U.S. allies and called his own U.S. ambassador, Marie Yovanovitch, \u201cbad news\u201d and warned \u201cshe\u2019s going to go through some things.\u201d\n\nThe committees have scheduled Yovanovitch to sit for a deposition Friday, although it is unclear whether Pompeo will allow it.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not complying with the inquiry so far. There are discussions that are ongoing and we hope that he will comply,\u201d House Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Eliot Engel said Sunday on Face the Nation.\n\nParnas and Fruman are South Florida businessmen who were well under the radar until the Ukraine flap. Reports by McClatchy and the Miami Herald showed that Fruman is an exporter of luxury goods and Parnas left a long trail of debts in Florida and beyond.\n\nThe two Soviet-born Ukrainians, now American citizens, acted as couriers for Giuliani, a prominent Trump surrogate and former New York Mayor, who had acknowledged he was seeking dirt in Ukraine on Biden and his son Hunter. Giuliani alleged, without proof, that Biden got his son a lucrative seat on the board of a Ukrainian energy firm called Burisma Holdings.\n\nOver the weekend, a third person from South Florida became part of the widening Ukraine scandal. The Associated Press reported from Kiev that oil magnate Harry Sargeant III, who resides in Boca Raton and is a big GOP donor, does business with Fruman and Parnas.\n\nSargeant joined the two in working on a plan to push out the CEO of a Ukrainian energy firm Naftogaz and replace him with another senior executive expected to be friendly to their desire to win contracts.\n\nSargeant boasted, the AP story said, that he regularly meets with Trump at Mar-a-Lago and had his support.\n\nDowd, the lawyer for Parnas and Fruman, disputed that the effort was a shakedown and told the AP the effort was \u201can attempt to do a legitimate business deal that didn\u2019t work out.\u201d", "description": "Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman will not comply with a request for documents and depositions from the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump after the peddled information from Ukraine involving Joe Biden.", "authors": ["Bernard Condon", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/5618154292001/e244b44b-7ff6-4df9-b786-b94dfb8a501c/dd70804c-26b6-4b39-9687-1be673e02d38/1280x720/match/image.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
