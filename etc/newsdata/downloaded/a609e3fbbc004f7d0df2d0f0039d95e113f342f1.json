The Moon", "language": "en", "text": "TOKYO\u2014The Japanese billionaire who wants to fly around the moon on Elon Musk \u2019s spaceship is cashing out of his online fashion business back on earth by selling control to Yahoo Japan Corp.\n\nYahoo Japan plans to take a 50.1% stake in Yusaku Maezawa \u2019s Zozo Inc., which operates a popular fashion site in Japan, paying about $3.7 billion, the companies said Thursday.\n\nMr. Maezawa, who will step down as the site\u2019s chief executive, is one of Japan\u2019s most prominent tech entrepreneurs, known for his attention-grabbing exploits. He paid $110.5 million for a Jean-Michel Basquiat painting of a black skull in 2017 and last year appeared with Tesla Inc. \u2019s Mr. Musk to announce that he had bought the first ticket to fly around the moon on a SpaceX vehicle.\n\nMr. Maezawa has been trying to revitalize Zozo, which reported a decline in annual profit for the year that ended in March. It was the first such drop since the company\u2019s shares went public in 2007. The cost of developing and delivering the body-measuring Zozosuit, which Mr. Maezawa had thought would become a catalyst for growth, weighed on its profits.\n\n\u201cI will move on to a new road,\u201d Mr. Maezawa said on Twitter after the announcement.\n\nYahoo Japan, which operates a widely used shopping site in Japan, said it would buy Zozo stock at \u00a52,620 ($24.30) a share. It said Mr. Maezawa, who currently owns a 36.8% stake in the company, would sell most of those shares\u2014a 30.4% stake\u2014to Yahoo Japan.\n\nZozo shares rose 15% in early Tokyo trading to \u00a52,495, just below Yahoo Japan\u2019s offer price. Yahoo Japan said it would begin a tender offer in early October, but added that Zozo would keep its separate listing, so not all shareholders who wish to sell can necessarily do so.\n\nYahoo Japan is independent of the Yahoo website in the U.S. The U.S. Yahoo site is owned by Verizon Communications Inc. \u2019s media unit, while Yahoo Japan is listed in Tokyo. Its shares were up slightly on Thursday. SoftBank Group Corp. and its Japanese telecommunications unit together owned 47.5% of Yahoo Japan shares as of March 31.\n\nMr. Maezawa founded Zozo in 1998 as a seller of imported CDs and records. The company made it to the top of Japan\u2019s e-commerce fashion world by offering leading brands on its Zozotown site that previously were available only in elite department stores.\n\nBut the chief executive has acknowledged that his attempts to develop the Zozosuit\u2014with sensors and an app to take body measurements\u2014and a Zozo house brand of clothing haven\u2019t taken off.\n\n\u201cI wanted to provide clothes that perfectly fit any body shape, but honestly it didn\u2019t work out very well,\u201d Mr. Maezawa said in a recent interview with The Wall Street Journal.\n\nCustomers complained that using the suit didn\u2019t result in a particularly good fit and some called it a publicity stunt. As investors grew skeptical about Mr. Maezawa\u2019s vision for Zozosuit, the company\u2019s stock price fell in half.\n\nAmid the struggles, Mr. Maezawa, a frequent Twitter user whose posts often influenced the stock price, said he would take a break to focus on restoring his business. Zozo\u2019s profits rose 28% in the April-June quarter.\n\nHe has been working on a new project to offer customers better-fitting shoes. The company is preparing to distribute the Zozomat, which combines a smartphone app with a special paper mat that has markers to enable users to take 3-D scans of their feet.\n\nHis departure may have come as a surprise to investors, but he was known for making swift decisions.\n\nReferring to a Japanese proverb that says sitting three years on a cold stone will make it warm, Mr. Maezawa told the Journal, \u201cI sit on that stone for three days. I can\u2019t wait for three years.\u201d\n\nWrite to Megumi Fujikawa at megumi.fujikawa@wsj.com", "description": "The Japanese billionaire who wants to fly around the moon on Elon Musk\u2019s spaceship is exiting his online fashion business back on earth by selling control to Yahoo Japan.", "authors": ["Megumi Fujikawa", "Megumi.Fujikawa Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106450/social", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
