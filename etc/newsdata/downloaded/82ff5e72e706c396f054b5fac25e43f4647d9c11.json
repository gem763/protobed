This isn't an accident, these bugs are deeply evolved with humans.\n\n\"That's what we want to understand and preserve - that form of kinship between mother and child.\"\n\nWhat should pregnant women do?\n\nDr Alison Wright, the vice president of The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said the findings were groundbreaking, but should not deter women from having a Caesarean.\n\nShe said: \"In many cases, a Caesarean is a life-saving procedure, and can be the right choice for a woman and her baby.\n\n\"The exact role of the microbiome in the newborn and what factors can change it are still uncertain, so we don't think this study should deter women from having a Caesarean.\"\n\nFollow James on Twitter.", "description": "New findings may help explain why some Caesarean babies are more at risk of certain diseases.", "authors": ["James Gallagher", "Health", "Science Correspondent", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4CE5/production/_108858691_howyou'reborn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
