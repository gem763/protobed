On Monday, the State Department shared the speech at the top of its website, ahead of more pressing department issues, like U.S. involvement in Turkey\u2019s invasion of Syria. The speech and the State Department\u2019s promotion of the video breached the divide between church and state, leaders from secular and atheist communities say.\n\n\u201cSecretary Pompeo\u2019s speech was pure proselytization,\u201d Sarah Levin, director of governmental affairs at the Secular Coalition for America told The Daily Beast.\n\nDuring the speech, which he gave in his capacity as Secretary of State, Pompeo stated that \u201cI know some people in the media will break out the pitchforks when they hear that I ask God for direction in my work.\u201d\n\nHis personal faith isn\u2019t the problem, Levin said. It\u2019s when it dictates his actions as Secretary of State, or when those beliefs top the State Department website.\n\n\u201cTo be clear, we don\u2019t judge Secretary Pompeo for being a Christian or for connecting what he\u2019s achieved to his faith, but it\u2019s unacceptable and a violation of separation of church and state for him to take those beliefs and apply them to policy that affects the American public,\u201d Levin said, \u201cand it\u2019s just as wrong from him to elevation Christianity above other faiths as it is to elevate Christianity above non-faiths.\u201d\n\nRachel Laser, president and CEO of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, echoed Levin.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s perfectly fine for Secretary Pompeo to be a leader who is Christian,\u201d Laser said in a statement. \u201cBut he cannot use his government position to impose his faith on the rest of us\u2014that is a fundamental violation of the separation of religion and government. Secretary Pompeo\u2019s speech on how being a Christian leader informs his decision-making and the posting of the speech on the State Department website send the clear message that U.S. public policy will be guided by his personal religious beliefs.\u201d\n\nPompeo has previously indicated that his religious beliefs factored into his policy decisions as a government official. In a March interview with Christian Broadcasting Network, Pompeo was asked whether President Donald Trump had been raised by God \u201cto help save the Jewish people from the Iranian menace.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a Christian, I certainly believe that's possible,\u201d Pompeo answered.\n\nThe secular website Patheos has tracked Pompeo\u2019s comments for years, including a 2015 speech in which he opposed same-sex marriage and stated that \u201cwe will continue to fight these battles, it is a never ending struggle\u2026 until the rapture.\u201d\n\nIn a 2014 speech at a Kansas church, Pompeo cast Islam as the greatest \u201cthreat to America\u201d and urged that \u201cwe make sure that we pray and stand and fight and make sure that we know that Jesus Christ our savior is truly the only solution for our world.\u201d\n\nNick Fish, president of American Atheists said Pomeo\u2019s Friday speech wasn\u2019t surprising, given his record.\n\n\u201cAs disappointing as it is to see the State Department parroting Christian nationalist talking points, it isn't a surprise. But this goes above and beyond the obvious problem of Secretary Pompeo promoting one religious worldview on taxpayers' dime,\u201d Fish told The Daily Beast. \u201cThe bigger issue is that the State Department is being led by a man who genuinely believes that politics is \u2018a never-ending struggle... until the rapture.\u2019\u201d\n\nLevin said the Trump administration has consistently pushed at the boundary between church and state. \u201cThis administration has pursued an agenda of Christian nationalism,\u201d she said.\n\nShe pointed to two other questionable incidents this weekend. On Friday, Attorney General Bill Barr gave a speech blaming \u201cthe growing ascendancy of secularism\u201d for depression, mental illness, violence, and the opioid epidemic.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump gave a speech to religious leaders proclaiming that \u201cforever and always, Americans will believe in the cause of freedom, the power of prayer, and the eternal glory of God.\u201d\n\nLevin called the trio of speeches a \u201ctriple threat.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not unusual rhetoric we\u2019ve seen from officials,\u201d she said, \u201cbut it is unusual to see Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, clear-cut abuse, these officials violating the separation of church and state.\u201d\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGot a tip?
