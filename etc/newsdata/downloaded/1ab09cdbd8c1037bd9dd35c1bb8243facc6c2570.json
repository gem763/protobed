According to the 68-year-old she has had to convince producers she can do \u201cold and gnarly\u201d in order to get a diverse range of parts in Hollywood.\n\nJANE SEYMOUR, 68, EXPLAINS HOW SHE STAYS IN SHAPE: \u2018I\u2019M NOT TRYING TO BE YOUNGER THAN WHO I AM\u2019\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take all my makeup off and they\u2019ll see I can do \u2018old\u2019 quite well,\u201d said the British star, as reported by UK\u2019s Daily Mail on Monday.\n\n\u201cMy intention is to age as gracefully as I can,\u201d Seymour continued. \u201cInside, I\u2019m 20 years old. I was way too serious when I was that age. I\u2019ve found my 20-year-old alter ego. It just happens to be in this body. But that\u2019s OK. I\u2019m having fun and I love it.\u201d\n\nSeymour credited her youthful appearance to Pilates, light weightlifting and a healthy diet that involves zero sugar and fried foods, shared the outlet. Seymour said her cheat day or \u201cnaughty night\u201d consists of \u201ca handful of pistachios, two pieces of very dark chocolate and a glass of wine.\u201d\n\nIn February of this year, Seymour told Closer Weekly that when it comes to aging in the spotlight, she relies on a no-nonsense workout regimen to make her look and feel good.\n\nJANE SEYMOUR POSES FOR PLAYBOY, RECALLS HOW SHE ALMOST QUIT ACTING AFTER BEING SEXUALLY HARASSED\n\n\u201cWhen I have time to do it\u2026 I do Pilates and Gyrotonics and I also do a special workout they call \u2018The Perfect Workout\u2019\u2026 which is very, very slow weightlifting,\u201d Seymour told the magazine. \u201c[It\u2019s] very, very slow. You only do 20 minutes twice a week. I notice a huge difference when I do it. Each exercise you do, you do it to fatigue so your whole body starts shaking.\u201d\n\nSeymour said that while her busy film career makes working out regularly challenging at times, she\u2019s determined to stay healthy and even breaks a sweat from the comfort of home.\n\n\u201cI do it as often as I can,\u201d she explained to the magazine. \u201cI have a machine at home\u2026 I\u2019m filming at the moment, but when I\u2019m not filming and I have time, I do it at least twice a week.\u201d\n\nSeymour also shared that when it comes to her diet, she keeps things simple.\n\nJANE SEYMOUR REUNITES WITH \u2018DR. QUINN\u2019 LOVE INTEREST JOE LANDO: \u2018SUMMERS WITH SULLY\u2019\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t eat too much starch, I try not to,\u201d she said. \u201cMostly I eat\u2026 chicken, a lot of vegetables. We grow a lot of vegetables in the garden, organically. Everything in moderation, which, of course, is the hardest thing. Me telling myself I\u2019m on a diet never works. Me saying, \u2018OK, I\u2019m going to have a bite of this cake but I don\u2019t need the whole cake.' That\u2019s how it works.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do my best, but I\u2019m not trying to be younger than who I am,\u201d added the \u201cDr. Quinn, Medicine Woman\u201d star. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to be the best I can be at the age I\u2019m at.\u201d\n\nBack in 2018, Seymour flaunted her physique by posing for a Playboy pictorial for the third time after being photographed for the July 1973 and January 1987 issues. At the time, the star insisted it had never felt so good to unveil her vulnerable side for the men\u2019s lifestyle magazine.\n\n\u201cI feel much sexier now than I ever did when I was young,\u201d Seymour told Playboy. \u201cThen, I was like, \u2018Oh gosh, I\u2019m supposed to be sexy. What is that?! There\u2019s an enormous freedom in having lived as long as I have. Like my father used to say, \u2018I\u2019m comfortable in my own skin.\u2019\u201d", "description": "It\u2019s not easy being beautiful \u2014 just ask Jane Seymour.", "authors": ["Stephanie Nolasco"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/2016/01/29/640/360/JaneSeymour50.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
