The initial phase would also chapters on structural agricultural issues and currencies.\n\nMr Mnuchin said Treasury had not determined how to address its designation of Beijing as a currency manipulator in its uncompleted October currency report, which was due on Tuesday. He said the two sides had agreed on currency provisions last week, which will be reviewed \"as we put out the report\".\n\nThe Treasury chief also said some conversations with People's Bank of China Governor Yi Gang had eased some Treasury concerns.\n\n\"I'm not prepared to go into the details of them other than to say that there were certain issues that he did get us more comfortable on, and more information,\" Mr Mnuchin added.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [WASHINGTON] US and Chinese trade negotiators are working on nailing down a Phase 1 trade deal text for their presidents to sign next month, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Wednesday, adding he was prepared to travel to Beijing for more meetings if necessary. .
