(AP) - The CEO of a Utah-based tech company has been reported missing during a business trip to the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nFamily members say Erin Valenti, head of Tinker Ventures, was last seen in Palo Alto on Monday.\n\nHer husband, Harrison Weinstein, wrote on Facebook that phone activity suggests Valenti may have been driving in San Jose. He says she never returned her rental car or made it on her flight back to Utah.\n\nKRON-TV reported Friday that San Jose police are calling it a voluntary missing person case, meaning they think she left on purpose.\n\nValenti\u2019s family disagrees and says the CEO seemed to be distraught on the night she disappeared.\n\nValenti is described as 5-foot-4 with blond hair. She was last seen wearing a white T-shirt and jeans.\n\nTinker Ventures is an app developer based in Salt Lake City.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The CEO of a Utah-based tech company has been reported missing during a business trip to the San Francisco Bay Area.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
