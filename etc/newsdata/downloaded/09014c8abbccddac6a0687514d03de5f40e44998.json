If you make a purchase by clicking one of our links, we may earn a small share of the revenue. However, our picks and opinions are independent from USA Today\u2019s newsroom and any business incentives.\n\nFor too long, \u201ckitchen gifts\u201d have referred to kitschy, single-use products (think novelty aprons, egg cookers) that are more likely to get stuck inside some drawer than proudly displayed and used day after day. Even the most well-intentioned gift givers tend to draw a blank when it comes to the kitchen and succumb to the lure of plastic gadgets and funny mugs.\n\nLuckily, it doesn\u2019t have to be that way. To help you gift smarter and better, we\u2019ve rounded up the best kitchen gifts of the year that people actually want and love. Whether you\u2019re shopping for an experienced chef or someone who uses their oven to store clothes, we\u2019ve got you covered. These are the best kitchen gifts of 2019, according to Reviewed:\n\n1.

The Philips Airfryer XXL easily claimed the top spot, churning out massive batches of crisp french fries, crackling fried chicken, and perfectly cooked burgers with ease.\n\nIf your giftee can't decide between an air fryer and an Instant Pot, the other trendiest gadget on shelves this year, we recommend checking out the Ninja Foodi Pressure Cooker that can sear, bake, pressure cook, air fry, and more.\n\nGet the Philips Airfryer XXL on Amazon for $299.95\n\n2. For the one who doesn't want an air fryer: Breville Smart Oven Pro\n\nBest kitchen gifts 2019: Breville Smart Oven Plus (Photo: Breville)\n\nWhile the idea of an air fryer might sound nice, not everyone can afford that extra countertop space\u2014and having a massive black plastic appliance out at all times isn't the most design-friendly. For those cooks who prefer sleek minimalism, the Breville Smart Oven Pro is the appliance of their dreams. It scored top marks in our toaster oven roundup, but it's so much more than a toaster oven. It can bake, broil, and roast as well as a full-size oven, and its convection bake setting yields crispy results like an air fryer.\n\nIf you didn't know that an air fryer is just a small convection oven, now you know\u2014now share that with your loved ones and get gifting.\n\nGet the Breville Smart Oven Pro on Amazon for $269.99\n\n3.
