People probably saw her speech when she got the BAFTA and heard her Scouse accent and didn't know what to think. She totally deserves it.'", "description": "The\u00a0heptathlete,\u00a026, shared a sun-drenched snap of herself to Instagram on Monday posing on an idyllic sea swing.", "authors": ["Olivia Wheeler", "Alexander Robertson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/12/19440338-0-image-a-44_1570534654586.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
