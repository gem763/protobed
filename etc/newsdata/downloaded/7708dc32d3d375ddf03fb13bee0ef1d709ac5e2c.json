When I was a child sitting in Sunday school in west Texas, I often wondered why God would engineer these temptations into our environment in the first place \u2013 much less lead us into them \u2013 if he was only going to enjoin us to avoid them later.\n\nToday I feel the same way about the creators of our technological environments. We are bombarded at every turn with persuasive design that exploits our psychological weaknesses and often leads us into temptation, habituation and distraction. At the same time, we are expected to take up arms against these distractions, to muster superhuman levels of self-regulation, just to adapt to this all-out war others are waging for our attention.\n\nSo far, the closest thing to a bible for designers who have been enlisted in that war for our attention \u2013 those tasked with hacking human psychology to increase \u201cengagement\u201d with their products \u2013 has been Nir Eyal\u2019s bestselling 2014 book Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products. Eyal advanced a four-part model for exploiting triggers, rewards and other elements of habit formation to systematically manipulate user behaviour; he described the model as \u201ca new superpower\u201d for designers.\n\nNow, five years later, as individuals and societies have begun to discern the extent to which distraction is a feature, not a bug, of the industrialisation of persuasive design, Eyal has returned with a self-help book. Here, as in Hooked, Eyal advances a four-part model \u2013 and even describes it as a \u201csuperpower\u201d again \u2013 only this time it\u2019s for users: it sets out how to be \u201cindistractable\u201d in a world that\u2019s angling for our attention.\n\nIt would be too uncharitable to dismiss Indistractable as merely an attempt to backtrack. It would also be a mistake to place it among the crop of repentant-tech-insider confessionals so fashionable lately \u2013 those tragic narratives of grovelling and apology that the media gleefully stenograph for readers who instinctively click on them. In fact, a notable absence in Indistractable is any trace of regret or re-examination whatsoever, and for this Eyal deserves some credit.\n\nThis is a book with two souls. One is concerned with prescription, the other with persuasion. The prescriptive part offers techniques for resisting distraction. These include: scheduling your life so assiduously that you \u201celiminate all white space in your calendar\u201d, beginning with \u201cprioritising and timeboxing \u2018You\u2019 time\u201d; \u201chacking back\u201d or changing the external triggers that distract you (for instance, disabling device notifications, or having a signal at work that tells your colleagues you\u2019re in a focus mode); and using \u201cprecommitment devices\u201d such as pacts to motivate you to follow through on your goals (which in Eyal\u2019s case consisted of agreeing to pay his friend $10,000 if he didn\u2019t finish Indistractable on time). There is some value in compiling these techniques in one place; readers might find some of them useful.\n\nHowever, it is the persuasive soul of Indistractable that merits greater attention. At the book\u2019s beating heart is a sales pitch for the blamelessness of technology vis-\u00e0-vis distraction. This argument is important in part because it carries significance for wider conversations about the ethics of persuasive design, and in part because it is so profoundly, yet so subtly, wrong.\n\nEyal\u2019s argument is roughly as follows. Distraction is any action we take that\u2019s misaligned with \u201cour broader intentions\u201d. We often blame technology for distraction. However, because all human behaviour is motivated by the desire to minimise discomfort, the \u201croot cause\u201d of distraction therefore lies within us. Technology, by contrast, is merely a \u201cproximate cause\u201d. If we don\u2019t deal with the root causes, we\u2019ll continue to find ways to distract ourselves and will remain \u201chelpless victims in a tragedy of our own creation\u201d. On the other hand, if we do acknowledge that distraction originates inside ourselves, we can take steps to become indistractable and ultimately live the lives we want.\n\nThere are many curious contortions here. Eyal\u2019s conception of distraction remains mercurial. His foundational claim that avoiding discomfort or dissatisfaction is our motivation for everything we do in life is simply asserted; no evidence is adduced. (It\u2019s a claim that, in any event, seems unfalsifiable \u2013 can\u2019t any desire for change be framed as \u201cdissatisfaction\u201d with some status quo?) Yet the essential rhetorical move, for which Eyal gives no justification, is his separation of inner motivations from external factors and his conception of them as root causes. This root/proximate cause distinction comes from a diagnostic process in engineering and management sciences called root cause analysis. Why is this method appropriate for diagnosing human behaviour? No reason is given. Why can\u2019t a behaviour be the result of multiple root causes? The question goes unasked. Can\u2019t technologies, like many other external influences, increase our degree of inner discomfort and dissatisfaction? The issue is not even raised. What even counts as a \u201croot cause\u201d? Eyal leaves it undefined.\n\nIn fact, throughout the book he is inconsistent about what he treats as a root cause versus a proximate cause. At various points he is happy to construe all manner of environmental factors \u2013 relational, organisational, psychological, and cultural \u2013 as root causes of distraction, while treating as a ridiculous moral panic any suggestion that technologies that have literally been designed to distract \u2013 many by designers he has influenced \u2013 are themselves part of any structural problem. He seems to allow for any root cause of distraction, as long as it is not technology.\n\nThis is a fundamentally unserious way of approaching the question. Imagine we\u2019ve just discovered that a facial recognition algorithm is amplifying some racial inequality. In response, we might ask: how could the algorithm be designed so that it promotes equality instead? Can it in principle be designed to do so? Should an algorithm even be used in this situation? And so on. However, it would not occur to us to say \u2013 unless we were mired in anxious defensiveness about the fact that criticism is occurring at all \u2013 that even though the algorithm amplifies inequality, it poses no problem worthy of immediate corrective action because it is not the \u201croot cause\u201d of that inequality. To say so would be a digital version of the odious \u201cGuns don\u2019t kill people, people kill people\u201d deflection. (Of course, neither side of that false dichotomy is correct; it is clearly the gun-person interface which is at issue.) Technology doesn\u2019t distract people; people distract people. This, in a phrase, is Indistractable\u2019s persuasive soul.\n\nI recently read that the pope wanted to alter a line of the Lord\u2019s Prayer, from \u201clead us not into temptation\u201d to \u201cdo not let us fall into temptation\u201d. Indistractable is Eyal\u2019s attempt at a pope-like pivot. Thankfully, he can\u2019t pivot by fiat. However, as the book Merchants of Doubt by Erik M Conway and Naomi Oreskes brilliantly chronicled in the domains of climate science and tobacco research, a smokescreen of doubt can be thrown up, which provides a cover for interests averse to systemic change, whether regulatory or otherwise. And Eyal can make people who get distracted by adversarial design less inclined to demand more from their technologies, and more inclined to demand \u201csuperpowers\u201d of themselves that their all-too-human limitations render them unable to meet.\n\nTechnology exists to help us transcend our limitations. This book could have been a welcome recognition by a leading voice in the field that we can\u2019t fight distractions on our own \u2013 that we shouldn\u2019t have to \u2013 and that technology, properly designed and incentivised, is necessary for helping us do so. That is the book I wish I could have read.\n\nIn Hooked, Eyal wrote: \u201cIt will be years, perhaps generations, before society develops the mental antibodies to control new habits.\u201d However, in Indistractable he writes: \u201cWe have the unique ability to adapt to such threats. We can take steps right now to retrain and regain our brains. To be blunt, what other choice do we have? We don\u2019t have time to wait for regulators to do something and if you hold your breath waiting for corporations to make their products less distracting, well, you\u2019re going to pass out.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to tell this to knowledge workers who ride electric scooters to work and stream productivity podcasts into their AirBuds. But tell it to the single working mother who can barely carve out enough \u201cme time\u201d to take a shower. Better yet, tell the tech designers it\u2019s not their fault, that it\u2019s ultimately their users\u2019 responsibility to manage distractions, and that even if their products do distract, the \u201croot cause\u201d of it lies in users themselves.\n\nTo throw everything back on the individual and to ignore the structural causes of distraction is not only unscientific in its approach to human nature, it is unjust in its implications for society, and unimaginative in its capitulation to design. Such a position would be understandable, though still not acceptable, from someone who didn\u2019t know better. But to spend years building up those structural causes of distraction, and then to take such a position? That would be a spectacle of sophistry from which no amount of self-help pabulum could distract.\n\n\u2022 James Williams\u2019s Stand Out of Our Light: Freedom and Restriction in the Attention Economy is published by Cambridge.
