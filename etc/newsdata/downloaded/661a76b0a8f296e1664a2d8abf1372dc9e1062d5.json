Unfortunately for anyone with lingering 2016 PTSD, many of the breakout moments of her comeback tour have revolved around her former opponent.\n\nIt began on October 9, when Clinton responded to a presidential tweet goading her to \u201center the race to try and steal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren\u201d on the condition that she \u201cmust explain all of her high crimes and misdemeanors including how & why she deleted 33,000 Emails AFTER getting \u201cC\u201d Subpoena!\u201d She returned, simply, with:\n\nDon\u2019t tempt me. Do your job. \u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 8, 2019\n\nIt was the strongest Trump-related missive of the tour: A short, direct response to a sprawling attack that contrasted her professionalism with the president\u2019s usual behavior. If only that tone was maintained. In an interview with Jane Pauley of CBS News, Clinton called Trump a \u201ccorrupt human tornado,\u201d which New York\u2019s Sarah Jones called a \u201chamfisted attempt to clown on the president.\u201d (More substantively, Clinton also dismissed Joe Biden\u2019s history of unwanted touching, telling people to \u201cget over it.\u201d) And on Sunday, Clinton debuted the newest phase in her singular career \u2014 posting bad memes to troll the president. Responding to Trump\u2019s objectively stupid letter to Turkish President Erdogan, Clinton posted a rendering made by Jimmy Kimmel Live! of what Trump\u2019s language might look in historical context.\n\nFound in the archives... pic.twitter.com/iFFeqloYHM \u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 20, 2019\n\nIt was an unnecessary miss, unlike, say, Elizabeth Warren\u2019s tweet responding to Jacob Wohl\u2019s latest absurdity. Though the president engages in constant use of profanity and horrid use of sexual imagery, Clinton, to her credit as a candidate, didn\u2019t stoop to his verbal level \u2014 nor did any Democrats want her to. But thanks to this cursed tweet, there\u2019s a direct visual connection between the 2016 popular vote winner and the phrase \u201cbusting my nuts.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, this doesn\u2019t look like it will be a one-off message from the 2016 candidate class: Posting awful historical-fiction boomer memes is just the behavior we have to look forward to from Trump whenever he exits the office, and probably as a best-case scenario.\n\nSign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter Daily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.
