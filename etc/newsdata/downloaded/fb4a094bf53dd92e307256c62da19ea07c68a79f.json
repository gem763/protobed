(Todd McInturf/Detroit News/AP)\n\nShe woke up on her back in a dark, abandoned house, pinned down by a man with his hands pressed into her neck. She couldn\u2019t breathe as he ripped off her shirt.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m about to die,\u201d the 51-year-old woman recalled thinking in recent court testimony.\n\nMinutes earlier, she had been walking down a Detroit street in the early hours of June 3. The man had jumped her from behind, putting her in a choke hold until she blacked out. Now, she thought, he could only have one plan in mind: \u201cKill me and rape me,\u201d she said in court.\n\nBut then she remembered the blade \u2014 a red box cutter that she carried in her pocket for protection. She pulled it out, flicked it open and started stabbing.\n\n\u201cI just stuck him,\u201d testified the woman. \u201cAnd then I went back again, and stuck him again.\u201d\n\nHis blood spurted onto her clothes as she leaped up and then jumped out a window, fleeing down the empty street for help at a gas station.\n\nThe woman, police now say, was one of the lucky ones. The man later charged in her assault is a serial killer who terrorized Detroit for months, police allege \u2014 and the blood the man left on her pants is now a key piece of evidence against him.\n\nOn Thursday, police submitted four homicide warrants against the suspect, WDIV reported. Authorities say Deangelo Martin, a 34-year-old homeless man, targeted sex workers, mostly in their 50s, and killed them inside derelict houses. As prosecutors decide whether to charge Martin in those deaths, police say they\u2019re investigating him in connection with other potential killings.\n\nThe case has shined a light both on Detroit\u2019s vulnerable population of sex workers and the endemic problem of abandoned homes in the Michigan metropolis, leading the mayor to promise to board up thousands of blighted properties that police combed through to look for more victims.\n\nThe police found the first body on March 19, inside a vacant house. Later identified as Nancy Harrison, 52, she died of blunt force trauma to the head, WDIV reported. On May 24, authorities found Trevesene Ellis, 53, also dead of blunt force trauma to the head in an abandoned house. On June 5, Tamara M. Jones, 56, was found in another neglected property; her cause of death is unclear. According to the Detroit News, all the women were \u201carranged in kneeling positions,\u201d with used condoms nearby.\n\nPolice sounded the alarm after discovering Jones\u2019s body. \u201cIt appears we may have a serial killer,\u201d Detroit Police Chief James Craig warned at a news conference last month, citing the similarities in the victims and the ramshackle dwellings where their remains were left behind.\n\nPolice began a massive operation, eventually combing through more than 3,300 abandoned homes to search for other victims and evidence. Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan (D) pledged to quickly board up the remaining vacant houses in a city where about 19,000 similar properties have already been demolished in the last five years, CBS News reported.\n\n\u201cWe have to remove the blight from this community,\u201d Duggan said. \u201cIt has been a plague on this city for far too long.\u201d\n\nFor police, the case was further complicated because the killer appeared to be targeting sex workers.\n\n\u201cSex workers, in many cases they\u2019re invisible,\u201d Craig told reporters. \u201cSome are illegal narcotic users, they\u2019re disconnected from families, so if they go missing, generally there will be no report of a missing person. So that\u2019s what makes cases like this very challenging.\u201d\n\nOn June 7, police arrested Martin at a bus stop. They haven\u2019t said what evidence first led them to the itinerant man.\n\nBut authorities soon revealed that at least two victims had escaped brutal attacks allegedly at the hands of Martin. The first, a 26-year-old woman, said Martin invited her to his mother\u2019s house to take a shower and sleep, and then sexually assaulted her and stabbed her in the neck. (The Washington Post typically doesn\u2019t identify victims of sexual violence.) She said she escaped when he dropped the knife and she managed to stab him.\n\nThe 51-year-old woman who escaped by using her box cutter testified that she waited three days to notify police, fearing she could get in trouble for stabbing the man. At first, she pointed police toward another man who had asked her for sex shortly before the attack.\n\nBut a state crime lab tested the blood on the sweatpants she was wearing during the attack, prosecutors said in court, and came back with a hit on Martin\u2019s DNA. The abandoned house where she escaped was the same property where police found Jones\u2019s body two days later.\n\nFor now, Martin has been charged with assault with intent to murder and four counts of criminal sexual assault in the attack on the 26-year-old, WDIV reported. In the second case, he\u2019s charged with kidnapping and sexually assaulting the 51-year-old.\n\nMartin\u2019s attorney didn\u2019t immediately return a message. Police have not said which killings are tied to the homicide warrants filed on Thursday.\n\nWhen the 51-year-old woman testified about her ordeal in a preliminary hearing in August, she broke down in tears on the stand.\n\n\u201cI thought I was going to die,\u201d she said.\n\nMore from Morning Mix:\n\n\u2018Being Christian is love\u2019: Drew Brees defends appearing in video linked to anti-LGBT religious group\n\nA judge who sentenced a Jewish inmate used anti-Semitic slurs, lawyers say.
