For about 320,000 customers, the power didn't come back, incident manager Mark Quinlan said Tuesday evening.\n\n\"The dynamic and changing weather conditions and high fire risk means that some customers who are currently out of power from the October 26 event will remain out throughout the duration of the October 29 event,'' PG&E said in a news release.\n\n'Diablo' winds: Fierce winds are fanning the wildfires. What are they?\n\nExperts say every customer account services an average of between two and three people, so about a million people haven't had electricity since Saturday. Even after the wind dies down enough to allow for power restoration, PG&E personnel have to inspect thousands of miles of lines before the lights can go back on.\n\nThe extended blackouts could nullify any goodwill PG&E may gain from relenting on the rebate front. The utility will issue a bill credit for customers affected by the first shutoff this month, PG&E's CEO and President Bill Johnson announced in a statement.\n\nResidential customers will see a $100 credit in the next billing cycle and businesses will get $250, the utility said. Credits will not be issued for the subsequent shutoffs, PG&E said, because the company worked to improve how it notified customers.\n\n\"This is not an industry standard practice, nor approved as part of a tariff, but we believe it is the right thing to do for our customers in this case, given the challenges with our website and call center communications,\" Johnson said.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom, who has been highly critical of what he called PG&E's mismanagement and greed, had pushed the utility to reimburse subscribers affected by the shutoffs $100 each.\n\nMore than 20 million weary Californians have been bracing for \"extreme\" or \"critical\" wildfire risks because of a rewind of the furious winds that drove devastating blazes and forced more than 200,000 people to flee their homes.\n\nThousands of firefighters Tuesday battled drought conditions and stiff winds fueling the two main culprits, the Kincade Fire burning north of San Francisco and the Getty Fire in Los Angeles.\n\nAccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Paul Walker warned that gusts reaching 60 to 70 mph through Wednesday evening in Northern California could hamper firefighters battling the Kincade Fire in Sonoma County. The blaze, which had consumed more than 118 square miles, had damaged or destroyed more than 200 buildings and was only 15% contained.\n\nThe National Weather Service said almost 18 million Californians were living in areas where the fire risk was critical. Another 3.2 million face an extreme risk, the service said.\n\n\"Dry fuels and ongoing large fires continue to support ongoing critical and extremely critical fire weather conditions,\" the weather service said in its fire outlook for the state.\n\nThe gloomy forecast wasn't as severe as last weekend's wind event when gusts howled near 100 mph. Still, Pacific Gas & Electric said it would shut off power to hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses affecting approximately 1.5 million people in 29 counties to reduce wildfire risk.\n\nThe 'new normal'?: Raging fires, high winds and blackouts in California\n\nScotty Richardson, who lives in the Sonoma County town of Petaluma and lost power Saturday, said he was furious with PG&E.\n\n\u201cPG&E can\u2019t figure out how to deliver power reliably without killing people,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is more than three strikes \u2013 it\u2019s a failure of epic proportions.\u201d\n\nPG&E, which filed for bankruptcy in January after its power lines were blamed for fires that caused billions in damage, has stood firm on its preemptive outage efforts despite drawing outrage from customers and state leaders.", "description": "Millions of fire-weary Californians were bracing for preemptive power outages and a rewind of furious winds that have driven dangerous wildfires.", "authors": ["Jorge L.
