The burger, called the P.L.T. or \"Plant. Lettuce. Tomato.,\" will appear on menus in Southern Ontario for 12 weeks starting on September 30.\n\nRead more: McDonald's tests meat-free Beyond Meat burger in Canada\n\nMcDonald's is careful to note that the burger \u2014 which is topped with a slice of cheddar cheese \u2014 will not be 100% vegan. The P.L.T.'s description reads: \"Cooked on the same grill as other burgers, meat-based products and eggs.\"\n\nAs more chains add plant-based burgers to the menu, few have the kitchen space or equipment to prepare the new menu items in separate, meat-free environments. For example, many Burger King locations prepare the Impossible Whopper alongside the traditional Whopper.\n\nMany people, including those who avoid eating meat, saw the P.L.T. and other plant-based burgers as a step in the right direction. Companies like Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat additionally aim to address climate change by reducing global beef consumption, as cows contribute more to global greenhouse-gas emissions than cars.\n\nHowever, for some vegans, even touching a meat is a dealbreaker.\n\nBeyond Meat's shares shot up 13% in opening trading after news that McDonald's was collaborating with the plant-based \"meat\" maker on the P.L.T.", "description": "While some vegans avoid consuming any food that touches meat, many see McDonald's P.L.T. burger as a step in the right direction.", "authors": ["Kate Taylor"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8cc68d2e22af5cfa2d84c4-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
