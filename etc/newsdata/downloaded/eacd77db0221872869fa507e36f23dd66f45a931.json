But weeks turned to months without any arrangements being made.\n\nPablo Martinez Monsivais/AP\n\nDuring that time, North Korea instead test-fired six rounds of ballistic missiles -- a total of eight since the Hanoi summit ended without an agreement. Analysts -- and Bolton, Trump's longest-serving National Security Advisor -- have warned that those tests allow North Korea to enhance its missile capability and undermine United Nations Security Council resolutions, which prohibit the launches.\n\nJonathan Ernst/AFP/Getty Images\n\nTrump and Pompeo, however, have dismissed or downplayed them, saying they do not violate a personal agreement between Trump and Kim that Pyongyang will not test nuclear devices or the longer-range intercontinental ballistic missiles -- a promise Kim reportedly made in person, but that has never been codified in a deal.\n\nTrump and Kim's first meeting in Singapore in June 2018 yielded a vague joint declaration that committed their countries to the \"complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula\" and a change in their relations. But the two sides still don't have a shared definition of that term, and the second meeting in Vietnam ended when North Korea offered only to dismantle its nuclear facilities at Yongbyon, but not its existing nuclear weapons stockpile or its secret other sites, in exchange for economic sanctions being lifted.\n\nPablo Martinez Monsivais/AP\n\nThe sequencing has stopped any forward movement. The U.S. has instead said sanctions won't be lifted until North Korea begins to dismantle its entire nuclear weapons program, which Bolton argued Monday Kim has not decided he will do.\n\nWith both sides spending the last eight months demanding the other change its negotiating position, working-level talks are seen as critical to possibly finding a path forward. U.S. Special Representative for North Korea Stephen Biegun is expected to lead the American team. He attended Trump's DMZ meeting in June and led U.S. negotiators in the talks leading up to the Hanoi summit, but beyond those meetings, he's largely been ignored by North Korea, which instead seeks direct engagement with Trump.\n\nIt's unclear what prompted working-level talks to happen now. State Department officials have consistently said since June that the U.S. is ready to meet whenever North Korea is, but beyond the exchange of some letters with Trump, there has been little interaction.\n\nIn early September, after months of diplomatic standstill, North Korea announced it was ready to meet with the U.S., but warned the country must abandon its \"worn-out scenario\" and come with a new approach. With Bolton fired and Trump saying he's open to a \"new method\" to talks, it seems North Korea now believes Trump may do just that.", "description": "The U.S. and North Korea will finally hold working-level talks this week after months at a diplomatic standstill.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/trump-dmz-gty-er-190930_hpMain_2_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
