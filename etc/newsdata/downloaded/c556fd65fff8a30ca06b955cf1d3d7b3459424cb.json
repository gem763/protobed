Each was charged with two counts of conspiracy, one count of false statements and one of falsification of business records.\n\nThe two men were donors to a pro-Trump fundraising committee and the president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, has said they helped him as he sought to investigate former Vice President Biden and Biden's son Hunter.\n\nParnas is a Ukrainian businessman. Fruman is a real estate investor who was born in Belarus. Both, according to various media accounts, helped introduce Giuliani into top Ukrainian political circles.\n\nParnas and Fruman in May 2018 contributed $325,000 to a pro-Trump political action committee called America First Action, and the donation was falsely reported as coming from a purported natural gas company, according to the indictment.\n\nThe two men falsely claimed the company, called GEP, was \"a real business enterprise\" and that \"its major purpose is energy trading, not political activity,\" the indictment said. In fact, it said, the company had no real business.\n\nThe two were arrested at Dulles airport in Virginia before a planned flight to Vienna on Wednesday night, sources familiar with the matter said.\n\nParnas and Fruman were accused of conspiring to \"funnel foreign money to candidates for federal and state office,\" according to a federal court filing in New York.\n\nJohn Dowd, the lawyer for Parnas and Fruman, declined to comment on the charges. Dowd previously represented Trump in former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation that detailed Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign to boost Trump's candidacy.\n\nGiuliani did not immediately return a request for comment. Last week he told Reuters, \"Parnas and Igor helped me on certain things. They helped me with logistics. They know the Ukraine, they speak Russian. They helped me locate people in a few cases.\"\n\nJay Sekulow, a lawyer for the president, told Reuters that \"neither the president nor the campaign was aware of their scheme,\" referring to the defendants.\n\nTrump has denied wrongdoing and has described the impeachment probe as a partisan smear.\n\n\n\n\n\nHOUSE SUBPOENAS\n\nBoth men were expected to figure in the House impeachment drive and had been asked to produce documents and give testimony. Parnas had been scheduled to take part in a deposition with House lawmakers on Thursday, with Fruman scheduled on Friday. Dowd had called the lawmakers' demands \"unreasonable.\" House Democrats on Thursday issued subpoenas for the men to hand over the documents and testify at a later date\n\nAccording to the indictment, Parnas also sought the help of a U.S. congressman - identified by a person familiar with the matter as Republican Pete Sessions - to get the Trump administration to remove the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. Trump eventually did remove Yovanovitch and called her \"bad news\" in his July 25 call with Zelenskiy.\n\nGiuliani told Reuters last week he had provided information to both Trump and the State Department about Yovanovitch, who he suggested was biased against Trump. Yovanovitch is scheduled to give testimony in the House impeachment inquiry.\n\nSessions lost his House seat last year to a Democrat. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nProsecutors said Parnas, Fruman and others also conspired to funnel donations to state and federal candidates in multiple states to benefit a planned marijuana business funded by an unnamed foreign businessman. The business never came to fruition, according to the indictment.", "description": "WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Two foreign-born Florida businessmen who have been helping President Donald Trump's personal lawyer investigate political rival Joe Biden have been arrested on charges of funneling foreign money to U.S. political candidates and a pro-Trump election committee, authorities", "authors": ["Aram Roston", "Brendan Pierson", "Karen Freifeld"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Jhj89FAQcAVeGKBYQ.OkbA--~B/aD0zMTI7dz00NTA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/reuters.com/0a30fb63c78cee1d5c6e8b35860d5d47", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
