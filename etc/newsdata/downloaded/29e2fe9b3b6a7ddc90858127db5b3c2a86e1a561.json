Team executives sought a sponsor when the stadium was under construction in 2006 and again in 2016, but negotiations did not yield a suitable offer.\n\nNaming rights deals can be a key source of revenue for sports teams, with high-end agreements generating as much as $20 million annually for franchises over a period often stretching for a decade or longer. While a World Series victory would not guarantee the Nationals a top-dollar deal, it could bring corporate partners interested in national exposure back to the table, according to Gemini Sports Group President Rob Yowell, who was involved in the franchise\u2019s initial naming rights talks.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m the Nationals, it\u2019s certainly a great time to be having those types of conversations, first and foremost with your current partners, if anybody wants to elevate themselves above the clutter and become the most prominent partner of a World Series champion or the National League pennant winners,\u201d Yowell told FOX Business.\n\nThe Nationals are one of just nine MLB teams without a corporate naming rights partner for their stadium. Most of the holdouts, such as the Boston Red Sox\u2019s Fenway Park or the Chicago Cubs\u2019 Wrigley Field, have stadiums known as historic sites in baseball circles.\n\nFor franchises who manage to cash in on a deal, the payoff can be massive. Citigroup agreed in 2006 to pay the New York Mets $20 million per year over a 15-year period to headline at Citi Field.\n\nWhile the Nationals drew strong early demand from sponsors before Nationals Park opened its doors, negotiations stalled after management set a top-of-the-market price tag for a deal. At the time, the Nationals had just relocated from their stint as the Montreal Expos, a franchise that had failed to sustain competitive play.\n\n\u201cThere was obviously lots of speculation and discussion of the type of partner they wanted and certainly what the price was and I know there was lots of interest in that building back in the early days, before the park opened,\u201d Yowell said. \u201cI think there was \u2014 I won\u2019t call it unrealistic \u2014 but they had a very high value of what they thought they were going to get.\u201d\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nFor corporate sponsors considering a stadium sponsorship, the price is just one consideration. Companies have to consider if the team\u2019s market is a good fit for their brand and if ownership will keep the franchise\u2019s brand strong over the 20-year period typically required to secure a naming rights deal in a major U.S. sports league.\n\nSome international companies \u2014 such as those based in China \u2014 could balk at the notion of buying naming rights for a stadium in a politically fraught city like Washington, D.C.\n\nRegardless of whether the Nationals close out their World Series battle with the Houston Astros with a title, a run to the championship should yield more national television exposure next season \u2014 increasing the potential value of its stadium in terms of brand exposure.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nBut to land a deal, the Nationals would have to sell a partner on the notion that their success is sustainable.\n\n\u201cCertainly being a World Series champ means a lot, but it doesn\u2019t guarantee you anything down the road,\u201d Yowell said. \u201cWhat you hope is that you\u2019re selling the overall experience, the overall relationship, the commitment of your ownership and front office to build a perennial winning organization that\u2019s going to be strong in the community.\u201d", "description": "For franchises who manage to cash in on a stadium naming rights deal, the payoff can be massive.", "authors": ["Thomas Barrabi"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/Washington-Nationals.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
