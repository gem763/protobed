You should know that Twitter is not on your side,\u201d Dotcom tweeted, railing against the platform\u2019s murky censorship practices.\n\n\u201cIf you want to read my free speech and that of many other censored voices you have to visit our Twitter profiles. The deep state controls social media to control you.\u201d\n\nWe are killing the truth-teller and journalist Julian Assange by not doing enough to save him.\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t just mobilize for mass protests when your fuel prices go up. Your right to know the TRUTH will be wiped out if they can kill Assange without opposition.\n\n\n\nFight back, hard & now! \u2014 Kim Dotcom (@KimDotcom) October 23, 2019\n\nDoctom had previously vowed to abandon Twitter and establish his own alternative after accusing the social media giant, and its CEO Jack Dorsey, of \u201cmessing with our free speech\u201d amid claims that tweets regarding the death of DNC staffer Seth Rich were censored on the platform.\n\nTwitter previously admitted to anti-abuse measures which limit the reach of controversial accounts, so that their tweets are only seen by their followers. Additionally, this means retweets of posts from \u2018offending accounts\u2019 will not be shown to others.\n\nAlso on rt.com Kim Dotcom proposes Twitter alternative over 'censorship of Seth Rich tweets'\n\nMany of Dotcom\u2019s supporters claim to have been unaware of his recent Assange discussions.\n\noh wow, I really didn't see any of your Assange tweets on my feed until I visited your profile. Shame on you @jack \u2014 Ekim Naz\u0131m Kaya (@ekimnazimkaya) October 23, 2019\n\nOthers suggested that he should join them on other platforms that are more conducive to free speech, especially comments critical of Western governments and tech oligopolies, while some criticized his lack of action in creating his long-promised Twitter alternative.\n\n\n\nLike this story?
