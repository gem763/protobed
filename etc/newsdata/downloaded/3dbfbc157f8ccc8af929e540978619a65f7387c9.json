But some of these talking points \u2013 regularly repeated in the news media \u2013 do not hold up to a fact check.\n\nTRUMP, ALLIES RAMP UP ATTACKS OVER UKRAINE CALL FUROR AS DEMS HIT GAS ON IMPEACHMENT\n\nHere are three talking points being used to defend the Bidens:\n\nPoint 1: There was an \u201cabsolute wall\u201d between Hunter Biden\u2019s business and Vice President Biden.\n\nAt a campaign stop last month, Joe Biden claimed to have an \u201cabsolute wall\u201d between himself and his family\u2019s business. He said: \u201cThere will be an absolute wall between personal and private [business interests] and the government.... That\u2019s why I never talked with my son or my brother or anyone else \u2013 even distant family \u2013 about their business interests. Period.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s \u201cabsolute wall\u201d clearly has holes. In an interview with The New Yorker earlier this year, Hunter recalled discussing his work at Burisma, a controversial Ukrainian natural gas company, with his father on at least one occasion.\n\nOn a separate occasion, Devon Archer \u2013 Hunter\u2019s longtime business partner and fellow Burisma director \u2013 met privately with Vice President Biden at the White House hours after first receiving payment from Burisma.\n\nWhile in office, Vice President Biden was certainly aware of Hunter\u2019s role at Burisma, because his office was specifically asked in 2014 about the potential conflict of interest. A spokesperson for vice president\u2019s office defended Hunter\u2019s right to do business in Ukraine as \u201ca private citizen and a lawyer.\"\n\nApparently, the potential conflict with U.S. foreign policy wasn\u2019t sufficient reason to reign Hunter in. In fact, the younger Biden didn\u2019t step down from Burisma until earlier this year \u2013 when it became an issue for his father\u2019s campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nWhile in office, Vice President Biden was certainly aware of Hunter\u2019s role at Burisma, because his office was specifically asked in 2014 about the potential conflict of interest\n\nPoint 2: The Burisma investigation doesn\u2019t represent a conflict of interest for Joe Biden.\n\nBurisma began paying Hunter Biden as a legal advisor after British authorities opened a corruption investigation into the company\u2019s owner. Shortly afterward, Ukrainian authorities launched an investigation of their own.\n\nSome in the media, such as the Washington Post\u2019s fact-checker, have repeated the claim that the Burisma investigation had been \u201cshelved\u201d by late 2015, when Joe Biden called for the prosecutor in charge to be fired.\n\nBut according to Burisma\u2019s own attorneys, the case was not formally closed until September 2016, months after the prosecutor was fired. Others, such as Transparency International, say the matter remained open until November 2016.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThe truth is that the investigation continued for years after Hunter was hired, all while Vice President Biden played an active role in U.S. relations with Ukraine.\n\nPoint 3: This is all a phony scandal being stirred up by Trump\u2019s allies.\n\nSome news outlets have gone so far as to dismiss the entire Burisma story as baseless spin drummed up by the Trump campaign. In reality, the Burisma issue predates the Trump administration.\n\nLong before Burisma emerged as a campaign issue, I published \u201cSecret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends,\u201d which detailed the extent of Biden corruption in Ukraine.\n\nPrior to that, many of the same outlets now dismissing the allegations about the Bidens and Ukraine had been critical of Hunter\u2019s work. Reporters from The New York Times, Washington Post, and Wall Street Journal all wrote critically of Hunter\u2019s new job.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nNow, some of those same writers are accusing those currently examining and discussing Burisma of conducting a partisan smear.\n\nHave the basic facts of the story changed since it was first reported? No \u2013 only the politics surrounding it.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY PETER SCHWEIZER\n\nJacob McLeod is a senior researcher with the Government Accountability Institute.", "description": "Amid the furor over President Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, which has prompted House Democrats to move forward with a Trump impeachment inquiry, serious underlying questions about the Biden family\u2019s involvement in Ukraine persist.", "authors": ["Peter Schweizer", "Peter Schweizer Is The President Of The"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/trump-biden.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
