There is a group of communists who still have ideas to overthrow the monarchy, to turn Thailand to communism,\" Apirat told an auditorium of military officers, policemen, and uniformed students.\n\nThe monarchy is legally above reproach in Thailand, and the new constitutional monarch who was officially crowned in May, King Maha Vajiralongkorn, has taken several steps since the death of his father to increase his authority, including taking direct control of two key army units.\n\nLast week, the military filed a sedition case against Thanathorn and others, accusing them of stirring unrest with talk of amending the 2017 constitution written by allies of the military.\n\nIt followed a public seminar they held in the Muslim-majority south, in which the first article of the constitution - stating that Thailand is one indivisible kingdom - was discussed.\n\n\"They are being shrewd, talking of amending the first article without stating directly what they want, knowing this will affect other articles about the monarchy,\" Apirat said.\n\n\"This article invoked the blood our ancestors had shed to keep this land. I can tell you I will never allow it, even to my dying day,\" Apirat said.\n\nThe army chief portrayed \"self-serving\" politicians and a \"businessman born into wealth who colludes with foreigners, brainwash young people, and want to bring down the nation and the monarchy\" as enemies of the state.\n\nMeanwhile, he cast the military as loyal to the nation and the royal family.\n\n\"Don't forget that Thailand is the only country in this region that has never been colonized, thanks to past kings,\" Apirat said.
