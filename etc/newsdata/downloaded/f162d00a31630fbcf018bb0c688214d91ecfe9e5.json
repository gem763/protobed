He loved his cars, he was a real petrolhead. He dreamed one day of having his own garage with his friend Luke.\n\n\"Dillon was always loving and friendly. He was always doing something with his car. He was never in a dark place as long as he could drive. He would thrive off his cars and driving them.\n\n\"As soon as he got paid he spent it all on doing a car up and selling it on for more value. He was a proper Del Boy like that.\"\n\nDespite being only in his early twenties, Dillon had a tough life throughout his mid-teens.\n\nHis sister said their parents died just two weeks apart which really affected Dillon, but he found solace in his love for cars and remained strong for his family.\n\n(Image: Hull Daily Mail / MEN Media)\n\nDillon had tragically discovered their mother dead at her home in west Hull in 2015.\n\nShe added: \"He didn\u2019t have a bad upbringing at all, just a very emotional one. He loved time to himself and was always in his car or fixing someone else\u2019s - his car was his man cave on wheels.\"\n\nRoxann said that she received a frantic call from Dillon\u2019s friend who thought the car had run out of petrol after discovering it in Homebase carpark in March this year.\n\n\"The windows were steamed up so you couldn\u2019t see if anyone was inside,\" she said. \"Then all I heard was screaming down the other end of the phone. That's when I knew.\"\n\n(Image: Hull Daily Mail / MEN Media)\n\nShe says her brother had fallen asleep and the exhaust fumes seeping into the vehicle from a hole in the pipe caused her brother\u2019s death.\n\nRoxann added: \u201cHe went through so much in his short life, he had so much more to live for, so much to look forward to.\n\n\"He was just chilling out in his car, reclined in his seat. He used to visit the car park to use the wifi and watch movies on his phone.\n\n\"I\u2019m still absolutely devestated. So many people have said nasty things about my brother at the time, but he didn\u2019t have a bad bone in his body and would do anything for anyone. He really would.\"", "description": "Dillon Denton was found lifeless in the Homebase car park in Hessle, near Hull, earlier this year", "authors": ["Tom Kershaw", "Image", "Hull Daily Mail", "Men Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20536282.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS195330293.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
