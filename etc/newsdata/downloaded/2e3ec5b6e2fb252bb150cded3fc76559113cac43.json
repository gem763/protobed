One study also gave remedial tutoring in schools to more than 5 million children in India.\n\nThe Associated Press reported that Duflo, 46, is the youngest person and second woman to be given the economics award.\n\n\u201cShowing that it is possible for a woman to succeed and be recognized for success I hope is going to inspire many, many other women to continue working and many other men to give them the respect that they deserve like every single human being,\u201d she said during a news conference, according to the wire service.", "description": "Three economists were awarded the Nobel Prize for economics for their research into global poverty.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/nobel.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
