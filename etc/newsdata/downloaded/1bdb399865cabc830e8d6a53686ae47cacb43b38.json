They\u2019re yelling something about being out of position or not running hard enough for the ball. On a recent Saturday morning, the coach on the next field over was yelling at a pair of boys running past that they should \u201cplay soccer.\u201d They stared at him with confusion. The girls on my team giggled because we were all there to play soccer.\n\nI turned to the goalie on our team and said with a smile, \u201cOh man, I didn\u2019t know I was supposed to be yelling at you. I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ll do that more.\u201d\n\nShe smiled back, showing me the gap in her front teeth. \u201cSounds good, coach.\u201d\n\nThat dad \u2014 and plenty of other parents \u2014 are sucking the joy out of recreational sports from the sidelines.\n\nI have been coaching girls\u2019 and boys\u2019 soccer for the past six years and I\u2019ve learned one key lesson: If you\u2019re not having fun, your kids are not having fun. Recreational leagues exist because sports are supposed to be fun. Let\u2019s not wreck that. So in case you\u2019ve forgotten what fun looks like, here are a few simple steps to make sure everybody is enjoying themselves.\n\nChannel your inner child\n\nRemember how fun kindergarten was? Bring kindergarten back into practices. I have been a dinosaur and a fairy during practices over the years. I once made a fellow coach growl like a bear and meow like a cat. (He\u2019s mostly forgiven me.)\n\nThere\u2019s a dribbling drill that I still run with 11-year-olds that makes them giggle like they\u2019re five-year-olds. I ask them to magically transform their ball into something else (an egg, baby dragon) and then ask them what would try to steal that baby dragon. I then try to \u201csteal\u201d that baby dragon away (and have discovered that most of my animal accents sound like cows).\n\nRemember that you can play, too. One of the highlights of the season is our annual kids versus parents game. The girls manage their own team and run circles around the coaches and parents, many of whom haven\u2019t played since they were in elementary school. The game ends in laughter or whenever it gets too dark to play. The kids always want to keep playing.\n\nCheer for the hits and the misses\n\nCheer loudest when things go wrong. I cheer for effort instead of results. In life, you tell your kids things are going to be ok after something goes wrong. Find the same compassion as a fan or a coach.\n\nRemind yourself and your kids that the other team are also kids. I cheer for great saves and nice plays on both sides. After the game, I always tell a member of the other team one great thing I saw them do.\n\nI don\u2019t just do this for them. I do it so my team and my daughter see me do it. Bill Snyder, the longtime and recently retired head coach of the Kansas State University soccer team, wrote hundreds of handwritten notes to encourage opposing players over the years. Sportsmanship is a big part of sports, but it\u2019s learned by example.\n\nAfter the game, don\u2019t fall into the competition trap. If soccer legend Abby Wambach doesn\u2019t offer advice following a game, you should probably hold your tongue, as well. Your kid knows if they didn\u2019t have a good game and so does their coach. Odds are it\u2019s something they\u2019ll work on in practice or just forget in a few days unless you remind them in the moment about how they failed. Then you\u2019ve just created sadness.\n\nNever stop bringing snacks\n\nThink about how you feel when cake shows up unexpectedly in the office break room. That\u2019s how your kids feel about free fruit snacks and orange slices. Snacks may be the best part of the game. Want to go above and beyond? Bring snacks for your team and the other team. (Then soak in the adoring cheers of your new fans.)\n\nThe truth is that it\u2019s easy to yell. But it\u2019s empty calories. You yell and then you don\u2019t feel great that you were yelling. That dad? The one from the next field over? A few plays after losing his mind, he shook his head and said to nobody in particular, \u201cWhy do you make me yell?\u201d\n\nNobody is making you yell. That\u2019s a choice you\u2019re making. Make a different choice next time. Remember, you\u2019re on the sidelines because you are on your kid\u2019s side.", "description": "You always hear that coach before you see them.
