I see them like I see James Dean, rebellious but beautiful with all the vigor and freshness of youth. It could be considered a critical point of view, but I hope it generates something positive,\u201d she added.\n\nThe film is released in Turkey in the autumn and its presence at Cannes will ensure a wide a distribution.", "description": "\u2018Mustang\u2019  is a film by Turkish director Deniz Gamze Erg\u00fcven and is presented as part of the Directors Fortnight, a parallel selection, at the Cannes", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/306433/1000x563_306433.jpg", "published_at": "2015-05-21"}
