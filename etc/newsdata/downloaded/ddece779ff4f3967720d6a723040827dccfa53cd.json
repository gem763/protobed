Against all odds, the teenagers made their relationship work and, in the coming episodes, they discuss the future of said relationship, before making an announcement to their friends and family.\n\nAfter getting in with the local drug pushers last year, Tiffany found herself at the beck and call of smooth-talking ring leader, Evie Steele (Sophia Capasso). With help from her uncle Jack (Scott Maslen), she was able to get out of the dangerous circle and move on \u2014 although she later revealed to that Fraser (Shanu Hazzan) had raped her prior to her extraction from the gang.\n\nThe following months saw her develop feelings for Keegan \u2014 feelings which the young lad clearly reciprocated \u2014 and, before long, they decided to make a proper go of things. Due to the strength of this relationship, Tiffany has found herself happy once more, and she was even able to open up to Keegan about what Fraser did to her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith Tiff studying at college and Keegan determined to make a go of his business, they currently have the whole world at their feet and, in the coming episodes, they discuss their future together, and all that it might hold.\n\nLater in the week, Tiffany and Keegan inform their families that they\u2019ve got an announcement to make \u2014 something which leaves Sonia (Natalie Cassidy) and the entire Taylor clan incredibly intrigued.\n\nThe question is: just what is it that the teenagers have to reveal?\n\nWhat\u2019s more, is it good news or bad news?\n\nActors Maisie and Zack were recently spotted filming wedding scenes on-location, so it\u2019s possible that this announcement could be an engagement.\n\nOne to watch: Tuesday 15th October at 7:30pm on BBC One.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Keegan and Tiff discuss their future \u2014 and come to a huge decision as a result!", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/18622344-low_res-eastenders-july-september-2019-984f_1570489200.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
