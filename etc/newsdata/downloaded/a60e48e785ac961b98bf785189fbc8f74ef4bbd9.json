Valtteri Bottas has been seen at the medical centre and has returned to the paddock. Great news.\u201d\n\nBottas qualified in sixth, two places behind his Mercedes team-mate and defending five-time champion Lewis Hamilton for Sunday\u2019s race, but could be hit by car problems following his crash at the high-speed Peraltada curve.\n\n\u201cThe car is extensively damaged \u2013 we are assessing what work needs to be completed for it to be ready to race,\u201d said Mercedes.\n\nThis may result in new parts for the car, possibly including a gearbox, which could result in a grid penalty ahead of the race \u2013 making it more possible that champion-elect Hamilton could outscore him by 14 points to seal his sixth title success.\n\nHamilton said he would \u201cgive it everything\u201d in his scrap for a podium finish and hoped to enjoy a close battle with pole sitter Max Verstappen of Red Bull and the two Ferraris.\n\nVerstappen\u2019s performance in the final minutes of qualifying when he clocked an improved lap time on his second run was under scrutiny after the session as he ignored a waved yellow flag following Bottas\u2019s crash.\n\nThe Dutchman, who could have faced a penalty if he was the subject of a stewards\u2019 inquiry, said he did not care if the stewards deleted his lap time as his earlier fastest lap was still enough for him to claim pole.\n\nAsked if he had obeyed the rules when he saw the yellow flag and reduced speed, he said: \u201cIt didn\u2019t look like it, did it?\u201d", "description": "Mexico City (AFP) \u2013 Championship challenger Valtteri Bottas was released from the Mexico Grand Prix medical centre on Saturday after being checked", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/26/b466b4_bottas-leaving-circuit-his-crash-bottas-released-medical-centre-mexico-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
