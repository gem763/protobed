After all, there\u2019s a lot of upside to signing the world. Go to Hawaii any time you want. Skiing in the Alps. All the wine in Tuscany. The Grand Canyon! It could really be great.\n\nIf the world doesn\u2019t work out, just cut it. Let the lousy world go play for the Jets.\n\nAll this is a long way of saying: They\u2019ve done it again, maddeningly.\n\nBelichick\u2019s New England Patriots\u2014supervillains supreme; the best NFL team of the 21st century; a franchise that makes the otherwise rational sports fan want to hit themselves over the head with a cast iron frying pan\u2014have once more capitalized on Other People\u2019s Mistakes, snagging a starry weapon for a team that already has plenty.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, the defending Super Bowl champions reached an agreement with Antonio Brown, the seven-time Pro Bowl wide receiver who did everything besides pretend to be a tomato to get released by the pathetic Raiders.\n\nJon Gruden\u2019s regret is now Tom Brady\u2019s top target. It\u2019s like getting kicked out of a highway motel\u2026and into a five-star suite.\n\nIf I were a Raiders fan, I would put another grocery bag over the grocery bag that\u2019s already been on my head for the past few years.\n\nIs anyone surprised? This is what the Patriots do. I told you this would happen last week! Belichick, aka The Grumpy Lobster Boat Captain, runs a merciless shop with a clear ethos\u2014it\u2019s the Grumpy Captain\u2019s way, or the highway.\n\nEveryone knows the deal walking in, so Belichick doesn\u2019t mind taking a gamble on a talented player whom an opponent has cast away. If it doesn\u2019t work out, Grumpy Cap\u2019n cuts bait and moves on.\n\nCorey Dillon. Randy Moss. Josh Gordon. And now AB\u2014on his way to Foxborough, Mass., after an unsuccessful summer residency in the souls of Gruden and Raiders GM Mike Mayock.\n\nAntonio Brown, center, with Raiders coach Jon Gruden and general manager Mike Mayock, didn\u2019t wind up playing a game in Oakland.

It\u2019s like watching a tycoon find a $100 bill on the street. The Patriots are a Bond movie where the villain wins in the end. They\u2019re a \u201cStar Wars\u201d remake in which Luke Skywalker misses, and Darth Vader actually finishes building the Death Star.\n\nBrown may have proven himself to be a handful during his nine seasons in Pittsburgh\u2014and his 11 or so minutes in Oakland\u2014but the former sixth-round draft choice from Central Michigan (which, incidentally, lost to Wisconsin 61-0 Saturday) remains one of the most electric players in football. He gives the Patriots the sort of dynamic threat they once had in Moss. He\u2019s also just 31\u2014less than half Brady\u2019s age.\n\nConspiracy theories are rampant at the moment. One of the most common, unsubstantiated, possibly total nonsense theories is that Brown, traded in the off-season from Pittsburgh to Oakland, took one look at the crummy Raiders and said to himself: Uh-oh. I have to get out of here.\n\nThus the monthlong AB vs. Oakland drama that included a bout with cryotherapy-scorched feet, an outdated helmet imbroglio, an Instagram-launched confrontation with the general manager, and a very odd YouTube video released on Friday night featuring what sounded like a recorded phone call with Gruden.\n\nIs Brown secretly a genius? Was he trying to make this happen all along? Was his very public, very modern unraveling a canny, three-moves-ahead maneuver to find his way to New England?\n\nI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what the takeaway is here. What do we tell the kids?\n\nLet this be a lesson to you, young \u2018uns: If you feud with your team, have a weird helmet problem, become a preseason headache, accumulate a ton of fines, you might just find yourself released\u2026to catch touchdown passes in Super Bowl LIV from Tom Brady!\n\nNew England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, right, chats with Antonio Brown after a game in 2016.

Steelers fans were highly entertained by Brown\u2019s fiasco in Oakland. Brown in New England is a nightmare. How remarkable would it have been to watch Brady and AB go to work against Pittsburgh?\n\nAlas, Brown cannot play, because of strict NFL rules against exciting things happening in the first weekend of the season. (Did you watch Bears-Packers? My eyeballs are considering a malpractice suit against the league.)\n\nStill, New England\u2019s season hasn\u2019t even started, and the Patriots have already won. The Grumpy Lobster Boat Captain has squinted into the salty Atlantic air and hauled in another brilliant catch. New England will be hard to stop on the way to a fourth straight Super Bowl appearance. If you\u2019re sick of them, you probably should make alternative plans for the first weekend of February.\n\nThe Patriots already run the world. The rest of us are just living in it\u2014until we wind up on the Jets. Or, possibly, the Raiders.\n\nShare Your Thoughts What are your thoughts on Antonio Brown headed to the Patriots?
