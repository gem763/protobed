These are intentionally limited devices, built around one central use: to read books.\n\nToday\u2019s best e-readers come pretty close to matching (and even beating) the print book experience. They offer screens with crisp, clean text, batteries that last for weeks, and benefits that print books can never match, like integrated backlights, waterproofing, and a nearly infinite library in your pocket.\n\nAnd with the latest wave of e-readers pushing the technology farther than ever, there\u2019s never been a better time to give one a shot. Even if we\u2019re still working on replicating the perfect new book smell.\n\nUpdate July 26th 2019, 8:30AM ET: Updated guide to add recent 2019 Kindle models.\n\nThe best e-reader: Amazon Kindle Paperwhite (2018)\n\nAmazon has long dominated the e-reader game with the Kindle Paperwhite, which marries the high resolution display and built-in light of Amazon\u2019s top-of-the-line readers with the lightweight, pocketable design of the company\u2019s base model Kindle. Even before the latest update, Amazon said that the Paperwhite was its best selling model, and for good reason \u2014 it\u2019s a nearly perfect mix of functionality and price point for an e-reader.\n\nThe 2018 Paperwhite \u2014 the first major update in years \u2014 advances things even further, adding waterproofing, support for listening to Audible audiobooks over Bluetooth, and an improved design with a flush display. The screen is a 6-inch 300ppi E Ink panel that\u2019s crisp even for tiny font sizes, the integrated light lets you read in the dark, and the hardware is still small and thin enough to slide into the back pocket of my jeans.\n\nThe old Paperwhite made even better\n\nThe Paperwhite has all of the full power of Amazon\u2019s years of refinements of Kindles behind it \u2014 the user interface is simple, but easy to manage, the fonts and formatting of books are great, and buying more things to read is almost dangerously easy to do right on the device. Amazon also has its services to sweeten the pot \u2014 Prime members get access to free content through the Prime Reading Program, users can sign up for an optional Kindle Unlimited subscription to further their a la carte options, and Amazon\u2019s purchase of Goodreads means that the largest literature-related social media network is built right into the device. And of course, the biggest and cheapest ebook library around.\n\nAmazon sells the Paperwhite for $129.99 at full price, but you should never spend that much on it, considering that Amazon frequently runs sales (the lowest price yet has been $90). Be aware, however, that the usual Amazon annoyances still apply. Adding cellular data will add $70 to the price, bumping up internal storage from 8GB to 32GB will add $30, and removing the ads from the home and lockscreen will cost another $20.\n\nThere are also a few annoyances that come with the hardware, like the lack of USB-C charging or faster 802.11n Wi-Fi. But sadly those apply to almost the entire e-reader marketplace, so it\u2019ll be tough to avoid those issues until manufacturers start to step up a bit.\n\nUltimately, though, in terms of getting the most -reader bang for your buck, nothing else comes close to the Paperwhite.\n\nThe step up: Amazon Kindle Oasis (2019)\n\nAmazon\u2019s Kindle Oasis was already the absolute best e-reader if price isn\u2019t a factor, and the updated third-generation version makes it even better, adding a color-temperature adjustable screen. It\u2019s a small change, but it makes it both easier to read in the dark as well as just plain nicer to use, due to the tinted color helping the screen look more like actual paper than before.\n\nThe absolute best e-reader, but it\u2019ll cost you\n\nEverything else about the 2019 Oasis is otherwise unchanged, for better or for worse. The design is still outstanding, with an asymmetrical style that\u2019s weighted perfectly to rest in one hand. And it still has an anodized aluminum case and physical page-turn buttons that are far nicer than the cheaper Kindles\u2019 touchscreen-only UX and plastic shells. It\u2019s also IPX8 waterproof and supports Audible audiobooks over Bluetooth.\n\nHead to head with the Paperwhite, the Oasis has a few specific improvements: a larger screen, a front light with 12 LEDs (over the Paperwhite\u2019s five) for more even lighting, and an adaptive light sensor that can automatically adjust the brightness for you (although not the color temperature, which would have been a nice addition).\n\nBut the Oasis still has its hefty price tag to contend with: nearly twice as much as the Paperwhite (or close to three times as much if you can find a Paperwhite on sale, which it frequently is), which makes it hard to recommend over the Paperwhite, even with the new screen. But if you want the best digital reading experience at any cost, nothing else beats the Oasis.\n\nOther options\n\nAmazon may be the 1,000-pound elephant in the room when it comes to ebooks, but it does have one major competitor: Kobo, the Canadian-based subsidiary of Japanese e-commerce giant Rakuten, which has its own full lineup of Kindle competitors as well.\n\nKobo\u2019s readers do have some great features that Amazon\u2019s don\u2019t: native support for Pocket articles, the ability to browse and borrow books from the popular Overdrive library system directly on the device (Amazon requires a computer to do it), and the simple fact that it doesn\u2019t involve buying into another Amazon service, which certainly appeals to some people.\n\nOur review of Kobo Forma Verge Score 7 out of 10 Good Stuff Largest eReader screen available\n\nWaterproof\n\nPhysical page turn buttons Bad Stuff Expensive\n\nUnwieldy to hold Buy for $279.99 from Kobo\n\nOur review of Kobo Clara HD Verge Score 6.5 out of 10 Good Stuff Compact design\n\nBacklight Bad Stuff Feels very plastic-y\n\nRecessed display Buy for $129.99 from Kobo\n\nOur review of Kobo Aura H20 Edition 2 Verge Score 6 out of 10 Good Stuff Waterproof\n\nLarger screen Bad Stuff Resolution not as good as other Kobo readers\n\nRecessed display Buy for $179.99 from Kobo\n\nOur review of Amazon Kindle (2019) Verge Score 5.5 out of 10 Good Stuff Still the cheapest Kindle\n\nBacklight Bad Stuff Low-resolution display\n\nNot waterproof\n\nRecessed screen Buy for $89.99 from Amazon", "description": "E-readers are a niche sort of technology, the antithesis of the \"jack of all trades, master of none\" philosophy that governs most tablets, phones, and other gadgets.
