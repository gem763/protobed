Monthly numbers aren\u2019t all that reliable. But they\u2019re the latest numbers we\u2019ve got, and the last we get before the federal election.\n\nA bump up in employment by 54,000 in September. A two-point drop in the unemployment rate to 5.5 per cent, one of the lowest rates on record. Year-on-year job growth of 456,000. An unemployment rate that, if calculated using U.S. concepts, would be 4.4 per cent, not too shabby, given our more spread-out labour market, even when compared to the Americans\u2019 3.5 per cent. (\u201cU.S. concepts\u201d involve requiring harder looking on the part of job searchers to count them as unemployed rather than out of the labour force.)\n\nIn Quebec, the unemployment rate was up a tick but is still a shockingly low 4.8 per cent. Shocking, that is, to anyone who has followed these numbers for the last 50 years. Ontario\u2019s rate is higher than Quebec\u2019s (words that are strange to write) at 5.3 per cent. But that\u2019s down from August\u2019s 5.6 per cent. In fact, Ontario and Nova Scotia were the only provinces where employment actually grew in September. In the other eight it held steady. September brought employment growth in Ontario to 252,000 over the last 12 months. That\u2019s 55 per cent of the new jobs created in the entire country and it includes an increase of 7,100 jobs in the public sector.\n\nYes, the province that Doug Ford\u2019s vicious, heartless, Harper-style austerity supposedly is razing to the ground, making it a kind of Death Valley of Confederation, has been responsible for 55 per cent of the new jobs created in Canada over the past 12 months, including an increase \u2014 albeit a small increase, but an increase \u2014 in public-sector employment.\n\nEconomists believe politicians shouldn\u2019t get too much credit or blame for the good or bad things that happen on their watch. The federal Liberals, with their wall-to-wall carpet bombing of the Ford-Scheer Conservatives, have clearly bought into that view. All the good things happening in Ontario\u2019s job market, they argue, are occurring in spite of Ford, not because of him.\n\nBut that\u2019s double-edged logic. All the good things happening to the Canadian economy, their opponents could very well argue, are occurring in spite of Trudeau, not because of him. And Canadians do seem to be buying into that view. If you judge by the unemployment and inflation numbers, the economy has seldom been in better shape. The \u201cmisery index\u201d \u2014 the sum of those two numbers \u2014 used to be in the teens consistently, sometimes even in the 20s. Now it\u2019s well under 10, so low in fact you never hear about it any more.\n\nIf political leaders got full credit for good economic times, Justin Trudeau should be cruising to a second majority. But, a week out, he\u2019s in a tough fight. This is one of the few ways, a weakness for colour-altering facial make-up being another, in which he is like Donald Trump. Though the U.S. economy has been going gang-busters for the past three years Trump is far from a shoe-in for re-election \u2014 unless, in a truly brilliant judo move, he gets impeachment-crazed Democrats to do the investigative dirty work on Joe Biden and serve up Elizabeth Warren to him as their party\u2019s nominee.\n\nApart from the impressive employment numbers\u2019 lack of influence on politics, the other very strange thing about them is that they come at a time that both the U.S. and Canada are still running fiscal deficits. True, you only know for sure an economy has peaked once you\u2019re on its down slope. But you\u2019ve got to think we\u2019re close to the peak. If we don\u2019t balance the budget now, are we ever going to balance it?\n\nThanksgiving is a time to count our blessings and prepare for winter. Fiscal winter is out there somewhere, maybe near, maybe far. We really don\u2019t want to start tightening only after it finally arrives. That\u2019s precisely the time you don\u2019t want to raise taxes or cut spending.\n\nFinancial Post", "description": "Fiscal winter is precisely the time you don\u2019t want to raise taxes or cut spending", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/snow-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
