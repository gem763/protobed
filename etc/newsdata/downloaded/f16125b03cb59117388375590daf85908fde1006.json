In the wild pandas generally live to up to 20 years, but can survive up to another decade in captivity.\n\nOutrage in China as giant panda on loan to Thailand zoo dies Read more\n\nThe panda, who had been on loan to Thailand since 2003 with female panda Lin Hui, was known for being obese and was famously put on a diet in 2007.\n\nBut in the wake of Chuang Chuang\u2019s death, a Chinese-assisted autopsy has ended speculation the Chiang Mai Zoo was at fault, with results showing he died from heart failure.\n\n\u201cThe autopsy and analysis by Chinese-Thai experts showed that the nutrition health of Giant Panda Chuang Chuang was good, no external wounds were found and no foreign objects were found in his trachea,\u201d the zoo said in a statement released Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe cause of his death was heart failure, resulting in the lack of oxygen of internal organs and leading to his death.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Chiang Mai Zoo confirmed it would pay an unspecified amount of compensation to China as outlined in the loan agreement.\n\nWhen Chuang Chuang collapsed after eating a piece of bamboo at his enclosure in the Thai zoo, panda fans lashed out at Thailand and also questioned China\u2019s \u201cpanda diplomacy\u201d where zoos abroad pay the country millions to host the endangered giant animals.\n\nOn Chinese social media platform Weibo one user wrote: \u201cPlease don\u2019t rent any more pandas to Thailand! No! Chuang Chuang is probably the most bitter panda in the world! What kind of bamboo he was given eat? If you can\u2019t afford [a panda], don\u2019t rent it.\u201d\n\nChuang Chuang and Lin Hui, who is expected to remain at the Thai zoo for the time being, were media darlings in Thailand.\n\nTheir 2005 \u201cwedding\u201d garnered significant media attention, and their first cub, which was subsequently sent to China, was featured on a 24-hour Panda Channel on Thai TV.", "description": "Thailand\u2019s Chiang Mai zoo was blamed for the death of Chuang Chuang in September, causing a panda diplomacy row", "authors": ["Kate Lamb"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f97b8b3cae55d721553cb0082dfef1acd5ecb80/0_170_2500_1499/master/2500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=175af69e6f555f4329b8aaca408828d4", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
