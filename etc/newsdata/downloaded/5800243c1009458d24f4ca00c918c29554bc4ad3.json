He told FOX Business he won\u2019t wear the headband again, even as he hopes the league will ease up fining athletes for expressing themselves.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nThis past weekend in a 12-10 win over the Dallas Cowboys, Davis wore a headband under his helmet that read \u201cMAN OF GOD.\u201d The headband was visible when Davis was on the sidelines but not when he was on the field when it was covered by his helmet.\n\nThe league announced a $7,000 fine for the uniform infraction. Players are barred from wearing items that allow personal expression.\n\n\u201cI was not expecting the fine because I had worn the headband before, but once I realized that it was against the rules, I was in a conflicting position,\u201d Davis told FOX Business.\n\n\u201cShould I continue to wear it because of the messaging or would I follow the rule? Which would bring ultimate glory to God?\u201d\n\nDavis, in his second season with the Saints, is one of the most vocal players in the NFL when it comes to his faith. His social media is frequently centered on his Christian walk.\n\nOne of the top linebackers in the NFL, Davis had 110 tackles and five sacks in New Orleans last year. Already through four games, Davis has 28 tackles.\n\nOf wearing the headband in the future, Davis said the decision has been made for this weekend.\n\n\u201cNo, I won\u2019t wear it, but I\u2019m working on a way to let fans buy them and donate towards a cause,\u201d Davis said. \u201cThat way, the fans can wear them for me.\u201d\n\nDavis does believe that the NFL needs to take a look at this topic and consider relaxing its rules when it comes to player expression. Especially when it comes to matters like that this don\u2019t reflect poorly on the league.\n\n\u201cI think it should be a topic of conversation, especially if the player\u2019s messaging is not offensive,\u201d Davis said.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM FOX BUSINESS\n\nIn 1986, the NFL infamously fined Chicago Bears quarterback Jim McMahon $5,000 for an Adidas headband he wore during a game counter to the league\u2019s rule on logos.\n\nThat same fine, adjusted for inflation, would run nearly $12,000 today.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "NFL linebacker Demario Davis speaks to FOX Business about getting fined by the NFL for wearing a faith-based headband.", "authors": ["Kristian Dyer"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/Demario-Davis-Getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
