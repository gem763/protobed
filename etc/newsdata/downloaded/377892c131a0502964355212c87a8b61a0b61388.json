They believe that his frustration is compounded by stress about the 2020 election and the economy's recent downturn.\n\n\"People are used to the president saying things that aren't true, but this Alabama stuff is another story,\" the former official said. \"This was the president sending out patently false information about a national-emergency situation as it was unfolding.\"\n\nRead more: Trump may have committed tax fraud by fabricating a loan to avoid paying income taxes on nearly $50 million\n\nTrump's latest outbursts on the matter came Friday as he railed against the media for fact-checking him on the claim.\n\n\"The Fake News Media was fixated on the fact that I properly said, at the beginnings of Hurricane Dorian, that in addition to Florida & other states, Alabama may also be grazed or hit,\" he tweeted. \"They went Crazy, hoping against hope that I made a mistake (which I didn't). Check out maps.\"\n\nTrump went on to complain that \"this nonsense has never happened to another President. Four days of corrupt reporting, still without an apology. But there are many things that the Fake News Media has not apologized to me for, like the Witch Hunt, or SpyGate! The LameStream Media and their Democrat ... partner should start playing it straight. It would be so much better for our Country!\"\n\nLater Friday, the president posted a misleading video that included a CNN clip from Wednesday, August 28, in which a reporter discussed how the hurricane was threatening several US states, including Alabama. The video then played the reporter saying \"Alabama\" on loop, cut to a clip of Trump nodding, and then to a doctored clip of CNN's logo superimposed onto a moving truck which careened off the road and caught fire.\n\nBut Trump's first tweet about Alabama being in Hurricane Dorian's path came on Saturday, by which time weather forecasters had determined that it was not going to be hit.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump stands in the Oval Office during a presentation of the Presidential Medal of Freedom to NBA Hall of Famer Jerry West at the White House in Washington, U.S., September 5, 2019.

He also showed reporters an altered map of the storm's path on Wednesday to defend his claims, a move that may even be illegal, according to federal law.\n\n\"He's deteriorating in plain sight,\" one Republican strategist who's in frequent contact with the White House told Insider on Friday.\n\nAsked why the president was obsessed with Alabama instead of the states that would actually be affected by the storm, the strategist said, \"you should ask a psychiatrist about that; I'm not sure I'm qualified to comment.\"", "description": "Trump is \"deteriorating in plain sight,\" one Republican strategist who's in frequent contact with the White House told Insider on Friday.", "authors": ["Sonam Sheth"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.QUNS3GKsJsCbaijZS_.lw--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/business_insider_articles_888/595800363b5e8289120084e6d1e66600", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
