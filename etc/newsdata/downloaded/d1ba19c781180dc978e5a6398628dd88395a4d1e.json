Netflix has made another ridiculous Christmas movie starring Vanessa Hudgens, like they could ever top the absolute work of art that is The Princess Switch. In saying that, this new flick sounds like an absolutely hooley dooley of a time, and I can\u2019t wait to watch it. It\u2019s called The Knight Before Christmas.\n\nThe. Knight. Before. Christmas.\n\nThe movie is about a gallant English knight who is magically sent from the medieval era to present day. Bamboozled by the entire thing, the knight sets out to seek his true quest and ends up falling for a caring high school science teacher who is disillusioned by love.\n\nHudgens stars as the disillusioned teacher and Josh Whitehouse, known for his role in the BBC series Poldark, stars as the literal knight in shining armour.\n\nThe first look? It does not disappoint.\n\nVanessa Hudgens and Josh Whitehouse star in the perfectly-titled holiday rom-com, The Knight Before Christmas. She plays a kind science teacher who has been disillusioned by love and he's the cursed medieval knight she must help return to his time \u2014 FIRST LOOK: pic.twitter.com/AHuAPIh7HB \u2014 See What's Next (@seewhatsnext) October 15, 2019\n\nThe Knight Before Christmas comes out November 21.\n\nIn other blessed Netflix / Christmas news, the streaming giant recently dropped our first look at Let It Snow \u2013 a holiday teen romcom based on a book co-written by John Green. It stars The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina whiz Kiernan Shipka as well as a slew of YA actors including Jacob Balton (Spider-Man: Homecoming).\n\nThe GIST: After a once-in-century snowstorm buries the residents of Gracetown under a whole heap of snow on Christmas Eve, a bunch of high school seniors discover unexpected opportunities as well as complications that test their friendships, love lives, and aspirations for the future.\n\nAt the time, all we copped was a very Christmas-y film poster but Netflix just released a video full of snippets from all its upcoming Chrissy content! And it includes a couple of seconds from The Knight Before Christmas and Let It Snow.\n\nStay tuned for all the trailers.", "description": "Netflix has made another Christmas movie starring\u00a0Vanessa Hudgens,\u00a0like they could ever top the absolute work of art that is\u00a0The Princess Switch.", "authors": ["Steffanie Tan"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-16-at-9.19.31-am.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
