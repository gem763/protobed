Many prominent voices led by Trump are pushing the idea that the Ukraine scandal is a hoax in which the intelligence community, the Democrats, and the media are attempting to take a president down because they hate him.\n\nIf Trump gets impeached over what Republicans believe were nonexistent or minor misdeeds, then they are likely to want to jump on any scandal in a Democratic administration to pursue impeachment. And of course, should they take that path, Democrats will not soon forget.\n\nEvery president takes actions that, viewed through a certain lens, can be seen as impeachable. So it isn\u2019t at all hard to imagine our politics evolving to the point in which it\u2019s just a routine assumption that whenever an opposition party takes control of the House, they\u2019ll impeach the sitting president \u2014 almost like the use of the filibuster has increased over time to the point which we assume all legislation will require 60 votes to pass.", "description": "", "authors": ["Philip Klein", "Washingtonexaminer.Com Opinion If-Democrats-Impeach-Trump-A-Gop-House-Would-Probably-Impeach-The-Next-Democratic-President"], "top_image": ""}
