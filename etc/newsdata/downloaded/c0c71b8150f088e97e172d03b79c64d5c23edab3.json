However, it does not expect to exit any major markets in the United States.\n\nLast week, Forever 21 had said it would exit Japan and close all 14 stores at the end of October.\n\nThe company also said its Canadian subsidiary filed for bankruptcy and it plans to wind down the business, closing 44 stores in the country.\n\nForever 21 will continue operations in Mexico and Latin America.\n\nThe company lists both assets and liabilities in the range of $1 billion to $10 billion, according to the court filing in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.\n\nThe retailer said it received $275 million in financing from its existing lenders with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as agent, and $75 million in new capital from TPG Sixth Street Partners, and certain of its affiliated funds.\n\nKirkland & Ellis LLP was serving as the company\u2019s legal adviser, Alvarez & Marsal advised on restructuring, and Lazard acted as its investment banker.\n\n\u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2019", "description": "Since 2017, more than 20 U.S. retailers including Sears and Toys 'R' Us have filed for bankruptcy", "authors": ["Rama"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/forever21.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
