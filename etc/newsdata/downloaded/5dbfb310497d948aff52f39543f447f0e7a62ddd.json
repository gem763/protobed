Baldwin has confessed in the past that he \u201chates\u201d playing Trump on the sketch-comedy show and that he\u2019d regularly sit in his dressing room and think, \u201cI hope a meteor hits this building and kills me because I don\u2019t want to do this ever again.\u201d\n\nWell, SNL honcho Lorne Michaels managed to convince him to don the orange makeup and ridiculous hairpiece again, and here\u2019s how.\n\n\u201cI said to them, and it was not with any malice or any lack of affection for them, I said, \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t want to do that anymore, I don\u2019t want to do the Trump thing again. I\u2019m going to stop.\u2019 And I don\u2019t need to tell you about the Lorne Michaels\u2019 Jedi Mind Trick thing,\u201d said Baldwin.\n\n\u201c[Lorne] gets me on the phone the Friday before the show\u2014the day before the show\u2014and he\u2019s like, \u2018I don\u2019t think you understand,\u2019 and I go, \u2018What don\u2019t I understand? I\u2019ve been thinking about it all summer. Every day I\u2019ve been thinking about it.\u2019 And he said, \u2018I don\u2019t think you understand how important this is,\u2019\u201d recalled Baldwin.\n\nHe still wasn\u2019t convinced. \u201cSo [Lorne] said to me, \u2018You should come and do it\u2014your audience demands it\u2019\u2014or something like that\u2026 So I came, and I did it. And I\u2019m going to do it a few times.\u201d", "description": "The Emmy-winning actor opened up to Jimmy Fallon about how the \u201cSNL\u201d boss talked him into returning as the orange commander-in-chief.", "authors": ["Marlow Stern", "Senior Entertainment Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_562,w_1000,x_0,y_33/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571633911/NUP_188824_0632_jvorwm", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
