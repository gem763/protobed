If passed, the measure represents the most significant reform of the city\u2019s commercial waste industry since a city-led commission began removing organized crime from the industry in the 1990s.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nCouncil Member Antonio Reynoso, chairman of the Committee on Sanitation and Solid Waste, told POLITICO the latest version includes several key changes from the original bill floated earlier this year. It advances what is known as a non-exclusive zoning model \u2014 dividing the city into sections in which a maximum of three waste companies can operate \u2014 and creates incentives to switch to more sustainable vehicles and haul trash to more reputable waste transfer stations. There are also provisions to increase public safety training requirements for sanitation workers and authorize the Department of Sanitation to set a minimum rate waste haulers can charge customers.\n\n\u201cOver the past six years, I have worked closely and diligently with all stakeholders \u2014 environmental, labor, and transportation advocates, business owners, and private carting companies \u2014 to craft a bill that both meets our goals and addresses our City\u2019s waste management needs,\u201d Reynoso said in a statement provided to POLITICO. \u201cI am proud of the resulting piece of legislation and am confident that the system\u2019s implementation will improve the industry for workers while making our city safer and more sustainable for current residents and generations to come.\u201d\n\nThe overall intent of the bill is to end the private waste industry\u2019s current open-market system, where 50 to 90 different carters can service a single neighborhood \u2014 leading many waste trucks to traverse all five boroughs in one night. The long, tiresome routes can take 12 hours to complete and pose serious safety risks for workers and residents. Private carters were involved in 26 fatal crashes between 2010 and the fall of 2018. There are also environmental implications from the continuous vehicle exhaust coming from the trucks.\n\nThe zoning system limits how many waste companies can service parts of the city, reducing congestion and simplifying routes for workers. Waste companies will have to apply to service a single zone, giving the city greater authority to set additional labor and recycling standards.\n\nAlthough the de Blasio administration and City Council have agreed waste reform is needed, they have been at odds over the best way to pursue change.\n\nThe City Council, at the urging of environmental advocates and the Teamsters who represent many of the drivers, had originally pursued an exclusive model where only one waste hauler would service a zone. The argument for exclusive zoning \u2014 which is used by West Coast cities like Los Angeles and San Jose, Calif. \u2014 had been that it would achieve the best results when it came to improving labor, environmental and safety standards.\n\nBut the exclusive zoning mode faced pushback from business groups, most notably the Real Estate Board of New York, which raised concerns over the implications of eliminating competition among carters. The Department of Sanitation, which first floated the notion of exclusive zoning in 2016 eventually proposed a less stringent model and pitched a system where three to five carters would service a single zone.\n\nThe latest draft seeks to strike a compromise key organizations can support \u2014 preserving competition while increasing safety and environmental provisions.\n\nThe draft mandates sanitation workers undergo public safety training, a move aimed at reducing potentially fatal crashes that have plagued the industry\u2019s record.\n\nCompanies will also be more likely to win a contract if they have timelines for reducing truck emissions and agree to use waste transfer stations with a better reputation for sustainable practices. Using transfer stations that have violations from the city, state or federal level will be viewed poorly in the competitive solicitation process.\n\n\u201cThis commercial waste reform agreement was a generation in the making,\" Eddie Bautista, executive director of the New York City Environmental Justice Alliance, said in a statement. \"Environmental justice communities... have sought relief from a chaotic and unjust commercial waste system for 30 years. Substantial progress has been made.\u201d\n\nThe bill also includes a provision that gives the Department of Sanitation the authority to set a \u201crate floor,\u201d or the minimum amount haulers could charge for waste collection.\n\nThe addition is designed to prevent a \u201crace to the bottom\u201d where companies could underpay workers or cut corners in other ways to keep rates artificially low, Reynoso said.\n\n\u201cPrivate sanitation workers and the Transform Don't Trash NYC coalition fought for years to reform the commercial waste system, and today we can see light at the end of the tunnel,\u201d Sean Campbell, President of Teamsters Local 813, said in a statement. \u201cWe negotiated this framework to end the race to the bottom that holds down wages and endangers workers of color. Going forward, companies that provide good jobs will thrive and those that mistreat workers will not.\u201d\n\nThe bill also comes with a provision the Real Estate Board of New York and hospitals had lobbied for \u2014 the option for buildings with roll-off container systems to keep their hauler. There are roughly 500 commercial properties that have such systems and they require specialized equipment and servicing. The bill plans to achieve this by creating three to five citywide contracts for containerized pickup.\n\nReynoso emphasized that the version of the bill being released on Thursday is a draft, providing an opportunity for groups to weigh in on the changes before it\u2019s codified into an updated version that will go for a final vote.\n\nThe bill must be voted out of the Sanitation Committee before it goes before the full Council. A committee hearing hasn\u2019t been scheduled yet, but Reynoso said the Council is working on a timeline to have the bill passed at the Oct. 30 stated meeting.\n\n\u201cWe have been working hard and have made significant progress on this bill because we believe that implementing commercial waste zones will benefit all New Yorkers,\u201d City Council Speaker Corey Johnson said in a statement. \u201cOur goal with this policy is cleaner air, safer streets, and better customer service to businesses throughout the City.\u201d", "description": "The overall intent of the bill is to end the private waste industry\u2019s current open-market system.", "authors": ["Danielle Muoio"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/capny/sites/default/files/a-Antonio%20Reynoso_0.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
