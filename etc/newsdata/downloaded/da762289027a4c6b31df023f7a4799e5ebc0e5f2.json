She aspires to be an astronaut one day!\"\n\nAnother added: \"Last time this was cancelled I cried for days out of disappointment, this really is a huge deal for women and little girls everywhere.\"\n\nAnd one joked: \"Groundbreaking for women...or should I say space shaking?\"", "description": "Astronauts Christina Koch and Jessica Meir are part of NASA\u2019s Expedition 61 Flight, and will begin their spacewalk at 12:50 BST today", "authors": ["Shivali Best", "Image", "Nasa Handout Epa-Efe Rex", "Nasa Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20647141.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Upcoming-first-all-female-spacewalking-duo-Jessica-Meir-and-Christina-Koch-Space-15-Oct-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
