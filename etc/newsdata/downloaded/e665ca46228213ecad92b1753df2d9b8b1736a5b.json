But legal, regulated products used as directed don't seem to be the primary cause.\n\nJuul, for example, neither makes THC vape pods nor intends them to be used in their devices.\n\nWhere it stands: THC is a Schedule 1 drug under federal law., severely restricting scientists' and regulators' ability to study its effects.\n\nBut THC is legal in more than a dozen states, thanks to marijuana legalization efforts.\n\nFew of those states, though, require stringent oversight of THC-specific products such as vape pods.\n\n\"State laws that have loosened access to cannabinoids have come at a public health cost,\" said former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb.\n\n\"Ultimately, a federal regime could make it easier to access cannabis for conducting proper studies ... At the same time, a federal regime should tighten permissive state practices that have made it far too easy for recreational marijuana to gain acceptance and for these compounds to get into the hands of kids,\" he added.\n\nYes, but: At least a few patients afflicted by the lung illness claim to have only vaped nicotine.\n\nAnd research this week from New York University found that vaping nicotine caused lung cancer in mice, per CNBC. The researchers said vaping is likely \u201cvery harmful\u201d to humans as well.\n\nThe bottom line: Traditional vaping gets people hooked on nicotine, and kids and teens have proven particularly vulnerable.
