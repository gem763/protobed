(Andrew Harnik/AP)\n\nStephen Hahn, a top official at MD Anderson Cancer Center, is being considered for the top job at the Food and Drug Administration, according to people familiar with the discussions.\n\nHahn, a radiation oncologist and researcher, met with President Trump on Wednesday to discuss being nominated as commissioner of the agency.\n\nAn administration official said that Trump has not made a decision on the FDA job, but that Hahn \u201cis a strong candidate.\u201d He has emerged as the chief rival to Norman E. \u201cNed\u201d Sharpless, who was tapped as acting FDA chief after Commissioner Scott Gottlieb resigned in March. Sharpless previously was director of the National Cancer Institute and the UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center in Chapel Hill, N.C. He can serve as acting commissioner only until Nov. 1.\n\nThe administration also has considered a third candidate, Alexa Boer Kimball, a Harvard dermatology professor and president and chief executive of the Harvard Medical Faculty Physicians at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.\n\nBeing commissioner of the FDA \u2014 an agency with sprawling responsibilities that include food safety, drug approvals and tobacco regulation \u2014 has long been a tough job. But the post is especially challenging now amid pressing concerns about high drug prices, the explosion of youth vaping and medical-device safety.\n\nHahn is chief medical executive at MD Anderson in Houston, and is responsible for overseeing patient care. He worked at the NCI from the late 1980s until the mid-1990s, at one point in the prostate-cancer clinic, before moving to the University of Pennsylvania and eventually becoming chairman of the radiation oncology department. After almost two decades at Penn, he joined MD Anderson, and three years later, in 2017, became chief operating officer during a tumultuous time that culminated in the resignation of then-President Ronald DePinho.\n\nJustin Bekelman, a Penn radiation oncologist who worked for Hahn, described him as \u201ca terrific leader and a first-rate person who puts patients first.\u201d He also said Hahn was \u201can impeccable researcher,\u201d whose clinical trial work has included innovative therapies combining immunotherapy and radiation.\n\nThe MD Anderson website describes Hahn as having expertise in lung cancer and sarcoma, an uncommon group of cancers that arise in the bones and connective tissue. It adds that his research \u201cfocuses on the molecular causes of the tumor microenvironment, particularly the study of chemical signals that go awry.\"\n\nSharpless also has strong supporters to become the permanent FDA head. Earlier this week, dozens of cancer groups and four previous FDA commissioners endorsed him, calling on Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar to quickly nominate him.\n\nThe former commissioners\u2019 letter said Sharpless \u201chas gained the respect of the agency staff and a broad spectrum of the public in support of the FDA\u2019s mission.\u201d It was signed by Mark McClellan and Andrew von Eschenbach, who led the agency during the George W. Bush administration, and Robert Califf and Margaret Hamburg, who served during the Obama administration.\n\nGottlieb has also said he supports Sharpless\u2019s nomination and confirmation. Sharpless supporters say it would be disruptive to install yet another FDA chief and stress his research and drug-development credentials.\n\nIn June, in a live \u201cChasing Cancer\u201d event at The Washington Post, Sharpless said he was committed to speeding drug discovery and lowering costs, in part by harnessing big data.\n\nHe also said he would like to be nominated to be permanent commissioner. \u201cYou know, I learned all the acronyms, right?\u201d he said. He called the agency \u201ca great place to be involved with,\u201d but added that the White House would decide who got the nod for the top job.\n\nIn an email Thursday, Hahn declined to comment. The FDA also declined to comment.\n\nAshley Parker contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nFormer agency heads, health groups push for FDA\u2019s Sharpless to be permanent commissioner\n\nAs vaping-related lung illnesses spike, investigators eye contaminants\n\nWhite House races to come up with health-care wins for Trump\u2019s campaign", "description": "Stephen Hahn, a radiation oncologist and senior official at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, is in the running to be nominated by President Trump for the top FDA job.", "authors": ["Laurie Mcginley", "Reporter Covering Health", "September At Pm", "Laurie Mcginley Covers Health", "Medicine For The Washington Post.
