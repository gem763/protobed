The onslaught of wind, rain, and storm surge inundated roads, destroyed homes, and claimed at least five lives.\n\nDorian was moving toward the Florida coast as of Tuesday afternoon, and its effects are expected to hit Georgia and South Carolina in the coming days as well. Though the hurricane's winds are growing weaker, the storm has become larger, which could increase the risk of flooding in coastal areas.\n\nDuring storms like Dorian, homes made of durable, wind-resistant materials enjoy an added layer of protection.\n\nRecently, the Canadian construction firm JD Composites found a way to build hurricane-resistant walls out of recycled plastic. The company's 2,000-square-foot home features walls made of 600,000 plastic soda bottles, which were shredded, melted, and molded into a material that can withstand a Category 5 storm.\n\nTake a look inside the sleek structure.", "description": "Hurricanes are becoming stronger and more devastating, generating a need for technologies to keep homes safe during storms.", "authors": ["Aria Bendix"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d2cc5bfa17d6c320931a227-1920-960.jpg"}
