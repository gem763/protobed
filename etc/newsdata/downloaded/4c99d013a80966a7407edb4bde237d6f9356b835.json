It's probably the first Nobel for purely theoretical cosmology, instead of something observed, noted CalTech physicist Sean Carroll.\n\nLoading\n\nPeebles, hailed as one of the most influential cosmologists of his time, who realised the importance of the cosmic radiation background born of the Big Bang, will collect one half of the 9-million kronor ($1.3 million) cash award.\n\n\"Much of it will go to charity,\" Peebles told colleagues at a Princeton news conference. Then after a pause, he changed that to \"Some of it will go to charity. Some of it will go to our children.\"\n\nMayor, who is an astrophysicist, and Queloz, an astronomer who is also at the University of Cambridge in Britain, will share the other half. Their finding of the first planet outside our solar system circling a star like our own made astronomers look harder for life elsewhere in the universe.\n\n\"Maybe we can discover some form of life. We don't know what kind of form,\" Mayor said Tuesday as he arrived in Madrid for a scientific speaking engagement. He said scientists \"are absolutely certain that a lot of these planets have good conditions for life\".\n\nOver 4000 exoplanets\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMayor and Queloz started a revolution in astronomy when they discovered 51 Pegasi B, a gaseous ball comparable with Jupiter, in 1995 - a time when, as Mayor recalled, \"no one knew whether exoplanets existed or not.\"\n\nThat was \"the first step in our search for, 'Are we alone?\"' said astronomer Lisa Kaltenegger, director of the Carl Sagan Institute at Cornell University.\n\nMore than 4000 exoplanets have since been found in the Milky Way, and scientists think one out of every four or five stars have planets. \"We have 200 billion stars out there in our galaxy alone, so I like our chances,\" Kaltenegger said.\n\nQueloz was meeting Tuesday with other academics interested in finding new planets when the press office at Cambridge University interrupted to tell him the big news: He had won the Nobel. He thought it was joke at first.\n\n\"I could barely breathe,\" Queloz told The Associated Press. \"It's enormous. It's beyond usual emotions. My hand was shaking for a long time. I'm trying to digest it.\"\n\nSwiss scientist Michael Mayor. AP\n\nGeoff Marcy, who headed one of the teams that rivaled Mayor and Queloz, praised their work. In the 1990s \"we were all trying to carry a search for planets without ever thinking we would succeed,\" Marcy said. \"None of us imagined even finding one, never mind the thousands we found.\"\n\nMarcy, who left the University of California Berkeley after accusations of sexual harassment, said he didn't know if he would have shared in the prize if it weren't for the scandal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSwedish academy member Mats Larsson said this year's was \"one of the easiest physics prizes for a long time to explain.\"\n\nThe Big Bang Theory\n\nThat can't quite be said for Peebles' theoretical work.\n\n\"Jim Peebles absolutely was one of the leaders in trying to understand how did we get here, the nature of cosmology, the nature of the universe at large,\" said astronomer Dimitar Sasselov, director of Harvard University's Origins of Life Initiative.\n\nJames Peebles has been hailed as one of the most influential cosmologists of his time. AP\n\nPeebles' work, which began in the mid-1960s, set the stage for a \"transformation\" of cosmology over the last half-century, using theoretical tools and calculations that helped interpret traces from the infancy of the universe, the Nobel committee said.\n\nA clearly delighted Peebles giggled repeatedly during a phone interview with AP, recalling how he answered a 5:30am phone call from Stockholm thinking that \"it's either something very wonderful or it's something horrible\".\n\nThe astrophysicist, who said his life had suddenly turned topsy-turvy, will make sure he picks up his prize.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I've always loved Bob Dylan,\" he said, referring to the singer-songwriter who won the literature prize in 2016 but refused to participate in the Nobel ceremony. \"I can't forgive him for not showing up to the scene of (his) Nobel prize.\"\n\nAnd in a case of life imitating art, Tuesday's Nobel Prize announcement included the opening lyrics of The Big Bang Theory theme song: \"Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state, then nearly 14 billion years ago, expansion started.\"\n\nThe sitcom was a \"fantastic achievement\" that brought the \"world of science to laptops and living rooms around the world,\" said Goran Hansson, secretary general of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. So referencing its theme song seemed fitting, he said.\n\nThe cash prize comes with a gold medal and a diploma that are received at an elegant ceremony in Stockholm on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death of prize founder Alfred Nobel in 1896, together with the winners of five other Nobel prizes. The sixth one, the peace prize, is handed out in Oslo, Norway, on the same day.\n\nOn Monday, Americans William G. Kaelin Jr. and Gregg L. Semenza and Britain's Peter J. Ratcliffe won the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine, for discovering details of how the body's cells sense and react to low oxygen levels, providing a foothold for developing new treatments for anaemia, cancer and other diseases.\n\nNobel, a Swedish industrialist and the inventor of dynamite, decided the physics, chemistry, medicine and literature prizes should be awarded in Stockholm, and the peace prize in Oslo.\n\nAAP", "description": "A Canadian-American cosmologist and two Swiss scientists won this year's Nobel Prize in Physics for exploring the evolution of the universe.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2958%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_108/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/630c03b2fd3f99823e11fdeb16e2b5df71c9723a", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
