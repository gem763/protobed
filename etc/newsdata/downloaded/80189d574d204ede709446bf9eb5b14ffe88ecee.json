As Trump awaited Sissi at the event, he reportedly jokingly called out, \u201cWhere\u2019s my favorite dictator?\u201d (Andrew Harnik/AP)\n\nPresident Trump has used it with groups and individuals. He has used it for family members and employees. And he has bestowed it on Washington politicians and middle-of-the-country farmers.\n\nFor Trump, the possessive pronoun \u201cmy\u201d is a term of endearment \u2014 one he dispenses with freely, from \u201cmy generals\u201d to \u201cmy Peter\u201d Navarro, one of the president\u2019s senior economic advisers, to \u201cmy little Melania,\u201d his wife.\n\nTrump uses the pronoun affectionately, part of an almost subconscious effort to shine warmth on someone in his orbit, say current and former aides, who describe the linguistic tic as a doting gesture. But others say the habit can also seem belittling and, for Trump, that it may be as much about dominance and control as familiarity.\n\nTim O\u2019Brien, a Trump biographer who is critical of the president, said that while he has never heard the president use the phrase dismissively \u2014 \u201che always uses it to convey you\u2019re part of the home team,\u201d O\u2019Brien said \u2014 the practical reality is more complicated.\n\n\u201cHe thinks he\u2019s conveying a compliment to the people he says it about, but in fact, it\u2019s not really about putting them on equal footing,\u201d said O\u2019Brien, executive editor of Bloomberg Opinion. \u201cI read anytime President Trump starts a statement with \u2018my\u2019 that it\u2019s completely in the possessive, and it\u2019s about ownership, and it\u2019s about control.\u201d\n\nAnd with Trump, O\u2019Brien added, the modifier provides only minute-to-minute reassurance. \u201cYou can go from being \u2018my\u2019 to being gone in a tweet that goes out in 15 seconds,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president\u2019s preferred possessive was in the spotlight most recently on Friday, when the Wall Street Journal reported that as Trump awaited Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi at the Group of Seven summit last month in France, he jokingly called out, \u201cWhere\u2019s my favorite dictator?\u201d\n\nIn response, Maggie Haberman, a New York Times reporter who covers the White House, tweeted a \u201cpartial list of people the president has recently referred to as \u2018my,\u2019 \u201d including Sissi, senior policy adviser Stephen Miller, an unnamed reporter and an unidentified African American man at one of his campaign rallies.\n\nIndeed, Trump deploys \u201cmy\u201d widely and frequently. Just before his January 2017 inauguration, the president-elect gazed across a ballroom during a celebratory lunch at the Trump International Hotel and used the diminutive for then-House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) \u2014 a pet name that was viewed as verbal evidence of the two men\u2019s strong political relationship.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Kevin,\u201d Trump asked. \u201cThere\u2019s my Kevin.\u201d\n\nMore recently, recounting a congressional softball game where Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.), playing second base, fielded a \u201csmash groundball\u201d and threw it to first, Trump extolled Scalise and referred to him warmly as \u201cmy Steve.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho could have that but my Steve, right,\u201d Trump said, speaking before the American Farm Bureau in New Orleans earlier this year.\n\nTrump also refers to \u201cmy farmers\u201d with some regularity. Speaking in the Roosevelt Room in May in solidarity with the nation\u2019s farmers and ranchers, the president was clear in his support: \u201cI have to take care of my farmers with disaster relief,\u201d he said.\n\nA month earlier, at a rally in Michigan, Trump urged the nation\u2019s farmers to hold tough in his trade wars with China and the European Union, saying, \u201cThere may be a little pain for a little while, but ultimately for my farmers, I love my farmers.\u201d\n\nSam Nunberg, a former Trump 2016 campaign aide, said that during his time in Trump\u2019s employ, the habit felt purely affectionate. \u201cOccasionally he\u2019d be like, \u2018Oh, my Sam! How\u2019s my Sam doing? What\u2019s my Sam up to?\u2019 \u201d\n\nWith business relationships, Nunberg added, proclaiming faux ownership over an individual is, to Trump, simply a form of flattery. \u201cHe\u2019s very good at making people feel as if they\u2019re the center of the universe, and that\u2019s part of his charm,\u201d he said.\n\nYet the president\u2019s use of the possessive pronoun can also go awry, as it ultimately did after Trump, spotting Gregory Cheadle, who is black, at a 2016 campaign rally California, shouted him out fondly, though not by name.\n\n\u201cOh, look at my African American over here!\u201d Trump said, pointing at Cheadle, who at the time was a Republican who had unsuccessfully run for Congress. \u201cLook at him! Are you the greatest?\u201d\n\nBut last week, Cheadle announced he was leaving the Republican Party, in large part because of the behavior of the president, who Cheadle said has \u201ca white superiority complex.\u201d When asked last week about Cheadle, who is now running for a House seat as an independent, Trump said he didn\u2019t know who he was.\n\nTrump also regularly refers to \u201cmy generals\u201d and \u201cmy military,\u201d seeming to assert a type of ownership over the nation\u2019s civilian defense institutions that has irked some in the U.S. military community.\n\nAnn Burnette, a professor of communication studies and presidential rhetoric at Texas State University, said that in some ways, Trump falls into a long tradition of many of his predecessors.\n\n\u201cPresidents often use pronouns to signal identification with an audience, so they\u2019ll often use pronouns like \u2018we\u2019 or \u2018our\u2019 to signal that closeness,\u201d Burnette said. \u201cSo when a president uses a personal possessive pronoun, that communicates intimacy, and sometimes that can be effective.\u201d\n\nProblems can arise, however, when that intimacy is either inappropriate or presumptuous, Burnette said. Proclaiming Sissi \u201cmy favorite dictator,\u201d for instance, struck many as inappropriate.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to hear a president talk about his intimacy with or admiration for a dictator,\u201d she said. And, she added, \u201cWhen he says \u2018my African American,\u2019 that presumes the person he\u2019s talking about feels the same closeness, and that might not be the case. Same with \u2018my farmers\u2019 \u2014 some farmers might feel that closeness, but some might not.\u201d\n\nTrump has also referred to \u201cmy base\u201d in almost paternalistic terms, such as last month when, shortly before boarding Marine One, he was asked by reporters whether his base supported background checks for gun purchases.\n\n\u201cI think my base relies very much on common sense, and they rely on me, in terms of telling them what\u2019s happening,\u201d the president said.\n\nTrump has previously described first lady Melania Trump as \u201cmy little Melania,\u201d including, according to the New York Post, during their lavish Palm Beach, Fla., wedding ceremony in 2005.\n\nMore recently, the president has introduced some members of his Cabinet as \u201cmy secretaries,\u201d and, according to Factba.se, an online database that collects all of Trump\u2019s rhetoric, has referred to \u201cmy people\u201d more than 250 times. For the president, \u201cmy people\u201d seems to be an anonymous and amorphous group that includes, but is not necessarily limited to, his base, his top advisers, his campaign and, simply, his pals whom he sometimes consults.\n\nTrump associates generally say a playful \u201cmy\u201d is a descriptor to be savored, not spurned. Nunberg, who was ultimately fired from the 2016 Trump campaign, said that as his relationship with Trump grew more tense, his boss bestowed \u201cmy Sam\u201d upon him with less frequency.\n\n\u201cHe may genuinely feel affection at that moment, too, because in my experience, when I was on the outs and being pushed aside, I got less and less of those,\u201d Nunberg said.\n\nToluse Olorunnipa contributed to this report.", "description": "His reported referral to Egypt\u2019s Abdel Fatah al-Sissi as \u201cmy favorite dictator\u201d provided the latest example of one of the president\u2019s most common rhetorical tics.", "authors": ["Ashley Parker", "White House Reporter", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/4myU7HRMudn1azJAXJLTHec_bq8=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/F34YEBWYZQI6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
