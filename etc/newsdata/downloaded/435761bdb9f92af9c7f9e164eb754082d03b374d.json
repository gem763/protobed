Currently, the national insurance benefits system recognises only marriage and civil partnership but not cohabitation. That means cohabiting couples can miss out on state help if one of them dies under pension age.\n\nFor those whose partners die today, the combination of the bereavement support payment and widowed parent\u2019s allowance is worth up to \u00a311,608.20 for the first 18 months \u2013 a substantial sum of money for people who are struggling to cope with a life-changing event and trying to get back on their feet.\n\nThe new rules will also pave the way for couples to inherit pension benefits in occupational pension schemes where provision for cohabiting couples has not yet been equalised and they\u2019ll gain access to inheritance tax breaks for married couples, including the ability to pass on money to a partner free of inheritance tax.\n\n\u201cIt is very good news that the government has responded to the recent court judgment by pressing ahead with legislation to allow all couples to register a civil partnership,\u201d Steve Webb, director of policy at Royal London, said.\n\n\u201cCouples who live together have been second class citizens for far too long when it comes to their treatment by the tax and benefit system. Registering for a civil partnership will bring access to a range of help from the tax and benefit system, and millions of couples will want to think if this is the right thing for them to do.\u201d\n\nBut a civil partnership is still a big step for a couple to consider \u2013 one that feels like an archaic piece of bureaucracy against the backdrop of life today.\n\nThere\u2019s a persistent sense that such changes are simply bending a fundamentally out-of-date system to cope with each glaring inequality that arises on a piecemeal basis.\n\n\u201cIn general policymakers need to ensure their taxes and policies are fit for the modern-day as even relatively new taxes are steeped in history,\u201d adds Griffin.\n\n\u201cFor instance, the residence nil rate band is only transferable to a spouse or civil partner and the same is true of the transferable nil rate band.\n\n\u201cThe system clearly needs a rethink and a different way of determining when the taxes and benefits apply.\u201d", "description": "Proposals launched this week could make a huge difference to the finances of cohabiting couples as part of government plans to give unmarried heterosexual couples the right to register a civil partnership.
