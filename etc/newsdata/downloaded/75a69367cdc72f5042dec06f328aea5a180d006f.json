He was very confident even as a young boy.\n\n\u201cThere were some great players at City and he was up right up there with them.\u201d\n\nKosovo first applied for Fifa membership in May 2008 following the ravages of war and the declaration of independence from Serbia.\n\nBut Kosovo would not play its first Fifa-sanctioned international friendly until March 2014 \u2013 a goalless draw with Haiti when a 17-year-old Celina sat on the bench.\n\nKosovo eventually became Fifa members two years later but did not win a game in 2018 World Cup qualifying, losing nine of their 10 matches and only scoring three goals in the process.\n\nBut Kosovo, who have climbed 70 places from their original Fifa ranking of 190, can now claim to be Europe\u2019s form team on the back of a 15-game unbeaten run.\n\nThey beat the Czech Republic 2-1 on Saturday to move into second place in Group A of Euro 2020 qualifying, one point behind England.\n\n\u201cThis is definitely the biggest game in our history,\u201d Celina said of the St Mary\u2019s qualifier. \u201cEveryone is looking forward to it in Kosovo, because playing against England is one of the biggest things you can do in football.\n\n\u201cWe are playing an unbelievable side, but we have some talented players.\n\n\u201cI think England will win the group, but there\u2019s a big chance for us and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll try to do.\n\nCelina, who celebrates his 23rd birthday on Monday, was just 18 months old when the Kosovo War broke out in 1998.\n\nIt has been estimated that over 13,000 were killed in the conflict and around one million Kosovo Albanians fled the region.\n\nThe Celina family had lived some 20 miles from the Albanian border in the historic town of Prizren, but with the area heavily affected by the war moved to Drammen in Norway.\n\n\u201cThe country has been through a lot and we are a proud nation,\u201d said Celina, who represented Norway at age-grade level before switching allegiance to Kosovo.\n\n\u201cWe feel we are doing it for our country, something that is so important.\n\n\u201cEveryone is very passionate in Kosovo \u2013 every person, every family, the whole country. We know that everyone will be watching the England game back home.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Bersant Celina hopes to be reunited with Jadon Sancho on the international stage after recognising that his former Manchester City team-mate was destined for stardom as a 14-year-old.", "authors": ["Phil Blanche"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/09/11/bersant-celina.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
