Sign up here.\n\nThe botched and bloody Mexican operation to capture one of El Chapo\u2019s sons Thursday puts the international spotlight on the drug kingpin\u2019s grown children, who\u2019ve taken on key roles in the Sinaloa Cartel since their father\u2019s been behind bars.\n\nCuliac\u00e1n, a stronghold of the cartel, broke out in violence Thursday as Mexican authorities captured 28-year-old Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez \u2014 who\u2019s wanted in both Mexico and the United States \u2014 and then released him amid a full-scale shootout with cartel members in broad daylight that left cars burning and civilians running for cover.\n\nThe local cops reportedly stumbled upon Ovidio at a Culiac\u00e1n house and moved in to try to capture him without military support, and were ill-prepared for the firefight that ensued, said Mexico\u2019s top army general. Another of Chapo\u2019s sons, Iv\u00e1n Archivaldo Guzm\u00e1n, was also rumored to have been captured and released, but his situation remains unconfirmed amid the chaos.\n\nOvidio and Ivan are just two of Chapo\u2019s sons, known collectively as \u201cLos Chapitos\u201d \u2014 or \u201cLos Menores,\u201d The Minors \u2014 who\u2019ve become targets for U.S. and Mexican authorities. The Department of Justice charged Ovidio and Joaqu\u00edn Guzman L\u00f3pez with drug trafficking in February and have been trying to track them down ever since.\n\nEl Chapo has a lot of sons: The official count is 15, but up to 24 people are rumored to be his offspring. Most of them aren't in the cartel business, but at least four are said to be key players \u2014 and they\u2019ve been continuously staving off challenges to their power since their dad\u2019s imprisonment. They\u2019re thought to control the local drug trade in Culiac\u00e1n, Mazatl\u00e1n, Guam\u00fachil, and other Sinaloan cities, and they use groups of gunmen, notably one called \u201cLos Demonios,\u201d or the Demons, to enforce their rule.\n\nStill, the top dog in the cartel remains Ismael \u201cEl Mayo\u201d Zambada Garc\u00eda, who ran it in partnership with Chapo.\n\n\u201cWhen Chapo Guzm\u00e1n was extradited to the U.S., the Chaptios wanted to manage the Sinaloa Cartel, but they were prevented from doing so by Ismael \u2018El Mayo\u2019 Zambada because he knew that the cartel would be decimated,\u201d Mike Vigil, the former chief of International Operations for the Drug Enforcement Administration, told VICE News.\n\n\u201cG\u00fazman\u2019s sons have never gotten their hands dirty. They were very good at spending their father\u2019s money buying luxurious cars, gold-plated AK-47s, running around with girlfriends,\u201d he added. \u201cThey don\u2019t really have the respect of the rank-and-file of the Sinaloa Cartel.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about Los Chapitos.\n\nOvidio Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez\n\nNicknamed \u201cEl Rat\u00f3n\u201d (the mouse), the child of Chapo\u2019s second marriage is at the center of the Culiac\u00e1n mayhem, reportedly captured by authorities. He\u2019s been wanted for years.\n\nAfter the cartel opened fire on authorities in the streets, the Mexican government deemed the threat of violence to civilians too high. And they let him go.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department designated him and his brother Iv\u00e1n as key lieutenants in the Sinaloa cartel. He\u2019s wanted by the U.S. on drug trafficking charges issued in February.\n\nIv\u00e1n Archivaldo Guzm\u00e1n\n\nHe\u2019s El Chapo\u2019s eldest son at 39 years old, a key Chapito who\u2019s reportedly been trying to wrest power from former Sinaloa Cartel leaders, some of whom are now the Chapitos\u2019 rivals.\n\nThere were conflicting reports Friday about whether he\u2019d been captured in the raid that ensnared brother Ovidio.\n\nIvan and another brother, Alfredo, were briefly taken hostage by the rival Jalisco New Generation cartel while their dad was still running the show from prison in 2016.\n\nJes\u00fas Alfredo Guzm\u00e1n Salazar\n\nGenerally referred to as Alfredo or \u201cAlfredillo,\u201d he\u2019s on the Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s most wanted list, the only one of Chapo\u2019s kids to have that distinction.\n\nHe\u2019s believed to be running parts of the cartel with brother Iv\u00e1n. And he\u2019s not doing it humbly.\n\nAfredo\u2019s become known for his lavish lifestyle, which he flaunts without reservation on social media, despite being one of the DEA\u2019s most wanted. He was reportedly partying a lot rather than taking his drug trafficking job seriously while being groomed to take a leadership role in the cartel when he was kidnapped by the Jalisco New Generation cartel in 2016 with Iv\u00e1n.\n\nJoaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez\n\nLittle is known about Joaqu\u00edn. He\u2019s kept a relatively low profile compared to his brothers, but he does appear to be directly involved in cartel operations.\n\nThe Department of Justice charged him, along with Iv\u00e1n, with drug trafficking back in February.\n\nKeegan Hamilton contributed reporting.\n\nCover: G21061234.JPG M\u00c9XICO, D.F., Detention/Detenci\u00f3n-Guzm\u00e1n Salazar.- La Secretar\u00eda de Marina Armada de M\u00e9xico present\u00f3 a Jes\u00fas Alfredo Guzm\u00e1n Salazar, presunto hijo de Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n.
