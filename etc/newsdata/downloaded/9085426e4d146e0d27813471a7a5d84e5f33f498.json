Pierre Delecto\u2019s 10 tweets since 2011 offered mild criticisms of Donald Trump and polite defenses of \u2026 Mitt Romney. The account also \u201cliked\u201d content tweeted out by Romney\u2019s kids.\n\nThe campily incognito flavor of the Twitter handle falls somewhere in the middle of nicknames past political figures have chosen for online exploits of radically various intent.\n\nTo weigh in on Twitter in the early days of the Robert Mueller investigation, former FBI director James Comey called himself \u201cReinhold Niebuhr\u201d, after an intellectual hero.\n\nFormer US representative and candidate for New York mayor Anthony Weiner used the nickname \u201cCarlos Danger\u201d to exchange explicit messages with young women.
