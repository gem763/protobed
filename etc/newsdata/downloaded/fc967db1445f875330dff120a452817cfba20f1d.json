What kind of leverage the Chinese government could exert over the operators here in the United States if they want information about how we\u2019re doing business, how we live our lives,\u201d Pai added.\n\nPai\u2019s comments allude to recent comments by European Union officials who warned of \u201csecurity challenges\u201d if tech companies controlled by China or other dictatorial countries are allowed to control significant segments of the world\u2019s communications networks.\n\nThe EU warned that some of these state-backed companies would exploit secret backdoors to user data. The 33-page report warns, \u201cthe likelihood of the supplier being subject to interference from a non-EU country\u2026[and that] such interference may be facilitated [by the]\u2026the third country\u2019s legislation, especially where there are no legislative or democratic checks and balances in place.\u201d\n\nPai noted that all this is a threat that the American people should not ignore and will not want to live with and that he would make sure it didn\u2019t happen while he leads the FCC.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.", "description": "Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai, played off the NBA's kowtowing to China controversy to warn about allowing the communist", "authors": ["Warner Todd Huston"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Chinese-police-patrol-in-Tiananmen-square-10-17-getty-640x480-640x480-1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
