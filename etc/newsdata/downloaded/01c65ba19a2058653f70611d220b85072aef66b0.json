Here's how you can help out with rescue, relief and recovery efforts in the Bahamas \u2014 stay safe this weekend. The Post staff is closely monitoring Hurricane Dorian's path into the Carolinas. See you (and Congress) on Monday.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Marianne Williamson. (Lucas Jackson/Reuters)\n\nThe Campaign\n\nMARIANNE UNFILTERED: Marianne Williamson deleted the tweet. But she's not happy about it.\n\nThe Democratic presidential candidate wants to be taken seriously and not always literally. But she's learning that's an even tougher challenge as a spiritualist and New Age guru in the age of Twitter. Her suggestion this week that the masses could use prayer, visualization and meditation to change Hurricane Dorian's course caused a firestorm.\n\nBut the candidate who is campaigning on the \u201cpolitics of love\u201d is now blaming an increasingly secular left for demonizing her spiritual rhetoric. Williamson tells Power Up the backlash to her tweet about this \"creative use of the power of the mind\" \u2014 and to her out-of-the-box, psychic campaign-isms more broadly \u2014 is the fault of elitist Democrats, liberal condesension and even \"corporatist dominance.\"\n\n\u201cPeople don't like to feel that their values are invalidated and people can feel when they're being condescended to,\u201d Williamson told Power Up. \u201cI was in South Carolina last weekend and Georgia. And you better believe that there were people there praying that the hurricane would turn around \u2014 that doesn't mean that they're stupid. That doesn't mean that they don't believe in science or climate change. The fact that you pray, the fact that you visualize, the fact that you meditate, doesn't mean you're stupid, or ignorant or uninformed.\u201d\n\nWilliamson told Power Up. \u201cI was in South Carolina last weekend and Georgia. And you better believe that there were people there praying that the hurricane would turn around \u2014 that doesn't mean that they're stupid. That doesn't mean that they don't believe in science or climate change. She blasts changing attitudes on the left: \u201cThere had been many within the Democratic Party who have tilted in a strangely, what I perceive to be, an overly secularized conversation,\u201d Williamson said.\n\n\u201cThere had been many within the Democratic Party who have tilted in a strangely, what I perceive to be, an overly secularized conversation,\u201d Williamson said. Williamson says the \u201cpatronizing\u201d attitudes toward people of faith are \u201cheartbreaking\u201d: \u201cI'm a Democrat, I'm a progressive because of my spiritual values. I often say: the Republicans have the elitist policies but an oddly more egalitarian relationship to its own constituency. The Democrats have the more egalitarian policies but an oddly more elitist relationship to its constituency.\u201d\n\nWilliamson gave her unvarnished views on a variety of topics in a wide-ranging interview with Power Up while waiting for her flight to New Hampshire for this weekend's Democratic state convention. Here are some other highlights.\n\nOn the need for a U.S. Department of Peace to \u201cpromote a culture of peace both at home and abroad\u201d \u2014 especially in the wake of mass shootings that killed 53 people in August alone: \u201cPeace builders should not be seen as peripheral\u201d to the military, Williamson argues. \u201cThey should be equals at the table.\u201d\n\nDark psychotic forces are a national security risk: \u201cI see large groups of desperate people as a national security risk. Because desperate people do desperate things. Desperate people are also more vulnerable to ideological capture by genuinely psychotic forces.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see large groups of desperate people as a national security risk. Because desperate people do desperate things. 'Healing the world': \u201cSo we need to apply, in a much more potent way, the same kind of preventive measures when it comes to healing the world that we now recognize as important in healing the body. There is preventive health, there is exercise, there is nutrition, there are all kinds of ways that you cultivate your health. And we need to have that same kind of perspective so that we can cultivate peace.\u201d\n\nOn what she meant when she warned at the debates that President Trump himself was emboldening a \u201cdark psychic force\u201d:\n\n\u201cWhen you see people marching through the streets of Charlottesville shouting 'Jews shall not replace us,' you are witnessing a phenomenon that goes beyond the rational. It is more than irrational. When you look at the power of collectivized hatred, you are witnessing an emotional force that rational argument and intellectual analysis alone cannot counter. And whether it is Nazis or other white supremacists or terrorists of any kind \u2014 anyone who thinks that traditional political strategy alone is enough to override that, is either very naive or deeply uninformed.\u201d\n\nShe's hopeful some Trump voters will defect in 2020 (and declines to call the president a white supremacist as some other candidates have):\n\n\u201cHe has clearly given comfort to white supremacists. That's undeniable. But in terms of what he is \u2014 I don't want to comment on how other candidates choose to run their campaigns,\u201d Williamson said.\n\nThe label is not the best way to win over Trump voters, she says: \u201cThere are many people who voted for Trump, who might be open to voting for us next time. But if we just make them feel guilty for the choice they made. That's not the way to compel them to vote for us. That's shaming them. That's not the path I'm taking.\u201d\n\nWhat she'll be doing on next week's Democratic primary debate night \u2014 for which she did not qualify:\n\nCounterprogramming: \u201cI'm doing my own live stream immediately. I will be live in Los Angeles and live-streaming my own presentation right after the debate \u2026 I want to be respectful of people who are in the debate. I don't want to be taking attention away from the debate. I think I will probably save my commentary for right after the debate is over.\u201d\n\nWilliamson, who met the donor threshold but not the heightened polling requirement, is irked she's forced to sit this one out:\n\nPaging the Democratic National Committee: \u201cI think it's been very healthy that there have been so many candidates. I think it's been healthy for democracy. And that's why I'm sorry to see the DNC shutting down the conversation so fast. I would prefer it to go on.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it's been very healthy that there have been so many candidates. I think it's been healthy for democracy. And that's why I'm sorry to see the DNC shutting down the conversation so fast. I would prefer it to go on.\u201d Voters need time to consider their options, she says: \u201cI'll tell you what's frightening and chilling: it's to consider what will happen if that man [Trump] gets four more years. The last thing we should be doing is rushing through the process of trying to figure out what it will take to defeat him. We should all be thinking about this so deeply and with so much reflection. The last thing it should be is rushed through.\u201d\n\nShe insisted that candidates singularly focused on policy plans are just planning to fail in November:\n\nIt's not a plan competition, she says: The conversation needs to go beyond \u201cnot just who has the biggest plan, but who has the best of the greatest ability to harness the excitement, the enthusiasm and the inspiration of the American people in such a way as to override the anti-democratic forces that confront us.\u201d\n\nThe conversation needs to go beyond \u201cnot just who has the biggest plan, but who has the best of the greatest ability to harness the excitement, the enthusiasm and the inspiration of the American people in such a way as to override the anti-democratic forces that confront us.\u201d Motivation matters: \u201cOne day, I heard someone say almost derisively that \u2026 I know how to motivate and inspire people. And I thought to myself, you might want to think about that.\u201d\n\nTo Mr. or Mrs. Wing Ding, Americans are not too \u201cemotionally constipated\u201d to buy into her message of love in politics, Williamson insists:\n\nHer rebuke to the anonymous candidate quoted in a recent New York Times profile: \u201cThe American people are not stupid and no, the American people are not emotionally constipated. The American people, if you speak to them, like adults, and you are real with them, then it's amazing how much intelligence there is to harness.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe American people are not stupid and no, the American people are not emotionally constipated. The American people, if you speak to them, like adults, and you are real with them, then it's amazing how much intelligence there is to harness.\u201d A call to action: \u201cThat's what a president should be \u2014 someone who is honest with people about what's actually happening and calling people to the task that faces us, the challenges that faces us, to rise to the occasion and to change what needs to be changed and atone for what needs to be atoned for and make amends for what we need to make amends for in one aberational chapter of American history and do what it takes to make a new one. That's what the abolitionists did. That's what the women suffragists did. That's what the civil rights movement did. In all of those cases, the conventional political establishment of the time did not repair itself. What first happened was that the people rose up and the people stepped in. And the conventional political establishment, the political status quo today similarly is not going to repair itself.\u201d\n\nOn Trump's Sharpie-gate:\n\n\u201cI don't presume to be able to analyze what is going on inside the president's mind. I just know how important it is to make him irrelevant as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nYou are reading the Power Up newsletter.
