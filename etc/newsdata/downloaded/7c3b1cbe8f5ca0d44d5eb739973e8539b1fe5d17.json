He appeared to indicate that what he had done was not serious and nothing to be bothered about.\n\n\u2018He denied trying to sit on her and said that if his behaviour was sexual harassment then he had been a victim for 20 years or more every time he had been kissed. His lies were deliberate and told out of guilt but he was not prepared to face up to them.\u2019\n\nSpeaking from behind a screen to maintain her anonymity, the victim said she \u2018completely froze\u2019 when he kissed her.\n\nShe told the court: \u2018He was trying to sit on my lap almost. I didn\u2019t want to make a fuss, I knew I was not too far from where I wanted to get off, I didn\u2019t want to do anything to antagonise or make a fuss.\n\nGascoigne was arrested for kissing a woman in August 2018 on a train between York and Newcastle. (Picture: PA)\n\n\u2018He kept saying sorry and I kept just looking out of the window. He said sorry a second time and then tapped my arm again and I turned around. He grabbed my face, kissed me full on the lips.\n\n\u2018I was taken aback, it came completely out of the blue. I pushed him off, I pushed him away and said that is not OK, get off. It was on the mouth, I kept my mouth firmly shut, I just completely froze.\n\nHigh Court hearing to stop LGBT lesson protests outside primary school begins\n\n\u2018It was sloppy, not a peck on the cheek that you might give someone, it was very full on the lips and it was forceful. He just kind of mumbled.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPassenger Rebecca Jacques boarded at Chesterfield and sat across the aisle from Gascoigne.\n\nShe said of the incident: \u2018He put his hand on the lady\u2019s head and he put his tongue in her mouth. I was sitting side on so I could see exactly what he had done. It was clear he had got carried away with whatever he thought was going on.\u2019\n\nThe witness added that when she asked a male passenger why he had not done anything she was told: \u2018It\u2019s Paul Gascoigne.\u2019\n\nGascoigne denies one count of sexual assault.
