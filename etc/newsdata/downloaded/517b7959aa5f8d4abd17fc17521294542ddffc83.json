It's hard to see how it can make a third run, having already changed its pitch dramatically and done its best to look like a company for the times.\n\nKKR, Varde and Deutsche Bank were said to be very reluctant to budge from the $1.78 offer price, which represented 11-times profit and a 5.8 per cent dividend yield. Remember, less than a month ago they set out to get $2 to $2.25 a share.\n\nThere were rumours on Tuesday about the brokers stitching up a deal at 10-times, although once it gets to that stage it would be like asking clients to catch a falling knife. It was never going to happen.\n\nThe float gained some initial traction with domestic fund managers, however sentiment waned over the past fortnight.\n\nConsensus went from talking about the state of the Australian consumer to fears about Latitude's price and how it would trade with pre-IPO investors including its three big financial backers, accounting for two-thirds of the share register.\n\nThe retail broker firm offer pulled in $330 million in the $2 to $2.25 a share range, which was less than expected. Retail adviser Morningstar warned clients about the deal, before another firm slammed it outright late last week.\n\nBut what does Latitude's plight means for other IPOs in the pipeline? Latitude has shown it is not easy getting to the ASX boards \u2013 even if you are a big, cash-generative company expecting nearly $300 million profit in the coming year.", "description": "The silence was deafening out of the Latitude Financial Group camp on Tuesday night after its float was pulled.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.6444%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_3%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/211f616bf646f306bbd0345b6d9940618762112f", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
