But her resilient Chelsea side had other ideas.\n\nThe Gunners took the lead inside 10 minutes when Vivianne Miedema charged towards the Chelsea defence before feeding fellow Dutch international Danielle Van de Donk to slide a low drive into the bottom left corner beyond Ann-Katrin Berger.\n\nBeth England equalised for Chelsea after 57 minutes as Chelsea ended Arsenal's winning run\n\nEngland deservedly drew Chelsea level as the Blues exorcised a 5-0 defeat to Arsenal in 2018\n\nChelsea moved up to second and edged two points behind leaders Manchester City Women\n\nArsenal had a 10th-minute lead through Dutch midfielder Danielle Van de Donk's precise strike\n\nNorway defender Maria Thorisdottir was the unlikely hero with a winner five minutes from time\n\nJi So-Yun - who became more influential as the game progressed - came close to levelling midway through the first-half when Chelsea's efforts to push their opponents out of shape almost paid off.\n\nAfter weaving through the Arsenal defence, the 28-year-old South Korea midfielder curled a powerful left-footed shot narrowly wide of the target.\n\nChelsea midfielder and summer signing Guro Reiten rattled the bar with a spectacular effort from 20 yards moments later as Arsenal desperately tried to hang on to their lead in the latter stages of the first half.\n\nFive days after notching her first senior goal for the Lionesses against Portugal, Phil Neville's new kid on the block, Beth England, sent the 4,149-strong Kingsmeadow crowd wild just before the hour mark.\n\nArsenal arrived having won their first three Women's Super League matches of the new season\n\nEngland forward Fran Kirby produced a clever pass for the goal that broke Arsenal's resistance\n\nChelsea remained unbeaten after four games with a thrilling win over the reigning champions\n\nCapitalising on a Jen Beattie error, Fran Kirby squared an inch-perfect ball to the waiting England newcomer who pounced from close range. Hayes' hardworking side had earned their just rewards.\n\nOff the bench and on to the scoresheet, subs Ramona Bachmann and Maria Thorisdottir combined to put Chelsea in front five minutes before the final whistle.\n\nHitting a fierce ball first time with just enough curl on it to beat Manuela Zinsberger, defender Thorisdottir proved Hayes' unlikely hero.\n\nThe win sees Chelsea move above the Gunners into second spot, just two points behind leaders Manchester City. They end their north London rivals' 11-game unbeaten run in the FA WSL in the process.", "description": "Chelsea earned revenge for the 5-0 hammering they suffered when Arsenal last visited Kingsmeadow, reversing a half-time deficit to end Arsenal Women's run of 11 straight WSL wins.", "authors": ["Claire Bloomfield For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/18/19661432-0-image-a-58_1570987559986.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
