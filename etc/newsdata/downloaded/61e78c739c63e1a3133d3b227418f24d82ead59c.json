If no candidate gets over half of the votes, a second round will be held between the two leading candidates.\n\nTaliban fighters attacked several polling stations across the country to try to derail the process, but intense security prevented the large-scale violence of previous polls.", "description": "Afghanistan's presidential election turnout is unofficially estimated at a little over 2 million voters, an election commission official said on Sunday.", "authors": ["Hamid Shalizi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190929&t=2&i=1435114747&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8S04M", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
