Careful not to expose himself to the cast and cameramen, Gerard looked pleased with himself as he struck a pose\n\n'What about one with the butt in?' he asked, spinning round to give Josh a view of his bare cheeks.\n\nNot satisfied with the one photo, Gerard then ditched the inflatable and lay down by the pool.\n\nStretched out along the edge, he flaunted his washboard abs and healthy glow, all while keeping his hand firmly over his private parts.\n\nCheeky! 'What about one with the butt in?' he asked, spinning round to give Josh a view of his bare bottom\n\n'This is the pose,' he told Josh. 'This is the pose that got me on the show.'\n\nBut fellow islanders Matt Zukowski and Eoghan Murphy looked bemused as they watched Gerard's efforts.\n\n'You're missing a little oomph,' Matt said, as the rest of the boys gave Gerard some artistic direction.\n\nGerard seized his opportunity to strip off while the female islanders were away during Tuesday's episode.\n\nBefore going on Love Island Australia, the Instagram personality regularly posed in the buff for social media.", "description": "Love Island's Gerard Majda (pictured) isn't afraid to get his kit off.", "authors": ["Jess Bell For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/05/20164564-0-image-a-48_1571976488832.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
