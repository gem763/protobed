He founded the Elton John AIDS Foundation in the early 1990s, and the memoir \u2014 carefully apolitical about anything but L.G.B.T.Q. issues \u2014 more than once refers to his advocacy to explain away some controversy or other. When he performed at Rush Limbaugh\u2019s wedding in 2010, he says, he donated his fee to the foundation; and when he plays in Russia he uses the opportunity to promote gay rights.\n\nJohn describes himself as a sexual voyeur, and speculates that his desire to look rather than touch may have kept him safe from the disease. Aficionados of rock star memoirs, take note: This one also gets into John\u2019s bout of prostate cancer, complete with his surgery and use of adult diapers. The latter may be a first in the genre.\n\nHe is even more frank about addiction. Most of his best-known work was behind him when cocaine became part of his life. But he is not someone who does anything in small doses: \u201cNought to nuclear\u201d is more his style. And he had the money and access to indulge in huge amounts of drugs, to the point where he once spent two weeks in his bedroom coked up and drinking. He also had bulimia, and would become furious when anyone suggested he get help for any of these problems. As an example of how low he could go, he describes being shown a hotel room with the furniture in splinters, asking who did the damage and being told that the rampage had been his.\n\nThis is no sob story. Even the worst of it can be ghoulishly funny: On another bad morning he wakes up to the news that he spent part of the previous night throwing oranges at Bob Dylan, exasperated by Dylan\u2019s poor charades skills. (\u201cHe couldn\u2019t get the hang of the \u2018how many syllables?\u2019 thing at all.\u201d) What finally sobers him up is the combined effect of losing so many friends and watching what happens when somebody he cares about goes to rehab. He is scornful about the process until, suddenly, he isn\u2019t. And it works. Among other tidbits from the sober life, John reveals that he is Eminem\u2019s A.A. sponsor and reveals the obscenity Eminem uses by way of greeting.\n\nA book that sweeps from the world-class parental cruelty John experienced to Queen Elizabeth\u2019s slapping Viscount Linley in the face to John\u2019s fondness for Gianni Versace (an even wilder spendaholic than he is, which is no small feat: John at one point had a squash court full of unopened shipping crates) surely has something for everyone. \u201cMe\u201d was written with the help of the British music critic Alexis Petridis, who met with John frequently, heard his stories and created a facsimile of how John speaks. There\u2019s the hand of a pro in the book\u2019s polished transitions and foreshadowing. But judging from the glimpses of John\u2019s own writing that the book provides \u2014 at one point in rehab, he writes a letter to cocaine that contains the sentence \u201cI don\u2019t want you and I to share the same grave\u201d \u2014 the voice here sounds just right, even if it has been unfamiliar until now. It\u2019s a gift to finally hear from someone who has delivered so many of Taupin\u2019s words and so few of his own.", "description": "The rock star\u2019s memoir, \u201cMe,\u201d traces his path from suburban homebody to superstardom and beyond.", "authors": ["Janet Maslin"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/08/books/review/bookelton-john2/bookelton-john2-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
