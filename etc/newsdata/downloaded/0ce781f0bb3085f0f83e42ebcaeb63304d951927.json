It also marks the latest twist in a fractious deal that began with a separate hostile bid by H.I.S. Co (9603.T) and has drawn in U.S. hedge fund Elliott Management, which now owns around a 10% stake in Unizo.\n\nFortress said in a public filing it had extended a tender offer deadline to Oct. 17. It also disputed Unizo\u2019s statement that it had not dealt with Unizo\u2019s concerns about employment.\n\n\u201cUnizo and Fortress had agreed to maintain the current employment conditions or improve them,\u201d Fortress said. \u201cFortress has never suggested it would change this policy\u201d.\n\nA Unizo spokeswoman did not have any immediate comment in response to Fortress.\n\nU.S. ASSETS\n\nFortress said Unizo had proposed selling U.S. assets to raise 98.2 billion yen ($913 million), to be used by a Unizo-created entity to buy back Unizo shares from Fortress after the tender offer.\n\nFortress would not be able to change business plans or sell assets without the approval of the entity under the scheme.\n\nUnizo told Fortress it would start negotiations with other potential buyers if the fund did not agree to the proposal, Fortress added.\n\nUnizo said last week it had asked Fortress, which has offered 4,000 yen a share, to raise its price to 5,000 yen. Fortress said such an increase would be difficult, taking into account the sale of U.S. assets.\n\nShares of Unizo closed at 4,640 yen on Wednesday, indicating investors believe that Fortress may have to raise its bid - or that another suitor could come offer a higher price.\n\nUnizo has also said it received a separate offer from a top global fund, which it had rejected. The unnamed fund offered to buy Unizo at 5,000 yen a share.", "description": "SoftBank-backed <3248.T> Fortress Investment Group said on Wednesday it had extended its tender offer for Unizo Holdings <3248.T> for a second time, after the Japanese hotel chain abruptly withdrew its support for a $1.3 billion buyout bid.", "authors": ["Junko Fujita", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}
