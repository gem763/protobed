She even knows two commands: sit and come here.\"\n\n(Image: CEN)\n\nOksana also added that Frida knows what the word \"stay\" means, and is aware how to ask to go outside.\n\nShe added: \"I got a bunch of toys for her. She sleeps on the bed.\"\n\nThis week Oksana plans to make an appointment with the vet in order to have an estimate of Frida's age.\n\nNetizen 'Mariesh Nn' said: \"Wonderful news. This is marvellous.
