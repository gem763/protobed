From the modern skyscrapers that tower over midtown, to the pre-war classics that preside over Central Park West.\n\n\n\nBut regardless of the building, no single residence is more coveted than the penthouse.\n\n\n\nMore: Paul Allen\u2019s 414-Foot Yacht Octopus Lists for Over $300 Million\n\nOwning a penthouse in Manhattan undoubtedly comes with prestige and massive price tags, but the purchase is more than just a trophy home. Penthouses can actually be more resilient investments in a market that\u2019s been struggling, especially at the highest end.\n\n\n\nDuring the first half of this year, New York\u2019s luxury market\u2014defined as homes priced above $5 million\u2014was characterized by dipping prices, falling sales and oversupply, Mansion Global previously reported.\n\n\n\nData collected by Compass for Mansion Global, found that average sale prices for homes with a penthouse designation in Manhattan have been increasing at a sharper rate than typical condos and co-ops.\n\n\n\nBetween 2017 and 2018, the brokerage\u2019s data showed that penthouse units sold in Manhattan saw their average prices increase 21%, from $7.68 million to $9.3 million.\n\n\n\nIn comparison, data available online from real estate consultant City Realty showed that over the same time, the average sale price for a co-op in Manhattan saw its value increase just 2.1%, while condo prices fell 4.59%.\n\n\n\nBut crucial to making your penthouse investment as resilient as possible is making sure it\u2019s unique.\n\n\n\nWhat Makes a Penthouse\n\n\n\nA true penthouse \u201cshould stand out in terms of finishes, quality and amenities more than any of the other homes [in the building],\u201d said Brian K. Lewis, a Manhattan-based broker with Compass.\n\n\n\nOne $42.5 million penthouse on the market at 565 Broome in SoHo, for example, comes complete with a private pool on one of the home\u2019s terraces. Another, also asking $42.5 million, at 293 Lafayette St. in Nolita, has a wine room and a putting green.\n\n\n\nMore: Movie Producer Will List Pacific Palisades Home for $16.9 Million\n\nThough a penthouse doesn\u2019t necessarily have to have outdoor space, consumers have come to expect that as part of the prize of ownership, he said.\n\n\n\nA penthouse is also expected to offer more square footage than the lowlier units in the building and impressive views\u2014whether city, river or park\u2014are de rigueur.\n\n\n\n\u201cA consumer that wants to have something special and they want to have the ultimate home in the building, they should make sure that the penthouse they\u2019re attracted to is indeed rightfully named a penthouse and deserves to be called that,\u201d Mr. Lewis said.\n\n\n\nA Unique Investment\n\n\n\nThough it's common to think of a penthouse as singular crown on top of a building, the designation is brandished around more and more commonly. According to StreetEasy, at 56 Leonard in Tribeca\u2014a building dubbed the Jenga Building due to its offset floors\u2014there are 10 penthouses, and at 30 Park Place, also in Tribeca, there are four penthouses on the market currently.\n\n\n\n\u201cEveryone and their brother in my industry calls everything on the top floor a penthouse, but that's just marketing,\u201d Mr. Lewis said. \u201cThere are some big buildings that have seven, eight or nine penthouses,\u201d but that simply waters down a penthouse\u2019s rarity, he added.\n\n\n\nAnd it\u2019s exactly that distinctiveness which helps to make a penthouse investment less turbulent than other real estate in the city.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: Jazz Legend Miles Davis\u2019 Trumpet Hits Auction at Christie\u2019s\n\n\u201cWhat makes a true penthouses is that it\u2019s unique,\u201d said Jonathan Miller, chief executive of real estate appraisal firm Miller Samuel. \u201cApartments that are unique tend to be less volatile.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the principle of scarcity, to use appraisal speak,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn't prevent [a penthouse] from seeing declines or challenges; they\u2019re not immune to negative market trends.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about probabilities rather than guarantees, having a unique asset\u2014in a favorable way\u2014reduces risk,\u201d Mr. Miller said.\n\n\n\nThough not infallible, penthouses are more immune to wider market conditions, according to Leonard Steinberg, chief evangelist and broker at Compass.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe penthouse is the cherry on top of the cake. Some people don't like cherries, but nobody has a dream about living in the middle of the building,\u201d Mr. Steinberg said. \u201cIt\u2019s a romantic fantasy, a penthouse in Manhattan is a collector\u2019s item.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you have a collector\u2019s item, chances are, it's going to hold its value better than everything else. If it\u2019s an escalating market, your profit [on a penthouse] will be above other apartments,\u201d and on the other hand, during a downturn, it\u2019ll devalue less than other apartments, he said.\n\n\n\nAnd there will always be a very captivated market, too, according to Mr. Steinberg.\n\n\n\nMore: The Irish Ancestral Home of the Guinness Family Feels Like a Small Castle\n\nTake 520 Park Avenue, for example, a new development on the Upper East Side.

Buyers reportedly include investment banker Ken Moelis and British billionaire inventor James Dyson along with former Barclays CEO Bob Diamond.\n\n\n\n\u201cPeople with money are always looking for things with scarcity\u2014it\u2019s the ultimate driving force of valuation,\u201d Mr. Steinberg told Mansion Global.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen supply is limited, it boosts desirability, then you have to pay up if you want it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe person who has a property that is very difficult to replicate is always in a good position.\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Liz Lucking"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-104421?size=1.5590742996345919&width=1280", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
