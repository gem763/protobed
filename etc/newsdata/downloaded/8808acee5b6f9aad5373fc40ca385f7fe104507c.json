Trump speaks, his message is usually easy to understand: \u201cTrust me. I am the greatest. All good things come from me. And everything is beautiful.\u201d That was his message 30 years ago when he was selling unbuilt condos to Soviet money launderers, and it's his core message today as president about anything from the maxed-out economy to, well, the unbuilt border \u201cwall.\u201d\n\nBut the actual content of Trump's remarks often is distinct from the message. Among the truncated sentences, muddled analogies, half-truths and outright lies, there may be kernels of insight into what he really has been thinking or what he's been hearing. To be sure, delving into the rhetorical muck is a little like plumbing the depths of a septic tank for lost coins, but there is something to be learned nonetheless, and Trump's remarks on Wednesday about Turkey, Syria, Kurds, and \"the bloodstained sands\" are a striking example.\n\nOne starts with a transcript, which usually is posted on whitehouse.gov, but is not always easy to find. Type \u201cTurkey\u201d into the site's search engine and (of course) the first thing that pop's up is \u201cTurkey Pardoning,\u201d about sparing the bird on Thanksgiving. But with a bit of filtering, there it is: \u201cRemarks by President Trump on the Situation in Northern Syria.\u201d\n\nDiplomatic Reception Room\n\n11:41 A.M. EDT [October 23, 2019]\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you very much. My fellow Americans, I greet you this morning from the White House to announce a major breakthrough toward achieving a better future for Syria and for the Middle East. It\u2019s been a long time.\n\nDECRYPTION: This is pure fiction. The president is talking about an almost complete capitulation to Turkey's ambitions as it seizes Syrian territory in the name of self-declared national security. To call this a major breakthrough for a \"better future\" is an uncomfortable but probably oblivious echo of British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlin's declaration of \"peace for our time\" after Hitler assured him at Munich all he really wanted was a little chunk of Czechoslovakia. For 70 years, since the waning days of World War II, the United States and the United Nations have tried to counter such actions through international institutions and international laws. Trump is simply ignoring that history, and those laws.\n\nOver the last five days, you have seen that a ceasefire that we established along Syria\u2019s border has held, and it\u2019s held very well, beyond most expectations. Early this morning, the government of Turkey informed my administration that they would be stopping combat and their offensive in Syria, and making the ceasefire permanent. And it will indeed be permanent. However you would also define the word \u201cpermanent\u201d in that part of the world as somewhat questionable, we all understand that. But I do believe it will be permanent.\n\nClearly Trump does not have much faith the ceasefire will be permanent, and with reason.\n\n\u201c The heart of this part of Trump's remarks is the succession of rhetorical flourishes detached from any discernible reality. \u201d\n\nI have therefore instructed the Secretary of the Treasury to lift all sanctions imposed on October 14th in response to Turkey\u2019s original offensive moves against the Kurds in Syria\u2019s northeast border region. So the sanctions will be lifted unless something happens that we\u2019re not happy with.\n\nThe sanctions announced were never going to deter Turkey, and it's not clear that, over the course of only nine days, any were implemented.\n\nThis was an outcome created by us, the United States, and nobody else, no other nation. Very simple. And we\u2019re willing to take blame, and we\u2019re also willing to take credit. This is something they\u2019ve been trying to do for many, many decades. Since then, others have come out to help, and we welcome them to do so. Other countries have stepped forward, they want to help, and we think that\u2019s great. The nations in the region must ultimately take on the responsibility of helping Turkey and Syria police their border. We want other nations to get involved.\n\nThe only thing clear about this paragraph is that the president is none too subtly conflating the nation with Donald J. Trump. His unusual, indeed almost unheard of, suggestion that he is \"ready to take the blame\" for failure is rhetorical as he once again credits himself, but it also suggests rather more misgivings about the situation than he intends in his overall message.\n\nWe\u2019ve secured the oil, and, therefore, a small number of U.S. troops will remain in the area where they have the oil. And we\u2019re going to be protecting it, and we\u2019ll be deciding what we\u2019re going to do with it in the future.\n\nWhy? The United States does not need Syrian oil. The concern may be that the so-called Islamic State has not been so thoroughly defeated as Trump claims, and might re-take the fields. But that seems unlikely. The more obvious threat is from Russia and the Syrian regime. A significant if brief battle to defend the fields was fought on Feb. 7, 2018, when Syrian government troops and Russian mercenaries tried to take them and the Kurds and Americans and U.S. air power drove them off, a fight subsequently described in detail by The New York Times. Now, contrary to what Trump says, neither he nor the U.S. Special Operations Forces on the ground will be deciding what happens to those fields. It will be, yes, the Russians and the Syrian regime that tried and failed to win them back almost two years ago who determine their fate.\n\nIn any event, by the moves that we\u2019ve made, we are achieving a much more peaceful and stable area between Turkey and Syria, including a 20-mile-wide safe zone. An interesting term, \u201csafe zone.\u201d That\u2019s the term we\u2019re using it. Hopefully, that zone will become safe. Thousands and thousands of people have been killed in that zone over the years. But it\u2019s been sought for many, many decades, and I think we have something that\u2019s going to be strong and hold up.\n\nThe ironic term \"safe zone\" is straight out of Ankara's talking points, and nobody has been seeking such a buffer zone \"for decades\" apart from Turkey. Until Ankara's invasion, it was at peace.\n\nTurkey, Syria, and all forms of the Kurds, have been fighting for centuries. We have done them a great service, and we\u2019ve done a great job for all of them. And now we\u2019re getting out. A long time. We were supposed to be there for 30 days; that was almost 10 years ago. So we\u2019re there for 30 days, and now we\u2019re leaving. It was supposed to be a very quick hit and let\u2019s get out. And it was a quick hit, except they stayed for almost 10 years. Let someone else fight over this long-bloodstained sand.\n\nThis is an especially muddled paragraph. Until the end of World War I, which is to say one single century ago, Syria was part of the Turkish Ottoman Empire. Arabs and Kurds were restive, to be sure, but a ruthless peace was imposed by the the sultan at the Sublime Porte in Istanbul. Today, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan makes no secret of his desire to resurrect the realms of Ottoman influence if not, indeed, the empire.\n\nBut the heart of this part of Trump's remarks is the succession of rhetorical flourishes detached from any discernible reality. Is he talking about the Obama administration's decision in 2014 to deploy a small group of Special Forces\u2014which remained small\u2014to help coordinate the fight against ISIS? If so, that was five years ago, not ten. Or is he thinking about the invasion of Iraq in 2003, which he seems to reference later? No matter, the money quote is \"blood-stained sand,\" which is misleading both historically and topographically, but evocative for those many Americans who are tired of what seem endless wars.\n\nI want to thank Vice President Pence and Secretary of State Pompeo for leading the American delegation so successfully to Turkey several days ago, along with National Security Advisor O\u2019Brien. I want to thank them very much. The American delegation negotiated the original five-day ceasefire that ended [enabled] Kurdish fighters to safely leave. It just got them to a point where, frankly, they were able. It enabled them to get out, to go and move, really, just a few miles in a slightly different direction. So this enabled them to do so.\n\nIt's a good thing that once Trump abandoned the Kurds, an American delegation could arrange for them to be able to leave their homes and their land without being slaughtered. But this hardly seems to merit congratulation. His confusion between \u201cended\u201d and \u201cenabled\u201d as revealed by the White House brackets suggests he knows this.\n\nCountless lives are now being saved as a result of our negotiation with Turkey\u2014an outcome reached without spilling one drop of American blood. No injuries. Nobody shot, nobody killed.\n\nOnly American blood counts, even if Americans open the door for others to die.\n\nI have just spoken to General Mazloum, a wonderful man, the Commander-in-Chief of the SDF Kurds. And he was extremely thankful for what the United States has done. Could not have been more thankful. General Mazloum has assured me that ISIS is under very, very strict lock and key, and the detention facilities are being strongly maintained. There were a few that got out\u2014a small number, relatively speaking\u2014and they\u2019ve been largely recaptured.\n\nMazloum has very few options, and for the moment has to be grateful to the United States for a pause in the slaughter. He is also publicly grateful to the Russians, and on video no less. As for the terrorist prisoners, the U.S. special presidential envoy for Syria and the fight against ISIS, Jim Jeffrey, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday that for the moment nobody knows where the escaped prisoners are.\n\nI\u2019m also sure that he [Mazloum] will be issuing his own statement very shortly. We had a great talk. But we\u2019ve saved the lives of many, many Kurds. He understands that. The war was going to be vicious and probably not very long. And I\u2019m very happy to have been involved in it, as are our Vice President, our Secretary of State, and all of the other people on our team. By getting that ceasefire to stick, we\u2019ve done something that\u2019s very, very special. But by getting the ceasefire after a tremendous amount of really tough war for a very short period of days, that is something very special.\n\nOur troops are safe, and the pain and suffering of the three-day fight that occurred was directly responsible for our ability to make an agreement with Turkey and the Kurds that could never have been made without this short-term outburst.\n\nThis is a reference to Trump's infamous playground theory that you let kids beat each other up a bit before you pull them apart, and somehow things work the same way there in northeast Syria. In point of fact, there would have been no fighting at all\u2014just as there had been no fighting previously\u2014had Trump kept the U.S. Special Forces in place and showed such weak resolve.\n\nShould Turkey fail to honor its obligations, including the protection of religious and ethnic minorities\u2014which I truly believe they will do\u2014we reserve the right to re-impose crippling sanctions, including substantially increased tariffs on steel and all other products coming out of Turkey.\n\nThere is no reason to be confident Turkey will honor its obligations, and every reason to believe the jihadists it supports will carry out atrocities. Indeed, they've already committed war crimes. But Trump is convinced that the power of the almighty dollar can impose his will on any nation in the world without the need to deploy troops. So far, the good news has been that he has not sought new wars, \u00e0 la George W. Bush, but the economic pressure he puts on adversaries, including most obviously Iran, tempts them to call his bluff with \u201cother means.\u201d These can include terrorism or thinly veiled military action, as with the recent attacks on Saudi oil facilities. Turkey, for its part, has ignored Trump's sanction threats before, and will certainly do so again.\n\nWe are now an economic powerhouse like never before, and, very importantly, like no other. Our economic might is stronger than it\u2019s ever been, and our competitors are not doing very well.\n\nSome economic indicators, like the employment rate, are very good. Some, like the national debt, are mind-blowing: the equivalent of vastly maxed-out credit cards. But no nation or group of nations is yet in a position to challenge the supremacy of the U.S. dollar in international commerce. Unlike the many businesses Trump bankrupted, the United States may truly be too big to fail.\n\nWe also expect Turkey to abide by its commitment regarding ISIS. As a backup to the Kurds watching over them, should something happen, Turkey is there to grab them.\n\nTurkey has the second biggest military in NATO, after the United States. But it never fired so much as a slingshot against ISIS, even when the Islamic State's forces rolled up to Turkey's border. Indeed, as ISIS grew it was aided and abetted by the acquiescence of Turkish authorities who gave its foreign fighters easy passage into Syria, and often helped them recover in Turkish hospitals if they were wounded.\n\nFurther, we implore European countries to come and take those fighters that the U.S. captured and bring them back to their countries for incarceration and for trial. Until just recently, Europe has been very unresponsive in doing what they should have been doing for a long time. Now is their chance to finally act.\n\nTrump is right about this. Period.\n\nAmerican forces defeated 100 percent of the ISIS caliphate during the last two years. We thank the Syrian Democratic Forces for their sacrifices in this effort. They\u2019ve been terrific. Now Turkey, Syria, and others in the region must work to ensure that ISIS does not regain any territory. It\u2019s their neighborhood; they have to maintain it. They have to take care of it.\n\nActually, it was the Kurdish-led forces on the ground with American support, mainly from the air, who defeated ISIS. Trump is thanking them the way he might thank servants before stiffing them on their salaries. As for the \u201cothers in the region,\u201d the most important are Russia and Iran.\n\nThere were some political pundits who responded to Turkey\u2019s offensive in Syria by calling for yet another American military intervention. I don\u2019t think so. But halting the incursion by military force would have required deploying tens of thousands of American troops against Turkey\u2014a NATO Ally and a country the United States has developed a very good relationship with, including President Erdo\u011fan.\n\nThis is the great fallacy of Trump's presentation. There was never a question of the U.S. going to war against Turkey. But Erdogan had been deterred for years by the presence of small contingents of U.S. Special Forces in northeast Syria, and that could have continued. He saw Trump's weakness and exploited it. The critical moment probably came at the United Nations General Assembly last month when Erdogan presented a map showing precisely the \u201csafe zone\u201d he now claims, and Trump, perhaps out of arrogance or indecision or both, could not find the time to fit Erdogan into his schedule of one-on-one meetings. In the phone call that followed weeks later, Trump simply surrendered to Erdogan's will.\n\nThe same people that I watched and read\u2014giving me and the United States advice\u2014were the people that I have been watching and reading for many years. They are the ones that got us into the Middle East mess but never had the vision or the courage to get us out. They just talk.\n\n\u201cGiving me and the United States advice:\u201d a telling phrase. Here, Trump probably is thinking of the neo-cons who were coaches and cheerleaders for the Iraq invasion of 2003 and have since moved into the \u201cnever Trump\u201d camp on the domestic front.\n\nHow many Americans must die in the Middle East in the midst of these ancient sectarian and tribal conflicts? After all of the precious blood and treasure America has poured into the deserts of the Middle East, I am committed to pursuing a different course\u2014one that leads to victory for America.\n\nTrump in recent days has ordered an additional contingent of 3,000 troops to sandy Saudi Arabia, which is more than three times the number of American soldiers operating in Syria when Trump decided to start moving them around. There are now more U.S. troops in Iraq (about 6,000) while in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states there are between 45,000 and 65,000 U.S. military personnel.\n\nThrough much work, we have done things that everybody said couldn\u2019t be done. Today\u2019s announcement validates our course of action with Turkey that only a couple of weeks ago were scorned, and now people are saying, \u201cWow. What a great outcome. Congratulations.\u201d It\u2019s too early to me to be congratulated, but we\u2019ve done a good job. We\u2019ve saved a lot of lives.\n\nThis fumbled locution is exactly what Trump said, according to the White House transcript. He appears to be trying to stop himself from congratulating himself even more blatantly than what we see here.\n\nMost importantly, we have avoided another costly military intervention that could\u2019ve led to disastrous, far-reaching consequences. Many thousands of people could\u2019ve been killed.\n\nWe have avoided a costly military intervention that was never going to happen in the first place if U.S. policy had been clear and firm.\n\nThe last administration said, \u201cAssad must go.\u201d They could\u2019ve easily produced that outcome, but they didn\u2019t.\n\nNot without the kind of war Trump is congratulating himself for avoiding.\n\n\u201c Trump does admire autocratic nationalists, even if they find his language more than a little condescending. \u201d\n\nIn fact, they drew a very powerful red line in the sand\u2014you all remember, the red line in the sand\u2014when children were gassed and killed, but then did not honor their commitment as other children died in the same horrible manner. But I did honor my commitments with 58 Tomahawks.\n\nIronically, the Russians stepped in to help the Obama administration deal with Bashar Assad's chemical arsenal. As a result it was acknowledged for the first time and then almost entirely eliminated. After some residual chemicals were used by Assad early in Trump's term, apparently as a test, his Tomahawk attack was largely a symbolic show of high-powered fireworks\u2014and also coordinated with the Russians.\n\nEight long years after President Obama\u2019s ill-fated push at regime change, U.S. troops are still on the ground in Syria.\n\nThere were no American troops on the ground in Syria until 2014, and since then they could be counted in hundreds, not thousands.\n\nMore than half a million people are dead, hundreds of thousands are terribly injured, and millions more Syrians are displaced. It really is a nightmare of misery.\n\nDebate goes on about what Obama might have done to stop the carnage, but Turkey gave at least tacit aid to ISIS, and Russia and Iran openly supported the blood-drenched Assad regime. Now Trump would have us believe they are part of his grand plan for peace.\n\nAcross the Middle East, we have seen anguish on a colossal scale. We have spent $8 trillion on wars in the Middle East, never really wanting to win those wars. But after all that money was spent and all of those lives lost, the young men and women gravely wounded\u2014so many\u2014the Middle East is less safe, less stable, and less secure than before these conflicts began.\n\nThe Republican administration of George W. Bush launched the wars Trump is talking about here, and it certainly wanted to win them. It just failed to do so, not least because its planning was based on hubris.\n\nThe same people pushing for these wars are often the ones demanding America open its doors to unlimited migration from war-torn regions, importing the terrorism and the threat of terrorism right to our own shores. But not anymore. My administration understands that immigration security is national security.\n\nVery few people who pushed for the Bush wars recommend unlimited immigration today. Trump has a reasonable argument, as far as it goes, when he says immigration security cannot be divorced from national security. But when it comes to the question of terrorism, the greatest threat in the U.S. today is from domestic white supremacists, many of whom find elements of Trump's politics, especially vis a vis dark skinned immigrants, positively inspiring.\n\nAs a candidate for President, I made clear that we needed a new approach to American foreign policy, one guided not by ideology, but by experience, history, and a realistic understanding of the world.\n\nThis is a bold claim from a man who had no diplomatic or political experience, has no sense of history, and clearly has very little \u201crealistic\u201d understanding of the world. Most of those in his administration who did have such backgrounds have quit, been fired, or, in a couple of cases, become whistle blowers.\n\nWe are building up America\u2019s military might like never before, investing $2.5 trillion since my election. But we will not be depleted. We will not happen again. It will not be allowed to happen again, where our military is depleted, fighting in areas of the world where we shouldn\u2019t be.\n\nThe objective here would seem to be to deter other major powers, most notably Russia and China, as well as secondary powers North Korea and Iran. But how Trump plans to achieve the kind of quick and absolute victories he talks about is an open question. He frequently invokes apocalyptic images of \u201cfire and fury\u201d for North Korea, \u201cobliteration\u201d of Iran, or killing 10 million Afghans, which suggests he is mulling the use of nuclear weapons. Not a happy thought.\n\nWhen we commit American troops to battle, we must do so only when a vital national interest is at stake, and when we have a clear objective, a plan for victory, and a path out of conflict. That\u2019s what we have to have. We need a plan of victory. We will only win. Our whole basis has to be the right plan, and then we will only win. Nobody can beat us. Nobody can beat us.\n\nThis is the Powell Doctrine, which is fine if you have a clear vision of national interest, what threatens it, and why war would be the best or only response. That is not apparent in this administration.\n\nI want to again thank everyone on the American team who helped achieve the ceasefire in Syria, saved so many lives, along with President Erdo\u011fan of Turkey\u2014a man I\u2019ve gotten to know very well and a man who loves his country. And, in his mind, he\u2019s doing the right thing for his country, and we may be meeting in the very near future.\n\nTrump does admire autocratic nationalists, even if they find his language more than a little condescending.\n\nI also want to thank General Mazloum for his understanding and for his great strength and for his incredible words today to me\u2014but me just as a representative of the United States\u2014because he knows that we saved tens of thousands of Kurds. And we\u2019re not talking in the long term, we\u2019re talking in the short term. We\u2019re talking something that was going on immediately and something, frankly, that was planned for a long time.\n\nAgain, Trump is reminding himself in public that it's not all about him, but he just can't help himself. Then he slides into near incomprehensibility, trying to explain that his great victory is just for the short term, or not, but anyway it was planned, not (as everyone believes) the direct result of his capricious gut.\n\nThe job of our military is not to police the world. Other nations must step up and do their fair share. That hasn\u2019t taken place. Today\u2019s breakthrough is a critical step in that direction.\n\nIn northeast Syria, thank you Russia, thank your Iran, thank you Turkey for taking more than your share.\n\nThank you all very much, and God bless America. Thank you. Thank you.\n\nEND\n\n11:56 A.M.
