Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s former chief of staff recently revealed that the Green New Deal \u201cwasn\u2019t originally a climate thing at all \u2026 we really think of it as a how-do-you-change-the-entire-economy thing.\u201d That possibly explains the weird similarity between it and the constitution ushered in by Venezuelan leftist dictator Hugo Chavez in 1999.\n\nConsider the following parallels:\n\n\u2018Sustainable\u2019 Agriculture\n\nGreen New Deal: \u201cIt is the duty of the Federal Government to \u2026 [invest] in sustainable farming.\u201d\n\nVenezuelan Constitution: \u201cThe State shall promote sustainable agriculture\u2026\u201d\n\nEducation\n\nGreen New Deal: \u2018A Green New Deal will require \u2026 providing resources, training, and high-quality education, including higher education, to all people of the United States, with a may be full and equal participants in the Green New Deal mobilization.\u201d\n\nVenezuelan Constitution: \u201cEnvironmental education is obligatory in the various levels and modes of the education system\u2026\u201d\n\nMarkets\n\nGreen New Deal: \u201c\u2026ensuring a commercial environment where every businessperson is free from unfair competition and domination by domestic or international monopolies.\u201d\n\nVenezuelan Constitution: \u201c[T]he State shall be required to adopt such measures as may be necessary to prevent the harmful and restrictive effects of monopoly, abuse of a position of dominance and a concentration of demand\u2026\u201d\n\nHeath Care\n\nGreen New Deal: \u201c\u2026providing all people of the United States with \u2026 high-quality health care.\u201d\n\nVenezuelan Constitution: \u201cHealth is a fundamental social right and the responsibility of the State, which shall guarantee it as part of the right to life.\u201d\n\nHousing\n\nGreen New Deal: \u201c\u2026providing all people of the United States with\u2026 affordable, safe, and adequate housing\u201d\n\nVenezuelan Constitution: \u201cEvery person has the right to adequate, safe and comfortable, hygienic housing, with appropriate essential basic services.\u201d\n\nClean Environment\n\nGreen New Deal: \u201c\u2026providing all people of the United States with\u2026 clean water, clean air, healthy and affordable food, and access to nature.\n\nVenezuelan Constitution: \u201cEveryone has the right, individually and collectively, to enjoy a safe, healthful and ecologically balanced life and environment.\u201d\n\nSocial Costs of Human Activity\n\nGreen New Deal: \u201c\u2026ensuring that the Federal Government takes into account the complete environmental and social costs and impacts of emissions\u2026\u201d\n\nVenezuelan Constitution: \u201cAny activities capable of generating damage to ecosystems must be preceded by environmental and socio-cultural impact studies.\u201d\n\nNo Emissions\n\nGreen New Deal: \u201c\u2026to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions through a fair and just transition for all communities and workers.\u201d\n\nVenezuelan Constitution: \u201cIt is a fundamental duty of the State, with the active participation of society, to ensure that the populace develops in a pollution-free environment.\u201d\n\nGuaranteed Jobs\n\nGreen New Deal: \u201c\u2026guaranteeing a job with a family-sustaining wage, adequate family and medical leave, paid vacations, and retirement security to all people of the United States.\u201d\n\nVenezuelan Constitution: \u201cAll persons have the right and duty to work. The State guarantees the adoption of the necessary measures so that every person shall be able to obtain productive work providing him or her with a dignified and decorous living and guarantee him or her the full exercise of this right.\u201d\n\nWorkplace Safety\n\nGreen New Deal: \u201c\u2026strengthening and enforcing labor, workplace health and safety, antidiscrimination, and wage and hour standards across all employers, industries, and sectors.\u201d\n\nVenezuelan Constitution: \u201cEvery employer shall guarantee employees adequate safety, hygienic and environmental conditions on the job.\u201d\n\nUnions\n\nGreen New Deal: \u201c\u2026strengthening and protecting the right of all workers to organize, unionize, and collectively bargain free of coercion, intimidation, and harassment.\u201d\n\nVenezuelan Constitution: \u201cAll employees in both public and the private sector have the right to voluntary collective bargaining and to enter into collective bargaining agreements\u2026\u201d\n\nTrade Policy\n\nGreen New Deal: \u201c\u2026enacting and enforcing trade rules, procurement standards, and border adjustments with strong labor and environmental protections.\u201d\n\nVenezuelan Constitution: \u201cThe State reserves to itself the use of trade policy to protect the economic activities of public and private Venezuelan enterprises.\u201d\n\nIndigenous Populations\n\nGreen New Deal: \u201c\u2026obtaining the free, prior, and informed consent of indigenous peoples for all decisions that affect indigenous peoples and their traditional territories, honoring all treaties and agreements with indigenous peoples, and protecting and enforcing the sovereignty and land rights of indigenous peoples\u2026\u201d\n\nVenezuelan Constitution: \u201cIt shall be the responsibility of the National Executive, with the participation of the native peoples, to demarcate and guarantee the right to collective ownership of their lands, which shall be inalienable, not subject to the law of limitations or distrait, and nontransferable, in accordance with this Constitution and the law. \u201c\n\n***\n\nWhile these many similarities may be just happenstance, the important thing to remember is that Venezuela under its new constitution has become a disaster zone. There is political, economic and social chaos. Those who can are escaping what once was a prosperous nation as fast as they possible.\n\nBut that failure probably shouldn\u2019t be so surprising. The reason the Green New Deal and the Venezuelan Constitution are so similar is that their common source is likely a United Nations document called the \u201cInternational Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,\u201d which was passed by the UN General Assembly in 1966 at the behest of the Soviet Union. The UN Covenant itself can be traced back to the Stalin-written Soviet Constitution of 1936.\n\nThe words and notions of all these documents may sound good to some, but in the end, they are just empty words at best, a siren call for the na\u00efve, beckoning them to a socialist utopia, and at worst, lip service meant to distract from totalitarian brutality.\n\nBut despite more than 100 years of trying over vast swaths of the earth, and more than 100 million deaths and other incalculable miseries caused, it\u2019s become clear that socialists can\u2019t even murder their way to utopia. Their words may sound good, but they inevitably lead to disaster.\n\nSteve Milloy publishes JunkScience.com and is the author of Scare Pollution: Why and How to Fix the EPA (Bench Press, 2016).", "description": "There is a weird similarity between the Green New Deal and the Venezuelan constitution ushered in by leftist dictator Hugo Chavez in 1999.", "authors": ["Steve Milloy"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/03/wi/afp/26/17ec7f_us-senate-rejected-green-new-deal-combat-climate-change-as-democrats-accused-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
