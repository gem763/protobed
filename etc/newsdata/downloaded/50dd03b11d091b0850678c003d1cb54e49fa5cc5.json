UPDATE 1-Renault sales warning drags on European shares\n\n* Renault hits lowest since 2013\n\n* Danone tumbles after narrowing sales growth outlook\n\n* Bourses in Germany, Spain, Italy eke out tentative gains\n\n* UK parliament to vote on new Brexit deal on Saturday\n\n\n\n(Adds quote, details; updates prices)\n\nBy Medha Singh and Lisa Pauline Mattackal\n\nOct 18 (Reuters) - French carmaker Renault dragged European\n\nshares lower on Friday, while the sharpest contraction in the\n\nChinese economy in nearly three decades exacerbated worries\n\nabout slowing global growth.\n\nRenault slumped 12.7% to lowest since 2013 after\n\nthe company cut its full-year revenue and profit forecast amid a\n\nbroad-based slump in auto sales.\n\nThe fall put the wider auto and auto parts index on\n\ncourse for its biggest percentage drop in two-and-a-half weeks,\n\nand pulled the Paris index down 0.2%, lagging its\n\nEuropean peers.\n\nAdding to the gloom in the auto sector, Sweden's AB Volvo\n\nsaid demand for trucks would fall on both sides of\n\nthe North Atlantic next year. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was marginally\n\nlower, eyeing its third day of losses, but still on pace to end\n\na volatile week, dominated by Brexit headlines, modestly higher.\n\nBoris Johnson struck a Brexit deal with the European Union\n\non Thursday, sending the benchmark index to its highest in more\n\nthan a year, but concerns remain about the deal getting through\n\nthe British parliament.\n\n\"Everyone is very tired of Brexit. People just want to get\n\nthis done and look forward to other things, like negotiating a\n\nfree trade deal,\" said Stefan Koopman, senior market economist\n\nat Rabobank.\n\nUncertainty about UK's orderly exit from the EU and other\n\ngeopolitical tensions, combined with slowing global growth, have\n\nrankled financial markets this year.\n\nAfter a solid increase in the first quarter, gains in the\n\nSTOXX 600 index have tapered off in the second and third. Fresh\n\ndata on Friday showed China's economic growth slowed more than\n\nexpected in the third quarter. Investor focus now turns to the third-quarter earnings\n\nseason, which kicks off in earnest next week. An earnings\n\nrecession in Europe is expected to deepen in the third quarter,\n\naccording to IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nEarly earnings reports, however, were a mixed bag, with weak\n\nresults from the defence and retail sectors, but a strong report\n\nfrom Swedish medical technology group Getinge . Its\n\nshares jumped 16.3% to the top of STOXX 600 after reporting a\n\nbetter-than-expected quarterly core profit. Thales , the largest European defence electronics\n\ncompany, dropped 3.5% after lowering its 2019 revenue growth\n\nforecast, while yogurt maker Danone tumbled 6.2% after\n\nnarrowing its sales growth outlook for 2019.\n\nLondon Stock Exchange rose 2.4% after reporting a\n\nhigher-than-expected third-quarter income ahead of the planned\n\nshareholder vote on its deal to buy data provider Refinitiv.\n\nThe German index ticked higher, with help from\n\nDeutsche Post AG after Berenberg upgraded the stock\n\nto \"buy\", while gains in banks propped up Spanish and\n\nItalian bourses.\n\n\n\n", "description": "UPDATE 1-Renault sales warning drags on European shares", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPED4E0EG_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
