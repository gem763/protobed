The guiding theme of these works is empathy\u2014how inmates shouldn\u2019t be fully defined by their sentences and are human beings capable of redemption. 45 Seconds of Laughter, Robbins\u2019 latest turn behind the camera, follows in kind.\n\nSet at the Calipatria State Prison, an all-male maximum-security facility in Imperial City, California, the documentary, which made its North American premiere at the New York Film Festival, is a fly-on-the-wall account of The Prison Project, an offshoot of Robbins\u2019 theater troupe The Actors\u2019 Gang, which teaches acting workshops to the incarcerated, allowing them to access their emotions, form bonds, and break down barriers. Robbins\u2019 group trains the men in Italian commedia dell\u2019arte, and the film chronicles the rehearsal and staging of a performance for their friends and family members, from summer to Christmas.\n\n\u201cWhat it does in training is, it frees the actor from having to create a character out of whole cloth,\u201d Robbins tells The Daily Beast of the commedia dell\u2019arte technique. \u201cThe actor can choose any one of the characters, and this allows them to get at the essence of what we\u2019re trying to do, which is to connect to a deep emotional truth.\u201d\n\nOver the course of our winding chat, Robbins opened up about our iniquitous criminal-justice system, why The Shawshank Redemption has stood the test of time, his controversial politics, and much more.\n\nHow did The Actors\u2019 Gang get involved with The Prison Project?\n\nAlmost fourteen years ago, one of my actresses, Sabra Williams, came to me and asked if she could start this work in prison. For me, it seemed like a natural extension of the work that we had been doing with the method of acting that we use, since we had already been doing it in schools. So, I gave her some money to start a pilot program and checked in on it. We soon realized, after making some adjustments, how effective it could be as a form of rehabilitation. We noticed a change happening with the people we were working with, and as we got better with it, we came to understand the power in the work, and the effectiveness of the work.\n\n20 Things You Didn\u2019t Know About \u2018The Shawshank Redemption\u2019\n\nCNN\u2019s Van Jones Is Not Going to Apologize for Complimenting Trump: \u2018I\u2019m Proud of It\u2019\n\nWhat \u201cchange\u201d did you see happening?\n\nFirst off, eye contact. Getting guys from rival gangs to work in the same room to achieve a common goal, and doing it successfully, and seeing how the barriers started to break down was a shift for us. Something about the way that we train actors was translating into something that was truly effective for these gentlemen, and consequently, for the women we worked with as well.\n\nIn 45 Seconds of Laughter, we don\u2019t know what the men were put in prison for. Did you feel omitting that information made for a purer viewing experience?\n\nWe never know. We don\u2019t want to know. For us, it\u2019s essential to walk into those rooms without judgment, and to operate these workshops in a collective way that isn\u2019t about \u201cteacher knows everything, student knows nothing.\u201d In fact, we try very early on in the workshop to infuse the voices of the people we\u2019re working with as a legitimate voice, so that\u2019s why we always check in after exercises to see how they\u2019re thinking and feeling. I think it\u2019s an anomaly to them; it\u2019s not something they\u2019re used to, to be treated with respect, and it helps in breaking down these barriers. I\u2019m of the opinion that, as Sister Helen Prejean says, \u201cEvery person is worth more than their worst act.\u201d I have met many, many people in prison who know exactly what they\u2019ve done, aren\u2019t questioning whether they should be in jail for it, but are looking for a way to change the direction of their life. For me, the future is essential and what happened in the past is not relevant to the work we\u2019re doing.\n\nBetween this, The Shawshank Redemption and Dead Man Walking, your career\u2019s inextricably linked to prison, and to the plight of the prisoner. Why do you think that\u2019s happened?\n\nI think the reason why I was able to approach the role in Shawshank Redemption the way that I did was connected to my upbringing. I grew up in Greenwich Village in the late-\u201860s and early-\u201870s. It was fun, complicated, dangerous, groundbreaking, but the thing that I haven\u2019t seen in the story about Greenwich Village at that time was how complicated the cultural dynamics were between second and third-generation Italian and Irish and bohemians, hippies, folk singers, etc. I went to a Catholic school with a bunch of kids, some of whom were pretty tough, and you had to learn how to run or fight. There were certain routes you would take when you were walking the streets, certain places you knew to avoid because a potential fight existed on that street. I grew up around a culture of survival and crime, and growing up in that environment demanded choices. Luckily I made the right choices, but some of my friends made the wrong ones and wound up in the system. So I never felt far removed from those that wound up in prison. When I was looking at portraying Andy Dufresne, I went in with a lack of judgment on who these people were that were incarcerated.", "description": "Stefania D'Alessandro/GettyTim Robbins has become synonymous with prison dramas.
