To counter the uniparty obstruction that prevents Congress from producing a balanced budget and facilitating unbridled government growth, these members formed the House Freedom Caucus.\n\nThe idea was that too many Americans, particularly conservatives, were feeling disenfranchised. The House Freedom Caucus would serve to fight the entrenched powers that brought so much dismay to Americans.\n\nThe first Chairman of the Freedom Caucus was the iconoclastic Jim Jordan (R-OH), and he was followed by the inimitable Mark Meadows (R-NC). Their dynamic leadership, coupled with their intelligent and dedicated members, helped this caucus become a force in Congress and gain national notoriety.\n\nWhen I ran for Congress in 2016, I was repeatedly asked by conservatives whether I would follow my predecessor, Matt Salmon, by joining the Freedom Caucus. Establishment types urged me to avoid the Freedom Caucus. For me it was a no-brainer; I immediately joined.\n\nMembers of the House Freedom Caucus supported, and the American people voted for the biggest change agent of the last 30 years, Donald Trump, to be their President. In contrast, Democratic National Committee Spokesperson Xochitl Hinojosa said in a recent interview that the American people want the Democratic presidential candidates to explain, \u201cwhat will you do for me.\u201d\n\nHouse Freedom Caucus members and other Republicans simply tell the American people that we will work to limit government and let each American govern themselves. We believe in the ingenuity, integrity, and industry of the American people. Most Americans don\u2019t want us to give them something other than the space to fulfill the entirety of their creation.\n\nAs I contemplate my Chairmanship of the House Freedom Caucus, I realize that I am being asked to fill the shoes of, and stand on the shoulders of, giants. The Freedom Caucus will continue to be the forum where the liveliest and most substantive debate occurs. We will advance the policies that are consistent with the promises we have made to the American people. Trust is born on keeping one\u2019s word. The Freedom Caucus has worked diligently to keep its promises and will continue to do so. We will continue to be the voice of Americans who feel that Washington has closed its ears to them.\n\nThe House Freedom Caucus will help beat back the Democrats\u2019 efforts to overturn the 2016 election and to institute radical socialized policies across the nation. In an April 29, 2019 letter to the President, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer indicated a commitment to bipartisan efforts on a transportation infrastructure bill. But in the meantime, however, they have allowed for an ever-growing, caustic atmosphere to permeate the U.S. Congress. They have facilitated an unwarranted effort to thwart the success of the Trump administration (and many bipartisan efforts) by promoting a deceptive impeachment narrative. The House Freedom Caucus will continue to be a powerful voice against this feeble and misguided endeavor.\n\nThe House Freedom Caucus has proven highly effective throughout its tenure, and I have every expectation that we will continue our mission to advance an agenda of limited, constitutional government in Congress, give a voice to Americans who feel that institutions in Washington have left them without representation, and promote liberty, safety, and prosperity for all Americans.", "description": "Several years ago, numerous conservative Members of Congress felt that .09/17/2019 19:25:49PM EST.", "authors": ["Congressman Andy Biggs", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/260/c2cab627-f534-42fa-b63a-b5e25e24dde4.png", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
