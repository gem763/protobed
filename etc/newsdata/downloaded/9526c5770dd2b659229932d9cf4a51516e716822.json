Saslaw (D-Fairfax), SkyLink Aviation, and the Community College Consortium on Autism and Intellectual Disabilities. Linda Wallis Miller, who had served as Saslaw\u2019s campaign treasurer, pleaded guilty to the three fraud schemes in 2015 and was sentenced to 56 months in prison. David Miller faces up to 20 years in prison on each of the 10 counts of conviction when he is sentenced Jan. 24.\n\n\u201cThey were partners in crime,\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney Uzo Asonye said at sentencing. \u201cThe Millers worked together . . . to line their own pockets.\u201d\n\nA mistrial was declared on two counts of aggravated identity theft.\n\nDavid Miller insisted at trial he had \u201cno idea\u201d his wife was taking funds from Saslaw or the autism group. He admitted that as the company\u2019s general counsel he deceived SkyLink by creating \u201cfake personalities\u201d that he pretended were lawyers outside the company. But he argued that he earned the extra money he paid himself by doing additional work.\n\n\u201cIt was deceitful and very unethical,\u201d he testified, but \u201cI felt that the work that I was doing was outside the scope of my job . . . the end justified the means.\u201d\n\nHe claimed he had helped save SkyLink millions and brought in enough funding for the autism education organization to balance out whatever his wife took.\n\n\u201cI think she should have earned compensation,\u201d he said. Defense attorney Drew Hutcheson described Miller in an opening statement as \u201centrepreneurial.\u201d\n\nWitnesses disputed that perspective, saying they would never have approved the $600,000 Linda Miller took from the autism consortium or the $368,000 David Miller took from SkyLink.\n\nFrom Saslaw, they took about $653,000.\n\n\u201cHe was already paid very handsomely,\u201d prosecutor Samantha Bateman said of Miller.\n\nThe couple used the funds from the fraud to take three vacations on private jets, pay the $8,500 monthly mortgage payment on their home in Fairfax and renovate their $1 million beach house in Maryland.\n\nMiller was fired in May 2014 when SkyLink became aware of his misconduct; his wife was fired from the Saslaw campaign four months later. He professed to have no involvement in his family finances and was thus unaware of the money his wife was stealing, although some of the funds went to his sister, his personal lawyer and his child support payments.\n\n\u201cI thought we had a lot of money in the bank,\u201d he testified.\n\nMiller testified that his wife was under a lot of pressure because she was \u201csaddled dealing\u201d with their three children. Two of the children are severely autistic, he said.\n\nProsecutors noted that on the night the FBI came to Miller\u2019s home to interview his wife about stealing from the Saslaw campaign, David Miller sent out a fundraising appeal on behalf of the autism group to more than a dozen community college presidents, asking for more money.\n\nRead more:\n\nJustice Department says leaking classified information is \u2018thievery, not protected speech\u2019\n\nA mystery 32 stories up: Is a grandfather, 68, leaping of the D.C. area\u2019s tallest buildings?\n\nCoast Guard lieutenant accused of plotting mass attack pleads guilty to gun, drug charges\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "The fraud exceeded $1.5 million; he claimed it was largely his wife\u2019s doing.", "authors": ["Rachel Weiner", "Local Reporter Covering Federal Court In Alexandria", "Va.", "Local Court In Arlington", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/vmA1dC7d5TTjkJyMlg18lxalZBY=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JNCCQVEZZEI6TGQW3RKR5JNEHM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
