Blige is baring more than her toned abs in her November cover shoot for Self \u2014 she\u2019s also baring her soul.\n\nThe singer and Oscar-nominated actress comes clean in her Self interview with writer Jamilah Lemieux \u2014 tackling her painful 2018 divorce, being sexually abused as a child and past substance abuse, which she regards as a coping mechanism.\n\nMary J. Blige opens up about her past substance abuse, avoiding therapy and practicing self-care.

You\u2019re doing it to cover up something.\u201d\n\nThe 48-year-old says she got sober after having visions of herself overdosing or dying because of drugs. She also says it \u201ctook a lot of prayer\u201d to get to where she is today.\n\nBut the star was more resistant to seeking more formal counseling, fearing that a therapist might expose her secrets.\n\n\u201cFor years I would not see a therapist. I just would handle it. For years, for years,\u201d she says, citing \u201chow people would do anything for money, and how anybody at any moment can become paparazzi.\u201d\n\nThough her songs have often referenced her personal turmoil, Blige prefers to keep some cards close to her chest, saying, \u201cYou only know what I tell you. And I don\u2019t tell everything.\n\n\u201cAs public as I am, I\u2019m real private,\u201d she adds. \u201cI\u2019ll give you the juice and the truth, but not the stuff that\u2019s going to kill me \u2026 I grew up in a neighborhood where we couldn\u2019t tell everything. It would kill us. So you \u2018know,\u2019 but you don\u2019t [know]. You know?\u201d\n\nGod, she says, is the exception: Her go-to confidante and very own \u201cMary J. Blige.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe showed me the truth in me, so I can be transparent,\u201d she tells the magazine. \u201cBut I don\u2019t have someone I listen to. I don\u2019t. It\u2019s just me. It\u2019s a very alone place, but it is what it is. And it\u2019s always been this.\u201d\n\nThe newly single music legend also says she\u2019s more invested in mothering herself \u2014 including a practice that includes naps, exercise, a healthy diet, daily prayer and affirmations \u2014 than becoming a mother.\n\n\u201cRight now I\u2019m not thinking about anybody but her,\u201d she says of practicing self-love. \u201cI love people, I love the world, I love my nieces, I love my nephews, I love my family, I love them so deeply. But right now it\u2019s about me and little Mary. It\u2019s like that\u2019s my baby, my little girl. She needs my help \u2026 and I\u2019m not going to ever let anybody hurt her again. She needs to live, she needs to play. She doesn\u2019t mind her life being used to help someone else. ... But I have to take care of her.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "The Oscar-nominated singer and actress opened up to \"Self\" about prayer, self-care and choosing to mother herself over having a kid.", "authors": ["Erin Donnelly"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/82vuewPsQVGYbyOQzoRwxQ--~B/aD0yNTMzO3c9MjIwODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/0fa39a80-e926-11e9-bbfe-28e2b32f8812", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
