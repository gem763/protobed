Again.", "language": "en", "text": "Romney\u2019s break with Trump is not without risk to the first term senator. But then again, neither is Trump\u2019s attack on a member of the Senate jury. Leaving aside Trump\u2019s own apparent obsession with Romney (who got a higher percentage of the popular vote than Trump himself), his attacks are also an unsubtle warning to other senators who might be tempted to speak out.\n\nBut this sort of intimidation only works as long as the wall of silence holds.\n\nWhat would happen if three or four\u2014or eight or nine\u2014Republicans senators joined Romney? How would Trump react to a critical mass of senators who pushed back?\n\nWhat would happen if a half dozen senators who remembered the legacy of Margaret Chase Smith joined together to condemn \u201cFear, Ignorance, Bigotry and Smear\u201d? Would Trump tweet insults at them all? And how would their Senate colleagues react then?", "description": "", "authors": ["Charlie Sykes", "Thebulwark.Com Romney-Alone-Again"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
