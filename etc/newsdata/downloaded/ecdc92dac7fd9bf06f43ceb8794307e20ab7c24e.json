Bertelsman partially reversed his ruling to dismiss #nicksandmann's claims against the @washingtonpost. Nick's case may now proceed into discovery.

McMurtry (@ToddMcMurtry) October 28, 2019\n\nAs a prepare for summary judgment hearing today in LA in Vernon Unsworth v. Elon Musk, the news of our team\u2019s huge win in Covington, KY reaffirms my career-long belief that our system of justice works. Nicholas Sandmann deserves his day in court against WaPo. Now he will get it. \u2014 Lin Wood (@LLinWood) October 28, 2019\n\nJudge William O. Bertelsman of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky, a Jimmy Carter appointee, partially reversed his previous ruling in which he dismissed Sandmann\u2019s $275 million lawsuit. The reversal will permit the Covington student\u2019s lawsuit to proceed, reported LifeSiteNews.\n\nFollowing the March for Life in Washington, DC, in January, many media outlets alleged a video depicted Sandmann, wearing a red \u201cMake American Great Again\u201d cap, and fellow students from Covington Catholic High School, as intimidating Native American activist Nathan Phillips near the Lincoln Memorial.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, Sandmann \u201cbecame the focus of the anti-Trump media\u201d as an extended video and additional in-person reports of the confrontation showed it was Phillips who had intimidated Sandmann while the teen and his fellow classmates were simply performing school cheers as a group of Black Hebrew Israelites shouted racist insults.\n\nThe Washington Post admitted to the existence of vague \u201csubsequent reporting\u201d but neither retracted nor apologized to Sandmann for its false reporting.\n\nBertelsman dismissed the lawsuit based on the Post\u2019s failure to name Sandmann specifically and said that the \u201crhetorical hyperbole\u201d of the news outlet was protected by the First Amendment.\n\nPresident Donald Trump tweeted that Sandmann was \u201csmeared by media\u201d:\n\nLooking like Nick Sandman & Covington Catholic students were treated unfairly with early judgements proving out to be false \u2013 smeared by media. Not good, but making big comeback! \u201cNew footage shows that media was wrong about teen\u2019s encounter with Native American\u201d @TuckerCarlson \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 22, 2019\n\nAs Breitbart News also reported, Sandmann\u2019s attorneys filed lawsuits as well against CNN, NBCUniversal, Democrat 2020 presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, the New York Times\u2019 Maggie Haberman, comedian Kathy Griffin, and other media and left-wing activists.\n\nKristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America, said in a statement to Breitbart News that, each day, her organization \u201cdefends the free speech rights of students to stand for life in public in what is supposed to be a free society.\u201d\n\nShe continued:\n\nThe mistreatment of students as they attended the March for Life should offend all Americans who believe that each of us is protected when we act on our own consciences. It\u2019s a good thing when a judge decides to respect students\u2019 rights to be heard and to be seen with respect.\n\n\u201cAs someone who works every day to defend the rights and needs of mothers and their preborn children, I know that the media often ignores and mischaracterizes pro-life Americans,\u201d Hawkins added. \u201cBut our system of justice should protect the rights and freedoms of Americans who stand for the weakest among us, those whose life exists in the womb and who don\u2019t have a voice or a vote.\u201d", "description": "A judge has reversed his ruling and allowed Covington Catholic's Nick Sandmann to proceed with his lawsuit against the Washington Post.", "authors": ["Dr. Susan Berry"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/01/Covington-Instagram-e1548017350179.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
