But today I realized, 'Hey, I can do this too,'\" said a 12th-grade student named Katelyn.\n\nAnother student, an 11th-grader named Karyanna, said, \"It's such an exciting time to be in STEM. There's so much left for us to discover.\"\n\nDelta\n\nThe flight was planned and orchestrated by an all-female crew, and women also served as ramp agents working on the ground, gate agents boarding the flight and operators in the control tower guiding the aircraft off the runway, according to Delta.\n\nOut of the 609,306 pilots in the U.S., about 7% are women, according to 2017 data from the Federal Aviation Administration's Aeronautical Center. There are no female flight navigators, according to the data.\n\nOnce the flight touched down in Houston, the girls toured NASA's Mission Control Center, the Johnson Space Center and Space Center Houston.\n\nThey also spoke with other women in the aviation field, including Jeanette Epps, a NASA astronaut and aerospace engineer.\n\nIn selecting the participants, Delta worked with Salt Lake City schools that have STEM or aviation programs. The passengers included students from Advanced Learning Center, Bryant Middle School, Granite Technical Institute, Jordan Technical Institute, Karl G. Maeser Preparatory Academy and Salt Lake Center for Science Education.", "description": "An all-female Delta flight took 120 girls to NASA to promote equality in the aviation industry.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/delta-crew-ht-ps-191010_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
