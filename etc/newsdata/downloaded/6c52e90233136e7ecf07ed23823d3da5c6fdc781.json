In the swirl of Washington crazy that followed Trump\u2019s Twitter firing of John Bolton on Tuesday, NBC reported that Trump had been reaching out to Bolton\u2019s predecessor H.R. McMaster, to complain about Bolton and ask for advice on national security matters, including whom to appoint as secretary of defense.\n\nNo one is speculating about McMaster coming back, though \u2014 after all, Trump found him intensely annoying in person. Apparently this had also become true of Bolton, so much so that earlier this summer senior White House officials advised Bolton to avoid the president and plan as much foreign travel as possible to stay out of Trump\u2019s way. Two months ago, Tom Wright pointed out that Bolton was literally sent to Mongolia while Trump and his entourage met with Kim Jong-un. Bolton was cut out of discussions about lowering preconditions for an agreement with North Korea, and not for the last time; Bolton also seems not to have been involved in planning for the president\u2019s abortive Camp David Afghanistan summit last week or in the president\u2019s decision to call off airstrikes on Iran back in June.\n\nRemember, Bolton was once credited with being a bureaucratic ninja, a brilliant master of cabinet-level knife fights and death by memo. His anti-interventionist opponents feared that he would effectively mobilize the full force of the U.S. security apparatus in support of his warmongering policies, marginalizing and neutering President Trump in the process.\n\nThat sounds pretty silly now, doesn\u2019t it?\n\nLarge swathes of left and libertarian right Washington are celebrating Bolton\u2019s downfall. Not to be a killjoy, but there\u2019s not much worth celebrating here. Bolton\u2019s effort to get his way, and Trump\u2019s desire to avoid dealing with him, mean that the ultimate bureaucratic warrior dragged the bureaucracy down with him. Bolton, who famously said you could lop ten floors off U.N. headquarters and no one would notice, went down with the floors of the National Security Council\u2019s 19th-century headquarters caving in around him.\n\nThe United States \u2014 with the largest military and intelligence establishments the world has ever seen, diplomats abroad in 290-some missions and troops in more than 150 countries, embroiled in a trade war with its main peer competitor and many of its own allies \u2014 currently has no effective mechanism to coordinate its actions. Let that sink in. Trump plans a summit without the professional summit planners. White House staff go around the civilian chain of command at the Defense Department. Advisers without job titles or security clearances seem to write policies that State and Defense employees find out about via Twitter \u2014 in fact, senior employees at those and other agencies now spend important parts of their day watching the president\u2019s Twitter account in case something relevant comes across.\n\nBolton accelerated this trend, including his own reported propensity to go around Defense Department officials whose views he did not share. Secretary of State Pompeo thrives on it, so much so that he\u2019s being described as a possible successor to Bolton while staying in his current job. He\u2019ll love the comparison to Henry Kissinger, who held both roles between 1973 and 1975; he might not love the other comparison, that the dual appointment came about in the midst of Watergate turmoil and the final decline of the Nixon White House.\n\nBut Kissinger had a staff that he had assembled and trusted, a reliable process for decision-making, and plenty of members of Congress, including Republicans, who took seriously the responsibility of oversight, even when the malfeasance came from one of their own.\n\nThe next national security adviser won\u2019t have any of those things. Bolton has helped break the system in ways that will take a new president years to repair \u2014 ways that make an accidental war, or the launch of a missile, or deaths of Americans, or economic catastrophe more likely even under a less warlike figure. That\u2019s nothing to celebrate.\n\nAnd now Bolton himself is just another prominent national-security conservative whom Trump has used, discredited, and discarded. It would be a blessing if his allies in the GOP finally saw this as one humiliation too many. But that seems unlikely. Trump believes that \u201cwhen you\u2019re famous, they let you do it\u201d \u2014 and, while women have sought to prove him wrong, too much of the GOP seems bent on proving him right.\n\nSign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter Daily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.
