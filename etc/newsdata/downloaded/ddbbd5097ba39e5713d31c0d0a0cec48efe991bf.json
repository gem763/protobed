Kavanaugh, as some 2020 Democrats called on Congress to do this weekend over a new sexual misconduct allegation, almost certainly won\u2019t happen. Democrats are focused on potentially impeaching President Trump, it\u2019s historically rare to impeach a justice, and it wouldn\u2019t get him off the court: Unseating him would require a number of Senate Republicans to vote to unseat the justice who tipped the court majority in their favor.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t hear a lot more about this. The incident the New York Times reported is just coming to light, and with it new questions about its validity and why we are just learning of it. We\u2019ll also continue to hear about it because the allegations against Kavanaugh provide potent political weaponry for both sides. They are a way for both Democrats and Republicans to make the 2020 election about something other than Trump, while still playing up the central themes of their messaging.\n\nDemocrats witnessed in 2016 how Hillary Clinton\u2019s warnings to voters about the dangers of Trump didn\u2019t turn out or win over the voters they needed. In 2018, Democrats won back the House of Representatives not by campaigning strictly against Trump, but by focusing on health care and other policy issues.\n\nSubscribe to the Post Most newsletter: Today\u2019s most popular stories on The Washington Post\n\nCould talking about Kavanaugh be a more politically effective way to talk about Trump? Axios reports that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is worried about Trump fatigue in 2020, too, so she has a plan to shift political messaging away from Trump and more toward Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), the self-described \u201cgrim reaper\u201d of Democratic legislation. There\u2019s evidence the base is fired up about confronting McConnell. The Democratic challenger for his Senate seat, Amy McGrath, raised a wild $2.5 million in the first 24 hours of her campaign.\n\nFrom there, Senate and House Democratic candidates can connect the dots between Kavanaugh and McConnell, who pushed through Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination in the fall over allegations of sexual misconduct, and McConnell held another Supreme Court seat open during the 2016 election so Trump could fill it after he won.\n\nAlready, the Democratic challenger to Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), whose swing vote on Kavanaugh helped put him in the court, has folded all these things into a fundraising effort for her campaign. \"I\u2019m tired of hoping that Susan Collins does the right thing when she has shown time and time again that she puts Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell ahead of Mainers,\u201d Sara Gideon tweeted, with images of Collins and Kavanaugh.\n\nScreenshot of Sara Gideon Twitter account, Democratic candidate for Senate\n\nIf new Kavanaugh allegations have the potential to help Democrats motivate their voters, then why is Trump also driving the conversation? He tweeted about Kavanaugh half a dozen times Sunday and Monday, saying Kavanaugh is being smeared so Democrats can influence his opinions, that the Justice Department should have his back, and that Kavanaugh should \u201cstart suing people for libel.\u201d\n\nLike many of the president\u2019s political calculations, this one is blunt: Trump is playing the victim by way of the beleaguered Supreme Court justice, who already went through one of the most contentious confirmation processes in modern history.\n\nHaving his justice victimized by Democrats fits nicely with Trump\u2019s broader message about his presidency, that House Democrats are pursuing an impeachment investigation into him to undermine his presidency. And that\u2019s consistent with a message he\u2019s been selling nearly his entire presidency: that the investigation and report by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III was driven not by facts, but by a partisan effort to, well, undermine him and his presidency.\n\nPlaying the victim is really Trump\u2019s primary messaging strategy in some of the high-profile conflicts of his presidency. Republicans no longer control both chambers of Congress, so he doesn\u2019t have much in the way of legislative success to look forward to. The Mueller report, with all of its behind-the-scenes unsavory details of Trump\u2019s presidency, is out there. And he needs to explain why he and his administration are blocking nearly 20 congressional investigations into him. They want to investigate and impeach me and my Supreme Court justice, too, could be a helpful talking point in such a situation.\n\nOutside of Trump, there\u2019s evidence that the polarization around Kavanaugh benefited Republicans. Republicans in the Senate pushed through his nomination and kept control of the Senate (and even expanded their majority) a month later. Polling showed that Republican voters overwhelmingly supported confirming Kavanaugh.\n\nA Senate Republican super PAC took a swipe at Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.), the most vulnerable senator up for reelection next year, for just stating the facts, saying that Congress can impeach Kavanaugh if new revelations demonstrate he lied during his confirmation hearing.\n\nAll this is to say that both sides know full well that Kavanaugh will probably stay a Supreme Court justice for the foreseeable future. But that won\u2019t stop them from arguing about his fate for the foreseeable future. It\u2019s just too politically fruitful of a topic for both sides.", "description": "Actually, Kavanaugh fits quite nicely with Trump's political strategy, too.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAHnJ5R.img?h=329&w=300&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f&x=408&y=623"}
