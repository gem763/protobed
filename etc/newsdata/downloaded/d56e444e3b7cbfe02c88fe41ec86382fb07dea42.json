Anything below 50 indicates that the sector is contracting. Similar figures for construction and the UK\u2019s dominant services sector will follow later this week.\n\nTo put it in context, these are the worst numbers in seven years.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe assumption in the City was that, with Britain\u2019s car plants having ended the temporary shutdowns imposed ahead of the last no deal Brexit cliff edge in the Spring, there would be a modest improvement. That it hasn\u2019t happened looks ominous.\n\nBut, but, but look at Germany, tends to be the stock response of Brexiteers when confronted with figures like this. This is a cynical attempt to deflect attention from the problems they have created and the damage they are doing to the economy.\n\nIt is, however, quite true that the figures were also impact by a generally chilly economic climate.The global picture is not a pretty one and it is affecting manufacturers across the Western world including, yes, Germany.\n\nBut I would draw your attention to a very good point in response to the figures made by Simon French, the chief economist at broker Panmure Gordon.\n\nHe says that while it is true that the 7-year low in UK manufacturing is generally in line with the (weak) global picture, EU and Chinese PMI numbers have started to stabilise in stark contrast to the UK (and the US) which are still trending downwards.\n\nIn economics, the trend is just as important as the bare numbers\n\nWhich, of course, brings us to back Brexit, and the uncertainty it is wreaking. It inevitably serves to make a shaky global situation worse for British industry and the people who work in it. Behind the numbers are real people with real livelihoods which are under threat. That should not be forgotten.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Business news: In pictures Show all 11 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch.

It takes two of these in a row to tick that particular box\n\nAt the moment, it\u2019s a little early to be speculating. It\u2019s worth noting that the PMIs are heavily influenced by sentiment and while they are often a good pointer, the picture they paint isn\u2019t always reflected in the official GDP data.\n\nManufacturing is also dwarfed by services in the UK.
