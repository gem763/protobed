Moreover, we commend the extraordinary work by South Africa\u2019s civil society activists, investigative journalists, and whistleblowers, who have exposed the breadth and depth of the Gupta family\u2019s corruption.\n\nThe Gupta family\n\nAjay, Atul, and Rajesh Gupta immigrated to South Africa in the 1990s, and due in large part to their generous donations to a political party and their reportedly close relationship with former South African President Jacob Zuma, their business interests expanded. The family has been implicated in several corrupt schemes in South Africa, allegedly stealing hundreds of millions of dollars through illegal deals with the South African government, obfuscated by a shadowy network of shell companies and associates linked to the family.\n\nCredible reports of these corruption schemes include the Gupta family offering members of the South African government money or elevated positions within the government, in return for their cooperation with Gupta family business efforts. Public reporting has revealed Gupta family efforts to garner the cooperation of a potential Minister of Finance by promising millions of dollars in return for the individual\u2019s assistance in removing key members of the South African government who were considered to be stumbling blocks to the Gupta family\u2019s enterprises.\n\nIn another instance of an attempt to obtain the assistance of a member of government through illicit means, Rajesh reportedly promised a cut of a large scale development project to a provincial minister in return for the minister\u2019s assistance.\n\nWhile making this offer, Rajesh reportedly referred to two other politically powerful individuals present at the meeting as receiving large monthly payments, similar to the one being offered the provincial minister, directly from Rajesh in return for their assistance with a mining project. In addition, the Gupta family was overpaid for government contracts and then used a portion of the proceeds of those overpayments to donate money to a South African political party.\n\nFurther, the family paid money to a South African government official in exchange for the appointment of other government officials friendly to the Gupta family business interests. As a part of their corrupt business enterprise, South African government officials and business executives discussed ways to capture government contracts and then move the proceeds of those contracts through Gupta-owned businesses.\n\nAjay Gupta\n\nAjay Gupta (Ajay) is being designated for being the leader of an entity that has engaged in, or whose members have engaged in, corruption, including the misappropriation of state assets, the expropriation of private assets for personal gain, corruption related to government contracts or the extraction of natural resources, or bribery.\n\nAjay is the family patriarch who formulated the family\u2019s corrupt business strategies and controlled its finances.\n\nAjay Gupta and younger brother Atul Gupta, sit for an interview in Johannesburg.

Rajesh attempted to use at least one of those relationships to seek undue influence with additional members of a South African political party.\n\nSalim Essa\n\nSalim Essa, a business associate of the Gupta family, has materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, an entity that has engaged in, or whose members have engaged in, corruption, including the misappropriation of state assets, the expropriation of private assets for personal gain, corruption related to government contracts or the extraction of natural resources, or bribery.\n\nAs a result of today\u2019s action, all property and interests in property of the individuals named above, and of any entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, 50 percent or more by them, individually, or with other designated persons, that are in the United States or in the possession or control of US persons, are blocked and must be reported to OFAC.\n\nSalim Essa.

This figure is in addition to the numerous human rights- or corruption-related designations Treasury has issued under other various authorities.\n\nIn total, since January of 2017, Treasury has taken action against more than 680 individuals and entities engaged in activities related to, or directly involving, human rights abuse or corruption.", "description": "The US Treasury announced sanctions against the controversial Gupta family and associate Salim Essa", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7806/67c70981542a45c1a4c9ab2a7faa1e92.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
