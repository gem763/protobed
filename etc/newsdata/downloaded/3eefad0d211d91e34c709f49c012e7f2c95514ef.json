The near constant stream of visitors on a weekday afternoon reflects his position as one of the pioneers of alt\u00e9: not a music genre, but a whole mindset in Nigerian music. Artists who align themselves with the scene are known for blending and fusing a variety of sounds, from R&B, soul and rap to Afrobeats and indie guitar music. Alt\u00e9 (which stands for alternative) draws heavily on western and Nigerian influences, and puts creativity, individuality and a sense of rebellion are at its core \u2013 qualities at odds with Nigeria\u2019s conservative culture, where, in a country dominated by Christian and Muslim values, those who go against the grain are often treated with suspicion, derision or bewilderment.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Playing \u2018every genre of music with an alternative twist\u2019 ... Santi.\n\nSanti, who describes his own sound as \u201cevery genre of music with an alternative twist\u201d, released a series of successful singles before dropping his album. Freaky is a slow and moody R&B song about a cheating woman; midtempo tracks Rapid Fire and Sparky both combine Santi\u2019s ragga-infused flow with silky R&B vocals.\n\nProducers, stylists and artists pop in and out of Santi\u2019s flat, all dressed in the same distinctive style associated with Lagos\u2019s current crop of cool kids: the men in baggy trousers, trainers and T-shirts, the women in miniskirts and crop tops. If hair isn\u2019t hidden under a baseball cap or a bucket hat, it\u2019s either closely cropped, dyed brightly or, like Santi\u2019s, locked. Then there are the alt\u00e9 staples: jewellery, layered necklaces, the occasional septum or nostril piercing, and sunglasses; the smaller the frame, the better.\n\nThey greet each other with the affection of people who have known each other for years \u2013 most of them have and frequently collaborate, something that is key to the scene\u2019s success. \u201cThey\u2019re all just trying to be free,\u201d says Santi as he settles down on the couch. \u201cThey will stop at nothing to keep creating.\u201d\n\nSanti says they\u2019ve been inspired by the 90s music scene in Nigeria, artists such as Lagbaja and Baba Fryo. \u201cThey were on some next shit \u2013 there was no formula to anything.\u201d But as the Afropop sound began to dominate the music scene in Nigeria \u2013 and has since gone global with artists like Wizkid, Davido, Runtown and Tiwa Savage \u2013 some artists felt there was little room for those who embraced different types of music.\n\n\u201cIf you want to express yourself so much, and no one is giving you what you want, you just do it yourself,\u201d says 22-year-old singer and producer Odunsi, whose sound is a heady mix of R&B, funk and Nigerian Afrobeat; his recent single Tipsy was a collaboration with UK pop success Raye. \u201cI think that\u2019s what\u2019s happening: the kids outgrew a lot of the things that were being offered to them.\u201d\n\nEnter the internet and SoundCloud, where many alt\u00e9 artists got their start. They were able to bypass the major blogs and radio stations that typically pave the route to success, and release the music they wanted, whenever they wanted. \u201cThe charts would be split into \u2018SoundCloud artist\u2019 and \u2018mainstream artist,\u2019\u201d says 22-year-old Lady Donli, a longtime fixture on the alt\u00e9 scene. \u201cBut now you can be a SoundCloud artist and be popping. You can be selling out shows in Lagos, you can be doing tours in England, America. It\u2019s a shift in the industry.\u201d\n\nSoundCloud also meant that people outside Nigeria, particularly Nigerians in the diaspora, could access and embrace their sound. \u201cThe first set of people that were receptive to it were Nigerians outside Nigeria,\u201d says Odunsi. \u201cThey directly saw the value in us. You speak to a lot of young people and they\u2019d be like, \u2018I\u2019ve not been listening to Nigerian music for a while and I just started listening again.\u2019\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018If only one state is representing what the music industry is, that in itself is exclusionary\u2019\u2026 Lady Donli.\n\nBut this proximity to the diaspora, often thought of as wealthy in comparison to the population back home, and the middle-class upbringing of some of the scene\u2019s leading voices, has led to criticism. Some have labelled the artists as privileged rich kids and derided the scene as pretentious and elitist, something Odunsi rejects. \u201cIf anything is classist music, it\u2019s Nigerian pop,\u201d he says. \u201cThey talk about things the average Nigerian is never going to attain. The aim [of alt\u00e9] is not to isolate anything, it\u2019s to let more people be expressive. People aren\u2019t used to being free, they aren\u2019t used to seeing expression, so they don\u2019t know how to react to it.\u201d\n\nLady Donli understands why some might think of alt\u00e9 as elitist, but says it\u2019s not the scene\u2019s intention, which is to include anyone open-minded. \u201cIf you\u2019re about expressing yourself and not conforming to the norm, no one [in the scene] is going to be like, \u2018You\u2019re not alt\u00e9 enough\u2019,\u201d she says. Instead, she says, the lack of inclusion is a result of the focus on Lagos as the country\u2019s entertainment hub. \u201cYou have people making music in Port Harcourt, but the greater Nigerian scene doesn\u2019t know them because they\u2019re not in Lagos,\u201d she says. \u201cIf only one state is representing what the music industry is, that in itself is exclusionary.\u201d\n\nAs for the future of the scene, who knows? Santi sees it \u201cgoing crazy\u201d, Odunsi sees it ushering in an \u201cevolution of expression\u201d in Nigerian music, and Donli thinks there may be another rebellion afoot, one that will in turn sweep alt\u00e9 aside. \u201cI\u2019d be happy if that happens, because there\u2019s another set of people trying to do great things.\u201d", "description": "They\u2019ve faced accusations of privilege and pretension \u2013 but alt\u00e9 artists such as Odunsi, Santi and Lady Donli are walking their own path through an often conservative culture", "authors": ["Yemisi Adegoke"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f7ac201b30af031fc050e0e4975974b5c7decd7/0_208_1793_1075/master/1793.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=afed104f64a6c2ac304b51bd55491359", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
