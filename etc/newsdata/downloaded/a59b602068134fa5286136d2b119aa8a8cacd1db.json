I get why people are upset & I don't think it was @dev_101's time to go. But sending vile abusive tweets & death threats to @ShirleyBallas is totally out of order. Imagine if it was a member of your family on the receiving end,\" they said.\n\nDianne said she was very upset to hear what Shirley was being subjected to.\n\n\"Guys this is terrible you can not be bullying like this . It\u2019s awful and really upsets me to hear this .

We do our job. As you can see there were many people saved with lot lower scores.\n\n\"It's just so important. I respect everybody at home who\u2019s been watching fifteen series. Everyone has a favourite. We do our job to the best we can.\n\n\"We have to do it right there in that split second on the one minute 20 seconds. We have to make a decision.\n\n\"The three judges were unanimous. It wasn\u2019t down to me. It was unanimous and I agreed.\"", "description": "The head judge is hoping to make a miraculous recovery by Saturday's live show", "authors": ["Lucy Needham", "Image", "Digital Eroteme.Co.Uk", "Bbc", "Bbc Guy Levy", "Ken Mckay Itv Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20469876.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_RLP_MDG_18000JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
