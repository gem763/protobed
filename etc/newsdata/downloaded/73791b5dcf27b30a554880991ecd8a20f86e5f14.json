The House Oversight and Reform Committee sent a subpoena to Mazars USA, in April asking for documents related to Trump\u2019s accounts going back to January 2009. His lawyers sued to block the subpoena, arguing that Congress had no legitimate legislative purpose for getting the materials. But in a 2-1 ruling, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia said the committee \u201cpossesses authority under both the House rules and the Constitution to issue the subpoena, and Mazars must comply.\u201d\n\nBecause there are multiple ongoing lawsuits surrounding the president\u2019s hidden tax returns, it\u2019s easy to get confused about the various cases. Earlier this week, for example, a federal judge ruled that a New York district attorney\u2019s office, which is investigating Trump\u2019s hush-money scandal, has the legal right to access eight years\u2019 worth of personal and business tax returns from the president.\n\nAs Rachel noted on the show, Trump\u2019s legal team argued in that case that a sitting American president cannot be investigated by anyone for any reason, no matter how serious the underlying accusation. The judge disagreed, ruled in prosecutors\u2019 favor, and the case went to the 2nd Circuit on appeal.\n\nToday\u2019s ruling is an entirely different case, related to a congressional effort to subpoena Trump\u2019s accounting firm. The president\u2019s lawyers, hired specifically to help keep his tax returns hidden, sued to block enforcement of the subpoena, arguing that Congress lacks the legal authority to scrutinize alleged presidential misdeeds.\n\nA lower court rejected Team Trump\u2019s argument. Today, an appeals reached the same conclusion. A copy of full ruling is online here.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting for context that one of the jurists on the three-judge panel was appointed by Trump, and wouldn\u2019t you know it, Judge Neomi Rao sided with the president. In her dissent, Rao argued, \u201cWhen the House chooses to investigate the President for alleged violations of the laws and the Constitution, it must proceed through impeachment.\u201d\n\nOddly enough, the White House\u2019s counsel\u2019s office also argued this week that Congress\u2019 ongoing impeachment inquiry is \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d\n\nIn any event, to keep the president\u2019s tax returns hidden, Trump and his lawyers are running out of options. In this latest case, they can appeal to the full D.C. Circuit \u2013 seeking what\u2019s called an en banc ruling \u2013 or they can take their chances with the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nIf those appeals fall short, Trump\u2019s accounting firm will have no choice but to comply with the subpoena and turn over the president\u2019s tax returns.", "description": "As of this morning, we're one step closer to seeing Donald Trump's hidden tax returns.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/ap_411201684881.jpg?itok=yuSIqH3g", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
