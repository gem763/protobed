The utility back was a shock selection for the 2017 Argentina tour when he was selected by Jones while still playing in New Zealand with the Blues, but while he has remained on the fringes of the England squad throughout the ensuing two years, he was not one of the fancied individuals vying for World Cup selection.\n\nYet through a combination of impressing Jones and making the most of Ben Te\u2019o\u2019s omission, Francis has made the cut. \u201cI was pretty overwhelmed,\u201d said Francis. \u201cI found out the same time as it was announced. I was put in a WhatsApp group, but I was never officially told I was in the 31 \u2013 so was still awaiting the announcement.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The centre, who is equally adept at playing fly-half, found himself released by the Saracens academy. A two-season stint in New Zealand resulted in a move to Scotland with Edinburgh, only to be released and once again head back to the Land of the Long White Cloud to resume his career with Auckland while juggling jobs to earn a living.\n\n\u201cThat was huge. I was with Saracens in the academy and they realised me. But I knew what I wanted to do. I wanted to play professional rugby and I wanted to play for England. As far away as it seemed at the time, New Zealand were the No 1 team in the world and it seemed to be the best place to go. That is where I did my apprenticeship.\n\n\u201cIt was a gap year. I finished school and wasn\u2019t keen to go to uni immediately. So it was branded to mum and dad that I would take a gap year. I knew in my head what I needed to do and that was to pursue the rugby as best as I could.\n\n\u201cI had a deferred uni place, but I couldn\u2019t even tell you where it was. That was how interested I was.\n\n\u201cGetting released really fuelled the fire and really cemented what I wanted to do, regardless of people\u2019s opinions.\n\n\u201cI played under-21s and the next year I made the first grade, then Auckland academy and things went from there. My first job was at Starbucks in Queen Street, making coffees. I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m a professional coffee making but I\u2019ve done it. Back then the machines were proper ones, they\u2019re not the button machines they have now.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d train on Tuesday and Thursday nights and play on Saturdays but I\u2019d also train with the academy at 5.30-6am and then go to work and then train again in the evening.\u201d\n\nThe 29-year-old was selected for England\u2019s tour of Argentina after agreeing to return home to join Northampton Saints, where he has developed into one of their key playmakers and subsequently keeping himself on Jones\u2019s radar. There is something about the Kent-born midfielder that Jones has taken a liking too, as while three of his four international appearances came from the bench, Jones has been keen to keep him in and around the squad.\n\nThroughout the summer, Francis\u2019s name remained on the squad list as others such as Te\u2019o and Danny Cipriani fell by the wayside, while he has also been preferred to Joe Marchant, who remained with the team until their departure for Japan, and he featured in every one of England\u2019s four warm-up games, starting three and coming off the bench in the record win over Ireland.\n\nFrancis does not know why Jones has taken such a liking to him, but he does believe that his Kiwi rugby education has something to do with where he is now.\n\n\u201cI always felt the top was so far away where I was in England,\u201d he added. \u201cThe top level seemed almost unattainable. In New Zealand you get Super Rugby players and All Blacks who come back and play for their clubs. Being exposed to those guys made the gap seem closer. It really stimulated me. I was thinking: \u2018They\u2019re not the galacticos I thought they were.\u2019 It fuelled the fire to keep at it.\n\n\u201cAt Marist I played with the Saili brothers...it was just cool to rub shoulders and get snippets of information from them. At Maidstone I wouldn\u2019t have had the chance to play with Billy Vunipola and have a conversation with him. If you\u2019re in London South East 2 you don\u2019t get the exposure to the top guys.\n\n\u201cI was privileged enough to play with Rieko Ioane, Sonny Bill Williams and George Moala \u2013 top level All Blacks. It just gives you the realisation that things are achievable. However big things might seem at 16 years old don\u2019t let it go. Look where I am now: talking to you guys and in a World Cup 31.\u201d\n\nListen to The Indy Rugby Podcast throughout the 2019 Rugby World Cup.", "description": "England\u00a0arrived at their Miyazaki training base on Tuesday without any repeat of their Tokyo travel nightmare to begin 10 days of gruelling condition in intense heat, with Eddie Jones set to put the squad through a programme akin to a pre-season.", "authors": ["Jack De Menezes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/10/10/piers-francis.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
