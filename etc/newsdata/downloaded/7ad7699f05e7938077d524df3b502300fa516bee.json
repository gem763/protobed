Other moderate freshmen followed with their own carefully drafted statements. Most had strongly resisted impeachment and some have tough re-election races.\n\n\u201cIt caused other colleagues to change their minds and it signaled the gravity of the moment,\u201d said Representative David Cicilline, of Rhode Island, a member of the Democratic leadership. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a coincidence that all these events happened together. As they began to call for it, it created, really, a dam breaking in our caucus.\u201d\n\nThat has created a new atmosphere in the Capitol, where the moderates have spent months ducking reporter\u2019s impeachment questions, often refusing to mention the word.
