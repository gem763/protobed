Don\u2019t do it. You really actually only need about 200 extra calories a day over a normal American diet. And that\u2019s assuming that you\u2019re starting pregnancy at a normal weight.\n\n\u201cSex during pregnancy hurts the baby.\u201d Well\u2026\n\nDr. Dena Goffman: \u201cCocoa butter prevents stretch marks.\u201d This is a myth.\n\nRiley: I\u2019m Laura Riley. I\u2019m a high-risk OB at New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell.\n\nGoffman: I\u2019m Dena Goffman. I\u2019m a high-risk OB at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia.\n\nThis is so exciting, wondering what\u2019s gonna come next.\n\nRiley: I know, I know.\n\nMyth 2: It\u2019s OK to drink a glass of wine when you\u2019re pregnant.\n\nGoffman: Oh, my favourite. \u201cIt\u2019s OK to drink a glass of wine when you\u2019re pregnant.\u201d We know that the recommendation in pregnancy is that you really should not consume any alcohol. Unfortunately, there is no safe amount of alcohol nor a safe time in pregnancy when we can be sure that alcohol won\u2019t affect a developing foetus.\n\nRiley: Also, I think it\u2019s important to add that we don\u2019t think it\u2019s safe to drink while you\u2019re breastfeeding, either, because the alcohol does get into breast milk. And as Dr. Goffman said, we don\u2019t know what the safe amount is, and that safe amount may actually change for different women.\n\nMyth 3: Your belly reveals the baby\u2019s gender.\n\nGoffman: \u201cYour belly reveals the baby\u2019s gender.\u201d We certainly hear patients coming in to see us and having heard or having family members say that they can tell whether you\u2019re having a boy or a girl based on how the woman\u2019s belly looks. And we know that there is absolutely no evidence that the shape of your belly can tell us this type of information.\n\nRiley: The other myth that goes along with gender I think is the heart rate is high or low. My patients always say that, you know, they come in, oh, it\u2019s 160, it must be girl. Like, no. If it\u2019s 160, it means the kid\u2019s moving a lot, and if it\u2019s sleeping it\u2019s going to be 120. So it doesn\u2019t tell you whether it\u2019s a girl or boy.\n\nMyth 4: Cocoa butter prevents stretch marks.\n\nGoffman: \u201cCocoa butter prevents stretch marks.\u201d This is a myth. While cocoa butter is something that many patients like to use, we don\u2019t have any evidence that cocoa butter or anything else that we can recommend will prevent stretch marks.\n\nRiley: It\u2019s probably genetic, and, essentially, if you gain too much weight in one spot, i.e. your pregnancy gets really big, you\u2019re more likely to get stretch marks, unfortunately. But it\u2019s not worth spending a ton of money on expensive creams, because it\u2019s not gonna work. That was cheery.\n\nMyth 5: You can give a cold to your developing baby.\n\nRiley: \u201cYou can give a cold to your developing baby.\u201d This is a complete myth. Your baby is not gonna get the cold. Although your baby can get sick if you get something like the flu, which is why we tell you to get a flu shot, to prevent your baby from getting really sick. There are some illnesses you can transfer to your baby, but probably not a cold. I think people get the cold and the flu confused, which is unfortunate because the flu can make you really sick in pregnancy.\n\nMyth 6: What you eat during pregnancy can influence the baby\u2019s palate.\n\n\n\nGoffman: \u201cWhat you eat during pregnancy can influence the baby\u2019s palate.\u201d\n\nRiley: I don\u2019t think there is a shred of evidence to support that. I think that what you eat during pregnancy is important because it does sort of, you know, set your baby off to a good start in terms of its overall nutrition and good health. But it\u2019s probably not gonna change the baby\u2019s palate.\n\nGoffman: We always talk about nutrition and food choices and healthy weight gain, which really can have long-term impact on your baby\u2019s development, but not specifically the palate or what they have a taste for.\n\nMyth 7: Pregnant women shouldn\u2019t drink coffee.\n\n\n\nRiley: \u201cPregnant women shouldn\u2019t drink coffee.\u201d That\u2019s a myth. You can drink coffee. This is one where moderation is the most important thing. In the first trimester, having excessive amounts of coffee have been associated with a higher risk of miscarriage. Once that first trimester is over, should you go crazy with the coffee? Probably not. But it\u2019s not gonna harm anything.\n\nMyth 8: Pregnant women shouldn\u2019t eat hot dogs.\n\nGoffman: \u201cPregnant women shouldn\u2019t eat hot dogs.\u201d So, this is a myth. I think the concern with hot dogs are a few. You want to make sure that they are well cooked to avoid infection risk. And there used to be a fair amount of conversation about the amount of nitrites in hot dogs, but I think the evidence suggests that unless you\u2019re eating really excessive amounts of hot dogs, that it\u2019s probably OK to enjoy one. I think there are probably things better than hot dogs to eat, nutritionally, but I think if people enjoy one once in a while, I don\u2019t have a problem with it.\n\nRiley: You\u2019re way nicer than I am. I\u2019m not sure why anybody\u2019s eating hot dogs, frankly, but, you know, you can have one in pregnancy, but I think it\u2019s really important to make sure that it\u2019s cooked, because the concern about listeria is a real concern. So, that includes the hot dogs, the unpasteurized cheeses, the deli meats. All of those things are things that we worry about. So I think, you know. Yeah, it\u2019s a myth that you can\u2019t eat hot dogs, but you should be certain that it\u2019s cooked well.\n\nMyth 9: Pregnant women shouldn\u2019t eat smoked salmon.\n\nRiley: \u201cPregnant women shouldn\u2019t eat smoked salmon.\u201d That\u2019s a myth. You can eat smoked salmon if you like it. I\u2019m not a lover of salmon, so.\n\nGoffman: I love it. You can eat smoked salmon. This gets into concerns around fish consumption in pregnancy, which is a huge topic. And we talk to our patients about the risk of various types of fish. So, we want to avoid fish with high mercury content. So typically that would be avoiding excessive tuna, choosing chunk-light, canned tuna, and also limiting the number of cans of tuna in a week. There is also some concern about some of these oily fish, I guess, about the potential for toxins. And so I would say salmon in general may fall into that category, but smoked salmon I think is safe for pregnant women to eat.\n\nRiley: The whole fish story is a little blown out of proportion. And I think people get really crazy about this whole mercury thing. I would say it\u2019s important to also recognise, though, that fish has great nutritional value to it that pregnant women and babies need and want. So it is unfortunate that somehow the fish story has resulted in people thinking, \u201cI can\u2019t have any fish.\u201d It\u2019s really the large steak fishes where you\u2019re worried about the mercury. But then, don\u2019t forget that something like salmon is gonna give you the DHEAS, which you want.\n\nMyth 10: Pregnant women shouldn\u2019t pet cats.\n\nGoffman: \u201cPregnant women shouldn\u2019t pet cats.\u201d This is a myth. This would be terrible if all pregnant women in the world couldn\u2019t pet their pets, their cats. There is a concern with pregnant women caring for cats in terms of the litter box, and really the risk is toxoplasmosis. And the risk of exposure isn\u2019t with interacting with your cat, but with changing a dirty litter box.\n\nRiley: It is actually fairly rare in the US for women to come into contact with toxoplasmosis. The more important thing about sort of the cat stories, everyone worries about the cat and the kitty litter; the most common exposure that women get to toxoplasmosis is actually not the cat or the litre even. It\u2019s not washing your garden vegetables, because it\u2019s the cat that has the toxin that poops in your garden and then you pick that up and eat it because you don\u2019t wash it or whatever. So, gardening without gloves are things that we tell pregnant women to avoid because of that particular infection. The cat\u2019s got a bad rap, unfortunately.\n\nMyth 11: Pregnant women shouldn\u2019t fly.\n\nRiley: \u201cPregnant women shouldn\u2019t fly.\u201d Total myth, get on the plane, have a good time. That said, there are a few things to think about when flying. I think one of the major issues is that pregnant women are at increased risk for getting a blood clot either in their leg or their lung. When you fly, the air is dry. You\u2019re also more likely just to be sitting for a prolonged period of time. And that just further increases your risk for getting a blood clot. So I always tell pregnant women, be happy, go ahead. Go on those trips. But you should hydrate before you go. You should wear support hose or at least, like, you know, running tights or something that gives you a little bit of support in your legs. You should get up and walk around every hour or so. People worry about the air pressure, which makes no sense because it\u2019s a pressurised cabin. That doesn\u2019t do anything, you\u2019re not gonna break your water. And they also worry about going through the screener, right? Everybody\u2019s worried about the radiation going through the screener, but in fact the radiation exposure is actually higher when you\u2019re in the sky in the plane than it is when you\u2019re walking quickly through the security.\n\nMyth 12: Exercise during pregnancy can strangle the baby.\n\n\n\nGoffman: \u201cExercise during pregnancy can strangle the baby.\u201d This is a myth. Exercise is actually strongly recommended during pregnancy. All of our professional organisations, all of us as providers talk to patients about maintaining physical activity, maintaining exercise throughout the pregnancy, really unless there\u2019s a medical situation that comes up that changes those recommendations. So, exercise is not dangerous. And in fact, the opposite. It\u2019s really important.\n\nRiley: I think also this whole strangling thing comes from this crazy nonsense that if you get yourself into certain yoga positions, your baby can strangle itself. You don\u2019t have any control over the position your baby gets into. The baby is floating in a pool of water. And it doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re doing a headstand or you\u2019re just, like, chilling.\n\nMyth 13: Sex during pregnancy hurts the baby.\n\nRiley: \u201cSex during pregnancy hurts the baby.\u201d Well, that\u2019s a big myth. And it also helps to understand sort of the anatomy a little bit. I think this is where patients get a little bit confused. The baby is floating inside a pool of water, a big balloon bag. And that balloon bag is surrounded by thick muscle, which is the uterus, surrounds the entire bag and has, actually, a thicker portion at the bottom. So there\u2019s just no way that sex is gonna get even near the baby.\n\nMyth 14: Dyeing your hair is harmful for the baby.\n\n\n\nGoffman: \u201cDyeing your hair is harmful for the baby.\u201d This is another big myth. And we get phone calls about it. Lots of questions. There is no evidence, and again, we keep coming back to evidence because that\u2019s what we look to as your physicians. And there really is no evidence out there that the things that we use for hair-dyeing reach the baby or have the potential to cause harm.\n\nRiley: The other thing about the hair dye, frankly, I tell people, if it\u2019s gonna make you feel better, that\u2019s really important because, for a lot of us, how we look and how we present ourselves really has a lot to do with our psychological state. And you want that to be as healthy as possible during pregnancy.\n\nMyth 15: There are simple tricks to overcome morning sickness.\n\nRiley: \u201cThere are simple tricks to overcome morning sickness.\u201d I think that that\u2019s a myth in the sense that none of those things were probably simple. But I think there are ways to sort of decrease the painfulness of morning sickness. The first thing is that the morning sickness can last all day, so the whole \u201cmorning\u201d thing is a myth in and of itself.\n\nBut that said, some of the things that you can do to help it: Try and start the day with something really simple, like soda crackers, the minute you get out of bed. Saltines, something really bland. Stay away from the smells, the smells are going to make you sicker.\n\nI think the biggest thing that I\u2019ve learned over the course of my career, and had personal involvement with this one, is we tell people to stay hydrated and so they go after the water bottle. And stay away from the water. The water makes you sick, I don\u2019t understand it, but it makes you sick. So, what I tell patients is put everything over crushed ice. That way you\u2019ll get the water but you\u2019re not actually drinking it and gulping air as you\u2019re drinking out of a water bottle.\n\nThe things that I would put over ice, I would say lemonade, and ginger ale, letting some of the fizz out, will help as well. Lemon Popsicles, lemon slush, lemon Italian ice. The reason I say lemon is because lemon helps cut the nausea as well. I think the other critical thing for morning sickness is it\u2019s important to go out every day. I think sometimes what happens is you feel a little bit nauseous, then you feel worse, then you start to feel depressed, and then you can\u2019t get yourself moving because you\u2019re tired. And that\u2019s the worst thing you can do is to sort of give in to it. I think it\u2019s important to get outside, walk around, even if it\u2019s just down the block and back.\n\nMyth 16: C-sections are always necessary for breech births.\n\nGoffman: \u201cC-sections are always necessary for breech births.\u201d So, this is a myth, although I think most of us think C-sections are the most common and the safest way to deliver a singleton. So, a single baby in labour, especially at term. So there are certainly situations that we need to be able to individualize for. Often we\u2019ll talk to patients with twins. If the second twin is breech, that may be a great option for them. And I think there are rare situations where a woman comes in in labour where we may recommend and or support a vaginal breech delivery for a singleton.\n\nRiley: I think in order to support a vaginal breech delivery, you need to have a provider who has experience doing that. And, you know, the reality is that in the US, the number of providers that are able to do those safely is definitely diminishing, almost to none. I think the other option though, which I think we should put out there on the table, is a version which is if you know the baby is breech and you\u2019re at term, is coming in for a procedure where we, under ultrasound guidance, turn the baby to head-down.\n\nMyth 17: If you sit all day, you\u2019ll have a breech baby.\n\nRiley: \u201cIf you sit all day, you\u2019ll have a breech baby.\u201d Total myth. If you sit all day, you\u2019ll gain a lot of weight and you\u2019ll have back pain, but your baby will do whatever your baby is gonna do. Most babies are not breech at full term. So, only about, is it like 3% of babies are gonna be breech at full term. Those babies are gonna turn multiple times until they get to around 36 or 37 weeks. And so it has nothing to do with whether you\u2019re running a marathon or you\u2019re sitting on your bottom.\n\nMyth 18: Pregnant women should sleep on their left side.\n\nGoffman: \u201cPregnant women should sleep on their left side.\u201d I think pregnant women should sleep how they\u2019re comfortable, although we know that women, as they get more pregnant into the second and certainly in the third trimester, may not be able to sleep flat on their back. And that\u2019s because as the pregnancy grows, the foetus grows, the uterus grows, the weight that the uterus will put on your blood vessels and some other structures may make that really uncomfortable and not ideal for the baby. So women can sleep on their left side, they can sleep on their right side, they can sleep on their back, tilted a little bit. But we usually aren\u2019t so strict as to say left side only.\n\nRiley: I think people worry that, oh, my gosh, I woke up and I\u2019m flat on my back, did I kill my baby? You didn\u2019t kill your baby. If you sleep flat on your back, as Dr. Goffman said, the structure we\u2019re most worried about is the inferior vena cava, so it\u2019s this big blood vessel bringing blood back up to your heart and your head. And most people are gonna get really nauseous, right? And light-headed and feel weird. And so you\u2019ll naturally turn, so you don\u2019t have to wake yourself up to do it.\n\nMyth 19: Your hair and skin look better when you\u2019re pregnant.\n\nRiley: \u201cYour hair and skin look better when you\u2019re pregnant.\u201d Ha, I wish. Your hair might look better, I guess? Your skin probably won\u2019t necessarily look better. Some women say they glow. I think that they\u2019re\u2026[laughs] they\u2019re dreaming. Unfortunately, the high progesterone levels that you get when you\u2019re pregnant to support the pregnancy actually can really bring out acne that you haven\u2019t seen since you were 13 years old, and all the expensive creams in the world are not gonna fix that. So I wouldn\u2019t suggest that you spend your money on it.\n\nMyth 20: Pregnant women get flexible.\n\nGoffman: \u201cPregnant women get flexible.\u201d You know, we recognise there are lots of changes going on in women\u2019s bodies when they\u2019re pregnant, but I wouldn\u2019t say that getting flexible is one of them. There are certain things that happen in terms of your posture, how you stand, and definitely some relaxation of different parts of your body to prepare your pelvis to be able to have a vaginal birth. But I don\u2019t think that sort of traditional flexibility is what we typically see.\n\nMyth 21: Eating spicy foods will induce labour.\n\nGoffman: \u201cEating spicy foods will induce labour.\u201d\n\nRiley: Ha!\n\nGoffman: So, if this were true, that would be wonderful because we could help women induce labour when we wanted to. Unfortunately, we haven\u2019t been able to come up with any particular food or physical activity or drink or supplement that actually can induce labour. We have medications to use to induce labour, but as far as we\u2019ve been able to tell, there is no evidence that any of those things that women may want to try actually will be effective.\n\nRiley: I think people are just looking for something to get out of Dodge at 40 weeks, which I can totally relate to.\n\nGoffman: Yeah. [laughing] It\u2019s not going to hurt.\n\nRiley: It\u2019s probably not going to hurt. The spicy food probably won\u2019t hurt. You can do whatever you want, but your baby\u2019s in charge. Just remember that.\n\nMyth 22: Yoga can induce labour.\n\nGoffman: \u201cYoga can induce labour.\u201d We think there are a lot of benefits to potentially doing yoga and participating in pregnancy, but inducing labour isn\u2019t one of them. Certainly more women are using yoga, which may help with relaxation, may help with stress relief, may help with stretching. And so I think there are a lot of reasons why yoga may be a great thing to participate in, but there\u2019s no evidence that it induces labour.\n\nRiley: If only.\n\nMyth 23: Yoga makes labour smoother.\n\nRiley: \u201cYoga makes labour smoother.\u201d I think, overall, exercise probably gives you a better labour in the sense that it is usually more efficient. But yoga itself, not necessarily making it smoother.\n\nGoffman: There are some things about yoga that are similar to other labour preparation or childbirth preparation things, right? Breathing, mindfulness, I think are similar to some childbirth preparation things. So I think, in that sense, some of those things may help you to be more centered, be able to focus, be able to use some of those strategies to help, but certainly not make labour itself smoother.\n\nMyth 24: Natural births are better.\n\nGoffman: \u201cNatural births are better.\u201d So, this is a myth. There are certainly women who spend time thinking about what they\u2019d like their birth experience to be like. And I think for some women, natural birth, and the way we think about that is usually birth without pain medication, and for some women, this may be a wonderful experience, but we all know that we need to individualize the care for our patients. And for many women, a natural birth may not be better. There may be real medical benefits, depending on the situation and underlying condition, to having pain medication, to having an epidural.\n\nRiley: I\u2019m a huge fan of natural childbirth, I have to say, but I do think that it takes some preparation, and I think it takes mental preparation, and I think that it\u2019s not better or worse. I also think there\u2019s another myth associated with natural childbirth, which is that if you\u2019re induced you have to have anesthesia because the pain is worse. The pain is bad whether we give you the contractions or your kid gives you the contractions or it happens naturally, whatever. It\u2019s painful. And some people can cope better because they have practiced mindfulness or hypnobirthing or whatever. And then sometimes people can just cope better because it\u2019s faster. But again, I think it\u2019s all about everybody can make their own birth choices.\n\nMyth 25: There are ways to predict your exact due date.\n\nRiley: I love this one. \u201cThere are ways to predict your exact due date.\u201d When we give you your due date, it\u2019s plus or minus two weeks. And the reason is because your kid\u2019s in charge of when you go into labour. We are not. Though, I have to say, are much more precise in knowing what your dates are than we used to be because we use ultrasound, early, early ultrasounds, so much more frequently. Obviously, there are those people who have done IVF, and they know even more. But again, even if you know when it all started, you do not know when it will all end. Because the person who knows that is your baby and we can\u2019t at the moment talk to that person.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
