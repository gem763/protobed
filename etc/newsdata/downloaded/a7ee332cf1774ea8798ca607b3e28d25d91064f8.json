Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-CA) repeatedly thanking the woman who said we need to eat babies to save the planet.\n\nWatch the video for yourself, but this time pay special attention to Ocasio-Crazy\u2019s demonic and demented reaction to some crazy woman howling about how eating dead people is not enough.\n\nBy the way, the idea of eating dead people to save the world from Climate Change is no joke. Just last month at something called the Gastro Summit, Swedish behavioral scientist Magnus S\u00f6derlund did a whole PowerPoint presentation arguing we must \u201covercome our taboo against cannibalism\u201d and eat our own dead to reduce carbon emissions and promote sustainability.\n\nThe woman at Ocasio-Crazy\u2019s town hall was only taking this idea to the next logical step, a step that combines cannibalism with the Democrats\u2019 utter disregard for newborn babies. The Democrat party is now openly pro-infanticide, openly okay with slaughtering a child post-birth, so why not go for the two-fer? Hey, eating the baby not only aborts it, it\u2019s one less carbon-emitting feast for the whole family!\n\nReturning to this sick and twisted loon we call AOC\u2026 How difficult would it have been for her to show a little moral leadership and say, \u201cYou know, we\u2019re not going to eat babies, okay?\u201d\n\nInstead, and this is a direct transcript, she says to the woman: \u201cThank you, thank you.\u201d\n\nThen, while looking Eat-The-Baby-Lady right in the eye, she again says \u201cThank you,\u201d and treats the question as a serious proposal: \u201cYeah, no, so, one of the things that\u2019s very important to us is that we need to treat the climate crisis with the urgency that it does present.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, it is not as though Ocasio-Crazy is patronizing Eat-The-Baby-Lady to settle her down or something, because Ocasio-Crazy does look directly at her and correct her on one point: \u201cLuckily we have more than a few months,\u201d she says, adding, \u201cBut we do need to hit net-zero in several years, but I think we all need to understand that there are a lot of solutions we have, that we can pursue, and that if we act in a positive way there\u2019s space for hope. We are never beyond hope.\u201d\n\nSo Ocasio-Crazy is willing to hit the buzzer when Eat-The-Baby-Lady gets the timeline wrong, but not on the whole eat-the-babies thing.\n\nLaugh away, but 15-years-ago you would have laughed away at the idea of same-sex marriage, of the idea of biological men competing in women\u2019s sports, of your daughter being forced to share a bathroom with a mentally-ill man in a dress, of a CNN anchor arguing there\u2019s something wrong with a little girl made uncomfortable after being exposed to a biological man\u2019s penis in the girl\u2019s locker room.\n\nToday\u2019s left is openly celebrating socialism, openly condones post-birth abortions, openly cheers the assassination of police officers, and openly supports and encourages the jack-booted terrorists called Antifa.\n\nAOC herself is an open socialist and she basically runs the Democrat Party.\n\nAnd now, the head of the Democrat Party is so warped, so morally illiterate, her only response to eat babies to save Gaia is \u201cThank you \u2026 we need to treat the climate crisis with the urgency that it does present.\u201d\n\nShe couldn\u2019t even bring herself to say, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to eat babies.\u201d\n\nThe Democrat Party is now at a point where it won\u2019t take a stand against eating babies.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.
