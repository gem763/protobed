On this week\u2019s episode of Why\u2019d You Push That Button?, Kaitlyn Tiffany and I want to know how Close Friends is going. Who\u2019s using it? Why are they using it? Is the Finsta in trouble?\n\nWe chat with a few previous guests and our own close friends to figure out how Close Friends has changed their Instagram experience. We chat with Kaitlyn\u2019s sister, who previously told us about her Finstagram, as well as Verge senior reporter Andy Hawkins, who has told us about his Stories habits. Finally, our producer Andrew Marino comes on the show to deliver heartbreaking news about his Close Friends list and who is and isn\u2019t on it.\n\nFinally, we interview Instagram director of product management Robby Stein, who gives us behind-the-scenes details about how Close Friends came to exist and how it\u2019s going so far. He tells us that the name Close Friends took time to find, as the team had to think about how it would translate internationally.

I work on the consumer products at Instagram, focused on helping you share and connect with your friends and family and people that you care about.\n\nHow did you come up with the idea for Close Friends?\n\n[Close Friends] came about by really just talking to people and learning from users around what they were hoping to add to their Story, and at times when they felt like they weren\u2019t going to post to their Story, why.\n\nWhy did Close Friends arise as a solution to the Story-posting problem?\n\nThe number one thing that came up was, there are just some things that aren\u2019t meant for everyone, and there really isn\u2019t a great place for me to put that on Instagram. So we started developing an idea that became Close Friends to help you select a list of people that you did feel comfortable sharing more with, and it became the product that it is today.\n\nDid Finstas influence your decision to build Close Friends?\n\nI think Finstas definitely suggested that there was a need to have a smaller group of people you could share to. But I think one of the challenges with Finstas is that it also inherits the core properties of the standard Instagram account. So, people request to follow. The graph also grows. Also, it can become quite large.\n\nHow does Close Friends build on the Finsta experience?\n\nFor us, the biggest change between what Finstas do and what Close Friends provides is you create a list that only the producer can see and know about. You can add people, remove people, share to it, and no one really can request to join it or be a part of it. There\u2019s no social pressure to add or remove people, and there\u2019s no public listing of who\u2019s on that list, either. Those were all things that we thought were really important in creating a space that really felt the most comfortable to people.\n\nWas it always called Close Friends and was it always just for Stories content?\n\nThe first version of Close Friends was called \u201cFavorites,\u201d and you could then post both Stories and Feed posts to it. The Feed posts would go to a special tab on your profile with a little star that was called Favorites, and if you were in a Close Friends list, you could see that content on your friend\u2019s profile on the separate tab. We learned very quickly that product did not do very well when we were testing it.\n\nHow did people react to being able to segment off part of their Feed posts?\n\nI think the most important lesson was that, particularly between Feed and Stories, people really believed that the purpose of Feed was to help share some of the highlights of their lives. And that was so ingrained in people\u2019s minds, it might feel a little bit unusual to post a very raw, kind of goofy, blurry photo, as an example. It feels like it might be out of place there, even if it\u2019s in a restricted part of Feed.\n\nThen on the profile, we also noticed no one really went to the profile to look at the Feed content, and they just didn\u2019t really realize it was there.\n\nWhat were some of the translation challenges you faced?\n\nTranslation is really important when you name a product, and we messed that up. We thought Favorites was very simple because in English it\u2019s a very clear word, but in other languages, it\u2019s not.\n\nSo in one of the languages, we realized based on the translation it actually meant, \u201cmy beloved one,\u201d which when you translate it and view that strictly, people were only posting to one person. They were adding one person to the list. We saw in a few of the countries where the translation didn\u2019t work, the lists were one, like exactly one, which obviously would make the feature fairly hard to use.\n\nWe actually did research the name very deeply with people. I think when we asked people, \u201cHey, who are your favorites,\u201d it really to them suggested the one, two, three kind of size people in their social graph. When we talk to people about Close Friends, it was really closer to maybe one or two dozen. It felt like, \u201cOkay, this is really the inner-group of people that I would feel okay posting really goofy things that may be embarrassing. If I post it to everyone who is following me, I might be a little embarrassed by it.\n\nHow many people are typically included in people\u2019s Close Friends list?\n\nIt is closer to a 20 number for a good chunk of people, but there\u2019s a lot of variance. Some people really restrict it to three or four. Other people who have very large followings have hundreds of people on their Close Friends list because that really represents, to them, friends.\n\nI think actually the flexibility of the model allowed it to be adopted in the way that\u2019s best for you, which I think ended up being one of the benefits, and I think an important product lesson for me in terms of not being overly prescriptive with the product and letting the community best adopt it in the way that they need it.\n\nHow did you settle on the green ring and Close Friends badge?\n\nThe color green we experimented with among a bunch of other colors. It was really a selection that our lead designer pushed for. One of the reasons why was we have a lot of colors in Instagram. There\u2019s a gradient color as the logo. We have a pink-oriented light wheel, kind of, for the Stories ring. Direct has some of these blues. So just picking a color in a range that didn\u2019t feel really similar to something else, it was really important that it stood out and it felt different, and it felt like it was something that was unique in the product. So, green, when we saw in the experience was so clearly delineated from everything else, it was just kind of something natural.\n\nClose Friends never really feels bad \u2014 it only feels good to be included on someone\u2019s Close Friends list. Was this intentional?\n\nOne of the things we thought about when we were designing it was, \u201cHow do you make it feel like a really positive moment when someone sees one of these things pop up?\u201d You actually feel like you\u2019re getting something special. That was really fun when we started using it internally and getting closer to the final product that we launched. It was such a positive moment to come to Instagram and see these and feel like, \u201cWow, someone\u2019s opening up a little bit more. They feel like I\u2019m someone that they want to see more of their life. That\u2019s awesome.\u201d\n\nHave you noticed any user behavior changes with Close Friends?\n\nOne thing that we have noticed is that people tend to reply much more to the Close Friends posts in part because you\u2019re obviously selecting a group of people that in some way probably do care more about what you\u2019re posting. I think also because people do feel special, they feel, \u201cOh, this is a thing that\u2019s kind of unique to me. Less people saw it.\u201d They\u2019re more willing to then write back.\n\nOne of the positives of this, I think, is people are having more conversations on this content that kick off direct conversations, catching up with friends, family. Certainly when I post, people in my family write back that might not have necessarily written back to my Story.\n\nHow has Close Friends affected your personal relationships?\n\nI also have had different experiences where some people are really people that are in my closest inner circle and other people less so. For those people, I feel like we\u2019ve become much closer because of this feature, which has been a really positive part of my experience of it.", "description": "This week on Why\u2019d You Push That Button?, Ashley Carman and Kaitlyn Tiffany discuss Close Friends on Instagram, and interview Instagram director of product management Robby Stein about how the feature came to be and how successful it\u2019s been.", "authors": ["Ashley Carman", "Jul"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AhLrgLY9xkRQDkunjr-U2fzi7yk=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18367128/akrales_190730_3338_0102.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-31"}
