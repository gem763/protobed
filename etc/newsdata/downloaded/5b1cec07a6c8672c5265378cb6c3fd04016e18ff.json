He still lived with his mum.\n\n'Breaching right to privacy': In paperwork filed at the High Court in London, Danny's lawyer's Clintons have now filed for a gagging order against Lizzie's publishers, Soho Friday Media\n\n'Now I saw this right away as endearing and if truth be told what did I really expect? He was still just in his early 20s after all. I was double his age. I was in my forties, but it didn't matter at all to me. Nothing did, ever, when it related to him.\n\nLizzie said Danny was there to quietly open the door of the house just as she approached it, so that he could sneak her to his room under his mum's nose.\n\nTalking about their romp further, Lizzie continued: ' Twenty minutes or so into our naughty nine rated extravaganza, Danny whispered suddenly \"Be quiet\", it had to be said, rather loudly, and I thought he was talking to himself for a moment as I rarely made any \"noise\" in bed.\n\n'Naughty scale': The brunette, who recently split from nightclub boss Jeremy Gordeno, detailed her alleged romps with Danny in her book\n\n'But then I suddenly realised he was talking to me and the \"noises\" were indeed mine. Blimey, that's a turn up for the old books I said to myself as I carried on being noisy, and sodded the shameful consequences of a noisy discovery by Mummy C.'\n\nElsewhere in her book, Lizzie claims Danny also smuggled her into the England rugby team hotel at Pennyhill Park so that they could have sex and she 'hid behind a plant pot' so that the rest of the squad did not see her leaving the next morning.\n\nThe television personality said it was 'dangerously exciting' as the pair would 'regularly meet up at hotels or at his mum's house with his mum still not knowing'.\n\nLizzie has recently split from Jeremy amid claims he developed a close friendship with his ex fianc\u00e9e's 21-year-old daughter.", "description": "She claimed to have enjoyed a fling with rugby star Danny Cipriani in 2010, describing him in her book as a 'nine out of ten' and the 'greatest kiss of all time.'", "authors": ["Rebecca Davison For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/14/19991130-0-image-a-21_1571663642677.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
