Mr Gamble posted a screenshot earlier this week confirming he\u2019d forked out more than $23,000 in August trying to give the brand a leg-up.\n\nBut less than three months later, Mr Gamble has confirmed he is going to deregister the business name with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission.\n\nThe Facebook page has also been taken down and Mr Gamble told people in his Instagram comments he would refund anyone who had placed an order.\n\nGeppert has made a number of cryptic posts on Instagram since being called out while his partner Allaina Vader was a little more direct.\n\n\u201cForrest Gamble you little weird boy,\u201d she wrote in a since-deleted post.\n\n\u201cBen has plenty of friends and plenty of eniemes (sic).\n\n\u201cYou now have eniemies (sic) yourself.

I love you my little brother! I love you more than anything regardless of the things that have gone on in our family your (sic) still my blood,\u201d he wrote in September.\n\nLater, Geppert thanked everyone for their kind messages and said he was \u201ccrushed and heartbroken\u201d.\n\n\u201cI lost my 17-year-old brother tonight,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cI have watched mates and close people die around me but nothing compares to the feeling of loosing (sic) my little brother!
