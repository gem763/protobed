It took a while to persuade the man to give evidence. But when he did, and the investigation began, the trail led to two of the country\u2019s highest-placed prosecutors.\n\nA search of the men\u2019s apartments produced an almost comic heist: bags full of cash, diamonds and other precious stones. But that was not the only incriminating evidence. Documents seized at the scene indicated the men appeared to have a connection to the top prosecutor in the land, Viktor Shokin.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

One of the two men, it later transpired, was Shokin\u2019s former driver who had subsequently climbed the ranks behind his boss.\n\nFor Sakvarelidze, there were clear suspicions the two men may have been carrying out the business of their boss. But his attempts to investigate were frustrated. Soon, he faced a corruption investigation himself. At loggerheads with the top prosecutor, he was pushed out of his job within the year.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

That intervention into Ukrainian politics would come back to haunt Biden.\n\nFor a while, Shokin\u2019s year atop the prosecutor\u2019s office would be remembered in simple terms. It was the time of the \u201cdiamond prosecutors\u201d.\n\nBut all that changed with the intervention of US President Donald Trump. Trump\u2019s description of Shokin as \u201cthat very good\u201d prosecutor, quoted during his now-infamous 25 July call with President Volodymyr Zelensky, certainly surprised most Ukrainians. For the former prosecutor, it was a chance to rehabilitate himself.\n\nThe wild conspiracy theory on which Trump based his assertion \u2013 that Joe Biden had Shokin removed to stop him investigating wrongdoing in his son\u2019s gas company \u2013 has been already been widely debunked.\n\nPut simply, the chronology doesn\u2019t work \u2013 the investigation into Burisma, where Hunter worked, was dormant by the time Shokin was pushed out. It would also represent a major historical anomaly. During Shokin\u2019s 13 months in office, not one major figure was convicted. No oligarch. No politician. No ranking bureaucrat. It would appear unlikely he was in the middle of breaking the habit with the Bidens.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

He made himself useful to all three, the sources say. And he made himself especially indispensable to Poroshenko, with whom he has been linked since at least 2001.\n\n\u201cShokin was quiet, unassuming, and he always fulfilled his orders,\u201d says Oleksandr Martynenko, a prominent Ukrainian journalist who worked as press secretary to Leonid Kuchma, the first president under whom Shokin served..\n\n\u201cShokin understood the hints, didn\u2019t make scandals, and that\u2019s how he survived and climbed the ladder in the first place.\u201d\n\nBorn in Kiev in 1952, Viktor Shokin studied at the Ukrainian Academy of Agriculture, later graduating from the prestigious Kharkiv legal institute. After that followed three decades in the prosecutors\u2019 office.\n\nThe first chunk of that career was spent as a lowly investigator. Shokin\u2019s first break came in the late 1990s when he was chosen to head unit 30, a new division in the Kiev prosecutors\u2019 office devoted to organised crime.\n\nAnd then, in 2002, came a quite unprecedented leap.\n\nTo outsiders, Shokin\u2019s promotion from regional manager to the second most powerful man in the land looked magical. It was highly unusual for a candidate for one of the top public jobs not to have had significant managerial experience.\n\nTo insiders, the story was a little less mysterious.\n\nIn an interview in Kiev, the former chief investigator Sviatoslav Piskun, the man responsible for that promotion, revealed he hired Shokin after serious lobbying by Petro Poroshenko. At the time, the future president was a minor oligarch and deputy leader of the Our Ukraine faction in parliament.\n\n\u201cPoroshenko came to me with a clear request and the signatures of a hundred people in his faction,\u201d says Piskun, who headed the prosecutor\u2019s office between 2002-2005. \u201cFor the time I have known them, Shokin and Poroshenko were always extremely close. I must admit I never quite got to the bottom of exactly what their relationship was.\u201d\n\nPiskun insists that he never regretted hiring Poroshenko\u2019s man, saying that Shokin showed himself to be a \u201ccapable\u201d investigator. He mentioned Shokin\u2019s success getting to the bottom of an investigation of the murders of journalists like Georgy Gongadze, who was found decapitated in woods outside Kiev in 2000. (His family say those who ordered the killing were never brought to justice.)\n\n\u201cNo one ever investigated as much as we did,\u201d Piskun says. \u201cAnd I doubt anyone will.\u201d\n\nIt is not clear exactly when Shokin\u2019s bond with Poroshenko was first struck. But from the early 2000s, the two men\u2019s careers appeared to grow in tandem.\n\nFollowing the Orange Revolution in 2004, Poroshenko took control of Ukraine\u2019s National Security Council. Shokin got a second stint as deputy prosecutor.\n\nIn 2014, Poroshenko emerged from the EuroMaidan revolution as president. And Shokin, at that point a pensioner, returned to the limelight as deputy prosecutor for the third time, becoming the main man a year later.\n\n\u201cThey were together till the end,\u201d says former deputy prosecutor Sakvaredlize. \u201cYou can be sure there were financial ties. In Ukraine, it is normal for a major oligarch to find his own prosecutor, his own judges and so on. Shokin was Poroshenko\u2019s special deputy prosecutor. There was no surprise that Poroshenko brought him out of retirement.\u201d\n\nIn a rare interview in 2015, Shokin insisted he had not asked Poroshenko for the top job. His former superior Piskun suggests that was not entirely true. \u201cShokin wanted the job,\u201d the one-time chief prosecutor said, \u201cthough he wasn\u2019t aggressive in lobbying for it.\u201d\n\nLack of aggression was a description many would use for Shokin\u2019s approach to the job in his third spell. Two of the people interviewed for this article described the former chief prosecutor as \u201clazy,\u201d and disinterested in real investigations. Others noted a penchant for bonding with oligarchs over vodka in the bathhouse.\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t exactly highly professional,\u201d said one source, a current Kiev-based prosecutor who asked to remain anonymous. \u201cShokin would always sign documents without really looking at them. On the other hand, he\u2019d let us get on with our jobs, and was quite democratic, which we all appreciated.\u201d\n\nAnother source said Shokin\u2019s tenure as Ukraine\u2019s general prosecutor was \u201cno more but no less corrupt\u201d than what went before it.\n\nThat, of course, was not a ringing endorsement. Since the fall of the USSR, the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office has come to be considered one of the least trusted public institutions in Ukraine. In Soviet times, abuse of justice was ideological in nature, but the job was largely respected. Around the mid-1990s, corruption began to take over as the main driver. Over time, the institution degenerated into something resembling a legalised racket, sources say.\n\n\u201cWhen I joined we were doing 80 per cent honest endeavour, and 20 per cent corrupt,\u201d says one prosecutor, who began his career in the late 1990s.\n\n\u201cNow things have switched, and it\u2019s only 20 or 30 per cent honest. The main thing that matters is making the boss happy, and ultimately that means making the president happy. Everything else is for sale.\u201d\n\nThe approach of Shokin\u2019s office to the Burisma investigations fell into a well-practiced pattern of corruption, the anonymous prosecutor says. By the time of Biden\u2019s intervention, there were no active investigations to speak of.\n\n\u201cIf the idea was to get a result on the Burisma case, Shokin would have put his top people on it,\u201d he says. \u201cThat didn\u2019t happen. The aims were different.\u201d\n\nInvestigations into Burisma, which only ever covered the period from before Hunter Biden\u2019s involvement in the company, were finally settled in 2016. An audio recording purporting to be of Petro Poroshenko in conversation with another gas tycoon acting as a mediator, offered some clues as to the sequencing. In it, the two men talk about a \u201cglobal solution\u201d to Burisma\u2019s problems: redirecting cashflows to Poroshenko\u2019s companies.\n\nPoroshenko\u2019s spokespeople have described the recordings as fake, but not everyone is convinced.\n\n\u201cNeither Shokin nor Poroshenko wanted to investigate [Burisma owner Mykailo] Zlochevsky,\u201d says Sakvaredlize. \u201cThey simply began a criminal case, arrested a few assets, and began negotiating with the corruptioneer for a bribe.\u201d\n\nFor activists, Shokin\u2019s prosecutorship is remembered for its failure to secure convictions for crimes of the previous regime. These include the shooting of over 100 protesters during the EuroMaidan revolution. Society set high, perhaps impossible, expectations. But Shokin didn\u2019t even get close to delivering.\n\n\u201cShokin impeded those fighting for justice,\u201d said Vitaly Tytych, a lawyer representing the families of the victims. \u201cIt is wrong to call what he did investigations because if there is one thing Shokin never did it is investigate.\u201d\n\nSerhiy Horbatyuk, who headed the Special Investigation department which was eventually given responsibility for investigating the EuroMaidan crimes, clashed with the leadership of the general prosecutor\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cOn EuroMaidan, Shokin did not actively impede our investigations,\u201d he says. \u201cBut he didn\u2019t help them either. It seemed deliberate.\u201d\n\nBy the time Joe Biden arrived in Kiev in December 2015 to issue his infamous ultimatum, Shokin had lost the support of all but 3.5 per cent of Ukrainians.\n\nMany MPs were also clamouring for his dismissal.\n\nFirst among them was Yehor Soboliev, then a reformist MP of the Samopomich faction. As chair of the Supreme Rada\u2019s anti-corruption committee, Soboliev sought the dismissal of three successive \u201cdependent\u201d general prosecutors: Vitaly Yarema, Viktor Shokin, and Yuriy Lutsenko, a man whose initial promotion of the Biden conspiracy has also pushed him to the centre of international furore.\n\nIn July 2015, Soboliev pressed for a vote on Shokin\u2019s outsting. The arithmetic was always against him, as the general prosecutor was a figure of the ruling coalition. But he came surprisingly close, collecting 127 signatures from a required 150. Several members of the ruling parties broke ranks to support his move.\n\n\u201cWe were under no illusions,\u201d Soboliev tells The Independent. \u201cWe saw how Shokin had made an art of dumping cases while pretending to investigate. How he was a symbol of ineffectiveness and stalling. How he was the embodiment of the post-Soviet prosecutor.\u201d\n\nIn summing up, David Sakvaredlidze uses a similar formula.\n\n\u201cShokin was not a bad man per se,\u201d says Sakvaredlidze. \u201cHe was simply a man of another era, the boss of a corrupting, corrupt system. Shokin was a typical, post-Soviet Ukrainian prosecutor. But after Maidan, that was already a certifiable condition.\u201d", "description": "David Sakvarelidze was five months into a new job as Ukraine\u2019s reformist deputy chief prosecutor when a witness came forward with intelligence that would change the course of everything.", "authors": ["Oliver Carroll"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/08/09/Viktor-Shokin.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
