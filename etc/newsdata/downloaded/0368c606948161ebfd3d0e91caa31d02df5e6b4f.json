The first time was when I was 13 years old at the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo in 2009 with more than 72,400 people around me. The JoBros were at the top of their game with their latest two albums (2008's \"A Little Bit Longer\" and 2009's \"Lines, Vines and Trying Times\") peaking at No. 1 on Billboard.\n\nThey were also between two tours, 2008's Burnin' Up Tour and 2009's Jonas Brothers World Tour, which grossed a total of $96.6 million, according to Pollstar, sitting them at No. 9 on the concert industry publication's Worldwide Tours chart for that year.\n\nThis time around, my sister and I couldn\u2019t help but buy tickets to see them during their Happiness Begins tour, but we were honestly skeptical if the concert would be as great the second time around.\n\nA lot had changed in 10 years. For starters, we had grown up. Our crazy fan girl crushes on Kevin, Joe and Nick had faded (though not completely, admittedly) as we matured and so did our taste in music.\n\nSecondly, the Jonas Brothers had split up. Until recently, the boys weren't even a band. They called it quits in 2013 in order to go off on their own paths \u2013 Nick's solo career, Joe's time with his group DNCE and Kevin's fatherhood.\n\nSo could the newly-re-pieced together group really strike the right chord (no pun intended) with their OG fans who had been with them since the beginning? We thought they'd be great, of course, and that we'd have fun reminiscing on old favorites, but we weren't sure if their performance would match the one from their \"prime.\"\n\nWe were wrong.\n\nWe were both shocked and impressed at the seemingly sold-out attendance and through-the-roof energy at the Bryce Jordan Center in University Park, Pennsylvania.\n\nThey played a mix of songs from their current album, old songs (all the way back to their first album from 2006!), songs from their various branched-off careers and even a few \u201cCamp Rock\u201d favorites.\n\nDespite adding in some older songs, it didn't feel like the brothers were resting on their laurels. Instead, it was the perfect mix of nostalgic throwbacks and fresh, fiercely-loved new favorites. This sets them apart from other boy bands whose reunion-type tours have leaned more on yesteryears than the present. New Kids On The Block's summer-long \"Mixtape\" tour, for example, was focused more on stepping back in time than re-inventing themselves as artists.\n\nEven the Jonas Brothers' look was refined, swapping their rocker teen skinny jeans for more polished (but still cool) matching suits.\n\nIt truly felt like the industry veterans were coming full circle, showing off their musical history with a humble confidence that reminded us of why we fell in love with them in the first place \u2013 all while proving their musical chops with new music.\n\nOf course, there were a few \"Nick's so hot\" or \"Joe, I love you\" yelled from the audience to the stage, but for the most part, the shouts and excitement were overwhelmingly focused on the music and memories associated with them, as opposed to teeny-bopper obsession.\n\nAnd I'm not the only one who's a \"Sucker\" for the new era of Jonas.\n\nA Nielsen report covering January to June 2019 placed the single at No. 7 for top digital song sales. Their latest album also ranked No. 4 in the Top 5 pop albums in the report.\n\nThe Jonas Brothers also ranked No. 1 in the Top 10 most searched fall tours on Google, according to marketing data and trends provider SEMrush. And according to Pollstar, the band has already grossed a total of $53.1 million with the first 28 stops of Happiness Begins tour, with 23 events still to play.\n\nThe only thing worse this time around?\n\nThey\u2019re all married.\n\nMore: Priyanka Chopra, Nick Jonas get married with Hindu wedding in India\n\nMore: Ahead of the Emmys, Sophie Turner gets love from hubby Joe Jonas, Priyanka Chopra Jonas\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2019/10/17/jonas-brothers-better-now-than-they-were-10-years-ago/3830255002/", "description": "The Jonas Brothers are back together for their Happiness Begins tour.
