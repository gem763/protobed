According to new research, the number of people around the world who have died trying to protect land, water, forests, and other natural resources has doubled in the past 15 years.\n\nBetween 2002 and 2017, 1,558 people across 50 different countries were killed for protecting the environment, a new study published in the journal Nature Sustainability found. This is more than the number of British and Australian soldiers who have been killed in active duty overseas in war zones during the same period. And it is almost half the number of U.S. soldiers who have died fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan since 2001.\n\nEnvironmental defenders include people such as community activists, lawyers, journalists, staff from non-governmental organizations, members of social movements, and indigenous peoples. The study sought to look specifically at deaths related to individual people or communities due to acts of resistance and/or efforts to protect land or environmental rights as opposed to large-scale armed conflict rooted in clashes over natural resources.\n\n\u201cPeople are dying to protect their livelihoods, along with the forests, lands and ecosystems that are essential for all our futures,\u201d the study reads.\n\nIn 2017 alone at least 185 people were killed related to their efforts to defend the environment. And in 2018, a year not included in the study, 164 people were killed according to Global Witness, which monitors these deaths and whose data was used in the study.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut as the researchers note, these deaths \u201crepresent the \u2018tip of the iceberg\u2019 of the violence that environmental defenders face.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor every defender murdered, thousands more face direct violence, threats and psychological intimidation, and more invisible cultural and structural violence,\u201d the study states.\n\nThe varying extent of free media and human rights monitors in some countries also limits the amount of data available \u2014 some deaths may not ever be recorded officially.\n\nMore than anyone else, indigenous people represented 40% of all deaths in 2015 and 2016, and 30% in 2017. Most of these deaths occurred in the Philippines and Colombia.\n\nCentral America is the most dangerous region, with 36% of all deaths between 2015 and 2017, followed by South America (32%) and Asia (31%).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe most number of deaths tied to the agriculture sector between 2014 and 2017 took place in Brazil and the Philippines. Brazil is also responsible for the most deaths linked to logging. Mining and extraction sector deaths were highest in the Philippines, Colombia, and India while poaching-related deaths were most frequent in Vietnam and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nA large factor contributing to this violence, the study states, is \u201cweak rule of law.\u201d For instance it is estimated that on average just over 10% of these murders are convicted globally \u2014 this is compared to an average 43% of homicides being convicted worldwide according to 2012 figures cited in the study.\n\nAdditionally, violence is often perpetuated by corruption within local policy and judiciary branches, leading to many deaths being improperly investigated. Sometimes, it\u2019s the police or government that are directly responsible for the deaths or have financial ties to those responsible.\n\nMany of these deaths also happen in remote areas with little government or police presence, which means it\u2019s a lot harder to gather evidence.\n\nOne way or another, this creates a situation in which \u201cthe killers essentially know they\u2019re not going to get caught,\u201d Mary Menton, a research fellow in environmental justice at the University of Sussex in England and a co-author of the new study, told Scientific American.\n\nThe study highlights two political leaders who have particularly egregious records. Under President Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines, there was a 71% increase in the murder of environmental defenders between 2016 and 2017.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollowing the election of Brazil\u2019s President Jair Bolsonaro, fears have mounted that indigenous peoples defending their environment will be increasingly targeted. As the study notes, Brazil is consistently the country with the highest number of deaths of environmental defenders \u2014 especially indigenous peoples \u2014 and Bolsonaro has vowed to relax both gun laws and environmental protections, as well as label NGOs and activists as terrorists.\n\nWhile no deaths have occurred during the period studied in places such as the United States and the U.K., the study warns that the atmosphere in these two countries is becoming more hostile.\n\nIn 2018, three fracking protesters in Britain were convicted of causing public nuisance for their non-violent direct action \u2014 the first time environmental activists have received jail time for a protest in the U.K. since 1932.\n\nMeanwhile, in the United States, the Dakota Access Pipeline protests saw several demonstrators hospitalized after authorities used a water cannon in sub-zero temperatures to disperse crowds. And increasingly under President Donald Trump, new laws are being proposed at both the state and federal level to crackdown on pipeline protesters \u2014 from increased fines and jail time to increasing the severity of certain actions, such as trespass or planning a protest, from a misdemeanor to felony.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-112261443.jpg?w=1024&h=694&crop=1"}
