Domestically, American businesses from farmers to manufacturers to tech firms have been hurt by the tariffs and are urging both sides to refrain from further escalation.\n\n\"I have a hard time imagining that we will get to the 2020 election without seeing a significant impact to people's pocketbooks,\" Ashton said.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump \"doesn't necessarily need a deal\" with China as he seeks reelection in 2020, according to a senior director at the U.S.-China Business Council.", "authors": ["Eustance Huang"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106083734-1565981882575trump.jpg?v=1567396045"}
