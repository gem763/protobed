(Sarah Silbiger/The New York Times)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 For years, the Interior Department resisted proposals to raise the height of its towering Shasta Dam in Northern California. The department\u2019s own scientists and researchers concluded that doing so would endanger rare plants and animals in the area, as well as the bald eagle, and devastate the West Coast\u2019s salmon industry downstream.\n\nBut the project is going forward now, in a big win for a powerful consortium of California farmers that stands to profit substantially by gaining access to more irrigation water from a higher dam and has been trying to get the project approved for more than a decade.\n\nFor much of the past decade, the chief lobbyist for the group was David Bernhardt. Today, Bernhardt is the interior secretary.\n\nIt is not the first time that the Interior Department under Bernhardt\u2019s leadership has taken actions that benefit his former client, the Westlands Water District, a state entity created at the behest of, and largely controlled by, some of California\u2019s wealthiest farmers. Bernhardt also promoted the weakening of an endangered-species regulation that would get Westlands more water, a move that has put him under scrutiny from his department\u2019s inspector general.\n\nThe Shasta is already one of the tallest dams in the nation, and preliminary work has begun to raise its height by 18.5 feet. That would allow it to hold about 14% more water, and the 1,000 or so Central Valley farmers that Westlands represents would receive more than anyone else.\n\n\u201cPrior to the Trump administration, this project was dead,\u201d said Jeffrey Mount, a water management expert with the Public Policy Institute of California. \u201cNow it\u2019s coming to life. And Westlands would be the No. 1 winner here.\u201d\n\nUnder Bernhardt\u2019s leadership, the Interior Department has disregarded its own scientific and legal analysis showing that raising the Shasta not only would be environmentally damaging and cost-prohibitive but also would also be illegal under California law. California\u2019s attorney general is suing to stop it.\n\nThis year, the Interior Department\u2019s Fish and Wildlife Service was told to prepare a new environmental review of the project, but this one will be much more limited in scope, according to a person familiar with the plans, who requested anonymity out of fear of retribution. The new plan would not analyze the effects on salmon habitat downstream or the effects on several rare species.\n\nExcluding review of the dam\u2019s downstream effects is \u201clike analyzing the impact of a loaded pistol without looking past the nose of the barrel,\u201d said Jon Rosenfield, a biologist at San Francisco Baykeeper, a conservation organization. The effects of storing more water behind the dam \u201care major and extend all the way down to San Francisco Bay,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Interior Department is also pursuing a deal, long sought by Westlands, whereby Westlands would help pay for the work to heighten the dam.\n\nWilliam Reilly, who ran the Environmental Protection Agency in the George H.W. Bush administration, said the credibility of environmental decisions \u201calways rests on good science.\u201d The decision to raise the Shasta Dam is an example of the Trump administration\u2019s disregarding scientific evidence when making policy, he said.\n\n\u201cWhen you see a pattern of not accepting scientific opinion, you lose trust in what the government has done, and it\u2019s very hard to get that back,\u201d Reilly said.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s ethics pledge requires former lobbyists to recuse themselves for two years from working on any specific issue area involving a particular party on which or for whom they lobbied in the two years before joining the administration.\n\nThe Interior Department\u2019s ethics office said it had reviewed Bernhardt\u2019s past lobbying for a law related to the Shasta Dam and concluded before his appointment that the law \u201cwas not a particular matter or specific issue area.\u201d As a result, it said, the ethics pledge did not prohibit him from decisions about the dam, unless they were on issues that were \u201ca particular matter\u201d involving his former client.\n\nBernhardt did not respond to detailed written questions.\n\nBernhardt\u2019s spokesman, Nicholas Goodwin, said, \u201cSecretary Bernhardt is and has always been committed to upholding his ethical responsibilities, and he has fully complied with those obligations.\u201d", "description": "WASHINGTON -- For years, the Interior Department resisted proposals to raise the height of its towering Shasta Dam in Northern California.
