Grand Bahama, with a population of about 50,000, is only 100km (60 miles) east of West Palm Beach in Florida.\n\nForecasters had warned the storm could create \"life-threatening\" storm surges as high as 23ft (7m).\n\nClint Watson, a journalist based in the capital Nassau, said people in Grand Bahama were being hit with \"buckets of rain\" and posting videos online showing water rising to the windows of their attics.\n\n\"You can't fathom that but that's what people are showing us with their videos, saying 'Please, come and rescue me. I'm in the roof of my home and this is where the water is'. And you can see the water outside pressing in. It's stories like that and images like that that you can't get out of your mind,\" he told the BBC.\n\nLocal media report that the international airport is under water.\n\nDorian is travelling west at just over 1mph (2km/h), the NHC said. It added that the hurricane would \"continue to pound Grand Bahama Island\" through much of Monday.\n\nThe winds at the core of the storm are spinning so fast that the centre is collapsing on itself, stalling over the area and weakening the storm's eye. This is making it expand and cause damage over a larger area, says BBC Weather.\n\nOn Monday morning, Mr Minnis said reports from the Abaco Islands suggested the devastation was \"unprecedented\".\n\nThe Abacos are home to about 17,000 people. It is unclear how many ignored evacuation orders and pleas from officials to leave low-lying areas.\n\nThe International Red Cross also said as many as 13,000 houses could have been destroyed. \"There might no longer be any clean water readily available on Abaco because of storm surges flooding wells,\" spokesman Matthew Cochrane told the BBC.\n\nHe said that aid workers were expecting \"significant humanitarian needs\" in the Bahamas once the storm passes.\n\nThe UK Department for International Development said it was sending three humanitarian experts to the Bahamas.\n\nOne video as the storm hit the Abacos carried a desperate plea for help:\n\nHow has the Bahamas prepared?\n\nThe country is one of those most regularly hit by hurricanes, and homes are required to be reinforced to withstand the winds of a category four storm.\n\nMr Minnis did announce an evacuation order for parts of Grand Bahama and the Abaco Islands. All tourists were asked to leave.\n\nThe prime minister said on Sunday of residents who chose to stay: \"I can only say to them, that I hope this is not the last time they will hear my voice and may God be with them.\"\n\nThere has been no official confirmation of casualties but TV station Eyewitness News carried an interview with a woman who said her eight-year-old grandson had drowned on the Abaco Islands.\n\nIs Dorian going to hit the US?\n\nThe storm is currently moving west but it is forecast to make a gradual turn north or north-west, taking it along the eastern US seaboard.\n\nBut its path is difficult to predict and it's unclear if it will make landfall.\n\n\"Surge-related flooding depends on the how close the centre of Dorian comes to the Florida east coast,\" the NHC said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump told reporters on Sunday that the storm \"looks monstrous\" and the US east coast would \"be ultimately impacted and some of it very, very severely\".\n\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis warned people not to be complacent following the change in the storm's predicted path. \"This storm at this magnitude could really cause massive destruction,\" he said.\n\nPopular attractions, including Disney World in Orlando, have said they are \"closely monitoring\" the storm. Miami has ordered the removal of electric rental scooters from the streets to avoid them becoming projectiles.\n\nSouth Carolina on Sunday issued a mandatory evacuation of the entire coast, effective of noon on Monday and affecting 830,000 people. Georgia then followed suit.\n\nIs climate change making hurricanes worse?\n\nScientists cannot say whether climate change is increasing the number of hurricanes.\n\nBut the ones that do happen are more likely to be more powerful and more destructive because of our warming climate, says BBC Weather's Tomasz Schafernaker.\n\nHere's why:\n\nAn increase in sea surface temperatures strengthens the wind speeds within storms and also raises the amount of precipitation a hurricane will dump\n\nSea levels are expected to increase by one to four feet over the next century, bringing the potential of far worse damage from sea surges and coastal flooding during storms\n\nUse our guide to see how these deadly storms form, their devastating effects and how they are measured:\n\nHurricanes A guide to the world's deadliest storms Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.\n\nWarm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. \"Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face.\"\n\nFlorida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017) The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms.\n\nThis eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land.\n\nThese storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds. \"Urgent warning about the rapid rise of water on the SW FL coast with the passage of #Irma's eye. MOVE AWAY FROM THE WATER!\"\n\nTweet from the National Hurricane Center The size of hurricanes is mainly measured by the Saffir-Simpson scale - other scales are used in Asia Pacific and Australia. Winds 119-153km/h\n\nSome minor flooding, little structural damage.\n\nStorm surge +1.2m-1.5m Winds 154-177km/h\n\nRoofs and trees could be damaged.\n\nStorm surge +1.8m-2.4m Winds 178-208km/h\n\nHouses suffer damage, severe flooding\n\nStorm surge +2.7m-3.7m Hurricane Sandy (2012) caused $71bn damage in the Caribbean and New York Winds 209-251km/h\n\nSome roofs destroyed and major structural damage to houses.\n\nStorm surge +4m-5.5m Hurricane Ike (2008) hit Caribbean islands and Louisiana and was blamed for at least 195 deaths Winds 252km/h+\n\nSerious damage to buildings, severe flooding further inland.\n\nStorm surge +5.5m Hurricane Irma (2017) caused devastation in Caribbean islands, leaving thousands homeless \"For everyone thinking they can ride this storm out, I have news for you: that will be one of the biggest mistakes you can make in your life.\"\n\nMayor of New Orleans Ray Nagin ahead of Hurricane Gustav, 2008 Click arrow to proceed Loading ...
