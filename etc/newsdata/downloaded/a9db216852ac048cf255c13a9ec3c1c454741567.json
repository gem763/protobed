(AP Photo/Maya Alleruzzo, File)\n\nCAIRO (AP) \u2014 Sudan's new, transitional authorities have six months to make peace with the country's rebels under a power-sharing deal reached this summer between the military and the pro-democracy movement following the ouster of longtime autocrat Omar al-Bashir in April.\n\nIf they fail to do so, it could undermine the deal and put the country's fragile transition in jeopardy.\n\nTalks with the rebels are to officially start Monday in neighboring South Sudan's capital. Sudanese government officials met informally with a rebel leader in Juba this week to prepare for the talks. This came after some rebel groups signed a draft agreement in Juba last month, detailing a roadmap for the talks, trust-building measures and an extension of a cease-fire already in place.\n\nHere is a look at what's at stake in Sudan and for the country's main rebel groups:\n\nHISTORY OF REBELLIONS\n\nSince its independence from British colonial rule in 1956, Sudan has been convulsed by long rebellions and fighting between the mostly Christian and animist south and the Muslim and Arabized north.\n\nThe country's longest internal conflict, a civil war that spanned decades, led to South Sudan gaining independence from the north in 2011.\n\nHowever, in the 2000s, Sudan was most known for al-Bashir's brutal repression of an uprising in the western Darfur region, where pro-government militias known as the Janjaweed became notorious for their atrocities and al-Bashir himself was indicted by the International Criminal Court for war crimes and genocide.\n\n___\n\nPEACE TALKS WITH THE REBELS\n\nSudanese rebels have for years fought al-Bashir's loyalists, not just in Darfur but also in the southern provinces of Blue Nile and South Kordofan.\n\nThe rebels did not sign on to the power-sharing deal with the military, reached in July, though they have observed a cease-fire since before al-Bashir's overthrow, in solidarity with the protest movement.\n\nAhead of Monday's talks in Juba, Khartoum has been in a flurry of diplomacy, with Sudanese leaders visiting France, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates recently to enlist their support.\n\n___\n\nTHE SUDAN REVOLUTIONARY FRONT\n\nThe Sudan Revolutionary Front was established in November 2011 following fighting in South Kordofan and Blue Nile provinces that broke out after South Sudan's secession from Sudan.\n\nIt's an alliance of rebel groups in the region, including the Justice and Equality Movement, the Sudan Liberation Army-Mini Minawi, named after its leader, and a faction of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North, led by Malik Agar.\n\nThe Sudan Revolutionary Front joined the protest movement against al-Bashir but did not fully support the power-sharing deal with the military. It did, however, engage in talks with protest leaders and the generals before and after the August signing of the power-sharing deal.\n\nSRF leader Yesir Arman has called for a role in the transitional government , and wants its fighters to be included in the country's military, something the Sudanese generals are unlikely to accept.\n\n___\n\nSUDAN LIBERATION MOVEMENT-NORTH ABDEL-AZIZ AL-HILU\n\nThe Sudan Liberation Movement-North split in 2017 into two factions, one led by Abdel-Aziz al-Hilu and the other by Agar, which later joined the Sudan Revolutionary Front.\n\nAl-Hilu's movement is Sudan's largest single rebel group and is active in the Blue Nile and South Kordofan provinces, where it controls significant chunks of territory.\n\nSince al-Bashir's ouster, al-Hilu has refused to hold talks with either the military council or the pro-democracy movement, saying vaguely he would only engage with a transitional government \"backed by the Sudanese people.\"\n\nAl-Hilu has called for a secular state with no role of religion in lawmaking, the disbanding of all al-Bashir's militias and the re-vamping of the country's military.\n\nThe group has said if its demands aren't met, it would call for self-determination in areas it controls.\n\n___\n\nSUDAN LIBERATION MOVEMENT/ARMY\n\nThis group is led by Abdel Wahid al-Nur and it also rejected the transitional government, staying out of preparatory talks in September between Khartoum representatives and the rebels in Juba.\n\nAl-Nur has called for the government to first clean up house, including disbanding al-Bashir's militias and his National Congress Party. He also wants al-Bashir to be handed over to the International Criminal Court.", "description": "Sudan's new, transitional authorities have six months to make peace with the country's rebels under a power-sharing deal reached this summer between the military and the pro-democracy movement following the ouster of longtime autocrat Omar al-Bashir in April.
