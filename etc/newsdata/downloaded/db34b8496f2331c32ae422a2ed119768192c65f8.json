REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration late on Friday said it would require operators of some Boeing (BA.N) 737 NG jetliners to conduct inspections for structural cracks and make repairs as needed following the discovery of cracks on a small number of planes.\n\nThe FAA said Boeing notified it of the issue \u201cafter it discovered the cracks while conducting modifications on a heavily used aircraft.\u201d Subsequent inspections \u201cuncovered similar cracks in a small number of additional planes.\u201d Boeing said on Friday it has been in contact with 737 NG operators about a cracking issue, but added that \u201cno in-service issues have been reported.\u201d\n\nNeither the FAA nor Boeing immediately said how many planes were impacted by the required inspections.\n\nThe 737 NG, or Next Generation, was introduced in 1997 and is the third generation version of the best-selling Boeing airplane. The 737 MAX, which was grounded in March after two fatal crashes in five months, is not affected by this issue, Boeing said.\n\nThe FAA said it would ask operators of the NG to \u201creport their findings to the agency immediately\u201d after completing inspections. Boeing said \u201cover the coming days, we will work closely with our customers to implement a recommended inspection plan for certain airplanes in the fleet.\u201d\n\nKOMO News reported on Friday the issue involved cracked \u201cpickle forks\u201d in some 737 NG jets. The pickle fork attaches the plane\u2019s fuselage, or body, to the wing structure and manages forces. A failure of the part in flight could pose a serious risk. KOMO said workers found a severely cracked pickle fork on a Boeing 737NG earlier this month.", "description": "The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration late on Friday said it would require operators of some Boeing 737 NG jetliners to conduct inspections for structural cracks and make repairs as needed following the discovery of cracks on a small number of planes.", "authors": ["David Shepardson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190928&t=2&i=1434730859&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8R035", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
