Here's a quick rundown of what to include in each.", "language": "en", "text": "When raising venture capital, you'll need more than one version of a pitch deck.\n\nEach version will go into a different level of detail about your startup.\n\nFor example, the teaser deck will include just the basic information, and the meeting deck won't be understandable without narration.\n\nClick here for more BI Prime stories.\n\nA startup's pitch deck plays a major role in the fundraising process.\n\nThe deck is your chance to communicate the basics, like who's on the team and which problem you're trying to solve. It's also an opportunity to show that you're thoughtful and an effective salesperson. If the deck is sloppy or hard to follow, investors may assume that's how you'll approach building a company too.\n\nAmong the best pieces of advice on building a pitch deck that wows is to create more than one.\n\nYou might not need all of these, but it's a good idea to have three versions of your deck:\n\nOne to send investors in advance of your pitch meeting One to present to investors in person One to send investors in a follow-up email\n\nRead more: The first-time founder's ultimate guide to pitching a VC\n\nThe main difference between the three versions is how much detail you go into in each slide.\n\nA 'teaser deck' should have the minimum amount of information to attract interest\n\nThe deck that you email in advance of your pitch meeting is what the venture capitalist Mark Suster calls a \"teaser deck.\"\n\nIn a blog post, Suster wrote that the teaser deck should address questions such as who you are, what you do, why you and your product are unique, and why the market opportunity is sizeable.\n\nSuster, a general partner at Upfront Ventures (an early investor in Ring) and an entrepreneur who sold his last company to Salesforce, said that getting a deck like that leaked publicly could and should be a good thing.\n\n\"More people will see just how amazing you are,\" he added. \"Nothing in it should reveal some 'secret sauce' that your competitors could magically copy and destroy you.\"\n\nA meeting deck shouldn't be understandable without narration\n\nEvery meeting deck \u2014 the deck you present to investors in person \u2014 should outline your vision for the future, Suster wrote. That includes your financial plans, plus how much you're raising and how you'll use the funds.\n\nThis version of your deck shouldn't be understandable without narration, meaning it should have as little text as possible, said Liz Wessel, the cofounder and CEO of WayUp, a jobs platform for early-career professionals. Otherwise, investors may spend all their time focused on trying to read the screen, rather than on listening to your vision.\n\nYou may also want to send investors a more detailed deck after the pitch meeting. They can peruse this document at their leisure or during follow-up calls with you and your team.\n\nAnd while the teaser deck may be more innocuous, you'll want to be careful about sending financial information via email. Kim Taylor, the cofounder and CEO of Cluster, which recruits for advanced manufacturing roles, recommends DocSend to help founders control company documents and protect the company if a fund is no longer interested in investing.\n\nThe key takeaways here are be prepared and personalize your pitch. You may not win over every investor you meet with, but building a startup means playing the long game. If venture capitalists are impressed with you today, they'll be more inclined to connect you with someone in their network or invest in you later on.\n\nEach deck should be tailored to a function\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\nTeaser deck: Convince VCs to meet with you\n\nMeeting deck: Contextualize your in-person pitch\n\nFollow-up deck: Serve as a reference for additional calls\n\nUltimately, each deck should tell a story about the business you're building \u2014 and get investors excited about being part of that experience.", "description": "When raising venture capital, you'll need more than one version of a pitch deck.
