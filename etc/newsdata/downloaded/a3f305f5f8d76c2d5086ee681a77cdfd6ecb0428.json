Or, rather, the lack of it, and the major financial elements tied to the club.\n\nIt is true that every single United issue ultimately goes back to the Glazer ownership. It remains one of English football\u2019s great tragedies that one of its greatest clubs was allowed to be bought in this way, and by parties whose sole concern is making money, rather than the welfare of a social institution. Protection should long ago have been put in place.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Ratings: AZ vs Man Utd Show all 14 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch.

They could still be winning. They are big enough.\n\nThis is one of the more galling aspects with the club of late, that a series of bad decisions have led to this, to compound the biggest issues; to undercut their own massive size.\n\nMost of those revolve around the managers, who have of course been decided by Woodward\u2026 who has been placed in charge of football operations by the Glazers.\n\nIt all keeps going back to that, but so much of it could still be better.\n\nThe bottom line is that the club have made the wrong managerial decision every single time since Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s retirement.\n\nNeither David Moyes nor Solskjaer were every really up to it. Both Louis van Gaal and Jose Mourinho were past it.\n\nThey haven\u2019t yet appointed one coach definitively at the top of his game, or on that exciting upward curve, as they could well have done with Jurgen Klopp or Mauricio Pochettino.\n\nAnd this has had further-reaching effects than just the individual managers\u2019 own spells in charge.\n\nIt has left them with this moribund, unimaginative squad, that feels like it just needs a total overhaul.\n\nThis is the problem when you don\u2019t have a director of football, or anything even resembling that role.\n\nMoyes wasted transfer business because he could never get Everton standards out of his head.\n\nVan Gaal wanted \u201ca squad full of John O\u2019Sheas\u201d, who could play in any position, and just 18 of them so he could then bring through youth.\n\nMourinho decided almost everything he had was \u201cshit\u201d, and looked to bring in his own, only to feel they were \u201cshit\u201d.\n\nSolskjaer has attempted to redress this and has made astute signings, but even a problem there is that they seem based on reactive rationale \u2013 young players, British players \u2013 rather than any kind of overall plan or structure.\n\nThis, again, is the problem with not having a proper football department.\n\nThere is an argument that something is now so broken in the club, and within the squad, that it would be almost impossible for any manager to have positive effect right now. You only have to look at Marcus Rashford. A player two years ago so joyous and expressive now just appears constricted and low on confidence.\n\nMany people might point to how Chris Wilder or Daniel Farke get relatively more out of inferior squads, but one key difference there is that there is a sense of direction and identity about both. They are in a good environment, that suits them.\n\nThis is not the case at United. But it still feels it could have been different.\n\nThe frankly needless move to permanently appoint Solskjaer in March now feels like a juncture moment for the club, the bad decision that brought so many other bad decisions to a head; the point at which so much began to give way.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t like they needed the boost at the time, after all. Things were going well. They had the space to wait, and properly consider.\n\nThey instead rushed into a decision with incomplete short-term information, and are now stuck with it for the long-term.\n\nThis is one reason why this feels such a juncture decision. It is highly unlikely that Woodward will make any mid-season managerial change, because he is so invested in the Solskjaer pick. He inadvertently put a lot on it, and needlessly.\n\nImagine an alternative history where United had waited, the 2018-19 season had panned out the same dismal way, and they looked elsewhere. Mauricio Pochettino would have been legally ring-fenced, but a modern manager as accomplished and sophisticated as Antonio Conte was available \u2013 and interested.\n\nThis is a coach who has a track record in repeatedly taking on basket cases, and having immediate and emphatic positive effect. He could have temporarily suited United in the way they thought Mourinho would, as they attempt to deal with so many other problems.\n\nThose problems have instead compounded, and all are placed at the feet of Solskjaer, whose credentials as a top-level coach remain in great doubt \u2013 to say the least.\n\nIt by contrast says much that a game against Newcastle United \u2013 probably the worst side in the Premier League right now, and the only club that feel more problematic than Manchester United \u2013 is so important.\n\nIt should be an easy win for Solskjaer. It is currently anything but.\n\nAnd if United can\u2019t offer a bit of hope and some promising attacking play there, there\u2019ll be no optimistic words possible.", "description": "It was yet another night when Ole Gunnar Solskjaer attempted to come up with optimistic words that felt far removed from the utter hopelessness of the performance.
