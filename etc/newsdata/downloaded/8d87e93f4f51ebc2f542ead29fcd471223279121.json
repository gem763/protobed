REUTERS/Simon Dawson\n\nWith Britain set to leave the European Union within weeks, Pinder Sahota at the world\u2019s biggest insulin maker Novo Nordisk, and Sanofi\u2019s Hugo Fry have rebuilt operations to withstand the most turbulent of events.\n\nThe two companies told Reuters they had spent millions of pounds, which they cannot recoup, stockpiling millions of packets of insulin - used to treat diabetes - inside Britain and building new shipping and air freight routes.\n\nTheir plans, formulated over three years, show the lengths companies across the continent are having to go to overhaul long-standing supply chains that may not survive Britain\u2019s biggest trade upheaval in half a century.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing comparable to this,\u201d Novo Nordisk\u2019s UK General Manager Sahota told Reuters of the Danish company\u2019s preparation. \u201cIt\u2019s unprecedented from a logistics point of view. We\u2019re preparing for the worst-case scenario, the most extreme.\u201d\n\nWith two Brexit deadlines already been and gone, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has vowed to take Britain out of the EU with or without a deal by Oct. 31 - increasing the chance of a sudden departure that brings trade tariffs and customs checks with the continent for the first time in decades.\n\nThe government\u2019s own planning shows that, in a worst-case scenario, lorries seeking to enter Europe at the French port of Calais could face delays of two-and-a-half days, creating supply disruptions that could last for months.\n\nThat poses a real risk for the pharmaceutical industry which imports 37 million packs of drugs from Europe a month. According to the government, three-quarters come via that route.\n\nWhile Britain\u2019s GSK and AstraZeneca are world leaders in respiratory and cardiovascular treatments, Britain\u2019s insulin is imported.\n\n\u201cIn the case of pharmaceuticals, you can\u2019t just throw things onto a boat or a lorry, you have to test and validate these routes into the country,\u201d Fry told Reuters in his office to the west of London, adding they had backups to their backup plans.\n\nBoth Sanofi and Novo Nordisk have reserved space on ferries going the longer route to eastern English ports to avoid the main Calais-Dover crossing if needed, and also air freight if required.\n\n\u201cWe anticipate that route is going to become congested so what we\u2019ve done is open up other routes,\u201d said Sahota. \u201cSo two other routes that we\u2019ve opened up are Denmark to Immingham (in north-east England) and Netherlands to Immingham.\u201d\n\nSKY-HIGH STOCKPILES\n\nNovo Nordisk, Britain\u2019s biggest insulin supplier, has tripled its warehouse capacity to hold 18 weeks\u2019 worth of stock - 3.8 million packs that piled high would stand 12 times the height of the London Shard skyscraper.\n\nEli Lilly of the United States and France\u2019s Sanofi, the country\u2019s second and third-biggest suppliers, have similar stockpiles.\n\nFrustration is growing that while they dedicate huge resources to such preparation, they are spending less time on their normal jobs.\n\n\u201cWhen we\u2019re doing this, we\u2019re not doing other stuff,\u201d Fry said. \u201cWe\u2019re not working on projects that will bring our most innovative products to the market.\n\n\u201cAlthough we are happy to do it, it is starting to weigh on our balance sheet, on our logistics, keeping all this additional stock in the country. It\u2019s not an ideal situation.\u201d\n\nThe companies are confident they will be able to guarantee the British supply of insulin to the around 1 million diabetes patients who need it.\n\nBut some patients like Georgina from London, who was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes more than 30 years ago, have become increasingly alarmed as the chances have grown of Britain leaving the EU without a deal to govern their trading relationship.\n\n\u201cFor me, I can\u2019t tell you how worried I am about that. It\u2019s life-threatening for me,\u201d she said, declining to give her last name. She added that she also worried about older patients she encountered at clinics.\n\nThe British government is organising a regular freight service reserved just for drugs as part of its preparations alongside industry for Brexit on Oct. 31.\n\n\u201cWe are doing everything we can to help ensure the supply of medicines and medical products remains uninterrupted, including insulin,\u201d said the department of health and social care.\n\nThe two drug companies did not say how much their Brexit preparations had cost, beyond many millions of pounds. With fixed contracts with Britain\u2019s health service, they cannot raise prices.\n\nSlideshow (9 Images)\n\nBoth Fry and Sahota have had to delve into arcane areas of transport.\n\nAs part of their planning, for example, they have had to factor in how many drivers are needed to avoid breaking legally mandated rest laws, how long refrigerated lorries can operate in one stretch, and what happens in the event of fuel shortages.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing everything we can,\u201d said Fry. \u201cI know more about ferry crossings now than I ever thought I would.\u201d", "description": "For two men trained as scientists, the bosses of Britain's major insulin providers have had to become experts in ferry schedules, trucking laws and warehouse capacity as they seek to guarantee the supply of life-saving drugs through a chaotic Brexit.", "authors": ["Kate Holton", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430755158&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G0I5", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
