Sign up for the Today\u2019s WorldView newsletter.\n\nAlready locked in a heated impeachment battle, President Trump found a new way to rile Washington this week. Late Sunday, the White House announced that it would not impede an imminent Turkish invasion into northeastern Syria. By Monday morning, my colleagues confirmed that the United States had begun withdrawing troops from the Syrian-Turkish border, where they had been stationed alongside U.S.-allied Syrian Kurdish fighters. It seemed the first phase of a possibly new and destabilizing military conflagration in war-ravaged Syria. By Monday evening, there were already reports of Turkish artillery shelling and airstrikes on Syrian Kurdish positions.\n\nThe moves followed a Sunday phone call between Trump and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose government considers the main Syrian Kurdish faction that fought the Islamic State to be as much of a danger as the Islamist militants themselves. That\u2019s because of their direct ties to the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, an outlawed separatist group in Turkey that\u2019s designated as a terrorist organization by Washington and Ankara.\n\nErdogan and his government long resented the outsize influence of the Syrian Democratic Forces, the name of the coalition of Syrian Kurdish-led militias that was instrumental in rolling back the Islamic State, as well as the outside support they received from the United States and other European partners. No matter the thousands of lives lost by the SDF, Trump now appears to have given Erdogan what he\u2019s wanted \u2014 an open invitation to weaken if not break Rojava (what Syrian Kurds call an enclave in northeastern Syria largely administered by the SDF) and potentially repopulate a belt of territory with Syrian refugees currently living in Turkey.\n\nA definitive U.S. withdrawal from northern Syria \u2014 or whatever it is that Trump championed in tweets Monday morning calling for an end to America\u2019s \u201cendless wars\u201d \u2014 could have serious ramifications. If Turkey pursues a significant ground invasion, it would overrun SDF defenses, fracture their fighting forces, compel a possible exodus of Syrian Kurdish refugees toward Iraq (a country that\u2019s hardly stable itself), and, as many security analysts fear, create enough of a security vacuum to pave the way for the Islamic State\u2019s resurgence.\n\nAny incursion into northern Syria by Turkey creates a nightmare for the region & US national security interests.\n\n\n\nIt will be met with most severe sanctions against Turkey\u2019s military and economy \u2013 by Congress \u2013 at a time we should be working together to solve common problems. \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 7, 2019\n\nThe U.S. convinced the Kurds to destroy ISIS for us, causing massive Kurd casualties.\n\n\n\nThen we conned the Kurds into dismantling their defenses, promising to protect them.\n\n\n\nNow Trump invites the Turks into Syria, green lighting them to wipe out the Kurds.\n\n\n\nPositively sinister. \u2014 Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) October 7, 2019\n\nFor that reason, many Trump allies expressed outrage with his decision-making. Nikki Haley, Trump\u2019s former ambassador to the United Nations, tweeted that leaving the Syrian Kurds \u201cto die is a big mistake.\u201d Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who has carried water for Trump on almost all other fronts, warned that a Turkish foray into Syria would provoke sanctions from Congress and a move to suspend Ankara\u2019s participation in NATO. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told reporters that \u201ca precipitous withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria would only benefit Russia, Iran\u201d and the Syrian regime.\n\nTrump predictably justified his actions not with a strategic vision for a troubled region, but campaign talking points. He told reporters on Monday afternoon that he was following through on what he \u201cgot elected on\u201d \u2014 in this instance, disentangling the United States from the Middle East\u2019s intractable conflicts. He said it was the responsibility of other countries, including Turkey, to deal with what\u2019s left behind. For good measure, he threatened Ankara with crippling economic sanctions if the Turks did anything \u201coutside of what we think is humane.\"\n\nWhatever Trump thinks \u201cinhumane\u201d may mean, it was a far cry from the somewhat rambling remarks Trump made at a news conference a year ago hailing the United States\u2019 Kurdish partners.\n\n\u201cWe do get along great with the Kurds. We\u2019re trying to help them a lot,\u201d the president said then in response to a Kurdish journalist\u2019s question about U.S. interests in Syria and Iraq after the defeat of the Islamic State. \u201cDon\u2019t forget, that\u2019s their territory. We have to help them. \u2026 They fought with us. They died with us. They died. We lost tens of thousands of Kurds, died fighting ISIS. They died for us and with us. And for themselves. They died for themselves. They\u2019re great people. And we have not forgotten. We don\u2019t forget.\u201d\n\nThe Middle East\u2019s largest stateless ethnic group, close to 40 million Kurds are scattered throughout Turkey and parts of Iran, Iraq and Syria. They are hardly a monolith; numerous political and factional divisions exist within Kurdish communities. There\u2019s little love lost, for example, between the party that controls the semiautonomous regional government in Iraqi Kurdistan and the PKK-linked elements across the border in Syria. But they all share a long history of frustrated national ambitions, punitive state violence and abandonment on the world stage.\n\nBetraying the Kurds is, at this point, an American tradition. In the early 1970s, as a favor to the shah of Iran, the administration of President Richard M. Nixon helped foment a Kurdish uprising in Iraq. But once Baghdad and Tehran mended fences in 1975, the United States turned its back on the insurrection, many of whose combatants were slaughtered or driven into exile. Henry Kissinger, Nixon\u2019s secretary of state, is said to have quipped about Kurdish disappointment then that \u201ccovert action should not be confused with missionary work.\u201d In 1991, President George H.W. Bush called on Iraqis to rise up against the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein. But the United States then stood by as Iraqi forces brutally crushed separate Kurdish and Iraqi Shiite rebellions.\n\nDonald Trump is not a Commander-in-Chief. He makes impulsive decisions with no knowledge or deliberation. He sends military personnel into harm\u2019s way with no backing. He blusters and then leaves our allies exposed when adversaries call his bluff or he confronts a hard phone call. \u2014 Brett McGurk (@brett_mcgurk) October 7, 2019\n\nWe\u2019ll see what script from history gets reread in the coming weeks. In early August, the United States and Turkey agreed to a \u201csecurity mechanism\u201d that led to Syrian Kurdish forces pulling back from near the Turkish border and dismantling some of their critical fortifications. The SDF cooperated in good faith but now is even more vulnerable to a Turkish advance. A statement from the SDF on Monday expressed disappointment that U.S. forces \u201cdid not carry out responsibilities\u201d and a grim resolve \u201cto defend our land at all costs.\u201d\n\nWhat distinguishes the current moment of Kurdish betrayal from earlier eras is perhaps its seeming strategic incoherence. On Monday morning, officials in the Pentagon and State Department voiced bewilderment over the president\u2019s tweeted announcements; reports suggested that neither the SDF nor other U.S. coalition partners on the ground were given warning of Trump\u2019s decision.\n\nBrett McGurk, Trump\u2019s former top diplomat in the war against the Islamic State, savaged his ex-boss on Twitter. \u201cThe value of an American handshake is depreciating,\u201d he said. \u201cTrump today said we could \u2018crush ISIS again\u2019 if it regenerated. With who? What allies would sign up? Who would fight on his assurances?\"\n\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday, along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions?
