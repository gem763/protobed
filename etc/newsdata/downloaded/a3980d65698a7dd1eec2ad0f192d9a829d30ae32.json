Leonard.\n\nThe attorney appeared on SirusXM's Reality Checked with Amy Phillips when he said: 'Everybody is going over to see him. Teresa, the girls. That\u2019s happening.'\n\nThe reality TV star couple have been married since 1999 and have four daughters - Gia, 18, Gabriella, 15, Milania, 14, and Audriana, 10.\n\nIn the moment: Andy commented: 'Those don't seem like happy tears.

There\u2019s a lot of love in the Giudice family, and Teresa and the girls will be there in less than a month, so he\u2019s certainly seeing everybody that he needs to see.'\n\nThe trip should not be seen as an entire Giudice family exile, however, as the attorney said the ultimate goal is still to bring Joe back to the US despite all the familial support in Europe.\n\nLeonard said: 'Everybody\u2019s goal is that he come back to the United States, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re working on.'\n\nInterview: Andy captioned the teaser he shared on his Instagram page with 'YOU DON'T WANT TO MISS THIS!

Joe is her husband \u2026 I would caution your listeners, everything you read and hear, take it all with a grain of salt. People typically don\u2019t have the full story or an accurate story.'\n\nMeanwhile, Joe was released from ICE custody and allowed to travel to Italy last week ahead of a final legal decision on whether he will be deported there.\n\nFamily first: The reality TV star couple have been married since 1999 and have four daughters - Gia, 18, Gabriella, 15, Milania, 14, and Audriana, 10\n\nJoe got the green light from a pair of judges a week prior to relocate to Italy as per his earlier petition, according to Us Weekly.\n\nThe Giudices' lawyer James T. Leonard argued in September that this move would allow Joe to begin earning a living for his family again, People reported.\n\nJoe was born in Saronno, Lombardy and has been in America since childhood but neglected to ever obtain U.S. citizenship, leaving him vulnerable to deportation after he and Teresa were convicted of various counts of fraud in 2014.\n\nBoth Joe and Teresa spent time in jail, serving back-to-back sentences so that one parent at a time could be home with the children.\n\nAfter his 36-month prison stint, Joe was transferred straight to the Clinton County Correctional Center in Pennsylvania and into the hands of ICE this March.\n\nJoe's deportation was court ordered last October and his multiple appeal requests have so far fallen on deaf ears.\n\nThe Real Housewives Of New Jersey Special Event: Joe And Teresa Unlocked is set to debut this Sunday at 8pm on Bravo - two weeks after Joe left for Italy after release from ICE custody.", "description": "Joe Giudice is currently in Italy awaiting the final legal decision on whether he will be deported and his wife Teresa is set to visit him along with their four daughters.", "authors": ["Sarah Sotoodeh", "Justin Enriquez For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/21/20197068-0-image-a-28_1572035047523.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
