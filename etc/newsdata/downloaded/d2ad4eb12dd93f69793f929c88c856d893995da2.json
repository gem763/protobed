Environmental groups and states argue that the Trump administration has not done the technical research needed to make its own findings regarding the regulations.\n\nThe proposal to freeze mileage standards at roughly 37 miles per gallon through 2026, slated to be finalized this fall, is part of a broader effort by the administration to dismantle a slew of Obama-era policies aimed at curbing greenhouse gases linked to climate change.\n\nThe two federal entities \u2014 the Environmental Protection Agency and Transportation Department \u2014 notified the California Air Resources Board and Nichols that the state\u2019s deal with the four automakers \u201cappears to be inconsistent with federal law.\u201d\n\nThe agencies\u2019 general counsels urged the board to break the commitments with the automakers, as the agreement \u201cmay result in legal consequences given the limits placed in federal law on California\u2019s authority.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for Ford Motor Co., Rachel McCleery, confirmed that the company had been contacted in connection with the antitrust probe. \u201cWe have received a letter from the Department of Justice and will cooperate with respect to any inquiry,\u201d she said.\n\nThe probe was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.\n\n[Major automakers strike climate deal with California, rebuffing Trump on proposed mileage freeze]\n\nCalifornia\u2019s push to set stricter tailpipe limits is important because the state ranks as the nation\u2019s largest market for automobiles and its standards often carry weight beyond its borders. Administration officials have lobbied other automakers not to sign on to the new framework: On Thursday, the issue came up during a meeting between President Trump and General Motors chief executive Mary Barra.\n\nThe fuel efficiency standards ranked as a top priority for the Obama administration. In 2012, it adopted standards to boost average fuel efficiency to the equivalent of 54.5 miles per gallon for cars and light-duty trucks by model year 2025. The Obama administration said that fuel efficiency standards it had set would save consumers more than $1.7 trillion at the gas pump and reduce U.S. oil consumption by 12 billion barrels.\n\nSince the Clean Air Act\u2019s inception in 1970, California has had the right to seek a federal waiver to impose more-stringent air pollution standards than those of the federal government. Federal authorities have almost always granted the waiver, and California based its vehicle requirements on the grounds that it was regulating carbon emissions rather than overall fuel efficiency.\n\nThirteen other states and the District of Columbia have pledged to accept whatever tailpipe standards California adopts.\n\nUnder the framework California established with the four companies, which represent about 30 percent of the U.S. auto market, the automakers have agreed to produce fleets averaging nearly 50 miles per gallon by model year 2026. That is one year later than the target set under the Obama administration.\n\nConspicuously absent from the talks with California was GM. Larry Kudlow, Trump\u2019s top economic adviser, said Friday morning on CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box\u201d program: \u201cWe did meet with Mary Barra. Mary Barra expressed to the president her support for our reforms\u201d on fuel standards. Kudlow said that Barra was \u201cdoing her best to open up plants.\u201d He said, \u201cLook, the industry asked us to lower the regulatory barriers to safe and cheaper cars.\u201d\n\nAsked about Kudlow\u2019s comments, GM spokeswoman Jeannine Ginivan said that the company remained committed to finding a compromise on nationwide fuel efficiency standards that California and administration officials could accept.\n\nIn a statement Friday, California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) pledged to press ahead with the auto agreement. \u201cThe Trump administration has been attempting and failing to bully car companies for months now. We remain undeterred,\u201d said Newsom, who later taunted Trump on Twitter about the move. \u201cCalifornia stands up to bullies and will keep fighting for stronger clean car protections that protect the health and safety of our children and families.\u201d\n\nWhen the deal between California and the four car companies was announced in July, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said that its push to roll back mileage standards did not mean that automakers could not manufacture more-efficient vehicles.\n\n\u201cThe proposal contained no language that would prevent any auto manufacturer from designing and building next-generation highly fuel-efficient vehicles, including hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, battery electric vehicles, hybrids, and plug-in hybrids in response to market demands,\u201d the agency said.\n\nMargo Oge, who directed the EPA\u2019s Office of Transportation and Air Quality from 1994 to 2012, questioned the Trump administration\u2019s basis for the probe. California still has a federal waiver to set tailpipe emissions, she noted, and a similar voluntary framework on low-emissions vehicles was forged in the late 1990s.\n\n\u201cThe idea that they did something illegal, and that the companies colluded, it doesn\u2019t pass the laugh test,\u201d Oge said.\n\nSome antitrust experts said that any Justice Department case against the carmakers would have to argue that the effect of their joint conversations would be to raise prices above what they would be if the companies simply complied with federal law.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never been considered a violation of antitrust law for companies to get together and promote a policy position, said Gene Kimmelman, a senior adviser at the nonprofit free-expression group Public Knowledge who once served as chief counsel in the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division.\n\nThe carmakers in this instance \u201cgot together not with themselves but with state regulators to set policy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s different from sitting down in a smoke-filled room with themselves.\u201d\n\nSen. Thomas R. Carper (Del.), the top Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said in a statement that \u201cthis investigation is nothing but an attempt by the Trump Administration to retaliate against these companies and stoke fear in others. If we should be investigating anything, it should be what is good for our planet in reducing automobile emissions and promoting job creation.\u201d", "description": "Separately, the EPA and Transportation Department notified California that the state\u2019s agreement with the four major auto companies on future mileage targets \u201cappears to be inconsistent with federal law.\u201d", "authors": ["Juliet Eilperin", "Reporter Covering Domestic Policy", "National Affairs", "Steven Mufson", "Reporter Covering The Business Of Climate Change", "September At Pm", "Juliet Eilperin Is The Washington Post'S Senior National Affairs Correspondent", "Covering The Transformation Of Federal Environmental Policy.
