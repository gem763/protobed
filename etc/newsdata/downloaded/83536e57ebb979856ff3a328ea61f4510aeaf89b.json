The worst conditions could see gusts of up to 140mph hit the Suzuka Circuit.\n\nAs such, qualifying could be delayed or postponed and one of the possibilities is to host a Super Sunday which would see the shoot-out for pole take place on the morning of the grand prix.\n\nF1's governing body the FIA are liaising with circuit officials, with a decision understood to be announced on Thursday.\n\n(Image: Action Images)\n\nThe FIA said: \"As normal we continually monitor the weather at Formula One events and are working with the circuit organisation, the Japanese Automobile Federation and Formula One to react as necessary should any timetable changes be required.\n\n\"This is not the first time that inclement weather has been a possibility at the Japanese Grand Prix so the procedures here are well practiced.\"\n\nIt is not the first time torrid conditions have wreaked havoc on the Japanese Grand Prix weekend, with Typhoon Ma-on delaying qualifying in 2004 until Sunday. The same then happened in 2010 due to torrential weather.\n\nFive years ago in Japan, Jules Bianchi hit a recovery crane in torrid conditions before succumbing to his injuries nine months later.\n\n(Image: NASA EARTH OBSERVATORY HANDOUT/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nMeanwhile, England's Rugby World Cup clash with France is also at risk of being moved or cancelled due to Typhoon Hagibis.\n\nSuper Typhoon Hagibis is due to sweep through Tokyo this weekend, affecting the Pool C decider at International Stadium Yokohama on Saturday and also Scotland's pivotal group showdown against Japan 24 hours later.\n\nThe options available to World Rugby are to either cancel the all-Six Nations fixture or move it to Oita, where the quarter-finals are being staged.\n\nWith Hagibis due to have moved on by the end of the weekend, Scotland could see their clash with Japan delayed by 24 hours but played at the same venue.\n\nIf, as expected, the England game is cancelled or switched to Oita then it would be the first time a World Cup match has been affected in this way in nine instalments of the tournament and it would cause chaos for travelling fans.", "description": "F1 chiefs are monitoring the potential disruption that could be caused by the super typhoon, which is set to hit Suzuka by the weekend", "authors": ["Matt Maltby", "Image", "Action Images", "Nasa Earth Observatory Handout Epa-Efe Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20546841.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Japanese-Grand-Prix-2014.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
