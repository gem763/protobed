Warren has also caught Biden in recent national polls and surveys of New Hampshire and Nevada.\n\nThird quarter fundraising numbers also have set off alarms in Biden World after he placed fourth among White House hopefuls, bringing in just over $15 million, a $7 million decline from the second quarter.\n\nWarren and Sen.

They have to pick their spots,\u201d Finney said, adding that Biden's remarks at the gun forum struck the right tone. \u201cYou want to stay out of it to some degree, you want to let it unfold. You don't need to be a part of the story. Let them implode. Don't take the bait. Don't get in the way.\n\n\u201cThe challenge is to continue to be disciplined and sticking to your plan and rolling out your policy proposals,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile debate rages over the best course for Biden, Warren continues to climb, bolstered by small-dollar fundraising that Biden has been unable to match.\n\nThere is frustration in some quarters with Biden\u2019s finance team and a growing realization that he\u2019ll need to effectively double his quarterly hauls if he\u2019s going to build an organization to compete with Warren, Sanders and Buttigieg.\n\n\u201cIf they think they can get by with $15 million quarters, they\u2019re wrong,\u201d said the Democratic fundraiser. \u201cIt matters too much in building out a ground organization. You just can\u2019t get by with a little more than half of what your rivals are raising.\u201d\n\nStill, Biden\u2019s allies say they\u2019re confident he can regain footing in the race, noting that four months in a chaotic primary is a long time for Warren, or any other challenger, to sustain momentum.\n\nAnd they say they\u2019re only in this tough spot because Trump views Biden as the biggest threat to his reelection.\n\n\u201cThe reason we're in this situation in the first place is because he knows if we get through this primary his presidency is over,\u201d said the Biden ally.", "description": "Joe Biden is at a crossroads in his quest for the Democratic presidential nomination, as President Trump fights an impeachment inquiry by unloading on the former vice president and Sen.
