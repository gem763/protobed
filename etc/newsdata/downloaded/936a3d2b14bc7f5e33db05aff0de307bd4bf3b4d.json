The attackers have not been identified.\n\nMAN IN 'MAGA' HAT ASSAULTED IN CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT BATHROOM; SUSPECT ARRESTED, POLICE SAY\n\nTuran said in the lawsuit the three parties were \"directly responsible\" for \"gross negligence\" because alcohol was served at the event \"without an appropriate license.\" At least one of his attackers was under 21, Turan alleged.\n\nOne attacker knocked Turan's MAGA hat off his head before two other people smashed his \"head and face into the metal scaffolding,\" the lawsuit claimed.\n\nTuran suffered a fractured eye socket and sought damages for \"substantial injuries, pain, suffering and emotional distress.\"\n\nBloda told the Post she felt badly, \"but it's nothing to do with me.\"\n\n\u201cI\u2019m broke. I\u2019m an artist hardly surviving in New York,\u201d she told the newspaper. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened -- I don\u2019t know these people. They were a bunch of skater kids who had nothing to do with me, and they all refused to say who was responsible because they were loyal to each other.\"\n\nShe also said everybody who attended the event was at least 21.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cI respect everybody\u2019s political opinions and rights to believe what they want. It\u2019s a very bad thing that happened but it\u2019s got nothing to do with me,\" she added.\n\nNone of the parties being sued returned Fox News' requests for comment.
