We said at halftime we needed to try and come out and get an early goal and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done,\u201d Kane said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good result we hope to take into Tuesday.\u201d\n\nRelated Coverage Goals flowing for England as Kane and Sterling click\n\nBulgaria had never beaten England in 10 previous encounters, scoring only twice, and despite starting reasonably solidly and having the game\u2019s first chance through naturalised Brazilian Wanderson, they were the architects of their own downfall.\n\nThe expected home onslaught had failed to materialise in the opening quarter but England were gifted the lead.\n\nSouthgate would have been concerned by some slackness in his defence and Galin Ivanov wasted a great chance to head his side level when he was picked out by Ivelin Popov\u2019s cross.\n\nShortly after the break Wanderson was played in and his fierce effort from a tight angle was saved by Jordan Pickford.\n\nStung, England immediately counter-attacked and Marcus Rashford was sent clear and as he turned back inside in the area he was tripped by the sliding Nikolay Bodurov.\n\nKane dispatched the penalty with ease and six minutes later he teed up Sterling to score off his thigh from close range.\n\nWith the points in the bag England sent on Chelsea youngster Mason Mount for his debut while Jadon Sancho also got some game time as he replaced Sterling with 20 minutes left.\n\nKane was also given a breather but not before he had earned and converted his second penalty in the 73rd minute after being hacked down by Bulgaria substitute Kristian Dimitrov.\n\nSlideshow (15 Images)\n\nKosovo have emerged as the unlikely closest challengers to England in the group and will arrive at Wembley in good heart after goals from Vedat Muriqi and Mergim Vojvoda secured their victory over the Czechs in the day\u2019s other Group A game.\n\nPatrik Schick had put the Czechs ahead.", "description": "England's serene progress towards Euro 2020 continued as captain Harry Kane grabbed a hat-trick in a 4-0 demolition of Bulgaria in Group A at Wembley on Saturday.", "authors": ["Martyn Herman", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190907&t=2&i=1427337255&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF860VV", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
