They\u2019ve put their bodies on the line every weekend,\u201d said Japan coach Jamie Joseph, who has compared his players to Ferraris.\n\n\u201cBut tonight they went another level I felt. They gave everything they possibly could \u2014 everyone gave 150 percent and that\u2019s what it takes to win big Test matches.\u201d\n\nScotland needed to win while preventing Japan from securing a defensive bonus point \u2014 and they got off to a flying start.\n\nEarly pressure told as fly-half Finn Russell broke through to give them the lead after just seven minutes.\n\n\u2013 Fukuoka brilliance \u2013\n\nBut the Japanese hit back with Matsushima latching onto a superb, one-handed offload from Fukuoka to score his fifth try of the tournament.\n\nEven better was to come from the hosts with a dazzling move straight out of a basketball playbook, quick hands between Shota Horie and William Tupou releasing loosehead prop Keita Inagaki to crash over.\n\nOn the stroke of half-time, Fukuoka plucked a high-bouncing Timothy Lafaele grubber out of the air to leave Scotland with a mountain to climb.\n\nMan of the match Fukuoka then produced a moment of solo brilliance moments into the second half, stripping the ball from Chris Harris before accelerating clear.\n\nScotland, who had bounced back from a 27-3 drubbing by Ireland to smash Samoa 34-0 and Russia 61-0, looked out of it.\n\nWhen WP Nel and Zander Fagerson bulldozed over in the space of five minutes, suddenly the Japanese were creaking.\n\nBut they withstood a late barrage to avenge a 45-10 defeat by Scotland that cost them a place in the knockout stages of the 2015 World Cup.\n\n\u201cWe gave it a good crack in the second half but when you leak 28 points, you\u2019re always going to be chasing the game,\u201d said Scotland captain Greig Laidlaw.\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019ve got to give Japan credit. They\u2019ve really improved since four years ago.\u201d\n\nThat Japan team, led by Eddie Jones, won three pool matches, including a breathless 34-32 victory over South Africa in their opening game.\n\nJapan\u2019s current vintage thrashed Russia 30-10 and Samoa 38-19 either side of their massive win over Ireland, and Joseph will relish the chance to have another crack at the Springboks next weekend.", "description": "Yokohama (Japan) (AFP) \u2013 Japan\u2019s \u201cFerraris\u201d hit top gear Sunday as the hosts beat Scotland 28-21 in a barnstorming Rugby World Cup", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/13/e402f9_japan-won-all-pool-matches-history-makers-japan-stun-scots-reach-world-cup-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
