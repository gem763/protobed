This is our weekly newsletter on all things environmental, where we highlight trends and solutions that are moving us to a more sustainable world.

And of course, that number is much lower today. We emit about 42 gigatonnes of CO2 a year. At current emission levels, that remaining budget is gone within 8 1/2 years.\"\n\nThose words were delivered by youth climate activist Greta Thunberg to the French parliament on July 23, 2019 . She said she has not heard much on the subject of a \"carbon budget,\" either from politicians or the media. But what's left in our carbon budget is of utmost importance if we hope to limit global warming.\n\nSimply put, this budget refers to how much carbon \u2014 which includes CO2 and other greenhouse gases like methane \u2014 we can emit into the atmosphere before we pass the point of warming the Earth to 1.5 C or 2 C.\n\nThe carbon budget was discussed in the first of three special reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), released in October 2018. The final instalment, the Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC), will be discussed in Morocco this weekend, with a summary due to be released next Wednesday.\n\nThe Paris Agreement seeks to limit a global temperature rise to 2 C above pre-industrial levels this century (with a goal of keeping it to 1.5 C). The key to understanding the carbon budget is that even if countries keep in line with the Paris accord, if the budget is depleted by then, it won't matter. The damage will already be done. And it will be irreversible.\n\n\"If you think about annual emissions and reducing emissions without thinking about the carbon budget, you could really blow past the Paris Agreement,\" said Brenda Ekwurzel, director of climate science at the U.S.-based Union of Concerned Scientists . \"That's the trouble.\"\n\nAfter a few years of stable global CO2 emissions, they rose in 2018, and there are concerns they may rise again in 2019 .\n\nIf we don't pay attention to the carbon budget, it increases the chance of a host of global problems: the loss of coral reefs, no summer sea ice in the Arctic, more severe weather events and changes in crops that could lead to further food scarcity.\n\nIf it sounds dire, Ekwurzel said we have the power to change the trajectory.\n\n\"Whenever we've been faced with a problem before and really \u2026 lean into it, we make big changes,\" Ekwurzel said. \"And a lot of those changes we're calling for, we can do.\"\n\nShe said we need to look at deep de-carbonization of our energy supply, as well as doing \"nature-based enhancements,\" including the expansion and protection of carbon sinks such as forests, wetlands and mangroves, as well as seagrass. Ekwurzel stresses that economists say the transitions are economically feasible .\n\nLike Greta, Ekwurzel said it's time that everyone \u2014 governments, organizations, businesses, and yes, consumers \u2014 begin to pay more attention to that budget that is nipping at our heels. She insists that together, we can make a difference.\n\n\"Yeah,\" Ekwurzel said. \"We can do this.\"\n\n\u2014 Nicole Mortillaro\n\nReader feedback\n\nThe period between Sept. 20 and 27 is shaping up to be quite significant for climate action, with a major summit at the United Nations and major climate strikes planned for the next couple of Fridays. Will you be taking part in the strikes?

The crowdfunding campaign operated by the B.C. Parks Foundation, an independent charity that works with B.C. Parks, raised $3 million to buy the expanse of land in Princess Louisa Inlet from a private seller. The aim of this purchase? Preservation. Andrew Day, CEO of B.C. Parks Foundation, said the organization wants to save the land from logging and other development. Said Day, \"We'll do our best to make sure that that area stays protected forever.\"\n\n(Rafferty Baker/CBC)\n\nHot and bothered: Provocative ideas from around the web\n\nWhat you can do to save the birds\n\n(Jay McGowan/Macaulay Library at Cornell Lab of Ornithology)\n\nA new study, led by Ken Rosenberg at the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology, has found there are three billion fewer birds in North America than there were in 1970. The Canadian and U.S. researchers behind the study say that habitat loss is likely the main cause, and conservation can make a difference, as shown by the increased populations of waterfowl and birds of prey.\n\nBut besides lobbying the government and donating money to conservation groups, there are also individual actions people can take to help protect birds.\n\nHere are seven things the researchers, and the bird conservation and research groups that support them, suggest through their website 3billionbirds.org.\n\nReduce the chance that birds will hit windows. Use film, paint or string to break up reflections to prevent daytime collisions. And turn lights out at night.\n\nKeep cats indoors. Cats are the second-highest human-related cause of bird declines after habitat loss, the researchers say. Keep cats indoors, or in an enclosed \"catio\" or on a leash when outdoors.\n\nReplace your lawn with native plants. Native plants can provide shelter, nesting areas and food for birds \u2014 such as nectar, seeds and berries \u2014 that grass doesn't. You can find more info on \"greener\" lawn alternatives here .\n\nAvoid pesticides. Pesticides can harm seed-eating birds that accidentally eat treated seeds , as well as indirectly damage insect-eating birds by killing their food source.\n\nBuy shade-grown coffee. To grow coffee in the sun, farmers often clear forests that migratory birds need for food and shelter. Shade-grown coffee preserves that forest. The Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center has even created a certification for \"bird-friendly coffee\" that includes organic and fair trade standards.\n\nCut back on plastics. Studies show that at least 80 seabird species mistake plastic for food, the researchers say.\n\nWatch birds and help track them. Anyone can participate in citizen science projects like Project FeederWatch, the Christmas Bird Count or the Breeding Bird Survey, which was key to generating the data in the study. Apps like eBird can make it easy to submit your everyday sightings. You can learn more about nature apps here . We've also talked about their use in saving the bees in a previous issue.\n\n\u2014 Emily Chung\n\nStay in touch!\n\nAre there issues you'd like us to cover? Questions you want answered?
