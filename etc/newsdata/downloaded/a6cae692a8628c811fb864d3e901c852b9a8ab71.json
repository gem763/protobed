Forward momentum.\n\nIn practice, the helical engine would use a particle accelerator and ion particles, but the basic principal is the same.\n\nIn his study, published in in NASA Technical Reports Server , Burns explained: \u201cChemical, nuclear and electric propulsion systems produce thrust by accelerating and expelling propellants.\n\n\u201cDeep space travel is often a trade-off between thrust and large propellant storage tanks that eventually limit performance.\n\n\"The objective of this paper is to introduce and examine a unique engine that uses a closed-cycle propellant.\u201d\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nBurns\u2019 calculations predict that the helical engine could produce a forwards thrust up to 99% the speed of light without breaking Einstein\u2019s Theory of Relativity.\n\nHowever, as it stands, the engine would need to be 200 metres long and 12 metres wide to work, meaning it\u2019s not exactly practical for space travel.\n\nDespite this, he still believes that his research could one day lead to a viable engine.\n\nHe added: \u201cYou have to be prepared to be embarrassed. It is very difficult to invent something that is new under the sun and actually works.\"", "description": "David Burns, an engineer based at NASA\u2019s Marshall Space Flight Centre in Alabama, has unveiled what he calls a \u2018helical engine\u2019", "authors": ["Shivali Best", "Image", "Getty", "Getty Images Istockphoto"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20578346.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/3_nasa-news-space-helical-particle-accelerator-spacecraft-light-speed-2108417.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
