Although the Brave Blossoms failed to qualify from the pool stages following a loss to Scotland, a flame was ignited four years out from hosting the tournament themselves.\n\nThe result enabled the Japanese players to believe they could take on anyone. Many players believe their current success stems from the confidence gained in 2015, including flying winger Kenki Fukuoka who played then and who in this tournament scored two tries in a man-of-the-match performance against Scotland.\n\n\u201cThe acknowledgement of our ability to play on the world stage was established four years ago, which led to our confident performance this time,\u201d Fukuoka said.\n\nCentre Ryoto Nakamura said there would have been no Japanese victory over Ireland this time had it not been for 2015.\n\nThe players routinely point to two major factors for their success - preparation and the influence of head coach Jamie Joseph who played for Japan in the 1999 World Cup.\n\nJoseph has had the luxury of nine months with his players, having run a training camp since January after Japan\u2019s Top League sides shortened their domestic season.\n\n\u201cIt was very clear our players just weren\u2019t ready to play test match rugby against tier-one teams,\u201d Joseph said in the build-up to the World Cup when reflecting on his time in charge.\n\n\u201cIn terms of our fitness and our ability to play at that level of rugby week in and week out, we just weren\u2019t fit or strong enough.\u201d\n\nThat has certainly changed and captain Michael Leitch has also spoken about the impact of the players\u2019 exposure to the world\u2019s elite, both at international level and for the Sunwolves in Super Rugby.\n\n\u201cThe biggest reason is belief, that is the trigger,\u201d said Leitch after the win over Scotland.\n\n\u201cSince 2011, the opponents we have played have been stronger and stronger. We have played more tier-one nations and played in Super Rugby.\u201d\n\nFor Leitch and many others, this tournament is just the start.\n\n\u201cLooking back, even since 2011, this team has grown so much and it is scary to think about how far this team could actually grow,\u201d said Leitch earlier this week.\n\n\u201cThe last four games, we are getting better each time, and the confidence is growing.\u201d", "description": "That Japan are preparing for the biggest match in their history, a Rugby World Cup quarter-final showdown against South Africa in Tokyo on Sunday, is a testament to the rapid improvement the Brave Blossoms have made over the past five years.", "authors": ["Jack Tarrant", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442297067&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H1B5-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
