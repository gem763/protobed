REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File Photo\n\nZURICH (Reuters) - Novartis (NOVN.S) sales data on Tuesday suggested the Swiss drugmaker is reaping less than the $2.1 million U.S. list price for its gene therapy Zolgensma, as insurers may be getting breaks on the world\u2019s most-expensive one-time treatment.\n\nThe spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) treatment, approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in May, has reaped $175 million in revenue this year, including $160 million in the third quarter.\n\nOn a call following third-quarter results, Chief Executive Vas Narasimhan said roughly 100 patients have been treated under the paid programme.\n\nThe figures would suggest it is receiving around $1.75 million per patient on average, a 17% discount to the U.S. list price. Novartis has said previously it was offering discounts to U.S. insurers on the condition they add Zolgensma to their policies to ensure quick authorisation.\n\n\u201cWith respect to Zolgensma, you have to divide the total sales by the net pricing that we\u2019ve achieved and also look at our U.S.-EU mix,\u201d Narasimhan told analysts on the call. \u201cWe\u2019re in the range of 100 patients treated currently under the paid programme.\u201d\n\nNarasimhan also told reporters on Tuesday that insurers are seeking to tie payments to Zolgensma\u2019s long-term efficacy, but said he has seen no \u201cmaterial uptake\u201d of five-year instalment plans that Novartis has suggested to help soften the financial burden.\n\nNovartis declined to confirm the average per-patient cost figure based on revenue and patients treated.", "description": "Novartis sales data on Tuesday suggested the Swiss drugmaker is reaping less than the $2.1 million U.S. list price for its gene therapy Zolgensma, as insurers may be getting breaks on the world's most-expensive one-time treatment.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191022&t=2&i=1443772976&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9L1BS", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
