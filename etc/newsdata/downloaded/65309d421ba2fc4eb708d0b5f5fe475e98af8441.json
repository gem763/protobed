An exaggeration, of course \u2013 but only just. Doris Lessing\u2019s 1962 novel is eminently quotable:\n\n\u201cFor with my intuition I knew that this man was repeating a pattern over and over again: courting a woman with his intelligence and sympathy, claiming her emotionally; then, when she began to claim in return, running away. And the better a woman was, the sooner he would begin to run.\u201d \u201cThe real revolution is women against men.\u201d \u201cIf we lead what is known as free lives, that is, lives like men, why shouldn\u2019t we use the same language.\u201d \u201cOne had to be much older than I was then to understand George\u2019s relationship with his wife. He had a fierce loyal compassion for her, the compassion of one victim for another.\u201d\n\nIn addition to all the aphorisms, there\u2019s also some scorching dialogue \u2013 such as this conversation between two female friends about a married but impotent would-be-lover:\n\nAnd so this man spent a second night with Julia. With no better results. \u201cNaturally he left at four, so that the little woman could believe he had been working late. Just as he left he turned on me and said: \u2018You\u2019re a castrating woman, I thought you were from the moment I saw you.\u2019\u201d \u201cJesus,\u201d said Ella. \u201cYes,\u201d said Julia fiercely. \u201cAnd the funny thing is, he\u2019s a nice man. I mean, I would never have expected that sort of remark from him.\u201d\n\nThere are also wonderfully revealing moments:\n\nHe sauced her with his eye; sitting up broad, solid, pink-cheeked; very sure of himself and his world in this house. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you put on the dress you said you were going to wear?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve decided to wear this instead.\u201d \u201cWomen,\u201d said the nine-year-old, in a lordly way. \u201cWomen and their dresses.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t just select these extracts because they are delicious. They provide a neat demonstration of why the Oxford Companion to English Literature describes The Golden Notebook as a landmark of the women\u2019s movement in the 1960s, an achievement Lessing disliked, denying that the novel was a \u201ctrumpet for women\u2019s liberation\u201d or an account of \u201cthe sex war\u201d.\n\nIt would be reductive to describe all of Lessing\u2019s female characters as victims. Most of them are too smart, determined and independent-minded to allow themselves to be beaten down entirely. But the odds are stacked against them, especially in their relationships with men.\n\nTime and again, the men get to do and say dreadful things, then trot off unscathed to their next victims. (Give or take a bit of wounded pride about their inability to \u201cget a hard on\u201d.) The women are left holding the baby, literally and metaphorically, as the consequences of relationship problems fall harder on them. Meanwhile, the men unfailingly abuse their power. They present a physical threat, they have more money, and conventional society tends to take their side, no matter how awful their behaviour.\n\nWhen one useless, stupid, drunken husband publicly labels his wife as an \u201cugly whore\u201d and \u201cbarren bitch\u201d because she has had an affair, she just has to suck it up. \u201cShe lifted her ruin of a face to us,\u201d the narrator says, \u201cpulling at her lovely red hair with both hands, the tears dropping off her chin.\u201d Nobody does anything. The husband continues with the insults.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to read The Golden Notebook without thinking that there\u2019s something very wrong in the gender relations it describes and in the world at large. It\u2019s easy to see why readers might have taken it as a call to arms and feminist inspiration. But even so, it\u2019s just as easy to see why Lessing was annoyed that people might describe the novel in exclusively feminist terms. It\u2019s too complicated and ambiguous to fit any political programme. It isn\u2019t didactic. It doesn\u2019t have a straightforward thesis. Plenty of male characters also fall victim to social inequalities and moralistic absurdities. Many of the female characters are just as problematic as the men. Meanwhile, the most straightforwardly likable character is a man called Cy Maitland, an American brain surgeon who is always \u201cfresh and vital\u201d, enthusiastic and as happy as a labrador jumping into a lake. Lessing doesn\u2019t necessarily take sides \u2013 or even suggest that there are any.\n\nThe Golden Notebook has as much to say about socialism, racism and literary culture as it does about feminism. It\u2019s also, as Lessing pointed out in her preface, an intimate, claustrophobic and necessarily disturbing portrait of people who are \u201ccracking up\u201d. There\u2019s a lot going on, in other words \u2013 but it is a big book, after all.", "description": "For all the suffering its women endure at the hands of men, it\u2019s not hard to see why Doris Lessing disliked her book\u2019s polemical reputation", "authors": ["Sam Jordison"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a437a9bdfc5438f0008d6b930e454331bf21c00/0_193_1125_675/master/1125.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ecc958a3531cce18967297dea6d59e2b", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
