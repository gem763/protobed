But first, there were rules. The girls sat on the floor and waited for the coach to speak. \u201cShe said \u2026 we were supposed to represent the school, have respect for people, for each other, and for everybody else. We had to be nice, you know, watch our mouths, no chewing gum during practice because you\u2019d get demerits for that.\u201d Brown says the coach explained that the team also had an \u201chonest system,\u201d requiring the cheerleaders to be honest with one another.\n\nAt Ashwaubenon High, there was both a dance team and a cheer squad, and they were fierce rivals. The dance team required gymnastic maneuvers and strict dance training. Though both teams waved pom poms, the cheer squad was much less challenging. The established cheerleaders taught the new girls the official cheer of the Jaguars. The routines at try-outs were simple, which was a relief to Brown. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do cartwheels,\u201d she says, \u201cI couldn\u2019t do flips. I couldn\u2019t do any of that.\u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t matter. There were no football players, and the bleachers were empty, but their chants filled the stadium. Brown fell into the hypnotic routine, with the handclaps and chanting. There was just one nagging feeling. Unlike the other girls, afterwards she would return home to her miserable apartment. \u201cI was living two different lives,\u201d she says, \u201ctwo different people.\u201d But for now, she had a new, intoxicating mantra: \u201cGo! Go! Go! Fight! Fight! Fight! Win! Win! Win! Go! Fight! Win!\u201d\n\n* * *\n\nOn August 8, 2008, Johnson invited the cheerleaders to a pool party at her home. Brown was a ball of nerves. It had been 19 years since she was first a sophomore. Katy Perry now dominated the Hot 100. When she arrived, the cheerleaders were catching rays in tiny two-piece suits, enjoying the fading Wisconsin summer. Brown, anxious about the stretch marks from her pregnancies, wore a one-piece underneath a t-shirt, an outfit that she says puzzled the other girls.\n\n\u201cI told [them] the reason I had the T-shirt on, you know, was that I used to be really fat. I lost all the weight,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s just shy, leave her alone,\u201d Brown recalls a cheerleader saying.\n\nThen she jumped in the pool. Brown tried her best to fit in, playing volleyball, and copying how the other girls nibbled at the cheese, pepperoni, and sausage pizzas.\n\n\u201cI just remember eating it how my daughter would eat it,\u201d Brown says, \u201clittle bites.\u201d Music thumped from a stereo. The games segued into cheer routines, and Brown began to enjoy herself. \u201cWe had the first home game to practice for,\u201d says Brown, still hoping to be chosen for the squad. From the stereo the sound of fiddling violins soared across the backyard. The girls lined up and waited for the song to kick in:\n\nIf it hadn't been for Cotton-Eye Joe, I'd been married a long time ago. Where did you come from, where did you go? Where did you come from, Cotton-Eye Joe?\n\nBrown danced to \u201cCotton-Eye Joe\u201d\u2014the 1995 record by the novelty country band Rednex\u2014more times than any 33-year-old woman should ever have to. The routine was a series of hops and twirls. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t rocket science,\u201d Brown says. But spinning around in circles for an hour made the girls dizzy. They collapsed with laughter. The way she tells it, Brown hadn\u2019t been that happy in years.", "description": "At 33, Wendy Brown stole her daughter\u2019s name, grabbed a pair of pom-poms, lived a teenage dream\u2014then she went to jail for it.", "authors": ["Jeff Maysh"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2016/06/unspecified_1/facebook.jpg?1522792819", "published_at": "2016-07-06"}
