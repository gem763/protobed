The black market value, impact to consumers and banks, and liability associated with different types of card fraud\n\nThe Robin Hood hack was first reported on by Brian Krebs, creator of Krebs on Security, who received an anonymous tip that BriansClub had been drained of its 26 million stolen credit cards.\n\nThe tip included a file that matched redacted versions on sale at BrainsClub, confirming that the claim was indeed true.\n\n'All of the card data stolen from BriansClub,' writes Krebs, 'was shared with multiple sources who work closely with financial institutions to identify and monitor or reissue cards that show up for sale in the cybercrime underground.'\n\nAndrei Barysevich, co-founder and CEO at Gemini, said the breach at BriansClub is certainly significant, given that Gemini currently tracks a total of 87 million credit and debit card records for sale across the cybercrime underground.\n\nThe underground site has collected these cards over the past four years and 'dumps' the owner's country, state, city, zip information and CVV2 cards for crooks to purchase Many of the cards for sale on BriansClub are not visible to all customers. Those who wish to see the 'best' cards in the shop need to maintain certain minimum balances\n\nHOW TO MINIMIZE IMPACT OF A CREDIT CARD HACK According to the researchers, there's no 'magic bullet' against these types of attacks. Instead, customers should take steps to minimize the impacts of such an attack in case they become a target. Dr Martin Emms, of Newcastle University, recommends using just one card for online payments, and keeping the spending limit as low as possible. For a bank card, the expert says you should keep the available funds at a minimum, and transfer money over when necessary. On top of this, the researcher says card holders should be 'vigilant' with their statements and balance to look out for any unusual activity.\n\n'With over 78% of the illicit trade of stolen cards attributed to only a dozen of dark web markets, a breach of this magnitude will undoubtedly disturb the underground trade in the short term,' Barysevich said.\n\n'However, since the demand for stolen credit cards is on the rise, other vendors will undoubtedly attempt to capitalize on the disappearance of the top player.'\n\nBriansClub seems to have been operating and steal for years.\n\nThe data hack shows that the site gathered 1.7 million cards in 2015, 2.9 million in 2016, 4.9 million in 2017, 9.2 million in 2018, and 7.6 million in the first eight months of this year.\n\nMost of the data was composed of 'dumps', which is transferred to new cards that criminals use to whatever their hearts desire from big-box stores.\n\nHowever, an analysis into cards expiring in the future suggests that more than 14 million are still valid.\n\nFlashpoint, a security intelligence firm, took a deeper look into the database and found that it holds approximately $414 million worth of stolen credit cards for sale.\n\nAllison Nixon, the company's director of security research, said the data shows that between 2015 and August 2019, BriansClub earned about $126 million between 2015 and August 2019 from the sale of some 9.1 million stolen cards.\n\nKrebs explained 'If we take just the 9.1 million cards that were confirmed sold through BriansClub, we're talking about more than $4 billion in likely losses at the $500 average loss per card figure from the Justice Department.'", "description": "'BriansClub' has been infiltrated by attackers who turned over 26 million cards to the banking industry so the cards could be cancelled.
