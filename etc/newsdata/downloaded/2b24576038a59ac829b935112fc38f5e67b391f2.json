Beijing\u2019s repression of Hong Kong continues. Last week, China reached a preliminary trade deal with the U.S. \u2014 arguably the most important economic news in weeks. And the NBA finds itself embroiled in controversy over allegedly kowtowing to Chinese repression. And yet the hosts of the debate said nothing and asked nothing about the issue.\n\nChina was mentioned \u2014 briefly \u2014 by a few candidates.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) brought up China in attacking former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s record on trade. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg claimed (incorrectly) that \u201cIn a place like china, the people of Hong Kong rise up for democracy and don\u2019t get a peep of support from the president.\u201d (President Donald Trump told the United Nations last month: \u201cThe world fully expects that the Chinese government will honor its binding treaty, made with the British and registered with the United Nations, in which China commits to protect Hong Kong\u2019s freedom, legal system, and democratic ways of life.\u201d)\n\nSen. Amy Kloubuchar claimed that Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the Iran deal gave power to China and Russia (though his supporters would say the opposite, since China and Russia back Iran). Former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-TX) claimed Trump offered China favorable trade terms in exchange for looking into Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings in the country while his father was in office.\n\nBut from the moderators: zero.\n\nCNN seems to be ignoring news about the China trade deal. Last week, it all but ignored the news, declining to provide pool coverage of President Trump\u2019s news conference with the Chinese vice premier from the Oval Office.\n\nThe moderators mentioned the scandal involving Hunter Biden, but only in context of Ukraine \u2014 not China.\n\nJoel B.
