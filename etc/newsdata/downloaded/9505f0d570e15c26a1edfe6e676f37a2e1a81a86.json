It\u2019s just not grounded in reality. But a very large percentage of voters \u2014 25 percent by some measurements \u2014 think this fantasy is real and that AOC could pull it off. This is sad and dangerous. I shudder when I think of how this stunning ignorance would play out in a war or peace situation for this country.\n\nIgnorance is not bliss. It\u2019s super-dangerous, and we would do well to try to educate our people in some basics of real life \u2014 such as that terrorists with nuclear weapons are really, really dangerous and that playing trade war chicken with a country as big and powerful as China is dangerous, too. But let\u2019s go on to other, more current situations \u2026 and happier ones at that.\n\nJust by the way, speaking of ignorance, a few years ago I was walking through Reagan airport in D.C. and saw an attractive middle-aged woman with short hair. She was dragging a good-sized suitcase all by herself. No greeters. No security. No skycaps. It was Mrs. Warren. We talked for a few minutes about mutual friends at Harvard Law School, and then I let her go. Was she an idiot to be solo with luggage at Reagan or was it the last word in modesty? I\u2019m still not sure, but I admired her for it.", "description": "", "authors": ["Ben Stein", "Spectator.Org Ignorance-Is-Not-Bliss-Our-Dumbing-Down-In-Time-For-Aoc"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
