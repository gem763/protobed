washing machine.\n\nShe rushed me away and called the wildlife guy who turned up in all his protective gear.\n\nI was going in with my bare hands, I was never scared.\n\nI grew up in the Australian Outback and I loved going out after school to hunt deadly snakes \u2013 I\u2019d bring them home and keep them as pets.\n\nUnfortunately for my mother, on one occasion a few snakes and scorpions got out and went for a jolly around our house.\n\nBy the time I was 10 I had three King Brown snakes (they have the largest recorded venom output of any snake) who lived in an enclosure in my bedroom.\n\nI was always bringing home small injured animals, nursing them back to health then releasing them.\n\nThat was my childhood \u2013 adventure was always a large part of my life.\n\nOnce I was old enough to leave home I was in the army for a while, before I was hired by a cattle station to do part-time work.\n\nThey had a problem \u2013 crocodiles were eating their cattle.\n\nThey wanted someone to catch and move the crocs away from their livestock, so I offered.\n\nI had trained as a helicopter pilot too, which helped.\n\nWhen it\u2019s sprawling landscape I can fly low in the helicopter to round up the cows.\n\nI move the cattle, then go hunting for the croc culprits.\n\nThe aim was to move them somewhere where they wouldn\u2019t eat cows!\n\nSimple.\n\nI remember the look on the station manager\u2019s face when I showed him the 16ft (4.8m) croc I\u2019d caught.\n\nThat\u2019s where all his precious cows had ended up.\n\nIn his belly.\n\nNorthern Australia isn\u2019t widely documented, so I started sharing little videos of crocodiles on YouTube.\n\nMy friend filmed me catching one that was over 181/2ft long (5.6m) and it went viral.\n\nAll of a sudden we were signing a deal with a TV company to make a series.\n\nThere are a few methods for catching and moving the crocodiles.\n\nSometimes me and my team go in at night and use a \u2018pronged spear\u2019 to get them in the water.\n\nIt\u2019s called a harpoon, but I prefer a nice name for it.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t hurt them because their hide is so thick, it just locks in under the skin so we can pull them in, from the back, of course \u2013 we don\u2019t need to be pulling snapping jaws towards us.\n\nThen I jump on its back, grab it by the jowls, hold its head up and pull it on land.\n\nWe tape up their snouts and put a hood on them, so the sensory organs in their heads are covered \u2013 it calms them down.\n\nThen once they chill out we put them in the back of the truck and move them.\n\nThat\u2019s for the smaller crocs \u2013 you don\u2019t want to be doing that with any over 15ft (4.5m).\n\nI\u2019ve tried the spear with bigger ones, but sometimes they thrash around so much they\u2019ve ripped the side of the boat open with their tails.\n\nFor them we use large water traps and entice them with food.\n\nSometimes I even get in the water with them and grab them.\n\nFrom behind.\n\nIt usually works, unless you slip and they use their tail to smash you into the side of the bank.\n\nThat hurts.\n\nSince the show started we\u2019ve been criticised for the way we handle the crocs, with people saying it\u2019s cruel.\n\nBut I just say, \u2018OK, I\u2019ll leave the crocodile here so then he gets shot.\u2019\n\nThat\u2019s the reality.\n\nI move it and save it, or I leave it there to die.\n\nThere are always arguments on how to protect the environment, but my preference is always to let the crocodile live.\n\nAnimals need to be in a safe place, so they can live in their natural environment without being killed.\n\nThere\u2019s always a balance.\n\nA downside to this is the odd injury.\n\nI\u2019m constantly needing stitches.\n\nI broke my ankle last year when a huge croc swung his tail and took me out.\n\nIt was the loudest crack and so painful.\n\nNot to mention my hands are always torn up from dragging them around.\n\nThe biggest croc I\u2019ve ever seen was from the helicopter.\n\nI was chasing cows back to their enclosure and I spotted a 12-13ft (3.9m) croc.\n\nAs I got closer I noticed the whole side of the creek next to it moving.\n\nIt was the biggest thing I\u2019ve ever seen in my life.\n\nI\u2019d say just over 20ft (6m).\n\nI\u2019ve never seen it since.\n\nPeople do get eaten by sharks and crocodiles, but it\u2019s one or two a year.\n\nYou just have to have your wits about you.\n\nOnce I spotted a huge croc in a small lake by a camp site \u2013 monster crocs love the smaller lakes, as it makes them feel cosy.\n\nThe campers told us they\u2019d been swimming in there \u2013 they were lucky!\n\nHe was a thumper of an animal and very old.\n\nI believe he\u2019d lived there for years and never been spotted, as he hadn\u2019t caused any trouble.\n\nI called the ranger and expressed concern that if we moved him from his home, he may die.\n\nHe agreed and we didn\u2019t move him.\n\nInstead we fenced off the lake with a large sign saying, \u2018No swimming, a massive crocodile lives here!\u2019.\n\nIt\u2019s better to let the oldest ones live their lives where they\u2019re happy.\n\nCrocodiles are the most predictable things.\n\nThey\u2019re intelligent, but just motivated by food.\n\nThey want to eat everything, but if you\u2019re too big, they swim away.\n\nThe big ones own the joint, though, they\u2019ll have you if you get close.\n\nOr your pets.\n\nI found a dog collar by a lake once.\n\nIt was bubbling with 300-400 crocs and I was trying to distribute them evenly around the area.\n\nI called the number on the collar and the owner said he\u2019d let his dog off the lead to cool down in the lake and he never came back.\n\nWe all know what happened there.\n\nI live and breathe crocs!\n\nI have a load of rescues as pets.\n\nWe have Jilly, who we found up a mountain of all places, she\u2019s only 8ft (2.5m) and friendly.\n\nWillow is 14ft (4.2m), and was meant to be released, but the ethical team took too long to assess him, so it was too late \u2013 he\u2019s way too used to humans.\n\nThen I have five large males \u2013 one\u2019s called Bone Cruncher, as half his bottom jaw is missing, then there\u2019s Sweet Thing, a little female.\n\nThey all have names and answer to them.\n\nThey\u2019re easy to care for.\n\nJust keep them warm and feed them.\n\nWe have a lodge with plenty of land, so they have a huge enclosure and lots of water.\n\nI feed them pig legs, chicken, mince\u2026\n\nAnd yes they chase me round the yard sometimes for it, and go mad when they see me coming.\n\nI also have seven snakes at home and two dogs.\n\nThere\u2019s a croc who isn\u2019t one of mine who crawls up from the creek at the end of our lodge and one dog runs up and chases it.\n\nI\u2019m desperately training her to stop that.\n\nShe\u2019ll get chomped if she\u2019s not careful.\n\nNow we have a six-week-old baby, my wife\u2019s not as happy with snakes in the house.\n\nPurely because on occasions I forget to close the enclosure\u2026 I\u2019m working on it.\n\nWhen he was a week old, I took my son to see the crocs.\n\nI hope he\u2019s the next wrangler, but if he wants to be a builder, dancer, it\u2019s all cool with me.\n\nMy dream is to go to Alaska and see the whales, and I\u2019d love to help move rhinos out of areas where they\u2019re at risk from poachers.\n\nI\u2019ve never eaten crocodile meat and wouldn\u2019t: I don\u2019t eat them, they don\u2019t eat me.\n\nSo what do you do if you\u2019re in a croc-infested area?\n\nWhatever you do, don\u2019t get close to them.\n\nLeave that to me.\n\n- Series four of Monster Croc Wrangler starts on Tuesday, 8pm, on Nat Geo WILD", "description": "Professional crocodile
