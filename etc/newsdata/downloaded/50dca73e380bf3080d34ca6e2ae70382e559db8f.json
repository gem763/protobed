Sounds safe, right?\n\nFacebook announced on Thursday it is rolling out its newest service across the US, a platform for dating. What could go wrong? A lot, it turns out.\n\nThe new service, Facebook Dating, can be accessed in the Facebook app but requires users to create a separate dating-specific profile. It then links users with potential matches based on location, indicated preferences, events attended, groups, and other factors. Facebook Dating will integrate with Instagram and offer a feature called Secret Crush, which allows users to compile a list of friends they have an interest in, to be matched with if the crush lists them as well.\n\nFacebook's dating app is finally making privacy invasion sexy Read more\n\nFacebook has touted new privacy and security features within the dating service, including the ability for users to share plans and location with select friends when going on a date and allowing users to hide dating profiles from friends of friends to avoid disclosing sensitive information like sexual orientation.\n\nHowever, many are skeptical a company mired by numerous privacy scandals should be entrusted with helping users with the private journey of finding love.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re trying to avoid dating services that have red flags, you can\u2019t really find one that has more red flags than Facebook,\u201d Jason Kelley, a digital strategist at online privacy nonprofit the Electronic Frontier Foundation said. \u201cThey have a terrible track record of keeping user data safe.\u201d\n\nSocial media giant entering the dating world brings up \u2018red flags\u2019\n\nIf Facebook can\u2019t be trusted with your phone number, can it be trusted with safeguarding the name of your secret crush? Experts say no.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Facebook launched its new service, Facebook Dating, on Thursday. Photograph: Associated Press\n\nThe announcement of Facebook Dating comes days after the company admitted to exposing more than 419m user IDs and phone numbers online, a glitch in June 2018 made private posts of 14 million users public, and another breach in September 2018 compromised the data of 50 million users. In a separate scandal it was revealed in 2018 the company improperly harvested the data of millions of users through a partnership with campaign firm Cambridge Analytica.\n\nFacebook\u2019s phone number breach underlies a concerning inability to determine whether privacy concerns have been effectively resolved, Kelley said. The numbers exposed were amassed using a tool Facebook disabled in April 2018 after the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal.\n\n\u201cFacebook says the dating service is secure, but how do we know it won\u2019t realize a few years from now it was not as protected as it thought?\u201d Kelley said. \u201cIt gives us pause when things they have changed years ago are still being shown to cause problems in terms of data privacy.\u201d\n\nConcerns of using dating data for advertising\n\nPrivacy advocates are concerned about Facebook entering the dating space and gleaning more information about users, given their history of using personal data to target users with advertising about everything from mental health services to depressed people to baby products for pregnant people.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Privacy advocates are concerned about Facebook\u2019s dating service. Photograph: Associated Press\n\nThe company may be able to build more sophisticated ad profiles based on what kinds of people users like, whom they match with, and even how dates go, Kelley said.\n\nFacebook says users\u2019 dating profiles will be separate from their Facebook activity and not used for ad targeting. But Facebook\u2019s track record casts doubt on such promises, said Mark Weinstein, a privacy advocate and founder of social network MeWe.\n\n\u201cAfter so many years of countless privacy infractions, apologies, fines and pledges to do better, does anyone really believe a promise Facebook makes in regard to data privacy?\u201d he said. \u201cFacebook will use Facebook Dating as a new portal into users\u2019 lives; collecting, targeting, and selling dating history, romantic preferences, emotions, sexual interests, fetishes, everything.\u201d\n\nMillions more opened up to online scams\n\nFacebook is entering the online dating space at a time when the internet is more rife with fraud than ever. In 2018, more than 21,000 romance scams were reported to the FTC, up from 8,500 in 2015. People targeted by these scams reported a median loss of $2,600 or a collective loss of $143m in 2018. With an estimated 221 million US users, Facebook could potentially be exposing millions to fraud.\n\n\u201cIf a service exists, people are going to find a way to use it for some kind of scam,\u201d Kelley said. \u201cIt would be unsurprising, given how much data is available on users, it would be used for scams.\u201d\n\nThe social media giant is already taking measures to prevent fraud, making users unable to send links, photos, or payments within Facebook Messages to prevent scams.\n\nBut with the number of privacy, security and scam concerns, privacy advocates say users are likely better off meeting potential love interests on other apps \u2013 or IRL.\n\n\u201cYou would have to be pretty desperate with all of its history of privacy scandals to give Facebook any more insight into your life than you already have,\u201d Kelley said.", "description": "The company has touted its new privacy and security features but critics are skeptical given Facebook\u2019s track record on user data", "authors": ["Kari Paul"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a973f800a3681a2e82a494d30fa847ee77a1e7c8/0_301_4743_2846/master/4743.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c710b699c9bc1db8ee93e384a809e34b", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
