(Shannon Stapleton/Reuters)\n\nHanna Trudo of The Daily Beast reports that Elizabeth Warren \u201chas been in contact with Andrew Gillum in recent months, according to multiple sources familiar, who said the talks resemble the kind of courtship that happens when a leading presidential candidate is exploring potential VP contenders.\u201d\n\nBut the article also quotes a pretty adamant denial from an unnamed Warren campaign official said, \u201cthat is baseless and not at all true.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGillum would be something of a surprising choice. In case you\u2019ve forgotten, he is the former mayor of Tallahassee who ran for governor in 2018 and narrowly lost to Ron DeSantis. He had $3 million left in his campaign account when the race ended, prompting mega-donor John Morgan to threaten to sue Gillum if he ever ran for office again. You could say that he has experience with law enforcement, in the sense that the Federal Bureau of Investigation is looking into his time as mayor, and the state Commission on Ethics is investigating claims he accepted illegal gifts from lobbyists. At the end of May, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida in Tallahassee issued subpoenas demanding \u201cdocuments, electronically stored information, or objects\u201d dating back to January 2015 about Gillum, his 2018 gubernatorial campaign and his political committee, Forward Florida.\n\nThere\u2019s no word on whether the famously Native American Warren is offended by Gillum doing the Florida State Seminole \u201ctomahawk chop.\u201d Perhaps she\u2019s only 1/1024 offended.", "description": "Officials in the Warren campaign deny reports saying there has been communication between the two.", "authors": ["Jim Geraghty", "Victor Davis Hanson", "John Mccormack", "A.
