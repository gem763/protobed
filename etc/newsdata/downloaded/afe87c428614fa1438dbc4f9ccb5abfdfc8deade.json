and it costs less than \u00a31 per bottle.\n\nHeather Caminiti makes a cleaning solution of vinegar, lemon and essential oils and packs them into bottles to be used in client's homes.\n\nHer cleaning formula is even able to remove limescale, grease and bring shine back to dull surfaces.\n\nHeather, from Illinois, is a mother-of-three and owns her own cleaning company Caminiti Cleaning LLC.\n\nBefore she got into the cleaning business, she used all-natural cleaning products for her own home believing chemicals in other brands were toxic and unsafe for her dogs and children.\n\nShe now makes her own cleaning concoction consisting of just three ingredients - but says it does the job even better than store brands.\n\n(Image: Jam Press)\n\n(Image: Jam Press)\n\nHeather posted before and after pictures of her cleaning transformations on the Cleaning Tips & TricksFacebook page, receiving dozens of comments from mums alike praising her.\n\nShe said: \"My company tries to remain as natural and chemical free as possible.\n\n\"Our main products include vinegar, water and Thieves essential oil.\n\n\"Chemicals tend to be toxic, and we feel as if natural products are better for the environment, safer for children, pets, and plants.\n\n(Image: Jam Press)\n\n\"The natural blends we use tend to clean better, smell better, and are overall more pleasant and preferred by our clientele.\n\n\"Products that include chemicals can ruin certain types of furniture and surfaces.\n\n\u201cOur blend of natural products can be used on all furniture and surfaces while cleaning and disinfecting without all of the harmful ingredients most store bought products include so multiple cleaning supplies targeted to certain types of surfaces are unnecessary.\u201d\n\n(Image: Jam Press)\n\n(Image: Jam Press)\n\nHeather said she had spent hundreds of dollars over the years on expensive cleaning products but was unsatisfied with the final result.\n\nShe decided to start up her cleaning company in 2009, with the aim to stay as natural and toxic-free as possible.\n\nHeather loves using her own special cleaning formula, claiming it is a better disinfectant than store brands and leaves no surface streaks or pungent fumes.\n\n(Image: Jam Press)\n\nThe mum said: \"When originating my company, I knew I wanted to be as natural and toxic free as possible.\n\n\"In an age where we are all environmentally conscious, I knew that not only would my company stand out from other cleaning companies using all products including chemicals, I wanted to offer my clientele a safer and more pleasant option.\n\n\"There were many years that I cleaned my own home with store bought products that included a large amount of money spent on different chemicals meant for only specific surfaces, the fumes of these products, the toxicity of these chemicals and them being harmful to my family, pets, and plants, the risk of ruining the finish on certain surfaces.\n\n(Image: Jam Press)\n\n(Image: Jam Press)\n\n\"I knew there had to be a cheaper and more family friendly option so I did months and months of research and trial and error on my own home before I perfected my special blend.\n\n\"When using this, I've found that there are no fumes, the scent is pleasant.\n\n\u201cI can use one product on several surfaces rather than multiple different bottles and it cleans and disinfects even better than anything I've used before.\u201d\n\nHeather recommends families try going all-natural with cleaning products, saying they can simply open their kitchen cupboard and make their own formulas right in their home.\n\nShe added: \"Not only can you most likely find natural products appropriate to use already in your home, the ingredients are also pretty cheap and you can use the mixtures on all furniture and surfaces rather than one specific product for different areas of your house.\n\n\u201cNatural products are just as antibacterial and cleansing as store brought products without the toxic and negative odour, fumes, and ingredients bad for the environment and for your family.\u201d", "description": "Heather Caminiti owns her own cleaning company and makes her own concoction consisting of just three ingredients", "authors": ["Latifa Yedroudj", "Image", "Jam Press"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20759073.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-A-mum-reveals-her-secret-all-natural-cleaning-hack-that-leaves-kitchens-ovens-and-bathtubs-spotless.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
