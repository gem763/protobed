And they are worth grouping together for a good reason. I\u2019ve noticed a distressing trend with NetherRealm\u2019s output since the generation began, for the Lord Ed Boon giveth and he also taketh away. Or rather, he gives us far too much of what we don\u2019t want: grind.\n\nGrinding has been kind of the theme for all single-player efforts of this generation. All of them are guilty of it to some degree or another. But NetherRealm is the guiltiest of them all. It started in Mortal Kombat X with the Living Towers. Here there would be challenges that refreshed every hour, day and week. There would be modifiers to the matches \u2013 some good like tilting stages, faster battles or losing your limbs (I know that sounds bad, but it\u2019s really funny) to the awful: random hazards or character assists like meteors or lightning bolts that just serve to disrupt the rhythm of the match and get on your nerves. In Injustice 2 and Mortal Kombat 11 the irritations would outnumber the fun stuff.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSingle-player\n\nNetherRealm are now the masters of the story mode. Mortal Kombat 9 was a little rough, but now they have refined their craft to a diamond point. Mortal Kombat X retained the Test Your Luck features from the previous game and the Living Towers were okay. The Krypt has been revamped to be a first person adventure where specific items can open up new areas. You soon run out of things to do however and the chests get very expensive and earning more funds becomes boring.\n\nInjustice 2 dispensed with any kind of Star Labs mode, leaving us only with the Multiverse \u2013 which worked much like the Living Towers. It was nice to lose the \u2018Simon Says\u2019 missions where you have to perform moves and combos but now I don\u2019t get to be Selina Kyle\u2019s cat jumping over lasers! I don\u2019t for the life of me understand why the Multiverse gets any praise. Maybe after years of so much abuse when it comes to single-player, this seemed wonderful. It\u2019s not. Like Mortal Kombat 11, the modifiers just irritate: hazards to either block or jump over. Which forces you to be too cautious and defensive. It\u2019s not a fun way to play.\n\nNetherRealm almost admit as much because in their last two games now, you can simply let the computer do all the grinding for you with little penalty. I can\u2019t even imagine Project Soul giving you this option for all those dungeons in SoulCalibur II, which were merely a scuff on an almost perfect single-player campaign. That\u2019s because there was more genuine variety, more creative ways that Namco employed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Hmm, who could I be fighting next I wonder? Oh, Berserker! Well, colour me every shade of surprised! I\u2019ve only fought you in the five bazillion rooms leading up to this! I could never have guessed it would be you again!\u2019\n\nBut even in spite of this, Project Soul were able to sustain your interest far better than NetherRealm could. Some fights would see one of you go flying 20 feet up into the air whenever somebody scored a heavy knock-down hit, the edges of the stage could be explosive, you could be fighting on quicksand or, my personal favourite, ice. You would be right in thinking that any sort of fighter, 2D or 3D, would be the worst possible genre to feature a slippy slidey ice stage. And you would be right. But in the most hilariously entertaining way possible.\n\nBut in NetherRealm\u2019s last efforts, this sort of creativity has been very thin on the ground \u2013 leaving the story to do all the heavy lifting. Or, to put it a better way, the story mode in a NetherRealm game was always meant to be the appetiser to the main course. Now, they\u2019re the only thing that\u2019s worth eating. For what awaits you afterwards is a whole planet\u2019s worth of Brussels sprouts.\n\nOkay, I hear you, you may actually like Brussels sprouts. In which case, I don\u2019t know who hurt you but just know that you\u2019re safe now. Safe and loved. But this is a planet\u2019s worth, I\u2019m talking about. And not Mercury, either. Oh no, it\u2019s Jupiter alright. Just occasionally you might bite into a hint of soy sauce, a soup\u00e7on, if you will \u2013 but then it\u2019s back to nature\u2019s fart eggs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut hey, it is fun seeing all the character endings: Kronika even makes for an entertaining and not hideously cheap final boss. Shock horror.\n\nPresentation\n\nInitially, the character designs in a NetherRealm game could leave much to be desired. Things were getting better in Mortal Kombat X and some characters were starting to look quite good. Mileena in particular looked awesome. Very scary girl, I love her. Injustice 2 was something else entirely. The characters looked breathtaking, Keanu Reeves breathtaking. Much of the costuming was somewhat bland, but there were some gems there too.\n\nThen comes Mortal Kombat 11 and not only do you have the same level of stunning detail, the character models are bigger, making Injustice 2 duels seem as if they are too far away by comparison. The sound effects for the fatalities are what can truly elevate them to a more disturbing level. Especially one of Kabal\u2019s. Future trips to the dentist will be even more traumatic than they were before.\n\nAnd while it is fashionable to pile on Ronda Rousey, she is rubbish and she is in wrestling now, so she\u2019s used to it. Seriously, could they not have given Lucy Lawless a call? Xena as Sonya Blade anyone? Yes please!\n\nHandling\n\nThis gets better with each instalment in my view. Though, if you really must be an insufferable snob about there being a block button in a 2D fighter, you\u2019ve always got Injustice 2. But really, it doesn\u2019t matter. Stop pretending it does. It\u2019s that kind of disingenuous whinging that\u2019s actually stifling creativity in this genre. So shut up, nobody cares. Really. Nobody. Certainly not the professional tournament players who would be the first to complain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhere there is a real problem, is the pace of battles. Injustice 2 is smoother and faster than either Mortal Kombat but Mortal Kombat 11 does have its fast moments and is not as heavy as its predecessor. The \u2018poke poke\u2019 style of lengthening a combo is strange to behold and do \u2013 and I really couldn\u2019t tell you whether it\u2019s horribly cheap or elegantly accessible. Only the Elder Gods can decide.\n\nStructure\n\nAlways at least one character to unlock, then a whole truck\u2019s worth of cosmetics \u2013 some obviously better than others. The Mortal Kombat games will give you fatality and brutality inputs too, if you don\u2019t find them out for yourself. The Krypt has been fun to go through, giving you a meta-adventure to play that I personally find quite enjoyable. The loot is mostly random, but I don\u2019t really see that as a problem. There has been criticism of these modes, but I can\u2019t pretend to understand precisely what the problem is.\n\nThey definitely run out of steam long before you\u2019ve unlocked all the areas you can access. And Mortal Kombat 11 has three types of currency, which rightly prompted fears of microtransaction-fuelled shenanigans that thankfully came to nothing. Bu it still makes for an immensely long and arduous grind fest that gets dull very quickly. That\u2019s where the computer can come to your rescue. Turn it on for say, Noob Saibot, max out his combo and rushdown stats and let him loose on survival mode whenever you\u2019re low on coins.\n\nThat you almost need to do this is very troubling and it\u2019s clear that either NetherRealm are not getting the proper feedback or just not listening to it.\n\nCast\n\nInjustice 2 has a pretty great cast, really. There would have been riots at this point if they had not have included Harley. I\u2019ve never been entirely sold on the Joker\u2019s fighting style \u2013 he\u2019s not quite manic enough for my liking \u2013 but everybody else plays much like you would hope. I hardly ever play as Cheetah or Poison Ivy and that\u2019s not because they\u2019re bad, but they\u2019re probably not as instantly gratifying as others such as Wonder Woman or Flash.\n\nMortal Kombat on the other hand, has probably been living in Mortal Kombat 9\u2019s shadow all this time. That game features everybody from the 16-bit era, and Quan Chi for some strange reason, so nobody could bemoan the loss of a firmly established favourite. As such, when it comes to sequels, inevitably someone has to go for there to be room for newcomers. And some of those newcomers are great. The insectile D\u2019Vorah, old time gunslinger Erron Black, and the Master Blaster-inspired Ferra Torr. The \u2018Kombat Kids\u2019 as they have come to be known ether affectionately or mockingly, depending on your own view, were a little bland at first \u2013 playing like knock-off versions of the true classics. That said, Cassie Cage was made the hero of the story mode and was very funny and charming, which helped to win over a legion of fans.\n\nBut we lost Jade, Kabal, Nightwolf, Stryker, (I like Stryker, okay!) Sheeva, and Sindel. Mortal Kombat 11 looks set to restore a few of these names as DLC, except now Mileena is nowhere to be found. A character who has almost become the de facto female lead. And NetherRealm were lucky that hasn\u2019t backfired. Perhaps, like myself, we\u2019re hoping she\u2019ll be added back to the roster as DLC (a bit of a tacky move, but what can you do?) but that might be a forlorn hope.\n\nMortal Kombat 11 has only three genuinely new characters, but also two ancient names that have been revitalised in Frost and Skarlet. As I care nothing for tournaments, I think everybody plays pretty well. Of the new characters, I like Cetrion the best, her design if not her terrible name. Johnny Cage mocking it does not mean that it\u2019s not still a terrible name. What, is she an Elder God or a small, French car?\n\nOne of her intros has her walk in, flowers and greenery bursting into life under her crystalline boots like something out of \u014ckami! Cetrion is amazing and I will brook no argument to the contrary! So there!\n\nPost-launch support\n\nStrong, yet patchy. NetherRealm can drag their heels so badly on this, that if you\u2019re not a super-fan like myself, it is best to wait for any special editions that may come about. Mortal Kombat X famously got horror icons such as the alien, Jason Voorhees, and Leatherface \u2013 all well worth having, but obviously the alien was the star attraction. I don\u2019t have a special edition of Injustice 2, so I just bought what I fancied, like Starfire. She\u2019s pretty good. I\u2019ll get around to buying the Ninja Turtles at some point but they were a little too expensive, so I have to be feeling more flush.\n\nAnd finally, Mortal Kombat 11 kind of needed to have good post-launch support to lessen the horrific grind. I didn\u2019t suffer the worst of it, but it is still quite tedious. Shang Tsung was our first DLC character, modelled after and voiced by none other than Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa himself, who played the villain in the 1996 movie. He doesn\u2019t rock that long, dark mane these days but still boasts that oily and treacherous voice that is so perfect for the character. Hey, look! A bit of stunt casting that actually works! Well done, WB!\n\nNightwolf is out now, who is good. A solid all-rounder. With his spirit animal companions of bear, hawk, and wolf he reminds me more than ever of an old kids\u2019 cartoon Bravestarr, remember that one? \u2018Nightwolf! Strength of the bear! Speed of the puma!\u2019 Aaah. I\u2019m so old.\n\nNext we\u2019ll be getting the Arnie version of the Terminator, which has to be the greatest piece of guest casting in the genre\u2019s history. It almost makes up for Ronda Rousey being so rubbish. Then we will get my favourite: Her Majesty, Queen Sindel. Then an extremely youthful version the Joker who looks like he still attends high school and finally and Spawn, complete with cape! Nobody has ever managed to get his cape right in a game before and I believe that NetherRealm will be the first.\n\nAfter that? Who knows. Optimus Prime? Ash from Evil Dead? Rainbow Dash? I wouldn\u2019t bet against any of those. But I better be getting Mileena back, Ed! Or else I\u2019ll come for you! Oh yes, I\u2019ll come for you, Boon\u2026\n\nMultiplayer\n\nThis, sadly, is where NetherRealm have really taken options away over time. Mortal Kombat no longer has Test Your Luck in the latest game and no stage fatalities. So far. As such, both Injustice 2 and Mortal Kombat 11 feel very bare bones and limited in this area. Which is disappointing to say the least. The only thing you can do is swap out certain moves for the characters which won\u2019t hold your interest for very long.\n\nOnline\n\nOh wow! Kombat League? How very exciting, NetherRealm! Oh I just can\u2019t wait to \u2013 no! It\u2019s as boring as watching cement dry!\n\nUp next? Well, this series was seriously wounded\u2026 but the soul still burns!\n\nBy reader DMR\n\nBest fighting games of the generation, Part 1: Street Fighter V\n\nBest fighting games of the generation, Part 2: ARMS\n\nBest fighting games of the generation, Part 3: Tekken 7\n\nBest fighting games of the generation, Part 4: Dragon Ball FighterZ\n\nThe reader\u2019s feature does not necessary represent the views of GameCentral or Metro.\n\nYou can submit your own 500 to 600-word reader feature at any time, which if used will be published in the next appropriate weekend slot.
