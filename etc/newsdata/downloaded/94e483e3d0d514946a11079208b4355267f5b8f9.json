Dueling accusations of dishonesty and sabotage have derailed \u201cAlienstock\u201d \u2014 a Woodstock for alien watchers \u2014 which creator Matty Roberts promoted as alternative programming to any plans to storm the base on Sept. 20 despite officials\u2019 warnings.\n\nWith just over a week to go until the event, Roberts and the host town\u2019s website are both comparing Alienstock to the Fyre Festival, which was supposed to be held in April and May of 2017 in the Bahamas but became synonymous with \u201cepic failure\u201d and led to a fraud conviction. Roberts has pulled his name and support from the three-day gathering in Rachel, Nev., but the owner of a motel in the town who had signed up as a partner plans to go ahead.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no safety or security that can really be promised,\u201d Roberts told The Post on Tuesday, calling the event a potential \u201chumanitarian disaster.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t feel comfortable with inviting even my friends and family out to this event, let alone these thousands of strangers.\u201d\n\n[Half a million people signed up to storm Area 51. What happens if they actually show?]\n\nFor Roberts, it all fell apart unexpectedly. But the town of Rachel \u2014 where residents were reportedly less than pleased with the \u201cStorm Area 51\u201d media swarm \u2014 has expressed less surprise.\n\nThe outcome was \u201cjust as we had predicted,\u201d the town\u2019s website declares in red lettering. Officials in two counties prepared earlier to declare emergencies, unsure how many people might descend on rural Nevada.\n\n\u201cIf any event still happens it is going to be a pretty sad affair with no bands, very little infrastructure and a lot of unhappy campers,\u201d the statement continues, making a final plea for everyone to stay away.\n\nRoberts and fellow organizer Frank DiMaggio blame their ex-partner on the ground in Rachel: the inn owner who they say was handling most of the logistics and became increasingly evasive about her preparations as the big date approached. Little A\u2019Le\u2019Inn proprietor Connie West accuses them of betrayal, saying she has lined up the necessary infrastructure and support staff, confirmed performers and sold 2,400 camp sites.\n\nTwo documents shown on a local news program as evidence of her efforts were apparently finalized the day Roberts said he had pulled out. A $17,500 check for security services is dated Sept. 8; so is West\u2019s signature on an agreement for medical services.\n\nWest did not immediately respond to an inquiry from The Post.\n\nRoberts, a 21-year-old from Bakersfield, Calif., propelled to minor fame by the Area 51 phenomenon, said he got cold feet after DiMaggio, a more experienced planner brought in less than two weeks ago, deemed the event beyond help. Earlier, Roberts had been steering the festival with another college student.\n\n\u201cWe started asking the hard questions that these kids didn\u2019t know how to ask,\u201d DiMaggio said.\n\nSamuel Scheller, CEO of Guardian Elite Medical Services, told The Post his group is providing Alienstock with 16 medical staffers, a first aid tent, ambulances and more than half a ton of supplies. Local news outlet Action 13 News reported that it verified other preparations, too: agreements with companies to provide 130 portable toilets and police officers to supplement more than 250 first responders from state and local government.\n\nBut DiMaggio and Roberts say no proof of preparations materialized when they pressed West before splitting with her. They told The Post that Guardian Medical enlisted DiMaggio\u2019s help because West had \u201clost control\u201d of the event.\n\nScheller confirmed that he connected West and DiMaggio, another client of his, because he thought it could be a \u201cgreat partnership\u201d (DiMaggio had been denied a permit for his competing Peacestock 51 event in the area). Asked if he had doubts about West\u2019s preparations, Scheller declined to comment.\n\nRoberts, who was expecting about 10,000 people to attend Alienstock before his break with West, said the falling-out does not mean Area 51 fans need to stay home. They can head to Las Vegas instead for an \u201cArea 51 Celebration\u201d at a downtown events center. Organizers for that alternative Sept. 19 gathering invited Roberts on Monday to join them.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how many people could still show up to Rachel. West, tearful at times in footage aired by Action 13 News, says Alienstock is still on.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s saying they\u2019re coming anyway,\u201d DiMaggio said. \u201cI really hope that they\u2019re not.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nWhat we know about the mysterious vaping-linked disease and deaths\n\nThe Loch Ness Monster is still a mystery.
