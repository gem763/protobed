But on Sunday, it was her turn to be quizzed as she made an appearance on conservative commentator Ben Shapiro\u2019s show.\n\nCalling herself a fan and friend of Shapiro, McCain addressed a number of hot topics during The Ben Shapiro Show\u2019s \u201cSunday Special,\u201d including the death of her father, Sen. John McCain, his failed presidential bids and his dying regret that he had voiced support for the Confederate flag continuing to be flown. She also called being the go-to Republican on The View a \u201cprivilege,\u201d though she admitted that her views can drum up some \u201chostile\u201d and \u201ctriggered\u201d reactions.\n\nVideo: Meghan McCain Defends Husband\u2019s Controversial Shirts\n\n\u201cA lot of people don\u2019t know any Republicans or don\u2019t know any conservatives, so I\u2019m the voice they hear when they\u2019re tuning into The View, whether they like it or not,\u201d she told Shapiro.\n\nThe conversation also took a personal turn as the 34-year-old spoke about her marriage to Ben Domenech, a conservative writer and commentator who once slammed the idea of dating her on Twitter. And while McCain has publicly pushed back against criticism holding up her accountable for Domenech\u2019s political views as founder of right-wing online magazine The Federalist, she sees their shared Republican identities as a bonus.\n\n\u201cConservative men have better family values, and they take dating and family and marriage more seriously,\u201d McCain, who wed Domenech in 2017, told Shapiro.\n\nShapiro agreed, calling dating for reasons beyond values the \u201cbiggest mistake.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think if you\u2019re serious, which I was when I met my husband, about getting married and having kids and wanting to go to the next phase, I just found ... finally dating a conservative man was the one,\u201d she added. \u201cHe took it seriously.\u201d\n\nShe also praised Domenech for supporting her through the death of her father in 2018 and a miscarriage earlier this year.\n\n\u201cMy husband has been the most incredible [man],\u201d she shared. \u201cI hope every woman has the kind of husband I have. I say that as someone who dated every a*****e in West Hollywood possible before I met my husband.\u201d\n\nI really enjoy speaking with \u2066@benshapiro\u2069 for this weeks \u201cThe Ben Shapiro Show Sunday Special\u201d. He asked me questions no one ever seems to care to ask and truly listened. I am grateful for this conversation and for the work he does during this time of censorship. \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 pic.twitter.com/wGlPRXTwQe \u2014 Meghan McCain (@MeghanMcCain) October 6, 2019\n\nThe interview also saw McCain weighing in on cancel culture, saying, \u201cI do wonder how many people will be left at a certain point.\u201d\n\nShe added that, along with her love of guns, her opposition to abortion rights makes her critics \u201cthe craziest.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where I get the most hate from,\u201d she said, noting that Domenech was \u201cvery surprised\u201d to learn her stance when he asked her about the abortion issue on their first date.\n\n\u201cI was a few drinks in and I was like, \u2018I think abortion is abhorrent, I could never do it, you know, I don\u2019t understand the conversations that are being had right now,\u2019 and he was very surprised,\u201d she shared, and claimed that women approach her in private to thank her for speaking out against abortion rights.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "McCain said conservatives take dating more \"seriously\" and recounted calling abortion \"abhorrent\" on her first date with husband Ben Domenech.", "authors": ["Erin Donnelly"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/EkvJLxw12K5jq86ng44smg--~B/aD04MjY7dz05ODQ7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/d4830240-e864-11e9-b33b-79c7eed56b88", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
