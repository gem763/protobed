(Mason Trinca for The Washington Post)\n\nPresident Trump has ordered White House officials to launch a sweeping effort to address homelessness in California, citing the state\u2019s growing crisis, according to four government officials aware of the effort.\n\nThe planning has intensified in recent weeks. Administration officials have discussed using the federal government to get homeless people off the streets of Los Angeles and other cities and into new government-backed facilities, according to two officials briefed on the planning.\n\nBut it is unclear how they could accomplish this and what legal authority they would use. It is also unclear whether the state\u2019s Democratic politicians would cooperate with Trump, who has sought to embarrass them over the homelessness crisis with repeated attacks on their competency.\n\nTrump\u2019s directive is part of his broader effort in recent months to shine a light on problems in California and a number of major U.S. cities, including Baltimore and Chicago. He has complained about what he says are years of failed Democratic leadership that have led to sustained poverty and crime.\n\nTop officials representing the White House and the Department of Housing and Urban Development arrived in California this week for a round of meetings. A particular focus has been the \u201cSkid Row\u201d section of Los Angeles, officials said. The president is directly involved with the initiative, officials said, and has asked for updates.\n\nOfficials representing the Justice Department were also part of the tour, according to two government officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share details they were not authorized to discuss.\n\nAmong the ideas under consideration are razing existing tent camps for the homeless, creating new temporary facilities and refurbishing existing government facilities, two officials said. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because the planning hasn\u2019t been publicly revealed. The changes would attempt to give the federal government a larger role in supervising housing and health care for residents.\n\nThe talks are fluid and concrete plans had not been reached.\n\nTrump has repeatedly assailed Democratic politicians in California over the state\u2019s growing homelessness issue, which he has called a \u201cdisgrace to our country.\u201d He has also criticized liberal-led cities such as Baltimore as \u201crat and rodent infested.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of failing badly, has anyone seen what is happening to Nancy Pelosi\u2019s district in San Francisco. It is not even recognizeable lately. Something must be done before it is too late. The Dems should stop wasting time on the Witch Hunt Hoax and start focusing on our Country! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 28, 2019\n\nPlanning also involves officials from the Department of Health and Human Services. An administration official cited the need to act based on concerns about disease and sewage problems affecting the homeless.\n\nCity officials gave a tour of the Jordan Downs housing project in Los Angeles on Tuesday to a team that included federal officials from the Veterans Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Domestic Policy Council, the Justice Department and HUD, according to Branimir Kvartuc, spokesman for City Council member Joe Buscaino (D). About six city staffers and six federal officials were on that tour.\n\nA White House spokesman said Trump signed an executive order in June that pertained to affordable housing regulations, and that the administration is continuing to seek new solutions for homelessness. Trump\u2019s executive order created a new White House council on eliminating \u201cregulatory barriers\u201d that White House officials believe increase the cost of building new housing. Developers have said these restrictions drive up prices on housing and limit the supply.\n\n\u201cLike many Americans, the president has taken notice of the homelessness crisis, particularly in cities and states where the liberal policies are combining to dramatically increase poverty and public health risks,\u201d said Judd Deere, a White House spokesman. \u201cPresident Trump has directed his team to go further and develop a range of policy options for consideration to deal with this tragedy.\u201d\n\nHousing experts say homelessness in California has risen alongside housing and rental prices. That problem has been exacerbated by cuts to federal support for housing programs.\n\nOne Democratic congressman, Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), criticized Trump\u2019s push, saying \u201cyet again this is bravado for Trump\u2019s base with no interest in the actual policy experts\u2019 recommendations to solve an issue.\u201d\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom (D) added in a statement that Trump should first cease cutting health care for low-income Americans and curbing access to government benefits for immigrants, but that \u201cif the President is willing to put serious solutions \u2014 with real investment \u2014 on the table, California stands ready to talk.\u201d\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti (D) confirmed in a statement on Tuesday that his staff gave Trump administration officials a tour of a number of public housing projects and shelters in the city.\n\nBreelyn Pete, an aide to Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, told Politico that a \u201cvery large delegation\u201d of Trump administration officials is in town to meet with the mayor\u2019s office over the homelessness issue this week. Neither Pete nor the mayor\u2019s office responded to requests for comment.\n\nTrump previously hinted at potential unilateral federal action over homelessness, telling Fox News that he was \u201cvery seriously\u201d considering acting on the issue.\n\n\u201cYou take a look at what\u2019s going on with San Francisco, it\u2019s terrible. So we\u2019re looking at it very seriously. We may intercede. We may do something to get that whole thing cleaned up. It\u2019s inappropriate,\u201d Trump told Tucker Carlson in July. \u201cNow, we have to take the people and do something. We have to do something.\u201d\n\nCalifornia\u2019s homelessness crisis has intensified. The number of families either sleeping on the streets or lacking adequate housing has \u201cskyrocketed\u201d for most major California cities, climbing by at least 25 percent over the past several years, said David Garcia, policy director at the Terner Center for Housing Innovation at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\n\u201cGenerally speaking, all the major cities have seen incredible increases. It\u2019s a crisis,\u201d Garcia said.\n\n[Should people have a right to sleep on city streets? Texas joins national battle over urban homeless crisis.]\n\nBut the Trump administration may have already taken actions that have exacerbated the problem, critics allege, such as tightening immigrants\u2019 eligibility for federal assistance, which risks putting more families on the streets, Garcia added.\n\nCalifornia also lacks a \u201cright to shelter\u201d law that in other states gives homeless people temporary shelters, meaning a large percentage of California\u2019s homeless population ends up sleeping on the street or in their vehicles, according to Diane Yentel, president and CEO of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, a nonprofit group.\n\nComplicating matters, California has enacted a number of restrictive zoning laws that drive up the cost of housing by constraining the state\u2019s supply, she said, although some state lawmakers are pushing to relax those limits.\n\n\u201cSkid Row\u201d holds about 5,000 homeless people, an 11 percent increase from last year, according to statistics published in September by the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority.\n\n\"Homelessness in California is absolutely a crisis that demands action from the federal, state and local level,\u201d Yentel said, \u201cbut it\u2019s hard to imagine the Trump administration is acting in good faith to solve it when they have made so many efforts in the last two years to worsen the crisis.\u201d\n\nThe White House this year proposed cutting the HUD budget by 20 percent, eliminating the programs that build and preserve homes for the lowest-income people, Yentel said. It has also proposed cutting federal rental assistance for a quarter of a million families as well as evicting 55,000 children from subsidized housing.\n\nTrump\u2019s directive comes amid his feud with California politicians, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who represents San Francisco.\n\nSpeaking of failing badly, has anyone seen what is happening to Nancy Pelosi\u2019s district in San Francisco. It is not even recognizeable lately. Something must be done before it is too late. The Dems should stop wasting time on the Witch Hunt Hoax and start focusing on our Country! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 28, 2019\n\nTrump called California a \u201cdisgrace to our country\u201d at a rally earlier this year, and has fought with the state\u2019s Democratic lawmakers over a number of issues ranging from homelessness to protections for immigrants.\n\nAt a rally this year, he said: \u201cWhat they are doing to our beautiful California is a disgrace to our country. It\u2019s a shame.\"", "description": "Administration officials have discussed using the federal government to get homeless people off the streets of Los Angeles and other areas and into new government-backed facilities.", "authors": ["Jeff Stein", "Economic Policy Reporter", "Tracy Jan", "Reporter Covering The Intersection Of Race", "The Economy", "Josh Dawsey", "Reporter Covering The White House", "Ashley Parker", "White House Reporter", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/C-CI-Z8NAU0u2du9LljC6j_hVaI=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SLM7JNFK3QI6RGT5ZUYFAT7ZAI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
