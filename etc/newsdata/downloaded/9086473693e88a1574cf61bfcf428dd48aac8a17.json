His co-workers were unable to travel in the storm to get to work at the Hilton-owned hotel.\n\n\"Meet Satchel. He is the only employee here at Homewood Suites in Beaumont. The access road is underwater and [Interstate 10] is shut down due to flooding. We can\u2019t get in or go out. The hotel a mile from us is under water. Satchel has been here all night,\" Chandler wrote. She said in her Facebook post that she was a guest at the hotel during Smith's long hours.\n\nShe went on to commend Smith, a full-time college student at Lamar University, for his service. \"He has manned the phones, answered each of our questions, ensured that we have had a hot cup of coffee or tea, and helped serve us a hot breakfast,\" she posted.
