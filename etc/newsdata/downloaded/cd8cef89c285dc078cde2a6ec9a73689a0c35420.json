Here are arguments from both sides of the debate.", "language": "en", "text": "Earlier this month, a clash over the criminalization of sex work ignited in the nation\u2019s capital. Over the course of 14 grueling hours on Oct. 17, more than 170 people testified at the first-ever council hearing about a bill to fully decriminalize sex work in Washington, D.C. \u2014 including the buying and selling of sex. If the bill passes, the District will become the first U.S. city to decriminalize sex work, putting it at the vanguard of a growing movement that workers say would make them safer by preventing police abuse, increasing access to medical care and allowing them to make a living in the way that they choose. Many human rights groups and public health organizations agree: Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch support the full decriminalization of sex work, and the World Health Organization and the United Nations Population Fund say it would contribute to major global health gains.", "description": "Sex workers weigh in on what decriminalization would mean for their own lives", "authors": ["Abigail Higgins", "Abigail Higgins Is A Freelance Writer Based In Washington"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/r-vLMaKJCJD0dQw632H4D0ejbfw=/1200x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-thelily-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FKWDUYP2FJB4PKATZFAIN4GWAE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
