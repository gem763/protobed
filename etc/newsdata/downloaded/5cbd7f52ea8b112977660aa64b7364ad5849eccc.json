REUTERS/Zohra Bensemrs\n\nAt Thies prison, the country\u2019s second-largest, Adama and a handful of other young people move to the rhythm of their fencing coaches\u2019 instructions, the clicking of foils against one another the only sounds piercing the silence.\n\nArmed prison guards watch the training hall from a safe distance as the teenagers learn to position their wrists for an attack, sweat dripping down their masks. In a couple of hours, the sportsmates will be inmates again.\n\nThe weekly fencing school is part of an experiment to help young offenders learn discipline and respect for rules, aiming to smooth their reintegration into society. So far 300 girls and boys have undergone the training.\n\n\u201cBefore doing fencing, I used to get angry really quickly.\u201d said 17-year-old Adama, whose name has been changed to protect his identity. \u201cIn fencing, if you get angry easily, you won\u2019t get to stay.\u201d\n\nAdama says he\u2019s angry about the fact he\u2019s spent two years without a trial in Thies prison, in the west of the country. Like half of the nearly 1,200 inmates in Thies prison, he\u2019s still waiting to go to court for stealing.\n\n\u201cThe hardest thing is to be here (in prison) for years without going before a judge,\u201d said Adama.\n\nIn Senegal, like across much of West Africa, many prisons are overcrowded, with some inmates waiting for years before being tried.\n\nThe director of Thies prison, Mandiaye Ndiaye, said pre-trial detention there could last up to three years.\n\n\u2018THEY DON\u2019T REOFFEND\u2019\n\nFencing has been taught to inmates elsewhere, including France and the United States, but the group behind the Senegal training, For the Smile of a Child, says this is the first experiment designed by psychologists specifically to use the sport to help youngsters reintegrate into society.\n\n\u201cThey start respecting the rules, they are more disciplined,\u201d said Ndiaye. \u201cThose who have gone through the programme don\u2019t come back, they don\u2019t reoffend\u201d.\n\nWhile sport is common in prison, fencing requires a blend of athletic skills and calm calculation in order to predict an opponent\u2019s moves.\n\nThe rules were also adapted so that the teenagers raise their hand and acknowledge their own mistakes during a game, without the intervention of a referee.\n\nThe ministry of justice plans to extend the programme, launched in 2012, to a second prison in Kaolack, and to train prison guards in fencing so it can be replicated cross-country.\n\nAdama still has no idea when he\u2019ll go on trial, but fencing has given him something to look forward to.\n\nFor two hours a week, there are no prison walls, and he is a teenager again.", "description": "Teaching inmates how to handle swords may seem an unlikely approach to prison rehabilitation, but advocates believe the discipline it brings can help improve Senegal's overloaded youth penal system.", "authors": ["Anna Pujol-Mazzini", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1432009420&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J1DL-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
