This landmark bill comes as legislators nationwide struggle to keep regulations apace with the fast-growing, and notoriously inaccurate, technology.

A month earlier Brackeen revealed Kairos has turned down a contract with Axon, manufacturer of body cameras.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say an officer can identify 30 images an hour. If you were to ask a police department if they were willing to limit [recognition] to 30 recognitions an hour, they would say no,\u201d Brackeen told Gizmodo. \u201cBecause it\u2019s not really about the time of the officer. It\u2019s really about a superhuman ability to identify people, which changes the social contract.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Chronicle, the California Peace Officers\u2019 Association claims that no California law enforcement agencies currently use facial recognition technology in body cameras. But the newspaper reports that some agencies have considered adopting the technology.\n\nThe original bill would have created a permanent ban, but Ting compromised due to protests from the Peace Officers\u2019 Association and other police advocacy groups. For now, the law expires in 2023.", "description": "California will block police officers from including facial recognition technology in their body cameras, joining two US other states that have created similar laws \u2014 Oregon and New Hampshire....", "authors": ["Alex Cranz", "George Dvorsky"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/vhxo1qwrqmkccnf7nmh8.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
