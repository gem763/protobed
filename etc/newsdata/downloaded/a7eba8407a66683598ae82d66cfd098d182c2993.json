The Saudis would like others to fight that war, and the others are reluctant,\" said Dorsey, from the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore.\n\n- Markets nervous -\n\nInstead, the kingdom focused on restoring production at the plants, as the Saudi bourse slumped three percent when the week's trading began on Sunday morning.\n\nSaturday's explosions set off fires that engulfed the Abqaiq plant, the world's largest oil processing facility, and nearby Khurais, which hosts a massive oil field.\n\nSaudi's energy infrastructure has been hit by the Huthis many times before, but this strike was of a different order, abruptly halting 5.7 million barrels per day (bpd) or about six percent of the world's oil supply.\n\n\"The genie is out of the bottle,\" said Bill Farren-Price, director of the London-based RS Energy Group.\n\n\"It is now clear that Saudi and other Gulf oil facilities are vulnerable to this kind of attack, which means that the geopolitical risk premium for oil needs to rise.\"\n\nNo casualties were reported but the full extent of the damage was not clear, nor the type of weapons used, and reporters were kept away from the plants amid beefed-up security.\n\nA significant volume of oil production can be restored within days but Aramco would need weeks to reach full output again, Bloomberg News reported Sunday, citing unnamed sources.\n\nAramco has said it will dip into its reserves to offset the disruption, but the incident could affect investor confidence as its stock market debut looms.\n\nAs markets closely watch Saudi's ability to get its industry back on track, Aramco CEO Amin Nasser said Saturday that \"work is underway\" to restore production.\n\nAnd newly appointed Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said part of the drop would be offset by drawing on vast storage facilities designed to be tapped in times of crisis.\n\n- Loggerheads -\n\nFollowing a phone call between US President Donald Trump and Prince Mohammed, the White House condemned the attacks on \"infrastructure vital to the global economy\".\n\nTehran and Washington have been at loggerheads since May last year, when Trump pulled the US out of a landmark 2015 deal with world powers that promised Iran relief from sanctions in return for curbs on its nuclear programme.\n\nDespite the US accusation, the White House said on Sunday Trump may still meet his Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhani at the upcoming United Nations assembly.\n\nThe attacks drew condemnation from UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who urged all parties to exercise \"maximum restraint\", as well as from the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, a 57-member pan-Islamic body.\n\nBritain, France, Germany and Riyadh's main Gulf allies including the UAE also criticised the attack.\n\nSaudi Arabia has spent billions on military hardware but recent events have underscored the vulnerability of its infrastructure to attack.\n\nIn recent months, the Huthis have staged repeated cross-border missile and drone attacks targeting Saudi air bases and other facilities in what they say is retaliation for the Riyadh-led bombing campaign on rebel-held areas in Yemen.\n\nburs-ac/dwo", "description": "Saudi Arabia raced on Sunday to restart operations at oil plants hit by drone attacks which slashed its production by half, as Iran dismissed US claims it was behind the assault.
