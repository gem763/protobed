Four thousand of his employees will lose their jobs instead. And shareholders in SoftBank will have to swallow losses of 30 per cent on their shares in the past six months \u2014 the share price has fallen as the obvious idiocy of the WeWork investment became clear.\n\nEven an awful lot of small shareholders who think the only thing they need to do about WeWork is be a little amused will find, if they look a little closer, that they have been hit too. The Baillie Gifford Japan Trust, usually a top performing fund, and one that is very popular with retail investors in the UK, has, for example, 5 per cent of its assets invested in SoftBank.\n\nThese miserable stories have at least one more thing in common: they are a new twist on what economist John Kenneth Galbraith called the \u201cbezzle\u201d.\n\nIn his 1955 book on the 1929 Wall Street crash, Galbraith suggested that \u201cembezzlement is the most interesting of crimes\u201d. It is, he said, the only one of the various forms of theft that comes with a time lag. So \u201cweeks, months, or years may elapse between the commission of the crime and its discovery\u201d.\n\nDuring that period things are good. The person who will eventually end up with the money knows he will have and keep it. Those who will lose it don\u2019t yet know they will. They think it is permanent wealth \u2014 even if it is really what Galbraith referred to as \u201cpsychic wealth\u201d.\n\nBeyond Meat is among a host of recent listings in the US that all loss-making. Bloomberg\n\nThis happy period is the bezzle. All booms have it \u2014 the more relaxed and trusting everyone is and the more freely money is available, the more bezzle you get.\n\nThe Woodford and WeWork scandals, while fitting the mould pretty well, are not of course exactly this kind of bezzle (there is, as far as we know, no fraud involved, no crime and no actual intention to impoverish others).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead they are examples of the way our distorting easy-money environment can work to transfer large amounts of cash from ordinary savers to ridiculously overconfident individuals \u2014 a modern type of bezzle, the defining feature of which seems to be not so much theft from but lack of concern for the financial futures of those who support you.\n\nSet up a company, do amazing PR at a time when more money than sense is looking for a home (thank you loose monetary policy), expand in such a way that no one is much bothered by the impossibility of profitability, make the game last at least until you are rich, and you have a modern bezzle.\n\nLook at the recent listings in the US. There\u2019s been Spotify, Uber, Lyft, Beyond Meat and Snapchat, to name a few. They\u2019re all loss-making. They mostly justify this on the basis that the way to success these days is not to chase profits but to chase market share while producing significant amounts of techno-babble about how much the data you will collect as you pay to dominate your market will one day be worth.\n\nShareholders don\u2019t receive any income from them now; they just get to pay ultra-high valuations and imagine that they might one day. Or not. Uber\u2019s own IPO prospectus, while looking for a $US100b valuation, noted that it \u201cmay not achieve profitability\u201d.\n\nAre these malinvestments driven by the endless upward price momentum provided by super-low interest rates? Absolutely. And given that not only may they never make money, but also that their founders and managers know they may never make money, are we in the middle of a modern bezzle? Absolutely.\n\nThese companies are only part of the bezzle, of course \u2014 cheap money creates psychic profits anywhere. You can argue that the bezzle dynamic exists throughout the tech sector in the US, where valuations have risen without increases in the earnings meant to underpin them.\n\nThe good news is that we are also seeing examples of the end of modern bezzles (or the end of illusions, at least). WeWork is the obvious one, but in the UK, Metro Bank is a neat example too. It had a big personality at the top; aggressively over expanded; listed at rather too high a valuation and will now make losses for the foreseeable future. The share price has fallen 90 per cent from its highs.\n\nThings change as economies slow \u2014 as the global economy is now. Then, said Galbraith, audits become \u201cpenetrating and meticulous\u201d and those to whom we give our money are \u201cassumed to be dishonest\u201d until proven otherwise. That bit of the cycle might be nearly upon us.\n\nThe writer is editor in chief of MoneyWeek\n\nFinancial Times", "description": "In both WeWork and Woodford, the disaster can be seen as a direct result of arrogance-driven over-expansion.
