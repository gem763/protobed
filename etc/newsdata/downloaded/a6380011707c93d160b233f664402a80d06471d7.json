Adam Schiff, Jerry Nadler and Elijah Cummings said that Giuliani had \"admitted on national television that, while serving as the president\u2019s personal attorney, he asked the government of Ukraine to target former Vice President Joe Biden.\"\n\n\u201cIn addition to this stark admission, you stated more recently that you are in possession of evidence\u2014in the form of text messages, phone records, and other communications\u2014indicating that you were not acting alone and that other Trump Administration officials may have been involved in this scheme,\u201d the chairmen wrote.\n\nThe subpoena calls on Giuliani to produce the documents by Oct. 15.
