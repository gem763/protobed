She told a friend that Durst beat her but did not press charges over the incident.\n\nOn top of that, she had asked Durst for a $250,000 divorce settlement but he canceled his wife\u2019s credit card and removed her name from their joint bank account and refused to pay her tuition fees.\n\nAt the same time Kathleen disappeared, Durst had been dating Prudence Farrow for three years and was living in a separate apartment.\n\nDurst was married to Kathleen (Picture: HBO)\n\nKathleen was last seen by someone other than Durst on January 31, 1982, when she made a surprise appearance at a dinner party thrown by her friend Gilberte Najamy in Connecticut.\n\nGilberte noticed that Kathleen looked upset and was wearing red tracksuit bottoms, which he thought was odd because she usually dressed better.\n\nKathleen then left for South Salem, New York after receiving a call from her husband.\n\nAlthough the couple argued and fought, Durst maintained that he put his wife on a train to New York City, had a drink with a neighbor, and spoke to his Kathleen by telephone later that evening.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018That\u2019s what I told police,\u2019 Durst later told documentary filmmakers of The Jinx.\n\n\u2018I was hoping that would just make everything go away.\u2019\n\nAfter leaving Gilberte\u2019s house the pair had planned to meet at a pub in Manhatten, but when Kathleen failed to show up he became concerned and repeatedly called the police.\n\nDurst filed a missing persons report several days later and he initially offered $100,000 (\u00a377,713) for his wife\u2019s return, then reduced the reward to $15,000 (\u00a311,657)\n\nLess than one month after Kathleen went missing, he was seen throwing away her possessions, which he denied.\n\nKathleen\u2019s body has never been found but was declared dead in 2017.\n\nSusan Berman\n\nSusan Berman was a longtime friend of Durst and was killed, execution-style in her home in California on 24 December 2000.\n\nBefore her death, she had provided Durst with an alibi after Kathleen\u2019s disappearance and had also received $50,000 (\u00a338,856) from him.\n\nDurst and Susan were friends (Picture: HBO)\n\nDurst is known to have been in Northern California days before Susan was killed, and to have flown from San Francisco to New York the night before her body was found.\n\nHe did confirm to the LAPD that he\u2019d recently sent Susan $25,000 (\u00a319,428) and faxed investigators a copy of her 1982 deposition regarding his missing wife, but he declined to be questioned further on Susan\u2019s murder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a 2005 deposition, Durst said that Susan had called him shortly before her death to say the LAPD wanted to talk about his wife Kathleen\u2019s disappearance.\n\nMorris Black\n\nMorris Black was Durst\u2019s neighbour and was killed in Texas in 2001.\n\nDurst was convicted of dismembering Morris and scattering his remains in Galveston Bay and he claimed he shot the victim in self-defense.\n\nThe property mogul was later acquitted of the murder in 2003, but he later served time in prison after pleading guilty to a number of charges including tampering with evidence.\n\nAlthough the documentary The Jinx led to Robert\u2019s arrest, his trial has been put back until January 2020 due to various factors including \u2018serious surgery\u2019.\n\nThe Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst is available on Sky Crime.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
