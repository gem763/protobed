Everyone who heard her was shocked because they were just kids being kids.\n\n'Her boyfriend and the company manager quickly stepped in to whisk her away, while one of the mums took charge of taking the kids to another area.\n\n'But obviously bosses heard what happened and were very unimpressed with Sheridan. The next we heard, her contract was not being renewed.'\n\nMailOnline has contacted representatives for Sheridan for further comment.\n\nStatement: However, Sheridan took to Instagram to deny the claims and insisted no such incident ever took place (pictured in May 2019)\n\nThe newspaper reported that a representative for the actress confirmed she would not be returning for another run in Joseph next year, but said her stint was always meant to be a once-off.\n\nIn May, Sheridan sparked rumours she and Jamie had married in secret. Sheridan uploaded two snaps to Twitter - one featuring Jamie with a ring on his wedding finger.\n\nThe other saw her cuddling up to her partner, one hand on his chest, sporting what appeared to be an engagement ring and a wedding band.\n\nHowever she shut down speculation that she is secretly married after she also called him her 'hubby' in a now deleted Twitter snap.\n\nSheridan was quizzed about her marital status during an appearance on This Morning last month.\n\nSheridan wrote: 'The story today is completely untrue, the kids in the show were the only reason I stayed the whole run' (pictured in July 2019)\n\nShe set the record straight by insisting that the couple have not tied the knot, before hinting that their big day could be right around the corner.\n\nSheridan explained: 'I do wear two bands on my hand, mainly because this one is too big and it does keep it on.\n\n'But Jamie does wear his wedding ring, we're not actually married, we just do it. My friends do that but no one actually talks about it.\n\n'We didn't think about it when we took a picture and put it on Twitter and then of course everyone thought that we were married.'\n\nSheridan met Jamie on mobile dating app Tinder 20 months ago, and now lives with him at her country home in Kent.", "description": "The Sun reported that the actress, who plays the narrator in the show, lost her temper at a final show after-party and shouted at castmembers between he ages of 11 and 13.", "authors": ["Sean O'Grady For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/16/19658374-0-image-a-97_1570979236297.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
