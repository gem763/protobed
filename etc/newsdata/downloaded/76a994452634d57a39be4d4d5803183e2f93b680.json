Guys who have been on (British and Irish) Lions trips as well and won important games in those series,\u201d Jones told reporters.\n\n\u201cIf you look at this group, they\u2019ve been through a lot of must-win matches. Grand Slams as well. So we\u2019re well-blessed in that department in the sense the guys are used to tough knock-out rugby,\u201d added Jones.\n\nWing George North said this semi-final had \u201ca better feeling about it\u201d than the 2011 match against France where Wales went in as \u201ca bit of an unknown\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis time, it feels like we\u2019ve earned our place.\u201d\n\nRugby Championship winners South Africa have twice lifted the Webb Ellis Cup \u2014 in 1995 and 2007 \u2014 and are hoping that the 12-year pattern between trophies will continue.\n\nBut Wales have had the better of recent encounters between the two sides, winning the last four Tests \u2014 after losing all but two of the first 31 fixtures.\n\nHowever, they lost 23-19 to South Africa in the 2015 Rugby World Cup quarter-final, with current Springbok fly-half Handre Pollard kicking 18 points.\n\nJones said he was expecting a kick-heavy game based around forward domination, with Springbok coach Rassie Erasmus again naming a replacements\u2019 bench including six huge forwards and two backs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very, very physical game every time you play South Africa,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe expect the ball to be kicked a huge amount to us. It\u2019s making sure we deal with that threat and when we have the ball, being smart with it,\u201d said Jones.\n\nHe stressed that centre Jonathan Davies, who is returning from injury, was \u201c100-percent fit and raring to go\u201d to continue his midfield partnership with Hadleigh Parkes.\n\nAnd while the loss of Liam Williams was \u201cdisappointing,\u201d Jones again pointed to the experience that replacement Leigh Halfpenny would bring to the match.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got Leigh Halfpenny with 85 caps, two Lions tours, played in the semi-final of a World Cup. He\u2019s a wonderful player. Brings a different dimension to the back line,\u201d said Jones.\n\nThe winners on Sunday face either defending champions New Zealand or England \u2014 who play later Saturday \u2014 in the final on November 2, also in Yokohama.", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 Wales are hoping the experience of \u201cmust-win\u201d Test rugby in their squad will make the difference for the Six Nations", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/25/50cc30_attack-coach-stephen-jones-was-squad-welsh-team-lost-france-in-2011-wales-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
