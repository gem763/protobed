When he spots fans approaching him, he can guess what project of his they\u2019re going to gush about.\n\nThat\u2019s what happens after 35 years of an actor\u2019s unicorn ideal of a career: an array of projects that, in almost comical fashion, couldn\u2019t be more diverse. And each with a fan base armed with atypical encyclopedic knowledge and insatiable curiosity about almost every single detail.\n\nHe can tell if someone is, say, going to lead with Twin Peaks\u2014on which he played Special Agent Dale Cooper in the original 1990 series, the 1992 film, and 2017 revival\u2014before transitioning into about a dozen questions about working with director David Lynch on Blue Velvet. He can peg the Showgirls aficionado, likely sporting a mischievous grin and ready to ask about what may be cinema\u2019s most preposterous sex scene, and perhaps the film\u2019s cult status, too. There is even a certain kind of Portlandia fan.\n\nBut there\u2019s one group he\u2019s yet to entirely pin down, he tells me. \u201cThe Sex and the City versus the Desperate Housewives people.\u201d He had arcs on both as WASP-y husband to respective main characters. \u201cBut I embrace it all.\u201d\n\nNEWSLETTERS The Daily Beast\u2019s Obsessed Everything we can\u2019t stop loving, hating, and thinking about this week in pop culture.

He is now a supporting actor on a CBS multicam sitcom, laugh breaks and all.\n\nLast Thursday, he made his debut as Dr. Stephen Frost on Carol\u2019s Second Act, a new series from Emily Halpern and Sarah Haskins, the writers of Booksmart and creators of ABC\u2019s canceled-too-soon Trophy Wife. It stars Patricia Heaton (Everybody Loves Raymond, The Middle), as a newly divorced woman who, with her kids now grown, decides to embark on a \u201csecond act\u201d as a doctor, navigating new waters teeming with guppies as the oldest intern at a hospital.\n\n\u201cI think it is a little unusual,\u201d MacLachlan grins, to say the least of this move from his last regular series role on Twin Peaks: The Return to a broadcast sitcom in the tradition of Everybody Loves Raymond and The Big Bang Theory. He\u2019s serenely pragmatic about it all, while discernibly taking a certain amount of glee in people\u2019s impressed reactions to yet another curveball career move: a shrug with a matching cocked eyebrow.\n\n\u201cPortlandia was something that was very different and unexpected,\u201d he says of the hipster satire, on which he played the Mayor of Portland. \u201cI didn't even know what that was when I signed on. I\u2019d just met Carrie [Brownstein], and then I met Fred and I was like, well, these are great people. This is an interesting thing. Why not join in and see what we do?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the same kind of laissez faire outlook that locked him into a major network comedy series for the first time in his career (one that, by the way, scored the highest ratings of any new series during broadcast\u2019s premiere week).\n\nMacLachlan first showed a certain flair for bringing off-kilter laughs to a multicam audience playing the recurring character of George Van Soot (\u201cThe Captain\u201d) in seven episodes of How I Met Your Mother.\n\nThere, he worked with veteran TV director Pamela Fryman, who happened to also be helming the Carol\u2019s Second Act pilot. Then he learned Patricia Heaton was involved, someone who, after two nine-season runs on Everybody Loves Raymond and The Middle, with a splashy, if short-lived stint opposite Kelsey Grammer on Back to You in between, may be the most successful modern sitcom actress there is today.\n\n\u201cI follow people, and then I follow my gut reaction to the people,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought, \u2018This might be fun. Let\u2019s see what happens.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt is both startling and titillating to discover upon meeting him that Kyle MacLachlan, at this moment, has gone full silver fox. That indelible, clean-cut side part is still there, framing the familiar rock-ridge jawline and chameleonic smile. But now it\u2019s all gray.\n\nHis is a special kind of look, the kind of handsomeness that, in countless profiles over the years, gets dissected, element by element, to determine how it\u2019s allowed the actor to so slickly slide into disparate genres. A one-millimeter difference in the pitch of his smile or the angle of his chin can mean a transformation from dashing Mr. Right to unsettling psychopath. Rolling Stone\u2019s Rich Cohen described it in a \u201990s profile as \u201cthe boy next door, if that boy spent lots of time alone in the basement.\u201d\n\nHis good looks have been his very own Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. And now they\u2019re also Daddy.\n\nIt\u2019s fitting then that, speaking to a ballroom full of TV critics and journalists at a Television Critics Association press conference for Carol\u2019s Second Act earlier this summer, Patricia Heaton remarked, after never having met MacLachlan before, that he\u2019s \u201cthis really lovely, kind of old-timey gentleman who stands when ladies come into the room.\u201d\n\nMacLachlan kind of melts, hunching his shoulders bashfully when I bring this up a few hours later, when we meet. He rolls his head to the side, displaying what could only be described as an \u201caw, shucks\u2026\u201d face. He repeats this action every time I bring up a compliment, reference the longevity or diversity of his career, or, hell, even laugh at something he says.\n\n\u201cIt was nice for her to recognize that and say that,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I was younger, I sort of resented that [description]. As I\u2019ve gotten older, I really embrace it.\u201d\n\n\u201c Patricia Heaton remarked, after never having met MacLachlan before, that he\u2019s \u2018this really lovely, kind of old-timey gentleman who stands when ladies come into the room.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIt is perhaps head-slapping obvious to say that a show like Carol\u2019s Second Act lives and dies on the chemistry of its leads. Heaton and MacLachlan have it in spades, based on the first episode\u2019s tease of a possible romantic storyline. \u201cWe\u2019ve been having fun, sort of goofy time together,\u201d he says, calling Heaton \u201cextraordinary.\u201d\n\nHolding court in front of a group of journalists, the actress lived up to the hype, relaying a series of uproarious personal anecdotes to explain her connection to the show.\n\nWhen working with MacLachlan was brought up, she brought everyone\u2014her co-star included\u2014to stitches when she said, \u201cI thought Blue Velvet was one of the most disturbing, awful two hours of my life that I\u2019ll never get back, and I plan to exact my revenge in the coming years.\u201d\n\nMacLachlan is still laughing about it when we connect. \u201cThat\u2019s the first time she shared that with me,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was hilarious. And I totally get it! It\u2019s a very disturbing film. Two hours that she can\u2019t get back.\u201d\n\nThe idea of second acts are sensitive and personal. That\u2019s reflected in the series, which has some rather profound grace notes flying off the zingers, one-liners, and broad comedy. But it\u2019s a topic that strums at an exposed nerve in the world of Hollywood, where, at its most cynical, a person tends to be valued only as much as their most recent hit. An actor\u2019s entire career is arguably in pursuit of their next act. That the concept of \u201cacts\u201d is so inextricable from age\u2014to some, a curse word in this business\u2014only makes the whole conversation all the more delicate.\n\nHeaton spoke candidly about this. The series arrived after her nine-year run on The Middle concluded. Her kids were grown and had essentially left the house. Suddenly she felt a bit at sea: no longer a full-time mom, and no longer with her stable actress job. \u201cI very much felt the things that a person like Carol would feel of, \u2018Who am I without these things?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cPatricia is incredibly believable as the woman going through this journey,\u201d MacLachlan says. \u201cAnd she has no problem putting her personal feelings and her personal life out there. I think if you're going to tune in and follow a story, she's definitely the one that you want to watch to lead this journey.\u201d\n\n(To wit, when a reporter asked Heaton about the optics of aging the character of Carol, who is in her fifties in the series, down a decade, she was hilariously frank: \u201c I am 61, and I don\u2019t have a problem with that. So it wasn\u2019t that. And, in fact, I kept saying to Emily and Sarah, \u201cI don\u2019t think people will really believe I\u2019m in my fifties, right? Do I need to do gray in my hair?\u201d They\u2019re like, \u2018No. You don\u2019t need to do anything.\u2019 I have sort of a dysmorphia about how I look. I\u2019ve always thought I looked like Angelina Jolie until I looked in the mirror, and then I realized I don\u2019t. I felt that it was more realistic that Carol was in her fifties because I look like I\u2019m in my fifties.\u201d)\n\nTalking about the series\u2019 themes makes MacLachlan reflect on his own personal Carols, so to speak, and what he\u2019s learned from them: the \u201cstrong women\u201d he\u2019s been surrounded by in his life. He speaks about his mother specifically, who embarked on her own second act when she was in her forties, becoming the public relations director for his local school district where he grew up in Yakima, Washington.\n\nLooking back at his own career, he can see a second act, and a third act, and even more. \u201cEvery time I take a job, it\u2019s this new, overwhelming thing,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re challenged by new things. You\u2019re around different people. You need to prove yourself again.\n\nAs for confronting his age, the dashing new gray hair is one thing. (Cue the \u201caw, shucks\u2026\u201d smile.) But figuring out how that plays into his career is another.\n\nHeaton joked that her perfect scenario, as she sees \u201cdeath getting nearer and nearer,\u201d would be to die on a soundstage. \u201cThat\u2019s how I want to go...Full hair and makeup when it happens so that the photos are good. Then as long as I\u2019m No. 1 on the call sheet when it happens, so I get top billing in the news article.\u201d\n\nMacLachlan betrays no sort of existential angst about his career, which turns 35 in December on the anniversary of the 1984 premiere of Dune, which gave him his first screen role.\n\nSome things he chases. Some things come to him. Sometimes that sees him, against all odds, playing Special Agent Dale Cooper again, more than 25 years later. Sometimes that sees him on a soundstage scoring laughs in a Patricia Heaton sitcom...or playing Thomas Edison (in the upcoming biopic Tesla)...or even playing President Franklin D. Roosevelt (the recently announced Atlantic Crossing series).\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll continue doing it until they say, \u2018You know what? You\u2019re falling over and you can\u2019t remember your lines. You\u2019re going to have to retire now.\u201d\n\nI do dutifully ask him the lame Twin Peaks questions. Will there be another season? \u201cI don\u2019t think very likely, but never say never.\u201d Would he want to do one another? \u201cYes, immediately. I would.\u201d\n\nDepending on what scenes or projects you think of first when you think of Kyle MacLachlan\u2014and lord knows there is a host of avenues to run down there\u2014all this earnest niceness could theoretically be jarring. However, I have to say, it is extremely calming. And delightful. (Did you know he had his own line of Pacific Northwest wine? More, that it is called Pursued by a Bear?)\n\nA commotion starts as he\u2019s being physically yanked through a door for a photo shoot, which he interrupts to collect and center himself. He wants to make sure he shakes my hand and says thank you.
