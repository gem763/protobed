Retailers report that despite some improvement in the predicted rate of flow of freight traffic across the Channel in a no-deal Brexit, the timing of Brexit Day comes at the worst possible time, with warehouses full of Christmas stock and the UK at peak dependence on European imports for fresh produce.\n\nOne top retailer told me that whereas it had more than four weeks of supply in warehouses for the original March Brexit date, its current supplies are between nine and 14 days.\n\nBlame game fears\n\nRetailers are trying to work out exactly how to deal with a possible consumer response to no-deal. As the published Yellowhammer document puts it: \"There is a risk that panic buying will cause or exacerbate food supply disruption.\"\n\nRetailers are particularly concerned that should the government, for immediate political reasons, play down the specific narrow risks to some fresh food supply, consumers will not be prepared on 1 November and will be difficult to reassure.\n\nOne retailer has been reviewing the sensitivity of consumers to shops' \"just-in-time\" supply chains in previous supply disruptions, such as the fuel crisis and the \"Beast from the East\" snow disruption.\n\n\"It took two weeks to get full supplies back to normal,\" one chief executive told me.\n\nImage caption Retailers are finding it difficult to stockpile supplies\n\nOf specific concern is the interaction between social media and and localised supply shortages. In particular, the industry is wondering who exactly will reassure consumers not to stockpile.\n\nSome insiders, present at key planning meetings, believe the lack of trust of large parts of the public in politicians mean that reassurances from government ministers designed to stop panic-buying could provoke the opposite response.\n\nHowever, those retailers concerned by an emerging Brexit blame game are also increasingly sceptical that it is their job to be reassuring about the consequences of government policy not of their making.\n\nIt was revealed in Welsh government no-deal papers released this week that a \"UK-wide table top exercise to test the coordinated response for the disruption to food supply and potential public response\" has been scheduled for the end of the month.\n\nThe administration in Cardiff is believed to be particularly concerned about the impact on more remote communities at the end of supermarket supply chains. It has allocated \u00a32m to spread food bank coverage more widely, in anticipation of rising food prices.", "description": "The \"clear-the-air\" talks follow a recent row over no-deal Brexit's effect on fresh food supplies.", "authors": ["Faisal Islam", "Economics Editor"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0C3C/production/_108223130_foodpa.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
