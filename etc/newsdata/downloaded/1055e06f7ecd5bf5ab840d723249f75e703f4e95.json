The centre produced the Soviet Union's first nuclear weapons.\n\nIt is still a closed city accessible only with special passes.\n\nREAD: Russia nuclear accident: Force of the blast threw staff into the sea\n\nRosatom said the accident occurred while a missile was being tested on an offshore platform in the far northern Arkhangelsk region.\n\nFuel exploded and the blast blew staff into the sea, it said.\n\nRussia's military initially said two people had been killed in the accident and it was not known whether they were among the five that Rosatom reported.\n\nThe nearby city of Severodvinsk recorded elevated radiation levels following the accident and panicked residents rushed to buy iodine to counteract radiation.\n\nAlexander Chernyshov, deputy head of research at the Sarov nuclear centre, said in a video statement on Sunday that researchers had checked levels in Severodvinsk and confirmed a brief spike.\n\n\"The radiation background level was exceeded twofold and lasted no more than an hour,\" he said.\n\n\"Neither our experts nor outside experts have recorded any remaining radioactive contamination,\" Chernyshov added.\n\nProfessor Jeffrey Lewis of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies said his \"working hypothesis\" was that the blast was related to the 9M730 Burevestnik nuclear-powered cruise missile, known by NATO as SSC-X-9 Skyfall.\n\nIn February, Putin said that tests on the Burevestnik were going successfully.\n\nA state commission is investigating the accident.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
