It\u2019s not real. Science, technology, it\u2019s all fake. It\u2019s a projection of white fantasies that has worked to control our interpretation of how the world works.\u201d That\u2019s the statement of a college debate professor talking with his class. He added, \u201cNone of us have had the privilege of going to f**king space to verify that there\u2019s these stars and these galaxies and these planets.\u201d\n\nPart of me would love for this to be a clever hoax but I don\u2019t think it is. Nine months ago this same university student, Michael Moreno, made a splash when he posted a video that showed him losing a debate because he quoted Ben Shapiro. Now he\u2019s back with a lengthy recording of his debate professor preparing for a debate about international cooperation in space, i.e. should nations team up to put solar panels in space? But rather than sticking to the topic, the professor introduces a heavy dose of postmodernism mixed with intersectionality.\n\n\u201cImagine someone who grew up inner-city, Kansas City for instance, who never left a 20-block radius,\u201d the professor suggested. He continued, \u201cThey can\u2019t even fathom that there\u2019s mountains in the world let alone that there\u2019s something outside of that\u2026And so structural inequity, to some degree, because of our lack of privilege in terms of mobility determines what we can understand to be real and falsifiable.\n\n\u201cWhiteness then works and then appropriates science and technology to say \u2018This is true while this is not true because it\u2019s not verifiable.\u2019\u2026It\u2019s a hyperfocus on the experiential for those who does not capitulate with whiteness.\u201d\n\nAt this point, Moreno asked a couple of simple questions: \u201cSo what about telescopes or black astronauts who have been to space?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat black astronauts have been to space?\u201d the professor asked.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been like fourteen. If you just Google \u2018black astronauts\u2019 there\u2019s a lot of them,\u201d Moreno replied.\n\nThe professor argued that not all astronauts have actually gone to space. Moreno replied by citing this Wikipedia page which includes photos of 14 black astronauts in space suits.\n\n\u201cDid you just use in an academic space, you just cited Wikipedia?\u201d the professor asked. So it\u2019s okay to question the existence of the planets, four of which can be seen in the night sky without a telescope, in an academic setting, but citing Wikipedia is a bridge too far!\n\nWhen Moreno argued that the experience of these astronauts proves space exists and is real, the professor countered that, since he hadn\u2019t personally been to space, he could verify that it\u2019s not real. \u201cYou can verify that space isn\u2019t real because you haven\u2019t been there?\u201d the student said.\n\n\u201cMy life is evidence of the fact that space does not exist,\u201d the professor replied.\n\nAs the debate goes on, the professor suggested that maybe the black astronauts are participating in whiteness, meaning\u2026actually I\u2019m not sure how that works but he seems to think it made sense.\n\nMoreno eventually compared the claim that space does not exist to another claim: \u201cParis doesn\u2019t exist because I\u2019ve never been there.\u201d\n\n\u201cCorrect,\u201d the professor replied.\n\nWhen Moreno pointed out there is lots of evidence that Paris exists, the professor began talking about colonialism. And that\u2019s just the first few minutes of the audio below. The segment after this features the professor comparing international cooperation for the purpose of space exploration to \u201cgang-bangs.\u201d And later still, some students suggest sending all white people on a one-way trip into space. It\u2019s a reverse Day of Absence on a global scale.\n\nI think the clip speaks for itself but I\u2019d just say that back when the Evergreen State College meltdown happened, professor Bret Weinstein said that after the push for social justice had triumphed in the humanities departments it would eventually wind up knocking on the door of the sciences. I think this video suggests he was correct about that. If you\u2019ve put a premium on identity and \u2018lived experience\u2019 you\u2019re eventually going to want to discount claims of truth that might contradict or supersede those personal views.\n\nUpdate: I contacted Michael Moreno for more information about where this happened. He replied \u201cThis happened at Weber State University, Utah. The professor is Ryan Wash.\u201d He also pointed out that he\u2019d uploaded a new video offering some additional details:", "description": "\"So what about telescopes...\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-Moreno.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
