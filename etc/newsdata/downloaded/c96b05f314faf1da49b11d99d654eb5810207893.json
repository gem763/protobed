Camila Cabello teases her sophomore project and takes a new direction on the bold \u201cShameless.\u201d The Highwomen make the case for supergroups and bring Sheryl Crow into the fold on \u201cHeaven Is a Honky Tonk\u201d off their powerhouse collaborative album. And Adam Lambert shows that he\u2019s got an infectious style well beyond his work with Queen on \u201cSuperpower.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat You Did,\u201d Mahalia feat. Ella Mai\n\nMahalia is a voice to know in the emergent generation of R&B singers: a silky-sounding young British artist whose music has smoky corners and elegant edges. \u201cWhat You Did,\u201d off her new album out today, Love and Compromise, is a prime example. Sampling Cam\u2019ron and Juelz Santana\u2019s 2002 hit \u201cOh Boy,\u201d Mahalia makes good use of that track\u2019s lush beat while singing evocatively about mistakes. \u201cYeah, you know I love you but I can\u2019t forgive it,\u201d she sighs. \u201cYou could tell me stay, but I have to go.\u201d Crooner Ella Mai comes in for a beautiful assist, and when they duet it\u2019s a warm, comforting embrace. The song may be about the dissolution of a relationship, but endings sound sweet coming from Mahalia.\n\n\u201cShameless,\u201d Camila Cabello\n\nCamila Cabello\u2019s first solo outing, the self-titled Camila, was an album of intimate, stripped-down pop that let her play with the expressiveness of her voice and clever writing. \u201cShameless,\u201d one of two new songs off her upcoming sophomore album Romance and a follow up to late-breaking summer hit \u201cSe\u00f1orita\u201d with Shawn Mendes, sees Cabello go in a new direction: power pop-punk with a dark edge. Cabello\u2019s voice has always been best matched with slinky lyricism, but on \u201cShameless\u201d she explores new potential with a sound that\u2019s more in the tradition of the guitar-driven angst of Avril Lavigne and some eras of Pink. \u201cI need you more than I want to,\u201d she keeps repeating, baring a fresh intensity.\n\n\u201cSuperpower,\u201d Adam Lambert\n\nMulti-talented singer-songwriter-actor-American-Idol-star Adam Lambert has spent the bulk of his time since 2012 with Queen + Adam Lambert, in a role as a frontman for the legendary band that Lambert has performed admirably. But don\u2019t forget that Lambert is a solo artist as well, one who excels in funk and soul grooves. \u201cSuperpower\u201d is the latest single off Velvet: Side A, the first half of his next solo project. It\u2019s got a gritty guitar, juicy bass and lots of funk, with an extra electric guitar riff and gospel choir bridge just to up the ante; it\u2019s born for the dance floor. Turns out, Lambert\u2019s superpower may just be putting on a stylish show across genres.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Sheryl Crow\n\nThe Highwomen \u2014 the quartet of country-folk star-power that is Carlile, Hemby, Morris and Shires \u2014 are kind of a big deal. Not only are they four distinctive voices in the genre coming together for a collaborative album, but also each of these artists is currently at the peak of her game: Hemby was a critical songwriter for the A Star Is Born soundtrack and Nashville hitmaker, Carlile just won a bunch of well-deserved Grammys, Morris is one of the most in-demand young country stars, and Shires is a talented musician, singer and writer with a history of working with impressive acts. So the fact that they carved out the time for this supergroup is a feat in and of itself. Their new album, as encapsulated in \u201cHeaven Is a Honky Tonk,\u201d is a beautifully crafted joint effort filled with specific songwriting, lovely harmonies and aching acoustic twists that takes past classics and country tropes \u2014 in this case, Ray LaMontagne\u2019s song of the same name \u2014 and reshapes it into something new and all their own. This one also gets a boost from the addition of Sheryl Crow, a veteran of the genre who sounds right at home in this squad.\n\n\u201cDecember,\u201d IDK\n\nUnless you\u2019ve been paying very close attention, Maryland-based rapper IDK\u2019s debut major-label release Is He Real? might have come as a surprise this week. The mysteriously-named artist (it stands for Ignorantly Delivering Knowledge) tapped a top notch list of contributors; you\u2019ll hear Tyler, The Creator, Pusha T, J.I.D., DMX, Burna Boy and others throughout the album, which focuses on questions of the metaphysical but keeps things relatable. \u201cDecember,\u201d featuring Nigerian artist-of-the-moment Burna Boy, is a moody love song of a rap; IDK slips between singing and rapping effortlessly. \u201cWhen I saw you I remembered / The feeling of, the feeling of December,\u201d he muses in an introspective slow-burn towards love.\n\nWrite to Raisa Bruner at raisa.bruner@time.com.", "description": "New music from Camila Cabello, Mahalia with Ella Mai, Adam Lambert, IDK, and The Highwomen with Sheryl Crow.", "authors": ["Raisa Bruner"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/camila-cabello.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
