But when navigating the internet, security experts say, a little bit of deliberation often pays off by keeping your data more secure.\n\n\u201cWe all have day jobs, but to a hacker, we are their day jobs,\u201d says Adam Levin, former director of the New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs and founder of CyberScout, which helps individuals and businesses deal with cybersecurity threats. \u201cIt\u2019s not a fair fight.\u201d\n\nThis National Cybersecurity Awareness Month, here are four routine things to stop doing online \u2014 and a few alternatives from cybersecurity experts.\n\n1. Recycling passwords\n\nStudy after study shows that a majority of people reuse passwords across sites. This lets a hacker who uncovers your password in a data breach of one site easily use it elsewhere.\n\nBut what to do when everyone from your dog groomer to your grocery store wants you to create a login? Doug Jacobson, director of Iowa State University\u2019s Information Assurance Center, recommends separating accounts into security tiers. The most sensitive \u2014 such as your financial accounts \u2014 should all get a unique, robust password. Slightly less sensitive accounts can share a set of strong passwords, and the least crucial, ones with little or no personal data attached, might share the same password.\n\nTo create a solid password, Levin suggests choosing a phrase that would be tough for others to guess and changing key characters: making an \u201co\u201d a zero or turning a 1 into an exclamation point. You can also use a password manager, such as 1Password or LastPass, to create and store strong passwords that are random character strings.\n\n2. Granting all the permissions apps request\n\nMany apps ask for access to certain aspects of your phone\u2019s data when you download them. And while it\u2019s understandable that Google Maps wants to know your location, says Kurt Rohloff, director of the Cybersecurity Research Center at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, other apps have less transparent intentions when collecting your data.\n\nAlso see: This 30-second change to your computer settings is the easiest way to stop hackers\n\nYour data might be used simply for marketing purposes, but unless you\u2019ve done a deep dive into who\u2019s making all your apps, it\u2019s better to be cautious. Apps should have \u201cthe bare minimum [information] they need to provide services,\u201d Rohloff says.\n\nIf you\u2019ve already given an app too much access, try adjusting its permissions in your phone\u2019s settings, Rohloff says. For directions, click here if you have an Android, and here if you have an iPhone. And if that breaks the app, find an alternative.\n\n3. Oversharing on online account applications\n\nYou probably know the pitfalls of posting vacation updates \u2014 hello, burglars \u2014 or giving your Social Security number just because a form has a blank for it. Any personally identifying information you disclose that falls into the wrong hands can \u201c[give] hackers a pathway into your life,\u201d Levin says.\n\nWhen creating an online account, Jacobson says, \u201cGive them only the information that has the star by it,\u201d indicating a required field. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to fill out your full profile.\u201d\n\nAnd you need not always be truthful, either. For example, you can supply a fake mother\u2019s maiden name or high school mascot for security questions, Levin says. \u201cNo website is going to conduct a national security clearance to see if you are who you say you are,\u201d he adds.\n\n4. Trusting appearances\n\nScam emails don\u2019t always come complete with typos and graphics from 1997 to tip you off. In fact, Jacobson says, he recently received an email from a hacker masquerading \u2014 somewhat convincingly \u2014 as his boss, asking for money. These messages can also harvest your account information or install malicious software on your computer.\n\n\u201cAlways independently confirm who that company is or who that individual is through another source,\u201d Levin says. That might involve calling the supposed sender to confirm the request. Make sure to use a number you know is safe \u2014 for example, one you find on your bank\u2019s own website as opposed to clicking through the email.\n\nRelated: Everything you wanted to know about data breaches and privacy violations \u2014 after Door Dash hack hits 4.9 million people\n\nAnd if you\u2019re ever entering payment information, look for the padlock symbol on your browser window. \u201cWhat the padlock ensures is that the website you typed in is the one you went to \u2026 and the communication is encrypted,\u201d Jacobson says.\n\nBeing cautious keeps you safe\n\nPausing to consider your clicks definitely makes the internet less convenient. But when you receive services free online, Jacobson says, \u201cyou typically are paying for them with your information.\u201d That doesn\u2019t mean you have to delete all your accounts, but you should ask yourself if the service you\u2019re receiving is worth the information you\u2019re giving up.\n\nLuckily, for most people, identity theft is a crime of opportunity, Jacobson says. So taking even small steps to safeguard your data can make you a less tempting target.\n\n\u201cGenerally, my attitude about this is, something is better than nothing, and small things are better than no things,\u201d Rohloff says.\n\nMore from NerdWallet:", "description": "You probably do them routinely.
