It took her ten years to share her trauma with others.\n\n\"I numbed my pain for so many years,\" Kuter told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone.\n\nWomen in South Africa, a nation with a history of violence and profound inequality, have endured a spate of rapes, kidnappings and murders in recent years.\n\nAround 3,000 women were murdered in 2018 - around one every three hours - which is more than five times higher than the global average, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nKuter's walk aimed to show that \"everyone deserves to be safe\" in a country where only three in 10 women feel comfortable walking at night according to the 2017 Women, Peace and Security Index.\n\nKuter crossed five South African provinces and was joined along the way by students, survivors of sexual assault and parents of children killed in violent crimes.\n\n\"I feel exhausted but happy. There is not one emotion I have not experienced,\" she said.\n\nWhile walking across the country she dressed in yellow, the colour of the clothes worn by the man who raped her.\n\n\"It is actually such a happy colour,\" she said.\n\n\"We cannot give rapists control over our lives. The rape will always be a part of me, but I make a decision every day to not let it define me,\" Kuter said.\n\nKuter said she raised around 200,000 rand ($13,000) for counselling and emergency comfort packs for rape survivors.\n\nAfter mass protests against gender-based violence last month, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced plans to tackle the violence by strengthening the criminal justice system and training counsellors.\n\n\"We need to listen to girls and women when they speak out. We need to believe them,\" said Kuter. (Reporting by Kim Harrisberg @kimharrisberg; Editing by Tom Finn.
