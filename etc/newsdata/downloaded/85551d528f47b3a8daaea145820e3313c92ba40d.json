They agreed that they could see a pathway to a possible deal,\u201d the pair said in a joint statement.\n\nMarket participants saw the statement as surprisingly confident, and some felt it could be pointing to a real chance that a no-deal Brexit, the nemesis of financial markets, could yet be avoided.\n\n\u201cThe announcement is decidedly upbeat in its tone and while it stops well short of suggesting a deal is imminent it has been warmly welcomed in the markets,\u201d said XTB\u2019s Cheetham.\n\nThere is still a lot of uncertainty ahead, independent economist Julian Jessop told AFP.\n\nBut \u201cmarkets clearly think a deal is potentially back on again, boosting sterling\u201d, he said.\n\n\u2013 Key figures around 1540 GMT \u2013\n\nLondon \u2013 FTSE 100: UP 0.3 percent at 7,186.36 points (close)\n\nParis \u2013 CAC 40: UP 1.3 percent at 5,569.05 (close)\n\nFrankfurt \u2013 DAX 30: UP 0.6 percent at 12,164.20 (close)\n\nEURO STOXX 50: UP 0.9 percent at 3,493.96\n\nNew York \u2013 Dow: UP 0.9 percent at 26,585.50\n\nTokyo \u2013 Nikkei 225: UP 0.5 percent at 21,551.98 (close)\n\nHong Kong \u2013 Hang Seng: UP 0.1 percent at 25,707.93 (close)\n\nShanghai \u2013 Composite: UP 0.8 percent at 2,947.71 (close)\n\nEuro/dollar: UP at $1.1019 from $1.0971 at 2100 GMT\n\nDollar/yen: UP at 107.96 yen from 107.48 yen\n\nPound/dollar: UP at $1.2305 from $1.2206\n\nEuro/pound: DOWN at 89.56 pence from 89.89 pence\n\nBrent North Sea crude: UP 1.0 percent at $58.87 per barrel\n\nWest Texas Intermediate: UP 1.4 percent at $53.30\n\nburs-jh/cw", "description": "London (AFP) \u2013 Global stock markets rose on Thursday, jolted into action by a Donald Trump tweet offering a glimmer of hope for quick success in", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/10/6d3297_if-markets-are-suddenly-fantasizing-us-china-trade-deal-equity-markets-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
