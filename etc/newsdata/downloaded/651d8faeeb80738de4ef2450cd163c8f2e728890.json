In 2014, Hunter Biden was a board member of a Ukrainian energy company called Burisma Holdings.\n\nAccording to a report by Bloomberg in May, the prosecutor general in Ukraine said there was no evidence that either of the Bidens committed any wrongdoing.\n\nThe older Biden was asked by reporters Saturday if he ever had discussions with his son about Hunter's business dealings. He denied ever doing so.\n\nHe then turned the discussion back to President Trump.\n\n\"I know Trump deserves to be investigated,\" Biden said. \"He's violating every basic norm of a president.\"\n\nBiden has called for the release of the phone transcript of the Trump conversation.\n\nEarlier Saturday, Trump in a series of tweets doubled down on his stance that he did nothing wrong in his conversation with the Ukrainian president.\n\nHe called it \"a perfectly fine and routine conversation\" where \"nothing was said that was in any way wrong.\"\n\nAs NPR reported Friday, President Trump dismissed the whistleblower allegations as a \"political hackjob.\"\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that Trump \"repeatedly pressured\" the Ukrainian leader \"about eight times\" to work with his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, on a probe of Hunter Biden.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that the conversation also included an unspecified \"promise\" made by President Trump.\n\nA little more than two weeks after that conversation, on Aug.12, the acting Inspector General of the Intelligence Community, Michael Atkinson, said his office received a disclosure involving an alleged \"urgent concern.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has so far ignored calls to release the contents of the whistleblower complaint, even though congressional Democrats say they are legally entitled to the information.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a statement Friday, that Congress \"must be sure\" the administration is engaging in national security and foreign policy that's \"in the best interest of the American people.\"\n\n\"The Administration's blocking of Acting [Director of National Intelligence] Joseph Maguire from providing Congress with the whistleblower complaint violates the federal statute, which unequivocally states that the DNI 'shall' provide Congress this information,\" Pelosi said.\n\nTrump on Saturday accused the media and Democrats of trying to protect the Democratic front-runner.\n\nHe even gave the controversy a new moniker: the \"Ukraine Witch Hunt.\"", "description": "Former Vice President Joe Biden was reacting to reports that President Trump pressured Ukraine's leader to investigate Biden's family.", "authors": ["Brakkton Booker"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/09/21/gettyimages-1160433372_wide-e504c3dbbc123f5ac859ff87cb103c63ba9731ca.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
