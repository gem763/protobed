The human body is remarkable.\u201d\n\nEd has almost recuperated from his surgery on July 9, while his sister, Colleen Henry, 46, is doing well despite a longer recovery period as a donor recipient. For more than a decade, she struggled with a rare hereditary condition called primary biliary cholangitis, an autoimmune liver disease that destroys the bile ducts and can lead to scarring of the liver. Her symptoms included extreme fatigue, itchy skin and a progressively yellowing complexion.\n\nThanks to her brother\u2019s donation, she should be able to live a normal, healthy life, said her surgeon, Sander Florman, director of the Recanati/Miller Transplantation Institute at Mount Sinai in New York.\n\n\u201cAt this point,\u201d Florman said, \u201cit\u2019s safe to say that Colleen will die of something else like the rest of us, not liver disease.\u201d\n\nEd said he hopes to be back on the air at Fox later this fall, 20 pounds lighter and with a new appreciation for his liver \u2014 the only internal organ that can regenerate itself.\n\n\u201cWhen I initially told a friend that I was going to donate part of my liver to my sister, he exploded and said, \u2018What? You can\u2019t do that! You can\u2019t live without your liver!\u2019 \u201d Ed recalled. \u201cHe had no idea, and to be honest, early on, neither did I. Most people don\u2019t know that this is possible, so it\u2019s been a fantastic thing to help raise public awareness.\u201d\n\nBecause Colleen\u2019s new liver needs to grow by 70 percent, her recovery process is more slow and difficult, she said. But she is already feeling more upbeat than she has in years.\n\n\u201cMy doctors are encouraged by my progress, and that gives me confidence that every day will get better,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m home taking it easy, and know that I\u2019ll feel better and better as my new liver regenerates.\u201d\n\nHer brother\u2019s donation was the ultimate gift of sacrifice and selfless love, added Colleen, a single mother of two teenagers who also works two jobs as a salon receptionist and a supermarket customer service clerk in Long Island.\n\n\u201cI truly believe he saved my life and that he is the bravest of superheroes,\u201d she said. \u201cI adore my brother and would likewise do anything for him. My gratitude will never be enough.\u201d\n\nLive donor liver transplants are rare, making up only 4 percent of such transplants in the United States, said Florman, noting that Mount Sinai has done about 400 live donor liver transplants since 1998.\n\nThe biggest risk to donors is the possibility of infection, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not risk-free, but in the right hands, with the right safeguards, it should be able to be done safely,\u201d Florman said. \u201cWe have a massive team to take care of the people like Ed who step up to do this.\u201d\n\n\u201cLiving donations is an area we went into hoping we\u2019d go out of business,\u201d he added. \u201cThe reality is that we need more people to sign up to become deceased donors.\u201d\n\nMore than 16,000 Americans are on the national transplant list for a new liver, Florman said, but 10 to 15 percent will die waiting.\n\n\u201cWe do living donations because we have to,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd for every person who goes through the intense process to become a donor, another four or five get turned down because not everyone\u2019s liver can be split in a way to donate. There\u2019s not a dotted line on the liver that says \u2018cut here.\u2019 It\u2019s complicated.\u201d\n\nIn Ed\u2019s case, the surgical team was able to take the smaller left side of his liver and implant it in his sister, Florman said.\n\n\u201cThat will help him to recover faster and it\u2019s also safer [than cutting into the larger right side],\u201d he said. \u201cIt really is a big operation.\u201d\n\nEd calls his sister the real hero of the story \u201cfor battling this so bravely for so long. For years, she\u2019s endured a lot of pain.\u201d\n\nShe was diagnosed 10 years ago but kept her condition to herself for as long as she could, not wanting to worry her children, her parents and her only sibling. Then in May 2018, doctors told her it was time to place her name on the national liver transplant waiting list.\n\n\u201cThe good news was that I didn\u2019t have to wait for a cadaver donor,\u201d she said, \u201cbut the bad news was that I was to start searching for a live donor and was advised to start with a sibling.\u201d\n\nShe couldn\u2019t imagine asking her brother.\n\n\u201cI was concerned about the tremendous sacrifice donating an organ would be, and the implications on his health, well-being, family and career,\u201d she said.\n\nUnbeknown to Colleen, her brother had already stepped up.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d put on my reporter\u2019s cap and asked some of her friends what was going on, then I decided to reach out to doctors at Mount Sinai where Colleen was being treated by a liver specialist,\u201d Ed said. \u201cI told them I wanted to explore the possibility of becoming a live donor.\u201d\n\nHe turned out to be a perfect match for his sister, providing that he lost 10 to 15 pounds to cleanse fat from his liver.\n\n\u201cColleen wanted to shoulder everything on her own,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I was ready to do this. I went into this with a real mission: I wanted to help somebody I love.\u201d\n\nColleen said she felt \u201cemotionally overwhelmed\u201d by his decision.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always had a strong sibling bond,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I was distressed about asking him. I feel beyond blessed and grateful.\u201d\n\nOn the night before the transplant, they gathered at one of Ed\u2019s favorite Italian restaurants in Manhattan for a seafood dinner with a couple of Colleen\u2019s friends and Ed\u2019s wife, Shirley. Reminiscing about their childhood in Deer Park, Long Island, they tried not to think about the operation the following morning.\n\nThe morning of the surgery (about a six-hour procedure for Ed and eight hours for his sister), the siblings held hands as they were prepped and wished each other strength through tears, Colleen said.\n\n\u201cThe anticipation leading up to the surgery was tremendously stressful,\u201d she said. \u201cBut all the care, concern, love, prayers and support carried us through.\u201d\n\nAlthough he confessed that he felt like he\u2019d been \u201crun over by a truck\u201d when he woke up after the surgery, Ed was on his feet 48 hours later, toasting a successful operation with his sister over paper cups filled with apple juice.\n\nAt his three-week checkup, doctors told Ed his liver function was normal and that most of the organ had already grown back.\n\nBut nothing means more to him than the weekly texts he receives from his sister, celebrating each milestone.\n\n\u201c \u2018It\u2019s our one-week anniversary,\u2019 Colleen will write,\u201d he said. \u201cOr, \u2018it\u2019s our two-week anniversary.\u2019 Our three-week anniversary. I love you.\u2019 That brings it all home.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nHospitals, patients sue to block new liver transplant rules\n\nLiver transplant distribution changed after years of debate\n\nA daughter\u2019s gift to her mother saves two lives", "description": "In ultimate gift of sacrifice and selfless love, cable news journalist gives part of his liver to his ailing sister.
