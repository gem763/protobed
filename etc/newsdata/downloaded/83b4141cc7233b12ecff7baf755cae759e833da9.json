It starts with a $10 million television and digital ad buy in the four early voting states.\n\nCampaign manager Roger Lau, in an email to supporters Tuesday, said the ads are going up in Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire and South Carolina. Mr. Lau wrote that the \"eight-figure\" outlays \"will be more digital than old-school broadcast television.\"\n\nThe campaign rolled out three ads that it said were a sample of what it would put on TV. The longest, titled \"Root Out Corruption,\" is a 60-second version of Ms. Warren's stump speech. \"When we have a government that works for the rich and the powerful and leaves everyone else behind, it's corruption pure and simple,\" Ms. Warren says in the ad.\n\nThe other two ads are shorter. \"Not Too Hard\" recounts her public career, from founding the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to beating a Republican incumbent to win her Senate seat in Massachusetts. Another, \"Why Our Government Won't Act,\" ties together all her policy proposals under a theme of anti-corruption.\n\nThe Massachusetts Democrat has been ascendant this summer, and her team is eager to keep the momentum going through the fall. A recent poll showed Ms. Warren ahead of former Vice President Joe Biden for the first time in Iowa.\n\nMs. Warren is also adding paid organizers, including state directors, in states that will hold nomination contests in March, after the first four states. She's focusing on Illinois, Michigan, California, Maine, Minnesota, Georgia, Florida and Texas.\n\nThose are delegate-rich states that are significant in the primary for different reasons. California has the biggest delegate prize. Michigan and Minnesota represent part of the \"blue wall\" that Democrats will try to rebuild in 2020 after President Trump made inroads there in 2016. Georgia and Texas are traditionally Republican states where Democrats want to make Mr. Trump play defense in 2020. Those states also have House and Senate races in which Democrats see an opening to improve their ranks in Congress.\n\nMr. Lau also said the campaign was expanding its grassroots canvassing and other forms of outreach, such as phone-banking.\n\nWrite to Joshua Jamerson at joshua.jamerson@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 24, 2019 11:23 ET (15:23 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
