And some days it\u2019s hard to write your feelings of your not in the right place.\n\n'The last few weeks I\u2019ve been in a really weird place... I find it hard to talk about it .. I guess it\u2019s anxiety and pressure of life ... and when I actually reached out to someone they said I was draining. I feel like this is why some people keep their emotions to themselves.\n\n'I certainly hate talking about my feelings. And being a burden is my biggest fear.... I\u2019m lucky to be able to pick myself up when things feel s**t. But what happens if someone can\u2019t . Be nice to people. You never know what\u2019s going on . Ever'.\n\nCaroline previously revealed she struggles with her anxiety more when she has free time.\n\nSpeaking on Loose Women last year, she explained: 'Weirdly the anxiety I got more when I'm not working. Work takes away my anxiety, doing live TV takes away anything else. Being on stage I'm less nervous than just being me.'", "description": "Chris Taylor hilariously mocked Caroline Flack as he recreated her recent nude Instagram snap on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Connie Rusk For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/11/19828390-0-image-a-27_1571306424421.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
