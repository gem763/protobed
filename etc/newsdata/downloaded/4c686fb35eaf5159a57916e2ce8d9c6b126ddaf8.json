Harmony Korine's \"The Beach Bum,\" starring McConaughey, opened with $1.8 million in March, which was the worst opening for a wide release on over 1,000 screens at the time, and one of the worst openings of the actor's career.\n\nWhile STX Entertainment is flying high with \"Hustlers\" in theaters, STX released two bombs in two weekends earlier this year: the animated \"UglyDolls\" and \"Poms,\" which had the worst opening for a movie in over 2,700 theaters.\n\nThe first major bomb of the year, director Joe Cornish's \"The Kid Who Would Be King,\" opened just $7 million in January and ultimately made $32 million worldwide. It was made for $60 million.\n\nEven some superhero movies have crashed and burned. \"Hellboy\" failed to spark excitement last month due to a poor release date, awful reviews, and other factors. It's made just $21 million and was made for $50 million. And the \"X-Men\" dud \"Dark Phoenix\" was a huge misfire.\n\nThe latest flop is Warner Bros.' \"The Goldfinch,\" which had the worst opening of the year so far over the weekend for a movie in over 2,500 theaters.\n\nBelow are 13 box-office flops this year, in order of release date:", "description": "The latest major box-office bomb of the year is Warner Bros.' adaptation of \"The Goldfinch.\" Here are the biggest 2019 flops so far.", "authors": ["Travis Clark"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d5167bbcd97840853274e72-750-375.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
