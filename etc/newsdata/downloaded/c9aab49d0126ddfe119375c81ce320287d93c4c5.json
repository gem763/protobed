Chief operating officer Jeff Wilpon announced the plans Tuesday on the 50th anniversary of New York winning its first championship, the 1969 NL East title, with a pitching staff led by Seaver and Koosman.\n\n\u201cThis honor isn\u2019t only for me and my family, it\u2019s for the legions of fans I grew to love,\u201d Koosman said in a statement. \u201cTo know that my number will be retired and sit alongside other team legends is one of the greatest tributes I could ever be granted. I was always proud to be a Met. Today, I am even prouder.\u201d\n\nWilpon surprised Koosman with the news during a recent phone call.\n\n\u201cHe was so excited, I don\u2019t think he really understood what was happening,\u201d Wilpon said. \u201cTo hear the excitement in his voice as it sunk in and he understood what the magnitude of this honor was, it was really great to be part of that. \u2026 He was honored to be the next guy.\u201d\n\nThe Mets have also retired the numbers of ex-managers Casey Stengel (No. 37) and Gil Hodges (No. 14). Jackie Robinson\u2019s No. 42 was retired by all major league clubs in 1997.\n\nKoosman will be the first player not elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown to have his uniform number retired by the Mets.\n\n\u201cI think we see the fans want it and I think now that we\u2019re 50 years-plus in the making, that there\u2019s time to do it,\u201d Wilpon said. \u201cThere\u2019s a plan going forward for Hall of Fame and number retirement that we\u2019re going to spread \u2018em out, not to overload anything. But I think we have a plan to catch up and do some neat things for the fans.\u201d\n\nCurrent manager Mickey Callaway has been wearing No. 36 but said he was glad to switch. He changed to No. 26 for Tuesday night\u2019s game against Miami.\n\n\u201cI jumped on that,\u201d Callaway explained. \u201cThis guy\u2019s legacy needs to be cemented on the side of the stadium here.\u201d\n\nKoosman pitched for the Mets from 1967-78 and won twice during the 1969 World Series, throwing a complete game to beat heavily favored Baltimore 5-3 in the clincher. He was at Citi Field in late June for anniversary ceremonies saluting those Miracle Mets.\n\n\u201cI think it bookends our celebration of the \u201869 season pretty well,\u201d Wilpon said.\n\nThe 76-year-old Koosman ranks third in franchise history with 140 wins, most among left-handers. He is second in starts (346), complete games (108), innings (2,544 2/3) and shutouts (26), third in strikeouts (1,799), and sixth in ERA (3.09). He went 4-0 in the postseason with the Mets.\n\nThe two-time All-Star was a close runner-up to Hall of Fame catcher Johnny Bench for NL Rookie of the Year in 1968, when Koosman won 19 games with a 2.08 ERA and seven shutouts. He finished second to San Diego\u2019s Randy Jones in 1976 Cy Young Award voting.\n\n\u201cJerry is one of the most iconic Mets of all-time and this forever honor is a tremendous representation of what he meant to the organization,\u201d Wilpon said in the statement.\n\nKoosman was scouted by the Mets while he was pitching with the U.S. Army. He was inducted into the club\u2019s Hall of Fame in 1989.\n\nThe date of next year\u2019s ceremony for Koosman will be announced in the coming weeks, the Mets said.\n\n\u201cThe excitement of playing for the Mets when we won the 1969 World Series was an experience I never thought I\u2019d be able to repeat,\u201d Koosman said. \u201cBut the news that the Mets Hall of Fame Committee has voted to retire my number is another life-changing thrill and honor.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Jerry Koosman will become the third New York Mets player to have his number retired by the team.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Mike Fitzpatrick"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/24/mets_koosman_honored_baseball_75295_c0-151-2637-1688_s1770x1032.jpg?66c123cb59d56551b3cbfde2e505d8cebc013d9c", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
