One senior Kurdish official warned the fighters could break out as the violence intensifies.\n\n\u201cIf Daesh (Islamic State) camps or prisons are in the safe zone, we are responsible,\u201d Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told a rare briefing with international media.\n\nTurkey would ask the home countries of foreign Islamic State prisoners in its zone to take them back. If the foreign countries refuse - as many have - \u201cit is our responsibility that they (the Islamic State prisoners) are held accountable and not released,\u201d he said.\n\nTurkey would not be responsible for Islamic State prisoners held in other parts of Syria, he added.\n\nTurkish President Tayyip Erdogan defended Turkey\u2019s operation in a fiery speech on Thursday, dismissing global criticism and threatening to send more than 3 million Syrian refugees into Europe.\n\nHe also reiterated a plan to settle millions of Syrian refugees in the \u201csafe zone\u201d in northeastern Syria, saying Turkey aimed to realise this with international funding.\n\nThe EU has said it will not provide any financial aid to Turkey for the plans. But Cavusoglu said that if the bloc refuses to provide assistance, refugees will \u201cbe their problem too\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is not blackmail or anything,\u201d Cavusoglu said. \u201cThis is the common challenge that our societies have been facing.\u201d", "description": "Turkey will take responsibility for Islamic State prisoners in a \"safe zone\" it aims to form in Syria after its military incursion there, the foreign minister said on Thursday, responding to fears the militants could escape in the chaos.", "authors": ["Tuvan Gumrukcu", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
