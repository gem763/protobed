President Franklin D. Roosevelt famously used his fireside chats to buoy the nation\u2019s spirits during the Great Depression and World War II \u2014 but he also used the weekly radio address to make the case for his policy proposals, allowing him to circumvent a polarized news media and reduce the complexities of government into language that all Americans could understand.\n\nJust as FDR found a way to maximize the political utility of radio \u2014 still a relatively new technology at the time \u2014 with his fireside chats, President Trump uses social media to communicate with Americans in a new and engaging way. After FDR demonstrated the political value of radio, future presidents felt obliged to copy his example, turning the format into a firmly-entrenched tradition.\n\nPresident Trump is making the exact same kind of transformational impact with his use of Twitter, but rather than trying to emulate his successful approach, as FDR\u2019s critics did, some Democrats want social media companies to censor the President of the United States by shutting down his accounts. Senator Kamala Harris, a Democrat in desperate need of a boost for her flagging presidential candidacy, unequivocally stated during the most recent Democratic debate in Ohio that President Trump\u2019s Twitter account \u201cshould be taken down.\u201d\n\nThe senator\u2019s authoritarian position is a direct affront to our Constitution and the values this country was founded upon. Our founders enshrined the freedom of speech and expression as the First Amendment in our Bill of Rights in order to emphasize that all of our other freedoms depend on the right to speak one\u2019s mind. Sadly, the Democrats seem to hate this Republican president more than they love this Republic.\n\nIt\u2019s not just Trump supporters who should be worried. If the Democrats think it\u2019s acceptable to censor the social media accounts of the President of the United States, then why would they have any reservations about censoring you, too?\n\nIn 2020, we will have a choice between a Democratic Party that is willing to sacrifice our Constitutional freedoms for its own short-term political gain and a Republican Party led by the most transparent and patriotic president in history. One need look no further than the Trump rallies attended that consistently draw thousands upon thousands of supporters to see how effectively this president is engaging with voters by speaking to them directly through social media. President Trump is pioneering a 21st century version of FDR\u2019s fireside chats, bringing politics to the people in a way that has never been done before. His opponents don\u2019t think the American people should be allowed to listen.", "description": "Social media, and Twitter in particular, is President Trump\u2019s version .10/19/2019 20:07:33PM EST.", "authors": ["John Pence", "Beth Baumann", "Bronson Stocking"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/290/846d8cdc-0c91-4212-8ad1-f94c2a5ba8bb.png", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
