Abigail Spanberger (@RepSpanberger) September 24, 2019\n\nThe opinion piece comes amid a growing outcry over a July call between Trump and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky. The Wall Street Journal first reported last week that a whistleblower filed a complaint alleging Trump urged his counterpart to investigate former Vice President Biden and his son Hunter Biden, who served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company from 2014 until earlier this year. Media outlets have since reported that Trump instructed his administration to withhold nearly $400 million in military aid for Ukraine at least a week before the phone call took place.\n\nIf such a call took place, it would represent an unprecedented attempt to pressure a foreign power to investigate one of Trump\u2019s political rivals, but the White House has rejected those assertions and moved to turn the criticism back on the former vice president. Neither Biden has been accused of any legal wrongdoing.\n\nThe president has acknowledged that he spoke to Zelensky and that the Bidens came up in the call, but he has cast the discussion as \u201clargely congratulatory.\u201d He also said he instructed his aides to withhold the military aid because he was concerned about \u201ccorruption\u201d in Ukraine, not as a means to pressure the country\u2019s leader to investigate the Bidens.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?\u201d Trump told reporters Monday. He has also hinted that he may release a transcript of the call to quell any doubts about his motives.\n\nBut those assertions have roiled leading Democrats, who have demanded Congress be given access to the full whistleblower complaint so they can investigate any allegations of impropriety (the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, has so far refused to turn it over). House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) also hinted that impeachment could get some renewed attention after she has stonewalled requests from within her party for months.\n\nOn Monday, the seven freshman lawmakers said their responsibilities compelled them to \u201cpreserve the checks and balances envisioned by the Founders and restore the rest of the American people in our government.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis flagrant disregard for the law cannot stand,\u201d they wrote. \u201cTo uphold and defend our Constitution, Congress must determine whether the president was indeed willing to use his power and withhold security assistance funds to persuade a foreign country to assist him in an upcoming election.\u201d\n\nThey added: \u201cEverything we do harks back to our oaths to defend the country. These new allegations are a threat to all we have sworn to protect.\u201d", "description": "The seven lawmakers, who are military vets or had worked in national security and defense, wrote that the Ukraine report is \u201ca threat to all we have swor...", "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d89875124000056007b8787.jpeg?cache=istcx1braw&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
