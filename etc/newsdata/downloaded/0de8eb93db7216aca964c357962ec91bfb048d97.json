Then imagine that his wife, your mother, took you as a toddler to that very same tribe to continue your father's work. That's either insanity, a love that surpasses all understanding, or a faith that can move mountains. But that is in fact the early life of Valerie Elliot Shepard, the daughter of one of the most influential Christian women of the 20th Century, Elisabeth Elliot. Valerie has published a book of her parents' love letters called, 'Devotedly, The Personal Letters and Love Story of Jim and Elisabeth Elliot'.
