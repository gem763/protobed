(Photo: Jessica McGowan / Getty)\n\nThe names of more than 120 companies secretly served FBI subpoenas for their customers\u2019 personal data were revealed this week, including a slew of US banks, mobile phone providers and a leading antivirus software maker.\n\nKnown as national security letters (NSL), the subpoenas are a tool commonly used by FBI counterterrorism agents when seeking individuals\u2019 communication and financial histories. No judge oversees their use. Senior-most agents at any of the FBI\u2019s 56 nationwide field offices can issue the letters, which are typically accompanied by a gag order.\n\nThe letters allow the FBI to demand access to limited types of information, most of which may be described as \u201cmetadata\u201d \u2014 the names of email senders and recipients and the dates and times that messages were sent, for example. The actual content of messages is legally out of bounds.\n\nFinancial information such as credit card transactions and travellers check purchases can also be obtained, in addition to the billing records and history of any given phone number.\n\nBecause NSL recipients are often forced to keep the fact secret for many years there\u2019s been little transparency around who\u2019s getting served.\n\nBut this week, The New York Times published four documents with details on 750 NSLs issued as far back as 2016.\n\nThe paper described the documents \u2014 obtained by digital-rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) in a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit \u2014 as a \u201csmall but telling fraction\u201d of the more than 500,000 letters issued since 2001, when passage of the Patriot Act greatly expanded the number of FBI officials who could sign them.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2006, use of NSLs increased nearly six-fold, according to the US Justice Department inspector general.\n\nScreenshot: Jennifer Valentino-DeVries / The New York Times\n\nWhile it\u2019s widely known that tech companies such as Google and Facebook are routinely served NSLs, the documents \u2014 751 letters informing companies that their gag orders had been lifted \u2014 offer new insight into the scope of the businesses receiving them: Not only banks (big and small), but universities, money-transfer services, domain registrars and voice-over-internet (VoIP) providers.\n\nEven video game companies.\n\nValve, the video game developer, received an NSL in December 2016. A month earlier, Symantec, the antivirus software developer, received a letter. In addition to all the major phone carriers, phone companies such as TracFone and MetroPCS also received letters.\n\nA number of cloud service providers, including Rackspace, are identified by the documents, as well as smaller social apps such as Tango and MeetMe.\n\nAfter passage of the USA Freedom Act in 2015, the FBI adopted guidelines that require gag orders to be reviewed for necessity three years after issuance or after an investigation is closed. Yet, privacy advocates accuse the FBI of failing to follow its own rules.\n\n\u201cThe documents released by the FBI show that a wide range of services and providers receive NSLs and that the majority of them never tell their customers or the broader public, even after the government releases them from NSL gag orders,\u201d said Aaron Mackey, a staff attorney at the EFF.\n\n\u201cThe records also show that the FBI is falling short of its obligations to release NSL recipients from gag orders that are no longer necessary.\u201d\n\nThe FBI declined to comment.\n\nThe secrecy \u2014 not to mention the weak evidentiary standards \u2014 has kept NSLs squarely in cross hairs of civil liberties groups for years. But the FBI also carries a history of abuse, having in the past issued numerous letters \u201cwithout proper authorization,\u201d to quote the bureau\u2019s own inspector general in 2009.\n\nThe same official would also describe to US Congress a bevy of violations including \u201cimproper requests\u201d and \u201cunauthorised collections\u201d of data that can\u2019t be legally obtained with an NSL. In some cases, the justifications used by agents to obtain letters were found to be \u201cperfunctory and conclusory\u201d, or convenient and inherently flawed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unconstitutional for the FBI to impose indefinite gags on the companies that receive NSLs,\u201d said Neema Singh Guliani, senior legislative counsel with the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cThis is one of the reasons that Congress previously sought to put an end to this practice, but it is now clear that the FBI is not following the law as intended.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs part of its surveillance reform efforts this year, Congress must strengthen existing laws designed to bar these types of gag orders,\u201d she added.\n\nThe NSL records obtained by the EFF can be viewed here.", "description": "The names of more than 120 companies secretly served FBI subpoenas for their customers\u2019 personal data were revealed this week, including a slew of US banks, mobile phone providers and a leading antivirus software maker....", "authors": ["Ryan F.
