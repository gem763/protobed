Ireland long ago admitted experimenting in this year\u2019s Six Nations in a bid to peak at the World Cup, but Best has now conceded that strategy backfired.\n\nAlmighty All Blacks lay waste to the side that inspired their rebuild | Liam Napier Read more\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of pressure on them [New Zealand] and I think we allowed them to get a good start which took a little bit of the pressure off,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone talks about the pressure that\u2019s on the All Blacks before quarter-finals but when you haven\u2019t won one and you feel you have a great coaching set-up and great group of players then maybe you put too much pressure on.\n\n\u201cMaybe we have been looking at this for too long and been so focused on it that we forgot to win some of the little battles along the way over the last 12 months. We wanted to set a bar that no Irish team has met before. We\u2019ve done that numerous times over the six and half years with Joe [Schmidt]. It was an onus on us to win a quarter-final because then it becomes a habit. We talked about it years ago. I remember Paul O\u2019Connell saying when we beat France three times in a row leading into the last World Cup that it then becomes a habit because you expect to beat France.\n\n\u201cWith Joe, he helped take away a bit of the fear factor that the All Blacks held in the last three Tests. But when you do that they see you coming a lot more and when you get the best team in the world fully prepared and fully focused on you it becomes that little bit more difficult.\n\n\u201cAnd when you make a few errors and you let them get their tails up it becomes even more difficult.\u201d\n\nIreland claimed a penalty try and a score for Robbie Henshaw but that proved scant consolation as the All Blacks ran riot at Tokyo Stadium to book a semi-final meeting with England.\n\nNew Zealand thrash Ireland to set up World Cup semi-final with England Read more\n\nSchmidt has now taken charge of Ireland for the final time, with defence specialist Andy Farrell due to step into the head coaching role. Schmidt had led Ireland to three Six Nations titles, including one Grand Slam, and the nation\u2019s first two victories over New Zealand.\n\nBut Schmidt was simply not able to steer Ireland to World Cup history, and Best admitted that will hurt for some time to come. Asked to sum up his feelings in defeat, Best said: \u201cTired, sore, upset. Right now you focus on just what\u2019s gone and we\u2019re incredibly disappointed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of big characters in that changing room and it\u2019s not often that you get deadly silence,\u201d Best said. \u201cThere were some of those big men in tears. That\u2019s what happens when everybody puts their heart and soul into something.\u201d", "description": "Ireland\u2019s Rory Best suggested an excessive focus on their poor World Cup quarter-final record may have cost them against the All Blacks", "authors": ["Pa Media"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/badea7a760b236781d0c00bbe84a058b632c50a9/0_143_3654_2193/master/3654.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5c4ea1d03b2926631692a7c7c5f99d12", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
