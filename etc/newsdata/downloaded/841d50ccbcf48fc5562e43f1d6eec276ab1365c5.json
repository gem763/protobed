(AP) - A public arts project in New England communities features signs that imagine the possible future effects of climate change to raise awareness about the issue.\n\nThe \u201cRemembrance of Climate Futures\u201d project has been installed in Durham, New Hampshire, and Essex, Massachusetts. It will also come to Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nThe signs are based on possibilities laid out in the scientific research that the towns have used to develop their climate plans and written from the perspective of someone in the 22nd century looking back.\n\nInspired by historical markers, the signs detail events like rising sea levels and an explosion of ticks that have yet to happen.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A public arts project in New England communities features signs that imagine the possible future effects of climate change to raise awareness about the issue.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Michael Casey"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/19/climate_change_warning_signs_91104_c0-156-3741-2338_s1200x700.jpg?0e2076cb998de582bcb050b19f7848b6152b87cd", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
