After the completion of the Kurdish withdrawal, Turkey\u2019s military operation, which began Oct. 9, would be \u201chalted entirely,\u201d Pence said.\n\nThe SDF, which partnered with the United States in the fight against the Islamic State, said the agreement was \u201cjust the beginning,\u201d Mazloum Kobane Abdi, the group\u2019s commander, said in an interview on Kurdish television.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe accepted this agreement, and will do whatever it takes to make it work,\u201d he said, but stressed that \u201cthe Turkish occupation will not continue\u201d.\n\nAD\n\nPresident Trump hailed the agreement as a victory for all parties involved. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it was going to work out this quickly, I didn\u2019t know it was going to work out this well,\u201d he told reporters Thursday in Texas. Others said the agreement had rewarded Turkey\u2019s military offensive and contained no assurance that Erdogan\u2019s government would withdraw from Syria.\n\n\u201cThe Turkish army has seized a great deal of territory in a very short period of time,\u201d James M. Jeffrey, the State Department\u2019s Syria envoy, told reporters on Thursday. \u201cWe had no doubt whatsoever that they would not continue seizing territory if we couldn\u2019t get a cease-fire.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that the YPG wishes that they could stay in these areas,\u201d he added, referring to the Syrian Kurdish militias.\n\n\u201cIt is our assessment that they had no military ability to hold onto these areas, and therefore, we thought the cease-fire would be much better.\u201d He added that Washington would work with Ankara on addressing humanitarian needs in the zone.\n\nAD\n\nOn Friday, the National Army, a Turkish-backed umbrella group that united Syrian rebel factions ahead of the offensive, denied that there was any fighting or shelling in Ras al-Ayn, despite witness accounts to the contrary.\n\nA civilian near Ras al-Ayn said the bombardment had continued through the night and this morning. \u201cThere have been no airstrikes so far, but neither the bombardment nor the clashes have ceased,\u201d Danial, whose name has been changed for security reasons, said in a phone interview. \u201cWe are among the few dozens of families that have stayed in the area; but we have our car ready and we may still leave, despite the cease-fire.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHe said the bulk of town had already emptied. \u201cI don\u2019t think they are going to come back.\u201d\n\nHe added that Turkey\u2019s goal is clear: to empty the area from its inhabitants and then replace them with refugees originally from other parts of Syria.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe cannot trust any deal that doesn\u2019t make the so-called National Army leave the area. How are we supposed to live with those who conspired against us and stabbed us in the back?\u201d\n\nKareem Fahim in Istanbul contributed to this article.\n\nAD", "description": "Witnesses report shelling and gunfire, though Trump has hailed U.S.-brokered cease-fire deal as a victory for all parties.", "authors": ["Sarah Dadouch", "Correspondent Covering The Middle East", "Asser Khattab"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/3R5-qlyg1JnvfpeGAmi_HxeA-tw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DGGTO4XRRQI6TBUT6SD6IZ4EVI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
