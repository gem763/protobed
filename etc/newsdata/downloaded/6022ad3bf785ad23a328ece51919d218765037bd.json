The expressive intensity of the postures holds you transfixed, and the thread of energy between the raised paws seems to hold the protagonists in perfect balance.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nNatural History Museum director Sir Michael Dixon said: \u201dThis compelling picture captures nature\u2019s ultimate challenge \u2013 its battle for survival. The area in which this was taken, often referred to as the \u2018third pole\u2019, because of the enormous water reserves held by its ice fields, is under threat from dramatic temperature rises like those seen in the Arctic. At a time when precious habitats are facing increasing climate pressures, seeing these fleeting yet fascinating moments reminds us of what we need to protect.\u201d\n\nCruz Erdmann, 14, took the award for Young Wildlife Photographer of the Year 2019 with his serene portrait of an iridescent big fin reef squid during a night dive in Indonesia. After inheriting his father\u2019s old underwater camera, Cruz found the perfect medium to express his passion for all things aquatic.\n\nTheo Bosboom, nature photographer and member of the judging panel for WPY55, said: \u201cTo dive in the pitch dark, find this beautiful squid and to be able to photograph it so elegantly, to reveal its wonderful shapes and colours, takes so much skill. What a resounding achievement for such a young photographer.\u201d\n\nBoth images will feature in a lightbox display, alongside 98 others in an exhibition at the Natural History Museum from 18 October.\n\nWildlife Photographer of the Year is developed and produced by the Natural History Museum, London", "description": "An extraordinary image of a standoff between a Tibetan fox and a marmot snapped up the top award at this year\u2019s\u00a0Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition.
