But he also suggested the ERG could not support it if Johnson failed to secure the backing of the DUP.\n\nPeston (@itvpeston) \u201cIf the DUP are happy, it\u2019s not for us to gainsay\u201d @SteveBakerHW confirms that the ERG will take their lead from the DUP on Northern Ireland. #Peston pic.twitter.com/RpQri2fY24\n\nThe DUP statement added: \u201cWe will continue to work with the government to try and get a sensible deal that works for Northern Ireland and protects the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom.\u201d\n\nJohnson has met Foster and Dodds three times in the last three days as he tried to shore up their support before Saturday\u2019s deadline to prevent a delay to Brexit.\n\nThe housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, said on BBC Breakfast: \u201cWe know there are clearly concerns on the part of the DUP and we want to try and work through these productively in the hours to come.\n\n\u201cAll sides in this do want to secure an orderly exit from the EU, and I think one is in sight, although there is clearly very significant issues to be hammered out. Let\u2019s wait and see.\u201d\n\nHe said he expected Johnson to go to Brussels to meet with members of the European council.\n\nUnder the so-called Benn act, if Johnson cannot get a deal passed by Saturday he will be forced to seek an extension to the 31 October deadline for the UK to leave the European Union.\n\nThe DUP is digging in over the prospect of a customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, as well as the issues of consent regarding the suspended Stormont assembly.\n\nAnother significant issue is whether EU VAT rates would apply in Northern Ireland.\n\n\n\nAmid fears that there is not enough time for a legal text to be hammered out, a compromise could prompt EU leaders to back a political agreement and schedule a second summit.\n\nJohnson told the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers a day before the summit that his situation was like climbing Mount Everest, according to MPs in attendance.\n\nMark Francois, a prominent Brexiter, said: \u201cHe said, \u2018We are not quite at the summit, we are at the Hillary Step.\u2019 The Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, has confirmed that the PM will write a letter asking for an article 50 extension if no deal is in place by Saturday.\n\nThis is despite Johnson repeatedly ruling out asking for a further delay under his \u201cdo or die\u201d commitment to leave the EU by the current Halloween deadline.", "description": "PM\u2019s proposed deal suffers another blow after party objects to customs and VAT terms", "authors": ["Matthew Weaver"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f5f5544599078b13c426649b4ebeb467bc10556/0_188_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e354ef0d5cdabe890ee32aa48e4092e5", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
