The thought of it horrifies me,\u201d said Jonathan Gledhill, the landlord of the Red Pump Inn, a village dining pub in this quiet part of mid-Lancashire.\n\nJust north of the former mill towns of south Lancashire, this green and pleasant part of the north-west \u2013 which includes the vast and unspoilt Forest of Bowland \u2013 is officially the happiest place in the UK, according to the Office for National Statistics. On a scale of 0 to 10, Ribble Valley residents scored an average of 8.30 when asked by government surveyors about how happy they felt. This compared with an average of 7.56 for the country at large.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not surprising. People here derive a great pleasure from living their lives, as opposed to gathering material possessions. They might have bit of money and a nice house, but they\u2019re not on a city centre treadmill,\u201d said Gledhill, who moved to the tiny parish of Bashall Eaves five years ago with his wife, Fran, to run the Red Pump.\n\nThe quiet lanes of the Ribble Valley \u2013 with the old market town of Clitheroe at its heart - may seem far from city stresses, but here a rural life for city workers is within easy reach. Manchester is only a short train ride away, while the west coast mainline and motorway networks snake around the Trough of Bowland to bring in piles of visitors, supporting an economy shifting away from agriculture to tourism.\n\nOnce best known for its small Norman castle and countryside surrounds, Clitheroe and the Ribble Valley has developed a reputation as a gastronomic hotspot in recent years, with a cluster of award-winning inns. It attracts clientele from across the north and further afield, and won welcome exposure when Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon visited the Inn at Whitewell for their TV series The Trip.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t realise how accessible it is,\u201d said Steven Smith, the chef-proprietor of the award-winning Freemasons at Wiswell, who frequently visits London on business via a two-hour train ride from Preston.\n\n\u201cMy customers work in Manchester, London and so forth. Here you can get that little step out and that \u2018breathe\u2019 factor. Its beautiful, but not a million miles from anywhere,\u201d he said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Chef proprietor Steven Smith of the Freemasons at Wiswell.

Smith said executives from firms across the north-west called the area home \u2013 including those from BAE Systems, one of the biggest employers in the county, with several factories near Preston.\n\nEarnings are above average, and people are more likely to be homeowners. Ribble Valley has among the top rates of owner occupation in Lancashire, ranking well ahead of towns such as Blackburn, Burnley and Preston.\n\nYoung people, however, can find it hard to get on the housing ladder, while cuts to the public bus services have made life harder for those without transport. Residents number about 60,000, and are widely dispersed and rapidly ageing. About a quarter of the population are over 65, above the national average of about 18%, in an area popular with retirees from across the country.\n\nBut Rachel McQueen, chief executive of Marketing Lancashire, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a place where families enjoy a great work-life balance, an active outdoor life in commutable distance to work, good schools and some of the country\u2019s finest universities, so we\u2019re not surprised that residents of Lancashire\u2019s Ribble Valley are amongst the happiest in the UK.\u201d\n\nAgainst a backdrop of immense political stress and uncertainty, Britain as a whole has got steadily happier in the six years since the government\u2019s statisticians began to assess the wellbeing of the nation, but the north-west has recorded the largest improvement.\n\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\nThe surveys show that money and power aren\u2019t everything. London boroughs, such as Islington and Camden, are on paper among the most prosperous places in the country, with wages well above average. But their residents are consistently less happy than the national average.\n\nAllan Knox, leader of the Liberal Democrat opposition on the Tory-controlled Ribble Valley borough council, said: \u201cWe are a fairly prosperous borough, there\u2019s no doubt about that. That prosperity can bring the ability to ride out some of the economic challenges that might be a bit more detrimental to other areas.\u201d\n\nBut he said he would have given a gloomier answer than most of his neighbours if the ONS surveyors had questioned him yesterday. He waited in for post that never came, says rain falls more frequently on the west of the Pennines, and his dog hasn\u2019t been well.\n\nStill, the area is a \u201chidden gem\u201d, Knox said.\n\nThe happy top five \u2026\n\nRibble Valley: 8.30\n\nOrkney Islands: 8.29\n\nChichester: 8.29\n\nHambleton: 8.19\n\nFylde: 8.18\n\n\u2026 and the bottom five\n\nNorwich: 7.15\n\nWorcester: 7.14\n\nLincoln: 7.09\n\nSouth Ribble: 7.02\n\nSurrey Heath: 6.71", "description": "Residents and business owners of rural north-west district unsurprised by ONS findings", "authors": ["Richard Partington"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d41b0ce24b7aa81654f2e48040e5ab49d7635bee/0_164_3686_2212/master/3686.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3115e9c96062aff7351d5bd280ba9cb7", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
