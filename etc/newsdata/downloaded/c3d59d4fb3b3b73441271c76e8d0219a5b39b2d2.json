Trouble is the car dealers get really mad.\n\nDiplomatically you say to them, \u201cLook, you know I love coming to you guys. You are close by and I really don\u2019t want to have to travel all over to find new deals, but I\u2019ve got to keep the family happy, too. Can you help me out?\u201d\n\nThey say, \u201cOK, but if you wanna break your current plan and still keep your discounts, it\u2019s gonna cost something \u2014 I mean, we don\u2019t wanna be giving ideas to our other customers, right?\u201d\n\nSo you say, \u201cOK, OK, I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s just kids these days. How much is it going to cost?\u201d\n\nThey look you straight in the eyes and say, \u201c$48 billion.\u201d\n\nYou say, \u201cWow, and what do I get for that?\u201d\n\nThey say, \u201cWe\u2019ll let you know that once you\u2019ve signed on the line.\u201d\n\nSo you say, \u201cGreat! I\u2019ll go tell the kids.\u201d\n\nAbsurd? Well that, roughly, is how Theresa May\u2019s Brexit negotiations with the EU went. Nigel Farage dubbed her withdrawal agreement a \u201csurrender document.\u201d\n\nJapan recently signed a huge free trade agreement with the EU, but free was not available for Britain. The U.K. needed to be made an example of.\n\nThe EU\u2019s Brexit bruiser, Guy Verhofstadt, has threatened, \u201cIf the U.K. doesn\u2019t pay what is due, the EU will not negotiate a trade deal.\u201d He added, \u201cAfter \u2018no deal,\u2019 this will be a first condition of any talks.\u201d\n\nThe U.K. is already estimated to have paid the EU/EEC half a trillion pounds sterling since it joined in 1973, but that has bought precious little good will from its European neighbors.\n\nProponents of paying for a deal point to the benefits. The U.K.\u2019s Department for International Trade has said the EU-Japan trade deal alone would increase U.K. GDP by up to $3.7 billion \u201cin the longer term.\u201d\n\nThat means Britain pays $48 billion to get $3.7 billion back \u2014 go figure that one.\n\nNow it is Mr. Johnson\u2019s turn to deal with the EU, and President Trump feels he is doing very well. At the G7 summit in France, he told reporters, \u201cHe needs no advice. He\u2019s the right man for the job.\u201d\n\nBut Nigel Farage is not convinced, \u201cI think Boris Johnson is going all out for an amended withdrawal agreement.\u201d Mr. Farage has made it clear his Brexit Party will only support him if he is willing to leave the EU without a deal.\n\nMr. Farage\u2019s worry is that the only change Mr. Johnson wants to make to Mrs. May\u2019s deal is to drop the \u201cIrish Backstop.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cBackstop\u201d was agreed by Mrs. May to try to solve the problem of the EU needing custom checks at the end of its trading zone. After Brexit this would lie between Northern and Southern Ireland and it could have led to a hard border being reinstated between them.\n\nMany Conservatives argued that new technology for tracking lorries and goods makes border checks unnecessary, but Mrs. May buckled under the EU threats to build one.\n\nShe was terrified of \u201cthe troubles\u201d flaring up again. Added to that Nancy Pelosi threatened to block any U.S. trade deals with Britain if Brexit endangered the \u201cGood Friday Agreement\u201d that has brought peace to Northern Ireland.\n\nThe House speaker should have known that the EU was threatening the hard border, not Britain, but why let facts get in the way of spoiling a Trump trade deal?\n\nMrs. May\u2019s compromise was to have checks on goods coming in by sea to the British mainland, but this would have separated Northern Ireland from the rest of the U.K. and effectively kept it in the EU, possibly leading to a furious backlash from Unionists.\n\nFurthermore, had Parliament agreed to Mrs. May\u2019s \u201cvassal state\u201d withdrawal agreement then Britain could have been tied to the EU\u2019s custom\u2019s union and may not have been able to sign a trade deal with America \u2014 or anyone else.\n\nBoris Johnson wants to get rid of the \u201cIrish Backstop\u201d and to reduce their $48 billion demand. Yet, finding such a deal before the Oct. 31 leave date seems increasingly unlikely, so \u201cRemainers\u201d are demanding the date is delayed yet again.\n\nParliament returned this week with old scores to settle. The prime minister\u2019s Conservative Party \u2014 which includes his brother, Parliament member Jo Johnson \u2014 faced the combined onslaught of angry \u201cRemainer\u201d MPs who want him removed.\n\nIf the \u201cRemain\u201d gang succeeds, it could lead to \u201cVote-fight at the O.K. Parliament\u201d for the Johnson brothers in an electoral showdown over Brexit. Will Nigel Farage become an unlikely Doc Holliday?\n\nMaybe, but first they would have to tell the EU dealership, \u201cno-deal.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Andrew Davies is a U.K.-based video producer and scriptwriter.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
