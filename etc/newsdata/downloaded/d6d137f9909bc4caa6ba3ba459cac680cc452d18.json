For President Trump it also produced something else: an almost intoxicating sense of impunity, a realization that his attempts to cultivate Russia as an ally, and largely successful efforts to gain control of the Justice Department, gave him carte blanche to plan his next crime. In June, he announced on television that he would accept dirt on his opponent from a foreign government if offered it again. He dispatched his lawyer to Ukraine to deliver the message that he demanded an investigation of his leading Democratic rival, and that he would use the powers of his office to leverage this end.\n\nIt is primarily because Trump is indicating that his war on democratic norms will not end that Congress is barreling toward impeachment right now at astonishing speed. On Monday morning, the headline on Politico\u2019s story on House Democrats began, \u201cReluctant Democrats Weigh Impeachment.\u201d By evening, as more reporting poured in, it had changed to \u201cDems Moving to Condemn Trump as Impeachment Fever Grows.\u201d\n\nThe most important impediment to impeaching Trump has always been the reluctance of the most vulnerable House Democrats to take a vote that they feared would alienate their constituents. But all the signs are now pointing toward those Democrats\u2019 throwing aside their reluctance. Seven newly elected freshmen Democrats from vulnerable districts have published an op-ed in the Washington Post demanding Trump hand over the suppressed complaint from an intelligence whistle-blower regarding Trump\u2019s pressure on Ukraine. \u201cIf these allegations are true,\u201d they write, \u201cwe believe these actions represent an impeachable offense.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi has urged restraint out of a desire to insulate those vulnerable members, whom she needs to preserve her majority. Pelosi\u2019s behavior, too, has shifted notably. Her close ally Rosa DeLauro issued a statement demanding the entire whistle-blower\u2019s complaint and opening the door to impeachment. The Post reports Pelosi is sounding out members on impeachment, and \u201cmany leadership aides who once thought Trump\u2019s impeachment was unlikely now say they think it\u2019s almost inevitable.\u201d\n\nIt is possible Trump could defuse impeachment by releasing his block on the whistle-blower complaint. But surrendering his claims of secrecy and almost unbounded executive privilege run counter to his instinct for domination. It could also quite likely supply evidence incriminating enough to lead to his impeachment anyway. That Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate Biden and held up military aid to leverage this demand is a certainty. The main possibilities for surprise are that the complaint will include even more unseemly behavior.\n\nThe politics of this maneuver are highly uncertain. Whatever their motive, Democrats are not seeking political advantage, and there is a distinct possibility that proceedings will backfire on them. Despite Trump\u2019s unpopularity, strong majorities have opposed impeachment throughout his term.\n\nBut there is at least some reason to believe the politics of the Ukraine scandal will play out differently than the politics of the Russia scandal. The Republican phalanx of support has failed to materialize in its usual strength. Normally passive Mitt Romney issued a surprisingly sharp rebuke, demanding Trump \u201cshould make available the whistleblower complaint that has been deemed to be credible and urgent,\u201d and that if not, \u201cit will be up to the House to decide how to proceed.\u201d\n\nOther signs of discomfort in the party are more subtle. The normal mouthpieces of the party line, while tonally in support, are refusing to outright defend his actions in Ukraine. \u201cIf POTUS called on a foreign nation to investigate Biden, it was inappropriate,\u201d writes Ari Fleischer. The Wall Street Journal editorial page scolds, \u201cWhat we know of the call underscores Mr. Trump\u2019s greatest flaw as President, which is his political narcissism. Every decision boils down to how it affects him or his re-election prospects. Other Presidents have made similar calculations, but Mr. Trump lacks the basic filter to know when he is crossing a line that creates trouble for himself or the country.\u201d Both Fleischer and the Journal then quickly pivot to the allegedly greater sins of the Democratic Party, but their reliance on whataboutism and inability to muster any plausible defense of the president\u2019s actions ought to alarm him.\n\nEven more tellingly, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell declined to defend Trump\u2019s coercion of Ukraine, or even to repeat his attacks on Biden, but instead made a tepid complaint that Democrats \u201chave chosen to politicize the issue.\u201d It is probably relevant that Trump was defying the wishes of Republicans themselves by refusing to allow the military aid to Ukraine that Congress had passed to go through. Trump personally ordered the aid to be held up, the Washington Post reports. McConnell may or may not care that Trump is abusing his power to smear Biden, but he surely cares that Trump is abrogating laws passed by McConnell.\n\nThe House will probably vote soon to make clear its intention to impeach Trump unless he hands over the full whistle-blower complaint. Perhaps he will do so, and perhaps it will not incriminate him. What seems more likely now is a prospect that had appeared remote just days ago: The House of Representatives will hold impeachment proceedings for President Donald Trump.", "description": "The House of Representatives appears likely to begin impeachment proceedings against President Trump.
