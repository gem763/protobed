The burger has a clever name: the P.L.T. (plant, lettuce and tomato).\n\nSpokespeople for McDonald\u2019s and Beyond Meat didn\u2019t immediately return Yahoo Finance\u2019s request for comment.\n\nBeyond Meat shares exploded 13% in pre-market trading on Thursday. McDonald\u2019s rose slightly.\n\nInvestors have long expected a tie-up for the two companies, which could bring a good bit of sales to both outfits.\n\nRemember, Beyond Meat counts former McDonald\u2019s CEO Don Thompson as a board member. Meanwhile, consumer interest in plant-based foods continues to surge \u2014 so it\u2019s bizarre it has taken McDonald\u2019s so long to launch a test with Beyond Meat.\n\nWall Street is cautious\n\nNow Wall Street could speculate even more about a larger tie-up between the two companies. A deal would likely be bigger news for the upstart Beyond Meat, even though some on Wall Street advise caution on that line of thinking.\n\n(Photo Illustration by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) More\n\n\u201cI would just call out two caveats to the bullish view. One if it\u2019s a straight supply agreement, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s advantageous to Beyond Meat long-term \u2014 that creates volatility in their customer base because it probably implies that McDonald\u2019s down the road might be more inclined to make their purchasing decisions on economics than brand affinity,\u201d said D.A. Davidson food analyst Brian Holland.\n\nHolland, who initiated coverage on Beyond Meat\u2019s stock with a Sell rating several weeks ago due to concerns on the adoption of plant-based food by consumers, added \u201cNestle makes a vegan sandwich for McDonald\u2019s in Germany and Israel as well. They are bringing a plant-based burger to the U.S. this fall. I just think there are other solutions out there.\u201d\n\nBut for today, it\u2019s all about the Beyond Meat solution coming to 28 McDonald\u2019s locations.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "McDonald's and Beyond Meat finally join forces.", "authors": ["Brian Sozzi"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/jscg8zTlTjVDKUGqWcWTGw--~B/aD0xMTI1O3c9MTUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/9c7f2540-e04e-11e9-9fff-8ff481651f7e", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
