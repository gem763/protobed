At a private event with American diplomatic officials in New York, Trump lashed out at the whistle-blower, saying, \u201cHe or she or whoever the hell they saw\u2014they\u2019re almost a spy.\u201d\n\nFor as long as the whistle-blower\u2019s gender remained unknown, the singular they was the most convenient pronoun to use\u2014not just for Schiff and Trump, but also for news outlets reporting on the story. \u201cWhistleblower Tentatively Agrees to Testify, Attorneys Say, as Long as They Get Appropriate Clearances to Attend Hearing,\u201d read one CNN headline; the article made clear that it was the whistle-blower, not the attorneys, who needed the clearances.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, however, The New York Times published the news that the whistle-blower was a man, and further identified him as a CIA officer previously detailed to work at the White House. (After which the Times national-security editor, Amy Fiscus, tweeted, \u201cAnd yes, it\u2019s a he.\u201d) The Wall Street Journal soon followed up with its own reporting identifying the whistle-blower as a man.\n\nDespite these reports, not everyone was eager to identify the whistle-blower as \u201che.\u201d When Schiff appeared on MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow Show on Thursday night, he criticized Republicans who argued that \u201cthis whistle-blower wasn\u2019t even listening to the call himself or herself, so they\u2019re not credible,\u201d adding, \u201cWell, actually, their allegations are more credible because their sources are so good.\u201d\n\nIn an ever shifting political story centering on a person whose exact identity has remained concealed (at least for now), the singular they has proved to be the best option for a pronoun that avoids gender reference. While the more cumbersome he or she has occasionally crept in, the widespread use of they in the whistle-blower saga goes to show just how accepted\u2014and how necessary\u2014the singular form of that pronoun has become, despite complaints from naysayers that it is somehow ungrammatical.\n\nConstruing they as singular is nothing new, though it has been making fresh inroads lately. When there is a generic antecedent such as everyone, not referring to a specific person (as in \u201cEveryone can choose the pronoun they want\u201d), the use of they has been commonplace for centuries, found in the writing of Chaucer, Shakespeare, Jane Austen, and countless others. But even when a particular individual is picked out by the pronoun, the singular they has shown itself to be extremely useful. If the singular they came to be more widely embraced as an acceptable grammatical choice, then there would be no need for any verbal gymnastics in cases like the whistle-blower\u2019s, where a person\u2019s gender may be at least temporarily unclear.", "description": "The national intelligence director\u2019s recent testimony inadvertently supported the argument against grammar purists.", "authors": ["Ben Zimmer"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/AP_19269504692115/facebook.jpg?1569602067", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
