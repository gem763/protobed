Known as Santa Anas in the southern part of the state and Diablos in the north, they arrive regularly in the fall.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been here since before we\u2019ve been here,\u201d said Janin Guzman-Morales, a postdoctoral researcher at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego. \u201cIt\u2019s a natural process in this region.\u201d\n\nBut the winds\u2019 future in a changing climate is less certain. Recent research by Dr. Guzman-Morales and others suggests that as the climate warms, the winds may become less frequent, especially at the fringes of their season in fall and spring.", "description": "Recent research suggests that as the climate warms, Santa Ana winds may become less frequent. Coupled with precipitation changes, that could mean more intense fires later in the year.", "authors": ["Henry Fountain"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/28/climate/28CLI-WINDS1/28CLI-WINDS1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
