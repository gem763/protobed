Today he\u2019s a billionaire, thanks in no small part to Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: )., which enlisted his firm in 2017 to manage same-day delivery service in the country.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep,\u201d Wasami said in an interview, recalling the night he came up with the idea for his business.\n\nEarlier that day, he said, he accompanied a friend who was picking up packages from a yarn factory and bristled at the incompetence of some of the workers handling the parcels. Within just a few months, he began delivering produce with his truck.\n\nWasami, 74, has a keen eye for \u201cwinning opportunities,\u201d said Kenji Kanai, an analyst at Tokai Tokyo Research Institute Co., referring to the timing of the deal with Amazon (NASDAQ: ).\n\nHis partnership with the world\u2019s biggest online retailer helped turbocharge shares of Maruwa, which have more than doubled this year. Wasami owns almost 60% of the company directly and through his closely held asset-management firm, giving him a net worth of $1 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nRevenue should continue to grow in the medium- to long-term as Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Tokyo-based Rakuten Inc. look to work more closely with couriers like Maruwa for same-day delivery over more established logistics firms, Kanai said.\n\nThe rise of Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and other e-commerce behemoths has created fabulous wealth in the past few decades. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is the world\u2019s richest person, with a $107.7 billion fortune, and his ex-wife, MacKenzie Bezos, owns a 4% stake worth $34.6 billion. Alibaba (NYSE: ) Group Holding Ltd.\u2019s Jack Ma, who stepped down as chairman last month, is China\u2019s richest person, while two co-founders of Flipkart Group became billionaires last year, when Walmart (NYSE: ) Inc. took a controlling stake in the Indian e-commerce company.\n\nMaruwa saw an opening as Yamato Holdings Co., one of Japan\u2019s biggest parcel carriers, withdrew from providing same-day delivery for Amazon (NASDAQ: ) to ease the burden on its workforce. That prompted Amazon to turn to other private couriers as it pushed to expand in the world\u2019s fourth-largest e-commerce market, which still has plenty of room for growth.\n\nE-commerce accounted for just 6.2% of the country\u2019s retail transactions last year, compared with 18% for China, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Underscoring that potential is Blackstone (NYSE: ) Group Inc.\u2019s plan to spend more than 100 billion yen ($927 million) to acquire distribution centers in Japan, reported in July.\n\nBloomberg Intelligence: Yahoo (NASDAQ: ) Japan\u2019s e-commerce ambition may be costly\n\n\u201cWe had suggested Amazon (NASDAQ: ) to do their same-day delivery service with us for years,\u201d Wasami said in the interview at Maruwa\u2019s office in Tokyo. \u201cWe convinced Amazon that it could count on Maruwa to handle the job.\u201d\n\nWhile increased demand for delivery will be a boon for companies like Maruwa, it also comes with higher costs and can take a toll on personnel. In 2017, Yamato raised delivery rates for the first time in almost three decades amid a labor shortage and surging shipping volumes from e-commerce retailers. It proposed another price hike last month ahead of a recent increase in Japan\u2019s consumption tax.\n\nMaruwa, which hasn\u2019t negotiated a price increase with Amazon (NASDAQ: ), rejects demand that exceeds its capacity, Wasami said. The company also promises competitive salaries for its drivers, he said. They can earn 7.2 million yen a year by delivering more than 150 packages a day, according to a regulatory filing.\n\nMaruwa\u2019s revenue climbed 15% to 85.6 billion yen for the fiscal year ended March 31. While logistics for food retailers remains its biggest business, e-commerce delivery now accounts for more than a third of its revenue, up from 24% in 2017, the company said in the filing.\n\nDespite his success and fabulous wealth, Wasami isn\u2019t close to being satisfied, saying sales should be several times bigger considering he\u2019s spent almost a half century building his business.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t done my best,\u201d he said.", "description": "Ex-Truck Driver Becomes a Billionaire With Some Help From Amazon", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic422617909369dc90e14655f396e4feb7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
