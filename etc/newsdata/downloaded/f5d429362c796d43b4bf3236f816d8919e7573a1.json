I think for me, It would be amazing and I would love the European Union to push every member states to make it a priority when it comes to their budgeting of tackling the climate crisis,\" he said.\n\nMagid knows he's not like most politicians, but wants to represent what his community is really like.\n\n\"It is not that I like being different, I am different...everyone is different in their own rights. And it's important for people to see themselves in politicians, in their leaders. Well, look at my role when I was mayor of Sheffield, I was exactly the same, I have not changed, the environment has changed,\" Magid said.\n\nDitching the suits for statement t-shirts, caps and Doc Martens, he\u2019s far from traditional.\n\nAnd other news in brief...\n\nTogether EU Council President Donald Tusk and EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker were at the helm of the European Union for five years.\n\nNow, as the end of their respective terms is approaching, both are facing different retirement prospects.\n\nAt 62, Tusk might stay in European politics after all.\n\nHis Polish home party officially nominated him to succeed Joseph Daul as president of the European People's Party (EPP), Europe's dominant center-right political family.\n\nTusk reportedly has the backing of many Christian Democratic leaders including Daul.\n\nTusk will decide in November.\n\nIn contrast, Juncker, who will turn 65 in December, will retire from public life and has said he wants to write a book.\n\nHis farewell address before the European Parliament this Tuesday will likely be his last high-profile speech.", "description": "Meet the Somali-British MEP who is defying political stereotypes.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/24/80/24/1000x563_cmsv2_c9f37923-2b8c-555d-afaa-77452c8386b0-4248024.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
