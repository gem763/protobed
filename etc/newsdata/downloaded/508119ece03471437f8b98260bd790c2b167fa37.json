It\u2019s amazing and it\u2019s everything I wanted it to be.\u2019\n\nVan Gerwen fell at the first hurdle at the European Championship (Picture: Kais Bodensieck/PDC Europe)\n\nWhile Cross admitted that Van Gerwen\u2019s early exit in Germany was helpful to his cause, he remained certain that he will dethrone the Dutchman at some stage.\n\n\u2018I always want number one,\u2019 continued Cross to Live Darts. \u2018I wouldn\u2019t be here making the numbers up and letting him have it his own way.\n\n\u2018He is the best player in the world at the minute, I know he crashed out and gave me an easier draw, that\u2019s no disrespect to anyone else.\n\n\u2018I think, realistically, I want to be number one, it doesn\u2019t matter if I become number one in three months time or in a year\u2019s time.\n\n\u2018We all have our aims and I will be number one.\u2019\n\nCross still has a long way to go to catch Van Gerwen at the top of the rankings, as following the European Championship MVG is on \u00a31,560,750 with Cross at \u00a3998,750.\n\nThere is also serious pressure on Voltage at the World Championship, starting on 13 December, as he is defending the \u00a3400,000 he picked up for winning the tournament in 2018.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only way Cross can increase the money on his ranking is by lifting the trophy again at the Alexandra Palace, pocketing \u00a3500,000 for his work over the festive period.\n\nCross and Van Gerwen are back in action this weekend at the non-ranking World Series of Darts finals in Amsterdam.\n\nMORE: Ross Smith reacts to stunning Michael van Gerwen victory at European Championship\n\nMORE: Michael van Gerwen explains why \u2018darts needs people like Gerwyn Price\u2019", "description": "Rob Cross has his sights firmly set on knocking Michael van Gerwen off his perch as world number one after his European Championship victory at the weekend.
