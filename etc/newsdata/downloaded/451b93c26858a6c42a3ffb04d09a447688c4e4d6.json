REUTERS/Simon Dawson\n\nThe FTSE 100 .FTSE closed 0.8% higher, earlier touching its highest level in nearly eight weeks, after China's commerce ministry said it was is in close communication with Washington over next month's trade talks, and President Donald Trump said overnight that a deal could be struck soon.\n\nGains were seen across all the sectors, led by heavyweight energy stocks (RDSa.L) (BP.L) and shared among financials and healthcare shares, which, along with sterling weakness, helped Britain\u2019s main index outperform the broader European benchmark.\n\nChina\u2019s conciliatory statement also offset losses in tobacco firm Imperial Brands, education company Pearson, British Airways owner IAG and cruise operator Carnival, all of which warned on results.\n\n\u201cKeeping the FTSE buzzing was its commodity sector, obviously influenced by Trump\u2019s trade deal rumours, alongside the continued misery of sterling,\u201d Spreadex analyst Connor Campbell said.\n\n\u201cThe pound failed to make any in roads to regarding a recovery... paralysed by all the recent talk of a general election.\u201d Campbell added.\n\nA weaker currency broadly helps bigger, internationally focused companies by inflating the value of their overseas revenues, but can weigh domestically focused small and medium sized firms.\n\nThe mid-cap FTSE 250 .FTMC inched higher after three consecutive sessions of losses but was only up 0.2%, with gains kept in check by the weaker pound as the Brexit malaise showed no signs of easing.\n\n\u201cA testy session for MPs (members of parliament) yesterday sets the tone for the run-in to the Brexit deadline.

Increased regulatory scrutiny and retailers reluctant to stock vaping products is seriously undermining that hope,\u201d Hargreaves Lansdown analysts said.\n\nPearson (PSON.L) slid 14% to its lowest since late February 2018 after saying full-year profit would be at the bottom of its guided range, while IAG (ICAG.L) also fell 4% after blaming pilot strikes for an expected 215 million euros shortfall in annual profit.\n\nLondon-listed shares of cruise-operator Carnival (CCL.L) dropped 7% after slashing its annual profit forecast as it expects to take a hit from higher fuel prices.\n\nAmong mid-caps, travel-food company SSP Group (SSPG.L) fell the most on the index as it slipped 9%, after saying it expected challenges in 2020 due to economic uncertainties and expectations of capacity cuts by airlines.", "description": "London's FTSE 100 share index surged to multi-week highs on Thursday, outpacing its European peers, as signals that the Sino-U.S. trade war could soon be resolved overpowered losses in blue-chip stocks drowned by profit warnings.", "authors": ["Yadarisa Shabong", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434054566&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P0FO", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
