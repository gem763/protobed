He said he continues to have pain in his ribs and back, while his niece had an 'impressive bump just above her right eye, bruising along the right side of her chin and a headache' for about a week after the incident, and his nephew had a headache for the rest of the day.\n\nHe said Center Parcs had shown a 'complete lack of responsibility' in failing to explain why the raft had overturned - adding: 'every family that rides the Tropical Cyclone is at a potential risk of their raft overturning'.\n\nJust a week later in the pool at the same resort a young boy died after suffering from a 'known condition' despite CPR from members of the public - while holidaymakers complained about the pool's closure and one demanded a refund\n\nThe layout of the sub-tropical paradise at Center Parcs in Longleat, Wiltshire\n\nThe company said incidents of rafts overturning were 'extremely rare' and more than 340,000 rafts had travelled safely down the course in the last six months, and that riders were briefed on the nature of the ride.\n\nHave you have a flume accident?

The ride is described on the Center Parcs website as 'one of the most exciting rides' in the park with a 142m-course of 'twists, turns and gravity-defying drops'.\n\nLast year the holiday firm was fined \u00a3250,000 for health and safety breaches after a girl broke her wrist falling from a tree at their holiday village in Woburn.\n\nIn 2016 a mother of two needed seven staples in her headfollowing an accident on the same ride at the Woburn site.\n\nAnd earlier the same year video footage showed Rea Smith, 16, being taken to hospital on a spinal board after being thrown from the rubber ring and cracking her head on the same slide.\n\nAnne Jennings sustained a laceration to the back of her head, injury to her neck, left ankle, back, chest and right thigh and cognitive problems after the incident on the water slide\n\nMrs Jennings experienced on-going symptoms due to her head injury, including memory loss and confusion with speech, as well as pain and in her neck and ankle\n\nAnne Jennings, 67, was on a four-person raft when she struck the top of her head on the Tropical Cyclone slide, causing her to fall into the water.\n\nA family member, who is a trained lifeguard, hauled her out of the water and she was then taken to Bedford hospital on a stretcher.\n\nThe mother-of-two has had to undergo months of therapy having suffered post-traumatic stress disorder following the incident on February 2.\n\nShe said: 'I have had cancer of the breast twice and that didn't kill me but Center Parcs almost did, and I'm a bit cheesed off about that.'\n\nA Health and Safety Executive investigation found the ride to be dangerous and changes were made. Center Parcs accepted liability for Mrs Jennings' accident.\n\n*** Have you been flipped off a flume raft? Have you been involved in an accident at Center Parcs?
