I can relate\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "FKA twigs lives in a real house, in the real world, though this seems hard to believe. She appears so alien, in her music and her performances, in the way she presents herself, that you\u2019d be forgiven for believing that she lived in a cryo chamber alongside bejewelled hip-hop robots, or a martial arts monastery surrounded by an enchanted thicket of thorns.\n\nTwigs\u2019 art is not of the stripped-back, real me, acoustics-and-grubby-jeans variety. She arrived on the scene in 2012, whispering like Tricky, clattering like the xx, romancing like Prince, singing like Kate Bush, yet not actually quite like anyone else. A polymath \u2013 she is a beautiful dancer and has directed pop videos and immersive theatre \u2013 she works in experimental hinterlands, creating atmospheres rather than singalong stories. For example: the sparse and sad track Cellophane, released in April as the opening single for her new album, was accompanied by a video that featured twigs athletically pole-dancing in a sparkly bikini before being eaten by a lookalike insect, falling into watery depths and being covered in orange mud by caring tortoise creatures. Twigs is about intensity, beauty, sexuality and freakiness.\n\nBecause of this, I\u2019ve geared myself up for her to be a tricky interviewee. Distant. Abstract. Maybe a bit defiant. But twigs is not like this. She is friendly and quite serious. She has a light, RP voice with a slight lisp and a young face; though she is now 31, she can seem 10 years younger, especially when she laughs.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest At Glastonbury in 2015. Photograph: WireImage\n\nWe meet in her lovely home in east London. Her sitting room is olive green, with plants and a piano, fossils and tapestries and books about jazz. Preserved snakes twist under glass domes. There is a Diptyque Feu du Bois candle burning. The vibe is part museum of curiosities, part comfy boutique hotel. Her small dog, Solo, is lounging on the rug. \u201cI found her in LA four years ago, behind a nail salon,\u201d twigs says. \u201cShe was tiny, about six months old, and all alone.\u201d (For the dog spotters: Solo enjoys chasing a ball and can do sit, paw and lie down. And, yes, she sleeps on twigs\u2019 bed.)\n\nTwigs thinks about how she presents herself. For this interview, she has dressed in an embroidered white shirt, Burberry shorts and white socks, with velvet ribbons at her throat. Her hair is partly dyed a wild red. Like the dancer she is, she\u2019s poised but casual, plonking herself on the floor (all dancers sit on the floor). Sweetly, she has three types of posh juice for me to choose from, though she herself drinks herbal tea.\n\nIt\u2019s taken her some time to sort her house out; for quite a while, she just had a sofa, a bed and a TV: \u201cVery discombobulating,\u201d she says. Before that, she\u2019d been living in a rented house share, and didn\u2019t have the money to furnish her new pad, though now she does (Nike appointed her creative director for a 2017 womenswear campaign, and she\u2019s made an advert with Apple, so her money situation has improved). Anyway, even if she\u2019d had the cash, she wouldn\u2019t have been up for decorating; she has had a difficult couple of years.\n\nIt felt like I\u2019d made this ornate golden birdcage. And I stepped in and was like, oh gosh, this is actually a nightmare\n\nThough she didn\u2019t make it public \u2013 and refuses to talk about it with me \u2013 in 2017 she split up with her long-term boyfriend Robert Pattinson, the Twilight Saga actor who\u2019s set to be the next Batman. Their relationship had brought her tabloid scrutiny and weird fan abuse: Pattinson fans can be rabid, and racially trolled twigs on social media. After their split, she no longer had a home base in LA \u2013 plus she was ill (more about this later) and, most importantly for her, she was in an artistic fug.\n\nShe found the new album \u2013 Magdalene, her second \u2013 really hard to make, she says, mostly because she wanted to change but couldn\u2019t figure out how. She began work on it as soon as she had finished her first, LP1, but couldn\u2019t find the right sound, and couldn\u2019t write songs in the way she wanted. Producers assumed she wanted to work with the fractured, futuristic noise of LP1 again and she felt trapped. Though she managed one song \u2013 Day Bed, which ends the album, and is about being depressed \u2013 she was stuck, workwise, in an artistry of her own making.\n\n\u201cI find it easy to write over complete musical randomness,\u201d she says. \u201cBut that\u2019s not what I wanted. I wanted something simpler, something honest. It felt like I\u2019d made this ornate golden birdcage, and everything was so intricate \u2013 like tapestries and beading and beautiful wirework. And I stepped in and I locked the door and I was like, oh my gosh, this is actually a nightmare.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest With Robert Pattinson in 2016\u2026 Photograph: WireImage\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2026and Shia LaBeouf in 2018. Photograph: Backgrid\n\nHer process of breaking free ended up being pretty thorough. Her music altered, her relationship ended, her health went haywire. A disciplined workaholic, twigs sees life as a matter of spinning plates \u2013 \u201cYou have family and friends, and you have adult things, like where you live and bills and stuff like that, then your health, maybe your relationship\u201d \u2013 and, for a while, around 2017, nearly all the plates dropped to the floor and smashed. \u201cEverything was in complete turmoil,\u201d she says. \u201cThe only thing that didn\u2019t get smashed or shaken was one or two great friends.\u201d\n\nThings came to a head in LA, in just one week. She\u2019d been searching for the right musical collaborator, and had found one in cult electronica artist Nicolas Jaar. They wrote Cellophane together in about 20 minutes, and she was thrilled. But she also felt physically terrible. She had a lump in her stomach that she\u2019d been ignoring for months and one day that week, she woke and found she couldn\u2019t sit up. She phoned her stepfather. \u201cI said, \u2018OK, I fucked up. I have some terrible thing in my stomach and it\u2019s really big and I must have stomach cancer and I\u2019ve not told anyone and I just don\u2019t think there\u2019s any coming back.\u2019\u201d Twigs says this all in rapid-fire full tragedy mode, rolling her eyes at herself. What did your stepfather say? \u201cHe said, \u2018Go to the doctor.\u2019\u201d\n\nAn ultrasound scan revealed not cancer, but fibroids \u2013 hormonal growths on her uterus. Twigs\u2019s were enormous \u2013 \u201cTwo cooking apples, three kiwis and a couple of strawberries: a fruit bowl of pain,\u201d as she described them on Instagram \u2013 and she had laparoscopic surgery, back in the UK. \u201cThey went in through three or four entry points\u201d \u2013 she points at her stomach \u2013 \u201cand pulled out the fibroids, like a string of sausages, through my bellybutton.\u201d\n\nShe had been in pain for a while; plus the fibroids had been pressing down on her bowel and bladder, making her want to pee all the time and giving her unpleasant IBS symptoms. She remembers working on a video before the operation. \u201cI had to do voguing in it and the choreographers, these two women, weren\u2019t very nice and said, \u2018You\u2019re really lazy and you keep going to the toilet all the time.\u2019 My whole life, I\u2019d never been called lazy. It made me break down.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Clothes and jewellery: Chanel. Photograph: Campbell Addy/The Guardian. Styling: Matthew Josephs.

Manicurist: Imarni at Imarni Nails\n\nAs if to prove how un-lazy she is, a few weeks after the operation she got a call from the director Spike Jonze. He wanted her to audition for an ad he was making for Apple\u2019s HomePod. For the audition, she had to dance around this very room in front of her laptop, hoping her stitches wouldn\u2019t split. \u201cThen they said, \u2018That\u2019s great. Now can you do it again and, like, touch the objects in the room?\u2019\u201d She laughs. But being a pro \u2013 she had spent years as a dancer for hire \u2013 she did as they asked. \u201cI was like, \u2018Sure, from the beginning of the song or halfway through? No problem. You want it again, but in a crop top?\u2019\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s joking, but both incidents indicate the same thing about her. Twigs is a worker. She moved to London from Cheltenham when she was 17 and spent a few years as a back-up dancer, hired to shimmy behind stars such as Ed Sheeran, Kylie Minogue and Jessie J. Even now that she\u2019s an artist in her own right, she flips between being in charge, as a musician and director, and being directed, when she\u2019s dancing. She\u2019s more inclined to the former, though doesn\u2019t mind being told what to do if she\u2019s learning and she thinks the work is good. She likes collaboration, and \u201cI have a good taste barometer\u201d.\n\nAnyhow, she wants to talk more about fibroids, because she had never heard of them until she got them, even though many women suffer with them, especially women of Caribbean origin (twigs is half Jamaican). She\u2019s learned that they can be managed through stress management and diet: it\u2019s important to avoid sugar and foods with oestrogen, she says \u2013 soy, dairy, non-organic meat. Also, receipts.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest In concert in New York in May this year. Photograph: Getty Images\n\nReceipts? I say, wondering if I\u2019ve heard her wrong.\n\n\u201cYes. The paper they use, the ink, there\u2019s something about it that\u2019s got a lot of oestrogen and you ingest it through your skin.\u201d\n\nHmm, I say, but when I check later, I discover twigs is right: receipt ink contains BPA, an artificial oestrogen, which can be absorbed through contact. God, what a tricky thing. She also avoids tap water, because it has traces of the pill in it, and can\u2019t use hormonal contraception: \u201cI\u2019m a believer in western medicine, but there are other ways, depending on how your body works.\u201d She has been really careful, but still her fibroids grew back within three months. Now she has six more, which she is managing. \u201cAs soon as I had my operation, I felt so much better,\u201d she says, \u201clike all these trapped-up feelings were released. But I\u2019ve never felt the same since. I\u2019m different.\u201d\n\nShe has thrown herself into getting immensely fit. She knew that she wanted to pole dance for the video for Cellophane and it took her six months of training to get strong enough to do it. She is a true athlete now: she has learned how to do an aerial cartwheel, she is proficient in a type of sword kung fu called wushu, which she\u2019s been using in her live shows. She chose to learn this, she tells me, because it\u2019s the opposite of pole dancing, very grounded and \u201cweighted in the pelvis\u201d, requiring her to use her legs. She is stronger than she\u2019s ever been.\n\nI do wonder about the pole dancing. She\u2019s done it before, in the video for Fukk Sleep, an A$AP Rocky song she guested on, where it was more straightforwardly man-pleasing. But twigs has always explored her sexuality in her work and tells me, \u201cMy sexuality tank and my creativity tank are the same tank, which is great, but also quite frustrating.\u201d If she\u2019s feeling sexually confused or uninspired, then her work is off; but equally, if her work is good, then she feels strong and sexual. In the Cellophane video, she is unbelievably sexy, but her needy lyrics \u2013 \u201cDidn\u2019t I do it for you? Why don\u2019t I do it for you?\u201d \u2013 play against this.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d she says, \u201cI think that, in society, as a woman, you can be this beautiful creature and you want to be that for yourself, but there\u2019s also a part of you that is doing it for the approval of the opposite sex. And that can lead you to feeling, \u2018Am I good enough? Have I done enough?\u2019\u201d\n\nIf it seems a bit extreme \u2013 twirling around a pole in the full splits position just to get a man to think you\u2019re great \u2013 well, twigs has started asking questions about such things. She watched the great Kathy Burke TV series All Woman, which she loved, and she\u2019s been noticing how women often do the \u201cemotional labour\u201d of a relationship, what she calls \u201clearned behaviour\u201d. To her chagrin, she is often referred to in terms of her boyfriends (since Pattinson, she\u2019s been linked with another actor, Shia LaBeouf, and is dating Reuben Esser, fashion editor of Another Man magazine). It irritates her, but she is also conflicted about relationships in general.\n\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been indoctrinated to feel like when I\u2019m with a man, things are better,\u201d she says, \u201cregardless of whether they are or not. I\u2019ve been made to feel like, if I\u2019m with a man, then I\u2019m doing the right thing, I\u2019m validated, I have a tick to my name. And even though I don\u2019t really believe that, because I\u2019m intelligent and I understand things, it\u2019s somewhere inside me.\u201d\n\n***\n\nTwigs grew up in Cheltenham as Tahliah Debrett Barnett, the only child of an English-Spanish single mother from Birmingham, who\u2019d moved out to the countryside to give her daughter a better life. And it was, twigs says; she loved being outside, she enjoyed nature. The walls and ceilings of her room were painted dark blue, with stars and moons on them.\n\nAs a child, she had a great imagination \u2013 \u201cIt was on fleek!\u201d she says \u2013 and often mixed up daydreams and reality: until she was about 12, she sort of believed she could fly and hang in the air, simply by jumping off the stairs. Clever and hard-working, she got a scholarship to a private all-girls Catholic secondary school, which she enjoyed while feeling entirely different from everyone else. There were no other mixed-race students. Her stepfather, who moved in when she was little, was one of the few black people in her life. When he gave lifts to her friends, she was embarrassed by the music he played in the car: acid jazz, real jazz, Fela Kuti, Nina Simone. She would ask him to play the radio instead, though he never did.\n\nMy mother would pump me up and I\u2019d be like, 'Yes, I am pretty', then go to the school disco and want the floor to eat me\n\nHer mother took pains to make her feel beautiful, telling her her hair was lovely and her skin colour was gorgeous, but she didn\u2019t feel it. \u201cShe\u2019d pump me up at home and I\u2019d be like, \u2018Yes, I am pretty\u2019 and I\u2019d get dressed up and think, \u2018Yes, I feel good.\u2019 And then I\u2019d go to the school disco and as soon as I got there I\u2019d want the floor to eat me, because all my friends had this perfectly straight blond highlighted hair.\u201d When, aged 15, she asked her friend to come with her to a bashment party called Jamaican Club in Gloucester, her friend only came once, because, she told twigs, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable as the only white person there.\n\n\u201cAnd I was like, \u2018That\u2019s how I feel every day at school!\u2019\u201d Twigs says, almost laughing with outrage. \u201cI got angry. \u2018That\u2019s how I feel when I go to your brother\u2019s house party and it\u2019s all Cheltenham Ladies\u2019 College girls. When I go round people\u2019s houses and they\u2019ve got swimming pools and ponies in the back yard!\u2019\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest On The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon in 2016. Photograph: Getty Images\n\nThere is something about twigs that will always feel other, even now. She\u2019s not often been allowed to fit in. When she moved to London and enrolled in dance college, she missed the first two weeks because her mother was looking for somewhere for them to live. Before she arrived, the teacher told the whole of her year and the year above that they had better start working, because this brilliant dancer was about to join them \u2013 twigs \u2013 and was going to wipe the floor with them. \u201cSo I turn up on my first day, in my pink leotard with my hair in a bun, with my farmer\u2019s accent, like, \u2018Hi guys!\u2019 and everyone\u2019s like, \u2018No, absolutely not.\u2019 My shoes went missing, my leotards\u2026 I think I lasted a month.\u201d\n\nPeople thought I was odd-looking, until a white male validated my beauty. But if I sing well, you can\u2019t question that\n\nShe went to Croydon College to do six (six!) A-levels \u2013 sociology, psychology, fine art, English literature, philosophy, French \u2013 but found it hard moving into a class of 30 kids when, at her previous school, there were only 12. Everything was confused and confusing: she remembers going into an exam, looking at a question and thinking, \u201cWe haven\u2019t been taught this.\u201d After college, she wanted to get into the music industry, but couldn\u2019t work out how you did it. So she was a youth worker in Borough and Tower Bridge, a shot girl at Tiger Tiger. She continued with her dancing. Then, when she was 24, a photographer spotted her and put her on the cover of style magazine i-D. She got a manager who started teaming her up with producers \u2013 surprisingly, she learned songwriting for a time with Mike Chapman, veteran of the Sweet (she tells me he taught her how to structure a song) \u2013 and finally, she released the four-track EP1, in 2012. Every track was accompanied by a video, directed by her.\n\nIt\u2019s been a while since twigs has been asked to look so far back, and she is different now, she says. \u201cI was a young woman, stepping into my sexuality and owning it. I was sassy! Coming from the outside and being alternative. Not like a Nubian queen, not a powerful goddess \u2013 but something just as powerful, but fractured. Like in Japan, where they smash the pots but join them up again with gold.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Winning the best video award at the 2015 Mobos. Photograph: Getty Images\n\nNow, though less sassy, she still feels good. \u201cPeople thought I was quite odd-looking, until a white male validated my beauty,\u201d she says. (She means Pattinson.) \u201cThat\u2019s frustrating and I still don\u2019t accept it. But if I sing really well, you can\u2019t question that. If I dance well, you can\u2019t question that. If I express myself honestly, or if I\u2019m pole dancing or wushu-ing excellently, you can\u2019t question that. I\u2019ve never felt more beautiful because I\u2019ve never been more skilled. Everything else is ephemeral.\u201d\n\nShe called her album Magdalene because of the way Mary Magdalene has been written about, she says: as a prostitute, when she was a healer and a mystic who washed Christ\u2019s feet in rare and expensive oil. \u201cAn incredible woman who was always in the shadow of a man,\u201d twigs says with irony. \u201cI can relate.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s a mass of contractions, twigs: a homebody who sparkles in the limelight, a seeker of male approval who wants to own her sexuality, a willing apprentice who\u2019s made for centre stage. And the next few years will be about her. She might be in a new relationship \u2013 \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m completely open to love\u201d \u2013 but she doesn\u2019t want to compromise, to mould her life around someone else, man or child. \u201cI\u2019d like children in my late 30s,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause as a dancer, your body doesn\u2019t come back.\u201d She wants to enjoy her new strength. \u201cIt would be a shame if I didn\u2019t question what it is to be in a relationship,\u201d she says. \u201cI think I need to do that, to grow. And to make sure when I meet someone wonderful, it can be on my own terms. I hesitate to talk to you about it, because I would love to have a piece written about me where my name is not attached to a man.\u201d\n\nBut you were dating someone very famous, I say.\n\n\u201cBut my work was so beautiful,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was so much louder than my love life. It is so much louder.\u201d\n\n\u2022 The album Magdalene is out on 25 October.\n\nIf you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).", "description": "After a breakup with Robert Pattinson and emergency surgery, the queen of art pop has written her most personal album yet \u2013 and come out fighting", "authors": ["Miranda Sawyer"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0f19a7e56e880faf17b2410b9513568847c8621/0_0_5776_3466/master/5776.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e003f4defb3b0446fef243143a493f5a", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
