We'll be watching to see what candidates say about health care. Check out TheHill.com for live coverage of the debate.\n\nWe'll start with South Bend, Ind.

And if the earlier debates are any indication, there's sure to be a lot of debate about Medicare for All...\n\nPete Buttigieg is going on the offensive early, presaging some possible fireworks tonight.\n\nHis new ad, titled \"Makes More Sense,\" features a number of television anchors and analysts talking about the South Bend, Ind., mayor's plan, and comparing it favorably to Sanders's and Warren's \"Medicare for All\" proposal.\n\n\"Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersSupport drops for Medicare for All but increases for public option Hillicon Valley: Warren takes on Facebook over political ads | Zuckerberg defends meetings with conservatives | Civil liberties groups sound alarm over online extremism bill On The Money: Trump touts China trade deal | Wall Street, Washington see signs for caution | Trump threatens sanctions on Turkey | Sanders proposes sharp hike to corporate taxes MORE and Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Ann WarrenSupport drops for Medicare for All but increases for public option Hillicon Valley: Warren takes on Facebook over political ads | Zuckerberg defends meetings with conservatives | Civil liberties groups sound alarm over online extremism bill Feehery: Trump may be down, but he's not out yet MORE believe that we have to force ourselves into Medicare for All, where private insurance is abolished,\" Joe Lockhart, a CNN political analyst and former press secretary to President Clinton, said in a video clip that was included in the ad.\n\n\"Mayor Pete said, 'Medicare for all who want it.' That's a much better formulation,\" CNN political commentator Van Jones said in another clip in the ad.\n\nBigger picture: Buttigieg is trying to rise in the polls in a more moderate lane than the progressive frontrunners, Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), and he clearly thinks health care is a way to do that.\n\nRead more here.\n\nFederal judge overturns ObamaCare transgender protections\n\nA federal judge on Tuesday overturned ObamaCare protections for transgender patients, ruling that a 2016 policy violates the religious freedoms of Christian providers.\n\nJudge Reed O'Connor in the Northern District of Texas vacated an Obama-era regulation that prohibited providers and insurers who receive federal money from denying treatment or coverage to anyone based on sex, gender identity or termination of pregnancy.\n\nIt also required doctors and hospitals to provide \"medically necessary\" services to transgender individuals, as long as those services were the same ones provided to other patients.\n\nO'Connor said the rule violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\n\nThe case has been on and off since 2016, when O'Connor first issued an injunction to stop the Department of Health and Human Services from implementing the parts of the rule that prohibited discrimination based on gender identity and termination of pregnancy.\n\nThe Trump administration has issued a proposed rule that would scrap ObamaCare's definition of \"sex discrimination\" to remove protections for gender identity.\n\nO'Connor, a George W. Bush appointee, is same judge who last year ruled the entire Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional.\n\nSupport drops for 'Medicare for All' but increases for public option\n\nSupport is dropping for Sen. Bernie Sanders's (I-Vt.) \"Medicare for All\" health care plan, according to a poll released Tuesday.\n\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation tracking poll found that 51 percent of those surveyed in October favored Medicare for All, a proposal in which all Americans would get their insurance from a single government plan, compared to the 53 percent who said they supported it last month.\n\nConversely, 47 percent of those surveyed said they opposed Medicare for All, an increase of 2 percentage points from September.\n\nSupport for Medicare for All has dropped 5 percentage points since April in the Kaiser Family Foundation tracking poll, and opposition has grown by 8 points.\n\nWhy it matters: Support for Medicare for All is dropping the more debate time it gets. The hospital, insurance and drug industries have also poured millions of dollars into dampening public support for the proposal.\n\nThe poll also found that support for the public option is increasing. Gradual changes to the health care system tend be poll better than complete overhauls, like Medicare for all.\n\nRead more here.\n\nRep.
