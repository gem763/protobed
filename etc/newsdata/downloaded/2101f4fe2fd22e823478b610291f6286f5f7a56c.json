Collazo had no clue she was pregnant.\n\nMost new parents get almost nine months to prepare for a new addition to their family.\n\nCarla Collazo had less than five minutes and is still organizing things for her new daughter, Amoura Rose, who was born on August 25 in her sister-in-law's bathroom.\n\nCollazo hadn't been nauseous or sick leading up to the delivery.\n\nShe hadn't gained weight.\n\nShe'd taken two pregnancy tests, one as recent as three weeks before Amoura Rose's birth, and both came back negative.\n\nThe Wilmington, Del. resident didn't realize what was causing her stomach pains until she felt something move out of her as she sat on a toilet.\n\n\"It feels good but I'm still kind of like in shock,\" the new mom said.\n\nCollazo assumed she couldn't have babies because doctors had said her polycystic ovarian syndrome would prevent it.\n\nYet, on August 25 at 5:42 p.m. she became one of the one in 475 women who experience a cryptic pregnancy. That's a medical term for women who don't exhibit the signs of pregnancy until the very end of their pregnancy or when they deliver.\n\nA normal day \u2014 until it wasn't\n\nThat Sunday started fairly routine for Collazo. She got up and took a shower like she normally did. Then she started to feel cramps.\n\n\"It was so bad I was like, 'I have to go to the hospital,' but because I didn't have insurance I just took a Tylenol and thought it would go away,\" Collazo said.\n\nIt didn't.\n\nThe receptionist was so uncomfortable she finally decided she must go to the doctor. She left her house, but her stomach started bothering her so much on the way to the emergency room, that she decided to make a pit stop at her sister-in-law's house to use the bathroom.\n\nAlexandra Santos said she and another cousin had noticed Collazo was unusually tired a few weeks leading up to that Sunday afternoon, but nobody suspected she was pregnant.\n\nCollazo's polycystic ovarian syndrome means she has irregular menstrual cycles, which makes it harder to time ovarian fertilization. The time between periods can be long enough that Collaza didn't realize anything was different.\n\nSantos said the pair had prayed for years that Collazo would have a baby. But she had stopped trying three years earlier. Santos remembered that Collazo had cried and been depressed.\n\nIn early August, Collazo's boyfriend suggested she take a pregnancy test. Although she had not gained weight or experienced other symptoms of pregnancy, he noticed she was sleeping more than normal.\n\nBoth tests came back negative.\n\nCollazo being put into an ambulance right after her daughter Amoura Rose was born in the bathroom of her sister's house in Wilmington on Aug. 25. More\n\n'Something's coming out of me!'\n\nWhen the cramps started that morning, Collazo said they were all in the front of her abdomen. She never considered it might be labor.\n\n\"I always heard stories about contractions being in the back,\" she said.\n\nWhen Collazo arrived at Santos's home, her sister told her to go to the bathroom and maybe take a shower to see if she would feel better. If not, Santos told her, she would drive her sister to the hospital.\n\nCollazo was sitting on the toilet, uncomfortable and in pain when suddenly, after pushing once, blood and water spurted out.", "description": "Carla Collazo had taken two pregnancy tests that came back negative and had been told by doctors she probably couldn't become pregnant.", "authors": ["Marina Affo", "Delaware News Journal"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_j4_zxcNNzoyIwl6See.WA--~B/aD05NjU7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_life_698/a74642432d0000321a1eb72f57982c37", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
