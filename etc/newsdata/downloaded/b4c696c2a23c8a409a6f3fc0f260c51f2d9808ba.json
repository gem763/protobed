Biden Jr. has raised $15.2 million in the past three months, his campaign said Thursday, a drop-off of $7 million from the previous quarter and a sum that falls short of two leading Democratic rivals.\n\nMr. Biden, who began the Democratic presidential primary leading in the polls, has seen his advantage slip, falling behind Senator Elizabeth Warren in several recent polls both nationally and in some early-voting primary states, including Iowa and New Hampshire. His total for the third quarter of the year was another sign of unsteadiness .\n\nSeveral of his opponents released their third-quarter totals earlier this week. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who has a strong small-dollar fund-raising base, pulled in $25.3 million, his campaign said Tuesday, while Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., reported $19.1 million raised during the last three months. Senator Kamala Harris of California raised $11.6 million.", "description": "The sum was $7 million less than Mr. Biden\u2019s fund-raising haul in the previous quarter.", "authors": ["Katie Glueck"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/30/us/politics/00BIDEN-MONEY/00BIDEN-MONEY-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
