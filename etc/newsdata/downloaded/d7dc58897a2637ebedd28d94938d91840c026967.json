He is nominated to lead the U.S. Trade and Development Agency. (Chris Wattie/Reuters)\n\nA Senate committee abruptly postponed a confirmation hearing Thursday for former Republican congressman Darrell Issa after his nomination to lead the U.S. Trade and Development Agency hit a snag over an issue in his FBI background check.\n\nThe postponement of Issa\u2019s hearing before the Foreign Relations Committee came after Sen. Robert Menendez (N.J.), the top Democrat on the panel, raised concerns about an FBI background check conducted on Issa that, he said, might be \u201cproblematic and potentially disqualifying for Senate confirmation.\u201d He did not reveal the nature of the issue, and other committee members who have not seen the FBI report said they, too, wanted time to review the issue.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not talking about a nominee\u2019s favorite color or where they had dinner,\u201d Menendez (N.J.) said. \u201cI\u2019m talking about serious issues that go to credibility and suitability for these positions.\u201d\n\n[Senate panel headed for clash over several diplomatic and development nominees]\n\nThe panel did move forward with hearings on three other Trump nominees, two of which have sparked some degree of controversy: Marshall Billingslea, nominated to serve as undersecretary of state for civilian security, democracy and human rights, faced questions about his record as a Pentagon official in the George W. Bush administration, in which he was involved in the approval of the use of torture techniques against military detainees.\n\nMichael Pack, who is nominated to become chief executive of the U.S. Agency for Global Media, was pressed on his association with Stephen K. Bannon, the former White House strategist and populist firebrand, and whether he would seek to impose his conservative views on the journalists he would manage at Voice of America, Radio Free Europe, Radio Televisi\u00f3n Mart\u00ed and other overseas media networks.\n\nIssa, however, did not give an opening statement, let alone answer questions. After conferring privately with Menendez and Issa, Committee Chairman James E. Risch (R-Idaho) announced the postponement after panel members objected to moving forward with the hearing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to get this file open so that all of you can have a chance to review that file and people to ask questions intelligently,\u201d he said.\n\nIssa, who is considering a bid for a House seat, said in an interview that he was willing to answer any questions about the matter in public Thursday and suggested that Democrats were only interested in delaying his confirmation.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that, as far as I know, what Senator Menendez is referring to, I\u2019m substantially certain, is all available on my Wikipedia,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that his goal is to stop me from serving the president.\u201d\n\nIssa said the only issue Menendez raised in their private conversation \u201chad to do with allegations of activity of mine when I was 17\u201d when he was an Army private. \u201cHe\u2019s not making allegations during my 18 years as a member of the House or anything else that was done as an adult,\u201d he added.\n\nJuan Pach\u00f3n, a spokesman for Menendez, declined to comment on Issa\u2019s claim.\n\nPast media accounts have detailed questions about Issa\u2019s military record, including a demotion and an allegation of car theft that did not result in prosecution. He has also faced scrutiny for another incident in his past, a 1982 fire that destroyed a business owned by Issa that was investigated as a possible arson.\n\nIssa, 65, came to national prominence by funding the 2003 drive to recall California Gov. Gray Davis (D). The effort succeeded in ousting Davis, but voters elected Arnold Schwarzenegger, not Issa, to replace him. Later, Issa drew headlines as chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee during the Obama administration.\n\nWhile his nomination remains in limbo, Issa has openly floated a possible run for the House seat now held by Rep. Duncan D. Hunter (R-Calif.). Hunter, who represents a neighboring San Diego County district to the one Issa previously represented until January, is facing a federal indictment on numerous campaign finance violations.\n\nThe candidate filing deadline is Dec. 6; Issa has told reporters he would run for the House if he is not confirmed to the trade post by early November.\n\nRisch on Thursday did not lay out a timeline for rescheduling Issa\u2019s hearing, nor a vote on his nomination.\n\n\u201cI commit to this committee, there\u2019ll be no vote on Mr. Issa until the White House has agreed to allow you all to see that,\u201d he said, referring to the FBI report.\n\nBillingslea, meanwhile, faced bipartisan scrutiny of his Bush administration record, with Menendez and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) raising concerns that he had advocated for so-called \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques\u201d as a senior adviser to then-Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld.\n\nMenendez pointed to a 2003 memo to Rumsfeld in which Billingslea called several of those techniques \u201cnot controversial\u201d despite later being banned by Congress.\n\nBillingslea said the techniques were not illegal at the time and that because he was \u201cnot an expert on interrogation\u201d he had to rely on other Pentagon officials\u2019 judgment. \u201cI never supported any measure that was remotely, possibly determined to be illegal by the lawyers,\u201d he said.\n\nPaul countered that there were, in fact, disputes inside the Pentagon as to whether the recommended techniques were legal: \u201cAt the time, you did agree to these things, and I think that\u2019s an important fact.\u201d\n\nSen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) asked Billingslea how he would have credibility as the top State Department deputy on human rights matters given his involvement in the approval of torture methods.\n\n\u201cWe have to talk to our counterparts about the fact that we are a nation of laws, and we learn from our mistakes, and we evolve,\u201d Billingslea replied. \u201cAnd therefore we will expect that other countries understand this and learn with us on these matters.\u201d\n\nPack addressed questions from Democrats about his background \u2014 particularly about his dealings with Bannon, who served as an executive producer of two documentary films that Pack produced and directed. Pack also praised Bannon in a March 2017 op-ed, calling him \u201camong other things, a successful conservative documentary filmmaker, a rare achievement.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow can we expect someone who has publicly embraced his role as a conservative documentarian to steward an agency that is charged with supporting independent, politically unmotivated press?\u201d Menendez asked.\n\nPack told the panel that he would be able to set his personal views aside to honor the traditional independence of the agency\u2019s journalists and pointed to his track record, including his time as an executive at the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and the former U.S. Information Agency.\n\n\u201cTheir independence is the bedrock of the institution,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess it comes down to the need to say no when you get a call from somebody, a political person, telling a journalist what to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you capable of saying no?\u201d Menendez asked.\n\n\u201cI think so,\u201d Pack said. \u201cI have said no before.\u201d\n\nRead more at PowerPost", "description": "Sen.
