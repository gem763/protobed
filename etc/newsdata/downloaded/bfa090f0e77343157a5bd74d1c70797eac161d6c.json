Just how to unwind to two mortgage giants\u2019 conservatorship clearly remains up for debate.\n\nSen. Sherrod Brown, the committee\u2019s ranking member, criticized the plan released last week, saying it \u201cwill make mortgages more expensive and harder to get.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t need to tell the president we have an affordable housing crisis in this country,\u201d Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, said.\n\nRead more: 5 major changes the Trump administration wants to make to housing finance\n\nIn his own opening remarks, Sen. Mike Crapo, a Republican from Idaho and the committee\u2019s chairman, seemingly anticipated the unlikeliness of a comprehensive housing reform plan moving out of the committee any time soon. He suggested the administration begin to take what steps it can to address the persistent issues with the housing finance system, noting that it could help make Congress\u2019 job easier if it eventually did produce a plan.\n\n\u201cOnly Congress has the tools necessary to provide holistic, comprehensive reform to our system that will be durable through any market cycle,\u201d Crapo said. \u201cHowever, it is important for the Administration to begin moving forward with incremental steps that move the system in the right direction.\u201d\n\nSenators touched repeatedly on the risk that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac still pose to taxpayers and the overall economy. Multiple senators cited concern with Fannie and Freddie\u2019s continued lack of capital, increasing the likelihood that the firms could need another bailout if another housing downturn occurs. \u201cThis whole thing is a car wreck,\u201d Sen. John Kennedy, a Republican from Louisiana, said.\n\nMnuchin, who repeatedly defended the administration\u2019s plan and disagreed that it would drive costs up for consumers, noted that his priority was to ensure that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have more capital. To that end, he reiterated comments he made to reporters earlier in the week that the Treasury Department is in discussion with the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) to end the \u201cnet worth sweeps\u201d that have seen the mortgage giants\u2019 profits directed to the Treasury Department as a means of repaying the $190 billion in bailout funds they received.\n\nNotably absent from the hearing was Democratic presidential candidate and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has already voiced her concerns about the Trump housing finance reform plan. Warren could have used the hearing as an opportunity to criticize the recapitalization and release of Fannie and Freddie on the basis that it would serve as a giveaway to Wall Street at the detriment of taxpayers, Cowen financial services and housing policy analyst Jaret Seiberg wrote in a research note.\n\n\u201cSen. Sherrod Brown did offer a progressive attack, but it focused more on how the plan failed to do enough on affordable housing and would let Wall Street profit off mortgage lending,\u201d Seiberg wrote. \u201cThat is not the same as attacking recap and release itself, which is what we expect Sen. Warren would do if she attended the hearing.\u201d\n\nOverall, Seiberg said it was surprising that so many lawmakers on both sides of the aisle seemed inclined to address the issue of Fannie and Freddie. However, Mnuchin declined to say whether President Trump himself had approved the plan, suggesting that the president may want to maintain some distance in case the plan proves unpopular.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t expect Trump to walk away, especially as the political attacks today were mild. Yet this could change during the campaign,\u201d Seiberg wrote. \u201cIt is why one must consider the election to be one of the bigger challenges to recap and release.\u201d\n\nWhat to do about affordable housing\n\nThere was broad agreement among senators that housing costs are unaffordable for many Americans, but they differed in their approaches in how to address this problem.\n\nMultiple Republicans, including Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, brought up the need to reduce regulations, particularly at the state and local level, that prohibit the construction of new, affordable housing units.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear to me that it\u2019s a lack of housing stock rather than a lack of subsidies that\u2019s the cause of the affordable housing problem,\u201d Toomey said.\n\nDemocrats meanwhile expressed concern about how the Trump administration\u2019s plan called for an overhaul of the \u201cduty-to-serve\u201d requirements for Fannie and Freddie. The Trump administration\u2019s plan recommended that Congress replace these existing affordable housing statutory goals \u201cwith a more efficient, transparent, and accountable mechanism\u201d that would rely on congressional appropriations to direct the affordable-housing funds.\n\nRead more: The surprising ways foreclosures make housing-market downturns even worse\n\nThis aspect of Trump\u2019s plan has attracted criticism from civil rights and consumer protection groups since it was released last week.\n\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac\u2019s \u201caffordable housing goals ensure that all credit-worthy people have access to quality mortgages,\u201d Jesse Van Tol, CEO of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, said in a statement. \u201cTheir affordable housing obligations should be strengthened, not weakened, before ending the government\u2019s conservatorship.\u201d\n\nOther Democrats grilled Secretary Carson over a HUD proposal released last month that some say would make it more difficult to bring forward housing discrimination complaints based on \u201cdisparate impact,\u201d meaning instances where discrimination may have been unintentional.\n\nCarson argued that HUD under his leadership has continued to use disparate impact as reasoning in cases it has brought forward, but this didn\u2019t sway Democratic lawmakers. \u201cWhat you\u2019re doing is making it damn near impossible for a complainant to bring forth a disparate impact\u201d case, said Sen. Doug Jones of Alabama.", "description": "There\u2019s bipartisan support for reforming Fannie and Freddie \u2014 but not as much agreement on how to approach affordable housing.", "authors": ["Jacob Passy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR026_sherro_ZG_20190910141054.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
