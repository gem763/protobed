It also flagged a revenue fall of 5.3 percent to 62 trillion won ($51.9bn)\n\n\"The strong smartphone sales has limited ability to fix all Samsung's issues,\" said Park Sung-soon, an analyst at Cape Investment & Securities. \"Data-centre customers, a major driver for memory chip business, are pursuing conservative investment for the time being, not particularly uplifting news for Samsung.\"\n\nShares in Samsung were up about 1.5 percent, just slightly before an 0.8 percent rise in the wider market in afternoon trade.", "description": "The South Korean tech giant says profits will continue to fall, but not by as much as they have been.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/8/e5aaf03724534b1487af17dee7bd66a3_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
