He gave no further details.\n\nFour journalists from domestic news website Iwacu and their driver, who had travelled to report on the violence, were arrested, the website editor wrote on his Twitter feed.\n\nThe motives behind Tuesday\u2019s planned attack were not immediately clear.\n\nAfter the 2018 attack in a neighbouring province, residents told Reuters it was likely it had been intended to warn off anyone from backing constitutional changes in the referendum.\n\nWhen the president stood for a third time in 2015, opponents said it violated a two-term constitutional limit.\n\nHis supporters beat, tortured and executed activists, suspected opponents and journalists, according to rights groups and the United Nations. Hundreds of thousands of people fled the tiny central African nation.", "description": "Security forces in Burundi have killed at least 14 armed men who had intended to launch an attack in the northwestern province of Bubanza, police and residents said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
