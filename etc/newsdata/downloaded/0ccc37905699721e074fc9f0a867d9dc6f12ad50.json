It was believed to make you fat and cause heart attacks, so everyone tried to get rid of it. Now, we know there's both good and bad cholesterol, so everyone wants less bad, and more good. So how does one accomplish this? Well, there are two kinds of solutions: the very good and the not so good. The drugs known as statins\u2014the most widely prescribed drugs in the US, used by 25 percent of Americans over 45\u2014claim to be all about reducing bad cholesterol (LDL). A fine goal! LDL clogs up your arteries and increases your risk of congestive heart failure and heart attack, along with other bad outcomes. By all means, let's get it under control. But statins aren't only about lowering LDL. They have nasty side effects:\n\nHeightened risk of type 2 diabetes and elevated blood sugar levels\n\nTripled risk of artery calcification, making heart disease more dangerous, not less\n\nDepletion of essential nutrients, including vital coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10)\n\nErectile dysfunction\n\nMuscle pain that can be deadly\n\nLiver dysfunction and acute kidney failure\n\nCataracts\n\nSerious memory problems, including a condition that can eliminate nearly all memory for days\n\nYes, there are better ways\n\nOmega-3 essential fatty acids\n\nBut, of course, statins are also about boatloads of money for Big Pharma\u2026so we tend not to hear much about the negative side of their money-making drugs. Could we please try something else?I have three natural cholesterol solutions that can reduce, or even eliminate your need for a statin drug.EPA and DHA, the two most common omega-3 essential fatty acids (EFAs) , are on my top five list of the best health protectors of all. They help raise healthy HDL cholesterol levels while lowering dangerous LDL cholesterol and triglycerides levels. Bingo. And there's a bonus. A recent study of coronary heart disease (CHD) patients on high-dose statin therapy found that adding EPA to their treatment \u201csignificantly reduced\u201d the amount of coronary plaque in their cardiovascular systems. Talk about good news! Just as important, in addition to maintaining the ideal ratio of good to bad cholesterol, omega-3s can take on:\n\nCancer\n\nDepression\n\nAttention-deficit hyperactivity disorder\n\nAbnormal heartbeat and stroke\n\nHardening of the arteries\n\nHigh blood pressure\n\nBergamot\n\nEPA and DHA can help prevent them, reduce their severity, or even reverse some of them. With no adverse side effects at all. Cover all those bases, and life is good. Omega-3 is abundant in fatty fish, such as salmon, sardines, mackerel, anchovies, halibut, trout, tuna, and sea bass. These too often are found in once clean, now polluted waters, so I recommend no more than 2\u20133 servings per week. A supplement is really the most reliable source of omega-3s. I recommend between 1,250 and 1,500 milligrams of EPA and DHA per day. But it\u2019s important to note, that 1,500 milligrams of an omega-3-rich fish oil is NOT the same as 1,500 milligrams of EPA and DHA. So be sure to read the labels on your omega-3 supplement. This citrus fruit is another wonderful solution for reducing statin dependence. New research shows that it has a statin-like molecular structures, and, far more important, statin-like benefits\u2014without the terrible side effects. A 2013 study followed 77 patients who took 1,000 mg daily of bergamot extract over one month. The participants\u2019 LDL cholesterol levels dropped by more than 30%! From an average of 278 mg/dL to 191 mg/dL. And HDL increased in all patients\u2014up to a striking 64.6 percent. Bergamot also contains compounds that affect the functioning of neurotransmitters in a way that decreases anxiety. This is consistent with the lovely sense of calm you get with bergamot essential oil aromatherapy. I recommend 500 to 1,000 mg of bergamot daily. But make sure you\u2019re working with your doctor, and don\u2019t discontinue using statins without supervision. I also recommend bergamot essential oil. It's highly effective in relieving digestive difficulties, reducing stress, healing infectious wounds, repelling insects, and more. And it's a lovely scent.\n\nIndian Gooseberry, or Amla\n\nReduces LDL cholesterol levels\n\nReduces triglycerides\n\nIncreases good cholesterol levels\n\nBlend two de-seeded and chopped up gooseberries and a cup of water in a blender\n\nStrain the juice through a muslin cloth or fine strainer\n\nAdd a teaspoon of honey before drinking\n\nThe Indian gooseberry, also called amla, is an Ayurvedic powerhouse that hits the sweet spots for cholesterol control:One amla berry has the vitamin C antioxidant power of two oranges, and that's its strength. When LDL cholesterol is oxidized in your bloodstream as you digest your food, it can turn into the sticky plaque that gums up your arteries and sends you toward dangerous heart problems. Antioxidants , as their name tells you, stop the oxidation, eliminating the threat of arterial plaque, keeping you heart-healthy. Amla can be found in supplements under the brand name Capros\u00ae. Or you can find these tart green berries and drink the juice. Here\u2019s an easy way to incorporate it in your diet:This will be most effective if you drink a cup every day. Along with cholesterol control, you'll be drinking a low calorie cancer fighter, diabetes preventer, weight loss aid, eyesight strengthener, reproductive health restorer, and more, along with vitamins A, B, C, E, and K, plus essential minerals, including calcium, phosphorus, iron, manganese, magnesium, copper, zinc, and more. The name\n\nGet your cholesterol clout on\n\nReferences\n\namla, by the way, comes from the Sanskrit word for \"the sustainer.\" No wonder. Bring it into your life and it will do a wonderful job helping to sustain you.I hope this will help you find a better way to control your cholesterol, whether it's the omega-3 fatty acids that can reduce your statin dosage or the bergamot and amla that can keep you from needing statins or other meds in the first place.
