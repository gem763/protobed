I believe that conditions must be created so that decentralized systems of this kind appear. We need to see how they develop [before legislating].\u201d\n\nGref also opined that Facebook's Libra token would likely not see the light of day in Russia because \u201cmany Russian players had already attempted to launch their own digital tokens.\u201d\n\nPresumably these \u201cplayers\u201d have not been successful in their efforts.\n\nMeanwhile the Central Bank and its arch-crypto skeptic governor Elvira Nabiullina have given no sign that they are prepared to tone down their hardline rhetoric.\n\nPer Wek, Nabiullina also spoke out yesterday, and reiterated that she was \u201ccategorically against the legalization of private currencies in Russia, both in kind and in virtual form.\u201d\n\nThe governor also poured cold water on the so-called crypto-ruble proposal that could see the country issue a digital fiat.\n\nShe stated,", "description": "In a move that will surprise nobody, Russia\u2019s parliament will again postpone its long-awaited cryptocurrency regulations.
