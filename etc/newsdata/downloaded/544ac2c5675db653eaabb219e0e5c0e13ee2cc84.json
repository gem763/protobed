England have a great squad and it\u2019s all about teamwork. Sterling is really fast, and speed is his strength, but he has great teammates.\n\n\u201cAs to our plan, we really need to focus on him, guard him, not let him turn around and always know where he\u2019s at.\u201d", "description": "England\u2019s defensive imperfections will be targeted by the Czech Republic\u00a0in Friday\u2019s Euro 2020 qualifier, according to head coach Jaroslav Silhavy If the Three Lions are able to continue their 100 per cent winning start to their qualifying campaign they will secure a place at the finals with three matches to spare.", "authors": ["Alice Reeves-Turner"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/10/19/Jaroslav-Silhavy.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
