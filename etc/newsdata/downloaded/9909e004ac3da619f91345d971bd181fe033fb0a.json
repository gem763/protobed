Presidential candidates like Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT) have slammed those fossil fuel efforts, indicating that the pipeline wars could become a key electoral issue next year.\n\nOn Friday, the Standing Rock Sioux asked a federal court to throw out what the tribe says is a flawed environmental assessment of DAPL\u2019s potential impacts. The Army Corps of Engineers \u201cnever engaged with the Tribe or its technical experts, shared critical information, or responded to the Tribe\u2019s concerns,\u201d the 63-page motion reads.\n\nAt issue is a key February 2017 environmental easement which enabled the Corps to proceed with DAPL construction. That easement allowed Energy Transfer Partners, which controls the pipeline, to avoid an environmental impact statement, which would have required a thorough review of DAPL\u2019s potential impacts to water and wildlife.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn June 2017, a federal district judge ordered the Army Corps to consider environmental impacts following litigation from the tribe. That ruling yielded no real change, however \u2014 the government still allowed the pipeline to go forward. But the Standing Rock Sioux say the Army Corps failed to engage with them over DAPL\u2019s environmental threat, and that they remain at risk of an oil spill.\n\nEarthjustice, an environmental legal group, filed Friday\u2019s motion on behalf of the tribe, arguing for a pause in construction while DAPL\u2019s potential impacts are assessed again, this time with input from the tribe.\n\nMoreover, the tribe is taking aim at a newly-proposed expansion of the pipeline, announced in June of this year, that would see its capacity enlarged to 1.1 million barrels of oil per day. DAPL currently produces around half that amount. \u201cWith DAPL\u2019s proposal to double the flow of the pipeline, the unexamined risks to the Tribe continue to grow,\u201d the tribe asserts.\n\nIf Friday\u2019s motion is granted, DAPL would be forced to shut down until the Army Corps conducts an environmental review. The pipeline currently runs from North Dakota\u2019s shale oil fields down through South Dakota and Iowa, into Illinois. The tribe has indicated they intend to fight DAPL in any way they can.\n\n\u201cThis illegal and dangerous pipeline must be shut down,\u201d said Mike Faith, Standing Rock Sioux chairman, in a statement.\n\nIt is unclear whether the Standing Rock Sioux will be successful in their efforts. But they already have support from several Democratic presidential contenders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast week, Warren became the first candidate to sign on to the \u201cNoKXL pledge,\u201d an anti-pipeline effort backed by groups including the pro-water and land conservation organization Bold Nebraska. The pledge targets the Keystone XL oil pipeline, along with DAPL and other fossil fuel efforts like the Mountain Valley and Atlantic Coast fracked natural gas pipelines in Appalachia. Signatories of the pledge commit to opposing all of these projects.\n\nOther presidential candidates have also embraced the NoKXL pledge. Gov. Jay Inslee (D-WA) quickly followed Warren, asking \u201cWhere do I sign?\u201d in a tweet expressing his support. Inslee has devoted his entire campaign to climate action and has promised to shift the United States to net-zero emissions by 2045.\n\nSanders and billionaire Tom Steyer have signed as well \u2014 both candidates have been vocal on climate issues. Bold Nebraska told ThinkProgress they believe other 2020 contenders will sign as the pledge gains momentum.\n\nPolling shows that climate issues are gaining traction with U.S. voters, and many are growing skeptical of fossil fuels. But pipeline projects are also emerging as an opportunity for Democrats to make inroads with indigenous communities, who have played a leading role in fighting fossil fuel expansion that often takes place on their tribal lands, and could be a key voting base in some states.\n\nThis week, a number of presidential candidates \u2014 including Warren and Sanders \u2014 are gathering in Sioux City, Iowa, for a presidential forum exclusively devoted to Native American issues. Audience members will ask candidates about a range of topics, and pipelines and climate concerns are likely to come up.\n\nWhen tribal concerns have conflicted with corporate profits or resource extraction, tribes lose. This has to change. When I\u2019m president, energy projects that impact Indian Country won\u2019t proceed without consent. That means revoking Trump\u2019s KeystoneXL and DAPL permits. \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) August 16, 2019\n\nWarren preemptively laid out her approach on Friday in a series of tweets about Native issues. She expanded on her opposition to Keystone XL and DAPL and framed her views in the context of indigenous rights.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen tribal concerns have conflicted with corporate profits or resource extraction, tribes lose.
