"ECB cuts key rate for first time since 2016 as recession fears grow", "language": "en", "text": "The European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday chose to cut one of its key interest rates for the first time since early 2016, pushing it into record negative territory.\n\nAs part of a sweeping stimulus package designed to boost the eurozone\u2019s ailing economy, the bank also announced that it plans to revive its controversial asset-purchasing programme from November.\n\nThe bank\u2019s deposit rate, trimmed by 10 basis points, is now \u22120.50%, meaning that commercial banks must effectively pay the ECB to hold their excess cash balances overnight.\n\nThe bank left unchanged its two other key interest rates, on main refinancing operations (0%), and the marginal lending facility (0.25%).\n\nThe bank had widely signalled that it was planning to cut rates as part of a package of stimulus measures.\n\nUnder the asset-purchasing programme, the bank will from 1 November make \u20ac20bn (\u00a318bn) in asset purchases each month in an attempt to pump money into eurozone banks and encourage lending.\n\nThe euro on Thursday fell against the US dollar (EURUSD=X) \u2014 hitting a two-year low in large part because looser monetary policy typically devalues a currency.\n\nChart: Yahoo Finance More\n\nIt also tumbled against the pound (EURGBP=X):\n\nChart: Yahoo Finance More\n\nThe governing council set no end date for the programme, but said in a statement that it expects purchases to run \u201cfor as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of its policy rates\u201d.\n\nThey would end \u201cshortly before [the bank] starts raising the key ECB interest rates,\u201d it said.\n\nKnown as quantitative easing, the previous \u20ac2.6 trillion programme had only been phased out in December 2018, when it looked like the eurozone\u2019s economy was picking up.\n\nThe ECB also moved to ease the terms of its long-term lending facility, meaning that some banks will be able to access lower rates on loans.\n\nIt also introduced a tiered system for its deposit interest rate, meaning that some struggling banks will be exempt from paying the ECB to hold their excess cash balances overnight.\n\nWhile Carsten Brzeski, the chief economist of ING Germany, said that Thursday\u2019s moves were a \u201cbig bang,\u201d he said it remained to be seen whether they would have the desired impact.\n\n\u201cDespite all the market excitement now, the question remains whether this will be enough to get growth and inflation back on track, as the real elephant in the room is fiscal policy,\u201d he said.\n\nAs far back as June, the bank\u2019s outgoing president, Mario Draghi, said that \u201cadditional stimulus\u201d would be required if the eurozone\u2019s lagging economy did not pick up.\n\nAt 1%, inflation within the 19-member currency union remains stubbornly below the bank\u2019s \u201cbelow, but close to, 2%\u201d target.\n\nREAD

soon enter a recession.\n\nBut it was at the bank\u2019s July policy meeting that the bank gave its strongest indication that it was planning to ease monetary policy.\n\nNoting that it was \u201cdetermined to act,\u201d the ECB said that it was prepared to cut rates and ready to adjust all of its policy instruments to boost inflation within the bloc.\n\nThe governing council of the bank said that it had tasked committees with examining policy options, including the re-starting of the asset-purchasing programme.\n\nREAD MORE: Christine Lagarde a 'dangerous look' for ECB\n\nExpectations of a significant change in policy were stoked in August when Olli Rehn, the head of Finland\u2019s central bank, said it was \u201cimportant\u201d that the ECB introduced \u201ca significant and impactful policy package in September.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the world of ECB-watching, such a sequence of signals is as close as it gets to a pre-commitment to action,\u201d said Claus Vistesen, the chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, in a note.\n\nDraghi, who steps down at the end of October, will be succeeded by former managing director of the International Monetary Fund Christine Lagarde.\n\nLagarde has been broadly supportive of Draghi\u2019s monetary policy path.", "description": "The European Central Bank chose to cut one of its key interest rates
