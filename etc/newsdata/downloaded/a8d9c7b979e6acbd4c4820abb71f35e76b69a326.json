They say they want to get carbon pollution to net-zero by 2050, calling the climate problem \u201cunquestionably urgent\u201d.\n\nProgressives, by comparison, have penned the Green New Deal, a blueprint for rapidly cutting heat-trapping pollution while fighting societal inequity. But the document, sponsored by the presidential candidate Bernie Sanders and congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, is not legislation and does not spell out specific policy changes.\n\nThe difference in the proposals highlights a rift between Democrats that is also on display with the 2020 presidential candidates.\n\nMore centrist politicians worry about playing into Republican messaging that climate-focused Democrats want to ban cheeseburgers and end air travel. And they say lawmakers should focus on what is politically achievable. Progressives say the climate crisis requires radical change.\n\nWhere Sanders has called for spending $16.3tn on climate goals and for going to war with fossil fuel companies, former vice-president Joe Biden would commit $1.7tn and has struggled to commit to phasing out the US natural gas that is contributing to heating the planet.\n\nCongressman Scott Peters, vice-chair of the New Democrats, maintained that his group\u2019s proposals aren\u2019t inconsistent with a Green New Deal and said some might be able to gain necessary support from conservatives.\n\nPeters said \u201crather than arguing about a political tool like the Green New Deal\u201d, Democrats should be making plans.\n\nPeters acknowledged his group has more to do, noting that their package of legislation doesn\u2019t include a plan to tax carbon pollution.\n\nBut he said \u201cthis is what you need to do to start a path to net-zero by mid-century\u201d. That\u2019s the goal the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has laid out for keeping temperatures from rising unacceptably higher.\n\n\u201cWe really don\u2019t have time to waste,\u201d he said.", "description": "New Democrat Coalition worried that Green New Deal plays into Republican messaging, seek \u2018secure durable climate legislation\u2019", "authors": ["Emily Holden"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/819b76137cd1a25aa846380758ec574c1f3cb499/379_425_3106_1864/master/3106.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2e3680acef1b7064ae00c864eaf71638", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
