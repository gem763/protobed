She recounted a discussion with a producer who scoffed at motherhood.\n\n\u201cSo, I swear I did kilometers of walking around the kitchen table while I was on conference calls with L.A. from New Zealand, trying to figure out whose voice was whose, but also trying to keep the baby quiet,\u201d Caro claimed. \u201cOne thing Hollywood doesn\u2019t particularly like is a baby in the mix. In fact, I went to meet the producer of a film for the first time, and he said, \u2018You\u2019re not lugging a whole bunch of kids around the world while you try to make films, are you?\u2019 And I said, \u2018No.'\u201d\n\n\u201cI was pregnant at the time,\u201d she added, \u201cbut he obviously couldn\u2019t tell.\u201d\n\nStill, Caro\u2019s helming of the film was not without some controversy. Some accused the studio of a sort of racism by having a westerner direct a film based on a Chinese legend. Caro was met with questions at the summit about why she was given the job to direct the film instead of an Asian director.\n\nA member of the audience asked how she \u201creconcile[d] taking the amazing and deserved opportunity to direct Mulan with the critique that perhaps the story should have been directed by someone of Chinese origin?\u201d\n\nIn reply, Caro insisted that Hong Kong producer Bill Kong advised Disney to hire someone outside o China to direct the project.\n\n\u201cIt was Bill who said to Disney that, \u2018Actually, this is a Disney film.\u2019 It\u2019s certainly about Chinese culture and a terribly old and important story there,\u201d Caro replied. \u201cBut the other culture to contend with is the culture of Disney. It\u2019s a very strong culture in the world that reaches many, many people. And so, between them, it was determined that they would widely search for directors that weren\u2019t solely Chinese.\u201d\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.", "description": "Niki Caro, the director of Disney's live-action \"Mulan\" spoke out against Hollywood's \"horrific\" prejudice against female directors.", "authors": ["Warner Todd Huston"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/NikiCaro1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
