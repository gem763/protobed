One such hashtag had garnered nearly 100 million views as of Tuesday afternoon, according to Variety.\n\n\u201cVery objective! To say such a comment in the US takes a lot of courage,\u201d one user wrote regarding James\u2019 comments.\n\nThe NBA\u2019s top Chinese sponsors, including streaming partner Tencent Sports, suspended ties with the league earlier this month to protest its defense of Morey\u2019s right to freedom of expression. Outrage among Chinese fans and officials is considered a major threat to the NBA\u2019s business interests in China, which are said to be worth $4 billion.\n\nJames has significant business interests of his own in China, including a lifetime contract with Nike, which earns billions from the region, and a film production company currently prepping \u201cSpace Jam 2\u201d for international release in the coming months.\n\n\u201cSo many people could have been harmed, not only financially but physically, emotionally, spiritually,\u201d James told reporters on Monday night. \u201cSo just be careful what we tweet and we say and what we do even though, yes, we do have freedom of speech. But there can be a lot of negative that comes with that, too.\u201d\n\nJames later sought to clarify in his position, noting that he was \u201cnot discussing the substance\u201d of Morey\u2019s tweet, but rather its potential ramifications. Later, he told reporters he would no longer discuss the situation in Hong Kong.\n\nAside from widespread criticism from U.S. social media users, several politicians rebuked James over his remarks, including Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. In Hong Kong, protestors were seen burning James' jersey.\n\n\"I don't have a problem with [athletes speaking out on politics]. What I have a problem with is when they don't know what they're talking about and they end up defending tyrants,\u201d Cruz told TMZ.", "description": "Hashtags supporting James, who said Morey was \u201cmisinformed\u201d on the situation before he tweeted, were among the top trending topics on China\u2019s Weibo platform.", "authors": ["Thomas Barrabi"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/AP19285745319902.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
