You just have to make the best of it. Even though it\u2019s difficult, it could be a lot worse.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSince the crash, she\u2019s undergone more than half a dozen surgeries, hundreds of hours of speech and occupational therapy, and suffered a severe infection. Her medical expenses top $1.7 million.\n\nAD\n\nOnce an associate designer for a D.C. architectural firm, she\u2019s trying to get back a sense of normalcy \u2014 and, she hopes, some feeling in her body. Livi, 27, is optimistic an experimental, unproven treatment she began this summer is part of the solution.\n\nHopeful for signs of feeling\n\nIt\u2019s early in her recovery, but Livi has made progress. She\u2019s gone from being in a coma, unable to talk and using a feeding tube to swallowing, eating solid foods, speaking and carrying on a conversation. But doctors say there\u2019s no clear path that ensures future advances.\n\nShe turned to an experimental form of stem cell-related injections they hope will rejuvenate her nerve connections and help her regain some movement, even if only to power her wheelchair. She realizes the treatments are a long shot, as scientists and medical associations have raised questions about whether such methods work.\n\nThe spinal cord is a bundle of nerves that sends messages between the brain and the rest of the body to control movement and feeling. Livi severely damaged the two vertebrae at the top of her neck. Those vertebrae, along with nerves and muscles, control functions such as breathing and allowing movement of the limbs, neither of which Livi can do on her own.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHer parents took her to a New Jersey radiologist who says he specializes in regenerative medicine, after Livi saw recommendations from members of an online spinal cord injury group. Livi said she didn\u2019t qualify for clinical trials, which often are affiliated with universities and have more regulations, because of the extent of her injuries and her ventilator.\n\nStem cell clinics multiply, with heartbreaking results for some patients.\n\nIf Livi shows progress, she could receive another treatment in six months.\n\n\u201cI hope it gets my lungs to work on their own,\u201d Livi said. \u201cEven if it just helps me to shrug my shoulders, that would be great.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always that way.\n\nLivi, the oldest of three girls, came to the United States from Albania at age 7. Her father had come to Austin for a job in 1998, then sent for her mother and the girls before moving the family to the Washington area in 2000.\n\nLivi liked roller coasters and enjoyed swimming and playing volleyball \u2014 sometimes at the sand courts near the Lincoln Memorial. She graduated in 2010 from Walt Whitman High School in Bethesda.\n\nAfter earning a bachelor\u2019s degree in interior design from Marymount University in Arlington, she got a job as a designer at an architecture firm and bought a condo in Foggy Bottom.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nShe visited her parents\u2019 Bethesda home for dinner every Sunday. She took cycling and yoga classes, and traveled to France, Amsterdam, Italy, Spain, Greece, Ecuador, Mexico and Germany.\n\nShe was where she wanted to be in life. Then came Sept. 17, 2017.\n\n'What happened to me?'\n\nA day earlier, she had competed in her first triathlon, placing 10th in her age group, at Dewey Beach, Del. She had gone to dinner with friends and spent the night at a hotel.\n\nAbout 10 a.m. the next morning, she left the hotel alone to buy a bottle of water for the ride home, but never made it. A speeding drunk driver swerved off the road, striking Livi from behind on the sidewalk.\n\nAD\n\nShe was thrown 10 feet into the air. A police sergeant called the crash one of the worst he\u2019s seen, adding that Livi \u201cnever saw it coming.\u201d\n\nUnconscious, Livi was flown to a trauma center. She was unable to talk, and with no ID on her, she was labeled Jane Doe.\n\nAD\n\nLivi wasn\u2019t responding to text messages from her friends, who were ready to check out of their hotel. They walked outside to find emergency vehicles, then figured out Livi had been struck after talking to passersby and police.\n\nHer friends alerted her parents, who frantically called hospitals to find her. Livi\u2019s mother, 57-year-old Rezarta Pejo, described to hospital officials her daughter and the unique tattoo on her right shoulder blade: a double-headed black eagle \u2014 a symbol from the Albanian flag. They found her at a Delaware trauma center.\n\nAD\n\nLivi didn\u2019t remember the crash. Doctors had put in metal plates to stabilize fractures between some of her vertebrae. She was unconscious for 20 hours and underwent several surgeries before waking. Livi was in a coma when her parents were allowed to see her at 9 p.m. that night. They learned she would be paralyzed.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t feel a thing,\u201d Livi said. She later asked her mom, \u201cWhat happened to me?\u201d\n\nHer mother explained there had been an accident, and she had been seriously hurt. Her parents, not wanting to scare her, tried to be encouraging.\n\nHer father, Ben Pejo, a 59-year-old architect, said he was stunned when he learned the extend of her injuries.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t believe it until we saw her, and then we had to accept it,\u201d he said.\n\nInvestigators later identified the driver as John Tai D. Johnson, then 29, of Wilmington, Del. Court documents indicate he was drunk and had cocaine, PCP and marijuana in his system at the time of the crash.\n\nAD\n\nHe is serving a sentence of two to five years for an unrelated theft in Pennsylvania, according to a spokeswoman at the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections. Upon his release, he will be tried in Delaware in Livi\u2019s case. He faces charges of vehicular assault, driving under the influence of drugs and other charges that could bring him five years in prison.\n\nAD\n\nJohnson\u2019s public defender declined to comment.\n\n'Grounded' expectations and nothing to lose\n\nLivi longs to feel aches, discomfort \u2014 any sign the treatment is working. Pain could mean she\u2019s regaining some feeling.\n\n\u201cIt means my nerves are connecting to my brain,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d rather feel something rather than have my body feel completely numb.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe treatment seems to help Livi need less frequently a medication that helps with low blood pressure, her family said. But stem cell treatments aren\u2019t without controversy.\n\nDoctors typically use a patient\u2019s belly fat, blood or bone marrow for such treatments. More recently, some have been offered using placentas, umbilical cords or cord blood. The Food and Drug Administration has warned that such experimental treatments are unregulated and unproven.\n\nLivi is receiving an exosomes stem cell-related treatment, which involves cells from donated placentas. The cells are \u201ccleaned and purified,\u201d Livi said, so they don\u2019t \u201ccontain DNA,\u201d then injected into her spine and blood.\n\nLivi said she hopes the treatments \u201cmake it easier for signals to pass from the brain, past the injury level and to the rest of the body.\u201d\n\nDouglas Spiel, the New Jersey doctor, said the treatment, which costs $12,000 per injection, can decrease inflammation and increase cell growth for those with injuries to the spinal cord.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou create a divot on a golf course and then you put the grass back down so it will grow,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to turn on the cells that are there and repopulate around that injury.\u201d\n\n\u2018Miraculous\u2019 stem cell therapy has sickened people in five states\n\nPaul Knoepfler, a stem cell biologist and professor at the University of California-Davis School of Medicine, said he\u2019s skeptical of clinic treatments involving exosomes because that field of study is new and those exosomes are untested. He said he believes such treatments aren\u2019t ready to be marketed to \u2014 or used on \u2014 the public.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just way too early to be using it on patients,\u201d Knoepfler said. \u201cWe just don\u2019t know enough. There\u2019s not enough data to support its use.\u201d\n\nHe wrote a blog post last year casting doubt on claims from Spiel\u2019s website that such treatments can possibly help conditions ranging from spinal cord injuries to stroke to baldness. That context \u201crisks giving patients the wrong idea that exosomes are some kind of proven panacea,\u201d Knoepfler said.\n\nAD\n\nRebecca Laming, vice president of marketing at the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation, said stem cell treatments for spinal cord injuries are in their infancy and \u201cpatients need to be very cautious when seeking treatments.\u201d The foundation was started by actor Christopher Reeve, who became paralyzed from the neck down after he was thrown from a horse.\n\nOne of Livi\u2019s doctors \u2014 Carlos E. Picone, a pulmonary specialist at Sibley Memorial Hospital in District, said the extent of her injuries will make it difficult for her to regain much movement. He called her case \u201ctragic\u201d and compared the stem cell treatments to \u201cputting a patch over the injury.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s wrong\u201d to assume the treatments will bring much improvement, Picone said. \u201cI don\u2019t want it to be wrong. But I think we need to be grounded.\u201d\n\nLivi said she\u2019s talked online to people who have spinal injuries and \u201cgotten good results\u201d from stem cell treatments. She said she realizes any benefits could be minimal at best, but she remains hopeful.\n\n\u201cEither it works or it doesn\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s worth a try because I have nothing to lose.\u201d\n\n'She's a very, very tough lady'\n\nLivi is using computer software that detects eye movements. Her pupil acts much like the cursor and mouse to work the software.\n\nShe\u2019s hoping to do work for her old architecture firm, designing office spaces. When her team at IA Architects recently won awards for design work on new offices in Baltimore, she attended the ceremony.\n\nShe also has friends who stop by to visit or help her family take her out to dinner. She\u2019s created abstract paintings with the help of a sister, something she never had time to do.\n\n\u201cI was so independent before,\u201d she said, as her mom wiped a strand of hair from her face one recent afternoon. \u201cI liked having my family around, but now I need them 24/7.\u201d\n\nAfter the crash, Livi spent eight months in hospitals and a rehabilitation center in Delaware and Pennsylvania, prompting her mom to leave work to care for her.\n\nChristopher S. Formal, a doctor who specializes in spinal cord injuries at Magee Rehabilitation Center in Philadelphia, recalled the support and love Livi received from her family and said she\u2019s made progress for someone with such extensive injuries.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of people with that combination of injuries who make that much progress. She\u2019s done it,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s very hard-working. She\u2019s a very, very tough lady.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Livi hopes to get off the ventilator and travel again. Maybe the family can resume its annual trip to Albania.\n\nFor now, she said, she\u2019s happy to have moved a few weeks ago to a renovated home in Bethesda, near the family\u2019s previous home near the National Institutes of Health. Her parents spent months trying to find a larger house to make room for her wheelchair. And Livi was able to use computer software to help make it accessible.\n\nContractors installed an elevator, knocked out walls, widened doorways and added a third floor, which the family hopes to use as a physical therapy space. There are new balconies so Livi can be taken outside and get fresh air.\n\nUnlike in her previous split-level home, she can get her wheelchair into the kitchen and instruct one of her younger sisters while cooking \u2014 one of Livi\u2019s hobbies.\n\nHer family retrofitted a bedroom on the second floor, so Livi is close to her parents. She picked photos from her travels, and her sister plans to hang them in Livi\u2019s new room.\n\n\u201cShe has never complained about anything. She\u2019s a very strong girl,\u201d Ben Pejo said of his daughter, his eyes filling with tears. \u201cShe\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d\n\nAlice Crites contributed to this report.\n\nHusband loses his \u2018Lifelong Valentine,\u2019 says wife wasn\u2019t feeling well before SUV went into the Potomac\n\nInjured D.C. cadaver dog is recovering after rescuers rushed her to treatment by helicopter\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Livi Pejo received an experimental form of stem cell-related injections to rejuvenate nerve connections, but doctors say expectations should be grounded.", "authors": ["Dana Hedgpeth", "Reporter Covering Local Breaking News"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/-ApEe99LL15ed8E3G3yTFdipoko=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6ZTIYOGVRMI6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
