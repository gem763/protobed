Destroying someone does not.\u201d\n\nMr. Gillis came under fire last week over his past use of racist and homophobic slurs after it was announced that he would be joining \u201cSNL\u2019s\u201d new season. The stand-up comedian gave a half-hearted apology to \u201canyone who\u2019s actually offended by anything I\u2019ve said,\u201d but defended himself as a \u201ccomedian who pushes boundaries.\u201d NBC later announced that Mr. Gillis would not be joining the show.\n\nMr. Schneider said he \u201cfelt sad\u201d when he heard Mr. Gillis\u2018 past comments, which included slurs referring to Asian Americans, women and homosexual men, but said he shouldn\u2019t have lost his job.\n\n\u201cI felt sad when i saw the clip,\u201d Mr. Schneider tweeted Tuesday. \u201cBut I was even more sad that he went there and it wasn\u2019t funny. Just an ugly conversation. He has the right to say it, cancel culture is wrong, but people have the right to call racist things racist as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cLast thought on this @Shanemgillis,\u201d he added. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference between exposing truths through Free Speech and just being ugly. It\u2019s not okay to say racist things under the guise of comedy. Just because you have a mic in your hand doesn\u2019t make the racist things you say any less racist.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
