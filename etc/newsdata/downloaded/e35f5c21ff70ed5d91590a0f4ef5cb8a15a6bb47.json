The move had been expected by those in the financial industry.\n\nIn announcing its decision, the Federal Open Market Committee changed the language it used to describe its future plans, and cut a clause that said the Fed is committed to \"act as appropriate to sustain the expansion\" of the economy. The phrase was used by Mr Powell to set the stage for a July rate cut, and has been used in official documents since.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.
