But Lam is only acting after months of police brutality, thug attacks on protesters, mass arrests, and barely veiled threats of security intervention from mainland China.\n\nHong Kong's leader withdraws extradition bill that ignited mass protests Read more\n\n\u201cThis is a government which has backed police abuses, threatened to use unlimited emergency powers, banned peaceful assemblies and arrested more than 1,000 protesters,\u201d said Kenneth Chan, a professor at Hong Kong Baptist University and former lawmaker. \u201cHaving gone through all this, few could thank Carrie Lam today.\u201d\n\nOver the last three months, a movement born out of concerns over one law has morphed into something much broader. Demonstrators have drawn up a list of five key demands, including a public inquiry into police violence, amnesty for arrested protesters and democratic reforms to bring universal suffrage.\n\nMany protesters saw Beijing\u2019s concession as meeting only the \u201ceasiest and \u2018cheapest\u2019\u201d of their five demands, said Lokman Tsui, an assistant professor at the journalism school of the Chinese University of Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cIn the last few weeks the bill hasn\u2019t been on most protesters\u2019 minds, actually,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead it\u2019s the government\u2019s response to the protests, the way they tried to silence and suppress the protesters \u2013 by using teargas, inappropriate levels of force, arresting people for protesting etc \u2013 that is at the heart of the ongoing protests.\u201d\n\nThe law would have allowed any resident or visitor to Hong Kong to be sent to mainland China to face trial in opaque, politically controlled courts, in effect destroying the legal firewall that underpins Hong Kong\u2019s economy and its political freedoms.\n\nPlay Video 4:43 Carrie Lam announces Hong Kong government will withdraw extradition bill - video\n\nIt spurred unprecedented protests because many in the city, including those who normally steered clear of politics, saw it as an existential threat to both their livelihoods and way of life.\n\nThe decision to drop it is certain to have been sanctioned by Beijing, which is balancing a desire not to look weak, and a fear that concessions will only embolden protesters, with concern over the political and economic toll of the protests.\n\nHong Kong is deeply embedded in the southern Chinese economy, and is an important portal to international financial markets for the whole country. The turmoil has also come as the trade war between China and the US deepens.\n\nHong Kong protesters vow to stay on the streets despite Carrie Lam concession Read more\n\nNews of Lam\u2019s announcement revived the city\u2019s main Hang Seng index, and demonstrators were quick to capitalise on market enthusiasm for the concession with memes such as one that asked: \u201cDid you know? If you respond to one demand, the Hang Seng index will rise a thousand points. Respond to five demands, the Hang Seng index will rise five thousand points.\u201d\n\nThe stakes are getting higher for both authorities and protesters as 1 October approaches, the 70th anniversary of the founding of communist China. Lavish national celebrations have been planned to mark the date, and the president, Xi Jinping, is unlikely to want them overshadowed by unrest in Hong Kong.\n\nDemonstrators have not been deterred by police violence, mass arrests or threats of greater use of force, and so the decision to withdraw the bill may have been a first attempt at compromise. But there are also fears that Beijing may just be paving the way for the use of force, by allowing Chinese authorities to claim they tried and failed to compromise.\n\n\u201cMy worry is that what she did is part of Beijing\u2019s blueprint to prepare a heavy crackdown,\u201d said Chan. \u201cThe state propaganda officials have on numerous occasions argued that the movement \u2018is no longer about the law, its subversive and anti-China\u2019.\u201d", "description": "The incendiary extradition bill has been binned but protesters\u2019 demands have grown", "authors": ["Emma Graham-Harrison"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1865df89174f0496409d28c8896631932cac9b2/0_76_2736_1642/master/2736.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8509815ef556d84e3a9bca5d6077365e"}
