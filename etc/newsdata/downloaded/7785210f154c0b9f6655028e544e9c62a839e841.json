Sandy Phillips' daughter, Jessica Ghawi, was one of 12 people killed during a midnight showing of the Batman film, \"The Dark Knight Rises,\" also distributed by Warner Bros.\n\nPhillips said she and four other people who lost loved ones in Aurora sent a letter to Warner on Tuesday, asking the studio to lobby Congress for gun control, support survivor programs and end any contributions to politicians backed by the National Rifle Association.\n\n\"When we learned that Warner Bros. was releasing a movie called 'Joker' that presents the character as a protagonist with a sympathetic origin story, it gave us pause,\" the letter reads. \"We want to be clear that we support your right to free speech and free expression. But as anyone who has ever seen a comic book movie can tell you: with great power comes great responsibility.\"\n\nLonnie and Sandy Phillips, the parents of shooting victim Jessica Ghawi, speak after a verdict was delivered in the trial of James Holmes at the Arapahoe County Justice Center on July 16, 2015 in Centennial, Colorado. Getty\n\nWarner issued a statement later Tuesday saying it has always supported victims of gun violence and calling on policymakers to enact bipartisan legislation to address what it called an epidemic.\n\nPhillips said she was compelled to act after seeing a trailer for \"Joker,\" the name of the Batman villain portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix in the film being released October 4.\n\n\n\nPhillips' support group, \"Survivors Empowered,\" and activist Igor Volsky of Guns Down America sent the letter to Warner CEO Ann Sarnoff.\n\n\"Companies like Warner have real leverage where Congress has failed,\" said Volsky, citing recent actions by Walmart to stop selling handgun and short-barrel rifle ammunition after a string of mass shootings. \"That's why we are not calling for a boycott of this film. They have an opportunity to lead on this issue.\"\n\n\"Joker\" has been the subject of much debate since it premiered late last month at the Venice International Film Festival, where it won the top prize. It's also expected to be a major awards contender.\n\nThe film is a character study of how Arthur Fleck, a mentally ill aspiring stand-up comedian and clown-for-hire, becomes the classic Batman nemesis.\n\nThe Aurora theater was remodeled and renamed after the 2012 shooting that also wounded 58 people. James Holmes was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison without parole.\n\nReached by telephone, an employee at Century Aurora and XD told The Associated Press on Tuesday that there were no immediate plans to show \"Joker\" at the theater.", "description": "An employee at Century Aurora and XD \u2014 site of 2012 shooting \u2014 said Tuesday that there were no immediate plans to show \"Joker\" there", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/24/978ace95-7baf-4c43-9922-5d34a8e3546c/thumbnail/1200x630/f6164e16e7914505b24fd7e64cf2bf6b/gettyimages-482087377.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
