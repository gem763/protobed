DFAT would not comment further on the three cases due to privacy reasons, and would not confirm whether the cases were related.\n\nAccording to a report by Australian state broadcaster ABC, one of the three is a British-Australian woman who has been behind bars for almost a year. The other two are a couple -- a British-Australian woman and her Australian boyfriend -- who were arrested in the past few months.\n\nBritain's Foreign Office wouldn't confirm the ABC report, but said in a statement that UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab had met Iran's ambassador on Wednesday and \"raised serious concerns about the number of dual national citizens detained by Iran and their conditions of detention.\"\n\nThe arrests come amid tensions between Iran and United States and its allies, including Australia and the UK. Since the decision by US President Donald Trump in 2018 to abandon the Iran nuclear deal , Washington has attempted to use what it calls \"maximum pressure\" to change Iran's behavior and limit its nuclear ambitions.\n\nRead More", "description": "Three Australian nationals, including two who also hold British citizenship, have been detained in Iran.", "authors": ["Julia Hollingsworth", "Sarah Faidell"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190911003037-iran-flag-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
