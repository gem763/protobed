GLOBAL MARKETS-Oil trims gains but Middle East risks keep stocks on back foot\n\n* Asian stock markets: https://tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4\n\n* Oil futures pull back, but risks to sentiment remain\n\n* Stocks edge lower on risk-off trade\n\n* Some investors waiting for Fed meeting\n\nBy Stanley White\n\nTOKYO, Sept 17 (Reuters) - Oil futures shed some of their\n\nmassive gains on Tuesday as the United States flagged the\n\npossible release of crude reserves, but the threat of military\n\naction over the attacks on Saudi oil facilities kept prices\n\nelevated and stocks under pressure.\n\nWhile equity market losses have not been large, the shaky\n\ninvestor confidence continues to support safe-haven assets, with\n\ngold edging higher on Tuesday and Treasury prices rising.\n\nInvestors otherwise broadly remain on the sidelines ahead of\n\nan expected rate cut from the U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday.\n\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan\n\nwas down 0.1%. Japanese stocks slid\n\n0.48%, while Australian shares were down 0.18%.\n\n\"There is certainly a risk-off tone, but I'm surprised the\n\nmarkets are not reacting more,\" said Tsutomu Soma, general\n\nmanager of fixed income business solutions at SBI Securities in\n\nTokyo.\n\n\"The U.S. and other countries have oil reserves, which helps\n\nsentiment in a case like this. You also have a lot of positions\n\nriding on the Fed meeting.\"\n\nBrent crude, the international benchmark, fell 1.2%\n\nto $68.18 per barrel in Asia on Tuesday. On Monday Brent surged\n\nby 14.6% for its biggest one-day percentage gain since at least\n\n1988.\n\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate futures were down 1.7%\n\nto $61.86 per barrel in Asia following a 14.7% surge on Monday,\n\nthe biggest one-day gain since December 2008.\n\nThe drone attack over the weekend has cut the kingdom's oil\n\nproduction in half, creating the biggest disruption to global\n\noil supplies in absolute terms since the overthrow of the\n\nIranian Shah in 1979, International Energy Agency data show.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has authorised the release of\n\nemergency crude stockpiles if needed, which could ease some\n\nupward pressure on crude futures, but risks to the outlook\n\nabound. Trump said on Monday it looked like Iran was behind the\n\nattacks but stressed that he did not want to go to war, which\n\nwas a slightly less bellicose tone than his initial reaction.\n\nIran has rejected U.S. charges that it was behind the\n\nattacks. Tension between the two countries were already running\n\nhigh over Iran's ambitions for nuclear weapons. The strikes in\n\nSaudi Arabia are likely to raise regional tensions even further.\n\nIn Asia on Tuesday, U.S. stock futures rose 0.05%,\n\nbut sentiment remained fragile. On Wall Street, the S&P 500\n\nended 0.31% lower.\n\nSpot gold traded a shade higher in Asia at $1,498.60\n\nan ounce following a 0.7% increase on Monday.\n\nThe yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes\n\nfell slightly to 1.8327%\n\nThe dollar was little changed at 108.17 yen JPY=EBS . Some\n\ntraders said it would be difficult to take big positions in the\n\ncurrency pair before the outcome of two important central bank\n\nmeetings this week.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates at a\n\npolicy meeting ending on Wednesday, which could put pressure on\n\nthe Bank of Japan to ease policy at a meeting the following day.\n\nTraders are also focused on the U.S.-Sino trade war.\n\nDeputy-level talks between the United States and China are\n\nscheduled to start in Washington on Thursday, paving the way for\n\nhigh-level talks next month aimed at resolving a bitter trade\n\nrow that has dragged on for more than a year. Any sign of progress to put an end to the trade war between\n\nthe world's two-largest economies could help improve risk\n\nsentiment, but negotiations have been fraught, making it\n\ndifficult to judge whether the two sides can narrow their\n\ndifferences.\n\n(Editing by Sam Holmes)", "description": "GLOBAL MARKETS-Oil trims gains but Middle East risks keep stocks on back foot", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEA6304Y_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
