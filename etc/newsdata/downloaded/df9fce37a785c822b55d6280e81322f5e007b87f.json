(Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Washington Wizards underwent a significant structural reboot this offseason, from the front office to the youthful roster that will be without John Wall indefinitely.\n\nDespite the upheaval, the franchise, according to first-year general manager Tommy Sheppard, has established the preliminary groundwork for how it plans to conduct business in the draft room and assess personnel as well as what it expects on and off the court from its players.\n\nIn an hour-long Q&A session at The Washington Post with reporters and editors Tuesday afternoon, Sheppard, Wizards Coach Scott Brooks and Sashi Brown, the first-year chief planning and operations officer for Monumental Basketball, offered their vision for a club that won just 32 games last season.\n\nSheppard called the refreshed outlook \u201cthe Wizards Way.\u201d\n\n[In rethinking the Wizards, Ted Leonsis blocked the noise and called Barack Obama (and 77 others)]\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re still evaluating the best way to express it, but we know what we don\u2019t want the Wizards Way to look like,\u201d Sheppard said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want players that don\u2019t want to be here. We don\u2019t want people to have contracts that far exceed what they produce result-wise. We don\u2019t want unhappy people that are going to cause disintegration in our locker room.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the way out. That\u2019s the Wizards\u2019 way out, so what we\u2019re trying to onboard now, talent, of course, but high character, hard-driven, value-driven people that we can back with data that have places in our locker room.\u201d\n\nThe Wizards added a litany of players, presumably who fit that blueprint, during the offseason but enter training camp, which begins next week, with an injury-diminished roster.\n\nMost recently, swingman Troy Brown Jr. strained his left calf during workouts Monday. Sheppard indicated Brown is expected to be out for up to a month, which means he could be available when Washington opens the regular season Oct. 23 in Dallas.\n\nThe 15th pick in the 2018 draft played 52 games last season, averaging 4.8 points, 2.8 rebounds and 1.5 assists.\n\nBrown\u2019s prolonged absence is one of three of the unforeseen variety, including Isaiah Thomas. The 5-foot-9 guard had surgery Sept. 18 to repair the radial collateral ligament in his left thumb, which Thomas injured during routine workouts two days earlier. Thomas, who signed with the Wizards in July, is forecast to miss six to eight weeks.\n\nAnother new piece, forward C.J. Miles, underwent surgery over the summer for a stress fracture in his left foot for an injury the team announced July 25. The prognosis for Miles to be out indefinitely.\n\nWall had surgery on his left Achilles\u2019 tendon in the spring, and Wizards managing partner Ted Leonsis said during a news conference in late July the five-time all-star probably would not play this season.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of new faces,\u201d Brooks said Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of new guys on our staff. I just finally today figured it all out, talked to all the coaches and figured, \u2018Okay, you\u2019re going to be working this guy; you\u2019re going to be with this coach.\u2019\n\n\u201cIt just goes down the line, even with the guys we brought in on the management side. It\u2019s been pretty seamless.\u201d\n\nBarring additional injuries, the Wizards are expected to begin the regular season with 10 new players after Sheppard, who had been interim general manager until Leonsis elevated him to the position full-time July 19, remade the roster.\n\nSheppard elected not to re-sign Tomas Satoransky, the primary backup to Wall, and he also let Jabari Parker and Bobby Portis depart. He dealt oft-injured center Dwight Howard for Miles and added Davis Bertans, Isaac Bonga, Jemerrio Jones and Moritz Wagner in trade. He signed Thomas and point guard Ish Smith.\n\nSheppard selected forward Rui Hachimura out of Gonzaga with the ninth pick in the draft, which he directed as interim GM, and added forward Admiral Schofield from Tennessee in the second round, 42nd overall.\n\nAfter the draft, Sheppard signed former Virginia Tech standout point guard Justin Robinson to a partially guaranteed contract. Robinson is the career leader in assists for the Hokies, who played in the NCAA tournament\u2019s regional semifinals at Capital One Arena.\n\n\u201cThe young players that we brought in, they\u2019re not one-and-done kids,\u201d Sheppard said. \u201cThere\u2019s guys, the four rookies that we have, Rui, Admiral, we added Justin Robinson, we added Garrison Mathews, they all played for great college coaches, great programs, three-year players minimum.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re rookies, but by pedigree they\u2019ve accomplished a great deal, so they\u2019re coming in the door, we\u2019re not starting remedial basketball. It\u2019s getting players who have been coached, and they can extend that knowledge out.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nScott Brooks and 4 other NBA coaches who could soon be on the hot seat\n\nTrump teases that he\u2019d like to visit India to watch an NBA game next month\n\nAfter free agency free-for-all, NBA implements stiffer tampering rules\n\nDoc Rivers talks Kawhi Leonard, Paul George and how the Clippers pulled off deal of the decade\n\nIn diverse Toronto, the Raptors\u2019 sports hijab is hailed as a win for inclusivity\n\nSign up for our weekly NBA newsletter to get the best basketball coverage in your inbox", "description": "With a remade front office and an overhauled roster, Washington's decision-makers say they are formulating a vision for longterm success.", "authors": ["Gene Wang", "Sports Reporter Covering Local", "National College Football", "September At Pm", "Gene Wang Is A Sports Reporter Covering Multiple Beats", "Including Virginia", "Virginia Tech Football", "Basketball", "The Wizards", "Boxing"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/LQnpZiby5C-EPbf2qBocvMdiCeU=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6DDGIHVYSUI6TM5UFO3J5DCOHE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
