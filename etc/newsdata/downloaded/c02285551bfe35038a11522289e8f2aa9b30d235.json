That would give the firm a market capitalisation of $6.27 billion to $6.74 billion, according to the term sheet.\n\nESR declined to comment.\n\nAt least seven existing shareholders are selling shares in the IPO, including Warburg Pincus, Goldman Sachs Investments Holdings (Asia) Ltd and e-commerce firm JD.com Inc\u2019s Jingdong Logistics Group Corp, the term sheet showed.\n\nESR has lined up $585 million from one cornerstone investor, OMERS Administration Corporation, one of Canada\u2019s largest pension funds, based on the mid-point of the price range, according to the term sheet.\n\nThe shares will be priced on Oct. 25 and trading is scheduled to start on Nov. 1.\n\nBudweiser Brewing Company APAC Ltd raised about $5 billion last month in Hong Kong, in the city\u2019s biggest and the world\u2019s second-largest IPO so far this year.\n\n($1 = 7.8413 Hong Kong dollars)", "description": "ESR Cayman Ltd, backed by private equity firm Warburg Pincus, relaunched its Hong Kong IPO that aims to raise as much as $1.45 billion after the logistics real estate developer shelved a float in June, a term sheet seen by Reuters showed.", "authors": ["Julie", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
