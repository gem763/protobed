Brady Press Briefing Room.\n\n\u201cUltimately, if the president decided it\u2019s something we should do, we can do that, but right now he\u2019s doing just fine and to be honest the briefings had become a lot of just theater,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that a lot of reporters were doing it to\u2026 get famous.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re writing books now, they\u2019re all getting famous off of this presidency, so I think it\u2019s great what we\u2019re doing now,\u201d Grisham added.\n\nKELLYANNE CONWAY EMBARRASSES CNN\u2019S JIM ACOSTA DURING HEATED EXCHANGE: 'YOU'RE SUCH A SMARTA--'\n\nGrisham didn\u2019t name names, but CNN White House reporter Jim Acosta has emerged as a household name for constantly sparring with members of the Trump administration when they are made available to the press.\n\nLast year, Acosta was briefly banned from the White House after he engaged in a contentious back-and-forth with Trump and refused to pass the microphone to a female White House aide. He has since written a book about his time covering Trump.\n\nCNN\u2019s April Ryan, another White House reporter, also scuffled with Spicer and Sanders on a regular basis and wrote a book about it. ABC News White House reporter Jonathan Karl has a book about covering the Trump White House scheduled for 2020.\n\nTRUMP SLAMS CNN\u2019S ACOSTA FOR PRESS CONFERENCE PERFORMANCE: \u2018YOU ARE A RUDE, TERRIBLE PERSON\u2019\n\n\u201cFox & Friends\u201d co-host Brian Kilmeade then asked how Trump reacted to the way Spicer and Sanders were treated by critics such as NBC\u2019s \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d which pokes fun at members of the administration with unflattering impersonations on a regular basis.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely, I think it\u2019s so important that the spokesperson for the president can adequately speak to his policies and get his message out there. I think the president saw that that\u2019s not what was happening,\" Grisham said. \"It had become, again, theater, and they weren\u2019t being good to his people. He doesn\u2019t like that. He\u2019s very loyal to his people, and he put a stop to it.\u201d", "description": "White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said there won\u2019t be traditional press briefings \u201cright now\u201d because grandstanding reporters used the event as an opportunity to \u201cget famous.\u201d", "authors": ["Brian Flood", "Brian Flood Covers The Media For Fox News.
