You saw Faf de Klerk do 15-20 box kicks against Wales, but we know that Pollard is an excellent kicker.\n\n\u201cThe way he goal-kicked was fantastic. He is smooth, has a nice touch on the ball and that\u2019s a wonderful advantage for them.\n\n\u201cWe know they can play differently and we\u2019re aware of that, but we also know that they are going to come through the front door.\n\n\u201cThere are not many Springbok teams that don\u2019t come through the front door, so we\u2019ve got to be ready at the front door and have enough cover at the back door too.\u201d\n\nJones is relishing the opportunity to take on the challenge of facing South Africa\u2019s physicality having watched their power against Wales.\n\n\u201cIt was a tough old game against Wales. It was interesting \u2013 both the coaches and captains said they anticipated the game to be an arm wrestle and it was,\u201d Jones added.\n\n\u201cIt was a tough, exacting semi-final. That\u2019s what you expect at the World Cup and we are looking forward to playing against South Africa now.\n\n\u201cThe only thing we are really worried about is how the Springboks turn up on Saturday.\n\n\u201cThey won a tough semi-final and when you are in the final of a World Cup, you have done a lot of things right.\n\n\u201cThey have a massively aggressive physical forward pack and they probably played their stronger team in the second half as opposed to the first.\n\n\u201cThey are going to be a difficult side to beat but we know a couple of areas that we think we can expose in them and we\u2019ll make sure we are well-prepared in those areas.\u201d\n\nEngland were dominant against the All Blacks (Adam Davy/PA)\n\nEngland produced possibly the finest victory in their rugby history by dispatching New Zealand 19-7 but Jones is adamant there is still more to come.\n\n\u201cWe played a great team in New Zealand but we don\u2019t feel we\u2019ve played as well as we can and the challenge for us is to keep improving,\u201d Jones said.\n\n\u201cAnd there are small margins now. As you go through the tournament, the margins get smaller.\n\n\u201cThe improvements you can make are still significant so we\u2019re looking to see how we can keep improving for this week\u2019s game and that\u2019s the exciting part for us.\u201d", "description": "The England head coach knows South Africa are capable of playing in a variety of styles.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/13/wire-20279770-1572267864-868_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
