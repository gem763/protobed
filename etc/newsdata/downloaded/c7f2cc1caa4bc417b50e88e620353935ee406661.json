Housing construction for troops and families on bases is being held harmless in the fund diversion, the Pentagon said.\n\nThe department has also deferred various projects tied to training and readiness for troops themselves, according to the New York Times. A pistol range in Oklahoma, a cyber-defense facility in Virginia, various unspecified flight simulators, scheduled repairs at ports, and firing range facilities will all be mothballed to build the fencing, according to the Times.\n\nA total of $3.6 billion in already-appropriated DOD funds is being shifted to Trump\u2019s fencing projects, according to a department letter reported Tuesday by The Daily Beast. The word \u201cwall\u201d appears zero times in the letter, the site noted, but it lists locations and structural details for 140 total miles of new fence. Much of that length will replace or augment existing structures.\n\nMore than a third of the total cost and mileage goes to the 52 miles of Rio Grande riverfront stretching north from Laredo, Texas. The bulk of the other projects, however, either replace existing pedestrian and vehicle barriers with newer versions, or add additional layers to existing fence lines.\n\nMuch of the U.S.-Mexico border is already fenced from previous administrations\u2019 own lower-profile efforts at enhancing security. Those projects have left scars in border communities, where property owners subjected to eminent domain frequently received low-ball compensation offers and misleading pitches about how the new barriers would affect their ability to utilize the land they still own after the feds are done building.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLawsuits and massive settlements followed those prior waves of construction, adding to the up-front cost of the projects. The big takeaway from government reviews of what had gone wrong was that rushing into these sorts of projects creates preventable waste and generates violations of landowners\u2019 rights.\n\nWhen the people done wrong by hurried government appraisers and lawyers are rich, they can afford to sue and hold out for something approximating just compensation. It\u2019s the little guys \u2014 families living on modest tracts, and medium-large ranching and agricultural operations that look rich on paper but actually trade in razor-fine profit margins \u2014 who end up screwed for good.\n\nPart of the problem for such people, as South Texas locals told ThinkProgress in the spring, is that the engineers who design the fences often don\u2019t want to cling tightly to the river itself.\n\nNorie Garza has been building a small vacation home on seven riverfront acres for most of the past decade. In 2018, the feds showed up to let her know that new fencing would be coming in behind her land. The engineers were sympathetic, she said, but still shoved legal papers on her.\n\n\u201cBasically you sign it or you spend thousands of dollars [fighting] and at the end of the day you still have to allow them to come in,\u201d she said.\n\nSugarcane farmer and rancher Sam Sparks III broadly supports the idea of cracking down on drug traffickers in his area, but said the idea you can both secure those areas and keep them productive for the families who\u2019ve invested years of sweat and millions of dollars into them is a fiction.\n\nThe engineers offer to put in security gates and distribute passcodes so people like Sparks \u2014 who had about half his family\u2019s 2,000-acre holdings cut off by fencing \u2014 can prevent their southern acreage turning fallow. But that\u2019s no solution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c[Traffickers] are gonna target those people that have that code, without a doubt,\u201d Sparks said. Even if he were the type to arm himself and keep working acreage the fencing might isolate, he said, he\u2019d never be able to hire workers to do it with him.\n\n\u201cWhen you stretch a wall across that property, then for sure nobody will want to work down there in that 900 acres, because then you\u2019re trapped. If you get in danger, there\u2019s no getting away,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need the protection. We\u2019ve gotta stop this, because it\u2019s gotten out of hand. But at the same time, what are we willing to sacrifice in the name of doing so?\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1165952258.jpg?w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
