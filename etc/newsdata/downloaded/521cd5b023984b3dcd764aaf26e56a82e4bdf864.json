Long-term champion, This Morning presenter Holly Willoughby, was thrilled to be back at Pride of Britain again.\n\n\u201cThis is one of my favourite nights of the year,\u201d she smiled.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so good to sit back and wallow in the awe of so many people doing such incredibly brave things. I\u2019ve worn waterproof mascara, so I\u2019m ready for it!\u201d\n\nX Factor host Dermot O\u2019Leary, honoured to be one of the Pride of Britain judges, joked that the reason stars attend is because the event is like a big, comforting bowl of \u201chuman chicken noodle soup\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a great night for humanity,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much humility here, which is great with where we are as a country at the moment. It\u2019s very nurturing and heartwarming.\u201d\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n(Image: Doug Peters/EMPICS Entertainment)\n\n(Image: Doug Peters/EMPICS Entertainment)\n\nStrictly Come Dancing judge Shirley Ballas, attending with her mum, said the poignant night gives her inspiration each year.\n\n\u201cEvents like this truly bring the country together as a whole,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is one of my favourite award ceremonies and it\u2019s always very inspirational.\n\n\u201cThe bravery I see carries me through for several months,\u201d she added.\n\nFellow judge Motsi Mabuse was overwhelmed to be attending the ceremony for the first time.\n\nIt was her very first red carpet event in the UK since arriving here to join the Strictly panel. \u201cI just think it\u2019s so important to celebrate these people. I love that everyone here is celebrating this tonight,\u201d she beamed. For one showbiz couple, the event means the world for personal reasons too.\n\nFrank and Christine Lampard, who also joined the judging panel this year, met as at the event 10 years ago. And they are drawn back each year because of the inspiration the winners bring them.\n\nLoose Women host Christine said: \u201cYou\u2019re reminded there are good people in the world, and that\u2019s important, especially at the moment.\u201d\n\n(Image: David Fisher/REX)\n\n(Image: David Fisher/REX)\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nChelsea manager Frank added: \u201cWe met here 10 years ago, so it\u2019s always special night for us. But more important, it the inspiration of the evening and the awards given out for incredible reasons.\u201d\n\nThis Morning host Phillip Schofield agreed that inspiration is unrivalled. \u201cYou hear all these incredible stories which you wouldn\u2019t if it wasn\u2019t for Pride of Britain,\u201d he said.\n\nAs the stars flocked inside, they all admitted they were preparing for an \u201cemotional roller coaster\u201d of an evening. Amanda Holden made it, despite recently breaking her leg.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about ordinary people doing extraordinary things,\u201d she said. Fresh from her stint on the Strictly dance floor, Treasure Hunt legend Anneka Rice laughed she had definitely come prepared. \u201cEveryone cries, so I made sure I packed my tissues,\u201d she grinned. \u201cPride of Britain is so important because it brings the UK together.\u201d\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nSpandau Ballet bassist Martin Kemp and wife Shirlie, formerly of Pepsi & Shirlie, were delighted to return to the event for the second time. But they admitted they had not been quite as organised as Anneka. Martin said: \u201cIt\u2019s the most emotional roller coaster.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve just had to run to the bathroom to get tissues because I\u2019ve remembered how sad and humbling it is. These are incredible people who have done incredible things.\u201d Shirlie giggled: \u201cHe\u2019s wearing my waterproof mascara.\u201d\n\nStrictly contestant Michelle Visage agreed it was definitely called for. \u201cI\u2019m expecting to be sobbing. I\u2019ve forgotten to wear run-proof make-up.\u201d she said. Attending the event for the 10th time, Loose Woman Linda Robson said she was also unprepared. \u201cI know I\u2019m going to blub,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve forgotten my tissues, so have to get some loo roll.\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n(Image: David Fisher/REX)\n\n(Image: Doug Peters/EMPICS Entertainment)\n\nFor many of the guests, Pride of Britain and the selflessness it advocates is especially important against the backdrop of political division and unrest across the country. Esther Rantzen said: \u201cPeople are braver, kinder, more generous, more compassionate than we sometimes think when we read the world headlines or look at the way nations treat each other.\n\n\u201cYou forget how great individuals can be and especially those the Daily Mirror celebrate. This night makes a huge difference.\u201d Presenter Davina McCall agreed, saying: \u201cIt makes a change from all the depressing thing we hear every day. Especially at the moment, we need something like this. It makes me want to be a better person.\u201d\n\nWhile fellow presenter Kate Garraway added: \u201cAt the moment there is a lot of fear, there\u2019s a lot of panic and division, and you go in there and realise there is a lot of good out there. I probably won\u2019t be able to keep together. If you\u2019re not moved by tonight, you\u2019re made of stone.\u201d", "description": "Everyone from Holly Willoughby to Janet Jackson presented awards to our everyday heroes", "authors": ["Emily Retter", "Image", "Andy Stenning Daily Mirror", "Daily Mirror", "Pa", "Doug Peters Empics Entertainment", "David Fisher Rex", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20745806.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_POB-Awards.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
