Lawton has recently been denied the right to cover Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s campaign by the Liberal Party. Last week he wrote about his experiences for the Washington Post:\n\nOn Sept. 22, I showed up to cover one of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s campaign stops in a Toronto suburb on the first day of what was to be a week-long assignment to cover the Liberal campaign. But I wasn\u2019t allowed to board the media bus that takes journalists from stop to stop. I was also barred from entering Trudeau\u2019s press conference. The reason the Liberals provided is that I wasn\u2019t \u201caccredited.\u201d This was news to me. I\u2019ve been accredited by the Canadian and British governments, by courts in Canada and the United Kingdom, and the Republican National Committee at various points in my career\u2026 The Liberals even had me removed by two police officers from a public rally \u2014for which I had registered and been given an admission wristband \u2014 in a stunning overreach that the Liberals apologized for a day later. At no point have the Liberals explained to me or anyone else what the standard for accreditation is. Just that I and my outlet, True North, don\u2019t meet it.\n\nThe situation became more serious last Friday when Lawton was told he would not be allowed to cover a debate between Justin Trudeau and Conservative leader Andrew Scheer. True North and another conservative group called Rebel Media (which was also denied the right to cover the debate) took the government to court today and won.\n\nA federal court judge says Rebel Media and the True North Centre for Public Policy have established that they would suffer \u201cirreparable harm\u201d if denied access to the English-language leaders\u2019 debate taking place in Gatineau, Que., tonight and the French-language debate later this week\u2026 True North said in the documents that the lack of \u201cmeaningful feedback\u201d and transparency in the process, combined with the absence of avenues to appeal, make the commission\u2019s decision arbitrary and unreasonable. It also alleged the decision amounts to \u201can attempt by the current government to censor and silence media outlets that have provided a platform for Canadians with views inconsistent with its mandate.\u201d\n\nLawton was tweeting about the case throughout the day and published this video after the win:\n\nTrue North and I took the federal government to court. We won. They lost. That means I have a debate to cover. I\u2019m on my way there now. pic.twitter.com/Qc42XxN9mH \u2014 Andrew Lawton (@AndrewLawton) October 7, 2019\n\nHe eventually made it inside:\n\nIt\u2019s real. I\u2019m inside the media room. A few kind words from fellow journalists about the victory. pic.twitter.com/Xuu5jMXZIJ \u2014 Andrew Lawton (@AndrewLawton) October 7, 2019\n\nThanks for the support, @reicurran! Look forward to hearing your analysis tonight. https://t.co/sYUqRwYTkb \u2014 Andrew Lawton (@AndrewLawton) October 7, 2019\n\nI guess the liberal party will have a harder time shutting him out from now on. As for Justin Trudeau, a new poll judged him both the \u201cmost elitist\u201d and the \u201cmost hypocritical.\u201d So his attempt to change the subject from blackface hasn\u2019t been completely successful.", "description": "\"We won.
