It is now 17 consecutive victories, as they close in on Manchester City's record of 18 successive wins from 2017. These two remarkable teams are redefining standards and not just for the Premier League era but for English football history.\n\nAnd just when it looked as though the triumphal procession had juddered to a halt, brought to a stop by a cussed Leicester side showing something of the doggedness they will need to be a top-four contender, they saved themselves at the last.\n\nWe were well into injury-time when a well-intentioned effort to track back by Marc Albrighton, who had been excellent since coming on at half-time, ended up costing his team. He won the ball but ended up taking it into his own penalty area where he lost it to Sadio Mane.\n\nAlbrighton, in his eagerness to make amends, attempted a tackle and clipped Mane's leg. Admittedly the striker fell with the drama you might expect from a player whose team is drinking in the last-chance saloon. But even with the tension of a VAR review, it was one of those marginal penalties which nevertheless seemed unlikely to be overturned.\n\nJames Milner's controversial injury-time penalty gave Liverpool a 2-1 win over Leicester at Anfield on Saturday\n\nMilner celebrates after scoring the winner against Leicester in stoppage time at Anfield on Saturday afternoon\n\nJames Maddison's 80th minute equaliser looked to have salvaged a late point for Leicester after a dogged display\n\nLiverpool had earlier taken the lead through Sadio Mane's cool finish one-on-one with Kasper Schmeichel on 40 minutes\n\n'I think he's made the most of the contact,' was how Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers described it and that was about right.\n\n'He's had a touch and gone over. It was a very soft penalty. I didn't think it was a clear and obvious penalty, that's for sure but when the ref gives it it's probably hard for the VAR to go against that.'\n\nStill, there was more to it than just an exaggerated fall. Mane had run non-stop all afternoon but had found the energy to complete this last press to harry Albrighton. Ultimately, it is that desire and tactical relentlessness which brings about results such as these. 'Absolutely exceptional,' said Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp. 'He was still there to make these decisive runs.'\n\nBrendan Rodgers greeted Jurgen Klopp warmly on his first return to Anfield since being sacked by Liverpool in 2015\n\nMane ran onto James Milner's wonderful curled pass and sped into the area before finishing well into the far corner\n\nMaddison had been quiet until he collected Ayoze Perez's deft pass and whipped his shot underneath Adrian to make it 1-1\n\nRodgers celebrated what he thought was a hard earned point but late drama was to follow in injury time at Anfield\n\nThat said, there was still the mighty Kasper Schmeichel to beat. James Milner stepped up, extraordinarily cool and simply placed the penalty to his right. Anfield fairly erupted. It wasn't the style of the victory. In truth they dug this one out.\n\n'So far so good but 30 games to come,' was Klopp's summary. 'We're not fussed really by the situation, when people talk to us about the winning streak,' he insisted. But the final whistle told a different story.\n\nAndy Robertson celebrated so vigorously in the proximity of Ayoze Perez that the Spaniard had to be forcibly restrained and marched off the pitch by his team-mates. And Klopp was there, in front of The Kop, clenching his fist and orchestrating the roars. Every victory matters. But when you want to win a title, injury-time wins in a season in which you know every point will count suggest a direction of travel.\n\nFor Liverpool were made to work for this. Rodgers, on his return to Anfield, ensured as much. Was he too open when they might have won the league here back in 2014 and Jose Mourinho's Chelsea beat them? Not so, he insisted in the run up to this game. Yet this was an appropriately conservative performance that almost gleaned a point.\n\nLeicester had battled, held their own, engineered some half-chances and matched Liverpool in midfield. Caglar Soyuncu and Jonny Evans were impressive throughout. 'It was difficult to take,' said Rodgers of the denouement.\n\nReferee Chris Kavanagh awarded a penalty to Liverpool after Mane went down under pressure from Marc Albrighton\n\nMilner stayed calm and slotted his penalty home to continue Liverpool's run of 17 consecutive victories\n\nMATCH FACTS Liverpool (4-3-3): Adrian 6; Alexander-Arnold,7 Lovren 6, Van Dijk 7, Robrtson 7; Wijnaldum, 7 (Henderson 6.5, 78) Fabinho 7, Milner 7.5; Man\u00e9 8, Salah 7 (Lallana 90), Firmino 7 (Origi 78, 7) Subs: Kelleher, Keita, Gomez, Elliott Goals: Mane (40), Milner (90) Yellows: Fabinho Leicester (4-3-3); Schmiechel 8; Pereira, 7 Evans,7 Soyuncu,7.5 Chilwell 7; Praet,7 (Perez 73, 7) Ndidi,7 Tielemens 7; Barnes,6.5 (Albrighton 6, 45) Vardy,6 Maddison 7 (Choudhury 86) Subs: Ward, Justin, Morgan, Gray Goals: Maddison (80) Yellows: Evans, Soyuncu, Ndidi, Choudhury Referee: Chris Kavanagh\n\nYet it only takes a moment and a pass to undo a body of good work. It was the same on 41 minutes when Liverpool worked the ball across the back four to Robertson who nudged it on to Milner.\n\nThe pass that came looked almost routine but was a thing of great beauty. It curled around Evans. He wasn't badly positioned and he stretched a leg but he was tantalisingly a centimetre or two short of intercepting it. All the while Mane was sprinting across him, anticipating the fact that he wouldn't reach it. Mane gambled and won and was left streaking clear on goal and finished decisively.\n\nAfter half time Liverpool might have stridden confidently into a commanding lead. Schmeichel had to save from Mane on 47 minutes after Trent Alexander-Arnold played him in and then Mane's exchange with Mo Salah resulted in Evans blocking a shot on 56 minutes. Roberto Firmino turned neatly but shot wide on 65 minutes.\n\nWhat seemed like Leicester's main moment came on 66 minutes, Albrighton curling a pass around Liverpool's centre halves for Jamie Vardy to run on to. Yet Vardy took a heavy touch and in doing so invited Adrian out to smother and collect before he could get a clean strike on goal.\n\nKlopp celebrated the win with a typically passionate display in front of The Kop at the end of the game as Liverpool march on\n\nSeason at a glance Live tables\n\nFixtures\n\nScores Premier League\n\nPremier League\n\nChampionship\n\nLeague One\n\nLeague Two\n\nScottish Premiership\n\nScottish Div 1\n\nScottish Div 2\n\nScottish Div 3\n\nLigue 1\n\nSerie A\n\nLa Liga\n\nBundesliga\n\n\n\n\n\nIn reality, though, there was no surge of Leicester attacks. Just a determination about them and a refusal to lay down. And, in spells, some tidy football. As such, they remain a threat to almost anyone. Even this remarkable Liverpool team.\n\nSo a neat interchange of passes on 80 minutes saw Albrighton play in Perez, whose touch and pass found James Maddison running in, with Liverpool's defence static. Maddison hadn't, in truth, shown much of his creativity here but it would take more than a quiet afternoon at Anfield to dent his developed sense of self-belief.\n\nAnd the sight of The Kop looking down on his chance to score seemed unlikely to faze him: he struck his finish with the panache expected and celebrated with gusto. And if that was not to be decisive, Leicester had at least shown enough to be taken seriously as one of the best outside of those remarkable two teams bestriding this era.", "description": "ROB DRAPER AT ANFIELD: So the Liverpool juggernaut rolls on.
