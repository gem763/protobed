A test in 2014 killed one of the pilots.", "description": "Oct. 8 (UPI) \u2014 An exploratory division of U.S. aviation giant Boeing will make a $20 million investment for a stake in space tourism company Virgin", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
