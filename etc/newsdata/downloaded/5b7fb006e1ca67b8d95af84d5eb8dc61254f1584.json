The survey polled 2,096 Americans about their financial health, debt, and earnings for a new series, \"The State of Our Money.\" More than 670 respondents were millennials, defined as ages 23 to 38 in 2019.\n\nMore than half (51.5%) of millennial respondents have credit-card debt. And while nearly 68% have some or a lot of stress about it, around 30% have little to no stress at all (some respondents selected \"don't know/not applicable\").\n\nThat might be because most millennials with credit-card debt don't owe a lot. About 70% of those who have little stress about their credit-card debt owe less than $5,000. But 20% owe $5,000 to $10,000, almost 5% owe between $10,000 and $20,000, and 3% owe $30,000 to $40,000.\n\nIt's a somewhat similar picture for those who aren't stressed at all about their credit-card debt \u2014 83% owe less than $5,000. However, nearly 5% of this group of respondents each owe $5,000 to $10,000 and $10,000 to $20,000.\n\nPerhaps these unworried millennials are just confident they'll pay their debt off \u2014 64% of millennials who have credit-card debt have paid it all off at one point or another before.\n\nHow to pay off credit-card debt faster\n\nCredit-cards often have high interest rates, which can prolong your repayment schedule if you don't stay on top of it, Business Insider's Tanza Loudenback reported. Credit-card debt can damage your credit score, affecting long-term wealth creation.\n\nTo pay off your debt quickly, you can ask for a lower interest rate, double your minimum payment, or consolidate your balances into one so you can make a single monthly payment.\n\nYou can also take out a personal loan, which will give you quick access to cash to pay off your outstanding balance. It may seem counterintuitive, but personal-loan interest rates can be as low as 6% to 7%, compared to 17% to 24% on a credit card, Loudenback wrote.\n\nIf none of the above options appeal to you, consider the debt avalanche method: Paying off the most expensive debt first (the one with the highest interest rate) so you can save money on interest.", "description": "30% of millennials with credit-card debt have little to no stress about it.
