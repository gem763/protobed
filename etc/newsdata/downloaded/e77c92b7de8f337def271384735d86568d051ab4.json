Solving them all will cost $600 million to $700 million for the B61-12 bombs, and $125 million to $150 million for the sub-launched missile warheads.\n\nThe faulty capacitor is a commercial-grade part, said Charles Verdon, deputy administrator for defense programs at the Energy Department\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration, and some experts are worried that the U.S. is relying too much on the commercial marketplace in its nuclear weapons programs. About 70 percent of the parts in U.S. atomic weapons come from the commercial market, a major shift from the Cold War era, when most parts were made in government facilities, Verdon told Congress at a hearing Wednesday.\n\nLawmakers were not pleased to hear the cost of fixing the problem. \u201cIn rough figures, due to the effect of a failure in a component that costs less than $100, taxpayers will face charges on the order of close to $1 billion,\u201d said Rep. Jim Cooper (D-TN), chair of the Subcommittee on Strategic Forces.\n\nLike what you're reading?
