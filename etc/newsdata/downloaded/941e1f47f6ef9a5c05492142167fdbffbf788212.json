A deal that will please investors could be hard to get away. And while Johns\u2019 first two years in the job have been marred by a run of bad luck, the market now wants to see that she can deliver on her big promise: to lift Incitec\u2019s manufacturing performance.\n\nJohns believes Incitec is ready for its moment. \u201cIt's been a tough year, but I think the investors were able to see through that and say, yep, that's just a lot of one-offs, a lot of unusual things. But the underlying business and the underlying team are delivering.\u201d\n\nInvestors are certainly willing to forgive Johns for the things out of her control, such as gas prices, weather and movements in commodities. But Yarra Capital Management\u2019s managing director and head of Australian equities, Dion Hershan, says Incitec has a reputation for being accident prone, and is big on promises to improve the business.\n\nInvestors have been cheered by news that Incitec is considering spinning off the group\u2019s fertiliser arm. Greg McKenzie\n\n\u201cThe story has been for some time, \u2018Next year will be better\u2019,\u201d Hershan says, recalling the much vaunted but ultimately disappointing business excellence program (known internally as \u201cBEx\u201d) run by Johns\u2019 predecessor, James Fazzino. \u201cIt\u2019s all about execution now.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn at the deep end\n\nJohns hadn\u2019t even officially started as chief executive of Incitec when she was unceremoniously dumped in the deep end. It was November 14, 2017, and Johns had just finished only a few weeks of handover with the retiring Fazzino when she was wheeled out to present the company\u2019s annual results.\n\nShe didn\u2019t officially start her new role until the next day, but that didn\u2019t stop analysts peppering her with questions. What were her views on capital management? On Incitec\u2019s culture? On the company\u2019s technology compared with its big rival Orica?\n\nThe recording of the call suggests Johns handled the questions with good grace. Two years later, she insists she wasn\u2019t daunted by the baptism of fire.\n\n\u201cIt actually provided me an opportunity to hear some of their biases and some of their questions and concerns without feeling really defensive,\u201d she says of the investor call, adding that announcing a $300 million share buyback helped to keep the market sweet.\n\nAs it turned out, the annual numbers and accompanying buyback would prove to be something of a high point in Johns\u2019 reign to date. Within two months, Incitec had lost two long-term explosives contracts in Western Australia \u2013 BHP and Gina Rinehart\u2019s Roy Hill iron ore operation. This would lead to a $236 million write-down on the value of Dyno Nobel\u2019s Asia Pacific business, and force Johns to rethink the structure of the entire group. But even worse would come this year.\n\nIn January, Incitec announced problems at a new ammonia plant in Louisiana and an outage at its Phosphate Hill plant in Queensland, where a once-in-a-decade failure of a key component caused a leak in the phosphoric acid plant.\n\nThe devastating floods in north-west Queensland in early 2019 shut the rail line between Townsville and the Phosphate Hill plant for three months. Supplied\n\nA month later, the 100-year storm that lashed Queensland shut the rail line between Townsville and Phosphate Hill for three months, costing Incitec Pivot $10 million a week and about $100 million in total. In April, Johns told the market that drought had hit sales and wiped another $20 million off earnings before interest and tax.\n\nUBS analyst Nathan Reilly notes the latest earnings downgrade on September 2 \u2013 caused mainly by falling ammonia prices \u2013 was the sixth in 2018-19.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlant reliability focus\n\nIt\u2019s a run of bad luck that would knock the confidence of any CEO. But Johns is sanguine. \u201cI am actually reasonably calm in a crisis and that\u2019s really helpful, because the organisation feeds off the emotions of the leader,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I love a good challenge, so there certainly has been no shortage of that.\u201d\n\nJohns hopes the issues of the past two years are largely behind the group. The rail line in Queensland is back up, and the plant outages are largely sorted.\n\nJohns is aiming to lift manufacturing plant reliability from a baseline of 85 per cent to 95 per cent over the next three years, which she says will deliver between $40 million and $50 million in extra earnings before interest and tax.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, given the possible split from the fertiliser business, Dyno Nobel has partly filled the hole left by those lost contracts, with sales of its state-of-the-art blasting technology \u2013 known as Delta E \u2013 and its electronic detonation technology both growing strongly.\n\nInvestors, who have watched Incitec shares track sideways for the best part of five years, are hungry for progress. The market is betting that operating earnings will rebound from $291 million in 2019 to $560 million in 2020, and Citi says a rate around $650 million is possible over the longer term.\n\nYarra Capital\u2019s Hershan says that if Johns does decide to sell fertilisers, it\u2019s crucial she receives a strong price for shareholders. \u201cWe often characterise these sorts of things as pain relief \u2013 a sale gets the problem off the table, but it\u2019s not always the best result for shareholders.\u201d\n\nHe also says Johns needs to deliver on her plant reliability promises. \u201cWhere they haven\u2019t had success is in plant reliability and forecasting,\u201d he says. \u201cSo the proof will be in the pudding from here.\u201d\n\nJohns\u2019 route to the top job at Incitec was born partly from what her husband describes as the only thing she\u2019s ever failed at: retirement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJohns grew up in Cleveland, Ohio, in a middle-class family with four kids. She describes her childhood as a product of the depressed US economy of the early 1980s: her father Frank, a maths professor, and her mother Carol, an HR manager, impressed on her the importance of education and self-sufficiency by explaining that they\u2019d pay for her to go to college, but after that the tap would be turned off.\n\nJohns in action for the Bearcats basketball team in 1985 during her time at Cincinnati University. Supplied\n\nJohns says she was great at maths and loved science, so the pragmatic influence of her parents pushed her towards engineering. She settled on chemical engineering at Cincinnati University. The experience would provide two things that would further define her.\n\nThe first was her competitive streak. At 183cm, Johns played centre for the Cincinnati University Bearcats basketball team. A signed picture of the current-day Bearcats team is stuck to the whiteboard in Johns\u2019 office, next to a photo of the Essendon Bombers AFL side torn from the Herald-Sun newspaper. Incitec\u2019s former chairman, Paul Brasher, got Johns barracking for the Bombers.\n\nOwing to work commitments, Johns, who lives in Melbourne\u2019s Southbank, has since traded team sports for weekend walks around The Tan, Melbourne\u2019s popular track around the Royal Botanic Gardens. Her husband, Marc, appears to have more time on his hands. \u201cHe\u2019s an avid golfer. That\u2019s his job,\u201d Johns laughs.\n\nThe couple have no children, but have several nieces and nephews, about half of whom have already been to visit.\n\nI remember [Jeanne] every time we have to optimise our use of cash across all of BHP. \u2014 Andrew Mackenzie, BHP CEO\n\nThe second thing Cincinnati University provided was a job, courtesy of an internship program the university ran with oil company Sohio. The firm would be acquired by BP soon after Johns joined.\n\nJohns had chosen Sohio because it had a plant in Cleveland. But over the next decade she found herself working in a range of roles throughout the US, and later in her first overseas posting, in London.\n\nBy 1999, Johns was running a refinery in Toledo, Ohio. \u201cAll of a sudden you had a big dangerous plant and hundreds of people reporting to you,\u201d Johns recalls. \u201cWhen you run a big site, you are the king of the mountain, and as far as anyone who works there, you have no boss.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJohns at BP's Toledo refinery in Oregon in 2001. She was only the third refinery manager in BP history. Supplied\n\nJohns\u2019 biggest role at BP was running the $12 billion natural gas liquids division between 2004 and 2008, based in Houston. Not only was the size of the division comparable to many Australian large-cap companies \u2013 Incitec\u2019s annual revenue is about $4 billion \u2013 the job also involved tricky corporate transactions, such as merging BP\u2019s natural gas unit with that of oil and chemical behemoth Amoco.\n\nBHP chief executive Andrew Mackenzie was a colleague of Johns\u2019 at BP, and remembers well her ability to navigate through one of the more difficult parts of life at any big resources company: deciding which projects will receive the capital to grow.\n\n\u201cOne of my memories of Jeanne is her leadership of capital prioritisation of minor projects across BP Chemicals in the early 2000s,\u201d Mackenzie says. \u201cShe had to lead several pushy senior people like me to give up expenditure for others, or for the shareholder, while protecting safety and asset integrity and returns. She did this with real tact and skill, and I remember this every time we have to optimise our use of cash across all of BHP.\u201d\n\nThe mix of operational expertise and strategic leadership skills that Johns developed at BP would lead to her most important role at the company. In 2011, she was handed the job of rebuilding BP\u2019s safety systems and processes following the Deepwater Horizon spill.\n\nJohns was given the task of devising new safety processes after BP's Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. AP\n\nThe size and impact of the April 2010 spill is still mind blowing. About 4.9 million barrels of oil spilt into the Gulf of Mexico over 87 days, polluting thousands of kilometres of coast. Eleven workers died in the explosion that caused the spill.\n\nThe impact on BP was dramatic. The world watched as the company botched a series of attempts to stop the spill, then winced as it tried to deal with the fallout, including when chief executive Tony Hayward told the media that he wanted to get his life back in the midst of the disaster. BP\u2019s total clean-up bill has been put at $US65 billion.\n\nJohns was running a BP joint venture in Shanghai when the call from London came. BP needed an executive with operational experience to help ensure Deepwater Horizon didn\u2019t happen again.\n\nI could tell that we didn\u2019t have world-class processes. \u2014 Jeanne Johns, Incitec Pivot CEO\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was one of the first interesting insights, that people with operating experience hadn\u2019t risen to the senior parts of the organisation,\u201d Johns says. \u201cThey had tended to be more financial and strategic leaders, not operational leaders.\u201d\n\nJohns remembers it as a stressful and challenging time. A central problem was a lack of direction \u2013 she had to call on whatever resources she needed, but no one in BP knew quite what she should do, or how she should do it. \u201cYou had to start from nothing and build the organisation.\u201d\n\nThe framework she developed would be familiar to many risk practitioners today. Johns started with BP\u2019s purpose around safety then moved into designing processes and systems around risk matrices, risk controls, and delegations of authority around specific risks.\n\nA key lesson from the Deepwater disaster was that the most destructive risks lay\n\nin events with the lowest probability of occurring. \u201cIt\u2019s not like nobody thought you couldn\u2019t have a blowout in the deep water. It\u2019s just that everybody thought the controls in place were strong enough to prevent it from happening. They basically said it was impossible.\u201d\n\nThat lesson was reinforced at Incitec, with the once-in-100-year rain that washed out the rail line in Queensland in January. Before the flood, Incitec\u2019s scenario planning had estimated the worst case was that the line could be out for three weeks. The shutdown lasted three months.\n\nJohns says she was able to apply the same principles from BP to this Incitec example. \u201cObviously, we\u2019ve since looked at how to mitigate so if we have another 100-year flood next year, it\u2019s not going to cost as much.\u201d\n\nMore broadly, she was pleased that much of the risk work she did at BP was already embedded in Incitec\u2019s processes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny because you think 'Gosh, I remember being part of inventing all that language, all those processes that Incitec Pivot, like many other companies, have actually picked up as standard practice\u2019.\u201d\n\n'I missed being more actively engaged'\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Johns retired from BP at the end of December 2015, the global giant\u2019s chief executive, Bob Dudley, advised her to take a year off and not to rush into any new roles.\n\nShe eventually joined the boards of the $6 billion British-headquartered food company Tate & Lyle and the $5.3 billion American engineering group Parsons Corporation. They were the sort of non-executive directorships that spoke nicely to Johns\u2019 global experience. But she couldn\u2019t stop answering inquiries from head hunters. \u201cI really missed being more actively engaged, really delivering,\u201d she says.\n\nShe dismissed many potential executive roles as being too similar to what she had left behind at BP. But the Incitec job description was intriguing. For starters it was in Australia, a country she had visited but never lived in. It spoke to her experience in commodities, in global marketing and in business-to-business sales. But most of all, it spoke to her operational experience in manufacturing.\n\nAt its heart, Incitec is a manufacturing business, turning the same basic product \u2013 ammonium nitrate \u2013 into explosives, fertilisers and industrial chemicals at plants around the world. The company was born out of Orica\u2019s Industrial Chemical business in 2003, and five years later moved into explosives with the acquisition of Dyno Nobel.\n\nBut Johns\u2019 initial assessment of Incitec\u2019s manufacturing capabilities was blunt: \u201cI could tell that we didn\u2019t have world-class processes.\u201d\n\nOne of the big problems was poor plant reliability. Johns twigged to the reason when her inbox revealed something she\u2019d never seen in her career: emails announcing when a plant had hit a new record for daily production.\n\nJohns investigated further and found that some teams within plants were being given incentives to hit production records, so workers were pushing equipment too hard, too often. Ammonia plants are tricky, and once something goes wrong, fixing the problem then ramping back up to full production is not a straightforward process.\n\nTo lift plant reliability, Johns has set new incentives for operational executives and staff. She says manufacturing workers have quickly understood their job is \u201cto keep this plant running all the time\u201d.\n\n\"I think it's time to do something to make gas prices come down,\" Johns says. James Davies\n\nBut she concedes that driving change inside Incitec hasn\u2019t been simple. Having worked in a variety of countries and cultures, Johns says what\u2019s struck her about Australia is an occasional passive-aggressive resistance that can be hard to break through.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a certain apparent politeness that could mean absolutely nothing,\u201d Johns says. \u201cJust because someone is listening politely does not mean they are in agreement.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a sentiment that could also describe Johns\u2019 dealings with the gas industry. Her exasperation with the sky-high prices in Australia is exacerbated by the precarious position of the Gibson Island fertiliser plant in Queensland, which has been struggling for years to secure reasonably priced gas.\n\nGiven her familiarity with the US oil and gas sector, where fracking has created an abundance of supply and pushed prices down, Johns struggles to understand why a country with as much gas as Australia cannot deliver reliable and cheap supply to industry. The answer, of course, is that so much gas is being exported via Queensland\u2019s giant liquefied natural gas projects. But that\u2019s cold comfort to industrial groups such as Incitec.\n\n\u201cI have no problems with exports,\u201d Johns says. \u201cI think it\u2019s great to export excess gas. But no manufacturing industry that can move is going to set up shop in a place where you can\u2019t rely on an energy market that\u2019s predictable.\u201d\n\nGibson Island\u2019s future has been assured until 2022 thanks, ironically, to a deal with a big gas exporter \u2013 the Australia Pacific LNG joint venture.\n\nBut Johns didn\u2019t get her deal without some angst. Last year the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association accused Incitec of deliberately setting unrealistic terms in its recent tender for Gibson Island gas supply to force the federal government to intervene and restrict LNG exports under the Australian Domestic Gas Security Mechanism (ADGSM).\n\nThe hardball tactics ruffled a few feathers, but Johns\u2019 exasperation has only grown. The government has recently asked for feedback on the annual ADGSM decision, and Johns\u2019 position is clear.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s time to do something to make gas prices come down, and I haven\u2019t seen another proposal that will do that,\u201d she says of the ADGSM. \u201cThat\u2019s the only proposal I\u2019ve seen that will bring down gas prices, to where they\u2019re competitive with the rest of the world.\u201d\n\nWhile Johns finds a passive-aggressive attitude is unique to Australian business culture, she says the willingness of people \u2013 including her own staff \u2013 to open up to her is startling. She puts it partly down to gender: \u201cBecause people tend to see you as CEO and a woman, they tend to say things to you.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe candidness is a blessing and a curse. Johns says she\u2019s often taken aback by things she would never have said to her own bosses, but at the same time, unfiltered thoughts can be hugely useful. \u201cOne of the biggest challenges is that the higher you go in an organisation, the less likely you are to get honest feedback.\u201d\n\nAs one of Australia\u2019s few female chief executives, and the former head of BP WIN (Women\u2019s International Network), Johns says her focus is on making a sustainable difference on gender. At Incitec she\u2019s focused on making a wider range of roles work for women, not just in the executive ranks.\n\nShe is particularly proud of a change at BHP\u2019s Blackwater coal mine in Queensland, where Incitec was able to work with the mining giant to tweak the timing of a shift so mothers could get home for their school-aged children. \u201cIt\u2019s about how you make it stick,\u201d Johns says.\n\nAnother deal with BHP signed in September provides a good pointer to the direction Johns wants to take the company. Under the five-year arrangement, Dyno Nobel will invest $25 million into technology developments that will bolster BHP\u2019s mining operations.\n\nThe technology deal is part of a wider supply agreement with BHP, which Citi analyst Daniel Kang says underpins Johns\u2019 plans to increase production at Incitec\u2019s Moranbah ammonium nitrate plant by 15 per cent by 2022. Kang estimates that could add another $15 million to $20 million to EBIT by that date.\n\nBut the technology agreement has two other benefits. First, it\u2019s a way for Johns to get access to a real-world testing group for its new products, which is not always easy to do. Second, it provides a mechanism by which she can share the cost savings generated by technology such as Delta E and electronic detonation systems (EDS).\n\nDelta E technology promises safer, more accurate and more climate-friendly blasts. Instead of filling a blast hole with explosives, the operator places a chemically gassed emulsion that can be set at different densities, depending on the geological characteristics of the rocks or ground.\n\nBeing able to break different rocks in different ways can help reduce waste and lower a miner\u2019s processing costs by bringing the right-sized material to the processing end of the production chain. According to Incitec, better blasts also reduce carbon emissions by as much as 38 per cent, compared with conventional explosives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJohns at the MBA Blackwater mine in Queensland, where Incitec worked with BHP to tweak shift times so mothers could get home for their school-aged children. Supplied\n\nConverting Asia Pacific customers to these premium products is a big growth opportunity. Sales of premium emulsion \u2013 the core of Delta E \u2013 have risen at a compound annual average growth rate of 25 per cent over the past four years inside Dyno North America. In Australia, that growth rate is 16 per cent.\n\nJohns admits Incitec has struggled to demonstrate the strength of its technology, leading many to believe that Orica has moved ahead of it. But she feels the tide is turning. \u201cWe\u2019re not behind on technology. But we haven\u2019t been telling our story.\u201d\n\nCredit Suisse analyst Grant Saligari says Incitec has \u201cshowed enough to demonstrate the strong uptake of EDS and Delta E systems as well as the likely runway for growth\u201d.\n\nAs to the question of whether Incitec is ahead of Orica or behind, Saligari says it\u2019s not as important as the wider market dynamics of the explosives sector \u2013 an improving demand picture shared by a duopoly.\n\n\u201cWhile it is a natural tendency to ask whose technology is better, the main game is market structure, which we think is increasingly favourable for both Incitec and Orica.\u201d\n\nStill, the divestment of the fertiliser business should allow Johns to put the foot down on growth initiatives in the explosives business, including pushing into new geographic markets (Chile is the first cab off the rank in 2020) and investing more in technological development at the group\u2019s centre of excellence in Salt Lake City.\n\nIncitec's Delta E technology promises safer, more accurate and more climate-friendly blasts. Rick Wilking\n\nJohns stresses that the fertiliser review, which is being led by UBS\u2019s Melbourne point-man Kelvin Barry, may ultimately recommend the fertiliser business is retained, but she also says splitting the businesses will not be complicated because shared infrastructure is minimal.\n\nSaligari says the strategic opportunity provided by the potential spin-off \u201cseems straightforward\u201d.\n\n\u201cDivest the volatile and structurally weaker Australian fertiliser business and focus capital into well-positioned explosives businesses in duopoly market structures, throw a tightening supply and demand picture over the top, and a customer base looking increasingly for value- adding and consequent earnings growth from low capital expenditure opportunities.\u201d\n\nBut as Johns knows from her tumultuous two years in charge, nothing is ever straightforward at Incitec Pivot.", "description": "The CEO of the explosives and fertiliser company has had a turbulent first two years in the job.
