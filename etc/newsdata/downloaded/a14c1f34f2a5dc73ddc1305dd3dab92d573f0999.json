We're focused on restoring style, fit and value for our customers as we adapt to the changing way men want to dress today.'\n\nThe move comes as chief executive Steve Rowe fights to turn the high street giant around after profits fell from over \u00a31 billion in 2008 to \u00a3523m last year.\n\nIn September it tumbled out of the FTSE 100 list of Britain's biggest firms for the first time, and this month the company's stock fell to a 30-year low.\n\nRowe and his chairman Archie Norman, dubbed the 'turnaround king' for his work at Asda in the 1990s, have emphasised that returning M&S to profit growth is a 'marathon'.\n\nThe pair admitted this month that their plan to put the home and clothing departments back on track was 18 months behind schedule. M&S relaunched its largest sub-brand, Per Una, saying it wanted to throw out perceptions it was 'too frilly'.\n\nAt the same time it announced it would make a foray into 'influencer marketing', where a brand pays celebrities to feature M&S clothes on their social media profiles. The move is part of the retailer's plans to broaden its appeal to a younger customer, the company said at the time.\n\nThe struggles in the clothing department come at a time of turmoil in M&S management.\n\nBRAND NEW DIRECTION THE shake-up in the M&S men's clothing department is the work of Wes Taylor, a former brand director at Sir Philip Green's Burton label. Now menswear director at M&S, he is responsible for the clothes going on display in the autumn and winter collections, running everything from development to store layout. He is expected to tackle the perception that the company's menswear is old-fashioned and unexciting. The fashion veteran spent 18 years at Burton, part of Arcadia Group, before he walked out in 2017, claiming Green racially abused him several times. The case was settled out of court, and the retail tycoon continues to deny the allegations. Taylor started his career as a buyer at River Island in the late 1980s, then worked for Kangol and River Island-subsidiary Big Yellow Corporation. He joined Burton in 1999 as a buying director, becoming managing director in 2006.\n\nThree senior bosses \u2013 those in charge of clothing and home, and the company's supply chain and finances \u2013 have been ousted in recent months.\n\nAnd last week the retailer's incoming stores boss, David Lepley, changed his mind and turned down the job shortly before he was due to arrive.\n\nM&S also announced buy-now, pay-later options in a partnership with Clearpay, in a further bid to attract younger customers.\n\nThe service will be available to online shoppers spending more than \u00a330 from mid-November, allowing the balance to be paid back over six weeks.\n\nThe service is separate to M&S Bank, which is run as a joint venture with HSBC.", "description": "The high street stalwart is sidelining formal work clothes and targeting younger customers, who tend to dress down in the office.", "authors": ["Tom Witherow For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
