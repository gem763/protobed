HIMARS is a lighter, more mobile six-barreled version of the U.S. Army\u2019s M270 multiple rocket launch system (MLRS). It can shoot rockets out to 70 kilometers (43 miles) and GPS-guided ballistic missiles out to 300 kilometers (186 miles).\n\nHowever, funding from the cash-strapped Philippines is a hurdle. \u201cThe two sides have been unable to reach a deal because HIMARS could be too expensive for Manila given its tight defense budget,\u201d said the newspaper.\n\nExactly how much does HIMARS cost? Manufacturer Lockheed Martin refused to give cost estimates, instead referring queries to the U.S. Army\u2019s Aviation and Missile Command, which didn\u2019t respond to questions from TNI. The cost of HIMARS is split between the launcher itself and separate contracts for various munitions including guided and unguided rockets, the longer-range Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) missiles, and weapons under development such as extended-range rockets and the Precision Strike Missile.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "Hint: it involves these missiles.", "authors": ["Michael Peck"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/O6fBX1EaR7kxkrZmXS34qA--~B/aD05NTk7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/012050828d5a280bf0a46f1f33385830", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
