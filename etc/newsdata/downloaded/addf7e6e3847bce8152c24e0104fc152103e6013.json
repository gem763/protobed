It was enough to preserve Cardiff\u2019s unbeaten home record this season and rescue a point for Cardiff, which had seemed beyond them.\n\nBut Monk was left bemused by the officials after Aden Flint impeded the view of goalkeeper Cameron Dawson from an offside position as Tomlin struck.\n\n\u201cIf it had been a legitimate goal, fair enough, but I am told it wasn\u2019t even a foul for the free-kick,\u201d he said. \u201cThen, they had one of their players doing star jumps, trying to distract our keeper.\n\n\u201cHow they missed that, I don\u2019t know \u2013 because it\u2019s not hard to spot \u2013 a 6ft 5 inch player doing star jumps. But there we are \u2013 it is what it is.\u201d Harris \u2013 who was deemed surplus to Neil Warnock\u2019s requirements in the summer and left on a free transfer \u2013 was the provider for Wednesday\u2019s Borner. His driven 19th minute shot \u2013 turned in by the German Borner \u2013 was eventually cancelled out by Tomlin, something of a free-kick specialist himself.", "description": "Garry Monk believes the officials robbed his Sheffield Wednesday side of three points after Lee Tomlin\u2019s stunning free-kick halted their march to the automatic promotion places.", "authors": ["James Candy", "James Ducker", "Simon Briggs"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/18/TELEMMGLPICT000213434195-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqrd3v3Fu8bw5i_xl1zt2x3dqHBtPrhcx9ZCLXeNWJShw.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
