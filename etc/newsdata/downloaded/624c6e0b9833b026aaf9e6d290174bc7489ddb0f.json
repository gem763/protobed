On the band's new single, \"Lucy,\" the singer and guitarist leans into the darker side of what it means to give in to temptation.\n\nThe track's fuzzed-out guitars and sleek production are reminiscent of '90s-era Hole, not a coincidence given Allison's love for pop-rock and last year's release, Clean, which saw her moving away from a lo-fi aesthetic toward a heavier sound.\n\nBacked by the soft-then-loud dynamic of minor power chords, Allison swings back and forth between the beautiful and the macabre while singing about the curse of seduction. \"I can't help the feeling / That irks me - that I'm falling down / From heaven, through the earth to hellfire / To wear his crown.\" The result is a single that is brooding and universal.", "description": "On the band's new single, \"Lucy,\" singer Sophie Allison wrestles with the curse of temptation.", "authors": ["Zo\u00eb Jones"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/09/19/soccer-mommy-by-shervin-lainez_wide-9a8aa3c7dcda3e12534f9a67a14a154af407969c.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
