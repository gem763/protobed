BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images Trump made history when he became the first U.S. President to meet Kim at a summit in Singapore in 2018. He has since met him again at a second summit in Vietnam. Rodman said, theoretically, Trump would not listen to what he had to say about Kim.\n\n\"He wouldn't believe me anyways because Donald Trump is Donald Trump. You know, Donald Trump wants to be the man. He wants to be the man. He wants to be the first guy to do things and stuff like that, which he's not, you know, I met Kim Jong-Un before he did.\"\n\nKim rules over a totalitarian state with one of the world's worst human rights records and has been accused of executing political opponents, including his half-brother.\n\nRodman said his experiences with North Korean people were positive and that he wishes Americans could get a chance to go to the country and experience their culture.\n\n\"I just think people need to understand, it's like, if you took time out, if you can just visit and go hang out and you'll see the people in North Korea that they have certain ways,\" Rodman said. \"You have to adapt to it, but that's the culture and the way of life. It's different, but it's interesting to see.\"", "description": "Dennis Rodman said he still receives invites to return to North Korea, but President Donald Trump won't allow him to go.", "authors": ["Scott Davis"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d790d172e22af00774ffce8-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
