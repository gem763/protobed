Of the more than 12,300 medicines licensed in the U.K., about 7,000 arrive from or via the EU, mostly across the Channel.\n\nMeg Hillier, who chairs a committee overseeing the audit office, called the findings \u201cdeeply concerning.\u201d She said she had seen \u201ccountless examples\u201d of the British government missing deadlines, but that this one was particularly striking.\n\n\u201cIf the government gets this wrong, it could have the gravest of consequences,\u201d she said.\n\nAlan Boyd of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges said people with epilepsy were a particular concern in the event of any drug shortages, noting that \u201cone seizure can have a life-changing impact.\u201d Some surveys have also suggested there could be shortages of drugs to treat breast cancer, diabetes and heart failure.\n\nAccording to the British government\u2019s \u201creasonable worst-case\u201d scenario , the flow of goods could be cut by half on Day One of a no-deal Brexit and could take a year to recover. It said time was \u201cextremely limited\u201d if the shipping issues were to be resolved by the end of October.\n\n\u201cOne thing is clear about a no-deal Brexit and that is that no amount of preparation can fully eradicate the risks it presents to patient safety,\u201d said Donal O\u2019Donoghue of the Royal College of Physicians . \u201cIt is impossible for me and my colleagues to reassure patients that their health and care won\u2019t be negatively impacted by the U.K. leaving the EU without a deal.\u201d\n\nSteve Bates, CEO of U.K.\u2019 s Bioindustry Association , said that unlike the last Brexit deadline - March 31 - the government has given companies much less information about alternative routes in case a no-deal Brexit results in jammed ports.\n\n\u201cLast time, we knew which ferry services had been commissioned on alternative routes with pharmaceutical companies encouraged to book space to ship their products,\u201d he told reporters last week. \u201cBut the same approach has not been adopted this time.\u201d\n\nThe audit report also said there was \u201cincomplete information\u201d about the levels of medicine stockpiling but that levels were increasingly daily. As of Sept. 20, suppliers reported that 72% of medicines had a six-week stockpile.\n\n\u201cIn the event of a no-deal exit, the department (of health) would be working in a highly uncertain environment and operating all the elements of its plan would be a hugely demanding task,\u201d the watchdog wrote.\n\nBoyd said drug shortages already happen every month even without Brexit and the department of health typically issues a list of affected medicines and in some cases, suggests possible alternatives. He said the group was also concerned that a no-deal Brexit would mean that Britain would be kicked out of a Europe-wide program to identify counterfeit medicines.\n\n\u201cThe department of health will put its own system in place, but that will likely take a few years before it\u2019s up and running,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP\u2019s full coverage of Brexit and British politics at: https://www.apnews.com/Brexit\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Britain's government watchdog says there's still a \"significant amount\" of work to do to make sure the country has an adequate supply of licensed drugs in case of a no-deal Brexit.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Maria Cheng"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/27/brexit_medicines_53067_c8-0-2992-1740_s1770x1032.jpg?14fd96657d1eaad735c96bb143350e56e8d44747", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
