The Japanese\n\n10-year JGB yield rose 3 basis points to its one-month high of\n\nminus 0.200% JP10YTN=JBTC , while the Australian 10-year yield\n\nrose more than 5 basis points to a six-week high of 1.147%\n\nearlier on Wednesday.\n\nIn Europe, Germany's 30-year benchmark bond yield\n\nbriefly broke into positive territory on Tuesday for\n\nthe first time since Aug. 5.\n\nInvestors had bought bonds for many weeks on expectations\n\nthat the ECB will dole out stimulus, with a cut in interest\n\nrates of at least 10 basis points fully priced in.\n\nSome traders also expect more measures including a deeper\n\ninterest rate cut and a restart of its asset purchase programme.\n\nThe Fed is also widely expected to deliver an interest rate\n\ncut next week.\n\nGermany also signalled its readiness for relaxing its\n\nstaunch opposition to deficit spending to support the economy,\n\nleading to speculation Berlin could issue more debt, and curbing\n\nappetite for German bonds.\n\nFinance Minister Olaf Scholz said on Tuesday the country can\n\ncounter a possible economic crisis by injecting billions of\n\neuros into the economy. In the currency market, the dollar strengthened 0.2% to\n\n107.795 yen , its highest in six weeks.\n\nThe euro was little changed at $1.1047 , while the\n\nBritish pound stood at $1.2361 GBP=D4 , near its six-week high\n\nof $1.2385 hit earlier in the week.\n\nOil prices rose on Wednesday after an industry report showed\n\nthat crude stockpiles in the United States fell last week by\n\nmore than twice the amount that analysts had forecast. Prices\n\nhovered near their strongest in six weeks despite small losses\n\non Tuesday after U.S. President Donald Trump fired national\n\nsecurity adviser John Bolton. The departure of Bolton, who took a strident stance against\n\nIran, raised speculation of improvement in U.S.-Iran relations\n\nand an eventual return of Iranian crude exports to the market.\n\nStill, the market was underpinned by Saudi Arabia's new\n\nenergy minister's assurances of continued output cuts by the\n\nOrganization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.\n\nIn addition, geopolitical tensions in the Middle East are\n\nnowhere near subsiding after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin\n\nNetanyahu announced his intention to annex a large swathe of the\n\noccupied West Bank, a move condemned by Arab League foreign\n\nministers. Brent crude futures rose 0.6% to $62.76 a barrel\n\nwhile U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude gained\n\n0.7% to $57.80 per barrel.\n\n\n\n(Editing by Stephen Coates, Jacqueline Wong and Muralikumar\n\nAnantharaman)\n\n", "description": "GLOBAL MARKETS-Rising bond yields support value stocks ahead of central bank meetings", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/STOCK-EXCHANGE-RUSSIAN-TRADING-SYSTEMS_800x533_L_1414427815.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
