Ranitidine Effervescent Tablets 150 micrograms Ranitidine Effervescent Tablets 300 micrograms Zantac 150mg/10ml Syrup Zantac 50mg/2ml Injection Zantac 150mg Tablets Zantac 300mg Tablets\n\n'Currently, there is no evidence that medicines containing nitrosamines have caused any harm to patients, but the Agency is closely monitoring the situation, and working with other Regulatory Agencies around the world.'\n\nValisure's initial research found that NDMA was the result of the 'inherent instability' of the ranitidine molecule.\n\nIt claims that all versions of the drug are affected and could generate very high levels of NDMA in the human body.\n\nBut health officials in various countries instead suspect the fault comes from the manufacturing plant of the chemical in India.\n\nItalian health chiefs were the first to recall more than 500 drugs containing ranitidine made by Indian manufacturer Saraca Laboratories on September 20.\n\nThree days later the Irish equivalent to the MHRA - the Health Products Regulatory Authority - pulled 13 medications containing ranitidine, including seven versions of Zantac.\n\nCanada, India, France and Hong Kong all also pulled ranitidine medications from shelves last month.\n\nCVS, Walgreens, Walmart and Rite Aid in the US have all since recalled Zantac, as well as some generic versions of the medication.\n\nNHS figures show almost six million prescriptions were dished out for ranitidine in England last year.\n\nZantac is not the first medication to be recalled in the UK over fears it could contain NDMA.\n\nThe MHRA has pulled a series of heart drugs in the last year after tests revealed some batches contained NDMA or a similar chemical.\n\nSeveral medical studies have linked NDMA to colorectal, stomach, liver and kidney cancers in animals.
