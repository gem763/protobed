While Abdul Mahdi\u2019s fate was not yet clear, demonstrators said removing him would not be enough.\n\nAfter four weeks of protests in which more than 250 people have been killed, the past 24 hours saw the demonstrations swell to a previously unseen scale in the capital.\n\nMiddle class families with small children joined self-proclaimed \u201crevolutionary\u201d youths from poor neighborhoods to brave tear gas and barricades in Baghdad\u2019s Tahrir Square.\n\n\u201cNo Moqtada, no Hadi,\u201d protesters chanted, denouncing what they saw as an effort by the leaders of parliament\u2019s two largest blocs \u2014 populist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr and militia leader Hadi al-Amiri \u2014 to cling to power behind the scenes with or without the prime minister they installed a year ago.\n\nSadr has demanded Abdul Mahdi call an early election. When the premier refused, Sadr called on Amiri, his main political rival, to help oust him.\n\nAmiri issued a statement overnight that was initially seen as accepting Sadr\u2019s call to ditch Abdul Mahdi. But a day of silence followed, leaving the prime minister\u2019s fate in limbo.\n\n\u201cWe will work together to secure the interests of the Iraqi people and save the nation in accordance with the public good,\u201d Amiri had said in the overnight statement.\n\nMany young women and older people joined the protests as they gained momentum and appeared safer. The mood was jubilant yet defiant, with many singing and dancing and a group of young men even playing dominos, in contrast with the tense situation earlier this week when scores were killed nationwide.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Iraq\u2019s most powerful politicians appeared to withhold support for PM Adel Abdul Mahdi on Wednesday, as protests swelled into the biggest mass demonstrations", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Iraq-protest-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
