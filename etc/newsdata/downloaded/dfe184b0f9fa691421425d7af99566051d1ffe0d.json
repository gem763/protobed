As he\u2019s traveled the country over the last year, the secretary has made a point of engaging with local media (whose questions are generally friendlier) and, not coincidentally, the encounters have the potential to be more helpful to the political future Pompeo seems to be carving out for himself as Trump\u2019s heir apparent.\n\nDuring a spring swing through Iowa, he did four local radio interviews and more recently has been courting the local press in Kansas, his adopted home state, where he\u2019s keeping open the possibility of running for US Senate next year. Yet given this fall\u2019s momentous events\u2014much of which involves a budding impeachment inquiry for Pompeo\u2019s boss that has Pompeo himself in the middle of the scandal\u2014the local TV news interview was far more challenging. The secretary of state, all but visibly seething, muttered non sequiturs, repeated vacuous talking points, and at one point told Amons it sounded like she was working for the Democratic National Committee. In fact, she was doing journalism, trying to pry the truth from one of the administration\u2019s fiercest defenders.\n\nSUBSCRIBE Subscribe to WIRED and stay smart with more of your favorite longform writers.\n\nLast month, as news of a whistle-blower from the intelligence community began to circulate in Washington, it would have been hard to find someone in the Trump orbit whose political future seemed brighter than Mike Pompeo's. The 55-year-old former congressman from Kansas has deftly navigated the chaos atop the executive branch to position himself as the Trump administration\u2019s unicorn\u2014the almost mythic figure who has lasted inside the president\u2019s inner circle. This is, after all, a government where senior officials come and go sometimes by the week. But Pompeo actually earned a promotion along the way, moving from CIA director to secretary of state.\n\nNearly three years into the administration, Pompeo effectively is the last man standing, having outlasted and vanquished all rivals for Trump\u2019s ear on foreign policy, the president\u2019s tireless, give-no-quarter chief crusader, a political pugilist in a role normally reserved for thoughtful diplomacy, a happy warrior Trump dispatched to tongue-lash European allies over China and Huawei, to scold Iran over its nuclear ambitions, to glad-hand with North Korea, to boost Israel\u2019s Benjamin Netanyahu, to reassure Saudi Arabia that its relationship with the Trump administration would remain copacetic, despite the government\u2019s alleged killing of US resident and journalist Jamal Khashoggi, and to clean up with Denmark in the wake of Trump\u2019s aborted effort to purchase Greenland.\n\nPompeo learned along the way that there was only one way to survive under Trump: to be as enthusiastic about Trump as Trump himself. Or, as Pompeo summed up his daily job to me in one of our conversations, \u201cyou go execute and you do it with all the energy and heart and passion and integrity you can muster.\u201d Anything less, after all, and one might face the ignominious end of his predecessor, Rex Tillerson\u2014who was reportedly sitting on the toilet when he got a call informing him he was about to be fired by presidential tweet.
