Tourist Arrested For Wearing \u2018String\u2019 Bikini", "language": "en", "text": "A Taiwanese woman vacationing in Boracay beach in the Philippines has been fined for wearing a \u201cstring\u201d bikini. She was fined \u00a340 (about Rs 3,500) by authorities and was asked to respect the culture of the Philippines, which is more conservative.\n\nAs per a report a local news service, the hotel where the woman and her partner were staying had informed her that her attire was inappropriate. The tourist refused to apologise as she believed that her attire was a \u201cform of art\u201d. Even fellow tourists had complained, which led to the police going out and looking for her.\n\nSpeaking to the local news agency, Major Jess Baylon, the Malay Police Chief, said that the tourist was fined because her bikini was \u201cliterally just string\u201d. He also added, \"We have taken this action for other tourists not to follow. It was an eye-opener for resort owners to brief guests to dress appropriately.\u201d\n\nOfficials have also warned tourists to \"respect the country's culture and tradition.\"\n\nMany countries have dress codes\n\nMany countries, especially those that are theocratic Muslim states like the UAE, have modest dress codes for women and have rules for behaviour as well. Who can forget Samantha from Sex In The City (the second movie) being arrested for discreetly fondling a man in a restaurant and making out with him on a beach in Abu Dhabi?\n\nRecently, Meghan Markle wore a headscarf and a long dress while visiting a mosque in Cape Town, South Africa. She followed in the footsteps of her late mother-in-law Princess Diana who also wore a headscarf while she was in Pakistan and Kate Middleton who also covered her head while visiting a mosque in Malaysia. Each of them did it out of respect for tradition.\n\nThe question is, how far should people go when it comes to curbing their freedom in the name of \u201ctradition\u201d? In many ways, tradition is being used as an excuse to keep women at home and uneducated. Many times, women are made to cover up so that other men, other than their fathers and husbands, cannot look at them.\n\nThat\u2019s a question that needs to be answered according to the context. Are you a visitor to the country? Are you visiting a holy place of worship? Nobody has questioned removing their footwear and covering their heads while visiting the Golden Temple in Amritsar. That\u2019s because many understand that it is done out of respect for the holy place they are stepping into.\n\nAs for the Taiwanese woman who was fined for wearing a string bikini in the Philippines, she should consider visiting the topless and nude beaches in Southern Europe. Chances are, nobody will arrest her there.\n\n\n\n", "description": "A Taiwanese tourist in Boracay beach in the Philippines was arrested for wearing a \u2018string\u2019 bikini.
