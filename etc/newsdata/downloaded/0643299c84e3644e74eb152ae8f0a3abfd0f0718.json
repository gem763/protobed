The Washington Post first reported the development.\n\nThe decision to close the investigation comes weeks after a jury acquitted Greg Craig, a former Obama White House counsel who was charged with lying to the Justice Department about his own work with Manafort on behalf of the Ukrainian government in 2012.\n\nWeber and Podesta\u2019s lobbying for an obscure think tank called the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine first attracted scrutiny after the 2016 election, as prosecutors started looking into Paul Manafort\u2019s work in Ukraine.\n\nPOLITICO Influence Intelligence and analysis on lobbying \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

But Manafort and his deputy, Rick Gates, later admitted the think tank was really controlled by Viktor Yanukovych, the Ukrainian president at the time, and his political party.\n\nLobbyists for foreign governments and political parties are required by law to register as foreign agents, and Manafort was charged with breaking foreign lobbying law, among other crimes.\n\nThe scrutiny of the Podesta Group\u2019s Ukraine work helped bring down the firm, which collapsed under pressure in 2017 shortly after Manafort\u2019s arrest. (Mercury, in contrast, emerged relatively unscathed, although Weber resigned from the firm last month, saying he needed to spend his \u201ctime and energy on protecting\u201d his reputation.)\n\nBut Robert Mueller didn\u2019t charge Weber, Podesta or their firms, deeming it outside of his purview as special counsel. Instead, he handed the case off to the Southern District of New York.\n\nMercury has said it didn\u2019t register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act on the advice of its lawyers, and Gates admitted to lying to Mercury\u2019s law firm last year as part of his plea deal. Weber and Podesta both retroactively registered in 2017 as foreign agents.\n\n\u201cWe expected this outcome because we did the right thing from the start,\u201d Michael McKeon, a Mercury partner, said in a statement. \u201cAfter getting a long, hard look we came out clean because that\u2019s how we run our business. We are especially happy for Vin Weber, who deserves this clean bill of health.\u201d\n\n", "description": "The development brings to a close a case that helped to bring down one of K Street\u2019s most prominent lobbying firms.", "authors": ["Theodoric Meyer"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/b9/73/9dc34b8d491899f36cae792426ee/181107-k-street-gtty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
