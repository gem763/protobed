You\u2019ll feel like your short, six-month stay at a company might overshadow all your other professional accomplishments and spiral into an identity crisis.\n\nOn my resume, I have two jobs that I stayed at for less than six months (one was a layoff, so that\u2019s generally less difficult to explain). And while I\u2019ve mostly made it through job interviews without fielding questions about my short stays, it\u2019s almost always an awkward conversation to explain that I just didn\u2019t enjoy a role I took on. Is there a right way to explain a short stint on your resume?\n\nWell, that depends on your specific situation (and industry, too). According to Laura Mazzullo, a recruiter and owner of East Side Staffing, honesty goes a long way if you just weren\u2019t happy in your role. \u201cMost employers want authenticity,\u201d she said via email. \u201cThey want to understand a candidate\u2019s motivators and their main concern is, \u2018Will we be able to retain this individual? Will we offer them what they couldn\u2019t find somewhere else?\u2019 Understanding what didn\u2019t work for the candidate previously is helpful.\u201d\n\nUltimately, if you left because you were unhappy, she advises being truthful about it. If you aren\u2019t entirely honest, you might end up in another job you want out of immediately. Explain why it is you left and what you want out of your next role (without badmouthing your old job in the process).\n\nPerhaps your role\u2019s responsibilities shifted unexpectedly and no longer were relevant to your interests or goals and you\u2019re looking for something that more closely aligns with what you want to do next \u2014 the more personal/detailed, the better, so it sounds less like a canned-response. Over on the Cut, Allison Green of Ask A Manager provided an example of the sort of response you might provide.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the job turned out to be different than what I\u2019d expected. I was hired to create written content, but it turns out that they really need someone with a heavy focus on graphic design. It ended up being a very different role than the one I\u2019d originally signed on for.\u201d\n\nOf course, there are other explanations as to why you may have left a job early \u2014 like you left for personal reasons \u2014 in which case, you don\u2019t have to tell the entirety of the story; just explain what you\u2019re looking for in a prospective, new job. (Your interviewer will hopefully read between the lines.)\n\nIf you were fired for whatever reason, yes, that\u2019s trickier. \u201cFrankly, there\u2019s no right or wrong answer here,\u201d Mazzullo said. \u201cThe issue here is the bias of the employer. Will they automatically make the assumption this is a \u2018bad\u2019 employee? It\u2019s a real concern because many will think that. Again, I\u2019d encourage transparency and think about the result of the action. Did the candidate learn something from that experience? Most employers want to hear the full \u2018lesson learned\u2019 \u2014 not just \u2018I was fired.\u2019\u201d\n\nRegardless of why you left your job, in an interview, it\u2019s best to assure them that you\u2019re not specifically looking for another short-term gig. \u201cNo matter what you say, the important thing is to let them know your next step will be a long-term step,\u201d u/moonpuncher, a resume writer, said in a Reddit thread. \u201cLet them know you\u2019re interested in a company you can really grow with, that you\u2019ve decided your next step is a long-term one, and that you want to be very selective.\u201d\n\nAnd of course, if you have a resume with several short stints, consider it an opportunity to edit down your resume, particularly in situations where you may have lasted only a few weeks.", "description": "When a new job just isn\u2019t working out, you might be concerned about what quitting might mean for your resume and career.
