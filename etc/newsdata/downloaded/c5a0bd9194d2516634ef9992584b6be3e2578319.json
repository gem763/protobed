Media outlets have reported that Huckle was stabbed, but investigations are still ongoing.\n\nHis victims ranged in age from a 6-month-old baby to a 12-year-old child. He is believed to have committed the bulk of his offenses over a nine-year period in Malaysia, with the National Crime Agency also saying he committed child abuse in Cambodia.\n\nvia BBC video More\n\nOften grooming poor children from schools and orphanages in Kuala Lumpur, he later took pictures and videos of himself raping them, sharing the images in pedophile groups on the dark web.\n\nIn a blog that he kept, Huckle developed a system of \u201cPedopoints\u201d that he awarded himself, noting that he had abused 191 children on his \u201cscorecard.\u201d Investigators uncovered images where he forced his child victims to pose with signs that advertised his \u201cbusiness\u201d of abuse.\n\nHuckle had also circulated a 60-page guide he titled \u201cPedophiles & Poverty: Child Lover Guide.\u201d The UK judge who presided over the case called it a \u201ctruly evil document.\u201d\n\nvia BBC video More\n\nHis abuse began during a gap-year teaching in Southeast Asia. At his sentencing, Judge Peter Rook QC told him:\n\n\u201cYour offending behavior became entrenched in your everyday life. Your life revolved around your sexual activities with young children. Your distorted beliefs in respect of children are deep-seated. Your self-delusion knows no bounds.\u201d\n\nPolice finally arrested Huckle in 2014 at Gatwick Airport, after his return from Malaysia for Christmas. His capture followed a tip-off from Australian investigators who had recently shut down a website dedicated to pedophilia with over 9,000 members.\n\nRook said that Huckle\u2019s behavior seemed to be \u201cescalating,\u201d with the suspect planning on creating a \u201cpedo Wiki guide\u201d for his depraved followers.\n\nAt the time of his arrest, 20,000 thousand images of child abuse were found on Huckle\u2019s computer and camera, 1,000 of which were of him raping his victims. Refusing to cooperate with investigators, he declined to share passwords to encrypted files.\n\nFollowing his arrest, his family sold their home and sought anonymity. His sister-in-law was quoted by UK media outlet Sky News as saying: \u201cNone of his family will speak about him. None of us ever want to see Richard again.\u201d\n\nThis article, Prolific British pedophile Richard Huckle found dead in prison cell, originally appeared on Coconuts, Asia's leading alternative media company.
