Businesses view apprenticeships as a way to recruit skilled and loyal staff.\n\nThe figures have emerged ahead of the National Apprenticeship Awards, which aim to celebrate success stories and the range of options now available.\n\nThere are 74 nominees across nine categories for this year's awards, which have been running for 16 years.\n\nWinners, who are chosen by a judging panel and public vote, will be announced at a glitzy ceremony in London on November 27, as well as two highly-commended runners up for each award.\n\n'I didn't want to get into debt' Engineer Melissa Chigubu won a place at the Advanced Manufacturing Training Centre in Coventry When engineer Melissa Chigubu was deciding what to do after leaving school, her teachers were surprised that she didn't show an interest in university. The 19-year-old, who moved to the UK from Zimbabwe seven years ago, was bright and enjoyed mathematics. But she felt an apprenticeship was a better fit, partly because of how much she enjoyed working with her hands. She won a place at the Advanced Manufacturing Training Centre in Coventry and is in the third year of her course. 'I did consider going to university, but I didn't want to get into debt,' she says. 'With an apprenticeship I can get practical experience and there is a job for me at the end of it.' She earns \u00a315,000 per year, which will increase to \u00a324,000 once she completes her training.\n\nMatthew Turner, one of the finalists, works at Gemini Accident Repair Centre in Rotherham while studying for his apprenticeship at Nottingham College.\n\nThe 21-year-old is two years into the three-year scheme and earns about \u00a318,000 per year.\n\nHe said: 'It was a choice for me between university and an apprenticeship, so I weighed my options and went with an apprenticeship because I have always liked cars and worked well with my hands.\n\n'I got it and I have to say I'm absolutely loving it. I'm learning something new every day and it is something that I really enjoy doing.'\n\nMatthew Turner, 21, is two years into the three-year scheme and earns about \u00a318,000 per year\n\nDave Sargeant, managing director at Gemini, added: 'We are so pleased, and proud of Matthew and wish him lots of luck in the competition.'\n\nLloyds Banking Group is the sponsor of the 'rising star' category, which this year includes nominees from aerospace, pharmaceuticals, consultancy, banking, health and technology.\n\nThe bank itself takes on hundreds of apprentices per year, with about 7,900 recruited since 2012.\n\nDave Atkinson, UK head of manufacturing at Lloyds, said: 'It's taken time, but apprenticeship schemes are no longer viewed as a secondary route into work.\n\n'Our own schemes have increased overall staff engagement levels, supported our diversity agenda and led to cost savings of almost \u00a33million per annum.'\n\nLloyds sponsors the Advanced Manufacturing Technology Centre (AMTC) in Coventry, which plans to train 3,500 apprentices over ten years.\n\nExperts believe apprenticeships are a key way of improving the skills of the workforce and improving productivity.\n\nThe Chartered Management Institute advocates shorter more flexible apprenticeships so older workers and middle managers can also benefit.", "description": "More than a fifth of school-leavers say they intend to apply apprenticeships, according to jobs website Monster.
