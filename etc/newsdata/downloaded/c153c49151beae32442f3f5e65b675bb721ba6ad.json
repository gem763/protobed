Aston Villa defender Mings appeared to be the main target but there was also consistent booing of Raheem Sterling and Marcus Rashford.\n\nMings was heard telling the assistant referee: \u201cHey, did you hear that?\u201d, prompting manager Gareth Southgate to speak to the fourth official. As part of Uefa\u2019s strict anti-racism protocols, an announcement was then read out over the speaker system which urged home fans to cease or face the match being abandoned.\n\nThe message initially seemed to make little difference, with the chants clearly audible every time Mings touched the ball. Play was again halted just before half-time, although after consulting with his fourth official Bebek decided not to suspend play as dictated by the second stage of Uefa\u2019s protocols. At half-time the Bulgaria captain, Ivelin Popov, approached an area of the stands where the chants were coming from to plead for his supporters to stop. Many Bulgarian fans then chose to leave the stadium with their team already 4-0 down, although some of the chanting continued.\n\nEngland trounce Bulgaria 6-0 but forced into stoppages by racist chanting Read more\n\nTelevision pictures shown by broadcaster ITV at half-time showed some fans making Nazi salutes and wearing jumpers with the message \u201cUefa Mafia: No Respect\u201d. England officials are understood to have discussed the possibility of abandoning the game at the break with their Uefa counterparts, and were given permission to walk off if any more instances occurred. England went on to win the match 6-0.\n\n\u201cI was up in the stands with some of the FA staff. We were watching the game and heard some sounds that sounded like monkey chanting,\u201d said Clarke.\n\n\u201cI came down and heard more at the side of the pitch and I saw some activity from some people dressed in black that was appalling. We were told by the officials that 50 people had been thrown out at half-time. Some of the staff were visibly upset at the amount of abuse the squad were suffering.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI would like to see a very stringent review by Uefa because I know they take racism very seriously. If we say \u2018we\u2019ve got zero tolerance for racism\u2019, one person making monkey chanting noises is the same as 100. Zero tolerance is zero tolerance.\u201d\n\nThe buildup to the match had been dominated by the prospect of racism at a ground where England players were also abused during a qualifier in 2011. The Bulgarian football union president, Borislav Mihaylov, had urged Uefa to take action against England after Chelsea striker Tammy Abraham claimed that Southgate\u2019s side would walk off the pitch if they were on the receiving end of racist chanting, while manager Krasimir Balakov insisted English football has more of a problem with racism than Bulgaria in his pre-match press conference.\n\nUefa had already imposed sanctions after incidents during Bulgaria\u2019s matches against Kosovo and the Czech Republic in June, with 5,000 of the 46,340 seats at the stadium closed off as a punishment and instead covered with \u201cEqual Game\u201d banners. Yet despite only around 20,000 supporters \u2013 including an estimated 3,400 from England \u2013 inside the ground, it became the latest match featuring Southgate\u2019s side to be marred by racism after a similar incident in March when Montenegro was ordered to play their game against Kosovo in June behind closed doors.\n\n\u201cWe know it is an unacceptable situation,\u201d said the England manager. \u201cI think we have managed to make two statements by winning the game but also we have raised the awareness of everyone to this situation. The game was stopped twice and I know for some people that won\u2019t be enough but I think as a group we were on board with that process.\u201d\n\nMings was making his international debut but insisted he had not been put off by the constant barracking he received from the stands, including during the warm-up.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t affect my feelings,\u201d he said. \u201cI think I\u2019m quite lucky in that way because I don\u2019t feel like it is a personal assault. I feel sorry for the people who have those views. But I also have a duty to represent people that don\u2019t have a voice. It was important that it was bigger than me, bigger than what I felt.\u201d\n\nRashford was among several England players to express their disappointment on social media. The Manchester United forward also praised the away supporters for their reaction that included a song featuring the words: \u201cWho put the ball in the racists\u2019 net? Raheem Sterling\u201d.\n\n\u201cThankful to the brilliant England support,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cYou got behind us in the most meaningful way possible tonight and we are all very grateful. Also been told what the Bulgaria captain did at half-time. To stand alone and do the right thing takes courage and acts like that shouldn\u2019t go unnoticed.\u201d\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn added: \u201cSolidarity with the England players who faced appalling racism tonight. Uefa needs to do far more to tackle this kind of abuse.\u201d", "description": "England manager Gareth Southgate alerts Uefa officials to chanting by Bulgaria\u2019s home fans", "authors": ["Ed Aarons", "Dario Brentin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac4a372df782c697f390c2d8a287823f9a926b87/122_29_2658_1594/master/2658.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=99bb90ad2ddeffefb092f9daea31fcbf", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
