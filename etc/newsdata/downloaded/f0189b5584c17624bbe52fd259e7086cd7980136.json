Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n in New Mexico's 3rd Congressional District, though Plame doesn't specifically mention where she's running in the video, which features Plame at the wheel of a Chevy Camaro.\n\nIn the video, Plame is driving the Camaro backward down a dirt road as a metaphor for what she characterizes as the need to turn the country around, saying the CIA taught her to drive that way. Halfway through, Plame whips the wheel around into a reverse 180.\n\nLuj\u00e1n, who is assistant speaker and the highest-ranking Latino in the House, is vacating the seat to run for Senate. Plame will face a crowded field in the run for Luj\u00e1n's seat \u2014 over half a dozen Democrats are running \u2014 but her status as a nationally known figure could boost her chances.\n\nPlame was famously outed as a CIA agent during the Bush administration after her husband, the US diplomat Joseph C. Wilson IV, wrote an op-ed in The New York Times raising questions about the justifications for the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Plame's identity was revealed in a Washington Post article that cited unnamed administration officials.\n\nQuick facts on Plame and the scandal surrounding her:\n\nBefore being outed, Plame focused on weapons of mass destruction in her work for the CIA.\n\nThough no one has ever been explicitly prosecuted for the leak, Plame has long pointed her finger at the Bush administration and, in her video, specifically laid blame on former Vice President Dick Cheney's ex-chief of staff Scooter Libby.\n\nPlame and critics of the Bush administration believe her identity was leaked as punishment for Wilson's op-ed.\n\nLibby in 2007 was convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice in connection with a special prosecutor's investigation into the leak of Plame's identity.\n\nFormer President George W. Bush commuted Libby's sentence, which saved him from spending time behind bars, and President Donald Trump controversially pardoned him in April 2018.\n\nA number of reports have pointed to former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage as one of the officials who leaked Plame's identity.\n\nPlame, a staunch Trump critic, got into the scandal in her campaign-announcement video \u2014 attacking Cheney, Libby, and the president.\n\nAt the video's end, Plame stops the car and steps out onto the dusty road in slow motion. She stops in front of the camera and rips off her sunglasses.\n\n\"You've probably heard my name ... Mr. President, I've got a few scores to settle,\" she says.\n\nPlame's life was turned into a movie, but the spotlight hasn't always been positive.\n\nPlame's memoir on her experience of being outed as a CIA operative was turned into a film in 2010: \"Fair Game,\" starring Naomi Watts and Sean Penn.\n\nBetween the far-reaching consequences of the leak of her identity and the biopic with Hollywood stars, Plame has continued to garner attention over the years. But not all of it has been positive.\n\nRead more: CIA predicted the Iran crisis that spiraled out of Trump pulling the US from the 2015 nuclear deal\n\nIn September 2017, Plame apologized after tweeting an anti-Semitic article titled \"America's Jews Are Driving America's Wars.\" The article was from an alt-right website, The Unz Review.\n\nPlame apologized for sharing the article in a series of tweets, including one that mentioned she's of Jewish descent. Similarly, in her campaign-announcement video on Monday, Plame says she is a descendant of Ukrainian-Jewish immigrants.", "description": "The campaign video features Valerie Plame at the wheel of a Chevy Camaro racing down a dirt road backward, then she pulls off a stunt move.", "authors": ["John Haltiwanger"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d767d262e22af1bc01b3875-1536-768.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
