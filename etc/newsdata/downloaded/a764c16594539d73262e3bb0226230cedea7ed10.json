Adam Schiff, one of the most underhanded, dishonest Congressional members in modern history, would stoop to such levels.\n\nThis relates to Kurt Volker\u2019s testimony, which turned out to be a major dud for Schiff and his gang. While Volker, being a former John McCain staffer, was expected to come in and fillet Trump, it turned out that he didn\u2019t have much to add to the impeachment fury. Trump, for whatever problems one might have with him talking about Biden in the first place, simply didn\u2019t engage in a quid pro quo, threaten aid, or pressure the Ukrainians.\n\nAs I wrote at the time, it was reported that Schiff got so frustrated with how things were going that he sidelined his MSNBC lawyer to question Volker himself. Now, we know why he did that and we\u2019ve got the transcript to illustrate what happened.\n\nBREAKING: In a secret interview, Democrat Rep. Adam Schiff pressured former U.S. special representative to Ukraine Kurt Volker to testify that Ukrainian officials felt pressured by Trump to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter https://t.co/nzZBILnTpy \u2014 Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) October 16, 2019\n\nThis per the Washington Examiner.\n\nDemocrat House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff reportedly pressed U.S. special representative to Ukraine Kurt Volker in a secret meeting on October 3 to say that President Donald Trump pressured Ukrainian officials to investigate former Vice President and current Democrat presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden. \u201cVolker denied that was the case, noting that Ukrainian leaders did not even know the aid was being withheld, and that they believed their relationship with the United States was moving along satisfactorily, without them having done anything Trump mentioned in his notorious July 25 phone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky,\u201d The Washington Examiner \u201cWhen Volker repeatedly declined to agree to Schiff\u2019s characterization of events, Schiff said, \u2018Ambassador, you\u2019re making this much more complicated than it has to be.\u2019\u201d and that they believed their relationship with the United States was moving along satisfactorily, without them having done anything Trump mentioned in his notorious July 25 phone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky,\u201d The Washington Examiner reported\n\nFor someone who likes to mock the President for supposedly sounding like a mob boss, that last line sound rather mob bossy to me. Schiff wasn\u2019t getting the answer he wanted so he lashed out and berated the witness. Seems normal, right?\n\nHere\u2019s the rest of the exchange in question, where you can see Schiff continuing to press him to say something he clearly doesn\u2019t think is actually true.\n\n[Schiff] asked Volker whether he would agree that \u201cno President of the United States should ever ask a foreign leader to help intervene in a U.S. election.\u201d \u201cI agree with that,\u201d said Volker. \u201cAnd that would be particularly egregious if it was done in the context of withholding foreign assistance?\u201d Schiff continued. Volker balked. \u201cWe\u2019re getting now into, you know, a conflation of these things that I didn\u2019t think was actually there.\u201d Schiff wanted Volker to agree that \u201cif it\u2019s inappropriate for a president to seek foreign help in a U.S. election, it would be doubly so if a president was doing that at a time when the United States was withholding military support from the country.\u201d Again, Volker did not agree. \u201cI can\u2019t really speak to that,\u201d he said. \u201cMy understanding of the security assistance issue is \u2014 \u201d Schiff interrupted. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you speak to that, ambassador? You\u2019re a career diplomat. You can understand the enormous leverage that a president would have while withholding military support from an ally at war with Russia. You can understand just how significant that would be, correct?\u201d Volker tried to go along without actually agreeing. \u201cI can understand that that would be significant,\u201d he said. Schiff persisted. \u201cAnd when that suspension of aid became known to that country, to Ukraine, it would be all the more weighty to consider what the president had asked of them, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cSo again, congressman, I don\u2019t believe \u2014 \u201d Volker began. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty straightforward question,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t believe the Ukrainians were aware that the assistance was being held up \u2014 \u201d \u201cThey became aware of it,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cThey became aware later, but I don\u2019t believe they were aware at the time, so there was no leverage implied,\u201d Volker said.\n\nIf this were a Republican and this was the Benghazi hearing, it\u2019d be front page news. As it stands, Schiff appears to be bulletproof in the legacy media. His actions are just ridiculous at this point. He\u2019s holding secret hearings, kicking Republicans out of testimony, and selectively leaking lines he thinks can help his impeachment case.\n\nThis isn\u2019t justice. It\u2019s not even proper in the political arena. It\u2019s just plain gross.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nEnjoying the read?
