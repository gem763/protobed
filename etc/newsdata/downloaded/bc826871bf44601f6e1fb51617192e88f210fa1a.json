I think it has been good so far.\"\n\nMtawarira also had special words for his captain, Siya Kolisi.\n\n\"What Siya has achieved has been remarkable. For a young kid from Zwide township in Port Elizabeth to rise above his circumstances and become Springbok captain, and lead the way he has, it\u2019s been inspirational to all South Africans \u2013 from all walks of life,\" he said.\n\n\"We are all proud of him, and we ultimately want to make it very special for him on Saturday.\n\n\"It would be amazing for South Africa for us to win the World Cup. A lot has gone into the preparation, and the road Siya has walked to get to here has been inspirational already.\n\n\"For that to be sealed off with winning the World Cup would be pretty amazing.\"\n\nOn a personal level, though, Mtawarira knows exactly what will be at stake on Saturday come kick-off at 11:00 (SA time).\n\n\"All the things I\u2019ve achieved in my career, and the tough lessons I've had to learn, everything has led to this moment,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm very proud of this achievement to get here. I've walked a long road, and just looking forward to making it count on Saturday.\"\n\n- Compiled by Lloyd Burnard", "description": "Veteran prop Tendai Mtawarira believes the Springboks are a side truly representative of South Africa as they prepare for Saturday's Rugby World Cup final.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5969/8c922fd3ae374c29b97713fda54e7e88.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
