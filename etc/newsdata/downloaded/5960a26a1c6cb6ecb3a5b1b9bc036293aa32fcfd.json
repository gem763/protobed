It\u2019s a reminder of Finder\u2019s diversified business model, comparing products across 105 categories, running a cryptocurrency exchange called HiveEx, preparing to launch a personal finance app, and ploughing profits into an internal venture capital arm in search of the next big thing.\n\nThings used to be far cruder. Schebesta and Restuccia\u2019s first business was called Freestyle Media and, in the internet wild west of the early 2000s, it lived up to its name, buying up all sorts of domain names on a bet that someone would one day be willing to pay for them. If you\u2019d like to own christmasday.com.au, they\u2019re still the guys to see.\n\nThey handed back anzacday.com.au when, as Schebesta recalls, broadcaster Alan Jones somehow found out they owned the sensitive domain and, after ranting about it on air, \u201cpeople from the RSL started ringing our office complaining\u201d.\n\nFreestyle\u2019s bread and butter was search engine optimisation (SEO): helping clients ensure their website appears on the first page of a Google search. As Schebesta admits, they would do so by almost any means necessary.\n\nIn 2005 Schebesta and Restuccia sold Freestyle for $1.36 million to ASX-listed media group Q Ltd.\n\nTwo years later the pair bankrolled Finder, with Schebesta in for 80 per cent and Restuccia 20 per cent. And the internet\u2019s scrappy ethos lived on.\n\nEven now, if Frank owes me three bucks I will make sure he pays it back. And I expect him to do the same with me. \u2014 Fred Schebesta\n\nFor its first few years, should you have clicked on a Finder link, there would be a good chance you\u2019d encounter a time-wasting page that was heavy on SEO-friendly keywords and light on helpfulness. That page would then funnel you towards curated, commission-earning domains.\n\nOn the eve of the Google penalty in 2011, Finder was bent on winning the eyeballs of people researching credit cards, home loans and insurance online. To do so, it was not always relying on its researchers being better than those of incumbents such as Canstar and iSelect.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe bought a few links that weren\u2019t totally legit by today\u2019s standards,\u201d says Schebesta, his slight smile betraying the fact that Finder had taken every dirty trick he ever learnt in SEO and run with it.\n\n\u201cWe knew what we were doing, and Google found out. And that\u2019s not good.\u201d\n\nFred Schebesta: \"Every single bit of traffic we get today is thanks to the hard work of our people.\" James Brickwood\n\nHe doesn\u2019t know if it was an algorithm or a Googler who flicked the switch that morning, and made Finder disappear. Regardless, he had little choice but to turn over a new leaf.\n\nA plaque next to the samurai sword acknowledges the \u201ctireless hours\u201d spent removing dodgy links and researching new content that had, by June of that year, restored Finder\u2019s rankings in Google searches to at least a semblance of their former selves. Instead of deploying tricks to attract traffic, Finder swivelled towards bona fide research into the products it describes and recommends.\n\n\u201cWe bought finder.com to be the domain that everything would sit under from then on, and there was no way we were going to risk losing that,\u201d Schebesta says.\n\n\u201cEvery single bit of traffic we get today is thanks to the hard work of our people \u2013 someone\u2019s willingness to stay talking to that call centre operator, and get the little intricacies. We\u2019ll know the purchase rate versus the cash advance rate on a credit card, for instance, and that stuff\u2019s not written anywhere.\u201d\n\nA year after it cut off Finder, Google launched its Penguin update which rendered most of Schebesta\u2019s \u201cspamdexing\u201d methods useless. The internet had grown up, and so had he.\n\nSchebesta had some experience at beating adversity before 2011. His childhood was an unusual mix of privilege and privation. Both he and Restuccia attended the expensive and academically selective Sydney Grammar School, yet Schebesta recalls living \u201csuper frugally\u201d as his parents studied to be doctors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAt one stage we were living in a caravan parked out the back of a little medical centre they\u2019d built in Allambie Heights,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a little rough, and at the time I wished they\u2019d hang out with me more. But on reflection it kind of ingrained in me what Finder is all about today \u2013 making the most out of what you have.\u201d\n\nThe penny-pinching ethos behind the comparison site certainly comes from the top. As Schebesta started the SEO business, skipping computer science lectures at university because internet programming languages still weren\u2019t being taught there, he would eat tinned spaghetti every day and patch holes in his shoes with gaffer tape. \u201cEven now, if Frank owes me three bucks I will make sure he pays it back,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I expect him to do the same with me.\u201d\n\nThe inspiration for Finder itself was frugality. Close to the edge in every regard, Freestyle Media had been run on credit cards, and the pair became so passionate about getting the best deal \u2013 Schebesta once haggled with ANZ over 2\u00a2 \u2013 they turned their hacks into a credit card blog which became Finder\u2019s first comparison service.\n\nNot that he\u2019s a complete Scrooge. For the past six years Finder has laid on breakfast and lunch for its staff every day \u2013 although, as Schebesta can\u2019t help admitting, the resulting gains in productivity have saved him money.\n\nIn 2018 he splurged on a $4 million apartment in Sydney\u2019s beachside Tamarama (he has two daughters and a \u201cgreat relationship\u201d with his former wife), and names his hobby outside work as fine meals and long conversations at restaurants like Spice Temple and Bistro Papillon.\n\nAs comparison sites like Finder become bigger, they are attracting more attention. In April, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission took iSelect \u2013 a competitor to Finder \u2013 to court, alleging that while it told users it would recommend the best electricity or gas provider for their needs, in reality it was recommending energy plans from the companies which paid iSelect the most in commissions. iSelect listed in 2013 at $1.85 per share. Its share price is now sinking towards 50\u00a2. For its part, Finder claims its comparisons and reviews are independent of any commissions it gets paid.\n\nAnd for now, Schebesta is keeping his focus on building the business, without the distraction of trying to get it towards its own ASX listing.\n\n\u201cFinder is a real business and we intend on growing it privately,\u201d he says. \u201cIf there is a clear reason to IPO, we will. Otherwise we aren\u2019t looking to cash in quick, unlike some of those start-ups you\u2019ve seen where the share price tanks on listing.\u201d\n\nSchebesta\u2019s willingness to invest in himself came from his parents, specifically his mother, Kerrie Meades \u2013 one of the first women in NSW to become an ophthalmologist.\n\n\u201cWhen I was 20, I asked Mum for a new computer because I\u2019d just been discovering this world of the internet. She went straight out and bought me this top-of-the-line model, which I built my first business on,\u201d he says. \u201cShe used to say to me, \u2018If you buy cheap, you buy twice. If you buy quality, you forget the cost.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe November issue of AFR Magazine, including the Young Rich List, is out on Friday, October 25 inside The Australian Financial Review.
