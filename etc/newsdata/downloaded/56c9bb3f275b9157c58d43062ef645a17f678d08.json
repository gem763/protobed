In one sense it\u2019s great to be the first, but I shouldn\u2019t be the first.\n\n\u2018I think this prize has moved with the times. Our culture has moved somewhat in the past few years.\u2019\n\nThe judges said they \u2018couldn\u2019t separate\u2019 the two books (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nShe added: \u2018I don\u2019t think it would have happened five years ago or ten years ago. I think it\u2019s about how the prize is won and who gets to be the judges.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It just has not gone to black people, hardly at all. Hopefully it will inspire people. Hopefully I will be a role model, especially to writers of colour.\u2019\n\nEvaristo\u2019s win also makes her the first black British author to win the prize since it began in 1969.\n\nWhile Atwood, who also received the prize in 2000 for novel The Blind Assassin, is now the award\u2019s oldest winner at 79.\n\nThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale author said she would have been \u2019embarrassed\u2019 to win the award alone at her age.\n\nThey will share the \u00a350,000 prize money (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nShe said: \u2018I have been on many a jury and I\u2019ve been on a jury where we\u2019ve split the prize. I understand the predicament. I get it.\n\n\u2018In a perfect world, which is the world of Alice In Wonderland, all have won and all shall have prizes.\u2019\n\nEvaristo and Atwood will share the \u00a350,000 prize money between them.\n\nThe Booker has been split twice before, between Nadine Gordimer and Stanley Middleton in 1974, and again between Michael Ondaatje and Barry Unsworth in 1992\n\nRules were brought in following this to prevent future divisions of the prize, but the judges insisted they \u2018couldn\u2019t separate\u2019 the two works.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
