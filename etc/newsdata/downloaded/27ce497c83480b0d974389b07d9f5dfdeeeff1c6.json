Sonos Flex subscriptions start at \u20ac15 per month and can be canceled at any time. The service is currently restricted to just 500 homes in the Netherlands, but could expand globally if successful.\n\nSonos Flex subscriptions are available at three different price points:\n\n\u20ac15 per month: two Sonos One smart speakers than can be paired together or used separately in different rooms. (\u20ac458 if purchased at Sonos.)\n\n\u20ac25 per month: Sonos Beam soundbar and two Sonos One speakers for TV audio. (\u20ac907 if purchased at Sonos.)\n\n\u20ac50 per month: Playbar, Subwoofer, and 2 Sonos One speakers for a more robust home theater setup. (\u20ac2,026 if purchased at Sonos.)\n\nThe speakers are available in either black or white, and will be automatically replaced with the latest models as they\u2019re released. Subscribers can alter their subscriptions or cancel at any time. Orders take about four days to process and delivery is free, with an option for free professional installation offered for Amsterdam residents (Sonos\u2019 European HQ is located in Hilversum, about 20 minutes away).\n\nFor anyone that values freedom and flexibility\n\nThe subscription is the company\u2019s latest effort to lower the barrier of entry to Sonos gear. The company recently partnered with Ikea on the Symfonisk series, bringing the starting price for a Sonos-compatible speaker down to just $99. In a statement emailed to The Verge, Sonos says that the Flex pilot also offers additional choice to consumers who value \u201cfreedom and flexibility,\u201d and who prefer subscriptions for services like meal deliveries, entertainment, and home fitness.\n\nSonos Flex is the most recent example of hardware subscriptions. Microsoft offers an All Access subscription to Surface computers (and previously, Xbox One consoles), while Apple has its annual phone replacement program. You can also subscribe to VanMoof smart bikes. Of these, the VanMoof offering is most closely aligned with Sonos Flex, in that you\u2019ll never actually own the Sonos speakers (or smart bike) you\u2019ve been renting once you end the subscription.\n\nSo, as tempting as these relatively low prices might be, it\u2019d be financially unwise to subscribe to Sonos Flex for an extended period. For example, you could have owned the speakers outright after 30 months of payments at the \u20ac15 tier, or 40 months at the \u20ac50 top tier. Likely faster since Sonos speakers are often discounted. True, you wouldn\u2019t be guaranteed upgrades to the latest Sonos speakers, but up until now, the company hasn\u2019t replace models frequently and Sonos speakers last a very long time.\n\nWhen asked for comment about a rent-to-own feature, a Sonos spokesperson said they\u2019re open to it. \u201cWe\u2019re listening to customers throughout the program, and if that is an area of feedback, we\u2019ll certainly look at it.\u201d", "description": "Sonos Flex subscriptions start at \u20ac15 per month for a pair of Sonos One speakers, or as much as \u20ac50 per month for a home cinema setup with subwoofer. There is no rent-to-own option and the pilot is limited to 500 Dutch homes for now.", "authors": ["Thomas Ricker", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A4H-HmjDgd9s3IKYaVr_JJcR-8w=/0x88:1321x780/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19266086/sonos_5_1_subscription.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
