Activists are demanding greater efforts be made at the meeting to tackle climate change.\n\nMs Thunberg first started skipping school to protests against inaction on climate change in 2018.\n\nHer actions have inspired schoolchildren and adults around the world to take up the fight.\n\nWhat happened on Friday?\n\nPacific island nations like Kiribati, the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu - all threatened by rising sea levels - kicked off the strike. Posts online showed citizens chanting: \"We are not sinking, we are fighting.\"\n\nIn Australia, 350,000 people are thought to have joined protests across the country, with some local authorities encouraging school children and workers to take part.\n\nThe country is already suffering from soaring temperatures, and warming seas have contributed to the death of half the Great Barrier Reef off Australia's north-east coast.\n\nFrom there, demonstrations spread to cities in Asia, Europe, Africa and the Americas.\n\nStudents in Ghana marched in the capital Accra, saying climate change has sped up coastal erosion which is affecting people on the country's coast. About 44% of the population of Ghana have not heard of climate change, one study by Afrobarometer suggests.\n\nPeople in Thailand and India staged \"die-ins\", falling to the ground and feigning death to demand greater government action.\n\nSkip Twitter post by @pakhead Climate strike march to Ministry of Environment in Bangkok today.

Greta!\" resounding around New York's Battery Park.\n\n\"This is the biggest climate strike ever in history, and we all should be so proud of ourselves because we have done this together,\" the teenager told demonstrators.\n\nMs Thunberg said about four million people took part in the strike around the world, \"and we're still counting.\"\n\n\"This is an emergency. Our house is on fire. And it's not just the young people's house, we all live here - it affects all of us,\" she told the crowd.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption The teenager said about 4 million people are thought to have taken part in the march, \"and we're still counting\"\n\nWherever she has gone in the world, she said, \"the empty promises are the same, the lies are the same and the inaction is the same\".\n\nThe eyes of the world will be on leaders at the UN next week, and \"they have a chance to take leadership to prove they actually hear us\".\n\n\"This is what people power looks like,\" she said, before ending the speech with a word for those \"who feel threatened by us\".\n\n\"This is only the beginning,\" she said. \"Change is coming whether they like it or not.\"\n\nWho is Greta Thunberg?\n\nSwedish teenager Greta Thunberg first staged a \"School Strike for Climate\" outside her national parliament in August last year.\n\nHer actions have inspired other schoolchildren and adults around the world, and she has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nThe 16-year-old travelled to the US by boat in August, refusing to fly or take a cruise ship due to the emissions those modes of transport cause.\n\nAhead of her address to the UN next week, Ms Thunberg told US politicians they must do more to combat climate change.\n\n\"Don't invite us here to just tell us how inspiring we are without actually doing anything about it,\" she said.", "description": "\"This is what people power looks like,\" teen Greta Thunberg says after a global climate strike.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07nyflx.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
