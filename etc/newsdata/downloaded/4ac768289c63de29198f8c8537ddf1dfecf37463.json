Amenhotep III inherited an empire that stretched from Euphrates to Sudan. The 18th Dynasty ruler became king at age 12, with his mother as regent. He is believed to have ruled Egypt between 1386 and 1349 BC. He chose the daughter of a provincial official as his royal wife, and throughout his reign Queen Tiye featured alongside the king. The king's palace at Malkata was close to his funerary temple - the largest ever built with its original location marked by the two 'Colossi of Memnon' statues. Amenhotep III died in around 1354 BC and was succeeded by his son Amenhotep IV, known as Akhenaten.\n\nResearchers with the Gebel el Silsila Project revealed their latest discovery in a blog post this week.\n\nThe team, led by archaeologists from Lund University and the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities, says only the head of the ram-headed sphinx \u2013 known as a criosphinx \u2013 was visible before the excavations in the quarry.\n\nNow, they\u2019ve uncovered the full body of a sculpture that measures roughly 5-meters long and 3.5 meters tall.\n\nThe top half of its head, however, has broken off and appears to have been lost to time.\n\nBeside the stomach of the large sculpture, the team uncovered yet another, smaller sphinx that appears to have been carved by an apprentice.\n\nThey also found a rough-cut sculpture of a coiled cobra that had been carved do crown the head of the main sphinx.\n\nThe ancient workshop is thought to date back to the 18th Dynasty, during the reign of Amenhotep III \u2013 King Tut\u2019s grandfather. Researchers with the Gebel el Silsila Project revealed their latest discovery in a blog post this week\n\nThe finds included a fragment of a winged solar disk, shown above. The team also found a falcon sculpture and a quarry text written at the time the site first opened, during the ruler\u2019s reign about 3350 years ago\n\n\u2018Both sculptures are preserved in a rough-cut and prepared for transportation, but were likely abandoned at Gebel el-Silsila as the larger sculpture fractured,\u2019 the researchers said.\n\n\u2018Since then, later Roman quarry activity buried the sphinxes in spoil.\u2019\n\nAccording to the team, the trove of hieroglyphic fragments also found at the quarry came from a since-destroyed shrine to Amenhotep III.\n\nThe 18th Dynasty ruler reigned in the mid 1300s BC alongside Queen Tiye.\n\nThe Swedish-Egyptian team behind the discovery found hundreds of hieroglyphic fragments at the site along with a small \u2018practice piece\u2019 of a sphinx that may have been carved by an apprentice\n\nThe team, led by archaeologists from Lund University and the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities, says only the head of the ram-headed sphinx \u2013 known as a criosphinx \u2013 was visible before the excavations in the quarry.
