There have been so many leaks of that phone that the company will have a hard time surprising anybody, but it may try. The new Pixels are rumored to have radar, for Pete\u2019s sake, so Google surely has something it can show off onstage that we haven\u2019t seen before.\n\nWe are also expecting a new Pixelbook made by Google, called the Pixelbook Go. There were leaks abound it as well, and they indicate it\u2019ll be a midrange device instead of the expensive flagships Google usually tries to make with Chrome OS.\n\nNest should be making an appearance as well, with a new Nest Mini speaker and Nest Wi-Fi system also rumored. Pixel Buds 2 seem likely because everybody is making earbuds now, and no way Google wants to be left out of that particular fight.\n\nWhat else? We have some ideas, but we\u2019ll know for sure when the event starts at 10AM ET.\n\nGoogle hardware event live blog\n\nLive stream the event in the background\n\nYou can also follow the latest news in our Google hub, and subscribe to The Verge on YouTube to watch our hands-on videos.", "description": "Google executives will go onstage today to announce the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL smartphones.
