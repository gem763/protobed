Unfortunately, no one is confident at this point that something meaningful will be announced this week, however, the risk of being caught being overly pessimistic is keeping a bid under the market.\n\nThere is often an inclination to try to read too much into the sort of action that we are seeing right now. At some point it may be a prelude to something dramatic but trying to guess what and when is not a good approach to trading. We simply have to stay patient and see what develops.\n\nSome pundits believe that the only way to approach the market is with dramatic predictions of what is going to happen. While that provides some interesting entertainment in the near term, it is of little value in the longer run. When the market starts to react more forcefully there will be plenty of time to make some moves and capture the movement.\n\nIn the near term, the market is primarily a hostage to vague and meaningless headlines about China trade. The computer algorithms will use them to try to catch overly anticipatory traders leaning the wrong way, although most market players have given up on trying to predict an immediate move of some magnitude.\n\nLike many others I'm anxious to be more aggressive with some trades. The opportunities are limited, however. There were a few breakouts Monday but more than a few failed breakouts as well. There aren't any major themes producing momentum. Precious metals, which perked up Monday, are reversing back down Tuesday morning.\n\nThere are some stocks that I believe will see positive momentum into third-quarter earnings but that is still too far off for any immediate action.\n\nIt is important to realize that you don't always have to have a strong view of what the market is going to do next. Sometimes it is a good idea to just sit and wait for evidence and technical conditions to develop. That is what I am doing now.\n\nWe have a positive start Tuesday morning but the challenge is follow-through. Until we see some higher highs, it is just another trading range market.", "description": "In the near term, the stock market is primarily a hostage to vague and meaningless headlines about China trade.", "authors": ["James", "Rev Shark", "Another Rally On Trade Talk But It Is Just Meaningless Noise Now", "Unfortunately", "No One Is Confident At This Point That Something Meaningful Will Be Announced This Week.", "Bruce Kamich", "Jim Cramer", "Ed Ponsi", "Chris Versace", "Stephen Guilfoyle"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/17b2d38c-a9cb-11e7-b5c3-a3972e5b6247.png", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
