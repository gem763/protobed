Operating profit rose 9.1% in the year ended Aug. 31, in line with market expectations.\n\nBut the retailer's profit forecast missed expectations. Fast Retailing projected operating profits would grow 6.7% in fiscal 2020, well below the 15% growth analysts polled by Refinitiv had estimated.\n\n\"It's a great, great name, great brand but there's a lot of uncertainty,\" Peter Boardman, managing director at NWQ Investment Management, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Friday. \"Things are slowing down.\"\n\nRecent data have pointed to a slowing Chinese economy after years of rapid growth, with concerns that the worst may not be over.\n\n\"Remember, 35% of their profits come out of China. So any sort of slowdown in China is certainly negatively affecting Fast Retailing or Uniqlo,\" Boardman said.\n\nChina has been a major growth market for Fast Retailing. Earlier this year, the retailer said it expects sales from the greater China region to hit 1 trillion yen (about $9.26 billion) by fiscal 2022. That would be nearly double the 502.5 billion yen (roughly $4.65 billion) in sales the company reported for fiscal 2019.\n\nFast Retailing also faces challenges stemming from Tokyo's ongoing trade dispute with Seoul, which has resulted in South Korean consumers boycotting Japanese products. That's a risk that Fast Retailing Chief Executive Tadashi Yanai highlighted as \"serious.\"\n\nIn fiscal 2019, the company said its South Korea business reported a decline in both revenue and profit. Fast Retailing also forecast \"large declines\" in the country for fiscal 2020.\n\nNWQ's Boardman said South Korea accounts for about 3% of Fast Retailing's revenues, a figure that was \"not material\" but at the same time a \"significant amount of money.\"\n\nGoing forward, Boardman said the pace of new store openings will be \"a lot slower\" than before, but added that it was \"just a sign of a maturing company.\"", "description": "The firm, which owns apparel giant Uniqlo, said Thursday that it had booked record profit for the third-straight year, sending shares higher in Friday trading.", "authors": ["Eustance Huang"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105911125-1557806883074gettyimages-1136025151.jpeg?v=1570763865", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
