We're redefining how whisky can be enjoyed. Introducing The Glenlivet Capsule Collection #noglassrequired pic.twitter.com/F4MGErsfZM \u2014 The Glenlivet (@TheGlenlivet) October 2, 2019\n\nThis is a terrible way to enjoy a cocktail. I appreciate alternative, biodegradable packaging, and can see the pouches being used by marathon runners who don\u2019t want to wear dorky water belts, but cocktails are made to be sipped, not shot, and these are nothing but disrupted Jell-O shots.\n\nBased on the promotional video \u2014 and what I\u2019ve read about Notpla (the edible membrane) \u2014 consuming these pods seems unpleasant.\n\nYou place the pod in your mouth and pop the membrane with your teeth. Your mouth is then flooded with booze, which makes its journey through your esophagus and into your belly, leaving you with a tasteless, kinda stretchy, kinda chewy seaweed membrane hanging out in your mouth. You then have to decide if you\u2019re going to spit or swallow, a dilemma I do not wish to be faced with at the bar.\n\nLuckily, the naughty Gushers won\u2019t be available in my country any time soon, as they were created for London\u2019s cocktail week, which ends on Sunday. These whiskey pods are not a hack, and in fact emblematic of the worst kind of \u201chack\u201d \u2014 the kind that nobody asked for. These pods seek to solve a non-existent problem, to elevate something that was already esteemed, and fix that which wasn\u2019t broken. In short, it is wack.\n\nCould seaweed packaging be used for good, useful things? Yes. This type of delivery system would probably be appreciated by people with limited mobility in their hands, and moving away from plastic packaging is, in most cases, a positive thing. But limited-time, small-portion, pre-stirred cocktails that leave a literal film in your mouth is not it, no matter how meme-able they are.\n\nRather than co-opting millennials\u2019 nihilistic sense of humour and repackaging it as a lukewarm, lazy marketing ploy, The Glenlivet should try making a more affordable scotch for the avocado toast eaters. We don\u2019t actually want to eat Tide Pods, but we do like to drink, and we deserve to drink out of a glass.", "description": "In an effort to appeal to the Tide Pod generation, The Glenlivet has released their \u201cCapsule Collection,\u201d which consists of small portions of alcohol enrobed in edible seaweed packaging.
