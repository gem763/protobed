That is the biggest weekly loss of 2019 assuming prices remain at similar levels until Sunday\u2019s UTC close.\n\nThe biggest loss of 2019 so far was a 13 percent fall back in the second week of January, so any greater loss this week would be the most severe of the year to date.\n\nAs seen above:\n\nBitcoin looks set to confirm its 16th weekly loss of 2019.\n\nThe cryptocurrency has registered double-digit weekly losses only twice in the first six months.\n\nPrices have registered double-digit weekly losses four times in the third quarter.\n\nThe 13 percent drop seen in the second week of January turned out to be a bear trap:s prices bottomed out around $3,300 over the next five weeks before breaking into a bull market in April.\n\nThe latest two-figure drop, though, indicates the bull market from April\u2019s lows near $4,000 has ended and the sellers have regained control.\n\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning that the cryptocurrency has found acceptance below the 200-day MA for the first time since April 2. The breakdown of the long-term support has further confirmed a bullish-to-bearish trend change. The average is currently located at $8,352.\n\nAll-in-all, a corrective bounce, if any, over the weekend will likely be short lived and the cryptocurrency could close below $8,719 on Sunday, confirming the biggest weekly loss of 2019.\n\nWeekly chart\n\nBTC has dived out a narrowing price on the weekly chart, confirming a bearish reversal.\n\nThe 14-week RSI has dipped below 50 for the first time since the end of March. A reading below 50 indicates bearish conditions.\n\nThe MACD histogram is producing deeper bars below the zero line, also indicating a strengthening of bearish momentum.\n\n4-hour and daily charts\n\nOn the 4-hour chart, the RSI has produced higher lows, indicating scope for a corrective bounce. Further, the 14-day RSI is reporting oversold conditions with a sub-50 print.\n\nHence, a minor bounce, possibly to levels above the 200-day MA at $8,352 cannot be ruled out.\n\nThe daily chart, however, is biased bearish. For instance, the MACD is indicating strong bearish momentum, and the 5- and 10-day MAs are trending south. These averages currently located at $8,553 and $9,337 could offer strong resistance.\n\nRecovery rallies, if any, could be reversed, possibly leading to a deeper drop to $7,500. The bearish setup would be neutralized only if prices rise above $9,097, as discussed yesterday.\n\nDisclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.\n\nBitcoin image via CoinDesk Archives; charts by Trading View", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.coindesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dark-bitcoin.jpg"}
