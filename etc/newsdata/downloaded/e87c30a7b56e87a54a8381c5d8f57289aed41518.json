That night, President Donald Trump jumped on Twitter and compared Wallace unfavorably to his late father.\n\n\u201cSomebody please explain to Chris Wallace of Fox, who will never be his father (and my friend), Mike Wallace, that the Phone Conversation I had with the President of Ukraine was a congenial & good one,\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nExpect much more of the same to follow.\n\nTwo days earlier, Shepard Smith, whose tough and factual reporting style often drew the ire of Trump and his supporters, abruptly left the network. For years, Smith served not only as Fox News\u2019 premier breaking news anchor but also as the most prominent banner carrier for the network\u2019s team of straight-news reporters. His abdication positions Wallace as his natural successor.\n\nIt\u2019s a role guaranteed to attract fire. Trump has made it clear that he doesn\u2019t appreciate it when his favorite TV channel exposes its viewers to unflattering news about him.\n\nSmith\u2019s departure also makes Wallace more important than ever to the network, which relies on the credibility of its news division to counter criticism about its Trump-friendly prime-time hosts.\n\n\u201cSmith leaving is a big deal\u201d because Wallace can\u2019t do it on his own, said Andrew Tyndall, publisher of the Tyndall Report, which monitors newscasts. To be considered a legitimate news outlet, \u201cyou can\u2019t just point to one person.\u201d\n\nFox News says Wallace is just one of many respected journalists at the network who have confronted members of the Trump administration, including Bret Baier, Neil Cavuto and Martha MacCallum. But Wallace\u2019s tough interviews, especially with Republicans, have been shared on social media and cited by other news outlets, reinforcing the notion that Fox News is feeding viewers more than just conservative talking points.\n\nWhile Smith appeared on Fox News every weekday, Wallace\u2019s show only airs on Sundays, making him a less regular presence to viewers. (Wallace will join a rotating cast of news anchors filling in for Smith\u2019s vacated 3 p.m. hour until the network names a permanent replacement.)\n\n\u201cChris becomes the next voice of realism at Fox News, but I\u2019m not sure that he replaces Shep,\u201d said Conor Powell, a former Fox News foreign correspondent. \u201cChris is a really good interviewer and plays an important role. But he only has one show once a week. Shep was on every day.\u201d\n\nWallace\u2019s contract keeps him at Fox News through the 2020 election. His journalistic credibility is also good for business, helping Fox News host presidential debates, attract advertisers and charge distributors like Comcast Corp. higher fees to carry the network.\n\n\u201cIf it turns out you\u2019re not a news organization anymore, you lose bargaining leverage with cable operators,\u201d Tyndall said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s been their mantra for decades: \u2018We\u2019re a real news organization. We have Shep Smith and Chris Wallace.\u2019\u201d\n\nWallace, 72, was praised in 2016 for his performance moderating a presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Trump. More recently, he\u2019s gained attention for pushing back on explanations from the White House. He described responses by Trump aide Stephen Miller as \u201can exercise in obfuscation\u201d and said Trump\u2019s backers had been \u201cdeeply misleading.\u201d\n\nWallace calls himself an \u201cequal opportunity inquisitor\u201d and has said that he has the full support of Fox News executives.\n\nHis father, Mike Wallace, was one of the original correspondents for \u201c60 Minutes\u201d on CBS. He died in 2012.\n\nMike passed down his confrontational, devil-may-care gene to his son, said Jonathan Klein, a former president of CNN\u2019s U.S. network.\n\n\u201cChris plows ahead and does what he thinks is right,\u201d Klein said. \u201cIt serves Fox News viewers well because Chris knows they deserve to hear the truth.\u201d\n\nThe late Fox News founder Roger Ailes hired seasoned journalists like Wallace because he thought it would deflect criticism of the network\u2019s right-leaning opinion hosts, Klein said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s been their mantra for decades: \u2018We\u2019re a real news organization. We have Shep Smith and Chris Wallace,\u2019\u201d Klein said. \u201cBut these days I\u2019m not sure how much they care about that. Their brand has morphed.\u201d", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- On Oct. 13,\u00a0Chris Wallace, the host of \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d grilled Secretary of Defense Mark Esper about the administration\u2019s response to the growing Ukraine scandal.
