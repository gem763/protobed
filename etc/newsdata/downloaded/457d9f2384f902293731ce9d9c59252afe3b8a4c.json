The field is set to produce crude for 50 years, well beyond the time where the world\u2019s greenhouse-gas emissions should be net zero to avoid warming of more than 1.5 degrees.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s understandable that it could be viewed as a paradox in times like these,\u201d said economics professor Klaus Mohn, the rector of the University of Stavanger, the country\u2019s oil capital. \u201cBut Norway has stubbornly maintained a separation between its oil policy on one side and climate policy on the other.\u201d\n\nSverdrup has already been a boon for Norway\u2019s offshore industry, and now promises to deliver a big production boost for its owners and the country as a whole. Yet, it comes the year after Equinor changed its name from Statoil, to reflect increased investments in renewable energy, and as political debate about the post-oil era in Norway is accelerating.\n\nEquinor anticipated the apparent contradiction on its website, with the main banner reading: \u201cWe\u2019re celebrating the opening of the Johan Sverdrup oil field. But what about the climate?\u201d The platforms will receive electricity from Norway\u2019s onshore grid, dominated by hydropower, meaning each barrel of oil will generate 0.67 kilos of carbon dioxide in the production phase, compared to averages of about 9kg in Norway and 18kg globally.\n\nEquinor and Norway have long used Sverdrup as a prime example of why they should be the last to stop producing oil, even betting that barrels produced with lower emissions will become a competitive advantage in a world where higher prices on carbon pollution will reduce demand for crude.\n\nEmissions from the production process account for just a fraction of the life cycle of a barrel of crude. If all of Sverdrup\u2019s oil is burned, it could produce more than 1.1 billion tons of carbon dioxide -- more than 20 times Norway\u2019s total annual emissions, based on a U.S. government estimate of how much CO2 is generated from burning a barrel of oil.\n\nSverdrup\u2019s startup is a \u201cfantastic day for Equinor and state coffers,\u201d economics professor Knut Einar Rosendahl said on Twitter. \u201cNot such a fantastic day for global climate-gas emissions.\u201d\n\nDiscovered in 2010, in an area that had been disregarded by most explorers, the site started production on Saturday and is set to reach 440,000 barrels a day by next summer. That represents a 33% addition to Norway\u2019s crude output in the first half of this year, a hike not seen since the 1980s.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to overstate the importance of Sverdrup for its owners, the Norwegian state and the country\u2019s entire oil industry.\n\nConfidence about the field\u2019s startup was key for state-controlled Equinor\u2019s decision to kick off a long-awaited $5 billion buyback program in September, and Sverdrup will be a driving force in the company\u2019s production growth in the next years. It also helped to transform Lundin Petroleum AB -- which made the initial discovery -- and Aker BP ASA into two of the most important companies in Norway\u2019s oil industry.\n\nWith as much as 3.2 billion barrels in reserves, it\u2019s Norway\u2019s biggest discovery since the 1970s. In an illustration of how unusually large the field is, Aker BP considered going to court over a few decimals in ownership.\n\nEquinor expects Sverdrup to contribute about $100 billion to Norway\u2019s state coffers. The field\u2019s timing was also perfect for the Nordic country: green-lighted in 2015, just after a historic collapse in the crude market, it offered a lifeline to the embattled oil-service industry, even if the market slump forced suppliers to cut prices.\n\nFor Equinor and the other owners, the timing was even better. The discount on services and equipment allowed them to slash investments by as much as 44% compared to the highest early estimates, giving the field an overall break-even price of less than $20 a barrel.\n\nSverdrup was originally scheduled to start production in December this year, but Equinor advanced the date to October. The field will reach maximum output of 660,000 barrels a day in its second phase in 2023.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Mikael Holter in Oslo at mholter2@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: James Herron at jherron9@bloomberg.net, Helen Robertson\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The timing of Norway\u2019s biggest oil project in decades is a bit awkward.Equinor ASA kicked off its massive Johan Sverdrup field, a rare mega-project in the aging North Sea, at a moment where the pressure on the oil industry and governments to act against the climate crisis has never been", "authors": ["Mikael Holter"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/pHqleTB446HHoZ3YuRIuZQ--~B/aD0xMjgyO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/12468df4bd8cc4f171311741046dc615", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
