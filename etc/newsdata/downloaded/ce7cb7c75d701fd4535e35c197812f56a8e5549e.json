Kennedy announces Democratic primary challenge to Sen. Markey", "language": "en", "text": "Rep. Joe Kennedy, the latest generation of a famous political family, announced Saturday that he would challenge Sen. Edward J. Markey in Massachusetts\u2019s Democratic primary, a bid certain to divide the party in the state and in Washington.\n\nIn a gym at a social center in East Boston, Kennedy cast his candidacy as part of a long-overdue revolution to change government and issued a rallying cry to those disheartened in the Trump era.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump has forced a reckoning in our nation, without question,\u201d Kennedy told the crowd. \u201cBut to meet this moment it requires more than just beating him, it requires taking on a broken structure that allowed him to win in the first place \u2026 the daily acts of oppression and injustice that enabled 63 million Americans to believe he was the best stewards of their dreams and hopes and aspirations.\u201d\n\nAhead of a rally here, Kennedy emailed supporters a video officially declaring his candidacy and describing conversations with constituents.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve told them not to give up. I have implored them to do more. I have begged them to reach deeper, fight harder, put more on the line \u2014 because everything we believe in is at stake,\u201d Kennedy writes in the email.\n\nHe also mentioned the need for a new generation to take on \u201coutdated structures and old rules,\u201d an implicit nod to the decades that separate him and his opponent.\n\n\n\nRep. Joe Kennedy speaks on a panel on race and politics at the Massachusetts Democratic Convention in Springfield, Mass. (Jessica Hill/AP)\n\nKennedy, who turns 39 next month, is the grandson of the late Robert Kennedy, who was attorney general and New York senator when he was assassinated in 1968 during his bid for the presidency. He is also the great-nephew of President John F. Kennedy and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy.\n\nWhile Kennedy is buoyed by his famous last name, he\u2019s also been held up as a rising star in the party, having been picked to deliver the Democrats\u2019 official response to President Trump\u2019s State of the Union address in 2018.\n\nHowever, some in Massachusetts and the national Democratic Party see his candidacy as damaging: why challenge a successful Democrat with nearly identical policy positions at a time when the real focus needs to be on defeating Republicans, they argue. Others say Kennedy is the future of the party, and that a primary challenge will strengthen, not weaken whoever goes forward.\n\nMarkey, 73, has held the Senate seat since 2013, and served in Congress for 37 years before that. He has the backing of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nJust ahead of Kennedy\u2019s event, Markey challenged him and other candidates in the race to a debate focused solely on climate change, Markey\u2019s marquee issue, the week of Nov. 11.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the author of the Green New Deal, along with my good friend Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,\u201d said Markey, nodding to his work with the 29-year-old congresswoman and liberal favorite.\n\nEnvironmental activists in particular seemed upset by Kennedy\u2019s decision, because Markey has long championed issues they care about, and co-sponsored the Green New Deal, legislation that would address climate change and economic inequality.\n\n\u201cThis is the moment for defeating a corrupt and planet-killing president \u2014 not for taking down a longtime environmental hero like Edward J. Markey just because you think you can,\u201d Lise Olney, a volunteer grass roots organizer and climate activist from Wellesley, Mass., said via email. \u201cLaunching an internecine battle to defeat him is the very definition of hubris. And it\u2019s hard to see how it can possibly be good for Massachusetts.\u201d\n\n[Former Massachusetts governor Weld backs Joe Kennedy in his bid to unseat Sen. Edward Markey]\n\nAlthough it\u2019s far too early to predict an outcome, Peter Ubertaccio, a political scientist and dean of the School of Arts & Sciences at Stonehill College in Easton, Mass., said Kennedy is a very serious competitor. \u201cHe brings name recognition, money, talent, organization and at least in the very early polls, a decent lead, so it\u2019s going to be a really hard-fought race,\u201d Ubertaccio said.\n\nWhile others wondered why Kennedy would challenge a well-liked incumbent, Ubertaccio said it makes sense that Kennedy would want to be in the Senate, at a time when there\u2019s a chance both the presidency and the Senate will turn Democratic.\n\n\u201cIf a Democrat wins in 2020, he\u2019s going to want to be playing a leading role in passing Democratic legislation,\u201d Ubertaccio said of Kennedy. \u201cMany members of Congress would prefer to be in the Senate, particularly if their party comes into power.\u201d\n\nBut Ubertaccio noted that Markey isn\u2019t going to go quietly. As Kennedy has been making noises about challenging him, Markey has been staffing up his campaign and going on the offensive \u2014 rather than rolling over and allowing Kennedy to win. \u201cMassachusetts hasn\u2019t had a primary quite like this since the early 1980s,\u201d Ubertaccio said, citing the 1978 and 1982 gubernatorial races between Michael Dukakis and Edward King, both of whom had served as governor.\n\nIn those competitions, there was a clear distinction between the candidates\u2019 policies, Ubertaccio said. But not now. \u201cIt really isn\u2019t about significant policy differences,\u201d Ubertaccio said of the Massachusetts Senate race.\n\nInstead of distinguishing himself on policy issues, Ubertaccio said Kennedy will have to convince Democratic voters in the state that he hasn\u2019t undermined the party by going after an-already Democratic seat.\n\nScott Gilman, a volunteer with Sunrise Boston, the local chapter of a national environmental group made up of young people, said he\u2019s been very happy with Markey\u2019s leadership on climate change. He said he hasn\u2019t followed Kennedy\u2019s climate stance closely, but assumes that his environmental policies will also be liberal.\n\n\u201cI could see myself voting for him in another race,\u201d Gilman said, \u201cbut for this race, I don\u2019t see it making sense.\u201d\n\nGilman said he doesn\u2019t understand why Kennedy would challenge such a strong advocate for the environment. Markey\u2019s \u201cbeen in this fight since before it was cool. Before GenZ and Millennials were a voting block \u2014 since I was in middle school and high school,\u201d Gilman said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you would want to challenge that if you\u2019re somebody who\u2019s concerned about climate.\u201d\n\nRebecca Pinn, president of Young Democrats of Massachusetts, said via email that her group doesn\u2019t endorse in contested primaries but does encourage its members to get involved with candidates they support. In the Senate race, Pinn said she wants a progressive candidate who actively advocates for issues that affect young people. She praised Markey\u2019s support for the environment and for net neutrality, the idea that people and companies shouldn\u2019t be able to buy their way to faster Internet service. She likes Kennedy for his support of a state ballot initiative last year that upheld transgender rights.\n\nBut Pinn said she\u2019s concerned that the race will drain money from other races. \u201cThere is always the concern resources will be spread too thin in a presidential election year where getting rid of the current occupant of the White House is the top priority,\u201d she said.\n\nMary Olberding, a resident of Belchertown, Mass., and the elected Hampshire County Register of Deeds, said she\u2019s thrilled that Kennedy is entering the race. Trump\u2019s 2016 win and the \u201cblue wave\u201d that followed in 2018 showed that the country is ready for new leadership, she said.\n\nOlberding said she\u2019s also focused on the long-term. Markey might do a great job for the next six years, but by then, he\u2019ll be in his 80s, and he would be unlikely to run again, she said. Kennedy, on the other hand, has decades of leadership ahead of him \u2014 time he can spend throwing support to other Democratic candidates and helping to build the party, Olberding said.\n\nKennedy\u2019s name recognition and power within the national party, will win him some forgiveness among Democrats, and put him in a very strong position more than 13 months before the election, Ubertaccio said. \u201cThe fact that Markey has responded with a degree of strength indicates that he understands that he is probably not going to be driving this race,\u201d Ubertaccio said. \u201cKennedy\u2019s probably in the driver\u2019s seat.\u201d\n\nTwo other candidates are also in the primary race, labor attorney Shannon Liss-Riordan, a proponent for women\u2019s rights and worker\u2019s issues, and businessman Steve Pemberton, who grew up in foster care.\n\nLiss-Riordan, who describes the current legislators as \u201cWashington insiders,\u201d said she thinks having Kennedy in the race will help her, because his policies are so similar to Markey\u2019s.\n\nUbertaccio said she\u2019s theoretically right that Markey and Kennedy will split the vote, but winning will also require a strong organization, funding base and voter awareness. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about two powerhouses \u2014 unless you\u2019ve got a 3rd or 4th powerhouse, I think it could be very hard [to win],\u201d he said.\n\nColby Itkowitz reported from Washington.", "description": "Kennedy\u2019s bid is certain to divide Democrats as Sen.
