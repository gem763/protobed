Biden waited until almost the end of the debate in Westerville, Ohio, to deliver a shot with an unmistakable target.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here, but I\u2019m the only one on this stage that has gotten anything really big done,\u201d Biden said in a response to a question about whether Warren and Bernie Sanders would be able to attract the voters necessary to beat President Donald Trump.\n\nWarren responded that she was able to help create the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau despite \u201call of the Washington insiders and strategic geniuses\u201d saying it would never get through Congress.\n\nAfter the former vice president jumped in to say he had rounded up the votes for the CFPB, Warren offered that she was \u201cdeeply grateful to President Obama who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law.\u201d\n\nChanged Race\n\nFor most of Tuesday night, as in the three previous debates, top candidates Biden, Warren and Sanders have mostly stayed away from attacking each other. But Warren\u2019s rise as Biden\u2019s direct competitor, mostly at the expense of Sanders, has shifted the dynamic in the race.\n\nSanders, who has been competing with Warren for the mantle of the party\u2019s progressive leader, jumped into the fray by going to the parts of Biden\u2019s record that he\u2019s said he regrets or that are unfavorable with the Democratic primary electorate.\n\n\u201cYou talked about working with Republicans and getting things done, but you know what you also got done \u2013 and I say this as a good friend \u2013 you got the disastrous war in Iraq done,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cYou got a bankruptcy bill which is hurting middle class families all over this country. You got trade agreements like Nafta and PNTR with China done, which have cost us four million jobs.\u201d\n\nFrom the outset, the fourth Democratic debate was a departure from the three earlier contests, which started with policy arguments over health insurance and immigration.\n\nImpeachment\n\nThe 12 candidates on the stage began with an issue that unifies them-impeaching Trump and removing him from office.\n\n\u201cSometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics and I think that is the case,\u201d Warren said. \u201cThis man will not be able to break the law over and over without consequences\u201d and moving ahead on impeachment is \u201cabout the next president and the next president and the next president\u201d and the future of the country.\n\nAlthough he is at the center of the acts the prompted the impeachment inquiry, Biden only had to confront one question about his son\u2019s work in Ukraine. The current House impeachment inquiry is rooted in part on Trump\u2019s efforts to investigate Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings while Biden was vice president.\n\n\u201cLook, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government in rooting out corruption in Ukraine,\u201d Biden said from the stage of Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio.\n\nHunter Biden, 49, acknowledged making a mistake in working for Burisma Holdings earlier Tuesday. Joe Biden said he had nothing more to add, and none of his rivals used the opportunity to criticize him.\n\nThe debate, though, shifted quickly back to health care, giving an opening to Pete Buttigieg and others to challenge Warren over her refusal to say that the Medicare for All plan she supports would raise taxes on the middle class, even if their net health costs would go down.\n\nWhat matters is \u201dwhat kinds of costs middle class families are going to face,\u201d Warren, a Massachusetts senator, said. But opponents who favor keeping the Affordable Care Act in place and adding to it accused Warren of evasiveness.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren, the two leaders in the Democratic nomination race, finally confronted each other near the end of Tuesday night\u2019s debate, clashing over how far and how fast the nation can change -- and who is best equipped to bring it about.The sharp exchange encapsulated", "authors": ["Gregory Korte", "Jennifer Epstein"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GKY1rCBUfkYe8XZ8iuKWHw--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/5b6ebd57e985e5872c9f1d4b92934042", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
