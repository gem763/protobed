We all kind of complement each other.\u201d\n\nHailing from California, BM is the only fluent English speaker in the quartet, therefore taking on the interview by himself.\n\nThough not the first co-ed group to ever exist in the K-pop world, KARD is the first to gain real traction \u2014 especially outside of South Korea.\n\nJ.Seph (Kim Tae-hyung), BM, Jeon So-min and Jeon Ji-woo first came out in 2016 and released \u201cOh Nana,\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t Recall\u201d and \u201cRumor\u201d before their official debut with \u201cHola Hola\u201d the following year.\n\nAt the beginning, the group had a strong Caribbean influence in its music, incorporating dance hall and reggaeton sounds and choreography, which ultimately gained them a huge following in the Americas and subsequently the world. A few months short of their three years being active, they\u2019re regulars on Billboard\u2019s World Digital Albums and World Digital Songs charts.\n\nSince \u201cHola Hola,\u201d KARD has evolved in its sound, adding more electronica to songs. And while the genres vary slightly with each comeback, a constant in KARD\u2019s identity and what ultimately sets the group apart is its performances.\n\nThough a changing trend these days, the choreographies seen from boy and girl groups often are starkly different. KARD, with two men and two women, must find the balance between what\u2019s perceived as masculine and feminine dance moves with each release, which is one of the biggest struggles for the group.\n\n\u201cWhen you see girl [groups], they can be tomboyish, but for the most part, people usually want to see that sexy-cute, that pretty girl-ish vibe. And when you see boy groups, they usually have like super hard-hitting and sharp movements. But with us, it\u2019s kinda hard to stick with that because we do have two guys in the group, as well,\u201d BM said.\n\n\u201cFinding that line between doing what the boys are good at and incorporating what the girls are good at is one of the hardest things for our choreographers. It\u2019s a struggle every time because everyone has to shine in the song.\u201d\n\nBut KARD isn\u2019t only finding a balance within that binary. Members actually are redefining it within K-pop.\n\n\u201cWe have fun with it, because if it\u2019s the girl part of the song, it\u2019s inevitable it has to have that girl-ish vibe where the person singing has to look and feel her best as far as being confident about the choreography,\u201d BM added.\n\nSo when we learn my parts of the song, it is gonna be swag, it is gonna be hard-hitting, so watching the girls actually pull that off is just really, really interesting and fun to watch. And if you flip it and look at it the other way around, where the guys have to do the more feminine dances, it is kinda fun, too. We\u2019re just learning about our bodies more and being able to express in different ways.\u201d\n\nAlready on the third installment of the Wild Kard in USA tour since the group\u2019s onset, BM considers going on the road to perform for its fans, Hidden Kard, the best part about their jobs.\n\n\u201cWhen we come on tour and we meet all our fans face-to-face and actually respond to what they\u2019re saying and vibe off of each others\u2019 energy, it makes it so much more intimate and rewarding. It definitely helps me remember why I do this and why I constantly make music and why we practice endless hours at night,\u201d BM said.\n\nFor this tour, KARD had the opportunity to perform their first self-produced single, made by BM, in front of fans. Taking their performance endurance to the next level, \u201cDumb Litty\u201d is an aggressive EDM molotov bomb \u2014 something they had yet to try.\n\n\u201cWe were all getting ready for the next comeback and I was heavily focused on what fans were saying [online]. And many were asking what we do when we\u2019re self-conscious or when we\u2019re having self-confidence issues. And that was a question I wanted to respond through our music, which is why we came out with \u2018Dumb Litty,\u2019\u201d BM explained.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a song about not caring about what people say to you. Whether it be outside voices, or it could also be the negative voice inside you that\u2019s kinda holding you back. I just wanted to speak about ignoring those voices and just being a boss at life and aggressively taking ahold of your life without being concerned with what anyone has to say.\u201d\n\nMoving forward, BM plans to produce more tracks for KARD, and hopes to work with other artists both in their label, DSP Media, and outside of it. His goals for the group recently changed, becoming more humble.\n\n\u201cJust a couple of months ago, I would always say [my goal was], \u2018No. 1 one on Billboard or music shows\u2019 and just getting more popular and whatnot. But I think that at this point in my life, I feel like life is going so good right now that even if we don\u2019t pop off harder, just being able to do shows at this caliber and just being able to travel the world and see our fans face-to-face is such a big blessing,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re making enough to eat, we live in our own homes and I just feel like life is so good right now and there are no negatives that come out, so, as far as goals, I just want it to be just like this for the rest of our careers.\u201d", "description": "Oct. 30 (UPI) \u2014 With the newest generation of K-pop acts, individuality is something artists strive to showcase to appeal to a global audience and", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
