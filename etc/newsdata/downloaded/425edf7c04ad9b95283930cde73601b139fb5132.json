That suggested that while many in the medical community do oppose Trump\u2019s plan to repeal and replace the ACA, they are ambivalent about the plans of his political opponents. And they hoped that, when it came time to debate on Thursday night, those candidates would offer substance instead of platitudes.\n\nRob Davidson speaks at a rally with doctors who converged at the Texas Medical Center to denounce what they call President Trump\u2019s \u201cassault\u201d on Americans\u2019 health care.

A few, though not many, supported Trump\u2019s ultimately unsuccessful 2017 effort to repeal the ACA, which was President Barack Obama\u2019s signature legislative accomplishment. The American Medical Association has come out against a fully federalized health care system, the proposal of Vermont senator and presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. Some doctors, though, do believe that such a fix is not just possible but necessary.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want a single-payer for all of America,\u201d said Dr. Lee Ben-Ami, a Houston family practice doctor who is also affiliated with a local progressive group but was speaking as a private individual. She said she was \u201ca little worried\u201d about the Democratic Party moving toward the Sanders plan, even as she said it was necessary to provide health care to uninsured Americans. Centrist candidates like Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado have offered such proposals, with a public option, but even though that was regarded as a radical solution during the Obama administration, it is now seen by many progressives as a conservative concession.\n\nSuch friction could spell trouble for Democrats, who in the 2018 midterm congressional elections successfully ran on protecting health care from cuts by Republicans. At the time, a tight focus on preserving the ACA allowed for victories even in unlikely districts like the 14th in Illinois, a Republican stronghold won by Lauren Underwood, a first-time candidate who was trained as a nurse. Her opponent had voted to repeal the ACA as a House member.\n\nDr. Pritesh Gandhi speaks at the rally.

And then I have some Democrats where I can\u2019t pinpoint their policy.\u201d", "description": "A day before the Democratic presidential debate in Houston, doctors affiliated with a progressive group held a rally to denounce the Trump administration's proposals to strip Americans of health care coverage.", "authors": ["Alexander Nazaryan", "National Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/rFwWWnbNDjkr.8JrU3FoTw--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/1dd9fb80-d56c-11e9-9ee3-420fa7bcda24", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
