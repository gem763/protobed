The confused quasi-withdrawal from Syria exemplifies everything that\u2019s wrong with how Trump runs U.S. foreign policy. He makes poor, ill-informed snap decisions and fails to consult with anyone, but then he allows himself to be talked into some half-a-loaf compromise policy that is the worst of both worlds. The president frequently makes poor decisions and even when he moves in the right direction he does so for the wrong reasons, but then his subordinates try to trick him into reversing himself for their own bad reasons. Because the president is deeply ignorant and easily swayed by hawkish advisers, he always falls for the trick. That leaves the U.S. with policies that the president doesn\u2019t really like interrupted with sporadic bursts of confused, frenetic activity as he tries to change them and then gets manipulated into doing more of the same. Trump\u2019s subordinates rely on his lack of discipline and focus to prevent him from doing things they dislike, and Trump\u2019s own ineptitude encourages them to keep doing this because they assume that they can get away with it.\n\nIn this case, Trump suddenly ordered the redeployment of U.S. forces without warning to the people that would be affected, and his subordinates had been so determined to frustrate the president that they were completely unprepared for the order when it came. This latest trick with using the oil to bait Trump into signing off on the indefinite military presence that his subordinates want will work for a while until the president decides that he doesn\u2019t like being compared to a fussy infant who needs to take his medicine. Then there will be another abrupt decision without any of the necessary preparation, and more chaos will ensue. This is what a broken and incompetent foreign policy process looks like, and both the president and his subordinates are responsible for the mess. Either way, the U.S. ends up with an open-ended, illegal military deployment in Syria, and the only debate is over what the absurd justification for the mission will be. For the moment, the official administration position is that U.S. forces are there to control and exploit another country\u2019s natural resources. Adam Weinstein sums it up:\n\nThe United States is now officially the globe\u2019s hired muscle for commodities protection; its explicit foreign policy is now \u201cYes, blood for oil!\u201d\n\nEverything about this is illegal, and there is no longer even a pretense that the U.S. has any legal basis for having a military presence in Syria. Our forces are simply seizing control of territory and resources because they can, and the president boasts about it to the world. Endless war has been horribly distorting our foreign policy for decades, and this is just the latest example.", "description": "", "authors": ["Daniel Larison"], "top_image": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/shutterstock_348259271.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
