No one is above the law,\u201d said Pelosi, a California Democrat.\n\nSpeaking on Capitol Hill, Pelosi said \u201cthe actions of the Trump presidency revealed the dishonorable fact of the president\u2019s betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections.\u201d\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Trump said on Twitter he approved a Wednesday release of a transcript of the July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. However, Democrats are seeking the details of a whistleblower complaint that deals with the Zelensky call. Pelosi demanded it be turned over to Congress by the acting director of national intelligence.\n\n\u201cHe will have to choose whether to break the law or honor his responsibility to the Constitution,\u201d Pelosi said about acting DNI Joseph McGuire.\n\nTrump blasted the impeachment move in a tweet moments after Pelosi finished speaking, saying \u201cSo bad for our Country!\u201d\n\nSuch an important day at the United Nations, so much work and so much success, and the Democrats purposely had to ruin and demean it with more breaking news Witch Hunt garbage. So bad for our Country! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2019\n\nSpeaking in New York at the United Nations Trump told reporters he withheld aid to Ukraine, but that the move wasn\u2019t used as leverage.\n\n\u201cThere was no quid pro quo,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThere was no pressure applied, nothing.\u201d\n\nNow read: Why Trump impeachment threat is suddenly rattling stock-market investors.\n\nPelosi has previously been reluctant to back impeachment, saying she preferred for Trump to be defeated in the 2020 election. She said she is directing the House committees already probing Trump to continue doing so under the \u201cumbrella of impeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\nEven if Trump were impeached by the House, a trial could be held in the Senate. With the Senate in Republican control, a case could be dismissed immediately.\n\nMore than half of the House\u2019s 235 Democrats support an impeachment investigation. However, that isn\u2019t enough for impeachment, which requires a simple majority of the entire House.\n\nU.S. stocks DJIA, -0.53% closed lower on Tuesday, amid reports that Pelosi would announce the impeachment inquiry.\n\nSee: S&P notches third straight loss after Trump criticizes China in U.N. speech, impeachment worries rise.", "description": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday announced an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, amid a growing drumbeat of criticism following reports...", "authors": ["Robert Schroeder", "White House Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR980_pelosi_ZG_20190924173722.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
