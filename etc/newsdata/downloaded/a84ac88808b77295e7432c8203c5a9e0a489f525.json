Banking stocks, in particular, took a big hit, with Nifty Bank index falling by 2.6% and Nifty PSU Bank index declining by an even bigger 3.5%.\n\nThere was a spate of bad news engulfing the banking sector mainly due to its exposure to the real estate sector. It started with Indiabulls (NS: ) shares declining by a whopping 34% yesterday after reports of accounting irregularities and siphoning off of own funds by the owners. Lakshmi Vilas Bank also declined by 5% as the RBI initiated prompt corrective action on the bank. Incidentally, LVLS is planning to merge with Indiabulls.\n\nInvestors\u2019 sentiments in the banking sector have already been soured by the news that after RBI reported that over two-thirds of the Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative Bank's assets were exposed to debt-ridden Housing Development (NS: ) and Infrastructure Ltd.\n\nYes Bank (NS: ) continued with its free-fall as the stock declined by a staggering 15% in yesterday\u2019s trade. There is a fear among investors that Yes Bank\u2019s outstanding exposure to real-estate companies like Indiabulls could further hurt the bank in the coming days. The stock tanked despite the news that RBI gave Yes Bank the permission to raise additional capital.\n\nTalking about some positive news, Airtel\u2019s stock was up by 5% in yesterday\u2019s trade on the news that it is exploring the option of selling its stake in tower infrastructure business to PE firms. This stake sale will help Airtel to raise funds to deleverage its balance sheet while it will also allow it to focus on its wireless business, especially the upcoming 5G technology.\n\nTalking about today, Nifty may come under pressure as the eight-core infrastructure index declined by 0.5% for the month of September. This metric had expanded by 4.7% in August, which indicates that it was a mere blip.", "description": "Shares Analysis by Investing.com (Puneet Sikka/Investing.com) covering: Nifty 50, Housing Development and Infrastructure Ltd, Yes Bank Ltd, Indiabulls Housing Finance Ltd.
