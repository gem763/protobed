Ahead of them, Mount, thriving at Chelsea and making his full debut, made just three.\n\nThat allowed the Czechs, who fell behind to Kane\u2019s fifth minute penalty but equalised three minutes later, to take charge. Home goalkeeper Tomas Vaclik didn\u2019t make a save until after the hour mark, but also the Czechs were, like Kosovo, too easily able to get at England\u2019s defence.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nVladimir Darida, operating in a similar role to Mount, floated in behind the Rice/Henderson combination too easily and picked up possession far too often.\n\nPatrick Schick, with just 27 minutes for RB Leipzig under his belt this term, similarly dropped off the front and picked up possession unchallenged too often, often down the inside right channel between Rice and Danny Rose.\n\n\"We tried something to make ourselves a bit more solid without the ball, and that didn't happen,\u201d said Southgate. \"We didn't look any more solid, and we were poor at using the ball in the first half.\"\n\nKeane\u2019s analysis of the England midfield was more fierce: \"They\u2019ve been really sloppy, Henderson and Rice \u2013 they might as well sit with us in the studio.\u201d\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nIn the second period, with a switch to 4-3-3, pushing Henderson higher, there was greater balance. The best chance the Three Lions had, in the 57th minute when Raheem Sterling went clean through, came after Henderson received possession in the final third from a Sterling pass, laid off for Kane who found Sterling again with a third-man run.\n\n\"I think we were better in the second half and we created chances to win the game,\u201d said Southgate.\n\nThat may have been true - they couldn\u2019t have created less to be honest - but they still lacked real clarity and control. There were still too many nothing balls hooked aimlessly down the channel and no real combinations in the middle third to spring through the Czech's own pairing of Tomas Soucek and Alex Kral.\n\nIn terms of players, Southgate spoke post-game about having to select players \"who are not playing well for their clubs\u201d.\n\nBut certainly you couldn\u2019t say that about Rice, one of West Ham\u2019s better players again this season.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nHowever, on a night where England struggled, his limitations were exposed in terms of building play from deep and grabbing the game by the scruff of the neck. It\u2019s easy to say with hindsight, but perhaps Harry Winks - the England midfielder with most passes in the Premier League this term (518) - would have been a smarter bet where getting on the ball and recycling possession is concerned.\n\nRice had just 44 touches and made only 36 passes of England\u2019s 496 total passes. He also failed to make a single successful tackle before being hooked after the second Czech goal; in stark contrast, he averages 3.8 tackles and 2.3 interceptions per game for West Ham in the Premier League this season.\n\nFor the winning goal, Rice was largely culpable.\n\nHe reacted slowly to Darida's run into the penalty area, and as the Czech captain attacked the six-yard box, Michael Keane moved to cover and cut out the cross - leaving Ondrasek free on the penalty spot to score from the cut-back.\n\n(Image: Wyscout SPA)\n\n(Image: Wyscout SPA)\n\n(Image: Wyscout SPA)\n\n\"It's clear we've got to improve without the ball, over a period of time,\" Southgate said. \"That hasn't surprised us.\n\n\"It's something we've spoken about all week, and we didn't get the reaction that we needed today but it's not a time for me to look at individuals.\n\n\"I've got to make sure that we get the team back on track for Monday and pick the right team.\u201d\n\nRice and Henderson are pillars around which Southgate will continue building as he looks towards Euro 2020.\n\nHowever, as Southgate continues to seek answers with regards finding the right balance, Friday night\u2019s experiment won\u2019t likely be repeated.", "description": "England suffered a first defeat in a meaningful qualifier for 10 years with a 2-1 loss to Czech Republic", "authors": ["Alex Richards", "Image", "Pa", "Michael Zemanek Bpi Rex", "Reuters", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Wyscout Spa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20565354.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Czech-Republic-v-England-UEFA-Euro-2020-Qualifying-Group-A-Football-Sinobo-Stadium-Prague-Czech.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
