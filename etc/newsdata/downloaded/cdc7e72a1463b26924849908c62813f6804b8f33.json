Every elected Republican supports Russia, Turkey, Syria, and Iran (and, apparently in this reality, the governments of Turkey and Syria \u2013 which routintely refer to each other as \u201c terrorists \u201d \u2013 cooperate with each other). The Saudis are bombing the Kurds. Saudis are going to hell for genocide. And, finally, deceased Sen. John McCain is ashamed of Sen. Graham for opposing Trump\u2019s troop withdrawal.\n\nThe reality on the ground, however, is far more complicated.\n\nRussia, Syria, and Iran are indeed in a coalition \u2014 one that the Kurdish-majority Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) just joined to attract Syrian Arab Army reinforcements at the Kurdistan border with Turkey. The Turkish government maintains friendly relations with Russia and Iran, but abhors the Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria. Through Russia, it agreed to a tentative plan not to invade several Kurdish towns on the Turkish border.\n\nErdogan\u2019s officials have openly stated they are seeking to displace the Kurdish population on the Syrian-Turkish border and replace it with Arab Syrian refugees, a textbook case of ethnic cleansing. The Trump administration has explicitly condemned that plan, however, has taken no actions to support it, and has threatened sanctions on Turkey if it continues to displace Kurds.\n\nPresident Trump has no legal authority to use American troops to protect the Syrian Kurdish population from the government of Turkey, a NATO ally Washington is treaty-bound to defend with its army. American troops are legally present in Syria only to fight the Islamic State, an offshoot of al-Qaeda. Congress gave the president permission to use troops to fight al-Qaeda anywhere in the world in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, jiahdist attacks.\n\nThere is no evidence of any Saudi military involvement in Syria \u2013 or in any of the other countries that contain the ancestral land of Kurdistan: Iraq, Iran, or Turkey.\n\nJerome Hudson is Breitbart News Entertainment Editor and author of the bestselling book 50 Things They Don\u2019t Want You to Know.
