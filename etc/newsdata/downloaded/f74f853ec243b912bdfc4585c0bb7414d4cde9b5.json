One possibility is that in preparing an article of impeachment on obstruction of Congress, Pelosi does not want to leave a crack open whereby Trump\u2019s lawyers would say, well, he had a good-faith belief the impeachment process was not officially underway.\n\nConstitutional scholar Laurence Tribe approves of Pelosi\u2019s move. \u201cThis resolution makes perfect sense now that the House leadership has wisely decided to forgo further judicial jockeying and to move expeditiously to public hearings,\u201d he argues. \u201cCalling the Trump administration\u2019s bluff this way will make it clear that the continued stonewalling of the administration \u2014 and of those current and former officials who use the administration\u2019s gag order as an excuse for seeking what amount to advisory judicial opinions on whether to comply with congressional subpoenas \u2014 is just a stalling tactic, not a good-faith effort to resolve conflicting obligations when confronted with a subpoena from Congress and a directive from the White House to defy that subpoena.\u201d\n\nTribe also underscores that the resolution does not \u201cauthorize\u201d impeachment but instead \u201caffirms\u201d it is underway. He says, \u201cBy taking that course, the speaker smartly avoids conceding that there was any infirmity in the inquiry prior to this authorization vote.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs Rocah did, Tribe points out that the decision from Judge Beryl Howell last week could always be appealed, so now is a good time to foreclose further litigation.\n\nFormer prosecutor Joyce White Vance concurs. \u201cDemocrats are increasingly cutting off the legal escape routes while developing the facts,\" she tells me.\n\nIn sum, fresh from a court win and sensing the Republicans are in disarray, Pelosi is not only willing but looking forward to taking the winds out of Republicans\u2019 sails. She conveys an aura of confidence and highlights progress made in the investigation. So what are the Republicans going to do once they cannot grouse about process? They might actually have to confront the unpleasant reality that the facts establish Trump committed impeachable conduct. It will be fascinating to see what they do then.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Pelosi moves the process along", "authors": ["Jennifer Rubin", "Opinion Writer Covering Politics", "Policy", "Foreign", "Opinion Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/vjCALgq-YuW1idFWFcSniNREzg4=/1440x0/smart/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/10-29-2019/t_88185f42140a4777a8fc206d9a66c5d7_name_1___1920x1080___30p_00_00_04_06_Still014.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
