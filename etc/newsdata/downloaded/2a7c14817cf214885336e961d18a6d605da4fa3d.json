Real-life photographer Daniel Cordero knows this all too well, especially when it came to taking a photo of Mario and a rabbit.\n\nThe idea for this shot came to Cordero during the six months he spent playing the popular Nintendo Switch game. He\u2019d snapped a lot of images in a lot of the game\u2019s worlds and thought it\u2019d be cool to get a particular shot in the game\u2019s jungle-themed Lost Kingdom.\n\nThat area includes a grey rabbit that wears a top hat and stands on a moving platform. Whenever Mario approaches, the rabbit hops away.\n\nCordero had an idea. He made Mario bump the rabbit and stun it, then moved Mario to a spot nearby as the rabbit recovered. Once the rabbit snapped out of its stupor and started hopping, Cordero made Mario jump.\n\nHe framed the shot perfectly. The two characters eclipse the yellow balloon of Mario\u2019s Odyssey airship. The resulting image is suitable for framing.\n\nCordero has spent a lot time snapping images in Super Mario Odyssey and has, as he explained to Kotaku in an interview, learned a lot about what it takes to be a good Mario world photographer.\n\nCordero has worked as a professional photographer for the last four years, focusing on weddings and other events in Mexico\u2019s Riviera Maya. He took on photography in Mario Odyssey as a way to sharpen his skills.\n\n\u201cWhile playing the [Super Mario Odyssey] campaign, I would take some screenshots here and there, and I liked that I could practice photography without leaving my room,\u201d Cordero explained. \u201cThat\u2019s when the idea of making a full album came to me. If I didn\u2019t have enough time to practice some photography outside, at least I could practice some from my room in a video game.\u201d\n\nOdyssey\u2019s photography mode omits a lot of the technical aspects of photography\u2014aperture, speed, lenses, and the like\u2014but more intangible aspects of the craft like lighting, posing, composition, and patience still come into play. It allowed Cordero to sharpen some of these skills while playing the game, then apply them in the real world.\n\nOne shot he\u2019s proud of involves Mario appearing to surf a wave of lava. In that image, Mario appears to be walking on the poison waves of the Lake Kingdom, but that\u2019s just a trick of perspective. \u201cThis shot was particularly hard even though it seems simple, because the \u2018ground\u2019 that Mario is standing on is actually that purple lava thing which makes you instantly lose your life when you touch it,\u201d Cordero explained. \u201cSo I had to take the screenshot at the right moment to make it look like Mario is walking on it. It was a lot of trial and error!\u201d\n\nCordero spent more time taking photos in Super Mario Odyssey than it took him to complete the game due to the meticulous way in which he approaches every shot. This meant scouting out every area at least twice, making note of interesting spots as well as those that could be made interesting by introducing an item or enemy. During this time, he realised that some characters react differently depending on which outfit Mario is wearing. The zombie costume, for instance, evokes looks of worry and fear from other characters, which helped him get a shot of Cappy eyeing Mario in distress from the background.\n\n\u201cIt was all a matter of exploring every different approach and trying to find the best angle for it to have a good composition, nice colours, a clean or interesting background and to have as little distractions as possible,\u201d he continued. \u201cThis included sometimes collecting all the coins or taking care of all the enemies in an area so they\u2019re not in the background of the shot. And of course, a lot of trial and error with the timing on the poses or jumps to get the perfect shot.\u201d\n\nA collage of four Cordero photos, two taken in the game, two taken in the outside world. (Photo: Daniel Cordero)\n\nSome of these shots are unconventional and evoke some of the more artsy photos he\u2019s taken of real-world subjects. \u201cI like to think they are a little bit more close to the kind of photography I do in real life, where I\u2019m very influenced by surrealism, juxtaposition of elements, and a sense of mystic wonder or adventure,\u201d Cordero said. \u201cIn real life, I have a more precise way of directing the emotion out of the subjects or for them to adopt expressions or actions. In Super Mario Odyssey, I had to do with what I had. Its snapshot mode is incredibly robust, but I still wish I could choose the poses, movements, and expressions of the characters even more.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just that rabbit in the Lost World that was hard to frame. Other wildlife, like the squirrels in the Mushroom Kingdom and the butterflies in Lost Kingdom, were tricky too. The former are so fast, Cordero found, that a lot of people didn\u2019t even know they were in Super Mario Odyssey. The latter aren\u2019t even 3D models but 2D textures that shift and disappear on a loop. Successfully photographing the butterflies involved finding a group that remained visible longer than the others and figuring out an angle that would capture as many of the insects as possible. From there, it was just a matter of trial and error\u2014a common theme in Cordero\u2019s process\u2014to get the shot he wanted.\n\nAnother particularly striking photo in Cordero\u2019s gallery features Mario casually sliding down the sleeping tyrannosaurus rex of the Cascade Kingdom. Cordero knew he wanted a photo of the iconic dinosaur after playing through Super Mario Odyssey, and he experimented with ways to incorporate it into a shot with Mario. What he ultimately decided on is what you see above, a photo that Cordero is proud of for its composition and the way its subjects contrast with the skyline behind them. The T-Rex also doesn\u2019t have perfect slopes like one would expect from the landscape, so getting Mario to slide down its back meant finding a specific area of its body that would guarantee the action pose and not appear disjointed.\n\nDue to his Mexican heritage, Cordero enjoyed the obvious Latino influences of the Sand Kingdom and spent a lot of time in the main hub of Tostarena Town. It\u2019s where players spend much of their time in the early portions of the game, after all, which made it the perfect place for Cordero to experiment with the snapshot mode. But by travelling elsewhere in search of more environments and subjects, he was able to explore the nooks and crannies of Super Mario Odyssey in a way that even the extensive main campaign doesn\u2019t encourage.\n\nCordero sees his work with Mario as an example of how new media and technology can open doors for art, advertising, and even teaching. He\u2019s even been approached by a couple who were so impressed by this project that they hired him to photograph their upcoming vacation to Canc\u00fan.\n\nHe looks forward to expanding his horizons in the future, perhaps with a similar foray into the world of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, although only with a 4K upgrade since he believes its native 900p resolution doesn\u2019t do that game justice. He only owns a Switch at the moment, but he\u2019s also interested in checking out games like Hellblade: Senua\u2019s Sacrifice and Dragon Quest XI, which have in-game photo modes, and The Witness, for which this is a third-party application that functions the same way, if the opportunity arises.\n\nDo yourself a favour and check out the rest of Cordero\u2019s Super Mario Odyssey photos here.", "description": "It\u2019s not easy to capture the perfect photo in Super Mario Odyssey\u2019s snapshot mode.
