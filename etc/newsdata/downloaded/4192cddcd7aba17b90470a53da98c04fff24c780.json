Every piece of meaningful action had Grealish dictating its direction, culminating in the moment in stoppage time when his quick feet and inventive mind fashioned a chance almost out of nothing for Matt Targett, his partner in creativity along the left flank, to score the winning goal. Targett, who had read Grealish\u2019s intentions, suddenly had a clear view of goal inside a heavily defended Brighton penalty area and made it count.\n\n\u201cJack did a lovely bit of skill,\u201d Targett said. \u201cI think he\u2019s done two people and played a lovely ball through. I was so happy it went in because it had been so frustrating in the second half.", "description": "Compared with the demolition of Norwich City that preceded the international break, Saturday\u2019s was a limp performance by Aston Villa, who might easily have been counting the cost of their shortcomings had Brighton kept a full complement of players.", "authors": ["Jon Culley", "Keith Hackett", "Sam Wallace"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/20/TELEMMGLPICT000213512846-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqeKwbNrcenAy0Vr1pEXoBGvbM4JQ3_8DinnhEIpXFGuA.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
