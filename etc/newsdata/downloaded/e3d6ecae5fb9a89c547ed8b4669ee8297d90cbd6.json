Federal revenues, he insisted, are \u201crolling in,\u201d while the budget deficit \u201cis coming down.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t coming down at the time, and it\u2019s certainly not coming down now. In the fiscal year that just wrapped up, as the Washington Post reported, the deficit hit $984 billion.\n\nThe U.S. government\u2019s budget deficit ballooned to nearly $1 trillion in 2019, the Treasury Department announced Friday, as America\u2019s fiscal imbalance widened for a fourth consecutive year despite a sustained run of economic growth. The deficit grew $205 billion, or 26 percent, in the past year. The country\u2019s worsening fiscal picture runs in sharp contrast to President Trump\u2019s campaign promise to eliminate the federal debt within eight years. The deficit is up nearly 50 percent in the Trump era. Since taking office, Trump has endorsed big spending increases and steered most Republicans to abandon the deficit obsession they held during the Obama administration.\n\nThe trend is likely to continue: the deficit will almost certainly top $1 trillion in 2020.\n\nCircling back to our earlier coverage, these aren\u2019t exactly the fiscal results Donald Trump promised the electorate before his election. As regular readers may recall, in February 2016, the future president appeared on Fox News and assured viewers that, if he were president, he could start paying off the national debt \u201cso easily.\u201d The Republican argued at the time that it would simply be a matter of looking at the country as \u201ca profit-making corporation\u201d instead of \u201ca losing corporation.\u201d\n\nA month later, in March 2016, Trump declared at a debate that he could cut trillions of dollars in spending by eliminating \u201cwaste, fraud, and abuse.\u201d Asked for a specific example, he said, \u201cWe\u2019re cutting Common Core.\u201d (Common Core is an education curriculum. It costs the federal government almost nothing.)\n\nA month after that, in April 2016, Trump declared that he was confident that he could \u201cget rid of\u201d the entire multi-trillion-dollar debt \u201cfairly quickly.\u201d Pressed to be more specific, the future president replied, \u201cWell, I would say over a period of eight years.\u201d\n\nBy July 2016, he boasted that once his economic agenda was in place, \u201cwe\u2019ll start paying off that debt like water.\u201d\n\nAs Catherine Rampell recently explained, \u201cFederal deficits have widened immensely under Trump\u2019s leadership. This is striking not only because he promised fiscal responsibility \u2013 at one time even pledging to eliminate the national debt within eight years \u2013 but also because it\u2019s a historical anomaly\u2026. Trump\u2019s own policies are to blame for this aberration.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s plainly true. The White House and congressional Republicans swore up and down in late 2017 that they could slash taxes for the wealthy and big corporations without increasing the deficit because, as they repeatedly insisted, \u201ctax cuts pay for themselves.\u201d We didn\u2019t need additional evidence that their ridiculous belief was, and is, wrong, but we have the evidence anyway.\n\nAs Paul Krugman added a couple of months ago, \u201c[T]he Trump tax cut caused a huge rise in the budget deficit, which the administration expects to hit $1 trillion this year, up from less than $600 billion in 2016. This tidal wave of red ink is even more extraordinary than it looks, because it has taken place despite falling unemployment, which usually leads to a falling deficit.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an important detail. Every time we discuss the deficit, I feel compelled to point out again that I\u2019m not a deficit hawk, and I firmly believe that larger deficits, under some circumstances, are absolutely worthwhile and necessary.\n\nThese are not, however, those circumstances. When the economy is in trouble, it makes sense for the United States to borrow more, invest more, cushion the blow, and help strengthen the economy.\n\nThe Trump White House and the Republican-led Congress, however, decided to approve massive tax breaks for the wealthy and big corporations when the economy was already healthy \u2013 not because they were addressing a policy need, but because they were fulfilling an ideological goal.\n\nThe results speak for themselves, though I put together the chart above to help drive the point home.
