In order to avoid an offset in benefits \u2013 known as the Widows Tax \u2013 surviving spouses can transfer some of the benefits to their children.\n\nUnder the previous law, those benefits were taxed at the same rate as what the surviving spouse was subject to. The new law taxes children\u2019s unearned income at the same rate as trusts and estates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe reform was intended to target wealthy children\u2019s unearned income as a way to prevent rich people from avoiding taxes.\n\nBut it raised the average tax rate children pay on the benefits to 37 percent, from around 12 percent or 15 percent, according to data from the Tragedy Assistance Program For Survivors (TAPS).\n\n\"Some families are having to pay more than double or triple the amount on their children's taxable income,\" Candace Wheeler, a senior advisor on policy and legislation for TAPS told FOX Business. \"Children of first responders are affected as well.\"\n\nOne mother told ABC News that taxes on her son\u2019s benefits rose to $4,500, from around $1,000.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve not found anybody who either intentionally did it in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act or is opposing this on deficit grounds or anything like that,\u201d Retired Army Brig. Gen. Michael Meese told FOX Business. \u201cThey did not anticipate that this would be the implication.\u201d\n\nA House version of the Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement (SECURE) Act \u2013 a retirement reform bill \u2013 includes a provision that would treat certain military survivor benefits as earned income for the purposes of the kiddie tax.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nThe bill was passed by the House of Representatives nearly unanimously in May. It has not made much progress in the Senate.\n\nAs previously reported by FOX Business, lawmakers are also asking Congress to repeal the Military Widows Tax.", "description": "Families are pushing lawmakers to advance a fix.", "authors": ["Brittany De Lea"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/03/0/0/US-military-ap1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
