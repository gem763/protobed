Celebration of violence and conspiracy theories about the \u2018ethnic replacement\u2019 of whites\u2026 are prominent in their online circles.\u201d\n\nActing Homeland Security Director Kevin McAleenan released the new strategy document in an address at the Brookings Institute. He acknowledged that the First Amendment limits the government\u2019s ability to counter online communities like 8chan that \u201cprovide individuals who might be disaffected or angry with validation,\u201d and called for the private sector to refuse service to such sites.\n\nThe candid assessment of the domestic terror threat is a new look for DHS. The department has been turning away from right-wing extremism since 2009, when an internal DHS analysis on the topic leaked in conservative media and set off a political firestorm with Republican lawmakers. In recent years, escalating right-wing violence became harder to ignore, but the Trump White House kept up pressure on DHS to stay focused on border security and radical Islam, according to a CNN report last month. Those issues dovetail with the themes of Donald Trump\u2019s reelection campaign. But as DHS acknowledged Friday, lone domestic terrorists \u201chave caused more deaths in the United States in recent years\u201d than foreign groups. The department finally mobilized on Aug. 3, when the mass shooting in El Paso, Texas claimed 22 lives.\n\nDHS in a \u2018Mad Scramble\u2019 to Catch Up With Domestic Terror\n\n\u201cIn an age of online radicalization to violent extremism and disparate threats, we must not only counter foreign enemies trying to strike us from abroad, but also those enemies, foreign and domestic, that seek to spur to violence our youth and our disaffected\u2014encouraging them to strike in the heart of our Nation, and attack the unity of our vibrant, diverse American society,\u201d the DHS report reads, emphasizing the \u201cand\u201d in \u201cforeign and domestic\u201d with italics.\n\nThe new strategy \u201cprovides a substantive framework for how the department and the nation can organize itself to combat this threat,\u201d said John Cohen, the former deputy under secretary for intelligence and analysis at DHS. Cohen notes that foreign terrorist groups are targeting the same reserve of angry, disaffected men. But he worries that the new strategy will be a dead letter under Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cThere's a serious question whether the department will receive the support or funding necessary to implement this strategy,\u201d Cohen told the Daily Beast. \u201cIt would divert from Trump administration priorities, which have focused singularly on immigration and border enforcement.\u201d\n\nDHS Official: Trump Can\u2019t Admit \u2018This Is Terrorism\u2019\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGot a tip?
