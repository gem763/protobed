But OneVoice used the money to build a voter database, train activists and hire a political consulting firm with ties to President Obama\u2019s campaign \u2014 all of which set the stage for an anti-Netanyahu campaign, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations said in a bipartisan staff report.\n\nIn one stunning finding, the subcommittee said OneVoice even told the State Department\u2019s top diplomat in Jerusalem of its plans in an email, but the official, Consul General Michael Ratney, claims never to have seen them.\n\nHe said he regularly deleted emails with large attachments \u2014 a striking violation of open-records laws for a department already reeling from former Secretary Hillary Clinton\u2019s handling of official government records.\n\nMr. Netanyahu survived the election, and the U.S. spending was not deemed illegal because the State Department never put any conditions on the money. Investigators also said OneVoice didn\u2019t turn explicitly political until days after the grant period ended.\n\n\u201cThe State Department ignored warnings signs and funded a politically active group in a politically sensitive environment with inadequate safeguards,\u201d said Sen. Rob Portman, chairman of the investigative subcommittee. \u201cIt is completely unacceptable that U.S. taxpayer dollars were used to build a political campaign infrastructure that was deployed \u2014 immediately after the grant ended \u2014 against the leader of our closest ally in the Middle East. American resources should be used to help our allies in the region, not undermine them.\u201d\n\nPHOTOS: Famous felons\n\nSen. Claire McCaskill, the ranking Democrat on the subcommittee, said the Obama administration followed the law.\n\nBut she said their investigation exposed \u201cdeficiencies\u201d in the State Department\u2019s policies.\n\nOneVoice had been politically active in Israel\u2019s 2013 elections, which should have been a red flag to U.S. officials to put strict controls on how American taxpayers\u2019 money was spent, the investigation said.\n\nWhile it wouldn\u2019t have necessarily disqualified the group, the State Department should have written a specific prohibition against using American money to influence a foreign election, the subcommittee said.\n\nIt\u2019s part of a pattern of bad behavior at the State Department. The Government Accountability Office reviewed more than five dozen department grants and found officials cut corners and missed red flags in 80 percent of them.\n\nThe Israeli Embassy didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on the findings.\n\nState Department spokesman John Kirby said they had not had time to go through the report and he couldn\u2019t comment on it. He also didn\u2019t comment on Mr. Ratney\u2019s practice of deleting official records.\n\nThe Senate investigation found that the State Department funded two sister groups \u2014 OneVoice Israel and OneVoice Palestine \u2014 to hire a U.S. political consulting firm, recruit volunteers, build a social media network and run advertising.\n\nBut it was also building its anti-Netanyahu political strategy, at a time when the Israeli leader was quite controversial in U.S. politics, celebrated by Republicans but feuding with the Obama White House over differences in policy.\n\nOneVoice told at least two State Department officials of its political plans, even as it was collecting taxpayer money. But the department \u201ctook no action in response,\u201d the subcommittee concluded.\n\nMr. Ratney, one of the two officials, said he remembered getting an email from OneVoice, but didn\u2019t recall seeing the attached file detailing the group\u2019s political strategy.\n\nThe State Department was unable to recover the email, but investigators got it from OneVoice.\n\nMr. Ratney later told investigators he regularly deleted emails with attachments \u201cin order to maintain my inbox under the storage limit.\u201d He told investigators he \u201cdid not know [he] was required to archive routine emails.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
