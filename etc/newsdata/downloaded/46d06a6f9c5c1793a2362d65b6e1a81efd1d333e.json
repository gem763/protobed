New York Fashion Week SS20: Best street style 1/33 Zebra print is swiftly taking over from leopard's longstanding reign in the animal print realm. Here, this guest wears hers on a tailored jacket paired with thigh-high black boots. Getty Images 2/33 This look is giving us all the 1980s feels. Slinky purple wrap dress? Tick. Oversized wide-brimmed hat? Tick. Overall retro excellence? Absolutely.

Getty Images 11/33 This guest paired her scarlet mum jeans with a sheer tie-up shirt black lace-up shoes and cat-eye shades. Getty Images 12/33 When the pattern is as eye-catching as this one, it's wise to strip back one's look in other areas, like this street styler has done by pairing her high-waisted trousers with a simple white crochet top and blazer. The yellow loop handle bag adds a splash of vibrancy. Getty Images 13/33 A classic black polo neck top is always going to be a sartorial winner, especially when it's tucked into high-waisted jeans and accessorised with simple silver jewellery.

The stylish showgoer opted for a pair of white high-waisted jeans worn with matching trainers, a boxy yellow T-shirt and black YSL crossbody bag.

This attendee accessorised her look with a striped bumbag and sculptural heels. Getty Images 18/33 More is more when it comes to monochrome, as this street styler proves. The fashion week goer didn't hold back, wearing two-tone stripes on everything from her gown to her hat and sunglasses.

The street styler finished her look by wearing her hair in a super-high pony tail. Getty Images 22/33 If you\u2019re going to attend one of the most coveted fashion events of the year, you might as well make a strong impression while doing so.

Getty Images 23/33 Paired with a striking yellow head scarf, Louis Vuitton bag and flat sandals, this fashionista looked every inch a style queen in her striped midi dress.

Getty Images 27/33 Leopard print is continuing to reign supreme in the fashion world. This guest donned a printed shirt with pinstripe trousers and brown loafers. Getty Images 28/33 This street style star offset a pair of printed wide-leg trousers with a navy tailored jacket, nude sandals and over-the-shoulder bag. Getty Images 29/33 This guest made a bold statement on the streets of New York in a python print two-piece. She was accompanied by a friend wearing a modish tailored jacket with capri pants and kitten heels. Getty Images 30/33 Neutral tones show no sign of going out of fashion and this is a sentiment clearly shared by this fashion expert. The guest paired a midi-length python-print skirt with tan-coloured boots and a cream bodysuit. Getty Images 31/33 Dressing in one colour simply never goes out of fashion when it\u2019s done right. This guest proved just how to pull off a look that lacks colour, wearing white denim jeans with a matching vest top and studded belt.

Paired here with black sunglasses and a pink bucket bag, there's no stopping this savvy street styler. Getty Images\n\nAll of the Instagram moments\n\nFew fashion fans can forget the pivotal moment when Jodie Comer stomped across our TV screens in a frothy candyfloss-coloured gown. In the role of Villanelle, the Killing Eve actor accessorised her look with chunky black biker boots and a signature scowl. It made quite the impression. So much so, that designer Molly Goddard has become one of the most anticipated London Fashion Week shows ever since, with editors and influencers rushing to marvel at the Central Saint Martins graduate\u2019s latest frou frou offerings. Last season, these included several tiered tulle gowns that came in neons, blacks and creams. But the showstopper was a devastingly dramatic fuchsia gown that featured so much tulle it almost tickled the toes of those on front row.\n\nMeanwhile, British accessories maverick Anya Hindmarch is back with yet another playful runway, having previously entertained attendees with sets featuring chubby bean bag clouds and a giant woven tunnel. This season, Hindmarch will display her spring/summer 2020 collection in an immersive scarlet maze built inside Soho\u2019s Brewer Street Car Park. We can see the selfies already #mazelife.\n\nFashion fans are finally granted an invite\n\nIn a Fashion Week first, people can now buy tickets to the bi-annual event. While the BFC has previously hosted an additional ticketed event for the public, named London Fashion Week Festival, this September marks the first time that on-schedule designers will invite people to see their collections alongside industry insiders. Instead of putting on a single runway as usual, brands including AlexaChung, House of Holland and Self Portrait will host sessions across two days consisting of a catwalk show and a talk led by industry leaders.\n\nStandard tickets cost \u00a3135 and entitle guests to a complimentary drink and access to the BFC\u2019s Positive Fashion Designer Exhibition in addition to access to the catwalk show and the corresponding talk. Those who want something extra special can pay \u00a3245 for all of the above in addition to access to a VIP lounge and a front row seat at the catwalk show. Full details can be found here.\n\nInstagram\u2019s hottest label gets a pop-up shop\n\nRixo is fast becoming one of those brands that even people who know nothing about fashion will have heard of. You might\u2019ve seen its slinky leopard print gowns at weddings this summer, or spotted its retro swimwear making a statement on a sun lounger near you. You\u2019ll undoubtedly have noticed at least one Rixo piece on your Instagram feed in recent months, thanks to its loyal selfie-taking fan base, which includes influencers, models and Vogue editors. Even Girls writer Lena Dunham is a fan of the British brand, having worn its Rosemarie dress to Wimbledon in July.\n\nWe can\u2019t wait to see what Rixo has in store for spring/summer 2020; a collection they say will be inspired by the flower power haze of the 1970s (think whimsical Woodstock). Fans will also be able to shop the collection immediately after its presentation on Saturday by heading to Rixo\u2019s pop-up shop located at 94 King\u2019s Road\n\nHow will the sartorial become political?\n\nFashion is not afraid to get political. And in these increasingly precarious times, designers are becoming more outspoken than ever before, often using their catwalks as their very own Speakers\u2019 Corner. Naturally, Brexit and the possibility of crashing out of the EU with no deal has become a primary concern, with the BFC saying the latter could cost the fashion industry up to \u00a3900m. Will the fashion industry voice its fears on the runway this season?\n\nIt\u2019s likely that Vivienne Westwood will have something to say given her on-catwalk protest last season, which saw models and activists pontificate about the consequences of climate change and the economic ramifications of Brexit. We\u2019ll also be looking at British brands with European creative directors, think Burberry\u2019s Riccardo Tisci, who hails from Taranto, Italy, who may choose to celebrate European culture through their collections as the UK waves goodbye to its EU membership. Anything is possible.\n\nThe spotlight will shine on diversity\n\nDiversity has been a consistent talking point in previous fashion weeks, with designers making a conscious effort to cast models of varying body shapes and ethnicities. In New York, we saw plus-size models at various shows including Chromat and Marc Jacobs. Elsewhere, we saw double amputee Daisy-May Demetre walk the runway for luxury children\u2019s label, Lulu et Gigi.\n\nHow will London compare? For the last few seasons, body positivity activists have protested outside key shows over the lack of representation on British runways. Simone Rocha stood out last season for sending models of varied ages and body types down the runway in her princess-like gowns. But Rocha was an anomaly amid a roster of designers who seldom stray from the norm of casting whippet thin models under the age of 23. Here\u2019s hoping for more diversity for spring/summer 2020.\n\nExtinction Rebellion will shake things up with swarms and funeral marches\n\nThe activists are calling for the BFC to cancel London Fashion Week altogether in a bid to address the environmental consequences of consumption and fast fashion.\n\nExpect on-street protests \u2013 or \u201cswarms\u201d as the organisation calls them \u2013 to be taking place outside shows this season.\n\nExtinction Rebellion\u2019s Fashion Week activity will culminate with a \u201cFuneral March\u201d on Tuesday as a way of bidding goodbye to London Fashion Week for good as the group urges the BFC to replace the event with a bi-annual summit to address the fashion industry\u2019s role in the ongoing climate crisis. Stay up to date with the group\u2019s plans on their Facebook page.", "description": "London Fashion Week returns on Friday to celebrate the nation\u2019s most esteemed design talents.
