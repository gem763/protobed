It is present in some foods and in water supplies but is not expected to cause harm when ingested in very low levels.\n\nThe MHRA has asked manufacturers to quarantine all products which may contain the active pharmaceutical ingredient that is potentially affected by this issue.\n\nThe four in the recall are made by GlaxoSmithKline.\n\nOver-the-counter products (Zantac 75 Relief (PL 02855/0081 [GSL]) and Zantac 75 Tablets (PL 02855/0082 [P]), which people can buy in pharmacies without a prescription, are produced by a different company and are not affected by the recall.\n\nThe MHRA is investigating other ranitidine medicines which may also be affected and will provide updates soon.\n\nShould I be concerned?\n\nCurrently, there is no evidence that medicines containing this type of impurity have caused any harm to patients, say experts.\n\nDr Andrew Gray, from the MHRA, said: \"Whilst this action is precautionary, the MHRA takes patient safety very seriously.\n\n\"We have asked companies to quarantine batches of potentially affected medicines whilst we investigate and we will take action as necessary, including product recalls where appropriate.\n\n\"We have also requested risk assessments from the relevant companies which will include the testing of potentially affected batches.\"", "description": "Doctors are being told stop prescribing four types of Zantac, also known as ranitidine, as a \"precaution\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/36E6/production/_109145041_hi056622854.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
