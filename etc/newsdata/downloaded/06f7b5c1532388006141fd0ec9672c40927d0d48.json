The American soldiers could only watch from their sandbag-lined walls. Orders from Washington were simple: Hands off. Let the Kurds fight for themselves.\n\nThe orders contradicted the American military\u2019s strategy in Syria over the past four years, especially when it came to the Kurdish fighters, known as the Y.P.G., who were integral to routing the Islamic State from northeastern Syria. The Kurds had fought in Manbij, Raqqa and deep into the Euphrates River Valley, hunting the last Islamic State\u2019s fighters in the group\u2019s now defunct physical caliphate. But the Syrian Democratic Forces, or S.D.F., as the Kurdish and their allied Arab fighters on the ground are called, are being left behind.\n\nAmerican Special Forces and other troops had built close ties with their Kurdish allies, living on the same dusty compounds, sharing meals and common dangers. They fought side by side, and helped evacuate Kurdish dead and wounded from the battlefield.\n\n\u201cWhen they mourn, we mourn with them,\u201d Gen. Joseph L. Votel, a former head of the military\u2019s Central Command, said on Thursday at the Middle East Institute.\n\nThe Kurdish forces and American military have survived previous strains, including President Trump\u2019s sudden decision in December to withdraw all American troops from northern Syria, a decision that was later walked back somewhat.\n\nThis time may be different, and irreversible. \u201cIt would seem at this particular point, we\u2019ve made it very, very hard for them to have a partnership relationship with us because of this recent policy decision,\u201d General Votel said.", "description": "As Turkish forces cross into Kurdish areas of northern Syria, the orders from Washington to U.S. troops are simple: Stand back.
