Trump was briefed at the time on the operation.\n\nThe U.S. government believes Hamza, who is thought to have been about 30 years old, had succeeded his father as the head of what remains of al Qaeda, the official said. Osama bin Laden was killed by U.S. forces in 2011.\n\nHamza was at his father\u2019s side in Afghanistan before the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States. He also spent time with his father in Pakistan after the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan pushed much of al Qaeda\u2019s senior leadership there, according to the Brookings Institution.\n\nThe U.S. State Department designated Hamza a global terrorist in 2017 after he called for acts of terrorism in Western capitals and threatened to take revenge against the United States for killing his father.\n\nFILE PHOTO - A photograph circulated by the U.S. State Department\u2019s Twitter account to announce a $1 million USD reward for al Qaeda key leader Hamza bin Laden, son of Osama bin Laden, is seen March 1, 2019. State Department/Handout via REUTERS\n\nReuters reported on July 31 that U.S. officials believed Hamza had been killed. But Trump\u2019s statement represented the first time the U.S. government had confirmed the operation.\n\nIt was unclear why the White House decided to publicize information about Hamza\u2019s death months after he was killed.\n\nThe State Department and Office of the Director of National Intelligence did not respond to requests for comment.", "description": "Hamza bin Laden, a son of slain al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and himself a notable figure in the militant group, was killed in a U.S. counterterrorism operation, President Donald Trump said on Saturday.", "authors": ["Christopher Bing", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190914&t=2&i=1429813654&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8D0D4", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
