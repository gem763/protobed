They are concerned that leaving it later would mean many university students have gone home - and might not be registered in the right place to vote.\n\nThey are also nervous that Mr Johnson might do a U-turn and decide to try to bring back the Bill.\n\nDecember 11: A Number 10 floated this as a potential compromise this morning.\n\nBut ministers have said the earlier timetable is not possible as the Bill must go through by the end of Thursday, and other laws need to be passed for Northern Ireland. It is thought Labour could back the compromise date.\n\nWhat does this mean for Brexit?\n\nThe EU yesterday granted the UK a three month delay, making time for an election to take place.\n\nIf MPs vote today for a snap poll then the Brexit process will effectively be paused until a new batch of MPs has been elected.\n\nIf Mr Johnson wins a majority at the election he will proceed with his Brexit deal. If Mr Corbyn wins a majority he would hold a second referendum.\n\nIf Ms Swinson wins a majority she would revoke Article 50 and cancel Brexit.\n\nWhat has Jeremy Corbyn said today and why has he changed his mind?\n\nYesterday Mr Corbyn outlined his opposition to a poll on December 12 as he said that 'in parts of the country it will be dark before 4pm' while 'many students will have just finished their terms and gone home for Christmas'.\n\nBut he hinted the party could sign up to a slightly earlier date of December 9. He then instructed Labour MPs to abstain on a vote calling for an election on December 12.\n\nMr Johnson needed to win the support of two thirds of MPs to succeed - 434 - but he only secured the backing of 299.\n\nMr Corbyn then changed his mind this morning as he told the shadow cabinet that Labour would now support an election on the basis that a No Deal Brexit had been ruled out for the next three months.\n\nHe said: 'I have consistently said that we are ready for an election and our support is subject to a No Deal Brexit being off the table.\n\n'We have now heard from the EU that the extension of Article 50 to 31st January has been confirmed, so for the next three months, our condition of taking No Deal off the table has now been met.\n\n'We will now launch the most ambitious and radical campaign for real change our country has ever seen.'\n\nBoris Johnson, pictured in the Commons yesterday, will ask MPs to vote for an early election for the fourth time this afternoon\n\nMr Johnson wants an election to be held on December 12 but Jo Swinson favours a polling day of December 9\n\nSo is a general election definitely going to happen before Christmas?\n\nAssuming that the four main parties can agree a date today then the answer is yes.\n\nIt would be astonishing if the Tories, Labour, Lib Dems and SNP all agree that they want an election only for the poll to fall apart due to a disagreement over a few days.\n\nHowever, given the volatility of British politics and the levels of distrust between the parties it is possible.\n\nWould the three extra days between December 9 and December 12 actually make much difference?\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, no. But there is some suggestion the Lib Dems and Labour would prefer an earlier poll because more students would be at university, potentially handing the opposition parties an advantage.\n\nHowever many major universities finish for Christmas on Friday, December 13.\n\nMs Swinson is also concerned Mr Johnson could try to bring his Brexit Bill back and rush it through before polling day. But that was effectively ruled out by No 10.\n\nDoes Boris Johnson need the support of two thirds of MPs to trigger the election today?\n\nNo. The government's three previous failed attempts to force an election were tabled under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011.\n\nThat law dictates that those kinds of motions must secure the backing of two thirds of MPs to succeed.\n\nBut today the government is seeking support for a draft bill. Votes on legislation only require a simple majority to succeed.\n\nCould amendments derail the election push?\n\nThe government has tried to make the election bill watertight to prevent MPs trying to add on proposals or requirements that could derail the legislation - like votes at 16.\n\nAssuming the government's tight drafting has been successful such amendments are unlikely to be allowed.\n\nWhat happened in the Commons last night?\n\nMPs voted by 299 votes to 70 in favour of a general election on December 12, but failed to deliver the two thirds majority required under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act.\n\nLabour abstained after Mr Corbyn issued a rambling explanation of why he was opposed to an election \u2013 including that it would be \u2018too dark\u2019. Mr Johnson accused him of \u2018running away from the judgment of the people\u2019.\n\nWhat is Number 10's view of all of this?\n\nDowning Street sources suggested that the Prime Minister might be prepared to compromise, by suggesting a \u2018range\u2019 of dates were possible between December 9 and 12.\n\nBut a decision has to be made quickly. If the early election bill doesn\u2019t get through the Commons today then the pre-Christmas election is effectively off.\n\nMinisters cannot go any later than December 12 because they risk running into the Christmas period.\n\nCabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill has warned that December 12 is the latest possible date or the election would mean turfing pantomimes, parties and nativity plays out of village halls and schools used as polling stations.\n\nWhat about the Brexit Withdrawal Bill?\n\nNo 10 says the legislation to take Britain out of the European Union is dead until after the election.\n\nSources suggested the Prime Minister would have been prepared to bring the Bill back this week if Labour pro-leave MPs agreed to back it through the Commons.
