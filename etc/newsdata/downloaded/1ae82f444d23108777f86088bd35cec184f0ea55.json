He also may have to make restitution payments to Georgetown.\n\nIn an August letter asking for leniency, he said \u201cfoolish ambition\u201d motivated him to make his son happy, and while he said he takes \u201ctotal and full\u201d responsibility, he said Singer manipulated him into joining the scheme.\n\n\u201cLooking back, I can see that Rick Singer worked me over and got me to do and believe things I am ashamed of and deeply regret,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI wanted the future for my son that he had worked so hard for. This was the main factor in my bad judgment.\u201d\n\nSemprevivo was accused of paying Singer\u2019s sham charity $400,000 in exchange for him to bribe Georgetown tennis coach Gordon Ernst to recruit Semprevivo\u2019s son and other children in the scandal as athletes. Singer has pleaded guilty while Mr. Ernst has pleaded not guilty.\n\nSemprevivo\u2019s son has since been expelled from Georgetown.\n\nProsecutors recommended 13 months of imprisonment and an additional $95,000 fine for Semprevivo because he didn\u2019t take full responsibility.\n\nHis lawyers asked for probation or home confinement and 2,000 hours of community service, claiming jail time would harm his family because his son has medical issues and would be \u201cnegatively impacted\u201d by Semprevivo\u2019s absence.\n\nEarlier this month, actress Felicity Huffman was sentenced to 14 days in prison for paying $15,000 for her daughter\u2019s SAT score to be boosted while Los Angeles business executive Devin Sloane received four months in prison this week for paying $250,000 to get his son recruited to University of Southern California as a water polo player.\n\nWhile 15 people have pleaded guilty, including Huffman and Sloane, 19 others are attempting to fight the charges in court.\n\nTwo of those parents, \u201cFuller House\u201d star Lori Loughlin and husband Mossimo Giannulli, are accused of shelling out $500,000 for their two daughters to be admitted to the University of Southern California as members of the crew team, although neither girl participated in the sport.\n\nMs. Loughlin and Mr. Giannulli have declined their right to separate attorneys and are scheduled to appear in court Oct. 2.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
