No, Team Trump says, because a president can\u2019t be investigated. Follow legal precedent related to grand jury testimony during impeachment proceedings? No, Team Trump says, because the president operates above the law. Cooperate with a congressional impeachment inquiry? No, Team Trump says, because a president can pick and choose which legal processes he deems legitimate.\n\nWith this in mind, White House Counsel Pat Cipollone wrote a ridiculous letter to congressional leaders yesterday, effectively making the case that the president considers the ongoing impeachment proceedings \u201cunconstitutional\u201d and has therefore decided to defy lawmakers\u2019 efforts to hold him accountable. Walter Shaub, the former director of the Office of Government Ethics, told Roll Call that Cipollone\u2019s letter is \u201cborderline hysterical,\u201d adding, \u201cCipollone would rip up the Constitution and make impeachment subject to presidential consent.\u201d\n\nShaub, now a senior adviser at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), went on to say, in reference to the White House counsel\u2019s bizarre argument, \u201cIts underlining assumption, that the executive must consent to an impeachment inquiry, mistakes Trump for a king.\u201d\n\nNeal Katyal, the former acting U.S. solicitor general, drew a similar conclusion, noting on Twitter that Cipollone is \u201csaying in effect\u201d that the American president is \u201ca king.\u201d\n\nNew York\u2019s Adam K. Raymond noted a related argument that unfolded on Fox News soon after.\n\nOn Tuesday\u2019s episode of Fox News\u2019 The Ingraham Angle, Joseph diGenova did what Giuliani hasn\u2019t. The lawyer and ardent Trump fan appeared on the show right next to Giuliani, when he called the impeachment proceedings against Trump \u201cregicide.\u201d \u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing is regicide,\u201d said diGenova\u2026. \u201cThis is regicide by another name, fake impeachment.\u201d\n\nIf that name sounds familiar, it\u2019s because last year Trump decided to hire Joe diGenova, a far-right conspiracy theorist and frequent Fox News guest, to help defend him from the investigation into the Russia scandal. They parted ways seven days later.\n\nI suppose it\u2019s possible that the Republican lawyer isn\u2019t altogether clear what \u201cregicide\u201d means, and perhaps his ignorance led him to use it incorrectly. Joe diGenova may not know, for example, that the word refers to murdering a king, which doesn\u2019t seem to make any sense in this context \u2013 since impeachment is not murder, and Trump is not royalty.\n\nThe alternative, of course, is that diGenova knows what the term means and he considers the president to be an actual king.", "description": "One of Trump's diehard supporters equated impeachment with \"regicide.\" Best case scenario: he doesn't know what \"regicide\" means.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/trump_gop_redline_072117.jpg?itok=xBa7aP70", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
