Arriving on the scene, we found the whale moving swiftly at about 5 knots and entangled in two wraps of fishing rope around her body and trailing fishing rope attached to two flotation buoys,\" the NSRI said in a statement.\n\nVolunteers moved to free the whale by first slowing the whale down and then cutting the whale free from the rope.\n\n\"Using a rescue knife, our SAWDN volunteers cut one rope free of the whale and then pulled on a remaining rope entangled around the body of the whale - that rope came free and all rope and the flotation buoys were recovered,\" said the NSRI.\n\nNumber of deaths\n\nThe whole operation took around two and a half hours and the whale breached once freed.\n\nAccording to the International Whaling Commission, it is estimated that more than 300 000 whales and dolphins die each year as a result of entanglement.\n\nA female whale was rescued.
