His first location was in Foxboro, Massachusetts, where the Patriots play their home games.\n\nAt 42-years old, Brady shows no signs of slowing down. The six-time Super Bowl champion, despite being the current oldest starting quarterback in the NFL, has made the Pro Bowl every year since 2009. The industry continues to show impressive growth, with the likes of Gold\u2019s Gym boasting record numbers last year and over $1.6 billion in investments made to fitness start-ups in 2018.\n\nAt the opening of his TB12 facility in Boston, he spoke with Fox Business Network\u2019s Jackie DeAngelis about training and his dedication to fitness.\n\n\u201cEverything matters. It matters how you think, it matters how you eat, it matters how much you drink, how much you sleep. How you work out, how you recover.\" - Tom Brady, New England Patriots quarterback\n\n\u201cAnd I think when you add all those things up, the cumulative effect of all those positives has allowed me to do something I love to do, which is play football,\" Brady told FOX Business.\n\nBrady has no plans to stop at just two markets. Plans are in place for expansion to other major markets with DeAngelis reporting that facilities are in the works for New York and Los Angeles. TB12 might go international at some point as well. The industry is certainly trending in a positive direction, making this a good investment for Brady.\n\nAnd Brady fans who want to work out like the star quarterback or those simply looking for a new fitness plan don\u2019t have to be within driving distance of his two centers to train like Brady. Workout plans, supplements and workout gear like powerbands are for sale through the TB12 website as well. There is even an app.\n\nIt is a business that is also rewarding, Brady said.\n\n\u201cCreating this business is providing people with a lot of solutions and I think there have been so many gratifying stories that I\u2019ve gotten back over the last six years of how we\u2019ve changed their life, of how we\u2019ve given them their life back when they had not a lot of hope,\u201d Brady said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t get to do the things they love to do. They didn\u2019t play with their kids and see their grandkids. I think people now are starting to realize what we provide here has incredible value, it\u2019s an incredible service.\u201d", "description": "Tom Brady opens a new training facility which he says is an extension of his passion for working out and a healthy lifestyle.", "authors": ["Kristian Dyer"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/tom-brady-AP-02.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
