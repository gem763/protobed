She had, quite simply, one of the most beautiful voices in the world, distinctive in its range, glorious tonal warmth, range and power, which enabled her to encompass a wide repertory, which she very much made her own.\n\nHere are 10 video clips drawn from the many performances and recordings that form her legacy. Everyone has their own memories of her artistry, their own private playlists of her work. This list is by no means definitive, and I\u2019m aware of how much I\u2019ve had to omit.\n\nStrauss\u2019s Ariadne was arguably Norman\u2019s greatest operatic role, and at her peak few could match her in it. A televised performance from the Met in 1988, this captures the majesty and exaltation of her singing at its finest.\n\nNorman\u2019s 1983 recording of the Four Last Songs with Kurt Masur and the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, grand in approach yet deeply heartfelt, is deemed as definitive by many.\n\nIn 1969, at the start of her career, Norman was a lovely, dignified Countess on Colin Davis\u2019s first recording of Mozart\u2019s Marriage of Figaro.\n\nNorman recorded Wagner\u2019s song cycle twice, with pianist Irwin Gage in 1970, then the orchestral version, again with Colin Davis, in 1975. The latter is notably beautiful and reflective, the former perhaps more intense and incisive. Both are included here.\n\nThe richness of Norman\u2019s lower registers enabled her to sing both mezzo-soprano and soprano roles. As a mezzo, she gave a magnificent performance of Das Lied von der Erde at the 1985 Proms, conducted by the young Simon Rattle.\n\nNorman was also very much associated with the alto solos in Mahler\u2019s Second Symphony. This, however, is her extraordinarily touching performance of the original piano version of Urlicht, which Mahler later orchestrated to form the symphony\u2019s fourth movement.\n\n\n\nStravinsky\u2019s Jocasta, in Oedipus rex, was another of Norman\u2019s finest operatic roles. She recorded it twice, but it\u2019s the film of her performance in Julie Taymor\u2019s stylised 1992 Saito Kinen festival production that lingers most strongly in the memory.\n\nBrahms\u2019s elegiac Op 91 songs for alto, piano and viola suited Norman down to the ground. Here, she\u2019s joined by Daniel Barenboim and violist Wolfram Christ in the first of them, its mood of refined melancholy immaculately sustained.\n\nNorman also possessed a fine gift for comedy, and in 1985 recorded Offenbach\u2019s delightfully risqu\u00e9 operetta La Belle H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, with Michel Plasson and his Toulouse orchestra, scaling down her generous tone and having fun with all the double entendres.\n\nNorman grew up in Augusta, Georgia, in segregationist times and was singing gospel songs in church by the time she was four. Later, spirituals often formed an integral part of her recital programmes, and her 1991 Carnegie Hall performance of Deep River is beautiful and poignant in the extreme.", "description": "Tim Ashley picks 10 performances that reveal the best of the singer\u2019s extraordinary talent and charisma", "authors": ["Tim Ashley"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75d5b610e41397a3cb054019fcfc46057aac9da0/0_87_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=757e629db09da41b21a15194939e9172", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
