It dropped out of Spain\u2019s blue-chip index last December.\n\nIt shares fell a further 3.4% in early trading on Monday.\n\nDIA said last week it had decided to keep the cosmetics store chain Clarel, rowing back on moves by its previous management to sell the unit.\n\nChief Executive Karl-Heinz Holland, former head of German discounter Lidl and DIA\u2019s third CEO in just over a year, acknowledged the scale of the challenge presented by the turnaround.\n\n\u201cDIA\u2019s new management is fully aware of how demanding the situation is,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cEvery day there will be improvements and changes, which will take some time.\u201d", "description": "Spanish retailer DIA swung to a sharply worse net loss in the first half on falling sales, supply disruptions and one-off costs related to store closures, but said on Monday a key indicator of its performance was starting to recover.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
