In the middle of paying for something online? Ooft. Writing a lengthy email, unsaved, only for it to conk out before you hit send? Yikes. Buffering during an important scene on your favourite series? We feel that.\n\nBut what if there was another way? Mobile broadband is a handy alternative and with plans as cheap and fast as these, it's a pretty legitimate solution.\n\nBut before we take a look at the best plans on offer, let's dive into what mobile broadband is. There are two main types of 'portable' broadband; namely mobile broadband and home wireless.\n\nMobile Broadband Vs Home Wireless: What's The Difference? There are two main NBN alternatives worth considering: mobile broadband and home wireless broadband. Both are powered by 4G mobile networks, but there are major differences between the two.

While this obviously won't suit prolific downloaders and online gamers, it should be more than enough for most of your browsing and streaming needs, including Netflix which requires a broadband connection speed of 0.5 megabits per second.\n\nCheck out the full table below.\n\nWhy NBN's 'Netflix Tax' Could Be The Final Nail In Its Coffin Earlier this month, it was revealed NBN Co had started initial talks with ISPs about how they could chuck an extra fee on video streaming, according to Commsday and iTNews.
