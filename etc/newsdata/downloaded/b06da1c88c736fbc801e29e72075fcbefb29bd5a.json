Wednesday\u2019s decision may require fine-tuning of that list.\n\n___\n\n1:30 p.m.\n\nThe European Union is appealing to U.S. President Donald Trump to avoid any tit-for-tat tariff war as world trade\u2019s governing body prepares to issue a ruling that could allow him to impose billions in duties on EU produce.\n\nThe World Trade Organization ruled in May that Europe illegally subsidized planemaker Airbus, hurting U.S. competitor Boeing. The EU won a similar WTO case accusing the U.S. of illegally subsidizing Boeing, but a ruling allowing possible retaliation is still months off.\n\nEuropean Commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva said Wednesday that \u201cwe should avoid imposing tariffs on one another.\u201d\n\nShe says \u201cwe are still ready and willing to find a fair settlement, but if the U.S. decides to impose authorized countermeasures, the EU will do the same.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Latest on the World Trade Organization\u2019s ruling over EU\u2019s Airbus subsidies (all times local):", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/30/belgium_europe_new_commission_97959_c0-295-6217-3919_s1770x1032.jpg?2cabed4a044b4d9703d75689ed06c0c1b866e63c"}
