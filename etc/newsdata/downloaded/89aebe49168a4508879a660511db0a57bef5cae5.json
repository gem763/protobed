Selling foie gras in New York City will be illegal starting in 2022.\n\nThe ban could mean trouble for two farms outside the city that are premier U.S. producers of foie gras, with New York as their prime market: Hudson Valley Foie Gras and nearby La Belle Farm. Together, they raise about 350,000 birds for foie gras each year. The owners said they may have to close, with hundreds of mostly immigrant workers losing their jobs.\n\nThe measure imposes a fine of up to $2,000 for violating the law. An earlier proposed penalty of up to one year behind bars has been eliminated.", "description": "Selling the duck-liver delicacy in New York City will be illegal starting in 2022", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/30/bef68c20-cbcf-4b2a-bd3f-024fd3d86c34/thumbnail/1200x630/1428198e4959327406a8c960b21ae793/gettyimages-874889794-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
