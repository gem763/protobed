As the paper described in a profile about its then-employee, the Norwegian-born tech expert was hired to \"spearhead\" security improvements, including the implementation of two-factor authentication, which is a growingly common two-step log-in process outside of the typical password. She also developed a confidential page for collecting tips and improved communication methods and the accounts of Times subscribers.\n\nAt the time the profile was written in 2018, her work was \"increasingly crucial.\"\n\nBut, as of Tuesday, her work was no longer needed.\n\nFLASHBACK: TOP DEMS, INCLUDING BIDEN AND NADLER, CALLED CLINTON IMPEACHMENT 'LYNCHING'\n\n\"Today the @nytimes chose to eliminate my role, stating that there is no need for a dedicated focus on newsroom and journalistic security. I strongly believe in what I do (and what we did), and to say I\u2019m disappointed would be an understatement,\" Sandvik wrote on Twitter. \"I'm grateful for the 3.5 years of collaboration and helping support brilliant journalists; it's been amazing and exciting; I remain a fierce advocate for the mission of protecting reporters & sources, and I'm very disappointed to see this chapter brought to a sudden close.\"\n\nThe paper credited Sandvik's work in developing an encrypted system in obtaining tips for its April 2018 report about the FBI raiding the office of former Trump attorney Michael Cohen.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s changed how the newsroom works,\u201d Times deputy investigations editor Gabriel Dance said at the time.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s had to help us think really creatively about how to stay secure while also staying flexible to working in a newsroom. It\u2019s the coaching she gives to investigative reporters on how best to protect themselves and protect their sources.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAccording to the Times, Sandvik regularly sent phishing emails to her colleagues disguised as a Times email account in order to test the judgment of its journalists. And those who compromised their accounts were given further training by her team.\n\nThe Times did not immediately respond to Fox News for comment.", "description": "It appears that The New York Times has let go of its senior director of information security and that staffer is speaking out about the paper's decision.", "authors": ["Joseph Wulfsohn", "Joseph A.
