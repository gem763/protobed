Rob Carr/Getty Images\n\nMajor League Baseball and its fans have raised alarms in recent years over a perceived decline in the popularity of baseball in the United States. Falling attendance, poor World Series ratings and a lack of nationally recognized stars are often cited as evidence of the sport\u2019s impending collapse.\n\nHowever, if viewed through the lens of total tickets sold and local television ratings, a somewhat more optimistic picture emerges: one of strong, local fan bases \u2014 and a national following that could have a lot more room to grow.\n\nAnnual Ticket Sales by League 75 million Major League Baseball 50 Minor League Baseball National Basketball Assn. 25 National Football League 1992 1997 2002 2007 2012 2017 75 million Major League Baseball 50 Minor League Baseball National Basketball Assn. 25 National Football League 1992 1997 2002 2007 2012 2017 75 million Major League Baseball 50 Minor League Baseball National Basketball Assn. 25 National Football League 1992 1997 2002 2007 2012 2017 75 million Major League Baseball 50 Minor League Baseball National Basketball Assn. 25 National Football League 2017 1992 1997 2002 2007 2012 Note: The 1998-99 and 2011-12 N.B.A. seasons were shortened by lockouts, and the 1994 M.L.B. season was shortened by a players\u2019 strike. Sources: ESPN, MiLB.com\n\nIt\u2019s well documented that attendance at Major League Baseball games has been declining since 2012. About 68.5 million fans attended major league games during the 2019 regular season, down from a peak of nearly 80 million in 2007.\n\nBut M.L.B. cashes in on its sheer volume of games, vastly outperforming the N.F.L. and the N.B.A in ticket sales every year. M.L.B. teams play at least 2,430 regular-season games each season, compared with only 256 regular-season games for the N.F.L. and 1,230 for the N.B.A. Even the 160 M.L.B.-affiliated minor league teams sold nearly 50 million tickets in 2017.\n\nA lot of people are going to a lot of baseball games.\n\nTom Brady vs. Mike Trout\n\nA major concern for baseball is the meager national profiles of its stars. By nearly any measure, pro football and pro basketball players outpace baseball players in national popularity.\n\nAccording to YouGov\u2019s ratings of active sports personalities, 91 percent of Americans have heard of LeBron James and 88 percent have heard of Tom Brady, but only 43 percent have heard of Mike Trout of the Los Angeles Angels, baseball\u2019s best player.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to look any further than the national reach of each league\u2019s television broadcasts to see why this may be the case.\n\nAn analysis by The New York Times of television broadcasts by county shows how widespread the broadcasts of the N.F.L. and N.B.A. stars are \u2014 and how minimal they are for baseball\u2019s stars like Trout.\n\nPercentage of games aired by county in the 2018 season 0% 50 100% Tom Brady Mike Trout LeBron James N.F.L. N.B.A. M.L.B. 100% of counties air at least a quarter of Brady\u2019s games. 1% of counties air at least a quarter of Trout\u2019s games. 98% of counties air at least a quarter of James\u2019s games.

Sources: ESPN, DirectTV, 506 Sports\n\nFew of Trout\u2019s games are shown outside Southern California. For example, only six of his 162 games in 2018 were aired in Chicago. By contrast, 42 percent of LeBron James\u2019s 82 games and 56 percent of Tom Brady\u2019s 16 games were aired there.\n\nSince even baseball\u2019s best players rarely get airtime in markets outside their own, baseball struggles to promote its national stars on the same level as other sports do.\n\nOver the past several seasons, baseball has tried to broaden the reach of its stars. But there may be no better solution than to find ways to let fans actually watch them play.\n\nBaseball Is Local\n\nFurther evidence of the local nature of baseball\u2019s fandom can be seen in Google searches. Teams like the Detroit Tigers and Colorado Rockies have very little following outside their areas and a few neighboring states compared with the N.F.L. teams from the same city. The Rockies, for instance, aren\u2019t as popular across the country, but they get more searches in Colorado than the N.F.L.\u2019s Broncos do.\n\nGoogle Search popularity for N.F.L. and M.L.B. teams 0 50 100 New York Giants New York Yankees Denver Broncos Colorado Rockies N.F.L.

Source: Google Trends\n\nThe Pros and Cons of Local Broadcasting\n\nFox, ESPN, CBS and NBC own the national broadcasting rights for N.F.L. games, giving wide exposure to the league\u2019s best teams and stars. Baseball\u2019s broadcasting model is much different. Individual teams sell exclusive rights for nearly all of their games to either regional branches of these national networks or to local stations.\n\nAlthough baseball\u2019s national TV ratings lag far behind those of other top sports, these local broadcasts are very popular.\n\nAccording to Nielsen ratings:\n\nIn 2019, 12 of the 29 United States-based major league teams were the most popular prime-time broadcast in their market. An additional seven teams ranked in the top three in prime time. On cable, 24 major league teams ranked first in their market in prime time. M.L.B. ranked first over all on cable in every major league market in the United States except Miami.\n\nAgain, baseball is relying on its high volume of games (one nearly every day for six months). But the fact remains that people spend many more hours watching their home team than other prime-time shows.\n\nThis works well for the regional networks \u2014 many of which are owned, at least in part, by the teams themselves.\n\nThe local popularity of baseball partially explains the poor World Series ratings in recent years. After following their home team for 162 games, fans may be unlikely to sit through a series between two teams they have rarely seen play and with 50 players whose names they may barely recognize. Instead, they\u2019ll wait until next season, and tune back in to their local station.", "description": "Despite a perceived decline, Major League Baseball, when viewed through the lens of ticket sales and television ratings, is not only popular, but primed for growth.", "authors": ["Juliette Love"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/18/us/baseball-popularity-world-series-promo-1571419113927-copy/baseball-popularity-world-series-promo-1571419113927-copy-facebookJumbo-v4.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
