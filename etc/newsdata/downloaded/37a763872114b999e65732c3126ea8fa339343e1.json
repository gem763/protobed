And that was in 2015, when Donald Trump was still being mocked for thinking he could win the U.S. presidential election. After Trump was elected, he became an unfortunate, inescapable fixture in late night.\n\nO\u2019Brien, like his peers, still makes nightly jokes about the president. But O\u2019Brien, now the elder statesman of late night, has also responded to matters at home by increasing his international travels \u2014 not just as a reaction to Trump, but as a way to connect audiences to parts of the world they may have otherwise never seen.\n\nAnd as fans of O\u2019Brien know, he absolutely shines in his remote segments. From playing old-timey baseball to forming a hip new boy band to traveling to countries like Finland and Ireland in his NBC days, O\u2019Brien\u2019s on-location pieces are consistently hilarious. And in Conan Without Borders, he adds an educational component, giving glimpses into other cultures, while providing abbreviated history lessons for context.\n\nWhat makes Conan Without Borders work so well is O\u2019Brien\u2019s innate ability to improvise, his willingness to make a fool of himself, and the show\u2019s effort to tackle uncomfortable topics. Whether he\u2019s speaking with refugees, covering the turmoil at the West Bank, or hearing about the permanent effects of a genocide on a country\u2019s people, O\u2019Brien sympathetically and sensitively discusses the topics rather than mocking or avoiding them.\n\nThe cast of characters who join O\u2019Brien have also become perfect comedic partners for the traveling host. Fan favorites like Sona Movsesian, Flula Borg, Jordan Schlansky, and Steven Yeun all perfectly complement O\u2019Brien in their respective episodes.\n\nBy the end of 2015, O\u2019Brien visited two countries for the show, Cuba and Armenia. Since then he\u2019s filmed in 11 additional countries, one of which (Greenland) premiered this month, while another (Ghana) premieres in November. Though they are all worth watching, here is the official ranking of each special:\n\n12. Qatar (2016)\n\nWhen Michelle Obama asked O\u2019Brien if he\u2019d put on a show for the troops, the host immediately agreed and traveled overseas to spend a week at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, the headquarters for the U.S central command who run and coordinate air and ground campaigns in Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan. The episode begins with an insane 3-D reenactment of O\u2019Brien\u2019s flight with Obama. Since they couldn\u2019t bring a camera on the plane, the animation shows the host spilling his vodka causing the plane to malfunction, Obama landing the plane herself, O\u2019Brien ejecting his seat, landing on a boat, working on the boat, only to be kidnapped by bandits and rescued by Obama.\n\nWhile it\u2019s fun watching O\u2019Brien train with a K9 unit, asking if military dogs would attack him if he were holding Cialis and antidepressants, and seeing Obama demand the host give her 50 push-ups, the episode doesn\u2019t hit the same stride as so many of the others do.\n\n11. Australia (2019)\n\nA prison-hat-wearing Hugh Jackman tells O\u2019Brien via video message that he\u2019s seen the host go everywhere except Australia. \u201cThere\u2019s an old rule in show business,\u201d O\u2019Brien says in response. \u201cWhen Hugh Jackman tells you to do something, you do it.\u201d\n\nWhen traveling to a new country, O\u2019Brien usually learns some of the language, but Australia is full of English speakers, so he studies the Australian dialect instead. His coach teaches him that shrimps are called prawns, nobody drinks Fosters, and when you\u2019re surprised you say \u201cfuck me dead.\u201d She also encourages more subtlety with his accent, which sounds more like someone whose mouth has just been numbed more than an Australian person.\n\nO\u2019Brien plays footie, asks a koala bear to eat some pizza for energy, and performs stand-up in Sydney. One of the best moments is when he learns how to survive in the Australian bush with a guide who warns of spiders under rocks and dangerous stinging ants that once caused his wife to turn white and crap her pants. \u201cDoes your wife mind that you put in the part where she craps her pants?\u201d O\u2019Brien asks. \u201cJust leave that part out.\u201d\n\n10. Mexico (2017)\n\nAfter Trump insisted that there would be a wall built across the southern border and that Mexico would pay for it, O\u2019Brien responded by shooting an episode in Mexico City. The host\u2019s mission was to provide positivity and optimism in an effort to combat the efforts of division. This is the only remote in which O\u2019Brien still hosts the show from a studio, but this time with an all-Mexican staff, crew, band, and roster of guests.\n\nHighlights of the episode are mostly outside of the studio, though, as O\u2019Brien appears in a telenovela called Mi Adorable Maldici\u00f3n playing a forgetful, bolo-tie-wearing cheese merchant. He trains to become a luchador and transforms into El Gallo Loco (the crazy rooster), whose power is pecking and crowing.\n\nOf course, O\u2019Brien is at his best when roaming the streets, speaking with pedestrians. Since he\u2019s delivering his monologue in Spanish, he tests out jokes on the locals and asks them if they can pay for the wall by putting money in a wall-shaped box. One man tries sticking his middle finger in the box instead. Though the episode is admirable for its mission and for hiring an all-Mexican crew, the in-studio pieces couldn\u2019t muster the same momentum brought from the man-on-the-street segments. O\u2019Brien clearly has more fun when he\u2019s not confined to the studio setting.\n\n9. Greenland (2019)\n\nWhen Trump expressed interest in the U.S. buying Greenland, he was met with a swift rejection and the Danish prime minister called the idea \u201cabsurd.\u201d O\u2019Brien saw the absurdity and booked a flight.\n\nThe host promised to use his late-night clout to properly negotiate the deal for Trump. Venturing from the country\u2019s capital and largest city, Nuuk, to the town of Ilulissat, O\u2019Brien negotiates a deal with Greenland\u2019s Parliament, offering them a Starbucks gift card and a suitcase full of $120,000 borrowed from some \u201cvery bad people.\u201d They reject the offer and O\u2019Brien settles for a sheet of ice.\n\nThe beauty of this episode is that it exposes us to a rarely discussed country and their culture. Greenland is so seldom in the news that when O\u2019Brien encounters a Greenlander wearing a Make America Great Again hat, he learns that the man only likes Trump for all the publicity he\u2019s given his country, not because he\u2019s a supporter. A tourist site for Greenland even praised the show, tracking O\u2019Brien\u2019s journey, and calling the episode a \u201cfunny and positive insight into our people and their hospitality, and what makes Greenland unique.\u201d It\u2019s an insightful and funny episode worth watching, if not for just seeing O\u2019Brien attempt to deliver a weather report in Greenlandic. (It doesn\u2019t go well.)\n\n8. Japan (2018)\n\nThere can only be one Conan. When Conan in the U.S. learned there was a more famous Conan in Japan, an anime and manga character named Detective Conan \u2014 who also happened to have a town named after him, ConanTown \u2014 the Japan episode was born. \u201cClearly someone\u2019s been making a ton of money off the Asian version of me for 20 years.\u201d Arriving to Japan with a demand of 3 trillion yen and a pack of fans waiting for him at the airport, O\u2019Brien greets the mayor of Conan Town, who appoints the host mayor for the day and gives him a fake check.\n\nThis episode offers a variety of great skits, including O\u2019Brien dressing in kawaii style (cute style): a blue wig, a purple necklace, and a shirt with a dog on it, which makes him feel like he \u201cjust ate six pounds of Skittles and then took acid.\u201d O\u2019Brien also takes an etiquette lesson and tells his teacher he\u2019s a hugger, only to be told he\u2019s not her type because of his \u201cface.\u201d\n\nOne of the more intriguing (and slightly depressing) pieces of information was learning that if you live in Japan and you\u2019re lonely, you can rent a family for up to three years. So O\u2019Brien rents a family with hopes of getting a wife who understands his jokes and a father who will apologize for not letting him watch The Love Boat after he spilled a bowl of creamed corn in the \u201970s. When he meets his new family he asks them to laugh at his jokes. His new child asks his new wife, \u201cWhat if I don\u2019t understand his jokes?\u201d The new wife tells her, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to.\u201d He also gets his new dad to say \u201cI was wrong in the \u201970s\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m sorry about the creamed corn.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss this episode, especially if you want to see Jordan Schlansky give his opinion on Japanese toilets and get his dreams crushed by Ralph Macchio, who shocks Schlansky by telling him Karate Kid II was not filmed in Japan.\n\n7. Berlin (2016)\n\nWhen Flula Borg invites you to Berlin with an esoteric promise of being the Tenzing Norgay to your Edmund Hillary as the two of you walk around eating raisins and peanuts, you take the invitation.\n\nWith Borg as his guide, O\u2019Brien eats a slaughter plate at a beer hall, sings German drinking songs, and goes to a nude beach \u2014 Borg wears only his sneakers and a fanny pack. Conan then ventures solo around Berlin, learning authentic traditional Bavarian folk dancing with two lederhosen-clad brothers and their strict handlebar-mustachioed father, whom O\u2019Brien calls a monster and says was \u201cclearly carved out of a sausage.\u201d\n\nThe episode does a good job mixing up activities for O\u2019Brien, having him learn to make sausage with a kindly but occasionally creepy sausage-maker, meet an intense fan who traveled hours to bring pages of Fan Corrections, and experience some nipple play with a dominatrix named Lady Velvet Steel. She blindfolds him and puts a censored piece in his mouth. \u201cI\u2019m hoping this is not what I think it is. Maybe a chess piece?\u201d O\u2019Brien says. \u201cA rook? No, that\u2019s a bishop\u2019s hat.\u201d\n\nThis episode\u2019s more sentimental moment occurs when he speaks with Palestinian, Syrian, and Afghani refugees at Berlin Tempelhof Airport, a reminder that this whole exercise is to, indeed, broaden viewers\u2019 horizons.\n\n6. Cuba (2015)\n\nThis is the very first Conan Without Borders episode, one prompted by the warming relations between the U.S. and Cuba. O\u2019Brien was the first late-night host to visit the country since former Tonight Show host Jack Paar interviewed Fidel Castro in 1959. And it\u2019s a fun episode all the way through, with O\u2019Brien introducing the show in a glitzy white suit, white hat, and green tie before jamming with a Cuban band in an attempt to find his clave (rhythm) and learning to dance the rumba.\n\nOne of the best bits is when O\u2019Brien visits the Havana Club Rum Museum. He tours the museum with his guide, Gretel, who plays off his antics perfectly, like a frustrated parent to an antsy child. The segment ends with O\u2019Brien lying on the bar counter, drunk, asking for a place to stay and requesting Gretel sing him a song. She sings and he interrupts with his own lyrics: \u201cI\u2019m going to live with Gretel. I\u2019m going to move in with Gretel. I\u2019ll do the laundry. She will let me have free rum. I\u2019ll change my name to Hansel. So we\u2019ll be Hansel and Gretel. Then we will drink rum. I\u2019ll become an alcoholic.\u201d\n\nThis is a great episode to learn more about Cuba, their citizens, and to see O\u2019Brien get very drunk and find his clave.\n\n5. Haiti (2018)\n\nThe Conan crew made this happen almost immediately after Trump described Haiti as one of those \u201cshithole countries.\u201d \u201cNow I have no idea what the president has against the people of Haiti,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cBut if the president doesn\u2019t like them, they must be lovely people.\u201d\n\nWhile some countries welcome O\u2019Brien with fanfare, Conan in Haiti shows us that some are understandably wary of an American arriving with a camera crew. He encounters Haitians who want to know who he is and why he is there. In his best Creole, O\u2019Brien explains that he and his crew were angry about what Trump said. He tells one woman in particular \u2014 who clearly has her doubts about him \u2014 that Haiti is a beautiful country and if the U.S. doesn\u2019t get a new president soon, he may \u201cwant to stay forever.\u201d She then laughs and hugs the host.\n\nFrom riding in a tap-tap (beautifully painted buses in Haiti) to speaking with expat women who returned to run their own businesses, the special is easily one of the funniest and most insightful episodes from Conan Without Borders. It emphasizes that there are many misconceptions about Haiti and its people, highlighting the perseverance and beauty of the Haitian people and their country.\n\nOne of the best exchanges is when a student of the school O\u2019Brien visits says Americans had taken their land. O\u2019Brien suggests, \u201cMaybe Americans need to help Haiti put things back.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t need the help of the U.S.,\u201d she tells him. \u201cThey\u2019re going to come here and take our stuff.\u201d O\u2019Brien says he wouldn\u2019t take her stuff, but she replies, \u201cHe\u2019s not going to take our stuff anymore, but he still owes us our land back.\u201d O\u2019Brien says the girl should be the next president of Haiti. She says she wants to be president of the United States.\n\n4. Korea (2016)\n\nIf you want to see O\u2019Brien insult gamers at a PC bang (\u201cYour mother does not prepare squid properly\u201d), help a Buddhist monk shovel snow, and star in a psychedelic K-Pop music video with Steven Yeun, then this is the perfect episode for you. It was planned after Conan superfan Sunny Lee sent the host a detailed letter written on her SAT prep form inviting him to visit her country. We see O\u2019Brien get the full Beatlemania treatment, arriving in Korea to an airport full of flashing cameras and cheering fans.\n\nOne of the best parts of the episode is O\u2019Brien\u2019s attempt to learn Korean with his teacher Jin Shil. She tells him that his eye contact is scary, his smile is weird, and his thinking is dirty. When Jin Shil reveals that she uses a \u201clove stick\u201d to lightly hit her students, O\u2019Brien tells her to punish him with the stick. \u201cI don\u2019t like you,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is the greatest thing to ever happen to me,\u201d he tells her. \u201cOh my gosh, you\u2019re weird,\u201d she says. She then calls him \u201ctwisted.\u201d\n\nThe episode also covers the tensions between North Korea and South Korea. Steven Yeun and O\u2019Brien visit the JSA (Joint Security Area) in the Demilitarized Zone that separates both countries. They put on a faux episode of Conan right on the border using a steadfast, nonresponsive guard as their audience. And of course, no trip is complete without O\u2019Brien making an appearance on a soap opera. The one he appears on is called \u201cOne More Happy Ending.\u201d\n\n3. Italy (2018)\n\nJordan Schlansky fans rejoice: This one is made for you. It\u2019s almost a full hour of O\u2019Brien and his best foe touring Italy.\n\nThe duo has gained quite the following over the last few years because of their chemistry and natural comedic contemptuousness for one another. The trip is a chance for O\u2019Brien to finally spend time with his producer who claims to perform \u201cvarious duties\u201d for the show and is a self-proclaimed expert on Italy. O\u2019Brien gives viewers a chance to see Italy through Schlansky\u2019s \u201ccold, dead eyes.\u201d\n\nOne of the ongoing highlights of the trip is O\u2019Brien\u2019s nonsense Italian greetings directed at the locals. Schlansky confronts O\u2019Brien in this exchange:\n\nO\u2019Brien: Agnolotti! It just makes it look like I\u2019m a popular guy.\n\nSchlansky: I think that it\u2019s sometimes considered to be insulting when you yell out a fake Italian word clearly as an American.\n\nConan: Not at all. Tortelloni!\n\nIn addition to seeing the pair hunt with dogs for (likely pre-planted) truffles and try various Italian wines, we get to see Schlansky break. While driving across the Italian countryside in Schlansky\u2019s red Fiat, O\u2019Brien disturbs the silence using sound effects of a baby crying, causing the seemingly robotic Schlansky to crack a smile. Then O\u2019Brien brings out the fart noises, and Schlansky starts laughing and calls O\u2019Brien a toddler.\n\nThis is easily a top Conan Without Borders episode. It moves seamlessly, and if you\u2019re already a fan of the O\u2019Brien/Schlansky dynamic, there\u2019s no doubt you\u2019ll love this one.\n\n2. Israel (2017)\n\nThis is probably the most controversial episode of Conan Without Borders, but it\u2019s also one of the best. The trip was a response to Jared Kushner\u2019s attempt at the time to make an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan. O\u2019Brien\u2019s mission? \u201cTo try and make some people laugh and in the process alienate everyone.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Brien encounters an eclectic mix of characters, like David, an older man who invites him to his apartment for coffee, only to sit in silence with him and calls the host \u201cbeautiful.\u201d There\u2019s a hairy man on a Tel Aviv beach whose chest hair is used for O\u2019Brien to hang his sunglasses, and a rabbi who tells the Irish Catholic host that he is \u201cpure\u201d \u2014 which prompts O\u2019Brien to ask if he needs to be a virgin to convert to Judaism, \u201cbecause up until five years ago I\u2019d have been fine.\u201d After O\u2019Brien decides not to convert and settles instead to have a bar mitzvah, he uses his newly cemented status as a man to visit Gal Gadot, who swiftly rejects O\u2019Brien\u2019s advances to have a drink or go ballooning.\n\nO\u2019Brien speaks with Palestinian refugees and visits patients at an Israeli hospital on the Syrian border. He tells one of the surgeons: \u201cI honestly, sincerely think you\u2019re doing beautiful work here. The only thing I question about you are these medical Crocs. That, I think, is the only thing that separates you from a godlike status.\u201d The surgeon says, \u201cWe are only human; we all make mistakes.\u201d\n\nHe also speaks with pro-Palestinian activists at the wall. They ask him if he thinks the wall is normal and he tells them, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think any wall like this is normal.\u201d He continues: \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know what the answer is. There\u2019s no way my 40-minute program is going to satisfy what it is you want me to do \u2026 what I do promise to do is make sure that people who watch this program will have an idea that this other reality exists.\u201d\n\nThe special provides a glimpse into life in Israel, both the comedic and non-comedic sides, while acknowledging there\u2019s too much to be able to successfully cover all of it in under an hour. It ends with O\u2019Brien at the Dead Sea, being told by a beachgoer that he is more attractive covered in mud.\n\n1. Armenia (2015)\n\nIt makes sense that after becoming the first late-night host in decades to visit Cuba, O\u2019Brien and his assistant Sona Movsesian traveled to Armenia, another rarely visited destination on television. \u201cThat Conan O\u2019Brien chose to take Sona to Armenia is a big deal for those of us who are Armenian,\u201d Paste writer Liz Ohanesian wrote in 2015.\n\nThe episode centers around O\u2019Brien helping Movsesian connect with her heritage. The duo already had a well-established comedic rapport, shown in segments like when he tracked down her stolen \u201cGigolos\u201d mug and when he crashed her viewing party for Magic Mike XXL. So, naturally, having the two of them travel together in Armenia made for the show\u2019s best foreign remote. Highlights include O\u2019Brien playing a pale gangster with starkly contrasting dark facial hair in a soap opera, learning a traditional folk dance, using Armenian phrases like \u201cI want to eat your liver\u201d or \u201cI die on your body\u201d on the locals, and visiting a matchmaker to fulfill his promise to Movsesian\u2019s grandmother that he would find her an Armenian groom. \u201cThis trip is not all about what you want,\u201d O\u2019Brien tells his reluctant assistant.\n\nThis is the first episode to grapple with more serious subjects as O\u2019Brien speaks with Syrian refugees who fled to Armenia and listens to Movsesian\u2019s personal experience with the effects of the Armenian genocide. \u201cAny visit to Armenia must include an acknowledgment of the country\u2019s tragic history,\u201d O\u2019Brien says, referring to the genocide that took place over 100 years ago when the Ottoman Empire killed or displaced over 1 million Armenians.\n\nThe show doesn\u2019t aim to make light of the situation or rush through it, instead we see Movsesian visit the Armenian Genocide Memorial Complex and talk to O\u2019Brien about what she feels while there. She tears up when mentioning her grandparents losing everyone they knew and loved as children. She says it\u2019s ingrained in Armenian culture to take as much as you can out of life. She then tells O\u2019Brien she\u2019d like to come back with friends and family. \u201cYou can come, too,\u201d she tells him. \u201cReally?\u201d He asks. \u201cYeah, I guess.\u201d", "description": "What makes \u201cConan Without Borders\u201d work so well is O\u2019Brien\u2019s innate ability to improvise, his willingness to make a fool of himself, and the show\u2019s effort to tackle uncomfortable topics.", "authors": ["Ian Goldstein"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/16/16-conan-without-borders-new.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
