But the simple act of eating fast-food has become a battleground for some LGBT+ campaigners.\n\nThe third largest food outlet in the USA, Chick-fil-A, turned over $10.5bn in 2018. The company has made no secret of its Christian values; even in 2019, its stores close on Sundays for religious reasons.\n\nWhen Chick-fil-A opened its first outlet in the UK, in Reading, it was targeted by gay rights campaigners who accused the company of homophobia. Reading Pride claimed the chain\u2019s \u201cethical and moral stance goes completely against our values and that of the UK, as we are a progressive country that has legalised same-sex marriage\u201d. A mere eight days later, Reading\u2019s Oracle shopping centre announced it would not be renewing the shop\u2019s six-month lease.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

In Texas, a law was passed earlier this year banning retaliation against any business based on religious beliefs.\n\nPersonally I don\u2019t agree with Chick-fil-A\u2019s beliefs, but should they have been forced out of business? They still fund groups that support conversion therapy but they have not denied services to any individual on the grounds of sexuality, as the law rightly requires.\n\nSurely, people are grown up enough to choose for themselves where to eat a chicken sandwich. Whatever happened to the notion of live and let live?", "description": "When I buy a kebab, I don\u2019t ask whether the owner of the shop believes in gay marriage.
