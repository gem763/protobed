At the same time, voters are losing perspective on just how weird it is that a country like Australia can be in such an energy muddle.\n\nPoliticians further complicate matters by spouting a complex array of statistics often designed to confuse more than enlighten. The bottom line is that a country blessed with inexhaustible sources of raw energy is suffering from high energy prices and unreliable power.\n\nConsumers are victims of short-term policies undermining long-term solutions, and the culture wars complicate the issue.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very messy situation,\u201d says Ralph Evans, a former boss of Austrade and the Australian Institute of Company Directors, who is writing a book on climate change and energy policy. \u201cThe fact that there are different bodies not in concert on this is a real problem for Australia.\u201d\n\nThis \u201creal problem\u201d has dogged Australian politics for 13 years, dating back to when Kevin Rudd took over the leadership of the ALP. The following year, Rudd told a national energy summit in Parliament House, Canberra, that climate change was \u201cthe great moral challenge of our generation\u201d.\n\nAmid high fanfare, he commissioned a report on climate change from Ross Garnaut, a former adviser to Labor prime minister Bob Hawke and a one-time Australian ambassador to China. The first of what turned out to be three Garnaut reports said Australia had \u201cexceptional sensitivity\u201d to climate change but also an \u201cexceptional opportunity\u201d to use \u201ceffective policies\u201d such as an emissions trading scheme to help a global effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nFederal Energy Minister Angus Taylor has strong connections to the Snowy Mountains Scheme. AAP\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Rudd's government failed to meet that challenge. Garnaut had already presciently warned that \"climate change is harder than any other issue\u201d to deal with and \u201cmore important\u201d than any matter \u201cconfronting Australian politicians in living memory\u201d. It presented \u201ca new type of challenge\u201d because its true nature was \u201cuncertain\u201d in form and extent, \u201crather than drawn in clear lines\u201d.\n\nThe Rudd government announced plans to establish an emissions trading scheme but met a perfect storm of opposition. There was bad luck and bad timing, and the situation was not helped by Rudd\u2019s erratic leadership style.\n\nIn a series of hammer blows, the Greens decided to oppose the Rudd government\u2019s ETS because it was not \u2013 according to the Greens, that is \u2013 ambitious enough; Malcolm Turnbull lost his leadership of the Liberal Party to Tony Abbott, largely because of his support for the government\u2019s ETS; and a climate change conference in Copenhagen collapsed in ignominy shortly afterwards.\n\nPolitically, Rudd became, well, rudderless. Within six months he was toppled as ALP leader and replaced by his deputy, Julia Gillard. A few months later, Gillard led the ALP into a near-death experience in the 2010 election, barely holding onto office as leader of a minority government with the support of two key independents and an alliance with the Greens.\n\nThe election result and the enhanced Greens influence led to Gillard putting a price on carbon, a move denounced by Abbott as \u201ca great big new tax\u201d. From then on, Gillard was dogged by claims of lying \u2013 remember \u201cJuliar\u201d? Abbott proverbially planted his foot firmly on Gillard\u2019s throat, and she, too, lost the party leadership three months before the September 2013 election.\n\nAfter Abbott thrashed the second Rudd-led Labor government at the polls, the new Coalition prime minister promptly abolished the carbon tax. But after two years Abbott was also gone, felled by his political nemesis, Turnbull.\n\nSimilar to Gillard six years before, Turnbull barely scraped through in the July 2016 election, although he did have a one-seat majority. Two years later, it was Turnbull\u2019s turn to be felled in a party-room putsch effectively led by Abbott, although Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton was the nominated leadership rival and the ultimate winner was Scott Morrison.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnce again, the key issues were climate change and energy policy. Abbott led a revolt against Turnbull\u2019s National Energy Guarantee, which was designed to deal with higher energy prices and rectify a chronic lack of a clear future direction for energy companies to make long-term investment decisions.\n\nThe NEG was agnostic on the precise energy mix. Instead, it obliged companies operating in the energy market and large energy users to become reliable players and sign on to emissions reduction obligations, using whatever combination of renewables and dispatchable power that met those targets.\n\nHowever, the NEG was continually attacked by Abbott and his conservative supporters in the Coalition. After the NEG was passed at a party-room meeting, Abbott said in a written statement that \u201cunfortunately most explanations of how the NEG (as its stands without price targets) might theoretically get prices down sound like merchant bankers\u2019 gobbledygook\u201d.\n\nTurnbull is a former merchant banker.\n\nFor some, the issue was framed as one of conservatives like Abbott opposing the NEG because they were against intervening in the market. However, this view rests uneasily beside the Coalition's later support for proposed new laws that threatened to use state power to bust up power companies if they do not put downward pressure on prices. Enabling legislation for these \"big stick\" measures is currently before Parliament.\n\nTurnbull\u2019s putative NEG mix also included an expanded Snowy Mountains Scheme. Energy Minister Angus Taylor will be a prominent figure at the 70th-anniversary celebrations and may ponder on lessons learnt from a long-term energy project like the Snowy.", "description": "Voters are losing perspective on just how weird it is that a country like Australia can be in such an energy muddle.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2043%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_39/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/fa38f57b8d7f4d5b961ce0ec9b345e7d4cce4b07", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
