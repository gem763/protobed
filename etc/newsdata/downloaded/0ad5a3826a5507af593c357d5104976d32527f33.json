Ralph Abraham (R), released a new campaign ad in which he said there are only two genders.\n\nAbraham tells supporters, \u201cHere\u2019s the truth. Life begins at conception. Government is too big. Our taxes are too high. And our car insurance is too expensive. President Trump is doing a great job. Facts matter more than feelings. The Second Amendment is self-explanatory. And as a doctor, I can assure you there are only two genders.\u201d\n\nOur new #lagov TV ad starts today. As your next governor, I will always tell you the truth.#Doc4Gov pic.twitter.com/jZOFVxpMJB \u2014 Dr. Ralph Abraham (@DocAbraham) August 22, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise his assertion that there are only two genders did not go over well with our friends on the left. MSNBC anchor Chris Jansing addressed this topic during a panel discussion about the GOP\u2019s relationship with women and the LGBT community. (Specifically, a national LGBT group, the Log Cabin Republicans, had just endorsed Trump for a second term.)\n\nAn indignant Jansing told viewers she found Abraham\u2019s remarks to be \u201cincendiary.\u201d Here\u2019s what she had to say. (video below)\n\nWe\u2019ve got an important question now. What does it mean to be a mainstream Republican? It is the question that some Republicans have been asking in the age of Donald Trump, and increasingly, it seems the answer might be to make incendiary comments about women and members of the LGBT community. In Louisiana, the Republican candidate for governor, Ralph Abraham, is out with a new TV ad this week making incendiary comments about gender.\n\nYes, it\u2019s now become \u201cincendiary\u201d to say there are only two genders. For eons, there were two genders. Now that some far left activist conceived of the notion that there exists not two, but many genders, the world is expected to comply.\n\nI searched the internet to find out just how many genders there are and was surprised to discover that the answers varied greatly. At the end of 2017, for example, I found estimates ranging from 63 to 81. One 2018 article tagged the number at 123. In 2019, however, those in the know, have simplified things for us, and explain that there exists a \u201cspectrum\u201d of genders.\n\nThere\u2019s only one good answer to the question of how many genders there are: Gender is a spectrum, and there are as many gender definitions as there needs to for every person to have a label that feels true to themselves.\n\nCan you imagine anything worse than being \u201cmisgendered\u201d?\n\nWatch the video.", "description": "LA Gubernatorial Candidate Tells Supporters There Are Only Two Genders; Here\u2019s What MSNBC Anchor Told Viewers", "authors": ["Elizabeth Vaughn", "Sarah Lee", "Alex Parker", "Brad Slager", "Sister Toldjah", "Posted At Am On September"], "top_image": "https://www.redstate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/LGBT-Transgender-pronouns.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
