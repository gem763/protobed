Reminder: There are 137 days until the Iowa caucuses and 411 days until the 2020 election.\n\nIs Kamala Harris\u2019s \u201csummer slump\u201d giving way to an autumn freefall?\n\nPundits have been speculating about the state of the California senator\u2019s campaign ever since one of her staffers accidentally left an internal briefing memo that included the phrase \u201csummer slump\u201d at a Manchester, N.H., restaurant earlier this month.\n\nThey have pointed out that after starting strong in January (with a crowd of 20,000 at her announcement rally) and getting stronger in June (with a debate-stage evisceration of Joe Biden that briefly propelled her into second place in polls), Harris has struggled to maintain altitude, descending from an average of 15.2 percent nationally to less than half that number today.\n\nNone of which is all that unusual in a presidential primary \u2014 the polling fluctuations, the breathless commentary, the premature obituaries. After all, unlike general election opponents, those in a primary mostly back the same policies, and it\u2019s easy for voters to repeatedly change their mind based on the weekly news cycle.\n\nSen.

The first, by NBC and the Wall Street Journal, was national; it showed Harris plummeting from 13 percent in July to 5 percent in September, putting her in fifth place, behind Pete Buttigieg, and only a single percentage point ahead of Andrew Yang. No other major candidate lost significant ground in the NBC/WSJ poll; in fact, Biden gained 5 points and Elizabeth Warren gained 6.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Sen.

It showed an even bigger decline for Harris than the new national poll: a loss of 13 percentage points between July and September. In that poll Harris now ranks sixth, behind Amy Klobuchar.\n\nThe third and final poll, meanwhile, came out of California \u00ad\u2014 Harris\u2019s home state. Conducted by Emerson, it showed Biden and Bernie Sanders tied at 26 percent, with Warren trailing at 20. Next in line was Yang with 7. Harris was in fifth with 6.\n\nTogether, Harris\u2019s new numbers suggest a grim new narrative.\n\nBefore, it seemed like the California senator was a formerly first-tier candidate who had slipped into the second tier but who was nonetheless poised to \u201cmake a comeback,\u201d as David Leonhardt of the New York Times recently wrote.\n\nNow it seems like Harris has fallen further \u2014 not just nationally but in both the country\u2019s first caucus state, where highly informed voters are following every twist and turn of the campaign, and in her home state, which votes on Super Tuesday.\n\nIf Harris\u2019s loss of altitude is really accelerating \u2014 and only additional polling can say for sure \u2014 the $64,000 question is why. The pundits\u2019 advice, as summarized by Leonhardt, is to come up with a better message, to \u201cdevelop a clearer theory of her campaign\u2019s case.\u201d", "description": "Pundits have been speculating about the state of Sen.
