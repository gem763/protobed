He pleaded guilty to one count of unlawful possession of a firearm in a public building and one count of unlawful possession of a loaded firearm in public and was sentenced to three years of probation, KATU reported.\n\nLowe, a former Oregon Ducks football player, told the station that when the student entered the classroom with the weapon, he was close enough that he lunged for the gun and grabbed it with both hands.\n\n\"Then it was just me and that student. It was a real emotional time. It was emotional for him, it was emotional for me,\" he said back in May, according to KATU. \"In that time, I felt compassion for him. A lot of times, especially when you\u2019re young, you don\u2019t realize what you\u2019re doing until it\u2019s over.\"", "description": "Video showed the moment Oregon coach Keanon Lowe disarmed and embraced a student who entered the school with a shotgun.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/school-01-as-ht-191019_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
