Or wool it last a little longer?", "language": "en", "text": "Seasonal one-upmanship has been around longer than urban downmanship. \u2018My winter is better than yours\u2019 was a boast heard decades before \u2018My pollution/ potholes/ public transport is worse than yours.\u2019 Every season has its attractions, but i\u2019m happiest when \u2018the summer of my discontent turns to glorious winter\u2019. Now that it\u2019s on its way out everywhere, it\u2019s a good time to remember its good times.\n\nAll i know of Chennai winter is the joke about it having two seasons: hot and hotter. But any city that flaunts those heavy Conjeevarams must either enjoy some cool weather or suffer from terminal masochismam, illaiya?\n\nDelhi\u2019s cultural czarinas bask on the IIC lawn in rustling tussars and exactly matching shawls; uncle-jis and gajar-gobi achars do likewise on winter-mulled terraces. This year\u2019s political trendie was Rahul; the netarati jumped into his sleeveless windcheater. Wish they\u2019d zip up, generally speaking too.\n\nMumbai\u2019s Parsis supposedly took out their furs as soon as the temperature dropped to 28 degrees, but that joke and its contents are now moth eaten. Waittaminute. This year, Mumbai got colder than Kolkata \u2013 perversely just when i left the former and came to the latter with my suitcase packed with hopes of finally cashing in my cashmeres.\n\nThe prematurely retreating winter has played havoc with The Season, once belle of the Raj ball. Only the congenitally conventional still appear in their jaamevars and three-piece suits, traditionally donned on November 15 and doffed the following March ditto. But all is not lost.\n\nThe Queen\u2019s Cup still drew the punters, and the Members enclosure of the still-loyally-named Royal Calcutta Turf Club brimmed with hats competing for attention and the luxe prizes for the boldest and the best. Undue heat has wilted the dish-sized dahlias of the fabled Horticultural Gardens Flower Show-off, but bungalow mems can still hold brunches to \u2018view my gorgeous petunias\u2019. Home-diva Usha still sang her throat and heart out at the Kolkata Festival, tribute to the city\u2019s two deathless industries, \u2018kaalchaar\u2019 and nostalgia.\n\nAmericanised Bongs and bazaar bags both return home, ecstatically stuffed with plump \u2018koi machh\u2019 and slender \u2018pyaj koli\u2019. Mishtir dokans still flow with milk and nolen gur, and fry up the other seasonal orgasm, phool-kopir shinghara. Kolkata is in its bheentar heaben. All\u2019s well with the world.\n\n* * *\n\nAlec Smart said: \u201cLet\u2019s take \u2018riot\u2019 out of \u2018patriotism\u2019.\u201d", "description": "Seasonal one-upmanship has been around longer than urban downmanship. \u2018My winter is better than yours\u2019 was a boast heard decades before \u2018My pollution/ potholes/ public transport is worse than yours.\u2019 Every season has its attractions,...", "authors": ["Bachi Karkaria"], "top_image": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Bachi-Karkaria-new.jpg", "published_at": "2019-02-21"}
