Fr. Nicholas Jonas told the Chicago Tribune he was in his office at Chicago\u2019s Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church early Sunday morning when a caretaker told him about the painting.\n\nJonas said he investigated and placed cotton balls at the bottom of the painting to absorb an oil-like substance pouring from the eyes of the Virgin Mary. He posted a picture of the painting Sunday night that shows streaks of liquid residue coming from the Blessed Mother\u2019s eyes, which give the appearance that she\u2019s crying.\n\nHOW A NEARLY BRAIN DEAD 'MIRACLE MAN' SURVIVED AFTER BEING TAKEN OFF LIFE SUPPORT\n\n\"I can't explain why she is tearing, but I do know as human beings we are usually crying for two reasons: either joy or sorrow,\" Jonas told Chicago\u2019s WLS.\n\nThe church is scheduled for a bankruptcy hearing Tuesday. Following Jonas\u2019 social media post, many people visited the church to see the painting. More than a hundred candles were lit, according to the Tribune. Some worshippers viewed the phenomena as a sign of a coming miracle indicating the church would be saved from foreclosure.\n\n\n\n\u201cMary weeping is a sign, and the miracle is actually in our hearts,\u201d Laura Tovar, whose sister was married at the church, told the Tribune.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nJonas, however, said he\u2019s not sure the tears are a sign the church would be saved and he \u201cwould just rather say that the Virgin Mary is talking to us. I would just let her finish her conversation. And, let\u2019s see what happens.\u201d", "description": "Chicago worshippers on Monday flocked to a century-old Greek Orthodox church that is facing foreclosure to see what some say is a sign from God after a caretaker witnessed what appeared to be tears streaming from the eyes of a painting of the Virgin Mary over the weekend.", "authors": ["Danielle Wallace"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/02/ContentBroker_contentid-8cf284ad39aa4536b2e88c6e2c2eb764.png", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
