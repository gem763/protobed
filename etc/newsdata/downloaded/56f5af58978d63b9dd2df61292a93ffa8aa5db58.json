He was not detained by police.\n\nThe new arrest warrant \u2014 for sedition and misuse of public funds \u2014 was expected to trigger fresh judicial proceedings in the Belgian courts, assuming Puigdemont remains in the country.\n\nAn earlier European arrest warrant against Puigdemont was withdrawn last December after a German court decided to extradite him to Spain on the charge of misuse of public funds but not for the more serious charge of rebellion. That would have meant Puigdemont facing lesser charges than his fellow separatists, some of whom were sentenced to up to 13 years in prison this week.\n\nDemonstrations in Catalonia began hours after Monday's verdicts, with some 10,000 protesters swarming Barcelona's airport, causing more than 100 flights to be canceled. At least 130 people were injured. Demonstrators in Barcelona on Wednesday set up barricades, torched cars and launched projectiles at police.\n\nCatalan unions called a general strike in the region for Friday.", "description": "Former Catalan leader handed himself over \u2018voluntarily.\u2019", "authors": ["Judith Mischke", "Emma Anderson"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/h_54223238-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
