Eddie Jones went undercover at the World Cup semi-final as South Africa edged Wales South Africa's analysts face a formidable task to find many weaknesses in the England team - after Jones's side crushed the New Zealand juggernaut 19-7 in the other semi-final on Saturday. The Australian-born coach was caught with his cap pulled low over his face as he watched intently with a pen in hand - as England's first final since 2007 draws closer.\n\nHalfpenny was among three changes made by Gatland, replacing ankle-injury victim Liam Williams, while number eight Ross Moriarty took over from Josh Navidi and fit-again centre Jonathan Davies returned for Owen Watkin.\n\nSouth Africa were without injured wing Cheslin Kolbe, so S'bu Nikosi deputised and Springboks scrum-half Faf de Klerk made an immediate contribution through a kick and chase into Wales' 22, but North cleared the danger and Wales moved confidently up field.\n\nBoth teams readily resorted to tactical kicking, but Wales looked to have be more creative, with scrum-half Gareth Davies prominent as he marked reaching 50 caps.\n\nThe opening 10 minutes were much slower and of less intensity than England's semi-final against New Zealand yesterday.\n\nSouth Africa looked to attack off first-phase ball as De Klerk pulled the strings and his half-back partner Pollard kicked the Springboks ahead through a 15th-minute penalty.\n\nBut it was cancelled out three minutes later when Biggar found the target with a wide-angled penalty, only for Wales to concede a scrum penalty in a game dominated by set-pieces, and Pollard stepped up to make it 6-3.\n\nEngland head coach Eddie Jones and his defence specialist John Mitchell watched from the stands as both sides struggled to find any pattern or rhythm.\n\nWing Josh Adams of Wales goes over the try line to score his team's first try during the Rugby World Cup 2019 Semi-Final\n\nThe Springboks broke the try deadlock as Damian de Allende powered over the line in the 57th minute (pictured)\n\nWales' wing George North runs with the ball past South Africans as the match started off with both teams kicking a lot\n\nWales fans descend on the International Stadium in Yokohama and wave their flags proudly as the highly-anticipated match kicked off\n\nFans wearing green coveralls cheer during the Japan 2019 Rugby World Cup semi-final match as Wales struggled to get going against the Springboks\n\nA South Africa fan dons a stunned dress as she smiles from the stand.

Cameras at the International Stadium captured half a dozen Japanese men wearing Wales shirts and waving leek. They were joined by another local supporter who was painted in their rivals' South Africa's colours - but decided to join in anyway. Leeks are an official symbol of Wales, with legends claiming their patron Saint David ordered his men to wear leeks on their helmets into battle.\n\nThere was precious little ambition either, with boot to ball being the dominant and predictable approach.\n\nWales needed to get some width on their game and stretch a Springboks outfit seemingly intent on a no-frills approach, despite De Klerk's verve, but Pollard's reliable boot then put them six points clear.\n\nIt was a dismal end to the first-half for Wales, despite Biggar kicking a second penalty, as Francis and North departed the action in rapid succession.\n\nThe huge crowd in the 72,000-seat made themselves heard at half time as they sang their hearts out to Sweet Caroline by Neil Diamond.\n\nBiggar gave Wales just the start they needed to the second period, kicking them level with a third penalty.\n\nWith the stakes so high, there appeared little chance of the game opening up, and it was 9-9 with 30 minutes left.\n\nSouth Africa's scrum-half Faf de Klerk (centre) kicks the ball following a ruck during the World Cup clash on Sunday\n\nTempers flared as the second halfway got underway, with Wales' towering lock Jake Ball squaring up to South Africa's scrum-half Faf de Klerk\n\nAn adorable young Wales fan wears a dragon costume as he waves the country's flag in the International Stadium on Sunday\n\nThe first half was cagey as both sides opted to kick.
