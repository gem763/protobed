She repeatedly stressed that she wanted the House to move \u201cexpeditiously\u201d to uncover new facts about Mr. Trump\u2019s attempts to pressure President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to investigate Joseph R. Biden Jr., one of his leading political rivals, for corruption.\n\nBut Democrats did not intend to hold a vote on the House floor to formally authorize the inquiry, as has been done in the past, lawmakers and senior party officials said. Instead, they were planning to use the coming weeks to build as strong a case as they could against Mr. Trump, with an eye toward drafting articles of impeachment against him. That would mean the House would not vote on the matter unless the articles of impeachment were brought to the floor.", "description": "Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the House should work \u201cexpeditiously\u201d to build its case.
