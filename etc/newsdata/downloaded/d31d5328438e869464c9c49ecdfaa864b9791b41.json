Gavin Newsom slams PG&E for power outages: 'Greed and mismanagement'", "language": "en", "text": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Thursday lambasted the state\u2019s largest power utility, Pacific Gas & Electric, for the blackouts that have left hundreds of thousands of people without power this week.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\n\u201cThis is not a climate change story as much as a story about greed and mismanagement over the course of decades. Neglect, a desire to advance not public safety but profits,\u201d Newsom said during a press conference.\n\nOn Tuesday, the bankrupt utility company turned off power for roughly 800,000 customers -- roughly 2 million individuals -- in northern, central and coastal California as a precaution against sparking wildfires amid conditions of extreme wind and dry weather.\n\nNewsom blamed the company\u2019s management for the outages while suggesting that PG&E, whose service extends to about 16 million customers in California, was too big.\n\nThe company announced on Thursday that it had started to restore power to about 126,000 customers as weather conditions improved.\n\n\u201cWhat has occurred in the last 48 hours is unacceptable,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cWhat has occurred in the last 48 hours is kids staying home from school, parents that can\u2019t bathe their kids and folks that come home from work who can\u2019t even find a way to get into their garage.

It was the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California history.
