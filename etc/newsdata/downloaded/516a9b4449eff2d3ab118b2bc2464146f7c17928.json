The delayed ammunition deal is part of what sources described as a broader slowdown in State Department approvals of commercial arms sales to Ukraine.\n\nThe White House and State Department did not respond to requests for comment on the delays.\n\nThe ammunition deal was held up to prior to the July 25 conversation in which Trump reportedly urged his Ukranian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, to investigate Biden\u2019s son on eight separate occasions. However, any slowdown in support for the Ukranian military is likely to draw scrutiny as Democrats pursue an impeachment inquiry focused on concerns related to Trump\u2019s conversations with Zelensky about Biden\u2019s son, who had business dealings in Ukraine.\n\nTrump\u2019s conversation with Zelensky was reportedly part of a whistleblower complaint made to the inspector general of the intelligence community. Reports of the complaint prompted concerns Trump was asking a foreign country to intervene to hurt Biden\u2019s presidential campaign. The Washington Post reported Monday evening that Trump ordered nearly $400 in military aid to Ukraine withheld just one week prior to that call.\n\nThat aid package was released earlier this month and administration officials told the Post it had been delayed because of concerns about \u201ccorruption\u201d in Ukraine. The ammunition sale, in the meantime, remains in limbo.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

The deal is a direct commercial sale, which is negotiated between private companies and foreign buyers, but must be licensed by the U.S. State Department. In this case, the export license was submitted to the State Department in November of last year and has not been approved, according to a source, who was directly involved with the deal, but asked not to be identified because of potential professional retaliation.\n\n\u201cThis was a simple item,\u201d said the source, whose company has had previous State Department-approved shipments to Ukraine approved without problems.\n\nThe State Department does not give exact timelines for export approvals, but its guidance says licenses typically take a minimum of one to two months. Ukroboronprom, the Ukrainian state-owned arms conglomerate, the official buyer of the ammunition, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAmmunition is crucial to Ukraine\u2019s military, which has been battling Russian-backed separatists in the country\u2019s eastern region since 2014. Prior to the war, Ukraine\u2019s sole small-arms ammunition factory was located in Luhansk. That city is now part of the territory controlled by the separatists. In 2017, then-Ukrainian President Petro Petroshenko allocated money to help build a new ammunition factory, but it does not produce the NATO-compliant ammunition that is part of the delayed U.S. arms sale.\n\nFor NATO-member countries, using a standard caliber allows them to share ammunition stores. In Ukraine, obtaining supplies of NATO-compliant ammunition is regarded as a sign the country is moving toward Western equipment and away from Moscow\u2019s sphere of influence. \u201cTo not approve [Western] exports is to push Ukraine to Russia,\u201d said the source familiar with the sale.\n\nA second source involved in arms transfers to Ukraine said the stalled ammunition transfer appears to reflect a larger slowdown, if not a freeze, on approvals for direct commercial sales to Ukraine.", "description": "A separate $10 million sale of ammunition has mysteriously remained in limbo for almost a year with no explanation from the Trump administration.", "authors": ["Sharon Weinberger", "Hunter Walker", "Sean D.
