He was booked as a guest on Fox News\u2019 Sunday morning talk show, despite a desire by some conservatives that he stop talking. And he gave a speech to a Republican group in the Raleigh, North Carolina, area.\n\nBut Mulvaney\u2019s job has been anything but normal since the news conference Thursday at which he seemingly undermined the Trump administration\u2019s strategy for avoiding impeachment by acknowledging that Trump had sought a quid pro quo for providing Ukraine with American aid. In the chaotic aftermath, the president\u2019s Republican allies are questioning Mulvaney\u2019s savvy and intelligence even as the Trump campaign is defiantly turning one of his lines from the news conference into a T-shirt.\n\nAs he approaches his anniversary in the White House, Mulvaney, 52, a former South Carolina congressman and Trump budget director, finds himself in a strange netherworld.\n\nThe word \u201cacting\u201d is still conspicuously stuck to his title, even though Trump could remove it at any time. His relationship with the president runs hot and cold, depending on the day, though never quite cold enough for Trump to fire him.That is in part because it\u2019s unclear who might be willing to take a job that Trump struggled to fill when it last came open.\n\nBut Thursday\u2019s briefing in the White House press room was a prize winner in \u201cthe annals of disastrous appearances by White House chiefs of staff,\u201d according to Christopher Whipple, author of \u201cThe Gatekeepers: How the White House Chiefs of Staff Define Every Presidency.\u201d\n\nMulvaney\u2019s ostensible purpose was to announce that Trump had chosen his own golf resort in Doral, Florida, as the site for next year\u2019s Group of 7 summit meeting of world leaders \u2014 a controversy of its own, but one that Mulvaney appeared prepared to take heat for.\n\n\u201cI get the criticisms,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cBut, no, there\u2019s no issue here on him profiting from this in any way, shape or form.\u201d\n\nThen the questions quickly turned from whether Trump was using the presidency to enrich himself to why his administration recently froze $391 million in congressionally allocated military aid to Ukraine and whether it was an effort to coerce its government into pursuing political investigations sought by Trump.\n\nPeppered by skeptical questions from reporters, Mulvaney was remarkably nonchalant in conceding a central component of the Democratic case for impeachment: that the aid was delayed, in part, because of Trump\u2019s belief in an unfounded conspiracy theory that a Democratic National Committee email server hacked in 2016 may be hidden in Ukraine and could hold data showing that Russia did not interfere in that year\u2019s election.\n\nMulvaney dismissed questions about whether it was appropriate to delay the aid, saying, \u201cThere\u2019s going to be political influence in foreign policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cGet over it,\u201d he declared.\n\nIt did not take long for Mulvaney to release a statement trying to take back his admission that indeed the release of aid to Ukraine had been linked to Trump\u2019s demand for an inquiry. White House aides privately expressed shock that Mulvaney said what he said. Several of Trump\u2019s advisers \u2014 concerned the president didn\u2019t seem to process what had happened \u2014 told him there was a problem.\n\nTrump, though, grew unhappy only when he saw coverage of the news conference, according to people close to him. Even then, he was not as angry as many aides have seen him before.\n\nAsked about Mulvaney\u2019s comments, Trump said he hadn\u2019t watched them and appeared unbothered. \u201cI think he clarified it,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe extended Trump apparatus seemed to embrace parts of the Mulvaney message. By midday, a black T-shirt with \u201cGet Over It\u201d in white letters was available from the Trump 2020 campaign for $30.\n\nBut despite the effort to project confidence, Republicans in Congress and at least one prominent conservative media figure expressed dismay at Mulvaney\u2019s words, which contradicted weeks of White House messaging.", "description": "WASHINGTON -- On the day after he made more news than any chief of staff in recent White House history -- much less an acting one -- Mick Mulvaney went about his business as usual.He finalized plans for hosting Republican members of Congress this weekend at Camp David, a form of outreach he has regularly", "authors": ["Michael Crowley", "Maggie Haberman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/sVjbZPwNwRLpD2By8u1njQ--~B/aD0zMjU2O3c9NDg4MztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/9458c5c0-f10f-11e9-bab6-fcc9bdef4e3e", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
