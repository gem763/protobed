Who's going to develop dedicated apps, that make use of that two-screen real estate, for a very, very niche product?\" he said.\n\n\"Can you see Microsoft spending time and resources itself developing apps for a niche version of someone else's platform?\"\n\nThe phone will have a pen, allowing users to take handwritten notes like they can on a Samsung Galaxy Note.\n\nIn some ways, he said Microsoft would have been better off releasing another Windows phone, \"or at least one that allowed users to utilise the Windows application ecosystem, which is massive. It's the key business application platform.\"\n\nThe timing of the Duo, coming just when phone users are beginning to question the value of expensive mobile phones, and are looking increasingly at mid-tier phones, is also going to be a problem for Microsoft, publisher at the mobile phone comparison site WhistleOut, Joe Hanlon, said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It's certainly a risky time for Microsoft to dive back into the phone market, and with a device like the Duo that is bound to be both expensive and will rely on novelty to generate interest in it,\" he said.\n\n\"We know consumers are already struggling to justify the high price of new phones, so you have to wonder how many will see the value in buying one with two screens.\"\n\nOne way to convince users to pay for another expensive phone would be to tie it in closely with other Surface devices that run Windows 10.\n\n\"It would be great to see Microsoft develop some meaningful connection between the Duo and Windows 10, so that using a 'Surface' phone feels like an extension of what you do on your laptop,\" Mr Hanlon said.\n\n\"Google does a decent job of this with apps like Chrome and Maps, but you can imagine that Microsoft could take this idea much further, given how many people still use Windows as their primary operating system.\"\n\nMicrosoft declined to comment on whether it was working to create such a symbiosis between Windows and the Surface Duo, but it has been working to do almost exactly that with the world's No. 1 phone maker, Samsung.\n\nAt the launch of Samsung's productivity-oriented Galaxy Note 10 in August, Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella announced he had struck a deal with Samsung, under which photos and documents on the Note 10 would be synced with Windows PCs via Microsoft's OneDrive storage system.\n\nAs part of that deal, Note users also get a Microsoft application known as Link To Windows, which lets them integrate the Note directly into Windows on a PC when the two devices are joined by a USB cable.\n\nWith the Duo not due to be released for roughly a year \u2013 it's officially slated for \"holiday 2020\" \u2013 the company should have more than enough time to come up with the same tools for its own Android phone.", "description": "Microsoft spent billions acquiring Nokia, only to abandon the mobile phone business four years later.
