Mr. Khashoggi wore many professional hats throughout his career, one of which was as a freelance online blogger for Washington\u2019s other newspaper \u2014 I believe it\u2019s called the \u201cPost?\u201d\n\nIn the time since Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s unjustifiable and heinous murder in the Saudi consulate, the Post has taken up the cause of memorializing him. And the paper this week has devoted an entire section to the slain journalist\u2019s memory, featuring pieces from, among others, his editor at the Post, Karen Attiah, and the columnist David Ignatius.\n\nOne byline sticks out among those memorializing Jamal Khashoggi in the pages of the Post, however. That is Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Mr. Erdogan, of course, is the president of Turkey, where the brutal murder occurred.\n\nTurkey is a beautiful and complex country, and Istanbul is a terrific city in which to be a tourist, an art-lover, and most of all, a cat. (See here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kedi_(2016_film) But Turkey is a terrible place to be a journalist.\n\nAccording to the Committee to Protect Journalists, Turkey has for three years running imprisoned more journalists than any other country \u2014 nearly three times as many have been thrown behind bars in China. Just last month, Turkey began court proceedings against journalists from Bloomberg News and other outlets who dared to report on a 2018 currency shock in the country. They have been accused of trying to undermine Turkey\u2019s \u201ceconomic stability,\u201d simply by reporting facts. The Turkish government often uses the weight of the legal system to silence reporters it deems unhelpful.\n\nYet in the pages of today\u2019s Post, President Erdogan is allowed to style himself a champion of freedom and what he calls the \u201crules-based international system.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the wake of Khashoggi\u2019s demise, my administration adopted a policy of transparency,\u201d Mr. Erdogan writes. \u201cIt is in our best interest, and in the best interest of humanity, to ensure that such a crime is not committed anywhere again. Combating impunity is the easiest way to accomplish that goal. We owe it to Jamal\u2019s family.\u201d Nowhere in the piece or the pages surrounding it is made a mention of Mr. Erodgan\u2019s record of suppressing speech with, yes, impunity.\n\nJackson Diehl, the Post\u2019s deputy editorial page editor, explained the decision to grant Mr. Erodgan the freedom to write such a ridiculous piece.\n\n\u201cIn an effort to provide our readers with the full debate on the issues, Washington Post Opinions aims to publish op-eds that are newsworthy and informative, even if we do not agree with the perspective. We found Erdogan\u2019s views relevant given that he is the president of the country in which Jamal Khashoggi was murdered, has overseen the investigation of the case, and has made the assassination a major issue in Turkey\u2019s diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia,\u201d he said in a statement to The Washington Times.\n\nThe Post has for the past several year made a big show of standing up for the free press against the supposed assaults of Donald Trump, going so far as to plaster the slogan \u201cDemocracy Dies in Darkness\u201d across its web page and print edition. But where democracy dies, irony lives.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
