It has been going on since long before I even got Elected (the Insurance Policy!). A total Scam!\" Trump tweeted Thursday.\n\nBut Trump has also been unsparing in his attitude toward Senate Republicans who have chided his dealings with Ukraine that are at the heart of the impeachment probe -- especially Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah.\n\n\u201cThe Never Trumper Republicans, though on respirators with not many left, are in certain ways worse and more dangerous for our Country than the Do Nothing Democrats,\u201d Trump tweeted Wednesday afternoon. \u201cWatch out for them, they are human scum!\u201d\n\nAt an energy event in Pittsburgh on Wednesday and at a Cabinet meeting on Monday, Trump drew a contrast between the parties by saying Democrats \"stick together\" while he has to deal with detractors like Romney.\n\n\u201cI think [Democrats] are lousy politicians,\u201d he said during the Monday meeting. \u201cBut two things that they have, they are vicious and they stick together. They don\u2019t have Mitt Romney in their midst.\u201d\n\nThe president and Romney have butted heads for years, long before the 2012 GOP presidential nominee was elected to the Senate last year. But recently, Romney has criticized Trump for his move to withdraw troops from Syria and his strategy with Turkey, as well as for his highly controversial phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which he sought an investigation related to the Bidens.\n\nRomney said Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky was \u201cdeeply troubling,\u201d and that his request to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son was \u201cbrazen and unprecedented.\u201d Romney also suggested it was simply \u201cpolitically motivated.\u201d\n\nRomney is not the only Republican senator to condemn the president. Sens. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Ben Sasse, R-Neb., have called out the president\u2019s behavior as well.\n\nSasse said there was \u201cterrible stuff\u201d in the transcript of the president\u2019s phone call.\n\nMurkowski, last week, told reporters that she was specifically concerned about allegations that Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t hold up foreign aid that we had previously appropriated for a political initiative,\u201d Murkowski said. \u201cPeriod.\u201d\n\nThe heart of the debate surrounding the Trump-Zelensky phone call is whether Trump linked the U.S. military aid to his request to investigate Hunter Biden\u2019s role on the Ukrainian natural gas firm Burisma Holdings and the elder Biden's involvement in ousting a prosecutor who had been looking at it. The White House and House GOP lawmakers have repeatedly insisted there was no quid pro quo, though top diplomat Bill Taylor challenged such claims in testimony this week.\n\nMeanwhile, the impeachment push is posing a test for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. The shrewd political tactician raised eyebrows when he recently contradicted the president\u2019s account of a purported phone call the two had earlier this month. Trump has said that McConnell, R-Ky., approved of the content of his phone call with Zelensky.\n\nBut this week, McConnell said he did not recall having the conversation with the president.\n\n\u201cWe have not had any conversations on this subject,\u201d he said Tuesday.\n\nTRUMP ALLIES PUSH BACK ON 'QUID PRO QUO,' SAY ENVOY TESTIFIED UKRAINE INITIALLY UNAWARE OF AID HOLDUP\n\nMcConnell, though, is apparently telegraphing that Republicans\u2019 approach to dealing with the impeachment inquiry should be to criticize the process Democrats are using.\n\n\u201cThe due process argument is working,\u201d a senior Senate GOP aide told Fox News Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s something everyone outside of Washington understands and is a good offensive posture for every congressional Republican to be in as Democrats continue to operate behind closed doors.\u201d\n\nBut McConnell addressed head-on this week the claim that he is telling Republicans to defend the president.\n\n\u201cEach of my members can speak for themselves,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cThe process in the House to which the president has been subjected is totally unprecedented and totally unfair.\u201d\n\nMcConnell added: \u201cAs far as how our members feel about various aspects of this, they can speak for themselves.\u201d\n\nRepublican support in the Senate is critical in order to keep Trump in office, should he be formally impeached.\n\nAll that is needed to impeach him in the House is a simple majority vote by those lawmakers present and voting. But at that point, removal from the Oval Office is hardly a certainty. The Senate would have to hold a \u201ctrial\u201d\u2014a proceeding that McConnell has indicated he has \u201cno choice\u201d but to hold.\n\nMCCONNELL SAYS HE'D HAVE 'NO CHOICE' BUT TO TAKE UP IMPEACHMENT ARTICLES IF HOUSE APPROVES THEM\n\nIt takes a two-thirds vote to convict a president and actually remove him.\n\nFor now, Trump's GOP Senate firewall remains in place. But according to a Daily Caller report, only a handful of senators have explicitly ruled out voting to remove Trump from office in an impeachment trial.\n\nThe only senators to outright say they were against voting to remove Trump were Sens. Cindy Hyde-Smith and Roger Wicker of Mississippi, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, Rob Portman of Ohio, Mike Rounds of South Dakota, and Jerry Moran of Kansas.\n\nOthers expressed they were not necessarily in favor of the impeachment inquiry but did not completely rule it out.", "description": "President Trump is taking an even more aggressive stance toward\u00a0Republican critics\u00a0-- even by his bare-knuckle standards -- in an apparent bid to keep any wavering lawmakers in line after a rocky couple weeks for the administration in the impeachment probe.", "authors": ["Brooke Singman", "Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News.
