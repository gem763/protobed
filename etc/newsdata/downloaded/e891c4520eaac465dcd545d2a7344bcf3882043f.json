Why not just promise a gazillion? Joe Biden tried selling his child-care tax credit plan yesterday by lamenting that the US tax code provides deductions for racehorses but not for child care. His plan, Biden promised, would put into the workforce six times as many adult women as actually exist in the US at the moment.\n\nIt\u2019s tough to get this much wrong in so short a time, but here we are:\n\nDespite a US population of only 330 million, Joe Biden says child tax credit would put 720 million women back into the workforce. That\u2019s like double the population of the US. pic.twitter.com/DgChhZRzFl \u2014 Steve Guest (@SteveGuest) September 17, 2019\n\nYou get a tax break for [a] racehorse, why in God\u2019s name couldn\u2019t we provide an $8000 tax credit for everybody who has childcare costs? It would put \u2014 it would put seven hundred and twenty million back \u2014 million women \u2014 back in the workforce. It would increase the GDP, to sound like a wonk here, by about eight tenths of one percent. It would grow the economy.\n\nEven before we get to the math, the current tax code actually does provide deductions for child care as well as dependent care. The child has to be younger than 13 and the benefit is capped at $3000 for one or $6000 for two or more. Biden\u2019s tax credit would give more cash and apply it up front rather than as a deduction, so it\u2019s different \u2014 but it\u2019s hardly the gamechanger Biden\u2019s selling. And yes, the tax code actually does provide \u201ctax breaks\u201d for a racehorse investment as well as child care.\n\nBut the gaffe here on math is even worse than Guest suggests. According to the BLS, the US has 125.7 million women age 20 or older, with a 59.0% participation rate. That\u2019s below the participation rate of 71.7% for men of the same age bracket, but it\u2019s the highest participation rate for adult women in six years. During the Obama administration, the adult female participation rate fell from 61% when Biden and Barack Obama took office (in the middle of the Great Recession, no less), dropped below 59.0% for good in July 2013, and finished up at 58.3% when Obama and Biden left office in January 2017. August\u2019s 59.0% is the best of the Trump administration so far.\n\n(Worth noting: Men fared slightly worse over the same period. Their labor force participation rate started at 75.2% in February 2009 and declined steadily all during the Obama-Biden administration. It\u2019s been below 72.0% since May 2015.)\n\nSo how many adult women are not already in the US labor force? BLS puts it at 51.6 million as of August. It\u2019s tough to get 720 million out of that number, and even tougher to find it among the 2.5 million adult women counted as unemployed but in the workforce. The female unemployment rate is at 3.3% now, more than a full point better than it was when Biden and Obama left office (4.4%, although it was 6.8% when they first took office, too).\n\nBy the way, the Trump administration has done a pretty good job of growing the adult-female workforce. They have added 2.3 million more adult women to the workforce since taking office in January 2017. That growth in 2.5 years nearly equals the eight-year growth in the adult-female workforce during the Obama-Biden administration (2.9 million).\n\nBasically, Joe Biden pulled this number from the time-honored political source known as one\u2019s own backside. There\u2019s no way of knowing how many women would enter the workforce with an $8,000 tax credit for child care, but it\u2019s not going to be 720 million, and likely won\u2019t be 720 thousand or 72 thousand either. It\u2019s an idiotic argument buttressed by fantasy numbers in the head of a candidate who had eight years to solve the problem he\u2019s highlighting now as if it just suddenly occurred to him.", "description": "Math is hard.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/biden-720-million-women.png", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
