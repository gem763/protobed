But that\u2019s the owner\u2019s fault,\u201d one said.\n\nREAD MORE Protest Planned Outside Perth's Rapture Nightclub After Gross Drink Spiking Response\n\nMeanwhile around 20 people protesting the owner\u2019s remarks and three men believed to be undercover police were seen congregating outside the venue.\n\nThe protest was planned via the Facebook event \u2018Protest At The Rapture Nightclub\u2019.\n\n\u201cObviously we\u2019ve all seen how (Mr Scott) completely ignored and even ridiculed a patron who claimed her drink was spiked at his venue,\u201d the event organiser wrote.\n\n\u201cIt is important that we as a community try and work together to stop the Rapture Nightclub which holds disgusting values from running.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we all work together and hold protest we can change the way the nightclub is running.\u201d\n\nNeil Scott, who has been running clubs for 38 years, welcomed the protest, claiming he\u2019d like to see the faces of the people who have been abusing him.\n\n\u201cIt will be good to see the faces of the up to now, anonymous haters hiding behind tag names,\u201d Scott told Daily Mail. \u201cThen there are a lot of messages of support and some telling me that Shantel was a brat in school.\u201d\n\nTwo other women told the publication that they refused to boycott the club because they\u2019ve \u201calways been treated really well\u201d at Rapture.\n\n\u201cWe know the security guards. Yeah, the owner could\u2019ve responded better to the girl\u2019s claims but in the end, he did review the footage,\u201d one of them said.\n\nTwo others labelled the drink spiking claims as \u201cjust a bunch of bullshit\u201d but agreed that the owner\u2019s response was \u201cdisgusting.\u201d\n\nLast week, 19-year-old Shantel Smith shared a Messenger exchange with the nightclub where she informs them that her drink was spiked during a night at their establishment.\n\nThe social media manager of the club responded by asking if she\u2019s \u201cworth someone spiking your drink.\u201d\n\nDespite the post going viral with punters voicing their fury at the Perth hotspot, Scott refused to back down.\n\nHe later reiterated his comments to The West Australian \u2013 particularly the part where he questions why anyone would spike Shantel\u2019s drink.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not a particularly attractive girl. It\u2019s just implausible to imagine that she had her drink spiked, it just doesn\u2019t sort of add up. She\u2019s just a very plain Jane type of girl. I can\u2019t understand why anybody would be possessed by her.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s also taken his fucked up comments onto Facebook, posting CCTV footage with the caption \u201cThe large girl with the white top, the short black skirt and the black and white shoes is Shantel Smith, the girl who claimed to have had her drink spiked.\u201d\n\nShantel spoke to Nine News after her Instagram post went viral, explaining that she woke up \u201cin a toilet stall. There was vomit everywhere and I was foaming at the mouth.\u201d\n\nShe also slammed Rapture again, saying \u201cI just couldn\u2019t believe I was being blamed for something that happened to me without my knowledge.\u201d", "description": "Perth clubgoers have abandoned Rapture nightclub after following comments by owner Neil Scott about an alleged drink spiking incident.", "authors": ["Matt Galea"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/pjimage-48.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
