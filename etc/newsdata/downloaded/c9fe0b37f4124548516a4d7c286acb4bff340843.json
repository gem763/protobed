Treasuries are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, so they don\u2019t carry the credit risk that is embedded in corporate bonds. Those with relatively shorter maturities are less sensitive to changes in interest rates than their longer-maturity counterparts. But this high degree of safety means they won\u2019t provide exceptional returns. So, keeping costs low is an important consideration when choosing a Treasury fund. Schwab Short-Term U.S. Treasury ETF (SCHO) provides great exposure to these stable assets. Its strong index-tracking record and rock-bottom price tag support a Morningstar Analyst Rating of Silver.\n\nThis exchange-traded fund tracks the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Treasury 1-3 Year Index, which includes Treasury bonds with one to three years remaining to maturity. Indexing Treasuries in this way is a sound approach for exposure to a specific portion of the yield curve. It is difficult for active managers to recoup their fees while offering comparable exposure to Treasuries on this narrow segment of the yield curve, as Treasuries are one of the most competitively priced areas of the bond market and managers have little leeway to take additional duration risk. And they can\u2019t take additional credit risk without venturing into other areas of the market. Active Treasury bond managers derive most of their active returns from yield-curve positioning. Those strategies, or broader Treasury index funds, may be more suitable for those who don\u2019t have a view about the best place to be on the yield curve.", "description": "Silver-rated Schwab Short-Term U.S. Treasury ETF provides low-cost exposure to high-quality, shorter-maturity bonds.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt4eb669caa7dc65b2/blt173364b9194b4b1d/5c76b9d692df13976042041d/DanielSotiroff_1x1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-03-22"}
