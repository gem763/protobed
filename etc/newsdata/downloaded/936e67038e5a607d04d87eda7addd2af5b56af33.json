As Francis injected the clear liquid into Mayhew\u2019s backside, the patient went into cardiac arrest. Francis panicked and fled the scene, leaving the victim with her mother who called 911, according to prosecutors.\n\nSISTERS REUNITED AFTER 75 YEARS AFTER ONLINE DNA TEST\n\nDays later, Francis, 39, fled to London where she remained for four years trying to evade extradition.\n\nIn August, Francis was extradited to the U.S. and arraigned on charges of criminally negligent homicide. She pleaded not guilty at the time.\n\nFrancis\u2019 attorney Kevin O\u2019Donnell has said his client is \u201cincredibly remorseful.\u201d\n\nFrancis will address the victim\u2019s family at her sentencing on Nov. 14. She will face no more than a year behind bars under the terms of the extradition agreement.\n\nAnother unusual condition of her extradition agreement is that she won't spend any time on Rikers Island, the notorious jail complex that the New York City Council has now voted to close by 2026. She'll be jailed in suburban Suffolk County on Long Island.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "A New York woman\u00a0pleaded guilty to criminally negligent homicide after she\u00a0accidentally killed a patient\u00a0in a botched plastic surgery procedure then fled the country, according to federal prosecutors.", "authors": ["Morgan Phillips"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/06/Gavel-Syringe-.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
