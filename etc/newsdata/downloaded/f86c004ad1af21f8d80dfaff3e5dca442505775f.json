He said: \"I've spent the last four summers in Guadeloupe playing DI Jack Mooney (solving over 20 murder cases in my time there!)\n\n\"It's been a hugely rewarding and unforgettable experience, working with incredibly talented actors, directors and crew while discovering a magical part of the world.\n\n\"However, it's time to move on and explore other opportunities - preferably nearer the Arctic Circle.\"\n\n\"I'm confident that Death In Paradise will go from strength to strength and viewers will share my enthusiasm for Jack's successor!\" he added.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nHe first appeared in the show in 2017, when the Caribbean police team followed a lead to London and ended up taking him back to the fictional island of Saint Marie.\n\nExecutive producer Tim Key said: \u201cWe will all miss him enormously. His story isn\u2019t over yet \u2013 viewers will have to see how, why and when Jack Mooney leaves, but I don\u2019t think there will be a dry eye in the house.\u201d\n\nDeath In Paradise, which is set on the fictional Caribbean island of Saint Marie, launched in 2011 with Ben Miller in the lead role.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\n(Image: FilmMagic)\n\nKris Marshall took over for series three to six, then Ardal joined the show for the sixth season. DI's Mooney exit storyline has not been revealed.\n\nTommy Bulfin, commissioning editor, BBC Drama, said: \"We will be sad to say goodbye to DI Jack Mooney when the time comes, our audiences have loved the joy and humour he has brought to the Saint Marie police force over the last four series.\n\n\"Everyone at the BBC would like thank Ardal for his time on Death In Paradise but it's not the end just yet; as one door closes another one opens, and we are very excited about what's to come in the next chapter.\"\n\n*Death in Paradise returns on BBC One in January 2020", "description": "The former Father Ted star will be making his final appearance in series nine of the BBC drama", "authors": ["Mark Jefferies", "Image", "Bbc", "Filmmagic"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20546927.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Death-in-Paradise.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
