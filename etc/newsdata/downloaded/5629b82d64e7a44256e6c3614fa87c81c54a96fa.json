Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, told the Washington Post. \"Democrats come out, they\u2019re all spun up, Adam Schiff makes all kinds of statements, and then when the facts come out -- Whoa, different story!\n\n\u201cThis seems to be the same kind of deal,\" Jordan added.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like we haven\u2019t seen this movie before.

Mark Meadows, R-N.C., echoed the idea that such complaints hamper the president in his work.\n\n\u201cIt would have a real chilling effect on dialogue between important leaders if they think that every time someone who overhears a conversation that wasn\u2019t even party to the conversation is going to file a whistleblower complaint and it\u2019ll end up on the front page of periodicals across the country,\u201d Meadows said, according to The Post.\n\nRep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., said private phone calls with foreign leaders are part of the president\u2019s job.\n\n\u201cThe fact is, the president, to quote John Marshall, is the \u2018sole organ\u2019 of U.S. external relations and has to have conversations in confidence with foreign leaders,\" he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no practical way to conduct diplomacy without it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact is, the president ... has to have conversations in confidence with foreign leaders. There\u2019s no practical way to conduct diplomacy without it.\u201d \u2014 Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wis.\n\nBut he added he\u2019s in favor of transparency.\n\nThe administration is also taking flak for not sharing the complaint with Congress.\n\nMost Republicans avoided commenting on the complaint, and while a few did express concerns, they were limited.\n\nRep. Patrick Toomey, R-Pa., said it would be \u201cwildly inappropriate\u201d for a president to ask a foreign government to get involved in a U.S. election, but added he isn\u2019t accusing Trump of doing that.\n\nRep. Chris Stewart, R-Utah, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, broke with Republicans in saying some on his side of the aisle might join Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., in subpoenaing the president's phone records.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly on the table,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I say that I want to protect congressional oversight, I really mean that.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTrump has denied any impropriety and in a Twitter message Friday, he called the unidentified whistleblower \"highly partisan,\" The Post reported.", "description": "Republicans in Congress Friday parroted President Trump\u2019s sentiments that a whistleblower who filed a complaint with the Inspector General over an apparent July phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president is acting \u201chighly partisan.\u201d", "authors": ["Brie Stimson", "U.S. Rep.
