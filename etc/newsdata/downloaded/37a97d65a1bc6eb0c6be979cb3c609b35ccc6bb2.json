Like Killing Eve\u2019s Sandra Oh & Jodie Comer, my latest obsession.\n\nI don\u2019t know why it always tickles me \u2013 I\u2019m friends with people I work with, for example. Maybe with Sandra & Jodie, it\u2019s because they fucking hate each other on TV? And because Jodie plays a literal psychopath murderer?\n\nAnyway, I\u2019ve been enjoying these photos today, so you should too.\n\nLoooooook they love each other.\n\nThen there\u2019s all the red carpet shots.\n\nLook at them holding hands ahdfksgdlshdl I can\u2019t handle it.\n\nExtremely cute areas.
