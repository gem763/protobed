However, \u201cbrand development in the U.S. is much easier, given regulatory nuances, which favors the U.S. operators who emphasize a traditional CPG model that relies more on high-margin finished goods, as opposed to specialty retail,\u201d she wrote in a note published Friday.\n\nWith that in mind, coupled with investors voicing a rising importance on profitability and strong cash positions, Azer recommended three companies with Outperform ratings:\n\nGreen Thumb Industries (GTBIF) with a $18.50 per share price target\n\nCuraleaf (CURLF) with a $10.50 per share price target\n\nCresco Labs (CRLBF) with a $14 per share price target\n\nJonell Santiago works at Green Thumb Industries cultivation center in Holyoke, MA.

While Cresco Labs can\u2019t say the same, the company impressed enough with its outsized early profitability and a \u201cfocused approach on key states (favoring depth over breadth), and reliance on higher-margin brands, (as opposed to retail,)\u201d she writes.\n\nOut of all three Outperform rated stocks, Green Thumb Industries won Cowen\u2019s highest conviction for its \u201cconsistent focus on shareholder returns\u201d thanks in part to the best positive EBITDA in absolute terms and strongest margins in the most recent quarter amongst Cowen\u2019s coverage.\n\nNone of the names, however, were able to escape the pressure that has hit the cannabis sector overall these past few months, with all three losing ground \u2014 including a 13% drop for Cresco Labs over the past three months.\n\nCresco's performance has been the weakest of Cowen's newly minted outperform-rated picks, falling 13% over the last three months.
