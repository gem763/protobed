(AP) - Jaroslav Halak was tested from the start, facing breakaways, odd-man rushes, numerous good chances on power plays.\n\nHe turned away every one and the Boston Bruins won yet another game in the desert.\n\nHalak stopped 35 shots, Brad Marchand scored and the Bruins extended their winning streak over the Arizona Coyotes to 15 straight games with a 1-0 win Saturday night.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to get in the game early and if you get tested early you stay focused more,\u201d Halak said. \u201cThat\u2019s what happened tonight.\u201d\n\nThe Bruins opened defense of their Eastern Conference title with a 2-1 victory over Dallas on Thursday night behind Tuukka Rask\u2019s 28 saves.\n\nBoston turned to Halak for Game 2 and the veteran was sharp against Arizona.\n\nHalak stopped Vinnie Hinostroza on a short breakaway in the first period and slid over to get a skate on Clayton Keller\u2019s shot from the slot. He also stopped Michael Grabner on a short-handed mini breakaway later in the period and had Phil Kessel muttering to himself with a glove save in the third.\n\nHalak faced a flurry of shots after Arizona pushed late in the third and turned those away, too, finishing off his 48th career shutout.\n\n\u201cHe was good like Tuukka the other night,\u201d Bruins coach Bruce Cassidy said. \u201cNot a lot of rebound issues, pucks were sticking to him and I think we did a good job of clearing the ones that didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nDarcy Kuemper stopped 23 shots to keep Arizona it in, but the Coyotes couldn\u2019t convert on numerous good scoring chances - just as they did in the opener at Anaheim. Arizona has not beaten Boston since 2010 in Prague.\n\n\u201cPlay like that, most of the nights you\u2019re going to come out on top,\u201d Coyotes center Derek Stepan said. \u201cI like tonight. Sometimes you get snake bitten. Their goaltender stood tall and we didn\u2019t bury them.\u201d\n\nThe Coyotes made one of the biggest offseason splashes by acquiring Kessel in a trade with Pittsburgh.\n\nKessel had an assist on Arizona\u2019s only goal in its opener on Thursday, but the Coyotes lost 2-1 to Anaheim.\n\nKuemper, who played well after Antti Raanta was injured last season, stopped 27 shots in that game and started again Saturday after Raanta was recalled from Tucson of the AHL.\n\nArizona controlled play most of the first period until Boston made a push. Marchand beat Kuemper to the stick side with a wrister from the left circle with less than two minutes left.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t see anything,\u201d Marchand said. \u201cI just tried to get it on net and it found its way in.\u201d\n\nKuemper made some difficult saves in the second period, stopping David Pasternak on one shot and sliding over for a spectacular save on Marchand\u2019s rebound attempt.\n\nKumper also stuffed Chris Wagner on a near breakaway early in the third period and gave the Coyotes a chance with several quality saves.\n\n\u201cHe had a really good game,\u201d Coyotes captain Oliver Ekman-Larsson said. \u201cI thought when we turned a couple pucks over in the second, he kept us in the game. It could have been a different game there. He\u2019s a good goalie and showed it tonight.\u201d\n\nNOTES: Arizona D Alex Goligoski played his 800th career game. \u2026 Boston C David Krejci made his season debut after missing the opening game with a lower-body injury. \u2026 The Coyotes are 0 for 4 on the power play this season after going 0 for 3 against Boston. \u2026 The Bruins have won nine straight in Arizona.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBoston plays at Vegas on Tuesday.\n\nArizona hosts the Golden Knights on Wednesday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/tag/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Jaroslav Halak was tested from the start, facing breakaways, odd-man rushes, numerous good chances on power plays.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Marshall"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/05/bruins_coyotes_hockey_19912_c0-151-3600-2249_s1770x1032.jpg?86a0ad2941f4f8cac64fde118e16286d6ebd0c8d", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
