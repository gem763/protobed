Summit", "language": "en", "text": "Iran said a British-flagged tanker it seized in July on alleged maritime violations is free to leave, ending a monthslong standoff with the U.K. ahead of a United Nations summit where it faces tough questions over attacks on rival Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil facilities.\n\nIranian forces commandeered the Stena Impero on accusations that it broke international maritime rules in the region. That came two weeks after it threatened to retaliate against the U.K. for impounding an Iranian tanker in the British overseas territory of Gibraltar in early July.\n\nU.K. authorities said the Iranian tanker, now called the Adrian Darya 1, was held for carrying oil to Syria in violation of European Union sanctions. Iran denied that, but indicated it would release the Stena Impero only after its own vessel reached its destination. U.S. and U.K. officials have said the Adrian Darya 1 unloaded its crude to Syria despite Iranian assurances. Tehran has said the oil was sold to a third party but gave no details.\n\n\u201cThe legal process has finished and based on that the conditions for letting the oil tanker go free have been fulfilled and the oil tanker can move,\u201d Ali Rabiei, Iran\u2019s government spokesman, said Monday, according to the official IRNA news agency.\n\nA spokesman for the Swedish owners of the Stena Impero said Iranian authorities hadn\u2019t notified the company that the tanker was free to leave. The \u201cvessel is still being held,\u201d he said.\n\nThe tanker crisis soured relations between Iran and the U.K. as the Trump administration pressures European allies to join its maximum-pressure campaign to isolate Tehran. The U.S. imposed crippling economic sanctions on Iran after withdrawing from the 2015 multilateral nuclear accord last year. But the European countries have worked to keep the deal alive.\n\nThe U.K.\u2019s new government, despite seeking close ties with the Trump administration, has continued to stand by the agreement, with Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab repeatedly saying the accord serves Europe\u2019s security interests.\n\nA boat operated by Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard Corps sailed near the Stena Impero on Aug. 22.

U.S. officials blamed Iran for the attacks, and Washington is seeking to build an international coalition to exert pressure on Tehran. The U.N.\u2019s General Assembly\u2014for which world leaders including President Trump and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani are gathering\u2014could provide a critical forum for the Trump administration\u2019s attempts.\n\nEuropean countries haven\u2019t blamed Iran for the Saudi attacks, stressing that time is needed to unearth all the facts. But they also have cast doubt on claims from Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels that they were behind them.\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif is expected to meet the remaining parties to the nuclear deal\u2014Germany, France, U.K., China and Russia\u2014on Wednesday. He and Mr. Rouhani also will hold bilateral talks during the summit.\n\nBefore the Stena Impero\u2019s release, the U.K. had said it would raise the issue at the U.N. summit.\n\nThe strikes in Saudi Arabia and the British-flagged vessel\u2019s seizure come after several attacks on commercial tankers in the Gulf of Oman, which the U.S. accused Iran of orchestrating. Tehran denied the allegation. The incidents compounded the risk for commercial shipping in the region, raising shipping premiums and pushing some vessel owners to avoid the region.\n\nThe U.K., meanwhile, sent a second warship to protect British vessels in the area and said it would join a U.S.-led coalition to protect maritime traffic there.\n\nThe standoff weighed on European efforts to provide Iran with relief from economic sanctions and salvage the nuclear deal. Tehran in recent months has breached some of the deal\u2019s terms after accusing the European parties\u2014the U.K., Germany and France\u2014of not doing enough to ensure Iran got the economic benefits it was from promised for curtailing its nuclear activities.\n\nDiplomatic relations between the U.K. and Iran have been further strained by the Islamic Republic\u2019s detention of several British-Iranians in its notorious Evin Prison. Iran has held charity worker Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe since 2016 and recently arrested anthropologist Kameel Ahmady. It also in July arrested another European dual-national, French-Iranian academic Fariba Adelkhah, on unspecified charges.\n\nU.S. sanctions have hit the Iranian industries hard, particularly oil exports, which Washington says it wants to slash to zero.\n\nThe seizure of the Iranian oil by Gibraltar was particularly damaging, as Iran\u2019s oil exports have fallen as low as 200,000 barrels a day, mostly to China and Syria, compared with 2.5 million barrels a day before the latest round of sanctions.\n\nTo that extent, the Iranian tanker\u2019s release from Gibraltar was a setback for the U.S.\u2019s attempts to enforce American sanctions in international maritime waters.\n\nIran and the U.K. didn\u2019t say if the release of the British-flagged vessel was linked to the Iranian tanker\u2019s freedom. But Iranian officials have previously indicated such a move would help end the detention of the Stena Impero.\n\nThe seizure of the Iranian tanker also infuriated many Iranians who saw in it a historical echo of London\u2019s attempts to dominate Iranian oil, especially its efforts to block a nationalization of it in the 1950s, which led to the overthrow of the country\u2019s democratically elected prime minister.\n\n\u2014Benoit Faucon in London and Laurence Norman in New York and Aresu Eqbali in Tehran contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Sune Engel Rasmussen at sune.rasmussen@wsj.com", "description": "Iran said a British-flagged tanker it seized in July on alleged maritime violations is free to leave, ending a monthslong standoff with the U.K. ahead of a United Nations summit where it faces tough questions over attacks on rival Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil facilities.", "authors": ["Sune Engel Rasmussen", "Sune.Rasmussen Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109666/social", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
