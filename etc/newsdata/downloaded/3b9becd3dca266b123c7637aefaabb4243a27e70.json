Hong Kong eventually lost 2-0 to Iran.\n\nSecurity was reportedly tight at the stadium, frisking the 14,000 fans attending the game for political materials and other prohibited items.\n\nThe Iranian side was reportedly so concerned about the political unrest that it requested to move the match. FIFA rejected the request.\n\nWhy are Hong Kong fans protesting?\n\nThe always tense relationship between China and Hong Kong has experienced even more unrest since June, when a since-withdrawn bill was proposed in the city-state that would have allowed for the extradition of residents to mainland China for trial.\n\nSuch protests have reached soccer before, when Manchester City played a local team in July.\n\nThe proposal immediately sparked widespread protests, some violent, that have continued even after the bill was pulled. Activists are now demanding an independent investigation into alleged police brutality against protesters, the release of all detained protesters and democratic reforms.\n\nAmnesty International has posted footage showing police officers beating subdued protesters, firing rubber bullets at protesters\u2019 heads and shooting tear gas at protesters trapped in confined areas.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Protests have raged for months in Hong Kong over a proposed extradition bill that would have allowed residents to be sent to mainland China.", "authors": ["Jack Baer", "Yahoo Sports Contributor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/pRzxri7CqeS9OAMaUpEBUQ--~B/aD01NTA0O3c9ODI1NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/f3313e80-d425-11e9-b2ff-687e13831fb1", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
