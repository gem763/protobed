After chuckling at the question, Harry answered, \"Part of this role and part of this job and this family, being under the pressure that it's under, inevitably, you know, stuff happens. But, look, we're brothers. We will always be brothers.\"\n\nThe royal brothers \u2014 and their wives Meghan, Duchess of Sussex and Kate, Duchess of Cambridge \u2014 have been the focus of intense public speculation and media coverage.

Prince Harry says the press is the \"worst reminder\" of her death.\n\nBradby also asked Meghan about her struggles with the British press following her marriage to Harry. She said it has been particularly challenging going through pregnancy and motherhood under the scrutiny of the paparazzi. \"Not many people have asked if I'm OK,\" Meghan said.\n\nEarlier this month, the Duchess of Sussex took legal action against the Mail on Sunday tabloid newspaper over what Harry called a \"ruthless campaign\" to smear Meghan.\n\nHarry and Meghan's 10 day trip to Africa with their son Archie in September marked their first official tour as a family. CBS News correspondent Debora Patta said the royal family were sending a clear signal with this trip: They want to be taken seriously and highlight issues ranging from the abuse of women to wildlife conservation.", "description": "The royal addressed the long swirling speculation that there is a rift between the brothers", "authors": ["Danielle Garrand"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/21/5ed6edd5-0718-4b13-baa5-be01a81e4fda/thumbnail/1200x630/48a72d6a6f4508677daa25fc746cc640/gettyimages-960049854.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
