The company said it would split its U.K. assurance practice into two distinct businesses and spend an additional \u00a330 million ($36.9 million) a year on the audit division. As part of that, PwC said it would hire more than 500 auditors in addition to the 5,500 it already employs.\n\nWrite to Nina Trentmann at Nina.Trentmann@wsj.com", "description": "An academic report commissioned by the professional services firm recommends handing oversight over audit partners\u2019 pay to an external body.", "authors": ["Nina Trentmann", "Nina.Trentmann Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-111758/social", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
