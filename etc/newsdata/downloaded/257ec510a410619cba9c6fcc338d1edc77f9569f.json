(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2015 Kirstjen Nielsen defended her legacy of carrying out President Donald Trump\u2019s policy of separating migrant families as his homeland security secretary Tuesday, saying she was simply following the law.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t regret enforcing the law,\u201d said Nielsen at the Fortune Most Powerful Women Summit. The moderator, PBS journalist Amna Nawaz, repeatedly questioned Nielsen on whether she regretted signing off on a memo that authorized the routine separation of migrant children from their families so that their parents could be detained.\n\nNielsen\u2019s appearance was wrapped in controversy. Activists had been pressuring Fortune to rescind its invitation to Trump\u2019s former homeland security secretary, who resigned in April. Three women who had been scheduled to speak at the summit \u2015 filmmaker dream hampton, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton and singer Brandi Carlile \u2015 withdrew from the event because of Nielsen\u2019s participation.\n\nClifton Leaf, Fortune\u2019s editor-in-chief, acknowledged the controversy Tuesday in remarks introducing the session, saying that while he understood the criticism, \u201cpart of Fortune\u2019s mission is to provide a platform for these discussions\u201d and he promised \u201ctough\u201d questions.\n\n\u201cThese issues are so important that we really need more voices. And we need to be additive and try to find a way to come together, and not work on taking people apart,\u201d Nielsen said, justifying why she deserved to be at the gathering.\n\nNawaz did repeatedly challenge Nielsen\u2019s claims, such as the former official\u2019s insistence that the Trump administration\u2019s policy was really just following the law and not a break from what previous administrations had done.\n\n\u201cUnder previous administrations, they also enforced this exact law,\u201d Nielsen claimed. \u201cWhat is different is the numbers of people have greatly increased over the last few years.\u201d\n\nNawaz noted that officials from previous administrations disagreed, saying the reason the country did not see thousands of children detained without their parents is that they always erred on the best interests of the child; they would separate only if there was a danger of immediate harm to the child.\n\nWhile family separation did occur in some instances under past presidents, the Trump administration launched a \u201czero tolerance\u201d crackdown at the border that led to thousands of children being split from their parents as a matter of policy.\n\nThe administration began to prosecute people for crossing the border even if they had children. Prior administrations had often declined to do, putting the families directly in immigration proceedings rather than sending parents to jail and taking their kids away. But the Trump administration chose to prosecute parents and split up families instead.\n\nWhile the law around crossing the border illegally isn\u2019t new, the family separations policy certainly was. And the administration telegraphed that it considered splitting up families as a possible deterrent to unauthorized immigration long before beginning the policy in earnest \u2015 Nielsen\u2019s predecessor, John Kelly, said in 2017 that he was considering family separation to discourage families from coming to the United States.\n\nMany members of the audience seemed sympathetic to Nielsen and the position she was put in.\n\nNielsen objected when Nawaz said she was still a part of the Trump administration, saying she was on an unpaid advisory board (the National Infrastructure Advisory Council) composed of business leaders who advise the administration.\n\n\u201cAre you telling every CEO in here that they should never advise the government on how to make something work?\u201d Nielsen said, receiving applause from the audience, composed primarily of women in business.\n\nAt least one woman in the audience audibly said that the treatment of Nielsen and the tough questioning was \u201crude.\u201d\n\nNielsen didn\u2019t face any outcries in the room, although activists were protesting outside the venue and Credo Action, a progressive group, placed pro-immigrant flyers in the restrooms, drove around a mobile billboard and blocked the escalators leading to the room where Nielsen was speaking.\n\n.@FortuneMagazine is still hosting Kirstjen Nielsen as a speaker at its Most Powerful Women Summit today.\n\n\n\nSo @CREDOMobile has a billboard truck calling them out.\n\n\n\n\"Powerful women don't put kids in cages.

Fortune and PBS should be ashamed of themselves for elevating toxic waste like Kirstjen Nielsen.\u201d\n\nNielsen was originally slated to talk about \u201csupply chain risk management\u201d \u2015 a far less controversial topic \u2015 in addition to the more high-profile aspects of her time as homeland security secretary. It was also billed as a \u201cconversation.\u201d But the session was later changed on Fortune\u2019s agenda to \u201chard questions,\u201d and references to the other topic were dropped. Fortune said the change was due to another panelist dropping out.\n\nNielsen seemed disappointed that she had to spend all her time on the child separation policy, jumping in at the end of the panel with, \u201cI wish we had gotten to cyber, because that\u2019s why I was originally here, for a cyber panel. So let me just quickly say, it\u2019s Cyber Awareness Month.\u201d\n\nElise Foley contributed reporting.", "description": "The Fortune Most Powerful Women Summit hosted a session with Nielsen, despite heavy pressure from activists to rescind the invitation.", "authors": ["Washington Bureau Chief"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5daf11c4210000ba1e34ab2b.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
