And we are ignoring Russia\u2019s efforts to leverage its increasingly dominant position in Syria to amass power and influence throughout the Middle East and beyond.\u201d\n\nMcConnell also pushed back on Trump\u2019s defense that \u201cthe endless wars must end,\u201d a line the president has adopted in recent days after criticism of the decision.\n\nI am the only person who can fight for the safety of our troops & bring them home from the ridiculous & costly Endless Wars, and be scorned. Democrats always liked that position, until I took it. Democrats always liked Walls, until I built them. Do you see what\u2019s happening here? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 17, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAs neo-isolationism rears its head on both the left and the right, we can expect to hear more talk of \u2018endless wars.\u2019 But rhetoric cannot change the fact that wars do not just end; wars are won or lost,\u201d McConnell argued, and concluded by calling for a re-commitment to \u201cour Afghan partners as they do the heavy lifting to defend their country and their freedoms from al-Qaeda and the Taliban.\u201d\n\nMcConnell has long been a critic of Trump\u2019s motivations to withdraw troops from Syria. \u201cWhile it is tempting to retreat to the comfort and security of our own shores, there is still a great deal of work to be done. We\u2019re not the world\u2019s policemen, but we are the leaders of the free world,\u201d he said in January after the initial news of Trump\u2019s planned pullback.\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) lambasted the Trump administration\u2019s decision to withdraw Troops from Syria on Friday, declaring that \u201cAmerica\u2019s wars will be \u2018endless\u2019 only if America refuses to win them.\u201dIn an op-ed published in the Washington Post, McConnell \u2014 who said on Thursday", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/CUJVMPxuEWUJaJGJ6_J6QQ--~B/aD01OTc7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/85e83d03f3737b8f72391454248a63c8", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
