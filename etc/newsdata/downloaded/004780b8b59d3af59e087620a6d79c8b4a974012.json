Of these, 19 had operations in jurisdictions included on the EU\u2019s \u201cblacklist\u201d or \u201cgreylist\u201d of countries that are considered to be non-compliant with EU international standards for \u201cgood tax behaviour\u201d, according to the report.\n\nThe Labour MP and former chair of the public accounts committee, Margaret Hodge, said it was \u201cperverse that the government continues to pay significant sums of taxpayer money to big corporations that practise tax avoidance on an alarming scale\u201d.\n\nThere are claims that aggressive use of tax havens can distort competition.\n\nThe Labour peer, Lord Haskel, added: \u201cFor too long large international tech companies have failed to pay their fair share of tax while being rewarded with government contracts, leaving British companies at a competitive disadvantage.\u201d\n\nThe Demos report states: \u201cLarge multinational companies, for example, continue to squeeze their tax contributions ever lower: the OECD estimates that US$100\u2013$240bn (\u00a378bn-\u00a3186bn) is lost globally in revenue each year from base erosion and profit shifting by multinational companies.\u201d\n\nPublic procurement is the best opportunity the government has to demonstrate what a good British business looks like Rose Lasko-Skinner, Demos\n\nProcurement is the UK government\u2019s largest expenditure, valued at \u00a3284bn. Of the 25 organisations with links to tax havens, 20 benefited from contracts worth a combined \u00a341bn awarded between 2011 and 2017.\n\n\u201cGovernment procurement could be an incredible force for good in the UK, beyond the public sector and in the economy more broadly,\u201d said Rose Lasko-Skinner, researcher at Demos and co-author of Value Added.\n\n\u201cPublic procurement is pretty much the best opportunity the government has to demonstrate what a good British business looks like, and this purchasing power should not be underestimated,\u201d added Lasko-Skinner.\n\nThe government has taken steps to improve the way it manages contracts with key suppliers.\n\nThe report states that earlier this year, in response to the collapse of public-sector contractor Carillion and to \u201cfundamentally flawed\u201d probation contracts being brought back in-house, the Cabinet Office published the Outsourcing Playbook. Its aim was to improve and strengthen the way government procures, and thereby reduce the risk of similar mishaps in the future.\n\nTax relief schemes \u2018losing billions\u2019 for Treasury claims Whitehall watchdog Read more\n\nDemos said that there was a need for new measures \u2013 including minimum standards for public procurement to include criteria relating to a bidder\u2019s exchequer contribution.\n\nThe thinktank has also called for the National Audit Office to conduct an annual report on central government procurement transparency.\n\nThis would include a \u201cleague table\u201d ranking of departments, with the bottom three departments compelled to make a statement to parliament.", "description": "Report from thinktank Demos finds that 24 out of 35 \u2018strategic suppliers\u2019 operate in offshore jurisdictions", "authors": ["Jamie Doward"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e11afc456762da019f08d15fd3473e7a47823d4b/0_103_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=98bc071aa0b176d188d8bc6426f54952", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
