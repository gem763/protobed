The ticketless hover nearby, asking if anyone knows when she is due to arrive.\n\nThe Testaments, 34 years in the making: the longest gaps between sequels Read more\n\nAlongside the handmaids are a surprise for those yet to read the book: two Pearl Girls dressed in floor-length, silvery gowns, who stay steadfastly in character all night. \u201cShe handed me an orange,\u201d says one girl in the queue, bewildered but impressed, cradling the fruit like a precious jewel (and not yet knowing she held a crucial plot detail).\n\nThe atmosphere inside the bookshop, just one of many around the world hosting a launch but the only attended by the author herself, would be familiar to any twentysomething who grew up on Harry Potter \u2013 but is perhaps unexpected for a sequel to a 34-year old literary novel about the patriarchy. Inside, young women \u2013 and the crowd is mostly women in their 20s and 30s, who probably grew up on Potter launches \u2013 and the occasional mother or boyfriend are drinking acid-green mocktails, tucking into cupcakes and taking down the patriarchy through craftivism. More than one person says they\u2019re dedicating their Tuesday to reading.\n\nKasey is there with her mother, Michaela, who gave her the book when she was 13. \u201cI\u2019ve been annoyed ever since then that it ended on such a cliffhanger,\u201d she says. \u201cA potential ending is so exciting.\u201d\n\nMichaela was given the book for Christmas in 1985, \u201cand no one could speak to me because I was so engrossed. So much of what she has predicted has come true, especially with the Christian right in the US. I think she\u2019s a prophet.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest People queue to get a copy of Margaret Atwood\u2019s The Testaments outside Waterstones Piccadilly in London.

Greta, a Lithuanian student, wrote her master\u2019s dissertation on Atwood and Shakespeare. The pair met in the queue, and are delicately embroidering \u201cNolite te bastardes carborundorum\u201d, the Latin phrase carved into Offred\u2019s closet by a previous handmaid in her household: \u201cDon\u2019t let the bastards grind you down.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really want to see Atwood in person,\u201d Greta says. \u201cHaving examined her work as a literary celebrity and knowing so much about a person you\u2019ve never seen in your life? It is going to be weird.\u201d\n\nDue to the prescience of her novels, and a well-timed and well-reviewed TV adaptation, Atwood has acquired new celebrity at the grand age of 79 \u2013 and not just among young people: authors including Jeanette Winterson, Neil Gaiman and Elif Shafak are attending the London launch.\n\nWinterson, who first read Atwood while at university, says the Canadian author has always kept an eye on who is \u201cmoving the edges in\u201d.\n\n\u201cParliament has been prorogued today,\u201d she tells the Guardian. \u201cWe\u2019ve got Trump in America, that narcissistic, egotistical, shitface in Downing Street. What is happening? And Atwood is there to instruct us, saying, \u2018You know this, inside out.\u2019 It really matters.\u201d\n\nThe Testaments by Margaret Atwood \u2013 first look review Read more\n\nGaiman says; \u201cThe terrifying thing is how well Atwood told us about it 30 years ago. When I read The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, I was a callow 25-year-old who thought we were too sensible for it to happen. Thirty years down the line, I know we\u2019re not all sensible.\n\n\u201cSome of us are idiots. Some of us are scared and can be lead by monsters. And the monsters are scared too. Suddenly you get the Pences, the Trumps, the Greasy Johnsons in power \u2026 if nothing else, that book is a canary in our communal cave mind.\u201d\n\nLiterature\u2019s most diminutive rockstar comes out an hour before midnight to whoops, not looking quite used to the level of celebrity that has finally come her way. She delivers a short reading, then smiles as the shop unites to count down, and dings a bell at midnight to cheers and a mad rush for books before selfies outside the shop.\n\nForget Potter, this is Beatles territory. One bookseller says it is not quite that crazy \u2013 just last week, people camped outside for a day to see Paul McCartney sign his new children\u2019s book. But, she says, it\u2019s still not far off.", "description": "With cocktails and craftivism, fans and authors including Neil Gaiman and Jeanette Winterson countdown release of sequel", "authors": ["Sian Cain"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3bb5285e9d127ff0641ec5be3047ff0ae81477e0/0_193_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9f907e0c0b76905de68f4af7030dbd9d", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
