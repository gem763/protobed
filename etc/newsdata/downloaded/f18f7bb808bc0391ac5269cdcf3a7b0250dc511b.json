I think it\u2019s a horrible thing.\u201d\n\n\u2014 President Trump, remarks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Sept. 25, 2019\n\n\u201cAsk how his son made millions of dollars from Ukraine, made millions of dollars from China, even though he had no expertise whatsoever.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Trump, in remarks to reporters with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Sept. 24\n\n\u201cThe son took money from China \u2014 a lot of money from China.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Trump, remarks to reporters at the United Nations, Sept. 23\n\nWe\u2019ve been writing a lot about Trump\u2019s false claims concerning Ukraine, Joe Biden and Biden\u2019s son, Hunter. Now let\u2019s turn our attention to Trump\u2019s repeated suggestions that Hunter struck it rich with a sketchy deal in China.\n\nWe had fact-checked this back in May, but as the Ukraine controversy has heated up, it\u2019s also become a regular staple of Trump\u2019s attacks on Biden. So here\u2019s an expanded look that takes into account new information and an updated Pinocchio rating.\n\nThe Facts\n\nFirst, we will stipulate that any child of a prominent politician needs to be wary of even the appearance of a conflict of interest between his or her business interests and their parent\u2019s political position. Hunter Biden, as detailed in a New Yorker profile published in July, has had a checkered life and yet has managed to score business deals in countries \u2014 in particular Ukraine and China \u2014 that might not have materialized without the prominence of his father.\n\nSimilarly, Ivanka Trump was granted Chinese trademarks days before and after President Trump vowed to save jobs at ZTE, a major Chinese telecom, in 2018. She also was granted Chinese trademarks in 2017, on the same day she sat next to Chinese President Xi Jinping at a dinner.\n\nTrump, of course, chose to focus on Biden\u2019s son, not his own daughter. He has claimed that Hunter Biden \u201cmade millions of dollars from China\u201d and \u201ctook money from China \u2014 a lot of money.\u201d He also said that Hunter Biden walked out of China with \u201c$1.5 billion in a fund \u2026 after one quick meeting and he flies in on Air Force Two.\u201d\n\nSo let\u2019s back up a bit. Hunter Biden launched a consulting firm in 2008. Then, in 2009, he co-founded another company, Rosemont Seneca Partners, with Christopher Heinz, stepson of then-Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.), and Devon Archer, a Yale classmate of Heinz\u2019s. At times, Hunter Biden and Archer did deals that did not include Heinz, who apparently was more wary of business arrangements that might attract public attention.\n\nArcher and Hunter Biden, for instance, connected with Jonathan Li, who ran a Chinese private-equity fund. In June 2013, according to the New Yorker, Li, Archer and other partners (including Chinese entities) signed a memorandum of understanding to create a fund called BHR Partners. Hunter Biden originally was on an advisory board for BHR and was not an equity owner in the fund while Joe Biden was vice president. He later acquired a 10 percent interest in the entity overseeing the fund.\n\nThe supposed size of the China fund \u2014 $1.5 billion \u2014 comes courtesy of \u201cSecret Empires,\u201d a 2018 book by conservative author Peter Schweizer, who earlier had targeted Hillary Clinton in the book \u201cClinton Cash.\u201d The Fact Checker spent a lot of time in the 2016 campaign chasing down dubious claims touted by Schweizer, such as about the Uranium One deal.\n\nAffiliates of the advisory firm had said they planned to raise $1.5 billion, but it appears the fundraising fell far short of that.\n\nIn December 2013, Hunter Biden and one of his daughters flew from Japan to China with Joe Biden on Air Force Two. (This is what Trump referred to when he said: \u201cHe\u2019s there for one quick meeting and he flies in on Air Force Two, I think that\u2019s a horrible thing.\u201d)\n\nThe vice president had diplomacy on his agenda. Hunter Biden was not spotted much, though Schweizer makes a big deal about Hunter following his father into a shop as the vice president buys an ice cream bar.\n\n\u201cThe vice president raised his Magnum ice cream bar to show the world\u2019s press how personable Joe Biden could be,\u201d Schweizer wrote. \u201cIntentionally or not, Hunter Biden was showing the Chinese that he had guanxi [connections].\u201d\n\nThe New Yorker detailed that Schweizer\u2019s claims about the China deal are disputed by the Biden camp.\n\nSchweizer asserts that \u201cRosemont Seneca Partners had been negotiating an exclusive deal with Chinese officials, which they signed approximately ten days after Hunter visited China with his father.\u201d In fact, the deal had been signed before the trip\u2014according to the BHR representative, it was a business license that came through shortly afterward\u2014and Hunter was not a signatory. Hunter and Archer said that they never met with any Chinese officials about the fund. And the deal wasn\u2019t with Rosemont Seneca Partners but with a new holding company, established solely by Archer; Christopher Heinz was not part of the BHR transaction. Schweizer also asserts that the Chinese fund was \u201clucrative\u201d for Hunter, but Hunter and his business partners told me that he has yet to receive a payment from the company.\n\nIn May, the Fact Checker also reported that Hunter Biden had not received any payments from the deal.\n\nStill, the New Yorker said that Hunter Biden\u2019s behavior at one point raised questions among the vice president\u2019s staff about whether he was leveraging access for his benefit.\n\nAccording to a Beijing-based BHR representative, Hunter, shortly after arriving in Beijing, on December 4th, helped arrange for Li to shake hands with his father in the lobby of the American delegation\u2019s hotel. Afterward, Hunter and Li had what both parties described as a social meeting. Hunter told me that he didn\u2019t understand why anyone would have been concerned about this. \u201cHow do I go to Beijing, halfway around the world, and not see them for a cup of coffee?\u201d he said.\n\nTwelve days after he flew to Beijing, Hunter Biden joined the board of BHR. George Mesires, a lawyer for Hunter Biden, said in a July interview with The Washington Post\u2019s Michael Kranish that his client\u2019s role has been misconstrued. He said Hunter Biden was on the board of the advisory firm that did not directly invest, but instead advised those who did.\n\n\u201cTo date, Mr. Biden has not received any return or compensation on account of this investment or his position on the board of directors,\u201d Mesires told The Fact Checker after Trump\u2019s remarks with Zelensky. \u201cThe characterization of Mr. Biden as owning a $1.5 billion private equity firm funded by the Chinese, or suggesting that Mr. Biden has earned millions of dollars from the firm is a gross misrepresentation of Mr. Biden\u2019s role with BHR.\u201d\n\nMesires said that the investment management company \u201cwas capitalized from various sources with a total of 30 million RMB [Chinese Renminbi], or about $4.2 million, not $1.5 billion.\u201d Because Biden acquired a 10 percent minority interest, his \u201ccapital commitment is approximately $420,000,\u201d Mesires said.\n\nThe Pinocchio Test\n\nThe president says Hunter Biden \u201cwalked out of China with $1.5 billion in a fund\u201d and earned \u201cmillions\u201d of dollars from the deal. There is no evidence to support those claims.\n\nOne could argue Hunter Biden has been trading off his father\u2019s name, and certainly arranging a handshake between a business partner and the vice president in China raises eyebrows. But Hunter Biden did not raise money for the fund; instead, he was on a board that advised potential investors. He did not obtain an equity stake until after his father was no longer vice president \u2014 and that investment of less than half a million dollars has not yet yielded a payoff for Hunter Biden, according to his attorney.\n\nTrump earns Four Pinocchios.\n\nFour Pinocchios\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter\n\nThe Fact Checker is a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network code of principles", "description": "With no evidence, the president accuses Joe Biden's son of earning millions and scoring $1.5 billion in investments from a single trip to China with the then-vice president.", "authors": ["Glenn Kessler", "The Fact Checker", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/LFPQq7ITwH9UJ84Xko14-dCXAj4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/36JGEOW72UI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
