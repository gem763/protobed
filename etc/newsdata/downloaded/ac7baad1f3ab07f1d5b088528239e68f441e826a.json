There was a baby lying in it,\" Mr Singh explained.\n\n\"The police took the baby to the city hospital where she is getting treatment.\"\n\nIndia's gender ratio is one of the worst in the world. Women are often discriminated against socially and girls are seen as a financial burden, particularly among poor communities.\n\nCampaigners say a traditional preference for sons has meant millions of female children lost to foeticide and infanticide over the years.\n\nAlthough most unwanted female foetuses are aborted with help from illegal sex determination clinics, cases of baby girls being killed after birth are not uncommon either.", "description": "Police say they are are looking for the parents of the newborn and trying to find out who buried her.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/E31E/production/_109224185_mediaitem109224184.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
