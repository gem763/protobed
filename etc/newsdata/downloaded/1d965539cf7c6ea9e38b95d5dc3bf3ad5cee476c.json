In an online statement Saturday, however, the club stated that \"a recent change to Taylor Swift's Asian promotional tour means she will no longer be able to perform at this year's Melbourne Cup.\"\n\nAfter Swift's performance was announced, animal rights group Coalition for the Protection of Racehorses called on Swift to cancel as part of their #NupToTheCup campaign, pointing to the deaths of numerous horses during the race.\n\nLast year, Irish racehorse The Cliffsofmoher was euthanized on the racetrack after fracturing its shoulder, becoming the sixth horse to die at the event since 2013. The death sparked outrage online, and the #NupToTheCup hashtag subsequently on Twitter.\n\nPlease Sign & Share@taylorswift13, please cancel your Melbourne Cup performance and instead use your voice to take a stand against animal abuse and say #NupToTheCup https://t.co/oKDtqiwkYt \u2014 Horse Racing Kills (@hrseracingkills) September 12, 2019\n\nOn Facebook, Coalition for the Protection of Racehorses urged Swift to withdraw from the event, citing her well-documented love for cats. \"Taylor Swift has put money before compassion by agreeing to perform at the 2019 Melbourne Cup. An event where at least 6 horses have been KILLED over the past 6 years,\" the group wrote.\n\nRead More", "description": "Animal rights activists campaigned against Swift's appearance at the horse racing event using the hashtag #NupToTheCup.", "authors": ["Emily Dixon"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190630150142-taylor-swift-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
