It is, by any fair measure, a White House attempt to clean up Donald Trump\u2019s mess: the Republican\u2019s decision to remove troops from northern Syria unleashed no small amount of hell in the region.\n\nWhether the American president appreciates this or not, the administration isn\u2019t speaking with one voice. NBC News\u2019 report on the talks touched on an underappreciated point.\n\n\u2026Pence\u2019s meeting with Erdogan comes hours after Trump dismissed Turkey\u2019s invasion and said the fight was over land that \u201chas nothing to do with us.\u201d \u201cIf Turkey goes into Syria, that\u2019s between Turkey and Syria,\u201d he said to reporters in the Oval Office. \u201cIt\u2019s not between Turkey and the United States.\u201d\n\nThe point Trump went to great lengths to drive home yesterday was that he does not care about the violence or its effects. Talking to reporters in the Oval Office, the American president dismissed our Kurdish allies, insisting they\u2019re \u201cno angels,\u201d and suggesting at least some Kurds are dangerous terrorists. Trump added, in apparent reference to Turkish and Kurdish forces, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of sand that they can play with.\u201d\n\nThe Republican added on Twitter this week, \u201cThe Kurds and Turkey have been fighting for many years\u2026. Others may want to come in and fight for one side or the other. Let them!\u201d\n\nSo much for the White House\u2019s commitment to a cease-fire.\n\nThe result is a contradiction for which there is no obvious resolution: the American vice president is in Ankara, eager to make clear that the United States cares, but his message is at odds with the American president\u2019s explicit indifference.\n\nSlate\u2019s Joshua Keating had a good piece on the latest developments yesterday:\n\nOn Monday, Trump announced that he was imposing sanctions on Turkish officials and agencies, raising tariffs on its steel, and canceling upcoming trade talks\u2026. According to Vice President Mike Pence, \u201cPresident Trump communicated to him very clearly that the United States of America wants Turkey to stop the invasion, implement an immediate cease-fire and to begin to negotiate with Kurdish forces in Syria to bring an end to the violence.\u201d Pence himself has been dispatched to Ankara along with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to meet with Erdogan to press him to negotiate a cease-fire. Erdogan could be forgiven for being a little confused. Why is he being threatened and sanctioned for doing something that Trump gave him permission to do? As Sen. Lindsey Graham, one of Trump\u2019s most reliable toadies in Congress as well as one of his most outspoken critics on Syria, put it, \u201cThe statements by President Trump about Turkey\u2019s invasion being of no concern to us also completely undercut Vice President Pence and Sec. Pompeo\u2019s ability to end the conflict.\u201d Yes, senator. They certainly do.\n\nTrump isn\u2019t just undercutting his own team; he\u2019s also undercutting his own position. Yesterday, a reporter asked the president whether he has any regrets for having given Erdogan the green light for a military offensive against the Kurds.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t give him a green light,\u201d Trump replied. \u201cWhen you make a statement like that, it\u2019s so deceptive. Just the opposite of a green light.\u201d\n\nThe evidence to the contrary is unambiguous.", "description": "Pence is in Turkey, insisting that the White House cares about events in northern Syria, the day after Trump explicitly said the opposite.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/videos/n_hallie_brk_pence_erdogan_191017_1920x1080.jpg?itok=DYOE9I4L", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
