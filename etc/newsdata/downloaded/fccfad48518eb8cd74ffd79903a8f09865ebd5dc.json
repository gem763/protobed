Today was not the first time I have noticed this. Maybe you should wear a top that covers the bulge in your stomach.\u201d\n\nINSTAGRAM MODEL SAYS BODY-SHAMING IS AN 'EVERYDAY' THING: 'IT CAN BE EXHAUSTING'\n\nUndeterred, Hinson publicly responded to the viewer, identifying her as Mary.\n\n\u201cDear Mary,\u201d Hinson began, \u201cYes I do watch my airchecks. NO I will not be strapping myself into a girdle because you don\u2019t like my belly. I like pasta, bread and cheese too much to obsess over my weight. I like my body and that\u2019s all that really matters.\u201d\n\nShe concluded her post with the hashtag \u201cNoMoreFatshaming.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nSince posting the response, Hinson's message has received more than 21,000 likes on the social media platform.\n\nHinson has also received a lot of support from Twitter.\n\nOne reply: \u201cDear Tracy, I don't know you, nor have I ever seen you on TV.
