In another ruling, the court said the right to free expression and information must be weighed carefully before deleting links related to certain categories of personal data.\n\nThe decisions more carefully define the scope of the right to be forgotten, which is a centerpiece of the European Union\u2019s internet privacy laws. The standard, which was established in 2014, can be used to force Google and other search engines to delete links to websites, news articles and databases that include personal information considered old, no longer relevant or not in the public interest.\n\nThe ruling to limit the geographical reach of the right to be forgotten is a victory for Google against a French effort to force the company and other search engines to take down links globally.", "description": "The European Court of Justice said the landmark privacy law cannot be enforced beyond the European Union.", "authors": ["Adam Satariano"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/24/business/24FORGOTTEN/24FORGOTTEN-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
