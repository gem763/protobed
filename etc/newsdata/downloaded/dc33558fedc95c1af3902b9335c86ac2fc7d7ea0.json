A facial with Yoon is an intense yet sublime experience. And to think, she almost became a diving coach. Before that, she wanted to be a platform diving Olympian.\n\nBorn in Korea, Yoon moved to the States when she was a year old. Growing up in New York, she started diving competitively at 9. When her parents informed her that they were moving back to Korea, part of their pitch included an athletic enticement. In Seoul, she could train more intensely.\n\n\u201cDiving isn\u2019t an after-school activity in Korea. It\u2019s an all-or-nothing sport,\u201d explains Yoon. \u201cDiving became my whole life. All my hopes and dreams were based on making the Olympic team.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, repeated injuries shattered her dreams. At 17 she gave up the sport. Life without diving was an adjustment, but it allowed her time to explore other outlets, so at the invitation of a friend, she signed up for an after-school beauty course. A longtime sufferer of eczema, Yoon found answers in the aesthetics department.\n\n\u201cOnce I started learning the science behind skin\u2019s structure and how it worked, I felt like I had stepped into The Matrix,\u201d she remembers. \u201cWe studied biology in high school, but not to this degree! And back then there was no Google. I suddenly had so much more control over my skin.\u201d\n\nHaving learned how to give facials, she started treating her friends, and continued through college and grad school (Columbia and Harvard, respectively.)\n\n\u201cI entered Harvard Business School during the financial crisis, so they had a really big focus on entrepreneurship,\u201d explains Yoon. \u201cMy grandfather had been a serial entrepreneur. His life always seemed so adventurous and exciting, so I thought, \u2018Okay. I\u2019ll be an entrepreneur.\u2019\u201d\n\nHer first gig was importing Korean fashion, but her heart wasn\u2019t in skin care. She decided to turn her hobby into a business and import Korean beauty instead.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe that, in such a globalized world, you couldn\u2019t find any Korean beauty in the U.S. beyond what was sold in K Town,\u201d she says. \u201cWith such advanced technologies and formulas, I had to bring it here.\u201d\n\nShe launched Peach and Lily in 2012, then launched her own line in 2016, starting with sheet masks. A more complete collection followed last year, but Yoon is constantly presenting formulaic challenges for her labs to meet.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a privilege to be taken seriously by these brilliant chemists,\u201d says Yoon. \u201cIt\u2019s my own Willy Wonka dream come true.\u201d\n\nYoon spoke with the Cut about the best kind of serum, the worst kind of meetings, and more.\n\nWhat\u2019s your definition of beauty?\n\nLove \u2014 in all forms. Self-love, loving others, loving animals, loving your career. Any expression of love is true beauty.\n\nWhat do you think when you hear the term \u201cclean beauty\u201d?\n\nIt\u2019s an unregulated term. Sometimes \u201cclean beauty\u201d products aren\u2019t that clean, so my first reaction is to immediately flip over the box and pore over the ingredients.\n\nWhere, if anywhere, in your beauty (or life) routine are you not quite that \u201cclean,\u201d \u201cgreen,\u201d or \u201csustainable\u201d? Are there old-school products or elements that you just can\u2019t quit?\n\nI have a sweet tooth, it\u2019s so hard to quit chocolate baked goods. Also, I have fine, easily tangled hair, so sometimes a not-clean conditioner is the only thing that does the trick.\n\nPlease fill in the blank as it pertains to something connected to your beauty, self, routine, product or otherwise: I think about _______ a lot. Keeping inflammation away.\n\nWhat is the opposite of \u201cbeautiful\u201d?\n\nSelfishness and the inability to consider others, which is a very different thing than self-care and self-love.\n\nWhat is your own personal definition of glee?\n\nGood food, good wine with loved ones curled up together on comfy couches while sheet-masking and catching up. I\u2019m literally smiling right now as I think about this.\n\nBath or shower?\n\nOne-hundred percent bath, with Susanne Kaufmann St. John\u2019s Wart Bath \u2014 it\u2019s really hydrating and soothing, which is great for my eczema.\n\nBody lotion of choice:\n\nIlli Total Anti-aging Body Lotion\n\nFacial cleanser of choice:\n\nI double cleanse, always. The Shangpree S-Energy Cleansing Gel followed by the Shangpree S-Energy Facial Mousse Cleanser. This two step process keeps my skin clean down to the pores, but never stripped dry.\n\nScent of choice:\n\nDolce & Gabbana The One.\n\nToothpaste and toothbrush of choice:\n\nTom\u2019s of Maine. Charcoal toothbrushes from Korean drugstores.\n\nFavorite CDB product:\n\nThe Not Pot butter by Pearl Butter.\n\nWhat, if anything, is usually on your lips?\n\nThe Peach & Lily Kbeauty Rescue Balm. Lips stay super soft and plumped up with hydration. It\u2019s a balm for everywhere and anywhere, so sometimes it\u2019s on my lips, neck, and cheeks where it gets especially dry.\n\nWhat shade, if any, is usually on your toes and/or hands?\n\nToes: Chanel Holiday or Rouge Noir. Nails: Essie Ballet Slippers, Dior Incognito or a stark white.\n\nWhat beauty look do you struggle with achieving?\n\nA heavily smoky eye. Somehow, this look always makes my eyes look a little puffy!\n\nWhat beauty look do you just not get?\n\nHalo brows.\n\nWhat do you splurge on?\n\nGreat massages.\n\nFavorite location to travel to:\n\nThe lush and serene countrysides outside of Seoul.\n\nDaily carry-all:\n\nCeline Bucket Bag.\n\nWork shoe of choice: See by Chloe Espadrilles.\n\nCasual shoe of choice:\n\nVery white, comfortable leather slip-on sneakers I get from a boutique in Korea.\n\nWhat fashion look do you struggle with achieving?\n\nI\u2019m petite so anything too oversized, I drown in.\n\nCurrent favorite fashion designer:\n\nRoland Mouret, Protagonist, Steve J & Yoni P.\n\nFavorite piece of furniture in your home:\n\nA gray-blue armchair I have from Pier 1 Imports because it\u2019s super comfortable, but it was also one of the first pieces of furniture I got for myself and it\u2019s been to every apartment with me, so it just holds a lot of sentimental value for me.\n\nTop item currently at the top of your fashion wish list:\n\nThis oversized Balenciaga bag that looks like it would hold everything. I saw someone carrying it the other day, but I can\u2019t find any retailer that has this specific bag.\n\nWhat is your daily uniform?\n\nI don\u2019t really have one. I tend to either be pretty monochromatic and tailored, or I\u2019ll do louder colors and textures, depending on what\u2019s going on that day and how I\u2019m feeling.\n\nFavorite day-off activity:\n\nReading.\n\nLast great book you read?\n\nRadical Candor.\n\nBest-selling book that you just couldn\u2019t get into?\n\nThe Lying Game.\n\nWhat was the most recent interesting conversation you had? Topic? And with whom?\n\nOne of my girl friends is developing a RNA platform technology for immuno-oncology and gene therapy applications, among many other health problems. The research is fascinating. I was truly captivated, though, by her tenacity to make incredible headway and win prestigious awards in a male-dominated industry. Love listening to stories of women just crushing it.\n\nWhat tests your patience?\n\nUnnecessary meetings with no agenda.\n\nJetlag cure:\n\nBlue light therapy.\n\nFavorite smell:\n\nMountain air.\n\nLeast favorite smell:\n\nHeavy perfumes.\n\nWhat do you think Pantone\u2019s color of 2019 should be?\n\nI think it should be a beautiful, light, airy yellow because these are times where we can especially use some cheerful, happy vibes.\n\nMost used item in your kitchen:\n\nOur pressure cooker that my husband, who\u2019s a phenomenal cook, uses.\n\nNickname you had as a child:\n\nSmiley.\n\nWhat do you wish you had invented?\n\nVaccines.\n\nWhat would you still like to invent?\n\nCures for all cancers.\n\nDescribe your most starstruck moment:\n\nBeing a fellow panelist at the Be Summit Conference, organized by Nastia Luikin, alongside world champions and Olympians like Jordyn Wieber, Shannon Miller, Nancy Kerrigan, and Laurie Hernandez definitely had me starstruck.\n\nName a trait or talent you possess that few know about you:\n\nI am an extremely slow eater.\n\nWhat are you working on mastering?\n\nStand-up paddle boarding.\n\nWhat is your Achilles heel?\n\nBooks. Once I get going, it\u2019s hard to put them down.\n\nComfort food:\n\nMashed potatoes.\n\nWhat food would you never eat?\n\nRecently, dairy. And ever since I began avoiding it, I feel more energized.\n\nWhat product in your company\u2019s domain is misunderstood and should be a best seller?\n\nMiwaji Hyalu Serum Veil. It\u2019s this incredible blend of hyaluronic acid of different molecular sizes. One layer works as a serum and a few layers work as a thin mask where the hyaluronic acid forms a veil-like effect on skin. You apply a few layers before bed, and when you wake up, skin is seriously super plumped up with hydration and completely calmed down. A celebrity dermatologist in Korea created this. It\u2019s a super buzzy brand among beauty insiders in Korea and has saved my skin many times.\n\nYes, this is cruel, but what is your favorite product in your domain? (understanding that the answer can change)?\n\nPeach & Lily Glass Skin Refining Serum. It just creates healthier skin for me, and keeps me free of fine lines, wrinkles, dark spots, pores, everything. It just works.\n\nWhat do you foresee as the top beauty trends in 2019?\n\nClean beauty products that can yield big results.\n\nIf you won the Power Ball tomorrow, what are the first five things you would do? (after, of course, donating the majority of it to your top charities\u2026)\n\nTake my parents on a really lavish month-long vacation, build out a handful of key spa locations for Peach & Lily, get weekly deep-tissue massages at the Baccarat Hotel there\u2019s this one massage therapist there who is a magician!), get a private jet, buy a sprawling loft space in Nolita, then build the lushest greenhouse on top of it.\n\nIf you buy something through our links, New York may earn an affiliate commission.", "description": "For the Cut\u2019s Column The Beauty of it all, Jane Larkworthy interviews Alicia Yoon, founder of K-Beauty retailer Peach and Lily.
