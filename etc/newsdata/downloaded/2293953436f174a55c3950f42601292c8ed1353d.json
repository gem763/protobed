Add Interest\n\nDear Young Gio (circa 1997),\n\nI know you\u2019re starting to figure things out.\n\nYou\u2019re only 12, but your mind is already asking questions no 12-year-old could possibly answer.\n\nQuestions that will take years to explore, embrace and understand.\n\nQuestions that may flip your whole world upside-down.\n\nYour community sometimes uses tough language.\n\nA beautiful Spanish accent doesn\u2019t mask ugly words.\n\nWhen you hear these words, you laugh, you deflect, you distract.\n\nYou don\u2019t know any better.\n\nYou\u2019re scared, and just doing the best you can.\n\nThe kids at school use the word \u201cgay\u201d as if it\u2019s synonymous with \u201ceww.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re pointing their fingers directly at you.\n\nThey make fun of everything: your hair, your teeth, your skinny frame. But that word, \u201cgay,\u201d sticks the longest. It hurts.\n\nAfter school, you escape it all with TV shows, books, and your own imagination.\n\nMom asks, \u201chow was school?\u201d\n\nYou always say it was great.\n\nYou\u2019ll spend years trying to be more \u201cmanly.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ll work out for hours each day, you\u2019ll style your hair differently, you\u2019ll get braces to fix those teeth, and you\u2019ll date brilliant, beautiful girls.\n\nHiding the truth won\u2019t stop you professionally either: a once-in-a-lifetime scholarship at a TV station in Miami helps you become a TV producer and then a local news reporter.\n\nBut the truth about who you are is still itching to get out.\n\nI want to tell you: it will all be OK.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019ll be more than OK. When you finally tell your mom your secret (at 24 years old) she will embrace you.\n\nIt takes her just 24 hours to understand what took you 24 years.\n\nThough one friend warns, \u201cyou can\u2019t be gay and successful in the media,\u201d your colleagues will celebrate you.\n\nWhat\u2019s the big deal?, they\u2019ll wonder, and send you on your next assignment.\n\nAnd when ABC News calls to hire you, your colleagues there will celebrate you, too.\n\nIn fact, when you get engaged and ultimately marry your husband, your colleagues will show your photos and congratulate you on America\u2019s No. 1 morning show, \"Good Morning America.\"\n\nYou and your husband will be a trending topic on social media all around the world.\n\nKids struggling to understand themselves will write to you.\n\nTheir parents, transformed by the loving photos you share, will thank you.\n\nDon\u2019t rush it, kid.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to reveal your secret just yet, if you don\u2019t want to.\n\nYou\u2019re only 12.\n\nJust know that you\u2019re special, and someday you\u2019ll feel that too, and everything will be OK.\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready, start living your truth.\n\nThat\u2019s when the magic happens.\n\nWith lots of love and tremendous pride,\n\n-Gio (circa 2019)\n\nGio Benitez is an ABC News correspondent based in New York.
