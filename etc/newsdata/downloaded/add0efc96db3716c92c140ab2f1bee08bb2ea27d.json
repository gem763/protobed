That\u2019s not only because of what he\u2019s done. To answer whether he\u2019s committed acts sufficient to warrant impeachment is obvious.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no joke. He\u2019s shooting holes in the Constitution, and we can not let him get away with it,\u201d Biden concluded.\n\nHowever, President Trump defended himself against the Democrats\u2019 calls for impeachment on Wednesday by tweeting that he did nothing wrong:\n\nOnly 25 percent want the President Impeached, which is pretty low considering the volume of Fake News coverage, but pretty high considering the fact that I did NOTHING wrong. It is all just a continuation of the greatest Scam and Witch Hunt in the history of our Country! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 9, 2019\n\nOn Thursday, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) echoed the president\u2019s statements by saying that Democrats were using impeachment as a political campaign:\n\nThis isn\u2019t impeachment. This is a political campaign. Democrats know they won\u2019t win a REAL campaign, so they are:\n\n-Abusing House procedures\n\n-Selectively leaking information\n\n-Hiding the truth from the American people They\u2019re just making the rules up as they go along. \u2014 Rep. Jim Jordan (@Jim_Jordan) October 10, 2019\n\nOn Wednesday, Jordan wrote on Twitter that Democrats were \u201cso busy \u2018striking while the iron is hot\u2019 that they didn\u2019t even have a vote to start their crazy impeachment proceedings!\u201d\n\n\u201cOr maybe they didn\u2019t want to go on record for the American people. President Trump is right to call them out for this biased & unfair process,\u201d he concluded.", "description": "The radical Democrat politicians are corrupt and their candidates are terrible, President Trump said during a rally in Louisiana on Friday.", "authors": ["Amy Furr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/pres-donald-trump-louisiana-rally-oct11-2019-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
