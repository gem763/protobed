On Sunday, Fleabag star Phoebe Waller-Bridge took home Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy, her second award of the night and, based on her reaction, a huge surprise she did not mentally prepare for. \u201cOh my god, no,\u201d she gushed, cradling her statuette. Thank you. I find acting really hard and really painful, but it\u2019s all about this.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you to be nominated with these unbelievable actresses who I have just looked up to and watched, and laughed at and with, for so many years,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt means so much. This means a huge, huge amount to me.\u201d So if your money was on the Veep star, that\u2019s understandable. You couldn\u2019t have known eleven time-winner Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who took home the award in 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012, 2006 and 1996, wouldn\u2019t win the award again this year. And hey, if it makes you feel any better, she will undoubtedly be back up there soon/twenty more times.", "description": "Phoebe Waller-Bridge wins Outsanding Lead Actress in a comedy, unseating reigning comedy queen Julia Louis Dreyfus, at the 2019 Emmys", "authors": ["Halle Kiefer"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/22/22-pheobe-waller-bridge.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
