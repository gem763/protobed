The office projected that around 5,000 of the victims were still alive as of last year.Tokyo maintains that a 1965 treaty that normalized bilateral relations with Seoul settled all compensation matters.Since the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions last year, Japan levied trade restrictions on Korea in August and removed Korea from a list of favored trading partners the same month - seen in Korea as retaliatory measures for the court\u2019s rulings.As bilateral relations froze over, Abe has mentioned Korea less and less in his speeches to the parliament.It was customary for Abe to mention Korea in addresses to the parliament upon the commencements of sessions.But Abe omitted Korea altogether in a parliamentary address on Jan. 28, except when he mentioned that Japan will cooperate with the United States and South Korea to work on issues related to North Korea.Some analysts say that Abe\u2019s use of the term \u201can important neighboring country\u201d to describe Korea may not necessarily be an olive branch.Abe, who has been in office since 2012, frequently described Korea as an important neighboring country in his addresses. He stopped using the term in 2017 but reused it again for the first time in two years in a speech last January.A source in Japan familiar with matters told the JoongAng Ilbo, \u201cThe terminology was included not out of consideration of Korea but in order to emphasize that Korea should uphold previous agreements.\u201dIn Abe\u2019s Friday address, there were other changes that some analysts said were signals of Japan\u2019s discontentment with Korea, especially following South Korea\u2019s announcement in August of its plan to terminate a bilateral intelligence-sharing pact, the General Security of Military Information Agreement.Abe omitted South Korea in his mention of international cooperation on North Korean issues, stating that Japan will cooperate \u201cclosely with the United States and the international community.\u201dWhen Abe described the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, he left out Korea, a member of the partnership, while mentioning Asean, China, India and Australia.\u201cWe will bring about free and open Indo-Pacific cooperation, with the Japan-U.S. alliance as the foundation of the cooperation while working with the U.K., France, Australia, India and other nations that share the same value systems.\u201dAbe also appeared comparatively cordial toward China in his address.BY SEO SEUNG-WOOK.
