The 1999 Columbine shooting, in which two gunmen killed 13 and wounded 21 in Littleton, Colorado, has \u201cinfatuated\u201d some young people and prompted copycat shootings across the country.\n\n\u201cWhile checking Michelle\u2019s bedroom, her parents found what appeared to be a significant amount of pipe bombs, other bomb-making materials and numerous weapons,\u201d Chronister said. Her parents, who were in the military, called authorities Thursday, he said.\n\nWhen police arrived, they evacuated the home, in Wimauma, Florida, about 30 miles south of Tampa, and called the bomb squad.\n\nPolice discovered 24 pipe bombs, smokeless pistol powder, fuse material, 23 different knives, two hatchets, two BB-pellet-type rifles, six BB-pellet-type handguns and dozens of books and DVDs about murder, mass killing, domestic terrorism and bomb making, Chronister said.\n\n\u201cThe amount of highly destructive materials we found in this home were astonishing,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cIf used, these bombs could have caused catastrophic damage and harm to hundreds, even thousands of people.\u201d\n\nPolice found Kolts at her job, he said. Arrest records listed her occupation as laborer, but no additional details were available. Kolts admitted to detectives that she made the devices and had planned to use them, though it was unclear how, the sheriff said.\n\nKolts was being held with bail set at $180,000. Records showed no lawyer listed for her and attempts to reach her parents Saturday were unsuccessful.\n\n\u201cWho knows the amount of harm that could have been done, or how many lives could have been lost, had these parents not found the courage to call the sheriff\u2019s office and seek help,\u201d Chronister said.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n\n\u00a9 2019 The New York Times Company", "description": "A Florida woman obsessed with the Columbine High School massacre and the Oklahoma City bombing was arrested after her parents discovered two dozen pipe bombs in her bedroom, authorities said Friday.The woman, Michelle Kolts, 27, was charged with 24 counts of making a destructive device with intent to", "authors": ["Derrick Bryson Taylor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6zxN_xZ_ENz_hK40Fl4.wA--~B/aD0xNTAwO3c9MTIwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/5c436429cdaa3bae152dfda060f3aa56", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
