The most important day of my life and one of Mum's moods appeared to be upon us, the ones I'd lived in terror of when I was young.\u201d\n\nClaiming that she gave it her best shot to ruin the whole day, Sir Elton described her increasingly offensive behaviour, which escalated during the civil partnership ceremony.\n\nHe revealed: \u201cWhen David and I exchanged our vows, she started talking, very loudly, over the top of us: rattling on about how she didn't like the venue and couldn't imagine getting married in a place like this.\n\n(Image: FilmMagic)\n\n\u201cWhen the time came for the witnesses to sign the licence, she signed her name, snapped: 'It's done, then,' slammed the pen down and stormed off.\u201d\n\nHer behaviour allegedly went further downhill during the party afterwards, where she \u201ctutted, groaned and rolled her eyes\u201d.\n\nIt was later revealed to Elton that his mother had worked hard to stop the marriage going ahead in the first place, allegedly saying two men should not be marrying.\n\nConfirming that it was not down to being homophobic, Sir Elton revealed it was in fact down to her jealousy that her son had finally found happiness and would be cutting the umbilical cord at last.\n\nElton and David converted their civil partnership into a formal marriage in 2014.\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
