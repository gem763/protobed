Who came up with this idea? Did they not have to run it past like, several other people first? And if so, how did not one of them say 'No, this is a terrible idea'. The mind boggles.'\n\nOthers hit out at being forced to watch a patronising film, saying the issues it covers should be common sense.\n\nOne wrote on Facebook: 'I'm sorry but if you don't know about the rights and wrongs of consent and if you're harassing someone, then watching a play isn't going to make any difference.\n\n'And being told it's mandatory feels ''nanny state'' to me.'\n\nA Twitter user added: 'A play about consent that is mandatory.'\n\nThe university apologised for its email after a backlash from students - but its website still states that attendance is compulsory\n\nA university spokesman told Mail Online: 'Like many, many universities in the UK we are organising compulsory consent training this year.\n\n'Last night 1,500 students attended the two sessions and further sessions will be held throughout the week.\n\n'Following concerns raised by students we sent out a joint statement from the University and Students' Union by email to all staff and students.\n\n'We took the decision to make the training compulsory because both the University and Students' Union think it is vital that all of our students engage with these issues and think through how they can all be part of the solution.\n\n'We would never want survivors of harassment or sexual violence to feel they must attend this training. We recognise our initial emails could have been clearer on this issue and we're sorry if anyone was placed in a difficult situation. Any student can contact our Student Wellbeing and Inclusivity team confidentially if they have any concerns about attending the training.\n\n'We are a supportive and inclusive community which encourages people to respect each other. We will not tolerate harassment and hate crime of any kind on our campuses so we're working together, across the University and Students' Union, to take clear and direct action against these issues.\n\n'Anyone who cannot attend the sessions this week can also contact the Student Wellbeing and Inclusivity team to arrange an alternative time to complete the training.\n\n'This training is part of a much wider programme of actions by the University including a new Code of Student Conduct, a year-long programme of bystander training, additional patrols at night, increased CCTV coverage across all campuses and additional resources for our conduct team to ensure issues are dealt with in a timely manner.\n\n'We hope everyone will support our efforts to create the right environment for our students and staff.\n\n'We know our students can be deeply affected by these issues and would urge anyone who needs support and advice to contact our Student Wellbeing and Inclusivity team.'\n\nEssex University has come under fire previously for taking too long to investigate allegations of sexual assaults on students.\n\nBryn Morris, the university's registrar, said investigations should be concluded within 60 days but it emerged this was not the case in 20 per cent of cases last year.", "description": "Undergraduates at Essex University received e-mails that said attending screenings of the sexual assault and consent play Can't Touch This were mandatory.", "authors": ["Danyal Hussain For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/10/19532066-0-image-a-34_1570700241400.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
