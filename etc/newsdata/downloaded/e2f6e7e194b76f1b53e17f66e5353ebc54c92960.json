The river, located near the small town of Denmark, 360km south-east of Western Australia\u2019s capital, Perth, was given its name by the local Noongar people, who believe it was formed by the Wagyl, a giant serpent from the creation period known as the Dreaming.\n\nMost people journey to this wild coastal stretch of Western Australia\u2019s Great Southern region to visit vineyards, sample delicious produce and holiday by its strip of stunning beaches, but I was there to have my spirit rebalanced by the local medicine man, Joey Williams.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n\u2022 A diet that makes you happy and calm\n\n\u2022 The city that discovered the key to happiness\n\n\u2022 A language only three women can speak\n\nAustralia\u2019s indigenous Aboriginal people have the oldest living culture on Earth. For around 60,000 years, their intricate understanding of ecology ensured survival, and their physical, spiritual, mental and emotional well-being was achieved by maintaining healthy, balanced relationships with all living and non-living things.\n\nAt the heart of their communities were traditional healers. They have been respected and entrusted with the well-being of Aboriginal communities for as long as the culture has been alive, yet still today surprisingly little is known of them. The few healers who remain, of which Williams is one, have extensive knowledge of Aboriginal culture and are believed to possess supernatural abilities. Their role is to treat physical, mental and spiritual ailments using bush medicine, smoking ceremonies and spirit realignment \u2013 the latter being a common remedy for depression, or what indigenous Australians call \u201csickness of the spirit\u201d.\n\nIn 2017, the World Health Organization published a study stating the total number of people living with depression in 2015 was estimated to exceed 300 million \u2013 an increase of more than 18.4% since 2005.\n\nMore recently, the Australian Medical Association announced their agreement with other leading global health organisations, declaring climate change a \u201chealth emergency\u201d that will cause a higher incidence of mental ill-health, among other health-related issues. With modern living an apparent threat to both mental well-being and the planet \u00ad\u2013 and having personally battled with depression myself \u2013 I had wondered whether answers could be found by looking back to the wisdom of the world\u2019s oldest continuous civilisation.\n\nAn Aboriginal elder and mubarrn, meaning \u201cmedicine\u201d or \u201clore\u201d man in the local Noongar language, Williams told me his healing ability has been passed down through his ancestral lineage. For him, and other Aboriginal healers, the most important first step in relation to healing is the ability to reconnect to the land, since for indigenous Australians, connection to country represents connection to their culture. For this reason, we\u2019d started the healing ceremony the previous day in the Stirling Range National Park, a 90-minute drive north of Kwoorabup, to experience a reconnection ceremony at an ancient sacred site on the traditional lands of the Koreng tribe to which he belongs.\n\nWestern Australia\u2019s only southern mountain range is an area of extraordinary beauty. It\u2019s one of the few places in the state that gets snow, and spring sees it dotted with an array of brightly coloured wildflowers. Home to 1,500 species, many growing nowhere else, it\u2019s one of the world\u2019s most important areas for flora.\n\nMany of these native plants have medicinal properties, and because Williams spent his early childhood living off the land with family, it\u2019s no wonder that he, now in his late 50s, refers to the area as his \u201csupermarket\u201d and \u201cpharmacy\u201d.\n\nWading through knee-high grass, Williams showed me how to dig for bloodroot (good for numbing toothache) and gather resin formed from the oozing red antiseptic sap of a marri tree, which strangely resembled the very thing it is known for healing \u2013 an open wound. \u201cIt cures stomach ache too,\u201d he said.\n\nAs we walked, Williams demonstrated that to him and other indigenous Australians, the land is very much alive, with songlines (cultural memory codes that hold knowledge of a place and define the responsibilities attached to kinship and lore) scattered across its skin. After singing the specific songline attached to the spot we were standing, Williams \u201cread\u201d the land to me, pointing out peaks like chapters. \u201cThere\u2019s Bulla Meile, the hill of eyes,\u201d he said. More commonly known as Bluff Knoll, southern Western Australia\u2018s highest peak is where the Koreng people believe they return after death. \u201cAnd straight out in front of us is Talyuberlup. See her face, breast and stomach?\u201d he asked, tracing curves in the air. \u201cMeaning beautiful woman sleeping. She\u2019s the protector of this range.\u201d\n\nFollowing his gaze, the undulating countryside did indeed look like an expecting mother resting, and served as a reminder that Aboriginal people see the land as a \u201cmother\u201d and a guide for reciprocal wellness.\n\nBack in the car, we continued on to Wickelenup, a semi-dry salt lake that is a \u201cpower ground\u201d, a place where the Koreng people have performed ceremonial reconnection rites for thousands of years. Wickelenup means \u201clake of many colours\u201d and it\u2019s named for the ochre pits resting beside it. These large deposits of clay earth produce pigments ranging from pale yellows to deep reds, which, when painted on the body during a ceremony, represent the important connection that indigenous Australians have with the land.\n\nI only have to listen to you for half an hour and I know you\n\nEntering Wickelenup, Williams used clapsticks and what he called a \u201cprotection song\u201d to summon his ancestors for the protection and blessing of our steps upon the Earth. After crossing a bed of clay that looked as if giant tins of red and yellow paint had been dropped from the sky, he led me to an oddly shaped chunk of volcanic rock that he used as a platform for grinding ochre. Williams stood with his eyes closed and sang the songline belonging to his family, the Kaarl Poorlanger, meaning \u201cpeople of fire\u201d, before mixing ochre on the stone and painting a russet-coloured pigment onto my skin in a technique known as \u201csmudging\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is your mark, your connection to this land. You might wash it off later but I know it\u2019s there\u2026 and so will you,\u201d he said.\n\nLooking at the symbol on my arm, I asked why he had chosen what looked like ripples in water. \u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cYou chose it in your mind.\u201d Sensing my confusion, Williams elaborated. \u201cI only have to listen to you for half an hour and I know you.\u201d\n\nWhether healers truly possess any psychic ability, it seems a key skill Aboriginal people have honed over thousands of years is an advanced way of listening.\n\nElder Miriam-Rose Ungunmerr-Baumann, an Aboriginal activist, educator and artist from Australia\u2019s Northern Territory, believes \u201cdadirri is the Aboriginal gift\u201d the world is thirsting for.\n\nMeaning \u201cinner deep listening and quiet still awareness\u201d in her Ngangikurungkurr language, dadirri is a form of mindfulness and reciprocal empathy we can develop with the land, each other and ourselves, according to Ungunmerr-Baumann. \u201cWe call on it and it calls to us\u2026 It is something like what you call \u2018contemplation\u2019,\u201d she writes on her website.\n\nFor indigenous Australians, this spiritual listening practice provides a way to observe and act according to the natural seasons and cycles in a way the modern world seems to have forgotten. \u201cWe watch the bush foods and wait for them to ripen before we gather them. When a relation dies, we wait a long time with the sorrow. We own our grief and allow it to heal slowly,\u201d she told me.\n\nWhile much ancient Aboriginal wisdom and culture has already been lost, elders such as Ungunmerr-Baumann are striving to keep what\u2019s left alive, but it\u2019s not an easy task. When the First Fleet of British settlers arrived in Australia in 1788, Australia\u2019s indigenous population was thought to be around 750,000. Ten years later, it was estimated to have dropped by 90%, due to the introduction of new diseases and violent clashes with the European colonisers. Today, indigenous Australians make up just 3.3% of the population. The forced separation of families and removal of Aboriginal people from their traditional lands, lore and practices affected the passing of cultural knowledge and led to the intergenerational trauma that is still being experienced today.\n\nBut one woman advocating for greater recognition of traditional Aboriginal healing principles, practices and medicine is Dr Francesca Panzironi, a human rights academic from Rome. The CEO of Australia\u2019s first organisation of Aboriginal traditional healers, Panzironi formed Anangu Ngangkari Tjutaku Aboriginal Corporation (ANTAC), with Ngangkari (healers of Australia\u2019s central desert areas) in 2012.\n\n\u201cFor indigenous people, it\u2019s about reconnecting to culture and accessing healing techniques that are different from Western medicine,\u201d Panzironi said. \u201cWestern medicine looks at the body from a mechanistic perspective, whereas healers highlight everyone has a spirit that intimately links to the body and emotions.\u201d\n\nAlthough traditional Aboriginal medicine is not recognised as an alternative medicine in Australia (due to difficulty regulating spiritual practices and the lack of testing of bush medicines), Ngangkaris are recognised in South Australian legislation through the Mental Health Act of 2009, and ANTAC now has healers working alongside Western doctors and mental health experts in some public hospitals. They provide \u201ccomplementary\u201d treatments to medical care for indigenous Australians \u2013 something especially beneficial for people recovering from intergenerational trauma, stemming from colonisation.\n\nPanzironi says there has been increased interest from non-indigenous people, too, who are dissatisfied with the mainstream model and are looking for alternatives. \u201cWe had a middle-aged woman who reduced her intake of antidepressants significantly over a six-month period of regular pampuni (a massage technique used for spirit realignment by the Ngangkari, particularly in the stomach, which is thought to be connected to the mind), in consultation with her GP. Both the woman and her doctor noticed improvement in her mental health,\u201d she said.\n\nCurrently ANTAC has a mobile clinic allowing Ngangkaris to travel to patients in areas of Australia where access to their services are non-existent, but Panzironi would like to see hospital programmes similar to the one in South Australia rolled out nationwide. \u201cThe goal is to have Aboriginal traditional medicine recognised as an alternative medicine and to make healers commonplace, as a viable choice for everyone through Medicare [Australia\u2019s universal health care system],\u201d she told me.\n\nBack at Kwoorabup, Williams was preparing for the final stage of my spirit realignment ceremony. After using smoke to cleanse and protect our surroundings from bad spirits, as is the traditional ceremonial practice among Aboriginal people, he placed a small stone upon my navel \u2013 a tool, he said, to absorb my vibration or spirit.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all made up of vibration,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIt\u2019s connected at birth through the umbilical cord. It\u2019s the essence of who we are.\u201d Through his water vibrational healing ceremony, something that is unique to mubarrn of the area, he explained that I\u2019d be able hear my spirit amplified when he placed the stone in the river. \u201cHigh vibration means anxiety,\u201d Williams said. \u201cLow vibration is depression. I\u2019ll take your vibration and balance it by releasing it through a portal I\u2019ll open in your back.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re all made up of vibration \u2013 it\u2019s the essence of who we are\n\nI had known the water would be cold, but that still hadn\u2019t prepared me for the shock I felt when it came time to immerse myself in the river. Floating on my back, with Williams holding me, I tried to relax and listen to my \u201cvibration\u201d with the stone now held against my spine, but my shuddering body wouldn\u2019t cooperate.\n\nPain from the freezing water intensified and I was also experiencing discomfort because I was unused to feeling supported. An irrational fear came over me \u2013 if I didn\u2019t break free, to move by myself in a way I was used to, I might sink. But then I felt a strange force pushing up from under me and realised it wasn\u2019t just Williams supporting me, but the river itself.\n\nDoing as Williams asked \u2013 to relinquish control and acknowledge pain and trust \u2013 I tipped my head back and focused on the warmth of the sun\u2019s rays. I remembered something I\u2019d read earlier by Ungunmerr-Baumann. \u201cWe cannot hurry the river. We have to move with its current and understand its ways,\u201d she\u2019d written. Moments later, much to my disbelief, my ears filled with a sound like the motor of a distant power boat, growing louder and resonating within \u2013 sounding a lot like anxiety, according to Williams\u2019 earlier description. Letting go, I breathed out and went under.\n\nFrom my own experience, recovering from depression is a little like resurfacing from a cold river; thoughts like colours and sounds seem brighter, louder, clearer. And even if there\u2019s no magic fix for mental illness, it seems indigenous Australians have much to teach us about developing greater awareness and reciprocity with our planet for our physical and emotional survival \u2013 if we only take the time to listen.\n\n\u201cYou need to ask, who you are, why you\u2019re here, where you\u2019re going,\u201d Ungunmerr-Baumann told me. \u201cWe know who we are as Aboriginal people. It\u2019s in our language, dreaming, country. We\u2019re waiting for all people to listen and hear what we hear so that we can connect and belong together.\u201d\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"The Essential List\".
