REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo\n\nJohnson & Johnson paid more than $2.2 billion in 2013 to resolve civil and criminal investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice into its marketing of Risperdal and other drugs.\n\nEarlier this month, the company agreed to pay $20.4 million to settle claims by two Ohio counties, avoiding a federal opioid trial.\n\nAn Oklahoma judge in August ordered J&J to pay $572.1 million to that state for its part in fueling the opioid crisis by deceptively marketing addictive painkillers, a sum that was substantially less than investors had expected.", "description": "Johnson & Johnson shares were off more than 2% on Wednesday, a day after a U.S. jury said it must pay $8 billion in punitive damages to a plaintiff in a case involving its anti-psychotic drug Risperdal, a penalty the company and others are confident will not stand.", "authors": ["Tamara Mathias", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438847408&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9818C", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
