Photo: Stefani Reynolds/Getty Images\n\nIn a morally bankrupt but financially prudent capitulation to China\u2019s autocratic government, the National Basketball Association on Sunday apologized on behalf of Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets, for his since-deleted tweet that included the line \u201cFight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong.\u201d Dissidents in Hong Kong have flooded the streets since March to oppose legislation that would\u2019ve threatened their autonomy from mainland China and to call for democratic reforms. China\u2019s central government has dubbed the unrest \u201cthe most severe situation [in Hong Kong] since its handover\u201d from British to Chinese control in 1997.\n\nChina for months has sought to cast the demonstrators as violent separatists, despite most showing no interest in independence and the most severe forms of violence being deployed by the police, not the protesters. But this has challenged the NBA\u2019s stance on political speech: The league has cultivated its brand as uniquely amenable to employees and players who vocalize their politics, but it sees in China one of its most lucrative international markets and wishes to avoid angering its government. This tension was reflected in the differing statements the league issued from its American and Chinese social-media accounts. The English-language version read in part, \u201cWe recognize that the views expressed by Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey have deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable.\u201d The Mandarin version read, \u201cWe are extremely disappointed in the inappropriate comment by the general manager of the Houston Rockets, Daryl Morey.\u201d\n\n(League spokesman Mike Bass clarified that \u201cthere should be no discrepancy\u201d between the two and that the \u201cstatement in English is the league\u2019s official statement\u201d; it remains unclear if the Mandarin version was altered to clarify this.)\n\nThe political backlash to the NBA\u2019s response was strident and bipartisan but found perhaps its loudest megaphone in Senator Marco Rubio. In a series of tweets on Monday, the Republican indulged one of his most cherished pursuits: conveying his outrage at people who behave sycophantically toward autocrats, as long as those autocrats aren\u2019t his president and those people aren\u2019t Marco Rubio. He conveyed \u201cdisgust\u201d with the NBA\u2019s deference but focused specifically on what he saw as its hypocrisy \u2014 a willingness, on the part of the league and its players, to articulate outrage toward injustice in America but not abroad. This is a remarkable accusation, given that Rubio has done little to leverage his own power as a U.S. senator to undermine the autocrat who leads his party, but loudly decries autocratic behavior from foreign leaders \u2014 the result, it seems, of a calculation strikingly similar to that being made by the NBA.\n\nRubio\u2019s relationship with the president is one of the most unique in modern politics, in that Rubio is among a handful of Republican officials who ran against Trump for the GOP nomination in 2016. He\u2019s also one of a handful who occasionally contradict the president in public: Most notably, he responded to Trump\u2019s tweets demanding that four nonwhite congresswomen go back to where they came from by saying, quite courageously, \u201cThe president shouldn\u2019t have written that.\u201d (All four are U.S. citizens, and three were born in the U.S.) But aside from such displays, Rubio\u2019s nerve has generally failed him, as when he voted with Trump\u2019s position in the Senate 90 percent of the time since January 2017, or when he sat beaming in the audience as the racist who used to call him \u201cLittle Marco\u201d kicked off his 2020 reelection bid in June. Most recently, the Florida senator \u2014 who has showered the internet with tweetstorms supporting pro-democracy protests in Venezuela, Russia, and Hong Kong \u2014 tacitly affirmed Trump\u2019s right to ask China to investigate his political opponents by claiming the president wasn\u2019t being serious. (China and Ukraine, Trump\u2019s other sought-after partner in his anti\u2013Joe Biden crusade, don\u2019t seem to think so.)\n\nSycophancy has fast become Rubio\u2019s defining trait when it comes to dealing with the president, whose threat to the democratic norms the senator purports to hold dear couldn\u2019t be clearer. Just this summer, Trump defended before the Supreme Court an effort to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census, an effort that failed only because his administration couldn\u2019t lie convincingly enough about why he wanted it: to enhance the political power of white people at the expense of Latinos, as explained in the GOP strategy documents that guided the administration. Rubio isn\u2019t alone. Other Trump loyalists masquerading as mavericks have decried the NBA\u2019s obeisance to anti-speech strong-arming while continuing to back Trump, a leader who regularly lies about the nonexistent scourge of illegal voting to undermine Democratic victories and has called for NFL players to be fired if they don\u2019t stand for the national anthem. These include Ben Sasse, Tom Cotton, and Ted Cruz, with a media assist from Laura Ingraham. But Rubio\u2019s insistence on casting himself as a champion of global democracy movements makes his inclusion especially telling about his party\u2019s loyalties.\n\nThose loyalties are to maintaining power, first and foremost. And the principle behind their pursuit of power is the pursuit of money, as evidenced by the GOP\u2019s dogged attempts at radical deregulation, their corporate handouts, and the gutting of social-welfare programs. These are necessarily anti-democratic activities as they encourage the hoarding of wealth and the insulation from taxation and public responsibility of billionaires. They amass support from voters by inflaming bigotry and disempowering the opposition\u2019s constituencies at the ballot box. None of this is a mystery to Rubio, who could easily undermine the Republican agenda in his public statements or, more important, with his voting record. That he hasn\u2019t is attributable to the calculation he has made about the importance of money and power and the costs of defying both as a GOP senator serving under a bigoted autocrat who nevertheless has stayed faithful to a fairly standard Republican economic and cultural agenda. Rubio has concluded that the costs are too high. It\u2019s not a dissimilar conclusion from the one the NBA has drawn about its dealings with China. Financially prudent moves are often morally bankrupt. Far from taking umbrage at the NBA\u2019s prostration, Rubio should feel right at home.", "description": "The NBA apologized to China and its fans there for Daryl Morey, the Houston Rockets general manager who tweeted his support for Hong Kong protesters.
