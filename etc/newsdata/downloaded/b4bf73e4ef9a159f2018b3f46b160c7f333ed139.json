Disrupt events, the premiere technology conferences hosted by TechCrunch, are known the world over as the place to launch, network, invest in and collaborate with the international early-stage startup community.\n\nDisrupt offers plenty of startup action \u2014 world-class speakers, Startup Battlefield, hundreds of exhibitors, workshops, a hackathon and more. And it turns out that early-stage startup founders have lots of different reasons for loving Disrupt. Let us count the ways.\n\nEducation and collaboration\n\nTech evolves so quickly, amirite? When a startup has a new or complex concept, Disrupt is a great place to educate your community. Or to learn about new advances.\n\nCase in point: Vlad Larin, the co-founder of Zeroqode, went to Disrupt Berlin to evangelize the startup\u2019s no-code technology.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to help people understand the technology and to spread the word that no-code development is real and it\u2019s happening today. Exhibiting in Startup Alley at Disrupt Berlin was the perfect place for us to start those conversations.\u201d\n\nLarin also viewed Disrupt as an opportunity to meet like-minded people and to build collaborative relationships with other startups.\n\n\u201cWe met all kinds of people looking for new ideas, collaboration and inspiration \u2014 people who want to learn and exchange ideas about the latest products and industry trends.\u201d\n\nMeet other founders\n\nDisrupt provides plenty of opportunity to meet and learn from other founders. Case in point: Caleb John, the co-founder of Cedar Robotics, went to Disrupt San Francisco to meet other early-stage startup founders, something he\u2019d never experienced. The chance to meet seasoned entrepreneurs from a range of industries, to build relationships and to learn from them was a major draw.\n\n\u201cJust talking about my business with other founders who understand what it takes to build a startup was incredibly valuable. They can look at your roadmap from a non-technical viewpoint, help you avoid pitfalls and make sure you\u2019re running things smoothly in terms of your business practices.\u201d\n\nJohn built connections with R&D startups and potential investors \u2014 collaborative relationships he says may pay off down the road.\n\n\u201cBuilding relationships with those firms was very helpful, and I say going to TechCrunch Disrupt is a no-brainer. It\u2019s something every startup founder should experience.\u201d\n\nFind funding\n\nCash is the lifeblood of any early stage startup and Disrupt is ripe with investors eager to fatten their investment portfolios. Case in point: David Hall, co-founder and president of Park and Diamond, went to Disrupt hoping to raise a round of funding.\n\n\u201cInvestors from all over the world come to Disrupt. The chance to have those discussions and to potentially form relationships was invaluable.\u201d\n\nHall credits his Disrupt experience with improving the startup\u2019s overall growth.\n\n\u201cThe exposure we received at TechCrunch Disrupt completely changed our trajectory and made it easier to raise funds and jump to the next stage.\u201d\n\nThe funding they received as a result of connections cultivated at Disrupt allowed them to relocate from Virginia to New York and to make the company\u2019s first key hires.\n\n\u201cTechCrunch draws that entrepreneurial community, and you never know when you\u2019ll bump into the right person. Disrupt offers so many opportunities \u2014 you\u2019d be foolish not to go.\u201d\n\nDisrupt Berlin 2019 takes place on 11-12 December.
