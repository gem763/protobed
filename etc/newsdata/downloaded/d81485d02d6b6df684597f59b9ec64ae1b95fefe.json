Despite reporting that under a \u201csecret\u201d impeachment inquiry vote, 30-35 Republicans would vote in favor of it, Amodei is the only member to publicly say he supports an inquiry.\n\nAmodei, who is chair of Trump\u2019s re-election campaign in Nevada, announced his decision on a phone call with the media on Friday.\n\nMore from Rolling Stone\n\n\u201cListen, I want to see what the process produces,\u201d Amodei said. \u201cAnd quite frankly, if there\u2019s something there that rises to that level, then guess what, that\u2019s not something that we can have by a Democrat or a Republican.\u201d\n\nIn a statement issued by his office following the call, Amodei said that while he supported the inquiry, he was not in favor of impeachment, reserving judgment on whether the president violated the law.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big fan of oversight, so let\u2019s let the committees get to work and see where it goes,\u201d Amodei said during the conference call. \u201cUsing government agencies to, if it\u2019s proven, to put your finger on the scale of an election, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right. If it turns out that it\u2019s something along those lines, then there\u2019s a problem.\u201d\n\nMichigan Rep. Justin Amash, who left the Republican Party in July, is the only member of Congress not in the Democratic Party to support actual impeachment, publicly announcing in May that the president has committed \u201cimpeachable conduct.\u201d\n\nFollowing reports that Amodei supported impeachment, he clarified to the Nevada Independent: \u201cIf it was my statement and I had the ability to do it over, I would probably phrase it differently,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know that it\u2019s a smoking gun.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s why we have the committee process,\u201d he added. \u201cI won\u2019t attribute what was in the president\u2019s mind. That wasn\u2019t a great way to express concern about it. Part of what the committees will do is try to find some context for that and then based on what a fair reading of the context is, they\u2019ll go forward from there.\u201d\n\nAmodei was also cautious not to go too far with his statement, lest he be portrayed as supporting House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. \u201cPlease, nobody hang up the phone and say, \u2018Amodei is Pelosi\u2019s defender,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nSee where your favorite artists and songs rank on the Rolling Stone Charts.\n\n\n\nSign up for Rolling Stone\u2019s Newsletter.
