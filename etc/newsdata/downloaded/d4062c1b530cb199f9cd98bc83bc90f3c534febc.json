(Ethan Miller/Getty Images)\n\nThe Women\u2019s March is replacing three inaugural board members who have been dogged by accusations of anti-Semitism, infighting and financial mismanagement \u2014 controversies some say have slowed the organization\u2019s progress and diminished its impact.\n\nCo-Chairs Bob Bland, Tamika Mallory and Linda Sarsour stepped down from the board July 15, though the organization has been slow to announce their departures. The Women\u2019s March website continued to host their photos and titles as co-chairs through this week, when the group announced the board turnover.\n\nA diverse cast of 16 new board members that includes three Jewish women, a transgender woman, a former legislator, two religious leaders and a member of the Oglala tribe of the Lakota nation will inherit an organization recovering from a failed attempt to trademark the Women\u2019s March name and fractured relationships with local activist groups and the Jewish community.\n\n[What\u2019s in a name? Women\u2019s March groups spar over who owns the name and the movement.]\n\nThe shake-up comes at a critical time for the organization. With the 2020 election kicking into high gear, experts said organizers can no longer afford the distractions and controversies that have muddled the group\u2019s message and loomed over its every move.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an opportunity here for a group to rise out of the ashes of divisiveness and continue on with the mission that was the Women\u2019s March, and, honestly, that would be wonderful,\u201d said Dana R. Fisher, a sociology professor at the University of Maryland who studies and tracks protest movements. \u201cThere were so many things that were odd decisions, and decisions that made it unclear whether they actually cared about building toward a blue wave and building on the energy and enthusiasm that was built in 2017.\u201d\n\nBland and Mallory, who served as co-presidents of the organization, will be formally replaced when the new board convenes for its first meeting this month. Once assembled, officials said, the incoming board will elect new leadership.\n\n\n\nWith the Capitol in the background, a crowd fills a street in the District during the Women's March on Jan. 21, 2017.

It thanked Sarsour, Mallory and Bland for their \u201cgroundbreaking work and sacrifices towards equal rights.\u201d\n\nCalls for the co-chairs to resign rose to a crescendo ahead of the 2019 Women\u2019s March on Washington, which drew thousands of women to the District in January sporting the movement\u2019s telltale pink hats.\n\nMuch of the controversy stems from an incident when Mallory attended a Nation of Islam event at which black nationalist Louis Farrakhan made incendiary remarks about Jews. The march\u2019s leadership tried to quell the outrage, reaching out to the Jewish community and denouncing anti-Semitism, but leaders stopped short of denouncing Farrakhan, who is known for making virulently anti-Semitic remarks.\n\nMallory didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment on her departure, although the organization issued a statement Monday that said the three would \u201ctransition off of the Women\u2019s March Board and onto other projects focused on advocacy within their respective organizations.\u201d\n\nReached via text message, Sarsour said the new Women\u2019s March board is \u201cAMAZING,\u201d adding that she will continue working to get voters to the polls in 2020.\n\n\u201cI am grateful to the women who stepped up to shepherd the Women\u2019s March,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThis is what women supporting women looks like.\u201d\n\nBland said the changeover was long planned by the outgoing leadership.\n\nThe new board members \u2014 several of whom acknowledged that the organization has made \u201cmistakes and missteps\u201d in the past \u2014 were selected by a nominating committee.\n\nThe new board members are:\n\n\u2022 Samia Assed, a Palestinian American activist from New Mexico who serves on the board of the Albuquerque Center for Peace and Justice and leads the organization\u2019s New Mexico chapter.\n\n\u2022 Zahra Billoo, a civil rights attorney and executive director of the San Francisco Bay area chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations.\n\n\u2022 Charlene Carruthers, a self-described black, queer feminist who is the founding national director of BYP100 (Black Youth Project 100), a racial, gender and LGBT justice organization for black youth.\n\n\u2022 Mrinalini Chakraborty, executive director of Men4Choice, who has been a Women\u2019s March organizer and national field director, and founded Women\u2019s March Illinois.\n\n\u2022 Rabbi Tamara Cohen, who runs innovation for Moving Traditions, a national organization focused on teens and gender and Jewish identity, who spearheaded the creation of Tzelem, a group for transgender and non-binary youth.\n\n\u2022 The Rev.

Kavanaugh\u2019s appointment and \u201chis work to overturn Roe v. Wade,\u201d according to Women\u2019s March organizers.\n\nThe group also will focus on seeing through a federal policy platform unveiled last year that outlined a 10-prong call to action for lawmakers. The platform, known as \u201cthe Women\u2019s Agenda,\u201d outlines priorities such as raising the federal minimum wage, addressing reproductive rights and violence against women, and passing the long-dormant Equal Rights Amendment.\n\n[Women\u2019s March rolls out political platform before its third Washington rally]\n\nTo some, the plan to issue a legislative agenda on behalf of all women spoke directly to the growing rift at the center of the Women\u2019s March movement: What began as a grass-roots collaboration by hundreds of distinct organizations and activists became increasingly defined by one group and its leadership team of four women.\n\nSeveral cities, including Washington, New York and Philadelphia, saw competing Women\u2019s Marches in January, with groups offering alternative rallies for women who didn\u2019t want to affiliate with the national group.\n\n\n\nPeople gather ahead of the start of the Women's March at Freedom Plaza in the District. (Salwan Georges/The Washington Post)\n\nEarlier this year, the national Women\u2019s March organization abandoned its effort to trademark the words \u201cwomen\u2019s march,\u201d bringing a splintering two-year battle over who owns the words and the movement to a close.\n\n[Women\u2019s March group drops application to trademark name after two-year battle]\n\nMany organizers separate from the national Women\u2019s March group celebrated the national group\u2019s about-face as a victory for the movement. More than a dozen local organizations across the country formally opposed the national group\u2019s trademark petition, claiming that no entity can own the words \u201cwomen\u2019s march\u201d or the activism it inspired. Four of them sued.\n\nNew board members said they hope to change the focus and reputation of the Women\u2019s March.\n\n\u201cMost of us are new to this,\u201d Green said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any relationship with the state chapters. I think we\u2019re open to make sure we\u2019re building the right movement for everyone.\u201d\n\nFisher said research shows organizers of successful protest movements have strong relationships with stakeholders.\n\n\u201cIf this new board can\u2019t turn the ship around and create an organization that can play well with others, they\u2019ll be back in the same position as they were before,\u201d she said.\n\nThe story of the Women\u2019s March began in 2016 with a Facebook post calling for women to rally in the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s election. As the new board convenes, members said the group plans to return to its roots in crafting priorities.\n\nThey said the main goal will be getting President Trump out of the White House.\n\n\u201cThe priority for me is really dealing with the very serious consequences of what the president and his administration is doing and causing,\u201d Flores said. \u201cOnce we\u2019re in the general [election], the number one priority will be to defeat Trump, and we will do whatever it takes.\u201d\n\nSeveral newly appointed board members said the Women\u2019s March\u2019s biggest challenge remains its greatest strength: having a wide base of support among women with various life experiences and priorities.\n\n\u201cThere is so much energy to harness, and as we approach what may be the most challenging election of our lives \u2014 even more challenging than the last one \u2014 the biggest challenge the Women\u2019s March will face is being able to harness our biggest strength and turn that energy into action,\u201d Billoo said.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe Women\u2019s March in Year 3: Can the movement overcome a year of controversy and division?\n\nThe Women\u2019s March drew more moderates in its third year.
