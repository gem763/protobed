It allows Iran to refine uranium only with first-generation IR-1 centrifuges and to use small numbers of more advanced centrifuges solely for research, but without stockpiling enriched uranium, for a period of 10 years.\n\n\u201cMachines developed by our own research and development will help accumulate reserves. This was done yesterday and announced to the IAEA today,\u201d Kamalvandi said, referring to the UN nuclear watchdog, which is monitoring compliance with the deal.\n\n\u201cThis includes IR-6 machines which have now been fed (uranium) gas. A chain of 20 IR-4 centrifuges has also been started. The IR-6 has also started as a chain of 20 since yesterday,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will soon test our IR-8 centrifuge cascade by injecting gas into 3 IR-8 machines.\u201d\n\nAdvanced centrifuges can enrich at a much faster pace.\n\nThe nuclear accord also capped the level of purity to which Iran can enrich uranium hexafluoride, the feedstock for centrifuges, at 3.67%, which is suitable for civilian power generation and far below the 90% threshold of nuclear weapons grade.\n\nThe 20% level represents a significant leap towards bomb material, though Iran has argued that it could be put to running its Bushehr nuclear power reactor.\n\n\u201cThe UN nuclear watchdog has been informed about our new nuclear steps and it still has access to our nuclear sites,\u201d Kamalvandi said.\n\nFrance, Germany and Britain have struggled to save the deal by setting up a barter trade mechanism with Iran, which has yet to get off the ground, while Tehran on Wednesday set a 60-day deadline for the Europeans.\n\n\u201cWe do not currently intend to make any changes to IAEA inspections and our transparency obligations are being met as before,\u201d Kamalvandi said.\n\n\u201c(But) when the other sides do not carry out their commitments, they should not expect Iran to fulfil its commitments\u201d to limit nuclear capacity set by the deal.", "description": "Nuclear agency says it is able to raise uranium enrichment past 20% level, even though it has not immediate plans to do so", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9935b0c2013f5e44d455735a2ed7f01c6386068f/0_126_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=aa5873b505c7222120a2d20fde0e8448", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
