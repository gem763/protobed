She was caught with $6,233, hidden in her (very) personal stash.\n\nAfter being searched by a female officer, Rolland admitted to stealing the money \u2014 but denied ownership of the meth found with it. Police records indicate that when questioned, she admitted to the theft of the money. Still, Rolland insisted the drugs were not hers. She did not, however, have an explanation for the officers as to how it made it into her body.\n\nNow, two months later, Rolland has been sentenced to four months in the Ouachita Parish Correctional Center in northern Louisiana. In exchange for the reduced sentence and dismissal of the theft charge, she has pleaded guilty to \u201cpossession of a controlled dangerous substance.\u201d\n\nMystery solved.", "description": "Ashley Beth Rolland, 24, has admitted ownership of the meth found stuffed in her vagina when she was arrested for robbery.", "authors": ["Nate Church"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Ashley-Beth-Rolland-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
