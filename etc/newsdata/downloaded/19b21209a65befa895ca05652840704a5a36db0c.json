But at the same time, it is very strange how this topic is interpreted in football. I have heard absolutely nothing (during the game).\u201d\n\nMost of the Bulgaria players said they had not heard any abuse of the England team, with keeper Plamen Iliev saying: \u201cThe crowd was behaving well, I have not heard any insults.\u201d\n\nBulgarian Football Union vice-president Yordan Lechkov added: \u201cIt\u2019s quite disappointing to focus on racism. It\u2019s not serious to concentrate on that if there\u2019s a qualifier like this and we\u2019re playing against a team like England.\u201d\n\nBulgaria captain Ivelin Popov tried to appeal to the home supporters in a heated discussion at halftime. He did not go to the dressing room but instead attempted to explain to the fans that their behaviour was unacceptable.\n\nRegarding Popov\u2019s efforts, England\u2019s first goalscorer Marcus Rashford said: \u201cAlso been told what the Bulgaria captain did at half-time. To stand alone and do the right thing takes courage and acts like that shouldn\u2019t go unnoticed.\u201d\n\nBalakov also explained his comments on Sunday that England had a bigger racism problem than Bulgaria.\n\n\u201cWhat I meant was that in the Bulgarian championship we\u2019ve not had such problems while there have been incidents in various levels of English football involving racism,\u201d he told a news conference after Monday\u2019s game.\n\n\u201cBut we don\u2019t have this problem in Bulgaria, I can assure you of that.\u201d\n\nBoncho Genchev, the first Bulgarian to play in the English top flight, added that the Balkan country had no serious problems with racism. \u201cIt\u2019s not serious to say Bulgarian fans are racist,\u201d said the ex-Ipswich Town and Luton Town striker.\n\nIn a letter to UEFA, Bulgarian Football Union (BFU) chief Borislav Mihaylov on Thursday expressed \u201cextreme disappointment\u201d at the England players\u2019 comments ahead of the match regarding action they would take if subjected to racist abuse and spoke of the \u201cunjust branding\u201d of local fans.[L5N26V56A]\n\nEuropean soccer\u2019s governing body UEFA had ordered the BFU to partially close the Vasil Levski national stadium for England\u2019s visit after supporters were found guilty of racist behaviour in matches earlier this year.\n\nThe BFU and a number of Bulgarian clubs have been fined by for racist abuse several times over the past few years.", "description": "Bulgaria coach Krasimir Balakov and several of his players said they did not hear any racist abuse directed towards the England team on Monday during their side's 6-0 defeat in a Euro 2020 qualifier that was twice halted by the referee.", "authors": ["Angel Krasimirov", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440888701&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D1XG", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
