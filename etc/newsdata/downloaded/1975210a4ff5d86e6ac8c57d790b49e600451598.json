Photo: New Canaan Police Department\n\nOn May 24, Jennifer Dulos of New Canaan, Connecticut, mysteriously vanished after suffering what investigators believe was a \u201cserious physical assault.\u201d Since her disappearance, police have discovered her abandoned car, bloodstained clothes, and video footage that points toward two suspects: Dulos\u2019s estranged husband and his girlfriend, Michelle Troconis.\n\nHere\u2019s what we know so far:\n\nJennifer Dulos disappeared on May 24.\n\nAccording to police, the last day Dulos, 50, was seen or heard from was May 24, when she dropped her kids off at school. The same day, police discovered her abandoned 2017 black Chevrolet Suburban, which she was believed to be driving at the time of her disappearance, in Waveny Park. That evening, police found bloodstains and spatter in her home\u2019s garage.\n\nSince opening the case, Connecticut State Police say they have received hundreds of tips regarding Dulos\u2019s disappearance, the Stamford Advocate reports.\n\nThere are two main suspects: Dulos\u2019s estranged husband and his girlfriend.\n\nOn June 1, Fotis Dulos, 51, and his girlfriend, Michelle Troconis, 44, were arrested and charged with tampering with or fabricating physical evidence, as well as hindering prosecution. Per court documents, video footage captured a man \u2014 who appears to be the estranged husband \u2014 disposing of garbage bags in multiple trash bins in Hartford, and then getting into a car with a woman who resembles Troconis. Inside the garbage bags, authorities reportedly found clothing and sponges stained with Dulos\u2019s blood, according to Fotis and Troconis\u2019s arrest warrants. And, on June 11, prosecutors said in court that a lab had confirmed that Fotis\u2019s DNA was found on the sink in Dulos\u2019s house, per the New York Post. Both Fotis and Troconic were freed on $500,000 bail.\n\nTroconis and Fotis stood by each other\u2019s version of events at the time of their initial arrest; in recent weeks, however, it appears that she\u2019s slowly turned on him. In an interview on August 13, Troconis told detectives that Fotis had his truck cleaned on May 29 \u201cbecause the body of Jennifer at some point was in there,\u201d according the New York Post; she also, according to an arrest warrant, claims that she and Fotis used what police are calling \u201calibi scripts\u201d that outlined their supposed activities and whereabouts the day of Dulos\u2019s disappearance. On September 4, Fotis was arrested and charged again with tampering with evidence. Later in the day, he was released after posting the $500,000 bond. (He is scheduled to appear in court on September 12, per NBC Connecticut, and is expected to plead not guilty.)\n\nThen, on September 5, Troconis reportedly turned herself into state investigators on a new charge of evidence tampering, the New York Times reports. Like Fotis, she was released the same day after posting bond. As of now, Connecticut authorities have not directly implicated Troconis in Dulos\u2019s disappearance.\n\nFotis and Jennifer were in a bitter custody battle at the time of her disappearance.\n\nWhile Fotis\u2019s lawyer has argued that Jennifer had staged her disappearance in an attempt to get her revenge on Fotis \u2014 a Gone Girl\u2013inspired scheme \u2014most reports point to Jennifer and Fotis\u2019s custody battle as a potential motive for the alleged murder. (Both Jennifer\u2019s family and Gone Girl author Gillian Flynn have rejected the lawyer\u2019s claim, calling it \u201csick.\u201d) In divorce papers, Jennifer accuses Fotis of infidelity and calls his behavior \u201cirrational, unsafe, bullying, threatening and controlling,\u201d per the Advocate. (Fotis has denied the allegations.) Furthermore, court documents show that Fotis may have struggled financially, per CBS News.\n\nSince May 24, the couple\u2019s five children have been staying with Jennifer\u2019s mother, who has been granted custody of them.\n\nThis post has been updated and will continue to be updated as new details emerge.", "description": "On May 24, Jennifer Dulos of New Canaan, Connecticut, a mother of five, vanished amid a custody dispute with her estranged husband.
