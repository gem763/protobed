Awestruck in wonder of its biodiversity,' one social media user responded.\n\nAnother described the creature as 'truly incredible'.\n\nSenior Curator of Entomology at Museums Victoria Dr Ken Walker identified the creature as an 'eucyclodes caterpillar'.\n\nEntomologist and nature photographer Matthew Connors said camouflage was a distinctive feature of the caterpillar.\n\n'The reason for its strange appearance is not so much that it wants to look like a fern but more that it's aiming to look less like a caterpillar,' he said.\n\n'It helps in confusing predators that are looking for prey that looks like a regular caterpillar'.\n\nThe caterpillar will eventually evolve into a Lichen moth, which can be found all over the world, except most Australian species are endemic, only occurring in Australia.\n\nThe caterpillars typically feed on lichens and algae and the one Ms Blaker found had camouflaged itself to prevent predators from recognising it as prey.", "description": "An 'awestruck' gardener has had an bizarre encounter with a insect so rare she's been forced to take to social media to uncover its identity.", "authors": ["Adam Mccleery For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/06/19821906-0-image-a-28_1571290325352.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
