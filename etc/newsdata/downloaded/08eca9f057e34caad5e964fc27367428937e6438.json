Well done, guys and girls.\"\n\nIt all could have been so different for Vettel had he hung on to his spot at the front of the queue as Ferrari grabbed a fifth straight pole.\n\nThe German won qualifying earlier Sunday in sunny skies ahead of teammate Charles Leclerc and Bottas -- all race activities were canceled Saturday due to the impending arrival of Hagibis -- on the Suzuka track he enjoys racing on.\n\nHe'd won in Japan four times previously.\n\nValtteri Bottas celebrates after winning the Japanese Grand Prix.\n\nUltimately, Vettel had to hang on to finish second, a mere 0.4 seconds faster than Hamilton.\n\nThe top three all employed a two-stop strategy, with Hamilton the last to take his second stop on lap 43 of the scheduled 53.\n\n\"I lost the momentum,\" said Vettel. \"It was a really poor start. With the lack of pace, second is probably the maximum but I'm not happy with the very first start of the race. To get pole and second is a reasonable day.\"\n\nLeclerc finished sixth despite colliding with Red Bull's Max Verstappen on the first lap. It left Verstappen with significant damage to the back of his car and he eventually had to stop on lap 15.\n\nVerstappen fuming\n\nLeclerc seemed to cut across Verstappen and the Dutchman was left fuming.\n\n\"Suddenly into turn two Charles just drove into the side of my car,\" he said. \"From my side I don't think I could have done anything differently.\n\n\"The weird thing for me is that, initially, they don't even investigate it. My whole car is destroyed. What more should he do to get a penalty?\n\n\"I like hard racing but I don't think this was hard racing. This was just irresponsible driving into turn two.\"\n\nLeclerc responded: \"I don't know what happened from the full situation from the outside, and this I need to look at.\"\n\nVettel, meanwhile, escaped any penalties for a possible jump start.", "description": "Valtteri Bottas overtook pole-sitter Sebastian Vettel at the start and won the Japanese Grand Prix to help Mercedes clinch a record-tying sixth straight constructors' championship, a day after Typhoon Hagibis battered parts of the country.", "authors": ["Ravi Ubha"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191013081018-bottas-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
