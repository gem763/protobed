It is therefore extremely important that trains arrive on time during those times,\u201d Sithole said.\n\nThe achievement was made through weekly meetings with all the regions every Wednesday, where progress reports are shared and issues are ironed out, he said.\n\nSithole said other improvements include improving the number of people paying for Prasa services in one region in Pretoria, where new trains sets are being used, from 39% to 91%.\n\nThe railway lines under temporary speed restriction because of infrastructure problems, such as lack of electronic signalling, have also declined from 167km to 138km.\n\nPrasa is now on track to have around 94km of railways under temporary restriction by the end of December, Sithole said.\n\nSithole said the state-owned entity has stepped up procurement and repairs on trains, and is on track to have 191 trainsets by March 2020.\n\n\u201cThe biggest obstacle we are facing is the continued vandalism of railways, stealing of cables, and people using our services for free,\u201d he said.\n\nTo address this, Prasa is planning to spend around R6.5 billion over three years to fence railway lines in urban areas with concrete blocks.\n\nWhen the lines have all been fenced, Prasa expects that revenue will increase by R4.6 billion as commuters will no longer be able to jump off before stations, and therefore will have to buy tickets.\n\nIt will also mean less vandalism which will reduce delays caused by signalling cables being stolen.\n\n\u201cWe will then be able to start recovering all the passengers we\u2019ve lost over the years, and start making rail the transport of choice,\u201d Sithole said.", "description": "The Passenger Rail Agency of SA plans to spend R6.5 billion to secure railway lines with concrete blocks \u2013\u00a0which it expects will increase revenue by R4.6 billion.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2830/aded5eadefa348c8af31fd7ba9e3f1bc.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
