Inmates at the camp include British former ice cream seller Aseel Muthana\n\nHis family feared he had died but Muthana has now resurfaced at the prison camp in northern Syria and his mother has backed his plea to come home.\n\n'Back then when I first came to ISIS, you have to understand I came way before the caliphate was pronounced,' he said.\n\n'Before all of these beheading videos, before all of the burnings happened, before any of that stuff.\n\n'We came when ISIS propaganda and ISIS media was all about helping the poor, helping the Syrian people.'\n\nThe wave of widely publicised ISIS beheadings began later in 2014, when journalist James Foley and British aid worker David Haines were among numerous people murdered in propaganda videos broadcast by the terror group.\n\nHowever, ISIS had its roots in extremist groups which had been using beheadings during the war in Iraq well before that.\n\nInmates at one of the centres which are are controlled by the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, which spearheaded the fight against ISIS in eastern Syria\n\nTens of thousands of fighters and other members of the group are held in the detention centres across northern Syria and in Iraq\n\nThere are 5,000 prisoners in the camp, many of them foreign extremists who are demanding to return to their home countries\n\nBegging to come home, Muthana said he missed his mother Umm Amin and his former life in the Welsh capital where he worked selling ice cream.\n\nThe fate of his brother Nasser remains unclear while his friend Reeyad Khan was killed by a drone strike in 2015.\n\n'Muthana is the latest British ISIS fighter to plea for mercy after the terror group's so-called 'caliphate' crumbled to nothing earlier this year.\n\nJihadi bride Shamima Begum last week renewed her plea to return, saying her only role in the so-called caliphate was to 'make babies'.\n\nThe Government has repeatedly refused her request and then-Home Secretary Sajid Javid stripped her of British citizenship earlier this year.\n\nAnother ISIS bride, Tooba Gondal, pleaded to come home with her children in an interview published at the weekend.\n\n'I want to face justice in a British court. I wish to redeem myself. I would like Britain to accept my apology and to give me another chance,' she said.", "description": "ISIS fighters in orange prison jumpsuits are packed into jail cells, many of them lying on the floor of a cramped medical wing at the camp in northern Syria.", "authors": ["Tim Stickings For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/03/10/19246132-0-image-a-28_1570095476027.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
