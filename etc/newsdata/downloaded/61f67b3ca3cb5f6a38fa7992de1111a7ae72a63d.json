In California, as growing numbers turned to social-welfare agencies, Mexicans faced mounting criticism for draining public resources that some people felt should be reserved for \u201cAmericans.\u201d Los Angeles County officials coerced Mexican and Mexican American families to repatriate en masse, threatening to cut off their aid and promising, falsely, that they could return.\n\nThe county prepared to \u201cmove the first load\u201d of Mexicans across the border at the cost of $14.70 per adult and half that amount for children under 12. One official noted that a \u201clower rate\u201d would be possible if the county transported \u201ctwo hundred or more at a time.\u201d The first train left Los Angeles for Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez on March 23, 1931, carrying 350 repatriates. Soon after, another train took 1,150. By the end of 1933, 15 trains had sent 12,668 individuals to Mexico, many of them U.S. citizens. The repatriation program lasted for four years. The Los Angeles Times estimated that the \u201cSouthern California exodus\u201d numbered 75,000, but hundreds of thousands more people were scared into leaving on their own. Historians estimate that a third of the Mexican-origin community left Los Angeles for Mexico during the Depression.", "description": "A very short book excerpt", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/2019/10/DIS_VSBE_Deportations_forcrops/facebook.jpg?1570795205", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
