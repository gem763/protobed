Everything lined up for this perfect arrest.\"\n\nAccording to WBS-TV, Coughman\u2019s business partner, another NFL player, was arrested for selling alcohol after hours in their business without a license.\n\nCoughman has been bonded out of jail. He's facing three charges including insurance fraud, making a false report and a tag violation for taking his plate off.\n\nThe Yelp page for the Lawrenceville business has been flooded with negative reviews referencing the incident.
