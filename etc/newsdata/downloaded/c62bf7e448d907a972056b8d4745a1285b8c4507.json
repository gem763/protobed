Fourteen victims remain missing. Approximately four to six bodies were discovered in the wreckage but were unable to be recovered by nightfall.\n\nU.S. Coast Guard Capt. Monica Rochester announced that the Coast Guard was suspending search efforts, as \"no additional signs of distress or debris has been witnessed.\" Rochester said the nearly 24-hour search operation included seven missions and three helicopters crews, covering an area of 160 miles.\n\nU.S. Coast Guard Captain Monica Rochester talks about the latest developments of the Santa Barbara scuba boat fire at a press conference in Santa Barbara, September 3, 2019. More\n\nThe boat carried six crew members and 33 passengers when it went up in flames during a recreational scuba diving trip. The passengers and one crew member were assigned to bunk beds on the bottom of the deck. Five crew members sleeping on the top deck jumped off and took a dinghy to safety. Two suffered minor injuries.\n\nThe crew members took their dinghy to a private fishing boat, The Grape Escape, that was anchored near the north shore of Santa Cruz Island. The boat's owners said two of the crew members went back to look for survivors but found no one.\n\nInvestigators have yet to determine the cause of the fire. Authorities said Tuesday that there was no indication that an explosion had occurred. Passengers were unable to get out because both the main stairwell and escape hatch were likely blocked by fire. It is unclear whether passengers were actually asleep when they died, Rochester said.\n\nWhat caused the fire?

More\n\nRochester said the boat was equipped with a fixed firefighting system, as well as various portable extinguishers. She could not immediately confirm when the system was last tested.\n\nSanta Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said the victims range from teenagers to senior citizens. A majority appear to be from the Santa Cruz region.\n\nAuthorities had not confirmed the victims' cause of death, and autopsies were underway. Brown said that many, if not all, of the victims will need to be identified through DNA analysis. Investigators will be coordinating with family members to collect DNA samples for comparison purposes.\n\n\"The devastating impact on so many families and so many people in this community is evident. That is certainly very troubling,\" Brown said.\n\nBrown said the boat was upside down in relatively shallow water with receding tides that were moving the vessel around. A 3,000-foot temporary flight restriction was established around it. Authorities said it was under discussion whether to tow the vessel to shore or examine it on site.\n\nAuthorities opened a Family Assistance Center at the Earl Warren Showgrounds in Santa Barbara for relatives of the victims. In addition to various information and emotional support resources, the center is also offering DNA swabbing for families who believe their relatives are still missing, according to public information officer Amber Anderson.", "description": "The names of the boat's passengers were not made available.
