And from her new perch as digital regulator, she can advance new rules on company behavior, including how they collect, use and store users\u2019 data; and how they shield themselves against cyberattacks.\n\n\u201cConcentration of power is an issue,\u201d said Mr. Vinje, the antitrust lawyer. \u201cThere is an efficiency benefit in having those powers combined in one person, but on the other hand there is always a benefit in debate and division of power, so one can question if this results in too much power.\u201d\n\nIn her regulatory role, Ms. Vestager will be able to propose new legislation, but any law will need to be approved by European Union member states and the European Parliament, meaning her powers will be closely checked.\n\nMs. Vestager will also continue to oversee ongoing investigations, including whether Amazon is unfairly using data from third-party sellers who use its platform to improve its own offerings. Her office has also faced pressure to investigate if Apple is unfairly using its app store to harm competition, and to initiate further inquiry of Google.", "description": "Margrethe Vestager, whose billion-dollar fines have made her loathed by Silicon Valley, has won new powers that give her unrivaled regulatory reach.
