But Mulvaney got a warm reception during a senior staff meeting on Monday morning and sources say many inside the White House are still satisfied with him.\n\n\"Mick Mulvaney\u2019s standing in the White House has not changed. He is still the Acting Chief of Staff and has the President\u2019s confidence,\" White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere said in an email.\n\nOne source familiar with the mood internally said, \"A lot of folks are still really happy with Mick.\"\n\nBut frustration has swelled over some of his public statements that put the White House and its Republican allies in a difficult position in recent days.\n\nMulvaney and White House counsel Pat Cipollone, who is leading the administration\u2019s legal defense against impeachment, are also said to be feuding.\n\nThe firestorm began Thursday when Mulvaney took to the White House briefing room to announce Trump National Doral would host the Group of Seven (G-7) summit next year. He then took questions from reporters about the ongoing impeachment inquiry focused on the president\u2019s request for Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden Joe BidenTrump says he doesn't want NYT in the White House Warren to protest with striking Chicago teachers Schiff punches back after GOP censure resolution fails MORE.\n\nMulvaney said security aid to Ukraine was dependent partly on the country investigating a conspiracy theory undermining the conclusion that Russia interfered in the 2016 election.\n\nGiven multiple chances to clarify, he instead repeated that there were three reasons for holding up the aid while insisting that the Bidens were not involved.\n\n\u201cI have news for everybody: Get over it,\u201d Mulvaney said. \u201cThere's going to be political influence in foreign policy.\u201d\n\nWithin a few hours, Mulvaney issued a statement claiming he had not said what he told reporters and denying the existence of any quid pro quo with Ukraine.\n\nTrump then reversed his decision to host the G-7 at Doral late Saturday, undermining the main reason his chief of staff had faced the press in the first place.\n\nMulvaney attempted to do damage control with an interview on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d but struggled to clean up his remarks without causing new headaches.\n\nMulvaney said Trump \u201cstill considers himself to be in the hospitality business,\u201d a comment that raised eyebrows considering the widespread skepticism about the president\u2019s connections to his business.\n\nMulvaney described two conditions for holding up aid after he had listed three during the press briefing.

I\u2019m very happy working there. Did I have the perfect press conference? No,\u201d Mulvaney said.\n\nTrump has seemed to shy away from questions about his chief of staff in recent days. Trump said he had confidence in Mulvaney shortly after his press conference Thursday, and he told reporters Friday that Mulvaney had \u201cclarified\u201d the issue before pivoting to a discussion about his recent trip to Texas and Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\n\nThere has been little public support for Mulvaney from Trump allies and other members of the administration.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s probably somebody who didn\u2019t know what they were talking about,\u201d Sen.

He has been part of the Cabinet since early 2017, first as director of the Office of Management and Budget and now as acting chief of staff.\n\nThe president tapped him for the role last December following a search to replace John Kelly John Francis KellyMORE that yielded several candidates who publicly turned down the job.

As one of the president\u2019s closest aides and someone involved in the Ukraine dealings, Mulvaney would prove a damaging witness.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he has his own detractors for whatever reason and those people love to pile on,\u201d Nunberg said. \u201cThis is not the time to pile and have a public fight and dispute. This impeachment inquiry is not going anywhere. You will only make it worse.\u201d\n\nJordain Carney contributed", "description": "Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney is finding himself on shaky ground following a pair of public appearances that produced more problems than solutions for his boss, President Trump.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/mulvaneymick_101719getty_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
