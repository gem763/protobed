Tony Peralta, Lucia Hierro, and Bryan Avila, who shared their ideas on art and how their sneaker designs help celebrate Hispanic American culture.\n\nPeralta, who is from New York and of Dominican descent, says that his heritage plays a big role in his artistry. \u201cI represent being Latino and being Dominican, and as far as the artwork that I created goes ... It plays a really big part for me.\u201d\n\nGreenhouse x Adidas Speedfactory AM4 Alsacia \u2014 GREENHOUSE More\n\nPeralta\u2019s shoe, dubbed the AM4 \u201cAlsacia,\u201d features a black upper splashed with red, blue, and yellow paint. It was inspired by a \u201cLechon\u201d mask worn during the Dominican Republic Carnival in February, the Dominican month of independence. The mask itself is depicted on the heel of the shoe.\n\nLos Angeles based Mexican-American designer Bryan Avila is known in the art world as \u201cThe Producer BDB.\u201d His shoe in the collection is the Canvas x Adidas SPEEDFACTORY AM4 Mexico.\n\nIt is inspired by one of Mexico\u2019s most popular exports \u2014 the Agave plant, which is used to make many foods and beverages, including tequila. The plant also has scientific purposes, and is used to study climate change.\n\n\u201cMy artwork is an example of who I am,\u201d Avila tells Yahoo Finance. \u201cI like to document a lot of cultures, a lot of history, especially my own \u2014 Artists like Frieda and Selena, who are Mexican icons, which is something that shows up in my artwork.\u201d\n\nGreenhouse x Adidas Speedfactory AM4 Mexico \u2014 GREENHOUSE More\n\nLucia Hierro hails from New York City and created the SPEEDFACTORY AM4 Platanos shoe design.\n\n\u201c[My heritage] plays a major role. A lot of the work that I make ... it\u2019s just about, about the lens of, of the maker. I think that having grown up in New York, having grown up in a Dominican household, it immediately sets me up to look at the world in a completely different way.\u201d The AM4 features a mixture of yellow and green plantains on the upper of the shoe.\n\nGreenhouse x Adidas Speedfactory AM4 Platanos \u2014 GREENHOUSE More\n\nThe entire collection is assembled in the U.S. and can be found on Footlocker\u2019s Greenhouse app. Each pair retails for for $150.\n\nReggie Wade is a writer for Yahoo Finance.
