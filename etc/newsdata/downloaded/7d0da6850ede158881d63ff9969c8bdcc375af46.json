The five competing companies were selected April to develop prototypes. In spring 2020, the Army will select two companies to move forward to the next phase of development.\n\nThe Army is pursuing an aircraft that is \"capable of achieving and sustaining overmatch against potential competitors and enduring asymmetric threats by closing or mitigating gaps in Army aviation attack and reconnaissance,\" the service said in April.\n\nOnce the Army makes a final decision on a prototype, production could begin in the late 2020s, with fielding of a new attack helicopter expected around 2030.\n\nBell 360 Invictus\n\nBell 360 Invictus. Ryan Pickrell/Business Insider\n\nThe 360 Invictus, based at least in part on Bell's 525 Relentless rather than the company's tilt-rotor technology, has the ability to fly at speeds of more than 180 knots. The company says it has a combat radius of 135 nautical miles with the ability to spend over an hour and a half on station.\n\nThe aircraft is armed with a 20 mm cannon as well as an integrated munitions launcher that allows it to store munitions internally to reduce drag.\n\nL3Harris-AVX FARA CCH\n\nL3Harris-AVX CCH. Ryan Pickrell/Business Insider\n\nThe CCH (compound coaxial helicopter) L3Harris and AVX are bringing to the table features a coaxial rotor and ducted fans for increased performance and speed.\n\nDifferent from other competitors, the CCH has three different configurations for different mission sets.\n\nIn one configuration, the aircraft can carry up to six soldiers in the cabin, something that the company says is expected to appeal to special operators. The helicopter can also be configured to carry up to eight missiles, among other munitions.\n\nThe weapons and seats can also be pulled out for extended-range tanks, giving it the ability to fly much farther than some other aircraft.\n\nSikorsky Raider X\n\nRaider X concept. Ryan Pickrell/Business Insider\n\nThe Sikorsky Raider X is based on the S-97 Raider demonstrator, although it is larger and more advanced.\n\nThe compound coaxial helicopter incorporates X2 technology, which offers incredible speeds of more than 250 knots, far exceeding Army requirements, and the ability to carry out high-altitude operations and low- and high-speed maneuvering, among other capabilities.\n\nLike its competitors, the Raider X offers a kind of open architecture for growth and future upgrades.", "description": "3 of the 5 players have revealed their plans.
