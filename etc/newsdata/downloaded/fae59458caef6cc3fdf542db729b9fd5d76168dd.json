Washington also terminates a 1992 U.S.-EU agreement covering support for Airbus and Boeing. The EU responds by filing a complaint on U.S. aid for Boeing.\n\n2005\n\nThe WTO launches twin probes into public support for Boeing and Airbus after bilateral negotiations fail.\n\n2006\n\nAirbus announces a new A350 jetliner for which it will seek further government loans from host nations.\n\n2009\n\nThe WTO issues an interim ruling that some European aid provided to Airbus violated a ban on export subsidies - a type of aid deemed most harmful and therefore automatically banned.\n\n2010\n\nThe WTO demands a halt to unfair aid for jets including the Airbus A380 superjumbo. It says some government loans for the jet amount to \u201cprohibited\u201d export subsidies. But it rejects a U.S. request to include aid for the newer A350 in the case.\n\n2011\n\nThe EU loses an appeal and is given until December to comply. However the WTO drops its finding that the A380 loans are in the \u201cprohibited\u201d category, softening its earlier ruling.\n\nThe planemakers clash over the scope of the WTO finding. Boeing says the WTO faulted $18 billion of subsidies to Airbus including $15 billion in loans. Airbus says the amount of subsidy embedded in the loans is far smaller, but neither side can publicly back up its claims since details are redacted.\n\nIn the EU\u2019s counter-case alleging $19 billion of support for Boeing from the U.S. government, NASA and various states and municipalities, a separate WTO panel partially backs the EU and rules against aid for Boeing worth at least $5.3 billion.\n\n2012\n\nWTO appeal judges broadly uphold the ruling against U.S. support for Boeing.\n\nBoth sides say they have complied with the WTO\u2019s rulings, while accusing the other side of failing to do so. This latest disagreement kicks off a new compliance phase in the dispute, including appeals, that lasts another six years.\n\n2013\n\nBoeing announces the twin-engined 777X and agrees to build it in Washington state shortly after the local legislature agrees $8.7 billion in new tax breaks.\n\n2014\n\nThe EU opens a second front in the trade battle by launching a separate complaint against the 777X tax breaks granted by Washington state and this time chooses a faster, all-or-nothing approach by targeting them purely as \u201cprohibited\u201d subsidies - without the usual fallback of a second, softer claim.\n\n2016\n\nAfter a year-long lull in the main dispute, the WTO says the EU failed to comply with its earlier rulings on Airbus. It also agrees for the first time to target aid for the new A350 but rejects U.S. calls to put this in the \u201cprohibited\u201d category.\n\nIn November, the WTO rules tax breaks surrounding the development of the Boeing 777X - the subject of the EU\u2019s second case - did fall into the more severe \u201cprohibited\u201d category.\n\n2017\n\nWTO appeal judges reverse the ruling that the 777X tax breaks are in the \u201cprohibited\u201d column, bringing an abrupt halt to the EU\u2019s second case after only two and a half years - a quick turnover by the standards of the main legal battle. The EU\u2019s original case against aid for earlier Boeing projects - including an earlier version of the same tax breaks - continues.\n\nIn that main EU case, the WTO largely clears the United States of maintaining unfair support for Boeing but says it has failed to withdraw the earlier Washington State tax breaks.\n\nThe EU appeals this decision, but the WTO does not change its stance in a follow-on ruling, published the same year.\n\n2018\n\nIn May, the WTO again rules that the EU has failed to halt all subsidies to Airbus and that these continue to harm Boeing. The United States threatens sanctions on billions of dollars of European products. Both sides enter arbitration to determine the scope of tariffs.\n\n2019\n\nIn March, the WTO says the U.S. has again failed to halt subsidized tax breaks to Boeing in Washington state. Once again, the two sides disagree widely in public over the amount of subsidy faulted by the WTO.\n\nIn April, the U.S. issues a list of $21 billion of EU products from which any WTO-approved tariffs could be drawn, ranging from planes to food and handbags, to counteract $11.2 billion of harm it says EU subsidies cause the U.S. each year.\n\nThe EU issues its own $20 billion list of U.S. imports that could face tariffs for damage from U.S. subsidies.\n\nIn June, U.S. sources said they are open to negotiations on an \u201cenforceable mechanism\u201d that could allow Airbus to receive some government funding on commercial terms while addressing the issue of Washington State tax breaks.\n\nBoth sides accuse the other of refusing to negotiate any settlement.\n\nIn July, the U.S. adds $4 billion of items to the basket of products from which any tariffs against the EU could be drawn.\n\nIn September, WTO arbitrators back a U.S. request to impose tariffs on billions of dollars of European goods, according to people familiar with the case, with the scope of sanctions expected to be released in the week starting Sept. 30.\n\nA parallel decision on EU counter-tariffs is due in 2020.", "description": "The European Union and United States have been battling over government subsidies to European planemaker Airbus and U.S. rival Boeing for 15 years in the world's largest ever corporate trade dispute.", "authors": ["Jonas Ekblom", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
