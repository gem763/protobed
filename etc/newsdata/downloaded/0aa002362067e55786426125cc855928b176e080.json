Mahomes sneaked forward on fourth-and-1 against the Denver Broncos. Mahomes got the first down, and in the pile of bodies he suffered a dislocated kneecap.\n\nThe Chiefs kept possession and lost the MVP of the league for the rest of the game, and perhaps longer. The Chiefs will have a definitive answer on Mahomes\u2019 status when more tests are done.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThere were no shortage of people on social media who were expressing outrage over Chiefs coach Andy Reid calling for the face of the franchise \u2014 and arguably the entire NFL \u2014 to burrow under multiple 300-pound men to gain a yard. Mahomes entered the game battling an ankle injury that has limited his mobility for several weeks.\n\nReid, who said the sneak was a called play and not an audible, said he had no regrets.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\n\u201cNot too many people get hurt on sneaks,\u201d Reid said after the Chiefs\u2019 30-6 victory. \u201cIt\u2019s a freak thing. It happens.\u201d\n\nThat may be the fair way to look at it, but it won\u2019t ease the minds of Chiefs fans and fantasy players who watched as Mahomes had his kneecap put back into place on the field.\n\nAre quarterback sneaks unsafe?\n\nStory continues\n\nThere aren\u2019t many documented injuries on QB sneaks. But even a slight risk of having your most important player get hurt in a pile is why some teams don\u2019t run them despite a very high success rate. Between 2007-2017 quarterback sneaks inside the 20-yard lines converted at an 87.5 percent rate, according to Pro Football Focus. Running back carries converted just 68.7 percent of the time. Analytically inclined analysts have complained for years that teams don\u2019t use the sneak enough.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to get a coach to pass on any play that succeeds more than 85 percent of the time, but there\u2019s a reason teams are hesitant. They might be more wary after what happened to Mahomes.\n\nPittsburgh Steelers fans have criticized offensive coordinator Randy Fichtner for not calling more sneaks. Earlier this season, he said it\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t want to expose his quarterback to an injury.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind in certain situations, but when it\u2019s obvious situations \u2014 fourth-and-1, third-and-1 \u2014 it really isn\u2019t something I\u2019m interested in doing,\u201d Fichtner said, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. \u201cI value our quarterback. There\u2019s a lot of stuff going on in those piles. Just the truth be known, if we can\u2019t hand it to one of our backs and we can\u2019t block them, then we don\u2019t deserve to win that down.\u201d\n\nIn the regular-season finale of the 2016 season, Houston Texans quarterback Tom Savage suffered a concussion on a sneak. He couldn\u2019t start a wild-card game against the Oakland Raiders the following week, and Brock Osweiler took his place.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not regretful of that play-call at all,\u201d Texans head coach Bill O\u2019Brien said then, according to the CBS affiliate in Houston. \u201cI just feel bad for [Savage] that it happened, but I think in the end you\u2019re out there to play football, it\u2019s a contact sport, injuries happen. I feel terrible about it but I\u2019m not regretful about it.\u201d\n\nNew England\u2019s Tom Brady has been successful many times on sneaks, and has not suffered a significant injury on one.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as easy as it looks,\u201d Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels said earlier this month, according to the team\u2019s transcripts. \u201cThe first thing I\u2019ve always said to any quarterback that is going to try it is, \u2018You have to be willing to do it.\u2019 There\u2019s an inherent courage and willingness to send your body into a bunch of 300-plus pound men and push and not go to the ground and not lose the ball and have an awareness of where you\u2019re at and also find the sweet spot, which he does a great job of.\u201d\n\n\u2018It was a good call\u2019\n\nRight after what might become the second-most famous quarterback sneak behind Bart Starr in the \u201cIce Bowl,\u201d Chiefs players nervously waved for the athletic trainers to come out for Mahomes. Chiefs guard Laurent Duvernay-Tardif, who has a medical degree, said Mahomes was on the ground saying, \u201cIt\u2019s out, it\u2019s out,\u201d and then they saw what he was talking about.\n\n\u201cI think everybody could have known something was wrong,\u201d Duvernay-Tardif said in the locker room.\n\nThere are no safe plays in the NFL. Every one has an element of danger. There is added risk for the quarterback when he has to sneak forward in a pile of large men for a first down, but that\u2019s football.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s bad luck. It happens,\u201d Duvernay-Tardif said. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen what happened exactly. It\u2019s not a play we\u2019ve been calling that often in that situation, but there was a gap open and it was a good call. It was just bad luck.\u201d\n\nNobody wants Mahomes hurt, of course, but players understand that any play can result in an injury. And, in a blowout victory against the Broncos, it wasn\u2019t lost on Duvernay-Tardif that the sneak worked.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, we converted,\u201d Duvernay-Tardif said. \u201cIt was a good call.\u201d\n\nQuarterback Patrick Mahomes of the Kansas City Chiefs reacts after getting injured on a play during the second quarter against the Denver Broncos.
