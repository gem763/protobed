He had none.\n\nNot if he kept going as he had for the previous decade. Sanders readily conceded that, having run for Vermont governor, twice, and for U.S. Senate, twice, never winning more than 6 percent of the vote, he risked getting stuck on the fringe, perceived as a joke.\n\nThe future presidential candidate was 39 years old and lacked even the beginnings of a career. He drifted from apartment to apartment and ended up having to leave one place because he was so behind on his rent. He had trouble connecting with the people around him. Without a steady job, he drove around the state in his Volkswagen Bug trying to sell teachers the films he had cobbled together about socialist Eugene V. Debs and other radicals.\n\nWhat brought him satisfaction was diving into the battlefield of ideas. He loved to talk about how to improve life in America, and he was good at it. People left his speeches fired up, affirmed.\n\nAs he entered a second decade of campaigning, Sanders wanted another shot at running for governor.\n\nThe Pursuit The second in a series on the 2020 presidential candidates. More stories: Cory Booker and the Orthodox rabbi were like brothers. Now they don\u2019t speak.\n\nNo, his closest political pals said. Richard Sugarman, a philosopher who taught existentialism and Jewish thought at the University of Vermont, joined with three other allies and urged Sanders to give up on fruitless statewide races and target instead a place where he might actually win \u2014 Burlington.\n\nSugarman had run the numbers. Although Sanders never came close in any of his 1970s campaigns, he had pulled double digits \u2014 well, 12 percent \u2014 in the state\u2019s largest city. He had done well in Burlington\u2019s lower-middle-class neighborhoods. People there liked what he had to say.\n\nSanders was blunt: He knew little about city issues, couldn\u2019t see himself as the guy in charge of snow removal.\n\nBut the others insisted that a mayor could focus on matters Sanders cared about: City residents were struggling to make their rent, and nothing was closer to Sanders\u2019s heart than the plight of the ordinary worker. A mayoral campaign could tap Sanders\u2019s passion for preaching about how the rich and powerful were the main obstacle to equality. He could battle the city\u2019s Democratic political machine and big-business leaders.\n\nThey talked through the night. As dawn neared and the workers who lived in the Franklin Square project began trickling in to wash their clothes, the men in the laundry room pressed for an answer. Sanders repeatedly said he wanted to focus on big, systemic change. But he also wanted to break out of his identity as a perennial also-ran.\n\nHe would run for mayor.\n\nHe had one last question for his friends.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell would I do if by some miracle I won?\u201d\n\n\n\nBernie Sanders shooting hoops in Burlington, Vt., in an undated photo. (Burlington Free Press/USA Today Network)\n\n\u2018He never changed\u2019\n\nSanders, a Jewish New Yorker with a thick Brooklyn accent, stood out in a state where many people could trace their roots back hundreds of years. It didn\u2019t help that he was a combative, longhaired intellectual.\n\n\u201cIt took a very long time for Vermonters to accept Bernie,\u201d said Martha Abbott, a longtime friend who ran for governor in 1974 on a ticket with Sanders as a Senate candidate. \u201cHe was such an outsider. For one thing, he was talking too fast. But he never changed. He was so genuine that they eventually accepted him for who he is.\u201d\n\nNearly half a century later, as he mounts his second run for president, Sanders is presenting himself to Democratic voters as a plain-speaking, unpolished change agent whose radical message can connect with frustrated voters \u2014 maybe even those voters who supported Barack Obama but then went for Donald Trump, people who had just had it with politics as usual.\n\n[Listen on Post Reports: Marc Fisher looks at how being mayor of Burlington, Vt. shaped Bernie Sanders\u2019s political career]\n\nSanders declined to speak to The Washington Post for this report. But his history of steering a course between his socialist philosophy and his desire to win \u2014 as well as his record of creating surprising alliances \u2014 suggest that a President Sanders would be less radical than some of his rhetoric may imply.\n\nIn the 1970s, just as today, Sanders wanted to be part of the system he so sharply criticized. Yet even as he moved from an itinerant life among fellow radicals and intellectuals to a position of power working with real estate developers and bureaucrats, Sanders remained an outsider, passionate about ideas but straining to connect with people in the way that comes naturally to many politicians.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s never been a change that I\u2019ve detected in Bernie,\u201d said Terry Bouricius, a longtime Burlington lawyer who lived with Sanders for a time in the late \u201970s and later served on the city council. \u201cHe\u2019s used the same line about millionaires and billionaires for 30 years. It failed, it failed, it failed, and then it just suddenly started working. If the political landscape hadn\u2019t changed under his feet, he\u2019d still be baying at the wind.\u201d\n\n\n\nMayor Bernie Sanders, right, greets voters at a Burlington polling place with Alderman Terry Bouricius in 1983. (Donna Light/AP)\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t follow those rules\u2019\n\nIn 1964, fresh out of the University of Chicago, Sanders and his first wife bought 85 acres of backcountry Vermont woods and a cabin that was off the grid.\n\nWithin a few years, Sanders made the North Country his permanent home, devoting himself to the state\u2019s burgeoning protest movement, centered around opposition to the Vietnam War.\n\nIt was a time of communes, of living off the land, of fighting the powers that were. \u201cIt was like, \u2018We are going to change the world,\u2019 \u201d Bouricius said.\n\nSome Vermont leftists coalesced in 1970 in a nascent third party called Liberty Union. They chose the name, said Abbott, who attended the group\u2019s founding, \u201cbecause it sounded patriotic.\u201d\n\nIn 1971, Sanders showed up at a Liberty Union meeting at which the party was choosing its candidate for U.S. Senate. Nobody else seemed to want to take on the task. Sanders did. He got the nod, simple as that.\n\n\n\nSanders in 1972, when he was running for Vermont governor on the Liberty Union ticket. (AP)\n\nOff he went, making the case against a rigged system, railing against big companies, Wall Street and the political parties that served as their enablers.\n\nThe purpose of that campaign and those that followed was \u201cmainly educational,\u201d said John Franco, who ran for lieutenant governor on the Sanders Liberty Union ticket in 1976. \u201cNobody knew who we were. Standing outside a GE plant in Rutland at shift change, Bernie was introducing me to the workers and nobody knew who he was either.\u201d\n\nSanders slammed Democrats and Republicans alike, telling audiences that major-party candidates \u201ccan\u2019t talk about this, because the people with the money will punish them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t follow those rules,\u201d Sanders would say.\n\nOr many others. The first time fellow activist Greg Guma met Sanders, at a meet-the-candidates event in 1971, Guma asked what in Sanders\u2019s background made him the right man to be senator.\n\n\u201cObviously, you haven\u2019t been listening to me,\u201d Sanders replied, as Guma recalled it. \u201cDo you know what the movement is? Have you read the books? Are you against the war in Vietnam?\u201d\n\nOf course, Guma said, \u201cbut you\u2019re a person, not a movement.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the movement that\u2019s important,\u201d Sanders insisted. \u201cAre you for it?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not only about policy, Guma said: \u201cYou have to prove you\u2019re a basically good person if you want my vote.\u201d\n\nSanders had heard enough: \u201cI don\u2019t want your vote,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe used to say, \u2018He\u2019s a jerk, but he\u2019s our jerk,\u2019 \u201d Guma said.\n\nLiberty Union members couldn\u2019t decide between being a debate society and dedicating themselves to winning elections.\n\nSome members were acolytes of a political philosopher named Murray Bookchin, an anarchist who lived in Burlington and was a pioneer in the U.S. ecology movement. Bookchin saw Sanders as an accommodator \u2014 far too willing to work within the existing system.\n\n\n\nSanders helps clean up trash in Burlington during his time as mayor.

(Rob Swanson/Burlington Free Press/USA Today Network)\n\n\u201cIf socialist he be, he is of the \u2018bread-and-butter\u2019 kind whose preference [is] for \u2018realism\u2019 over ideals,\u201d he wrote in a slashing critique in 1986. Bookchin, who died in 2006, dismissed Sanders\u2019s \u201cunadorned speech and macho manner\u201d and \u201cthe surprising conventionality of his values.\u201d\n\nIn hours-long arguments about Murray vs. Bernie, Bookchin would say, \u201cYou have to break with Bernie because he is a pragmatist,\u201d Guma recalled. \u201cHe felt Bernie was selling out.\u201d\n\nBy 1977, Sanders and some of his friends had had it. They left Liberty Union. \u201cPeople got tired,\u201d Abbott said, \u201cof sitting in meetings debating ideas over and over again.\u201d\n\nIn the years before his mayoral campaign, Sanders seemed to drop out of the political scene, according to several people who were close to him. He spent time on friends\u2019 couches, made films, wrote for leftist papers, taught a bit, did some carpentry and house painting.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember him ever having a job,\u201d Guma said. \u201cBernie felt like a lost soul in that time, a person who didn\u2019t fit in exactly.\u201d\n\nBut Sanders never seemed terribly concerned about his tenuous existence. \u201cHe\u2019d say, \u2018That\u2019s just the way the world is,\u2019 \u201d Bouricius recalled.\n\nOn lazy afternoons in the house they shared on Maple Street, Bouricius would watch \u201cStar Trek\u201d reruns with Sanders\u2019s son, Levi. (Sanders shared custody with the boy\u2019s mother.) Sanders would be in the other room, editing his films, fiddling with his son\u2019s walkie-talkie to find the right sound effect.\n\nSanders once called selling his films a frustrating ordeal. The Debs film was \u201ctechnologically very poor \u2026 but it defended Debs\u2019s life, it defended socialism,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI took it over to Vermont Educational Television. \u2026 I said: \u2018I\u2019m reasonably well known. I\u2019ve run for office 47 times. I hope you will put this on the air.' \u201d\n\nThe station rejected the film as biased, but Sanders kept pushing and prevailed. The story became part of his stump speech, a lesson in doing an end run around the news media, which Sanders saw as fatally addicted to stories of personalities rather than policies.\n\nFriends said Sanders\u2019s aversion to talking about personal matters went well beyond mistrust of reporters.\n\n\u201cI sort of forget that what people see most of the time is someone who is extremely serious, even stern,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cHe\u2019s really fun, self-deprecating. Bernie believes the personal, and especially the way the media personalizes everything, takes away from the power struggle.\u201d\n\nEven people who worked with him for years learned little about Sanders\u2019s family or how he made a living. \u201cI\u2019m on a first-name relationship with him, but it took me 20 years to get there,\u201d said Pat Robins, a Burlington businessman.\n\nWhen he lived with Sanders, Bouricius said, \u201cwe would talk politics. I don\u2019t think he knows anything about my life history.\u201d\n\n\n\nSanders, right, before throwing out the ceremonial first pitch at the Vermont Reds' inaugural game at Centennial Field in 1984.

(Toby Talbot/AP)\n\nA crucial endorsement\n\nIn March 1980, Guma wrote a memo urging fellow members of the Citizens Party, a third party that was considering running candidates in Vermont, to focus on Burlington.\n\nThe city \u201ccan be extremely fertile ground,\u201d Guma wrote. Financial woes, cronyism between the Democratic mayor and business leaders, unrest among youths, soaring rents \u2014 the city\u2019s troubles made it ripe for political upheaval.\n\n\u201cIn a three-way race, even a mayoral candidate might be elected,\u201d he wrote.\n\nSanders was organizing low-income residents of Burlington\u2019s Franklin Square housing project, bringing college students, the elderly and the poor together to press for affordable housing and tenants\u2019 rights.\n\nGuma, then editing an alternative newspaper, planned to run for mayor, but he realized that if leftists had any chance of pulling off an upset, only one of them could be on the ballot.\n\nSome activists urged Guma to be that candidate. They considered Sanders great at reducing complicated topics to plain English, but they saw him as a pragmatist \u2014 and that was no compliment.\n\nGuma and Sanders met to suss out each other\u2019s plans. \u201cBernie said, \u2018I\u2019m running,\u2019 \u201d Bouricius remembered. \u201c \u2018This is not an educational campaign.\u2019 \u201d He was in it to win it, and he needed a clear field.\n\nGuma figured that \u201cif I ran, I\u2019d probably lose my job. The owner of my paper didn\u2019t want me in politics. Bernie didn\u2019t have anything to lose \u2014 no job. And he\u2019s 6-2 and I\u2019m 5-5, and that makes a difference.\u201d\n\nGuma stood down. But his theory about Burlington proved right.\n\nGoing up against the city\u2019s five-term Democratic mayor and a local restaurateur, Sanders won the endorsement of the city police union. His door-to-door campaign \u2014 always telling residents, \u201cWe\u2019re here to listen to complaints\u201d \u2014 got its big boost after he promised a pay raise to the city\u2019s police officers, whose income had been frozen by Burlington\u2019s mayor.\n\n\u201cThat turned him from a fringe candidate to somebody who could actually be mayor,\u201d Guma said. \u201cOnce the police supported him, he couldn\u2019t be a real red.\u201d\n\nSanders slipped into office by 10 votes. He would go on to spend nearly three decades in Congress, in the House and then the Senate, but his four terms at city hall remain his only executive experience.\n\n\n\nRep.

(Maureen Keating/CQ Roll Call/AP)\n\n\u2018Who is this?\u2019\n\nWhen Sanders took office, Burlington\u2019s government and business elites were still dominated by Irish and French Catholic families who had run the city of 38,000 for generations.\n\n\u201cIn the \u201970s, we had free run,\u201d said Robins, who helped shape the city in that time, turning its main shopping street into a pedestrian mall. \u201cThree or four of us ran the place. We were running around buying land. I didn\u2019t pay any attention to Bernie.\u201d\n\nThen came the election of 1981.\n\n\u201cWe wake up and boom \u2014 knock me off a chair,\u201d Robins recalled. \u201cWho is this? What are we talking about here?\u201d\n\nBurlington\u2019s leaders had dismissed Sanders as a flake, an outsider \u2014 \u201ca guy who didn\u2019t even have a job, supported by all these people on communes,\u201d Robins said.\n\nSanders\u2019s win shocked the power brokers into a campaign of obstruction, paralyzing the new mayor. The city council rejected his appointments, down to his choice for personal secretary.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats and Republicans did everything they could to smother Bernie\u2019s administration in the crib,\u201d said Franco, who worked with volunteer economics professors and neighborhood activists to craft a city budget.\n\nThat shadow cabinet of Sanderistas met on Sunday nights at each other\u2019s houses to plan end runs around the bureaucrats who were freezing Sanders out.\n\n\u201cBernie was strongly anti-business-establishment,\u201d said Robins, now 80. \u201cHe had a real chip on his shoulder about it. I was assigned to go after him. We had really difficult meetings with very harsh language.\u201d\n\n\n\nSanders in Burlington with his wife, Jane, in an undated photo. (Burlington Free Press/USA Today Network)\n\nBut Sanders and his volunteer crew forged an unlikely alliance with the Republicans, the minority party on the council. Sanders and the Republicans believed government tended to be corrupt and wasteful. They agreed on lower taxes and more-efficient spending.\n\nThe mayor hung a Soviet flag in his office (to honor Burlington\u2019s sister city in Russia), but \u201cour slogan was to out-Republican the Republicans,\u201d Franco said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a socialist, you had to plow the streets and keep the taxes down or you\u2019re going to be out on your ear. People were shocked by the number of voters who were for Reagan and Bernie.\u201d\n\nWhen Sanders learned that Burlington had allowed a small group of local insurance agents to rotate the city\u2019s business among themselves, he opened the contracts to competitive bidding. The mayor even spoke about transforming Burlington from \u201ca very inefficient government \u2026 into a modern corporation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Republicans said, \u2018Well, yeah!\u2019 \u201d Bouricius recalled. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like Bernie transformed from being an ideologue into being practical. He still sent nasty letters to President Reagan. But he adapted.\u201d\n\nIn that first year, Sanders entered any number of debates thinking he knew who the enemy was. Then he found himself in league with that enemy.\n\n\u201cIt was an education,\u201d Bouricius said, \u201cbecause Bernie had never had personal conversations with millionaires before.\u201d\n\nSanders and the Republicans joined forces to oppose increases in property taxes. When Sanders, an avid baseball fan, brought a minor league team to Burlington, the Republicans couldn\u2019t complain, just as when he recruited People Express airline to fly a Burlington-Newark route, with $19 fares, leading to a boom at the city\u2019s airport.\n\nOver time, Sanders persuaded business leaders to work with him.\n\n\u201cHe got that you had to take care of the potholes,\u201d Robins said. \u201cHe had an agenda, the left equity agenda, but not at the cost of wrecking the city financially.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe correct label for Bernie Sanders,\u201d concluded political scientist W.J. Conroy, author of \u201cBernie Sanders and the Boundaries of Reform,\u201d \u201cmay be pragmatic socialist.\u201d\n\n\n\nSanders in his office at City Hall in 1985. (Donna Light/Newsday/Getty Images)\n\n\u2018Sellout\u2019 or \u2018starry-eyed dreamer\u2019?\n\nSanders gained more leverage after leftists won council seats in 1982. He could finally push his own agenda, a local version of socialism in which the city provided free concerts, subsidized day care and altered zoning rules to require that units be set aside for low-income families.\n\nBut the leftists who had been his base were not necessarily on board with his approach. While he joined them in opposing a waterfront development proposal as a land grab by and for the rich, Sanders then embraced a plan that included a luxury hotel and high-end housing as well as generous park space.\n\n\u201cThe more pure-left people said no, all of the land should be open to all,\u201d Bouricius said. \u201cBernie said we have to make it a wonderful place people can enjoy. Bernie was okay with making it good enough.\u201d\n\nHis old philosophical nemesis, Bookchin, said Sanders had \u201cout-Republicaned the Republicans.\u201d\n\nIn 1983, tensions with some of his longtime supporters intensified when protesters blocked the entrance to a General Electric plant in the city that made Gatling guns, a type of machine gun built for the military.\n\nThe mayor refused to join the protest, arguing that shutting the plant might make protesters feel good but killing union jobs would hurt working people.\n\nWhen Bookchin accused him of being \u201ca publicity man for GE,\u201d Sanders replied that he was standing up for working people: \u201cNot everybody has the luxury of choosing where they are going to work.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe came and supervised the police arresting us,\u201d said Robin Lloyd, a protest organizer. \u201cHe was really about the blossoming of Burlington, making it seem fun to be here.\u201d\n\nSanders had devoted a decade of his life to idealistic but hopeless campaigns. In the 1979 film he made about his socialist hero Debs, actors provide much of the voice-over. But at the end of the film, Sanders takes over the narration to deliver a final quotation from Debs, who ran for president of the United States five times, including once from prison:\n\n\u201cThe little that I am, the little that I am hoping to be, I owe to the Socialist movement. It has given me my ideas and ideals, my principles and convictions, and I would not exchange one of them for all of Rockefeller\u2019s bloodstained dollars.\u201d\n\nSanders would always look like \u201ca starry-eyed dreamer\u201d to many in Burlington, Franco said, even if \u201cthe stalwarts on the ultra-left called him a sellout.\n\n\u201cBut he proved that you can quote Marx and change a tire.\u201d", "description": "The future presidential candidate didn\u2019t want to run for mayor of Burlington, Vt.
