Ennismore now has nine Hoxton properties across Europe and the U.S., alongside the notable Gleneagles golf resort in the Scottish Highlands, a new co-working concept, and several other projects on the horizon.\n\nPenta caught up with the 38-year-old, Indian-born entrepreneur to learn more about what stands out for him in terms of travel, and where he likes to go when he\u2019s home in West London.\n\nMy favorite neighborhood in the world is... tough question\u2014I\u2019ll always have a soft spot for Shoreditch in East London. It\u2019s where it all started for The Hoxton back in the day, and I spent a year doing every role you can imagine in the hotel and restaurant business. Shoreditch is just as much a buzzy and evolving neighborhood now as it was back then. There\u2019s a great energy to it, a tight creative community, and it\u2019s by far one of the most exciting neighborhoods to eat in London\u2014you\u2019ve got Michelin-star spots next to cult street food favorites and old school institutions.\n\nThe one thing in my closet I can't live without is... I\u2019m a sucker for comfort; whether I\u2019m in the office or traveling, you\u2019ll often find me in a hoodie and Nike high tops. Suits are overrated.\n\nIf I were to buy a piece of art, it would be by... I\u2019ve always loved Yoshitomo Nara. Nara\u2019s figures have become instantly recognizable, and his works from the early 2000s are not only my favorite, but considered some of his most important. They would hang beautifully in my living room!\n\nThe best book I\u2019ve read in the last year is\u2026 I don\u2019t get as much time to read as I\u2019d like but I really enjoyed Matt Haig \u2019s How To Stay Alive. It\u2019s extremely thought provoking, yet funny. He\u2019s a brilliant writer. Next on my list is The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F---,by Mark Manson.\n\nA passion of mine that few people know about is... I\u2019m quietly getting into track racing actually, though I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m any good at it. But whenever I get the chance, I will try and rent a car and get on a racetrack. The Porsche Experience Center in L.A. is one of my favorite days out.\n\nThe one trip I\u2019ve taken that I would love to do again\u2026 I would love to go back to the rainforests of Rwanda to see the gorillas. Nothing quite compares like having to stand still as a 350-pound Silverback brushes by you.\n\nThe next destination on my travel itinerary is\u2026 I\u2019m looking forward to really getting under the skin of California, as I\u2019ll be spending more time that way with the opening of The Hoxton, Downtown L.A. in October. L.A. never gets old to me\u2014those West Coast vibes are always a nice change from London! Top of my hit list on this trip is dinner at Bestia\u2013I\u2019ve heard very good things about the truffle cavatelli! In Downtown L.A., I always swing by Bodega to pick up a new pair of kicks (or two).\n\nThe thing that gets me up in the morning is\u2026 my trainer. That\u2019s because he won\u2019t let me sleep past 6:30 a.m. without a phone call.\n\nThe restaurant/bar in my hometown that I love to take a visitor is\u2026 I live in West London and there\u2019s quite a lot going on my way at the moment. Gold in Notting Hill is a new favorite\u2014it\u2019s got stunning interiors, great, simple dishes, and a brilliant natural wine list. As for something a bit more casual, I go to EGGBREAK with my family pretty much every weekend I\u2019m in town. Everyone needs to try their Nutella Stuffed French Toast.\n\nA person who inspired me to do what I do is\u2026 in terms of moving me to delve into the world of hospitality, it\u2019s tricky to pick one specific source of inspiration because it combines so many of my passions ranging from architecture to brand and storytelling. I have also admired Jeff Bezos for his audacity to innovate at scale and disrupt not one but several industries at the same time.\n\nIf I could have a drink with anybody, anywhere, it would be\u2026 I\u2019d love to split a strong drink with Chris Blackwell at The American Bar at Gleneagles and ask him about his vision behind Goldeneye, the Jamaican resort built around novelist Ian Fleming\u2019s former villa and the birthplace of the James Bond books.", "description": "The hotel innovator keeps things casual on either side of the Atlantic", "authors": ["Geoff Nudelman"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-108219/social", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
