He warned of more delays if the Liberals are re-elected.\n\nScheer said Trudeau has not committed to funding the GTA projects, citing the lack of a business plan.\n\n\"Not only is that comical coming from the highest spending prime minister in Canadian history, but there happens to be a business case. They just won't look at it,\" he said.\n\nScheer said a Conservative government would work with the provincial government to get shovels in the ground. The province and the City of Toronto had been at odds over the best course of action for public transit expansion.\n\nInfrastructure 'game changer'\n\nWhen Ontario Premier Doug Ford announced the projects as part of a $28.5 billion package in April, he called the proposed Ontario Line a \"game changer\" that would double the length of what the City of Toronto had envisioned.\n\nCritics raised concerns about the province changing course on several projects already underway, and warned of potential cost overruns, construction delays and the waste of some of the $224 million in public money that already had been spent on the planning and design of transit infrastructure in Toronto.\n\n\"This isn't costing, this is a bunch of scribbles on a map,\" Liberal MP Adam Vaughan, who represents a downtown Toronto riding, told reporters at the time.\n\nThe Ontario Line is estimated to cost $10.9 billion and is scheduled to be complete by 2027, while the Yonge Subway Extension is estimated to cost $5.6 billion and should be operational right after the Ontario Line opens.", "description": "Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer says he would fund two major public transit projects to ease congestion and cut commute times in the Greater Toronto Area.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5307519.1570308456!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/fedelxn-conservatives-20191001.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
