So unlikely it isn't worth contemplating, and it can happen without this result.\n\nLeicester vs Burnley - 14 points vs 12 points mean both are already ahead of United.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nTottenham vs Watford - Spurs are two points better off than the Red Devils, while the Hornets would need six points to even draw level with United.\n\nCrystal Palace vs Manchester City - Both City and Palace are ahead of United.\n\nSheffield United vs Arsenal - United could already be in the relegation zone by Monday night's game but to stay there, the Blades would have to at least a point or lose by one fewer goals than Solskjaer's side.", "description": "Man Utd have suffered their worst start to a season in 30 years but it could get even more unpleasant this weekend", "authors": ["Alex Smith", "Image", "Empics Sport", "Getty Images", "Offside Via Getty Images", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20587287.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Newcastle-United-v-Manchester-United-Premier-League-St-James-Park.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
