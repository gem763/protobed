Trump is running for re-election.\n\n\"Recently, public reports have raised questions about any role you may have played in conveying or reinforcing the president's stark message to the Ukrainian president,\" Cummings, Schiff and Engel wrote in a letter to Pence.\n\nA spokeswoman for Pence said the broad nature of the request showed that it was not \"serious.\"\n\nWhen Pence met with Zelenskiy, the two discussed the $250 million in security assistance that the U.S. Congress had approved but that the Trump administration had not disbursed.\n\nThe investigation could lead to the approval of articles of impeachment - or formal charges - against Trump in the House. A trial on whether to remove him from office would then be held in the U.S. Senate. Republicans who control the Senate have shown little appetite for ousting Trump.\n\nA cache of diplomatic texts Democrats received as part of their impeachment inquiry showed U.S. officials pressured the Ukrainian government to launch investigations that might benefit Trump's personal political agenda in exchange for a meeting of the two countries' leaders.\n\nKurt Volker, who resigned last week as Trump's special envoy to Ukraine, gave the messages to the House committees in a closed-door meeting on Thursday, and the chairmen released them later in the day.\n\nTrump has said Biden and his son are \"corrupt\" but has shown no evidence to back that up. The president on Thursday went a step further in his attacks on Biden when he called on China to investigate the former vice president and his son, who had business interests there.\n\nU.S. senator and former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney said on Friday it was \"wrong and appalling\" for Trump to push other nations to investigate Biden.\n\n\"When the only American citizen President Trump singles out for China's investigation is his political opponent in the midst of the Democratic nomination process, it strains credulity to suggest that it is anything other than politically motivated,\" Romney said on Twitter.\n\nTrump said on Friday he would not tie a much-anticipated trade deal with China to his desire for Beijing to investigate Joe Biden.\n\n\"One thing has nothing to do with the other,\" he said.\n\nBiden leads in most opinion polls among the 19 Democrats seeking the party's nomination. His campaign has blasted Trump's efforts as desperate.\n\nIn a signal of how Kiev will handle investigations being watched in Washington, Ukrainian prosecutors said they would review 15 old probes related to Burisma's founder but added that they were unaware of any evidence of wrongdoing by Biden's son.\n\nThe White House plans to argue that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, must have the full House vote to formally approve an impeachment inquiry, a source familiar with the effort said.\n\nWithout a vote, White House lawyers believe Trump, who has called the impeachment probe a \"hoax,\" can ignore lawmakers' requests, the source said, meaning the federal courts would presumably have to render a decision and potentially slow the march toward impeachment.\n\nA White House letter arguing Pelosi must hold a House vote will probably be sent to Capitol Hill next week, an administration official said.\n\n\u00a9 (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2019.", "description": "U.S. House Democrats on Friday subpoenaed the White House for documents they want to see as part of their impeachment investigation of President Donald Trump.
