Even movies that have or will have brief in-theater runs do not make the cut for Cineplex, which owns Toronto\u2019s Scotiabank Theatre, currently playing movies for the festival.\n\n\u201cThere are hundreds of fantastic films screening as part of this year\u2019s festival and with all those options we asked that our screens feature titles from studios who understand and appreciate the importance of the theatrical release model,\u201d Cineplex spokesperson Sarah Van Lange explained to The Hollywood Reporter. \u201cWe have a strong and longstanding partnership with TIFF and are proud of our role in creating memorable theatrical experiences for festival goers, now and for years to come.\u201d Ellis Jacob, CEO of Cineplex, is on the board of the Toronto International Film Festival, and his company is one of the festival sponsors.\n\nFestival organizers also confirmed the policy, which is new to this year. \u201cCineplex has been a great partner of TIFF\u2019s for many years,\u201d they acknowledged in a statement. \u201cThis year, new restrictions were put in place on our use of their Scotiabank Theatres during the festival. As a result, TIFF scheduled films that do not comply with their traditional theatrical windows in other venues.\u201d Among the Netflix films premiering at TIFF are Dolemite Is My Name, Marriage Story, The Two Popes and The Laundromat, while Amazon is debuting Les Miserables, Honey Boy, The Report, The Aeronauts, and others.", "description": "Cineplex Entertainment says they will not screen Netflix and Amazon movies at the Scotiabank Theater, one of the Toronto Film Festivals industry screening venues.", "authors": ["Halle Kiefer"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/26/9-Dolemite-Netflix.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
