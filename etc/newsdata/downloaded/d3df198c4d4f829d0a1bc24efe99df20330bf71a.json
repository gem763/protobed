USA TODAY\n\nHOUSTON \u2013 If this World Series pitting the Washington Nationals and Houston Astros inspires others to follow their paths to glory, as so often happens in the copycat culture of sports, the route isn\u2019t terribly complicated.\n\nOh, sure, the Astros have had books written to chronicle their drawdown, their buildup and the progressive methods that fueled their subsequent rise to glory, but this borderline dynasty they\u2019ve crafted is largely the result of simple principles the Nationals also follow.\n\nThey want to win. They try to win. And they spare little expense to make it happen.\n\nThe Nationals and Astros aren\u2019t quite atop Major League Baseball\u2019s payroll list; they\u2019ll land somewhere between fourth and sixth with luxury-tax payrolls nearly touching the $200 million mark. But in an industry where efficiency is too often mistaken for excellence, and process perhaps a bit too emphasized over outcome, the Nationals' and Astros\u2019 willingness to pay for premium talent has kept both franchises consistently in the playoff hunt.\n\nPREDICTIONS: Can Nationals upset Astros in World Series?\n\nFALL CLASSIC: Aces give World Series an old-school feel\n\nThe Astros\u2019 gambit to build a dynasty \u2013 three consecutive 100-loss seasons eventually helped yield a bounty of talent \u2013 might have created a monster: Ten major league teams lost at least 90 games this year, many at some point electively choosing mediocrity.\n\nBut the part that often gets left out of the tanking manual is the next episode: Surrounding a core of high draft picks with premium reinforcements.\n\nWith three consecutive 100-win seasons, consider the Astros surrounded.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how rebuilding works,\u201d says Astros ace Justin Verlander, who will start Game 2 of the World Series. \u201cYou can\u2019t rebuild forever. I think that\u2019s what a lot of teams are hiding behind, this rebuilding mantra. You rebuild to a certain point, and then you need to go pay people.\n\n\u201cBecause you\u2019ve got your young talent, the guys who will be the corner pieces for a six, seven-year window hopefully. But you need to supplement that. And you can\u2019t just supplement that with minor league talent here and there. Sometimes, you need to go pay stars, to carry you over that hump.\u201d\n\nPay, the Astros have.\n\nVerlander was the bell cow, his stunning acquisition from Detroit in August 2017 pushing the Astros past the Yankees and on to their first World Series title two months later.\n\nSince then, owner Jim Crane and GM Jeff Luhnow have only continued to make it rain.\n\nFive months after their World Series title, the Astros granted reigning MVP Jose Altuve a seven-year, $163.5 million contract extension, keeping him in Houston through age 34, even though two years and just $13 million remained on Altuve\u2019s original team-friendly deal.\n\nThis past March, they granted third baseman Alex Bregman a five-year, $100 million extension; he will finish no worse than second in MVP voting this season. They also guaranteed Verlander two more years and $66 million, locking him up through his age 38 season.\n\nAnd in the biggest stunner, they traded for another former Cy Young Award winner in July, adding Zack Greinke in a deal that cost them both prospect capital and money \u2013 they\u2019ll pay Greinke more than $25 million each of the next two seasons.\n\nIt\u2019s a significant departure from the narrative that Houston was merely about efficiency experts and decision scientists and young stars like George Springer, Carlos Correa and Bregman who were drafted only because the team was terrible in years past.\n\nThat\u2019s the cost of maintaining a standard of excellence that puts the Astros at the head of a group of near-perennial playoff clubs \u2013 or at least contenders - that includes the Yankees, Dodgers, Red Sox, Cubs, Nationals and Indians.\n\n\u201cEveryone says, \u2018Ah, the Astros lost 100 games and they just drafted high,' \u201d says Bregman, 25 and now signed through 2024. \u201cThey also spent some money. And made some big acquisitions.\n\n\u201cOur ownership, our front office have done an incredible job of putting us in position to win for a long time. They showed that they want to win now. They want to win this year. They want to win next year. They want to win the year after. And they continually go out and acquire big pieces like we did with Verlander, like we did with Greinke, like we did with (outfielder Michael) Brantley. It\u2019s important.\u201d\n\nJose Altuve high-fives Justin Verlander during the ALDS. (Photo: Kim Klement, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThe Nationals can relate.\n\nThey are here largely because of their starting pitching, a group that is guaranteed a staggering $549 million in salary.\n\nStephen Strasburg was drafted first overall in 2009 and retained for $175 million, before reaching free agency.\n\nMax Scherzer, festering on the free agent market after the 2014 season, was snagged for $215 million; he\u2019s won two Cy Youngs with the Nationals and may one day wear their cap in the Hall of Fame.\n\nHis old teammate, Anibal Sanchez, received $19 million over two years.\n\nAnd in an odd sign of the times, lefty Patrick Corbin became a National when the once-profligate Yankees balked at granting him a sixth year.\n\nHe signed with the Nationals for $140 million. The Yankees opted to trade for lefty James Paxton (who earned $8.5 million in 2019) and re-signed J.A. Happ (two years, $34 million).\n\nWhile the Nationals rumbled through the NL playoffs, winning six of eight games, Happ was mired in the Yankees\u2019 bullpen and Paxton twice couldn\u2019t get past the fourth inning in playoff starts. The Yankees have now failed to reach the World Series the past 10 seasons.\n\nCorbin, meanwhile, struck out 238 this season and performed yeoman\u2019s work in both starting and relief roles in the playoffs.\n\n\u201cYou go out and get the best left-handed starting pitcher on the market, and he performs how a really good major league pitcher does,\u201d says Nationals veteran Ryan Zimmerman. \u201cThat\u2019s what you do.\u201d\n\nCorbin, at 30, is in his physical prime. But the Nationals and Astros are fiercely proud of their more advanced-age stars, the Nats \u2013 the oldest team in the majors \u2013 belovedly dubbing their mid-30s posse the Viejos.\n\nZimmerman and Scherzer are 35, NLCS MVP Howie Kendrick is 36. Four of the nine Astros regulars are at least 32, with Verlander at 36.\n\nTheir successes come after consecutive offseasons in which veteran players were frozen out at the expense of younger, cheaper but also unproven players.\n\n\u201cIf someone\u2019s been in the big leagues for 10 or so years and they\u2019re healthy and still able, you can pretty much know what you\u2019re going to get,\u201d says Zimmerman, in the final guaranteed season of a $135 million contract. \u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019re paying for \u2013 the consistency, the mental side of it, you know the person will be able to handle themselves through an entire season.\n\n\u201cBoth of these teams are being rewarded for doing that. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s the only way or right way to do it, but it definitely scores a couple points for the veteran guys.\u201d\n\nVerlander opted to re-up with the Astros rather than hit the market after this season, but he\u2019s been a strident critic of baseball\u2019s free agent decay \u2013 and the hyper-reliance on aging curves and metrics that often sell veteran players short.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just say, \u2018Well this guy produces X (Wins Above Replacement) and this young player who has never been in the big leagues is going to create the same WAR.' They should be equal and we\u2019re going to save money by paying this guy and not this guy,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think it works like that.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we win a championship in \u201917 without Brian McCann and Carlos Beltran. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re here now without a bunch of the leaders we have on this ballclub. I don\u2019t think the Nationals are here without a bunch of their veteran leadership. Now, you sprinkle in the young, exuberant, fun atmosphere and that\u2019s all great and dandy. But I think you need all of it.\u201d\n\nRight now, the Astros have it all, but it may not last forever. Cy Young favorite and Game 1 starter Gerrit Cole \u2013 acquired in trade from the perpetually rebuilding Pirates in 2018 \u2013 is a free agent after this season.\n\nSpringer is a free agent after 2020, Correa after 2021. The Nationals know better than anyone you can\u2019t keep everybody, as Corbin\u2019s signing likely precluded retaining outfielder Bryce Harper.\n\nThe Astros would like to try.\n\n\u201cI hope so,\u201d Correa says of keeping the band together. \u201cI hope so. Why not? The team has been successful three years already, so I don\u2019t see why you\u2019d want to break that.\u201d\n\nThat would require either the Astros sailing over the luxury tax threshold, or wholesale changes to the collective bargaining agreement after 2021 changing the state of play.\n\nFor now, their window remains open, the payoff for their investment in talent \u2013 young and old.\n\n\u201cI know that \u2018Let The Kids Play\u2019 is the thing,\u201d says Bregman, referencing the MLB marketing campaign he\u2019s participated in, \u201cbut there\u2019s some veteran guys in this game that show the kids how to play.\u201d", "description": "While teams throughout Major League Baseball have holdups about spending money, it's no coincidence that the Nationals and Astros are still standing.", "authors": ["Gabe Lacques", "Published A.M.
