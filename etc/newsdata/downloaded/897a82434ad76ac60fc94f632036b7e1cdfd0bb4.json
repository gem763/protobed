The 62-year-old ended up killed, execution style, while seated in his car parked on a Bronx street in 2013\n\nTerrence Caldwell (left) and his associate Christopher Londonio (right), were allegedly ordered to make the hit on Michael Meldish in 2013. Caldwell is accused of being the alleged triggerman, but his lawyer denies his client killed Meldish, whom he was close to\n\nMadonna, 83, served as the Lucchese family's 'street boss' until 2017, when the formal boss Vittorio 'Vic' Amuso \u2014 who's serving out a life sentence for murder \u2014 allegedly appointed Michael DeSantis in his stead.\n\nMadonna and Crea were among 19 accused New York mobsters linked to the Lucchese crime family in a massive FBI bust that same year. They were arrested on charges ranging from illegal sale of cigarettes to murder.\n\nSteven Crea Sr, pictured above, was Madonna's second-in-command. Both the mob boss and Crea are alleged to have ordered the hit on Meldish, who was found shot to death in his car on Ellsworth Avenue in the Throgs Neck section of the Bronx in 2013\n\nThe crimes were committed in connection to a larger racketeering scheme run out of New York and dating back at least 17 years, prosecutors said.\n\nSome in the sweep also were held on charges in relation to Meldish's murder.\n\nThe 62-year-old co-leader of the Purple Gang, who was found with a gunshot wound to his head and with blood leaking from both ears while seated in his car on the night of November 15, 2013, did jobs for the Luccheses.\n\nThe gangster's body was found by a neighbor and her daughter, who spotted the rusty car parked at the side of the street - with its driver's side door hanging open and a motionless man inside.\n\n'We saw a car door and someone's leg hanging out of the car,' retired nurse Janet Forbes testified at Monday's trial, reports the Post.\n\nThe woman, who was driving her car at the time, said she drove around the block and pulled up alongside the vehicle, thinking there might be a drunken driver behind the wheel.\n\n'When I saw him up close he didn't look drunk, he looked dead,' said retired nurse Janet Forbes, recalling when she discovered Meldish shot inside his car on Ellsworth Avenue (pictured above) in the Throgs Neck section of the Bronx in November of 2013\n\n'When I saw him up close he didn't look drunk, he looked dead,' said Forbes.\n\nBesides racketeering, Madonna and his trio of associates are facing charges of extortion, loansharking, illegal gambling and acts of violence, the Post reports.\n\nLondonio is also facing a separate charge for collecting bed sheets while in custody, in what authorities suspect was a plan to use them to climb out of a window at a federal jail.\n\nLawyers for the accused urged the jury to note how the government was to rely on witnesses who turned against the family.\n\n'They have lied, stolen, cheated. They put their own personal interests above all else,' attorney Robert Franklin, who represents Crea, said of those cooperating with prosecutors.\n\nAttorney George Goltzer, who is representing Caldwell, also insisted that his client did not kill Meldish. Both were close friends, and so tight that Meldish even drove Caldwell to chemotherapy treatments, his lawyer said.\n\nCaldwell and Londonio face three life sentences and a number of additional charges in the execution-style death.\n\nMeldish's death at the time was met with celebration from law enforcement officers, who called him a 'stone-cold killer,' believing him to have carried out at least 10 murders on the orders of the Mafia throughout the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nJoseph Coffey, former commanding officer of the NYPD's organized crime homicide task force, said at the time: 'It should have happened a long time ago,' he added. 'I call it vermin killing vermin \u2014 poetic justice.'", "description": "Former acting-Lucchese family crime boss Matthew Madonna, 83, was alleged to have ordered a hit on Michael Meldish, the notorious leader of the Purple Gang who was murdered in 2013.", "authors": ["Ralph R.
