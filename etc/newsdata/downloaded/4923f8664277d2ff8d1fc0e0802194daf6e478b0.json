The boat will carry three research pods equipped with scientific instruments to measure various phenomena such as ocean plastics, mammal behaviour or sea level changes.\n\nIBM has now joined the initiative, and it will supply technical support for all navigation operations.\n\nImage: ProMare\n\nTo avoid obstacles, the ship will be loaded with various sensors - similar to those used for autonomous vehicles - including radar and Lidar as well as automatic identification systems (AIS), which is the conventional tracking system vessels use to exchange their GPS position.\n\nThis will be combined with IBM's Power AI Vision - a data processing technology that blends computer vision and deep learning to identify and track objects both static and moving.\n\nAndy Stanford-Clark, chief technology officer at IBM UK, told ZDNet that the system has been trained for two years on the different types of obstacles in could encounter.\n\n\"Anything solid will cause a reaction from one of the sensors,\" he said. \"And because we have fused various different sensors, we are pretty confident that we will consistently know what's in front of us.\"\n\nWhen objects are detected, MAS will use IBM's operational decision manager (ODM) software, which takes the input and combines it with the rules of navigation that it was taught to decide whether to change its course.\n\n\"ODM will navigate around obstacles but also keep track of the overall mission,\" said Stanford-Clark. \"For example it will remain aware of weather data to avoid dangerous routes and determine the optimal path. It's a rules-based system that lets it make the right decision.\"\n\nAutonomous vessels are a hot topic in the shipping industry, and IBM is not the first tech giant to look into AI-powered naval crews.\n\nIn 2017, for instance, Rolls-Royce announced that it was working with Google to train its AI-based object classification system and improve situational awareness for ships. A year later, it teamed up with Intel to create designs for intelligent shipping systems.\n\nBut if MAS is successful next year, it will be the first ship to complete the ambitious trans-Atlantic trip via a route that was not pre-programmed.\n\nThroughout the journey, data collected will be stored locally and then uploaded to IBM Cloud when satellite connectivity is available. This includes data for maritime research, which is the primary purpose of the mission; but it will also provide operators with feedback on the ship's own performance.\n\nStanford-Clark said that MAS will be a research project in itself, and there is still risk in sending it across the Atlantic; \"we cannot be 100% certain it will work,\" he said. In any case, though, it will provide the team with useful information to improve on the technology.", "description": "The Mayflower Autonomous Ship will use IBM\u2019s servers, AI, cloud and edge technologies to travel from Plymouth, UK, to Plymouth, USA.", "authors": ["Daphne Leprince-Ringuet"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/16/cc55782a-e80b-4eaa-ad06-3fd7cb3446a8/thumbnail/770x578/f5ad8b5eb1ab649423ed88937ede6e3a/mayflower1-jpg-web-e1567152206926.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
