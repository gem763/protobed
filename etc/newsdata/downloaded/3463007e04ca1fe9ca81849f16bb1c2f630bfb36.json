If you're keen to buy one on a plan, there are a lot of options to choose from. Here are all the options from Vodafone, Optus and Telstra! Read more\n\nNew iPhone models\n\nApple will be releasing three new iPhone models, each in a range of capacities. There's the entry-level iPhone 11, the iPhone 11 Pro which comes with a better camera, and the big boi option, AKA the iPhone 11 Pro Max .\n\nThe iPhone 11 will come in a choice of six colours: yellow, green, purple, black, white and red. The Pro and Pro Max will be available in the more traditional gold, space grey and silver as well as midnight green.\n\nHow much will the iPhone 11 range cost in Australia?\n\nImage: Getty Images (modified by Lifehacker)\n\nThe iPhone 11's Australian pricing starts at $1199. That's a big leap from its starting price in America (US$699), but bear in mind that the Aussie exchange rate is kind of sucky right now. The US also adds an after sales tax, whereas GST is included in our RRP.\n\nWith all that said, $1199 is still a lot of money for a supposedly 'entry-level' iPhone. On the plus side, existing iPhone owners will be able to get it from Apple for $849 with a suitable trade-in.\n\nThe iPhone 11 Pro, meanwhile, starts at $1749. (Or $1249 via trade-in.) The iPhone 11 Pro Max will set you back an eye-watering $1899 and up. If you have a device that meets Apple's trade-in criteria, you can bump that down to a slightly more palatable $1399.\n\nIncidentally, these are the first iPhones to nearly break the $2500 price ceiling, with the 512GB Max model coming in at a seriously hefty $2499. Yikes!\n\nHere are the iPhone 11 prices for each available capacity.\n\niPhone 11:\n\n64GB: $1199\n\n256GB: $1279\n\n512GB: $1449(!)\n\niPhone 11 Pro\n\n64GB: $1749\n\n256GB: $1999\n\n512GB: $2349(!)\n\niPhone 11 Pro Max\n\n64GB: $1899\n\n256GB: $2149\n\n512GB: $2499(!)\n\niPhone 11 Australian specifications\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nThe biggest upgrade compared to the iPhone XS is probably the new cameras - you now get a wide and ultra wide sensor in the entry level model and a triple-camera array on the Pro versions thanks to a third telephoto lens. The cameras are further bolstered by Apple's new night mode.\n\nAll three models can shoot in 4K at up to 60 fps and include photog-friendly features like slo-mo capture, time-lapse, cinematic video stabilisation and extended dynamic range. Despite the more powerful cameras, Apple is touting all-day battery life for its new iPhones.\n\nNaturally, the phones are powered by a new CPU (the A13 Bionic chip) and come with the usual bells-and-whistles you'd expect from a new iPhone range.
