But by the U.S. morning, Brent had retreated to $65.75, a gain of 9.2%, as traders gauged how much extra inventory is available to meet the demands of the global economy.\n\nStockpiles of oil world-wide could be released to curtail another threat to the weakening world economy if the disruption in Saudi Arabia is prolonged. The weekend attacks knocked 5.7 million barrels a day off the kingdom\u2019s oil production. That is equivalent to almost 6% of world-wide consumption each day, according to the International Energy Agency. On Sunday, President Trump said he authorized the release of oil, if needed, from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help offset cost increases.\n\n\u201cIf [the disruption] is measured in weeks, it sounds like there\u2019s enough in storage in various locations\u201d in Saudi Arabia for the kingdom to meet its obligations to customers, said Saad Rahim, chief economist at commodity trading house Trafigura. But if the outage lasts more than around four weeks, then Saudi could start to have difficulties and prices are likely to further, he added.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s own stockpiles of oil have fallen in recent years, but remain sufficient to ensure the kingdom\u2019s customers don\u2019t experience shortages provided the disruption is relatively short-lived. The nation holds around 188 million barrels of crude and 97 million barrels of refined-oil products in storage, according to Amarpeet Singh, an analyst at Barclays, enough to cover the country\u2019s exports for around 35 days.\n\nOn top of domestic stockpiles, Saudi Arabia also stores oil close to key consumers in the Americas, Europe and Japan. \u201cA lot of oil is pre-positioned close to the markets where their consumers are based,\u201d said Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity strategy at BNP Paribas .\n\nA key question for energy traders is how much damage has been done to Abqaiq, a massive processing plant at the heart of Saudi Arabia\u2019s energy system that was targeted in Saturday\u2019s attack. The kingdom is racing to restore around one-third of capacity knocked out by the attacks on Abqaiq and on the Khurais oil field by the end of Monday, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\n\u201cThe longer Abqaiq is down, the higher the risk to exports,\u201d Mr. Tchilinguirian said.\n\nMembers of the IEA, including the U.S., are required to hold emergency stocks of oil that could cover 90 days\u2019 worth of lost imports. They can deploy these reserves in unison to avoid an oil shock, as in June 2011, when the U.S. and 27 other countries acted to release 60 million barrels of oil from strategic reserves to drive down prices during disruption caused by the civil war in Libya.\n\nThe U.S. holds around 600 million barrels of oil in reserve and other governments have a further 1.2 billion, said Oswald Clint, a senior analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nAlthough a major oil shortage isn\u2019t imminent, a long outage in Saudi Arabia is likely to keep oil prices elevated. The Daqing oil field in China.

Commercial inventories stand at about 2.9 billion barrels, down from 3.3 billion in 2015 and 2016, Mr. Clint said. This figure used to be higher because of falling demand, he added.\n\nAlthough a major oil shortage isn\u2019t imminent, a long outage in Saudi Arabia is likely to keep oil prices elevated because the market depends on the kingdom to ramp up output in times of crisis. The ability of other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to boost output at short notice has diminished, while shale producers in the U.S. are under pressure from shareholders to show discipline and not over-invest in new production capacity.\n\nHeightened tensions in the Middle East, the falling chances of a rapprochement between the U.S. and Iran, and the vulnerability of Saudi energy infrastructure are also likely to push oil prices higher even if there is enough oil for energy consumers to tap.\n\n\u201cThis is a significant escalation in the region,\u201d said Chris Midgley, director of analytics at S&P Global Platts. \u201cIf you start taking supply out of the biggest producer in the world, that is crucial.\u201d\n\n\u2014Pat Minczseski contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Joe Wallace at Joe.Wallace@wsj.com and Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com", "description": "The world is flush with excess oil, a factor that put a cap on the increase in crude prices following the attacks on the heart of Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil industry.", "authors": ["Joe Wallace", "Caitlin Ostroff", "Joe.Wallace Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107374/social", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
