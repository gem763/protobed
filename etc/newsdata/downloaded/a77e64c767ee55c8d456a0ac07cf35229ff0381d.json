But on Tuesday, Twitter put out a blog post in an attempt to clarify that world leaders, like President Donald Trump, are not above its rules \u2014 at least not \u201centirely.\u201d\n\nIn Tuesday\u2019s blog post, Twitter said that \u201cPresently, direct interactions with fellow public figures, comments on political issues of the day, or foreign policy saber-rattling on economic or military issues are generally not in violation of the Twitter Rules.\u201d\n\nIf a tweet does break the platform rules, Twitter can remove it. If it thinks it\u2019s of public interest, the company can block it out with a gray box that users have to click through in order to see the content.\n\nWe haven\u2019t used this notice yet, but when we do, you will not be able to like, reply, share, or Retweet the Tweet in question. You will still be able to express your opinion with Retweet with Comment. \u2014 Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) October 15, 2019\n\nLast June, Twitter announced that it would begin rolling out a \u201cnotice\u201d over tweets from world leaders and politicians who broke its content policies but Twitter still deemed \u201cin the public interest.\u201d Notably, Twitter hasn\u2019t used that feature even once, according to a tweet from one of the platform\u2019s accounts on Tuesday.\n\nWhat wasn\u2019t clear over the summer was how this notice would affect how other users could engage with the content. Twitter said on Tuesday that if a tweet is blocked out, \u201cyou will not be able to like, reply, share, or Retweet.\u201d But you\u2019ll be able to quote-tweet it in order to \u201cexpress your opinion\u201d or call out the politician in question.\n\nHowever, if a public figure breaks other rules, like promoting terrorism, making violent threats, or posting someone\u2019s private information, Twitter will take an \u201cenforcement action\u201d like a suspension or a ban. Earlier this month, Trump confidant Rudy Giuliani was briefly kicked off the platform for posting a phone number belonging to a Ukrainian official.\n\nStill, it\u2019s remarkable that not a single public figure or politician has violated the rules in a way that was in the \u201cpublic interest\u201d in the three months that the notice policy has been in effect. More Trump Twitter content has been removed by copyright claims than policy violations throughout the span of his presidency.\n\nTuesday\u2019s blog post follows calls from Joe Biden\u2019s presidential campaign sent last week demanding that Facebook and Twitter refuse to run political ads that include false or misleading statements. Biden\u2019s letters were in response to an ad placed on social media by President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection campaign making baseless claims regarding Biden, his son Hunter, and the Ukraine scandal that has dominated the news cycle for the past few weeks.\n\nIn a statement to The Verge last week, a Twitter spokesperson said that the ad in question did not violate its content policies and that it would be responding to the Biden campaign in the future.", "description": "Democrats have been tearing into Facebook and Twitter\u2019s content and ads policies for days, focusing on rules that leave room for inaccurate or abusive language.
