Guest speakers, ranging from volunteer first-aiders to lawyers who provided aid to arrested protesters, also took turns to speak about their experiences.\n\nHong Kong protests: What are the 'five demands'? What do protesters want?\n\nThey described the abuse of power as systemic, and appealed for support from society in calling for the meeting of the five demands as a solution to the political crisis.\n\nOne 14-year-old male student, surnamed Chan said he was there to ask the government to respond to the five demands.\n\n\"Carrie Lam's policy address wasn't a reply. The mortgage loan condition won't help since we won't have the money anyway.\" He said, \"I calculated it and it would take 40 years to pay it back. It's like slavery.\"\n\nAnother pair of female students, surnamed Chan and Lee, were organisers for the rally. Both said it was their first time as organisers for a large-scale event and that their previous experiences were limited to participation.\n\nChan, 18, said the turnout was low but it was to be expected since it was \"quite rushed\". She disagreed with the idea that the slogan \u2018Reclaim Hong Kong, revolution of our times.\u2019 was a pro-independence slogan. Instead, she thought the slogan is a hope for things to return to normal.\n\n\"I want to see Hong Kong returning to a better state. Chan said.\n\n\"A true one country, two systems,\" added Li.\n\nHundreds of teens gathered for the rally at Sun Yat-sen place.
