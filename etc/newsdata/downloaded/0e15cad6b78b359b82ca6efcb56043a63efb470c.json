The 12 pilot areas will be funded from this pot.\n\nMental health minister Nadine Dorries said the plans for a new approach to mental health treatment and \u00a370m of investment in pilot areas would begin a \"step-change\" in provision.\n\nThe pilot areas will cover services in the Humber, Coast and Vale Health and Care Partnership, Frimley Health and Care, and Surrey Heartlands; providers for Cambridge and Peterborough; Hertfordshire and West Essex; north-west London; north-east London; Herefordshire and Worcestershire; Lincolnshire; South Yorkshire and Bassetlaw; Cheshire and Merseyside, and Somerset.\n\nMinisters say the plans will involve a range of mental health issues, including eating disorders and alcohol addiction, psychosis and bipolar disorder.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the start of the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester, Ms Dorries added: \"We know there are many causes behind mental illness - including significant life changes, problems at work or addiction - so it is only right that the NHS brings services together to serve patients in their communities.\"\n\n'Discovered and made in Britain'\n\nMeanwhile, the prime minister has unveiled a \u00a3200m cash injection for the UK's health and life sciences industry. The funding will be matched by \u00a3400m of private investment to allow science companies to expand development plans.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nThis government hopes the investment will allow companies to raise capital to run clinical trials, employ more industrial scientists and boost manufacturing in the UK.\n\nBoris Johnson said it was part of his vision to have a \"vibrant post-Brexit economy fuelled by science and technology\".\n\nHe said: \"The UK has the best universities in the world and we have a proud history of scientific discovery from penicillin to sequencing the human genome. But too often we let another country commercialise this discovery.\n\n\"I want the lifesaving cancer treatments of tomorrow to say 'discovered and made in Britain'. That means allowing enough late stage capital to be mobilised so that these science discoveries do not have to go overseas to be commercialised.\"", "description": "Ministers unveil plans for 40 new hospitals and a new mental health pilot for 12 areas of England.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/B947/production/_109013474_gettyimages-1169033593.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
