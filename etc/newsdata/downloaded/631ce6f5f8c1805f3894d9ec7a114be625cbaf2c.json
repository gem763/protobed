(Picture: Getty)\n\nThe clocks are about to change. Don\u2019t worry it\u2019s the good one \u2013 the one where you get a glorious extra hour in bed.\n\nBut the bad news is that our mornings are about to get even darker. The kind of impenetrable winter darkness that makes you wonder if the sun will ever rise again.\n\nAnd it can make getting out of bed any earlier than absolutely necessary basically impossible. Bad news for your workout schedule.\n\nAs we lose our daylight we often lose our motivation to stay active too. And while hibernation seems appealing, it can really impact your mental and physical health if you\u2019re not doing enough fitness.\n\nAccording to research by health and wellness app, MINDBODY, 55 per cent of people who exercise frequently say they are least motivated to exercise during autumn.\n\n\u2018It is that time of year where temperatures get a lot colder and we get a lot less sunshine,\u2019 explains sports performance mind coach Nick Davies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018This can lead to low mood in some people and a desire to curl up in the warmth of our own homes, meaning the likelihood of going to the gym is a lot less than in warmer months.\u2019\n\nThere are ways to beat the hibernation instinct and stay active all year-round (Picture: Getty)\n\nMarvin Burton, Head of Fitness at Anytime Fitness UK, has shared with us his techniques for keeping your fitness regime firing even as the depths of winter take of hold.\n\nTry home exercise programs\n\nHome workouts help to reduce travel time to the gym.\n\nAdditionally, they aren\u2019t weather dependent and can be cost effective. Investing in home-friendly pieces of equipment such as a kettlebell, medicine ball or Swiss ball offers a great way to introduce physical activity to the start of the day.\n\nSwitch up your schedule\n\nAlthough you may already have a routine, why not swap a midweek workout for a weekend workout to give yourself an additional day of training in the daylight?\n\nTry different forms of exercise\n\nMany athletes and fitness enthusiasts follow summer and winter training programs.\n\nUsually, the winter sessions are resistance (weights) based which typically take up less time and can be performed in a gym.\n\nThis type of exercise also builds and focuses on other areas of strength required for endurance and outdoor events.\n\nIncrease the intensity and reduce your workout time\n\nMany people now use higher intensity exercise, such as HIIT, to reach and maintain their goals.\n\nWorking harder and smarter may help and improve your fitness this winter, allowing you to hit the gym later in the morning and cling onto the daylight a little bit longer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFocus on your nutrition and recovery\n\nWhen it is cold and dark, we usually crave warmer foods and drinks, subsequently meaning we need to make changes to our diets.\n\nDuring the winter it\u2019s likely you\u2019ll need to spend more time cooking and preparing.\n\nWhile you may not have the enthusiasm to get up and hit the gym when the mornings are dark, you could use the time to prepare food, stretch and work on other aspects of your health.\n\nPick a motivational workout playlist The perfect playlist Whether you\u2019re struggling to find the motivation to hit your fitness goals, or you\u2019re in need of a little energy boost mid-cardio, the right music could be the missing ingredient in your workout. \u2018Music is excellent for motivation and can definitely help with endurance during exercise,\u2019 explains Professor Andy Lane, sports psychologist at The University of Wolverhampton. \u2018Listening to music can enhance your mood and help divert your attention away from feeling tired or bored which can often arise through the repetitiveness of certain exercises.\u2019 MINDBODY recently curated a playlist in collaboration with leading studios, full of songs that are most likely to increase motivation during a workout: Pinnacles \u2013 Four Tet\n\nFreaks \u2013 Timmy Trumpet\n\nRun boy Run \u2013 Woodkid\n\nRapture \u2013 Nadia Ali\n\nLosing It \u2013 Fisher\n\nDifferentology \u2013 Bunji Garlin\n\nHigher Ground \u2013 TNGHT\n\nChameleon \u2013 Pnau\n\nPlay \u2013 Jax Jones\n\nOld Friend \u2013 Elderbrook\n\nThe experts at MINDBODY have some additional motivation tips to help you keep on track when it gets cold and dark.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Everyone struggles with their motivation at this time of year, and although it can be difficult, it\u2019s important to remember why you\u2019re on the health and fitness journey, and the goals you want to achieve,\u2019 said a spokesperson.\n\n\u2018If you miss a workout, don\u2019t worry, you\u2019re only human! However, take these motivational tips into consideration and start again the following day.\u2019\n\nWork out with a friend\n\nHaving someone alongside you during a tough workout can go a long way when it comes to motivation.\n\nIn fact, 34 per cent of gym-goers believe having a partner to workout with increases their motivation and makes them work harder. One in four even said it improves the effectiveness of their workout.\n\nChange your alarm\n\nThat early morning alarm is probably up there with the worst sound in the world. But, what if your morning alarm actually made you excited for the day ahead?\n\nChange the boring, painful tune you\u2019re familiar with to something you love.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s your favourite song, or music that makes you feel energised. By doing so, you\u2019ll wake up with a spring in your step.\n\nTry a new class\n\nFrom Pilates to Barre, HIIT, Bootcamp and Spin \u2013 whatever your fitness goals may be, there will be a class suitable for you.\n\nNot only do most classes take place indoors (so you\u2019ll stay nice and warm), but they are also great for your motivation as you\u2019ll be working out alongside other class participants with an encouraging instructor guiding you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecover\n\nIf you\u2019re really struggling to find the motivation to work out, then don\u2019t.\n\nInstead, focus your attention on rest and recovery, which has a whole host of benefits ranging from injury prevention, to minimising fatigue, and reducing stress.\n\nRest and recovery doesn\u2019t necessarily mean staying at home doing nothing. According to MINDBODY data, the recovery trends and treatments growing in popularity this year are:\n\nCryotherapy\n\nWater Therapy\n\nSports Massage\n\nRecovery through Nutrition\n\nRestorative/Yin Yoga\n\nMORE: The workouts you should be doing at each stage of your menstrual cycle\n\nMORE: How to work out (safely) if you\u2019re doing intermittent fasting\n\nMORE: Mixed Up: \u2018Friends tell me I\u2019m not \u201cblack enough\u201d but I won\u2019t change who I am\u2019\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Tips on how to stay active even when the clocks go back and it gets harder to get out of bed.", "authors": ["Natalie Morris"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-541153204_1571832276.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
