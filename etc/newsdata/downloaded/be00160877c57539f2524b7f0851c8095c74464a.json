I've already rolled out the eight that are most intriguing to this value investor, (LiveRamp Holdings (RAMP) , Dril-Quip (DRQ) , Fitbit (FIT) , Astec Industries (ASTE) , Johnson Outdoors (JOUT) , National Presto Industries (NPK) , MarineMax (HZO) , and Crimson Wine Group (CWGL) ) but I'll be tracking all 48.\n\nThe idea is to see whether a passive approach (equal weighting all 48 names) can outperform an active management approach (equally weighting the eight that I selected) for a group of companies trading at relatively low multiples of net current asset value or NCAV. Last year, a passive approach won by a longshot, and considerably outperformed the Russell Microcap Index, which is the most appropriate benchmark in this case.\n\nCompanies are listed in order of market cap, largest to smallest, along with the ratio of price to net current asset value.\n\nEncore Wire Corporation (WIRE) 2.7 Benchmark Electronics, Inc.

One thing is certain: triple-nets (companies trading between 2x and 3x NCAV) are not a common investment hunting ground, and it's a technique that could only be devised by the mind of an off-the-wall deep value investor. But that's how new methodologies are developed. While not all will bear fruit, some may be the recipe for the next ETF.", "description": "One thing is certain: Triple-nets are not a common investment hunting ground, but some may be the recipe for the next ETF....WIRE", "authors": ["Jonathan Heller", "It'S A Wrap", "My Final Triple-Net Stocks", "One Thing Is Certain", "Triple-Nets Are Not A Common Investment Hunting Ground", "But Some May Be The Recipe For The Next Etf.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Bruce Kamich", "Guy Ortmann", "Stephen Guilfoyle"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/yahoo-ipo-16.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
