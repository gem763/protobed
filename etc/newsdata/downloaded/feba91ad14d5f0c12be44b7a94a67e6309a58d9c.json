That friend then helped her commit suicide\n\n'I'm convinced that Tyerell pushed her into it. He manipulated her,' she explained.\n\n'Jchandra was manipulated and brainwashed. I truly believe she wouldn't have taken her life if she hadn't met Tyerell.\n\n'Jchandra thought she'd found a friend, instead she found a monster.'\n\nSue told how, in 2015 when Jchandra was 14, the teenager became withdrawn and revealed she was being bullied and called 'fat' at school.\n\nWhen Jchandra refused to go in for lessons, the worried mother decided to home-school her, before the family relocated from Twin Falls in Idaho to Utah in September 2016.\n\nSue Bryan, 53, from Utah, admitted a part of her died when she lost her daughter and she can 'never forgive' Tyerell Pryzbycien for the role he played in her death\n\nTyerell Przybycien, 19, (seen left in a court appearance in 2017) was sentenced to five years imprisonment in December 2018 for helping Jchandra kill herself by giving her the rope she used to hang herself and filming it on a cell phone afterwards\n\nThis meant they were closer to Sue's two sons and grandchildren, but Jchandra continued to struggle.\n\nBy April the following year, the now 16-year-old would shut herself away in her room and refused to talk to her mum about her problems, insisting she was fine.\n\nJchandra got a job as a waitress, and one night she didn't come home from work - sending Sue into a panic.\n\nBy the time she made it home the following day, Sue recalled how Jchandra was slurring her words and had a wild look in her eye, as if she'd taken drugs.\n\nSue told how, in 2015 when Jchandra was 14, the teenager became withdrawn and revealed she was being bullied and called 'fat' at school. Pictured: Sue and Jchandra together\n\nShortly afterwards she didn't return from work again and Sue reported her missing to the police when she didn't answer her phone.\n\nThe following day, police officers called at Sue's work with the heartbreaking news her daughter had been found dead.\n\nWhen Jchandra refused to go back to school, Sue decided to home-school her\n\nDistraught, Sue said she burst into tears before breaking the news to her family.\n\nIt emerged during Pryzbycien's trial that a month before Jchandra's death, he had sent a friend a message asking what they would do if someone told them they wanted to kill themselves.\n\nThat friend said that they would try to talk the person out of it, to which Przybycien replied: 'The thing is... I wanna help kill them.\n\n'It will be awesome. Seriously I'm going to help her. It's like getting away with murder! I'm seriously not joking.'\n\nAfter Jchandra took her last breath, Przybycien continued filming and then placed the cell phone which contained the footage at her feet, saying: 'I guess I'll leave this here'.\n\nSue told how she was gobsmacked when her lawyer informed her there was a recording of Jchandra's final moments, and the police had arrested the man they believed helped her to plan her death.\n\nDuring the hearing it emerged that Jchandra had confided in Przybycien that she was feeling low. He then pushed her into using drugs.\n\nOn the night of her death, he went for breakfast the following morning with a friend before returning to see Jchandra's body - by which point she'd been found by a turkey hunter.\n\nDuring the hearing it emerged that Jchandra had confided in Przybycien that she was feeling low. He then pushed her into using drugs\n\nInvestigators found a note Przybycien had left next to her which read: 'Watch the video on my phone.'\n\nIn October 2018, Przybycien pleaded guilty to child abuse homicide in a plea deal at Utah District Court, which meant he avoided a life sentence.\n\nProsecutors argued that Pryzbycien should be put away for a considerable amount of time, claiming Jchandra would never have killed herself if he had not intervened.\n\nIn December the judge gave him the lowest possible sentence - five years - at an emotional hearing where he pleaded with Jchandra's family for their forgiveness.\n\nProsecutors argued that Pryzbycien should be put away for a considerable amount of time, claiming Jchandra would never have killed herself if he had not intervened\n\nAfter the hearing Sue gave a heartbreaking statement outside court to say that no jail time would ever be enough because she could never get her daughter back\n\nPrzybycien told the judge: 'I'm also hoping that, although I don't deserve it, the victim's family will be able to forgive me for the immature, thoughtless and rash decision.'\n\nHe was also convicted of sexual exploitation of a minor for having child pornography on a mobile.\n\nAfter the hearing Sue gave a heartbreaking statement outside court to say that no jail time would ever be enough because she could never get her daughter back.\n\n'I'm still overwhelmed. I am missing my daughter. Like I said, there really is no true justice because the only true justice would be having my daughter back in my arms,' she said.\n\nSue said she would have liked to have seen Przybycien put away 'forever' because she doesn't want him to be able to cause pain or havoc to anyone else's family\n\n'You can't bring my daughter back so the sentence to me, I would like to see him be there forever, I'm not going to lie. I don't want him out to cause pain or havoc or anyone else's family.\n\n'I cannot describe to you the pain of losing a child. There are no words. I died when she died.'\n\nSpeaking to Fabulous Digital, Sue said she can never forgive Przybycien for stealing her daughter's life away.\n\nFor confidential support call the Samaritans on 116123 or visit a local Samaritans branch, see www.samaritans.org for details.", "description": "Sue Bryan, 53, from Utah, admitted a part of her died when she lost Jchandra Brown in May 2017.
