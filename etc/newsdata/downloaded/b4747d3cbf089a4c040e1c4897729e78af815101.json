The 2021 forecast was unchanged at 6.0%, according to Ankara\u2019s annual medium-term programme.\n\nInflation is expected to fall briefly to single digits in October before rising toward year-end.\n\nThat, along with a shift to more accommodation among the world\u2019s major central banks, has stemmed further losses in the lira this year and opened the door to a faster recovery in the Middle East\u2019s largest economy.\n\nA Reuters poll last month pointed to zero growth in 2019.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund last week predicted Turkey would log slight growth this year, but said a 1.5% rate over the next couple of years \u201cwould help stabilize the debt burden around the current, commendably low, levels.\u201d\n\nAlbayrak, who is Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s son-in-law, said the budget will be used to finance what he called a production-based transformation of the economy.\n\nBut analysts and investors have been frustrated by what they see as a lack of progress with reforms that would make Turkey\u2019s economy less reliant on foreign capital.\n\n\u201cTurkey can grow at 5% if government pushes stimulus,\u201d said Jason Tuvey, senior emerging markets economist at Capital Economics.\n\n\u201cThe concern is the government pushing more stimulus to achieve 5% is just a recipe of fresh imbalances in economy.\u201d", "description": "Turkey raised its economic growth forecast on Monday to an ambitious 5% for next year, and lowered its inflation outlook to 8.5%, as the government sketched out a relatively quick rebound from recession that manages not to stretch the budget.", "authors": ["Nevzat Devranoglu", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
