Then, place your mouth on top of theirs and breathe out.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve done this once, remove your mouth from theirs and carry out the same process again.\n\nYou should be able to spot chest movement while carrying out the rescue breaths.\n\nIf carrying out CPR on a child, the NHS states that you should initially give five rescue breaths after carrying out the chest compressions.\n\nThen, after repeating the chest compressions, continue the process by giving two rescue breaths.\n\nKeep repeating the chest compressions and rescue breaths until an ambulance arrives or until the person starts regaining consciousness or breathing properly.\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling tired, have someone else take over the CPR, making sure that they\u2019re performing it correctly.\n\nFor more information on CPR, visit the NHS website here.", "description": "If you come across someone who is unresponsive and they don\u2019t seem to be breathing, being able to perform CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation)\u00a0before the emergency services arrive could save their life.", "authors": ["Sabrina Barr"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/10/16/12/cpr-how-to-restart-a-heart-day-main.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
