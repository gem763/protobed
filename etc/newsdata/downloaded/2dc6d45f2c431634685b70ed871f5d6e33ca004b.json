He was singing Day-O, a Jamaican folk song popularised by American civil rights activist Harry Belafonte.\n\nHow did Trudeau respond?\n\nIn Winnipeg on Thursday, the prime minister made his second appearance before reporters since the scandal broke.\n\nHe said: \"Darkening your face, regardless of the context or the circumstances, is always unacceptable because of the racist history of blackface.\n\n\"I should have understood that then and I never should have done it.\"\n\nMr Trudeau said he had let a lot of people down. \"I come to reflect on that and ask for forgiveness.\"\n\nHe said that failing to realise how hurtful his actions were could have resulted from \"a massive blind spot\" due to his privileged background.\n\nMr Trudeau has also been phoning Liberal candidates to apologise for his conduct.\n\nWhat reaction has there been?\n\nDefence Minister Harjit Sajjan, interviewed by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), said what Mr Trudeau did was wrong but pointed to his policies on promoting diversity.\n\nLiberal MP Omar Alghabra told CBC his \"heart sank\" at the images.\n\n\"He's been a champion to combat against the type of pain this picture is causing,\" he said.\n\nThe leader of the opposition Conservatives, Andrew Scheer, speaking on Thursday, dismissed Mr Trudeau's apology as \"not real\".\n\n\"He was specifically asked if there were other instances where he engaged in this type of racist behaviour and he indicated that there was only one other incident and now we know there are at least three.\"\n\nNew Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh, a Sikh, said on Wednesday that the image was \"troubling\" and \"insulting\".\n\nResidents of Toronto approached by the BBC seemed fairly unfazed by controversy.\n\n\"I really don't think it's a big deal,\" one woman said.\n\nBut another woman was disappointed: \"At the same time I recognise that many of us, especially we white people, have to take a hard look at the things we have done in our past that are racist.\"\n\nOne man said: \"It's an awful long time ago. Maybe just look at what he does now instead of what he did when he was in his 20s.\"\n\nBut one Ottawa resident, when asked if she found the images offensive, said: \"I do.\"\n\nMustafa Farooq, executive director of the National Council of Canadian Muslims, said: \"Seeing the prime minister in brownface/blackface is deeply saddening. The wearing of blackface/brownface is reprehensible, and hearkens back to a history of racism and an Orientalist mythology which is unacceptable.\"\n\nThe images have brought a strong response in Canadian media.\n\nThe photos undermine perceptions of who Mr Trudeau \"really is\", a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation commentator says.", "description": "Canada's PM Justin Trudeau is dogged by revelations he wore blackface as he fights for a further term.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07nt5h8.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
