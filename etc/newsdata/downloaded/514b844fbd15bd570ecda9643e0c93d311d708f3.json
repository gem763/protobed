But in recent weeks, the song has also been the subject of controversy after a group of songwriters publicly claimed that \"Truth Hurts\" plagiarized parts of another song they helped write.\n\nThe 31-year-old singer responded to the allegations in an Instagram post on Wednesday, denying that the men seeking credit had anything to do with the song.\n\n\"The men who now claim a piece of Truth Hurts did not help me write any part of the song. They had nothing to do with the line or how I chose to sing it,\" Lizzo wrote. \"There was no one in the room when I wrote Truth Hurts, except me, Ricky Reed, and my tears. That song is my life, and its words are my truth.\"\n\nLizzo also acknowledged that a tweet written by a British artist known as Mina Lioness in 2017 helped inspire the song, adding that she would share songwriting credit with her.", "description": "In recent weeks, the song has been the subject of controversy after a group of songwriters publicly claimed that \"Truth Hurts\" plagiarized parts of another song they helped write.", "authors": ["Harmeet Kaur"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191008145350-lizzo-radio-city-music-hall-trnd-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
