( AZO ) . During the Mad Money program Friday night Jim Cramer said he was a buyer of AutoZone on any weakness.\n\nLet's check out the charts of AZO to see if we have the right parts.\n\nIn the daily bar chart of AZO, below, we can see that prices are not what you might find in the dollar store. AZO has managed to rally from $720 back in October to the $1,170 area in July and September. Prices could continue up into the stratosphere but we need to point out a number of divergences.\n\nThe slope of the 50-day moving average line is nearly flat and while prices are above the line they spent August below it. The twin peaks in July and September could qualify as a double top pattern but we will need a decline below $1,050 to complete the picture.\n\nThe On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has been moving sideways from April and diverging from the price action. The level of the trading volume has also diverged from the price action. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator has been making lower peaks from April even though prices have made higher highs.\n\nIn the weekly bar chart of AZO, below, we can see a strong uptrend from a low in the middle of 2017. Prices have more than doubled. AZO is above the rising 40-week moving average line.\n\nThe weekly OBV line shows a peak in April of this year and then diverges from the price action. The MACD oscillator turns lower in July for a take profits sell signal.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of AZO, below, we can see a potential upside price target of $1,241 but we also need a trade at $1,195.66 to refresh the uptrend. A decline to $1,126.37 will start to weaken the chart.\n\nBottom line strategy: I have no special knowledge of the upcoming earnings' numbers for AZO but a number of bearish divergences are telling me to be cautious with new positions.", "description": "AutoZone Shows Bearish Divergences Ahead of Earnings...AZO", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Autozone Shows Bearish Divergences Ahead Of Earnings", "Be Cautious About 'Getting In The Zone.'", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Bob Lang", "Timothy Collins", "Stephen Guilfoyle", "Jonathan Heller", "Carolyn Boroden", "Doug Kass"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/0667f53f-47e1-11e8-a89a-bbfe7b3e45df.png", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
