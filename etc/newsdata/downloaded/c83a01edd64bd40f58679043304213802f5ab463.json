These include his grandiose claims, his practice of sowing confusion, his demand for absolute loyalty, his tendency to lie and create alternative \u201cfacts\u201d and realities, his shunning and belittling of critics and ex-believers, and his cultivating of an \u201cus versus them\u201d mindset. These are the same methods used by Moon, Jones, and other cult leaders such as L. Ron Hubbard (Scientology), David Koresh (Branch Davidians), Lyndon LaRouche (LaRouche PAC), and, most recently, convicted trafficking felon Keith Raniere (NXVIM).\n\nOf all these tactics, the \u201cus versus them\u201d mindset is probably one of the most effective. From the moment you are recruited into a cult, you are made to feel special, part of an \u201cinside\u201d group in opposition to unenlightened, unbelieving, dangerous \u201coutsiders.\u201d Playing on ancient human tribal tendencies, cult leaders extend this \u201cus versus them\u201d mindset outwards to an almost cosmic struggle.\n\nMany campaigns\u2014political, military, athletic\u2014pivot around the idea of conflict between parties. Even in literature there is a hero and a villain. But cults take this human habit of viewing the world in binary terms and infuse it with a kind of all consuming passion, which they reinforce in the minds of followers using cliches, platitudes, lies, and endless repetitions. You come to believe that you are superior to the rest of the world.", "description": "", "authors": ["Steven Hassan", "Thedailybeast.Com Take-It-From-A-Former-Moonie-Trump-Is-A-Cult-Leader"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
