I'm shopping local now\n\nParis, France has long-endured as a global fashion hub through the most controversial and traumatic of political eras (so every year then), serving as post-conflict optimism every time. And not much has changed since then, except for the way we consume conversations about the cloth. Conscious consumerism has defined a new moment for the industry, where the race to be the most 'understanding and open-minded' is prevalent on almost every runway.\n\nAlthough well-meaning more often than not, we can't help but make the observation that \"in today's mediatised world, the announcement is already the accomplishment,\" to use Angelo Flaccavento's words with regards to fashion going green in his verdict on PFW published on the Business of Fashion.\n\nREAD MORE: Save the planet, but make it fashion: SA Fashion Week commits to a sustainable fashion 5-year plan\n\nBut even with that said, there was an unavoidable quirk and festive whim about this Paris Fashion Week. It was almost as if designers were indeed trying to provide some form of post-economic depression catharsis similar to what I mentioned above - the same kind that birthed the flapper dresses of the roaring twenties in all their consumerist glory.\n\nSo amid 2019's threatening climate concerns, spiking gender-based violence numbers, and continued political unrest, fashion taking itself less seriously than usual is a welcome breakaway from the grim reality of the daily news cycle. Even briefly so.\n\nYes, even the Chanel runway prankster and her two seconds of infamy, was a welcome laugh.\n\nREAD MORE: From Cardi B's fully covered look to memorable model walks - these are the top quirks that came out of this fashion month\n\nHere are five runway moments that presented historic references, optimism and the (fun)damentals of fashion:\n\nGiambattista Valli revamps the flower crown\n\nIssey Miyake sparks joy in bouncing pleats\n\nBalenciaga brings their strange, but refreshing IG feed on the runway\n\nThom Browne says \"let them eat cake\"\n\nLacoste brightens up the tennis court even in rainy weather\n\nImages: Getty\n\nSign up to W24\u2019s newsletters so you don't miss out on any of our stories and giveaways.", "description": "We saw the unexpected resurgence of flower crowns, prankster stunts, and eco-friendly runways that would make Greta Thunberg's heart dance the same way the Issey Miyake models did.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9432/ab4684293fd6467f9b65d280e554144d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
