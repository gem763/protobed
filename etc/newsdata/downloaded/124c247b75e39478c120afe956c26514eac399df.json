Solid connectivity was a challenge, dropouts were infuriatingly common and battery life was woeful.\n\nBut they all offered that taste of freedom from wires that is like a ratchet \u2013 once you\u2019ve experienced tangle-free listening, you\u2019ll never go back.\n\nNow there are loads of truly wireless earbuds on the market offering all sorts of features, designs and sound. None of them are bargain basement, and it\u2019s difficult to know which ones are worth buying. So here\u2019s a guide to separate the wheat from the chaff.\n\nThis Guardian buyer\u2019s guide to true wireless earbuds was last updated on 26 September, and represents the best available models at the time. As new models are released and tested, this guide will be updated to help you choose the right earbuds for you.\n\nQ&A What is a buyer's guide?

More information.\n\nNailing the combination of connectivity, sound, in-ear comfort, controls and case size has proved far more difficult for truly wireless earbuds than you might expect. Thankfully Samsung has managed it on the third try.\n\nThe Galaxy Buds are small, light and comfortable earbuds, with a traditional silicone tip on one end and a small body that sits within your concha, even if you have fairly small ears, allowing you to completely forget about them. They come with a series of soft stabilising wings if you need them, but stay put perfectly fine without them.\n\nA touchpad on the outside takes care of controls. Tap to pause or play, double and triple-tap to skip track. A touch and hold gesture can be switched between turning on or temporarily piping ambient sound into the earbuds, triggering your voice assistant or to change the volume (left to go down, right to turn it up). Take both earbuds out and the music automatically pauses. It all works very well, although I wish you could trigger ambient sound on pause.\n\nThe Galaxy Buds sound pretty good too, with reasonable sound isolation and a well-rounded tone most will like. They\u2019re fairly balanced, not overly dominated by bass or treble, with good separation and punch where needed. The buds are capable of uncomfortable volume levels when cranked right up and there\u2019s a limited EQ available in the Galaxy Wearable app. Audiophiles might turn their noses up, but they sound good compared with the competition at this price.\n\nBluetooth connectivity between the buds and to the phone is rock solid, regardless of whether you\u2019re using a Samsung or other phone. They can be used as a stereo pair, individually and hot-swapped between left and right in mono without skipping a beat, even when on a call \u2013 something only Apple\u2019s AirPods have been capable of until now. The Galaxy Buds support AAC and Samsung\u2019s proprietary scalable codec for high-quality music, with no noticeable lipsync issues even when connected to a non-Samsung device. Call quality is good, but a little distant similar to when you\u2019re on speaker phone.\n\nEven the case is really good. It flips open and closed with a satisfying snap, is small enough to fit in the money pocket of a pair of jeans and provides just over one full charge of the earbuds. Combined that means the Galaxy Buds will last up to six hours of continuous playback with an additional seven hours in the case. In practice that means having to charge them once a week for the commute via the USB-C port or even wireless charging on any Qi-compatible pad or phone.\n\nPairing with an Android phone with Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Wearable app installed is as easy as opening them up and waiting for the prompt. Everything else needs a quick trip into the settings menu like any other Bluetooth device. They worked well with various Android phones, PCs, iPads and iPhones.\n\nWhen paired with an Android phone you can also get the Galaxy Buds to read out notifications, which is far more useful than it sounds; if you limit the number of apps, that can interrupt your music to just a few. There\u2019s no iOS app for changing settings, which means you need at least one Android, PC or Mac in your life to make sure they\u2019re up to date.\n\nWhy should I buy them?\n\nThe Galaxy Buds offer the best combination of sound, connectivity, size, comfort case and price, making them the ones to buy for Android unless you don\u2019t like canal-buds.\n\nBuy if: you want a simple set of truly wireless earbuds that just work\n\nDon\u2019t buy if: you only use iOS or don\u2019t like canal-buds\n\nBest sounding: Sony WF-1000XM3\n\nRRP: \u00a3220 / $230\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Brilliant sound, excellent noise cancelling and solid battery life make for a cracking set of true wireless earbuds.

The WF-1000XM3 finally live up to the Sony heritage with not only effective noise cancelling but truly great sound too.\n\nThe M3 part of the name aligns them with Sony\u2019s excellent WH-1000XM3 headphones, which have class-leading sound and noise cancelling. The true wireless earbud version inherits the same noise cancelling chip and are almost as effective, reducing or eliminating train, road and plane noise, leaving you free to listen to your music at lower, more comfortable volumes.\n\nThe sound sparkles with detail, energy and clarity, while punchy bass produces a lovely full sound, just edging out the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless.\n\nBluetooth 5 means connectivity is strong and lipsync issues have been eliminated. While the design is attractive, particularly in the black and copper colour, the earbuds are massive and took a bit of trial and error to get the fit right with the correct earbud tip (seven pairs are included). Controls are good, but lack volume on the earbud. Touch and hold one to activate ambient passthrough to listen out for announcements.\n\nBattery life is solid too, lasting up to six hours with noise cancelling active or eight with it off, and up to 32 hours with trips in the case. Like the earbuds the case is also fairly large and difficult to pocket. They\u2019re not cheap, but if you want genuinely great sound, the WF-1000XM3 are the ones to buy.\n\nWhy should you buy them?\n\nBrilliant sound, excellent noise cancelling and solid connectivity, complemented by solid battery life and an attractive design, the WF-1000XM3 are the best-sounding true wireless earbuds yet.\n\nBuy if: you want the best sound and great noise cancelling\n\nDon\u2019t but if: you want something smaller and more pocket-friendly\n\nBest non-isolating: Apple AirPods 2\n\nRRP: \u00a3159 or \u00a3199 / $159 or $199\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Apple\u2019s AirPods are some of the most popular wireless earbuds and for good reason. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\n\nThese regularly updated deals have been sourced through a third-party price comparison service. The Guardian may make a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase. More information.\n\nIf you don\u2019t like blocking out the world, or can\u2019t get on with canal-bud style earphones that enter your ear, look no further than Apple\u2019s AirPods, now in their second generation.\n\nThey gently rest in your ear with little white stalks sticking down, projecting the sound down your ear holes rather than sitting directly in them. As a consequence you can hear everything happening around you meaning you won\u2019t be able to hear your music on something as loud as the tube in London, and if cranked up to maximum they bleed sound, although not as badly as Apple\u2019s non-wireless EarPods. They sound pretty good considering the lack of isolation, with reasonable bass and clarity.\n\nThe AirPods work best with Apple gear, automatically syncing pairing across any Apple devices you might have, but can also be paired with Android or other devices. Connectivity is rock solid with an iPhone and recent Android devices and PCs.\n\nWhere they fall down is on-board controls - there\u2019s basically just one, a double tap. When connected to a non-iPhone it pauses or plays music. Hooked up to an iOS device you have the option to trigger Siri, pause or skip track on each earbud, which means one can summon Siri while the other pauses. There\u2019s no volume control. Take them out and it pauses the music.\n\nWith the second generation AirPods you can also just say \u201cHey Siri\u201d at any time without having to tap anything to activate Apple\u2019s voice assistant. After having to re-teach Siri to recognise my voice, it generally worked well, even with music blasting out. But Siri can be a little slow, particularly when you have poor connectivity on your smartphone. You also get odd looks doing so on public transport.\n\nThe AirPods\u2019 other strengths are that you can use either of the earbuds in mono, call quality is pretty good, and the charging case is the best in the business. The AirPods last about five hours of music and can be fully charged around five times by the case, which itself is charged via a Lightning cable. They are also available with a new wireless charging case (\u00a340/$40 extra) for powering up on Qi-compatible chargers.\n\nWhy should I buy them?\n\nSeamless connectivity with Apple products is key, but they sound pretty good, have an excellent case and are a decent alternative to canal-buds, even for Android users\n\nBuy if: you use Apple products and don\u2019t need sound isolation\n\nDon\u2019t buy if: you want to block out the sounds outside world\n\nBest for size: Earin M-2\n\nRRP: \u00a3219 / $249\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Earin\u2019s second-generation truly wireless earbuds are tiny, with solid sound and connectivity. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\n\nIf you want the smallest, most discreet wireless earbuds available, the Earin M-2 deliver. These tiny earbuds sit within your ear with only a flat touch-sensitive surface visible.\n\nAvailable in black or white, they\u2019re light and easy to forget you\u2019re wearing them. They produce a balanced, relatively flat sound with good treble and fairly crisp highs. Those looking for pumping bass or truly sparkling audio will have to look elsewhere, but they make a good go of most music genres.\n\nAn Android or iOS app sorts updates, and tweaks transparency settings, but there are no equaliser settings.\n\nNoise isolation is good but not great. The M-2s can feed ambient sound in when the music pauses, but it sounds like you\u2019re listening to the world down an old phone line - fine for listening to an announcement but it takes some getting used to.\n\nUnusually, there\u2019s no left or right earbud. They can be inserted in either ear with the buds working out which way round they are, and either can be used on its own for mono listening. They support AAC and aptX, and maintain a stable connection to your phone and between the earbuds, which communicate via magnetic induction, not Bluetooth. The result is lag and lipsync issue-free audio. Call quality is good, but a little quiet, meaning you\u2019ll have to speak up, and there\u2019s no sidetone, so it\u2019s difficult to know how loud you\u2019re talking.\n\nTap once to pause, twice to skip track or tap and hold to invoke Google Assistant or Siri on either bud. The controls work well, but there\u2019s no volume control at all, so you\u2019ll have to reach for your phone for that.\n\nThey last a good three hours of constant playback and charge about three times in the cylindrical aluminium case, which slides open and shut with a satisfying clunk.\n\nWhy should you buy them?\n\nIf you want your truly wireless earbuds to be as small as possible, but still have good sound, great connectivity and a good case, the Earin M-2 are it.\n\nBuy if: you want the the smallest of truly wireless earbuds\n\nDon\u2019t buy if: you want a smaller case or better sound\n\nBest for sport: Beats PowerBeats Pro\n\nRRP: \u00a3219.95 / $249.95\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Unshakeable attachment to your ear, good sound, long battery life, excellent connectivity and proper volume controls make these Beats a winner.

The Guardian may make a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase. More information.\n\nIf you wish Apple\u2019s AirPods had better isolation and gripped on to your ear like a vice, look no further than the Beats PowerBeats Pro.\n\nLike the AirPods the PowerBeats Pro have great connectivity with an iPhone, which courtesy of the Beats app even extends to Android. Rock solid connectivity in all conditions is paired with excellent controls. Both earbuds have proper volume rocker controls, plus a multifunction button for controlling playback, skipping tracks or activating Siri or Google Assistant.\n\nThe flexible ear hook loops over the back of your ear and with a bit of adjustment holds them firmly in place on your head - no amount of jumping, giggling or pounding the tarmac is going to shake these free. They\u2019re also sweat resistant so will be fine in the rain or hard workout; just don\u2019t run them under a tap.\n\nThe silicone earbud tip offers some isolation from the world around you. The forward, energetic sound is ideal for powering through a run or gym session, while also doing a good job with most music genres, banishing the all-bass Beats sound profile to the history books.\n\nCall quality is excellent too, while battery life is a class-leading eight hours with another 1.5 charges in the case.\n\nThe enormous case is the worst thing about them. It\u2019s robust and works just fine, but you\u2019re not going to be able to fit it in a pocket. They\u2019re also pricy, so if you just want basic buds for the gym, these aren\u2019t for you.\n\nWhy should you buy them?\n\nYou want the AirPod-like convenience of connectivity and features with an iPhone (or Android with app), with class-leading battery, good sound, excellent controls including a real volume rocker, plus an ear hook design that\u2019s unshakeable.\n\nBuy if: you want rock-solid all-rounders that won\u2019t come off no matter what you do\n\nDon\u2019t but if: you want something smaller and cheaper\n\nBest budget option: Creative Outlier Air\n\nRRP: \u00a369.99 / $79.99\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Good sound, long battery life and solid connection make the Creative Outlier Air great for the money. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\n\nCreative, known for PC soundcards and MP3 players from the 90s and 2000s and now gaming headsets and headphones, produces some of the best value true wireless earbuds around.\n\nThe Creative Outlier Air (also available in a more expensive \u201cgold\u201d variant) manage to tick almost every box. They\u2019re light and comfortable to wear for extended periods, with a kidney shape that keeps most of the hard plastic body away from the fleshy bits of your ears. A traditional silicone earbud tip holds it in place fairly well, but only two sets are included in the box, meaning you might need to buy some extra ones if it doesn\u2019t make a good enough seal.\n\nThey have excellent connectivity with Bluetooth 5, SBC, AAC and aptX support, can be used independently and best of all last up to 10 hours between trips in the case, which is about double the average battery life of most true wireless earbuds.\n\nThe case is fairly big, but is light, just about pocketable and holds two full charges of the earbuds, making up to 30 hours before needing to be topped up by USB-C.\n\nThe Outlier Air sound surprisingly good for the money too, producing well-rounded audio with punch in the bass (once you get a good seal at least) and good clarity in the mids and highs. They won\u2019t touch the best-sounding, but they are a cut above the competition at this price and will even give the likes of the Galaxy Buds and AirPods a run for their money.\n\nA button on either bud takes care of playback and volume control, which is a bit stiff, requiring you to grip the bud with your index finger and press the button with your thumb. Press once to pause/play, twice on the left to skip back or on the right to skip forward. Pressing and holding on the left turns the volume down or on the right turns the volume up.\n\nCall quality is surprisingly good, with only a little bit of background noise audible by the recipient while speaking. The earbuds are also IPX5 sweat-proof so fine for a run or similar. Small niggles include poor selection of earbud tips, a slight hiss on pause and hints of lipsync issues with Amazon Prime Video and YouTube.\n\nWhy should you buy them?\n\nGreat sound, connectivity and long battery life, plus solid controls including volume, combine with an OK case to make some excellent value true wireless earbuds.\n\nBuy if: you want great-sounding truly wireless earbuds on a budget\n\nDon\u2019t buy if: you want a small case (buy the Anker Liberty Air instead)\n\nQuick guide Truly wireless earbud jargon Show Hide What are truly wireless earbuds? There are many different types of wireless Bluetooth headphones, but the newest and neatest are the truly wireless earbuds.\n\nUnlike neckband earphones or regular Bluetooth earbuds, truly wireless earbuds have no cables connecting between them, freeing the wearer of all cords and cables. Connectivity Removing all cables means transmitting audio and data between them through your head, which is not an easy task. Many early versions could not maintain a solid connection and therefore had frequent, annoying dropouts. Bluetooth codec support A codec is the system used to transmit the audio signal over the Bluetooth connection which both the phone and headphones must support. There are a variety of codecs available for Bluetooth headphones, with SBC being the default, which is the lowest quality and supported by all Bluetooth audio devices. AAC is an upgrade that most support, with Sony's LDAC and Qualcomm's aptX, aptX HD, aptX Low Latency and the newest aptX Adaptive supported by some. Apple's iPhone notably does not support Bluetooth codecs higher than AAC, but many Android smartphones and newer Bluetooth headphones support at least aptX. Latency Along with variances in audio quality, different codecs have different latency in their transmission of sound. Latency is the time it takes for a sound to be sent to the earphone and be played, which is important because if it is too high the audio track does not match up with video, leading to irritating lipsync issues. Most headphones that only support SBC will have lipsync issues, while AAC and higher can help negate the problem. Ambient sound Some earbuds have the ability to play sounds from the outside world picked up by microphones through the speakers, providing an awareness of what's happening in the world through the earbuds. Some automatically activate ambient sound on pause, while others can mix it with music or have dedicated modes for listening out for announcements or similar. Battery life Each earbud has to have a battery in it, therefore to squeeze everything into a small enough package to fit in your ear has mean small batteries and fairly short runtimes. But they are not all born equally with some lasting as much as five hours between charges. Case Short battery life and lack of wires means most truly wireless earbuds come with a charging case with an integrated battery to keep the earbuds safe and topped up. Some charging cases are huge and heavy, others small and light - important to note if you want to carry it in your pocket. Fit Most will have a canal-bud design with an ear tip of varying sizes that enters the ear canal. Alongside the tip many have wings or a body design that is intended to lock into the hollow next to the ear canal called the concha to hold it in place. Here is where the most comfort problems arise, as too much pressure on the soft bits of the ear around the concha will cause pain.\n\nRunners up\n\nThese truly wireless earbuds are still worth buying, if the top five don\u2019t fit the bill.\n\nAnker Soundcore Liberty Air\n\nRRP: \u00a379.99 / $79.99\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Anker Soundcore Liberty Air\n\nAnker\u2019s AirPod-like true wireless earbuds are second only to the Creative Outlier Air as the best budget option. They have good but not great sound, solid connectivity and AAC support in a light and comfortable earbud design with stalks.\n\nControls are basic, with no volume control, but call quality is excellent and the case is one of the smaller and easier to pocket variety. You\u2019ll get four hours out of the earbuds and an extra three charges in the case.\n\nAnker Soundcore Liberty Neo\n\nRRP: \u00a359.99 / $49.99\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Anker Soundcore Liberty Lite\n\nAnker\u2019s smaller true wireless earbuds are an excellent budget option, but have a larger case and are bettered on sound and call quality by the Liberty Air. They can be found for slightly cheaper and don\u2019t have the AirPod-like stalk design, so are still worth buying if the price or earbud design suits you better. Not good for phone calls though.\n\nThese regularly updated deals have been sourced through a third-party price comparison service.

They last just under four hours\u2019 playtime, with two full charges in the case, which itself is charged via USB-C or Qi wireless charging. Touch panels on each earbud take care of controls, including volume, and they have an reasonable transparency mode too. They support AAC, can connect to two devices simultaneously, but can\u2019t be used independently. Call quality is reasonable.\n\nThe biggest issue is their size: the E8s are massive for earbuds and don\u2019t feel all that stable in your ears unless you use the included Comply foam tips. They\u2019re also expensive and bettered by the Sennheisers on the audio quality front.\n\nThese regularly updated deals have been sourced through a third-party price comparison service.

The StayHear+ tips rest in your concha but don\u2019t enter your ear canal, holding themselves in-place with a flexible fin.\n\nThey sound good, connectivity is rock solid with AAC support, call quality is really good, and they last more than four hours between charges. The large case provides two full charges. The biggest problem is that they\u2019re huge and stick out your ear a mile. At least the call quality is good.\n\nThese regularly updated deals have been sourced through a third-party price comparison service.

They have rock-solid Bluetooth 5 connectivity with AAC and aptX support, long eight-hour battery, good controls including a way to adjust volume and they even sound good, with balanced, rounded audio.\n\nThe case is also one of the best available, adding up to 36 hours of playback to the earbuds while still being very pocketable, fitting into the money pocket of a pair of jeans long with only a handful of the best.\n\nThe problem is, they\u2019re huge. They have a really large aperture making getting the earbud tip to fit without blocking your ear canal a bit of a chore and they stick out a mile, looking like something Nichelle Nichols\u2019s Uhura would use in classic Star Trek. The big trunk is uncomfortable in my ears, meaning any 30-minute-plus listening becomes painful. A real shame.\n\nJabra Elite 65t\n\nRRP: \u00a3149.99 / $169.99\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n\nThe Jabra Elite 65t are a good alternative to the Samsung Galaxy Buds. They have rock-solid connectivity, support for AAC, no noticeable lipsync issues and sound good, with punchy, controlled bass plus a full equaliser in the Jabra Sound+ app.\n\nThere are volume/track skip buttons on the left earbud and a pause/play button on the right, which activates ambient sound when double pressed. Call quality is good with clear voice, but background noise bleeds into the mic a little. The case is pretty compact and charges the buds twice totalling to 12 hours\u2019 playback.\n\nThe Elite 65t twist to lock in place in the ear, but are fairly large and uncomfortable for longer listening sessions for smaller ears.\n\nThese regularly updated deals have been sourced through a third-party price comparison service.

Add to that a tiny case that\u2019ll fit in the money pocket of a pair of jeans just like the Galaxy Buds and AirPods, and has wireless charging. Plus battery life of just shy of six hours and three charges in the case. They\u2019re even sweat resistant.\n\nThe downsides are lack of volume control on the earbuds, lack of AAC support for an iPhone and an easily marked case. Still, if you wish Apple made noise-cancelling AirPods with silicone earbud tips for a better fit, the Libratone Track Air+ are the ones to buy.\n\nMaster and Dynamic MW07\n\nRRP: \u00a3280 / $300\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n\nIf the Sennheiser Momentum Wireless don\u2019t fit the bill but you want great sound, then the Master and Dynamic MW07 are worth a look.\n\nThey sound good, with pronounced bass and crisp highs, but fall slightly short of the better-sounding Sennheiser. There\u2019s a slight hiss when nothing is playing, but have rock-solid connectivity with AAC and aptX support. The buds are also fairly large and certainly a statement in piano gloss. The wings are a bit uncomfortable, but I didn\u2019t need them.\n\nThe case is medium sized, and feels good in the hand, but is heavy and the earbuds don\u2019t quite snap into place unless the lid is closed. Physical buttons for controls are great, including volume. Calls sounded echoey.\n\nThese regularly updated deals have been sourced through a third-party price comparison service.

Latency is more of an issue with games. They last four hours per charge, with four full charges in an attractive, medium-sized case.\n\nA button on each earbud handles volume, track skip, pause, play and the voice assistant all accessible with multiple clicks. The button felt mushy on one set requiring replacement.\n\nThese regularly updated deals have been sourced through a third-party price comparison service.

The earbuds are quite large, but are comfortable with a solid set of earbud tips. They last up to four hours between trips in the case, which itself is one of the better ones, although not quite as pocketable as the best.\n\nConnectivity is excellent, supporting Bluetooth 5 with AAC, aptX and the new aptX Low Latency codecs, and no hint of latency issues. Call quality was good but a bit distant. Silver touch pads handle playback and volume control.\n\nThe best bit is how they sound: rich, lively and warm, with produce crisp highs and deep bass, sounding great with most music genres.\n\nThese regularly updated deals have been sourced through a third-party price comparison service.

A button on each earbud takes care of controls. Isolation is fairly weak and the case is pretty bulky and easily marked. Call quality was abysmal and there was a small lipsync issue with YouTube on an iPhone.\n\nNot recommended\n\nCrazyBaby Air Nano \u2013 Connectivity and latency issues \u2013 \u00a370\n\nJabra Elite Sport \u2013 Big, bulky and bettered by the newer Jabra Elite 65t \u2013 \u00a3200\n\nJaybird Run \u2013 Solid for runners, but unacceptable latency issues \u2013 \u00a3159\n\nJBL Free X \u2013 Large case and terrible latency issues \u2013 \u00a3120\n\nJLabs JBuds Air \u2013 Sound fine, but only SDC support means latency issues \u2013 \u00a350\n\nMotorola Verve Ones \u2013 Connectivity issues are a deal-breaker \u2013 \u00a3130\n\nNuForce BE Free8 \u2013 OK sound, but constant hiss and connectivity issues \u2013 \u00a3200\n\nRowkin Ascent Micro \u2013 small, sound OK, but serious latency issues \u2013 \u00a3125\n\nSkullycandy Indy \u2013 Sound ok, but get stuck in the case and suffer lag with an iPhone \u2013 \u00a370\n\nTaotronics BH053 \u2013 sound OK, but cheap plastic with questionable durability and lag with YouTube \u2013 \u00a338\n\nTicPods Free \u2013 Good sound and controls, but terrible latency \u2013 \u00a3120\n\nUrbanista Stockholm \u2013 AirPod ripoffs with poor fit and weak sound \u2013 \u00a389\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.
