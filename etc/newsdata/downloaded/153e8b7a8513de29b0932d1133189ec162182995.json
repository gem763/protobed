Available inventory may vary depending on when you're able to access the sale.\"\n\nA ticket FAQ also indicated \"a limited number of individual and daily hospitality opportunities still remain\" for those who did not get the tickets they wanted, and those who signed up initially could be contacted if future ticket opportunities came up.\n\nAt the heart of the frustration appeared to be the terminology of \"lottery\" for those given an access code, implying that those fans were given an advantage for ticket purchase.\n\nThe Journal Sentinel has reached out to the PGA of America seeking an explanation.\n\nThe Ryder Cup's lone communication on the issue were tweets citing overwhelming demand and inviting fans to purchase tickets on the PGA-approved secondary market.\n\nThe Ryder Cup drew an estimated crowd of 200,000 in Minnesota in 2016, the last time the United States hosted.\n\nDue to unprecedented demand for 2020 #RyderCup tickets, which quickly sold out today, some may have experienced challenges during the Random Selection Process. We appreciate everyone\u2019s enthusiasm & excitement for the #RyderCup & apologize for any inconvenience. \u2014 Ryder Cup USA (@RyderCupUSA) October 16, 2019\n\nRyder Cup 2020 tickets are sold out, even weekly passes. Waited an hour in line and didn't even get to the checkout screen. Poor process. Stubhub already has thousands of re sale listings.
