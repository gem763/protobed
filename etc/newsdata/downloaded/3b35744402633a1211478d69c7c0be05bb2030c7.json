What could this magical thing possibly be? An art fair! And here in Canada, there's none bigger than Art Toronto, which opens to the public Oct. 25 to 27.\n\nRight. So what is Art Toronto, again?\n\nLike any art fair, think of it as a trade show \u2014 a trade show where no one wears golf shirts and Dockers, and you're more likely to leave with a painting than promotional swag. Through Sunday, the Metro Toronto Convention Centre will house contemporary and modern art from more than 100 galleries. Most of these exhibitors are from around the country, but there are international guests, too. (This year's event, for example, puts a special spotlight on Portugal.) And beyond the usual friendly schmoozing, these folks are there to do business. So for serious collectors, it's a spot to do some shopping.\n\nIt's not entirely about buying and selling stuff\n\nThe fair's an opportunity to do some plain old-fashioned art appreciation, too. More than 23,000 people passed through Art Toronto in 2018, and it's not like they all left with a Miro. There are a few activities on offer, too: artist talks, panel discussions, special tours. Plus, new for this year, there's a whole program of public art. That bit is free to enjoy, and you'll find it on the ground level of the convention centre \u2014 which is where you'll also find the annual book fair. (Seeing the rest will cost you $25.)\n\nBut yes, it is totally about buying stuff\n\nIf you leave with nothing but a few selfies and a smile, power to you, but collectors love events like this one. They really, really love them. According to this 2018 art market report, when people buy art in this country, they overwhelmingly choose to do it at an art fair.\n\nIs it time for baby's first art investment? If you have the will, and the necessary funds, Art Toronto could be the place to make it happen.\n\nMarigold Santos. enter into danger, enter into soft, 2019.

Is there an advantage to starting your collection there? Lanthier says being able to browse galleries from the entire country is one perk.\n\n\"An advantage to going to an art fair is you're getting the very best,\" adds Alex Leibner, owner of Montreal's Galerie D'Este. \"Everything [the gallery] shows has to have a good likelihood of selling. These are going to be the gallery's best artists.\"\n\nThe \"best\" comes at a variety of price points \u2014 even within a single booth. Where is the gallery from? (Prices change city to city.) Are they repping established artists? Emerging ones?\n\nBut however you define the \"best,\" it never comes cheap. Artsy posts a catalogue of available works at Art Toronto. Give it a skim and you'll find that the least expensive items are in the $1,000 range. Your name doesn't have to be on the side of a concert hall to shop an art fair, but maybe do some research before you blow three months rent. About that, here's how.\n\nLet's pretend you found $20K in your couch\n\nPresuming you're ready to make that first big art purchase, hit the convention centre floor with an open mind and a portable power bank. \"It is quite overwhelming,\" says Leibner, \"so it's important to take notes, take pictures with your phone. I think most serious collectors tend to do that. They do a big once-over to see what attracts them.\"\n\n\"Look around, try to find the aesthetic that is pleasing to you, and find out more about the artist,\" says Lanthier. \"If you are in front of a piece that really seduces you, take the time to talk to the dealer.\"\n\nTalk to them about what? I'm shy!\n\n\"Most dealers will approach you, as opposed to you being brave enough to approach them,\" says Leibner, and if you're interested in buying a piece, there are a few things you should definitely be asking. Maybe you love the look of something \u2014 it's pulled you into the booth like a UFO tractor beam, and now you're doing everything in your power not to lick the canvas. (About that: don't touch the art!)\n\nWho is the artist? What is it about? Your gut tells you it's gorgeous, but is it telling a story that you'd want to live with for 20, 30, 40 years?\n\n\"If you like something in the booth, ask for information about the piece,\" says Lanthier. \"What was the artist's intent? Talk about what it means.\"\n\n\"Being receptive to the message the artist is conveying is something that I appreciate in a client,\" says Leibner.\n\n\"That piece, once you bring it into your home, you'll be talking about it,\" says Lanthier. \"All art ends up being a conversation piece, and you want to be able to keep that conversation going.\"\n\nJannick Deslauriers. Sentence, souffle et linceul, 2017. (Courtesy of Art Mur)\n\n\"Check the CV also,\" adds Lanthier. \"A lot of people don't do that. It's just \u2014 'Oh, I like this piece, how much is it?'\" And that's a major don't. If you like something, do some basic Googling on the artist's career. Are they in any notable collections? Where have they shown their work? Maybe you plan to treasure that piece forever and always, but still, seeing that an artist's earned a co-sign from a respected institution doesn't just confirm your sensational taste \u2014 it's crucial to the long-term value of the piece, Lanthier explains.\n\nAs for price, it isn't always posted \u2014 so definitely ask about that, too.\n\n\"If they won't tell you the price, probably you can't afford it,\" jokes Leibner, \"but that's not what we do as a gallery. We post everything on the website as well as on the wall at the fair.\"\n\nHold up. It's how much?\n\nIf the art's giving you sticker shock, you can always ask the gallery for a deal. That doesn't mean you'll get one, of course. \"Regular buyers do get discounts, but they're regular buyers,\" says Lanthier.\n\nV\u00e9ronique La Perri\u00e8re M. Tu es infini (vanitas), 2019. (Courtesy of Galerie D'Este)\n\n\"If there's a piece that you like, but you feel you maybe can't afford, don't ask for a lesser price \u2014 tell them your situation,\" he suggests.\n\n\"If you're working with a local gallery, you can ask for a payment plan,\" says Tess Peckover, the gallery manager at Toronto's Bau-Xi Gallery. \"Sometimes discounts are given for multiple purchases or even just in appreciation of their first purchase with the gallery, so it's just sometimes the level that a gallery or an artist is able to do.\"\n\nIf that's not the right option for you, Lanthier suggests being straightforward about what you can spend, and asking whether similar pieces are available. \"The fair is only a showcase; it's only samples of what the gallery has,\" he says.\n\nCan I take a minute to think about it?\n\nThat depends. A lot of people are potentially sizing up the same piece. \"I have seen people be very surprised by the pace,\" says Peckover. \"Something fantastic that you love will be gone if you even step away from the booth sometimes.\"\n\nMany galleries won't do holds. (Bau-Xi and Galerie D'Este, for example, stick to a policy of \"first come, first served.\") But Lanthier says it's always a question worth asking. And if the gallery won't allow it, try not to feel rushed into making a decision. \"Take your time and don't let yourself be too influenced by coup de coeur,\" he says. \"Sometimes a piece that grows on you is much better.\"\n\nIf someone snatches it up while you think, accept your fate with grace. Peckover suggests speaking to the gallery if that happens to you. \"They might be aware of a new collection coming down the line or pieces in the artist's studio. Connecting clients with the right piece is what we're here to do.\"\n\nIn conclusion, have fun...and if you can't afford anything, maybe console yourself with some chocolate from the gift shop\n\nSays Leibner: \"Just have a very open mind and look at anything that really interests you.\"\n\nArt Toronto.
