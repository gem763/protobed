Lauer was fired in November 2017 after Nevils made a complaint against the now-former Today host. Lauer denies committing sexual assault and says their encounter was consensual. In his book, Farrow claims that at least seven other women allegedly received settlements, in the form of \u201cenhanced severance,\u201d related to workplace misconduct, and were asked to sign non-disclosure agreements.\n\nAs Maddow points out, all of NBC\u2019s claims of propriety are reliant solely on the network\u2019s own internal investigation, rather than an external, ostensibly objective inquiry. She also verifies Farrow\u2019s claim that NBC sought to \u201cpause\u201d his reporting on Weinstein. The network has claimed that Farrow\u2019s expos\u00e9 on the disgraced producer, which was subsequently published in the New Yorker two months after he left NBC News with the story, was at the time incomplete and inadequate. \u201cOver a year ago, NBC News released a twelve-page, transparent account of the Weinstein reporting,\u201d the network said in a statement to Maddow\u2019s show. \u201cOnce again, we stand by it.\u201d\n\nCredit where due: @maddow, independently confirming my reporting that Weinstein story was halted by NBC execs and calling her bosses to account on their own air\u2014not an easy thing, for her or her staff\u2014 did this. https://t.co/KW75by4oJT \u2014 Ronan Farrow (@RonanFarrow) October 26, 2019", "description": "Rachel Maddow interviews Ronan Farrow about NBC\u2019s decision to stop Harvey Weinstein company, as NBC issues statement saying employees are not held by confidentiality agreements", "authors": ["Halle Kiefer"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/26/25-Rachel-Maddow.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
