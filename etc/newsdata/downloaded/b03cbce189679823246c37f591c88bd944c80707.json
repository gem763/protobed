I immediately felt irresponsible, because I do care about depression not being taboo, yet I present this bubbly, outgoing girl who seemingly gets through life with a smile on her face, and I\u2019d never discussed that some days, I don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nDuring the interview, she also opened up about her diet and medication, which includes a daily antidepressant (to help with \"waves of serotonin imbalance,\" she says), a daily dose of CBD oil and adaptogens, a form of herbal medicine.\n\nAs for her diet, the vegetarian says she normally eats egg whites, spinach, tomato and extra feta for breakfast from craft services on set. For lunch, a \u201cgarbage disposal salad,\" which includes lettuce, avocados, raisins, carrots, blue cheese and cucumbers right after a pea or hemp milk protein shake. Dinner is usually something like Banza chickpea pasta with cherry tomatoes and olive oil, according to the article.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not super restrictive,\" Bell says of her diet. \"If they make au gratin potatoes, I\u2019m going to have some, but I am mindful of the portion I take... I find that through conscious eating, I\u2019m able to have all the rewards and also maintain a healthy, steady diet.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time Bell has opened up about her mental health. In 2018, she spoke with the \"Today\" show's Meredith Sinclair about coming forward with her story.\n\n\"I want people to hear it's not a big deal and that you can be happy and healthy and no one can make you feel inferior without your consent,\" she said.\n\nMore: Kristen Bell, Dax Shepard have hilarious clap back to tabloid rumors about their marriage\n\nMore: Kristen Bell describes embarrassing encounter with Beyonce, Jay-Z \u2013 thanks to Dax Shepard\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/10/09/kristen-bell-mental-health-anxiety-cbd-oil-vegetarian-diet/3918214002/", "description": "Kristen Bell spoke to Women's Health about her mental health, from her medication (an antidepressant and CBD oil) to her vegetarian diet.", "authors": ["Sara M Moniuszko", "Published A.M.
