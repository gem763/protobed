The long-term trend line is being tested, and a close above $61.00 could trigger market adjustments that have little to do with demand but help power crude even higher.\n\nMeanwhile, there has been a 69 million barrel draw down in U.S. inventories since June 7th.\n\nFracking Miracle\n\nBrent crude had its largest one-day jump when it opened for trading. It has since pulled back, but it is still elevated. U.S. crude has shock absorbers in the form of the fracking miracle.\n\nUS Daily Production\n\nJune 2010: 5,381,000,000\n\nJune 2019: 12,082,000,000\n\nThere are 644 million barrels of oil in the Strategic Reserve, which could be tapped if there is a sense price is getting out of hand. I don\u2019t see the White House going that route immediately, perhaps if WTI gets above $65.00 to $70.00.\n\nToday\u2019s Session\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely the market will hit an all-time high today, as investors are waiting for geological shakeout from the Saudi oil strike and potential U.S. military intervention.\n\nAnother problem is weakness in Technology, especially Apple (AAPL), which got kicked to the curb by an eclectic mix of actors:\n\nGoldman Sachs new target $165 from $187\n\nJJ Abrams turned down potential $250 million to stick with Time Warner\n\nBob Iger quit the board\n\nBarron\u2019s wrote cautious article over weekend\n\nThe news this morning focused on Apple preparing for $14 billion tax battle in EU court steaming from its tax bill from 2016.\n\nApproach\n\nCommunication Services Consumer Discretionary Consumer Staples 1 2 1 Energy Financials Healthcare 1 1 2 Industrial Materials Real Estate 3 2 1 Technology Utilities Cash 3 0 3\n\nToday\u2019s Session\n\nWhile we are starting lower, I\u2019m kind of impressed with the fact major indices aren\u2019t lower.
