She is pictured at the launch of the collaboration on Friday\n\nWhile attending the launch of the partnership at Victoria's Secret's flagship store in New York City last Friday, the model took to Instagram to relish in the historic moment by sharing a photo of herself showing off her curves in a black lace teddy in one of the campaign images.\n\n'I believe I\u2019m the first size 14 on @victoriassecret?' she wrote. 'Regardless I\u2019m pretty stoked to work with a brand I idolized when I was a teen. Great step in the right direction for bodies.'\n\nIn an interview with E! News, Cutler explained that while she is not the first plus-size model to work with the brand, she is the first size 14 model to do so.\n\n'Size 14 is actually the average size of women in America and I do think that we need to see more of it in media and fashion because most women are that size. So, we need to be accurately represented in brands and media,' she said.\n\n'For Victoria's Secret I am so excited that they decided to put a size 14 women like me on the wall,' she added. 'I feel like they are headed in the right direction and they are listening to their audience who have requested to see more women of diverse shapes and sizes.\n\n'I think if they continue to head in that direction they will be on to a jackpot because that is reflective of what the average woman is in America.'\n\nProud: Cutler announced on Instagram on Friday that she is the first size 14 model to be featured in a Victoria's Secret campaign\n\nStandard: For years, Victoria's Secret has faced backlash for using only incredibly thin models in its campaigns and fashion shows. The brand came under fire for this campaign in 2014\n\nWhile Cutler is part of the Victoria's Secret X Bluebella campaign, she was brought in by Bluebella and hasn't been officially hired to model for Victoria's Secret.\n\nIn a press release that Victoria's Secret shared last week to announce the collaboration, it was noted that Bluebella stands for 'self-love, self-acceptance and championing individuality.'\n\nBluebella for Victoria's Secret includes an array of lingerie, sleepwear, and hosiery featuring luxe details, including velvet, satin, and embroidered lace.\n\nThe line launched at select Victoria's Secret stores in the US last week, and it will be available at select stores in the UK starting on Friday, October 11.\n\nVictoria's Secret's new partnership is its latest attempt to revive its ailing company, which has faced stiff competition from newer lingerie brands with more inclusive marketing strategies aimed at women of all shapes, sizes, and skin tones.\n\nRihanna's wildly successful Savage X Fenty lingerie line is among the brands that have given Victoria's Secret a run for its money in recent years.\n\nThoughts: 'I feel like they are headed in the right direction and they are listening to their audience who have requested to see more women of diverse shapes and sizes,' Cutler said\n\nImportant to note: While she is part of the Victoria's Secret X Bluebella campaign, she was brought in by Bluebella and hasn't been officially hired to model for Victoria's Secret\n\nStruggle: Victoria's Secret has faced stiff competition from lingerie brands with more inclusive marketing strategies. Elsa Hosk is pictured at the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show in 2018\n\nThe singer's second annual Savage x Fenty runway show streamed exclusively on Amazon Prime Video on September 20, a little over a week after it was filmed at Barclays Center in Brooklyn during New York Fashion Week.\n\nNumerous headlines purported that the diverse spectacular, which featured musical performances, dancers, and a wide representation of models, had 'killed' Victoria's Secret.\n\nThe nine-time Grammy winner kicked off her hour-long New York Fashion Week presentation with a sultry choreographed dance number.\n\nVogue called the slickly-staged performance art 'the event of the year' thanks to a large cast of models representing all genders, ages, and sizes.\n\nOut Magazine said Riri's 16-month-old lingerie label was the 'queerest show' thanks to catwalk appearances from Laverne Cox, Isis King, Cara Delevigne, and Aquaria.\n\nAnd bisexual pop star Halsey was among the onstage performers, which included Migos, Normani, DJ Khaled, Big Sean, Tierra Whack, and A$AP Ferg.\n\nCompetition: Rihanna's wildly successful Savage X Fenty lingerie line is among the brands that have given Victoria's Secret a run for its money in recent years\n\nWinning: Numerous headlines purported that Savage X Fenty's second annual fashion show, which featured a wide representation of model, had 'killed' Victoria's Secret\n\nRihanna's 'Navy' legion of fans tweeted mostly about the elephant in the room: the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show, which was canceled this year due to low ratings.\n\nVictoria's Secret has quietly been trying to turn the tide by hiring a slightly curvier cast, though it's unclear which models Cutler was referring to when she said she wasn't the first plus-size woman to work with the brand.\n\nWhen the retailer announced earlier this year that Barbara Palvin would become one of its newest Angels, some tried to claim she was the brand's first 'plus-size' campaign star.\n\nAt 5'9\" with a 24-inch waist, the 26-year-old Hungarian model is far from plus-sized. However, she is more curvaceous than the brand's standard models, leading some to believe that the company was finally listening to public outcry over its lack of inclusivity.\n\nSpanish beauty Lorena Duran was dubbed Victoria's Secret's 'first curvy model' when she signed with the brand in April. Some went as far as calling her the brand's first plus-size model, though she is relatively thin and describes herself as curvy.\n\nIn August, the lingerie brand made history when it hired its first transgender model, Brazilian beauty Valentina Sampaio.\n\nThe changes came after the departure of longtime chief marketing officer Ed Razek, who faced backlash in November 2018 after he told Vogue that trans and plus-size models weren't right for the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show.\n\nStar: Spanish beauty Lorena Duran was dubbed Victoria's Secret's 'first curvy model' when she signed with the brand in April. Some went as far as calling her the brand's first plus-size model\n\nChanges: Earlier this year, Barbara Palvin (left) was named as a new Angel, with some noting she is curvier than many others. It then hired its first trans model, Valentina Sampaio (right)\n\n'We attempted to do a television special for plus-sizes [in 2000]. No one had any interest in it, still don\u2019t,' he said. 'I don\u2019t think we can be all things to all customers. It is a specialty business; it isn\u2019t a department store.'\n\nRazek apologized for the gaff later, but not before ThirdLove founder Heidi Zak seized on it with a scathing full-page ad in the New York Times.\n\n'You market to men and sell a male fantasy to women,' Zak wrote. 'Your show may be a \"fantasy,\" but we live in reality... We may not have been a woman\u2019s first love, but we will be her last.'\n\nThree months later, executives for L Brands, the lingerie brand's parent company, announced that it was closing as many as 53 Victoria Secret stores across the US in 2019.\n\nVictoria's Secret had already closed 20 stores in 2018 amid a poor annual sales performance, ending the year with former CEO Jan Singer resigning in November.\n\nTV ratings for the annual Victoria Secret Fashion Show also fell to a historic low of just 3.3 million in 2018, down from a high of more than 10 million viewers in 2011, according to a February 13 report from CNBC.\n\nIn July, Victoria's Secret runway veteran Shanina Shaik revealed this year's fashion show has been canceled, though the brand has yet to confirm or deny her claim.", "description": "Plus-size model Ali Tate Cutler is working with Victoria's Secret as part of the brand's new partnership with London-based lingerie company Bluebella.", "authors": ["Erica Tempesta For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/19/19455856-0-image-a-2_1570559752629.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
