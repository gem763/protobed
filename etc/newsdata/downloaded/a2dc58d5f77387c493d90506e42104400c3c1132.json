The Intelligence Committee is much smaller than most other House committees, with only 22 members compared to 41 in Judiciary and many other committees.\n\nThe Judiciary Committee is also home to some of the most outspoken and confrontational Republicans, such as ranking member Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, House Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Biggs, R-Ky., and others.\n\nImpeachment investigation witnesses, who have yet to be named but who are presumably on the list of names already interviewed in closed-door depositions, will testify instead in front of Republicans on the Intelligence Committee, like Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York and Will Hurd of Texas, who are more moderate and focused on policy.\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "Under past precedent in 1974 and 1998 \u2014 the last two times the House conducted an impeachment inquiry \u2014 the House Judiciary Committee was the hub for investigations, hearings, and a committee vote on articles of impeachment.", "authors": ["Jon Ward", "Senior Political Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GKmVCdCjjuTz1eiCjFdf5g--~B/aD0zNzEyO3c9NTU2ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/a7ea9a60-f9ce-11e9-97fe-b9311d922bae", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
