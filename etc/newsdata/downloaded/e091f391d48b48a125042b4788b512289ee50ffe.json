The latest are members of the Super Glue Gang.\n\nHaven\u2019t you heard?\n\nThe Super Glue Gang advocates climate change. They\u2019ve decided that God can\u2019t make up his mind and that Mother Nature is confused.\n\nThe natural scheme of things is off kilter, but a new Green New Deal will make everything ecological correct. A new silent spring, if you will, will come via congressional action in 2020.\n\nA group of a few hundred activists under the banner of Shutdown DC hit town Monday morning. They blocked major thoroughfares during morning rush hour, causing major headaches for commuters, people trying to enjoy the last vestiges of a sunny pre-autumn morn and beckoning their GPS systems for alternatives to the traffic blockades manned by police.\n\nLaw enforcers were restrained, as usual, enabling protesters their First Amendment rights. Only three dozen or so were arrested, which means they\u2019ll be back for more shenanigans.\n\nThe Super Glue Gang\u2019s next performance is set for Friday morning.\n\nTo tell the truth, the protesters did not shut down D.C. They merely slowed down and inconvenienced folks who aren\u2019t familiar with how the climate of a daily D.C. commute changes when protesters are in town exercising their First Amendment rights.\n\nFor sure, that\u2019s an inconvenient truth.\n\nWhat\u2019s arresting, though, is what some of the activists pulled off just to put an exclamation point on their climate change antics. They Super Glued themselves to their props.\n\nHadn\u2019t you heard?\n\nThey used a bright pink and a bright yellow sailboat to block traffic along K Street NW, the heart of D.C. Lobby Town. Then they sat down and Super Glued themselves to the vessel.\n\nOutrageous, huh?\n\nAs outrageous and dangerous as chaining yourself to a tree. Which environmental activists do.\n\nAs outrageous and dangerous as stirring up the United Nations to force financial institutions to donate climate change ideological kookiness.\n\nSee, people are dying because they do not have easy access to clean water.\n\nPeople are dying because people who provide medical care are being violently shooed away.\n\nPeople are dying because they\u2019re ill-prepared for natural disasters \u2014 disasters that have flooded our globe since, well, read the Book of Genesis \u2026 in the Bible. It\u2019s the first book, the one that starts \u201cIn the beginning\u201d \u2014 and it has nothing to do with \u201cit coming in the air tonight, oh Lord.\u201d\n\nThat grown folks took a toxic substance, poured it on their skin and then placed their skin on a boat that said with bold black letters that said \u201cREBEL FOR LIFE\u201d is dangerous.\n\nIt\u2019s dangerous because these people are role models, whether we agree with them or not. And young people are glued to YouTube and other social media to get a good close-up look at what to do next.\n\nThey\u2019ve already hooked school \u2014 and they\u2019re excused for playing hooky.\n\nEncouraging young people to be environmentally conscious is one thing. Urging them and showing them how to hurt themselves in the process, however, is dangerous and stupid.\n\nWhat\u2019s outrageous is some of members of the Super Glue Gang appeared old enough to have read Rachel Carson\u2019s \u201cSilent Spring\u201d when it was published in 1962 \u2014 a seminal tome in the environmental movement.\n\nIt\u2019s theme? The danger in toxic chemicals.\n\n\u2981 Deborah Simmons can be contacted at [email protected]\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
