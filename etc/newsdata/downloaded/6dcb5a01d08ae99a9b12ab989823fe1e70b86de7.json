During mating season, the bird can become aggressive and attack humans crossing its territory.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Spring is the most active time for magpie attacks\n\nEarlier this month, a local Sydney council sparked controversy when rangers shot dead a \"monster\" magpie which had intimidated residents for years.\n\nThe \"particularly aggressive\" bird had attacked several people in the Hills Shire in the city's north-west, sending some to hospital.\n\nOne resident had also suffered a heart attack following a run-in with the bird, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported.\n\nOfficials at the time defended their decision to kill the large magpie. The species is protected by law but can be dealt with by local authorities at their discretion.\n\nYou may also be interested in", "description": "The man suffered head injuries after swerving his bicycle in a bid to avoid the aggressive bird.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/D93C/production/_108821655_gettyimages-588386678.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
