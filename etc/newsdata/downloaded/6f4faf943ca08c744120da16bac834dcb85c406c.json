A spokesperson for Thiel declined to comment.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: The Voice\u2019s Jordan Pruitt Sues Disney and Her Former Manager Who She Says Abused Her as a Teen\n\nThe letters were not signed, but occasionally included a return address with certain initials that, more than once, led recipients \u201cto assume the letters originated from one of Mithril\u2019s more significant limited partners,\u201d the suit claims.\n\nOne of the letters accused Thiel\u2019s co-founder Ajay Royan of \u201clying to investors and the public about how much\u201d he charged in management fees, though the suit alleges he did not lie, and that McKellar even wrote and signed off on the disclosure agreements, according to the papers.\n\n\u201cMore than one witness or intended victim has reported such conduct to Mithril after being contacted by Ms. McKellar,\u201d the suit claims.\n\nThe actress-turned-lawyer was identified as the alleged letter-writing culprit in a forensic handwriting analysis, a discovery that shocked Mithril higher-ups, as she\u2019d heaped high praise on Royan shortly before leaving, the suit says.\n\nIn a statement to the Post, McKellar denied the allegations, saying it would be easy to prove them wrong.\n\n\u201cI can state that the allegations of wrongdoing are unequivocally false, and it will be a simple matter to prove them false if it gets that far,\u201d she said. \u201cI left Mithril earlier this year when it became clear to me that Mithril\u2019s leadership was lying to its investors and that the promises it had made were not going to be kept.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Wonder Years Reunion!

He said he was won over by Trump\u2019s skepticism toward the use of military force abroad.", "description": "Crystal McKellar Accused of Plotting Against Peter Thiel's Firm: Lawsuit", "authors": ["Rachel Desantis"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/cgl5VSf1Gc7k8P5dVcZN6A--~B/aD0xODAwO3c9MjcwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/66054a72f346c2d8d462c3bb9aa53e56", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
