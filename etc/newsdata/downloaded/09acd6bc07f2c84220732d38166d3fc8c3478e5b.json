Gender identity is a protected characteristic under Iowa\u2019s Civil Rights Act.\n\n\u201cThe Iowa Legislature has reversed course on what was settled law under the Iowa Civil Rights Act, repealing protections for those seeking gender-affirming healthcare,\u201d Becerra said in a statement. \u201cCalifornia has taken an unambiguous stand against discrimination and government actions that would enable it.\u201d\n\nCalifornia\u2019s travel blacklist stems from a 2016 law allowing the Golden State to ban state travel to other U.S. states that roll back protections for LGBT citizens.
