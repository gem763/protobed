I don't know what is happening. We cannot even score one goal in two games.\"\n\n(Image: EMPICS Sport)\n\nThe interview seemed to be an emotional one for de Gea, who has been at Old Trafford since 2011, who struggled to find the right words.\n\nBut United legend Ince was not impressed with his words and branded him clueless and not befitting of a leader.\n\n\u201cI watched David De Gea\u2019s post-match interview and I was at a loss,\" Ince told Paddy Power.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s meant to be one of the leaders, if that was Peter Schmeichel standing there, there\u2019s no chance you\u2019d have seen that interview.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\u201cRather than him addressing and recognising where the team were going wrong, it just felt like \u2018I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know.\u2019\n\n\u201cThis is one of the top players, the leaders at Manchester United , who has just signed a five-year contract!\n\n\u201cAnd he looks like he doesn\u2019t have a clue what\u2019s going on. If you\u2019re a United fan listening to your goalkeeper, one of the main leaders in the team, and that\u2019s the interview you here you\u2019d be right to be disgraced.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be looking thinking, Jesus, he doesn\u2019t have a clue what\u2019s going on \u2013 I bet he\u2019s regretting signing that contract.\u201d\n\nPaul Ince was speaking exclusively to Paddy Power News.
