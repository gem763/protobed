Photo: Facebook Share:\n\nThe move, said Manpower Minister Josephine Teo, was aimed at helping couples conceive even as more decided to marry later in life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSubsidies to be introduced from next year will contribute up to 75 per cent of the cost of IVF treatment for Singaporean couples, or up to S$7,700 per cycle.\n\nIn addition, the health ministry will remove the age limit on IVF, which is currently 45 years, and the cap of 10 cycles per woman. Last year, there were 992 cycles of assisted reproduction techniques \u2013 including but not limited to IVF \u2013 performed on women aged between 41 and 45, according to the health ministry. In 2014, there were just 709.\n\nThe move follows reports in the Singapore media that women older than 45 had been crossing the causeway to Malaysia, where there is a cluster of fertility clinics just 10 minutes from the Woodlands Checkpoint. Procedures in Malaysia are reputedly cheaper and clinics are allowed to test embryos before they are implanted in the uterus, which can improve the chances of success.\n\nBut experts say the government\u2019s new measures, which would benefit a small minority of women, will do little to boost the country\u2019s declining fertility rate in the short run, though it might have a greater effect in the longer term.\n\nSingapore is working to reduce the cost of IVF in its bid to boost its birth rate. Photo: AFP Share:\n\nAccording to its latest population figures, released last month, Singapore recorded 32,413 citizen births in 2018, a slight rise from 32,356 the year before. However, during the same period, the total fertility rate \u2013 the number of births per woman \u2013 fell from 1.16 to 1.14. The reason for the discrepancy is that there were more women of reproductive age \u2013 classed as 15 to 49 \u2013 who did not give birth.\n\nThe figures show that Singapore has one of the world\u2019s lowest fertility rates and is lagging Asian neighbours Malaysia, Indonesia and Japan, which in 2017 had fertility rates of 2, 2.3 and 1.4 respectively, according to the World Bank. Hong Kong and South Korea both had rates of 1.1. For a population to replace itself, a fertility rate of 2.1 is needed.\n\nReferring to the latest IVF initiatives to promote parenthood at a later age, Leong Chan-Hoong, a senior research fellow at the National University of Singapore\u2019s (NUS\u2019s) Institute of Policy Studies, said the measures were symbolic of the government\u2019s efforts but would do little to reverse the falling birth numbers.\n\nHe said the measures catered only to a \u201cminority group\u201d of older couples who had a greater need for them. \u201cThe more important message is that the government is trying to do the best it can to support fertility growth.\u201d\n\nSingapore had a fertility rate of 3.07 in the 1970s. But the country then started to aggressively promote family planning methods and two-child families to control its population amid the boom in births after the second world war.\n\nCampaigns such as \u201cStop-at-Two\u201d, launched by its family planning unit, were successful, but the effects can still be felt today.\n\nThe health ministry declined to comment on what it hoped to achieve with the changes to its IVF policies, but NUS sociologist Tan Ern Ser said they could \u201csomewhat\u201d boost Singapore\u2019s fertility rate in the long run, especially when Singaporeans were getting married at a later age.\n\nData from the same population report revealed that the median age for marriage last year was 30.2 for men, and 28.5 for women. This compared to 28.7 and 27.7 respectively in 2000.\n\nLong working hours are one of the reasons Singaporeans are putting parenthood plans on hold. Photo: AFP Share:\n\nLeong said long working hours were one reason couples were putting parenthood on hold. Singaporeans worked about 44.9 hours a week last year, according to the manpower ministry, or about nine hours a day.\n\nLeong said policymakers could look into how to make the workplace \u201cmore pro-family\u201d. He cited the example of Singapore changing its five-and-a-half-day work week to a five-day one for civil servants in 2004.\n\nAnother reason was that many young Singaporeans were perfectionists, Leong said. They wanted perfect careers and financial standing before starting a family, but Leong said there was \u201cno perfect time\u201d.\n\nYoung Singaporeans also perceived parenthood as the end of a \u201clinear progression of life priorities\u201d, in which they obtain a degree, secure a job, marry, find the perfect home, and only then consider having children.\n\nThis mentality stopped people from having more babies and needed to be rethought, he said.\n\nOther Singaporeans are simply deciding that parenthood is not for them. Among them is Chris Tan, a 38-year-old creative head at a Singaporean advertising agency.\n\nShe said having children was a \u201cbig commitment\u201d, and she could help \u201ca lot more children\u201d using the resources it would take to raise just one of her own.\n\nShe pointed out that giving birth at 45 would require a lot of financial planning.\n\nTan, who has been married for seven years, said: \u201cWhen you\u2019re 60 and your kid is only 15, that is not even the age for [enlistment] or university. That would mean 10 more years of expenses.\n\n\u201cUnless you have very good savings and buying policies to ensure that the kid\u2019s education is taken care of, then there is no way you can keep up. You can stop working only when you\u2019re 70.\u201d\n\nFinances also weigh heavily on the minds of young would-be parents.", "description": "The Lion City is encouraging older women to undergo IVF in a bid to boost a birth rate that is among the lowest in the world.
