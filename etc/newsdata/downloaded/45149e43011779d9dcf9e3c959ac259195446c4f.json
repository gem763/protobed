Karen Bass (D-CA) said that House Republicans have \u201cfull access\u201d to the interviews Democrats are conducting behind closed doors as part of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s (D-CA)\u2019s impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cThe Republicans are sitting right there,\u201d Bass said in an interview on Wednesday with National Public Radio (NPR). \u201cThey have full access to everything that\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are invited,\u201d Bass said. \u201cIf you serve on one of the three committees, anyone can come in the room.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so this is not hidden from them,\u201d Bass said. \u201cThis is not a secretive process.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s disingenuous,\u201d Bass said.\n\nNoel King, host of NPR\u2019s Morning Edition, asked Bass about the testimony of Ambassador William Taylor who was the top U.S. diplomat in the Ukraine and has no direct knowledge of any alleged quid pro quo.\n\n\u201cSo what were your biggest takeaways from this deposition that some of your colleagues have called damning?\u201d King asked.\n\n\u201cI will say first of all that Ambassador Taylor is a patriot, a courageous leader that we should thank, especially thinking down the line,\u201d Bass said. \u201cHistorically, I believe he will be remembered that way.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow does Ambassador Taylor\u2019s testimony fit with the other testimony that Congress has heard so far in this matter?\u201d King asked. Bass said:\n\nWell, I think that it\u2019s more and more evidence piling up. But what I believe is happening right now is, within the intelligence community and the State Department, I think people have had enough. I think people have been disrespected and abused, essentially, for the last 2 1/2 years.\n\n\u201cLet me just ask you briefly \u2013 Republicans took to the floor yesterday after Ambassador Taylor testified. They said all of this is a sham. It is secretive. It\u2019s going behind \u2013 it\u2019s going on behind closed doors. What do you think of that?\u201d\n\nBass replied:\n\nWell, first of all, it\u2019s not a sham. It\u2019s important for us to receive testimony and hear from people right now behind closed doors so that they\u2019re not tracking their testimony. However, I know that this will go to an open hearings very soon. But it is important that we bring everybody in first, we hear their testimony.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, the impeachment process is anything but transparent, and on Wednesday a throng of Republicans tried to join the investigation:\n\nLed by House Judiciary Committee member Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL), the Republican lawmakers attempted to enter the room where Schiff has been bringing in current and former State Department officials to testify on whether President Trump withheld military aid from Ukraine in exchange for alleged help with the 2020 election. \u201cBehind those doors they intend to overturn the results of an American presidential election. We want to know what is going on,\u201d Gaetz said during a press conference beforehand. \u201cWe are going to try and go in there, and we\u2019re going to try to figure out what is going on behalf of the millions of Americans that we represent, who want to see Congress working for them, and not obsessed with attacking a president who we believe has not done anything to deserve impeachment,\u201d Gaetz said.\n\nLast week, 184 Republicans backed a bill to censure Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) for mishandling the impeachment inquiry.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter", "description": "Rep.
