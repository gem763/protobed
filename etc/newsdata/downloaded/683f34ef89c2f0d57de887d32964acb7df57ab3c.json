That means quicker steering responses and less understeer.\n\nDuring extreme deceleration, a smaller engine also enact less brake dive on the front half of the vehicle.\n\nWith advances in engine design and hybridization, there is no question that a potential future four-cylinder C63 would be every bit as fast as it should.\n\nIn fact, the only possible issue would be acoustic. AMG has always traded strongly on the noise of its V8 engines.\n\nImage: Mercedes-Benz\n\nIt deploys a great deal of resources to ensure that its V8s have a very specific sound profile, which distinguish them from rival six- and eight-cylinder engines.\n\nWith a four-cylinder powerplant, it is a lot more difficult to create the required drama that has always been so inherent to the C63 ownership experience.\n\nActive valving can help AMG achieve its goal of created a hybridized C63 which sounds true to purpose, but dramatic engine sound is fundamentally a factor of engine capacity and very high crankspeed.\n\nThese are two mechanical attributes that are a weakness of any future-proof four-cylinder turbocharge engine.\n\nFor fans of the C63 there is no doubt that any future reconfiguration to four-cylinders, will not sacrifice performance, although it might sound a lot different to all those C63s which have gone before.", "description": "'AMG is rumoured to be downsizing its future C63 by halving its cylinder count.
