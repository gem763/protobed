(Whitney Curtis/The New York Times)\n\nROSEVILLE, Ill. \u2014 Surrounded by waist-high hemp plants, Andy Huston, a sixth-generation farmer in Illinois, stopped to admire one of the ridged green leaves.\n\n\u201cI could just spend all day in my hemp field pulling weeds,\u201d Huston said.\n\nHuston planted corn and soybeans this year, about 1,100 acres of each, just as he has for decades. But he is depending on a far smaller 17-acre plot of hemp, newly legalized for cultivation in Illinois, to spare his struggling bottom line.\n\nThe alternative crop, he says, may be especially important this harvest. Flooding in the Midwest kept some fields wet late into the planting season. And farmers are struggling with the effects of a trade fight with China, which has crippled exports of U.S. agricultural commodities like soybeans.\n\n\u201cEvery time I put corn and soybeans in the ground, it\u2019s a risk,\u201d Huston said. He hopes the rising popularity of hemp-based cannabidiol, or CBD, will help him turn a profit.\n\nIn December 2018, the federal farm bill removed a ban that classified hemp as a controlled substance equivalent to heroin. The shift coincided with the sudden popularity of CBD, which some claim can soothe ailments from depression to menstrual cramps.\n\nSome states had already allowed farmers to grow hemp, interpreting earlier federal provisions to allow commercial production. Other states responded with legislation allowing hemp.\n\nThe farm bill expanded cultivation: Illinois is one of 13 states planting hemp for the first time this year, according to Vote Hemp, an advocacy group. An estimated 285,000 acres of hemp were planted nationwide compared with about 78,000 acres in 2018, according to the Brightfield Group, a Chicago-based market research firm for the cannabis industry. About 87% of hemp grown this year will be used for CBD, according to Brightfield.\n\n\u201cIt went from a trickle to a flood,\u201d said Tyler Mark, an agricultural economist at the University of Kentucky who studies hemp.\n\nHemp and marijuana are varieties of cannabis sativa that differ in how much psychoactive chemical they produce. Marijuana is rich in THC, the psychoactive component, and hemp is richer in CBD. That can confuse lawmakers and law enforcement officials, in part because hemp looks (and smells) like marijuana.\n\n\u201cPeople just don\u2019t understand what hemp is,\u201d said Jeffrey Cox, the head of Illinois\u2019s bureau of medicinal plants, who oversaw a small hemp field at this summer\u2019s state fair to introduce the new crop. \u201cI had to explain that it\u2019s not marijuana to hundreds and hundreds of people.\u201d\n\nHemp was grown in U.S. fields until the 1930s, when it was included in federal legislation restricting marijuana. Even then, it was not eradicated: Wild hemp is often called \u201cditch weed.\u201d\n\nThis year, about 1,000 farmers in Illinois applied to grow fewer than 23,000 acres of hemp, according to John Sullivan, the director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture. That is minuscule compared with the acres of corn (11 million) and soybeans (10.8 million) planted last year. But some see it as a necessary alternative.\n\n\u201cOur corn and soybean farmers have lost customers,\u201d Gov. J.B. Pritzker of Illinois said. \u201cAnd when you have a large customer and you lose them in a given year, it\u2019s very hard to get them back.\u201d\n\nHuston, who voted for President Donald Trump and intends to do so again, said he believed that the president had good intentions in his trade standoff, although like other farmers, Huston said he was frustrated and had suffered from its effects.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bad way to do business,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we end up with better markets at the end of this, it will have been worth it. But I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s likely.\u201d\n\nAmong farmers, Huston is seen as a cheerleader and expert on hemp. Last year, he was the only person in Illinois to grow hemp as part of a research project with Western Illinois University.\n\nGrowing hemp for CBD can be tricky. The federal government has not approved any pesticides for hemp, so labor costs are high because fields need to be tended by hand. Male plants have to be culled because a pollinated female will stop producing CBD. (Hermaphrodite plants, which develop both male and female flowers, self-pollinate and also need to be removed.)\n\nAnn Knowles and Will Terrill, who own Prairie Smoke Herb, a hemp farm in Colchester, Illinois., said they were struggling with their first crop.", "description": "ROSEVILLE, Ill. -- Surrounded by waist-high hemp plants, Andy Huston, a sixth-generation farmer in Illinois, stopped to admire one of the ridged green leaves.\"I could just spend all day in my hemp field pulling weeds,\" Huston said.Huston planted corn and soybeans this year, about 1,100 acres", "authors": ["Amelia Nierenberg"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/NNwYo7aUq0RjOuIBz3Jdbg--~B/aD0yNDAwO3c9MzYwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/83cb1716b7476a45dbc1c38c22e9548b", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
