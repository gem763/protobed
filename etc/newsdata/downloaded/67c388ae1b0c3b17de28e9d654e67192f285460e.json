But they can\u2019t win in an age of populist politics.\n\nIn the wake of the Hayne royal commission, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission imposed elevated responsible lending laws to prevent \"reckless\" loans to home buyers and small business, even amid record low loan defaults. As the economy has inconveniently softened, the Morrison government has urged the banks not to be bound by the same stricter credit standards because they might put a brake on investment, the housing market, and jobs. Now the banks stand accused by the Prime Minister and Treasurer of profiteering by failing to pass on in full the three official interest rate cuts since June to mortgage borrowers, even though mortgage interest rates have fallen to the lowest levels on record.\n\nSo now the banks are required to submit to yet another government inquiry, this time by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, even though the government is yet to act on all of the 34 recommendations made in last year\u2019s Productivity Commission report on competition in financial services. This regulatory forum shopping itself has only been prompted because, under pressure from the government, the Reserve Bank has cut official interest rates to an absurdly low 0.75 per cent, even at the risk of restoking a big-city housing price bubble and adding to what are already record high levels of household debt. As the Reserve Bank\u2019s Financial Stability Review said earlier this month, asset values pumped up by ultra-cheap money are vulnerable to a sudden correction.\n\nThe big four banks are no longer the only mortgage players. Chris Pearce\n\nAmong other risks, this ultra-loose monetary policy is squeezing bank interest margins as more of their deposit rates approach zero. To limit the squeeze, the big four banks have passed on only 57 basis points of the aggregate 75 basis point cuts in the cash rate made by Reserve Bank since June. The smaller banks, including ME Bank, owned by the industry super funds, have done much the same. Yet this has still provided the prompt from ACCC chair Rod Sims to push Josh Frydenberg to commission an inquiry into the factors that determine residential mortgage rates, to establish whether existing home loan borrowers pay a \"loyalty tax\" compared with new borrowers, and to consider the impediments that discourage mortgagees from switching banks.\n\nThe banks remain an easy political target after Hayne. But as Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe said a fortnight ago: \u201cMortgage rates are at record lows and there is strong competition for borrowers of high credit quality.\u201d Greater competition and tech disruption in the sector has loosened the traditional banks' hold on core service areas including mortgages. The big four can hardly be blamed that 75 per cent of home buyers continue to borrow with them and choose not to shop around for the best deal. As former AMP chief executive and former Commonwealth Bank director Andrew Mohl explained in The Australian Financial Review on Monday, the squeeze on the banks\u2019 net interest margin reflects their loss of pricing power and falling returns on equity. In any case, Reserve Bank board member Ian Harper, who led the government\u2019s 2015 competition policy review, rejects the government\u2019s charges of bank \u201cprofiteering\u201d and Mr Sims\u2019 claims that banks are dudding loyal customers.\n\nAttacking big business was the keynote of Labor\u2019s failed federal election strategy. The government has rejected Labor\u2019s call for a hike in the tax on the big four banks that then treasurer Scott Morrison imposed in 2017 \u201cbecause nobody likes you\u201d. Ironically, that tax was also imposed on Macquarie Bank, one of the smaller mortgage lenders that the government now wants to compete more strongly against the big four. Mr Frydenberg is downplaying the scope for any new big sticks to come out of the ACCC inquiry and suggests it could even help the banks to make their case. Instead, it more resembles the campaign waged by then treasurer Wayne Swan back in 2010. Banks are a convenient whipping boy for politicians of all stripes. But putting the banks on another show trial is no substitute for the real policy leadership needed to chart a surer course through local and global economic uncertainty.", "description": "The Morrison government's regulatory forum shopping puts a strong and healthy banking system at risk.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_95/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/bc27c05ba232fc515bd046ba30689c686839ca05", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
