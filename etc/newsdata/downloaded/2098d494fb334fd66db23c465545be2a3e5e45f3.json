Military officials were still awaiting forensics verification, according to Newsweek, who first reported on the assault.\n\nUS troops faced incoming fire once they entered the site, a senior Defense Department official said to Newsweek, adding that the ISIS leader appeared to have killed himself by detonating a suicide vest. Two of Baghdadi's wives were reportedly killed by their own suicide vests.\n\nPrior to the raid against al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in 2011, White House officials decided the US would bury him at sea in the event he was killed. Officials reportedly reasoned that it would prevent bin Laden's gravesite from becoming a shrine. Then-CIA director John Brennan said the administration consulted with Islamic experts and that bin Laden was buried \"in accordance with the Islamic requirements,\" according to The New York Times.\n\nBaghdadi's last public sighting was from an April 29 propaganda video, the first visual sighting of him in five years. In September, an audio recording purportedly of Baghdadi issuing orders was released by the terrorist organization. Both of Baghdadi's appearances followed ISIS's loosening grip in Syria and Iraq amid the US-led coalition's campaign to rid the region of the group.\n\nIn 2018, ISIS militants and Iraqi intelligence indicated that Baghdadi's son, Hudhayfah al-Badri, was killed in Syria. ISIS's social media channels claimed Badri was conducting a suicide bombing operation against Russian forces, while Iraqi reports suggested he and 10 others were killed in a Russian missile attack, Voice of America reported.\n\nBaghdadi was previously rumored to have been killed or wounded by airstrikes on numerous occasions in recent years. He became ISIS's leader in 2010 after two of his predecessors killed themselves before being captured by US and Iraqi forces.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Saturday night tweeted vaguely that a \"very big\" event had taken place, and a White House official said he would make an announcement on Sunday morning.\n\nThe Defense Department did not respond to a request for comment.", "description": "Officials previously ordered Osama bin Laden's burial at sea in the event he was killed, in order to prevent his gravesite from becoming a shrine.", "authors": ["David Choi"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5b7eb1e2959f341c008b5426?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
