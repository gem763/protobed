I remember Rashford scoring twice when United won at Old Trafford two seasons ago under Jose Mourinho. He was encouraged to stay upfield and run in behind rather than track the Liverpool full-backs.\n\nRashford seems to get joy playing down the left side of a 4-3-3. The question is whether Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is bold enough to tell Rashford to let Alexander-Arnold go so that he\u2019ll have space on the counter.\n\nAnd whether United see enough of the ball for Rashford to stand up to Alexander-Arnold one-on-one. The pair are friends as well so there will be a lot of personal pride in who comes out on top, as well as the enormity of the game.\n\nIt is worth Solskjaer taking that risk, it\u2019s one of the few attacking weapons he has in a team struggling for goals. If Alexander-Arnold is a bit stranded, Liverpool will rely on Jordan Henderson getting across to cover, but if United can get the ball into Rashford high up and early, he won\u2019t be caught.\n\nAnthony Martial could also pressurise Liverpool's right flank if he is to start\n\nIf Anthony Martial starts in the middle, he also likes drifting to the left during the game and that would put even more pressure on that side of Liverpool\u2019s defence. I remember Thierry Henry and Roberto Pires doubling up on the left for Arsenal at times and causing difficulty.\n\nI even wonder if Jurgen Klopp may play Joe Gomez as the right-sided central defender for his extra pace. That\u2019s no reflection on Joel Matip\u2019s form \u2014 he has been outstanding \u2014 but for this fixture, Gomez is a consideration. United could go 4-4-2 or a diamond to try and surprise Liverpool but, when a team is low on confidence, jiggling about with new systems doesn\u2019t always work.\n\nI think United will stick to 4-3-3 but that right side of Liverpool\u2019s defence is maybe vulnerable if United are bold enough to leave Rashford up to find gaps.\n\nMANE v WAN-BISSAKA\n\nSadio Mane has been Liverpool\u2019s best player this season and probably the best in the Premier League. He has become better than I ever thought he would, offensively and defensively.\n\nHaving said that, if there is one full-back capable of matching him physically, it is Aaron Wan-Bissaka. He looks brilliant defensively which isn\u2019t that common for full-backs in the modern era.\n\nAssuming Sadio Mane starts on the left then Aaron Wan-Bissaka will have his hands full\n\nKlopp does have options, he could move Mane more centrally away from Wan-Bissaka and play Roberto Firmino on the left \u2014 but I have a feeling Liverpool\u2019s mentality at the moment is they aren\u2019t going to shift around because they fear United.\n\nAssuming Mane is on the left, Wan-Bissaka will have his hands full. He is as quick and good in the tackle as any defender Mane will face this season. The great thing about Mane is that if Wan-Bissaka tries to get forward, the Liverpool winger doesn\u2019t mind doing the hard yards to stop him.\n\nMcTOMINAY v HENDERSON\n\nThere are similarities between the pair. Midfielders with great physical attributes, tenacity getting around the pitch and technically good footballers.\n\nI suspect with Paul Pogba\u2019s injury, Nemanja Matic and Fabinho may be the deepest of the midfielders for either side and Henderson and McTominay could come into some direct competition \u2014 the master and the apprentice.\n\nHenderson has shown in the past couple of seasons that he\u2019s more than just a holder. He can play a killer pass. McTominay will end up the same way, I believe. He showed against Arsenal with his equaliser that he can be more creative and incisive than we realised when he first came into the United team.\n\nThere are several noticeable similarities between Jordan Henderson and Scott McTominay\n\nThe biggest compliment I can pay them is that I wouldn\u2019t like to play against either. They aren\u2019t going to dazzle you with fancy footwork or have the cleverness of a Paul Scholes but they will never stop doing the right things; getting the second ball, covering their mates, playing a pass, running off the ball. They are both quick enough and decent in the air.\n\nHenderson may have the edge this afternoon because of his greater experience. And also because he has better midfield company around him. When he started at Liverpool, he had Steven Gerrard to help him.\n\nThe problem for United is McTominay is their top midfielder when Paul Pogba\u2019s out and that is a lot of responsibility for a 22-year-old who has had 25 Premier League starts.\n\nROMERO v ALISSON\n\nRarely can a match as big as this have as many question marks about both goalkeepers. Not because of their ability \u2014 they have been established No 1s for Argentina and Brazil \u2014 but due to their lack of recent action.\n\nGoalkeepers are no different to other positions, training is no substitute for playing in terms of sharpness and concentration.\n\nRomero has played just twice this season in cup competitions and Alisson hasn\u2019t been seen since the opening league game against Norwich because of a calf injury.\n\nDespite that, I think Klopp will bring him back for Old Trafford even though walking back into a 76,000 full house will be a good test even for someone with his experience. Alisson knows he has a very good team in front of him and his form over the past year has been so good he has credit in the bank if he makes the odd mistake.\n\nSergio Romero will be under pressure to perform because of United's recent poor results\n\nRomero will be under more pressure because of United\u2019s recent results and the general tension around their camp. He has never let United down but rarely plays because of David de Gea. Now the Spaniard\u2019s injury on international duty is set to give him a chance.\n\nThe interesting thing is how both managers go about trying to test the goalkeepers to see if they are rusty. They are more likely to challenge them at set-pieces and backpasses rather than urge the midfielders to shoot from distance.\n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if the first couple of corners and free-kicks are deliberately played closer to the goalkeeper than would be usual and that everyone in the box tries to steam into them, challenge them.\n\nThe first backpass played into Romero or Alisson, expect the opposition forwards to press them fast. It\u2019s an early test to see if they are really ready to play in a huge match like this.\n\nFORM OR FORTUNE?\n\nI\u2019ve done well to get this far without mentioning I scored three winners for Liverpool at Old Trafford.\n\nIt got to the stage where I\u2019d turn up for games against United expecting things to go well, it gave me enormous confidence and well-being against what was the best team in Europe.\n\nIf you\u2019re Anthony Martial, you will be mentally visualising that United debut, against Liverpool at Old Trafford, and the fantastic dribble and finish that sealed a home win.\n\nMohamed Salah will hope to score his first goal against Manchester United at Old Trafford\n\nLogically, Martial isn\u2019t quick enough to trouble Virgil van Dijk and I don\u2019t see him having enough support around him up front. But that mindset is the X Factor.\n\nOn the other hand, Salah has never scored against United, which is a stand-out given he\u2019s been lethal against everyone else. That can become a psychological problem if you\u2019ve struggled against the same team for four or five years, but I don\u2019t think it will affect Salah because it has only been four games and he doesn\u2019t strike me as being short of confidence.\n\nSalah will go out at Old Trafford as convinced as Martial he\u2019s going to score and Liverpool will be set on three points, not because of the record 18th Premier League win, but because they will feel they are better than this United team.\n\nIf the match is drawn, it will be United celebrating a moral victory \u2014 and Liverpool left disappointed.", "description": "Former Liverpool and England star DANNY MURPHY assesses where the match at Old Trafford could be won and lost...", "authors": ["Danny Murphy For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/21/19936618-0-image-a-115_1571518135946.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
