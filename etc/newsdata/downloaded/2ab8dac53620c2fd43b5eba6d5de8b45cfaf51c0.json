(Oct. 16) AP, AP\n\nLONDON \u2013 British lawmakers are set to vote Saturday on Prime Minister Boris Johnson's new withdrawal deal with the European Union, an important moment in the prolonged bid to end the Brexit stalemate and one that could have far-reaching consequences for Brexit, for Johnson and for the trajectory of the country.\n\nJohnson does not command an absolute majority in Britain's 650-seat Parliament and the vote is expected to be extremely close. It is the first time that Parliament has sat on a Saturday in nearly 40 years, and only the fourth time it's done so since World War II.\n\nBritain's media have dubbed the vote \"Super Saturday.\"\n\nAcrimony, divisions, frustration: UK's 3-year Brexit battle nears end but it's not over\n\nAt stake is whether Britain's fractious Parliament will approve a long-delayed exit deal Johnson negotiated with the EU that will enable an orderly departure from the bloc on Oct. 31, a deadline Johnson has repeatedly vowed to honor. Opposition parties and a key parliamentary party in Northern Ireland are expected to vote against it.\n\nLawmakers will spend the day debating the proposed deal. There is no set time yet for the vote, which rebels will try to frustrate or restrict in various ways through amendments, but it's likely to come in the late afternoon local time (mid-morning ET).\n\nAhead of the vote, Johnson urged lawmakers to \"come together\" and claimed his new deal can heal a rift in British politics and society. Rebel lawmakers have already confirmed they will attempt to postpone the vote, potentially upending Johnson's plan.\n\n'Bewildering, disastrous':: Queen has a Brexit escape plan, but how bad will it be?\n\nIf Johnson wins the vote, he will claim victory over a Brexit process that led to the resignation of his two predecessors (David Cameron and Theresa May); bitterly divided British households; and caused deep anxiety among the nation's business community, as well as among millions of EU nationals living in Britain and Britons living in EU nations on the continent. Johnson will go down in history as the British leader who delivered Brexit. Britain would leave the EU in an orderly fashion on Halloween.\n\nIf lawmakers reject the deal, the impact is harder to predict. Johnson will face the humiliation of Brexit unraveling after repeatedly promising that he would get it done by Oct 31. Earlier this year, Parliament passed legislation that compels the prime minister to ask the EU for a Brexit extension to avert a \"no-deal\" Brexit \u2013 a scenario where Britain crashes out of the EU without a formal withdrawal agreement, potentially causing chaos on its borders and shortages of fresh foods and essential medicines.\n\nJohnson could be forced out of office if the deal is rejected. He could resign. An election might be triggered. Opposition parties might try to launch a revolt that ties approval of the new deal to a new national referendum on Brexit and the deal's terms. They may try to delay the vote. Meanwhile, the EU has not committed to granting another extension, even as it wants to avoid a \"no-deal\" Brexit because the EU's economy, security arrangements and other key infrastructure are linked to Britain's.\n\nThe fate of the United Kingdom, made up of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, is also to an extent potentially tied to the outcome of the vote.\n\nScotland\u2019s top government official Nicola Sturgeon, who strongly opposes Brexit, told the Scottish National Party's annual conference this week that the UK's central government in London has \"shattered the case for the union.\" A 2014 Scottish independence vote failed to pass but polls show support has been rising as a result of Brexit and the Institute of Government, a think tank, published a report that concluded that a \"no-deal\" Brexit could bring the 300-year-old union to \"breaking point.\"\n\nStill, the dirty little secret is that Brexit is not complete whatever happens Saturday. In fact, even if Parliament approves the deal and Britain leaves the EU at the end of this month from a legal perspective, the process of Brexit does not end there.\n\nThe agreement that Britain and the EU are trying to get done before Oct. 31 only really establishes the broad rules for a transition period as the two parties negotiate a new relationship on trade, consumer protections, security and more.\n\nSome of the complication related to Brexit is about the status of EU-member Ireland's land border with Northern Ireland, which currently enjoys frictionless trade.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., for example, has threatened to block a free trade deal Britain is hoping to sign with the United States if Britain's EU withdrawal undermines the Good Friday Agreement that ended Northern Ireland's violent conflict.\n\nJohnson's deal is about limiting disruptions while those negotiations take place. The transition period would run to the end of December 2020.\n\nFurther muddying the waters: Polls of polls show average support for staying in the EU among the British public is now almost exactly the opposite of where it was three years ago: 53% to 47% favor the \"Remain\" side. \"Leave\" won the 2016 vote 52% to 48%.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/10/19/brexit-britains-parliament-vote-boris-johnsons-eu-withdrawal-deal/4021403002/", "description": "British lawmakers\u00a0are\u00a0set to vote on Prime Minister Boris Johnson's new European Union exit deal.
