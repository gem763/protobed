My brain is having trouble processing which way is up,\" one person replied.\n\n\"The trees don't even add up,\" one person wrote. But another user replied, \"Clue: trees grow upwards,\" hailing the sheep for their \"incredible\" agility.\n\nAnd, you know, clouds.... \u2014 BroJ (@ldsknack) September 11, 2019\n\nOthers were less sheepish with their response.\n\n\"Look at the clouds. When you turn it sideways the clouds are moving upwards,\" someone said confidently, adding that the video was indeed right side up.\n\nOf course, others weighed in on the weightless-looking animals with a sense of humor, sharing GIFs of Homer Simpson assisting a pig trot across a ceiling.\n\nDespite the debate, there was one thing everyone seemed to agree on.\n\nThese look like goats\ud83e\udd14. \u2014 jdykt (@jdywm) September 11, 2019\n\nWell, almost everyone.", "description": "A biologist posted this mind-bending video of blue sheep scaling a rock surface in China.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/blue-sheep-china-nc-jt-190911_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
