SP is up 16% in 2019. 60/40 portfolio has delivered all the upside with no downside to stocks. 67% of all global tariffs are disadvantageous to US economy. Yet US GDP is growing by 2%+ while rest of developed countries are going negative and have issued $17T in negative rate sovereign debt to prop up their failing economies. tariffs imposed by Trump are leveling the playing field that has been tilted against the US. And by destroying developed economies even more with unnecessary tariffs, that is supposed to help the US how? We live in a global economy. There is a reason that actually smart leaders haven't done this before. And there is no worse time to do it than when we are doing good and the rest of the world is faltering. It's...just...plain...stupid. IMHO, of course :o) Chinese predatory trade practices, barriers to entry, and intellectual property theft have already done serious damage to parts of Europe. China has flooded the markets with various goods to ill effect. Left unchecked, all this will lead to a loss of Western competitive advantage. Before it was Italian clothing, European steel, and Spanish shipyards. In the future it will be high tech, weapons, and passenger jets. The reason why \"smart leaders\" haven't dealt with the problem before is that it's a very tough problem. While the Chinese government doesn't have to worry about elections, Western leaders do. Confronting China almost certainly means accepting short-term economic pain in exchange for possible long-term competitiveness. The West doesn't do \"long term\". I understand the view that Trump's actions are \"stupid\". So, I ask: do you agree or disagree with me about Chinese trade practices? If you agree, what do you propose? N. I do agree to a point, but also know that a lot of it has been agreed to by our companies that wanted to do business there. Intellectual theft goes on all over the world. But yes, they have taken advantage which is in their culture. As for proposing a solution, way above my pay grade. It would take a coordinated effort by every Country that is effected. You don't get there by pissing off every one of our allies. They would have to be really squeezed by more than just the US. I see China as holding most of the cards and we are only chest thumping which will have minimal effect. China could hurt our economy by imposing new restrictions on companies operating in China and limiting their sales. And they could continue to weaken their currency to help offset tariffs. And, of course, they could throw everyone into a panic by selling a lot of their treasuries, preferably just before the election. Nobody likes uncertainty, and particularly the market. No one really knows how this will play out. So it really comes down to politics. If one is pro current administration, then you generally see this as giving the bad guys their due. If not, then you likely see this as folly. But I would be more comfortable if someone other than Colonel Kink was in charge.\n\nBill:\n\nLike everything else you post , you always ignore the historic Parallels which contradict your narrative.\n\nSo you see China as holding most of the cards and we are only chest thumping?\n\n40 years ago the Soviet Union was going to bury us after the US defeat in South Vietnam and stagflation in the US economy because soviet union had 2X the population , larger military and vast reserves of oil that our economy depended on. Soviet Union went out of business on Dec 31, 1991 because it was obsolete.\n\n30 years ago Japan\u2019s economy was going to dominate the global markets because of its highly motivated work force and more efficient means of producing consumer goods such as cars, TVs and stereos for the world markets. Japanese banks were going be the center of the Financial universe with control of the most valuable real estate in the world including Rockefeller Center. The collapse of the Japanese\u2019s real estate bubble in the 90\u2019s sent the country\u2019s economy into a tailspin from which it has never recovered and the current Japanese national debt to GDP ratio is 250%, compared to US ratio of 79%. Japanese GDP grows at 1% per year which requires periodic tax increases. Rockefeller Center was sold back to its former owners for less than they received for selling it.\n\n20 years ago the EU was going to challenge the US for global economic supremacy when euro countries formed an union which had no taxes or tariffs among the members, free access by businesses among members without regulation and a common currency. Today the EU is in shambles with the UK voting to leave, Italy refusing to conform to limits on deficit spending, billions in negative rate bonds issued by EU banks and governments and a malaise in most EU economies because the decline global growth Is shrinking their economies to negative numbers.\n\nAs for Xi ,best response is \u201cGo ahead. Make my day.\u201d", "description": "Sept. starts off with continued volatility. Until Trump settles this trade war, we will continue to be hampered by this \"war\".
