It was not immediately clear what purpose the QR codes served, and possible they could be a unique design for the 70th anniversary. US service members do not use QR codes on their uniforms but have Velcro tabs to affix markings, including the US flag and service branch, primarily for identification purposes.\n\nRead more: China just showed off a new missile that could slip past US defenses at more than five times the speed of sound\n\nsource CCTV\n\nQR codes have been pervasive in China with the advent of third-party payment apps like Alipay, and social media apps like WeChat. Chinese shoppers have increasingly opted to purchase goods from retail stores and even street vendors with their cell phones to scan QR codes, rather than using a physical card or cash.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s new payment system exploded in under a decade, growing from inception to dominance,\u201d a study from the Center on Regulations and Markets from The Brookings Institution said. \u201cWith over a billion users on each platform, the power of network incentives has been unleashed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe new payment system has replaced cards and cash at registers, how families give gifts, and even how beggars ask for money, with QR codes replacing tin cups,\u201d the study added.\n\nChina\u2019s intense focus on surveilling and identifying its 1.4 billion citizens continues to ramp up in recent years. The Global Times, one of China\u2019s state-sponsored publications, claims that facial recognition systems have an accuracy rate of 99.8% and can identify people in seconds. The system has become commonplace in certain pockets of the country, sparking privacy and human rights concerns.\n\nDuring the military parade, Chinese service members marched in goose-step and displayed their equipment as Chinese President Xi Jinping looked on at Tiananmen Square. Roughly 15,000 troops, 160 aircraft, and 580 pieces of military equipment were paraded for the 70th anniversary of the country\u2019s founding, according to Ministry of Defense spokesman Maj. Gen. Cai Zhijun, the Associated Press reported.\n\nThe military debuted some of its newer arms, including the Dongfeng-41 intercontinental ballistic missile, which purportedly could travel 9,320 miles and can reach the US in 30 minutes.", "description": "Business Insider - Chinese shoppers are used to buying items with QR codes instead of cash.
