It\u2019s also a dense stack of ruins layered on top of one another that stretch back more than 3,000 years, and is recognised by Unesco as a World Heritage site.\n\nWhen walking into the old town, the twisting streets of 19th-Century fishing houses are parted by the medieval Church of St Stephen \u2013 richly decorated with murals of Jesus calming the storm and 1,000 figures from the New Testament \u2013 and the excavated ruins of the Stara Mitropolia Basilica, a cathedral dating back to the 5th Century when this was one of the most important Byzantine trading towns on the Black Sea coast.\n\nArchaeologists and local fishermen have found even older relics. A Greek acropolis and pottery date from before the Romans\u2019 arrival, and there are walls built by the city\u2019s founders, the Thracians, the horse-riding warrior people who ruled over the Balkan Peninsula more than 2,000 years ago.\n\nBut to find the most surprising artefacts, you\u2019ll need to step off the island and into the surrounding sea.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n\u2022 A $20bn treasure lost at sea\n\n\u2022 The key to the origin of the Americas?\n\n\u2022 The sinful city swallowed by the Earth\n\nRecent oceanographic research efforts using a pair of underwater remote operated vehicles (ROVs) has ventured below the Black Sea waters and revealed pieces of ancient history never before seen in such vivid resolution. These submarine missions have discovered ships from several millennia of seafaring trade and war, including the world\u2019s oldest intact shipwreck: a Greek trading ship from around 400BC lying uncannily well-preserved on the seabed.\n\nAnd among the wrecks, new evidence offers clues from more than 7,000 years ago, when some experts believe the Black Sea was just a small freshwater lake. Geological samples drilled from the seabed could, at last, settle the mystery of whether it was here that waters once rushed in, flattening civilisations and leaving behind the story we know as Noah and the great biblical flood.\n\nZdravka Georgieva, maritime archaeologist at Bulgaria\u2019s Centre for Underwater Archaeology in nearby Sozopol, was born on Nessebar and learned to dive in the shallows of the Black Sea. \u201cI really wanted to know what is beneath, what is under the water,\u201d said Georgieva, who first heard about the unexplored remnants of old settlements and shipwrecks at the small Nessebar Archaeological Museum, which holds a smattering of historical artefacts. \u201cI knew from the museum, and from people here, as a teenage girl, that there are historical monuments down there and I wanted to touch them and to observe them really closely.\u201d\n\nAfter studying at the University of Southampton\u2019s Marine Archaeology postgraduate centre in the UK, Georgieva has been working in her \u201cdream job\u201d as part of the Black Sea Maritime Archaeology Project (Black Sea MAP), which aims to discover how the sea and its surroundings have changed since the last ice age by surveying the seabed.\n\nThe Anglo-Bulgarian team, led by Prof Jon Adams from the University of Southampton, in partnership with the Centre for Underwater Archaeology, discovered the 2,400-year-old Greek trading ship last year, in addition to more than 60 wrecks found in deep waters.\n\nAppearing into view as the ROVs 3D-scanned the site, the ancient ship was lying on its side, the mast and rudder clearly visible as well as rowing benches and large ceramic containers in the hold. Georgieva called it \u201cthe most spectacular find \u2013 so far.\u201d\n\nGeorgieva agrees with other marine archaeologists that we are entering a golden age of discovery around the Black Sea.\n\nArchaeologists had known that ancient civilisations had been built here and that ships had traded along the Black Sea coastline. But, until now, imaging technology was not yet advanced enough to provide a true picture of the bottom of the sea, ensuring that anything that lay down there remained shrouded in mystery.\n\n\u201cWe knew from historical sources that there had been colonisation of the Black Sea coast, from Greece, from the Mediterranean, but we hadn\u2019t discovered anything like ships. Why? Where are they? What are the reasons we hadn\u2019t found them?\u201d Georgieva asked. \u201cThe last four years was a really big step... in how we investigate the submerged landscapes and shipwrecks.\u201d\n\nThe fact that remarkably preserved ships can be found here is due to a unique aquatic phenomenon, explained famed deep-sea explorer Dr Bob Ballard.\n\nThe last four years was a really big step in how we investigate the submerged landscapes and shipwrecks\n\nBallard, the American oceanographer best known internationally as the man who led the discovery of the wreck of the Titanic in 1985, has had a decades-long fascination with the so-called \u201canoxic sea\u201d below the Black Sea: a cold, dead, oxygenless layer blanketed underneath the warm opal waters familiar to visitors.\n\n\u201cI was interested in the anoxia: when I found the Titanic, and we went inside, and saw high states of preservation \u2013 the deep sea is a giant museum,\u201d said Ballard in a phone interview from his home in the US state of Rhode Island. As only a few types of bacteria survive in the Black Sea\u2019s anoxic layer, this stasis is strongest here \u2013 potentially mummifying human remains and preserving the moments after a disaster in \u201cmint condition\u201d for millennia.\n\nBetween 1999 and 2014, Ballard led an expedition to the Black Sea and the Mediterranean that was the first to comprehensively explore this shadow realm. With his crew, he discovered dozens of perfectly preserved vessels, including an Ottoman trading ship that contained human remains.\n\n\u201cIt was a good 15-year effort of mounting multiple expeditions, trying to show that the [ancient mariners were] much bolder than historians were giving them credit for \u2013 that they pursued direct deep-water trade routes, trying to show that they did not hug the coastline, but chose to go across open ocean.\u201d\n\nBut both Georgieva and Ballard said deep-sea exploration provides new clues in another, perhaps even greater, mystery.\n\nIn the bestselling 2000 book Noah's Flood by William Ryan and Walter Pitman, marine geologists believed they had found the historical origin of the legends of a great flood that tore through ancient civilisations bordering the Mediterranean and Black Sea 7,600 years ago. Earlier told in the Babylonian creation myth, the Enuma Elish, and in the Mesopotamian Epic of Gilgamesh, the story has become best known across the world in the form told in the biblical story of Noah\u2019s Ark.\n\nAccording to Ryan and Pitman, about 20,000 ago, what is now the Black Sea was cut off from the Mediterranean by a mountainous landscape.\n\nThe Noah\u2019s Flood theory claimed that as Earth\u2019s last ice age ended, melting polar ice caps caused the Mediterranean waters to rise, which pushed a channel through the mountains to form what is now the Bosporus, resulting in a catastrophic seawater deluge 200 times stronger than Niagara Falls. In months, it estimated, the Black Sea inundated a land mass the size of Ireland, flooding a mile a day.\n\nI think you\u2019re going to see the Black Sea yielding a lot of additional chapters of human history now we know where to look\n\nBallard, in 2000, hoped to shed light on Ryan and Pitman\u2019s theory, when he discovered the pre-flood shoreline, and buildings from human civilisations that lived along it, 12 miles off the Turkish Black Sea coast. He believed these findings would back up the flood hypothesis.\n\nBut Black Sea MAP points in a different direction, explained Georgieva. \u201cThe geophysicists and other specialists from the oceanographic centre in Southampton, say there\u2019s no evidence to support this theory,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we collected doesn\u2019t prove this catastrophic flood. Data shows a more likely gradual sea level rising.\u201d\n\nWith more data to be analysed, it supports the idea that the waters rose unnoticeably, by metres over centuries, even millennia.\n\nStill, Ballard calls The Black Sea a \u201cmagical place\u201d, an area with \u201can amazing amount of history\u201d, which has more to offer archaeologists and fans of historical legend than the Noah\u2019s Flood connection. \u201cThe Black Sea has that [the biblical connection]; it\u2019s also were Jason and the Argonauts went in search of the Golden Fleece,\u201d he added. \u201cThere\u2019s so much more to be discovered in the Black Sea. I think you\u2019re going to see the Black Sea yielding a lot of additional chapters of human history now we know where to look and how to look.\u201d\n\nFor locals and visitors, the excitement being revealed offshore does not feel far away.\n\nBulgaria hosts a richness of archaeological history from Roman, Greek and other ancient societies, the likes of which tourists often seek out in Mediterranean neighbours, Italy and Greece. But here, findings are being unearthed in an accelerated process, especially since 2007 when funding started arriving with Bulgaria\u2019s accession to the European Union.\n\nNessebar sits on a stretch of coast slightly more than 100km by car from the Bulgarian city of Varna in the north, and nearly 70km from the peninsula of Sozopol in the south, where dense history is laying the foundations for an emerging Bulgarian archaeological trail.\n\nIn 2012, nearby Solnitsata, labelled Europe's oldest prehistoric town (albeit controversially) by its discoverers, joined already discovered marvels to the north of Nessebar such as the Varna Necropolis, the oldest gold treasure in the world dating from around 4,500BC, many years before the pyramids of Egypt.\n\nWhile the Black Sea MAP discoveries are too deep for tourists to visit, scuba diving excursions head down to Nessebar\u2019s original defensive walls from the time of the Thracians, and battleships from World War One and World War Two, as well as the airplane of former Bulgarian Communist leader Todor Zhivkov, which was deliberately sunk in Varna Bay in 2011 to spawn an artificial reef.\n\nTo get a sense of what is out at sea, Georgieva recommends that divers visit what she calls the \u201copen museum\u201d of Nessebar\u2019s fortifications, the exposed walls visible on the short walk around the edge of the island, along with similar ruins in Sozopol.\n\nBut the discoveries made by the Black Sea MAP team are also being brought up into the light, and are currently on show in Lost Worlds, an exhibition touring Bulgaria where visitors can explore a digital recreation of the 2,400-year-old shipwreck and 3D printed models made from scans of it while wearing virtual reality headsets.\n\nSunken Civilisation is a BBC Travel series that explores mythical underwater worlds that seem too fantastical to exist today but are astonishingly real.\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"The Essential List\".
