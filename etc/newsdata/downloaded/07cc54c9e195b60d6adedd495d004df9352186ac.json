John Lewis (D-Ga.) on Tuesday joined mounting calls for President Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment, warning in a passionate speech on the House floor that the U.S., once a \u201cbeacon of hope,\u201d may be \u201cdescending into darkness.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt keeps me up at night,\u201d he said. \u201cWe took an oath to protect this nation against all domestic enemies and foreign enemies. Sometimes I\u2019m afraid to go to sleep for fear I will wake up and our democracy will be gone \u2015 and never return.\u201d\n\nLewis shamed the Trump administration for showing a \u201ccomplete disdain and disregard for ethics, for the law and for the Constitution.\u201d\n\nHe referred to revelations that Trump may have pressured the president of Ukraine to conduct an investigation that would include a focus on former Vice President Joe Biden, Trump\u2019s possible Democratic opponent as he seeks a second term in 2020.\n\n\u201cThe people have a right to know whether they can put their faith and trust in the outcome of our election,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cThey have a right to know whether the cornerstone of our democracy was been undermined by people sitting in the White House today.\u201d\n\nThe controversy over Trump\u2019s conversation in a July phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky has intensified the push for the House to launch an impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cI believe, I truly believe, the time to begin impeachment proceedings against this president has come,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cTo delay or to do otherwise would betray the foundation of our democracy.\u201d\n\n.@repjohnlewis calls for impeachment proceedings: \"We took an oath to protect this nation against all domestic enemies...

Pelosi reportedly now has decided that an impeachment inquiry will be launched.\n\nOn Monday night, seven freshmen House Democrats who represent swing districts voiced their support for an impeachment inquiry in a Washington Post op-ed. More than 150 House lawmakers are now in agreement that the time has come for the process to begin.\n\nThe Post and The Wall Street Journal have reported that Trump, in his July call, allegedly asked about eight times for Zelensky to partner with Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, in a corruption probe of Biden\u2019s son, Hunter. Trump also reportedly wanted Ukraine officials to look into whether Biden, while serving as vice president, sought to shield his son from a corruption probe.\n\nTrump has defended his conversation with Zelensky, claiming it was completely appropriate. He announced on Tuesday that he would release a transcript of the call.\n\nNo evidence of any wrongdoing by the Bidens has emerged.", "description": "The Georgia lawmaker and civil right legend blasts the Trump administration for a \"complete disdain\" for the Constitution.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8a491224000057007ca67e.jpeg?cache=wgutatfkhe&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
