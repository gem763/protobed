This included general-purpose hot works such as welding or gas cutting.\n\nAbout 40 fires were burning across NSW on Monday morning, mostly centred in the north-east. All remained on Monday morning at the lowest alert level.\n\nShocked scientists find 400km of dead and damaged mangroves in Gulf of Carpentaria Read more\n\nOn Sunday a NSW Rural Fire Service spokesman said warm and windy conditions were likely to extend into Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s severe all through the north-east, getting up to extreme in the north-western area,\u201d Grace Legge, a Bureau of Meteorology forecaster, said.\n\n\u201cBut really the whole entire north-east part from the Greater Hunter to the far north coast are expected to be severe today.\n\n\u201cIf records are broken it will be early season records \u2013 the warmest we\u2019ve seen it this early in spring.\u201d\n\nLegge said the conditions were due to a warm, dry air mass and high winds affecting northern NSW primarily, but pushing into Queensland. That state\u2019s weather would peak on Tuesday.\n\nGrafton was forecast to reach 38C on Monday, with temperatures pushing 40C across the north-west slopes and plains, and warnings for possible dust. Bourke, which reached 40C on Sunday, was expecting 37C on Monday. Several areas set new October heat records at the weekend.\n\nOn Sunday a meteorologist, Jake Phillips, said the bureau was particularly concerned by conditions to the west of the Great Dividing Range.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite unusual to see temperatures this warm,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cIn large areas of the state we\u2019re seeing daytime temperatures between 8C and 12C above average for this time of the year, and in some places more.\u201d\n\nThe heat was expected to shift further north on Monday, the bureau said.\n\nLarge swathes of NSW at bushfires risk as temperatures set to reach 40C Read more\n\n\u201cBroadly, across that north-eastern quarter of the state [on Monday] we\u2019re looking at a number of places currently forecast to reach early-season [heat] records,\u201d a forecaster, Gabrielle Woodhouse, said.\n\nQueensland\u2019s south-east regions, plus the northern Goldfields, upper Flinders and Cape York Peninsula were under very high or severe fire danger ratings for Monday.\n\nThe bureau warned the severe fire dangers forecast for the Darling downs, granite belt, Maranoa and Warrego districts had the potential to see localised extreme conditions in the southern forested areas.\n\nLong-running fire bans remain in place across south-east Queensland and up to Rockhampton and across the central highlands.\n\nFresh and gusty westerly winds were expected to bring hot and dry conditions across the area, with temperatures of 40C predicted for parts of the south-east including Ipswich, and high 30s for nearly every where outside of the central coast, Herbert and lower Burdekin, and north tropical coast and tablelands.\n\nThe temperatures were predicted to soar more than 10C above average: Brisbane faces 36C on Tuesday, the warmest October day since 2005 if it happens.\n\nThe conditions would be worse than September, the bureau said, when large bushfires tore through the Scenic Rim and Sunshine Coast. However, a cold front was expected to come through the south-west about midnight on Monday.", "description": "Total fire bans and severe and extreme danger ratings in place in northwest NSW and southeast Queensland", "authors": ["Helen Davidson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f590d6d17a880963c5aa4de20e89a6bd034ca28/254_0_5769_3463/master/5769.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6bddc9c26de1086adcfcb61eba86c4f9", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
