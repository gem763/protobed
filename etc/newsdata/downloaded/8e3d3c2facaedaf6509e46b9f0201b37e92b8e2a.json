Without missing a beat, Anna replies \u201c$15m\u201d, the actual amount Roberts was paid to do the movie, a rare example of when an actress has earned more than her male counterpart \u2013 in this case, Hugh Grant. For a real scandal in acting has always been the huge gender pay gap.\n\nNow a team of economists has determined the width of that gap: male Hollywood stars earn $1.1m more per film than their similarly experienced female co-stars.\n\nSofia Izquierdo Sanchez, of Huddersfield University, John S Heywood, of Wisconsin University, and Maria Navarro Paniagua, of Lancaster University, analysed the wages of 246 male and female actors who featured in 1,343 films between 1980 and 2015. \u201cThe gap has been quite persistent,\u201d Izquierdo Sanchez said. \u201cIt is almost the same in 2015 as it was in 1980. It doesn\u2019t show any signs of improving.\u201d\n\nFilm data was mined from several sources, including the IMDb and Box Office Mojo websites, which track box office revenues and carry the latest film news. The economists factored in several variables, including a star\u2019s past success based on box-office receipts, awards won and popularity on Twitter. When these factors were stripped out, it showed female stars were paid 56% less than their male counterparts \u2013 the equivalent of $2.2m less per film.\n\n\u201cWe were thinking that we would find a gap, because so many actresses have been bringing the issue up,\u201d Izquierdo Sanchez said. \u201cBut we were surprised to find so much of a gap, especially as we were talking about actors of the highest level, like Meryl Streep.\u201d\n\nTheir work, presented at the annual congress of the European Economic Association in Manchester last month, found action films, which claimed seven of the top 10 worldwide grossing movies of 2018, were particularly poor at closing the gap: male stars were paid more than $1.8m more than female stars. The gap was present across all genres, even in romcoms, which Izquierdo Sanchez said was perplexing, given that \u201cactors and actresses should generally play similar levels and do exactly the same roles\u201d.\n\nThe research also found the gap grew with age, something that Izquierdo Sanchez attributed to \u201cthe beauty value of the market\u201d. From childhood to middle age, it remained at about $1m, but when stars turned 50 it increased to an average of just under $4m per film.\n\nIzquierdo Sanchez said that as Hollywood was a \u201cbig cultural influence\u201d and an industry that employed more than two million people, the presence of a stubborn pay gap was troubling. \u201cIf it cannot be explained by the actors or actresses\u2019 performances or popularity, then the gap could, of course, be related to sexism,\u201d she said. However, the study also suggests that \u201cproducer bias cannot be completely eliminated as among the potential causes\u201d.\n\nThe gender pay issue has become a major battleground, with leading actresses shaming the industry for its failure to take action. Patricia Arquette made headlines in 2015 when, in her Oscars speech, she called for \u201cwage equality once and for all\u201d. A-listers including Streep, Charlize Theron, Jennifer Lawrence and Natalie Portman have also called for \u201cequal pay for an equal job\u201d.\n\nThere was an outcry when Vanity Fair reported that, on the film American Hustle, the three main stars, Christian Bale, Bradley Cooper and Amy Adams, each worked for similar amounts of time \u2013 about 45 days\u2019 filming. But while Bale and Cooper earned $2.5m each and commanded 9% of the profits, Adams earned $1.25m and 7% of the profits.\n\nThe Forbes list of 2019\u2019s highest paid stars reveals Scarlett Johansson was paid $56m while Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson was paid $89.4m.\n\nThe study\u2019s authors suggest one way to close the gap would be for stars\u2019 contracts to be made public, strengthening negotiating positions and highlighting poor levels of pay in the film industry, something even the comically ignorant Bernie appreciates. As he responds when Anna tells him that she was paid $15m for her last film: \u201cSo that\u2019s fairly good.\u201d", "description": "Disparity is almost the same in 2015 as in 1980, say researchers who call for contracts to be made public", "authors": ["Jamie Doward"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f195012790f9c5e3859ca48932b2b347accf3a5/0_50_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1443296e5535591588cf7a75df5e4958", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
