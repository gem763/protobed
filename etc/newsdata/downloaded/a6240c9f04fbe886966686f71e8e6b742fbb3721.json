Some surveys have him back down in the thirties and the head-to-head matchups against the Democratic frontrunners don\u2019t have him being able to beat anyone but Elizabeth Warren. (That doesn\u2019t mean he couldn\u2019t still win in the electoral college, but the popular vote would be a trainwreck if these forecasts proved true.) So what can the President do about it?\n\nOver at National Review, Conrad Black has a suggestion. He points out that Trump has really come through on many of his campaign promises and delivered some results. And if the economy manages to avoid a recession for another fourteen months, there\u2019s little reason that he couldn\u2019t secure a second term. But what he needs to do in order to assure that, at least in Black\u2019s opinion, is abandon some of his more incendiary tactics and start acting a little more presidential.\n\nIf the president can become a bit more presidential, his reelection will be all but assured. This is the time for President Trump to deprive his enemies of the last weapon that could be employed against him that could cause him any harm: the largely false, but still troublesome, issue of his personality and routine behavior\u2026 It does the president no favors to pretend that there are not still a significant number of people who have an uneasy feeling that although his administration is in policy terms quite successful, and the president has faithfully tried to carry out most of what he promised in the raucous 2016 election campaign, he is yet too bombastic and evidently egocentric to maintain the dignity of his great office. This is a widely held view, even among many who support the president for his policy successes and the well-conceived initiatives that are still in the balance, especially trade and other negotiations with China, and the attempted revival of nuclear non-proliferation in respect of Iran and North Korea.\n\nThe author goes on to point to people such as Peggy Noonan (a frequent Trump critic these days) who he believes would warm to the President and rally to his defense if he abandoned his \u201cbellicosity toward his opponents, and his tendency to be nasty and personal towards them.\u201d He also points to Donald Trump\u2019s apparent need to respond to any perceived slight or insinuation, offering the \u201csharpie map\u201d showing the recent hurricane threatening Alabama as an example.\n\nWhile I find Conrad Black a solid thinker, allow me to completely disagree in this case. I\u2019m assuming that the phrase \u201cmore presidential\u201d means acting more like all the other presidents who preceded Trump in recent history. This, in my opinion, would be a disaster for Donald Trump.\n\nYou see, all of these perceived faults being pointed out \u2013 and I\u2019ll admit that some of them put me off from time to time also \u2013 are precisely who he is. That\u2019s the person America elected. They all saw him at his many rallies both before and after the election, pounding his fist on the lectern, pointing his finger, railing against his opponents even as he poured praise on his allies. He was a disruptive force in a political world many had grown skeptical of, filled with cookie-cutter politicians who spoke and acted the same, analyzing every word in every speech to the nth degree, just to ensure they didn\u2019t offend anyone.\n\nAnd now you want Donald Trump to turn into just another Washington politician?\n\nTrump needs to keep (and if possible, grow) the support of the people who sent him to office. And all of the bombast and abrasive rhetoric is part and parcel of what they signed on for. They wanted a fighter, even if he fights dirty some of the time.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the other factor I believe Conrad is overlooking. In terms of nearly all of Trump\u2019s critics who gnash their teeth over his \u201cunpresidential behavior,\u201d it wouldn\u2019t matter one bit. Nothing will be forgiven if Trump suddenly undergoes a personality transplant overnight. He will still be the Bad Orange Man and they will find reasons to shout about everything he does. No amount of \u201cbetter behavior\u201d is going to change that.\n\nFor better or worse, Trump is being himself and that\u2019s the man who was improbably elected in 2016. If a different, more milquetoast Trump shows up for the 2020 race, I wouldn\u2019t bet a plug nickel on him.", "description": "That ship has already sailed, friend", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/TrumpAngryFingerPt715.jpg"}
