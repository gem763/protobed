The Ministry of Justice must implement its new reforms without delay,' Plaid Cymru MP Liz Saville-Roberts said after harvesting the data through a series of parliamentary questions.\n\nA victims rights campaigner, Harry Fletcher, said the data 'defies belief'.\n\nLeroy Campbell, 57, (left) was released from prison four months before he raped and killed Lisa Skidmore, 37, (right) in Bilston, West Midlands in November of 2016\n\nHe added: 'Yet again, victims are ignored by the criminal justice system.'\n\nChief executive of Refuge, a national domestic abuse charity, Sandra Horley CBE said the 'statistics should serve as a wake up call to politicians and the criminal justice system'.\n\nShe added how women and children are most at risk with ex-partners who have a violent record.\n\nMs Horley said: 'Two women per week in England and Wales are killed by their current or former partner. Reform is desperately needed. Women's lives depend on it.'\n\nActing co-chief executive of Women's Aid Adina Clare said the findings show the 'scale of the challenge' within the system and having a safe probation response to domestic abuse cases can be 'a matter of life or death'.\n\nShe added: 'Early releases of offenders, particularly when a victim is not provided with robust safeguards and ongoing support, can and do put women at further risk.\n\nAlex (left) was beaten by Iheanacho (right) with such ferocity that witnesses who overheard 'booming' blows thought two men were fighting, before they heard the boy begging for mercy\n\nOne attacker who slipped through the net was Leroy Campbell, 57, who was released from prison four months prior to attacking Lisa Skidmore, 37, in her home in Bilston, West Midlands, in November of 2016.\n\nThe convicted rapist, who was on probation at the time, raped and murdered Lisa before attempting to kill her mother, Margaret Skidmore, 81, by choking her.\n\nCampbell, from Moseley in Birmingham, had been watching Lisa for weeks - after chillingly telling his probation officer that he 'felt like raping' someone again.\n\nThis was the second missed opportunity to recall Campbell, as he told his probation officer just after his release he had troubling thoughts - the same type he would get before attacking a woman.\n\nMarvyn Iheanacho, 41, flew into a violent rage and beat his girlfriend's son, five, to death after the youngster lost his shoe in a park in Catford, south east, in November 2016.\n\nThe victim's mother Liliya Breha claimed probation officers did not warn her that Marvyn Iheanacho was banned from contacting children before he fatally attacked her son Alex Malcolm.\n\n\n\nThe inquest at Southwark Corner's Court heard Iheanacho had a string of previous convictions for assaulting girlfriends dating back to 2001.\n\nThese included him punching a girlfriend aged 19, striking another with a hammer, punching a girlfriend unconscious in 2012 because she refused to lend a phone, breaking her jaw.\n\nHe also throttled a partner in 2014 and in 2015 was jailed for whipping a girlfriend and grabbing her by the throat.", "description": "Shocking figures reveal one in five murders are committed by people on parole.
