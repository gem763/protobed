'It's not fake.'\n\nHuge fan: Melinda Rodriguez shared with Taylor that her brother Chris was her biggest fan\n\nMelinda shared with them that Cris was then in the hospital awaiting his second heart transplant, which left both of the women stunned.\n\n'Like now?' Kelly asked. 'Why are you here? Let's get done so you can leave.'\n\n'That's what I said,' Melinda recalled.\n\nHelping out: Kelly Clarkson teamed up with Taylor as they worked with her singers\n\n'It's group hug time,' Taylor suggested, throwing her arm around Melinda. 'It's group hug o'clock.'\n\nMelinda, however, had a special reason for staying, saying that Chris wouldn't let her go home.\n\n'Literally, he said, ''You can't leave, because what if it's Taylor Swift?'',' she revealed, as her coach and mentor gasped.\n\nThe mentors: Gwen Stefani, Kelly, John Legend and Blake Shelton were serving as the coaches on season 17 of the NBC singing competition show\n\n'Shut up,' Taylor said.\n\n'The song definitely goes out to my brother, because to see Taylor there today, when he's undergoing heart surgery, I just thought, ''How is this happening?'',' an emotional Melinda noted.\n\n'Cris has to wake up, because there is no way I can't tell him about this. That'd be the world's biggest injustice.'\n\nStacked team: Kelly went into the Knockouts with Jake Hoot, Alex Guthrie, Hello Sunday, Kiara Brown, Damali, Melinda, Gracee Shriver and Shane Q\n\n'He was like, ''Don't be selfish, you're doing this for me, not for you'',' she told Taylor.\n\n'Can you tell us an address for where we can send him some gifts?' Taylor asked her.\n\n'Absolutely,' Melinda affirmed.\n\nFor the knockouts, Melinda chose to sing Mariah Carey's Always Be My Baby, which she and Cris used to jam out to in the car.\n\nTough pairing: Country singer Jake Coot stood with host Carson Daly and Melinda as the Knockouts were underway\n\nTaylor and Kelly recommended that Melinda start with the chorus, which Taylor agreed made it 'more powerful.'\n\n'Artists need to put their spin on things, but at the same time, my entire contribution to music has just been the hooks I wrote, so my instinct is to be like, ''Save it'',' Taylor said. 'Can we save the mystery, please?'\n\nIn the live knockouts, Kelly went with Jake, who sang Jason Isbell's Cover Me Up, which he felt was about finding someone after losing love.\n\nPure country: In the live knockouts, Kelly went with Jake, who sang Jason Isbell's Cover Me Up, which he felt was about finding someone after losing love\n\nShe called him 'one of the best country singers' she'd ever heard on the show, adding that she would be shocked if he didn't make the finale.\n\nIn an update afterward, Melinda said that Cris was recovering well.\n\nTaylor was excited to be back, admiring the coaches' passion for their work and saying: 'I wanted to come on this show because when I was here before I had a really good time.'\n\nPassionate coaches: Taylor was excited to work with passionate coaches such as Gwen and John\n\nHer new title was exciting, too: 'I didn't realize I was going to be called a 'mega-mentor'',' she added. 'That's gonna go straight to my head. I would like a latte right now.'\n\nTaylor snapped her fingers to get that latte, saying: 'No one? Glass of wine?'\n\nBefore she appeared for the knockouts, the coaches ran through their final battle rounds.\n\nFor the first set, judge Gwen Stefani, 50, paired her two rockers: Caroline Reilly, 16, from Cumming, Georgia, and Jake HaldenVang, 24, from Fort Mill, South Carolina.\n\nExpert advice: Taylor helped Gwen prepare her singers for the Knockouts\n\nShe had them do Pink's Just Like a Pill, which allowed both of them to belt out lyric and their advisor Will.i.am, 44, urged them to do it with conviction.\n\n'I'll record Jake's album right now, regardless if he wins or loses,' the rapper vowed, impressed with him. 'This dude is the s***.'\n\nBoth contestants played extensively outside the show, as Jake had gone on tour with his musician father throughout the Southeast and Caroline gigged back home as part of a duo.\n\nIt showed in their easy performance, which wowed all of the judges.\n\n'We don't have anyone like Jake on this show,' Kelly opined. 'We don't have anyone like you on the radio, 'cause rock is like, dead.'\n\nExperienced singer: Jake HaldenVang won his battle round to stay on Gwen's team\n\n'I rock,' interjected judge Blake Shelton, 42.\n\n'Uh-huh,' Kelly laughed. 'That's what your mom says.'\n\nGwen chose Jake, impressed with his confidence and experience, and calling the battle 'the tip of the iceberg' when it came to his talent.\n\nJohn Legend, 40, then paired his team's two baritones on James Taylor's Fire And Rain.\n\nTough squad: John went into the Knockouts with James Violet, Will Breman, Katie Kadan, Marybeth Byrd, Zoe Upkins, Khalea Lynee, Preston C.

Howell, 15.\n\nJohn's adviser, the singer Usher, 41, urged the men to get intimate with the song, and really show who they were while performing it.\n\n'Show strength and sweetness, you know?' John said. 'I want you to throw it off a little more.'\n\nAfter their delicate performance, he went with Preston, who reminded him of himself as a teen.\n\nTwo baritones: Mendeleyev and Preston C. Howell were paired together by John\n\n'It made me believe that there were more places I could go with Preston,' John explained.\n\nIn brief clips, Blake and Gwen were shown making other key decisions for their teams.\n\nBlake chose Nashville's Ricky Braddy, 25, over New Orleans' Jordan Chase, 19, after hearing them sing Lee Brice's Rumor, saying that Ricky had the experience and confidence he needed.\n\nCountry star: Blake chose Nashville's Ricky Braddy, 25, over New Orleans' Jordan Chase, 19, after hearing them sing Lee Brice's Rumor\n\nStrong performance: Ricky, right, was named the winner of the Battle Round by Blake\n\nIn choosing between two Nashville contestants, Gwen picked Calvin Lockett, 25, over Brennen Henson, 20, saying his version of Coldplay's Yellow made her more curious about his skills.\n\nKelly also had a tough choice when faced with the Atlanta-based teen group Hello Sunday, which she paired against Lauren Hall, from West Hollywood, on Miley Cyrus' Wrecking Ball.\n\nAs the youngest contestants every to appear on The Voice, Hello Sunday's Myla Finks, 14, and Chelsea Glover, 13, 'were very prepared,' Kelly's advisor, Normani, 23, noticed.\n\nCuriosity piqued: In choosing between two Nashville contestants, Gwen picked Calvin Lockett, 25, over Brennen Henson, 20, saying his version of Coldplay's Yellow made her more curious about his skills\n\n'I was chubby with braces at 13 and 14,' Lauren, 25, marveled. 'And they are on a national TV show. It's intimidating.'\n\nNormani got 'powerhouse' Lauren to dial it down, creating a quiet intensity to her voice.\n\nKelly was looking for someone who could manage the intimacy of the song as well as the 'big bold moments,' and all of the young women gave an emotional performance onstage.\n\nIdol winner: Kelly also had a tough choice when faced with the Atlanta-based teen group Hello Sunday, which she paired against Lauren Hall, from West Hollywood, on Miley Cyrus' Wrecking Ball\n\nJohn said that what Hello Sunday did 'wasn't as technically sound as what Lauren did but the fireworks were like, ''Ah!''\n\n'You know, I have a daughter who's three,' he added, referring to Luna Simone. 'And I always look for girls that will inspire her, and I would love her to watch you two sing together.'\n\n'My son is 13,' Gwen said. 'I cannot even imagine him being able to stand still this long.'\n\nTeenage son: Gwen pointed out that she had a 13-year-old son after watching teens Hello Sunday perform\n\nStrong voice: Lauren Hall unleashed her strong voice during the battle\n\nKelly chose Hello Sunday.\n\nBlake then stole Lauren, who'd tried out for the show for seven years, and thought she was on her way out, which made Kelly run over and leap into his arms, hugging him.\n\n'I love you, Blake!' Kelly cried.\n\nThe winners: Hello Sunday was named the winner by Kelly\n\nSweet steal: Blake swooped in to steal Lauren\n\nBig hug: Kelly rushed over to hug Blake after he stole Lauren keeping her on the show\n\nAs the battles wrapped, the coaches got ready for the knockout rounds with Taylor.\n\nThe Lover singer's first assignment on the show was to work with Blake, and she'd known him the longest, she observed.\n\n'I actually rediscovered a diary recently, and it was like, ''I met Blake Shelton! He was so nice'',' she admitted. 'And I was 15.'\n\n'Man, that must have been years ago, if I was still nice,' Blake rejoined.\n\n'Yeah,' Taylor cracked. 'I must've not understood humor. You were probably just making fun of me the whole time.'\n\nOld friends: Taylor revealed that she knew Blake the longest of all the judges\n\nBlake started by pairing 'dynamic' Marina Chello, 37, from Uzbekistan, with Cali Wilson, 28, from Salem, Iowa.\n\nAs Cali slung her guitar, made by Taylor Guitars, over her neck, Blake teased: 'Oh, there's that company that you owned: Taylor Guitars.'\n\nTaylor said she'd never owned the company, to which Blake replied: 'I read that you did.'\n\n'I know,' Taylor replied. 'But you can read a lot of stuff about me that's not true.'\n\nIn a video, Cali said she grew up in a small town where no one knew she was gay, and that music had been an 'escape' for her.\n\nSmall town: Cali Wilson won after she performed her version of Chris Isaak's Wicked Game\n\nHer version of Chris Isaak's Wicked Game was very 'internal,' Blake pointed out.\n\n'When you're singing\u2026 there's something that has to go on behind your eyes,' Taylor offered.\n\n'It's like disbelief, shock, hurt, betrayal. Let that be expressed and read on your face.'\n\nMarina picked I (Who Have Nothing) by Tom Jones in honor of her father, a former singer, and Taylor called her rehearsal 'a flawless vocal performance.'\n\nShe suggested that Marina stop making 'emotional karate chops' with her hands while singing, and instead move forward, imploring the audience.\n\nBlake struggled to pronounce the name of Marina's home country, and Taylor teased him: 'You know, that's like a pretty normal country that most people know the name of.'\n\nUzbekistan singer: Marina Chello belted out a Tom Jones song in honor of her father\n\n'Really?' Blake asked. 'Wonder how I've made it this many years.'\n\n'I know,' Taylor said.\n\n'You're acting like you hear the word ''Uzbekistan'' like you talk about it with your family or whatever,' he responded.\n\n'I do,' Taylor affirmed.\n\n'It may surprise you to know that, until I was 14, I thought it was ''West-consin'',' Blake noted. 'Thought there must be an East-consin.'\n\n'Woah, did you go to school?' Taylor asked, proceeding to sing 'the state song,' which lists all 50 states, and calling it 'like, my favorite song.'\n\nAfter the women's knockout performances, Blake was forced with making what he called a 'horrifying' decision, but chose Cali for her potential to grow.\n\nAt the commercial break, some inside scenes were shown from the shooting of the film Cats, which Taylor will co-star in, out at Christmas.\n\nTaylor then worked with John, with whom she'd sung with before.\n\nGrammy winners: Taylor also helped out John with his singers\n\nHe had Max Boyle, 23, from Toledo, Ohio, go up against Katie Kadan, 38, from Chicago.\n\nMax was intimidated to follow Katie, but his rendition of Billie Eilish's When The Party's Over was beautiful, capturing the emotion he felt after a recent breakup.\n\n'It's really a tour-de-force for him,' John said.\n\n'It's intimate and powerful and I loved it,' Taylor added, feeling he had 'great intuition.'\n\nFan favorite: Katie Kadan intimidated Max Boyle\n\nRecent split: Max's rendition of Billie Eilish's When The Party's Over was beautiful, capturing the emotion he felt after a recent breakup\n\nHaving Taylor help him was 'one of the coolest things that ever happened to me,' Max crowed.\n\nIn the end, Katie's superstar quality carried the day, and John chose her to remain on his team.\n\nBut Kelly and Gwen both pressed their buttons to steal Max, using their lone steals and he chose Kelly.\n\nThe Voice will return Tuesday on NBC.\n\nSteal attempt: Kelly pushed her button to steal Max after he lost his Knockouts match with Katie", "description": "The 29-year-old pop star had a special encounter with a huge fan on Monday's episode of The Voice as she served as 'mega-mentor' to the show's contestants.", "authors": ["Dailymail.Com Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/06/20313484-0-image-a-44_1572330798698.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
