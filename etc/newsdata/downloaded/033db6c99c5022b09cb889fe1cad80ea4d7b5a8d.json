The SUV hit the side of a tanker truck that was making a left turn at Finch, Sgt. Murray Campbell of the Toronto police traffic services division told CBC Toronto.\n\nThe SUV then spun out of control and slammed into a GO Transit bus, Campbell later told reporters at the scene.\n\n\"It is believed that they were travelling at a very high rate of speed when this occurred,\" Campbell said, adding that witnesses have told police the SUV ran red lights as it sped south on Dufferin.\n\nThe driver was not injured and has been placed under arrest, Campbell said, but he could not indicate what, if any, charges he might face. The passenger was taken to hospital with a \"serious, life-altering\" leg injury, he said.\n\nInvestigators are looking into how the boys got a hold of the vehicle.\n\n\"It could have been absolutely catastrophic,\" Campbell told CBC. \"Two inexperienced people, youths, in a car travelling at what's believed to be a high rate of speed, there could have been a lot more vehicles involved and more serious injury or death.\"\n\nThe Toronto police collision reconstruction unit will probe the crash. (Ali Chiasson/CBC)\n\nThe GO bus was on its way to the nearby GO Transit bus terminal, Metrolinx spokesperson Anne Marie Aikins said. The bus did not have passengers and the driver was uninjured, she told CBC Toronto.\n\nThe bus driver remained at the scene and will assist with the investigation, Aikins said.\n\nThe tanker truck was also empty and the driver was not hurt, Campbell said.\n\nThe intersection will remain closed as investigators continue to gather evidence, he said. He urged anyone with dash-cam footage or other surveillance video of the area at the time of the incident to contact police.\n\nBuses in the area are being re-routed as a result of the collision, including the 36 Finch West, the 939 Finch Express, the 105 Dufferin North and the 104 Faywood.", "description": "One boy is in hospital and another is under arrest after a collision between an SUV and a tanker truck in the city's north end early Tuesday morning.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5320927.1571138250!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/suv-crash.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
