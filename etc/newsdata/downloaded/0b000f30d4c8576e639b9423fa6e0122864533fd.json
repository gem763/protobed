He reassured me about what he's got planned and what's coming up. It surprised me and I took it on board.'\n\n'I honestly believe the prime minister understands now. I honestly believe that he understands how dire it is here and I just hope that his other ministers also realise that.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nA distraught caller whose story broadcaster Alan Jones (pictured) hailed as a 'metaphor' for government inaction on the drought has praised Prime Minister Scott Morrison for giving farmers hope\n\nAlan Jones, who has been attacking Mr Morrison (pictured) on air daily, told Mark Hollman the 'emotion you demonstrated and the passion with which you spoke is emblematic of every farmer across this country'\n\nOI Monday morning Mr Morrison called Mark Hollman and told him what the government was doing for farmers and farming communities. Pictured is crop farmer Neil Westcott near Parkes\n\n'If you ask me did I sleep better and did he give me a bit of hope, the answer is yes, he did.\n\n'We're a long way from it but there was a little bit of hope after that conversation.'\n\nJones has repeatedly told his 2GB audience the government was not listening to farmers but Mr Hollman was impressed by getting a phone call from Mr Morrison.\n\n'Isn't it a positive note that we live in a country like Australia and the prime minister rings up a boy from Bourke? How great of a country can it be?'\n\nMr Morrison told Jones about his conversation with Mr Hollman after a heated discussion with the broadcaster on Tuesday morning.\n\n'What I did yesterday is I took him through all the things that I just talked to you about, and he wasn't aware of those things,' Mr Morrison said.\n\n'I spoke to him at some length. I took him through all the things we were doing.\n\n'At the end of the conversation, Alan, this is what he said to me. He said, \"This is the hope I was looking for Scott.\" That's what Mark said to me yesterday.'\n\nMark Hollman, from Bourke in north western New South Wales, was interviewed by Channel 9's Sylvia Jeffreys (both pictured). Mr Hollman was happy with his phone call from Scott Morrison\n\nMr Hollman had joined in Jones's criticism of Mr Morrison when he called in last week to detail the devastating effect of the drought on his family.\n\n\n\n'At the last election I voted for Morrison because I thought he was our hope,' Mr Hollman had said.\n\n'We're a real tough mob. We have put up with drought and dust storms but we always have hope.\n\n'But now we have got none - give us some bloody hope Scott! Tell us you are going to build a dam, tell us you're going to put a shovel in the bloody ground!\n\n'We're dying out here. My town is dying.'\n\nHe said of Mr Morrison: 'You've got him on next week. Ask him. Tell him Mark in Bourke wants to know where his hope is.'\n\nLast year, the period 2019-2021 was predicted to be very likely the driest in Australia for more than 200 years. Pictured is drought-ravaged land near Guyra, north-eastern New South Wales\n\nJones said after the call that 'Mark has become a metaphor' for the drought.\n\n'Mark, you've made a massive contribution to the cause because the emotion you demonstrated and the passion with which you spoke is emblematic of every farmer across this country.\n\n'This is beyond desperate because the next step after desperate is death.'\n\nThe federal government has been frustrated by Jones's attacks on its response to the drought, which Coalition MPs say has been largely welcomed by affected communities.\n\nMr Morrison has been provided with a list of frustrated farmers who have contacted Jones's program and plans to call them to explain what his government is doing to help those devastated by drought.\n\nBourke is in a state of intense drought and Mr Hollman wept last week as he told of how three of his children had already left home because the situation was so bleak.\n\nThe former farmer recalled a conversation with his son, pleading for him to come home to see his parents.\n\n'I say to my son, \"When are you going to come home to see me and Mum mate?\" He says, \"Why, there's nothing out there\".\n\n'I want my kids to come home Alan.\n\nIn May this year, 98.6 per cent of New South Wales and 65.2 per cent of Queensland was declared to be in a state of drought.\n\nPictured: Drought affected land in Stanthorpe on Queensland's southern border\n\n'Don't talk to me - I'm a farmer's son, you're not': Scott Morrison's most loyal voters turn on him after 'diabolical' interview with Alan Jones over Australia's drought crisis\n\nAlan Jones furiously rowed with Scott Morrison about drought relief for farmers in an explosive interview on Tuesday morning, sparking loyal voters to turn on the PM.\n\nIn one particularly heated moment, the radio host interrupted Mr Morrison and bluntly told him: 'Oh don't talk to me, I'm a farmer's son and you're not.'\n\nAfter the interview Jones was overrun with calls from listeners, many of whom voted Liberal, as they lined up to slam the Prime Minster, calling him 'arrogant' and a 'waste of space'.\n\nA fired-up Jones was urging the PM to do more to help farmers who cannot afford feed and water to keep livestock alive.\n\nAlan Jones furiously rowed with Scott Morrison (pictured) about drought relief for farmers in an explosive interview on Tuesday morning, sparking loyal voters to turn on the PM\n\n'These people, Prime Minister, cannot survive today,' Jones said angrily.\n\n'They are sending the breeding stock to the sale yard to be slaughtered, they're walking off their farms.\n\n'They need cash now. Now. Just as we gave a billion dollars to Indonesia over a tsunami. This is a drought tsunami.'\n\nMr Morrison explained that he couldn't make it rain and that $318million has already helped in the past year.\n\nHow does that feed a cow? Jones repeatedly asked the PM\n\n'The direct cash grant support is going into farming communities, including directly to farmers,' Mr Morrison said.\n\nBut Jones interrupted, saying: 'They're not getting it!'\n\nMr Morrison continued: 'Alan, if you could let me finish. There's $318.5 million...'\n\n'I don't know where the money is Prime Minister,' Jones interjected.\n\nAs Mr Morrison tried to make his point, Jones cut in with a blunt remark: 'Oh don't talk to me, I'm a farmer's son and you're not.'\n\nIn May 2019, 98.6 per cent of New South Wales and 65.2 per cent of Queensland was declared to be in a state of drought. Pictured is a property on the outskirts of Boggabri, NSW\n\nMr Morrison continued trying to explain how aid has helped while a frustrated Jones kept interjecting and asking: 'How does that feed a cow?'\n\nJones then criticised the Farm Household Allowance scheme, which gives farmers fortnightly payments and, in some cases, lump sum payments of up to $12,000.\n\n'You say Farm Household Allowance. Now PM, come on. You go and tell Jenny that she can live on $250 a week,' Jones said.\n\n'It's not $250 a week Alan. It's not just that,' Mr Morrison replied.\n\nJones (pictured) angrily interrupted the PM several times during an interview on Tuesday\n\n'If you live in the city, and your business goes bust or you lose your job, then you have access to Newstart. But if you are on a farm property and you get access to the Farm Household Allowance.'\n\nJones did not accept his answer and pressed the PM further by asking: 'Why are they walking off? Why are they sending their cattle to slaughter?'\n\n'Because of the drought, that's why,' said the PM.\n\nMr Morrison then admitted he couldn't save farmers from some hardship.\n\n'The government, whether it's state, federal or anyone else, we can do a lot of things to try and help people get through this. But the government can't make it rain, and it can't make life as it was before the drought,' he said.\n\n'We both want the same thing. We want the farmers to be able to get through this drought. But we can't kid ourselves that there's a magic wand and a magic cash splash that's going to make this thing totally solved.'\n\nAt times during the interview, Jones became exasperated as he repeatedly interrupted the Prime Minister and sighed and tutted when Mr Morrison spoke.\n\nDespite Jones' combative stance, 2GB listeners said they were disappointed by the Prime Minister.\n\nOne named Robert said: 'My blood's boiling after hearing that. Complete failure as a Prime Minister. He's arrogant. They've been conning the public after the election.'\n\nAnother named Michelle added: 'I'm a dairy farmer's daughter. That interview should sign the end of his Prime Ministership. Just absolutely diabolical.'\n\nOne listener named Chris said: 'Today we've nailed him to a post. He's a failure.'\n\nSome of the 2GB listeners said they had voted for Mr Morrison in the election in May, bringing him victory against the odds for which he credited 'quiet Australians'.\n\nHe was referring to rural, regional and older Australians who go about their business without making a fuss or sharing their opinions before polling day.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Last week Mark Hollman broke down in tears as he told a supportive Alan Jones of the devastating impact of drought on his family and how he had\u00a0'no hope' of help from the government.", "authors": ["Stephen Gibbs", "Charlie Moore For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/04/19771018-0-image-a-3_1571197469694.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
