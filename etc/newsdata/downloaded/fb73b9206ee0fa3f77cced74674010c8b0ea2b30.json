The complaint was filed through the proper channels as explicitly prescribed by the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act. The plain language of that statute directs the director of national intelligence in no uncertain terms to forward to the House and Senate intelligence committees all complaints that the Intelligence Community Inspector General (ICIG) had determined to include credible allegations of misconduct rising to the level of an \u201curgent concern\u201d \u2014 a term defined in the statute, generally, as something pertaining to an \u201cintelligence activity.\u201d Despite this clear statutory mandate, an OLC attorney advised acting intelligence director Joseph Maguire that he could substitute his own judgment for that of his inspector general and conclude that the complaint did not pertain to an \u201curgent concern\u201d because the statute \u201cdoes not expressly define \u2018intelligence activity,\u2019 but the meaning of the phrase seems clear from context.\u201d Every other argument in the opinion is predicated on this conclusion. In other words, an OLC lawyer\u2019s impression of how the most critical term in the opinion seemed to be defined formed the basis for the constitutional crisis that has engulfed both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue and culminated in the commencement of an impeachment inquiry.\n\nSuch is the power of an opinion from this office.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump has made it impossible for government lawyers to act ethically\n\nThat\u2019s not to suggest that all of its opinions are bad. Like all legal opinions, the bad ones tend to stick out, but most of their opinions are generally unobjectionable. Many are based on solid legal analysis. Others, though \u2014 such as the whistleblower opinion or the infamous 2002 \u201ctorture memo,\u201d which justified torture of detained enemy combatants by applying a definition of \u201csevere pain\u201d borrowed from a statute that regulates insurance benefits under Medicare \u2014 are little more than thinly veiled post hoc rationalizations for decisions the government had already made.\n\nThe executive branch treats the pronouncements of these lawyers as binding but then vigorously defends against their public release by claiming that they are just \u201cadvice\u201d from a lawyer to a client, except for opinions the office itself decides should be released \u2014 which OLC insists is entirely up to its discretion. This dualism is best exemplified by a line from an internal OLC memo titled \u201cBest Practices for OLC Advice and Written Opinions\u201d: \u201cOLC\u2019s core function, pursuant to the Attorney General\u2019s delegation, is to provide controlling advice to executive branch officials on questions of law that are centrally important to the functioning of the Federal Government.\u201d\n\nThe problem is, \u201ccontrolling advice\u201d is an oxymoron, since advice is something the recipient is free to disregard, which is the opposite of controlling. The two competing interpretations given by executive branch lawyers, depending on the context, are completely irreconcilable: An opinion cannot both be binding on the executive branch and also legal advice from an attorney to a client.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn the \u201ccontrolling\u201d corner, we can find Mueller\u2019s May 29 public statement, which said his office was \u201cbound\u201d by \u201clong-standing department policy\u201d holding that \u201ca president cannot be charged with a federal crime while he is in office\u201d and that indicting Trump was \u201ctherefore not an option we could consider.\u201d But the policy Mueller \u201cwas bound by\u201d was an OLC opinion, first written in 1973 about Watergate. Likewise, the inspector general for the intelligence community informed Congress last week that he could not provide the whistleblower complaint to the appropriate committees because he is \u201cbound by the determination reached as a result of the Acting DNI\u2019s consultations with\u201d OLC, even though he \u201crespectfully disagree[s] with that determination, particularly DOJ\u2019s conclusion.\u201d Within a matter of months, two high-profile misconduct investigations were interrupted because the agencies involved considered OLC opinions to be binding. As Maguire testified to Congress on Thursday morning, \u201cAs you know, for those of us in the executive branch, Office of Legal Counsel opinions are binding on all of us.\u201d\n\nSuch a powerful office, with \u201cbinding\u201d opinions that other agencies must follow even if officials disagree with them, should surely be subject to public scrutiny, right? But consider OLC\u2019s argument every time someone tries to obtain an unpublished opinion through the Freedom of Information Act, which courts consistently accept uncritically. In short, OLC regularly asserts under oath that it only \u201cserv[es] an advisory role as legal counsel to the executive branch \u2026 in a special relationship of trust with the Attorney General,\u201d and that the relationship between OLC and any other part of the executive branch is the same as the relationship between any attorney and any client. If you accept this argument, the most formal and detailed OLC opinion becomes simple \u201cadvice\u201d that the purported client can follow or ignore at their leisure. So there\u2019s no reason to release it under open-records laws, because it is covered by attorney-client privilege.\n\nBarr's zealous defense of Trump makes it impossible to trust his legal judgment\n\nThis tension is exacerbated because OLC was originally designed to give authoritative legal opinions to the executive branch on matters which were unlikely to ever appear in court, sort of like an in-house judge who only issued advisory opinions. But in the last 10 or 15 years, OLC has been captured by Justice Department litigators, and a review of their more recent opinions reveals a disturbing pattern: The office now hardly ever tells an agency \u2014 let alone the president \u2014 that an action is prohibited, even though the \u201cBest Practices\u201d memo instructs it to do just that if appropriate. Instead, lawyers there provide a legal rationale \u2014 often strained \u2014 for whatever action it is that the agency wants to take. They are no longer providing impartial authoritative opinions; they are acting as \u201cthe executive branch\u2019s lawyers.\u201d As such, they even stoop to including wholly irrelevant allegations in their opinions, which previously would be seen only in a courtroom, such as the references in the whistleblower opinion to the whistleblower\u2019s motivations and the fact that he or she did not personally witness the president\u2019s phone call \u2014 neither of which have any pertinence to a legal question of whether a complaint alleges an urgent concern or whether an agency head has the authority to overrule his inspector general on that question.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut the executive branch already has lawyers whose sole job is to defend the things it wants to do; they litigate for the Justice Department and work in every agency\u2019s Office of General Counsel. What it does not have is objective legal expertise. And that\u2019s bad for the agencies, it\u2019s bad for the law and it\u2019s bad for the country.\n\nThere are many ways to fix this problem, but they all fall to Congress to act. Congress could legislate that OLC opinions are binding, which would mean that no privilege would apply to their release (although they could be withheld for other reasons, such as classification or law enforcement considerations). Congress could legislate that OLC opinions are not binding, which would free up agencies to ignore them and maybe ensure that bad opinions are weeded out. Congress could mandate that OLC opinions must be released to lawmakers so they can evaluate whether they agree with OLC\u2019s interpretation of the law. Congress could add a caveat to FOIA that a court must presume that an agency that acted in accordance with an OLC opinion fully accepted the reasoning of the opinion, thereby triggering an exception to any claim of privilege. Congress could even remove OLC from the Justice Department entirely and establish it as an independent agency with a mandate to issue objective, authoritative advisory opinions on questions of law, like a \u201clegal inspector general.\u201d\n\nAny of these options would clarify and remedy the problematic relationship among OLC, the executive branch and the rest of the world. Legislation would make OLC choose a lane; either it is an authoritative source for independent legal analysis, or it is yet another office full of zealous advocates. But the one thing Congress cannot do is ignore it. Ignoring the growing divide between OLC\u2019s original purpose and its practical reality is what has led us to the point where a handful of career civil service lawyers can affect the course of entire administrations and then refuse to tell anyone what they did.\n\nAD", "description": "The Office of Legal Counsel has too much power and not enough transparency.", "authors": ["Kel Mcclanahan", "Kel Mcclanahan Is The Executive Director Of"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/bpw5mYJNWI9PuDw188HMuItXL9U=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6ERRBJE6IMI6TA7DIX663DUNFY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
