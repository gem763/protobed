DNA testing can .. provide the truth,\u201d Mr Scheck said.\n\nThe evidence they want to test includes a pair of men\u2019s underwear found at the scene of the crime. The pair would not have been tested because DNA tests in the 1980s were still relatively primitive.\n\nShelby County assistant district attorney Steve Jones has argued that the state cannot go forward with the testing, because state law only allows a person convicted of a crime to require testing.\n\nMr Jones also argued that the existence of someone else\u2019s DNA would not exonerate Alley, since he was convicted on \u201ca combination of factors that corroborated his confession\u201d.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report", "description": "The daughter of a man executed 13 years ago in Tennessee is hoping to prove her father\u2019s innocence through a DNA test, 13 years after his death from lethal injection.
