Mark Sanford (R-SC) discussed impeachment as House Democrats move towards an impeachment inquiry.\n\nSanford argued impeachment is \u201cnot going anywhere\u201d in the Senate and impeachment would \u201celiminate\u201d the presidential election process every four years while also putting the country through some unnecessary \u201cback and forth.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was in a debate yesterday with Joe Walsh, he\u2019s one of my primary competitors, and my primary competitors are saying, you know, the president is treasonous, let\u2019s shoot him. I mean, crazy stuff. And I\u2019ve said, \u2018Look, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re after. If you are after an impeachment merit badge, you may get it but it\u2019s not going anywhere in the Senate. And if you want to condemn the action, if that can be proven there was wrongdoing there, then censure it.'\u201d\n\n\u201cBut impeachment\u2019s going nowhere,\u201d he continued, emphasizing that \u201cmathematically\u201d impeachment will not make it through the Senate.\n\nFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent", "description": "During a Monday interview on Fox News Channel's \"America's Newsroom,\" 2020 GOP presidential candidate former Rep.
