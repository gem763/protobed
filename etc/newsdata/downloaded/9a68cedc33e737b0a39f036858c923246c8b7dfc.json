Though fragile I\u2019m not going to be angry or bitter. I\u2019m getting in touch with my MP Liz Saville-Roberts for some advice.\n\nCocktease and whatevs among new words added to Oxford English Dictionary\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t want to be re-housed, just to regain the home I\u2019ve enjoyed for the last four years with my three lovely cats.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m 70, a retired professional and I\u2019d like some respect for my dignity and sanity.\u2019\n\nPhotos from inside Ms Ralphs\u2019 home show the rooms piled high with furniture, bags and belongings, leaving virtually no space to move around.\n\nMs Ralphs said she had previously downsized from a five bedroom house (Picture: Andrew Price/ View Finder)\n\nShe says her health prevented her from sorting the house (Picture: Andrew Price/ View Finder)\n\nSpeaking before her eviction, the pensioner said she had been planning on sorting the house out, but her health had failed.\n\nShe said: \u2018All I want is to sit in my beloved home with my cats and see the sun and stars from my garden.\n\n\u2018I am a bit of a hoarder, and the fire brigade officers who have been here say it\u2019s the worst hoarding they have ever seen and that it\u2019s a fire risk.\n\n\u2018Mostly it\u2019s because I moved here from a place that had five bedrooms, so I have lots of bags of clothes, bedding and curtains, but I am very hygienic.\u2019\n\nShe added: \u2018I feel like a donkey dragged 400 miles through the Sahara then being kicked and punched instead of being able to reach the oasis for water.\n\nThe locks were changed on the property on Monday (Picture: Andrew Price/ View Finder)\n\nShe has now been forced to live in a van while she finds a new home (Picture: Andrew Price/ View Finder)\n\n\u2018I\u2019m so happy here with my cats and their feline friends. My neighbours are animal lovers, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I\u2019m a quiet and submissive spinster just getting over a run of bad luck. I don\u2019t smoke, drink or take drugs \u2013 but the system has walked out on me. No one is helping me.\u2019\n\nPolice move in to remove 'crusties' from Trafalgar Square and end XR protests\n\nA spokesperson for Adra said: \u2018Our priority is always to support and sustain tenancies and we work with partner agencies to try and prevent homelessness.\n\n\u2018We only take legal action as a last resort. In this case, the court decided that the granting of possession was reasonable and proportionate.\u2019\n\nPlaid Cymru MP Mrs Saville-Roberts said: \u2018I will do everything I can to help her. No one wants to see a 70-year-old in the street.\n\n\u2018What she needs is some intensive support and to be able to keep her possessions.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
