I strongly suspect that you dumped her body at sea.\n\n'You knew that stretch of coast like the back of your hand. It would not have been difficult to weigh her body down so that it sank.'\n\nThe judge said the length of time Mrs Grigg's body has been concealed for - 20 years - and the fact that Griggs has still not revealed its location, was an aggravating factor in sentencing.\n\n'You robbed the mother of her children and her family of the very thing you have enjoyed over those 20 years.'\n\nPolice have never found any trace of Mrs Griggs apart from a smear of blood in her car found abandoned a mile away from her home\n\nMr Justice Spencer paid tribute to Mrs Griggs, of whom he said 'caring was her very nature'.\n\nHe said he had 'no doubt whatsoever' that Andrew Griggs had been in a 'full sexual relationship' with a teenage girl in the months before his wife disappeared.\n\nMr Justice Spencer told the court that he had to sentence Griggs in line with the law that was in place at the time of the killing.\n\nTaking everything into account, he jailed Griggs for life with a minimum term of 20 years.\n\nThe boot lining and carpet of Mrs Griggs's car were found to have been conspicuously missing\n\nA video released by Kent Police today showed Griggs being arrested and put in handcuffs as he was taken away in a van, before being taken into a police station.\n\nDetectives believe the keen sailor and former professional fisherman, may have stored her body at his freezer business before dumping it at sea later from his dingy.\n\nDespite multiple searches, they have never found any trace of Mrs Griggs apart from a smear of blood in her car found abandoned a mile away from her home with the boot lining and carpet conspicuously missing.\n\nA short time after she vanished, Griggs took his three sons to Dorset where he started a new life, marrying for a second time and starting a model ship business.\n\nBrian Cameron (left), Mrs Griggs's father, and Wendie Rowlinson (right), her sister, speak outside Canterbury Crown Court in Kent today\n\nThere he might have remained but for cold case officers who examined the evidence again and decided that a jury might not believe his postnatal depression story.\n\nEven after he was charged, his sons never believed for a moment that their father could be capable of murder and offered to give evidence in his defence.\n\nBut they are thought to have changed their minds after a woman in her 30s told jurors she was 'groomed' as a 14-year-old and he sexually abused her.\n\nIt emerged during his trial that far from being a loving husband to his wife of nine years, Griggs was a bully who had been threatening his wife for years.\n\nGriggs, pictured following his arrest, was in a 'full sexual relationship' with a girl in the months before his wife disappeared\n\nIn an extraordinary case, a diary Mrs Griggs kept before her disappearance turned out to be the key piece of evidence against him.\n\nHis wife wrote: 'During the course of our marriage my husband was bombastic and bullying.\n\n'He has threatened to get me sorted. I took that to mean he will do me harm or will arrange for some other to do me harm.'\n\nShe described an incident in which her husband kneed her in the stomach while she was pregnant.\n\nMrs Griggs was praised by a judge in court today who said 'caring was her very nature'\n\nShe said: 'Everything we have together is in fact his, and I am only allowed to enjoy anything that is a joint matrimonial asset by reason of being with him.\n\n'He does not let me go out by myself. His needs come first. He tells me I am sick and mad in the head.'\n\n'You told lie after lie': Sentencing remarks from the judge in full Mr Justice Robin Spencer said: 'Her body has never been found. Only you know how you killed her and where you hid her body. 'You told lie after lie in the witness box just as you did after her disappearance and just as you have for the last 20 years. 'She was the adored and adoring mother of three little boys. They were her life, her pride and joy. She never would have left them of her own free will. 'In murdering Debbie you destroyed the life of your unborn child as well. 'She was a generous and supportive sister and friend. She worked as an auxiliary nurse and worked in a care home. Caring was her very nature. 'You may well have come to the conclusion some time before that Wednesday night that you wanted to be rid of your wife once and for all. 'Only you know what took place that night in the house. Only you know how you killed Debbie and disposed of her body. I strongly suspect you dumped her body at sea. 'As an experienced sailor and deep sea fisherman you knew that stretch of coast like the back of your hand. It would not have been difficult to weigh her body down so it sank. 'That morning you set about stringing the story she walked out on you. Walking out for good was the very last thing Debbie would ever have done. 'It was a huge sadness Debbie's mother is not alive to see you brought to justice. 'Debbie's family never had the opportunity to properly grieve. They have had no knowledge how or why she died. 'There was in my judgement a degree of premeditation.' 'You murdered your wife in the family home where she was entitled to feel safe at a time your young children were asleep in the house. 'In your lying cover story you sought from the start to blacken Debbie's name, suggesting she would have been prepared to desert her children and her family, that she had been unfaithful and suffered with mental health issues. 'It is to your credit that your sons have grown to be fine young men that Debbie would be proud of. 'But in reality you robbed the mother and her family of the very thing you have enjoyed over the last 20 years. 'You have shown no remorse whatsoever. 'True remorse would have been shown by a guilty plea and disclosure of where you hid the body.' 'Your motive for killing your wife was in part driven by your frustration that she would claim half of your business if there was a divorce.'\n\nMrs Griggs's diary revealed her concern about how he was spending more time with the girl, who she confronted just days before she vanished, accusing her of sleeping with her husband.\n\nBut when Griggs took the stand, he said his wife had been suffering with post-natal depression and was plagued by 'dark moods' which left her suicidal.\n\nHe said Mrs Griggs said on more than one occasion: 'I might as well kill myself.'\n\nBut although she had suffered from depression following her first two pregnancies, she had recovered by the time of her fourth pregnancy and friends said she was happy and well at the time of her disappearance.\n\nGriggs obtained legal advice about his wife being entitled to half of their business if they divorced.\n\nThen just three days before she disappeared, he set up a new account for their business in his sole name.\n\nOn Monday, Griggs showed no emotion as he was convicted.\n\nDetective Chief Inspector Kaye Braybrook of the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate appealed to him this week to reveal where he had hidden her body: 'Debbie Griggs was a loving mother of three young sons with a fourth child on the way.\n\n'The jury heard from a number of witnesses who all agreed she would have never abandoned them, and was not the depressed, unstable and violent person Andrew Griggs has gone to great lengths to paint her as.\n\n'While Debbie's body has never been found, we are certain she died at the hands of her husband.\n\n'He has proven himself to be a callous and manipulative individual who has gone to great lengths to destroy his wife's reputation.\n\n'For 20 years he has heartlessly carried on with his life while Debbie's family and friends have struggled to come to terms with their loss, and have never had the chance to bury her body and say their proper goodbyes.\n\n'Tragically Debbie's mother died just weeks before Andrew was charged with her murder, without ever knowing what happened to her daughter.\n\n'Only Andrew knows how he killed Debbie and what he did with her body. I appeal to him to have the courage to speak up and enable those who continue to grieve her loss to have some form of closure. It is not too late for him to do the right thing.'\n\nDerek Cameron, Mrs Griggs's brother, read a statement outside court on behalf of the family following the verdict on Monday.\n\nHe slammed the 'manipulative web of deceit and lies' spun by the defendant, saying: 'Twenty years. This is how long it has taken for this to come to justice. Twenty years of anguish, torment and heartache. Twenty years of hurt, pain, despair and emotional turmoil.\n\n'Twenty years without a daughter, sister and grandchildren and nephews. Twenty years of lost communication and three young boys without their mother.\n\n'Finally, 20 years have come to a conclusion, we can put this to bed. We will never forget Debbie, who was an amazing daughter, a remarkable sister, an extraordinary and committed, compassionate person, not only to her friends but to everyone.\n\n'She was a passionate doting mother with unequivocal love for her children who meant the absolute world to her. For Debbie we are oh so sorry that this has taken so long, and for mum if you are listening, we actually finally got him.\n\n'We would appeal to the defendant if he can see within his wisdom to perhaps telling us where Debbie's body is so we can put the ultimate closure to this.'", "description": "Debbie Griggs, 34, was four months pregnant when she mysteriously disappeared from her home in Deal, Kent, in 1999 - but her husband Andrew, 57, tried to blame post-natal depression.", "authors": ["Mark Duell For Mailonline", "Rebecca Camber For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/15/20382730-0-image-a-163_1572450274899.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
