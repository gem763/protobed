After we did end up having kids, I just ignored the issue and it gradually got worse.\n\n'It was my food and lack of exercise that got me into the shape I was.'\n\nMrs Landreth - who candidly documents her weight loss journey on Instagram - said her weight continued to pile on as she found herself overeating.\n\n'I used to eat a lot of food - big serves and a lot of snacking, plus the classic mum move of finish off the kids scraps,' she said.\n\n'The foods were nothing particularly unhealthy. But having said that, I was a bit of a sucker for savoury things like chips - any kind and two-minute noodles though.\n\n'I have always loved healthy food, but just didn't have my head around how to put together a properly balanced meal and ate too much of the treat foods.'\n\nThese two pictures were taken exactly one year apart - January 1, 2018 and January 1, 2019\n\nHer weight spiralled out of control after suffering four devastating miscarriages following eight gruelling rounds of IVF\n\nCarly's healthy plant-based day on a plate BREAKFAST: Oats or smoothie LUNCH: We eat leftovers for lunch pretty much every day because that is how I save my sanity DINNER: Usually a big bowl of grains, legumes and vegetables, and we eat a lot of tofu, tempeh and beans. We love pasta too so we have that a couple times a week SNACK: Lots of nuts, fruits, vegetables and hummus\n\nSome of the biggest challenges she faced included missing out on playing with her kids and struggling to find clothes that fit.\n\n'I was definitely ashamed of the way I looked and thought about it all day every day, but at the same time, I never ever really allowed myself to acknowledge it to myself because then it became real,' she said.\n\n'I was always the one sitting on the sidelines and watching others play with my kids in the pool, and not jumping in at playgrounds because I was worried I would break things or embarrass myself.\n\n'I also just didn't really have much energy for keeping up with my two active boys and being as physical as they wanted me to be. Plus it was pretty impossible to find anything to wear, most brands don't go that big and I had to buy clothes online.'\n\nBut her turning point came after spending Christmas with the family in December 2017\n\nAt her heaviest, she said she 'hated' her size but 'never ever vocalised' it.\n\n'For me it was a private thing and to complain about my weight brought attention to it and meant that I had to admit what I knew but was just pretending wasn't happening,' she said.\n\n'I also always knew that this was my own doing so I was the only one I had to blame. I just hid - literally and figuratively - and tried not to bring attention to myself.'\n\nI didn't want to be in photos with my family and I didn't want to go to the beach with them and after a few weeks of that, I just couldn't ignore it anymore\n\nBut her turning point came after spending Christmas with the family.\n\n'It all came to a head over the Christmas period. Too much food, too much drink, too much feeling awkward and sweaty and just generally cr**py,' she said.\n\n'I didn't want to be in photos with my family and I didn't want to go to the beach with them and after a few weeks of that, I just couldn't ignore it anymore.\n\n'I had to do something, and the second I admitted that to myself there was no putting that thought back into its box.'\n\nSome of the biggest challenges she faced included missing out on playing with her kids and struggling to find clothes that fit\n\nThe 34-year-old doting mother spending quality time with her two sons - aged three and six\n\nOn January 1, 2018, she signed up to 28 by Sam Wood - an Australian weight loss program designed to encourage people to exercise just 28 minutes day.\n\n'I haven't look back since,' she said.\n\n'The food is unreal. People were so surprised that I was still eating things like pasta and bread - but what the program taught me is that all of these foods are ok.\n\n'It's just about focusing on eating \"real food\", and appropriate amounts of it in conjunction with regularly moving your body.\n\nPeople were so surprised that I was still eating things like pasta and bread\n\n'I did try and be pretty strict for the first six months or so and really stuck to the program closely, and cut out alcohol as much as I could, and the results were undeniable and super motivating.\n\n'I've since allowed back in the odd snack and fairly regularly alcohol and have found a healthy balance.'\n\nSince turning her life around for the better, Mrs Landreth and her family have been following a plant-based vegan diet and she treats herself whenever she feels like it.\n\n'Life is about balance and this change has to be sustainable for it to actually work. For me, it isn't about being on a diet at all. I was making foundational changes in my health by overhauling the way I ate and how I moved,' she said.\n\nOn January 1, 2018, she signed up to 28 by Sam Wood - an Australian weight loss program designed to encourage people to exercise just 28 minutes day. Within one year, she lost 34kg\n\nAt her heaviest, she wore size 18 to 20 clothing, and she would always sit on the 'sidelines' instead of playing with her children at playgrounds and swimming pools\n\nHer exercise regime includes the program's 25 minute workout daily, as well as a midweek run, and yoga.\n\n'I don't sweat if I miss a day or two though and have learned to listen to my body regarding what intensity I need and when I need a rest,' she said.\n\n'I do always know that I never regret the workout I do, while sometimes I may get to the end of the day and regret not prioritising some exercise time for myself.\n\nI genuinely am surprised when I see myself in the mirror and don't see the person that I still expect to see\n\n'Usually I get up and workout in the morning before the kids are up, or in the afternoon while they are eating their dinner. They quite often join in with me too and love to show me their push ups and planking - and that is something I am so proud that I have given to them, rather than a legacy of being unhealthy and overweight.'\n\nAfter shedding 37 kilos, Mrs Landreth - who now weighs around 57 kilos - said she feels happier more than ever.\n\n'It has been nearly 12 months since I first squeezed into a size six outfit and it still blows me away every single day,' she said.\n\n'I genuinely am surprised when I see myself in the mirror and don't see the person that I still expect to see. It's weird. I do have a body that is covered in loose excess skin though, so it's not \"perfect\" by any means.\n\nAfter shedding 37 kilos, Mrs Landreth said she feels happier more than ever and she can now wearing bikinis to the beach with her family\n\nHer exercise regime includes the program's 25 minute workout daily, as well as a midweek run, and yoga\n\n'My body has been stretched beyond repair and I'm realistic about the fact that I have skin that I need to tuck into high waisted pants, but it is what it is and I'm so proud of how strong and healthy I am that I don't feel ashamed about showing my body.\n\n'I spent so many years under long sleeves and long pants at the beach and hating every second, that now you can't stop me from living in a bikini all summer long.'\n\nFor anyone who's struggling to lose weight, Mrs Landreth said: 'I know that getting from where you are to where you want to be seems so insurmountably hard that it feels easier to just not start at all. But it's not.\n\nI'm so proud of how strong and healthy I am that I don't feel ashamed about showing my body\n\n'You know exactly where you'll be in six months from now if you change nothing. But \u2013 you have no idea what you could achieve if you actually decide to make a change.\n\n'Just give it a go - what do you have to lose? More importantly, think about what you could possibly gain - health, vitality, energy, self confidence, strength, so much.\n\n'It's not about losing weight and being skinny, it's about getting the most out of your life. There is nothing at all about me that makes me more special than you.\n\n'If I can do this then literally anyone can.'", "description": "An Australian mother whose weight escalated after she turned to food for comfort has dramatically dropped seven dress sizes without giving up pasta and bread.", "authors": ["Cindy Tran For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/00/19418602-0-image-a-103_1570491963109.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
