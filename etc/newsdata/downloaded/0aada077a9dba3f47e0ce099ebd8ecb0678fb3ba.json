They worry about holding the rest of the team back.\n\n\u201cFemale guilt plays a part - they don\u2019t feel like they can take a small amount of time out away from their families to do something for themselves, something that will ultimately make them physically and mentally stronger, happier and more resilient.\n\n\u201cI want to help encourage and inspire more women to get out and push their limits.\u201d\n\nThe team set out from Barra and will run to the Butt of Lewis via South Uist, Benbecula, North Uist, Harris and Lewis, finishing on October 18.\n\n(Image: xxxxxxxxxxx)\n\nThey will tackle mountains, beaches and peat bogs along the way.\n\nAllie Bailey, is 37-year-old freelance marketing manager who lives in Somerset\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t celebrate the win, celebrate the experience.\"\n\nAllie, who took up running eight years ago.\n\nShe was struggling with depression, and having tried to take her own life, a doctor recommended running as a means to lift the black cloud that hovered above her.\n\nSince 2017, and on the back for a mental setback, Allie has undertaken some of the most demanding challenges the world has to offer.\n\nLast year she completed the first ever foot crossing of an uninhabited stretch of the Namib Desert, covering 127 miles in four days and ascending half the height of Everest.\n\nJust days after that feat, she and other Rat Race test pilots blazed a new coast-to-coast trail through the jungles of Panama, covering 125 miles - and 29,0000 ft of ascent - in six days.\n\nNow she\u2019s on a mission to convince more women they can follow in her muddy footsteps\n\nShe said: \u201cEvery time I get to the airport, or the start line of a big race, I get the realisation that I am either the only woman there, or one of a small handful.\n\n(Image: xxxxxxxxxxx)\n\n\u201cIt can be heartbreaking to think that there are people sat at home, wishing that they could do this stuff, but not having the confidence to give it a go.\n\n\u201cI want to help those people realise their dreams. Rat Race is so inclusive in what they do, and encourage people from all walks of life to take part in.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t celebrate the win, they celebrate the experience. I want women to be able to believe in more - to be able to see the world and come back empowered and confident.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping between Ultra Awesome and Rat Race we can create a 50/50 gender split on the start lines of some amazing experiences.\u201d\n\nAnd here are the other ordinary women taking on the extraordinary challenge.\n\nKim Hopkinson, is 30-year-old Senior Business Development Officer for charity Change, Grow, Live, and lives in Banbury, Oxfordshire, with husband Jack.\n\nShe said: \u201cI want to leave this trip with the realisation that stuff like this is for ordinary people like me.\u201d\n\nKim only took up running four years ago.\n\nBut she has graduated from brief mile-and-a-half runs under the cover of darkness - to spare any blushes about her fitness levels - to marathon distances, including a 34 mile trek last year.\n\nShe said: \u201cRunning is simple, but it\u2019s also very visible when you\u2019re a woman running on the streets.\n\n\u201cSo I would go out in the dark, in a million layers, on a quiet route from my house.\n\n\u201cI always thought it was really long way but looking back it was quite short - around a mile and a half.\n\n\u201cBut just going out running a couple of times a week, you can improve so quickly.\n\n\u201cThis year I did London Marathon... and absolutely hated it. It was too busy, too loud, and I felt like just a number. I craved something different - and that\u2019s where adventure racing has come in.\u201d\n\nFor Kim, camaraderie is key.\n\nShe added: \u201cIt\u2019s not a race, we\u2019re all in this together.\n\n\u201cAnd I want to leave this trip with the realisation that stuff like this is for ordinary people like me.\u201d\n\nGillian McColl, is 46-year-old director of an electrical contractor company from Kinross, Scotland, and a mum of two children - Adam, nine, and Alicia, eight.\n\nShe said: \u201cI\u2019m not selfish - time away on adventures makes me a happier person and a better mother.\u201d\n\nGillian is an experienced runner and has completed a number of marathons and ultras - but only really started running seriously in 2016, having become a mother to two children in 2010 and 2011.\n\nIn June this year she completed the The Spine Race, covering 108 miles, non-stop, in just 40 hours.\n\nAnd yet her passion for adventure running has seen her experiencing negative comments from school-run mums.\n\nShe said: \u201cI used to feel really guilty about going out for runs when I first started running again after becoming a mum, and that wasn\u2019t helped by some of the comments I received from mums at the school gate.\n\n\u201cI had one telling me, \u2018you must be really selfish to take all that time out for yourself - do you not feel bad about that?\u2019\n\n\u201cI was shocked, and found myself questioning, \u2018Am I being selfish?\u2019\n\n\u201cAfter some introspection I realised that running makes me a healthier, better person. I need time-out to clear my head and this makes me a better mum.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t actually care what people think anymore, because this sport works for me and it works for my family.\n\n(Image: xxxxxxxxxxx)\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be a 24 hour-a-day mother. You have to have your own \u2018thing\u2019 - your stress release that helps you cope with the demands of work.\n\n\u201cBesides, the children love telling their friends about events that I\u2019m doing as they think the distances I run are a bit crazy.\n\n\u201cAnd I want them to see what is possible when you try and push yourself out of your comfort zone.\n\n\"If you had told me three years ago that I could have run a marathon never mind an ultra I think I would have laughed!\u201d\n\nLaura Fisher, is a 43-year-old mother of three and lives near Faversham, Kent.\n\nShe said: \u201cI grew up thinking I hated running.\u201d\n\nLaura was another late starter - only getting into fitness five years ago.\n\nShe loved boot-camp style classes - but always \u2018hated\u2019 running, viewing it as a \u2018necessary evil\u2019.\n\nBut when she tried obstacle course racing, she caught the bug, and the running distances got longer and longer.\n\nFor Laura - mum to George 14, Margot 11 and Emmanuel nine - it\u2019s the purity of the journey that holds so much appeal.\n\nShe said: \u201cFriends would talk about how wonderful running was, how it cleared the mind and helped them solve their day-to-day problems, but I never got that at all. I just used to think, \u2018When can I stop?\u2019 and, \u2018Am I going to die?\u2019.\n\n\u201cBut since realising that running was actually something I enjoy, I've done countless obstacle and road races - everything from 5Km to marathon distance.\n\n\u201cThe unimportant, mundane things we all worry about in life start to fall away and I focus entirely on the journey.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile Laura says running isn\u2019t about getting the perfect body, either.\n\nShe added: \u201cI\u2019m 43 and I run for fitness, yes, but my motivating factors are not to lose weight or achieve a certain body type \u2013 I\u2019m far more interested in testing by body to see what I can achieve.\n\n\"A smaller waistline is an added bonus but not what gets me lacing up my running trainers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m also determined to instil the idea in my kids that if you really want something you can achieve it.\n\n\"But to make this achievement you need to work - and that can be damn hard, simply wanting something is not enough.\u201d\n\nAlice Kirk, is a 54-year-old psychotherapist who specialises in bereavement with couples and families, lives in rural Derbyshire, with her husband and three teenage daughters.\n\nShe said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to be an observer.\u201d\n\nAfter losing her husband when she was 28, former marketing manager Alice retrained as a psychotherapist.\n\nAnd despite having been a runner most of her life, she only started taking on \u2018ultra\u2019 distances - anything more than a marathon in length - around five years ago.\n\nShe said: \u201cAfter a difficult period in my life about five years ago, a conversation with an ultra runner encouraged me to see if I could go further and I entered my first ultra, January 1st 2015.\n\n\u201cSince then, I have taken part in thirty four ultra events.\u201d\n\nFor Alice, running takes her into an almost hypnotic, stress-free state, away from the dramas of everyday life.\n\nShe added: \u201cWhen you\u2019re running, your brain becomes completely focused.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amplified when you\u2019re covering long distances, too. You kind of go into this numb state, where the only thing you think about is the next checkpoint.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re completely separated from anything else that might be worrying you.\u201d\n\nThough Alice says she\u2019s not the fastest runner she likes to invest the time in doing things that others are perhaps too scared to try.\n\nShe added: \u201cI don\u2019t want to be an observer.\n\n\u201cI want to be in there, challenging myself. Some people might assume that they can\u2019t do such things, but the only limitations are those you place on yourself.\n\n\u201cI am definitely not a talented runner. I am an ordinary mum of three teenagers and I am pretty slow now compared to my thirties, when I could knock out a decent marathon.\n\n\u201cBut running has kept me going through the roughest times in my life. It has been my constant companion. When there was nothing else, I could always go for a run.\u201d\n\nhttps://ratrace.com", "description": "The women will take on an immense 185-mile endurance running challenge and want to persuade others to do the same", "authors": ["Jane Lavender", "Image", "Xxxxxxxxxxx"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20584286.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Allie-Bailey.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
