While Nadler had already been leading one, to a degree, the Ukraine bombshell brought Pelosi on board.\n\nBut her primary campaign represents another wild card in the already-chaotic impeachment melee.\n\nAfter Pelosi\u2019s announcement, Boylan cheered the move and immediately pressed for more, calling for a swiftly scheduled impeachment vote and investigations into everyone from Attorney General Bill Barr to Vice President Pence.\n\n\u201cWe have all the evidence we need to #ImpeachTrumpNOW. Articles must include #Ukraine, brazen human rights violations at the border, abuse of power, and obstruction of justice,\u201d she tweeted.\n\nWith Pelosi\u2019s announcement, Nadler is no longer the principal player in the impeachment drive. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., now assumes a more influential role. But Nadler\u2019s committee will remain at the heart of any effort to draft and move impeachment articles. And his primary challenger is keeping up the pressure on him to follow through, something she\u2019s been doing for months.\n\nHer weekend video took aim at Trump and Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, asking: \u201cAnd where are the Democratic leaders who swore an oath to defend the Constitution?\u201d\n\nThe video was released just days after the House Judiciary Committee held what it called its first \u201cimpeachment hearing,\u201d and as the controversy was first developing over Trump allegedly pushing Ukraine to investigate the Bidens and using U.S. aid as leverage.\n\nBoylan accused the establishment of \u201cstalling and feeding us a bunch of B.S.\u201d She added, \u201cFor too many of them, Donald Trump is a fundraising opportunity, not an existential threat to our democracy.\u201d\n\nTrump hasn\u2019t been a bad fundraising source for Boylan either. A longshot against 26-year incumbent Nadler, she managed to raise a surprising $264,657 in her first quarter by relentlessly hammering Nadler for not impeaching Trump already.\n\nBut that challenge \u2013 and the specter of an Ocasio-Cortez-style win over a Democratic powerhouse \u2013 could be having an impact.\n\nWhite House Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, speaking on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d alleged over the summer that Nadler was \u201cfalling over himself to become more and more progressive in order to try and keep his job and not lose to the next AOC.\u201d\n\nNew York\u2019s 10th congressional district includes the west side of Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn. Nadler was first elected in a special election in 1992. New York Democrats are reportedly considering moving what was scheduled to be a June 23 primary back to April 28 to coincide with the state\u2019s presidential primary.\n\nNadler did not respond to requests for comment for this report. A New York Daily News report earlier this month, though, said Nadler suggested Boylan was only using impeachment as her rationale for running against him and insisted he\u2019s been looking at impeachment since early this year.\n\nBoylan has been sharply critical of Nadler\u2019s handling to date, telling a Yahoo News podcast last week that Nadler has \u201cfumbled\u201d impeachment by having a \u201cmuddled, elongated, prolonged process of nothingness.\u201d\n\nThe 35-year-old challenger has something that Ocasio-Cortez didn\u2019t in her 2018 primary victory shocker over then-House Democratic Caucus Chairman Joe Crowley in New York\u2019s 14th congressional district. Boylan, a former deputy secretary for economic development under New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, can cite government experience.\n\nBut the 14th district in 2018 and 10th district in 2020 aren\u2019t entirely comparable, said Ester Fuchs, a resident of the 10th district and a Columbia University political science professor.\n\nCrowley lost a district to Ocasio-Cortez that was just 10 percent white. Nadler\u2019s district is about 60 percent white, said Fuchs, also a former adviser to ex-New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.\n\nA big challenge in defeating Nadler, Fuchs said, is that despite his national profile, he is still very much a local politician.\n\n\u201cJerry Nadler shows up and doesn\u2019t ignore his district. He comes to community meetings. He\u2019s engaged at the neighborhood level,\u201d Fuchs told Fox News.\n\nRecent polling indicates that while impeachment is a divisive issue for voters as a whole, it is popular among Democrats, the decisive force in a primary.\n\nStill, there\u2019s no visible frustration over Nadler\u2019s pace in the district, Fuchs said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cAnecdotally, people in this district seem proud their congressman is chairman of the Judiciary Committee and believe he\u2019s handling the investigation of Trump responsibly,\u201d Fuchs said.\n\nBoylan\u2019s campaign initially responded to an inquiry from Fox News about an interview with the candidate for a statement for the story, but did not respond to subsequent inquiries.", "description": "Lindsey Boylan's primary campaign represents another wild card in the already-chaotic impeachment melee.", "authors": ["Fred Lucas"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/jerry-nadler-Lindsey-Boylan-AP-Facebook.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
