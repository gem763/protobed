Twitch removed the video but copies had already been downloaded and shared elsewhere on the internet, highlighting the challenges faced by platforms attempting to stymie the dissemination of such material.\n\nHaving failed to enter the synagogue by shooting at the locks, the gunman shot dead two people nearby. Two others were injured. He was arrested after fleeing the scene.\n\nThe Halle attack is the second livestreamed rightwing extremist attack this year, following the March massacre of 51 Muslim worshippers in Christchurch, New Zealand, which was broadcast on Facebook Live. The alleged gunman in the April synagogue shooting in Poway, California, shared a Facebook Live link in a manifesto posted on the extremist message board 8chan before his attack, suggesting that he planned to livestream the shooting that left one dead and two injured.\n\nRelated: Germany: mass shooting attempt that killed two was antisemitic attack, minister says\n\n\u201cLivestreaming enables extremists to amplify their actions, but even more so, bringing their supporters and others that they want to inspire on the journey with them,\u201d said Oren Segal, director of the Anti-Defamation League\u2019s Center on Extremism. \u201cIt is an interactive radicalization tool that also helps spread content that may inspire the next attacker after them.\u201d\n\nAspects of the video, which was reviewed by the Guardian, appear designed for this exact purpose. The video opens with the suspect introducing himself in English to the camera as \u201cAnon\u201d and declaring himself an antisemite, anti-feminist and Holocaust denier. The use of English suggests he had an international audience in mind, and a reference to falling birth rates is in line with popular white nationalist tropes. \u201cAnon\u201d is internet lingo for an anonymous user of forums such as 4chan and 8chan.\n\n\u201cThese folks are preparing their social media strategy as they prepare their weapons,\u201d Segal said. \u201cThat\u2019s the modern terrorist.\u201d\n\nThe Halle shooter also appears to have emulated the Christchurch and Poway shooters by preparing a \u201cmanifesto\u201d and posting it online before his attack. Three documents describing the motivation and weaponry for the attack were posted on the site Kohlchan, according to the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King\u2019s College London.\n\nThe documents, which include a link to the livestream of the shooting, are vehemently antisemitic and racist. They state that the attack\u2019s timing \u2013 on Yom Kippur, the Jewish day of atonement and one of the religion\u2019s high holidays \u2013 was intentional. They also assert the shooter considered a mosque or \u201cantifa \u2018culture\u2019 center\u201d as alternate targets.\n\n\u201cWe worked with urgency to remove this content and will permanently suspend any accounts found to be posting or reposting content of this abhorrent act,\u201d said Brielle Villablanca, a spokeswoman for Twitch.\n\nThe video was viewed by just five people during the attack, the company said, and by about 2,200 people in the 30 minutes after the attack had ended and before Twitch took it down.\n\n\u201cThis video was not surfaced in any recommendations or directories,\u201d the company said in a statement posted on Twitter. \u201cInstead, our investigation suggests that people were coordinating and sharing the video via other online messaging services.\u201d\n\nDespite this limited initial audience, however, the video has since been broadly disseminated on Telegram, an encrypted messaging app that has become a haven for white nationalists and other far-right extremists. One copy of the video had been viewed by more than 33,000 people on Telegram as of Wednesday afternoon. Edited versions of the video were also being shared openly on Twitter throughout the day on Wednesday.\n\nTwitch said that it had shared the video\u2019s hash \u2013 a unique fingerprint for a photo and video that can be used to detect it automatically \u2013 with an industry consortium to help prevent the spread of the video onto other platforms. A spokesperson for Facebook confirmed that the company was working to remove and block the video from its platforms. YouTube and Twitter did not immediately respond to queries.", "description": "About 35 minutes was broadcast live on Twitch in latest instance of extremists using shootings to promote propagandaPeople light candles near the scene of a shooting in Halle, Germany, on 9 October.
