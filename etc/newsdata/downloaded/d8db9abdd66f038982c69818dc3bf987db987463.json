At least 189 structures had burned, 86 of them residential. Though fire officials prepared to beat back pop-up blazes brought on by expected winds overnight, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that the gusts did not come.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cDiablo\u201d winds had been expected to reach 70 mph in northern California, but stayed mostly around 50 mph, the Chronicle reported. The National Weather Service canceled its wind advisory in the area just after 2 a.m. local time.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not expecting any concern from wind doing any damage now,\u201d Weather Service meteorologist Matt Mehle told the Chronicle. \u201cThe red flag warning is still in effect \u2014 we\u2019re still seeing widespread lower humidity with all the dry fuel out there. But for now, we seem to be done with the wind.\u201d\n\nThe winds in Southern California, though, have only gotten worse.\n\nFire crews there are still trying to contain the Getty Fire, which sparked Monday when a tree branch fell on power lines in Los Angeles County. As of Tuesday evening, the fire, on the western edge of Los Angeles, was 15 percent contained \u2014 and officials were bracing for a new wave of Santa Ana winds that could bring 80 mph gusts.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Getty Fire had consumed about 656 acres as of Tuesday night and forced the evacuation of more than 7,000 homes. At least 12 homes have been destroyed in the blaze, and five others have been damaged, officials said.\n\nThe record-strong Santa Ana winds are expected are expected to last through at least Thursday morning.\n\nThis Santa Ana wind episode has the potential to be the worst of the season. Coming on the heels of other offshore windstorms, it means that any ignition sources, like a stray cigarette or a sparking power line, would find extremely flammable vegetation that\u2019s ready to burn.\n\nThe number of people living in areas designated as being in either critical or extreme fire danger, which are the two worst categories, on Tuesday was about 20 million, according to the Storm Prediction Center. On Wednesday, the area enveloped by \u201cextremely critical\u201d fire risk, the most severe category, will expand to encompass 4.5 million, up from about 3.3 million Tuesday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEvacuations have largely gone smoothly as the nation\u2019s most populous state adapts to increasing wildfires that many officials link to climate change.\n\nOfficials in Sonoma County said Wednesday morning that many schools and districts in the area will remain close through Friday, and Los Angeles County authorities warned commuters and travelers to build extra time into their plans.\n\n\u201cHigh winds can make your drive extremely dangerous,\u201d the county wrote on Twitter.\n\nDerek Hawkins, Marisa Iati and Jason Samenow contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "Much of California is under a red flag warning as firefighters continue to battle the Kincade Fire in the north and the Getty Fire down south.", "authors": ["Katie Mettler", "Reporter Covering Breaking News", "Andrew Freedman", "Editor Focusing On Extreme Weather", "Climate Change", "Science", "The Environment."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ZpmFvvStiyt4-Xr7nKd1qLrxtOg=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YSIE34H3AMI6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
