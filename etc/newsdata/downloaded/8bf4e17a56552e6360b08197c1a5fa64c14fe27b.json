O\u2019Brien\u2019s LinkedIn page says he was there in 1987, while still an undergraduate. He received a scholarship from Rotary International and according to its records he was there from 1986. The first black undergraduate was admitted in 1988.\n\nRobert O'Brien replaces John Bolton as Trump's national security adviser Read more\n\nSouth Africa at the time was considered a pariah state and faced wide-ranging academic, sporting and cultural boycotts, backed by the UN. The US imposed sanctions in 1986, after Congress pushed through the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act, overriding a veto by Ronald Reagan. The law restricted trade and investment but did not curtail academic contacts.\n\nProf Jonathan Jansen, who was vice-chancellor of the university \u2013 now called the University of the Free State \u2013 between 2009 and 2017, said that at the time O\u2019Brien was a student, the institution was \u201cin short \u2026 a white, Afrikaans university for people then called Afrikaners \u2013 very conservative and routinely racist not only in their policies but in their practices\u201d.\n\nJansen said in an email to the Guardian that there were \u201cno black students or staff except those cleaning the place and working the gardens etc\u201d.\n\nOther staff members said a handful of black and mixed-race (\u201ccoloured\u201d in the parlance of the apartheid system) postgraduate students may have been admitted before 1988, as well as some mixed-race undergraduates.\n\nHowever, both the undergraduate and postgraduate student body was overwhelmingly white even in 1994 when the first free elections in South Africa marked the end of apartheid.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Children put up posters of Nelson Mandela in the run-up to South Africa\u2019s first democratic elections in 1994.

Those who asked critical questions were ostracised,\u201d said one UFS staffer, who asked not to be named.\n\nThe national security council did not respond to a request for comment. O\u2019Brien was a special envoy for hostages in the state department when he was chosen last week to replace John Bolton.\n\nRobert O'Brien replaces John Bolton as Trump's national security adviser Read more\n\nIt has also emerged that O\u2019Brien has had contact with AfriForum, a controversial NGO in South Africa which campaigns to protect the culture and interests of the country\u2019s Afrikaans-speaking minority, and defends the apartheid legacy. The group has been at the centre of a series of high-profile rows over that legacy, most recently failing in an attempt to overturn a legal ruling designating the flying of the old apartheid-era South African flag as hate speech.\n\nLast year the AfriForum CEO, Kallie Kriel, caused outrage when he said that although apartheid was \u201cwrong\u201d, not enough people had been killed during the apartheid era to justify it being called a crime against humanity.\n\nO\u2019Brien was quoted in a 2017 interview with AfriForum as saying: \u201cIn my opinion, South Africans are the most hospitable people in the world and I have especially experienced this at [UFS].\u201d\n\nO\u2019Brien makes no mention of apartheid or his time in South Africa in his book While America Slept.\n\nO\u2019Brien is reported to have met his wife while at the university, and lists Afrikaans as a second language on his LinkedIn page. Afrikaans is the language spoken by the first waves of white settlers of what was to become South Africa in the 16th and 17th centuries, and was revived in the late 19th century as part of a broader nationalist project by rightwing extremists among the white minority.\n\nA South African radio channel, Netwerk24, interviewed the chemistry professor Karel von Eschwege, who said he had been a close of friend of O\u2019Brien while he was in South Africa.\n\nVon Eschwege claimed O\u2019Brien had wanted to come to personally investigate \u201cthe most hated political system\u201d in the world: apartheid.", "description": "Donald Trump\u2019s new national security adviser studied at the segregated University of the Orange Free State", "authors": ["Jason Burke", "Julian Borger"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bebd738dfe994107f6d82566805a42366e6c97a0/150_0_3200_1921/master/3200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9f14731151ceff5fc2b861f016a76531", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
