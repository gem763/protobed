Just tried to keep the ball out of the middle, try to work with the ball, try to get the angles and don\u2019t rush,\u201d said Svitolina\n\nSvitolina plays Alison Riske of the United States in the quarterfinals, who ousted eighth-seeded Qiang Wang 6-2, 6-1.\n\nIn the first match of the day, Elena Rybakina advanced after Wimbledon champion Simona Halep withdrew with a lower back injury. Halep was trailing 5-4 in the first set.\n\nDefending champion Aryna Sabalenka beat sixth-seeded Kiki Bertens 6-1, 7-6 (9) to reach the last eight.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Top-ranked Ash Barty advanced to the Wuhan Open quarterfinals for the third straight year with a 6-3, 7-5 win over Sofia Kenin on Wednesday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
