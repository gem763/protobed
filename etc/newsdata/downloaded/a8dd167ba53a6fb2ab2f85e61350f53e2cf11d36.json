According to the American story, those who thrived in urban centers \u201cmade it\u201d \u2014 a capitalist triumph for the individual, a damaging loss for the place he left. We often refer to this as \u201cbrain drain\u201d from the hinterlands, implying that those who stay lack the merit or ability to \u201cget out.\u201d\n\nBut that old notion is getting dusty.\n\nThe nation\u2019s most populous cities, the bicoastal pillars of aspiration \u2014 New York City and Los Angeles \u2014 are experiencing population declines, most likely driven by unaffordability. Other metros are experiencing growth, to be sure, especially in the South and West. But there is an exodus afoot that suggests a national homecoming, across generations, to less bustling spaces. Last year, the Census Bureau found that while roughly 80 percent of us live in urban areas, rural life was the most wished for.\n\nIf happiness is what they seek, those folks are onto something. A 2018 study by NPR, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health reported that in spite of economic and health concerns, most rural Americans are pretty dang happy and hopeful. Forty percent of rural adults said their lives came out better than they expected. A majority said they were better off financially than their parents at the same age and thought their kids would likewise ascend. As for cultural woes, those among them under age 50, as well as people of color, showed notably higher acknowledgment of discrimination and commitment to social progress. All in all, it was a picture not of a dying place but one that is progressing.\n\nThe University of Minnesota Extension researcher Ben Winchester has cited a \u201cbrain gain\u201d in rural America. Mr. Winchester found that from 2000 to 2010, most rural Minnesota counties gained early-career to midcareer residents with ample socioeconomic assets. A third of them are returning, while the rest are new recruits.", "description": "There is a \u201cbrain gain\u201d afoot that suggests a national homecoming to less bustling spaces.", "authors": ["Sarah Smarsh"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/17/opinion/17smarsh2/17smarsh2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
