For a daily or weekly work-in-progress meeting, the agenda should be tight and focused largely on outcomes, unless celebrating a win or checking on people\u2019s wellbeing during a tough time. Establish a consistent frequency, duration and agenda structure and stick to it.\n\nFor a weekly meeting, once the fixed items are dealt with, the main goal should be to solve just a few important issues. That\u2019s far more valuable than merely having a discussion on lots of items. Save anything on strategy, culture or team relationships for longer meetings every six weeks or so.\n\nYou should end up with two kinds of meetings: short, sharp, frequent operational problem-solving meetings; and regular, longer but less frequent meetings focused on the bigger picture and the longer term.\n\nSet the shortest, reasonable time\n\nThis might seem counter-intuitive but it's good to avoid long meetings. Keeping meetings succinct improves focus, efficiency and people\u2019s attitude to the meeting. Allow an hour and you\u2019ll use it all. Allow half an hour and you\u2019ll need to be more discriminating about what to include and more disciplined in your discussions.\n\nPrepare well\n\nA huge amount of meeting success comes down to good planning and preparation. If it needs papers in advance, make it clear that reading them is mandatory. It\u2019s also helpful to seek questions in advance \u2013 these can then be addressed by someone well prepared to do so, and some may be resolved before the meeting. Meet with stakeholders so you are aware of issues in advance, which may help you defuse them before the meeting even occurs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSteer constantly and vigilantly\n\nAs the chair, you are constantly trying to balance two equally important dimensions: outcome and process. There\u2019s a big difference between meeting the outcome and getting there in good shape. That\u2019s the process, which includes everything from good team dynamics to people having roughly equal time to speak.\n\nThere\u2019s a huge amount to watch in terms of body language, energy levels and friction between people. As chair, you need to pay attention to outcome and process through the entire meeting. You\u2019ll see when you need to push ahead for outcomes and when you need to slow down or even halt the meeting to get the process and team dynamics right.\n\nA good chair will keep an eye on body language throughout a meeting and know when it's time for a short break. iStock\n\nIf you see tired or restless body language, such as fidgeting or eye rubbing, take a short break, even to stand up and stretch. There\u2019s no point ploughing on with people not mentally present. If you spot defensive body language \u2013 chairs turned away, arms folded \u2013 draw out what\u2019s not being said.\n\nIf faces are red and voices have an edge, you might say you are noticing tension, or bring the heat down by looking for easier wins then coming back to the difficult conversation once people can engage constructively.\n\nIf people look complacent, you might turn the heat up by asking a provocative question or calling out why the issue can\u2019t be glossed over.\n\nIf there is an item you are leading \u2013 you are the author of an important paper, for example \u2013 you may want to hand chairing duties to someone else for that session. This avoids the conflation of roles and reduces the risk that your attachment to the subject affects the integrity of the process.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSteer gently\n\nIt\u2019s easy to make the mistake of thinking that being the chair means you should take charge, lead discussion, make decisions and speak the most. But it\u2019s often the opposite. If everything is flowing well, don\u2019t intervene if the only reason is so you can feel productive.\n\nA good chair also notices when a meeting has gone off course and makes a correction. The correction is often small but important \u2013 a question, a paraphrase, a check for understanding, an interjection to stop a tangent before it diverts the meeting, or closing off an item to move on.\n\nKeep moving forward\n\nGentle doesn\u2019t mean passive. Good chairs can be quiet, but the group never doubts their value or that they are indeed the chair.\n\nOnce all the key elements have been aired, move the team towards a decision. Don\u2019t make rash decisions, but don\u2019t put off decisions unless necessary.\n\nTo get better at this, look at how your meetings turn out. If they produce poor decisions, or ones that lack follow-through from the team, you are focusing too much on outcomes. There\u2019s no victory in reaching a decision if people felt railroaded \u2013 they\u2019ll passively undermine it afterwards. Ask yourself: are people showing that they own these decisions?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you are failing to make many decisions, and the same topics keep coming back, you are allowing the team to abdicate its responsibilities. You need to compel them to make calls. A straw poll (a non-binding vote) can help. Another option is to put forward a draft recommendation, or to identify three primary options and ask everyone to choose which one they favour.\n\nEngage the whole group\n\nA successful meeting occurs when everyone feels they were respected and heard. That doesn\u2019t mean everyone needs to speak the same amount, but they should all feel safe, able to contribute and an equal part of the decision.\n\nAgain, this takes effort. You need to observe everyone, not just get the task done. It may mean checking in \u2013 either with the group or with individuals during the break. If you\u2019re chairing well, you\u2019ll equip the team to self-regulate so that harmony does not depend on your intervention.\n\nIt takes effort to run a meeting where everyone feels they were respected and heard. Supplied\n\nSometimes you may have a difficult individual. Techniques here can include sitting next to them (this can be surprisingly effective); giving every person an allocated time to speak and placing the difficult person about three-quarters of the way through; or taking the person aside before or during the meeting to ask them to help you make the meeting a success.\n\nBe prepared for firmer action (even if you don\u2019t have to take it)\n\nNot all meetings will go smoothly. Some meetings need some heat \u2013 if there are tough issues and differing opinions, these need to be respectfully aired, not swept under the rug.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSometimes, the good proposal can be undermined by a minority who oppose it. Structure the discussion so that all perspectives are heard and the quiet but passive majority isn\u2019t drowned out by a vocal, well-organised minority. This can be achieved simply by calling out who you\u2019d like to hear from.\n\nIf the team is getting stuck, stop the meeting and ask: \u201cWhy are we getting stuck?\u201d If it means parking the agenda item or even rescheduling the meeting, that\u2019s all part of the authority of the chair. Make sure that before the next meeting, you\u2019ve understood the problem so it doesn\u2019t recur.\n\nIn practice, though, you should rarely need to take such steps. If you\u2019ve prepared well and are steering constantly, gently and vigilantly, you\u2019ll read the situation well and make those almost invisible course corrections that lead to a great meeting. People may not be quite sure how you did it, but they\u2019ll be clear that you should chair the next meeting.\n\nAnthony Mitchell is co-founder, chairman and chief potential officer of Bendelta.", "description": "Chairing a meeting effectively takes work, but it's a skill worth nurturing.
