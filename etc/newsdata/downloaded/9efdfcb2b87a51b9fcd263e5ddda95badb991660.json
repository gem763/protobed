But President Trump has also suggested the United States could ease up on the company as part of a larger trade deal. Beijing sees Huawei as an important symbol of China\u2019s economic might, and is loath to consider a trade settlement that doesn\u2019t free Huawei from the sales ban.\n\n[Huawei ban threatens U.S. national security, tech companies warn]\n\nIn the meantime, some industry watchers believe Huawei will soon run out of vital parts it needs to build 5G wireless equipment, which underpins the super-fast internet and telecom networks many countries are building.\n\nOf particular importance is technology from Xilinx Inc., of San Jose, Calif., that allows 5G base stations to be re-programmed from afar.\n\nJoe Madden, principal analyst at the research firm Mobile Experts in Campbell, Calif., closely tracked shipments to Huawei as the Chinese company was stockpiling parts. Madden estimates Huawei bought enough of Xilinx\u2019s integrated circuits, known as field-programmable gate arrays, or FPGAs, to last it until next month.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still forecasting them to run out of Xilinx FPGAs in November and to change over to their own parts,\u201d Madden said. That shift could make Huawei\u2019s 5G equipment less attractive for buyers around the world because Huawei\u2019s technology isn\u2019t likely to be as advanced as Xilinx\u2019s, Madden said.\n\nWith the Xilinx FPGAs, \u201cyou can put a 5G network in the field and still change the software after you put it on the tower,\u201d he said. Telecom companies value that flexibility with 5G because the technology is new and will probably require frequent adjustments over time, he said. Huawei\u2019s technology isn\u2019t likely to be \u201cfield programmable\u201d in this way, he said.\n\n\u201cIf the Xilinx chip needs to be changed out, they will be in trouble,\u201d he said.\n\n[Huawei digs in for a long battle with the U.S.]\n\nHuawei has consistently defended its ability to keep growing despite the ban. \u201cAt the beginning of this crisis, no one believed we would make it. However, we survived,\u201d Chief Executive Ren Zhengfei said during an event at Huawei headquarters in Shenzhen last month.\n\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t relying only on our previous inventory to support current production,\u201d Ren said, adding: \u201cThe results from the latter half of this year will prove that we can do well because we have real strength.\u201d\n\nIn May, immediately after the Trump administration banned the sale of U.S. technology to Huawei, most Western companies halted all sales to the Chinese company. Some have since resumed certain sales that they say don\u2019t violate the prohibition. The ban applies to technology made in the United States, and to products made overseas that derive more than 25% of their value from U.S.-origin technology.\n\nThe sales resumption has eased some of the pressure on Huawei. Companies that have confirmed they\u2019ve re-started some sales include Skyworks Solutions of Woburn, Mass., Qorvo Inc. of Greensboro, N.C., Micron Technology of Boise, ID and Arm Ltd., a British semiconductor-design company that conducts some of its R&D in the U.S.\n\nBut Huawei is still cut off from some important components. In August, a top Xilinx executive said the company has resumed shipping some older products to Huawei, but nothing 5G-related.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think we will be selling 5G-based products into Huawei until the government changes its position,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Lorenzo Flores said during a presentation at an investor conference.\n\n\u201cWe know they do depend on our products in many applications, and engineering around that would be difficult,\u201d Flores added. A Xilinx spokeswoman declined to comment further.\n\nThe Trump Administration has granted two 90-day reprieves that have allowed some U.S. sales to Huawei to continue, but those have applied to a limited range of technology, industry executives say. The current reprieve expires Nov. 19.\n\nHuawei says it is racing to re-engineer its products to avoid U.S. chips and software. In an effort to protect its smartphone and device sales from the possible long-term loss of Google's Android operating software, Huawei in August unveiled its own operating system, HarmonyOS. Huawei said it would first launch the software in the Chinese market and later expand it internationally.\n\n[Huawei executive becomes unlikely social media star as Chinese rally to tech giant\u2019s defense]\n\nAnalysts have said a Huawei operating system would have a tough time competing globally with Google and its popular Gmail and Chrome apps. In June, Huawei chief executive Ren said the U.S. blockade was causing a large drop in Huawei\u2019s smartphone sales outside of China.\n\nEven if Huawei loses smartphone sales in the West, the company\u2019s dominant position in China will bolster its financial position, said Dave Burstein, a telecom analyst at STL Partners and publisher of Huawei Report. Burstein discloses two conflicts of interest on his site, saying Huawei has paid his expenses to attend conferences and provided contracting work to STL Partners.\n\nBurstein estimates Chinese consumers will buy up to 200 million 5G phones next year, making up more than half of such phones worldwide. Huawei will account for about 40% of those sales in China, he said.\n\nLikewise, Chinese telecom companies will buy a large portion of all 5G network equipment sold worldwide in the coming years, Burstein said, with Huawei and Chinese rival ZTE accounting for most of those sales.", "description": "", "authors": ["Jeanne Whalen", "Reporter Covering Business Around The World", "October At Pm", "Jeanne Whalen Is A Reporter Covering Business Around The World.
