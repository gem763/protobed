Its development took two years and the supply of the token is already worth over $20 million.\n\nMeanwhile, the physical gold is held in vaults managed by bullion brand PAMP in Ticino, Switzerland. It is tokenized using the Ocean Bitcoin sidechain developed by blockchain firm CommerceBlock.\n\nSustainability of gold meets Bitcoin\u2019s security\n\nThe project reportedly leverages the immutability of Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, with each token being equivalent to a tenth of a troy ounce of gold. The legal entity behind the token is also based out of Switzerland and is a member of the Swiss self-regulatory organization Financial Services Standards Association.\n\nCoinShares president Danny Masters commented, highlighting the advantages of combining physical gold with Bitcoin\u2019s security. He explained:\n\n\u201cDGLD combines the stability of the world's most sustainable asset, gold, with the security of the most resilient network in the world, Bitcoin. [...] You can now have the peace of mind that comes with physical gold held in a Swiss vault, with the same convenience as holding an ETF on gold, but not the same levels of middlemen.\u201d\n\nAdvantageous regulatory framework\n\nDGLD is not subject to the same regulatory constraints as gold-based investment products such as exchange-traded funds.\n\nThe token reportedly falls under category five of the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority taxonomy on stablecoins, which is reserved for crypto assets linked to commodities with property rights. MKS president Marwan Shakarchi commented:\n\n\u201cWith DGLD, we have created a new gold property format that allows you to digitally use physical gold stored in a vault 24/7. DGLD has the potential to profoundly change the way gold is used on a daily basis.\u201d\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported last week, Australia\u2019s largest precious metal refinery, the Perth Mint, and InfiniGold, a fintech startup focused on precious metals digitization, have jointly launched a gold-backed digital token as well.", "description": "Gold held in Swiss vaults has been tokenized on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain with ticker DGLD by a consortium of companies", "authors": ["Adrian Zmudzinski"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvODRkOTQ3OGIzM2U0ZTI1Yzk3ZDNjYWYyM2Y1NTMzMDcuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
