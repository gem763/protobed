We were trying to look for a room and then this guy who worked there, John the maintenance guy, I won't do the accident, he said 'Hey girls, how can I help you?'\n\n\"'We were going 'Oh we\u2019re just looking for this room' so he showed us to our suite and everything and he says 'what brings you here to Memphis', and we said 'Oh we\u2019re getting married on Tuesday'. 'Oh my goodness whereabouts?'\n\n\"We said 'Graceland and we\u2019re really excited' and he said 'Tuesday? Tuesday\u2019s my day off. I\u2019d love to come and watch and bring my momma.'\"\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX)\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX)\n\nThe pair had not brought a soul with them but agreed, thinking he would never turn up \"in a million years\".\n\nMichelle, in a beautiful white jumpsuit, and Kate in a vintage white dress, got out of their Cadillac and met Erica the wedding co-ordinator.\n\nShe revealed that two of their \"friends\" had already arrived at the stunning venue - leading the brides to speculate who it could be.\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nMichelle said: \"I\u2019m thinking oh my goodness it\u2019s people from work, it's maybe family, I'm going 'who? who?'\n\n\"And she went 'he\u2019s called John and his mum'.\n\n\"They sat there and he sobbed the whole way through the vows. His mam, because I don\u2019t think she could hear properly, was talking all the way.\n\n\"But it was brilliant and it was lovely. They rocked up in jeans, trainers, leggings, t-shirt, it was amazing. It was brillaint.\n\n\"And they weren't even the witnesses as we had the photographer and Erica the wedding co-ordinator.\"\n\n*This Morning airs weekdays on ITV at 10.30am", "description": "The Vanessa Woodfield actress got married to Emmerdale producer Kate Brooks in Elvis Presley's former Graceland home", "authors": ["Kyle O'Sullivan", "Image", "Ken Mckay Itv Rex", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20539214.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_This-Morning-TV-show-London-UK-08-Oct-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
