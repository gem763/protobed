The company said that despite canceling a Phase 3 trial in March when it appeared that the drug wasn\u2019t working, it now plans to submit aducanumab for Food and Drug Administration approval early next year.\n\nYet in a flurry of notes on Tuesday, shocked analysts warned that aducanumab was far from a sure thing, and noted that the benefits of the drug seemed to be slight.\n\nIn recent trading, the surge had moderated somewhat, with the stock up 26.4% on the day, still far outpacing the S&P 500\u2019s 2.5% gain.\n\n\u201cAt first pass the results still appear to be marginal, with inconsistent treatment effects between the two studies and for different endpoints, but the critical question will be what reassurance the company has received from the FDA,\u201d wrote SVB Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges.\n\nRead more: The Risk to Your Retirement Plans No One Wants to Talk About\n\nBiogen said it had decided to resurrect the drug based on new data that became available after the aducanumab trials were scotched. The company suspended two Phase 3 studies after conducting a \u201cfutility analysis\u201d that found that the drug wasn\u2019t having an effect.\n\nNew data showed that one of the trials did succeed and one failed, and that patients who received higher doses of the drug in the failed trial showed similar results to patients in the successful trial, Biogen said.\n\n\u201cWe believe that these positive results for aducanumab represents a turning point for patients, caregivers, physicians, and scientists in the fight against Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\u201d the company\u2019s chief medical officer, Alfred Sandrock, said on the company\u2019s Tuesday earnings call. \u201cMore broadly, we believe this result represented an inflection point in neuroscience drug development and validate our core strategy.\u201d\n\nYet in a note Tuesday morning, RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahamshighlighted data in one Biogen slide that showed that in one of the studies, called Engage, patients in the intent-to-treat population who received a high dose of the drug saw a 2% worsening of symptoms compared with the placebo group, based on a key measure. Patients in the same cohort in the other trial saw a 23% improvement.\n\n\u201cThough FDA apparently provided some endorsement for the idea of filing, which could maintain some probability of approvability, we believe the new details suggest the data may be more mixed than initially perceived, and we believe the ENGAGE failure will be a point of controversy as investors debate [aducanumab\u2019s] prospects,\u201d Abrahams wrote.\n\nIn a note Tuesday, Mizuho analyst Salim Syed questioned why the trials would have turned out differently from each other. \u201cSo the question here is why would two identically designed studies have disparate results,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe really need to understand why. This is why the FDA typically requires two trials, to rule out a fluke.\u201d\n\nEvercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat wrote that, even if the FDA approves the drug, \u201cmajor commercial acceptance is a whole different debate.\u201d\n\nThe reversal from Biogen was major news at the National Alzheimer\u2019s Summit, which started Tuesday in Washington. Speaking at the summit, Jeffrey Cummings of the Cleveland Clinic said that the number of clinical trials for cancer drugs far outstripped those for Alzheimer\u2019s drugs. \u201cThat may have changed today,\u201d Cummings said.\n\nCantor Fitzgerald analyst Alethia Young, in a note out Tuesday, was also positive on the news. \u201cWe are currently reviewing our model based on today\u2019s news but think that the big stock move is warranted as investors probably at least move to 50-60% confidence for a potential approval of aducanumab,\u201d she wrote.\n\nThe new FDA submission will be based on the updated data set, not a new trial.\n\n\u2014Reshma Kapadia contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Josh Nathan-Kazis at josh.nathan-kazis@barrons.com", "description": "Shares were up as high as 37% in early trading after the biotech company seemingly erased its signal failure of the year.
