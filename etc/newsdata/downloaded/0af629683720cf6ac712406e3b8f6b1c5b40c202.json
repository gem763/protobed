Photo: UrbanStems\n\nToday is October 16, which means it\u2019s Boss\u2019s Day. It is also National Feral Cat Day, but nobody is likely to expect you to buy a flower arrangement for a feral cat.\n\nWhat about your boss though? I got two emails this week from UrbanStems, an online florist, proposing items I might send to say \u201cthanks for all you do\u201d to \u201cthe ones who do it all,\u201d which is to say, the bosses. This made me wonder: Do people actually celebrate Boss\u2019s Day? Have my managers been expecting me to buy them flowers? I definitely have never done that. (All I\u2019m getting my boss for Boss\u2019s Day is this column.) And when I briefly was a manager, at Business Insider, none of my ungrateful employees ever got me anything for Boss\u2019s Day.\n\nGoogle Trends data suggests limited interest in Boss\u2019s Day. Like most days of celebration, search interest in Boss\u2019s Day is heavily concentrated toward the day itself and its immediate run-up. Peak interest in Boss\u2019s Day is typically about 4 percent of what you see for Valentine\u2019s Day and 6 percent of Mother\u2019s Day. Boss\u2019s Day interest is about equal to the better-established Administrative Professionals\u2019 Day, but bear in mind, there are only about 3.8 million secretaries and administrative assistants in the U.S. workforce. Few workers have a secretary while almost everyone has a boss, so on a relative basis, we\u2019re apparently much less likely to think we need to do anything for the boss on his or her special day.\n\nBut UrbanStems says some people really do buy flowers for Boss\u2019s Day. The company\u2019s sales volume on Boss\u2019s Day is typically about 40 percent above normal, according to Megan Bailey Darmody, its director of marketing. (For comparison, Administrative Professionals\u2019 Day, in April, typically brings a sales bump of 80 to 100 percent, Darmody says.) To increase interest in Boss\u2019s Day, UrbanStems takes a broad approach to the concept of \u201cboss,\u201d encouraging customers to think not just about their managers but anyone else in their lives who deserves recognition on Boss\u2019s Day for being a total boss.\n\n\u201cIt is not as big of holiday for us as it may be for a traditional florist,\u201d Darmody says. But even if you look at other floral websites, you\u2019ll see pretty half-hearted attempts to sell you on Boss\u2019s Day. At FTD.com on October 15 (Boss\u2019s Day Eve), the top banner sought to sell you flowers for fall. Boss\u2019s Day was listed only well down the page, next to Sweetest Day \u2014 a celebration of being sweet to each other that appears to be observed on October 19, but only in the Midwest.\n\nBoss\u2019s Day was first proposed in 1958 by Patricia Bays Haroski, who was a secretary at State Farm. Her boss happened to also be her father, and she didn\u2019t think he was appreciated enough at the office, so she decided his birthday, October 16, should be Boss\u2019s Day. Several websites and even a couple of newspaper articles claim Haroski was particularly motivated by a sense that young workers don\u2019t appreciate how hard their bosses work \u2014 a nice detail since it suggests complaints about millennial workers\u2019 attitudes arose more than 20 years before the first millennials were born \u2014 but I was unable to determine the original source of this claim and so I\u2019m concerned it may just be one of those things baby boomers repeat on the internet without regard for whether it\u2019s true. In any case, by 1962, Haroski had gotten the governor of Illinois to proclaim Boss\u2019s Day, and in 1979, Hallmark started selling Boss\u2019s Day cards.\n\nAllison Green, who writes the Ask a Manager blog, writes annually about why Boss\u2019s Day is bad: \u201cIt\u2019s not appropriate to solicit recognition from people below you,\u201d \u201cObligatory recognition is silly,\u201d \u201cPeople shouldn\u2019t feel obligated to give gifts to someone who has power over their livelihood.\u201d Most people seem to have gotten this message, but if people in your workplace feel they must celebrate Boss\u2019s Day, she suggests, sign a card. Given the relatively slim internet search and flower-sales interest in Boss\u2019s Day, I think she has mostly won this argument.\n\nBut the Society for Human Resource Management proposes another solution to Boss\u2019s Day awkwardness: Have the company handle recognizing the bosses so employees don\u2019t have to. A standardized Boss\u2019s Day gift to managers from the corporation itself can take the pressure off individual employees to do anything. This seems fair enough to me: The person who ought to be most grateful to your boss for his or her work is your boss\u2019s boss (also known as your grandboss), so why shouldn\u2019t any gifting be handled from the top of the org chart?\n\nOf course, that suggestion comes from Cord Himelstein, who is a vice-president at HALO Recognition, a company that administers employee recognition programs. Just as UrbanStems wants to sell you flowers, HALO wants to sell corporations systematized ways to thank their employees. Anyone who has a product or service that could be useful for Boss\u2019s Day may try to sell it to you. But you don\u2019t have to let them be the boss of you.", "description": "But there is a small spike in gift giving around this somewhat puzzling day of recognition.
