Penny Family Photo\n\nPenney was to stop Flight 93 \u2014 knowing the pilot could be her father.\n\nPenney was prepared to give her life on Sept. 11 when she was ordered to down the hijacked planes \u2014 even knowing that the pilot for one of them could have been her father.\n\nPenney was prepared to give her life on Sept. 11 when she was ordered to down the hijacked planes \u2014 even knowing that the pilot for one of them could have been her father.\n\nLate in the morning of the Tuesday that changed everything, Lt. Heather \u201cLucky\u201d Penney was on a runway at Andrews Air Force Base and ready to fly. She had her hand on the throttle of an F-16 and she had her orders: Bring down United Airlines Flight 93. The day\u2019s fourth hijacked airliner seemed to be hurtling toward Washington. Penney, one of the first two combat pilots in the air that morning, was told to stop it.\n\nThe one thing she didn\u2019t have as she roared into the crystalline sky was live ammunition. Or missiles. Or anything at all to throw at a hostile aircraft.\n\nExcept her own plane. So that was the plan.\n\nBecause the surprise attacks were unfolding, in that innocent age, faster than they could arm war planes, Penney and her commanding officer went up to fly their jets straight into a Boeing 757.\n\n\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be shooting it down. We\u2019d be ramming the aircraft,\u201d Penney recalls of her charge that day. \u201cI would essentially be a kamikaze pilot.\u201d\n\nIn this 2011 interview, Major Heather Penney talks about how she heard about the Sept. 11 attacks. (C-SPAN)\n\nFor years, Penney, one of the first generation of female combat pilots in the country, gave no interviews about her experiences on Sept. 11 (which included, eventually, escorting Air Force One back into Washington\u2019s suddenly highly restricted airspace).\n\nBut 10 years later, she is reflecting on one of the lesser-told tales of that endlessly examined morning: how the first counterpunch the U.S. military prepared to throw at the attackers was effectively a suicide mission.\n\n\u201cWe had to protect the airspace any way we could,\u201d she said last week in her office at Lockheed Martin, where she is a director in the F-35 program.\n\nPenney, now a major but still a petite blonde with a Colgate grin, is no longer a combat flier. She flew two tours in Iraq and she serves as a part-time National Guard pilot, mostly hauling VIPs around in a military Gulfstream. She takes the stick of her own vintage 1941 Taylorcraft tail-dragger whenever she can.\n\nBut none of her thousands of hours in the air quite compare with the urgent rush of launching on what was supposed to be a one-way flight to a midair collision.\n\nFirst of her kind\n\nShe was a rookie in the autumn of 2001, the first female F-16 pilot they\u2019d ever had at the 121st Fighter Squadron of the D.C. Air National Guard. She had grown up smelling jet fuel. Her father flew jets in Vietnam and still races them. Penney got her pilot\u2019s licence when she was a literature major at Purdue. She planned to be a teacher. But during a graduate program in American studies, Congress opened up combat aviation to women.\n\n\u201cI signed up immediately,\u201d Penney says. \u201cI wanted to be a fighter pilot like my dad.\u201d\n\nOn that Tuesday, they had just finished two weeks of air combat training in Nevada. They were sitting around a briefing table when someone looked in to say a plane had hit the World Trade Center in New York. When it happened once, they assumed it was some yahoo in a Cessna. When it happened again, they knew it was war.\n\n[On 9/11, a tiny Canadian town opened its runways and its heart to 7,000 stranded travelers]\n\nBut the surprise was complete. In the monumental confusion of those first hours, it was impossible to get clear orders. Nothing was ready. The jets were still equipped with dummy bullets from the training mission.\n\nAs remarkable as it seems now, there were no armed aircraft standing by and no system in place to scramble them over Washington. Before that morning, all eyes were looking outward, still scanning the old Cold War threat paths for planes and missiles coming over the polar ice cap.\n\n\u201cThere was no perceived threat at the time, especially one coming from the homeland like that,\u201d says Col. George Degnon, vice commander of the 113th Wing at Andrews. \u201cIt was a little bit of a helpless feeling, but we did everything humanly possible to get the aircraft armed and in the air. It was amazing to see people react.\u201d\n\nThings are different today, \u00adDegnon says. At least two \u201chot-cocked\u201d planes are ready at all times, their pilots never more than yards from the cockpit.\n\nA third plane hit the Pentagon, and almost at once came word that a fourth plane could be on the way, maybe more. The jets would be armed within an hour, but somebody had to fly now, weapons or no weapons.\n\n\u201cLucky, you\u2019re coming with me,\u201d barked Col. Marc Sasseville.\n\nThey were gearing up in the pre-flight life-support area when Sasseville, struggling into his flight suit, met her eye.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to go for the cockpit,\u201d Sasseville said.\n\nShe replied without hesitating.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take the tail.\u201d\n\nIt was a plan. And a pact.\n\n\u2018Let\u2019s go!\u2019\n\nPenney had never scrambled a jet before. Normally the pre-flight is a half-hour or so of methodical checks. She automatically started going down the list.\n\n\u201cLucky, what are you doing? Get your butt up there and let\u2019s go!\u201d Sasseville shouted.\n\nShe climbed in, rushed to power up the engines, screamed for her ground crew to pull the chocks. The crew chief still had his headphones plugged into the fuselage as she nudged the throttle forward. He ran along pulling safety pins from the jet as it moved forward.\n\nShe muttered a fighter pilot\u2019s prayer \u2014 \u201cGod, don\u2019t let me [expletive] up\u201d \u2014 and followed Sasse\u00adville into the sky.\n\nThey screamed over the smoldering Pentagon, heading northwest at more than 400 mph, flying low and scanning the clear horizon. Her commander had time to think about the best place to hit the enemy.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t train to bring down airliners,\u201d said Sasseville, now stationed at the Pentagon. \u201cIf you just hit the engine, it could still glide and you could guide it to a target. My thought was the cockpit or the wing.\u201d\n\nHe also thought about his ejection seat. Would there be an instant just before impact?\n\n\u201cI was hoping to do both at the same time,\u201d he says. \u201cIt probably wasn\u2019t going to work, but that\u2019s what I was hoping.\u201d\n\nPenney worried about missing the target if she tried to bail out.\n\n\u201cIf you eject and your jet soars through without impact . . .\u201d she trails off, the thought of failing more dreadful than the thought of dying.\n\nBut she didn\u2019t have to die. She didn\u2019t have to knock down an airliner full of kids and salesmen and girlfriends. They did that themselves.\n\nIt would be hours before Penney and Sasseville learned that United 93 had already gone down in Pennsylvania, an insurrection by hostages willing to do just what the two Guard pilots had been willing to do: Anything. And everything.\n\n\u201cThe real heroes are the passengers on Flight 93 who were willing to sacrifice themselves,\u201d Penney says. \u201cI was just an accidental witness to history.\u201d\n\nShe and Sasseville flew the rest of the day, clearing the airspace, escorting the president, looking down onto a city that would soon be sending them to war.\n\nLater, as the Penney family checked in on each other from around the country, they marveled at the other fateful twist on the extraordinary events: the possibility that Penney\u2019s own father could well have been in the cockpit of her airliner target.\n\nJohn Penney was a captain at United Airlines at the time. He had been flying East Coasts routes all the previous month. The daughter had no way of knowing whether the father was airborne or not.\n\n\u201cWe talked about the possibility that I could have been on the plane,\u201d Col. John Penney said. \u201cShe knew I was flying that kind of rotation. But we never fell down and emotionally broke apart or anything like that. She\u2019s a fighter pilot; I\u2019m a fighter pilot.\u201d\n\nPenney is a single mom of two girls now. She still loves to fly. And she still thinks often of that extraordinary ride down the runway a decade ago.\n\n\u201cI genuinely believed that was going to be the last time I took off,\u201d she says. \u201cIf we did it right, this would be it.\u201d", "description": "A pilot reflects on one of the lesser-told tales of Sept. 11: how the first counterpunch the U.S. military prepared to throw at the attackers was effectively a suicide mission.", "authors": ["Steve Hendrix", "Feature Writer Without Portfolio Based On Local Enterprise But Filing For National", "Foreign", "Magazine", "Other Sections", "September"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2011/09/07/Style/Images/110713-F-JQ560-005_1315429380.jpg?t=20170517", "published_at": "2015-09-06"}
