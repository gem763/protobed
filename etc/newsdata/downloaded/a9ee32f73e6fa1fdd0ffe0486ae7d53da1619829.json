Her parents, she said, are \u201cright-wing,\u201d and they praise every move of Poland\u2019s conservative ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party.\n\n\u201cWe started to talk about a political reform, and then we ended with that I\u2019m a disgrace for the family, how could I grow up like this, that my partner should cut my throat and other nice choice words,\u201d she said. \"Coming from both sides, to be fair.\"\n\n\u201cThe worst thing this government has done to us is that it divided people\u201d \u2014 Kasia, PR manager from Warsaw\n\nMarta\u2019s divided family isn\u2019t the only one. As the rival campaigns ramp up their outreach ahead of the vote on October 13, Poles are being increasingly asked to pick sides in what's more than a simple political spat.\n\nAs is the case in an increasing number of countries \u2014 France, the United States, the United Kingdom \u2014 politics in Poland cuts not so much along the traditional party lines of the 20th century but along new divisions: \u201cliberal\u201d vs. \u201cilliberal,\u201d \u201curban,\u201d vs. \u201crural,\u201d \u201cpatriotic\u201d vs. \u201cdemocratic.\u201d\n\nIt's a split that cuts as much across the dinner table as across different parts of the country. \u201cThis dispute goes down ... to the institutions and the society,\u201d said Andrzej Rychard, a sociologist with the Polish Academy of Sciences.\n\nDivided country\n\nA study published this year by the University of Warsaw\u2019s Center for Research on Prejudice found supporters of Poland\u2019s ruling and opposition parties hold strikingly negative feelings toward each other. The antagonism is sharper among the opposition parties.\n\nPOLAND NATIONAL PARLIAMENT ELECTION POLL OF POLLS\n\nFor more polling data from across Europe visit POLITICO Poll of Polls.\n\n\u201cFor some time I believed talking about \u2018two Polands\u2019 was exaggerated and simplified,\u201d said Rychard. \u201cI thought statements like, 'It cuts across the family table, that you can\u2019t come to an agreement during a family birthday,' was a bit of mythology.\u201d No longer.\n\nFor many in the country, however, it's a reality.\n\n\u201cThe worst thing this government has done to us is that it divided people,\u201d said Kasia, a 30 year-old PR manager from Warsaw. She said she lost contact with several friends after disagreements on issues like migration policy.\n\nZuzanna, who lives in the U.S., said she hadn\u2019t visited her family during her last trip to Poland, thanks to disagreements over women's rights.\n\nEven while abroad, they\u2019d argued over Polish politics on Facebook. \"[The situation in Poland] is much worse than in the U.S. because here the minorities have 'tasted' their rights, respect and they know they can demand them,\" she said.\n\nMedical student Krzysztof said he\u2019d minimized contact with his parents, because they don\u2019t accept his LGBT friends. \"[Since Law and Justice came to power] the public media have very intensively promoted a version of the world, where only their true Christian values are constantly threatened and attacked, which goes in line with what my parents think,\" he said. \"Since then they've been much more certain of their rights and it's much more difficult to explain something to them or even to have a conversation.\"\n\nPolitical debate in Poland today is less an argument over the country\u2019s future than \u201ctwo semantically closed universes,\" said Rados\u0142aw Markowski, a professor at Warsaw's University of Social Sciences and Humanities.\n\nRather than criticizing an opponent\u2019s policies, Poles now attack their interlocutor's legitimacy, he said. \u201cThe degenerated language, in this seemingly homogenous country, is one of the biggest challenges for the quality of Polish democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the narrative of contempt and aversion.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe intensity of this conflict is very strong, stronger than in other European countries.\u201d\n\nTalk turns to violence\n\nThe depth of the growing schism is perhaps most obvious in the socially liberal city of Gda\u0144sk, in northern Poland, where an opposition coalition outpolled PiS 60 percent to 26 percent in May\u2019s European Parliament election.\n\nThe city was shaken by the January murder of Mayor Pawe\u0142 Adamowicz. His assailant was a mentally ill former convict who blamed Adamowicz\u2019s Civic Platform party for his imprisonment.\n\nAfter the tragedy, the whole country grieved, but not for long. Some PiS supporters have taken to calling the city a \u201cGerman republic,\u201d claiming its citizens aren\u2019t \u201creal Poles,\u201d and dubbed new Mayor Aleksandra Dulkiewicz \u201cFrau Dulkiewicz.\u201d\n\nIn July, the magazine W sieci, which generally supports the ruling party, published an issue featuring Nazi swastikas and portraits of Adamowicz, Dulkiewicz and European Council President Donald Tusk (another Gda\u0144sk native) with the headline: \u201cDoes Gda\u0144sk want to join Germany?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can see there\u2019s a social division,\u201d Dulkiewicz said, sitting by a high window on the 33rd floor of an office tower overlooking nearby shipyards and the Baltic Sea. She cites her own efforts to lobby Poland\u2019s culture minister, Piotr Gli\u0144ski, after the government refused to fund a new cultural center in the city, the European Solidarity Center, devoted to the history of the Solidarity movement.\n\n\u201cIt was a very difficult conversation ... His understanding of the word 'solidarity' was totally different to mine,\u201d she said, adding that she wanted to look to the future while his frame of reference was the historical Solidarity labor movement that helped bring down communism decades ago.\n\nWhile Dulkiewicz is trying to calm social tensions, not all government opponents are doing the same. There's a sense of rage and frustration among parts of the liberal opposition when they look at PiS's stubbornly high opinion poll numbers.\n\nA Civic Platform Senator Jerzy Wcis\u0142a called PiS voters \u201cplebs\u201d while judge Jerzy St\u0119pie\u0144 referred to them as \u201cfeudal peasants.\u201d\n\nResentment at this type of language is palpable in PiS strongholds. In Kobylin-Borzymy, a county of 3,000 nestled amid cornfields in northeast Poland, the ruling party won 85 percent in the last general election. Non-partisan Mayor Dariusz Sikorski has experience with journalists coming to find \u201ctypical PiS voters.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t say that our people are stupid,\u201d he said \u2014 more than once. \u201cPeople here simply have their values. They respect the land and they respect the family. It doesn\u2019t do any harm to anyone.\u201d\n\nRychard, the sociologist, is nevertheless hopeful. Poles are getting richer, better educated, more secular and pro-European, he said. That should, in theory, shift the country toward the political center.\n\n\u201cIn a long perspective, these processes will inevitably blur this dual Poland,\u201d he said.\n\nBut that's not going to have much immediate impact on PiS's electoral fortunes.", "description": "Divisions deepen as the country heads to the polls on October 13.", "authors": ["Zosia Wanat"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1170046363-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
