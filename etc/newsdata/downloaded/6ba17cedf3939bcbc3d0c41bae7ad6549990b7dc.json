But now that we've become a net capital exporter we find ourselves with a capital account deficit and a current account surplus.\n\nReserve Bank deputy governor Guy Debelle says the structure of Australia's external accounts has become one of increasing resilience.\n\n\"While Australia doesn't have the exorbitant privilege of the United States, the external accounts do not constitute a source of vulnerability and have become increasingly resilient over the past 30 years,\" he says.\n\nThe new position has also eased, to some extent, the nervousness some Australians have with foreign ownership of assets.\n\nFor decades and even until recently there has been strong resistance to foreign ownership. In his 1972 \"Its Time\" speech Gough Whitlam vowed to not only buy back the farm but to buy back assets in other industries that foreigners had taken over.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It's time to stop the great takeover of Australia,\" Whitlam said. But more important, it's time to start buying Australia back.\"\n\nBuying back the farm was a big concern during Gough Whitlam's government in the 1970s. Russell McPhedran\n\nIn 2015, then treasurer Scott Morrison blocked the sale to Chinese investors of Australia's largest private landholder, S.Kidman & Co, while the concentration of Australia's electricity and gas infrastructure ending up in Chinese-linked ownership became a key area of concern leading to the rejection of Hong Kong-based CK Group's $13 billion bid for east coast gas pipeline owner APA Group.\n\nWhile our new dominance in offshore ownership hasn't exactly prevented us \"selling off the farm\" it has given us a greater sense of self-determination.\n\nQSuper chairman Karl Morris says the change in Australia's ownership of offshore assets has also given the nation greater clout in the global investment market.\n\n\"Our international investors and managers look to us as participants in owning strategic assets ranging from British airports through to commercial property in North America,\" he says.\n\n\"This enhances Australia\u2019s stature in financial markets, as well as delivering strong returns for the members of QSuper\u2019s funds.\u201d\n\nQSuper's investments range from Swiss consumer giant Nestle and global sports brand Nike to the world's largest brewer, Belgium's Anheuser Busch Inbev, along with Asian technology companies such as Korea\u2019s Samsung Electronics.\n\nAB InBev is the world's largest brewer. Bloomberg\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince 2010, QSuper\u2019s exposure to international equities rose from $4 billion to $14 billion \u2013 a 250 per cent increase, despite a reduction in its equity weights.\n\nAnd it is only going to get bigger.\n\nThe Australian Prudential Regulation Authority's June quarterly statistics showed that 50.9 per cent of super's $1.8 trillion investments are in equities, with 24.4 per cent in international listed equities.\n\nThe 2019 NAB Superannuation FX Survey found 72 per cent of funds intend to increase the share of their investments in international assets in the next two years.\n\nFirst State Super chief investment officer Damian Graham says it's critical that super funds invest in offshore equities to diversify beyond domestic stocks.\n\n\"We need to diversify,\" says Damian Graham, CIO of First State Super. Louie Douvis\n\n\"We have multiple holdings in the very large companies such as Alphabet, Apple, GE, JP Morgan, Citi, Pfizer and Tencent in China,\" he says.\n\n\"I liken the process of what is happening now with Australian super funds to that of Canada where they had domestic funds swamping the domestic equities. That happened 10 years ago in Canada and it's happening in Australia now so we need to diversify.\"\n\nFirst State Super's main default investment option has a 30 per cent weighting to overseas equities, and that has grown 5 per cent over the last three years.\n\n\"The growth is likely to continue even more,\" he says, \"Would we open an office offshore and a larger geographical footprint? Well, that depends on governance.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe says part of the difficulty is getting access to the big deals and that means they have to become more active rather than passive investors.\n\n\"There is a tremendous amount of competition for large assets. But we have formed the view that we should not just be buying mature assets. We tend to have more development style investments instead.\"\n\nFirst State injected $500 million into Forth Ports 12 months ago. Forth Ports is one of the largest port operators in the UK and has plenty of growth and development potential. First State also invested $500 million into multifamily real estate with Lendlease in New York, Boston and Chicago nine months ago.\n\nAnd as the Australian dollar has depreciated over this time, the investments have become more valuable.\n\nUnlike a lot of the debt liabilities that Australia has offshore, most equity investments are held in foreign currency so that any depreciation in the Aussie dollar has a powerful effect on the value of such equity assets.\n\n\"We have invested largely on an unhedged basis with the Australian dollar depreciating,\" First State's Graham says. \"This is leading us to have more unhedged.\"\n\nMost of the offshore investment from Australia is destined for the US and the UK. At the end of 2018, Australian investments in the US totalled $719 billion and our investment in the UK tallied $408 billion.\n\nSince super was made compulsory in 1992, Australia's income from assets abroad has grown 2844 per cent to $12.96 billion in the June quarter, according to Australian Bureau of Statistics data. And as this gets bigger it helps increase the current account surplus.\n\nBut the current account surplus has also been helped along by record trade surpluses driven by iron ore and the income from that, especially with China's continually growing appetite.\n\nBut caution must be used here because there are foreign shareholders in our exporter companies such as Rio Tinto. Rio Tinto's shareholder base is majority foreign-owned. The ABS does take this into account when calculating Australia's overall net equity position and income.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCompanies such as BHP and Rio Tinto are also major investors in overseas mines \u2013 they own Escondida, the world's largest copper producer located in northern Chile. While BHP and Rio have eased off their overseas hunt for assets, other big Australian miners have not and are collecting plenty of income from offshore.\n\nAerial photograph of the Red Chris gold mine processing plant in Canada.\n\nThe world's third-biggest gold miner, Newcrest Mining, agreed to pay $1.12 billion for a controlling stake in the Red Chris gold-copper mine in Canada this year. Australian gold producer Northern Star is spending $356 million on an acquisition of a mine in Alaska, while Fortescue Metals confirmed this month that it has submitted a bid to develop two blocks in the giant Simandou iron ore deposit in Guinea.\n\nBlueScope agreed to a $1 billion expansion of the North Star mill in the US, last month, while Australia's richest person, Anthony Pratt, has a $500 million paper mill in Ohio. Pratt, who has billions of dollars invested in the US, attracted President Donald Trump's praise. Australia's packaging giant Amcor bought US packaging business Bemis for $9.2 billion this year.\n\nThen there are the other massive Australian companies such as blood plasma giant CSL, whose global reach is now rapidly expanding into China, and hearing implant company Cochlear, which now sells into more than 100 countries.\n\nOver the past few years, Macquarie Group has also been active. In 2017 it acquired Green Investment Bank from the UK government for \u00a32.3 billion (then worth $3.8 billion) and also completed the acquisition of Cargill Petroleum and Cargill North America Power and Gas trading businesses, expanding Macquarie\u2019s energy platform in the US.\n\nOn behalf of a wide range of investors, Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets (MIRA) acquired Bayer's and LANXESS's stakes in the German chemical park operator, Currenta, which is now worth $5.8 billion. MIRA was also selected by the Indian National Highways Authority for the operation and management of nine national toll roads for $US 1.5 billion ($2.2 billion).\n\nReal estate is an attractive proposition for Australian investors hunting for assets offshore. Goodman Group and Lendlease are clearly leading this foray with big wins to develop property for Amazon and Google.\n\nLendlease chief executive Steve McCann says 31 per cent of the company's $3.7 billion in investments are outside Australia, not to mention the assets it manages for other investors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Lendlease\u2019s international investments are strong as a result of the group extending its successful urbanisation strategy into targeted global gateway cities. More than 80 per cent of our $81 billion urbanisation pipeline is outside Australia.\"\n\nMajor projects include Euston Station and Silvertown Quays in London, urban redevelopment in Milan and The Exchange TRX, an integrated development in the heart of Kuala Lumpur.\n\nEuston Station is on the slate for Lendlease.\n\n\"These projects will drive significant future development profit and growth in both investments and funds under management,\" McCann says.\n\n\"The assets will also contribute positively to Australia\u2019s foreign equity position and the associated income will contribute positively to Australia\u2019s current account position.\n\n\"This is consistent with the trend of institutional investors, in particular, Australian superannuation funds, increasing their capital allocations to international regions.\"\n\nAmong Lendlease's investors is Australia's biggest super fund AustralianSuper. Its biggest single investment globally is in Google's headquarters in London's Kings Cross.\n\nAustralianSuper chief investment officer Mark Delaney says the fund itself is expanding its office in London to 50 staff over the next five years and opening an office in New York as part of its increased focus on global markets, both private and public.\n\nIn the past five years, AustralianSuper has seen the amount of funds invested globally double from $36 billion to $76 billion. Its top holdings offshore include Microsoft, Visa, Amazon and Alphabet, as well as a shopping centre in Hawaii called Ala Moana.\n\nArtist image of Ala Moana shopping center in Honolulu Joe Armao\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Increased exposure to global markets will deliver great long-term investment opportunities for members and also have the added benefit of assisting the broader Australian economy,\" Delaney says.\n\nWhile this massive offshore expansion shows that Australia is mature enough to fund its own economic growth, attracting capital into Australia is still important. Australia currently still has $3.8 trillion in foreign liabilities.\n\nAnd while this amount of investment into Australia is clearly not growing at the pace it did during the days of the mining boom, there are questions as to whether all this balancing of payments stuff still matters.\n\nPaul Keating's former economic adviser Ric Simes says the situation still needs to be monitored.\n\n\"The current account deficit was central to a lot of the macroeconomic economic debate in Australia in the 1980s through to the 1990s,\" he tells The Australian Financial Review.\n\nHe recalls how retired professor of economics at Australian National University John Pitchford and, to an extent, some in the bureaucracy at the time argued that the current account \"shouldn\u2019t have been a focus for policy\".\n\n\"The argument went that unless the deficit reflected something wrong with our fundamentals \u2013 and this was never explicitly identified \u2013 then the deficit simply reflected the outcome of private agents making their investment and saving decisions in a manner that best suited them.\"\n\nThis theory is known as the \"consenting adults\" theory.\n\n\"At the time, the logic behind this was accepted in principle, but nagging doubts remained that it would be risky to continue to run large deficits and build up foreign debt,\" Simes says.\n\n\"Even if all this is the result of consenting adults making rational decisions, the main cause of recessions in advanced economies relates to financial sector imbalances.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"You should keep an eye on unduly high levels of debt \u2013 and a rapid build up of such debt \u2013 which may be an indicator of significant imbalances building in different parts of the economy.\"\n\nAustralia's overall financial position shows that we have a current net debt position of $1.1 trillion and some of that can fluctuate depending on exchange rates.\n\nHowever, as RBA deputy governor Debelle noted in August \"the vast bulk of Australia's foreign debt is denominated in Australian dollars, not foreign currency\" so that when our currency depreciates we don't see our liabilities go through the roof as it did when Keating warned that Australia was in danger of becoming a \"banana republic\".\n\n\"Australia's balance of payments and external accounts have undergone a significant transformation since the days of Paul Keating's banana republic comment,\" Debelle says.\n\nAnd the balance of payments continues to transform. In the three months to June 30 this year Australia started to change a long-held habit on debt, according to the ABS.\n\nThe total amount of financial transactions between Australia and the rest of the world in the period showed that, for first quarter in 39 years, we acted as a net lender. That is, during those three months, the transactions that occurred saw Australia pay $2.2 billion of debt and lend $1.8 billion.\n\nAnd as the growth of super funds continues \u2013 highly likely given the legislated increases in compulsory super to 12 per cent of wages by 2025 \u2013 we can be fairly confident this \"significant transformation\" of our external accounts will continue to strengthen well into the future.", "description": "Australia's superannuation funds and largest listed companies are buying everything offshore from Apple and Alphabet to Nestle and Nike, Canadian gold mines and India toll roads, but what does it mean for our own economy?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3613%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/6eac82400e6aa3c9706c6294c6048b62af882823", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
