The CDU, with 15.6 percent, also saw its support fall, while the Greens increased their share to 10.8 percent.\n\nThe big winner was the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which surged to 23.5 percent, scoring second place.\n\nAll other parties vowed not to team up with the AfD \u2014 leaving them with the option of either a Kenya coalition or a left-leaning government between the SPD, the Greens and the far-left Linke. The latter, however, would only have a slim majority in the state's 88-seat parliament.\n\nA final accord in Brandenburg could take weeks to work out. The Greens are pushing to include a ban on new mining in the state, which includes big coal regions in its eastern periphery, while other measures still under discussion include new investment in regional transport, the introduction of \u20ac365-a-year public transport tickets and higher wages for some contractors.\n\nNegotiations are also continuing on a coalition in the larger state of Saxony, home to major eastern cities such as Leipzig and Dresden. Another regional election will take place in Thuringia, also a part of the former East Germany, on October 27.", "description": "A government between the Christian Democrats, the Social Democrats and the Greens would shut out the far right as well as the far left.", "authors": ["Joshua Posaner", "Matthew Karnitschnig"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-888786662-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
