FIFA confirmed Sportsmail's story that Liverpool's games will take place at the Education City Stadium. Tickets go on sale this month.\n\nLiverpool fans will benefit from subsidised hotels and cheap tickets at the Club World Cup\n\nThe Association of Football Agents' (AFA) chosen method of opposing FIFA's proposals to introduce stricter regulations, including a cap on the percentage commission they can charge on a player transfer, is unlikely to elicit much sympathy from ordinary fans struggling to cope with the rising costs of following the sport.\n\nThe AFA are building up a fighting fund prior to possibly taking legal action against FIFA and last week asked agents to make donations to an account at private wealth manager Coutts, which is the eighth oldest bank in the world and includes the Royal family among its many celebrity clients.\n\nPOCH GOES ALL 'BIG BROTHER'\n\nSome Tottenham players have started jokingly referring to Mauricio Pochettino as 'Big Brother' due to the manager's habit of watching training sessions on the club's CCTV system. The Argentine has appeared increasingly detached from his players at the start of this campaign and, as Sportsmail revealed earlier this week, often stays inside to monitor training remotely, hence his new nickname.\n\nSpurs players have also been speculating whether Pochettino will become a more visible presence when Amazon Prime begin filming their documentary about the club's season later this year.", "description": "AHEAD OF THE GAME: Raheem Sterling's defence of Bernardo Silva, following his team-mate's tweet about Benjamin Mendy, went down badly with a number of black Premier League players.", "authors": ["Matt Hughes For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/21/19314134-0-image-a-100_1570219856683.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
