So it truly is a remarkable coincidence that this happened to the Winstanleys three times.\n\nBut aren\u2019t identical twins fascinating? I certainly think so. From a medical perspective, what they tell us about nature versus nurture and who we are is equally important.\n\nTwins allow scientists to explore the impact that our genes have on shaping our bodies, minds and personalities. But they also show us the limits of genetics, and the extent to which we are still in control of our own destinies.\n\nJake (left) and Seth (right).

The Jims were identical twins who were separated as babies and adopted into different families. Aged 39, the Jims met up again for the first time. They discovered that their lives were peppered with bizarre coincidences.\n\nSEPARATED IN 1933: ONE TWIN GREW UP JEWISH, THE OTHER AS A NAZI One of the strangest stories of identical twins that I have come across is that of brothers Jack Yufe and Oskar Stohr. Jack and Oskar were separated as babies in 1933 following their parents\u2019 divorce. Jack stayed with his father, while the mother had custody of Oskar. Jack\u2019s father brought him up Jewish in Trinidad, and he went on to serve in the Israeli navy. Oskar\u2019s mother took him to Germany, where he was raised as a Roman Catholic \u2013 and joined the Hitler Youth. In 1954 they met for the first time \u2013 and did not get on. They did not meet again until 1979 when they joined the Minnesota Twin Family Study. Researchers noted differences in personality but they were a similar weight and both had receding hairlines, wore glasses and had moustaches. Over time they came to like each other, providing they didn\u2019t discuss the war. Oskar died in 1997, Jack lived until 2015.\n\nBoth had a first wife called Linda. Both had got divorced and remarried, this time to someone called Betty. One had called his first son James Alan, the other had called his Allan. And both had been employed in law enforcement as sheriffs. They both loved woodwork, were heavy smokers and drinkers and had the same favourite brand of cigarettes and beer. When they met, they were both driving a Chevrolet.\n\nThe Jims became members of the Minnesota Twin Family Study, set up in the US by Professor Tom Bouchard. Like thousands of other twins who would be recruited for studies, Bouchard\u2019s team got the Jims to complete detailed questionnaires about every aspect of their lives.\n\nAmong the findings of the study was the observation that although a surprising number of our characteristics are linked to our genes, their influence varies. Height, for example, is almost completely genetically predetermined: identical twins are almost always the same height. And when it comes to weight and IQ, genes exert their influence more strongly over time: in these measures, twins are likely to become more identical as they age. This might explain why we \u2018turn into\u2019 our parents.\n\nIf you have inherited genes that make you hungrier than others, becoming overweight isn\u2019t inevitable. You just might find it harder staying a healthy weight. The same is true of conditions such as Alzheimer\u2019s, which twin studies suggest can be highly heritable. If one twin has Alzheimer\u2019s then the odds that the other will get it are about 50 per cent. But there are things you can do, from losing weight or eating well and exercising, that will reduce your risk of developing dementia, even if you have inherited some slightly dodgy genes.\n\nJohn Winstanley (right) is father to twins sets James and Joshua, and Jack and Joel. His brother Dave (left) is father of Seth and Jake. Although John and Dave are identical, experts said this should not influence the likelihood of non-identical twins which run on the female side of the family\n\nJames and Joshua. I can\u2019t be the only one who was intrigued by the story, which emerged last week\n\nWhat twins can tell us about gut health\n\nWe have our own version of the Minnesota Twin Family Study here in Britain called TwinsUK. Established in 1993, it is based at King\u2019s College London and has more than 14,000 identical and non-identical twins on its books. Professor Tim Spector is director of the project. Among other things, he is using twins to research our microbiome \u2013 the bacteria, virus, fungi and other organisms that live in our guts, which also have a huge influence on our destiny.\n\nIn one of Prof Spector\u2019s recent studies, he analysed the chemicals produced by the gut microbes of 500 pairs of twins. By doing this they were able to identify biomarkers \u2013 chemicals produced in the body \u2013 that indicate high levels of internal fat in the abdomen, known as visceral fat. This is the worst sort of fat \u2013 it is strongly linked with type 2 diabetes, heart disease and hypertension. Normally you would need to have a special scan to detect it. They were also able to show that, although the tendency to build up visceral fat is partly inherited, the microbes that live in your gut play an important role.\n\nAs Dr Jonas Zierer, lead author of this study, put it: \u2018This is exciting, because unlike our genes, the gut microbes can be modified with probiotics, with drugs or with high-fibre diets.\u2019\n\nTim and his team were surprised to discover that when it comes to fat and sugar, even identical twins don\u2019t have the same response to eating exactly the same foods.\n\nHe is studying identical twins who are different weights to find out more about the role gut microbes play in weight gain.\n\nThe idea is that, one day, we\u2019ll know more about why some people gain weight easily, while others don\u2019t.", "description": "DR MICHAEL MOSLEY: Apparently, fathers who are identical twins are no more likely to have non-identical twin children.
