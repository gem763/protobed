A smattering of of recognisable faces in a film can distract programmers from a small thing like quality and so the lineup reliably features at least four or five flashy but time-wasting disappointments, forgettable films that will live and die at the festival, pre-premiere hype evaporating by the time the credits roll.\n\nHope Gap review \u2013 Annette Bening stumbles in empty divorce drama Read more\n\nOne of this year\u2019s most glaring examples is Blackbird, a film that might tempt festivalgoers with its high-wattage cast but will struggle to exist anywhere else. The promise of Susan Sarandon, Kate Winslet, Mia Wasikowka and Sam Neill is enticing, especially given steerage by Roger Michell, a solid director whose credits include Notting Hill, Le Week-End and 2017\u2019s underrated adaptation of My Cousin Rachel. But it\u2019s all just window dressing, a superficial sheen added to a perfunctory script that doesn\u2019t go anywhere or do anything we haven\u2019t seen many times before. It\u2019s less of a film and more of an actors\u2019 workshop, an exercise for everyone involved but meaningless to us.\n\nLily (Susan Sarandon) is dying and by the end of this weekend, she\u2019ll be dead. The pain of losing herself to illness is too much to bear so she decides, with help from her husband, Paul (Sam Neill), that she\u2019ll expedite the process and invites her family to the house so they can spend her final days together. But there\u2019s tension between her daughters, the uptight Jennifer (Kate Winslet) and the wayward Anna (Mia Wasikowska), and it threatens to destroy Lily\u2019s perfectly laid out plan.\n\nThere are so many familiar ingredients at play here that in order to rise above mediocrity, some remarkable insight or at least sparkling dialogue would be required to justify the film\u2019s existence. We\u2019ve seen a similar version of every element here before: the give-no-fucks terminally ill matriarch who quips rather than mopes, the repressed married sister who clashes with her freewheeling younger gay sibling, the reserved teen who finally comes out of his shell, the lesbian girlfriend whose interests include football and beer and the loyal husband who suffers in silence. It\u2019s boringly reheated and writer Christian Torpe, who also wrote the Danish film this is based on, doesn\u2019t have much in his arsenal other than a few lame attempts at gallows humour and so relies heavily on the actors to do the heavy lifting.\n\nBut Winslet is miscast, Sarandon is coasting, Neill is sleepwalking and Wasikowska, an extremely talented yet recently underused actor, is stuck playing the sort of role she should have grown out of by now. Also, are we really still associating rebellion with being gay and having a buttoned up lifestyle with being straight? A far more interesting dynamic would have switched the sisters\u2019 sexuality but that would have required thinking outside of a very small box. The most interesting actor on screen is a soulful Lindsey Duncan as Lily\u2019s old friend and a more interesting film would have focused on that pairing above the undercooked family drama that unfolds. It\u2019s never really possible to buy into the characters as a family given how thinly etched their relationships are to one another and so when the inevitable fireworks arrive, it\u2019s more like someone waving a sparkler in your face.\n\nBlackbird is a politely made film in search of meaning it\u2019s never able to find, an empty, if thankfully short, piece of festival fodder, its death arriving mercifully soon.", "description": "A terminally ill matriarch gathers her family together before she ends her life in a starry, but flat, drama that lacks insight and compelling conflict", "authors": ["Benjamin Lee"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/acfe6c457a6e1f35288fead5f5b0e170e629ed7b/10_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTIucG5n&enable=upscale&s=198b09ec51616e32ad2200bf4357d548", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
