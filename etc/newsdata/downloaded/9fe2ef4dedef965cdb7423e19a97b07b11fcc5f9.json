Love me!\u2019\n\nBut you don\u2019t because you\u2019re actually a very nice and sensible person, which is precisely why both these people should like you the most.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t feel very nice to imagine that these mates of yours are secretly whispering about how much they prefer one another to you but it\u2019s going to be alright, I promise. Let\u2019s talk this through.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRemember, friendships are not monogamous\n\nTruly, don\u2019t get too carried away fantasising that these pals of yours sit around gossiping about you, or scheming about how they\u2019ll get you out of their lives so they can be together forever. For a start, that\u2019s just not how friendship works and you know it.\n\nThe lovely thing about friendship is that we actually have the capacity to make many friends, not just the one. Our hearts have room for more than one friend thankfully.\n\nThese are not romantic partners we\u2019re talking about, so there\u2019s been no promise of monogamy or exclusivity exchanged between you. There is no betrayal here \u2013 they\u2019ve done nothing wrong by you.\n\nPresumably you have more than two friends? Great, go and see them.\n\nSweet thing, it is extremely unlikely they even bother talking about you. Maybe you come up sometimes in a casual \u2018isn\u2019t she great\u2019 kind of way but otherwise I promise they\u2019re talking about other things: their lives, their loves, their careers, their brunch-related decisions.\n\nThe point is that they get on well, they have chemistry, they like each other and there is actually no reason for either of these friends to cancel their subscription to your friendship just because they get on.\n\nSo long as you\u2019re still being the kind, interesting person they decided to like in the first place, you have no reason to fret. There\u2019s room for you all in one another\u2019s lives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou are not going to get bumped out of your position as buddy. Just make sure you continue to invest in these friendships in your usual lovely way, so they know that they matter to you.\n\nIf you think you might have done something truly terrible \u2013 bad enough to warrant these people working together to cut you out of their lives \u2013 then I suggest you think about what you did and make amends.\n\nIt\u2019s OK to feel left out\n\nAlright, so all of that said, you still feel left out. Let\u2019s deal with that.\n\nIt\u2019s a little bit infantile, but still, I get it. Adult people are absolutely capable of feeling excluded, especially when their mates hang out together without them.\n\nThe best tactics here are really going to be transparency, love and distraction. So, if you\u2019ve got the courage to be vulnerable, you could start by saying to one or both of your mates that you\u2019re feeling a bit excluded.\n\nIt\u2019s not shameful to admit that, it\u2019s perfectly fine. A little text expressing that you\u2019d love to hang out with them, either individually or together, is a nice way to go.\n\nYou could add that you know it sounds silly but you\u2019re feeling a bit weird and you\u2019d appreciate a little extra TLC. You can be proactive about organising things for you all to do.\n\nDid someone say Greek island getaway? (Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)\n\nYou can also make the conscious decision to come at this with love, instead of jealousy or envy or insecurity. Choose to ignore those petty, unpleasant feelings and embrace being kind and generous and sweet with your friends.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEvery time you feel the instinct to be narky or mean (to yourself or others), mentally catch yourself and redirect your energies into feeling grateful to have these people in your life.\n\nIf none of that works then it\u2019s time for a little distraction. Now might be a nice time to reconnect with someone you haven\u2019t seen in ages, message a potential new friend or hang out with other people.\n\nActively remind yourself who else you have in your life by hanging out with people you like \u2013 people other than the two friends who are now seeing each other all the time.\n\nPresumably you have more than two friends? Great, go and see them. If not, make some new ones. I also recommend gentle soothing activities like Netflix and Deliveroo, napping, reading, bubble baths and cookies. When in doubt, do something nice for yourself.\n\nThree is the magic number\n\nHave you thought about how this might, in fact, be a delightful development? Previously, you would have kept them separate but now you can all spend time together and there are three of you, which means you\u2019re halfway to being the main cast of Friends.\n\nNow that two of your favourite people actually like one another, it means you can do things as a group, which has that rather pleasant effect of making you feel loved and welcome and like you belong in the company of other human beings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMake the most of it \u2013 do something nice together, hang out all three of you (did someone say Greek island getaway?).\n\nYou can have brunches and dinners and walks and wines and movie nights \u2013 and! You can finally play card games that require more than two players. Frankly, I fail to see the problem here.\n\nMORE: So you want to get a friendship tattoo?
