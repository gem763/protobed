Wedged between Spain and France, the independent principality, one of the world\u2019s smallest countries, has largely been spared the mass social movements that have rocked its neighbors.\n\nThe country\u2019s women\u2019s rights campaigners want to change that \u2014 they\u2019re pushing to overturn Andorra's strict abortion law, which forces women seeking to terminate their pregnancies to seek treatment outside the country.\n\nIn Andorra, which is not a member of the European Union, the \u201cright to life\u201d is enshrined in the constitution. Abortions are illegal in all circumstances, even when the woman\u2019s life is at risk.\n\nWomen who receive an abortion within the country\u2019s borders can face up to six months of house arrest; doctors who perform the procedure can be sentenced to up to three years in prison and barred from practicing medicine for up to five years.\n\nThe silence surrounding abortion in Andorra creates uncertainty over what, exactly, is legal.\n\nPotential legal repercussions can easily be avoided \u2014 it\u2019s only a short distance to France or Spain, where the treatment is legal \u2014 but the stigma attached to the procedure is high. In some cases, women lose their jobs if their decision is made public.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fear,\u201d said Vanessa Mendoza Cort\u00e9s, whose feminist activist group Stop Viol\u00e8ncies is spearheading efforts not only to legalize abortion, but to shift the conversation around women\u2019s reproductive rights.\n\nBreaking the long-held taboo is no easy feat in a country that is ruled \u2014 literally, Mendoza pointed out \u2014 by the Catholic Church, and is unaccustomed to grassroots organizing.\n\nSpeaking to a group of activists on a recent Saturday, Mendoza pulled up a PowerPoint slide, eliciting laughs and cheers from the audience. Above the faces of nine of Andorra\u2019s most powerful men \u2014 including members of the church and of parliament \u2014 Mendoza had written in bolded letters, Camps de nabs \u2014 \u201csausage fest.\u201d\n\nMendoza pointed to a picture of Bishop Joan Enric Vives Sic\u00edlia, who together with the president of France, currently Emmanuel Macron, is one of the country\u2019s two \u201cco-princes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the man who said we were the venom poisoning the tree of the institution,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIf we don't have a little bit of humor here, we can't survive.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\nFor women living in Andorra, the process of arranging an abortion is often traumatic \u2014 and expensive.\n\nSome doctors require women to listen to their fetus\u2019 heartbeat, or look at ultrasound images before they agree to provide them with information on seeking an abortion abroad. Most women travel to France or Spain for the procedure, which will often cost them hundreds, in some cases thousands, in travel expenses and extra fees.\n\nLast year, some 124 Andorran women got abortions in Catalonia\u2019s private and public health centers, according Catalonia\u2019s ministry of health. Data is not available for France, and Andorra does not collect statistics about women who leave the country to end their pregnancies.\n\nThe women make their journeys discreetly. \u201cIn Andorra, these things aren't usually talked about,\u201d said Tatiana Navarro, an Andorran journalist.\n\nJoana Ferreira, a 16-year-old activist, said her friend described the experience of seeking an abortion abroad as \u201ccold.\u201d \u201cShe didn't have help from anyone,\u201d Ferreira said. \u201cShe had to go the clinic alone.\u201d\n\nThe silence surrounding abortion in Andorra creates uncertainty over what, exactly, is legal.\n\nEric Sylvestre, an Andorran doctor who supports legalizing abortion, said it\u2019s unclear whether doctors can be punished for giving advice on abortion or recommending a woman visit a particular clinic abroad.\n\nAccording to Eric Jover, a spokesperson for the Andorran government, giving advice is fine \u2014 but actively promoting and advocating abortion is not.\n\nOpponents of the push to legalize abortion say their resistance is not motivated only by tradition and religion \u2014 the effort could threaten the stability of the country itself.\n\nLast year in Andorra, 60 people marched on International Safe Abortion day; this year, a march in support of women's rights drew some 500 people.\n\nWhile Andorra\u2019s parliament makes laws, they must be signed off by one of its two co-princes before they can go into effect.\n\nThe French president has been reticent to make a statement on whether Andorra should legalize abortion, even if he has \"always defended the right of women to their own bodies,\" as he said on a visit to Andorra last month.\n\nThe bishop, meanwhile, has made it clear he will not green-light any new abortion law passed by the government \u2014 and would resign if Macron were to approve it in his stead.\n\nWhat would happen next is hard to predict, but abortion opponents say the standoff would tip the country into a constitutional crisis.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have legalization about abortion thinking that it wouldn\u2019t have secondary effects on our constitutional model,\u201d said Jover, the government spokesperson.\n\n\u201cIf the Andorran people decided that the elements associated with the abortion law are more important than our institutional elements \u2026 it could be done, but we would have to change our institutional model.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\nThe fledgling women\u2019s rights movement doesn\u2019t yet boast big numbers. Last year, 60 people marched on International Safe Abortion day; this year, a march in support of women's rights drew some 500 people.\n\nBut in the micro-state of only 77,000 people, their efforts have been loud enough to put the issue on the national agenda.\n\nIn a general election earlier this year, every major party took a public position on abortion. The governing party, Dem\u00f2crates per Andorra, for example, has pledged to create a support system for women who leave the country to receive abortions \u2014 a proposal activists and liberal lawmakers have slammed as hypocritical.\n\n\u201cThe government says, \u2018This is a crime, but don\u2019t worry about it we\u2019ll help you do it another place,\u2019\u201d said Rosa Gili, a member of the Social Democratic party in the Andorran parliament.\n\nMany credit the massive turnout at last year's International Women's Day marches in Spain for inspiring Andorran women to stage their own protests.\n\nStill, things are moving. Last year, the country\u2019s health ministry made emergency contraception available without a prescription \u2014 a move activists considered a major victory.\n\nMany credit the massive turnout at last year's International Women's Day marches in Spain for inspiring Andorran women to stage their own protests. In March this year, hundreds of Spanish women traveled Andorra to lend their support to their demonstration.\n\nFor Mendoza, the heated debate is also personal.\n\nShe\u2019s been called a \u201cfeminazi\u201d and received death threats. Once, a commentator wrote to her, \u201cYou\u2019ll know what it means to abort when they rape you.\"\n\nBut Mendoza maintains it\u2019s a fight worth fighting. After the meeting she held with activists, the group joined some 200 people at a nearby park, where they waited to begin a two-hour march into the capital, Andorra la Vella.\n\nA few dozen had come by bus from Barcelona to offer support. \"From the outside, you can't see what's happening in Andorra,\u201d said Remedios Merchan, an activist from Matar\u00f3.\n\nMake noise, be seen, don\u2019t get hit by cars, Mendoza instructed the activists through her megaphone. The women headed down the highway in a sea of purple \u2014 the color of the abortion rights movement \u2014 shouting \u201cIf the pope were a woman, abortion would be legal\u201d and \u201cjoin the cause!\u201d\n\nAs night fell on the outskirts of Andorra la Vella, the protesters stopped by a Catholic Church where worshippers were attending Saturday evening mass.\n\nThey leaned a white cross reading \u201cGet out of our ovaries\u201d against a stone pillar and tossed clothes hangers \u2014 each bearing the name of a woman who died from a clandestine abortion, not just in Andorra but around the world \u2014 on the ground.\n\n\u201cThe best thing,\u201d said Vicky Moreno, from Vilanova i la Geltr\u00fa, \u201cwould be for the church to go off into the mountain.\u201d\n\nMeg Bernhard is a freelance journalist based in Brussels and Barcelona.", "description": "Push to legalize abortion could tip country into constitutional crisis, opponents say.", "authors": ["Meg Bernhard", "Ashleigh Furlong", "Jillian Deutsch"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1157018519-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
