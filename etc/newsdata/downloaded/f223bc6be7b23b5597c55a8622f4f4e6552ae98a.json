The Monegasque will be chasing his second successive victory on Sunday after winning for the first time in Belgium last weekend.\n\n\"I'm happy with the pole but it's a shame at the end there was a big mess and I hoped our last lap was enough,\" said the youngster.\n\n\"I think the pace was quite good actually during the race simulations,\" he said of Ferrari's hopes of ending a win drought at Monza dating back to 2010, when Spaniard Fernando Alonso was triumphant.\n\n\"It's looking positive, better than in Spa.\"\n\nRenault's Nico Hulkenberg, who qualified a provisional sixth and behind Australian team mate Daniel Ricciardo in fifth, took some of the heat afterwards for running off track after being first out of the pits.\n\nHe told reporters he had not done it deliberately and made a mistake after concentrating too much on what was in his car's mirrors.\n\n\"We're all looking for a tow,\" he said. \"When you drive on your own you lose on the straights and you can't make up that time. Hence, we ended up with this situation. Of course it was a bit weird and strange.\n\n\"That's what happens when everyone starts slowing down and nobody wants to be first in the train.\"\n\nRed Bull's British-born Thai driver Alex Albon qualified eighth, and blamed Hulkenberg for what had happened, while Canadian Lance Stroll will line up ninth for Racing Point.\n\nStroll has always gone well at Monza and qualified on the front row with Williams in 2017.\n\nRed Bull's Max Verstappen, winner of two races this season, will start at the back of the grid due to engine penalties, along with Toro Rosso's Pierre Gasly and McLaren's teenage rookie Lando Norris.", "description": "Lewis Hamilton will start the Italian Grand Prix on the front row but it is Ferrari\u2019s Charles Leclerc who begins on pole after a farcical qualifying session.
