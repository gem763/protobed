Waymo, the self-driving division of Google parent Alphabet, announced Monday that it would begin testing its autonomous vehicles in the second most populous city in the US. But whether the company will share real-time location data with the city under its new tracking program remains unclear.\n\nTo start out, Waymo will be bringing three vehicles (all Chrysler Pacifica minivans) to map LA, specifically downtown and the Miracle Mile. The cars will be driven manually by human safety drivers. Once Waymo has a detailed 3D map of the area, the company will begin to operate its vehicles in autonomous mode, though Waymo has no plans to launch a passenger service in the city.\n\nWaymo made the announcement in a tweet, in which it said it would explore \u201chow Waymo\u2019s tech might fit into LA\u2019s dynamic transportation environment and complement the City\u2019s innovative approach to transportation.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an interesting choice of words, considering the controversy surrounding LA\u2019s Department of Transportation\n\nIt\u2019s an interesting choice of words, considering the controversy surrounding LA\u2019s Department of Transportation\u2019s use of a digital tool called Mobility Data Specification (MDS) to track, in real time, electric scooters and other shared mobility devices that operate on its streets. E-scooter companies are required to share data with the city as a precondition for receiving a permit to operate scooters in LA. It\u2019s like an air traffic control system for ground vehicles.\n\nCritics of the department\u2019s MDS program have raised concerns that the location data could be used by law enforcement to track specific individuals. But supporters argue it can be expanded to incorporate more than just e-scooters. Autonomous vehicles, for instance, could fall within the purview of MDS.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to build something that was future proof,\u201d Seleta Reynolds, general manager at LADOT, said in a recent interview with The Verge. \u201cWe\u2019re not necessarily clear on what that next opportunity is going to be in. But we want to be ready for it because we know it\u2019s coming.\u201d\n\nUnder California law, companies need to obtain a permit from the state Department of Motor Vehicles in order to test self-driving vehicles on public roads. After that, all they need to do to start testing in a city is inform the appropriate local authorities. Cities then would have to negotiate specific agreements, such as data sharing, on a case-by-case basis.\n\nA spokesperson for Waymo wouldn\u2019t respond to questions about whether the company has agreed to share data with LADOT.", "description": "Los Angeles is about to get its first self-driving cars.
