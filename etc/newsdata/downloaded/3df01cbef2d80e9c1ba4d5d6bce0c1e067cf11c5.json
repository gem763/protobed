A nearby government office had also been vandalised.\n\nPolice said tear gas was fired in two districts while flashmobs and brief clashes were witnessed in at least four other locations.\n\nIn online forums used to organise the largely leaderless movement, protesters had given Sunday's rally the theme \"blossom everywhere\" encouraging activists to gather in malls across the city.\n\nWhile the crowds were smaller, the cat and mouse tactics stretched police resources thin and were still able to bring chaos to parts of the city in what was a 19th consecutive weekend of protest.\n\nThroughout the day, police found themselves berated and heckled by bystanders as they made arrests, highlighting how the force has become loathed among large parts of the population.\n\n\"I'm furious,\" a female protester, who gave her surname Chan, told AFP. \"I want the government to disband the entire police force.\"\n\nMonths of protest\n\nHong Kong has been shaken by four months of massive democracy protests which have seen increasingly violent clashes between hardcore demonstrators and police, as well as regular transport disruptions.\n\nThe wave of protests in the international finance hub was sparked by opposition to a now-scrapped proposal to allow extraditions to mainland China, but has since morphed into a larger movement for democracy and police accountability.\n\nThe city enjoys unique rights under the terms of its handover to China by Britain in 1997, including freedom of expression and an independent judiciary, but many believe these are under threat from an increasingly assertive Beijing.\n\nStreet battles between riot police and small groups of protesters have become a weekly occurrence, hammering the already struggling economy, spooking tourists and undermining Hong Kong's reputation for stability.\n\nThe beginning of October saw a particularly fierce period of unrest with protesters upping their violence as Communist China celebrated its 70th birthday party.\n\nClashes further intensified after the city's leader invoked colonial-era emergency laws to ban face masks at protests.\n\nOver the course of a week, protesters went on a vandalism spree, much of it targeting the city's subway network and pro-China businesses.\n\nPolice also increased their response, firing tear gas and rubber bullets with renewed ferocity. Two teenagers were wounded with live rounds during clashes with police.\n\nBut the last few days have seen a comparatively calmer period.\n\nProtesters are pushing for an independent inquiry into the police, an amnesty for the more than 2,500 people arrested and universal suffrage.\n\nBeijing and city leader Carrie Lam have repeatedly rejected those demands.", "description": "Hong Kong riot police spent much of Sunday afternoon skirmishing with groups of masked pro-democracy protesters who held flashmob gatherings in multiple locations -- although crowds were smaller and less violent than recent weekends.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9423/e3e4f457174f4c9a8484ea9907f8bea7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
