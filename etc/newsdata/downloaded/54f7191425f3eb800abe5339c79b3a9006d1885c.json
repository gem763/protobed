Many of the character-based emoji now also include a gender-neutral option alongside a male or female version.\n\nIcons showing hearing aids, wheelchairs, prosthetic limbs and guide dogs are also among the latest set of emoji from the Unicode Consortium, the body which maintains and regulates the library of characters.\n\nWebsite Emojipedia, which is part of the Unicode Consortium and details icons found in updates, posted images online of the new gender-neutral emoji choices.\n\nYou can change the ethnicity of emoji as well (Emojipedia)\n\nMORE: Google releases 53 gender-neutral emojis to challenge \u2018man-centered culture\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast year, Apple said it wanted to improve the representation of those with disabilities, submitting a number of designs to Unicode after consulting a number of campaigns and charities on the issue.\n\nIn response to the introduction of the icons, Plan International UK\u2019s chief executive Rose Caldwell said: \u2018We are thrilled to see the arrival of this long-awaited blood drop emoji, which signals a real breakthrough in the fight against period stigma. Girls, women and other menstruators told us this emoji would help them talk more freely about their periods, which is why we campaigned so hard to make it a reality.\n\n\u2018But this is only one part of the solution.\n\n\u2018We know that girls around the world are being held back because of their periods, whether that\u2019s the one in five girls here in the UK who are bullied and teased, girls in Zimbabwe who have dropped out of school because the recent cyclone destroyed their period-friendly toilets, or those living in refugee camps in Bangladesh who can\u2019t access period products since fleeing their homes.\n\n\u2018Period poverty will not stop until we fix the toxic trio of affordability of products, lack of education and period shame. We hope this emoji helps to keep the conversation going.\u2019\n\nMenstruation is represented by a drop of blood (Emojipedia)\n\niPhone and iPad users can access the new emoji by opening their Settings app, selecting General and then Software Update before confirming the installation of iOS 13.2.", "description": "Menstruation now also has its own emoji", "authors": ["Jeff Parsons"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_93893910_1572426874.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
