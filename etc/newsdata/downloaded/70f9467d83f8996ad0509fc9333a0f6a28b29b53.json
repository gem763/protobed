The Sunday World reported that you had not revealed the names of the journalists.\n\n[On Tuesday], a new version of the story was published where you deny the bribery allegations.\n\nWe eagerly await for the truth to emerge and Sanef believes that it is imperative that you verify \u2013 under oath - which version of events is in fact correct and why you have made two contradictory statements.\n\nAllegations of bribing journalists are a blight on the media industry and cause irreparable damage to our fight for media freedom.\n\nIt is therefore important that this issue is swiftly and decisively dealt with.\n\nMinister - given the seriousness of the matter, Sanef will be writing a letter to President Cyril Ramaphosa to express our deep concern about the claims against you.\n\nREAD | Gwede Mantashe denies paying reporters to make sex story 'go away'\n\nFurthermore, Sanef will be writing a letter to retired Judge Kathleen Satchwell, who is chairing our independent Inquiry into Media Ethics and Credibility, asking her to investigate this further. We will also be asking Judge Satchwell to look into the prevalence of \"brown envelope\" journalism across the industry.\n\nWe believe that \"paid for\" or what is known as \"brown envelope\" journalism is gutter journalism and goes against the ethics we hold dear. This dastardly practice fundamentally undermines our constitutional principles of freedom of expression, access to information and freedom of the media.\n\nSanef supports Sunday World editor, Makhudu Sefara, who has promised to launch an investigation and to fire any journalist linked to bribery if any evidence is found.\n\nAllow us to remind you, Minister, of Section 2 of the Press Council Code that deals with \"Independence and Conflicts of Interest\". The Code states clearly that:\n\nThe media shall:\n\n2.1 not allow commercial, political, personal or other non-professional considerations to influence reporting, and avoid conflicts of interest as well as practices that could lead readers to doubt the media's independence and professionalism;\n\n2.2 not accept any benefit which may influence coverage;\n\n2.3 indicate clearly when an outside organisation has contributed to the cost of news gathering; and\n\n2.4 keep editorial material clearly distinct from advertising and sponsored events.\n\nPlease do get back to us within the next seven days.\n\nYours sincerely,", "description": "In this open letter to Mineral Resources and Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe, the South African Editors' Forum asks why the minister has made two contradictory statements.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9419/4deeb58489124c37ada8a8b40afc6bff.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
