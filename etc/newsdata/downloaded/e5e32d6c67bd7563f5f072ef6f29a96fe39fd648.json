That will limit the disturbance\u2019s time over warm gulf waters, capping to what extent it can develop. It\u2019s sort of like your speed on the highway is limited by how long you can keep the gas pedal down.\n\nNotice in the following model depiction the strip of calm winds (stronger winds are marked in shades of varying colors) at the upper levels Thursday and Friday, which will potentially offer the disturbance a brief window to organize before it is drawn inland.\n\n\n\nA narrow channel of reduced shear ahead of the trough may allow the system to intensify some as it slips northward. Systems only develop when ambient wind speed/direction doesn't change too much with height, meaning that the \"shear\" is low.\n\nSo what\u2019s most likely? This will be a rainmaker for parts of the Gulf Coast. It\u2019s not a system that is predicted to become a major wind producer because of its short window to strengthen. While there\u2019s an outside chance the system organizes enough to get named, it would probably remain a low-end tropical cyclone if that were to occur. The main impacts are likely to stem from heavy rainfall.\n\nNotice a stream of moisture-rich air accompany this wave as it treks northeast into the weekend. Places like coastal Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and the Florida Panhandle are all regions that could see an influx of moisture \u2014 and heavy rainfall potential \u2014 if and when this system draws near.\n\n\n\nNotice the river of moist air streaming northeastward with the system.\n\nThis early, it\u2019s impossible to estimate specific rainfall totals or even where the heaviest rain will fall (if the system develops as we\u2019re currently anticipating). However, an early glance at some model indicators suggests that a few spots may see 2.5 to 3 inches or more, depending on the evolution of this tropical disturbance.\n\n\n\nOffshore rain totals modeled by the GFS can provide an early indicator of some of the rainfall that may occur if (and when) this system approaches land.\n\nThe influx of moisture could also contribute to heavy downpours ahead of a cold front set to swing through the lower Mississippi Valley, the Appalachians and the Southeast early next week, possibly streaming as far north as the Mid-Atlantic.\n\n\n\nAn added blob of moisture may enhance downpours along a cold front that will enter the East and Southeast early next week.\n\nMeanwhile, a tropical depression has formed off the Africa coast. While it originally appeared poised to intensify into a tropical storm, this has become less likely. It is predicted to drift aimlessly out to sea and dissipate over the coming days. In the meantime, 1 to 3 inches of rainfall are possible over the eastern and northern Cabo Verde islands.\n\n\n\nA tropical depression looks to remain largely out to sea, though it will first affect portions of the eastern Cabo Verde islands with several inches of rain.\n\nShould either this tropical depression or the Yucat\u00e1n disturbance earn a name, or both, the next two names on the tropical cyclone list are Nestor and Olga.", "description": "The system may develop over the southern gulf, then spread rain to the Gulf Coast this weekend and eventually farther north.", "authors": ["Matthew Cappucci", "Meteorologist", "Capital Weather Gang", "October At Pm", "Matthew Cappucci Is A Meteorologist For Capital Weather Gang.
