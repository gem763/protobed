Season 6 Episode 4 Editor\u2019s Rating 3 stars * * * * * \u00ab Previous Next Photo: Netflix\n\nIt was bad when Mr. Peanutbutter cheated on Pickles with Diane. It was worse when, rather than telling Pickles about it, he decided to propose marriage instead. The truth was always going to come out eventually \u2014 and just as inevitably, it was going to come out at the worst possible time.\n\nSo sure, why not at the surprise wedding Todd has organized without the knowledge of Mr. Peanutbutter and Pickles. (Just go with it.) Unfortunately, just as a house full of friends and family are about to jump out and surprise the couple, Mr. Peanutbutter decides to tell Pickles that he cheated on her. The rest of the episode veers between relationship drama and silly farce. As Pickles decides whether she should dump Mr. Peanutbutter, the guests try to avoid an awkward situation by hiding whenever the arguing couple gets close to them.\n\n\u201cSurprise!\u201d is a pretty fun episode, but the stakes are awfully low. The montage that opens the episode, which owes a lot to Eighth Grade, shows Pickles growing up as a wannabe YouTube influencer doing insipid but well-intentioned makeup tutorials. But you can only drum up so much empathy for a character as vapid and cartoonish as Pickles, who happily broadcasts pretty much everything about her life, and relies on her livestream superfans to make every decision for her. Mr. Peanutbutter\u2019s decision to cheat is undeniably a shitty thing to do, but I\u2019m not convinced that it wouldn\u2019t be the best thing for the character, or the show, if their relationship ended.\n\nAs Pickles sobs into her livestream, insisting that the wedding is off, Mr. Peanutbutter does his best to apologize. (\u201cIt was the worst mistake of my life, and I once played Twister with Bryan Singer at Kevin Spacey\u2019s party for Andy Dick\u2019s early parole!\u201d) They also manage to insult basically everybody in the room without realizing they\u2019re there. But after Pickles makes Mr. Peanutbutter jump through a few hoops, and Mr. Peanutbutter comes clean about exactly what happened with Diane, Pickles decides to forgive him.\n\nSo it looks like the Peanutbutter-Pickles wedding is back on, on two conditions: (1) Mr. Peanutbutter never lies again, and (2) Pickles gets to hook up with somebody else so she can even the score. (When the episode ends, she\u2019s waffling between her high-school boyfriend Buzzy and Tyler from SoulCycle.) As Shakespeare said, all\u2019s well that ends well.\n\nBut in the midst of all the drama centered on a relationship BoJack Horseman can\u2019t really expect us to care about, an actual drama is unfolding. Near the beginning of the episode, Diane tells BoJack she\u2019s moving to Chicago, and whenever they can grab a spare moment they hash out what that means. BoJack confirms that he\u2019s not the reason she\u2019s leaving town; Diane confirms that BoJack will be okay without her. For a relationship that has often been fraught with tension, it\u2019s a mature, openhearted exchange that leads to the happiest of all possible results: a reaffirmation that they truly want what\u2019s best for each other.\n\nBut I have to admit: I still want more. No show does zany antics better than BoJack Horseman, and after three consecutive episodes that leaned heavily on the show\u2019s darker side, we were due for a goofier installment. But at this late stage of the series, I feel like BoJack and Diane\u2019s relationship has amassed a richness and complexity that deserves the center stage \u2014 something like Mad Men\u2019s \u201cThe Suitcase,\u201d which spent a full hour dissecting the complexity of the relationship between Don and Peggy after four seasons of buildup.\n\nBut even if Diane is off to Chicago now, I suspect there will be time for that further down the line. We\u2019re only halfway through this half-season of BoJack Horseman, and this show rarely lets its characters get comfortable for long before the rug gets pulled out from under them.\n\nHorsin\u2019 Around\n\n\u2022 The surprise party is loaded with visual cameos from BoJack Horseman characters we haven\u2019t seen in a while, including theater owner Virgil Van Cleef (a moose), Herb Kazzaz\u2019s unnamed blind executor (a bat), and J.D. Salinger (an extremely non-reclusive human author and game-show creator).\n\n\u2022 For the first time since season three, \u201cWeird Al\u201d Yankovic returns as Mr. Peanutbutter\u2019s unexpectedly morbid brother, who keeps cornering BoJack and steering their conversations down grim, existential detours.\n\n\u2022 There\u2019s also Princess Carolyn\u2019s baby daughter, Ruthie, whose Baby\u2019s Day Out\u2013style antics culminate in the decision that Todd should be her new nanny.\n\n\u2022 An incomplete list of Pickles\u2019s favorite musical artists: Justin Timberwolf, Iguana Azalea, Bun Direction.\n\n\u2022 In the BoJack Horseman universe, everyone\u2019s first Myspace friend Tom appears to be some kind of rodent. Same pose, though!\n\n\u2022 Judging by her screen name, Pickles was probably born in 1993, which makes her about 20 years younger than Mr. Peanutbutter.\n\n\u2022 Todd, being Todd, distracted Mr. Peanutbutter and Pickles while he set up the party by buying them tickets to Angels in America, which he thought was Angels in the Outfield.\n\n\u2022 After everybody endured all the stress of hiding for an entire episode, I love that the sum total of Mr. Peanutbutter\u2019s reaction to his unexpected guests is, \u201cOdd.\u201d", "description": "The truth about Mr. Peanutbutter and Diane was always going to come out eventually \u2014 and just as inevitably, it was going to come out at the worst possible time.
