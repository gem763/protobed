REUTERS/Henry Nicholls\n\nMany EU diplomats fear the United Kingdom is heading towards a no-deal or another delay as they say the British proposals are not enough to get an agreement by Oct. 31. Johnson said further delay was \u201cpointless and expensive\u201d.\n\nHowever, parliament has passed a law stating that Britain must request a delay if it does not have a deal by mid-October and Johnson has not revealed how he plans to get around that.\n\nBrexit has deeply divided the United Kingdom and left British politics in turmoil for more than three years. In the June 23, 2016 referendum, 17.4 million voters, or 52 percent, voted for Brexit while 16.1 million, or 48 percent, backed staying in the bloc.\n\nA senior British government official said: \u201cThe government is either going to be negotiating a new deal or working on no deal - nobody will work on delay.\u201d\n\nGiving little detail on his proposals, Johnson said there would be no checks at or near the Irish border. He said London would respect the 1998 peace agreement that ended three decades of conflict in the province. He did not explain how.\n\n\u201cBy a process of renewable democratic consent by the executive and assembly of Northern Ireland,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWe will go further and protect the existing regulatory arrangements for farmers and other businesses on both sides of the border.\u201d\n\nHe said the United Kingdom \u201cwhole and entire\u201d would withdraw from the EU, with London keeping control of its own trade policy from the start. He said technology could offer a solution but gave no specifics.\n\nWith the EU already pouring cold water on some of the reports of his proposal, the likelihood of a no deal appears to be rising - something Johnson\u2019s opponents say they believe is the prime minister\u2019s overiding goal.\n\nSlideshow (6 Images)\n\nJohn McDonnell, finance policy chief for the opposition Labour Party, described Johnson\u2019s proposals as \u201ca cynical attempt to force through a no-deal Brexit\u201d.\n\nJohnson has repeatedly said he wants a deal, and his aides suggested he simply wanted the EU to engage with the proposal to try to open further talks on a possible agreement.\n\n\u201cWe will keep fighting to respect the biggest democratic vote in British history,\u201d the senior UK government official said. \u201cThe EU is obliged by EU law only to negotiate with member state governments, they cannot negotiate with parliament, and this government will not negotiate delay.\u201d", "description": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged the European Union on Wednesday to compromise after Britain came up with its final offer to try to secure a Brexit deal, promising he would not be deterred from leaving on Oct. 31.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Piper", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436225867&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF910X2"}
