He said the Islamic State leader, who was hiding in a tunnel tried to flee, \"was screaming, crying and whimpering\" in his last moments.\n\n\"He died like a dog. He died like a coward,\" added Trump. Baghdadi's remains were positively identified in 15 minutes, according to Trump.\n\n\"They have his DNA and they brought it with them with lab technicians who who were with them\" to perform \"an on-site test\" after getting to Baghdadi's body following clearing some debris in the \"dead-end\" tunnel, explained Trump when asked about the identification by reporters.\n\n\"We've already got them in our sights,\" replied Trump when asked about successors to the IS leader. \"I wanted to make sure this was kept secret,\" said Trump when asked if he had notified Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi about the raid.\n\n", "description": "IS Leader Dead, Trump Announces", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/10/28/2019102800405_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
