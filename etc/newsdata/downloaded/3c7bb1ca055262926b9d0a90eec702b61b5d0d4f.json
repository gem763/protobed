This then-nascent technical achievement gave rise to a still-ongoing debate over the survivability of the U.S.\u2019s nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, as the DF-21D outranged the strike planes serving on carrier decks. This further compelled the U.S. Navy to introduce anti-ballistic missile capability to its destroyers and cruisers in the form of the SM-3 missile.\n\nBallistic missiles travel in an arcing trajectory to maximize range and velocity, sometimes even exiting the Earth\u2019s atmosphere before plunging down towards their targets at unthinkably fast speeds\u2014in the DF-21\u2019s case, up to ten times the speed of sound. However, until a decade ago there were no operational anti-ship ballistic missiles (though one was developed by the Soviet Union, but did not enter service) because it\u2019s a lot easier to program a ballistic missile to hit a city or military base, than to have one strike a small, moving target\u2014ie, a ship.\n\nHowever, just two years later Iran announced it too had already developed an anti-ship ballistic missile. Tehran is infamous for habitually exaggerating or fabricating claims about its military technology\u2014but in 2013 footage of an apparently successful missile test was released, and by 2014 U.S. intelligence briefings confirmed the missile\u2019s deployment.\n\nThe missile, which has the rather on-the-nose name Khalij Fars (\u201cPersian Gulf\u201d), is derivative of Iran\u2019s domestically developed Fateh-110 short-ranged ballistic missile. The truck-born Fateh-110 series can be fired on short notice because it uses solid fuel; by contrast, liquid-fuel rockets require days to gas up.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "Could they sink a carrier?", "authors": ["Sebastien Roblin"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/LMuKB2Ff3wFZdTQcdgENyQ--~B/aD0xMDMwO3c9MTQ0MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/5183bde904b010a913c7f20531dfdf12", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
