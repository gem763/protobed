He said it was needed because an election held in February, in which President Muhammadu Buhari won a second term, was not credible.\n\nBuhari, a former military ruler, faces criticism for his administration\u2019s record on human rights, particularly a deadly crackdown on members of a now-banned Shi\u2019ite group that a United Nations special rapporteur said involved the excessive use of lethal force.\n\nIn his call for a revolution, Sowore - who ran in February\u2019s election and is the founder of the news site Sahara Reporters - listed other issues ranging from alleged corruption to ineptitude.\n\nThe government last week outlined charges against him including treason, money laundering and \u201ccyberstalking\u201d for allegedly sharing false information about Buhari that insulted him and incited hated against him.\n\nSowore has yet to be arraigned, and the judge on Tuesday rejected a request by the State Security Service to extend his detention while the charges are pending.\n\n\u201cThe liberty of all Nigerians, high or low, poor or rich, is guaranteed by the constitution. It\u2019s for this end that I\u2019m of the view that the defendant ought to be released forthwith,\u201d Justice Taiwo Taiwo said.\n\nIn the charges filed last week, the government accused Sowore of money laundering related to four transfers to a Sahara Reporters account in New York that it alleged were done to hide the \u201cillicit origin\u201d of the cash.\n\nIt was unclear when Sowore would be released, and once he is arraigned, he could be taken into custody again. The court ordered him to surrender all his travel documents within 48 hours, and said his lawyer should be prepared to bring him to the court at any point.", "description": "A court in Nigeria's capital Abuja on Tuesday ordered the State Security Service to release activist and former presidential candidate Omoyele Sowore while charges of treason against him are pending.", "authors": ["Camillus Eboh", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
