Last month, a speeding bus fell off a mountainous road into a river in the northwest, killing 24 passengers.\n\nRescue efforts were hampered Sunday by the remote terrain near the town of Chilas on the route between the cities of Rawalpindi and Skardu. That's in the Gilgit-Baltistan area, part of the larger Kashmir region.\n\nKashmir is divided between India and Pakistan, and has been the sight of recent tensions. An army statement said ten soldiers were among those killed in the crash.\n\nWakil said two of the injured had died after being taken to the hospital, and that all the dead and injured had been evacuated to hospitals from the crash site.", "description": "A bus crash in northern Pakistan killed 26 people Sunday after its brakes failed on a winding mountain road, police said.
