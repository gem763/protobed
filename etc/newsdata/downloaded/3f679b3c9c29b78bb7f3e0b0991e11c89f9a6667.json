It was Dec. 21, 2005 \u2014 the same day when civil partnerships became legal in England.\n\nELTON JOHN HIJACKED ROLLING STONES CONCERT HIGH ON COCAINE; KEITH RICHARDS WAS NOT HAPPY\n\n\u201cI was as happy as I could ever remember being,\u201d recalled the 72-year-old. \u201cAnd that was the moment my mother turned up, in character as a raving sociopath.\u201d\n\nThe British artist claimed he knew something was wrong when Farebrother and his stepfather arrived at his Old Windsor home. The couple refused to leave the car.\n\n\u201cDespite various entreaties to come into my house, they just sat there, stony-face,\u201d wrote the British artist. \u201cThere, Mum announced she wouldn\u2019t be joining the convoy of cars setting off for Windsor nor would she be coming to the private lunch afterward. Oh great. The most important day of my life and one of Mum\u2019s moods appeared to be upon us.\u201d\n\nJohn said he was all too familiar with his mother\u2019s severe mood swings, which impacted their relationship since his childhood. He dubbed her the \u201cCecil B. DeMille of bad moods, the Tolstoy of taking of huff.\u201d\n\nELTON JOHN WRITES QUEEN ELIZABETH SLAPPED HER NEPHEW ACROSS THE FACE IN FRONT OF HIM IN NEW BOOK\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t \u2014 couldn\u2019t spoil the day, of course,\u201d recalled John about his civil partnership ceremony. \u201cBut in fairness to Mum, she absolutely gave it her best shot.\u201d\n\nJohn said he remained on his best behavior and avoided confronting Farebrother. He was determined to prevent a public scandal on what should have been his special day.\n\nBut things only continued to deteriorate from there.\n\n\u201cWhen David and I exchanged our vows, she started talking very loudly, over the top of us, rattling on about how she didn\u2019t like the venue and couldn\u2019t imagine getting married in a place like this,\u201d John said. \u201cWhen the time came for the witnesses to sign the license, she signed her name, snapped: \u2018It\u2019s done, then,\u2019 slammed the pen down and storm off.\u201d\n\nELTON JOHN RESPONDS TO VLADIMIR PUTIN\u2019S LGBTQ COMMENTS FOLLOWING \u2018ROCKETMAN\u2019 CENSORSHIP\n\nAccording to John, Farebrother\u2019s mood didn\u2019t improve at the reception. Instead, she complained about her seating placement, declaring, \u201cYou might as well have stuck me in Siberia,\u201d as well as snapping back at anyone who approached her.\n\nSharon Osbourne, a guest at the reception, whispered to John in his ear, \u201cI know she\u2019s your mum, but I want to kill her.\u201d\n\nJohn also claimed that Farebrother had previously called Furnish\u2019s parents in an attempt to stop the ceremony, believing it would spoil her son\u2019s career. The revelation confused John, who always felt his mother had been supportive of his sexuality.\n\n\u201cShe has never been homophobic,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAs ever, I think the real problem was that she hated anyone being closer to me than she was\u2026 She couldn\u2019t cope with the tough of the umbilical cord finally being cut and she didn\u2019t care about anything else, including the fact that I was finally happy.\u201d\n\nELTON JOHN REVEALS HIS MOST 'DIFFICULT' SCENES TO WATCH IN 'ROCKETMAN' BIOPIC\n\nJohn\u2019s relationship with Farebrother didn\u2019t improve after the civil ceremony. After he and Furnish, now 56, welcomed their first son Zachary in 2012, John said that he \u201cstarted actively avoiding\u201d Farebrother and they \u201cweren\u2019t speaking at all.\u201d\n\nThe remains of their relationship reached a screeching halt when John fired his longtime assistant Bob Halley, who was close to Farebrother. John claimed his mother was \u201clivid\u201d when she heard the news and said Halley had always been more of a son to her than John.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s when she said: \u2018You care more about that f---ing thing you married than your own mother,\u2019\u201d wrote John. \u201cWe didn\u2019t speak for seven years after that phone call.\u201d\n\nDespite the spat, John said he continued to support his mother financially. However, mother and son remained estranged.\n\nELTON JOHN BIOPIC 'ROCKETMAN' BANNED IN SAMOA DUE TO HOMOSEXUALITY\n\n\u201cIt was sad, but I didn\u2019t want her in my life anymore,\u201d he explained. \u201cI didn\u2019t invite her to the ceremony when the law on gay partnerships changed again, and David and I got married in 2014.\u201d\n\nHe claimed Farebrother then started selling gifts he gave her, including platinum albums he had engraved just for her. She also celebrated her 90th birthday in 2015 with an Elton John tribute artist instead of her own son.\n\nIn 2017, John reconnected with Farebrother when he learned she was seriously ill. When he told her he loved her, he claimed Farebrother replied, \u201cI love you, too. But I don\u2019t like you at all.\u201d\n\nThat same year, Farebrother died of an undisclosed illness. John made the announcement on social media.\n\n\u201cSo sad to say that my mother passed away this morning,\u201d he tweeted at the time. \u201cI only saw her last Monday and I am in shock. Travel safe Mum. Thank you for everything. I will miss you so much. Love, Elton.\u201d\n\nIn his autobiography, John said that he finally broke down while giving her eulogy at the funeral service.\n\n\u201cI missed the person I was describing terribly, but I\u2019d started missing her decades before she died,\u201d he wrote.", "description": "Elton John held nothing back when it came to his mother Sheila Farebrother.", "authors": ["Stephanie Nolasco"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/rtx1bttr.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
