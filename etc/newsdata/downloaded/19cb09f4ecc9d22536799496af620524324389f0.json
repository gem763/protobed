Nine related to his employment at Peterborough United between 1994 and 1996.\n\nThe dates in the Freedom of Information request are significant because concerns were first formally reported about Higgins in February 1989 by Southampton\u2019s then youth-team manager, Dave Merrington, and then backed up by six young players in a subsequent police investigation.\n\nThe Telegraph has also learnt that Hampshire Constabulary is reviewing new reports and information about Higgins even subsequent to the investigations that resulted in his conviction in May for indecently assaulting 23 boys between 1971 and 1996.\n\nThe numbers already indicate Higgins was one of the most prolific abusers of young footballers in the country, but there is anger and frustration at the missed chances to stop him reoffending and the injustice still felt by those who first came forward when they were teenagers \u2013 more than 25 years before the scale of sexual abuse in football emerged in 2016.", "description": "The extent to which Bob Higgins, the paedophile former Southampton schoolboy coach, allegedly abused young footballers even after the authorities were alerted to concerns about his behaviour can be revealed.", "authors": ["Jeremy Wilson", "Chief Sports Reporter", "Sam Wallace", "Jason Burt"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/13/TELEMMGLPICT000198261457-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqyuLFFzXshuGqnr8zPdDWXiTUh73-1IAIBaONvUINpkg.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
