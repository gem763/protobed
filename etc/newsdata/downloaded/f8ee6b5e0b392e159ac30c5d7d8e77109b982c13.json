Now, a clip of the interruption is going viral online, with people loving the \u201cunexpected invasion in the studio by a cute invader,\u201d as one Twitter user put it.\n\n\n\n\n\nKube, who covers national security and the pentagon for NBC, was reporting on the Turkish incursion on Syria from the NBC Washington studio when her grinning 4-year-old son crept up from behind and reached for his mother on camera. Kube skillfully continued reporting with a smile on her face, moving her son away from the shot.\n\n\u201cExcuse me, my kids are here ... Live television,\u201d Kube said laughing before the screen cut to a graphic. When the camera turned back to Kube, she continued with the broadcast composed and unfazed.\n\nAccording to NBC, the interloper and his twin brother were both in the studio that morning after Kube was unable to drop them off at preschool. So, she took the boys with her to work instead.\n\n\"Breaking news in Syria didn\u2019t line up with preschool drop-off, so he and his twin brother were with me,\" Kube told NBC News.\n\nThe incident resembles a previous live BBC news segment in which a guest was hilariously interrupted by his young children. Professor Robert E. Kelly was explaining the removal of South Korea President Park Geun-Hye when his young daughter hilariously marched into his office, followed by his infant child in a baby bouncer.\n\nDespite the on-air blunder, people online are praising MSNBC and Kube for broadcasting a relatable moment in the life of a working mom. The viral video has already garnered over 17,000 likes on Twitter.\n\n\u201c[Courtney Kube] showing the world how #workingmoms make it happen!\u201d NBC legal contributor Katie Phang tweeted.\n\nOther working moms who empathized with Kube shared similar experiences with their own children. \u201c...When you\u2019re trying to get that just right headshot, but your kid won\u2019t let you be great,\u201d one fellow mom replied, with a picture of her son photobombing her photo shoot.\n\nOr when you're trying to get that just right headshot, but your kid won't let you be great. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/4r0NA7RT6N \u2014 Just Bran (@BMaburu) October 9, 2019\n\nMany people online praised Kube for how smoothly she handled the situation, carrying on with the broadcast like a true professional \u2014 and a loving mom.\n\n\u201cBest part of the programming so far this morning. Although she might have been surprised and stressed about her surprise on-camera guest, I loved the way she looked at her child with a big smile and lots of love,\u201d one user replied. \u201cThat's a mom with her priorities straight.\u201d\n\nAnother user added that the sweet moment was much needed in the midst of an \u201cawful and serious\u201d news cycle. \u201cThat was the sweetest thing I\u2019ve seen in a while. We need to see things like that in this period of awful and serious news,\u201d one user tweeted.\n\nOthers are praising MSNBC for embracing the hilarious moment and supporting Kube and other mothers in the newsroom, adding that they hope to see more relatable moments like this on air.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s fantastic that she\u2019s allowed to have her kids around while working. Good on you MSNBC,\u201d one user praised.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThank you, MSNBC, for supporting working parents! I LOVED the \u2018interruption\u2019 and Kourtney's ability to multitask. Bravo,\u201d a user on Facebook commented. \u201cIt\u2019s refreshing to see real life on your network.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c this! (Except for the news she\u2019s having to report on right now) Kudos msnbc for a parent/kid friendly environment and for mom\u2019s ability to multitask! \u2014 Ashley for Whistleblowers!! (@ashleyjb33) October 9, 2019\n\n@MSNBC gets a win for supporting their working moms on this one, because that little boy just looks happy to be there, and we don't hear any crying when he leaves.
