Mr. Morey \u201cundoubtedly seriously hurt the feelings of Chinese basketball fans.\u201d\n\nAll of this comes just as the Los Angeles Lakers and the Brooklyn Nets are headed to China for a two-game exhibition. The Nets are owned by Joe Tsai, a co-founder of Alibaba, who weighed in on the Morey controversy in a long Facebook post that called the tweet \u201cdamaging,\u201d the democracy protesters a \u201cseparatist movement\u201d and the subject of Hong Kong\u2019s independence a \u201cthird-rail issue.\u201d\n\nThat an Alibaba chief sees the situation this way \u2014 the company\u2019s technology has been used by the Chinese government to surveil its citizens \u2014 should not come as a surprise to anyone. The question is how an American league that prides itself on promoting progressive values squares those values with allowing an apologist for authoritarianism to own one of its teams. What\u2019s more, why is a league run by a commissioner who rightly criticized President Trump\u2019s Muslim travel ban for going \u201cagainst the fundamental values and the fundamental ingredients of what makes for a great N.B.A.\u201d also running a training camp for young players in the Chinese region of Xinjiang, amid camps of a far different kind?\n\nWoke politics often seems to train our collective attention down on our navels rather than out at the world. Is the issue of gender-neutral bathrooms really as morally urgent as a country that is, as Pete Buttigieg sharply put it, \u201cusing technology for the perfection of dictatorship?\u201d This is a worldview that encourages companies to take cost-free stands on the progressive cause of the moment and do absolutely nothing to uphold fundamental progressive values when doing so requires more sacrifice than the time it takes to write up a news release. A worldview that fails to force companies like the N.B.A., Apple, Google and Disney to account for the fact that they are serving as handmaidens to totalitarians is not one worth taking seriously.\n\nThe longstanding conventional wisdom on China \u2014 that engagement and investment by America in China would inevitably lead to the country\u2019s political liberalization \u2014 has simply not proven true. This is the chestnut Adam Silver himself insists on, when he speaks about the possibilities of \u201cbasketball diplomacy.\u201d\n\nAlas, just the opposite has happened.\n\nChina has become more repressive the more it has engaged with the West. Meantime, that economic engagement has led major Western businesses and institutions to keep quiet on a major moral issue of this century. The N.B.A.-China partnership is just one example of so many in which Beijing is calling the shots.\n\nReal political wisdom on this score lies with the creators of \u201cSouth Park,\u201d who, having offended China with an episode this week, dunked on the N.B.A.\u2019s cravenness.\n\n\u201cLike the N.B.A., we welcome the Chinese censors into our homes and into our hearts,\u201d said Trey Parker and Matt Stone in a statement. \u201cWe too love money more than freedom and democracy. Xi doesn\u2019t just look like Winnie the Pooh at all. Tune into our 300th episode this Wednesday at 10! Long live the Great Communist Party of China!
