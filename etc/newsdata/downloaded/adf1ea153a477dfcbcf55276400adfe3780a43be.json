Moreover, Hunter played no role in directing or making BHR\u2019s investments.\"\n\nMesires said Hunter Biden was going to resign from the BHR board by Oct. 31.\n\nMore: Trump's conspiracy theories thrive in Ukraine, where a young democracy battles corruption and distrust\n\nAccording to Mesires, \"Hunter undertook these business activities independently,\" never discussed them with Joe Biden, and \"When Hunter engaged in his business pursuits, he believed that he was acting appropriately and in good faith.\"\n\nHunter Biden \"never anticipated the barrage of false charges\" from Trump, Mesires wrote.\n\nIf Joe Biden were elected president in 2020, Hunter Biden pledged \"not to serve on boards of, or work on behalf of, foreign owned companies\" and comply with all ethics and guidelines related to conflicts of interest, Mesires concluded.\n\nJoe Biden has defended his son on the campaign trail and has said Hunter Biden would serve a visible role on his 2020 campaign.\n\n\"He's a fine man. He's been through hell,\" Joe Biden said of his son in an Oct. 3 interview with the Reno Gazette-Journal, part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Hunter Biden to resign from board of Chinese firm BHR", "description": "In a statement, Hunter Biden said he would resign from a Chinese company's board and pledged not to join boards if Joe Biden were elected president.", "authors": ["Nicholas Wu", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ckqfii2hdirQ7xMPqvVWpA--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://d.yimg.com/hd/cp-video-transcode/1009217/b0c8e93f-8265-4dec-a2a2-ea8021613589/016520cb-372f-5cf2-91d6-1a787bc8b206/data_3_0.jpg?s=b0af0852996b705f6c2e4b8c0e555d18&c=83a13030006a274c2aa17d52b0c951c0&a=tripleplay4us&mr=0", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
