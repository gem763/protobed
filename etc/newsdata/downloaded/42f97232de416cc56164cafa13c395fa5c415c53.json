This comes on the heels of former Mayor Michael Bloomberg also announcing a $160 million-dollar campaign to end youth vaping. During his appearance, he commented that vaping could cause kids\u2019 IQ to drop 15 points. Despite both men coming from different political camps, both highlight an important characteristic of the \u201cvaping hysteria.\u201d The war on vaping hinges on youth health.\n\nSince the mid-2000s when a Chinese chemist created the e-cigarette because his father died from cancer, vaping has given a path for people to end the deadly habit. It is widely accepted that vaping is 95 percent safer than smoking and twice as effective with helping people quit than the nicotine patch. In fact, 7 million lives could be saved if smokers switch to vaping.\n\nAlready, we are seeing youth take up smoking at record-low numbers, which suggests that vaping is leading kids away from smoking.\n\nYet despite these waves of research, vaping and smoking are still seen as one and the same. However, the only notable similarity between vaping and cigarettes is nicotine. But is nicotine enough to wage war on the industry?\n\nHere\u2019s what we know about nicotine: it can cause anxiety, mood swings, and irritability along with a few other symptoms. Notably, it is also addictive and thus hard to quit. However, if lawmakers are concerned about youth health, then alcohol should be treated the same as e-cigarettes.\n\nWhile underage vaping now falls around 20 percent, underage drinking is at 30 percent causing 4,300 deaths and 119,000 emergency room visits annually. Alcohol is also a more dangerous chemical causing people to become hostile and engage in sexual activity. Yet despite the widespread underage access of alcohol, no one has said we need to restrict certain flavors to protect the youth. So why is vaping any different?\n\nMany have argued that vaping companies are specifically targeting teens with fruity and dessert flavors. But therein lies three problems.\n\nFirst, alcohol comes in appealing flavors with options like mango and peach. There are certainly appealing designs and brands ranging from Captain Morgan to the famous \u201cMost Interesting Man in the World\u201d commercials. Yet, clearly no one has argued we must \u201ccrack down\u201d on alcohol marketing to protect the youth.\n\nSecond, the assumption that kids are the only ones attracted to fruity flavors while adults only prefer earthy flavors is faulty. Extensive research finds that adult smokers looking to quit, prefer fruity and chocolate flavors over menthol-based flavors. Just like flavored alcohol, fruity vapes appeal to everyone.\n\nThird, taking away flavors does not imply teens would suddenly stop vaping. An Ernest and Young report finds that the most common reason people start vaping is because it\u2019s safer than smoking and can help them quit, while the least common reason being \u201cvariety of flavors.\u201d It would seem utility, not flavors, are the foundational cause of vaping.\n\nWith the rise of vaping has also come the fear of vaping. Yet despite all the progress of decade-low smoking rates among teens, children have been used as the \u201cTrojan Horse\u201d to feed a non-evidence based hysteria. Unfortunately for now, it seems like it\u2019s working.\n\nJanson Q.
