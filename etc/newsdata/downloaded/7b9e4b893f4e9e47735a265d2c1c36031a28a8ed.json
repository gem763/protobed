Gogo Lizzy Masuku\u2019s young neighbour loved tending to the vegetable patch in his yard but she wasn\u2019t bothered by his early morning routine. In fact, she always admired her neigh- bour\u2019s green fingers.\n\n\u201cHis spinach and mealies always came out a lot bigger than ours but I thought it was because he has a tractor and bigger hose pipes,\u201d Gogo Lizzy (73) says.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know he was using people\u2019s bodies as fertiliser.\u201d\n\nJulius Mndawe, the so-called Masoyi Monster, hit headlines when he was arrested for the rape and murder of five young women, all aged between 15 and 24, in Mpumalanga. For more than a year a predator has been stalking women in Masoyi as well as in the neighbouring village of Numbi.\n\nThe 25-year-old man recently confessed to killing Banele Khoza, Nomthan- dazo Mdluli, Noxolo Mdluli, Felicia Ndlhovu and Tokkie Tlaka. He took police to his home in Masoyi where he pointed out the bodies buried in his house and back garden.\n\nGog\u2019 Lizzy is stunned she\u2019s been living next to an alleged serial killer. At one point Mndawe, a former security guard, minded her young grandchildren while she went to church. She can\u2019t believe the man she treated like a son has been accused of such monstrous crimes.\n\n\u201cWe both love growing vegetables. He really took good care of his vegetables. He\u2019d even give me fertiliser.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know I was growing my plants next to dead bodies.\n\n\u201cI was so shocked I even had to go to the clinic because my blood pressure\n\nshot up.\u201d\n\nGog\u2019 Lizzy saw Mndawe bloom from a boy to a young man.\n\n\u201cI know his mother. She said if he gives me problems, I should tell them, but I loved him. I preferred talking to him than telling his parents because he was a child to me.\u201d He was \u201cquiet\u201d, she says, yet there was one time she decided to give him a talking to.\n\n\u201cAt some point his loud music shattered our house windows,\u201d she recalls.\n\n\u201cI pleaded with him several times to turn it down, especially at night, but he didn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t argue with me either. He just turned back and left me standing there. That boy had a thing for loud music.\u201d\n\nNow she believes he was trying to make sure they didn\u2019t hear anything sinister.\n\nHer home is separated from the graveyard of death by a chicken-wire fence. Mndawe\u2019s three-roomed house has been torched, allegedly by angry community members outraged that the young women\u2019s bodies were found in the back yard of one of their own. This has destroyed evidence and compromised the case.\n\nFour bricks used to support his mattress are visible through the shattered windows. Gog\u2019 Lizzy gazes at the pawpaw tree in Mndawe\u2019s garden. He often shared the fruit and vegetables he grew in abundance with neighbours and friends.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve been eating food from this soil,\u201d she says.\n\nShe\u2019d always regarded Mndawe a bit of a ladies\u2019 man but she can\u2019t believe the women\u2019s bodies were buried practically under her nose.\n\n\u201cI watched as girls went in and out of his house. I would see them wash his clothes and clean his house. Sometimes it would be two girls at the same time,\u201d she tells us.\n\nThe devout Christian occasionally asked Mndawe to look after her grandchildren, girls aged between nine and 14, so she could attend church on those Sundays when her son, a long-distance truck driver, had to work.\n\n\u201cI trusted him with them because I thought he was a good person,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know he was capable of something like this.\u201d\n\nThose who know him agree. His friend Bernard Mashaba describes Mndawe as a good guy with a weakness for women.\n\n\u201cI still ask myself what happened to this boy because he\u2019d go to work, come back and go to his garden. He wasn\u2019t troublesome.\u201d\n\nMndawe reportedly confessed to committing multiple murders after he was arrested in June and charged with the murder of 24-year-old Tokkie, who is thought to have been his last victim.\n\nNomthandazo (18) and Felicia (19) \u2013 who were close friends \u2013 were found buried beneath the floor of an extra room Mndawe was building, while the bodies of Banele (15), Noxolo (19) and Tokkie were hidden in the garden.\n\nOne of the victims was buried with her cellphone, according to reports.\n\nBernard is still taken aback by the gruesome discovery: \u201cWe ate his vegetables not knowing there were bodies buried there. They were fresh and his soil was very rich, so we enjoyed free veggies. I don\u2019t think anyone can lie and say they didn\u2019t eat it.\u201d\n\nAnother friend of his, Vusi Mnisi (30), says he thinks Mndawe couldn\u2019t live with his secrets anymore. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t sleeping at all. He worked as a security guard but he would come back from work in the afternoon and buy us alcohol every day.\u201d\n\nThe three drinking buddies would sit and drink at Mndawe\u2019s house.\n\n\u201cThere was no smell,\u201d Vusi says.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what he used to kill the smell but we drank there and we didn\u2019t smell anything foul.\u201d\n\nTokkie\u2019s sister Gladness knew something was wrong when she hadn\u2019t heard from her in a while.\n\nTokkie, whom she described as very private, had gone out on 10 May but Gladness started worrying when she hadn\u2019t returned home to her four-year-old daughter after a few days.\n\nShe filed a missing person report with the Masoyi police, who tracked Tokkie\u2019s cell-phone. It led them toMndawe\u2019s house. Tokkie had arranged to meet him through Facebook, Times Live reports.\n\nThe pair had only known each other for three days. Her sister\u2019s alleged killer is facing a lifetime behind bars but it\u2019s little comfort to Gladness. \u201cI miss her,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cWe were only two girls and three brothers, all of whom are married.\n\n\u201cI want him to die. I think I\u2019ll have peace when I know he is also dead. What he did is painful. I miss my sister every day; I miss her smile and I miss her teasing me. Now I have to look after her daughter because Tokkie is dead.\u201d\n\nAugust marks a year since Noxolo\u2019s family last saw her. She was in matric at Mshadza Secondary School when she disappeared last year. Her mother, Thembisile Mdluli, says she wasn\u2019t worried when Noxolo didn\u2019t come home after a few days as she often spent weeks at her friends\u2019 homes \u201cbut I used to call her almost every day and she did the same\u201d, she says.\n\n\u201cThen she suddenly stopped calling me.\u201d\n\nThe distraught mom says she received a text message from her daughter\u2019s phone warning her to stop calling.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep or eat, thinking about my child. I\u2019ve lost weight because of this.\u201d\n\nShe reported her daughter missing to police but claims no one did anything. Desperate, Thembisile wrote to SABC1\u2019s Khumbul\u2019ekhaya for help to find her only daughter. Now the mom knows what happened, yet she still has questions.\n\n\u201cI want to know why this boy killed my daughter.\u201d", "description": "Neighbours have been left reeling after the gruesome discovery of five women\u2019s bodies in alleged serial killer\u2019s house and garden.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9493/952f810f1d0041869581ca102d960bda.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
