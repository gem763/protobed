Here\u2019s how I came to terms with the nation's most common mental illness.\n\nI\u2019ve finally settled on a pre-talk regimen that enables me to avoid the weeks of anticipatory misery that the approach of a public-speaking engagement would otherwise produce.\n\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re sitting in an audience and I\u2019m at the lectern. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve likely done to prepare. Four hours or so ago, I took my first half milligram of Xanax. (I\u2019ve learned that if I wait too long to take it, my fight-or-flight response kicks so far into overdrive that medication is not enough to yank it back.) Then, about an hour ago, I took my second half milligram of Xanax and perhaps 20 milligrams of Inderal. (I need the whole milligram of Xanax plus the Inderal, which is a blood-pressure medication, or beta-blocker, that dampens the response of the sympathetic nervous system, to keep my physiological responses to the anxious stimulus of standing in front of you\u2014the sweating, trembling, nausea, burping, stomach cramps, and constriction in my throat and chest\u2014from overwhelming me.) I likely washed those pills down with a shot of scotch or, more likely, vodka, the odor of which is less detectable on my breath. Even two Xanax and an Inderal are not enough to calm my racing thoughts and to keep my chest and throat from constricting to the point where I cannot speak; I need the alcohol to slow things down and to subdue the residual physiological eruptions that the drugs are inadequate to contain. In fact, I probably drank my second shot\u2014yes, even though I might be speaking to you at, say, 9 in the morning\u2014between 15 and 30 minutes ago, assuming the pre-talk proceedings allowed me a moment to sneak away for a quaff.", "description": "Surviving anxiety, the biggest hustler in e-commerce, the case for paternity leave, why we love auction shows, a brief history of the Mile High Club, and more", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/issues/2015/06/02/2014_01_coverRGB/original.jpg"}
