It\u2019s a familiar sound: a computer trying to cool down a processor that\u2019s being overtaxed by one of the eight or so apps I have running. (In this case, it\u2019s TweetDeck going rogue.) But it\u2019s also a sound you don\u2019t hear on more futuristic computers like the iPad, the Surface Pro, or even the Pixelbook. Still, fan or not, the computer is handling everything I\u2019m doing just fine, and a quick restart of the app quiets it down.\n\nThat fan is a weird place to start when talking about the new $1,199 MacBook Air. I\u2019d rather jump into all the many good things there are to talk about: the pixel density on the new display, smaller bezels, Touch ID, the T2 security chip, a larger trackpad, and a smaller design. I\u2019ll get into all that. But I want to hang with this fan noise for another minute because its whirring encapsulates the most important thing to know about this MacBook Air.\n\nNamely: it\u2019s a computer that will let you do whatever you want, even though some of those things are probably beyond its capabilities. It won\u2019t say \u201cno\u201d when you want to open 20 tabs and eight apps and then edit a photo. (Though, sometimes, with a fan and spinning beachball, it will say \u201cuncle.\u201d) Most of all, it\u2019s a computer that is familiar. It does everything you expect in a way that you\u2019re used to.\n\nSometimes, that\u2019s enough.\n\nWhen I started testing the new MacBook Air, I spent a lot of time thinking about what I should compare it to. For $100 more, you could get a 13-inch MacBook Pro with a more powerful processor and brighter screen that only weighs 0.27 pounds more. You could also opt for a 12-inch MacBook with a slightly less powerful processor that weighs 0.72 pounds less. You wouldn\u2019t get Touch ID with either, but the point is that choosing between this new Air and existing MacBooks is not as easy as it ought to be.\n\nIs this new Air like a 12-inch MacBook, just blown up to a slightly bigger size? Is it more like a 13-inch MacBook Pro (sans Touch Bar), just with cheaper parts? After all, if you set the latter down next to this new Air, you can barely tell them apart.\n\nMy answer is that it\u2019s both of those things. But the more truthful answer is that it doesn\u2019t matter. People who have purchased one of those MacBooks already have a fairly modern, powerful computer that\u2019s nice to use. The comparison that actually matters is to the old MacBook Air. There are a ton of people who have been hanging on to theirs because it was so good and so reliable.\n\nComparing a 2018 laptop to one that hasn\u2019t had a significant update since 2015 is going to strike tech enthusiasts as ridiculous. Of course the new Air is going to beat out the old Air on a whole host of metrics. But that\u2019s precisely the point: Apple waited entirely too long to release something like this new Air, so people have been waiting.\n\nUSB-C is still the future, but we\u2019re waiting for it to be everywhere \u2014 RIP MagSafe\n\nIf you\u2019re one of those people, you\u2019ve got a lot to catch up on. This new MacBook Air essentially takes all of the new stuff Apple has been doing with laptops for the past three years and builds it into a single device. So let\u2019s just get into what you\u2019re in for.\n\nFirst: ports and charging. Say goodbye to MagSafe for power forever. The new Air has two USB-C ports that you use to plug everything in, including power. It\u2019s the new standard for pretty much everything except iPhones. Though, as a standard, it is taking longer to, well, standardize than anybody would like.\n\nThe new charging cable doesn\u2019t pop out when you trip on it, but that will not be the thing that impacts you the most. Instead, welcome to #donglelife. You\u2019re going to need a few adapters to make sure everything that you currently plug into your old laptop will work on the new one. Fortunately, there are now some nice USB-C hubs that combine everything together. So the upside is you can have just a single cable at your desk for your monitor, power, USB-A, SD cards, and everything else.\n\nThere is a headphone jack, thankfully, but no SD card slot. Sorry.\n\nSecond is the screen. More than any other upgrade on the MacBook Air, this is the one you\u2019re going to love. It\u2019s a Retina Display, which, in this case, equates to a resolution of 2560 x 1600 pixels. It\u2019s sharp and beautiful under a glossy pane of glass, with much smaller bezels. Those bezels are not as tiny as what you can get on some Windows laptops, but it\u2019s still a massive improvement over the old Air.\n\nThere is one knock on the screen, though: it doesn\u2019t get as bright as I would like. The spec on it is a max of 300 nits, but the important thing to know is you\u2019ll be cranking up the brightness to near 100 percent more often. I haven\u2019t had a problem viewing this screen, even in bright rooms, but I do have a vague worry that it\u2019s affecting my battery life to have it cranked up higher.\n\nOkay, two knocks: it\u2019s not a touchscreen. Apple\u2019s macOS isn\u2019t designed to work with touch at all, so it\u2019s not here. Most other computers these days \u2014 whatever their form factor \u2014 do support touch.\n\nThird: the keyboard. It\u2019s Apple\u2019s newer \u201cbutterfly\u201d design, which means that the key travel is super shallow, dust could potentially break it, and typing can be kind of loud. This third-generation version of it is designed to mitigate those last two concerns with a membrane that sits underneath the keycaps. You\u2019ll find it\u2019s a little weird to type on for the first day, but you\u2019ll get used to it. Some people still really don\u2019t like it, but I\u2019m not one of them: I really like this keyboard, even if it is a little clacky.\n\nFourth is Touch ID and security. You can log in with just your fingerprint now, and it\u2019s ridiculously fast and accurate. I\u2019ve been able to just quickly tap it like any key and unlock my computer. It\u2019s not as convenient as the face unlock you get with Windows Hello-compatible computers, but it\u2019s close. Best of all, you get Touch ID without having to get the silly Touch Bar that\u2019s on MacBook Pros. Instead, you just have real, regular function keys.\n\nTouch ID is powered by Apple\u2019s T2 chip, which is a little thing that keeps the entire laptop secure. It protects your fingerprint, encrypts the SSD without taxing the processor, and even turns the microphones off when the laptop is closed. It also handles a random assortment of other tasks, like video encoding and audio processing for the speakers to give them a wider soundstage. Those speakers are louder, too.\n\nFifth: a big upgrade for the trackpad. It\u2019s way bigger now, though not quite as big as what you\u2019ll find on a MacBook Pro. More importantly, it has the unfortunately named \u201cForce Touch\u201d feature, which means you can press down anywhere on the pad to get a satisfying click. You might not think your MacBook Air\u2019s trackpad was bad, but trust me, this is so much nicer.\n\nSixth is just overall build quality. This laptop feels a lot nicer than the old MacBook Air. It fits the same size screen in a smaller body, but it\u2019s not as thin or as light as the thinnest and lightest of laptops you can get today. When the first Air came out, it amazed everybody. This one, though very well-built, does not stand out from the pack when it comes to size or weight.\n\nApple says it\u2019s made of 100 percent recycled aluminum, but it feels just like any other Apple laptop. In fact, you could say it recycles a lot the design ideas from both the 12-inch MacBook and the 13-inch MacBook Pro into this Air-shaped tapered design.\n\nSeventh and last, let\u2019s talk about specs. The story with specs gets a little complicated because the story with Intel processors is a little complicated. The processor inside the new MacBook Air is an 8th Gen, dual-core Intel Core i5, which sounds pretty good. And it is pretty good \u2014 but not all Intel processors are created equal.\n\nThe thing that neither Apple nor Intel will make easy for you to see is that this is a \u201cY-series\u201d processor, which means that it\u2019s more of a low-power chip than what you\u2019d get on a MacBook Pro or many Windows laptops. That detail might not matter for the average MacBook Air buyer, but it\u2019s important for people who want a thin laptop that also happens to be powerful. I am one of those people, and I instinctively look down my nose at the Y-series.\n\nMacBook Air with Retina Display specs Display: 13.3-inch Retina Display, 2560 x 1600, 300 nits max brightness\n\nSecurity: Touch ID, T2 chip\n\nProcessor: 8th Gen Intel Core dual-core i5 Y-Series, 1.6GHz\n\nStorage: 128GB, configurable to 1.5TB\n\nRAM: 8GB, configurable to 16GB\n\nBattery: 50.3Wh, claimed 12 hours of web browsing\n\nPorts: two Thunderbolt 3 USB-C, one headphone jack\n\nDimensions: 0.61 x 11.97 x 8.36 inches\n\nWeight: 2.75 pounds\n\nThe complicated part is that Apple doesn\u2019t just take a chip off the line and slap it in. Instead, it does some customization. So this Y-series chip is powered up to 7 watts, which is a higher wattage than what other laptops usually do with the same processor. In other words, don\u2019t judge this laptop by the label on its processor.\n\nSo let me just bottom line it: this new MacBook Air is faster than the old MacBook Air, but not by the kind of margin you\u2019d expect after three years (or even one, if you happened to buy the 2017 model). You can do all of the same stuff you can do on your current Air. I have been running a half-dozen apps at a time along with more than a dozen tabs in Chrome, and everything is pretty okay. I think for what most people will do with this laptop, it\u2019s fine. The base $1,199 model comes with 8GB of RAM (which is enough for most people) and 128GB of storage (which is not).\n\nIf you\u2019re hoping you\u2019ll be able to upgrade and get way faster video editing or process a ton of RAW photos at once, get a MacBook Pro. Those kinds of tasks will bring this Air to a chug and spin up those fans. I have found it to be more capable and powerful than the 12-inch MacBook, but, again, the difference is not as big as I\u2019d hoped.\n\nI don\u2019t think of any of this as a problem, though \u2014 not really. The Air can do everything I want it to in my daily workflow. I just want to be clear that my daily workflow doesn\u2019t push the limits of this processor. My guess is that if you\u2019re still using a MacBook Air, neither does yours.\n\nAs for battery life, I am not getting Apple\u2019s claimed 12 hours of web browsing time. (Though, to be fair, nobody I know uses a computer only to browse the web in Safari for 12 hours straight.) I\u2019d say I\u2019m safely getting seven hours of fairly active use: a mix of browsing, email, Slack, Twitter, some photo editing, and some more intense testing from time to time. You could probably get more than that with a little restraint, but one of those restraints would be a screen ratcheted down to a fairly dim brightness. It\u2019s not a battery life champion, in other words, but I can almost guarantee you it\u2019ll last longer than the decrepit battery in your current Air.\n\nIs all of this worth $1,200? Yes. The performance and quality of this MacBook Air justify its price. Do I wish that Apple had found a way to make a slightly less expensive laptop? My answer is also yes. (I am fully aware that those two ideas conflict.) As I said, the already-existing MacBooks might better fit your needs.\n\nThe real issue here is that you can get an iPad Pro or a Windows Laptop or even a Chromebook for less money that does almost everything this thing can do \u2014 almost everything. But there\u2019s one very important thing they can\u2019t do: run macOS.\n\nNow that the new MacBook Air is finally here, it\u2019s par for the laptop course\n\nAnd that\u2019s the deal. People like the Mac. It\u2019s great to have a computer that does all of the computer stuff you want in a way you\u2019re familiar with. Until recently, the best computer for most people was the MacBook Air, and Apple took way too long to update it. So people have been waiting. And waiting.\n\nNow, the wait is over. But if you were hoping that lightning would strike twice and this new MacBook Air would be as revolutionary as the old MacBook Air, well, it\u2019s not. It\u2019s basically a MacBook that finally includes all of the stuff that has been happening with laptops for the past few years. It is on par with the rest of the laptop world, but it hasn\u2019t moved beyond it. Sometimes that means the fan is going to spin up on you.\n\nIf you\u2019re the kind of person who can switch to Windows, you can find something just as good and probably a little bit faster for less money. Microsoft\u2019s Surface Laptop 2 and Surface Pro 6, for example, are really solid. But a lot of people just want a good, modern, reliable Mac. Nothing fancy, really. They just deserve something that\u2019s up to par.\n\nAnd for those people, the ones who have been hanging on to that old MacBook Air, this is a nice upgrade. It\u2019s par for the course \u2014 and that\u2019s probably enough.", "description": "Apple has finally updated its iconic MacBook Air laptop with a Retina Display, a new keyboard, and new ports.
