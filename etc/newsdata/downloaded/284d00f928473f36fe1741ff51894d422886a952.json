The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is investigating nearly 1,300 cases of lung disease that some officials suspect were triggered by vaping. At least 26 deaths, including one in Michigan, have been attributed to the lung disease. In Michigan, 35 lung disease cases have been reported, according to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nVaping ban: Massachusetts vaping ban allowed to stand for now amid court challenge\n\nTHC vaping crisis: Deadly vaping crisis threatens to ensnare Juul's lucrative marijuana sibling, Pax Labs\n\nMichigan ordered that all flavored vape products be removed from store shelves. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer announced the ban Sept. 3.\n\n\u201cThere should be no question that we completely disagree\u201d with the ruling, said Tiffany Brown, spokeswoman for Whitmer.\n\nSeveral states followed Michigan\u2019s lead in banning flavored vapes or all vape products, and the administration of President Donald Trump indicated that it would implement a ban on the flavored products.\n\nStephens said the state was fully aware of the problem nearly a year ago and couldn\u2019t justify the need for the emergency rules.\n\n\u201cIndeed an agency cannot create an emergency by way of its own failure to act,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe court concludes that the record, at least at this juncture, does not substantiate the declaration of an emergency which necessitated dispensing with the \u2026 normal rule-making procedures which afford the public meaningful opportunities to be heard.\u201d\n\nThe issue doesn't go away. Stephens wrote, \"This is not a final order and it neither resolves the last pending claim nor closes the case.\"\n\nFollow Kathleen Gray on Twitter @michpoligal.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Detroit Free Press: Michigan's flavored vape ban temporarily halted by court", "description": "Court temporarily halts Michigan's ban on flavored vapes, backing businesses that say they would have to close if the ban stays in effect", "authors": ["Kathleen Gray", "Detroit Free Press"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/KHAtIV_vM2E3lB2GUyreZg--~B/aD0yNzUxO3c9MzYzNTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/2f03797db160e908eb3304c222846c4d", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
