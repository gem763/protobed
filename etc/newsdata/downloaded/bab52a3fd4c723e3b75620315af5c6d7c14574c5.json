What about letting others borrow yours to help pay for it?\n\nI\u2019ve lost count of the number of times I\u2019ve been told over the years about car sharing schemes set to revolutionise how we drive.\n\nIt barely needs saying, but despite the bold claims none has quite pulled off an Airbnb or Uber quite yet.\n\nRenting out your car five times a month to earn about \u00a3350 could cover the bulk of the monthly PCP payments on a new Tesla Model 3 (if not the \u00a310,000 deposit)\n\nThe idea found itself back on the agenda this week, with Labour\u2019s pledge to put 30,000 electric cars on Britain\u2019s roads that could be used by members of publicly-owned community car clubs.\n\nSerendipitously, that was just a few days after I met up with Andre Haddad, the CEO of the major US car-sharing player Turo, which is making a big push into the UK.\n\nTapping into the Airbnb ethos, Turo connects those happy to rent out their car and those who wish to pay to use it.\n\nMost people\u2019s cars sit for hours or days on end unused, the argument goes, so why not let other people pay to use them when they would otherwise be languishing on the drive or road, or parked at the station? This can either help cover the cost of owning a car \u2013 or even turn you a profit.\n\nSimilarly, car hire is a fairly joyless experience dominated by big faceless global corporations, so why not save some money \u2013 avoid the rip-offs at the desk \u2013 and rent a car from a fellow citizen instead?\n\nBefitting a start-up CEO, Andre is an enthusiastic ambassador for Turo - the world\u2019s biggest car-sharing platform apparently \u2013 and also it turns out a bit of a car nut.\n\nBefore we got down to discussing Turo, we spent a good 20 minutes talking cars and the conversation frequently veered off in that direction.\n\nHe uses Turo to rent out his cars at home, including a Porsche 911 Carrera S, full suite of Teslas, Models S, X and 3, Audi R8, and another 911 convertible.\n\nThat chimes with his desire to make Turo a car sharing platform designed to be cheaper than and as convenient as car hire, and also one where people can go for an experience and enthusiasts can help cover the cost of owning interesting cars.\n\nAs convincing as he sounds, however, I did have to ask why if car sharing is such a great idea it doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s really taken off?\n\nAndre is keen to point out growth in the US is rapid and that in Britain Turo has more than 147,000 people signed up and 7,000 vehicles listed.\n\nIt says that its average British owner - most of whom are based in London - makes \u00a350 per day from letting their car and does so for five to seven days a month, although that is for the most popular and cheaper economy models.\n\nNonetheless, compared to overall car usage that\u2019s a drop in the ocean.\n\nThe problem for car sharing firms says Andre is twofold: firstly, you need to make sure the experience is seamless, trusted and convenient; and, secondly, unlike Airbnb (renting houses), or Uber (driving minicabs), which facilitate something private individuals have been doing for years, Turo and its rivals are effectively creating a whole new business model for individuals.\n\nTuro has tackled this with Airbnb-style host and guest ratings, solid insurance, and trying to get to \u2018critical mass\u2019 in terms of cars on offer. Meanwhile, its new Turo Go system enables people to make near-instant bookings and owners to give them access via smartphone.\n\nRather than meeting renters to hand over keys, owners can remotely approve their rental request and they can then gain access to a key stored in the car with a smartphone app - similar to how short-term car rental firm ZipCar works.\n\nSome owners may still prefer to meet those borrowing their car, however, as Andre says he does.\n\nTuro's insurance covers problems and damage, cars are meant to be rented out and returned clean and full of fuel and it recently started offering a popular add-on cleaning fee.\n\nThose who bust the rules - either as hosts or guests - get poor ratings and get kicked off the platform.\n\nTuro is the world's biggest car sharing platform and is staging a big push into the UK\n\nSo, back to the original question, would I do this?\n\nI\u2019m too into cars to give up ownership, but I can see how those who are far less interested in how, what and where they are driving could do so, if a system was cheap and convenient enough.\n\nAs for renting my car out to others? That\u2019s a tricky one, I certainly wouldn\u2019t be letting people take my pride and joy Peugeot 205 GTI \u2013 with an easily dented 28-year-old French car that would be asking for trouble \u2013 but perhaps with the family car I would.\n\nI\u2019d quite like to go electric with our family car, but I have an aversion to buying new cars and those I\u2019d buy second hand are still too expensive and in short supply.\n\nBut, if I could make \u00a3350 a month by sharing my car for a five days, that could fund a big chunk of the monthly cost of a new Tesla Model 3 on a PCP deal, if not the \u00a310,000 deposit (and apparently electric cars are in hot demand on the platform).\n\nIt would require a total change of mindset though - and I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready for strangers driving \u2018my car\u2019.", "description": "Despite the bold claims of car-sharing services over the years none has quite pulled off an Airbnb or Uber quite yet.
