At the same time, however, Australia is coming to grips with the security and strategic implications of China\u2019s rise.\n\nAs an Australian parliamentarian, Ms Liu\u2019s loyalty must be beyond even a flicker of doubt: that should be clear in the exacting, pedantic interpretations of Section 44 of the Constitution that saw so many parliamentary careers in turmoil during the 2017-18 citizenship debacle. It is entirely legitimate to call on her to clear up some issues.\n\nMs Liu was not quick enough in a car-crash TV interview last week to distance herself from three organisations connected to the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s United Front operation, which tries to win hearts and minds among the 50 million-strong global Chinese diaspora. Ms Liu gave a non-answer when questioned whether China had broken international law in the South China Sea, flicking it off to Foreign Minister Marise Payne. Yet the novice backbencher\u2019s response partly reflects Australia\u2019s own hesitancy on the matter. US Ambassador Arthur Culvahouse, as revealed by The Australian Financial Review on the weekend, last week expressed frustration at Australia\u2019s lack of \u201cbackbone\u201d on China\u2019s spurious claims in the South China Sea. This could be on the political menu for Mr Morrison\u2019s state dinner with Donald Trump in Washington this week.\n\nMs Liu is a fundraising superstar for the Liberal Party among Melbourne\u2019s Chinese community. But that is a long way from the Aldi bag of cash, allegedly from a Chinese donor, handed over to the NSW Labor Party. It is even further away from former Labor senator Sam Dastyari, who was reported to have egregiously tipped off a Chinese contact that he was under Australian surveillance. It showed what could happen when the closely connected worlds of Chinese business and the Chinese communist party clumsily try to navigate the Australian political system and meet with the occasionally murky world of fund-raising among Australia\u2019s needy political parties.", "description": "Chinese Australians in a democratic parliament are the best repudiation of Beijing's sharp power techniques", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_602%2C$y_14/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/077b28ac37075ed6e31756d6c296d0a55f7ab678", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
