The election campaign witnessed BJP taking the lead where the party was expected to cross 225 seats in alliance with Shiv Sena in Maharashtra and win 75 out of 90 seats in Haryana on its own. While it is considered perfectly normal for political parties to project winning more seats than they believe during the election campaign, but BJP\u2019s winning streak in the past has made us start believing they can win as many seats as they claim.\n\nThe results are a glaring indication that voters still believe in local issues and caste affiliations and that BJP must pay heed to the troubled economy immediately. Despite all their claims and projections of all is good in the country, there is a sense of foreboding among the business, middle-class and agriculture community of what the future holds for them. There is also a sense of disappointment from the opposition parties for not playing a pro-active role in keeping the government on its toes. Voters in general worry about an uncertain future but with no viable opposition, appear to have all their hopes invested in the BJP.\n\nRealising their ground game isn\u2019t very sound on economy, BJP played big on abrogation of Article 370, Narendra Modi\u2019s drive against corruption and a possible push for a nation-wide NRC during the campaign in Maharashtra and Haryana. Congress\u2019 feeble attempt to oppose Article 370 seems to have come as a blessing in disguise for BJP. In hindsight, a rudderless Congress lost out on a big opportunity in not having put up a sustained resistance against the BJP, leaving regional satraps to fend for themselves.\n\nIt is not often that the ruling party retains power in the state, mainly due to anti-incumbency. But the Narendra Modi-Amit Shah duo has changed the dynamics in Indian politics. Even though BJP appears to be the single largest party which is likely form the government in Maharashtra and possibly Haryana for the second successive time, the discussion is based around how BJP could not make any gains from 2014. BJP\u2019s fight is not with the opposition but with itself and how they can outperform their own previous performances. Having said that, all in all, these election results look more of a setback to Narendra Modi and Amit Shah rather than any ground gained by the opposition.", "description": "The Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections results are trickling in and if there is one thing that holds true more than others, is that BJP has lost more than gained rather than the opposition coming...", "authors": ["Sanjeev Singh"], "top_image": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Modi-Shah.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
