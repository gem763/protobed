Some of the kids that were doing this were suicidal and they were ready to end their lives and they didn't know where they were and this is a safe space for them to find themselves.\n\n'And if we can save a kid's life by putting on a pageant one day a year, why the hell aren't we doing it everywhere?'\n\nFabian (far left) with his mother Rachel (second left) and Leo (far right) and Leo's mother Lauren (second right)\n\nFabian in the gay village in Montreal, where the three young drag performers visited\n\nLeo later added: 'I think the reason why people are more judgemental is because they have their own opinions and they feel they have to give it out in order for people to get better.\n\n'But they don't realise it's downright hate, and sometimes people are evil.'\n\nTaking to Twitter, fans were inspired but the show, and praised Channel 5 for the great representation.\n\n'Drag Kids is such a cute programme!' one said.\n\nAnother added: 'This show is fantastic'.\n\nWhile a third wrote: 'Omg #dragkids was so wonderful'\n\nFabian's mother's Rachel (pictured together) said: 'Cesar taught the boys the runaway and to be taught by someone as big as that, just an amazing experience for them all.", "description": "Leo, 12, from Northamptonshire and Fabian, 9, from Wales flew to Canada and met legendary choreographer Cesar Valentino on 5*Star's docu-series: Kids in Drag: We're Fabulous.", "authors": ["Bridie Pearson-Jones For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/16/20140576-0-image-a-31_1571931734514.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
