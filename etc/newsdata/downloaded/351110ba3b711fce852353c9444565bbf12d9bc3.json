The plan appears to have been widely rejected by the EU.\n\nHowever, speaking at a press conference following the meeting, Varadkar said that following a \u201cvery positive and very promising\u201d meeting it is now possible for both parties to strike a deal by the \u201cend of October.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do see a pathway towards an agreement in the coming weeks,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Irish prime minister added that negotiations needed to continue to ensure that any long-term arrangement that applies to Northern Ireland has the consent of its people and that there is no customs border on the island of Ireland.\n\nVaradkar said it was possible to reach a deal by the European Council summit, but warned \u201cthere was many a slip between cup and lip.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, Varadkar had said Johnson\u2019s new proposals \u201cfall short in a number of aspects.\u201d\n\nDowning Street said in a statement after the meeting that both leaders believe a deal is in everybody\u2019s interest.\n\n\u201cThey agreed that they could see a pathway to a possible deal,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cThey agreed to reflect further on their discussions and that officials would continue to engage intensively on them.\u201d\n\nAn official said the Irish delegation emerged from the talks with a sense that more progress had been made than expected. U.K. and Irish officials will now both brief Barnier\u2019s Brexit taskforce on the substance of Johnson and Varadkar\u2019s discussion, with both sides cautiously hopeful they can form the basis of new negotiations.\n\nAhead of the meeting, U.K. officials said the best outcome would be for the Irish to emerge from it prepared to urge the EU to engage anew with the U.K.\u2019s proposals, allowing talks to enter \u201cthe tunnel\u201d \u2014 an intensive phase of closed-door negotiations with a view to a substantive outcome, as opposed to the technical but somewhat directionless discussions of recent days.\n\nIt was not initially clear what new proposals have been put on the table by either side, but the change in mood from Irish officials strongly suggests there has been movement from the U.K side at least.\n\nThe U.K.\u2019s Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay will continue talks Friday morning at a meeting with the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "description": "The prime ministers of Britain and Ireland \u2018see a pathway to a possible deal,\u2019 says Downing Street.", "authors": ["Cristina Gallardo", "Charlie Cooper"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1174969028-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
