Ambarella Inc slumped 12%.\n\nThe Philadelphia Semiconductor index declined 2.3%, while technology stocks dropped 1.2%.\n\nWeighing on the Dow Jones Industrial Average was a 1.5% fall in shares of Boeing Co.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported friction between the United States and Europe could further delay efforts to resume flights of the planemaker's best-selling 737 MAX jets, which have been grounded since early 2019.\n\nInvestors fled to the perceived safety of gold and government debt. Gold prices rose nearly 1%, while yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury dropped.\n\nAt 9:50 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 264.98 points, or 1.00%, at 26,213.04, while the S&P 500 was down 33.40 points, or 1.14%, at 2,905.39. The Nasdaq Composite was down 90.11 points, or 1.13%, at 7,866.19.\n\nMarket participants will now focus on third-quarter earnings season beginning next week and analysts expect the worst quarterly profit performance since 2016, with earnings from S&P 500 companies declining nearly 3% from a year earlier, based on IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nDomino's Pizza dropped 3.5% after the pizza chain missed Wall Street estimates for quarterly same-store sales and profit.\n\nU.S.-listed Chinese stocks also declined, with Alibaba Group Holding, JD.com Inc and Baidu Inc falling between 2.7% and 3%.\n\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers for a 4.14-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 4.08-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\n\nThe S&P index recorded one new 52-week highs and 10 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded five new highs and 60 new lows.
