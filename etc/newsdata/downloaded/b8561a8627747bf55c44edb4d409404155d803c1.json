For the first two weeks, participants ate a diet that \u201cmimicked an average American diet,\u201d which allowed all those involved to \u201cbegin the study on similar nutritional \u2018footing,\u2019\u201d according to a news release regarding the study.\n\nLater, the participants were separated at random into three groups. Each group either followed a low-fat diet, a moderate-fat diet, or a moderate-fat diet that also involved eating an avocado each day.\n\nFive weeks later, those who ate an avocado each day \u201chad significantly lower levels of oxidized LDL cholesterol than before the study began or after completing the low- and moderate-fat diets,\u201d per the news release. \u201cParticipants also had higher levels of lutein, an antioxidant, after the avocado diet.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the researchers determined that avocados may be able to lower oxidized LDL particles. Oxidation can negatively affect the human body.\n\n\"When you think about bad cholesterol, it comes packaged in LDL particles, which vary in size. All LDL is bad, but small, dense LDL is particularly bad. A key finding was that people on the avocado diet had fewer oxidized LDL particles. They also had more lutein, which may be the bioactive that's protecting the LDL from being oxidized,\u201d said Penny Kris-Etherton, distinguished professor of nutrition, in a statement.\n\n\"A lot of research points to oxidation being the basis for conditions like cancer and heart disease,\" Kris-Etherton added. \"We know that when LDL particles become oxidized, that starts a chain reaction that can promote atherosclerosis, which is the build-up of plaque in the artery wall. Oxidation is not good, so if you can help protect the body through the foods that you eat, that could be very beneficial.\"\n\nGIRL, 5, RECEIVES 36 STITCHES AFTER DOG 'RIPPED OFF' HER FACE, MOM SAYS\n\nThat said, Kris-Etherton did note that more research is needed to understand the more nuanced health benefits of avocados, which are already known to be full of important nutrients \u2013 such as vitamin K and potassium \u2013 as well as fiber, heart-healthy fatty acids and antioxidants.\n\n\"They are such a nutrient-dense package, and I think we're just beginning to learn about how they can improve health,\" she added.", "description": "The study suggests that eating one avocado a day can lower levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), the type of cholesterol considered to be \u201cbad.\u201d", "authors": ["Madeline Farber", "Madeline Farber Is A Reporter For Fox News.
