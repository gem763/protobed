It sparked a night of fighting in the area.\n\nVideos emerged on social media of purported gang members taking to the streets with machine guns and grenade launchers. Children crouched next to cars and asked their parents why people were shooting.\n\nThe war-like battle left 16 people injured. At least 51 inmates escaped from Aguaruto Penitentiary in Culiac\u00e1n. Two were captured.\n\nMexico's defense minister Luis Sandoval confirmed that soldiers arrested Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez - one of several sons who have taken control of the Sinaloa cartel since their father was extradited to the U.S. - but released him after being overpowered by cartel gunmen Thursday, in what he admitted was a 'badly planned' operation.\n\n'It was a badly planned strategy,' Sandoval told a news conference in Culiac\u00e1n on Friday, where he and other members of President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador's security cabinet held an emergency meeting.\n\n'The task force acted too hastily. (The operation) wasn't improvised, there was planning, but... it takes time to obtain an arrest warrant. When the operation was already under way, they decided to improvise and attempt to' get a warrant and arrest Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez, he said.\n\nHe added that Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez was never 'formally detained'.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nPresident Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador (left) said on Friday the decision to release Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez (right) was made to protect civilian lives and prevent bloodshed\n\nA purported cartel fighter carrying a grenade launcher to take with him to fight the army in Culiac\u00e1n on Thursday after violence erupted over the arrest of El Chapo's son\n\nVideos emerged on social media of purported gang members taking to the streets with machine guns and grenade launchers\n\nVehicles are seen ablaze during a clash between armed gunmen and federal police and military soldiers, in the streets of the of Culiac\u00e1n, Sinaloa\n\nHeavily armed gunmen in four-by-four trucks fought an intense battle against Mexican security forces - a truck burns above\n\nA common tactic for the cartel is to set cars on fire at the end of roads to block the military from closing in on them\n\nThe official death toll is two but photographs taken on the ground on Thursday indicate that it is much higher.

The situation turned very difficult and many citizens' lives were at risk, many human beings.\n\n'Catching a criminal can't be worth more than people's lives,' added the leftist leader.\n\n'This decision was made to protect the people. You can't fight fire with fire.\n\n'We do not want dead people. We do not want war. That is hard for many to understand.\n\n'We have to confront two mafias, white collar crime \u2026 we're already battling it, and the delinquent gangs called organized [crime].\n\n'The decision was made by the security cabinet. I supported that decision because I considered that the protection of the people was more important.\n\n'It was more important that there weren't any deaths. What is more important is that there is peace.'\n\nA young girl crouches next to her family car asking her father why people were shooting on Thursday\n\nA cartel sniper lies on the ground in the street in Culiac\u00e1n to take on the military\n\nMilitary and civilians are shown at a check point.
