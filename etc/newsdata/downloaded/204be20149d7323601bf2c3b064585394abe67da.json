The dish that he and Angela Dimayuga, his executive chef, came up with is not Chinese in the least. Nor does it owe anything to Caesar save for a tin of anchovies.

You could serve this recipe alongside a teriyaki-glazed laptop case and receive plaudits for the meal. Don't have one of the ingredients?
