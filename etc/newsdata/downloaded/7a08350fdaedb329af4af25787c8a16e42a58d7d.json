Kerr said he wanted to learn more about the situation before commenting. Popovich recognised the situation as complicated and complimented Commissioner Adam Silver on his handling of the issue.\n\nKerr and Popovich have both been vocal critics of Trump and outspoken on issues like social injustice.\n\nTrump on Wednesday said Kerr looked like \"a little boy\" while declining to discuss the incident in China. Trump said Kerr was \"shaking.\"\n\n\"I watch this guy Steve Kerr, and he was like a little boy. He was so scared to even be answering the question,\" Trump said. \"He couldn't answer the question. He was shaking ... And yet he'll talk about the United States very badly.\n\n\"I watched Popovich, sort of the same thing, but he didn't look quite as scared, actually.\n\n\"But they talk badly about the United States, but when the talk's about China, they don't wanna say anything bad. I thought it was pretty sad, actually.\"\n\nThe NBA has found itself in hot water in China in the aftermath of Morey's tweet. Though the NBA called Morey's tweet \"regrettable\" and recognised it offended some Chinese citizens, the league did not apologise for Morey's tweet. Silver backed Morey's freedom of speech, saying the NBA won't regulate what its members say.\n\nIn the aftermath, numerous Chinese companies have suspended operations with the Rockets and NBA, while two NBA preseason games slated to take place in China could be in danger of being canceled. Chinese state network CCTV has said it won't broadcast the games.\n\nCurry was speaking to reporters at the Warriors practice and said he would \"welcome Steve to the club\" of being criticised by Trump. Curry and the Warriors declined to visit the White House after winning the 2017 championship, leading Trump to disinvite them.\n\nSteph Curry: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Just heard about the Trump thing.
