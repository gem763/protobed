Erdogan referred to the genocide as \u201creasonable\u201d in a speech in April.\n\nAccording to the independent Turkish exile outlet Ahval, Erdogan said Turkey did not \u201crecognize\u201d the House bill in remarks Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThis step taken has no value. And we do not recognise it. We see such an accusation as the greatest insult made to our nation,\u201d Erdogan reportedly said, describing America as \u201ca country whose history is filled with stains of genocide, slavery and exploitation,\u201d without elaborating.\n\nAgence France-Presse (AFP) translated Erdogan\u2019s remark as dismissing the bill as \u201cworthless.\u201d\n\nErdogan\u2019s remarks on the United States echoed a statement from Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) explaining why she did not vote in favor of the bill Tuesday.\n\n\u201cA true acknowledgment of historical crimes against humanity must include \u2026 earlier mass slaughters like the transatlantic slave trade and Native American genocide, which took the lives of hundreds of millions of indigenous people in this country,\u201d Omar said.\n\nOmar was one of three lawmakers to vote \u201cpresent,\u201d along with Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ) and Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-TX).\n\nSeveral prominent Republicans voted against the bill, including Reps. Mac Thornberry (R-TX), Mark Meadows (R-NC), Greg Pence (R-IN), and Mike Rogers (R-AL).\n\nNo Democrats voted against the bill.\n\nThe bill passed with 405 yea votes that also included prominent Republicans like Reps. Dan Crenshaw (R-TX), Mario D\u00edaz-Balart (R-FL), Matt Gaetz (R-FL), Steve Scalise (R-LA) and Louie Gohmert (R-TX). Unlike Omar, fellow members of the far-left \u201cSquad\u201d of newly elected Democratic Congresswomen \u2013 Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Ayanna Pressley (D-MA), and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) \u2013 voted in favor of the bill.\n\nThe House resolution officially recognizes the Armenian Genocide, which America has not done, and urges the use of government education programs to spread awareness of the atrocities committed against the Armenian people by Turkey in the early 20th century.\n\nThe House passed the bill on Turkey\u2019s national day, October 29.\n\nAs the Senate is not currently discussing any similar legislation, it is not clear if Congress will ever turn the resolution into law.\n\nIn addition to Erdogan\u2019s comments, the Turkish government formerly summoned U.S. Ambassador to Ankara David Satterfield on Wednesday to protest the bill. The Turkish Foreign Ministry explained in a statement that it rejected the bill as \u201cdevoid of any historical or legal basis,\u201d despite the fact that few outside of the Turkish government have questioned the legitimacy of the genocide.\n\nThe foreign ministry alleged that the Armenian genocide bill was \u201cvengeance\u201d for Turkey\u2019s invasion of northern Syria, which Ankara dubbed \u201cOperation Peace Spring.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose who felt defeated for not being able to forestall Operation Peace Spring would be highly mistaken should they think they could take vengeance this way,\u201d the foreign ministry said, declaring the bill \u201cnull and void.\u201d\n\nForeign Minister Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu also used the word \u201cvengeance\u201d to describe the bill.\n\nThe bill received a much warmer welcome in the United States, notably from celebrities in support of both acknowledging the genocide and curbing the growing threat of Erdogan\u2019s Islamist government.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. just recognized the Armenian genocide!!\u201d Armenian-American celebrity Kim Kardashian, who has used her fame for decades to advocate for recognition of the destruction of her people, celebrated on Twitter.\n\nWOW LOOK AT THESE INCREDIBLE NUMBERS!!! THE U.S. JUST RECOGNIZED THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE!!!! \ud83c\uddf2\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\u2728 pic.twitter.com/rEwPbZp5m0 \u2014 Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) October 30, 2019\n\nTurkish NBA star Enes Kanter, who has been encouraging Congress to act against Erdogan, celebrated the bill but specifically condemned Omar for not voting in favor of it, accusing the freshman lawmaker of being \u201con dictator Erdogan\u2019s payroll.\u201d Kanter, a follower of Islamic cleric Fethullah G\u00fclen, has faced significant retribution from Erdogan\u2019s government for accusing it of human rights abuses against dissidents, including the imprisonment of his father of charges of \u201cterrorism.\u201d The Turkish government considers following Kanter on Twitter evidence of being a terrorist.\n\nArmenians at home also celebrated the passing of the bill. Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan called it a \u201cbold step towards serving truth and historical justice that also offers comfort to millions of descendants of the Armenian Genocide survivors.\u201d\n\nArmenians speaking to AFP also applauded the move, hoping it will galvanize support for the Armenian community\u2019s quest for recognition elsewhere.\n\n\u201cMembers of my own family were among those murdered, and my parents fled with my grandparents to America,\u201d said Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-CA), of both Assyrian and Armenian descent, said following the bill. \u201cWhat all of the persecuted had in common was that they were Christians.\u201d\n\nThe government that would become the Republic of Turkey organized the systematic murder, exile, and extermination of Christians from Turkish lands spanning 1914 to 1923, targeting Armenian, Assyrian, and Greek Christians living in what would become Turkish territory. Historians believe the Turks killed 1.5 million Armenians, or over 75 percent of the population. Many were killed in death camps or tortured to death, then photographed as trophies:\n\nTurkish inhumanity towards the Armenians was limitless. Young girls were raped or crucified. Forced marches, in endless circles over mountain trails, of the very old and very young\u2014denied food and water\u2014sought but one final destination: death. As an ultimate slap in the face, Armenians transported by train to death camps were even required to purchase their own tickets.\n\nSome in the Turkish government dispute the killings despite extensive documentary evidence tying Turkish government officials to the genocide. Others accept the killings, but claim they are the product of war and that Turkish soldiers also died in the genocide, rejecting the claim that they attempted to exterminate any religion or ethnicity. Still other Turkish \u201cexperts\u201d claim the Armenians attempted to exterminate themselves to smear the Turkish people.\n\nThe Turkish government has never provided accepted proof of its claim.\n\n\u201cThe relocation of the Armenian gangs and their supporters, who massacred the Muslim people, including women and children, in eastern Anatolia, was the most reasonable action that could be taken in such a period,\u201d Erdogan said in April. \u201cThe doors of our archives are wide open to all seeking the truth.\u201d\n\nIn response to concerns that \u201cOperation Peace Spring\u201d is an attempt to ethnically cleanse Kurds from northern Syria, Erdogan also denied the Armenian genocide.\n\n\u201cTurkey has never committed any civilian massacre in its history and it never will. Our religion and culture would never allow to do it,\u201d Erdogan alleged this month.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "Turkish President Erdogan condemned the House for passing a bill recognizing the Armenian Genocide, calling the bill \"worthless.\"", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/07/GettyImages-1155803502-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
