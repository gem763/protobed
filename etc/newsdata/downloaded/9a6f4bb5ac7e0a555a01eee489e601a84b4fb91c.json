Raising the bar for discussion-worthy It-bags, the French brand's Meteor design has so many holes that it cannot be used to carry anything.\n\nIntroduced at the label's Paris catwalk show this week, the bag is created to look as if meteors have punched through its leather, and while you can put your hands through and carry as a clutch, any belongings - be it a credit card, phone or lipstick - would instantly fall out. Off-White is under no illusions about the style's practicality; in fact the brand describes it as \"unfunctional\".\n\nPhoto credit: Richard Bord - Getty Images More\n\nPhoto credit: Victor VIRGILE - Getty Images More\n\nBefore you question whether the Meteor can be branded as a bag at all, given the fact that it serves no practical purpose, Off-White says that the design is more of a piece of art that challenges \"the concept of a bag itself, one of the most common objects in our everyday lives\". For anyone wondering, the bag retails at $1,665 (about \u00a31,400).\n\nReactions on social media have been varied. Some say it looks like Swiss cheese, while others have suggested that it has a deeper meaning, \"reflecting the era of rich women who shows their wealth by not needing anything in their bag\".\n\nOff-White's creative director Virgil Abloh was noticeably absent from the label's latest show in Paris this week having been signed off work. \"The doctor told me 'this pace that you\u2019ve sort of pushed your body\u2013to fly all these miles, do all these different projects\u2013is not good for your health,\u2019\u201d the designer said earlier this month.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "The hole-covered bag mean that it can't be used to carry anything", "authors": ["Ella Alexander"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/UT9cGHGDCKfnqtNWNfqYYg--~B/aD03MjM7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/harper_s_bazaar_111/cc5a10733bde431e6ca0df295bda9d10", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
