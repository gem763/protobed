But the United States is first in line to take action since its case is running about 9 months ahead.\n\nWashington has sought permission to target European aircraft and aerospace parts, as well a range of industries including food, wine, tractors and luxury goods, as part of an $11.2 billion package of proposed tariffs against the European Union.\n\nThe final amount will depend on WTO arbitrators and Washington must then choose from a list of goods totaling more than $20 billion that it has identified as potential targets, before putting tariffs into effect up to the authorized limit.\n\nShares in Airbus, which relies on a flow of parts to feed an assembly line in Alabama, and which also counts U.S. airlines among its major customers for aircraft assembled at its main plants in Europe, fell 3.2% in early trading.\n\nLuxury goods group LVMH (PA: ) fell more than 2%. The two major exporters were the biggest fallers on the Paris CAC 40 ( ), which was down 0.7%.\n\nHermes International (PA: ) fell 1.5%.", "description": "Airbus, French exporters slip as U.S. tariffs loom in subsidy row", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8F0IJ_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
