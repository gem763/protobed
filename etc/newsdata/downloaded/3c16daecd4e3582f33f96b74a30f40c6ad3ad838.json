Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), on Wednesday, arguing that the country is \u201cnot electing a planner.\u201d\n\nWhile the top-tier candidates in the Democrat primary field have largely refrained from taking deep digs at one another, Biden signaled that he may switch strategies.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not electing a planner,\u201d Biden said in New Hampshire on Wednesday, in an apparent reference to Warren. \u201cI\u2019ve been there. I know what it takes to get it done.\u201d\n\nWarren has made \u201cI have a plan for that\u201d a catchphrase of her campaign, claiming to have solutions for virtually every major problem the country faces and outlining those broad plans in a series of Medium posts over the course of her campaign. Most of Warren\u2019s plans contain a common thread, incorporating aspects from additional proposals within her political arsenal.\n\nWarren has unveiled a $3 trillion climate change proposal inspired by former presidential candidate and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D), a plan focused entirely on \u201chonoring and empowering tribal nations and Indigenous peoples,\u201d and a proposal to \u201cend corruption in Washington.\u201d\n\nIn August, Warren released her comprehensive criminal justice reform plan, which emphasized protections for \u201cspecial populations\u201d \u2014 such as LGBT individuals \u2014 and called for the elimination of private prisons.\n\nIn September, Warren added to her ultra-progressive agenda, promising to raise Social Security benefits by $200 per month. She said she would pay for it by taxing the \u201cwealthy\u201d \u2014 specifically, by increasing the Social Security contribution requirement to 14.8 percent for individuals making $250,000 per year, and splitting the 14.8 percent \u201cequally between employees and employers at 7.4 percent each.\u201d\n\nMost recently, Warren released a plan to address \u201cenvironmental injustice\u201d and \u201cenvironmental racism\u201d across the country.\n\nBiden\u2019s jab comes after weeks of a slow, steady surge in Warren\u2019s favor, besting Biden in a variety of recent polls and overtaking him in the RealClearPolitics average for the first time this week.\n\nA poll from The Economist/YouGov showed Warren topping the field with 29 percent to Biden\u2019s 25 percent \u2014 a lead which remains outside of the +/- 2.9 percent margin of error:\n\n#National @YouGovUS/@TheEconomist Poll (RV, 10/6-8):\n\nWarren 29%\n\nBiden 25%\n\nSanders 14%\n\nHarris 5%\n\nButtigieg 5%\n\nYang 3%\n\nBullock 2%\n\nKlobuchar 1%\n\nO'Rourke 1%\n\nGabbard 1%\n\nCastro 1%\n\nBooker 1%\n\nDelaney 1%\n\nSteyer 1%\n\nRyan 0%\n\nWilliamson 0%\n\nBennet 0%\n\nMessam 0%\n\nSestak 0https://t.co/5MbdsaCOiJ \u2014 Political Polls (@Politics_Polls) October 10, 2019\n\nThe two candidates will face off next week alongside ten other contenders at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio.", "description": "Joe Biden (D) took a direct shot at Sen.
