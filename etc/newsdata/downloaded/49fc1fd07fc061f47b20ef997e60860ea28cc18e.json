Just a quick note to say that Miley and I have recently separated and I wish her nothing but health and happiness going forward.\n\n\"This is a private matter and I have not made, nor will I be making, any comments to any journalists or media outlets. Any reported quotes attributed to me are false. Peace and Love.\"\n\nBut it didn't take long for Miley to move on after being pictured getting cosy with Kaitlynn, who was previously married to Brody Jenner, on a yacht in August.\n\nDespite the internet going crazy for Miley' and Kaitlynn, the saucy snaps appeared to be a deal breaker for ex Liam (sob!).\n\nPhoto credit: Instagram/Kaitlynn Carter More\n\nE! reported that the photos of Kaitlynn and Miley kissing pushed him to make the move for divorce.\n\n\u201cEven though Miley and Liam were separated for a while before she was photographed making out on the yacht with Kaitlynn, once Liam saw those photos, he decided it was time to file for divorce,\u201d a source says. \u201cThat was it for him, seeing those photos and then all the Soho House stories thereafter.\u201d\n\nWe're sure Miley will be able to make an entire collection of albums with this drama.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "Get ready for some serious heartbreak anthems.", "authors": ["Rebecca Calderwood"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/uvBpb.lBJSQumBKjVfHZIQ--~B/aD0xNDQwO3c9Mjg3NTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cosmo_633/877be80d3cb1e7f91f7a860e159d478e", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
