They\u2019ll be in situations one day, and when a girl says no, both to him and to her, she means no,\u201d reports the New York Daily News.\n\nWhen the actress was a preteen her mother\u2019s boyfriend came into her room one night and started touching her breasts, the Black Panther star recalled. \u201cFortunately, it wasn\u2019t a complete assault, it was fondling, but it was devastating enough for a child who\u2019s 12 or 13.\n\n\u201cAnd thankfully, to have a mother who could tell as soon as light broke that this happened and for her to expel him . . . That she heard me, believed me and did something about it was so empowering for me as a young teen, as a young woman,\u201d she told The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nHer mother\u2019s example is the reason she\u2019s teaching her own children to be respectful to others. The actress has teen twins, Bronwyn and Slater, with husband Courtney B Vance, Essence reports.\n\n\u201cI wish we didn\u2019t live in a world where sexual assault existed,\u201d she said at the event, reports E! News. \"I wish they weren\u2019t victims of such a heinous, life-altering crime. I wish we lived in a world where our children felt effortlessly protected, without any fear of someone violating or hurting them. But sadly, that is not our reality. And with that, thank God for sanctuaries like The Rape Treatment Centre and Stuart House.\u201d", "description": "American actress Angela Bassett shared her experience of being sexually violated at the age of 12 by her mother\u2019s boyfriend.", "authors": ["Nkosazana Ngwadla"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9460/3cc9c5b94ed84b86b787fa6ebb795978.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
