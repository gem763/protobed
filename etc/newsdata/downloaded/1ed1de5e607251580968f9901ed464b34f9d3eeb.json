As he packs a can of fuel, he lures Nate and Moria onto a fishing boat and soon it becomes clear that Cain\u2019s ruse of a nice day out is nothing more than a cover for some serious, murderous intent.\n\nJeff Hordley told Metro.co.uk: \u2018Nate is younger, fitter, stronger, taller but they are fairly equally matched as Cain is very fired up \u2013 he finds this inner strength to exact his anger and his frustrations certainly come out. I can say that trouble on the boat certainly happens and Moira gets caught up in it too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Jurell and I did the whole fight sequence in the end, which was great. As did the stunt doubles. But I think the director will take different shots from each to tell the story using some of us and some shots of them. I know Jurell was really keen to do the fight, as I was. But the most important thing is you have to listen to the director and stunt coordinator who ultimately decide what we can do. We did in fact do the whole sequence and it was great fun to do. Jurell is such fun to work with. He\u2019s got a great professional attitude towards work and he is an absolute joy.\u2019\n\nJurell added: \u2018Nate eventually snaps and tells Cain straight up, I\u2019ve slept with your wife and goes in to detail. It\u2019s very twisted, very explosive. Nate is a big guy. Cain is very strong as well, which everyone knows, they know his reputation but Nate can hold his own. He\u2019s physically big plus he\u2019s mentally a strong character and very streetwise. He\u2019s a great match for Cain and those two coming to a head, it\u2019s going to be a great watch.\n\n\u2018Shooting it was amazing. I love shooting at the studio and the village, but shooting on a beautiful lake with all the scenery, it was just amazing. It felt like we were shooting a different type of drama. I loved doing the stunts.\n\n\u2018Jeff and I are not small people and doing so many movements on such a small boat (through the fighting), Jeff fell in the water in one scene. But he soldiered on like it didn\u2019t even happen! My stunt double was a really nice guy, he coached me to make me feel comfortable so it was all believable. These stunt guys have huge experience, even having a bit of their knowledge was great.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "But who will live and who will die?", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/22_10_emm_nate_cain_moira_08-e8e4_1570988544.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
