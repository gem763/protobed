Once they left, he filed a police report with the Blackwell Police Department, which confirmed to NBC that an investigation is happening.\n\nDespite alleged threats he\u2019s received to drop the investigation, Mr. Comrie said he wants to see justice for what happened to him and his partner.\n\n\u201cI love the pastors with all my heart, but what they did was totally wrong. I want some kind of consequences out of it,\u201d he told KFOR-TV. \u201cI want it to be heard and known because it really saddens my heart.\u201d\n\nMr. McKissick and his wife Tami, who also serves as a pastor at the church, reportedly said in a Facebook statement their church is \u201ccomprised of people from all different backgrounds.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn response to allegations that have been made, this incident began as a family matter that escalated. Our church would never condone restraint of any person unless they were engaged in violent activity,\u201d they wrote, according to NBC News.\n\n\u201cThere is much more to this story, and we are cooperating fully with law enforcement to bring all of the facts to light as a rush to judgment is not in anyone\u2019s best interest.\u201d\n\nThe statement and the church\u2019s Facebook page appear to have since been deleted. Calls to the church office went unanswered as well.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
