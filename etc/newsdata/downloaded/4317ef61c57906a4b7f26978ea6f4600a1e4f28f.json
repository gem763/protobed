The prize comes as Abiy faces pressure to uphold the sweeping freedoms he introduced, and critics warn that his ability to deal with rising domestic unrest may be slipping.\n\nThe Nobel committee some people may consider it too early to give him the prize, but \u201cit is now that Abiy Ahmed\u2019s efforts need recognition and deserve encouragement.\u201d\n\nThe award reflects the committee\u2019s taste for trying to encourage works in progress.\n\n\u201cWe are proud as a nation!!!\u201d Abiy\u2019s office said in a tweet.\n\nBREAKING NEWS:\n\nThe Norwegian Nobel Committee has decided to award the Nobel Peace Prize for 2019 to Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed Ali.#NobelPrize #NobelPeacePrize pic.twitter.com/uGRpZJHk1B \u2014 The Nobel Prize (@NobelPrize) October 11, 2019\n\nNobel Institute director Olav Njoelstad, said he had been in touch by phone with Abiy, who \u201cshowed great humility and was overwhelmed.\u201d\n\nAbiy, 43, took office after widespread protests pressured the longtime ruling coalition and hurt one of the world\u2019s fastest growing economies. Africa\u2019s youngest leader quickly announced dramatic reforms and \u201cAbiymania\u201d began.\n\nOn taking office, Abiy surprised people by fully accepting a peace deal ending a 20-year border war between the two East African nations that saw tens of thousands of people killed. Ethiopia and Eritrea had not had diplomatic ties since the war began in 1998, with Abiy himself once fighting in a town that remained contested at the time of his announcement last year.\n\nWithin weeks, the visibly moved Eritrean president, Isaias Afwerki, visited Addis Ababa and communications and transport links were restored. For the first time in two decades, long-divided families made tearful reunions.\n\nThe improving relations led to the lifting of United Nations sanctions on Eritrea, one of the world\u2019s most reclusive nations. But Ethiopia\u2019s reforms do not appear to have inspired any in Eritrea, which has since closed border posts with its neighbor.\n\nThe Nobel committee also pointed to Abiy\u2019s other efforts toward reconciliation in the region \u2014 between Eritrea and Djibouti, between Kenya and Somalia, and in Sudan.\n\nThe Nobel committee acknowledged that \u201cpeace does not arise from the actions of one party alone.\u201d\n\nIt said that when Abiy \u201creached out his hand, President Afwerki grasped it, and helped to formalize the peace process between the two countries.\u201d\n\nIt added that it \u201chopes the peace agreement will help to bring about positive change for the entire populations of Ethiopia and Eritrea.\u201d\n\nThere was no immediate comment on the award from Eritrea, which under its longtime ruler remains one of the world\u2019s most closed-off nations.\n\nAt home, Abiy offered one political surprise after another. He released tens of thousands of prisoners, welcomed home once-banned opposition groups and acknowledged past abuses. People expressed themselves freely on social media, and he announced that Ethiopia would hold free and fair elections in 2020. The country has one of the world\u2019s few \u201cgender-balanced\u201d Cabinets and a female president, a rarity in Africa.\n\nAnd for the first time Ethiopia had no journalists in prison, media groups noted last year.\n\nThe new prime minister also announced the opening-up of Ethiopia\u2019s tightly controlled economy, saying private investment would be welcome in major state-owned sectors \u2014 a process that continues slowly.\n\nBut while Abiy became a global darling, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, troubles arose at home.\n\nA grenade was thrown at him during an appearance in the capital. A large group of soldiers confronted him in his office in what he called an attempt to derail his reforms. In a display of the brio that has won Abiy widespread admiration, the former military officer defused the situation by dropping to the floor and joining the troops in pushups.\n\nMore troubling these days are Ethiopia\u2019s rising ethnic tensions, as people once stifled by repression now act on long-held grievances. Some 1,200 people have been killed and some 1.2 million displaced in the greatest challenge yet to Abiy\u2019s rule. Some observers warn that the unrest will grow ahead of next year\u2019s election.\n\nThe Nobel committee acknowledged that \u201cmany challenges remain unresolved.\u201d\n\nAbiy had been among the favorites for this year\u2019s prize in the run-up to Friday\u2019s announcement, though winners are notoriously hard to predict. The Nobel committee doesn\u2019t reveal the names of candidates or nominations for 50 years.\n\nThe committee has in the past used its prestigious award to nudge a peace process forward and Friday\u2019s recognition of Abiy falls into that line of thinking.\n\n\u201cThe committee want to be actors. They want to make decisive interventions because the world listens to their opinion, Nobel historian Oeivind Stenersen said. \u201cThere have been laureates such as (Jose Ramos) Horta in East Timor who have said that the prize was crucial in the process. The committee will hope to emulate that.\u201d\n\nSince 1901, 99 Nobel Peace Prizes have been handed out, to individuals and 24 organizations. While the other prizes are announced in Stockholm, the peace prize is awarded in the Norwegian capital, Oslo.\n\nSo far this week, 11 Nobel laureates have been named. The others received their awards for their achievements in medicine, physics, chemistry and literature.\n\nWith the glory comes a 9-million kronor ($918,000) cash award, a gold medal and a diploma. Even though the peace prize is awarded in Norway, the amount is denominated in Swedish kronor.", "description": "The Norwegian Nobel Institute also praised the \u201cimportant reforms\u201d that Ethiopia\u2019s prime minister has launched at home.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da0471b20000058074fff0b.jpeg?cache=im1nprggo2&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
