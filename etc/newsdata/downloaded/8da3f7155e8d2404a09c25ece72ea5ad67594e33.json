Last week, our colleagues scooped that Byard\u2019s nomination was in trouble because of personal issues. The president nominated Byard May 13. The White House did not have a comment by press time.\n\nA DOCUMENT -- scooped by the Daily Caller\u2019s Amber Athey -- has been floating around, detailing a White House proposal on gun legislation. The Atlantic\u2019s ELAINA PLOTT got this amazing comment from the White House\u2019s Hogan Gidley: \u201cAn update from the White House: Hogan Gidley tells me that just because WH legislative director Eric Ueland is among those pushing this on the Hill, it does NOT mean Trump himself has signed off on it. \u2018Not even close.\u2019\u201d Elaina\u2019s tweet\n\n-- SO, READ THAT AGAIN: The White House leg affairs director is socializing a plan that is \u201cnot even close\u201d to having the president\u2019s backing.\n\n-- MARIANNE LEVINE and BURGESS EVERETT: \u201cWhite House circulates gun background check proposal to lawmakers\u201d\n\nBIG NEWS FROM THE PRESIDENT\u2019S TWITTER FEED THIS A.M. ...\n\n-- MORE IRAN SANCTIONS \u2026 @realDonald Trump at 8:53 a.m.: \u201cI have just instructed the Secretary of the Treasury to substantially increase Sanctions on the country of Iran!\u201d\n\n-- NAMING A NEW NSA \u2026 at 9:23 a.m.: \u201cI am pleased to announce that I will name Robert C. O\u2019Brien, currently serving as the very successful Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs at the State Department, as our new National Security Advisor. I have worked long & hard with Robert. He will do a great job!\u201d More from Caitlin Oprysko\n\nTHE VIEW FROM IRAN -- WAPO\u2019S PAUL SCHEMM in Dubai: \u201cIran warns U.S. of \u2018broad\u2019 retaliation in case of any attack\u201d: \u201cIran warned the United States that it would broadly retaliate against any attacks in the wake of crippling strikes on the Saudi oil industry over the weekend, Iranian news agencies reported Wednesday. The message, which was sent via the Swiss Embassy in Tehran that handles U.S. affairs in the country, condemned remarks by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other officials linking Iran with the attacks on a Saudi oil field and processing facility.\n\n\u201c\u2018Iran\u2019s response will be prompt and strong, and it may include broader areas than the source of attacks,\u2019 the Mehr News Agency reported the official note as saying. Iran\u2019s Fars News Agency said any response would be \u2018rapid and crushing\u2019 and target \u2018more extensive areas than the origin of the attack.\u2019 There have long been fears that Iranian proxy forces in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and elsewhere might attack U.S. forces in the region.\u201d WaPo\n\nNEWS from BARAK RAVID of Channel 13/Axios: BIBI NETANYAHU is not coming to New York for the U.N. General Assembly because of the political situation.\n\n-- STATE OF PLAY: Netanyahu is not conceding defeat in Tuesday\u2019s election. Just now, he announced via Twitter (in Hebrew) that he is consolidating a bloc of right-wing parties under his leadership. Rough translation: \u201cNow that we have established the right-wing bloc, there are only two options: either a government led by me, or a dangerous government that relies on the Arab parties. At this time, more than ever, a government that relies on the anti-Zionist Arab parties must not be established.\u201d\n\nGood Wednesday afternoon.

I'm very, very close to announcing my decision on the U.S. Senate race,\u2019 [Corey] Lewandowski told the hosts of \u2018Fox & Friends.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018This is the number one rated television show in America right now, and if I was going to do it, I promise you I would do it on this show,\u2019 he said. \u2018But the truth is, I\u2019ve got to spend a little more time with my family.\u2019\u201d POLITICO\n\nPAGING MIKE POMPEO \u2026 \u201cRepublican Kobach Trails Democrat Grissom by 10 Points in Kansas Senate Race, Internal Poll Shows,\u201d by WSJ\u2019s Lindsay Wise: \u201cFormer Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach trails Democrat Barry Grissom by 10 percentage points in a head-to-head matchup for Kansas' open Senate seat in 2020, according to internal GOP polling data reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.\n\n\u201cThe previously unpublished findings reveal why some Republicans are deeply concerned that a Kobach candidacy could cost the party a Senate seat in Kansas\u2014and why Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has been pushing so hard for Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, a former congressman from Wichita, to challenge Mr. Kobach for the GOP nomination.\u201d WSJ\n\nPlaybook PM Sign up for our must-read newsletter on what's driving the afternoon in Washington.

On her first day of orientation, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez joined protesters camped outside Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s office agitating for the Green New Deal.\n\n\u201c\u2018It could have made people mad, they could have put me on the dog walking committee,\u2019 she joked later that week on a Justice Democrats conference call promoting the organization\u2019s candidate recruitment campaign. \u2018They still might.\u2019\n\n\u201cMs. Ocasio-Cortez may have meant it as an offhand quip, but her comment underscored a reality on Capitol Hill that she and her team were slow to fully appreciate: the extent to which power and the ability to get things done in the House were dependent on personal relationships and respect for the hierarchy.\n\n\u201cThe first-term congresswoman enjoys rich public support outside the halls of Congress, particularly on the social media platforms where progressive activism thrives. But the approach that she and her cohorts champion \u2014 pulling the institution to the left in part by threatening the careers of any Democrat who fail to embrace their ideas \u2014 quickly alienated many of her colleagues, and has made it difficult for her to get anything done.\u201d NYT\n\nL.A. TIMES: \u201cDemocratic donor Ed Buck charged with operating drug house after 2 men found dead in home\u201d: \u201cProminent Democratic donor and LGBTQ political activist Ed Buck was arrested Tuesday and charged with operating a drug house, with prosecutors calling him a violent sexual predator who preys on men struggling with addiction and homelessness. \u2026\n\n\u201cBuck was charged with one count each of battery causing serious injury, administering methamphetamine and maintaining a drug house, according to the Los Angeles County district attorney\u2019s office. Buck is accused of injecting a 37-year-old man, who overdosed but survived, with methamphetamine on Sept. 11.\n\n\u201cThat latest incident comes after two men were found dead in his Laurel Avenue apartment in West Hollywood. In both cases, African American men \u2014 Gemmel Moore, 26, and Timothy Dean, 55 \u2014 had overdosed on methamphetamine inside. After the first death in 2017, authorities said there was insufficient evidence to file charges.\u201d LAT\n\nIMMIGRATION FILES -- \u201cAlong Texas border, Trump administration sets up tent courts for virtual asylum hearings,\u201d by WaPo\u2019s Nick Miroff in Laredo, Texas: \u201cThe acting heads of the nation\u2019s immigration agencies arrived here Tuesday to visit a makeshift courthouse, built from tents and shipping containers, where the administration will apply the experimental and legally tenuous border policy known as the Migration Protection Protocols.\n\n\u201cThe visit underscored the improvisational enforcement approach that Homeland Security officials have taken to drive down border crossings in the absence of a bipartisan immigration overhaul in Washington. The administration has budgeted up to $155 million to operate five temporary MPP courts along the length of the border, with the overarching goal of replacing the asylum processing model that President Trump has disparaged as \u2018catch and release.\u2019\u201d WaPo\n\n2020 WATCH -- \u201c\u2018The ground is shifting\u2019: Arizona emerges as a 2020 trouble spot for Trump,\u201d by Marc Caputo: \u201cDemographic shifts, progressive organizing efforts and President Donald Trump\u2019s potential weakness in the state appear to be providing Democrats in 2020 with their best shot at capturing the state since Bill Clinton won it more than two decades ago.\n\n\u201cA new poll, commissioned by a state labor union and released today, shows Trump running neck-and-neck with Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden in theoretical match-ups. That poll follows several other recent surveys with more bad news for Republicans. A late July survey \u2014 conducted by Trump\u2019s own pollster \u2014 showed the president losing to Biden, and another in August reported a tie. In Arizona\u2019s closely-watched 2020 U.S. Senate race, two of those polls show GOP Sen. Martha McSally in a tie and a third shows her trailing Democrat Mark Kelly.\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- \u201cA Former Obama Campaign Staffer Is Launching A Rematch Against Democratic Rep. Carolyn Maloney,\u201d by BuzzFeed\u2019s Kadia Goba: \u201cSuraj Patel is officially throwing his hat in the race to unseat Rep. Carolyn Maloney, in what promises to be a closely-watched rematch for a New York City congressional seat. Last cycle, Patel launched a competitive campaign against Maloney, who has served for more than 25 years in the House of Representatives.\u201d BuzzFeed \u2026 Announcement video\n\nTHE POLICY PRIMARY -- \u201cBernie Sanders Touts Immigration Plans, but His Record Is Complicated,\u201d by WSJ\u2019s Eliza Collins and Joshua Jamerson: \u201cOver the weekend, Mr. Sanders became the first 2020 Democratic candidate to call for a temporary halt to deporting people who are in the country illegally, a position that is supported by many immigration activists but that almost no politicians have embraced. \u2026\n\n\u201cMr. Sanders\u2019s current perch among the most immigration-friendly 2020 candidates differs sharply from his situation in his previous presidential bid. At the time, the Vermont lawmaker was forced to defend comments in which he described some forms of legal immigration as detrimental to American jobs, a sentiment echoed by President Trump as well as many labor unions.\u201d WSJ\n\nMEGATREND -- \u201cThe U.S. abortion rate falls to lowest level since Roe v. Wade,\u201d by WaPo\u2019s Ariana Eunjung Cha: \u201cThere appears to be no clear pattern between efforts to ban or restrict abortion and the continuing decline in abortion rates, which has been going on for nearly 40 years. The declines were seen across regions and in states that are more supportive of abortion rights as well as those that are more restrictive. \u2026\n\n\u201cThe report estimated the abortion rate in 2017, the most recent year studied, at 13.5 per 1,000 women ages 15 to 44. That compares with 14.6 in 2014 and 16.9 in 2011 and is the lowest rate since the U.S. Supreme Court legalized abortion through the landmark decision Roe v. Wade in 1973. In total, 862,320 abortions took place in 2017 at health-care facilities.\u201d WaPo\n\nBEYOND THE BELTWAY -- \u201cNew Mexico Announces Plan for Free College for State Residents,\u201d by NYT\u2019s Simon Romero and Dana Goldstein in Albuquerque: \u201cIn one of the boldest state-led efforts to expand access to higher education, New Mexico is unveiling a plan on Wednesday to make tuition at its public colleges and universities free for all state residents, regardless of family income.\n\n\u201cThe move comes as many American families grapple with the rising cost of higher education and as discussions about free public college gain momentum in state legislatures and on the presidential debate stage. Nearly half of the states, including New York, Oregon and Tennessee, have guaranteed free two- or four-year public college to some students.\u201d NYT\n\nEYES ON THE SKIES \u2026 AUTOPSY REPORT -- \u201cWhat Really Brought Down the Boeing 737 Max?\u201d by William Langewiesche for NYT Magazine: \u201cThe paradox is that the failures of the 737 Max were really the product of an incredible success: a decades-long transformation of the whole business of flying, in which airplanes became so automated and accidents so rare that a cheap air-travel boom was able to take root around the world.\n\n\u201cAlong the way, though, this system never managed to fully account for the unexpected: for the moment when technology fails and humans \u2014 a growing population of more than 300,000 airline pilots of variable and largely unpredictable skills \u2014 are required to intervene. In the drama of the 737 Max, it was the decisions made by four of those pilots, more than the failure of a single obscure component, that led to 346 deaths and the worldwide grounding of the entire fleet.\u201d NYT Magazine\n\nCOOL THING -- Elizabeth Warren adviser Camonghne Felix was named to the National Book Awards longlist for \u201cBuild Yourself a Boat,\u201d her first full-length collection of poems.
