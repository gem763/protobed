Most people recognize at an intellectual level that death is inevitable, says Virginia Lee, a nurse who works with cancer patients. But \u201cat least in Western culture, we think we\u2019re going to live forever.\u201d Lee\u2019s advanced-cancer patients often tell her they had thought of death as something that happened to other people\u2014until they received their diagnosis. \u201cI\u2019ve heard from cancer patients that your life changes instantly, the moment the doctor or the oncologist says it\u2019s confirmed that it is cancer,\u201d she says.\n\nThe shock of confronting your own mortality need not happen at that instant, Coyle notes. Maybe you look at yourself in the mirror and suddenly realize how skinny you are, or notice your clothes no longer fit well. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily verbal; it\u2019s not necessarily what other people are telling you,\u201d Coyle says. \u201cYour soul may be telling you, or other people\u2019s eyes may be telling you.\u201d\n\nE. Mansell Pattison, one of the early psychiatrists to write about the emotions and reactions of dying people, explains in The Experience of Dying why this realization marks a radical change in how people think about themselves: \u201cAll of us live with the potential for death at any moment. All of us project ahead a trajectory of our life. That is, we anticipate a certain life span within which we arrange our activities and plan our lives. And then abruptly we may be confronted with a crisis ... Whether by illness or accident, our potential trajectory is suddenly changed.\u201d\n\nIn this crisis, some people feel depression or despair or anger, or all three. They grieve. They grapple with a loss of meaning. A person\u2019s whole belief system may be called into question because \u201cvirtually every aspect of their life will be threatened by changes imposed by the [disease] and its management,\u201d Lee has written. In a small 2011 Danish study, patients with an incurable esophageal cancer reported that after their diagnosis, their lives seemed to spin out of control. Some wondered why they had received a fatal diagnosis, and fell into despair and hopelessness. \u201cI didn\u2019t care about anything,\u201d one patient said. \u201cI had just about given up.\u201d\n\nIn the 1970s, two Harvard researchers, Avery Weisman and J. William Worden, did a foundational study on this existential plight. Newly diagnosed cancer patients who had a prognosis of at least three months were interviewed at several different points. At first, for almost all the patients in the study, existential concerns were more important than dealing with the physical impacts of disease. The researchers found that the reckoning was jarring, but still relatively brief and uncomplicated, lasting about two to three months. For a few patients, the crisis triggered or created lasting psychological problems. A few others seemed to face the crisis, then return to a state of denial, and then double back to the crisis\u2014perhaps more than once. In the study, the researchers describe a patient who was told her diagnosis, only to report to interviewers that she didn\u2019t know what it was\u2014and then make it clear she wasn\u2019t interested in receiving a diagnosis in the near future.", "description": "Palliative-care doctors explain the \u201cexistential slap\u201d that many people face at the end.", "authors": ["Jennie Dear"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2017/11/GettyImages_sb10069454g_001/facebook.jpg?1522344514", "published_at": "2017-11-02"}
