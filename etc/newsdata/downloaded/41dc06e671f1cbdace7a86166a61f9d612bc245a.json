Exclusive meritocracy exists at the super-elite universities and at the industries that draw the bulk of their employees from them \u2014 Wall Street, Big Law, medicine and tech. And then there is the more open meritocracy that exists almost everywhere else.\n\nIn the exclusive meritocracy, prestige is defined by how many people you can reject. The elite universities reject 85 to 95 percent of their applicants. Those accepted spend much of their lives living in neighborhoods and attending conferences where it is phenomenally expensive or hard to get in. Whether it\u2019s the resort town you vacation in or the private school you send your kids to, exclusivity is the pervasive ethos. The more the exclusivity, the thicker will be the coating of P.C. progressivism to show that we\u2019re all good people.\n\nPeople in this caste work phenomenally hard to build their wealth. As Daniel Markovits notes in his powerful new book , \u201cThe Meritocracy Trap,\u201d between 1979 and 2006, the percentage of workers in the top quintile of earners who work more than 50 hours a week nearly doubled.\n\nPeople in this caste are super-skilled and productive. There are more than 70 law firms, Markovits notes, that generate over $1 million in annual profit per partner. When Instagram was bought by Facebook for $1 billion, it had only 13 full-time employees.", "description": "How savage exclusion tears the social fabric.", "authors": ["David Brooks"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/12/opinion/12brooksWeb/12brooksWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
