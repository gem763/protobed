Stephen Curry and D\u2019Angelo Russell led the way on offense with 3-pointers and drives into the paint while Draymond Green held everything together, registering a 16-point, 17-rebound, 10-assist triple double.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nPretty sure Curry and Russell doubled their season passing numbers to each other in this game. pic.twitter.com/s2ZPZODi7b \u2014 Dieter Kurtenbach (@dieter) October 29, 2019\n\nUnexpectedly contributing was bench player Damion Lee, who scored 23 points with 11 rebounds. It was a game that saw most players\u2019 stats get juiced against a Pelicans team that loves to push the pace and therefore increase the number of possessions to log stats.\n\nIt\u2019s the first win of the season for the Warriors, who still have plenty to prove if they want to avoid snickers about their dynasty being completely dead.\n\nCan the Warriors pull it together this year?\n\nDoom and gloom was in high supply at the beginning of the season for Warriors fans used to seeing their team inflict pain against all opponents.\n\nThe team\u2019s season started with a thud by losing 141-122 against the Los Angeles Clippers in the first game at the shiny new Chase Center in San Francisco. Disappointment turned to panic when the team followed that up by getting blown out 120-92 by the rebuilding Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nWins aren't going to be easy for the Warriors this year.

Yes, Kevin Durant and Andre Iguodala left the building and Klay Thompson is still out for the foreseeable future with an ACL tear. But the team still supposedly had an MVP-level player left in Curry and past All-Stars in Green and Russell.\n\nThe team\u2019s depth at the wing was brutal (read that sentence about them needing Damion Lee to score 23 to win again), and their top two centers \u2014 Kevon Looney and Willie Cauley-Stein \u2014 both have yet to log more than 10 minutes in a game so far due to injury. No player in the team\u2019s starting lineup was taller than 6-foot-6 on Monday.\n\nThe question for the Warriors remains if they can survive with such a top-heavy team, with Curry and Russell creatively dominating the offense and ideally not getting worked over on defense. Head coach Steve Kerr has already said giving Curry a James Harden level of usage won\u2019t be the answer, nor should it be (a significant amount of Curry\u2019s value comes from his off-ball movement and gravity).\n\nIt was only one game against a Zion Williamson-less Pelicans, but at least the Warriors quickly showed they can control a game the way they want to.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Good news, the Warriors aren't going 0-82 this season.", "authors": ["Jack Baer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Yc7ripHsiEBwL2uRs4.61Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ViRQ.pfc_gwPAbRsg8IINg--~B/aD0zNjQ4O3c9NTQ3MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/a556e040-fa07-11e9-afff-d04af9276622", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
