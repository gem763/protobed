How many people are there? Are they citizens or are they not citizens?\u201d (Districting and appropriations decisions are in fact based on the census's raw population numbers, not on any citizen count.)\n\n\u201cIt just feels like a farce,\u201d said Vanita Gupta, a former head of DOJ\u2019s civil rights division under President Barack Obama and current president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, which opposes adding the citizenship question. \u201cThere are people who view this as the president asking the Justice Department to do unlawful things and to violate and undermine the rule of law.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

They may also seek more details on Trump\u2019s own involvement. That will likely trigger renewed legal battles over executive privilege and the confidentiality of White House interactions.\n\nThe district court judges will need to be convinced that whatever new rationale the DOJ lawyers produce for adding the census question isn\u2019t undermined by earlier evidence that, among other things, suggested a deceased Republican redistricting strategist, Thomas Hofeller, sought to ask about citizenship to create an electoral advantage for Republicans and non-Hispanic whites.\n\nHazel previously ruled that only Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross\u2019s intent was relevant to the legal issues in the case. But with the litigation now focused on issues of intentional discrimination and a conspiracy to deprive Latinos of their civil rights, the plaintiffs are planning a broader effort to turn up evidence that could be problematic for the administration.\n\n\u201cA civil conspiracy claim is what makes the intent of a larger number of people relevant,\u201c said Denise Hulett of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which represents plaintiffs in the two related cases before Hazel. \u201cWe think that\u2019s going to come into play even more than it did before because it\u2019s clear a large group of people were involved in the decision.\u201d\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201907/2816/1155968404_6054481920001_6054484572001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\"\n\nAnother lawyer for the plaintiffs said some document demands and deposition subpoenas that were taken off the table during the last rounds of litigation may now be in play again. \u201cWe know we didn\u2019t get certain things before and they may now be subject to being revisited,\u201d said Niyati Shah of Asian Americans Advancing Justice.\n\nOne of the plaintiffs\u2019 new targets in discovery will be Trump aides who may have been involved in the decision to add a citizenship question.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been our contention throughout that the White House was directly involved,\u201d Hulett said, \u201cfacilitating connections between Ross and whoever they needed to connect him with.\u201d\n\nHulett noted that just after Ross announced his decision to add the question, Trump\u2019s reelection campaign sent out an email saying the move was the president\u2019s idea.\n\n\u201cThe president wants the 2020 United States Census to ask people whether or not they are citizens,\u201d the March 19, 2018, email said.\n\nThe civil rights groups\u2019 efforts to obtain more behind-the-scenes details seem certain to trigger further legal battles. \u201cWe anticipate resistance,\u201d Hulett said. \u201cExecutive privilege is always difficult to overcome, but it\u2019s not sacrosanct.\u201d\n\nAny attempt to add a citizenship question at this point also could run into trouble with logistics and cost.\n\nTrump said Friday the administration had considered \u201cfour or five ways\u201d to ask about citizenship on the census, including printing an addendum to the standard questionnaire. But an addendum could cause its own problems, according to John Thompson, a former Census director who spent more than three decades with the bureau and resigned in May 2017.\n\n\u201cI think that's probably a recipe for disaster,\u201d he said. \u201cIt hasn't been tested, and it will most likely cause confusion and errors.\u201d\n\nThe bureau would likely need to send an addendum in a separate mailing \u2014 a significant undertaking considering that the Census Bureau seeks to reach 330 million people in more than 140 million households.\n\nThe 2020 census will be the first to feature a digital questionnaire, and the Census Bureau has said it will encourage the majority of households to complete the survey that way. Any change to the digital questionnaire would be easier technologically than adding a printed form, but it would still require approval from the Office of Management and Budget and could run afoul of existing court orders.\n\nAnother stumbling block could be the sudden move to assign new attorneys to the census case, according to Andrew Reamer, a research professor with George Washington University\u2019s Institute for Public Policy, who\u2019s been tracking the census legal battle.\n\nDOJ announced the new group of lawyers Sunday, but did not offer a reason for the change.\n\n\u201cThey just lost their legal staff on this, the guys who have been dealing with this for a year,\u201d he said. \u201cNow they\u2019re stuck with a whole bunch of lawyers from the consumer protection branch.\u201d\n\nStill, he said the change of personnel reflects a broader difficulty in arguing the Trump administration\u2019s position in court.\n\n\u201cI think the staff would have been in personal jeopardy if they had to go forward and argue that June 30 didn\u2019t matter anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would have been a professional stain on their careers.\u201d\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated the name of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund.", "description": "The new DOJ team must find a rationale that the high court will rule consistent with regulatory law and also believable.", "authors": ["Ted Hesson"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/62/36/1306e03a4bbb9b9095e38412cd59/190627-blanc-trump-ap.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-08"}
