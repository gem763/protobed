But today I didn't have much (cash) on me, so I had to take the bus,\" said Irechukwu, a teacher, wiping her face of sweat as she sat inside an air-conditioned bus shelter one afternoon.\n\n\"In Dubai it's better if you're driving.\"\n\nWith more than one vehicle for every two people - according to the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) - Dubai has far more cars per person than other major cities like New York, Berlin and London.\n\nThis contributes to the United Arab Emirates ranking among the 10 countries with the highest per capita carbon footprints, says World Bank data.\n\nThat is something authorities are trying to change, with ambitious plans that in a few years could theoretically see Irechukwu flying to the mall or being picked up by an electrically powered, self-driving \"room on wheels\". From Singapore to Berlin, cities have been looking at new transport technologies to cut traffic and climate-warming emissions.\n\nHaving invested almost 100 billion dirhams ($27 billion) on infrastructure including metro, tram and bus lines since 2005, Dubai is now experimenting with drone taxis and driverless transport pods that it hopes will entice people to leave their cars at home.\n\nThe technological push might only partially curb Dubai's car dependency, but it has turned the city into a laboratory of future transportation, according to transport experts.\n\n\"You could easily brand what's happening in Dubai with those flashy trials as slightly gimmicky,\" said Philipp Rode, who runs LSE Cities, a research centre at the London School of Economics.\n\n\"This is not really trying to rethink the city at a systemic scale. But then, if you look in a bit more detail, there are interesting innovations,\" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n\n\n\n\n\nBUS, TAXI OR POD?\n\nAmong those innovations are autonomous pods that aim to combine the comfort of ride-hailing services like Uber with the efficiency and capacity of buses, said Rode.\n\nThe cube-shaped vehicles built in Italy by California-based firm NEXT Future Transportation can carry up to 10 people each and dock together when in motion, allowing passengers to move from one unit to the other as they travel.\n\nThe vehicles would pick up single users at home, then pool people going in the same direction inside one module, as other pods are released to collect more passengers.\n\n\"It's like a relay race,\" said inventor Tommaso Gecchelin, who co-founded the company.\n\nWith a top speed of 90 km per hour (56 miles per hour) and measuring 6.5 square metres (70 square feet) each, the pods look like \"rooms on wheels\", he said in a phone interview.\n\nThey can also include bars, toilets and check-in facilities for people headed to the airport.\n\nA fleet of 1,000 could help Dubai cut traffic congestion by up to 50%, by allowing people like Irechukwu to move around in affordable comfort all year round, Gecchelin estimated.\n\nThe company plans to start mass production by the end of next year and have at least four pods ready to ferry visitors within the Dubai 2020 Expo site, after it tested two prototypes in the city in 2018.\n\n\n\n\n\nNO PILOT\n\nThe pod trials come under the city's plans to make a quarter of daily transportation self-driven by 2030, which Dubai's Roads and Transport Authority says could help significantly cut transportation costs, road accidents and pollution.\n\nRTA director general Mattar al-Tayer said the city has also been looking into self-driving cars, \"sky pods\" that run on suspended rails and flying taxis.\n\nIn 2017, the city launched its bid to become the world's first city with a drone taxi service when an unmanned two-seater drone resembling a small helicopter cabin topped by a wide hoop studded with 18 propellers took its maiden flight within the emirate.\n\nAlexander Zosel, co-founder of Volocopter, the German company that built the sky cab, said 1,000 drones taking off and landing vertically from at least 30 ports across the city could move 10,000 people around per hour.", "description": "With a bus stop only five minutes from her Dubai home, it is normally convenient for Deborah Irechukwu to travel to the city centre by public transport - except in summer.
