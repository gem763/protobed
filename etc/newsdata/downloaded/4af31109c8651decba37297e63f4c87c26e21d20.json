He was compared to Crystal Palace player Wilfried Zaha (right)\n\nPillow company owner Thomas Skinner (left) was compared to Back to the Future bully Biff Tannen (right)\n\nRyan-Mark boasts a varied career for his young age, having worked for Gucci, the House of Commons as well as the NHS, but viewers did not seem impressed.\n\nMeanwhile, Thomas Skinner, the 28 year-old owner of a pillow company, from London, was likened to Back to the Future bully Biff Tannen.\n\n'Good to see Biff Tannen back in business,' one wrote.\n\n'Nice to see Biff Tannen in this year's Apprentice,' said another.\n\nIn the Hollywood saga Biff, played by Thomas F. Wilson, is the main antagonist to Micheal J. Fox's Marty McFly.\n\nViewers did not hold anything back and shared countless comparisons on Twitter during last night's episode of the Apprentice\n\nTwo others contestants enjoyed more pleasant comparisons.\n\nKenna Ngoma, 24, from Manchester, owner of an alcoholic ice-cream company, was compared to Crystal Palace player Wilfried Zaha.\n\nAs luck would have it, Kenna himself was once on the pitch. Before starting his business, he was a semi-professional player for Manchester City.\n\nMeanwhile, Lewis Ellis, 28, from Lancashire, who rose to fame with prank videos on Youtube, was compared to Aston Villa's captain Jack Grealish.\n\nLewis made waves in last night's episode, by narrowly escaping the chop after an outburst in the board room.\n\nLewis (center) lost his temper and shouted at Shahin Hassan (right) and Dean Ahmad (left) during the boardroom scene\n\nLord Sugar (pictured) was not impressed with Lewis' poor temper and gave him a stern warning\n\nAs the candidates divided into two teams, opposing the women and the men, Lewis volunteered to be his team's project manager.\n\nThe teams were tasked with creating tour packages for tourists in South Africa.\n\nWhilst the women opted for a luxury wine tasting, the men struggled to put together a safari, and eventually lost the battle to their savvier female counterparts.\n\nFaced with Lord Sugar in the boardroom, Lewis let his emotions loose as he discussed his team's failure and raised his voice while talking to his teammates.\n\nThe TV host had to ask Lewis to 'calm down' and act in a professional manner.\n\nThe teams were tasked with creating their own package holidays in South Africa and the boys team decided to put together a safari tour. Pictured left to right: Ryan-Mark, Riyonn and Kenna during last night's episode\n\n'Lewis I have to say as the Project Manager one is bitterly disappointed and I'm also bitterly disappointed in your outburst of temper.'\n\nLord Sugar was far from amused by the contestant's outburst and gave him a stern warning: 'You young man, you burst out like that in front of me or Claude and Karren or anyone else and you\u2019ll be out that door. Just be calm and professional.\"\n\nIn spite of Lewis' bad temper and the host's warning, Shahin Hassan, 36, was the first candidate to be 'fired' in the 2019 edition of the show after failing to make any sell at all during the task.", "description": "Fans have taken to Twitter to point out some famous doppelgangers among the 16 Apprentice hopefuls, noting Thomas Skinner's resemblance to Back to the Future bully Biff Tannen.", "authors": ["Claire Toureille For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/03/12/19250024-0-image-a-104_1570102591632.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
