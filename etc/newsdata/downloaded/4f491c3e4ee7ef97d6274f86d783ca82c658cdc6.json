Meanwhile Simon and Ben lost a stone between them and focused on building muscle.\n\nSue McGillivray, 51, pushed her whole family to go on a weight loss journey after losing her mother to diabetes. Pictured before and after\n\nBen, 24, lost a combined stone with his elder brother Simon, and built muscle while exercising with his fmaily. Pictured before and after\n\nSue said: 'I had got to a point in my life where I needed to make some big changes.\n\n'I had a family history of diabetes and that was something I saw for myself if I continued on the path I was on. I really felt that I needed to address my diet, my exercise.\n\n'After the death of my mum, because it was related to diabetes, it was really important to get myself sorted and not go down that same track,' she added.\n\n'The way that I have dealt with my grief, this has given me a real focus, to focus on myself and get myself healthy rather than focusing on grief.'\n\nRoy, 56, lost two stone thanks to the family's regular exercise, and now says he feels fitter than he did at 36 (pictured before and after)\n\nSimon, 28, focused on building muscle. He said exercising together has brought the family closer (before and after)\n\nThe mother-of-two explained she had fallen out of love with herself, but said exercising did wonders to improve her self-esteem.\n\n'Being overweight made me feel that I had lost myself. I felt like a big person had eaten a small person,' she admitted.\n\n'I started noticing results within two weeks. The weight started coming off, and once that happens you really get the motivation to keep going.'\n\nLeft to right: Simon McGillivray, 28, with his father Roy, 56, Sue, 51 and Ben, 24, pictured together after starting exercising together\n\nIn six months, Sue lost so much weight that some of her acquaintances no longer recongise her.\n\nShe admitted she feels like a different personal after losing the weight.\n\n'I feel great,' she said. 'When you get dressed and people give you compliments it is nice, but ultimately it is how you feel in yourself, being able to look in the mirror and liking what you see. I am happy.'\n\nRoy, who works as the managing director of a dental firm, explained he enjoyed a moderately healthy lifestyle prior to starting the diet.\n\n'My diet and lifestyle was probably pretty average,' he said.\n\nBen pictured before developing his muscle mass after his family decided to start exercising together\n\n'I was working hard. I wouldn\u2019t eat breakfast in the morning, I would have something mid-morning at work, fatty food, a bacon and egg sandwich, sometimes I would take lunch, sometimes I wouldn't.\n\n'In the evenings I would find myself eating takeaway food because I was too tired to prepare something. You may go to the pub after work for tea, but then you would end up having two or three drinks, so then you were consuming more alcohol. That was the lifestyle.'\n\nRoy admitted he had never realised how unhealthy he was until having his measurements done.\n\n'I had never considered myself to be obese - but I was obese,' he said.\n\n'That has got a bearing on your life. You reach a certain age, and if you allow your fitness levels to be poor and your diet to be unhealthy then you have to pay a price for that.\n\nSue and Roy before losing the weight. Both said they feel better about themselves now that they are a few stone lighter\n\nSue said some of her acquaintances did not recognise her after she lost two and a half stone in six months (pictured before)\n\n'If you look after yourself then age really is just a number.'\n\nThe father-of-two said that people's positive comments about his weight loss made him feel '10ft tall'.\n\n'When you go shopping and buy some new shirts and trousers and they fit nice, you feel good about yourself,' he said.\n\nRoy and Sue before their weight loss. Roy said he never noticed how unhealthy he was until he got his measurements taken\n\nThe couple enjoying some time together before their weight loss. Sue admitted she had fallen out of love with herself but now feels more confident\n\nHe added he feels better about himself now than he did at 36, and said he was probably fitter as well.\n\n'To be able to say that is incredible. I think it has given me longevity, energy and focus,' he said.\n\nEldest son Simon said the family has found healthier ways to do things as a family, and will go on nights out bowling or enjoy a healthy restaurant meal instead of gathering around for a pizza.\n\n'The change in my mum has been unbelievable,' he added.\n\n'I hadn't realised how down she was. But the change in her over the course of the last six months has been incredible.\n\n'I look at how she is now - she is enjoying life and that rubs off on the rest of the family.'", "description": "Sue McGillivbray, 51, from Manchester, overhauled the diet and exercise routines of husband Roy, 51 and sons Simon, 28 and Ben, 24, after losing her mother to type 2 diabetes.", "authors": ["Claire Toureille For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/18/20047572-0-image-a-331_1571765264482.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
