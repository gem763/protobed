She cloaks her rage and neediness with the pretense that she is a stateswoman assisting the next generation of women when every woman knows she is a born Mean Girl.\n\nNo champion of women would reduce her adult daughter to dumb note-taker and adoring cipher. Forever cowering in her mother\u2019s shadow, Chelsea is not allowed to be a gutsy woman.\n\nThere\u2019s only ever been room for Hillary on the stage. And unless the Democrats finally find the guts to push her off, they may as well sit out the next election.", "description": "", "authors": ["Miranda Devine", "Nypost.Com"], "top_image": ""}
