Petersen is accused of arranging for dozens of pregnant women from the Marshall Islands to come to the U.S. to give their children up for adoption\n\nAn elected official in Arizona was suspended Monday after he was charged with running a human smuggling scheme that brought pregnant women from the Marshall Islands to the U.S. to give birth and then paid them to give up their children for adoption.\n\nLeaders in Arizona's most populous county suspended Assessor Paul Petersen without pay for 120 days.\n\nThe Maricopa County Board of Supervisors doesn't have the power to permanently remove him from his office, which determines the value of properties for tax purposes in Phoenix and its suburbs.\n\nThe board must now appoint someone in Petersen's absence.\n\nPetersen, who is in federal custody, has so far refused to resign since his arrest on October 8. His lawyer, Kurt Altman, said Petersen will fight to keep the $77,000-a-year job he was last elected to in 2016.\n\nThe Maricopa County Board of Supervisors takes the first step toward suspending an elected official accused of running a human smuggling scheme during a meeting in Phoenix\n\nAuthorities say Petersen has for years run an adoption law practice in Mesa that involves bringing women from the Marshall Islands, pictured, to the U.S. to give birth\n\nPetersen, a Republican, has been indicted in federal court in Arkansas and also charged in Arizona and Utah with crimes that include human smuggling, sale of a child, fraud, forgery and conspiracy to commit money laundering.\n\nThe criminal case spans three years and involves some 75 adoptions, authorities said, with about 30 adoptions pending in three states.\n\nPetersen is accused of illegally paying women from the Marshall Islands to have their babies in the United States and give them up for adoption.\n\nThere are currently eight pregnant Marshallese women staying at a Mesa apartment according to Fox 10.\n\nProsecutors say Petersen was to pay them each $10,000 to put their newborns up for adoption.\n\n'The commoditization of children is simply evil,' said Utah Attorney General Sean D. Reyes.\n\nThe adoptive parents are considered victims along with the birth mothers, and no completed adoptions will be undone, authorities said.\n\nPetersen's attorney, Matthew Long, defended his client's actions during an earlier October court hearing in Phoenix as 'proper business practices' and said they disagreed with the allegations.\n\nPetersen's attorney, Matthew Long, right, defended his client's actions during a court hearing in Phoenix as 'proper business practices', seen earlier this month\n\nIt was reported in 2018 how Petersen was said to have paid for more than 40 pregnant Marshallese women to live in his four-bedroom home in Salt Lake City, Utah before placing their babies with adoptive families.\n\nThe women were crammed into homes owned or rented by Petersen, sometimes with little to no prenatal care and in one house slept on mattresses laid on bare floors in what one shocked adoptive family described as a 'baby mill,' according court documents.\n\nUtah Attorney General Sean Reyes told The Salt Lake City Tribune: 'While Mr. Petersen is entitled to a presumption of innocence, our investigation uncovered evidence that he has committed horrible crimes.\n\n'Petersen's illegal adoption scheme exploited highly vulnerable groups in two countries \u2014 the birth mothers and families in the Marshall Islands and the adoptive parents here in Utah.'\n\nA Utah home that was owned by an Arizona elected official charged with human smuggling in an adoption fraud scheme in West Valley City, Utah\n\nPetersen charged families $25,000 to $40,000 per adoption, prosecutors said.\n\nPetersen completed a mission in the Marshall Islands, a collection of atolls and islands in the eastern Pacific, for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\nHe later worked in the islands and the U.S. on behalf of an international adoption agency before going to law school and becoming an adoption attorney.\n\nThe Board of Supervisors said Monday that Arizona law allows it to suspend Petersen for 'neglect of duty,' citing his absence from the office during his incarceration and limited access to phone and email.\n\nAlanna Mabey holds her grandson in front of her home in West Valley City, Utah. Authorities say Petersen used homes like this one to lodge pregnant women from the Marshall Islands who were offered money to come to the U.S. to give up their children for adoption\n\nAn audit of Petersen's office also found files from his adoption business on his county computer, which can't be used for personal business, the supervisors said.\n\nThe audit also showed several calls made from Petersen's desk phone or county-provided cellphone to Arkansas, Jamaica and the Philippines over the past six years and about 30 emails related to adoptions since Petersen became assessor in 2013.\n\nBoard Chairman Bill Gates said the supervisors will look to appoint someone to fill Petersen's position during the suspension.\n\nPetersen is allowed to request a hearing to defend himself. Petersen's attorney said the law allowing elected officials to be suspended may be unconstitutional.\n\nUtah Attorney General Sean Reyes talks about the case against Paul D. Petersen during a news conference in Salt Lake City, Utah, earlier this month\n\nAn investigation last year by the Hawaii news website Honolulu Civil Beat last year questioned the legality of adoptions Petersen administers through his work as a private adoption attorney.\n\nKookie Gideon The Honolulu Civil Beat: 'I thought that everything was going to be OK. But it wasn't until way later that I realized, I should have gone to court.'\n\nThe Compact of Free Associations was designed to protect women in the Marhshall Islands from traveling to the U.S. to adopt out their babies without a special visa by stopping black market deals.\n\nThe Utah probe began after investigators got a call to a human-trafficking tip line in October 2017. Staff at several hospitals in the Salt Lake City area would eventually report an \u201cinflux\u201d of women from the Marshall Islands giving birth and putting their babies up for adoption, often accompanied by the same woman.\n\nThe scheme defrauded Arizona\u2019s Medicaid system of $800,000 because the women had no intention of remaining in the state when they applied, according to Arizona prosecutors.\n\nUnder a compact between the United States and the Republic of the Marshall Islands, Marshallese citizens can enter the U.S. and work without a visa, unless they\u2019re traveling for the purpose of adoption, authorities said.\n\nPetersen has faced troubles with his adoption practices in the past. An Arizona juvenile court judge in 2016 denied a couple\u2019s request to adopt a child born to a Marshallese woman because he feared the arrangement set up by Petersen had violated that country\u2019s law. A court of appeals reversed the decision, saying no Marshallese approval was necessary.\n\nAuthorities do not believe the women were misled into believing their children might be returned at some point.\n\nArizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich said adoptive parents who went through Petersen\u2019s agency have nothing to worry about.\n\n\u201cNo one\u2019s going to go back and redo adoptions or any of that kind of stuff,\u201d Brnovich said.\n\nPetersen claims his law practice 'has helped people all across the country in their effort to adopt children' for 15 years.\n\nPetersen is in his second term as assessor following a special election victory in 2014 and re-election in 2016. He served nearly eight years as the assessor's office representative to the Arizona Legislature and as the agency's public information officer.", "description": "County Assessor Paul Petersen was suspended  after he was charged with running a human smuggling scheme that brought pregnant women from the Marshall Islands to the U.S. to give birth.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/13/20327048-0-image-a-11_1572356096549.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
