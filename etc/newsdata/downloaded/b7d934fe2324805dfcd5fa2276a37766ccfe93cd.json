Seven of those killed were women or girls, the other 89 were men and boys; in total 37 of the people who died were teenagers.\n\nDuckenfield was charged in June 2017 following the conclusion of a new inquest into the disaster and a police investigation, Operation Resolve, which was established after the report of the Hillsborough Independent Panel, published in September 2012.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An injured victim is carried away on the terrace at Hillsborough during the 1989 FA Cup semi final.

Bland was 18 when he went to support Liverpool at the match and was among those trapped in the crush. He suffered catastrophic brain damage due to critical loss of oxygen.\n\nHe was transferred to Airedale General hospital near his home in Keighley, west Yorkshire, where he remained unconscious and was fed and maintained on life support for almost four years. The life support was withdrawn in March 1993, following a House of Lords court judgment that allowed an application by Airedale NHS trust to do so, supported by Bland\u2019s parents and family, based on expert medical evidence that he could never recover.\n\n\n\nAccording to the law in 1989, no criminal charge relating to a death could be brought if the victim died longer than a year and a day after the acts alleged to have caused it. That \u201cyear and a day rule\u201d was abolished by legislation in 1996, but Duckenfield is being prosecuted under the law as it applied at the time of the disaster.\n\n\n\nHe is charged with failing in his duty, as the police officer in command, to take reasonable care for the safety of spectators at the areas of Hillsborough designated for Liverpool supporters, to protect them from overcrowding and crushing. The indictment alleges that Duckenfield breached his duty of care, to prevent people being crushed in pens three and four, that his breach amounted to criminal gross negligence, and was \u201ca substantial cause\u201d of the deaths. The maximum sentence for a person convicted of manslaughter by gross negligence is life in prison.\n\n\n\nDuckenfield has pleaded not guilty to the charge. The trial is expected to last about six weeks and will be broadcast live to the Cunard building in Liverpool, so that the families of the 96 people killed at Hillsborough, survivors and other members of the public can attend proceedings more easily than travelling to Preston.", "description": "The ex-South Yorkshire police chief superintendent was in command during 1989 disaster", "authors": ["David Conn"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/705f052340302f11145a7a42c22033372b58a0b1/0_113_3386_2031/master/3386.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=af77d4acb40055af2aa7021cb3089c27", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
