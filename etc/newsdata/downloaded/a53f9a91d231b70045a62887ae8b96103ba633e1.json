Credit Suisse boss Tidjane Thiam looks similarly hapless following the departure of his closest ally on Tuesday after the latter hired spies to tail an ex-employee. It\u2019s the second key staff member to head out the door in three months.\n\nShareholders may feel relieved that Thiam is staying in the post \u2013 not least as there are few obvious successors. An internal investigation initiated by Chairman Urs Rohner cleared Thiam, and the Credit Suisse board, of any wrongdoing after concluding they had no knowledge of the decision to hire private investigators to tail ex-wealth head Iqbal Khan.\n\nThat was a decision taken \u2013 and secretly hidden \u2013 by Chief Operating Officer Pierre-\u200bOlivier Bou\u00e9e and the bank\u2019s head of security, the internal probe found. Both have resigned following an alleged altercation between the hapless spies and Khan in the middle of Zurich on Sept. 17.\n\nThiam\u2019s vindication is bittersweet. Bou\u00e9e has followed his fellow McKinsey alumnus from UK insurers Aviva and Prudential to the Zurich-based lender over the past 15 years. The fact that such a close personal ally essentially went rogue in trying to determine whether Khan was poaching employees constitutes a painful blow, and a surprising one.\n\nThere is an added piquancy in the fact that Rohner acknowledged Thiam had badly fallen out with Khan earlier this year due to a private disagreement that flared at a garden party. The chairman later helped broker Khan\u2019s departure agreement \u2013 with only three months leave \u2013 after it became apparent the CEO and the bank\u2019s chief wealth manager couldn\u2019t work together. The latter is now set to join UBS.\n\nBack in 2016, Thiam\u2019s tenure got off to a rocky start when the bank lost almost $1 billion on high-risk trades that had been increased without the knowledge of senior executives including himself. Now as then, knowing about something that damages the bank\u2019s reputation is clearly worse than not knowing. But in both cases, ignorance is not exactly a great look.", "description": "(Reuters Breakingviews) - Oscar Wilde once quipped that losing one family member could be regarded as unlucky, but losing two looked like carelessness.
