REUTERS/Amir Cohen\n\nJERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called on Thursday for his pre-trial hearing next week on corruption allegations to be broadcast live, saying that \u201cthe time has come for the public to hear everything, including my side\u201d.\n\nFollowing a deadlocked Sept. 17 election, Netanyahu is fighting for a fifth term in office that might confer legal immunity in three long-running cases that he has cast as a baseless and politically motivated witch-hunt.\n\nIsrael\u2019s attorney-general, Avichai Mandelblit, has said he intends to file fraud and breach of trust charges against Netanyahu pending a hearing - an opportunity for a VIP suspect to argue that a trial is not in the national interest.\n\n\u201cAfter a three-year flood of tendentious, partial media leaks, the time has come for the public to hear everything, including my side,\u201d Netanyahu said in a social media video.\n\n\u201cI am therefore asking the attorney-general to open up the hearing for live broadcast ... You know that transparency delivers the truth.\u201d\n\nMandelblit\u2019s office did not immediately respond.\n\nOn Wednesday, the conservative Netanyahu was tapped to try to form the next coalition government after garnering marginally more support from lawmakers than his centrist election rival, Benny Gantz. Neither commands a clear parliamentary majority.", "description": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called on Thursday for his pre-trial hearing next week on corruption allegations to be broadcast live, saying that \"the time has come for the public to hear everything, including my side\".", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434125343&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P0YR", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
