Because nuclear\n\n\n\n- is how France & your country, Sweden, get 86% & 90% of their power from zero-carbon sources\n\n\n\n- is THE SAFEST way to make electricity pic.twitter.com/tArInyUmxX \u2014 Mike Shellenberger (@ShellenbergerMD) September 28, 2019\n\nFrench President @EmmanuelMacron is right: Your \"Very radical positions [are] likely to antagonize our societies\"\n\n\n\nIndeed, they already have\n\n\n\nBut then, perhaps that was the goal all along?https://t.co/20KeNyRWpm \u2014 Mike Shellenberger (@ShellenbergerMD) September 28, 2019\n\nShellenberger said if the activists just looked at what climate scientists are saying, they'd see a strong defense of nuclear.\n\nAround the world, those seeking to shut down nuclear plants & replace them with nat gas & a few \"renewables\" are @Greenpeace @billmckibben @NaomiAKlein et al. while those people defending nuclear are the climate scientists for whom you claim to speak: https://t.co/lfHHEMDNSd \u2014 Mike Shellenberger (@ShellenbergerMD) September 28, 2019\n\nSince 2016, the global pro-nuclear movement & my NGO have prevented emissions from rising the equivalent of adding 24M cars to the road\n\n\n\nHow? By standing up to your allies\n\n\n\nSo spare us the hypocritical moralizing & fake denunciations of \"climate deniers\" & stop attacking nuclear pic.twitter.com/36ZdV9j8ST \u2014 Mike Shellenberger (@ShellenbergerMD) September 28, 2019\n\nI couldn't care less whether you go back to school or not but you should get educated about why only nuclear can radically decarbonize energy supplies...https://t.co/kT1zogU0mW \u2014 Mike Shellenberger (@ShellenbergerMD) September 28, 2019\n\nShellenberger called on Thunberg and other environmental activists to take a look how the push for renewables completely failed places like Vermont and Germany.\n\nYou should study the example of Vermont where the anti-nuclear advocacy of @billmckibben & @BernieSanders led directly to a spike in carbon emissions \u2014 and why renewables proved grossly inadequate:https://t.co/fXaqEMC0PD \u2014 Mike Shellenberger (@ShellenbergerMD) September 28, 2019\n\nYou should study the history of renewable energy advocacy's creepy, dark, Romantic, and anti-modern roots in Germany, which everyday proves why renewables can't power modern civilizationhttps://t.co/jb0mIpINCx \u2014 Mike Shellenberger (@ShellenbergerMD) September 28, 2019\n\nIf you are going to condemn fossil fuels as \"evil\" then you should contemplate why it is that oil and gas companies are spending millions to promote the unreliable renewables that you, too, are promoting:https://t.co/8REtBKJPHx \u2014 Mike Shellenberger (@ShellenbergerMD) September 28, 2019\n\nHe also pointed out the ecological impact of renewable energy sources.\n\nIf you're going to moralize against species extinction along with your allies @ExtinctionR then consider how wind turbines are killing endangered species around the world & may be contributing to the insect die-off in Germany and elsewhere:https://t.co/iA55b2sQ53 \u2014 Mike Shellenberger (@ShellenbergerMD) September 28, 2019\n\nWhile environmental activists love to give end-of-the-world predictions if climate change isn't addressed, Shellenberger said \"time is short\" for another reason: the economic and environmental toll their efforts are taking on countries is happening quickly.", "description": ".10/01/2019 8:42:03AM EST.", "authors": ["Leah Barkoukis", "Beth Baumann", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/247/3af22816-5fc6-48dc-9857-1440b2dcd639.png", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
