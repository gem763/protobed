Miller, his 63-year-old friend and a neighbor of 20 years, told authorities that Pavelich had struck him with a metal pole after they returned to Pavelich\u2019s home in Lutsen, Minn., from a day of fishing. According to the criminal complaint, Pavelich had grown angry, accusing Miller of \u201cspiking his beer.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nPavelich was charged with second- and third-degree assault, possession of an illegal shotgun and possessing a gun with a missing serial number. Miller suffered cracked ribs, a bruised kidney and a fracture to one of his vertebrae, as well as bruises and a mark on his back.\n\nThe former hockey player sat quietly during the hearing, according to the Star-Tribune, in Grand Marais, Minn., a community on the shore of Lake Superior, and listened as his $250,000 bail was doubled because the psychologist\u2019s report indicated \u201csignificant risk to public safety.\u201d Judge Michael Cuzzo urged the county to move quickly to arrange civil commitment.\n\nAD\n\nLast summer, Pavelich\u2019s sister, Jean Gevik, described behavioral changes that she believes stem from \u201call the concussions and the blows he had\u201d during an NHL career. His family began seeing changes about five years ago and believes that Pavelich has CTE, a degenerative brain disease that has been linked to erratic behavior and deaths among hockey and football players and others in sports in which there are concussive and repeated subconcussive blows to the head.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMark is the most kind and gentle person you\u2019d ever know,\u201d Gevik told the Star-Tribune. \u201cThis is a totally different guy.\u201d\n\nAccording to Gevik, the late Herb Brooks, Team USA\u2019s coach at the 1980 Games and Pavelich\u2019s coach in the NHL with the New York Rangers, recalled that Pavelich had one especially severe head injury that could have ended his life. \u201cAll the research is out there about CTE,\u201d she said. \u201cThis should not be a surprise here.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nPavelich and the U.S. Olympic team vaulted into history with their stunning 4-3 victory over the Soviet Union in a semifinal game and Pavelich assisted on Mike Eruzione\u2019s winning goal. The United States went on to beat Finland in the gold medal game in Lake Placid. Pavelich, a Minnesota native, played in 355 NHL games, then essentially disappeared in retirement. Seven years ago, Pavelich\u2019s wife Kara, 44, died in an accidental fall from a second-story balcony at their Lutsen home. In 2014, he sold his gold medal for $262,900 at auction to provide for his daughter. \u201cI\u2019m doing a lot for my daughter here,\u201d he explained then. \u201cI want her to get a step forward in life. That\u2019s probably the biggest reason.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOver the last few years, Gevik said her brother has had \u201canger issues,\u201d but added that \u201che never hurt anybody, not even in the NHL. Even when he\u2019d get battered around, he\u2019d never retaliate.\u201d\n\nMore sports coverage from The Post:\n\nAD\n\nAD", "description": "A judge ordered civil commitment for Mark Pavelich, accused of assaulting a neighbor in August.", "authors": ["Cindy Boren", "Reporter Covering Sports", "With An Emphasis On Politics", "National Stories"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/lEVd7UjFR0lBiXDeO5cUS1ytrFc=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AUI75QX2JQI6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
