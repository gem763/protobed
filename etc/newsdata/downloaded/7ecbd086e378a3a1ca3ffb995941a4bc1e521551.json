Boards and management needed to be more open to talking about change because cost pressures would force reform anyway.\n\nSince the 1950s, private schools had operated on a simple financial model where fees, donations and government contributions roughly equalled the cost of salaries.\n\nVery few private schools have substantial bequests, a fact highlighted last week when businessman Terry Snow gave his old school $20 million, more than double the next biggest donation.\n\n\"Private schools get swamped by the operational at the expense of the strategic. They have a strategy day once a year. That's not sufficient to grapple with the immense challenges they face.\"\n\n\"There are higher expectations for the quality of facilities for students. Environmental and sustainability costs were not relevant 10 years ago. Water storage, digitisation, cyber risk management, different outdoor sports, transport to sporting locations, all those sorts of things.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Kids are asserting more control at a young age, which is a good thing. But it has implications for conventional classroom teaching. Students will learn in smaller groups and there will be higher demand for mentoring.\n\n\"I am convinced one-to-one mentoring will be a significant way of assisting students. The world is more complex and it's difficult for kids to get their minds around this. To navigate they are going to need calm, steadying advice from older people.\"\n\nAll this would combine with above-inflation teachers' salary increases driven by always-on technology and six-day working weeks thanks to Saturday sport.\n\nChanging the business model would be hardest for boarding schools which are being hit by the drought. Many boards had not allowed for in their short term planning.\n\nA typical top-tier boarding fee is around $30,009 which will rise to $50,141 by 2040 if the 10-year trend in boarding fees continues. Tuition would be on top of that, pushing year 12 education well into triple digits, requiring pre tax income of just under $200,000 for one, final-year, boarding student.\n\nMr Simpson said he wanted to parents given choice in education, which meant having a healthy private school sector.\n\nHe decided to go public on his concerns because school boards did not look into the future and talk with parents and policymakers about their uncertain future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I can't see why independent and Catholic schools do not engage in public discussion. I don't accept the argument that these are \"private\" in the sense of not discussing.\n\n\"When was the last time you saw a headmaster talk publicly about the future of their school?\"\n\nWhen was the last time you saw a headmaster talk publicly about the future of their school? \u2014 John Simpson, former private-school board member.\n\nSome time-intensive sports such as cricket were already under pressure but as costs soared boards would have to rethink the cost of space, ovals and water.\n\nSpecialist classes such as languages face sharing teachers with other private schools.\n\nThe lucky schools would be the ones where the governing council had set up a philanthropic foundation back in the 1950s or 1960s. It took at least two decades to build a robust financial platform and some schools were only getting onto this now.\n\nInexplicably girls private schools were less well prepared and many had only set up foundations in the last five years.\n\nUniversities by contrast were far down the path, probably because they were more exposed to international business which gave them income but exposed them to more unpredictability.\n\nOnce exception was Haileybury school in Melbourne, which has opened an extra campus in the city centre, breaking the traditional image of a private school.", "description": "It will cost more than $84,000 for a private-school year 12 student by 2040.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_4.5152%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_72/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/8cc893451fb1c03df563647748dc58f0802928cd", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
