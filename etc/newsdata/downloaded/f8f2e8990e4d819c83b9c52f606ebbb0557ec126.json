which he apologised for.\n\nBut he claimed there was a \"cloud of indignation\" around the use of terms like \"surrender\" to distract from MPs' desire to frustrate Brexit.\n\nLabour's Angela Rayner said Mr Johnson should be \"absolutely, utterly ashamed of himself\".\n\nThe shadow education secretary said the PM had \"a direct strategy to divide our country\", which she called \"really damaging\", but added that MPs on both sides of the Commons needed to \"dial down that language and act responsibly\".\n\nMr Johnson spoke to the BBC's Andrew Marr ahead of the start of the Conservative Party conference in Manchester.\n\nThe annual gathering follows a turbulent week for the PM - facing stormy scenes in Westminster after a ruling by the Supreme Court that his suspension of Parliament was unlawful.\n\nRows later broke out over Mr Johnson's Commons conduct - and that of his Attorney General Geoffrey Cox - and questions are also continuing over his links with US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri.\n\nBut he will use the conference to try to focus on delivering Brexit and making funding promises for public services.\n\nOn the opening day, ministers have promised to spend billions on hospital projects across England in the next decade.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Furious MPs confront Boris Johnson over his language\n\nBut opposition MPs back in London could stage a no-confidence vote in the government some time this week.\n\nNo 10 failed to secure a recess for the conference, meaning Tory MPs could face travelling between Manchester and Westminster for crucial votes while it takes place.\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn is also expected to bring opposition leaders together at a meeting on Monday to plan their next steps to avert a no-deal Brexit.\n\nMr Corbyn has said he would be ready to become a caretaker PM if Mr Johnson was forced from No 10.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Corbyn: Emergency government 'more likely every day'\n\nGreater Manchester Police said they were expecting tens of thousands of protesters to attend two rallies on Sunday against Brexit and austerity.\n\nA small number of demonstrators also gathered outside the conference venue on Saturday night when Mr Johnson arrived with his partner, Carrie Symonds.\n\nSpeaking to Andrew Marr, Mr Johnson defended his decision to repeatedly refer to the Benn Act - which is designed to force the PM to seek an extension rather than lead the country into a no-deal Brexit - as \"the surrender bill\".\n\nLast week, Labour's Paula Sheriff said threats made to her and other MPs often quoted his \"dangerous\" language of \"surrender\" and \"betrayal\".\n\nShe also referred to the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox in 2016, but Mr Johnson replied: \"I've never heard such humbug in all my life.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Boris Johnson and his partner Carrie Symonds arrived in Manchester on Saturday evening\n\nThe PM said any such threats were \"deplorable\" but he did not regret \"using the word surrender to describe the surrender act\".\n\n\"Military metaphors are old, standard, Parliamentary terms,\" he continued.\n\n\"I think everybody should calm down,\" he said, but asked whether that included him, he added: \"I think I've been the model of restraint.\"\n\nThe Jo Cox Foundation - set up in memory of the murdered MP - has called on all political parties to agree to a code of conduct to help protect MPs.\n\nCardinal Vincent Nichols, the UK's most senior Catholic clergyman, warned some of the language being used could encourage violent extremists.\n\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Sunday programme political leaders had a particular responsibility to be respectful in public discourse.\n\nCommons Speaker John Bercow will hold an emergency meeting on Monday with party leaders over the use of \"inflammatory language\" in Parliament.\n\nWhat is the Benn Act?\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Hilary Benn presented the bill in his name to Parliament\n\nWhen Mr Johnson talks about the \"surrender bill\", he is referring to the European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 2) Act, also known as the Benn Act after Labour MP Hilary Benn, who introduced the legislation to the Commons.\n\nThe act - which became law earlier this month - stipulates the prime minister will have until 19 October to either pass a deal in Parliament or get MPs to approve a no-deal Brexit.\n\nOnce this deadline has passed, he will have to request an extension to the UK's departure date to 31 January 2020 from the EU.\n\nIf the EU responds by proposing a different date, the PM will have two days to accept that proposal. But during this two-day period, MPs - not the government - will have the opportunity to reject the EU's date.\n\nOn Brexit, Mr Johnson said he still thought there was a \"good chance\" of getting a deal with the EU and the government was \"working incredibly hard\".\n\nSuccess depended on \"the common sense of our EU partners\", he argued, but said talks were \"not being helped\" by the Benn Act.\n\n\"If they suspect or think there is a realistic chance the UK can be kept in [the EU], that clearly takes away a lot of our negotiating freedom.\"\n\nThe PM insisted that \"of course\" the UK could still leave without a deal on 31 October despite the act - although he would not be drawn on how that could happen.\n\nMr Johnson also ruled out bringing back the withdrawal agreement negotiated between Theresa May and the EU, and dismissed suggestions he could resign rather than ask for an extension.\n\nThere's no sign whatsoever of Boris Johnson retreating from his strategy - the approach he's taken since he moved into Downing Street. And as far as many people in his team, and the wider party, are concerned their only real path to success is to stick to trying get Brexit done by 31 October.\n\nThe tricky thing is, though, that it looks very unlikely - maybe even impossible. And there are plenty of people in Westminster who say they're prepared to do everything necessary to stop Mr Johnson doing what he wants to do - taking the UK out without a deal on that date if one isn't agreed.\n\nParty conferences are pretty much always like being in a parallel universe, but this week is going to be something else.\n\nParliament will still be sitting while the Conservatives are gathering here in Manchester and it could certainly be a surreal and bumpy few days.\n\nMeanwhile, the Sunday Times has fresh allegations about the American businesswoman at the centre of claims about her links to the prime minister.\n\nThe paper claims Jennifer Arcuri told four friends that she had an affair with Mr Johnson while he was mayor of London.\n\nOn Friday, the Greater London Authority (GLA) referred Mr Johnson to the police watchdog over allegations Ms Arcuri, a US technology entrepreneur, received favourable treatment because of her friendship with him.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Inside the conference hall, the \"Get Brexit Done\" message was clear\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption But outside, protesters unhappy with Brexit and Conservative policies took to the streets\n\nShe joined trade missions led by Mr Johnson while he was mayor and her company received several thousand pounds in sponsorship grants.\n\nThe Independent Office for Police Conduct will now consider whether there are grounds to investigate the prime minister for the criminal offence of misconduct in public office.\n\nBut Mr Johnson insisted he had \"no interest to declare\" when pressed by Andrew Marr over whether he made his personal relationship with her known at the time.\n\n\"Everything was was done with full propriety,\" he added.\n\nThe PM also appeared to claim the story was politically motivated, saying someone in his position \"expects a lot of shot and shell\".\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Boris Johnson: 'Everything has been done with full propriety'\n\nAs well as promises on hospitals, the government is also announcing a new approach to NHS mental health treatment to be trialled in 12 areas of England - with housing and job support alongside psychological help.\n\nChancellor Sajid Javid is expected to speak on Monday and Home Secretary Priti Patel - talking about tackling crime - on Tuesday.\n\nAnimal welfare policies, environmental plans - including a proposed \u00a31bn fund to boost the electric motor industry and a pledge to plant one million new trees - are on the agenda.", "description": "Boris Johnson defends his conduct after he was accused by MPs of dismissing their abuse fears as \"humbug\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07pmscv.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
