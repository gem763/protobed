If we don\u2019t produce that speed of ball, we are under pressure.\u201d\n\nTownsend survived a 44-38 scare when his side last played Samoa in 2017 and he has also tasted defeat against Pacific islanders, losing 27-22 to Fiji earlier that year.", "description": "Before a humbling defeat to Ireland on Sunday, Gregor Townsend was statistically Scotland's most successful national rugby coach.", "authors": ["John Geddie", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434475308&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q0LN", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
