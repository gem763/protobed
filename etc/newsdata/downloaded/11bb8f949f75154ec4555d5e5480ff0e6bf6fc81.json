I think that is definitely the word,\u201d Rendon said. \u201cJust the fact we are in the playoffs and trying to make a run, that says a lot. It is not easy to make the playoffs. I think a lot of people overlook that. They think it is a piece of cake; it definitely is not.\u201d\n\nFor emphasis, Rendon noted his first postseason appearance came in 2014 for the Nationals.\n\nThat came in his second season while Scott Hairston, a teammate that year with Washington, was making his first playoff appearance in a career that began in 2004.\n\n\u201cThat was his first time making the playoffs,\u201d Rendon said.\n\nRendon was 1-for-2 with two sacrifice flies and three RBIs in the 6-1 win Monday over the Dodgers as the Nationals tied the series at 2-2. He will be a free agent after this season and has turned down offers from the Nationals, according to published reports.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
