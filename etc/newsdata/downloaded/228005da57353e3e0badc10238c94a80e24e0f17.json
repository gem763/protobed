This plant-based burger boasts a meat-like flavor and consistency\u2014it \u201cbleeds\u201d like rare beef when you cut or bite into it\u2014even though it is 100% meatless.\n\nThese characteristics can largely be attributed to heme, an iron-containing molecule found in every living thing on the planet. In people and animals, heme is a component of hemoglobin, and it\u2019s responsible for the distinct metallic flavor and smell of blood.\n\nHeme is also found to a lesser degree in plants. The key ingredient in the Impossible Burger is sourced from the root of the soy plant. The company isolates this gene and uses genetic engineering to multiply it many times over.\n\nAccording to the company, Impossible Foods\u2019, website, \u201cWe started by using the heme-containing protein from the roots of soy plants. It\u2019s called soy leghemoglobin. We took the DNA from soy plants and inserted it into a genetically engineered yeast. And we ferment this yeast\u2014very similar to the way Belgian beer is made. But instead of producing alcohol, our yeast multiply and produce a lot of heme.\u201d1\n\nThis meat-free burger is marketed as not only a healthier choice, but also a more environmentally responsible one. Let\u2019s look at each of these points.\n\nIs Plant-Based Meat Safe and Healthy?\n\nShockingly, approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is not required for most new food ingredients. Impossible Foods did run their own tests and concluded that soy leghemoglobin was safe, but they took it a step further and sought the FDA\u2019s blessing in 2014, to provide extra assurance to consumers.\n\nThat backfired, as the FDA initially refused to confirm its safety and instead requested more information. Millions of people eat soybeans with no issue, but the plant\u2019s roots, from which the heme is extracted, aren\u2019t generally consumed. The FDA had reservations, citing concerns about allergies and other potential adverse effects.\n\nAnother concern had to do with the soy leghemoglobin that was being extracted from the genetically modified yeast. It turns out it\u2019s not 100% pure, and contains additional strains of unidentified yeast proteins. Impossible Foods argued that based on centuries of safe consumption of whole yeast, these substances are likely safe.\n\nThey provided the FDA with results from a study in which rats were fed substantially more soy leghemoglobin than the amount found in a burger, without any obvious adverse effects. This sufficiently squelched any of the FDA\u2019s concerns, and they deemed this ingredient \u201cgenerally recognized as safe\u201d for human consumption in the summer of 2018.\n\nWhile the government and the company itself says lab-created meat is safe, it\u2019s really too soon to know for sure. After all, this is the first time ever that soy leghemoglobin (not only that\u2014a genetically engineered form of this molecule) has been introduced into our food supply. Because it didn\u2019t affect rats doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t affect people five or ten years down the line.\n\nWhat is pretty clear, though, is \u201cfaux meat\u201d will never be healthier than high-quality, sustainably farmed, grass-fed meat. You don\u2019t have to love or even eat meat to understand that the body will always respond better to real food than laboratory-created concoctions.\n\nGet My FREE Curcumin Report Chronic Inflammation Decoded\n\nAnd while it may be \u201cplant based,\u201d that is exactly what the Impossible Burger is\u2026a lab-created experiment. Case in point\u2026.the ingredient list on one of these burgers: Water, soy protein concentrate, coconut oil, sunflower oil, natural flavors, potato protein, methylcellulose, yeast extract, cultured dextrose, modified food starch, soy leghemoglobin, soy protein isolate, and various vitamins.2 It is the very definition of a genetically modified , highly processed food.\n\nWhat\u2019s the ingredient list on a plain, old hamburger? Beef.\n\nCertainly there is a major difference in the quality of meat, and some burgers (fast food, for instance) could qualify as science experiments with all the chemicals, preservatives, and other additives. But by and large, eating beef from cows that have been raised on pasture, allowed to roam around and eat their natural diet of grass, is infinitely healthier and more nutritious than eating beef sourced from confined cows forced to eat an unnatural diet of grains and pumped full on antibiotics.\n\nWhich brings up the next point\u2026\n\nIs \u201cFaux Meat\u201d Environmentally Friendly?\n\nImpossible Foods and competitors (such as Beyond Meat, which is sold in grocery stores rather than as a menu item in restaurants) claim plant-based burgers are better for the planet because they have less environmental impact.\n\nIt is true\u2014industrial scale farming of livestock is taking a toll on the earth. Livestock occupies \u00bc of the Earth\u2019s land. The production of animal feed uses \u2153 of farmable land. The transport of meat is responsible for 18% of greenhouse gas emissions.3\n\nBut to say this plant-based burger is more environmentally friendly is a bit misleading. For one, the food manufacturing industry in general uses massive amounts of energy (which leads to carbon dioxide emissions) and materials (in this case, genetically engineered yeast).\n\nIf you want to make a positive impact on the environment with dietary changes, choose to go meatless a few days of the week. But rather than eating processed meat-like foods, go for organic fruits, vegetables, beans, lentils, and other whole foods that come directly from the earth\u2014better yet, a local farm or your own garden.\n\nAnd if and when you do eat meat, opt for grass-fed, pasture-raised varieties. Cows raised on grasslands instead of restricted feedlots provide some benefit to the environment. These animals are perfectly happy grazing land that is unsuitable for growing crops, giving that otherwise unusable land a purpose. Their grazing aerates the ground, encouraging the growth of more grass, and in turn, more oxygen into the atmosphere. Grazed land also has more carbon stored in its soil than other land\u2014forestland included. Stored carbon slows global warming. Even the cows\u2019 manure is beneficial when left in the fields. It simply integrates back into the soil and fertilizes it.\n\nAll food production\u2014whether it\u2019s agriculture, livestock farming, or manufacturing of processed foods\u2014has some impact on the planet. The goal is to minimize it as much as possible by making responsible choices.\n\nBottom line: \u201cFaux meat\u201d is definitely an interesting and intriguing concept. Lots of people will try the Impossible Burger and its competitors (Beyond Meat, etc.) out of sheer curiosity\u2014and doing so once in a while isn\u2019t going to hurt you (unless of course you have an allergy to gluten, wheat or soy\u2014then avoid them fully). But making a habit of eating any kind of highly processed, manufactured food on the regular\u2014whether it\u2019s chips, Cheetos, sodas, or plant-based burgers\u2014isn\u2019t doing your body and overall health any favors. For ultimate wellness, stick to real food.\n\nReferences\n\nDid You Enjoy This Article?
