That means the attacker can pull the recordings to his server and listen to what was said. They gain complete control of the server,\" he added.\n\nSnooping on that metadata could potentially be used for the purposes of espionage, but the attacker can also use Asterisk to spoof calls to look as if they come from the compromised Asterisk user.\n\nThe attacker covered their tracks, so it wasn't possible to identity who they called from the compromised system or why.\n\nCheck Point told ZDNet the research has been disclosed to Asterisk and that the vulnerability which enables the attack to take place was patched before the attack was first spotted. Researchers recommend that users apply patches to software, operating systems and servers to keep systems as secure as possible.\n\nZDNet contacted Asterisk for comment, but hadn't received a response at the time of publication.\n\nREAD MORE ON CYBER CRIME\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "Researchers uncover a campaign which is snooping on call data and recordings of conversations - and could even spoof calls.", "authors": ["Danny Palmer"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/04/fc83b2e4-09cb-40e6-8587-b1b9dc62f16a/thumbnail/770x578/2ab60a7084134e14d20592c153d12067/istock-worker-making-a-call-using-a-headset.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
