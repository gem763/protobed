But You Know That Already.", "language": "en", "text": "The truth is not news: For personal health, for lives to be less threatened by changing climate, people must eat differently. How to do this is not debatable \u2014 more plants, fewer animals, less junk \u2014 yet those who profit from the status quo will fight those changes through marketing and obfuscation of facts.\n\nConsider what happened with tobacco. It was thought to be dangerous in the \u201830s; it was proved to cause lung cancer in 1948; the surgeon general warned us in 1964; and then there was the 1988 states\u2019 attorneys generals\u2019 Master Settlement Agreement, which, among other things, limited the marketing of tobacco. This last was effective because it actually made it more difficult to smoke. For all the talk about industrial agriculture being a contributor to climate change, for all the talk about the dangers of ultra-processed foods, the reaction has largely been more talk and almost no action.\n\nCounting on a couple of billion heavy meat-eaters to respond to someone\u2019s eloquence and cut back their meat consumption by 90 percent (the recommended amount, to have real impact) is not a plan. It is, rather, a plea. In his chapter \u201cDispute With the Soul,\u201d Foer blames \u201chuman nature.\u201d Because of it, \u201cpeople like me, who should care and should be motivated and should make big changes, find it almost impossible to make small sacrifices for profound future benefit.\u201d The argument for individuals to eat better isn\u2019t wrong, but it encourages \u201cpeople like me\u201d \u2014 wealthy people, almost all white \u2014 to become better shoppers while leaving others behind. Not everyone can make the same decisions.\n\nHuman nature is not the reason that our diet consists of large amounts of meat and junk food; availability, access and marketing determine that. For people to eat and act differently, different tools, beneficial rather than exploitative, must be employed. This is about supply, not demand. If cheeseburgers are everywhere, and always priced lower than health-enhancing meals, and we have been trained from birth to \u201cenjoy\u201d them, we will continue to eat cheeseburgers. The easiest way for us to eat fewer cheeseburgers is to produce fewer cheeseburgers, or at least to price them at their true cost, one that includes their contributions to climate change, public health, environmental degradation and so on. (This would make them prohibitively expensive.)\n\nHigh-tech fake meat isn\u2019t the answer, because even though vegan ultra-processed food doesn\u2019t kill animals it kills people and furthers climate change. And, if you\u2019re wanting to turn around the climate crisis, you have to go beyond food: If fossil fuels are widely available and cheap, and there aren\u2019t better options, people will continue to drive and fly. Guilt-tripping isn\u2019t a huge change-maker.\n\nBill McKibben\u2019s 2016 New Republic article, \u201cA World at War,\u201d in which he urged us to treat the climate crisis as we did World War II, presents the soundest argument to date: Climate change is a crisis, and we need government to lead us in attacking it. We also need government to lead in attacking the food crisis: We need new laws and stronger enforcement of existing ones that will make it difficult or impossible for industrial animal production to remain profitable; we need to make it easy to buy food produced by sustainable, even regenerative farming; and we need to make it inexpensive for people to buy or be served that kind of food, perhaps in what amounts to communal kitchens \u2014 a different way of doing \u201cfast food.\u201d Generally, we need to limit exploitation \u2014 to tax and even break up the agribusinesses responsible for ecocide and the increasingly global epidemic of chronic disease \u2014 and we need to enhance cooperation.", "description": "In his new essay collection, \u201cWe Are the Weather,\u201d Jonathan Safran Foer turns his attention to the climate crisis.
