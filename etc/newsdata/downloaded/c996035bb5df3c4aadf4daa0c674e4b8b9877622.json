Pictures/AP)\n\nThe mind of an alienated young loner builds toward a delusional boil. Robert De Niro appears in this gritty city narrative, in which a political candidate promises to make the electorate great again.\n\nThat is the tale of \u201cTaxi Driver,\u201d Martin Scorsese\u2019s bloody bicentennial-year release that remains bracingly relevant. But that description also applies to Todd Phillips\u2019s \u201cJoker,\u201d which stars Joaquin Phoenix as the deranged, gun-toting \u201cvigilante\u201d opposite De Niro \u2014 and draws inspiration from \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d and other urban outcast movies of that era.\n\nThe two films have something else in common: \u201cJoker,\u201d like \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d four decades ago, has stirred roiling controversy over its depictions of violence and hate. The discourse continues even as the movie is projected to gross more than $75 million in its domestic debut this weekend \u2014 and has so far been cast as both pop-culture villain and victim, depending on whom you ask.\n\n\u201cThe whole issue about the violence in the movie kind of exploded,\u201d \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d star Jodie Foster told the Hollywood Reporter in 2016, in recalling how her movie was both booed and cheered at Cannes, where it received the Palme d\u2019Or before going on to receive a best picture Oscar nomination.\n\nNow, Phillips\u2019s film \u2014 set in the Batman family\u2019s Gotham City of the early \u201980s \u2014 is also making headlines for its subject matter against the backdrop of real-world terrorism, including recent mass shootings in Texas, Ohio and California.\n\nThe questions are coming rapid-fire from so many commentators and online commenters: Is this the wrong movie at the wrong time? Does \u201cJoker\u201d glamorize a killer or simply hold a mirror to society? Will this portrayal be embraced by other sick young men bent on justifying their violence?\n\nIn response, the director has gone on the defensive in his remarks. On Wednesday, after \u201cJoker\u201d screened at the New York Film Festival, Phillips said it is \u201cvery responsible\u201d for his film to affix real-world implications to violence, adding: \u201cIsn\u2019t that a good thing to take away the cartoon element of violence that we\u2019ve become so immune to?\"\n\nJust a few weeks ago, \u201cJoker\u201d was picking up the best film prize at the Venice Film Festival; now, its studio, Warner Bros., has limited journalistic access to the movie\u2019s talent, perhaps to avoid adding fuel to any public-relations fires \u2014 though all the headlines could help stoke its box office. (The studio did not make Phillips, his co-writer and the producers available for this story.)\n\nAfter seeing \u201cJoker\u201d in Venice, Vanity Fair critic Richard Lawson wrote that the film \u201cmay be irresponsible propaganda for the very men it pathologizes. Is 'Joker\u2019 celebratory or horrified? Or is there simply no difference?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s perfectly fair for critics and fans to question whether or not this is the right film at the right time,\u201d says Andrew Farago, co-author, with Gina McIntyre, of the new book \u201cBatman: The Definitive History of the Dark Knight in Comics, Film, and Beyond,\u201d \u201cand it\u2019s perfectly fair for the filmmakers to engage in that discussion however they see fit.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s an important discussion to have,\u201d Farago adds, \u201cwhether you view the film as a reflection of modern society or the wrong film at the wrong time, or as simple escapism.\u201d\n\n\n\nJoaquin Phoenix, left, and director Todd Phillips attend the \"Joker\" premiere at Alice Tully Hall during the New York Film Festival on Wednesday. (Brent N. Clarke/Invision/AP)\n\n\u201cJoker\u201d has faced more scrutiny than other recent films that have evil clowns (\u201cIt\u201d) or high body counts (the \u201cJohn Wick\u201d franchise) or even other Joker movies (\u201cSuicide Squad\u201d). Some comics-industry experts believe that\u2019s because \u201cJoker\u201d checks so many boxes of pointed public debate, including guns, mass shootings and mental illness \u2014 even as Phillips has chalked up some of the response to outrage being \u201ca commodity.\"\n\n\u201cJoker\u201d is also stirring memories of the tragedy around another Gotham-set film, the 2012 Aurora, Colo., mass shooting that killed 12 people at a screening of Warner Bros./DC\u2019s \u201cThe Dark Knight Rises.\u201d The new film won\u2019t screen at that theater after Aurora victims\u2019 relatives raised concerns about the film\u2019s gun violence.\n\nWarner Bros. released a statement last month in response to those concerns, saying that the studio \u201cbelieves that one of the functions of storytelling is to provoke difficult conversations around complex issues.\u201d\n\n\u201cMake no mistake: neither the fictional character Joker, nor the film, is an endorsement of real-world violence of any kind,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIt is not the intention of the film, the filmmakers or the studio to hold this character up as a hero.\u201d\n\nAuthor Brad Meltzer, whose work includes crime fiction and the Justice League of America, notes how the Batman associations to the Aurora massacre are still with us. \u201cEven though it\u2019s been proven that the shooter in that Colorado theater wasn\u2019t dressed as the Joker,\u201d he says \u2014 referring to a rumor that the shooter\u2019s appearance and utterances were inspired by the Joker \u2014 \u201cthe images and pain still rightfully linger.\u201d\n\n\u201cJoker\u2019s\u201d homage to \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d bears the reminder of another violent attack: a fan\u2019s obsession with the 1976 movie, including with the then-12-year-old Foster, preceded his assassination attempt of President Ronald Reagan.\n\n\u201cJoker\u201d arrives as the United States averages more than one mass shooting per day. Security presence at the film\u2019s screenings, in such cities as New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, will be increased, according to reports.\n\nFor all the headlines, \u201cJoker\u201d is hardly an outlier. \u201cThere\u2019s a long tradition in pop culture of audiences embracing antiheroes and, in many cases, outright villains, and taking away a completely different message than the filmmakers intended,\u201d says Farago, curator of the Cartoon Art Museum in San Francisco. \u201cComic and movie fans online quote Heath Ledger\u2019s Joker and Tom Hardy\u2019s Bane much more readily than Christian Bale\u2019s Batman. Readers see Rorschach in Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons\u2019s comic \u2018Watchmen\u2019 as a cool action hero and not a damaged sociopath.\u201d\n\nThe Joker has had many incarnations since making his comic-book debut in 1940. Jerry Robinson, the co-creator of the character, said during a Washington Post interview a decade ago that he marveled at how Ledger mined the villain for fresh depths in 2008\u2032s \u201cThe Dark Knight.\u201d And \u201cJoker\u201d executive producer Michael E. Uslan said in June that after seeing images from \u201cThe Shining,\u201d he knew Jack Nicholson could deliver a darkly maniacal performance as the Joker \u2014 two decades after Cesar Romero played the Clown Prince of Crime for campy laughs in TV\u2019s \u201cBatman.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the things about the Joker is, it\u2019s so easy for people to project anything onto that adaptable character,\u201d says Travis Langley, a Henderson State University psychologist and author of the new book \u201cThe Joker Psychology: Evil Clowns and the Women Who Love Them.\"\n\nLangley notes that Phillips has even given his Joker an array of traits and symptoms that suggest no single mental disorder, further underscoring the character\u2019s mutability.\n\nUnlike the more cartoonish interpretations of the Joker, Phoenix\u2019s performance feels more rooted in the real \u2014 and such near-realism can disturb the viewer more than art painted in broad genre strokes, industry experts say.\n\n\u201cI think the moment scary entertainment seems \u2018real,\u2019 it moves into a different part of our consciousness,\u201d Meltzer says. \u201cEscapism disappears, and we\u2019re left with real fear.\u201d\n\nThen, \u201cwhen it feels too much like real life, the smiles disappear, which really is the point of the Joker,\u201d he says. \u201cThe character is meant to make you uncomfortable.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nHow Tim Burton\u2019s \u2018Batman\u2019 radically changed the superhero-movie landscape 30 years ago\n\nOur definitive ranking of Joker performances, from Jack Nicholson to Joaquin Phoenix", "description": "The Joaquin Phoenix film about the Batman villain has faced blowback for its portrayal of violence.", "authors": ["Michael Cavna", "Writer Artist For Comic Riffs", "Covering Visual Storytelling", "Cartoon Art Illustration", "Comedy Satire", "October At Pm", "Writer Artist Visual Storyteller Michael Cavna Is Creator Of The Comic Riffs Column", "Graphic-Novel Reviewer For The Washington Post'S Book World."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/qLweiTgWeBFBVmpEu25lybu_hDc=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XNX5UOMO2NARHN5XIT2DTQJP6M.jpg"}
