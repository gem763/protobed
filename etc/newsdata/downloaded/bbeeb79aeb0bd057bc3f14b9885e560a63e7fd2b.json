Note the \u201cpotentially more.\u201d The source in Dallas wasn\u2019t sure a first- and two second-rounders would have closed the deal because the Jets seemed reticent from the start to move Adams. So much so that it seemed likely the Jets would have pushed for another pick or even a player if Dallas had indeed offered a first-rounder and two second-round picks.\n\nJets star Jamal Adams was the hottest name on the trade market in the hours before the deadline. (USA TODAY Sports)\n\nUltimately, the source said Dallas was prepared to send as much as a first-round pick and either a depth player or some kind of pick swap involving a fourth-rounder for Adams. Talks hit a wall when it became apparent the Jets weren\u2019t willing to move off an asking price that may have risen further than what was reported in the media. Ultimately, the Cowboys believed the Jets\u2019 \u201cdeal-sealing\u201d price was going to land in a zip code close to the two first-round picks the Oakland Raiders received for Mack in 2018 and the two firsts the Jacksonville Jaguars received for Ramsey earlier this month. Dallas recognizes Adams as a special young safety \u2014 it just wasn\u2019t ready to place him in a class with Ramsey, who is arguably the best young cover cornerback in the NFL, and Mack, who is one of the most disruptive edge rushers in the league.\n\n\n\nThe source added that the possibility of a deal for Adams presented itself only in the last week, after Dallas began squaring up teams that might be open to shedding talent in the midst of a rebuild. The Jets became a priority after it became apparent that a large portion of the roster was open for trade discussion. Dallas was relatively surprised when an inquiry into Adams wasn\u2019t the flat \u201cno\u201d that the Cowboys anticipated. That prompted the Cowboys to make some conceptual offers before the Jets ultimately began pricing the trade out of range. Even something close to the Mack or Ramsey compensation wasn\u2019t going to happen, even for a safety featuring as much talent as Adams.\n\n\n\nThere was an undercurrent to the Cowboys\u2019 refusal, and it had everything to do with the future. With the team fully committed to extending Dak Prescott and Amari Cooper \u2014 as well as a handful of other 2020 free agents who are expected to get competitive offers elsewhere \u2014 ownership is acutely aware that draft capital (and financially viable depth) will be at a premium the next few seasons.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nStory continues\n\nThe bottom line: With Prescott coming off a cheap contract and Dallas expected to be shouldering steep deals at quarterback, wide receiver, running back, defensive end and the totality of the offensive line, the Cowboys will have to add layers of depth through the draft rather than free agency.\n\n\n\nMore than anything, that\u2019s why Adams isn\u2019t a Cowboy today.\n\n\n\nSome other revelations from the deadline:\n\nWhat is Jets\u2019 roster plan after listening to offers for Jamal Adams?\n\nThe Jets even listening to an offer on Adams \u2014 which wasn\u2019t well-received by the safety \u2014 speaks volumes about how new general manager Joe Douglas is feeling about his roster. Douglas has been getting an on-the-job evaluation of New York\u2019s roster for roughly five months, and it\u2019s now clear he\u2019s open to swapping out basically any cornerstone except for quarterback Sam Darnold.\n\nThat suggests this could be more of a tear-down and rebuild than first thought, but also more in line with what we\u2019ve seen from the franchise over the past several years. Douglas has enough of a reputation to have earned some trust when he\u2019s signaling that things are a bigger mess than he anticipated. And that seems to be what he was indicating at the trade deadline.\n\nPerhaps akin to what the San Francisco 49ers engaged with the arrival of general manager John Lynch and coach Kyle Shanahan in 2017, I\u2019d expect 80 percent of this roster (or more) to be turned over by the end of the 2021 season.\n\nBroncos wanted second-round pick for Chris Harris Jr.\n\nThe Broncos oddly priced themselves out of the market on Chris Harris Jr. One team that checked in on Harris in the past week confirmed Tuesday night that Denver was fishing for a second-round pick and didn\u2019t seem inclined to move off the price.\n\nIn a soft trade market for cornerbacks, that price didn\u2019t draw interest.\n\nThe takeaway is either Denver is intent on making a run to keep Harris, or the Broncos assume they can land some kind of solid compensatory pick when Harris leaves and doesn\u2019t want a defensive mutiny on their hands down the stretch.\n\nGeneral manager John Elway may believe he can\u2019t afford the latter, given how poorly this season has already gone.\n\nEagles landed Genard Avery, a player Jets\u2019 Gregg Williams was eyeing\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles didn\u2019t land the big one, but they might have gotten a nice piece anyway. A league source said Jets defensive coordinator Gregg Williams coveted Cleveland Browns defensive end Genard Avery, who he believes can be a very good pass rusher in the right scheme. Unfortunately for Williams, the Browns weren\u2019t interested in dealing Avery to the Jets \u2014 quite possibly because Browns general manager John Dorsey and Williams didn\u2019t leave on the best of terms after Williams was passed over for Freddie Kitchens for Cleveland\u2019s head coaching choice.\n\nDorsey was apparently OK shipping Avery to the Eagles, where he\u2019ll get ample opportunity to rush the passer in Jim Schwartz\u2019s scheme. Avery might not be a world-beater, but Williams likes his pass rushers to be tenacious and have an edge. That Williams continued to covet Avery after leaving Cleveland says something about what the Eagles landed this week.\n\nTrent Williams remains with Washington. (USA TODAY Sports)\n\n\n\n\n\nRedskins, Bengals send baffling signals\n\nThe poorly performing front offices seem to get get exposed at the deadline. A play in two acts ...\n\n\n\nAct I: The Washington Redskins. They decided at the last moment to listen to offers on offensive tackle Trent Williams, mystifying other teams that had been interested for weeks. The Browns in particular had a gripe after trying for more than six weeks to get Washington to engage in talks about Williams to no avail. One source told Yahoo Sports on Tuesday that Cleveland would likely have surrendered a first-round pick for Williams at the start of the season if Washington had opened the floor for offers. It didn\u2019t until the last possible moment, and the Browns weren\u2019t obliged to engage by the time Washington finally opened for business.\n\n\n\nAct II: The Cincinnati Bengals. One league source was mystified over the Bengals choosing this week to bench Andy Dalton, when doing the deed one week earlier might have signaled that the franchise was ready to move on from aging veterans. Instead, Cincinnati waited to bench Dalton and then never got involved with other franchises at the deadline. That left multiple teams to wonder exactly what the plan is in Cincinnati.\n\nThe franchise is going to be in the running for the No. 1 overall pick all season. Now it\u2019s going to lose some pieces in free agency that would have drawn some draft ammunition on the market (the New Orleans Saints would have loved a shot at A.J. Green). Meanwhile, Cincinnati will get nothing in the long run. And if that lack of activity wasn\u2019t damning enough, it\u2019s worth noting elements of ownership \u2014 including some who comprise the front office \u2014 were on vacation in Europe on Tuesday.\n\n\n\nWill Aqib Talib play a down for the Dolphins?\n\nOne source familiar with the Aqib Talib deal from the Los Angeles Rams to the Miami Dolphins said he believes Talib will never step on the field for the Dolphins and that reality may have been part of the deal getting consummated. Talib had previously nixed a trade with the Rams and yet didn\u2019t protest being sent to Miami in what was a clear salary dump by the Rams in exchange for gifting the Dolphins a fifth-round pick.\n\nWhy would he do that?\n\nAs the source put it, likely because Miami will be OK with him never playing a down for the franchise.\n\nEagles valued depth that Vaitai provided them\n\nThe other somewhat odd development: Eagles offensive tackle Halapoulivaati Vaitai staying put. There were a number of teams making calls on offensive line depth and Vaitai was a prime candidate for a deal. But one source suggested on Tuesday that Eagles general manager Howie Roseman was more interested in keeping Vaitai around for depth purposes and potentially gaining whatever compensatory pick he might land when the Eagles inevitably lose the offensive lineman in free agency.\n\nIt\u2019s a fair assessment if Roseman wants to backstop his guard and tackle spots as much as possible for a potential postseason run.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "A source told Yahoo Sports that Dallas never came close to the Jets\u2019 best price of a first-round pick, two future second-rounders and potentially more.", "authors": ["Charles Robinson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/YSNpvynm0kfR4MKw1F9iOA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD05NTIuNTMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/vzpCBcWMFPQct0RDTC7g_A--~B/aD0yODc1O3c9Mzg2MztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/072b3f00-fada-11e9-ae72-f816182e17f1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
