In short, he explained to Harry that the NHS was able to \u201cadvance order\u201d these medicines from Europe but Harry would have to pay for this up front.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nHe said the NHS would pay him the money back in three equal instalments in November, December and January.\n\nHarry asked why he had to pay. He had not done this before.\n\nThe caller explained it was the only way the NHS was allowed to advance order medicines for \u00adindividuals. Harry agreed and asked how much he needed to pay.\n\nThe caller then asked Harry to confirm what the cleared balance was of all his bank and building society accounts. He explained that he had to note this to satisfy his bosses that he was not taking too much money from patients.\n\nHarry had a total of \u00a325,312, some of which was in a savings \u00adaccount. He was then told he \u00adneeded to transfer \u00a318,000 and the account details were provided. He has never heard from the caller again and, of course, has not \u00adreceived any medicine.\n\nFor clarity, the NHS are not running any such scheme and \u00adcertainly would not ask you to pay money like this.\n\nI have advised Harry to speak to his bank and explain the fraud.\n\nHarry\u2019s son Graham contacted me about this. I\u2019ve heard of a few Brexit scams but this is the worst.", "description": "It started when Harry received a phone call from a man who announced himself as being from the \u201cNHS Brexit Team\u201d", "authors": ["Dean Dunham", "Image", "Getty Images", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20141953.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_High-Street-Chemists-At-Risk-From-The-Governments-NHS-Cuts.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
