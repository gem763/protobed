His effort was low and firm, but saved by QPR goalkeeper Liam Kelly.\n\nKelly was again called into action to deny the lively Ejaria, who'd taken two Rangers defenders out of the game with a neat cut-back just outside the box before forcing a fingertip save.\n\nRangers may have started the evening in the play-off places following back-to-back wins over Blackburn Rovers and Hull City but it was a good half-hour before they seriously threatened.\n\nQPR's lead evaporated minutes after Wells's opener when George Puscas slotted to make it 1-1\n\nSeason at a glance Live tables\n\nFixtures\n\nScores Championship\n\nPremier League\n\nChampionship\n\nLeague One\n\nLeague Two\n\nScottish Premiership\n\nScottish Div 1\n\nScottish Div 2\n\nScottish Div 3\n\nLigue 1\n\nSerie A\n\nLa Liga\n\nBundesliga\n\n\n\n\n\nThere were loud penalty appeals from players and crowd alike when Wells struck his shot against Yiadom in the Reading box. Referee Jeremy Simpson appeared to raise his whistle to his lips before thinking better of it.\n\nBut nobody of a QPR persuasion thought any more about it when they took the lead four minutes later.\n\nReading were the architects of their own downfall, squandering possession inside their own half and allowing the ever-dangerous Ebere Eze to advance towards their box.\n\nEze played a pass into Wells, who cleverly allowed the ball to come across his body before rifling a low shot inside the near post from 20 yards for his eighth of the season.\n\nBut celebrations were short-lived as Reading equalised just a couple of minutes later. It came from the breakdown of a QPR attack and owed everything to the vision of Ejaria, whose through pass from deep to set Puscas scampering clear was a thing of beauty.\n\nThe Romanian striker was on half-way when the ball was played and he surged clear of Toni Leistner to slot the ball home off the inside of the far post with Kelly committed.\n\nQPR started the second-half with renewed intent and Ryan Manning swung a free-kick across the Reading box that four hooped shirts failed to gamble on.\n\nBut there was no mistake just before the hour. Hugill outmuscled John Swift to win a flick-on and Wells knocked the ball back into his path.\n\nFellow loanee Jordan Hugill thought he had won it with a volley before Baldock netted late on\n\nHugill let fly from just outside the box, his strike taking a deflection off Liam Moore that deceived keeper Rafael Cabral to find the net.\n\nAfter Reading's second leveller, both sides, to their credit, went for victory. Yoann Barbet smashed a free-kick into the wall before Baldock fired wide at the other end.\n\n'I sense a resilience in the them, they're a group that's desperate to do well for this club and the fans,' said Bowen.\n\n'I hate that label that you play Reading and it's going to be a nice game of football. Well, sod that, we want to be a hard team to beat, I want to be nasty.'", "description": "ADAM SHERGOLD AT LOFTUS ROAD: Sam Baldock scored 15 minutes from time to rescue a point for the Royals as QPR only had themselves to blame for defensive complacency.", "authors": ["Adam Shergold For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/22/20056080-0-image-a-105_1571778937688.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
