The murder was caught on CCTV, and, although Gunn used every effort to conceal his identity, the police were able to use reports of local burglaries and various parts of CCTV footage to piece together his movements in the stolen car and eventually trace and arrest him.\n\n\"This case has had a real impact on the local community - particularly those who knew Ravi Katharkamar and were regular customers to his shop.\n\n\"I hope today's conviction provides the family and friends of Mr Katharkamar with some degree of comfort.\"", "description": "Alex Gunn, 31, was caught on CCTV stabbing Ravi Katharkamar, 54, in north-west London on March 24", "authors": ["Emily Pennink", "Chiara Fiorillo", "Image", "Central News"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20537715.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-cnl_R_Katharkamar.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
