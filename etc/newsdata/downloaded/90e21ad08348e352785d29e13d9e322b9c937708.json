Bolton was tentatively booked to appear on a pair of Sunday talk shows in late August but backed out, saying he was not comfortable with some of the administration\u2019s plans, and that drew the president\u2019s ire, according to a White House official not authorized to discuss private conversations\n\nAlso, tensions have risen between Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo over influence in the president\u2019s orbit and how to manage the president\u2019s desire to negotiate with some of the world\u2019s most unsavory actors.\n\nSince joining the administration in the spring of last year, Bolton has espoused skepticism about the president\u2019s whirlwind rapprochement with North Korea and has advocated against Trump\u2019s decision last year to pull U.S. troops out of Syria. He masterminded a quiet campaign inside the administration and with allies abroad to persuade Trump to keep U.S. forces in Syria to counter the remnants of the Islamic State and Iranian influence in the region.\n\nBolton was also opposed to Trump\u2019s now-scrapped notion to bring Taliban negotiators to Camp David last weekend to try to finalize a peace deal in Afghanistan.\n\nOne Republican familiar with the disagreements between Trump and Bolton said the adviser\u2019s opposition to a possible meeting between Trump and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani was a precipitating factor in the dismissal. French President Emmanuel Macron has been trying to broker such a meeting, possibly on the sidelines of the upcoming U.N. General Assembly, in the hope of salvaging the international Iran nuclear deal that Trump withdrew from.\n\nIn Tehran, Hesameddin Ashena an adviser to Rouhani said in a tweet that dismissal of Bolton was a result of the \u201cresistance\u201d of Iran, adding that \u201ccornering and omitting Bolton is a strong sign of failure of maximal pressure policy of the U.S.\u201d\n\nPompeo said Trump has been clear that he is willing to meet with Rouhani \u201cwith no preconditions.\u201d Speaking at an unrelated briefing at the White House, Pompeo acknowledged that he had often disagreed with Bolton on issues.\n\n\u201cThere were many times that Ambassador Bolton and I disagreed. That\u2019s to be sure,\u201d Pompeo said.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who appeared with Pompeo, said: \u201cThe president\u2019s view of the Iraq war and Ambassador Bolton\u2019s was very different.\u201d\n\nAsked if world leaders should expect changes in Trump\u2019s foreign policies going forward, Pompeo replied: \u201cI don\u2019t think any leader around the world should make any assumption that because some one of us departs that President Trump\u2019s foreign policy will change in a material way.\u201d\n\nBolton and his National Security Council staff were also viewed warily by some in the White House who viewed them as more attuned to their own agendas than the president\u2019s \u2014 and some administration aides have accused Bolton\u2019s staff of being behind leaks of information embarrassing to Trump.\n\nBolton\u2019s ouster came as a surprise to many in the White House. Just an hour before Trump\u2019s tweet, the press office announced that Bolton would join Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in a briefing. A White House official said that Bolton had departed the premises after Trump\u2019s tweet and would no longer appear as scheduled.\n\nIn a further sign of acrimonious relationship, a person close to Bolton told reporters that they had been authorized to say one thing \u2014 that since Bolton has been national security adviser there have been no \u201cbad deals\u201d on Iran, North Korea, Russia, and Syria. The person, who did not divulge who had given the authorization, was not allowed to discuss the issue by name and spoke only on condition of anonymity.\n\nWhen asked to respond to the person\u2019s comment, White House press secretary Grisham smiled and told reporters: \u201cI don\u2019t know how to read\u201d it. \u201cSounds like just somebody trying to protect him,\u201d she added.\n\nSen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said the move was a cause for worry.\n\n\u201cJohn Bolton was the wrong choice and the silver lining to this instability is that there will be fewer people whispering war chants in the president\u2019s ear,\u201d said Murphy. \u201cBut no one of any quality is going to take a job in the nation\u2019s national security cabinet so long as everyone\u2019s head is permanently hovering slightly above the chopping block.\u201d\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, who was traveling with Trump Monday, said reports of Bolton\u2019s dissent on the Taliban meeting was a \u201cbridge too far\u201d for Trump.\n\nLater, in a statement, Graham, a close ally of Trump\u2019s, said Bolton pursued an agenda that helped the president and protected U.S. national security. But he also said, \u201cPresident Trump, like every other president, has the right to a national security adviser of his own choosing.\u201d\n\nWhite House spokesman Hogan Gidley said Charles Kupperman, the deputy national security adviser and a former Reagan administration official and defense contracting executive, would fill Bolton\u2019s role on an acting basis. Trump said he would name a replacement for Bolton next week.\n\nBolton was named Trump\u2019s third national security adviser in March 2018 after the departure of Army Gen. H.R. McMaster.\n\nBolton was always an unlikely pick to be Trump\u2019s third national security adviser, with a world view seemingly ill-fit to the president\u2019s isolationist \u201cAmerica First\u201d pronouncements.\n\nHe\u2019s championed hawkish foreign policy views dating back to the Reagan administration and became a household name over his vociferous support for the Iraq War as the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. under George W. Bush. Bolton briefly considered running for president in 2016, in part to make the case against the isolationism that Trump would come to embody.\n\nStill, Trump has admired Bolton for years, praising him on Twitter as far back as 2014. Trump has told allies he thinks Bolton is \u201ca killer\u201d on television, where Bolton is a frequent face on Fox News, though the president has voiced some unhappiness about Bolton\u2019s trademark mustache.\n\n___\n\nAP writers Matthew Lee and Jonathan Lemire contributed.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "President Donald Trump has fired national security adviser John Bolton and noted they \"disagreed strongly.\"", "authors": ["Zeke Miller", "Deb Riechmann"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/gettyimages-1164625864.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1"}
