These can be sold for many industrial applications.\n\nThis month hydrogen was declared by Germany\u2019s economy minister as having great potential for the country\u2019s energy transition.\n\nGermany is committed to cutting CO2 emissions by 55% from 1990 levels by the year 2030.", "description": "German oil and gas company Wintershall DEA is to study turning natural gas into hydrogen and splitting off the carbon to help reduce CO2 emissions as part of its quest to remain a key energy player as climate laws demand alternatives to fossil fuels.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
