The comedy, which is set in Germany during World War II, follows a devoted young member of the Hitler Youth (Roman Griffin Davis) who, after discovering that his mother (Scarlett Johansson) is hiding a young Jewish girl in their attic, begins to rethink his ideology. Oh yeah, and Adolf Hitler (Waititi) is there as an increasingly idiotic imaginary friend. Noah Baumbach\u2019s devastating divorce drama, Marriage Story, came in second place, while Bong Joon-ho\u2019s nerve-wracking thriller, Parasite, finished in third. Historically, whoever wins TIFF\u2019s People\u2019s Choice Award goes on to achieve significant award-season success \u2014 and sometimes even a Best Picture win, which is what happened with Green Book last year.
