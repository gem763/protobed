The city claims he had no constitutional rights.", "language": "en", "text": "Now, attorneys for the city of Southaven are using an unusual approach to try to convince a federal judge to dismiss the $20 million civil rights lawsuit filed by Lopez\u2019s widow. They argue that because the victim was an undocumented immigrant, he wasn\u2019t protected by the U.S. Constitution.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re stunned that someone put this in writing,\u201d Murray Wells, an attorney representing Lopez\u2019s estate, told reporters at a Thursday news conference.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that people present in the United States have certain basic rights, regardless of their immigration status, affirming in two frequently cited rulings that undocumented immigrants can\u2019t be denied an education or due process in a court of law.\n\nBut attorneys for the small city near Memphis claim that because Lopez had no \u201clegally recognized relationship\u201d with the United States, he had no rights under the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures, or the 14th Amendment, which guarantees equal protection to all citizens.\n\n\u201cIf he ever had Fourth Amendment or Fourteenth Amendment civil rights, they were lost by his own conduct and misconduct,\u201d attorney Katherine S. Kerby wrote in a brief filed Sept. 4. \u201cIsmael Lopez may have been a person on American soil but he was not one of the \u2018We, the People of the United States\u2019 entitled to the civil rights invoked in this lawsuit.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPolice shot and killed a man while trying to serve a warrant \u2014 at the wrong house\n\nAt Thursday\u2019s news conference, attorneys representing Lopez\u2019s family called the strategy \u201cchilling,\u201d \u201cludicrous\u201d and \u201cinsane.\u201d The city\u2019s argument, Wells said, amounted to telling undocumented immigrants that \u201cstormtroopers can come into your house and kill you\u201d without any repercussions.\n\nThe battle over legal standing is only the latest controversy surrounding Lopez\u2019s death, which sparked protests in the northern Mississippi community and angered many Latino residents.\n\nAs The Washington Post\u2019s Radley Balko previously wrote in an analysis of the case, police have claimed that Lopez cracked open the door to his house and pointed a gun at them, which his attorneys and his wife say is untrue. It\u2019s also unclear whether the mechanic knew that the men who showed up unexpectedly at his home were police officers: DeSoto County District Attorney John Champion has said that he doesn\u2019t believe the officers announced themselves before opening fire on Lopez and his pit bull after the dog ran out of the mobile home.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn July 2018, a grand jury declined to indict the officers involved in the fatal shooting, an outcome that outraged Lopez\u2019s friends and family. Last June, Claudia Linares, Lopez\u2019s widow, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi.\n\nMississippi cops went to the wrong house and killed an innocent man. A grand jury just refused to indict them.\n\nIn court filings, attorneys for the city have argued Linares lacks the standing to sue because she, too, is an undocumented immigrant. They also claim that she was not legally married to Lopez, while simultaneously accusing her of being married to two men at the same time and referring to her as a \u201cbigamous paramour.\u201d Linares\u2019s legal team says that those charges are both false and extremely offensive, and last week filed a marriage certificate showing that the two were married in Arkansas in 2003.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a real shame that they have to use these tactics to soil someone\u2019s name when she lost her partner, the love of her life, in a tragic accident,\u201d attorney Aaron Neglia said at Thursday\u2019s news conference.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn a statement shared with local media outlets, Southaven Mayor Darren Musselwhite replied that the city \u201cwill defend this matter in the court of law, not in the media via press conferences with ridiculously-misleading sound bites.\"\n\nKerby, the city\u2019s attorney, has argued that there\u2019s a legal precedent for saying that undocumented immigrants lack certain constitutional rights. In a Thursday interview with the Memphis Commercial Appeal, she pointed to a 1990 Supreme Court case, United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, where justices ruled that the Fourth Amendment does not protect foreigners against unreasonable search and seizure when they are in foreign territory or international waters, even if their trial takes place in American courts.\n\nIn their filings, the attorneys representing Lopez\u2019s estate counter that the ruling is irrelevant because it deals with a search that took place in Mexico. Lopez and his wife, although Mexican citizens, were on U.S. soil when police officers showed up at their house and opened fire. Wells told reporters on Thursday that Southaven\u2019s attorneys \u201cwant to say it\u2019s sort of like they were actually in Mexico when this happened.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s not what happened,\u201d he added. \u201cThey were in their home.\u201d\n\nKerby also told the Commercial Appeal that she had based her argument on a 2011 case, United States v. Portillo-Munoz, where the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against a Mexican man who claimed that federal statutes barring people who enter the country illegally from owning guns ran contrary to the Second Amendment. But Lopez\u2019s team pointed out that the same ruling also made clear that the decision didn\u2019t have any bearing on Fourth Amendment protections against government overreach.\n\nAt Thursday\u2019s news conference, Wells said that he asked the judge presiding over the case to consider sanctioning the city for arguments that weren\u2019t being made in good faith and for questioning the integrity of Lopez\u2019s marriage.\n\n\u201cThis case should have never been here in the first place,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was an accident. They should have taken responsibility for it, and we should move forward.\u201d\n\nA reporter asked Linares for her thoughts.\n\n\u201cThere are no words,\u201d she replied in Spanish.\n\nAD", "description": "\u201cWe\u2019re stunned that someone put this in writing,\u201d Murray Wells, an attorney representing Ismael Lopez\u2019s estate, told reporters at a Thursday news conference.", "authors": ["Antonia Noori Farzan", "Reporter For The Morning Mix"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/HW9iSeyoUUQvA_e8XW-4wtIhEws=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/W6UZE57KDRB3DDR2E5NXCZ26I4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
