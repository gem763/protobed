Always ahead of the curve, David Cameron is leaning in to the coming winds of financial and ritualistic deregulation with demob abandon. Speaking in Harrogate to promote his book on Thursday night, Cameron predicted success for Boris Johnson and his deal. As the former prime minister put it: \u201cThe thing about the greased piglet is that he manages to slip through other people\u2019s hands where mere mortals fail.\u201d\n\n'Greased piglet' Boris Johnson could pass deal, says David Cameron Read more\n\nThat\u2019s it, mate. Why keep your mouth shut about pigs any more? We should just take it from one who knows: greasing a pig makes it go better. Given the dramatic degeneration of our public conversation over the past three years, it feels right that Cameron chose to finally \u201cgo there\u201d on the porcine front in Harrogate, a town that was for so long a byword for a certain type of regional gentility.\n\nI would imagine his next tour stop will be in Royal Leamington Spa, where he will expand on the point with a demonstration comparing different means of lubricant. Local boars who\u2019ve always wanted to put their daughter on the stage are invited to get in touch with his promoter.\n\nAs for which atrocious timeline we are about to be flung into tomorrow, who can say? A lot of journalists would certainly like to say. Everything has improved, hasn\u2019t it, since journalists decided their job is predicting what might happen in the future as opposed to reporting on what they do currently know, or scrutinising what they can currently see.\n\nThus the 36 hours or so between Johnson announcing his deal in Brussels and the special sitting of parliament to vote on it feel like they have been mostly spent watching or reading hacks and pundits debating the complex question, \u201cWill the agreement pass?\u201d I don\u2019t know, guys! I guess you could concentrate on what\u2019s in it \u2013 or are you as committed to a no-spoilers Brexit as the government is?\n\nLavishing hours of airtime and miles of column inches on speculating precisely how close it all is feels a bit like being given advance notice of a shitstorm, and frittering your day away taking spread bets on the possible wind speed. Six votes? Three votes? Would someone like to come on air and say they reckon there\u2019s maybe just a couple of votes in it? What if it was a tie?\n\nEither way, the conclusion, which may of course be debunked tomorrow, is that it will be Very Close. Then, when it is, lots of people will be able to sweep online to declare that they \u201cCALLED IT\u201d. You can print out those tweets and burn them for warmth in the years when we\u2019re discovering the true implications of the Very Close Vote on whatever it was a vote on.\n\nThe only people who seem to have spent less time thinking about the detail are the likes of Andrew Bridgen. \u201cIt looks like Brexit, it smells like Brexit,\u201d he explained to Channel 4 News. \u201cThat\u2019s Brexit for me.\u201d Despite being even more cruelly miscast as a \u201cSpartan\u201d than cinema\u2019s Gerard Butler once was, the likes of Mark Francois and Andrew Bridgen have succeeded in getting apparently serious commentators to use their self-styled nickname \u201cthe Spartans\u201d without deploying airquotes so thrustingly sarcastic that they could be harnessed for wind power.\n\nMeanwhile, Michael Gove could be found lurching unsteadily towards the TV camera to bat away Andrew Neil\u2019s inquiry about the possibility of a second referendum amendment. \u201cThat ain\u2019t gonna happen,\u201d drawled the bespectacled Clint Eastwood of Surrey Heath. \u201cAin\u2019t gonna \u2013 ain\u2019t gonna be no second referendum.\u201d In retrospect, that may be the moment this once self-respecting nation had to officially admit it was over.\n\nWe have created an environment so intensely deregulated that Michael Gove is emboldened enough to imagine he\u2019s some kind of gunslinger. The system has already failed. We passed checks and balances three galaxies ago. Our executive defences have been breached by Jacob Rees-Mogg, a man grown in a petri dish to provide Monty Burns with someone who could lose to him at arm wrestling.\n\nPlay Video 1:17 MPs say Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal is far worse than Theresa May\u2019s \u2013 video\n\nGiven the problems Theresa May had, there was some sense of surprise that Johnson should have pulled off a deal acceptable to the more deranged elements of his party. But history is likely to judge that it\u2019s easier than it looks when you\u2019re a man whose sole ideological red line is frictionless abortions. Having given a speech in November 2018 insisting that \u201cno British Conservative government could or should sign up\u201d to regulatory and customs checks in the Irish Sea, Johnson\u2019s British Conservative government was just shy of three months old when it cheerily signed up to regulatory and customs checks in the Irish Sea. That was a great outcome, explained foreign secretary and famous geography dunce Dominic Raab, who said it was a \u201ccracking deal\u201d for Northern Ireland on the basis that they\u2019d keep \u201cfrictionless access to the single market\u201d. There it is: the dream. Only a few more days of having to remember which lie you told.\n\nSpeaking of Northern Ireland, the week has offered the chance to watch the Democratic Unionist party discover in real time who the sucker at the table was. It would take a heart of stone not to enjoy the disappointment of DUP hive queen Arlene Foster, who has carried herself throughout the Brexit process like the kind of maternal screen villain who tries to scupper their child\u2019s every romantic attachment for not being good enough.\n\nThe DUP have so enjoyed being at the centre of the soap opera since the 2017 election, and acting like divas, that they didn\u2019t realise until they saw this week\u2019s script that the producers couldn\u2019t be doing with them any more and were killing them off. It\u2019s a lot like what happened with Martine McCutcheon on EastEnders. She went off and showed them by having a 15-minute pop career; Arlene is not thought to have any musical ambitions, but will now always be a hero to those dreaming of a united Ireland.\n\nAs for the prime minister, he seems to be enjoying himself, as much as is possible for a sort of middle-aged Kylo Ren who\u2019s making all the correct self-care decisions. In Westminster, many judge that, whatever happens tomorrow, Boris Johnson is in a win-win situation, with the sole losing entity being the entire United Kingdom. As David Cameron continues to promote his bestselling book, and the rabid deregulators continue to promote Boris Johnson, it does feel as if the nation might end up the true sucker in all this. Then again, for all the mirth it produced, there was always a rather leaden sense of dramatic irony clouding the original Cameron/pig tale. People like David Cameron end up playing David Cameron. The rest of the public is in danger of being the pig.\n\n\u2022 Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist", "description": "It\u2019s entirely fitting that the former prime minister went there at a time of maximum national derangement, says Guardian columnist Marina Hyde", "authors": ["Marina Hyde"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d61f2cd19ee821e1f25e1a4fbbdc5407316b100/0_134_4689_2813/master/4689.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=6fd900405698ed96c306d4296992c1bf", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
