But don\u2019t call it a comeback.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Eddie Murphy attends the premiere of \"Dolemite is My Name\" in Los Angeles, California, U.S. September 28, 2019. REUTERS/Phil McCarten/File Photo\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been making movies for almost 40 years, and every five years I\u2019m in my comeback - they say I\u2019m coming back,\u201d Murphy said.\n\n\u201cBut (\u2018Dolemite is My Name\u2019) is more a bookend than it is a comeback, because I\u2019m never going to be making movies like I used to make movies,\u201d the comedian added.\n\n\u201cDolemite Is My Name,\u201d out in U.S. movie theaters on Friday, sees Murphy playing the late real-life American celebrity, Rudy Ray Moore, a once struggling comedy and rap pioneer who found success in the 1970s through his obscene, kung-fu fighting alter ego Dolemite.\n\nIt\u2019s Murphy\u2019s first major film since the 2011 crime caper \u201cTower Heist.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe (Moore) is just a great inspirational character. He believes in himself, that\u2019s what his biggest thing is,\u201d said Murphy.\n\n\u201cAs crude as his movies were, he made them out of his pocket, and he had to do everything himself and come in from the back door,\u201d he said.\n\nCritics are calling his performance a career best. \u201cYou might have to go all the way back to the \u201880s to find a Murphy performance driven by this much pleasurable funky verve,\u201d the Variety review said.\n\nMurphy has more in store. He\u2019s working on two new movies - \u201cComing 2 America\u201d and \u201cBeverly Hills Cop 4\u201d - sequels to two of his most successful films in the 1980s.\n\nAside from that, Murphy says he is going to focus on getting back to his first love, stand up, \u201cunless, you know, Quentin Tarantino or Spielberg or Martin Scorsese or, you know, some genius dude or Spike (Lee) has something really incredible.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m 58 now and I like nothing more than to just be at home on the couch within earshot of the children,\u201d he added.\n\nMuch as Murphy appears to be the perfect actor to embody Moore, who died in 2008, he says their careers couldn\u2019t be more different.\n\n\u201cThe only thing I ever auditioned for was \u2018Saturday Night Live.\u2019... I came as close as you can come to walking out of heaven right into Hollywood.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had such a charmed life my biopic would be boring.\u201d", "description": "Sure, Eddie Murphy hasn't been around for a while, and his new movie \"Dolemite Is My Name\" is getting rave reviews.
