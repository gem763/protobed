They were therefore entitled to protection from attack, and could only have lost this protection if, and for such time, as they had been directly participating in hostilities,\" the report said.\n\nThe US Forces-Afghanistan (USFOR-A) issued a statement, rejecting the UN report and claiming there were no casualties.\n\n\"USFOR-A is fighting in a complex environment against those who intentionally kill and hide behind civilians, as well as use dishonest claims of non-combatant casualties as propaganda weapons,\" the statement said.\n\n\"USFOR-A took extraordinary measures to avoid the deaths or injuries of non-combatants.\"\n\nSince late 2017, US forces have attacked sites believed to be used for processing drugs as part of efforts to cut off funds to the Taliban group.\n\n191008143005726\n\nFacilities that help fund parties who are involved in the 18-year war are considered civilian objectives under international humanitarian law, and thus drug labs and their workers are unlawful targets, the report concluded.\n\nAfghanistan's security forces and US-led NATO forces have been heavily criticised for inflicting civilian casualties during their raids and air attacks.\n\nAt least 3,812 civilians have been killed or wounded in the first half of 2019, UNAMA said in a report published in July, noting a big increase in the number of casualties caused by government and NATO-led troops.\n\nIt said 1,366 civilians were killed and another 2,446 wounded in the six months to June 30.\n\nThe report attributed 717 civilians killed and 680 wounded to pro-government forces, representing a 31 percent increase from the corresponding period in 2018.\n\nTaliban and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL or ISIS) fighters killed 531 Afghans and wounded 1,437, said the UNAMA report.\n\nThe US formally ended its combat mission in Afghanistan in 2014 but still provides extensive air and other support to local forces battling both the armed groups.", "description": "UN says it verified 39 civilian casualties, including 30 deaths, in May 5 air attacks, but US military rejects report.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/9/b73f72e5546a4e10ba1c153d702f7520_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
