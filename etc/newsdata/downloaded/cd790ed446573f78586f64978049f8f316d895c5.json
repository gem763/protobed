Collins\u2019 son, Cameron Collins, and another man, Stephen Zarsky, are also scheduled to plead guilty in the case on Thursday.\n\nA spokesman for U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman, whose office is prosecuting the case, declined to comment, as did Mauro Wolfe, a lawyer for Zarsky.\n\nLawyers for Chris and Cameron Collins could not immediately be reached.\n\nChris Collins, an early supporter of President Donald Trump, represents New York\u2019s 27th Congressional District, which includes areas surrounding Buffalo and Rochester. He won reelection last November, three months after he was criminally charged.\n\nThe criminal case relates to Australian biotechnology company Innate Immunotherapeutics Ltd, a company for which Chris Collins sat on the board and held a 16.8% stake.\n\nProsecutors allege that in June 2017, while attending the congressional picnic at the White House, Collins learned in an email from Innate\u2019s chief executive that a clinical trial for its proposed multiple sclerosis drug MIS416 had failed.\n\nCollins immediately told the trial failure news to his son, who in turn told his fianc\u00e9e, Lauren Zarsky, and her parents, Dorothy and Stephen Zarsky, prosecutors allege.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. Representative Chris Collins is interviewed during the 2017 \"Congress of Tomorrow\" Joint Republican Issues Conference in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S. January 25, 2017.

Prosecutors said the congressman was \u201cvirtually precluded\u201d from trading in part because he already faced a congressional ethics probe over Innate.\n\nHowever, prosecutors said others used the insider information to avoid more than $768,000 in losses when Innate\u2019s share price plunged 92% after news of the drug\u2019s failure became public.\n\nLauren and Dorothy Zarsky were not criminally charged, but reached civil settlements with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.", "description": "Chris Collins, a Republican U.S. congressman from New York state, resigned on Monday ahead of his expected guilty plea in a criminal insider trading case.", "authors": ["Brendan Pierson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190930&t=2&i=1435683336&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8T14X", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
