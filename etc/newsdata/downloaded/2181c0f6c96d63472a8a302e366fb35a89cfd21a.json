REUTERS/Adnan Abidi\n\nU.S. District Judge Indira Talwani in Boston has set a quick schedule to consider whether to block Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker\u2019s administration from enforcing a four-month ban on the sale of vaping products.\n\nBaker\u2019s move came as federal officials on Thursday reported that 18 people have died from a mysterious vaping-linked illness that has sickened more than 1,000 in the United States. [nL3N26O3M2]\n\nTrade group Vapor Technology Association is challenging Baker\u2019s Sept. 24 ban in a lawsuit that was filed on Tuesday.\n\nThe VTA group prevailed in a hearing in New York state court on Thursday, when a judge temporarily prevented the state from enforcing a more limited ban, blocking the sale of flavored e-cigarettes, from taking effect. [nL3N26P0V1]\n\nVTA, which sued along with the operators of several vape shops in Massachusetts, Connecticut and New Hampshire, said the order amounts to an unconstitutional prohibition on retail and online advertising of their legal products.\n\nThe group\u2019s lawyers, including Joseph Terry of Williams & Connolly, argued the order not only violated the plaintiffs\u2019 free speech rights under the U.S. Constitution, but also the Commerce Clause\u2019s prohibition on state laws that unduly restrict interstate commerce.\n\nBaker announced the ban on sales of e-cigarettes and vaping supplies, both those used for nicotine and THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, which is legal in the state, in response to the nationwide surge in a sometimes deadly lung disease linked to vaping. [nL2N26F1EP]\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has linked vaping to 18 deaths and 1,080 confirmed and probable cases nationally in mostly otherwise healthy people who contracted the mysterious respiratory illness. It has said most patients affected reported using products containing THC.\n\nMore than two-thirds of patients are male. The median age of cases is 23 years, with about 62% of patients aged 18-34, according to the CDC.\n\nThe VTA says Baker\u2019s ban, if left standing, will irreparably destroy Massachusetts\u2019 $331 million nicotine vapor products industry and the livelihoods of the nearly 2,500 workers it employs.\n\nThe lawsuit is one of a number filed nationwide by vape shops and the VTA challenging restrictions announced by various states in response to the outbreak of vaping-related illnesses.\n\nGovernors in Michigan and Rhode Island have also restricted sales of flavored e-cigarette products in recent weeks. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine on Tuesday called on state lawmakers to pass a ban on most flavored e-cigarettes.
