The briefing will be \"about documents obtained from the department\u2019s Office of the Legal Adviser related to the State Department and Ukraine.\"\n\nLinick reportedly requested the meeting. Although the reason for the briefing remains unknown, ABC News reported it may be related to a whistleblower complaint filed against President Donald Trump over a July call he made with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. During the call Trump asked Zelensky to investigate corruption. At the time, then-Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, was sitting on the board of directors of a Ukrainian gas company. The vice president was overseeing foreign relations with the Ukrainians.\n\nSpecifically, ABC News reported that the briefing will detail \"the State Department\u2019s role in coordinating interactions between Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal attorney, and Ukrainian officials.\"\n\nAccording to CNN, a congressional staffer said the IG's request was \"highly unusual and cryptically worded.\"\n\nThe inspector general plans to meet with the following Committees, Axios reported:\n\nHouse Foreign Affairs\n\nSenate Foreign Relations\n\nHouse Appropriations\n\nSenate Appropriations\n\nHouse Oversight\n\nSenate Homeland Security\n\nHouse Intelligence\n\nSenate Intelligence\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) announced last week that the House of Representatives would be starting a formal impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. The assertion was made before Trump released a transcript of his call with Zelensky, which showed no squid pro quo took place.", "description": "This just in..10/01/2019 20:34:46PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa", "Cortney O'Brien", "Guy Benson"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2014/344/4da26a61-4124-4919-b6f8-3efb88e5565c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
