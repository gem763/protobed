Any of the three clubs could host the contest, depending how the rest of the regular season goes.\n\nWashington manager Dave Martinez said Friday that the right-handed Strasburg and lefty starter Patrick Corbin will be on the wild-card roster and be available to pitch in relief.\n\n\u201cI talked to both of them,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cThey\u2019ll both be out of the \u2018pen that day. So all hands will be on deck.\u201d\n\nHow did Martinez decide to go with Scherzer, who missed most of July and August with a back muscle issue and finished with 27 starts, his fewest since his debut season in 2008?\n\n\u201cI based it on the bigger picture. Obviously, he feels good. And he\u2019s ready. He\u2019s going to have like seven, eight days\u2019 rest. I told him, \u2018You should go on regular routine and get ready for Tuesday,\u2019\u201d Martinez said. \u201cWith that being said, Strasburg is going to be on his regular rest and regular routine. So that\u2019s kind of nice, to have those two guys, plus Corbin, that will be on three days\u2019 rest if we need to put him in for an inning or two. He\u2019s available to do that, as well.\u201d\n\nIf Strasburg does not appear Tuesday and the Nationals win, he would start Game 1 or 2 of the NL Division Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Scherzer probably wouldn\u2019t be available until Game 3 of that potential series.\n\nWashington\u2019s top trio formed among the best rotation fronts in the majors all season. All three finished in the NL\u2019s top 10 in ERA, strikeouts and hits allowed per nine innings.\n\nScherzer went 11-7 with a 2.92 ERA and 243 strikeouts in 172 1/3 innings.\n\nStrasburg was 18-6 with a 3.32 ERA and 251 strikeouts in 209 innings.\n\nCorbin went 14-7 with a 3.05 ERA and 230 strikeouts in 197 2/3 innings.\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Nationals don't know which team they'll face in the NL wild-card game or where it will be played, but they do know this: Three-time Cy Young Award winner Max Scherzer will be their starting pitcher.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Howard Fendrich"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/24/phillies_nationals_baseball_03237_c0-125-2974-1858_s1770x1032.jpg?5795b38aca2181e13203d94798420217aac22e46", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
