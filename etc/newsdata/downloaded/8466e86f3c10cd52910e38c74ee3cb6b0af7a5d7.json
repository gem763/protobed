REUTERS/Issei Kato/File Photo\n\nWeakness in the global economy and trade protectionism have emerged as risks to growth and increased pressure for the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to expand stimulus when it meets later this month.\n\nThe economy grew an annualized 1.3% in April-June, weaker than the preliminary reading for 1.8% annualized growth, Cabinet Office data showed Monday.\n\nThe reading was in line with the economists\u2019 median forecast for a 1.3% gain.\n\nThe annualized growth rate translates into quarter-on-quarter expansion of 0.3% from January-March, compared with a preliminary reading for a 0.4% gain.\n\nCapital spending rose just 0.2% from the previous quarter, much lower than a preliminary 1.5% rise and the median forecast for a 0.7% increase.\n\nPrivate consumption, which accounts for some 60% of gross domestic product, advanced 0.6% from the previous three months, matching the preliminary reading.\n\nNet exports - or exports minus imports - subtracted 0.3 percentage point from revised GDP growth, while domestic demand added 0.6 percentage point.\n\nThe outlook for the world\u2019s third-largest economy remains clouded as risks from declining manufacturing overseas and at home hit exports hard.\n\nAnalysts have also warned of a possible drop in domestic consumption after Japan raises its sales tax to 10% as planned next month. That, in turn, threatens to leave the economy without a growth driver unless global demand rebounds.\n\nBOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has kept the door ajar for cutting interest rates further into negative territory, saying last week such move is among the bank\u2019s policy options.\n\nSpeculation is growing that the BOJ could ease policy as early as this month to prevent the yen from spiking, which could become increasingly likely if the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank unveil new easing measures.", "description": "Japan's economy grew at a slower pace than initially estimated in the second quarter on the back of softer capital spending, signaling strains on the economy from weaker global growth and the U.S.-China trade war.", "authors": ["Daniel Leussink", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1427754027&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF88000", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
