The club is now a community partner of the Washington Capitals.\n\nHenderson, who now lives in Upper Marlboro, Maryland, was congratulated by Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton and Capitals owner Ted Leonsis for his selection.\n\n\u201cCoach Henderson richly deserves this recognition for his decades of commitment to the District\u2019s hockey programs and our local youth sports,\u201d Norton said in a statement. \u201cCoach Henderson embodies the best values of the District of Columbia and its residents. This is a well-deserved induction into the Hockey Hall of Fame.\u201d\n\n\u201cNeal Henderson is a pioneer in hockey in the Washington and Baltimore communities,\u201d Leonsis wrote. \u201cWe are fortunate to have an advocate for hockey such as Henderson who consistently brings joy to the sport while sharing his wealth of knowledge with kids. Henderson\u2019s work with Fort Dupont Ice Arena and D.C.\u2019s minority hockey programs is a vibrant part of our community and he is a true ambassador for the sport of hockey.\u201d\n\nHenderson is joined in the class by current NHL commissioner Gary Bettman and former players Brian Gionta, Tim Thomas and Krissy Wendell.\n\nHe was also integral in the NHL launching its diversity program, Hockey is for Everyone.\n\n\u201cWhen you have kids that are in situations and different home settings, where they\u2019re used to the words \u2018no,\u2019 \u2018stop,\u2019 \u2018don\u2019t,\u2019 \u2018can\u2019t,\u2019 \u2018cannot,\u2019 \u2018will not,\u2019\u201d Henderson told The Washington Times last year, \u201cyou turn over those things into \u2018I will\u2019 and \u2018I can,\u2019 it makes a big difference in their outlook.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
