Voters typically back high rates on annual income but not, for example, on inheritances.\n\nReducing inequality also routinely ranks low on the list of voter priorities - with fewer than 3% identifying it as the top problem in Gallup surveys.\n\n\"It is certainly the case that income inequality has increased and many Americans are aware of that and are unhappy with the trend, but translating that into a desire for redistributive taxing and spending policies is more difficult,\" Ms Campbell says.\n\nDemocrats divided\n\nA few newspaper columns and famous names notwithstanding, surveys show the rich tend to be anti-tax - and the rich still have the most influence.\n\nDespite the populist tone US President Donald Trump struck during his 2016 presidential campaign, once in office he championed a tax cut that disproportionately benefited the wealthy.\n\nThere is even a divide among Democrats, as many moderates stop short of supporting a wealth tax - which covers items such as property, yachts and art in addition to income - that is backed by Ms Warren and Mr Sanders.\n\nThey have argued that such plans are not only unrealistic but bad policy, since they can be difficult to enforce.\n\nWealth taxes have been phased out in much of Europe, and they would almost certainly face a legal challenge in the US over whether they meet the constitution's criteria for what the federal government is allowed to tax.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Democrats are divided over the issue of a wealth tax\n\nEven if the public was convinced by Ms Warren's proposal - which would place a 2% tax on household assets over $50m and 3% over $1bn - it's unlikely to make it past Republicans and lobbyists in Washington, Ms Campbell adds.\n\n\"The role of public opinion in setting taxes is relatively modest,\" says Ms Campbell. \"Even if ordinary Americans on average would like increased taxes on high income, high wealth people, I don't think they're the ones with influence on policymakers.\"", "description": "For years, the assumption has been that most Americans are anti-tax, but are attitudes changing?", "authors": ["Natalie Sherman", "Business Reporter", "New York"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/28D9/production/_109275401_gettyimages-884612434-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
