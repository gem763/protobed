And you know what, they did!\n\n\u201cThe story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about returning to TV and then the later story about the basement flooding in my new house.\n\n\u201dNow I know for certain which account/individual it\u2019s come from. It\u2019s Rebekah Vardy\u2019s account.\u201d\n\nShe added alongside the statement: \u201cThis has been a burden in my life for a few years now and finally I have got to the bottom of it.\u201d", "description": "Rebeka Vardy's Instagram account was accused of leaking stories about Coleen Rooney to the press", "authors": ["Lucy Needham", "Image", "Dave J Hogan Getty Images", "Getty Images", "Splashnews.Com", "Lightrocket Via Getty Images", "Pa", "Leicester City Fc Via Getty Imag", "Coleem_Rooney Instagram"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20543964.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_TRIC-Awards-VIP-Arrivals.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
