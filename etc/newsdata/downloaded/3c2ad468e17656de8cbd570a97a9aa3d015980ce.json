Sadie Dingfelder/TWP (left photo) Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post (right photo)\n\nOf the three visitors at the African American Civil War Museum on a recent Tuesday afternoon, two were there by accident. The other one was me.\n\n\u201cWe got confused by the Metro map,\u201d confessed one of my fellow tourists, who misread the stop for U Street/African-Amer Civil War Memorial/Cardozo. \u201cWe meant to go to the new Smithsonian museum.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t feel bad. That happens a lot,\u201d a museum employee chimed in.\n\nI felt a little sorry for the lost tourists. While the African American Civil War Museum serves an important purpose \u2014 highlighting the role that African American soldiers, sailors and resistance fighters played in winning the war and ending slavery \u2014 it\u2019s an undeniably modest affair compared with the massive, state-of-the-art National Museum of African American History and Culture on the Mall. At least the Civil War museum, which opened in 1999, was less crowded.\n\n\u201cStart here,\u201d the employee said, pointing me to a pair of tall partitions that looked like pages torn from a giant history textbook. A maze of text-covered partitions takes up most of the one-room museum.\n\n\n\nThe former president, in cardboard cutout form, greets visitors at the end of the exhibit. (Sadie Dingfelder)\n\nSurprisingly, the chronological exhibit begins not with the run-up to the Civil War, but when the first Africans were brought to Jamestown as slaves (or perhaps indentured servants \u2014 historians disagree on their legal status) in 1619. Sneaking a peek at the end of the labyrinth, I found that the museum\u2019s main exhibit concluded not with the surrender of Robert E. Lee, but the election of President Barack Obama. That\u2019s quite a lot of history to cover \u2014 nearly 400 years \u2014 in a single, albeit large, room. (It\u2019s about the same time span that the NMAAHC covers in its bottom four floors.)\n\nSkipping ahead to the Civil War, I was fascinated to learn that in the 1840s and \u201950s, people of African descent were already preparing to fight. In the North, private militias drilled and marched openly in annual Emancipation Day parades that celebrated the freeing of enslaved people in the West Indies. Meanwhile, deep in the swamps of the Carolinas, pockets of escaped slaves defended themselves against recapture and, later, became valuable sources of intelligence for Union officers.\n\nI was riveted by the story of one daring act of resistance, where an enslaved 23-year-old sailor named Robert Smalls quietly took control of a Southern gunboat when the officers were ashore, steered it past Confederate checkpoints, and handed the valuable vessel to the Union Navy \u2014 freeing himself, his family and several other enslaved people who were onboard. He later became the first African American captain of a vessel in U.S. service, piloting the very steamer he\u2019d stolen.\n\nI also learned that it was only in the second year of the Civil War, when it became clear that the North couldn\u2019t win without African Americans, that President Lincoln allowed the Army to begin enlisting soldiers of African descent. (The Navy was already integrated on the eve of the Civil War, and many black sailors had served with distinction in the War of 1812.)\n\nWhile the museum\u2019s text was top-notch, the objects on display weren\u2019t as impressive. The first objects I encountered were two small statues without labels. A little ways from there, I found a nearly dadaist assemblage of an old-fashioned-looking dress, a cardboard cutout of Harriet Tubman and a new-looking gravestone bearing the name of a Civil War soldier. A screen displayed an array of nearly illegible Civil War documents, not all of which were oriented right-side up.\n\nWhat the museum does have in abundance are slave shackles \u2014 I counted nine. These shameful and compelling artifacts were well-labeled, as was a cabinet with Civil War buttons, bullets and a canteen used by a black Union soldier.\n\nAfter the Civil War section, the narrative zoomed ahead through the World Wars and the civil rights movement to the present day. There, perhaps to commemorate the invention of television, I found some multimedia exhibits. One screen played a PBS documentary about Emmett Till over a display case showing a Jet magazine article about the teenager\u2019s tragic lynching in 1955, after he allegedly made a pass at a white woman.\n\n\n\nThis dadaist assemblage \u2014 of Rosa Parks, a gravestone, an old dress and a screen scrolling through illegible documents \u2014 can be found about halfway through the exhibit. (Sadie Dingfelder)\n\n\u201cAt the Smithsonian African American museum, they have a whole Emmett Till memorial, with his casket,\u201d I told my fellow tourists.\n\n\u201cMy mom kept that magazine, to teach us about how things used to be,\u201d one of the two women replied.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t learn much about African American history, in Florida public schools,\u201d I said. \u201cI was taught that the Civil War was fought over states\u2019 rights, not slavery.\u201d\n\nUntil these sorts of misconceptions are cleared up, I\u2019m happy to see a proliferation of African American history museums. But if you only have so much time for D.C.\u2019s, hit the big one on the Mall over this neighborhood institution \u2014 and don\u2019t plan your day around a hastily skimmed Metro map.\n\nThe Staycationer\u2019s greatest hits\n\nIt\u2019s been fun being your D.C. tourism columnist, but now I must say goodbye. I\u2019ve had some great adventures over the years.
