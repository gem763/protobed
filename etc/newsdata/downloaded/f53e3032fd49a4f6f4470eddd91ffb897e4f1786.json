Kyle Neddenriep, kyle.neddenriep@indystar.com\n\nWhen Owen Sego says his father never missed a sporting event of his in his life, it is not an exaggeration. Football, wrestling, track, whatever else, Neil Sego was always there. If you did not see Neil, you could hear him.\n\n\u201cHe was the one who knew everybody\u2019s name on the team,\u201d Owen said.\n\nThe night of Oct. 4 was different in a way Owen could have never imagined \u2014 and no 17-year-old should. At Indian Creek (Trafalgar, Indiana) High School's senior night, a game that should have been filled with smiles and celebration, Owen ran for 107 yards and two touchdowns in a blowout 57-8 win over Manual.\n\nIt was the first game Neil missed. The day before, he was one of five people who died in a single-engine plane crash north of Lansing, Michigan.\n\n\u201cI looked up in the crowd like 30 times to see if he was there,\u201d Owen said. \u201cIt felt so different. I could always hear him from the stands. He was literally everything to me. My mentor, my coach, my dad. Everything I know is from him.\u201d\n\nOwen was not planning to play in that game. He was with his family in Lansing. He told friends he was not going to play. \u201cMy family was talking and said they would like to see me out there,\u201d Owen said. \u201cSo I thought, \u2018What would my dad want me to do?\u2019 He would want me to be strong and go out and play.\u201d\n\nOwen Sego (left) and Avery Whitten are two of Indian Creek's nine senior football players. Sego's father, Neil Sego, died last week in a plane crash. Hours later, Whitten's mother, Tamara Whitten, died of heart failure. (Photo: Kyle Neddenriep)\n\nAnother tragedy\n\nOn the Segos\u2019 five-hour drive back home, Indian Creek principal Luke Skobel called to alert them that the school \u2014 and the football team \u2014 had been hit by a second tragedy in 24 hours. Owen\u2019s senior teammate and locker-room neighbor, Avery Whitten, lost his mother, Tamara Whitten, on Friday morning due to heart failure.\n\nOwen called coach Brett Cooper to alert him he planned to play but would be cutting it close to kickoff time. Then he asked to speak with Avery.\n\n\u201cThis is less than 24 hours after Owen found out his dad died,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s empathizing with Avery.\u201d\n\nAvery, a 6-foot-1, 265-pound defensive end, was the only teammate Owen spoke with when he arrived 10 minutes before kickoff. \u201cIt kind of helps knowing somebody else is going through what you are going through,\u201d Owen said. \u201cNeither of us expected this.\u201d\n\nThe wounds are still fresh. There is no textbook answer on how to deal with tragedy. In this case, tragedy times two. Cooper left it up to Owen and Avery whether they wanted to play that night. There was no right or wrong answer. But there is comfort in normalcy.\n\n\u201cMy mom (Connie) is a coach\u2019s wife,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cShe said, \u2018Sometimes words don\u2019t matter. They just need a hug.\u2019 That resonated pretty thoroughly with those two kids. Nothing we say is necessarily going to help. But the support they feel can.\u201d\n\nLeaning on community\n\nAvery was getting puzzling messages during his business class on Oct. 4. Messages like, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Avery, the fourth of eight siblings, started texting his older brothers and worried something had happened to his mother.\n\n\u201cA couple of minutes before the bell, Coach Cooper came in with our assistant athletic director and vice principal and told me what happened,\u201d Avery said.\n\nAvery's 52-year-old mother had died. The most difficult part of the day, Avery said, was seeing his younger sister Charlotte, who turned 9 that day.\n\n\u201cWe sat there crying in the office,\u201d Avery said. \u201cI was thinking, \u2018She\u2019s never going to have another normal birthday in her life.\u2019\u201d\n\nTamara was an avid horse trainer and active in the rodeo. Though his parents had divorced, Avery said Friday night football always brought the family together. \u201cI always felt like I had my own cheering bloc,\u201d he said.\n\nAvery said he owes his Indian Creek family a big \u201cthank you\u201d for the support.\n\n\u201cThe team honestly is an extension of my family,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only reason I played that night and came to school on Monday is because I knew I could find comfort in them and the teachers, counselors and administrators. I don\u2019t think I could keep doing this if not for them.\u201d\n\nCLOSE Indian Creek senior Avery Whitten lost his mother, Tamara Whitten, on Friday and played in the Braves' win over Manual. Kyle Neddenriep, kyle.neddenriep@indystar.com\n\nAvery knew Neil Sego. Of course. Everybody knew Neil. \u201cHe was a big part of this community,\u201d Avery said.\n\nWhen Owen first heard that his father had been in an accident, he wrongly assumed it had been a motorcycle accident. He did not realize his father was headed out of town on a flight that morning. The initial word was that Neil was in critical condition. Owen and his mother, Nicole, and older brother, Ethan, had barely started out toward Lansing when they received the call that Neil had died.\n\nAlmost immediately, Owen felt the love and support from the community. Friends, teammates, classmates and coaches reached out to share stories about Neil and offer support.\n\n\u201cIt is so overwhelming,\u201d Owen said. \u201cI really does mean a lot. This is a small school where everybody knows everybody. Anything I need, I\u2019ve got.\u201d\n\nStill, there was an empty feeling on game night. It was not the same without his dad. \u201cI know he was there in spirit,\u201d Owen said. \u201cBut it didn\u2019t feel right, either. It felt like he should have been there.\u201d\n\nAvery felt that, too. Just a week before, Tamara had attended a game and told Avery she had fun and planned to be there for senior night. \u201cI told her I was looking forward to it,\u201d Avery said. \u201cWhen I found out what happened, I just told my family I needed to get out there and play.\u201d\n\nCall Star reporter Kyle Neddenriep at 317-444-6649.", "description": "Indiana high school football player Owen Sego's dad died in plane crash.
