General Assembly on Monday that his country remains committed to becoming a peaceful and stable democracy despite constant attacks from the Taliban.\n\nHe took great encouragement from the Taliban\u2019s inability to sabotage the elections held two days before he spoke, and stressed that a peace plan is still viable if the Taliban is willing to sign off on it.\n\nReading between the lines, Mohib\u2019s address conveyed irritation that the Afghan government has been largely sidelined during talks between the U.S. and the Taliban. He worked to make the case that no agreement reached without the full involvement and agreement of the government in Kabul would be accepted by the Afghan people.\n\nDr. Mohib began his presentation by expressing pride in the elections held in Afghanistan over the weekend, an election whose outcome remained uncertain at the time he spoke.\n\n\u201cAround three million Afghans faced the threat of terrorism and risked their lives to vote in our young democracy\u2019s fourth presidential election. Those who voted included men, women, and the very old \u2013 some voting perhaps for the last time \u2013 and the very young, those voting for the very first time of many times,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe all voted, not just for a president, but we voted for democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe voted for our constitution. We voted for freedom and sovereignty. We voted for prosperity and connectivity. We voted for peace, and we voted for the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan.\u201d\n\nMohib saluted the professionalism of Afghan security forces for thwarting many of the hundreds of terrorist attacks launched during the election and preventing all of those designed to inflict mass casualties. He thanked \u201cthe international community, particularly NATO countries\u201d for standing by his country as it rebuilt and \u201cre-imagined a new Afghanistan based on Islamic values, Afghan traditions, and hope for a permanent escape from our bloody past.\u201d\n\nMohib said Afghanistan has established itself as a stable and battle-tested democracy, but warned, \u201cUncertainty lies with those who stand in the way of peace.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo the Taliban and their foreign sponsors, hear this now, a message from the Afghan people: Join us in peace or we will continue to fight,\u201d he said.\n\nMohib said the current generation of Afghans was \u201cborn and raised in war,\u201d and Afghanistan has become a country \u201cdriven and defined by the expectations of its youth.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo matter the outcome of the presidential elections, one thing is clear: peace is, and will remain, the government\u2019s priority,\u201d he declared, recalling the \u201cunconditional offer of peace\u201d extended to the Taliban last year by incumbent President Ashraf Ghani and the three-day nationwide ceasefire in June 2018 that looked like a hopeful step forward.\n\nMohib credited the women of Afghanistan with being the first to rally around the government\u2019s \u201croadmap to peace,\u201d recalling how thousands of women were consulted last year to determine \u201cwhat would be acceptable to them in peace agreements.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs we prepare to take the next step in this process, we are committed to the principles of inclusivity, sustainability, and dignity,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Afghan people have demanded a cease-fire to immediately stop the bloodshed. They have demanded that talks must happen between Afghans, and they have demanded that the Islamic Republic must be preserved as the foundation of our nation-state.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeace is our common objective and terrorists are our common enemy,\u201d he said as he thanked the international community for its support. \u201cWe must not rush the former at the risk of empowering the latter.\u201d\n\nMohib urged:\n\nToday, Afghans fight on the front lines of terrorism so that others can maintain peace in their homes and on their land. But peace is not a permanent state of being. Peace requires care, and constant reappraisal undertaken by partners who share the same values, even as the front lines between war and peace across this globe shift. The terrorists that Afghan soldiers are holding at bay today pose a threat to us all. Terrorism is an idea, as much as it is a form of violence. We must continue to work together to extinguish the ideologies behind terrorism wherever they may exist.\n\nMohib implied that other nations in the region could do more to impede \u201cthe flow of terrorist fighters, the recruitment and resources that allow them to remain lethal,\u201d a goal that is often discussed but not always addressed through decisive action.", "description": "National Security Adviser Dr. Hamdullah Mohib says Afghanistan's government remains committed to peace, democracy, and stability.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/GettyImages-1172544867-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
