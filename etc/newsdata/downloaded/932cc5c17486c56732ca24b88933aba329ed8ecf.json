The audio was from that shooting, the deadliest up to that time. The number of dead has been eclipsed many times since.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think most Americans understand the true horror of such events,\u201d Oates said.\n\nHe was speaking at a congressional briefing, called Countering Mass Shootings in the United States, hosted by George Mason University on Tuesday in a large Senate office building hearing room where nearly every chair reserved for audience members appeared to be filled. Many of them were young, and not all were of the typical gun control crowd. One name on the sign-in sheet was listed as being from the office of Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., who has indicated a willingness to work on the issue.\n\nThough the fall congressional session is not yet a week old, there have already been a number of significant events related to gun control on Capitol Hill (and, to a lesser extent, on Pennsylvania Avenue). That suggests the furious debate over Second Amendment rights and restrictions will dominate the following months, especially after a bloody summer in which 53 Americans were killed in mass shootings in August. There have been a total of 304 mass shootings this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive.\n\nThe question is how to move meaningful legislation in a notoriously constipated Washington. After years of trying, Democrats seem to think they have the answer, one that combines legislative pressure, arguments based on new social science research and a social media campaign that galvanizes the left while putting the right on the defensive. They know that with the National Rifle Association in disarray and public opinion strongly on their side, they may not have a chance like this again.\n\nAurora, Colo., Police Chief Dan Oates prays at a 2013 ceremony marking the first anniversary of the movie theater shooting there.

Jahana Hayes, D-Conn., at one of several hearings on guns that have already taken place in the fall session\u2019s first week. \u201cIt is heartbreaking,\u201d said the former Connecticut teacher of the year. \u201cIt is unacceptable and it is traumatic.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are my colleagues afraid of?\u201d Hayes wondered, speaking specifically about the need for the federal government to gather data on mass shootings. Republicans have resisted such measures, but will increasingly find it difficult to do so, as the public desire for a solution to the nation\u2019s gun violence plague appears only to be increasing.\n\nThe district Hayes represents, as she noted, includes Newtown, where 20 children were slaughtered by a gunman at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012. Around the same time that she was speaking on Capitol Hill, a powerful advertisement by the gun control group Sandy Hook Promise was going viral on the internet. Beginning as a seemingly ordinary back-to-school commercial of the sort that play every September, the ad quickly turns to scenes of schoolhouse carnage, with students using back-to-school supplies to protect themselves during a shooting. As of Thursday afternoon, the video had been viewed more than 1.5 million times on YouTube and had received extensive media coverage.\n\nThe most critical legislation for Democrats is H.R. 8, a bill passed by the House of Representatives more than six months ago. If it were to become law, H.R. 8 would significantly expand background checks for gun purchases, a move supported by the overwhelming majority of Americans. The bill is a top legislative priority for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. It is also a bill that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a man known as \u201cthe grim reaper\u201d for his uncanny ability to keep bills from maturing into laws, intends to smother.", "description": "The fall congressional session is not a week old, but there have already been a number of events related to gun control on Capitol Hill.
