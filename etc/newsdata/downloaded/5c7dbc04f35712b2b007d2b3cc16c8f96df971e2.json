And critics emerged in droves to let Hunt know it.\n\nAD\n\nBut Hunt said he was obligated to introduce the bill despite those challenges.\n\nAD\n\nIn Massachusetts, unlike other states, citizens have what\u2019s known as a \u201cright of free petition\u201d allowing them to file proposed bills directly through their legislators. That\u2019s exactly what happened in this case, Hunt said: A woman in his district came to him this year requesting legislation, and he, in turn, filed it on her behalf. He didn\u2019t think he\u2019d get such a harsh reaction, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny and ironic that the constitutional provision that allows this constituent a conduit to free speech and proposing her idea has been so viscerally pushed back on by people saying this is stifling free speech,\u201d Hunt told The Washington Post. \u201cIt\u2019s important whether you agree or disagree with the legislation being proposed that you honor the duty to represent your constituents and have their voices heard.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe bill and the ensuing uproar reflect a broader debate simmering nationwide over what separates vulgarity, slurs and hate speech and how that language should be policed. College campuses have come under fire for attempting to crack down on language deemed offensive to certain groups, and President Trump and other conservatives have accused social media platforms of trying to censor right-leaning users.\n\nAD\n\nHunt declined to comment in detail on what prompted his constituent to reach out to him with the proposal about the word. But he said the woman told his office in March that she was troubled by numerous encounters in which \u201cpeople were letting that term fly loosely.\u201d\n\nThe legislation Hunt filed for her would add two sentences to part of the state\u2019s General Laws dealing with disorderly conduct. \u201cA person who uses the word \u2018bitch\u2019 directed at another person to accost, annoy, degrade or demean the other person shall be considered to be a disorderly person,\u201d it reads. \u201cA violation of this subsection may be reported by the person to whom the offensive language was directed at or by any witness to such incident.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBacklash rolled in just as the bill was set to be taken up in committee this week. The Massachusetts Republican Party called on Twitter followers to speak up if they were \u201ctired of @massdems dictating what you can say.\u201d Conservative media piled on, too. \u201cTheir disdain for the Constitution is nothing short of appalling,\u201d read a Washington Examiner column.\n\nAD\n\nLegal experts also weighed in. Jim Manley, an attorney with the Pacific Legal Foundation, told the libertarian magazine Reason that it would be a \u201chorrible unconstitutional miracle\u201d for the bill to pass and said debating it would mean \u201cwasting tremendous public resources.\u201d\n\nAnd then came the barrage of \u201ccolorful\u201d messages, as Hunt put it, \u201ccalling me the B-word and the C-word.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal. I\u2019m a big boy,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cBut days like this are a little discouraging in trying to fight the good fight.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for lawmakers to file bills at the request of their constituents in Massachusetts, which is the only state that extends such a right to its citizens. The Massachusetts legislature outlines the process on its website, as does the State Library of Massachusetts and the state bar association.\n\nAD\n\nDespite all the commotion online, when Hunt\u2019s bill came up in committee Tuesday, no one testified, he said. It\u2019s unclear whether the committee will recommend passing it, killing it or order that it be studied (typically a discreet way of letting a bill die).\n\nWhatever the case, Hunt said, it was important to let the bill move through the process.\n\n\u201cOnce you start picking and choosing, it eats away at the original intent of the framers, which is to give access to government to all of our citizens,\u201d he said. \u201cIn general, having people involved and trying to understand government is a good thing.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Massachusetts state Rep.
