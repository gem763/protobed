To help get there, it plans to buy 100,000 electric delivery vans from Michigan-based company Rivian, in which Amazon previously invested.\n\nAmazon says its Climate Pledge will meet the Paris climate agreement 10 years ahead of schedule. The company is also inviting other companies to sign onto the pledge.\n\n\"It's a difficult challenge for us because we have deep large physical infrastructure. We're not only moving information around ... we deliver more than 10 billion items a year,\" Bezos told reporters Thursday. \"And so we can make the argument \u2014 and we plan to do so passionately \u2014 that if we can do this, anyone can do this.\"\n\nAmazon's announcement marks the most sweeping climate-related action from the company, one day before more than 1,500 corporate workers planned a walkout to draw attention to their criticisms of the company's climate policies. Amazon has lagged behind other companies \u2014 including tech giants like Facebook and Google \u2014 in reaching the goal of 100% renewable energy and sharing data about its emissions.\n\nThe Amazon workers' planned walkout Friday is part of a series of rallies called the Global Climate Strike ahead of Monday's U.N. Climate Action Summit. Workers complained that the company known for its obsession with data and measurable goals would not share data on its own carbon footprint, calling on Amazon to get to zero emissions by 2030.\n\n\"Today, we celebrate. Tomorrow, we'll be in the streets to continue the fight for a livable future,\" the group Amazon Employees for Climate Justice said in a statement Thursday. The walkout also is expected to draw some workers from Google, Facebook and Microsoft.\n\nThousands of Amazon employees earlier this year signed a shareholder resolution to set a climate change plan, which did not pass. More than 8,000 workers had also signed an open letter to Bezos, calling for Amazon to set measurable goals, to end contracts with oil and gas companies and to stop donating to lawmakers who deny climate change.\n\n\"I think it's totally understandable people are passionate about this issue,\" Bezos said, adding that Amazon would review its campaign donations. The company will also invest $100 million to restore and protect forests, grasslands and wetlands.\n\nHowever, Bezos said he disagreed with the employees' call to end contracts with energy companies and stop providing them with cloud computing tools. \"To ask oil and energy companies to do this transition with bad tools is not a good idea and we won't do that,\" he said.\n\nElizabeth Sturcken, a managing director at the Environmental Defense Fund, called Amazon's Climate Pledge an encouraging step in the right direction.\n\n\"They were in danger of being left behind as a laggard,\" she said. \"There's a lot of hard work ahead for Amazon. But these ambitious, aspirational goals need to be turned into meaningful milestones, and they need to act transparently.\"\n\nBezos said Amazon will measure and regularly report online information about its carbon footprint and work toward reducing it.\n\nEditor's note: Amazon is one of NPR's recent financial supporters.", "description": "Amazon's plans include being carbon-neutral by 2040 and buying 100,000 electric delivery vans.
