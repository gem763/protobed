I\u2019ve been beating them,\u201d Lima told TMZ Sports. \u201c(I\u2019m a) three-time world champion, three tournament (wins), but they still don\u2019t believe me. Now that (Bellator president) Scott Coker is doing the co-promotions \u2013 he\u2019s doing that with Rizin \u2013 I would love if we would do that with the UFC.\u201d\n\nThe UFC\u2019s welterweight champ is Kamaru Usman, who hasn\u2019t lost in more than six years. But Lima is confident that if they fought, he\u2019d take him out.\n\n\u201cOf course I\u2019ll do great \u2013 I\u2019ll beat him,\u201d Lima said. \u201cI\u2019ll probably KO him, you know. But he\u2019s a great wrestler, for sure. He wrestles a lot. But man, any point in that fight if I connect, I can put him away. I don\u2019t even think about that. I just know that I can beat him. I know I can beat anybody at this weight class. I\u2019m not talking bad about the guy. He\u2019s the champion there. He\u2019s doing his thing. But I just know it, man \u2013 if one day something like this happened, I definitely believe in myself to just go over there and just kill it.\u201d\n\nLima, long considered one of the sport\u2019s underrated fighters, hates the narrative that the best fighters in the world are in the UFC. He believes he\u2019s been competing with the best welterweights in the world throughout his entire career.\n\n\u201cI think about it every time, especially after a win like this, because I know real MMA fans, they recognize,\u201d Lima said. \u201cThey know I\u2019m up there with those guys. They know I can fight any of them. But most of them are like, \u2018Man, you\u2019re not in the UFC, you\u2019re a nobody, and I hate that. That\u2019s people that don\u2019t understand the sport.\u201d", "description": "Douglas Lima would love Bellator to co-promote with the UFC and thinks he can beat any welterweight in the world, including Kamaru Usman.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "Simon Samano", "Nolan King", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Matt Erickson"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/bellator-232-douglas-lima-rory-macdonald-3.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
