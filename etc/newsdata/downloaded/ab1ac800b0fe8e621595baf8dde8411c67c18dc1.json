He\u2019s since criticized its \u201cpartisan misinformation.\u201d He wasn\u2019t entirely surprised by Smith\u2019s decision, he told Melber.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big loss for Fox News channel and it says something about the way in which the cable channel has been for years shrinking the news department and building its right-wing entertainment hosts, \u2019coz that gets ratings and ratings gets revenue and that\u2019s how they make money,\u201d Cameron explained. \u201cIt\u2019s a real sad day for people who watch Fox News and want accurate information because Shep was somebody you could reliably count on.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe executives know that this is a loss,\u201d he added. \u201cWhen Fox would say or do things that were demonstrably untrue, Shep would be the person that they would point to as a measurement of good journalism.\u201d\n\nCameron said that, without Smith\u2019s show, the majority of programming is now \u201cpredominantly talk, it\u2019s predominantly supportive of a president who is violating all kinds of American values, laws, rules, precedents, etc., etc., and the American people need to hear that so they can make good judgments Otherwise it\u2019s just propaganda, and that\u2019s the stuff of third-world nations, not the one that prides itself as leader of all nations.\u201d\n\nCheck out the interview above.\n\nRelated...\n\nGeorge Conway Cracks There's Really Only 1 Way The GOP Will Turn On Donald Trump\n\nDonald Trump Belittles Beyonc\u00e9, Jay-Z, Bruce Springsteen And Invokes Fans' Fury\n\nAlso on HuffPost\n\nLove HuffPost?
