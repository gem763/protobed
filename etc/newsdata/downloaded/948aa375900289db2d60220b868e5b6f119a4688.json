(AP) - Gov. Tony Evers has signed a bill that extends health insurance for immediate survivors of police officers and emergency medical workers killed in the line of duty.\n\nEvers signed the bill Wednesday. He said in a statement that ensuring survivors have coverage is the least officials can do for fallen officers and emergency medical workers.\n\nThe bill requires the state, municipalities, the University of Wisconsin System and Marquette University to cover premiums for spouses and children of officers and emergency medical workers who die in the line of duty. Coverage will last until spouses turn 65 and children turn 26.\n\nThe state will reimburse municipalities for the costs. State agencies and universities aren\u2019t eligible for reimbursements.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Gov.
