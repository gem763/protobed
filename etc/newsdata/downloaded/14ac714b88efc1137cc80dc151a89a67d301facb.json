That\u2019s the reason why there\u2019s a small flight into safe-haven products,\u201d said Phillip Streible, senior commodities strategist at RJO Futures.\n\n\u201c(However) gold is range-bound right now. There\u2019s $1,465 to the downside and $1,566 on the upside. We\u2019re just stuck in this range.\u201d\n\nOn the European front, the prospects of an orderly Brexit seemed dim as a British source said that German Chancellor Angela Merkel told Prime Minister Boris Johnson by phone that a deal was \u201coverwhelmingly unlikely.\u201d\n\nIn Washington, Chinese Vice Premier Liu He and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer are set to resume top-level trade talks on Thursday, ahead of a scheduled increase in U.S. tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods on Oct. 15.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s (gold) got a little bit of downside exposure because there are a lot of people reassessing what happened as they had been too bearish on the economic outlook and current conditions, and they\u2019re backing away from that,\u201d said Jeffrey Christian, managing partner of CPM Group.\n\nWhile gold could see a little bit of a downside in the near-term, it is probably going to head higher because of the global geopolitical uncertainties, Christian added.\n\nHowever, limiting gold\u2019s advance, the dollar climbed to a near one-week high on Tuesday, making bullion more expensive for holders of other currencies.\n\nInvestors are also awaiting the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s minutes from its September meeting on Wednesday for clues on whether the central bank will cut rates at its October session.\n\nLower interest rates tend to increase investor interest in non-yielding gold.\n\nAmong other precious metals, silver gained 1.2% to $17.64 an ounce, after touching its highest since Sept. 27 at $17.80.\n\n\u201cSilver is getting some benefit from the safe-haven buying and is tracking gold higher,\u201d RJO Futures\u2019 Streible said.\n\nPlatinum rose 1.1% to $886.50, while palladium climbed 0.8% to $1,673.25.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Gold prices gained on Tuesday, bouncing off a one-week low touched earlier in the session, as uncertainties over U.S.-China trade talks and Brexit drove a decline in stock markets and prompted investors to seek refuge in the safe-haven metal.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/gold-price-down.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
