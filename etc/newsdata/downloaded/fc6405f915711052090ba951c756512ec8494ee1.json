So f\u2013 him, the Amazon is burning up, I\u2019m glad he\u2019s dead, and I hope the end was painful.\u201d\n\nThis was Bill Maher\u2019s opening monologue on the news of David Koch\u2019s death.\n\nWhat happened to the kinder and more civil days of John F. Kennedy, Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton?\n\nFormer Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid told me recently that he \u201clonged for the Bob Dole days.\u201d\n\nGo to most shopping malls in America and you will find people of different races, religions and political groups, shopping together, eating together and laughing together. On athletic fields across America, players, regardless of race or religious belief, hug each other in victory and in defeat.\n\nAmerica is one of the most remarkable nations where people from so many diverse backgrounds live and work together. A predominately white population elected a black president.\n\nSo where do we get this notion of division?\n\nThe negativity does not emanate from our fellow citizens but from a segment of our political class. It is manufactured in the \u201cKingdom of DC.\u201d Brought to you by the political special interest dollars and spread by a desperate press, eager to keep ratings up. Fundraising emails don\u2019t do well with unity and agreement. CNN would be C-SPAN 4 without their division peddling.\n\nDoes Mr. Maher epitomize the attitude and spirit of the far left? And a prominent part of that media megaphone?\n\nWhen people state \u201cboth sides are guilty,\u201d let\u2019s ask for examples akin to Congresswoman Maxine Waters urging her followers: \u201cIf you see anybody from that cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd. You push back on them. Tell them they\u2019re not welcome anymore, anywhere!\u201d\n\nName the Democrats who were shouted out of restaurants like Sarah Huckabee Sanders or Ted Cruz? Who among the 20 Democratic presidential candidates condemned Mr. Maher for his ruthless David Koch comments?\n\nCan anyone imagine Tucker Carlson expressing glee and hoping George Soros experienced great pain if he had died? And the outcry if he did.\n\nWhat does this have to do with Romans 12?\n\nFor those of us who welcome and invite the leadership of Jesus in our lives, it exhorts us to forgive Bill Maher, and to want the best for him and to pray for him. \u201cBless those who persecute you \u2026 Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.\u201d\n\nJoin me in praying for not only Bill Maher and Maxine Waters, but for all on the far-left who promote socialism and ignore the violence of antifa.\n\nWhen Bill Maher retires to his rocking chair, will he find delight in knowing his estimated $100 million net worth came by ridiculing and denigrating his fellow human beings?\n\nIn all my encounters with David Koch, I only saw kindness, gentleness, civility and love of his fellow man. Having had a brush with death in his youth, he devoted his life to helping others, particularly the disadvantaged.\n\nKoch\u2019s generosity included $185 million to Massachusetts Institute of Technology for cancer research, $150 million to the Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, $128 million to New York-Presbyterian Hospital, $35 million to the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of Natural History\u2019s dinosaur hall; $26.5 million to M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, $26.2 million for New York\u2019s Hospital for Special Surgery, and $10 million to Jaffe Food Allergy Institute.\n\nLet\u2019s also pray for the restoration of the Democratic Party to its former John F. Kennedy spirit of \u201cask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country.\u201d A restoration to a time when you could disagree without being disagreeable.\n\n\u2022 Foster Friess was named in the June 2019 Forbes issue as one of the 10 most outstanding money managers of this generation. He now through Foster\u2019s Outriders works to help keep the Wyoming and national governments on the right trail and to promote kindness and civility.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
