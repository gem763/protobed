This way you're creating most of the benefits of being public without the cost.\"\n\nRokt's product is aimed at letting e-commerce operators promote goods that are not selling as well, by creating personalised offers for complementary products after a customer has completed a transaction.", "description": "Bruce Buchanan's e-commerce marketing start-up has brought on a big funding round to allow early investors to sell down their stakes, while remaining private.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3411%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_251%2C$y_21/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/a42fa8c445164a904e7d2e61a9660e8bfc8ec7e9", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
