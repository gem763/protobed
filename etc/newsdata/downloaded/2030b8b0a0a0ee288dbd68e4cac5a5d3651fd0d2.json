Give till cash now.\"\n\nBut the server told him it wouldn't open unless a customer ordered food, so he promptly agreed to buy a 99p cheeseburger, obligingly handing over a \u00a35 note.\n\nStaff then gave him \u00a3136 from the till and he fled.\n\nParra-Braun was jailed for five years on Tuesday after admitting two charges of robbery and two of attempted robbery.\n\nThe McDonald's raid was one of four he had carried out in just 12 hours in June last year before he was arrested.\n\nHe also tried to swipe money from another McDonald's, a William Hill and a Premier Inn. He fled the bookmakers with \u00a3170 in cash but staff at McDonald's and Premier Inn refused to hand over any money.\n\nSentencing him at Warwick Crown Court, Judge Peter Cooke said: \"I accept that this bizarre few hours in your life was the product of something of a psychiatric collapse you had suffered.", "description": "A robber bought a cheeseburger during a \"bizarre\" raid on McDonald's after staff told him the till wouldn't open unless he ordered food, a court heard.", "authors": ["Phoebe Southworth", "Julie Burchill", "Hamish De Bretton-Gordon", "Laura Freeman"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/09/TELEMMGLPICT000212490028-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq924vv4X9WkwDUuC7VESldOyUiEgLVD-8agGoBMlPuOs.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
