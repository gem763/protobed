Nevils details the alleged rape, which she says occurred in a hotel room during the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, in a new book by the journalist Ronan Farrow.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a Matt Lauer that millions of Americans watched on TV every morning for two decades. And there is the Matt Lauer who this morning attempted to bully a former colleague into silence,\u201d Nevils wrote in the statement to NBC News.\n\n\u201cHis open letter was a case study in victim-blaming. I am not afraid of him now regardless of his threats, bullying, and the shaming and predatory tactics I knew he would and now has tried to use against me.\u201d\n\nLauer was fired from NBC in November 2017 after the network received a complaint from one of his colleagues about inappropriate sexual behavior. The allegations in Farrow\u2019s book represent the first time the specific rape accusation has been reported against Lauer. Variety obtained a copy of the book before its release on 15 October.\n\nIn the book, Farrow also alleges NBC News prevented him from publishing a story about alleged sexual abuse by Harvey Weinstein. Farrow ultimately published the story in the New Yorker in October 2017.\n\nNevils told Farrow she was covering the Sochi Olympics when Lauer invited her to his hotel room. She had had six shots of vodka, Farrow writes, but \u201chad no reason to suspect Lauer would be anything but friendly based on prior experience\u201d.\n\nOnce in the room, Nevils said Lauer pushed her on to the bed, \u201cflipping her over, asking if she liked anal sex\u201d. Farrow writes: \u201cShe said that she declined several times.\u201d\n\n\u201cLauer, she said, didn\u2019t use lubricant. The encounter was excruciatingly painful. \u2018It hurt so bad. I remember thinking, is this normal?\u2019\u201d Farrow continues, according to Variety.\n\n\u201cShe told me she stopped saying no, but wept silently into a pillow.\u201d Lauer then asked her if she liked it. She told him yes. She claims that \u201cshe bled for days\u201d.\n\nNevils told Farrow that she had sex again with Lauer in New York after the alleged Sochi assault. She said she had told multiple people about the incident, but said she was concerned about the influence Lauer could have on her career. She has since tweeted her thanks to people who have supported her since she went public with the allegations.\n\nLauer\u2019s letter states that he had consensual sex with Nevils as part of an affair he conducted with her. \u201cThe story Brooke tells is filled with false details intended only to create the impression this was an abusive encounter,\u201d he wrote. \u201cNothing could be further from the truth.\u201d", "description": "Matt%20Lauer%27s%20rape%20denial%20%27a%20case%20study%20in%20victim-blaming%27%2C%20says%20accuser%20%7C%20US%20news%20%7C%20The%20Guardian", "authors": ["Oliver Milman"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
