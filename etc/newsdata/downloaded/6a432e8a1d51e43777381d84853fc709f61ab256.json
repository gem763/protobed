(AP) - A Detroit artist is working with University of Michigan students to create a mural depicting the school\u2019s first black student.\n\nArtist Tylonn Sawyer and the students want to honor Samuel Watson, a doctor who attended the Michigan\u2019s medical school in the 1850s. University researchers say Watson, who was of mixed race, passed as white while attending the school.\n\nWatson ultimately received a medical degree from the Cleveland Medical School and became Detroit\u2019s first elected black city official.\n\nThe mural is inside the Ann Arbor campus\u2019 Modern Languages Building. A related exhibition runs Nov. 18-Dec. 19 at the Institute for Humanities Gallery, and Sawyer is scheduled to speak at the opening reception on Nov. 21.\n\nSawyer says he was inspired by current efforts to censor or remove post-Civil War Confederate monuments.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A Detroit artist is working with University of Michigan students to create a mural depicting the school's first black student.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
