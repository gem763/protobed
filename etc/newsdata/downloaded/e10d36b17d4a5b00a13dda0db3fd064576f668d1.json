Few can fail to have bittersweet memories of past tangles with thorny brambles \u2013 one for the mouth, one for the bag \u2013 and though it takes a dedicated picker to amass enough to feed a family, they make a happy pair with their seasonal bedfellow, the apple, helping even the most meagre of harvests to stretch a little further. If you\u2019re lucky enough to have a glut, freeze them to enjoy this recipe throughout the winter.\n\nThe fruit\n\nThe perennially sensible Jane Grigson writes in her Fruit Book that, \u201cwhen you pick blackberries in the autumn, and gather windfall apples to make this pie, quantity and variety of fruit do not much come into it. You make the best of what you have. This is the way it should be.\u201d\n\nIf, like me, you buy your fruit, however, the biggest decision is whether, like Grigson, you believe apple pies are likely to have tasted better before the introduction of the bramley in 1876, or if, as per Rowley Leigh\u2019s A Long and Messy Business and the second volume of Slater\u2019s Tender, you favour these cookers for this particular recipe. Grigson herself recommends tart eating apples such as \u201cblenheim orange or belle de boskoop [the latter of which she asked friends to bring from France each January]\u201d, Day-Lewis calls, less prescriptively, for \u201csharp eating apples\u201d in her book All You Can Eat, and Jane McMorland Hunter and Sally Hughes compromise with a mixture of the two in their book Berries: Growing and Cooking.\n\nThough flavours do indeed differ, this can easily be adjusted with sugar and lemon juice, but the texture of cooking apples is very different from that of dessert varieties. While bramleys break down into a jammy paste when heated, eating apples tend to keep their shape, especially when added to the pie raw, as Day-Lewis suggests. Perfectly pleasant, if time is of the essence, but McMorland Hunter and Hughes cook theirs first, so that the bramleys disintegrate and the dessert apples stay whole but slightly softened. This feels like the best of both worlds: the pureed apples adding moisture while filling the cavity of the pie, and the chunks of dessert apple offering a contrast in texture to the soft berries and bramleys.\n\nThomasina Miers\u2019 recipe for spiced blackberry and brown sugar crumble cake | The Simple Fix Read more\n\nGrigson, interestingly, takes a very different approach, cooking down half the blackberries with the apple peels, cores and a generous helping of sugar to produce a fruity syrup that she then pours over the remaining raw fruit. It\u2019s delicious, but only suitable for a plate pie, rather than one encased in pastry, because it makes the filling very liquid.\n\nFlavourings\n\nIf you do have time to cook the apples, my testers and I all like Leigh\u2019s approach of frying them in butter and sugar, which adds richness to the filling, and McMorland Hunter and Hughes\u2019 splash of brandy. Neither rather decadent addition is strictly necessary, but both are delicious if you happen to have them to hand.\n\nSlater dusts his apples with a mere sprinkling of sugar, because he likes them \u201cfairly tart\u201d, but he tells readers with a sweeter tooth to heap on \u201canything up to a tablespoon per apple\u201d. This is a sensible approach \u2013 after all, apples, as well as tastes, vary greatly \u2013 but however much you add, I\u2019d recommend going for a brown sugar. We find McMorland Hunter and Hughes\u2019 dark muscovado too intensely treacley, but the caramel flavour of Day-Lewis\u2019 demerara or light muscovado works wonderfully with the sharpness of the apple.\n\nThe pastry\n\nEveryone uses shortcrust of some variety, and mostly plain, though seeing as Grigson is non-specific, I go for crisp pat\u00e9 sucr\u00e9e on her pie. A sweet filling, however, seems to me to demand a more savoury enclosure \u2013 Slater keeps it light and crumbly with a lard and butter mixture, but we\u2019re sold on Leigh\u2019s softer, yolk-enriched recipe. This is a pudding, after all.\n\nSurprisingly, only a couple of the recipes line the dish with pastry before adding the fruit. In my opinion, a plate pie doesn\u2019t offer a robust enough ratio of pastry to fruit here, but as Leigh notes, \u201cit is a challenge to cook the bottom crust properly: it needs a lot of heat from below, and a fair bit of time\u201d, so it\u2019s worth heating a baking sheet in the oven first to help with this. Sprinkle the top with sugar for extra crunch and, like Slater, you may find yourself moved to wave a little flag in honour of this national treasure.\n\nPerfect blackberry and apple pie\n\nPrep 30 min, plus chilling\n\nCook 40 min\n\nServes 6\n\n2 cooking apples\n\n4 crisp, sharp eating apples\n\nJuice of 1 lemon\n\n25g butter\n\n3 tbsp demerara sugar, or to taste\n\n1 tbsp brandy or rum (optional)\n\n300g blackberries, or however many you have\n\n1 splash milk\n\nFor the pastry\n\n350g plain flour, plus extra for dusting\n\n1 pinch salt\n\n200g cold butter\n\n2 eggs\n\nFirst make the pastry. Mix the flour and salt in a large bowl. Grate in the butter, then rub it in with your fingertips until it looks like damp sand.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mix the flour and salt, then grate in the butter and rub it in, before adding the egg yolks and a splash of cold water.\n\nSeparate the eggs, and set aside one white for later (give the other one to the dog, make a tiny meringue, or freeze it for bigger meringues another day), stir in the yolks, followed by just enough cold water to bring the mixture together into a smooth dough; four tablespoons should do it, but add it gradually.\n\nPinch off about a third and form both lots of pastry into a disc or rectangle, depending on the shape of your dish. Wrap well and chill for 30 minutes.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Peel, core and thickly slice the apples, then sprinkle with lemon juice to stop the fruit from discolouring.\n\nMeanwhile, peel, core and thickly slice the apples and sprinkle with lemon juice.\n\nHeat the butter in a frying pan over a medium heat and add the apples, two tablespoons of the sugar and the alcohol, if using, then fry for about five minutes, until they\u2019ve started to soften. Add the blackberries, turn off the heat and leave to cool completely.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Fry the apple in butter with sugar and a splash of brandy, until soft, then stir in the berries off the heat.\n\nHeat the oven and a baking sheet to 200C (fan 180C)/390F/390F/gas 6 and on a lightly floured surface roll, out the larger piece of pastry to about 5mm thick. Use this to line the base and side of a greased pie dish about 24cm wide, leaving an overhang around the edge, then spoon in the cooled filling.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Line a pie dish with rolled pastry, fill, top with a pastry lid and seal the edges with egg wash.\n\nRoll out the second piece of pastry. Beat the reserved egg white with the splash of milk, brush this all around the rim of the pastry lining the dish, then lay the lid on top, pressing together the two pieces of pastry all around the rim to seal; trim off any excess (if you like, you can roll this again and cut into shapes to stick on top).\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Pierce the lid so the steam can escape, bake for about 45 minutes, until golden, then slice and serve.\n\nBrush the top with more of the egg white and milk mixture, sprinkle with the remaining sugar and cut two holes in the top to allow the steam to escape. Bake on the heated baking sheet for 25 minutes, then turn down the heat to 180C (fan 160C)/350F/350F/gas 4 and bake for another 20-25 minutes, until golden. Leave to cool slightly before serving with thick cream or hot custard.\n\n\u2022 Is apple and blackberry pie the king of autumnal desserts, or do you have another contender for the crown? Which variety of apple do you like to use, and what else do you like to do with blackberries once you\u2019ve had your fill straight from the bush?
