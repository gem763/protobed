Our newest installment features Haley Joel Osment, who, at 31, has been acting on television and in movies now for a quarter-century. He rose to fame for his performance in The Sixth Sense and subsequently shone in A.I. Artificial Intelligence, Silicon Valley and \u2014 this year alone \u2014 The Boys and Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile. The actor talked to InsideHook about love, learning new words and his favorite teacher.\n\nWhat would you have dedicated your life to if acting hadn\u2019t worked out?\n\n\n\nI spent, and spend, so much of my free time following politics. I\u2019m still thinking about how I could potentially be more useful than I am right now. People pick their charitable and political causes, and I\u2019m at the point where I want to make a strong choice about where I can throw my efforts. I probably would\u2019ve put my time into either politics or conservation, as I\u2019ve always loved the outdoors. That\u2019s something that is urgent.\n\nWhat words would you put on your tombstone?\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s a trick question, because I want to be cremated. Although, I guess even that is now ruined because it\u2019s not very green. They\u2019re doing that thing where they dissolve pets now, and that\u2019s supposed to be better. Maybe that\u2019ll be approved for human use soon. That\u2019s a really tough one; I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve figured it out yet. Sometimes I think back to when I first started acting, trying to remember if I even imagined what life would be like at this age and beyond. I don\u2019t think I spent too much time thinking about it. I still don\u2019t. I am just focused on the next step.\n\nDo you have a favorite curse word?\n\n\n\nFuck. I like how there\u2019s still a disorganized relationship to what should get a movie rated R and what shouldn\u2019t, and what\u2019s permissible on TV. I like that cursing is not so hot anymore\u2014that having a bunch of curse words in a project doesn\u2019t cause as many problems as it used to, because that\u2019s how people really talk. All the variations of fuck are great because it can be positive, it can be negative. You can use it as every part of speech, and some people are really talented with that.\n\nBut not you?\n\n\n\nOh, no. This is my tried-and-true habit of keeping it clean in interviews.\n\nWhat is a great and possibly uncomfortable question to ask someone if you want the conversation to move past small talk?\n\n\n\nOn the set of Silicon Valley, one of the writers had a great party game. They go, \u201cAll right, What\u2019s your favorite album, and what\u2019s the worst thing you\u2019ve done to another human being? That\u2019ll move past small talk really quickly.\n\nNow, are everybody\u2019s answers real? That\u2019s the question.\n\nWhat\u2019s your worst habit?\n\n\n\nDefinitely procrastination. You\u2019ll just open a million tabs on your phone or on your computer and be like, Oh good article, I\u2019ll get back to it. I\u2019ll get back to it. I\u2019ll get back to it. And then it spirals out of control. Twitter only made that worse. For the longest time, it felt like this great moral stand to not have social media. I think that was definitely a healthier mental space to be in, to not be on those things all the time, but it wasn\u2019t like anybody cared if you weren\u2019t on Twitter or not. When I finally did join in like 2013, it was because a publicist was like, \u201cLook, this is how movies are promoted. It\u2019s just going to be easier to do things like that.\u201d And they were right.\n\nAt its core, it was a miracle of communication, it\u2019s just such a shame that all the other shit slonked in. I had a fifth-grade teacher that I really liked. He had some connection to JPL; I grew up in L.A., not far away. And it was cool, because a lot of friends\u2019 parents were involved in the Mars Rover and stuff like that. This teacher was a big booster for space travel, and would also say, \u201cThis internet, someday you\u2019re going to be able to get the best information.\u201d He had such a positive and optimistic view of what the internet would be. It\u2019s so funny for me to think back to that now.\n\nWhat\u2019s your favorite novel?\n\n\n\nCat\u2019s Cradle.\n\nIs George Patton still your favorite historical figure?\n\n\n\nI would have to say no. Patton sounds like something I just came up with off the top of my head when I was twelve, because I don\u2019t remember reading too much about his part of the war, as much as I did, say, D-Day. That was a big thing for me because I was working with Spielberg at the time, so he gave me some Stephen Ambrose books. I also was in Poland in 2000 shooting a World War II film with Willem Dafoe called Edges of the Lord, which I don\u2019t think ever hit theaters. It was a crazy experience. Actually being in Eastern Europe and shooting a movie in that period, really set me off on a World War II tear that continues to this day.\n\nI remember being really into FDR, as a great liberal president who took us out of the Depression, and now I\u2019m in a phase where I don\u2019t even know what historical figures to look up to. In the current era, it feels more appropriate to focus on the flaws of these people and to have a more reasonable relationship to those historical figures. For all of the good things FDR did, you also have to reckon with internment. It amazes me that people like Washington and Jefferson are held up as moral beings you could aspire to when these guys were slave owners. I think that\u2019s an uncomfortable part of being an American now that still feels really unresolved. There\u2019s a big divide between Americans who have no problem with that and Americans for whom that feels wrong.\n\nYou think more deeply about the American media ecosystem than most reporters I know. When did you start thinking about it? Was it just being on Twitter?\n\n\n\nI can actually trace this back to a studio teacher I had for many years, through elementary and middle school. She sadly passed away this year. Lois Carl was a classic New Deal liberal Democrat, and a lot of my obsession with presidential politics and history came from her focusing on that in social studies, when I was in third, fourth, and fifth grade. That was my favorite part of doing on-set schooling.\n\nLater on, I remember my angry teenage reaction to L.A. media being invested in everything Paris Hilton rather than what the Bush administration was doing at the same time. Which is, again, an overwrought teenage reaction to things, but that just made a big impression on me.\n\nObviously we have the media firepower for people to find out things that are important to them, and we are wasting it all on this silly nonsense.\n\nIt\u2019s been 20 years since you told a reporter that you loved learning new words. Do you still stretch yourself that way?\n\n\n\nOh, sure. I\u2019ll still do that thing where, if I\u2019m reading a particularly good article and there\u2019s something unfamiliar to me, that\u2019ll go into a growing list of words in my Notes app. But the embarrassing thing about this is, I still haven\u2019t managed to become fluent in another language. I\u2019ve definitely failed on that front. It\u2019s just so easy to speak English everywhere you go in the world. Sophomore year in college, I was going to try to do NYU\u2019s immersive Arabic program, because I really love Middle East history, too, and that felt like a cool thing to do. But then I ended up getting a job in a play and that fell by the wayside. Still have all the books, but haven\u2019t put the time into them.\n\nWhat\u2019s the last new word that you learned?\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s open my computer to see what I put down. I knew this word, let\u2019s be clear, but I remember that part in Succession when she criticizes some ad, like \u201cOh, that\u2019s jejune.\u201d He goes \u201cJejune?\u201d She says \u201cYeah, it means juvenile.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cI know what it means, I just thought that only assholes used that word.\u201d\n\nHow do you make love stick around?\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s one of those questions that you could instantly move past small talk with. I feel like it\u2019s the same for loving what you do for a living, or what you do in life, and for loving people, too. Not to go too digressive with this, but I feel like our generation is waiting on love more than have most generations in the past. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true, but it certainly feels like it. The numbers definitely show people waiting later to start families and settle down. The most obvious reason for that is economics and, eventually, the climate. I feel like most people\u2019s desire to have children gets cooled every time you see another Delaware-sized piece of ice crashing into the ocean. The question seems like an answer that I give to people when they say, How do you stay in the industry? or What advice do you have for people who want to act? My answer for that is I love it. I enjoy many of the other ancillary parts of being an actor, but I really just love the day-to-day of it, and the craft itself. So when it comes to other dimensions of love, with people and everything, I think it\u2019s being honest about who you are and who they are, and if you\u2019re going to love somebody, love them for who they are\u2014 not who you want them to be or who you might imagine them to be.", "description": "Life advice from the actor known for movies from 1999's The Sixth Sense to Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile and on shows like Silicon Valley.", "authors": ["Elon Green"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/unnamed-1.jpg?fit=1200%2C800", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
