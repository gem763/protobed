I really don\u2019t.\n\n\u201cI think Maddison has another level to go. I think there\u2019s a top team, if it\u2019s not Liverpool then United maybe, they\u2019ll be in for him. He can only get better.\"\n\nMaddison produced a typically energetic display against Liverpool in what was a real test to the Reds' perfect start to the season.\n\nIt took a controversial last-gasp James Milner penalty to earn Liverpool all three points.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nLeicester had levelled when Maddison made a run in behind Virgil van Dijk to finish low past Adrian, and McMahon feels the Leicester star would be a perfect option at Anfield.\n\n\u201cJurgen loves up and at them players, 100 per cent, non-stop work rate,\" McMahon added. \"He knows his full backs can create a chance, the space and can go for an overlap.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see Maddison sitting on the bench [at a big club]. Say he comes to Liverpool, I\u2019m not telling James Maddison to leave, but if I\u2019m Klopp I would be looking to sign a player.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s young, he\u2019s English, he\u2019s got a lot going for him. He changes the tempo of the game, why wouldn\u2019t he get in Liverpool\u2019s midfield?\n\n\u201cHenderson has been getting replaced for ever with Milner, Keita has not come on leaps and bounds, Fabinho is the holding midfield player.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a position there for him. If he came and he knuckled down, and he got his work ethic sorted, I see no reason why he wouldn\u2019t fit in.\u201d", "description": "The England international scored against the Reds in Saturday's Premier League clash at Anfield", "authors": ["Darren Wells", "Image", "Leicester City Fc Via Getty Imag", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20508169.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Liverpool-FC-v-Leicester-City-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
