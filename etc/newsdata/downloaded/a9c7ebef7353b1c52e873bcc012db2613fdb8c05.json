(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 U.S. peace talks with the Taliban are now \"dead,\" President Donald Trump declared Monday, two days after he abruptly canceled a secret meeting he had arranged with Taliban and Afghan leaders aimed at ending America's longest war.\n\nTrump's remark to reporters at the White House suggested he sees no point in resuming a nearly yearlong effort to reach a political settlement with the Taliban, whose protection of al-Qaida extremists in Afghanistan prompted the U.S. to invade after the 9/11 attacks.\n\nAsked about the peace talks, Trump said: \"They're dead. They're dead. As far as I'm concerned, they're dead.\"\n\nIt's unclear whether Trump will go ahead with planned U.S. troop cuts and how the collapse of his talks will play out in deeply divided Afghanistan.\n\nTrump said his administration is \"looking at\" whether to proceed with troop reductions that had been one element of the preliminary deal with the Taliban struck by presidential envoy Zalmay Khalilzad.\n\n\"We'd like to get out, but we'll get out at the right time,\" Trump said.\n\nWhat had seemed like a potential deal to end America's longest war unraveled, with Trump and the Taliban blaming each other for the collapse of nearly a year of U.S.-Taliban negotiations in Doha, Qatar.\n\nThe insurgents are now promising more bloodshed, and American advocates of withdrawing from the battlefield questioned on Monday whether Trump's decision to cancel what he called plans for a secret meeting with Taliban and Afghan leaders at the Camp David, Maryland, presidential retreat over the weekend had poisoned the prospects for peace.\n\n\"The Camp David ploy appears to have been an attempt to satisfy Trump's obsession with carefully curated public spectacles -- to seal the deal, largely produced by special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and Taliban negotiators, with the president's imprimatur,\" said John Glaser director of foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute.\n\nTrump has been talking of a need to withdraw U.S. troops from the \"endless war\" in Afghanistan since his 2016 presidential campaign. And he said anew in a tweet on Monday, \"We have been serving as policemen in Afghanistan, and that was not meant to be the job of our Great Soldiers, the finest on earth.\"\n\nHe added, without explanation, \"Over the last four days, we have been hitting our Enemy harder than at any time in the last ten years.\"\n\nThere has been no evidence of a major U.S. military escalation.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo defended Trump's weekend moves.\n\n\"When the Taliban tried to gain negotiating advantage by conducting terror attacks inside of the country, President Trump made the right decision to say that's not going to work,\" Pompeo said Sunday.\n\nTrump said he called off negotiations because of a recent Taliban bombing in Kabul that killed a U.S. service member, even though nine other Americans have died since June 25 in Taliban-orchestrated violence. But the emerging agreement had started unraveling days earlier after Afghan President Ashraf Ghani postponed his trip to Washington and the Taliban refused to travel to the U.S. before a deal was signed, according to a former senior Afghan official.\n\nAs Trump's re-election campaign heats up, his quest to withdraw the remaining 13,000 to 14,000 U.S. troops from Afghanistan remains unfulfilled \u2014 so far.\n\nAt the Pentagon, spokesman Jonathan Hoffman declined Monday to comment on the outlook for the administration's plan to reduce the U.S. troop level in Afghanistan to 8,600.\n\nDemocrats said Trump's decision to nix a deal with the Taliban was evidence that he was moving too quickly to get one. Far from guaranteeing a cease-fire, the deal only included Taliban commitments to reduce violence in Kabul and neighboring Parwan province, where the U.S. has a military base.\n\nThe Taliban have refused to negotiate with the Afghan government it sees as illegitimate and a puppet of the West. So, the Trump administration tried another approach, negotiating with the Taliban first to get a deal that would lead to Taliban talks with Afghans inside and outside the government.\n\nSome administration officials, including national security adviser John Bolton, did not back the agreement with the Taliban as it was written, a U.S. official familiar with the negotiations said. They didn't think the Taliban can be trusted. Bolton advised the president to draw down the U.S. force to 8,600 \u2014 enough to counter terror threats \u2014 and \"let it be\" until a better deal could be hammered out, the official said.", "description": "U.S. peace talks with the Taliban are now \"dead,\" President Donald Trump declared Monday, two days after he abruptly canceled a secret meeting he had arranged with Taliban and Afghan leaders aimed at ending America's longest war.
