Kelly said Saturday he warned President Trump nearly a year ago that he\u2019d be impeached if he hired a \u201cyes man\u201d to replace the retired Marine Corps general.\n\n\u201cI said, whatever you do \u2014 and we were still in the process of trying to find someone to take my place \u2014 I said whatever you do, don\u2019t hire a \u2018yes man,\u2019 someone who won\u2019t tell you the truth \u2014 don\u2019t do that,\u201d Mr. Kelly told The Washington Examiner. \u201cBecause if you do, I believe you will be impeached.\u201d\n\nMr. Kelly served as the president\u2019s chief of staff from July 2017 until last December. He spoke at the Sea Island Summit, a political conference hosted by the Examiner in Georgia.\n\nThe retired general said the president wouldn\u2019t be in his predicament if he were still working at the White House.\n\n\u201cI have an awful lot of, to say the least, second thoughts about leaving,\u201d Mr. Kelly said. \u201cIt pains me to see what\u2019s going on because I believe if I was still there or someone like me was there, he would not be kind of, all over the place.\u201d\n\nThe president tapped Mick Mulvaney as acting chief of staff after Mr. Kelly\u2019s departure. His first chief of staff, Reince Priebus, lasted only about six months in the job.\n\nHouse Democrats resumed their impeachment inquiry on Saturday, hearing testimony behind closed doors from acting assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian Affairs Philip Reeker. Democrats allege that the president pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to launch an investigation into former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination. The president said Saturday he remains unconcerned about the impeachment probe.\n\n\u201cThe Ukraine investigation is just as Corrupt and Fake as all of the other garbage that went on before it,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nMr. Kelly said the president needs more advisers who are willing to tell him the truth bluntly.\n\n\u201cSomeone has got to be a guide that tells [the president] that you either have the authority or you don\u2019t, or Mr. President, don\u2019t do it,\u201d Mr. Kelly said. \u201cDon\u2019t hire someone that will just nod and say, \u2018That\u2019s a great idea Mr. President.\u2019 Because you will be impeached.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cThe system that should be in place, clearly \u2014 the system of advising, bringing in experts in, having these discussions with the president so he can make an informed decision, that clearly is not in place. And I feel bad that I left.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
