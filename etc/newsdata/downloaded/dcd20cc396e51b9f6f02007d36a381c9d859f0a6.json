Further, Moses said he planned to speak with the coaching staff about getting Peterson back on the field.\n\nPeterson, the starter again after Derrius Guice\u2019s injury, said Moses\u2018 comments \u201cmeant a lot.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe understands what we\u2019re trying to accomplish here as a team,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cHe realizes the players that need to be out there that helps us accomplish those things. So (he\u2019s) a guy that\u2019s not afraid of speaking his mind and having confidence in what he says.\u201d\n\nThese days, Moses is increasingly willing to voice his opinion. In the spring, the 28-year-old told reporters it was \u201cabout time\u201d someone took a stand against an NFL team\u2019s medical staff, supporting Trent Williams\u2018 holdout. He wore Williams\u2018 practice jersey to a post-practice press conference in training camp. He even suggested referees have a bias against the Redskins in calling penalties.\n\nOf course, the more outspoken a player becomes, the more likely he could open himself up to scrutiny from fans.\n\nWhen the Redskins face the Chicago Bears on \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d in prime time, Moses\u2018 play will be under a microscope. Through two games, Moses has allowed six hurries, two hits and a sack \u2014 the most of any Washington offensive lineman, according to Pro Football Focus.\n\nBut asked about his sluggish start to the season, it wasn\u2019t a surprise to learn that Moses, too, had some strong thoughts about the topic.\n\n\u201cA lot of [the media] haven\u2019t played football, so you don\u2019t know what a two-and-three jet looks like, or a 12 dual looks like, so a lot of people that are talking about it have no insight on what football really is,\u201d Moses said. \u201cThey just look at the play and say, \u2018Oh, this guy is not blocking.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s one of our guys. It could be someone else.\n\n\u201cBut at the end day, we\u2019re not worried about what anybody else thinks outside. It\u2019s about the locker room inside and everything else doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nMoses said that speaking out is just \u201cbeing who I am every day,\u201d adding he feels like he has grown every year since being drafted in 2014.\n\nWith Williams still away from the team, the Redskins\u2019 offensive line has collectively tried to fill the leadership void from their star left tackle\u2019s absence. For example, every Friday the unit meets with Case Keenum and the quarterbacks at 8:30 a.m. to discuss protection calls and assignments to make sure everyone is on the same page. Keenum will tend to dictate the meeting, but all five starting linemen will chime in with their thoughts and questions.\n\nIn practice, Moses will make sure to encourage his teammates if he notices them being sluggish, center Chase Roullier said. Moses occasionally will also call offensive line-only meetings, if he feels it\u2019s necessary.\n\nEntering the season, the offensive line was thought to be a glaring week point. But in two weeks, the unit surprisingly has held up. The Redskins have given up only two sacks \u2014 tied for the second-fewest in the NFL.\n\nYet there are notable mistakes Washington has to clean up. After leading the league with 14 penalties last year, Moses has incurred two penalties through two games \u2014 holding and a false start. Another holding penalty was declined.\n\nAs an offense, Washington has committed 12 penalties, tied for second-most this season. Of those 12, eight have been offensive holding. League-wide, there\u2019s been a major emphasis on holding as it\u2019s up 66% through the first two weeks of the year compared to the same time period in 2018.\n\nThe drastic uptick has frustrated everyone from Moses to even Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, who said he was turning off \u201cThursday Night Football\u201d because of \u201cthese ridiculous penalties.\u201d Gruden called it \u201cpainful.\u201d\n\nThe challenge for the offensive line doesn\u2019t get any easier this week. The Bears have recorded seven sacks in two games and they have star defensive end Khalil Mack, a force who can single-handedly wreck an opposing offense. The Bears like to send Mack off either side of the line, so Moses will have to be prepared for him.\n\nChicago is exactly the type of opponent against whom the Redskins could really use Williams. But the tackle did not return this week \u2014 and possibly won\u2019t any time soon.\n\nMoses and the Redskins, though, have come to accept the seven-time Pro Bowler\u2019s absence.\n\n\u201cObviously missing Trent is a big piece of leadership, a veteran guy that you can\u2019t really get back, but at the same time, he\u2019s not here and we gotta, we can\u2019t dawn on that,\u201d Moses said. \u201cWe have games we have to play.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got games that we\u2019ve got to play and get it done.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
