I feel sorry for him, he\u2019s surviving on scraps.\n\n'I think he\u2019s starting to despair in what\u2019s around him. He\u2019s [Rashford] not moving.'\n\nReferring to a chance in the game that the United striker didn't capitalise on, Keown said: 'I don\u2019t want to have a go at him because I think he\u2019s a magnificent player but I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s waiting for there.\n\n'He\u2019s not getting the service. It\u2019s the combination of the two. It\u2019s very predictable and all too slow.'\n\nMartin Keown expressed concern for the striker, saying he is not getting the right service\n\nAlan Shearer said that the poor quality of the United side is having a detrimental effect on him\n\nShearer also weighed in on the Rashford debate, noting that the poor quality of the players around him is having a detrimental effect on the young striker.\n\n'This is the worst Man United team I\u2019ve seen for a number of years,' Shearer said. 'I wonder whether anything is actually saying anything to him [Rashford]. [He's] not moving in the box. He\u2019s making it far too easy for defenders.\n\n'It has to be a very frustrating time for him because that team is awful.'\n\nRashford will now go away with the England squad and hope that time with his national side will have a positive effect on his performances.", "description": "Alan Shearer and Martin Keown have expressed their sympathies for Marcus Rashford after the Manchester United forward extended his bad run of form in Sunday afternoon's defeat.", "authors": ["Ollie Lewis For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/23/19374034-0-image-a-38_1570401495671.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
