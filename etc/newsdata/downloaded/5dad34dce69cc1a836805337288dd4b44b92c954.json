James alleges that FedLoan, which runs the program for the Education Department, has miscounted payments, provided inconsistent information and failed to inform borrowers of their right to appeal mistakes.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThose breakdowns in the administration of the program, she said, have contributed to a large number of rejected applications for loan forgiveness, the complaint said. Fewer than 900 of the more than 90,000 applicants had their discharges approved and processed as of June, according to the Education Department.\n\n\u201cDespite a decade of honorable public service to our state and this nation, hard-working New Yorkers have been left with nothing but the runaround and broken promises,\u201d James said in a statement Thursday. The company\u2019s \u201cabuses have not only denied these dedicated public servants the benefits they have earned, but have undermined the goals of the loan forgiveness program.\"\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, seeks restitution for state residents it says were harmed by the loan servicer and to stop the continuation of those practices.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe loan-servicing company disputes the claims made in the case. Spokesman Keith New said the company was informed of the attorney general\u2019s intentions to sue last week and made several unsuccessful attempts to meet and discuss the accusations. The attorney general\u2019s office said it was willing to meet with the company but refused to delay the lawsuit.\n\nNew said the company has over the years cooperated with the New York Attorney General\u2019s Office and other state regulators to review borrower concerns and find resolutions.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the NY AG\u2019s Office\u2019s allegations are without merit, and while we continue our efforts to engage with the NY AG\u2019s Office to facilitate positive outcomes for all borrowers, PHEAA intends to vigorously defend itself in this suit,\u201d New said in an email.\n\nAD\n\nCourt denies student loan servicer\u2019s bid to dismiss Massachusetts lawsuit\n\nThis is not the first time FedLoan Servicing has come under fire for its management of the loan forgiveness program. In 2017, Massachusetts filed a similar lawsuit against the company, resulting in a failed attempt by the Education Department to squash the case on the grounds that its federal oversight of the company preempted state regulation.\n\nAD\n\nAdvocacy groups have also blamed the Education Department for lax oversight of the forgiveness program. Earlier this year, the American Federation of Teachers, one of the country\u2019s biggest teacher unions, sued the department, alleging it ignored borrower complaints about loan servicers providing inaccurate information and making administrative mistakes. The department has said it is administering a complex program created by Congress.\n\nAmerican Federation of Teachers sues Betsy DeVos over public service loan forgiveness program\n\nThe rules of the public service program are complex. They require borrowers to have loans made directly by the federal government, but until 2010 most federal loans were originated by private lenders. Applicants must also be enrolled in certain repayment plans \u2014 primarily those that cap monthly loan payments to a percentage of borrowers\u2019 income. But most of those plans emerged only in recent years.\n\nAD\n\nWith all of those requirements, few people could reasonably be expected to qualify for forgiveness at this point. The vast majority of processed applications were denied because borrowers did not meet at least one program requirement, which some critics say is a reflection of poor communication on the department\u2019s part.\n\nAD\n\nA recent Government Accountability Office audit said the Education Department never provided a written instruction manual to FedLoan. Instead, the company has had to interpret guidance that was contradictory or poorly explained, according to the audit. Investigators said poor communication between FedLoan and other servicing companies about borrowers\u2019 accounts results in miscounting payments eligible for the program.\n\nAD", "description": "New York Attorney General Letitia James is accusing Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency of haphazardly handling a federal program that encourages college graduates to enter fields serving the public good with the promise of having their loans forgiven.", "authors": ["Danielle Douglas-Gabriel", "Reporter Covering The Economics Of Education"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/BcWJ43rwlQIOWiQ7QDZAefOAHvo=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YFQ64YWQU4I6TJRABKIWK3L5WY.jpg"}
