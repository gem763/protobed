The tech firm\u2019s rival, IBM, was swift to dismiss the excitement. Google has not, it asserts, achieved the highly prized goal of quantum supremacy.\n\nGoogle published its claim in the journal Nature on Wednesday after an earlier report on the work appeared briefly on a Nasa website last month. The paper describes how a team led by John Martinis, leader of the research team working on quantum supremecy, built a superconducting quantum processor named Sycamore that harnesses the weirdness of quantum physics to crunch through thorny problems.\n\nTo demonstrate the device\u2019s computational prowess, the scientists set it the deeply contrived task of checking the randomness of a sequence of numbers. What the quantum computer rattled through in three minutes and 20 seconds would keep the world\u2019s most powerful supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Lab in Tennessee busy for 10,000 years, they claim.\n\n\u201cTo our knowledge, this experiment marks the first computation that can be performed only on a quantum processor,\u201d the authors write. \u201cQuantum processors have thus reached the regime of quantum supremacy.\u201d\n\nNot so, say the IBM researchers. In a blogpost written in response to the work, they argue that the Oak Ridge supercomputer could solve the randomness problem in 2.5 days, perhaps less, depending on how it is programmed. They add that because \u201cquantum supremacy\u201d requires a quantum computer to solve a problem that is beyond a classical computer, Google\u2019s claim does not hold up.\n\n\u201cGoogle\u2019s experiment is an excellent demonstration of the progress in superconducting-based quantum computing,\u201d the IBM scientists argue, \u201cBut it should not be viewed as proof that quantum computers are \u201csupreme\u201d over classical computers.\u201d\n\nStandard computers and quantum computers are radically different. While standard computers perform calculations with \u201cbits\u201d which must be either 0 or 1, quantum computers have \u201cqubits\u201d that can take any value between 0 and 1. Another quirk of quantum physics allows qubits to be \u201centangled\u201d such that the value of one is tied to the values of those around it. Make a quantum computer that is stable enough \u2013 a tough enough feat in itself \u2013 and it can, in principle, explore multiple solutions to a problem at once.\n\nSince the advent of the first experimental qubits, tech firms have been racing to demonstrate what the US physicist John Preskill dubbed \u201cquantum supremacy\u201d. Preskill coined the phrase to define the turning point in computing history when quantum computers showed their true potential by trouncing standard machines.\n\nGoogle\u2019s Sycamore processor used 53 qubits to plough through the arcane task its masters gave it. According to Pichai, the breakthrough is a step towards using quantum computers to solve real world problems, such as creating new drugs, designing more efficient batteries, and making fertilisers with less energy. \u201cWe\u2019ve already peeled away from classical computers, on to a totally different trajectory,\u201d a Google spokesperson told the Guardian.\n\nChristopher Monroe, a physicist at the University of Maryland and co-founder of the quantum computing startup IonQ, said Google\u2019s paper may be a milestone in quantum computing, but it was an academic one. \u201cThe problem is not likely to be useful for anything, except showing something that appears to be really hard using normal computers,\u201d he said.\n\nBut work towards useful quantum computers was \u201cmarching along\u201d Monroe added, saying the devices were likely to help solve a raft of problems from logistics to understanding the structures of large molecules. \u201cProblems like this can only be solved on a quantum computer,\u201d he said.\n\nSteve Brierley, CEO of the Cambridge-based quantum software company, Riverlane, said: \u201cIt\u2019s clearly an amazing achievement. I think this is going to be one of those moments when people look back and say that was the time that really changed this field of quantum computing. It is also a great moment in time to stop talking about quantum supremacy, which has unfortunate historical connotations, and move on to talking about quantum advantage that has a useful application.\u201d\n\nIn an accompanying article in Nature, William Oliver, a physicist at MIT, compares Google\u2019s achievement to the first flights of the Wright brothers. The Wright Flyer was not the first airborne vehicle to fly, nor did it solve any pressing problem, but it demonstrated a radical new possibility, the implications of which became clear only decades later. \u201cIt is what the event represented, rather than what it practically accomplished, that was paramount. And so it is with this first report of quantum computational supremacy,\u201d Oliver said.", "description": "Task that would take most powerful supercomputer 10,000 years \u2018completed by quantum machine in minutes\u2019", "authors": ["Ian Sample"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/206780f2af402a664c3e5be72000e8eb42f1e3b0/0_36_1721_1033/master/1721.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=46e996f11f27be0e6c1836d805833867", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
