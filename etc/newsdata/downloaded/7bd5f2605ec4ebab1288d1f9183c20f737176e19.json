Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $US942.6 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nThe company on average got $US42.82 in revenue from each of its 22.3 million active riders in its third quarter as a public company, an about 27 per cent jump in revenue per rider and a 28 per cent increase in riders over the same period in 2018.\n\nLoss-making Lyft and Uber have historically relied on heavy subsidies to attract riders. While the companies have said there are signs that price competition was easing, both are also spending to expand into other areas.\n\nLyft is now expected to be profitable on an adjusted EBITDA basis in the fourth quarter of 2021, chief executive officer Logan Green said.\n\nThe company had earlier promised that its ride-hailing services would be profitable without giving any timeline. But it had also warned that as a company it might continue posting losses as it invests heavily in self-driving cars, renting scooters and other ventures.\n\nLyft expects fourth-quarter adjusted core losses to be between $US160 million and $US170 million, compared with its prior forecast of between $US240 million and $US245 million.\n\nRevenue surged about 63 per cent to $US955.6 million in the third quarter ended September 30, beating the average analyst estimate of $US915.04 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nNet loss widened to $US463.5 million from $US249.2 million a year earlier, with costs rising nearly 70 per cent.\n\nThe company had a loss of $US1.57 per share compared with a loss of $US11.58 per share in the third quarter of 2018, as the number of outstanding shares rose from a year earlier.\n\nReuters", "description": "Lyft is now expected to be profitable on an adjusted EBITDA basis in the fourth quarter of 2021, chief executive officer Logan Green said.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3531%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_39/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/20b83563ee0b464c197d198131331cb389c8d0e4", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
