Two months after the sudden departure of Dr. Leana Wen as president of Planned Parenthood, the nation\u2019s biggest abortion mill has fought a two-front war on so-called \u201cgag orders.\u201d They have taken the Trump administration to court to fight one on themselves as Title X providers \u2014 and fought to impose one on Dr. Wen to keep her quiet about the tactics of Planned Parenthood.\n\nThe New York Times got its hands on a letter from Wen accusing Planned Parenthood of being \u201cdeeply hypocritical\u201d when it comes to transparency, and issuing a sotto voce threat to sue over discrimination or retaliation:\n\nIn her recent letter, she left open the possibility of legal action. \u201cI have no desire to file claims against Planned Parenthood for defamation, retaliation, or discrimination,\u201d she wrote ominously. She said that Planned Parenthood was demanding her silence \u201cin exchange for my contractually-guaranteed severance and continued health insurance coverage,\u201d calling the efforts \u201cunjust\u201d and \u201cunethical.\u201d Dr. Wen went so far as to invoke the recent Trump administration rules to accuse Planned Parenthood\u2019s board of hypocrisy. \u201cIt is deeply hypocritical,\u201d she wrote, that Planned Parenthood, \u201cwould attempt to enforce a gag order on its immediate past President/CEO while fighting the Trump administration\u2019s gag rule on Title X providers.\u201d\n\nOne has to go pretty far into the NYT article to catch this, but their lead is tasty enough. Wen accused PP of attempting to \u201cbuy her silence\u201d in the letter, which might only be an issue if it was for sale in the first place, which Wen strenuously denies. \u201cNo amount of money can ever buy my integrity and my commitment to the patients I serve,\u201d Wen wrote in the letter.\n\nPlanned Parenthood denies all of the above, but the fact that negotiations are still underway makes it clear that they want Wen to keep her mouth shut. It also looks like Wen wants something significant in exchange for quietly returning to \u201cthe patients that I serve.\u201d Former execs don\u2019t toss around allegations of \u201cdefamation, retaliation, or discrimination\u201d in letters unless they want increased compensation to settle any potential claims along those lines.\n\nLet\u2019s face it: if Wen wants to speak out, she can do so at any time. It might cost her, especially if she signed a non-disclosure agreement, which is pretty common with executives in any organization. No one can \u201cgag\u201d her if Wen chooses to talk; the question is whether she\u2019s willing to forgo the financial rewards of silence \u2014 and how much she can increase those by signaling that she wants to speak up.\n\nAnd speaking of hypocrisy, Wen\u2019s sudden shock, shock to find that Planned Parenthood stridently politicizes abortion ranks up there pretty high with PP\u2019s sudden love of gag orders, too. Perhaps the board told Wen that they wanted to change direction, but that seems doubtful. With Donald Trump in office, their obvious choice was to exploit La R\u00e9sistance\u00ae and double down.\n\nAt any rate, to put this fight into cinematic perspective, this looks like a brawl between Clubber Lang and Ivan Drago. Someone will get knocked out, but \u2026 it doesn\u2019t really matter who.\n\nNote: The NYT includes a very tragic note to all of this: Dr. Wen\u2019s miscarriage this summer, which played a small role in the conflict. Regardless of her politics, we pray for healing and better days for her and her family.", "description": "\u201cI have no desire to file claims against Planned Parenthood for defamation, retaliation, or discrimination.\u201d", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/wen.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
