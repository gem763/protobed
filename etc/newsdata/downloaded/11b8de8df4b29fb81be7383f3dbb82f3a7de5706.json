In July, he testified before a Senate panel that the FBI had more than 1,000 investigations involving economic espionage and attempted intellectual property theft, nearly all of which lead back to China.\n\nThe justice department has brought multiple cases in the last year involving Chinese espionage and has also brought charges against operatives working with China\u2019s ministry of state security (MSS), as law enforcement officials grapple with how to deal with an increasing threat of China trying to steal information from American companies.\n\nChina moves to stem damage from trade war with US ahead of talks Read more\n\nLast October, prosecutors charged a Chinese spy with attempting to steal trade secrets from several American aviation and aerospace companies, marking the first time an MSS operative was extradited to the US.\n\nAnderson did not say how long Peng had been operating as a spy for the MSS, only that the FBI employed a double agent in 2015 who conducted exchanges with Peng in the San Francisco Bay Area and in Columbus, Georgia.\n\nOver six occasions between 2015 and 2018, Peng would secure a hotel room and leave up to $20,000 there, authorities said in the criminal complaint. The double agent would then get a key to the room, take the cash and leave a digital card containing information, it said.\n\nPeng would then take the card and travel to Beijing to meet Chinese intelligence officers, authorities said.\n\nPeng was arrested at his home Friday and ordered held without bond at a hearing before the US magistrate judge Joseph C Spero. He is scheduled to return to court Wednesday.\n\nThe criminal complaint says Peng is a naturalized US citizen who entered the country on a temporary business visitor visa and became a permanent resident in 2006. Peng was naturalized in September 2012.\n\nHe holds an acupuncturist license from the state.\n\nIf convicted, he could face up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.\n\n", "description": "Xuehua Edward Peng used \u2018combination of age-old spycraft and modern technology\u2019, says US attorney", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bca2ac0216c60c6477b1f934354e446d71537b07/0_42_3849_2310/master/3849.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4eee0a9144841bc960aff8ada8527ea1", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
