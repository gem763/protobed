Currently the Fed expects moderate economic growth, a continued strong labour market, and inflation to move back up to its 2 per cent annual target.\n\nIn the statement accompanying its decision to cut rates, the Fed dropped a previous reference that it \u201cwill act as appropriate\u201d to sustain the economic expansion \u2014 language that was considered a sign for future rate cuts.\n\nInstead, the Fed said it will \u201cmonitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook as it assesses the appropriate path\u201d of its target interest rate, a less decisive phrase.\n\nKansas City Fed President Esther George and Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren dissented from the decision. They have opposed all three Fed rate cuts this year as unnecessary.\n\nSt. Louis Fed President James Bullard, who had dissented in September because he supported a bigger rate cut then, voted with the majority on Wednesday, an indication that pressure within the Fed for further rate cuts may have lessened.\n\nThe rate cut was widely anticipated by financial markets, but expectations for additional cuts after October have diminished significantly in recent weeks.\n\nWhile yields on longer-dated bonds showed little reaction, those on shorter-dated maturities that are more closely influenced by Fed policy expectations, moved higher. The yield on the 2-year note rose to the highest since Oct. 1 at about 1.67 per cent.\n\nU.S. stocks, down modestly before the Fed\u2019s statement, pared some of their losses and were little changed on the day. The benchmark S&P 500 Index, which had hit a record high earlier in the week, was down fractionally.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty much what was expected,\u201d said Jim Powers, director of investment research at Delegate Advisors.\n\n\u201cThe more important outcome is they removed the phrase \u2018act as appropriate.\u2019 It looks like the market is taking that to mean that there will be a pause in the declining rate path they were on beforehand. That\u2019s what was expected, and that\u2019s generally a good thing,\u201d Powers said.\n\nUNUSUAL JUNCTURE\n\nThe central bank and U.S. economy are at an unusual juncture.\n\nUnemployment is near a 50-year low, inflation is moderate, and data earlier on Wednesday showed gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 1.9 per cent in the third quarter, a slowdown from the first half of the year but not as sharp a decline as many economists expected and some Fed officials feared.\n\nBut parts of the economy, particularly manufacturing, have stuttered in recent months as the global economy slowed. Businesses have pared investment in response to the U.S.-China trade war that both raised tariffs on many goods, and also made the world a riskier place to make long-term commitments.\n\nWhile that has not had an obvious impact yet on U.S. hiring or consumer spending, Fed officials felt a round of \u201cinsurance\u201d rate cuts was appropriate to guard against a worse outcome. The Fed cut rates in July and again in September, and by doing so hoped to encourage businesses and consumers with more affordable borrowing costs.\n\nThe approach was successful in the 1990s when risks developed during another prolonged period of economic growth.\n\n\u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2019", "description": "'We believe that monetary policy is in a good place,' Fed Chair Jerome Powell said", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/jerome-powell-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
