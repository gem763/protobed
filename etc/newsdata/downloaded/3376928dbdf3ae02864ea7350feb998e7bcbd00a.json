He admitted earlier this year that the game is boring and doubled down on the notion in an interview with Bleacher Report published Monday.\n\nCHICAGO WHITE SOX'S TIM ANDERSON GETS HIT IN HEAD BY KANSAS CITY ROYALS PITCHER AS RIVALRY GROWS\n\n\u201cYou got to be a really big baseball fan to really watch it,\u201d Anderson told Bleacher Report. \u201cYou can't just be like, 'All right, I'm going to go watch baseball today,' because I don't even watch it. I don't watch baseball. I just love to play it, though, but it's boring watching it. I guarantee if you go grab anybody else on this street out there and be like, 'Man, you watch baseball?' I guarantee you, they say, 'No, man, that game's boring.' And I play it, I can't watch.\u201d\n\nAnderson was thrust into the spotlight this season for drawing the ire of Kansas City Royals players for his bat flips. He said in the interview that he\u2019s just trying to do \u201cdope stuff\u201d to draw fans.\n\n\u201cI think that's going to be the best way to get that crowd\u2014by just being realistic with it and just saying, '\u2019S\u2014t, we know the game is boring,\u2019\u201d Anderson said. \u201c\u2019We know the game's boring, man, it's a long game, we know it's boring.\u2019 So, you got to do dope stuff that's going to draw the crowd.\u201d\n\nIn 118 games with the White Sox this year, Anderson has hit 18 home runs \u2013 two off from his career-high of 20 which he reached last season. He\u2019s also leading the majors with a .334 batting average.\n\nCHICAGO WHITE SOX'S TIM ANDERSON VOWS TO KEEP DOING BAT FLIPS: 'IT'S ALL FUN STUFF'\n\nAnderson said he definitely is going to \u201cpimp it\u201d when he knows his baseball is leaving the park.\n\n\u201cThat's only right. You don't hit them like that every day. And when I hit it, you can just say that I blacked out from there and just emotions took over.\u201d\n\nAnother goal Anderson touched on was drawing black fans to the ballpark. USA Today noted that only 68 African-Americans were on major league rosters at the start of the season.\n\n\u201cBlack people don't really watch baseball, and I know that for a fact,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, I just try to go out and play hard. I think the cool stuff really draws the black crowd, and that's the bat flip and all the crazy stuff like that ... At that moment, I knew that the bat flip woke up the black crowd because I got a lot of feedback from the black culture. It was nothing but positive things.\u201d\n\nAnderson is at the end of his fourth season. Chicago will miss out on the playoffs for their 11th straight season, but there is a sign of improvement.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe White Sox will finish in third place in the American League Central. As of Monday, the team had six more wins in 2019 than they did in 2018. With Anderson having his best season yet, there sure is hope for the White Sox to improve and harness the potential of their young stars.", "description": "Chicago White Sox's Tim Anderson is trying to do more \"dope stuff\" to draw fans to the ballpark.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is An Editor For Fox News.
