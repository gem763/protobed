Show Hide Why are people protesting? The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement. Public anger \u2013 fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators \u2013 has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities. The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station \u2013 while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.\n\nProtesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city\u2019s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill. Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill. Why were people so angry about the extradition bill? Beijing\u2019s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges. Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a \u201chigh degree of autonomy\u201d through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as \u201cone country, two systems\u201d. The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland. How have the authorities responded? Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city's semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets. Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are \u201cfanning the fire\u201d of unrest in the city. China\u2019s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to \u201cimmediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form\u201d. Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong Kong\n\nWith Wednesday\u2019s announcement, Lam has now conceded to one of five key demands of the demonstrators. However, the chief executive did not respond to protesters\u2019 other demands, which include an independent inquiry into police behaviour, amnesty for those arrested, and democratic reforms to give Hong Kong residents universal suffrage.\n\nLam said she did not believe the government should establish an inquiry to look into police behaviour, deferring to an existing police watchdog agency, the Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC). Lam said she would be adding two new members to the council.\n\nInstead, Lam proposed \u201cfour actions to help society move forward,\u201d including pledges to follow up recommendations from the IPCC and set up a platform for dialogue, inviting community leaders and experts to advise the government on social issues.\n\n\u201cAfter more than two months of social unrest, it is obvious to many that discontentment extends far beyond the bill,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s replace conflicts with conversations.\u201d\n\nLam\u2019s announcement, which marks a volte-face after months of vowing not to back down to the protesters, comes less than a month before China celebrates its national day on 1 October, the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China.\n\nResponse to the withdrawal was muted in mainland China. On the microblog Weibo, news of the withdrawal appeared to be censored and there were few reports of the news in Chinese state media.\n\n\u201cShe has to do something otherwise it\u2019s going to be ugly,\u201d said Michael Tien, one of the pro-Beijing lawmakers who attended a meeting with Lam before her announcement. \u201cSo she is making this gesture now, this concession. There is a month in between where she was hoping things would die down.\u201d\n\nIn the meeting, Lam came across as calm and hopeful, according to Tien. \u201cI think she honestly felt that this could settle the score.\u201d\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the measure will calm protests which have morphed into a much broader political movement, much of it fuelled by public anger at the police and the government.\n\nPlay Video 0:53 Thousands of Hong Kong students boycott first day of term - video\n\nAfter Lam\u2019s speech, hundreds of protesters gathered Mong Kok in Kowloon, the site of several recent clashes, facing dozens of riot police. Across the city, protesters held a \u201cpeople\u2019s press conference\u201d outside Hong Kong\u2019s legislature.\n\n\u201cThis is like applying a band-aid to rotting flesh,\u201d said one protester, dressed in all black and wearing a mask and hard hat. \u201cThe withdrawal cannot compensate for our blood and tears over the past three months,\u201d another said.\n\nThe organiser of several large marches over the course of the protest, Civil Human Rights Front, said it would continue with protests until all five demands were met.\n\n\u201cThe withdrawal of the bill is too little too late,\u201d said Bonnie Leung, vice convener for CHRF. \u201cOne demand has been accepted so we maybe can celebrate a bit,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBut we see police brutality everyday, we have victims everyday. We cannot just leave it. Hong Kong people will still fight for justice and fight for the future of Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nThe protests have pushed Hong Kong, a major financial and business hub, to the brink of a recession, with businesses and shops suffering and investors reconsidering their presence in the city.\n\nOn Wednesday, Cathay Pacific\u2019s chairman John Slosar resigned, after its CEO Rupert Hogg left last month, amid pressure from Beijing on the Hong Kong airline whose staff have been supportive of the protests.\n\nA survey of private business activity released on Wednesday showed the \u201csteepest deterioration in the health of the private sector since February 2009\u201d, at the height of the global financial crisis. Ahead of Lam\u2019s speech, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index jumped 4%.\n\nThe protests have also pitted Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms, as promised under the terms of the former British colony\u2019s handover to China in 1997, against Beijing\u2019s authority over the city.\n\nEarlier this week, Reuters published a recording of Lam speaking to a group of business executives in which she said she would step down if she were able to \u2013 suggesting Beijing had strong-armed her into remaining in office.\n\nOn Tuesday, however, Lam told reporters she wanted to remain in office to see Hong Kong through a difficult period.\n\nHong Kong on brink of recession as protests and trade war take toll Read more\n\nLam\u2019s announcement came after a weekend of some of the worst clashes of the past three months as protesters threw petrol bombs and the police deployed water cannons, rubber bullets and teargas. On Sunday, protesters paralysed links to the city\u2019s airport, a major international travel hub.\n\nPolice were seen beating passengers in metro stations and arresting one bystander who was heckling them. A video on Tuesday, showed police chasing and tackling secondary students. In a separate incident, a young man was taken out of a rail station on a stretcher, apparently unconscious, after police had subdued him.\n\n\u201cThis announcement cannot change the fact that the Hong Kong authorities have chosen to suppress protests in a grossly unlawful way that has seriously damaged the people\u2019s trust and sense of legitimacy of the government,\u201d said Man-kei Tam, the director of Amnesty International Hong Kong.\n\nUniversity and secondary school students launched a class boycott this week and protesters have planned further action in the weeks ahead. It includes another attempt to paralyse the airport, and a rally outside the US consulate in Hong Kong, to call on lawmakers to pass legislation that would sanction officials deemed as suppressing freedom or human rights in Hong Kong.\n\nOn Wednesday, protesters remained suspicious of Lam\u2019s concession. \u201cShe\u2019s just doing this to try and disintegrate the movement. A lot of people think that,\u201d said a protester, who gave her name only as Katya.\n\n\u201cThe situation has escalated to a point where not even Beijing knows how to sort this. So they\u2019re using different tricks and lies.\u201d\n\n\u201cLam is famous for breaking promises,\u201d said Jackie Lee, 36, who said he believed the concession was an attempt to appeal to less extreme demonstrators, and split the protest movement.", "description": "Chief executive did not concede to other demands including an inquiry into police violence", "authors": ["Lily Kuo", "Verna Yu"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/612f9374931bc1523eaac28c29fc19959e8df4f0/145_243_4637_2782/master/4637.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=50e6cf75baeac65b32ebf88cf841cd48"}
