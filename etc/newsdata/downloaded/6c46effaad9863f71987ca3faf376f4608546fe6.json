She\u2019s looking for a dance partner, and said if VanZant is looking for a fight, as well, then she should just sign on the dotted line.\n\nBarber took to social media to respond to VanZant and proceeded to list the entire female roster herself (via Instagram):\n\nAll right so I\u2019m out here at the (UFC) PI getting my recovery in, and this thing, my little phone here just keeps blowing up about Paige VanZant trying to get a fight. She keeps going on and on about this respect, and this trying to get a girl from her girl power union to come out and fight her in the cage, and listen Paige, I\u2019m not looking to go out there and fight you out of respect. I\u2019m looking to go out there and sign a contract with another girl and have her actually show up, and I saw your thing on TMZ about begging Dana for a fight and listen, Dana White, TMZ, Paige VanZant, I\u2019m right here. I\u2019ve been waiting. So either sign the contract and show up, otherwise give me a contract with someone with the last name VanZant\n\nBarber is coming off a first round finish over Robertson at UFC on ESPN 6 that extended the unbeaten start to her career.\n\nShe called out VanZant afterward, but clearly she\u2019s not the only 125-pounder looking to get a crack at PVZ. Numerous strawweight and flyweight fighters have called her out, but in a more respectful manner that could apparently lure \u201c12 Gauge\u201d into a fight.\n\nOr you can meet me there December 14th? \ud83e\udd14 https://t.co/ShlMA3GHV5 \u2014 BriannaTheBull (@briannathebull) October 9, 2019\n\nThe Blue Corner is MMA Junkie\u2019s blog space.
