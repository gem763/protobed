Scotland (currently 10 points) would be eliminated.\n\nIreland (11 points) can guarantee progress with a bonus-point victory over Samoa (5).\n\nAn Irish win without a bonus point could open the way for a three-way tie at the top on 15 points if Sunday\u2019s game goes ahead.\n\nIn that scenario, the deadlock would be initially settled by total points difference, which currently stands at Scotland (+71), Ireland (+52) and Japan (+46).\n\nIf Scotland still have the higher difference after the last two matches, they would top the group. For second place and the other ticket to the quarter-finals, the process reverts to head-to-head results and would send Japan through thanks to their win over Ireland.\n\nShould Ireland end with the best overall points difference, they would top the group and Scotland would go through in second place after what would be their win over Japan.\n\nIf Scotland beat Japan with no bonus points for either side, they would pip the hosts on the head-to-head result and progress.\n\nDepending on the Ireland result, Scotland could also advance with a bonus point win - assuming Japan do not collect two bonus points in defeat.\n\nIf Japan gain a losing bonus point and Scotland fail to claim a bonus point, Japan would finish above the Scots and advance to the knockout stage in first or second place.\n\nVictory or a draw for Japan would seal top spot, but they would also go through as pool winners if they lose to Scotland by seven points or less but score four tries, delivering a rare two bonus points.\n\nFour years ago Japan won three games but finished third in their pool because of bonus points, pipped to qualification by Scotland and South Africa - the only time a team has won three pool matches and not progressed.\n\nLikely outcome: Ireland to qualify with bonus-point victory over Samoa. Too close to call on who joins them.\n\nPOOL B\n\nAfter the cancellation of New Zealand\u2019s game against Italy, the top three places are settled. New Zealand (16) top the group, with South Africa (15) runners-up. Italy (12) finish third.\n\nNew Zealand will play the Pool A runners-up, with South Africa playing the Group A winners.\n\nPOOL C\n\nThings are also settled here after England v France was cancelled. England (17) and France (15) are through to the last eight. Group winners England will play the runners-up from Pool D, probably Australia, with France likely to play Wales.\n\nPOOL D\n\nAustralia (16) and Wales (14) are guaranteed a place in the last eight but the pool\u2019s final match - Wales v Uruguay (4) on Sunday - could also still fall foul of the weather.\n\nIf it is cancelled, Wales would collect two points to finish level with Australia but would get top spot due to beating them earlier in the tournament.\n\nIf the game goes ahead, any sort of win for Wales would also put them top, although they would still top the group in the unlikely scenario of them picking up two losing bonus points.\n\nFiji (7) finished third to secure automatic qualification for the 2023 World Cup.\n\nLikely outcome: Wales to win last game against Uruguay, top the group and play France in last eight. Australia would then play England.\n\nQuarter-finals\n\nOct. 19 England v Runner-up Pool D\n\nNew Zealand v Runner-up Pool A\n\nOct. 20 Winner Pool D v France\n\nWinner Pool A v South Africa\n\nSemi-finals\n\nOct. 26 Winner QF1 v Winner QF2\n\nOct. 27 Winner QF3 v Winner QF4\n\nNov. 1 Third place playoff\n\nNov. 2 Final", "description": "A look at the quarter-final qualification scenarios on the final weekend of pool-stage action at the Rugby World Cup with potential impact of further Typhoon Hagibis cancellations.", "authors": ["Mitch Phillips", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191012&t=2&i=1439972575&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9B06S", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
