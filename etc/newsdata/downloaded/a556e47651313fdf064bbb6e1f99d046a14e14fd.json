A spiral staircase ascends to a luxury master suite complete with a boudoir-style dressing room and study that occupies the entire first floor.\n\nThe couple became the leaders of the Primrose Hill Set, hosting raucous parties attended by Liam Gallagher and his then-wife Patsy Kensit, Noel Gallagher and his then-wife Meg Mathews, actor Rhys Ifans and singer Lisa Moorish.\n\nThe spacious dining room and kitchen at the Primrose Hill which hosted raucous parties attended by Liam Gallagher and his then-wife Patsy Kensit, Noel Gallagher and his then-wife Meg Mathews, actor Rhys Ifans and singer Lisa Moorish\n\nThe property that Sadie shared with her ex-husband, Hollywood actor Jude Law\n\nHaving kept the house in her divorce settlement from Law, Frost raised her four children, Finlay, now 29, Rafferty, 23, Iris, 18, and Rudy, 17, under its roof. It is thought she is keen to downsize now they have grown up.\n\nThe couple's louche lifestyle was first disclosed by designer Pearl Lowe, wife of Supergrass star Danny Goffey, in 2005. She revealed the two couples began to sleep with each other in 2001 while on holiday in Greece. Lowe claimed that Frost pursued her husband, and that Law became 'obsessed' with her.\n\nFrost and Law divorced in 2003.\n\nIt has also been reported that Frost, now 54, was intimately close with Kate Moss and Davinia Taylor \u2014 nicknamed the 'loo roll heiress' because her father, Alan Murphy, owns a toilet paper company \u2014 at the marital home.\n\nLeah Woods (left), Kate Moss (middle) and Sadie Frost (right) pictured at the Astral Club, London in 1999\n\nFrost \u2014 who was married to Spandau Ballet guitarist Gary Kemp until they split in 1995 \u2014 has been dating Darren Strowger for six years.

'I don't think anybody is indispensable on the BBC,' he tells me. 'I may drop dead tonight and they may do without me. 'If they were trying to get one person on each week as a regular co-presenter, that would be a challenge, but this gives me something to react to.'\n\nJools Holland has fronted BBC2's Later solo for 27 years and is putting a brave face on having to co-host the new series with a different guest host each week\n\n'That fat boy in North Korea': Jackal author's real-life hit list\n\nHe was the youngest pilot in the RAF before surviving the attentions of the Stasi secret police as a foreign correspondent in East Berlin and later dodging mortar rounds while reporting on the horrors of the Biafran War.\n\nNow 81, The Day Of The Jackal author Frederick Forsyth is ready to become a hitman.\n\n'I don't think I'd have much trouble squeezing the trigger on that fat boy in North Korea \u2014 Kim Jong-un,' reflected Forsyth at the inaugural Chelsea History Festival when asked which current political figures he would most like to have in the cross-hairs of a sniper's rifle.\n\n'Very nasty piece of work he is. [And] I'm not too friendly with the idiots in Iran and their trumped-up charges,' added Forsyth, who had a thriller in 2013 entitled The Kill List.\n\nHis own hit list is quite extensive. 'So I would take five or six real world tyrants: Assad, who's massacred God knows how many Syrians; the head of the Republican Guard in Iran, who's a mass killer.\n\n'In fact, I'd put together a list of about ten.'\n\nModel Kiera Chaplin looks a real Charlie\n\nThere was no mistaking model Kiera Chaplin's illustrious lineage when she channelled the spirit of her silent movie star grandfather Charlie for a recent fashion shoot.\n\nThe 37-year-old daughter of the actor's son, Eugene, sported a suit and bow tie inside the Czech Republic's Grandhotel Pupp (left) \u2014 where the James Bond film Casino Royale was shot.\n\n'I guess you could say the suit is an homage, but I see it more as women empowerment and representing the new Chaplin generation,' Kiera tells me.\n\nKiera Chaplian, 37, channeling the spirit of her silent movie star grandfather Charlie for a recent fashion shoot\n\nBoris Johnson benefits from a judicious kicking, according to Katie Perrior, who worked for him when he was Mayor of London and recalls electioneering with him.\n\n'In Romford, Boris was talking to a woman and I said: 'You need to move on,' but he took no notice,' says Katie. 'I kicked him very hard in the shins and drew blood. He was talking to this lovely lady, but had no idea he was right outside an erotic underwear store.\n\n'I could see these photographers running towards us. I had words with him afterwards, saying: 'When I say move, you move.'

Meghan was first pictured wearing \u00a3380 Sarah Flint flats at the 2017 Invictus Games in Toronto and has since been seen in several of Flint's designs, including \u00a3480 tortoiseshell heels.\n\nDownton Countess's mobile contortions\n\nBlessed with a 5,000-acre estate and Highclere Castle, where Downton Abbey was filmed, the Earl and Countess of Carnarvon would appear to be spared the humdrum problems that beset the rest of us.\n\nNot so, insists the Countess. 'We seem to be in a bit of a mobile phone signal black spot,' says Lady C. 'I can be found leaning out of windows or standing on desks in an effort to hear.\n\n'As a child, I enjoyed climbing trees and cartwheeling, so I suppose it helped instil innovation and agility. The gift shop ladies explore their own agility climbing and dancing round the courtyard.'
