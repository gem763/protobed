Trump was using the inducement of U.S. taxpayer dollars to get a foreign power to intervene in our politics on his behalf. That he didn\u2019t specifically mention aid in the readout of one phone call the White House released Wednesday doesn\u2019t change the message he was sending. Trump was subordinating our country\u2019s national security interests to his selfish needs. He was willing to do anything to smear Joe Biden. And he was happy to offer up the services of our own Justice Department to advance the effort.\n\nTrump spoke to Volodymyr Zelensky (\u201cdo us a favor,\u201d the president said at one point) as if the newly elected foreign leader were the chairman of a planning board who could grant a variance for a Trump building project or a New York politician who could approve a tax break.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution, and a lot of people want to find out about that,\u201d Trump said to Zelensky, according to a rough White House transcript of the call. \u201cSo whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great.\u201d\n\nIt needs to be said often that there has been no credible charge that the former vice president did anything untoward when his son Hunter worked for a Ukrainian energy company. As The Post\u2019s Aaron Blake wrote Tuesday: \u201cUkraine\u2019s current prosecutor general told Bloomberg he had no evidence of anything illegal or corrupt by either Joe or Hunter Biden.\u201d\n\n[Henry Olsen: Democrats, beware: Republicans would make the rules in a Senate impeachment trial]\n\nThis is the kind of Trump hit job with which we are now depressingly familiar. No matter whom you favor for the Democratic presidential nomination, it\u2019s an outrage that Biden is being hurt by reports of Trump\u2019s own lawlessness.\n\nThere is nothing positive for Trump in the readout, which ratified House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s decision to open a formal impeachment inquiry. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting that the White House would release this thinking it would help the president,\u201d Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.) said in an interview. \u201cThey\u2019re so far down the path of corruption that they wouldn\u2019t see how it implicates the president.\u201d\n\nIt was, by the way, hard to miss that Zelensky told Trump: \u201cI stayed at the Trump Tower.\u201d Zelensky was clearly well-briefed that Trump cares mightily about his economic interests, too.\n\nThat the Ukraine allegations abruptly and fundamentally altered the politics of impeachment means that House Democrats need to act in a precise, expeditious and disciplined way. Battles over who has jurisdiction over what, lengthy arguments over what should and should not be included in the articles of impeachment, personality clashes \u2014 none of these should complicate action on what is now a clear-cut case involving a deplorable abuse of power.\n\nThis is why many swing-district Democrats who had been reluctant to endorse a path to impeachment are now open to acting. \u201cIf I had never heard the words \u2018Mueller report\u2019 in my life, I would have had concerns about these current allegations,\u201d Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.), who represents a district Trump carried in 2016, told me. \u201cThey are concrete allegations that are clear abuses of public trust, clear abuses of power. If true, these allegations are deeply, deeply damaging to our country.\u201d\n\n[Seven freshman Democrats: These allegations are a threat to all we have sworn to protect]\n\nRep. Chrissy Houlahan (D-Pa.), another first termer, said the Ukraine story \u201cencapsulated all the things I was concerned about with this presidency.\u201d\n\nMalinowski \u2014 who in May became the first swing-district freshman to call for an impeachment inquiry \u2014 said that while he believes that Trump had committed other impeachable acts, the effort to involve a foreign leader in our domestic politics is \u201can act that any patriotic American would agree is beyond the pale.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe more focused this can be,\u201d Malinowski added, \u201cthe more likely it is to unify the country, and the more rapidly we can conclude.\u201d\n\nThis new clarity of mission is why Pelosi\u2019s announcement Tuesday came as such a relief. Democrats on both sides of the impeachment question were never in doubt about the depth of Trump\u2019s venality, but they did not expect him to hand them so much ammunition to make their case. They dare not let internal politics get in the way of performing their duty.\n\nRead more from E.J.
