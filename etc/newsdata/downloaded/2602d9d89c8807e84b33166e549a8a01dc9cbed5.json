Lindsey Graham indicates he may support Trump impeachment if inquiry establishes 'quid pro quo'\n\nGraham called for the House to give the \u201csame rights to Trump as Clinton and Nixon,\u201d two former presidents, had during their investigations. The measure calls on House Democrats to hold a formal vote to open an impeachment inquiry.\n\nIt also calls for allowing Trump to bring forth witnesses in his defense and give Republicans, who hold the minority in the House, the ability to issue subpoenas, reiterating, \"House Democrats are even denying their own Republican colleagues basic procedural rights that the minority party was granted throughout previous impeachments.\u201d\n\nGraham's resolution comes the day after about three dozen Republican lawmakers protested how Democrats are conducting the inquiry, and temporarily halted the testimony of Defense Department official Laura Cooper by storming the secure briefing room. 47 Republicans on the three committees leading the investigation have access to the closed-door depositions.\n\nGraham also stated Thursday that Republicans are pressuring him to call House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff to testify, but said that would \"cause a lot of damage to the country.\"\n\nHolding a formal vote on opening an inquiry is not required under the Constitution. Schiff has said they will eventually release the transcripts of the closed-door proceedings, and hold public testimonies.\n\nSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has said such a vote is unnecessary under House rules.\n\nSenate Minority Leader, Chuck Schumer, hit back after Graham\u2019s press conference, staying that \u201cIf the White House & its congressional allies truly wanted an open, transparent process: The White House would provide documents Congress requests, not defy subpoenas.\u201d\n\n\u201cRather than stomp feet in a fit of staged political theater\u2014House Republicans must join us in getting the facts,\u201d he continued.\n\nIf the White House & its congressional allies truly wanted an open, transparent process:\n\n\n\nThe White House would provide documents Congress requests, not defy subpoenas\n\n\n\nRather than stomp feet in a fit of staged political theater\u2014House Republicans must join us in getting the facts pic.twitter.com/ABkS972Prs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) October 24, 2019\n\nThe White House has said they will not provide documents or witnesses to House impeachment investigators because it considers their investigation to be unfair and illegitimate.\n\nMore: Donald Trump applauds congressional Republicans for disrupting impeachment investigation\n\nGraham also stated during the presser Thursday that the White House is currently working on assembling a team to work on messaging surrounding the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cI talked to Chief of Staff [Mick] Mulvaney. I think they\u2019re working on getting a messaging team together,\u201d Graham said, pointing again to the impeachment of Clinton in 1998, saying he \u201chad a team that was organized, that had legal minds that could understand what was being said versus the legal proceedings in question, and they were on message every day.\"\n\n\"President Clinton defended himself but he never stopped being president,\" Graham reiterated.\n\nLast week, Mulvaney acknowledged that aid to Ukraine was withheld in part because of the president's desire for the country to investigate potential corruption regarding U.S. domestic politics, then walked back his comments.\n\nGraham ended the presser with, \u201cI\u2019m not here to tell you that Donald Trump has done nothing wrong\u201d but insisted the process be fair.\n\nContributing: William Cummings, Nicholas Wu, Jeanine Santucci, Bart Jansen, David Jackson and John Fritze.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Lindsey Graham touts resolution condemning Trump impeachment inquiry", "description": "During a press conference, Sen.
