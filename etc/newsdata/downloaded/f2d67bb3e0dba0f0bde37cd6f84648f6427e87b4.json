The latest trigger was the imposition of regulatory curbs on regional lender Punjab & Maharashtra Co-operative Bank Ltd., which pushed depositors to swarm branches to withdraw their savings.\n\nWhile PMC is far smaller than India\u2019s top tier of lenders known as \u201ccommercial banks,\u201d it is one of the biggest lenders in the second tier known as cooperative banks. At 0.2% of the sector\u2019s total loans, PMC doesn\u2019t immediately pose a systemic risk.\n\nAuthorities however seem concerned about an erosion of confidence after the Reserve Bank of India on Tuesday capped withdrawals from PMC at 1,000 rupees ($14) -- just about enough to buy a quarterly train pass in Mumbai -- and barred the lender from fresh lending for six months.\n\nIt didn\u2019t offer any reasons for the move but PMC\u2019s Managing Director Joy Thomas told BloombergQuint on Wednesday that the regulator is investigating the bank\u2019s books for bad loans and the bank has enough cash to repay all deposits and other obligations without any support from the government.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Suvashree Ghosh in Mumbai at sghosh186@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Marcus Wright at mwright115@bloomberg.net, Jeanette Rodrigues, Abhay Singh\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Indian authorities are scrambling to suppress speculation about bank closures a day after the regulator imposed restrictions on a local lender, the latest indication of how jittery savers are amid a slowing economy and scandals in the financial system.\u201cReports appearing in some sections", "authors": ["Suvashree Ghosh"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.nCZBCZXNtYqfPglUaJRbw--~B/aD05OTk7dz0yMDAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/cbf512d3c03b9dd2d9430b470fe7fcab", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
