Curious, he opened the case to find a glittering gilded crown inside.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe my eyes,\u201d Mr. Sirak, who moved to the Netherlands a political refugee in the 1970s, said in a recent interview in Amsterdam. \u201cI felt betrayed. Using my house to smuggle cultural heritage from Ethiopia? I knew it had something to do with Ethiopian history, the Ethiopian kingdom. I knew this is not good.\u201d\n\nMr. Sirak said that he felt he couldn\u2019t return the crown to the Ethiopian authorities, because he suspected that the government might have been complicit in the theft, and he feared that it would be stolen again.\n\nHe also didn\u2019t want to hand it over to the Dutch authorities, because he worried that a museum would keep the crown forever rather than returning it when a new Ethiopian government was in place.", "description": "A Dutch civil servant says he hid the precious artifact away in his home for more than 20 years.
