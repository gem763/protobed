Aid to the Church in Need noted that Beijing banned all sales of the legitimate text of the Bible in April 2018, promising access to an \u201cimproved,\u201d pro-communist version of the Bible.\n\nChina announced the launch of a \u201csocial credit system\u201d to regulate all human behavior in 2018, scheduling its full implementation for 2020. The system ascribes points to each individual based on how much the Communist Party approves of them. Individuals the Party disapproves of may be banned from travel, prevented from using core social programs, or otherwise limited in their freedom.\n\nAs of March 2019, the trial version of the social credit system has blacklisted over 13 million people.\n\n\u201cThere are fears that China\u2019s new \u2018social credit system\u2019 \u2013 designed to reward good citizenship and punish bad \u2013 will be used to discriminate against Christians,\u201d the charity explains. The fears are tied to police raids on \u201chouse\u201d churches, which increased in frequency during the time the report covered, and \u201ccash rewards for those who inform on underground churches and other \u2018unofficial\u2019 places of worship,\u201d a policy implemented this year in Guangzhou. Cash rewards indicate that the government might also reward the persecution of Christians with high \u201csocial credit\u201d scores.\n\nXi Jinping also imposed new regulations that limit the ability of parents to expose children to religion. China banned children under 18 from attending services at churches, mosques, or other religious locations. According to the report released this week, Xi has also restructured education to promote atheist Marxism. The report said:\n\nEducation is used as a tool of social conditioning: in some regions pupils were reportedly required to sign a statement saying they will \u201cpromote atheism, and oppose belief in God.\u201d In other areas problems continue. Christian clergy are still subject to arbitrary arrest and building regulations are increasingly used as a pretext for church demolitions.\n\nThe report also notes that China is a focal point for regional human trafficking, attracting enslaved Christian women and girls from places like Burma.\n\nXi has actively made moves to replace Christianity with a cult of personality with himself at the center. Reports surfaced in 2017 that Chinese government officials had begun pressuring rural Christians to replace crosses in their homes with photos of Xi Jinping. Last month, a report revealed that Chinese officials were forcing \u201clegal\u201d churches to replace the Ten Commandments with an assortment of Xi quotes.\n\nChinese Christians who have escaped repression note that Xi has used violence to crack down on all religions, but, China Aid founder Bob Fu said last year, he has \u201canimosity against Christianity in particular.\u201d\n\nUnlike with Christians, Xi has established concentration camps for Muslims in western Xinjiang province, home to the largest population of ethnic Uyghurs. Beijing treats Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and Kyrgyz with particular brutality, targeting their ethnicity but not Hui and other ethnic Muslim groups.\n\n\u201c[China] is in a league of its own [when it comes to human rights violations],\u201d U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in April. \u201cThe [oppression] work that began in Tibet is now being perfected in [Uighur-majority] Xinjiang [province] is Orwellian in nature. Our efforts are diplomatic that is we identify this as something the Chinese can\u2019t continue to do.\u201d\n\nIn Hong Kong, where China has attempted to fully impose communism but failed in part thanks to a growing protest movement, Christians have joined pro-democratic forces. In September, a group of Christians organized a \u201cprayer walk for sinners\u201d against police repression and violence by pro-China thugs. The event attracted about 1,000 people, many singing hymns and carrying religious paraphernalia.\n\nThe Christian song \u201cSing Hallelujah to the Lord\u201d has also become a Hong Kong protest anthem.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "Chinese Christians fear that they will lose points in the nation's \"social credit system\" simply for their faith.", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/02/china-boy-praying-christian-catholic-2012-getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
