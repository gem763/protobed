In fact, every extra year of exposure to better childhood environments improved outcomes.\n\nDownward mobility is also critical. White men from affluent families are likely to stay affluent as adults. But black men from affluent backgrounds are nearly just as likely to end up in the bottom tier of the income distribution than the top tier.\n\n\"If you think of achieving the American dream as climbing an income ladder for white Americans, it\u2019s more like being on a treadmill for black Americans. Even after you've made the climb up in one generation, there are tremendous structural forces that tend to push you back down in the next generation and you have to make the climb again.\"\n\n\u2014 Raj Chetty, speaking at the Results for America Summit in Washington, D.C.\n\nAnd the disparities are likely to worsen over the next decade.\n\nBy 2030, African American workers stand to lose hundreds of thousands of jobs as a result of increased automation, widening the racial wealth gap and weighing down overall U.S. growth, according to a report from McKinsey & Co.\n\nThe bottom line: A strong national economy only goes so far. The most important factor in determining upward mobility is the conditions in the half-mile radius around where you live, Chetty said.\n\n\"While we often think of the decline of the American dream as a national problem \u2014 a challenge we\u2019d like to solve through federal policy solutions \u2014 I really think the roots of these issues are at the very local level.\"\n\nGo deeper:", "description": "Smart, efficient news worthy of your time, attention, and trust", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://assets.axios.com/203e9f932cc97836ac2ff4c6c982676c.png", "published_at": "2019-02-25"}
