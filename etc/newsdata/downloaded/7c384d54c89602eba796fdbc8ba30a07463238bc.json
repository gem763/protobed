Only a decade after the birth of the health service, polio cases dropped dramatically as a result of the introduction of routine vaccination.\n\nThanks to greater public awareness, improved research and better health services, we have seen devastating conditions \u2013 including polio and smallpox \u2013 go from being a common concern for every family to relics of a bygone era.\n\nUntil recently we thought the same was true for measles. But worryingly, the World Health Organisation has announced that our country is no longer measles-free.\n\nAnd just last week it was confirmed that the vaccination rate for two-year-olds getting their first MMR dose has dropped for the fifth consecutive year, hitting 90.3 per cent, leaving one in ten children at risk.\n\nCrucially, this rate is below the 95 per cent threshold where a critical mass of people is protected, creating a \u2018herd immunity\u2019 that keeps the whole population safe. That matters, because for children who can\u2019t be vaccinated \u2013 for example, if they are being treated for cancer \u2013 their life depends on other children having had the jab to keep infection at bay.\n\nSo getting vaccinated against killer diseases is not only safe but essential to keeping you, your family and your community healthy.\n\nIn some areas, particularly in London, one child in three is not receiving the two jabs necessary for full MMR immunity (pictured the MMR vaccine)\n\nDropped rates of vaccination mean many more people are vulnerable and exposed to risk, and all it takes for a whole society to be in danger is for one person to catch a disease and start a contagion.\n\nThe recent World Health Organisation report warned that Brits have effectively imported illness following holidays abroad.\n\nThere are, of course, complex reasons why someone may not get their child protected, with no single reason being pinpointed for the steady decline.\n\nOver the coming year, the NHS is going to be making it easier for parents to get their children vaccinated, and GP practices continue to play a key part in vaccinating young people who have missed out.\n\nThere\u2019s also a lively debate about whether children should be expected to be up to date with immunisations before they can start school.\n\nBut among those factors that experts cite for the drop in uptake of this simple health precaution is so-called \u2018vaccine hesitancy\u2019. In the 1990s, a concerted and discredited effort by disgraced doctor Andrew Wakefield scared people into thinking vaccinations were dangerous. His toxic legacy lingers, with some still believing his pseudoscience and spurious claims.\n\nSimon Stevens, the head of NHS England, says school gates have become \u2018breeding grounds\u2019 for toxic myths about childhood jabs (stock image)\n\nTelling parents it\u2019s dangerous to get vaccinated is like telling them it\u2019s dangerous for their child to look left and right before crossing the street.\n\nThe Lancet medical journal reported recently that \u2018vaccine-hesitant\u2019 parents are not just those who are unaware of immunisation, but actually those who have sought out \u2013 often online \u2013 additional information, and no doubt reassurance, about vaccinations. This means that, cruelly, it can be parents who go the extra mile to try to do the right thing and make an informed decision \u2013 whether by doing more research online, asking their friends or fellow parents \u2013 who are liable to stumble on and be deceived by \u2018fake news\u2019.\n\nIn this way the school gates themselves can be a breeding ground for harmful myths to catch on, spread and ultimately infect parents\u2019 judgment.\n\nThat parents\u2019 efforts and anxiety to make the right decision for their children are jeopardised by wilful misinformation is unacceptable. Fortunately, some firms are taking action in response to my calls to both clamp down on fake news and help parents navigate to a safe haven of verified information online.\n\nInstagram has committed to blocking content on its site that promotes demonstrably false health news, Facebook has said it will use its algorithms to make this dangerous content less prominent, Twitter is bringing in a function to direct people to legitimate health resources and Google improved its search function so it prioritises NHS information on vaccinations.\n\nSo, when people search for information on vaccinations, they get the right information first time.\n\nWith parents often taking their cue from other mums and dads, there must be a zero-tolerance approach to misinformation, while the Government\u2019s strategy on improving vaccination levels will help to drive action.\n\nWhile the National Health Service and the families we help must continue to demand more concerted action from websites to stamp out efforts to mislead mums, dads and carers, there are thankfully simple steps they can take to shut out the noise and keep children safe.\n\nThe MMR vaccine is given through two quick and pain-free jabs: one at age one and the next at three years and four months. Both doses are essential for immunity to take effect.\n\nFor any parent in doubt, the health service is making verified information more accessible: the NHS website \u2013 nhs.uk \u2013 is now a trusted source of evidence-based advice, including on the importance of vaccinations.\n\nIn a world where often so much of the focus is on new drugs and cutting-edge technology, one of the most effective tools for keeping us all safe is a simple, free jab, conveniently available at your local GP practice, which can save the life of your child or grandchild.", "description": "SIMON STEVENS: Getting vaccinated against killer diseases is not only safe but essential to keeping you, your family and your community healthy.", "authors": ["Simon Stevens Chief Executive Of Nhs England For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/23/19609284-0-image-a-76_1570831824469.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
