He declined to answer them.\n\nBrown\u2019s tenure was just the latest self-inflicted controversy for the reigning Super Bowl champions. The club\u2019s initial silence and resistance to sidelining Brown while the N.F.L. investigated drew immediate criticism from fans who said the team ignored serious allegations in pursuit of wins. That followed an off-season during which the team\u2019s owner, Robert Kraft, faced charges of paying for sexual favors.\n\nThe Patriots\u2019 success on the field is unmatched this century. They are a mainstay of the post-season and have won the Super Bowl six times. But the team has become almost as well-known for a series of unusual \u2014 and sometimes disturbing \u2014 issues and events of the past decade. Whether it was a star tight end being convicted of murder and later killing himself in prison, or conspiracies to steal plays from opponents and underinflate footballs to allow quarterback Tom Brady to pass better, or Kraft getting wrapped up in a sting investigation of a Florida nail salon, the Patriots have maintained a kind of dual existence as a model franchise for winning and never-ending soap opera off the field.\n\nThen came the decision 12 days ago to sign Brown.\n\nThe text messages, first reported by Sports Illustrated, were sent Wednesday night by a number Brown used to initially communicate with the woman two years ago. They were sent to a group that included Brown\u2019s lawyer, Darren Heitner, and seemed to encourage a third party to research the woman\u2019s history. The texts included a photograph of her children.\n\nBrown was instructed by the league and the Patriots to cease communicating with the woman, according to a statement from Katz and Banks.\n\n\u201cThe N.F.L. advised us that the Patriots directed Mr. Brown to have no further contact with our client, either directly or through his associates,\u201d they said. \u201cThe N.F.L. also advised us that it contacted Mr. Brown\u2019s representative and reiterated that Mr. Brown was to cease and desist efforts to contact or intimidate our client.\u201d", "description": "Brown\u2019s brief, rocky tenure with New England ended the same day that N.F.L. officials spoke with an artist who accused the star wide receiver of unwanted sexual advances.", "authors": ["Victor Mather", "Kevin Draper"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/20/sports/20brown/20brown-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
