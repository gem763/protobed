Her journey to the Ivy League was no easy feat. The overall acceptance rate for Perez\u2019s UPenn class of 2023 was a record-low 7.4 percent. And as a low-income Latina and first in her family to go to college, Perez had additional obstacles to overcome.\n\nWhen she was growing up, her mother emphasized the importance of education and how it has the possibility to change her life. That\u2019s why she will remember March 28, 2019 \u2014 the day she was accepted to UPenn \u2014 as the \u201cbest day\u201d of her life.\n\nHer parents immigrated to the United States 20 years ago from Colombia. \u201cThey obviously had to leave behind their family, their jobs, life as they knew it. They had to start over completely, and they had this dream of having a child that would one day be bilingual and have the opportunities that they didn\u2019t,\u201d Perez said in an interview with Yahoo News. \u201cI love my parents, they\u2019ve been the best support system, but obviously it\u2019s hard because neither of them went to college.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I was applying to colleges ... I had no idea where to start,\u201d Perez said. She also attended a public high school that didn\u2019t offer specific support for students applying to college. \u201cI would try my hardest to navigate the things that I did know, like the SAT, but my parents couldn\u2019t afford tutors. They couldn\u2019t afford to send me to a prep class, so I had to do it all on my own.\u201d\n\nNavigating the college application process, Perez battled some inner thoughts: \u201cI always had this thing in the back of my head of like, \u2018You can't afford college.\u2019 And there was constantly this idea of \u2018Oh, well you\u2019re first-generation, like you\u2019re not smart enough to go to college.\u2019\u201d\n\nMichelle Mahecha Perez poses alongside her Mother and Father. More\n\nAccording to a Pew Research study, Hispanic college enrollment in public and private colleges increased 180 percent from 1.3 million in 1999 to 3.6 million in 2016. Even though progress is being made, Hispanics still lag behind blacks, Asians and whites in obtaining four-year degrees, according to Pew.\n\n\u201cMany Latino students are first-generation college goers, and that brings with it multiple opportunities and challenges. The challenges are that you really have to be prepared to be very resourceful,\u201d Sarita Brown told Yahoo News. Brown is the president and co-founder of Excelencia in Education, a nonprofit dedicated to accelerating Latino success in higher education.\n\nPerez\u2019s turning point came when she discovered a flyer for Latino U, an organization that helps first-generation low-income Latinx students attend college. \u201cLatino U really helped my [family] understand what college is in America, and how the process works. \u2026 My relationship with my parents has only flourished since then because they\u2019ve seen what it really takes to get here,\u201d said Perez.\n\n\u201cFor Latinx students or for students of color period, I think it\u2019s kind of an uphill battle because we\u2019re trying to function in a system that wasn\u2019t necessarily made for us,\u201d Mara Dorta told Yahoo News. Dorta, who has a master\u2019s degree from New York University, experienced a similar journey to Perez being the first in her family to navigate the college application process.\n\n\u201cMy parents immigrated here from Puerto Rico back in the \u201960s. \u2026 They made a family in Bushwick, Brooklyn, and we survived all six of us in a two-bedroom tenement.\u201d She attended a public high school and faired well academically, but wasn\u2019t given the tools to prepare for an exam like the SAT. Discouraged by her guidance counselor, she only applied to two state schools and got into one in Buffalo, N.Y. \u201cIt was a terrible fit. \u2026 I had no resources on campus. I didn\u2019t know where to go, who to reach out to, to try to find community,\u201d Dorta recalled. She ended up leaving in 2000 and felt like \u201ca complete failure.\u201d", "description": "Yahoo News brings you this exclusive video in celebration of Latinx Heritage Month.
