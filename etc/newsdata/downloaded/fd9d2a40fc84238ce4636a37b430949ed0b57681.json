And you know what? That was the only thing I agreed with him on,\u201d Mr. Trump said Monday.\n\nMr. Trump made a similar remark about Mr. Obama in February. At the time, Mr. Trump was argued that he deserved the prize, too, for his work in Syria and North Korea.\n\nThe president spoke about the Nobel Prize after a Pakistani reporter suggested Mr. Trump would win one if he mediated the Kashmir dispute.\n\n\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently stripped the Muslim-majority Kashmir region of its autonomous status, raising tensions between Pakistan and India.\n\nKashmir residents have complained of security forces patrolling the streets, making them fearful to leave their homes, and say communication systems have been shut down or limited.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a complex issue and it\u2019s been going on for a long time. But if they are both willing then I\u2019m ready to do it,\u201d said Mr. Trump, who rallied with Mr. Modi in Houston on Sunday. \u201cI have a very good relationship with Prime Minister. Modi. I have a very good relationship with Prime Minister Khan. And if at any time they say, \u2018You know, we have some points we think you can maybe iron out,\u2019 I think I\u2019d be an extremely good arbitrator.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump has offered to mediate the Kashmir dispute before, only to be rebuffed by India, which says it views the matter as a bilateral one between India and Pakistan.\n\nMr. Khan said he would like Mr. Trump to bring the Kashmir situation before the U.N. Security Council.\n\n\u201cIt needs to be said there are 8 million people under siege by 900,000 troops. That\u2019s a humanitarian issue,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you were to meet him [Modi] now I would have asked him to at least lift the siege.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
