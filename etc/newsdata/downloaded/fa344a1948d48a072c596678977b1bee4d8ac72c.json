The study reveals that rich millennials aren\u2019t that different from other generations, although there is an ongoing debate over whether the generation as a whole is different.\n\n\u201cMillennials understand from the past that most millionaires came from real estate, and they are following that trend,\u201d said Ralph DiBugnara, president of New Jersey-based Home Qualified, which creates videos that teach millennials how to become homebuyers. DiBugnara, also a senior vice president at Cardinal Financial, added that millennials have tailored their investment strategies to avoid the mistakes they saw growing up in the financial crisis.\n\nSome 92% of millennial millionaires own property. In fact, the average millennial millionaire has a $1.4 million real estate portfolio, 34% greater than an average millionaire (across all generations including Baby Boomers and Generation Z) with a real estate portfolio of $919,000.\n\nA $4 million home is shown in Los Altos, Calif.

That is just not what we\u2019re seeing in the data.\u201d\n\nThe Coldwell Banker study of 250 millennial millionaires revealed that they prefer to buy, although they move often as expected. And upon relocation they plan to retain the property they own and rent it.\n\nThe similarities with their wealthy forerunners do not end there. California is a millionaire\u2019s favorite state to reside in, and millennial millionaires are no different. More than 40% live in the state. The next most common state for rich millennials, New York, hosts 14% of millennial millionaires.\n\nThe group does differ from its predecessors in some ways, though. Only 20% of millennial millionaires obtained a Bachelor\u2019s degree, compared to 42% of all millionaires on average. Only 15% are business owners compared to 22% on average, and only 67% are married, compared to 76% on average.\n\nThe study also found that millennial millionaires \u201cprefer markets that are more affordable\u201d or \u201ca nontraditional luxury neighborhood,\u201d unlike older millionaires. They are city-dwellers, valuing walkability and community. \u201cThe white picket fence is not what we\u2019re seeing millennial millionaires want,\u201d said Nathan Zeder, broker-associate at the Jills Zeder Group, a Miami-based brokerage firm.\n\nThe \u2018great wealth transfer\u2019\n\nAs wealthy millennials buy up properties in major cities, it could change the landscape of urban development, stimulating business in the surrounding areas.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good opportunity in urban areas, not only for the millennial millionaires but for the people around them. It will create an even bigger impact in areas that were not once considered premier locations,\u201d said Hillary Hertzberg, sales-associate at the Jills Zeder Group.\n\nThe shift could accelerate over the coming decades, as millennial millionaires are poised for the \u201cgreat wealth transfer,\u201d or a large, sudden inheritance of $68 trillion total in wealth as Baby Boomers age out of the economy. By 2030, millennial wealth will multiply by five, with unknown implications for their real estate investments, according to the study.\n\n\u201cThe big question is, \u2018What will this generation do with their wealth when the Great Wealth Transfer takes place?\u2019\u201d said Craig Hogan, Coldwell Banker vice president of luxury, in a statement.\n\nSarah Paynter is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
