And her work is not done.\n\nAD\n\nBiles has a chance at four more medals before the competition ends. She\u2019ll vie for the individual honors on vault and uneven bars Saturday and return Sunday to contest balance beam and floor exercise. Having posted the top marks on three of those four events Thursday, Biles is all but certain to eclipse Vitaly Scherbo\u2019s record of 23 world medals.\n\nAD\n\nTaking silver was Tang Xijing of China. Russia\u2019s Angelina Melnikova took bronze.\n\nIn what was likely Biles\u2019 final world championship, 16-year-old Sunisa Lee, the youngest member of the U.S. delegation, fell shy of her potential and finished eighth, hurt by an uncharacteristic fall on uneven bars, which is her strength.\n\nAD\n\nAs customary, Biles gave judges virtually nothing to quibble about in performing skills few of her rivals even attempt. She scored top marks on vault, beam and floor.\n\nCompeting Thursday in a white sequined leotard, Biles looked like a weightless angel. And her ability to project weightlessness while doing impossibly difficult gymnastics, as if she truly can fly, is part of her brilliance.\n\nIt was fitting and poetic that she closed the competition with a floor exercise chocked with skills that she alone can execute to perfection \u2014 most notably, the triple-twisting, double-somersault that now bears her name.\n\nAD\n\nShe had the arena in her hands as she stepped onto the mat.\n\nAD\n\nPerhaps it was a sign of her over-amped exuberance that she stepped out of bounds on the triple-double and again at the conclusion of another tumbling pass. But Biles\u2019s degree of difficulty is so high that minor deductions for such infractions don\u2019t come close to bringing her scores down to mortal realm.\n\nBiles opened on vault, a strength, and showed why she\u2019s the reigning world and Olympic champion on the apparatus with the amplitude of her Cheng \u2014 an exceedingly difficult skill few women perform. Her score of 15.233 proved highest.\n\nShe acquitted herself well on uneven bars, her least favorite event.\n\nLee\u2019s bars routine, however, went awry almost at once, with a costly fall. She collected herself and finished the routine but scored 13.330, well below her potential.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn beam, Biles opted not to conclude with the double-double dismount that now bears her name, after she became the first to successfully execute the skill during qualifying earlier in the competition. Even without it, her beam routine was plenty difficult and executed with only a small wobble to send her into the final rotation \u2014 floor exercise \u2014 with a 1.300-point lead over China\u2019s Tang.\n\nAs the final major international competition before the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, the 2019 world championships is a bellwether for the upcoming Summer Games. Biles is on track to become the first woman in 52 years to win back-to-back Olympic all-around gold medals, since Vera Caslavska of former Czechoslovakia did so at the 1964 and \u201968 Olympics.\n\nBut any parallel to that half-century-old achievement is strained, at best. Today\u2019s gymnastics skills are far more demanding, complex and dangerous.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCredit Biles for pushing those boundaries \u2014 but not because she\u2019s being pushed by a rival or young upstart. She is not. Biles is competing against her own potential, which is seemingly limitless.\n\nIt\u2019s extremely rare for female gymnasts to maintain championship form over two Olympic cycles. And it\u2019s almost unheard of for those who qualify for back-t0-back Olympics to raise their technical level as Biles has since the 2016 Rio Games, where she won four golds, including the prestigious all-around, and a bronze.\n\n\u201cThe few athletes that have tried to come back, very often they\u2019re repeating the same skills they did four years earlier, which usually is not enough because the sport is continually evolving,\u201d said Tom Forster, U.S. women\u2019s team coordinator. \u201cSimone is really, really unique in that sense. I don\u2019t think anyone ever has shown up at their potentially second Olympics stronger than their first, if they were the champion. This is a totally different level of competition than the world has ever seen before.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat makes Biles exceptional is a combination of factors. At just 4-foot-8, she has remarkable power. She also has impeccable form, which means there\u2019s no extraneous motion in her gymnastics. Mentally, she\u2019s strong as granite. And despite her mountain of medals, she trains and competes with a hunger that\u2019s not sated by past achievements. She is all about pushing herself and pushing her sport.\n\nSaid Liang Chow, former coach of four-time Olympic medalists Shawn Johnson and current coach of China\u2019s women\u2019s team: \u201cShe is absolutely the best I have ever seen.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Biles\u2019s second gold of the competition was her 22nd overall world championship medal.", "authors": ["Liz Clarke", "Sports Reporter Focusing On Tennis"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/bMiBvk8O5AJP8OH5NtuVDUbHHwc=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EC5ZMMHLPQI6THDNINVA35HTDU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
