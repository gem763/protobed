Sen. Joe Manchin, a moderate Democrat representing West Virginia, spoke for many lawmakers when he said that O'Rourke is entitled to his opinion, but he can take a hike.\n\n\"Beto's one human being,\" Manchin said. \"He gave his own opinion, OK? I think it was very harmful to make it look like all the Democrats. I can tell you one thing: Beto ORourke's not taking my guns away from me. You tell Beto that, OK?\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer wasn't eager about O'Rourke's plan either, telling the press that he can't name even one Democrat who supports it.\n\nThat's when O'Rourke challenged Schumer to name one thing he's ever done for the gun control movement.\n\nMinority Leader Chuck Schumer: \"I don\u2019t know of any other Democrat who agrees with @BetoORourke.\"#NEW O'Rourke fires back tonight: \"Ask @SenSchumer what he\u2019s been able to get done. We still don\u2019t have background checks. Didn\u2019t have them when he was in the majority either.\" pic.twitter.com/2cGPtB8o5x \u2014 Jeffrey Cook (@JeffreyCook) September 20, 2019\n\n\"We still don\u2019t have background checks,\" O'Rourke said, questioning Schumer's leadership. \"Didn\u2019t have them when he was in the majority, either. So the game that he\u2019s played, the politics that he\u2019s pursued have given us absolutely nothing and have produced a situation where we lose nearly 40,000 of our fellow Americans every year.\u201d\n\nThe former Texas lawmaker insisted that, while he may not have Washington support, he has voter support for his mandatory gun buyback proposal. He's so confident that he's now suggesting he'd expand his plan to include all semiautomatic firearms.", "description": ".09/20/2019 18:36:58PM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Matt Vespa", "Katie Pavlich"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/248/baacaca6-4152-48bb-81e1-75c7736d8b69.png", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
