For example, Subby, a notorious IoT malware coder and botnet operator, was known to use KV infrastructure.\n\nIn addition, some of these botnets also reached huge sizes, accounting for tens of thousands of infected devices; eventually drawing the attention of cyber-security firms, notably Trend Micro and Qihoo 360's Netlab, which spent time and resources in digging into their operations.\n\nKV hosted DDoS booter services\n\nFurthermore, KV also served as a hosting provider for some botnets that were part of DDoS-for-hire (DDoS booter) services, according to Troy Mursch, co-founder of Bad Packets.\n\n\"We've been monitoring malicious activity originating from their network for a year now,\" Mursch told ZDNet in an interview today.\n\n\"The vast majority of malware samples hosted by them were used for DDoS attacks. This goes hand-in-hand with them hosting the botnet command-and-control (C2) servers as well. It was a one-stop shop for DDoS/booter services,\" Mursch added.\n\nAll in all, Mursch said that \"in 2019, Bad Packets detected 440,261 exploit attempts originating from and/or referencing malware payloads hosted by KV Solutions.\"\n\nVictims of DDoS attacks that originated from KV-hosted botnets include Ubisoft, Wish.com, and about every major cloud and web hosting provider you can name, such as AWS, Microsoft Azure, OVH, AT&T, Comcast, Cox, Charter, and China Unicom; just to name a few.\n\nKV never took action against bad customers\n\nBut this high concentration of DDoS firepower on the infrastructure of one single company couldn't have gone unnoticed forever.\n\nSeveral security researchers and sources in the web hosting community have told ZDNet that the company \"had it coming.\"\n\nKV administrators sarcastically ignored abuse reports from everyone and allowed their customers to run rampant.\n\nComplaints to Dutch authorities started coming in last year, and many fellow web hosting providers and security researchers have been gagged to silence this whole year, as Dutch cyber police slowly gathered the evidence they needed to take down the company.\n\nTwo arrested\n\nDutch police finally stepped in and raided the company's offices yesterday, Tuesday, October 1, at about the time the company posted a message on its Facebook page, announcing \"a malfunction,\" a coded message to customers to wipe their servers.\n\nDutch authorities made the raid public today, in a press release, which also mentioned the arrests of two suspects, a 24-year-old from Veendam, and a 28-year-old from Middelburg.\n\nThe two -- Marco B., 24, from Veendam, and Angelo K., 28, from Middelburg -- are believed to be the founders of a network of five interconnected companies. Dutch privacy laws do not permit revealing a suspect's full name, so we honored this requirement for our reporting.\n\nMarco B. and Angelo K. are listed as the owners of two web hosting firms, namely KV Solutions BV and Lifehosting BV, but also three IT companies, Bos IT Holding BV, Kreikamp IT Holding BV, and KBIT Holding BV, all having controlling rights in each other, according to public information from the Dutch Chamber of Commerce.\n\nAll the websites and domains of the five companies listed above are now down. Phone calls to contact numbers listed on cached versions of these sites were not answered.\n\nWhile the Dutch police statement published today only mentions \"the hosting of IoT botnets,\" KV's infrastructure hosted a lot of other malware as well. KV's public IP block was 185.244.25.0/24. Any malware operation that had servers in this address space saw some unfortunate downtime today.\n\nAs it happened in other raids of bulletproof hosting providers, the data from the seized servers will most likely lead to other arrests, such as botnet operators and malware authors.", "description": "Police seize servers from bulletproof hosting provider that harbored tens of DDoS botnets.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/02/9be7f25b-d4a8-4277-86cc-96ecc6af40e2/thumbnail/770x578/2174810f939c100322c0bc9ff147f256/ddos-internet-globe-map.jpg"}
