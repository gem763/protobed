Although shots have been fired in warning at other protests, and police have caused serious injury with rubber bullets and beanbags, this is the first time someone has been hit with a live round.\n\nCrowds gathered at other \u201cday of grief\u201d protests, where police were using water cannon and teargas, fell silent when they heard that a man had been hit.\n\nPlay Video Hong Kong protesters use chairs as barricade during riots \u2013 video\n\nImages shared by local media appeared to show the man lying on the ground begging for help as he bled from his injury. \u201cSend me to hospital, my chest is hurting. I need to go to hospital,\u201d he said.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s Hospital Authority said 15 people had been injured, including one \u2013 understood to be the protester hit by a live round \u2013 in a critical condition in Princess Margaret hospital.\n\nTens of thousands defied a police ban to march through central Hong Kong, and thousands gathered in other parts of the city. Organisers and protesters said the 70th anniversary of communist rule should be a day of mourning not celebration.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Riot police clash with protesters in the Sha Tin district of Hong Kong.

We have come out today, because if we don\u2019t, we may not have another chance.\u201d\n\nPolice had warned ahead of National Day that they feared violent protests. Organisers had warned that citizens needed a legitimate outlet for their anger after their request for a legal protest was denied.\n\nThe day began with an early moment of police aggression, when officers used pepper spray on a small group of protesters outside the government\u2019s official flag-raising ceremony, which was closed to the public.\n\nFor the first few hours the main march through central Hong Kong was largely peaceful with protesters dressed largely in black singing \u201cglory to Hong Kong\u201d and scattering paper money used for funeral offerings.\n\nMany families and young children were among the crowds. \u201cYou see we don\u2019t have any protective gear,\u201d said Terrence, a logistics worker walking with his eight-year-old daughter. \u201cWe want freedom, and don\u2019t want to belong to China.\u201d\n\nStill, many of those marching wore face masks or carried umbrellas, to stop them being filmed or identified by authorities who have already arrested hundreds.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Police fire teargas canisters during a demonstration.
