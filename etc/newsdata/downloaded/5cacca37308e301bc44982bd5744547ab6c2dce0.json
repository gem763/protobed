Only slightly less than half over the next year. The collapse in medium and long term interest rates is ominous. \u2014 Lawrence H. Summers (@LHSummers) August 5, 2019\n\nIn a statement released by Treasury on Monday, Mnuchin castigated China as a \"currency manipulator\" after it allowed the yuan to depreciate below the '7 mark' for the first time in more than a decade.\n\nThe escalation has already sent shockwaves through global exchanges, as Asia woke up to the news on Tuesday morning. Australia, the first major stock market in the region to open, plunged nearly 3% in the first 15 minutes of trading before easing back to close 2.44% lower. Exchanges across Asia fared a little better. Hong Kong's Hang Seng immediately fell by more than 600 points to 25,472, before it too clawed back some of its losses to close 1.05% down.\n\nA similar pattern unfolded on many of the region's largest exchanges, all free-falling at the market opening but regaining some of the losses throughout the day. The Shanghai Composite fell around 1.56%, Korea's KOSPI lost 1.51%, and Japan's Nikkei 225 closed down 0.65%.\n\nThe most troublingly part of these developments, according to Australia-based global markets analyst Greg McKenna, is that there doesn't seem to be any desire by either President Trump or China's President Jinping Xi to walk away from the trade war. \"This is intractable. There's been a complete loss of goodwill and good faith. It's going to have a huge impact because I can't see a circuit breaker ahead,\" McKenna told Business Insider.\n\n\"China is really pushing back. President Trump has been pushing and pushing and pushing and trying to make Xi look weak and now neither of them can back down.\"\n\nWhile the decision by the US Federal Reserve to cut interest rates has helped push markets higher, this new trade environment could take the wind out of any further cuts. \"The Fed could say in a week or so, 'we're going to cut rates'. That gives the market a lift, but then people will just sell the gain again because everything is just getting downgraded,\" McKenna said. All eyes will now return to Europe and Wall Street to see how markets react after plummeting on Monday.", "description": "Global markets have followed Wall Street into freefall following a recent escalation in the US-China trade war.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9197/5c6babaee98d4e0cb945b5670e6c7149.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-06"}
