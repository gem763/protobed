Sondland remains in his post and has turned over the documents that lawmakers want to the State Department instead, setting up a fight between the legislative and executive branches over access to the information.\n\nHolding Ukraine hostage: How the president and his allies, chasing 2020 ammunition, fanned a political storm\n\nSondland, 61, appears never to have held a position in government before being named the ambassador to the E.U. in June 2018. He built his fortune acquiring and managing luxury hotels in the Pacific Northwest and gave $1 million to Trump\u2019s inaugural fund via shell companies that obscured his involvement.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe text messages released last week show what appear to be Sondland\u2019s effort to minimize political fallout from the administration\u2019s dealings with the Ukrainians.\n\nOn Sept. 9, William B. \u201cBill\u201d Taylor, the senior U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, texted Sondland: \u201cI think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d\n\nHours later, Sondland, who had been aggressively pursuing a public agreement for Ukraine to launch the investigations, replied, \u201cBill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump\u2019s intentions. The President has been crystal clear: no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Text messages show that Sondland, the ambassador to the E.U., was shaping U.S. foreign policy in Ukraine as Trump pressed for investigations of his political opponents.", "authors": ["Shane Harris", "Intelligence", "National Security Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/1tvNz9X8p1eX-4A8uc8C4hEchVA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JHQB5GHJJII6TEYGI7FQGJH5IQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
