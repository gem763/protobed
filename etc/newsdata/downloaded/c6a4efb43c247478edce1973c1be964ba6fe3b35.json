Chase thrills, try new things, push your boundaries, and learn what brings you joy.\n\nBut don\u2019t forget about the second kind of happiness, which might more accurately be called contentment. That kind of happiness isn\u2019t constructed from a string of once-in-a-lifetime moments; instead, it\u2019s carefully cultivated through your day-to-day activities and habits.\n\nAs Dr. Travis Bradberry, co-author of Emotional Intelligence 2.0 and president of TalentSmart, explains in his essay \u201cEleven Habits of Supremely Happy People\u201d:\n\nThe mistaken notion that major life events dictate your happiness and sadness is so prevalent that psychologists have a name for it: impact bias. The reality is, event-based happiness is fleeting. Happiness is synthetic \u2014 you either create it, or you don\u2019t. Happiness that lasts is earned through your habits. Supremely happy people have honed habits that maintain their happiness day in, day out.\n\nWhat are these eleven habits? Many of them are the same old tips and tricks you see on nearly every list of how to live a good life: get enough sleep, get regular exercise, savour your meals instead of rushing through them, and so on.\n\nHowever, Bradberry takes this list a little further, suggesting that happy people live not only for health, but also for depth:\n\nThey have deep conversations. Happy people know that happiness and substance go hand-in-hand. They avoid gossip, small talk, and judging others. Instead they focus on meaningful interactions. They engage with other people on a deeper level, because they know that doing so feels good, builds an emotional connection, and is an interesting way to learn.\n\nIf you want more meaningful interactions in your life, you might need to start surrounding yourself with the right people (habit #4) and spending time with them in person instead of online (habit #10). You can even get into the habit of giving those people gifts (habit #3), but only if you take the time to find something they\u2019ll appreciate. A poorly chosen gift, after all, makes everyone unhappy.\n\nIt seems kind of trite to note that happiness derives from the habits we build, the choices we make, and the way we respond to external circumstances and challenges, but \u201ctry to live in a way that will promote happiness\u201d is something we often forget in our rush to do all of the other stuff on our to-do list.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for ways to bring a little more contentment into your life, ask yourself whether you can adopt any of Dr. Bradberry\u2019s eleven habits. He notes that you don\u2019t have to incorporate all eleven to live a happy life \u2014 so pick the ones that work for you, and try to do them as often as possible.", "description": "There are two kinds of happiness \u2014 the kind that lasts for an instant and the kind that can permeate an entire lifetime....", "authors": ["Chris Jager", "Sarah Basford"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/uz2lfefzwphhgjcwj4ej.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
