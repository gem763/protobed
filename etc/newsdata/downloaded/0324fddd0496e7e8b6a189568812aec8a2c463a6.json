He had previously said that police searches in Operation Midland, sparked by the lies of serial liar and fantasist \u2018Nick\u2019, real name Carl Beech, broke the law. Despite the concerns of Sir Richard and another judge, the IOPC \u2013 whose \u2018lead investigator\u2019 was a rookie in her 20s who had only a few years\u2019 experience \u2013 dismissed the misconduct allegations.\n\nCarl Beech was convicted of 12 counts of perverting the course of justice and one of fraud. He was jailed for 18 years for perverting the course of justice and fraud in July\n\nThe decision to launch a parliamentary inquiry into the running of the watchdog and the wider police complaints system is a victory for the Daily Mail, which has led the way in exposing the shambolic IOPC inquiry into Operation Midland since Beech was jailed for 18 years in July.\n\nThe probe was announced yesterday \u2013 two days after the police watchdog was accused of cronyism when its boss gave a \u00a3140,000-a-year job to a former colleague.\n\nTory MP Tim Loughton, who sits on the committee, is pressing for a separate parliamentary inquiry into the scandal of Operation Midland\n\nMichael Lockwood, the \u00a3180,000-a-year director general of the IOPC, was on a panel which approved the appointment of Tom Whiting, his former No 2 at a local council. Mr Lockwood denies any wrongdoing. An IOPC spokesman said: \u2018Mr Lockwood declared he knew the candidate, in accordance with policy... The [deputy] position was proposed in the year before the appointment of Mr Lockwood.\u2019\n\nThe watchdog chief is expected to face tough questioning by MPs over the running of the quango. Committee chairman Yvette Cooper said: \u2018When the Government established the IOPC in January 2018, it was with the promise of new powers, greater independence and faster decision-making. Nearly two years on, we continue to hear concerns that the system is not working as it should. In this inquiry we expect to look at the IOPC\u2019s powers and effectiveness but, given that most complaints are dealt with by local forces under the scrutiny of Police and Crime Commissioners, we shall also look at whether wider reforms are needed.\u2019\n\nTory MP Tim Loughton, who sits on the committee, is pressing for a separate parliamentary inquiry into the scandal of Operation Midland.\n\nAmong those who could be called, should the probe go ahead, is ex-Met Deputy Assistant Commissioner Steve Rodhouse, who led the shambolic inquiry.\n\nMr Rodhouse is now head of operations at Britain\u2019s version of the FBI, the National Crime Agency, but senior Home Office and police sources have described his position as \u2018untenable\u2019 and his future remains in serious doubt.\n\nFormer Tory MP Harvey Proctor, falsely accused of being a serial child killer by Beech and who has branded the IOPC inquiry into Operation Midland a \u2018whitewash\u2019, welcomed the Commons inquiry. He said: \u2018The IOPC is deserving of a thorough investigation. I am not alone in believing it is an organisation not fit for purpose.\u2019\n\nDaniel Janner, whose Labour peer father Greville Janner was falsely accused of abuse by Beech, added: \u2018Operation Midland has shown the IOPC as being a toothless watchdog. It is risking losing the public\u2019s trust and credibility.\u2019", "description": "MPs have launched an inquiry into the running of the police watchdog following its 'whitewash' inquiry which cleared five detectives of misconduct in Scotland Yard's bungled VIP child sex abuse case.", "authors": ["Stephen Wright Associate News Editor For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/23/20304020-0-image-a-117_1572305266612.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
