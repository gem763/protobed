The moon's south pole is of particular interest because of ice deposits in craters there.\n\nUnfortunately, India's Chandrayaan-2 lunar mission lost communication while attempting to soft land a rover on the moon's south pole. But NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter has been orbiting the moon since 2009 and mapping the south pole region.\n\nScientists want to understand how the ice deposits initially formed in the craters. Because the moon has no atmosphere, it's constantly impacted by objects like meteorites and micrometeorites. This helps researchers to understand lunar history as well as identify resources for future missions.\n\nThe Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter captured this view of the Lunar South Pole.\n\nA new study identifying the ages of the ice deposits published Thursday in the journal Icarus . The researchers used Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter data to determine that many of the deposits are billions of years old, bur some of them are more recent.\n\n\"The ages of these deposits can potentially tell us something about the origin of the ice, which helps us understand the sources and distribution of water in the inner solar system,\" said Ariel Deutsch, a study author and a graduate student at Brown University's Department of Earth, Environmental and Planetary sciences. \"For exploration purposes, we need to understand the lateral and vertical distributions of these deposits to figure out how best to access them. These distributions evolve with time, so having an idea of the age is important.\"\n\nRead More", "description": "The return of humans to the moon, as well as ongoing robotic missions, may require using resources already on the lunar surface.
