He claims that he was \u201chijacked\u201d and brought into custody as he was departing Israel, which he says is \u201ca standard US scheme.\u201d\n\nSince then, he has been held in several Israeli prisons, with no access to healthcare or regular visits from his lawyers. He has spent time in solitary confinement, and has sometimes been deprived of \u201cfood and water,\u201d he says.\n\nIsraeli interrogators told Burkov that the US issued an Interpol warrant for him and are seeking extradition for his alleged involvement in cyber attacks and computer network fraud. Burkov has nothing to do with these crimes, he told RT Russian.\n\nI\u2019m an average man. I was dealing with cyber security and programming, I worked with databases. I did have acquaintances among people complicit in hacking, but I myself didn\u2019t commit those crimes \u2013 the Americans simply decided to blame all this on me.\n\nRussian diplomats who are trying to help him say his situation is growing graver. Israel is yet to form a coalition government, which jeopardizes Burkov\u2019s fate.\n\nMeanwhile, Burkov\u2019s family have suggested that the Russian Foreign Ministry negotiate a prisoner swap between the two countries.\n\nAlso on rt.com Washington fuming after Hungary refuses to extradite 2 Russians sought by US, sends them to Moscow\n\nThey have said that Burkov could be swapped for Naama Issachar, a 25-year-old Israeli-American who was detained at Moscow Sheremetyevo Airport after she was found with nine grams of cannabis.\n\nIsrael seems reluctant to employ such an option, however, according to a friend of Burkov\u2019s who lives in Israel.\n\nIsraeli government covers up the fact that there\u2019s such an opportunity and that Russia is ready to do it.
