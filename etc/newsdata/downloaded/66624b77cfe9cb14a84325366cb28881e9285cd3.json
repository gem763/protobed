The longer I\u2019ve been away, the more I value being recognised at home. When I was younger, I was trying to throw myself into the world, but this makes me feel quite full in the heart.\u201d\n\nAt an awards gala hosted at Cafe Sydney on Wednesday, Brown was one of four finalists for the award. The others were former model and fashion editor Maggie Tabberer, fashion consultant Malcolm Carfrae and the late Bernie Leser, who founded Australian Vogue. Brown dedicated her award via a taped acceptance speech to Tabberer.\n\n\u201cAnyone who can go from a farm in Camden to the helm of the most widely read fashion magazine in America is a winner as far as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d said IMG Australia vice-president and managing director Danielle Ragenard on Brown\u2019s win.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s even better is that Laura has done all this with irreverence and a sense of fun. She does not feel the need to conform or to perform within the big fashion machine. I have a lot of respect for that.\u201d\n\nOther winners on the day included stylist Jillian Davison, who took out the award for Outstanding Creative; Lee Mathews, for best Australian womenswear, Double Rainbouu for menswear. Matteau won the award for best Australian emerging talent, presented by Etihad Airways, which awards the winners with business class travel within its network.\n\nFounded in 2015 by sisters Ilona Hamer and Peta Heinsen, Matteau is a swimwear-turned-resortwear label that has attracted fast fans in fashion circles, including luxury online retailer Net-a-Porter, where it is stocked. Known for its chic, flattering swimwear, Matteau staged its first Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Australia show this May.\n\nIlona Hamer and Peta Heinsen, founders of Matteau, which won the award for best Australian emerging talent. Alexandra Nataf\n\n\u201cTo have people who we admire, who are themselves very successful in the industry, judge us worthy of this award is pretty crazy,\u201d says Hamer, a stylist who lives in New York. She is the creative brains of the business, while Heinsen runs the administrative side from Sydney.\n\n\u201cIt never gets old that people are wearing our clothes,\u201d says Heinsen of the brand's success. \u201cThere are a lot of swimwear labels out there; the fact that people choose ours is quite cool. Awards are nice but the fact that people are buying is the best tick of approval.\u201d\n\nThe writer was a judge of the Australian Fashion Laureate.", "description": "The Australian-born editor-in-chief of InStyle in the United States has highest honour in Australian fashion.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2207%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_236/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/ead5b621014cbce15a6635df907d2a32041f1979", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
