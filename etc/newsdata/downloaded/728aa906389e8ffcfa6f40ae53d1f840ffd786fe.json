Yet its streamlined rakish design and shorter overhang means it is eight centimetres shorter and more than seven centimetres lower than the existing X1, even though has the same wheelbase.\n\nDesigned to appeal to young and active couples and families, it is unashamedly gunning for \u2019conquest\u2019 sales from the drivers of rivals including Britain\u2019s Range Rover Evoque, Audi\u2019s Q2 and Q3 and Mercedes-Benz small GLC crossover.\n\nBMW expects to sell around 6,000 in the UK this year with first deliveries starting in March. It sold more than 8,500 X3s and 14,600 X1s here last year.\n\nBMW is also capitalising on the current interior design trend towards gold \u2013 whether table legs and furniture or ornaments. But while Galvanised Gold really does look funky under a sunny Portuguese sky, I\u2019m not sure how it will fare on a drizzly day in Barnsley. Or Basingstoke for that matter. Perhaps the Misano Blue metallic might be a better bet for the British climate.\n\nThe five-door five-seater hatchback with its smart and functional interior is available in all-wheel drive or front-wheel drive and has four trim levels: entry level SE, Sport, M Sport and M Sport X.\n\nDuring its international launch on motorways, mountain roads and city traffic in and around Lisbon, I drove a top of the range all-wheel drive X2 xDrive20d diesel costing from \u00a334,985, which is the first to market, in the range-topping sporty M Sport X trim which includes the 10mm lower M Sport suspension fitted as standard.\n\nDecision time: The BMX X2 is also packed to the gunnels with lots of tempting extras\n\nThe marketing geniuses in Munich have put so many \u2018X\u2019s\u2019 into the model names that you feel like you\u2019re joining Marvel\u2019s X-Men for a game of noughts and crosses. Indeed, the complex mixture of numbers and upper and lower case letters, if used as computer passwords, confound most online hackers.\n\nAnd buyers beware. It was also packed to the gunnels with lots of tempting extras including a very useful head-up display that would push up the actual price by thousands more pounds \u2013 which is one of the ways BMW boosts the profitability on every car. Metallic paint adds \u00a3550, the M-Sport X package with 20inch wheels is \u00a31,300, a \u2018tech pack\u2019 adds \u00a31,250 and a \u2018vision pack\u2019 \u00a3710 and so on.\n\nOnce snuggled into its firm and cosseting sports seats and grabbing the sturdily thick multi-function steering wheel, I fired-up the start button, slid the sleek automatic gear lever into 'D' for drive, and was away.\n\nRoomy: The 40:20:40 rear seat configuration means you can slide in skis or snow-boards\n\nIt\u2019s a comfortable and competent drive around town and on the highway in the standard 8-speed automatic mode.\n\nBut the BMW X2 really comes into its own when you switch the set-up and settings to \u2018sport\u2019 mode and then play around with the manual paddles on the steering wheel. It\u2019s a very exhilarating drive on the tight mountain roads as you drive around bends with the wheels firmly planted on the tarmac. The powerful 2.0 litre 190 horse-power diesel engine delivers plenty of oomph and pulling power and the clever intelligent all-wheel drive system also help keep you firmly rooted to the road.\n\nBuilt in Regensburg, it has plenty of safety kit to keep you on track, including a sensor which spotted a wobbly cyclist up ahead and threw up a red warning symbol and audible alert.\n\nPeace of mind: Built in Regensburg, it has plenty of safety kit to keep you on track\n\nFor a car of this size and market, acceleration from rest to 62mph is a sprightly 7.7 seconds up to a more than adequate top speed \u2013 where allowed such as German autobahns \u2013 of 137mph.\n\nBMW\u2019s \u2018efficient dynamics\u2019 uses braking regeneration to keep the fuel usage down to a claimed average of 60.1 miles to the gallon (66.5mpg cruising and 52.3mpg around town) with CO2 emissions of 124g/km.\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of space and legroom in the back for family and friends, fitting two rear passengers comfortably and five at a squeeze. You can push the rear seat-backs forward to free-up a bit more space. But pushed fully flat, the rear seats will liberate a total of 1,355 litres of cargo-carrying space for the driver and passenger in front. The 40:20:40 rear seat configuration means you can drop the cent bit to slide in skis or snow-boards.\n\nChic: Other little styling touches designed to delight include the twin exhaust pipes\n\nBMW X2 - Will it fit in my garage? Price: from \u00a334,985 Range price: from \u00a329,995 First UK deliveries: March Length: 4,360mm Width: 1,824mm Width inc mirrors: 2,098mm Height: 1,526mm Engine: 2.0 litre 4 cylinder diesel Power: 190 horse-power (HP)/ 188bhp Gears: 8\u2013speed automatic with manual override Top speed: 137mph 0-62mph: 7.7 seconds Fuel consumption: Average: 60.1mpg Cruising: 66.5mpg City: 52.3mpg CO2 emissions: 124g/km\n\nThe interior trim is a specially created soft Alcantara Anthracite mixed with a Micro Hexagon fabric and highlighted with yellow contrast stitching.

A 2.0litre petrol version (X2 sDrive20i) starts from \u00a331,445.\n\nVarious elements come as standard on the more expensive models from M Sport level up including sports and heated seats, intelligent cruise control with braking, parking sensors, and \u2019BMW ConnectedDrive\u2019 which includes sat-nav, online services, real time traffic information accessible via the dashboard screen\n\nStanding out from the crowd: On the road prices for the X2 range start at a tantalising \u00a329,995\n\nAmong the various tempting \u2018extras\u2019 which will bump up the price are electric seat adjustment and heated seats, sun protection glass, panoramic glass-roof, reversing assist cameras, roof rails, 20-inch wheels, enhanced sat-nav, driving assistance and parking technology and enhanced Bluetooth with wireless charging.\n\nBMW has sold 5.5million of its \u2019X\u2019 model SUVs since 1999 \u2013 and believes this one too will boost sales further by tapping into a younger audience.", "description": "The average age of a BMW driver is 52, though that drops to mid 40s for the X6 SUV favoured by professional footballers and young entrepreneurs.
