At a minimum, it confronts aspiring Democratic presidential candidates with a challenge as they try to make themselves outsized figures who can capture public imagination and set the agenda.\n\nIn each case, the barrage of developments since September will offer new windows into how candidates can talk about Trump while avoiding talking about nothing but Trump \u2014 a harder course to navigate than meets the eye. Among the subjects to watch:\n\nImpeachment\n\nThere presumably will be no voice on the stage ready to state what a significant portion of Democratic strategists believe: that it would be better to skip House impeachment of Trump altogether and just beat him in a general election, especially since there is so little chance he would be convicted by the Senate and some unknown chance that he would emerge politically stronger. This cautious approach is simply not where most Democratic voters are.\n\nAt the same time, there is a choice for candidates about how closely they wish to align themselves with the House effort, or how much advice they wish to give on important procedural questions. Those questions include how quickly House Democrats should move, whether an impeachment inquiry should be narrowly about Trump\u2019s efforts to draw Ukraine into investigating Joe Biden, or more broadly about alleged abuses of power on other subjects.\n\nMore broadly, do candidates look to embrace the passion of impeachment advocates in the House, or strike a more detached stance toward the House proceedings? This is the first debate since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was pulled out of her own previously detached stance to begin impeachment proceedings.\n\nTrump and Syria\n\nEven Republicans have denounced Trump\u2019s decision to pull U.S. troops out of Syria, effectively inviting a Turkish incursion and abandoning Kurdish forces who have been U.S. allies. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he was \u201cgravely concerned\u201d that the move would revive ISIS and Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham called it \u201ca disaster in the making.\u201d\n\nThis would suggest the topic is easy pickings for Democrats to lambaste Trump as both immoral and incompetent in his conduct of foreign policy. Still, it is worth being alert to the specific words and tone Democrats strike in this area.\n\nAlmost no important national security or foreign policy voice is supporting the precipitous manner in which Trump executed his policy shift. But his underlying philosophy \u2014 that it is time to pull back U.S. military commitments abroad and stop \u201cendless wars\u201d \u2014 is in fact one that has ample support in both parties.\n\nThis gives an opportunity \u2014 including for Biden, with the most extensive experience in foreign policy debates \u2014 to both denounce Trump and make a more affirmative statement about their own worldview.\n\nThe Biden family\n\nFor nearly a month now, it\u2019s been one of those Washington parlor games that won\u2019t really have a right answer until we hear more from voters \u2014 either in the form of multiple unambiguous polls or, this winter, once caucus and primary voting begins. There\u2019s a chance that Trump\u2019s attacks on the Biden family actually help the former vice president, allowing him to portray himself as the victim of a Trump smear and the person the president is most afraid of.\n\nThere\u2019s also a chance that Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine, an area in which he brought no previous expertise or evident value other than his last name, solidify the perception of the Democratic hopeful as representative of a self-dealing Washington culture who is too tired, too conventional, and too compromised to take the fight to Trump.\n\nLots of Democrats worry about the latter. But it is not yet clear the rewards are there for Biden\u2019s rivals to say this out loud on the debate stage.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/2a/a1/7f2c22c247b89ad53d379eb8055d/191015-debate-stage-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
