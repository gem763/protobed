That is an increase from 27.3 million in 2016.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHispanics are the youngest of the major racial and ethnic groups in the U.S. At 28 years, the median age of Hispanics is nearly a full decade younger than that of the U.S. overall (37 years).\n\nMillennials made up almost half (44 percent) of the Hispanic electorate in 2016. Hispanic millennials will likely continue to drive growth of the Hispanic electorate, given that the median age of U.S.-born Hispanics is only 19. In addition, in any given year, more than 800,000 young Hispanics turn 18.\n\nUnidos US, a non-partisan Latino civil rights and advocacy organization, projects that in five years Hispanics will account for about 20 percent of the U.S. workforce and over 30 percent by 2050.\n\nThe National Center for Education Statistics projects that by 2023, nearly one-third of all students will be Latino. In three states \u2013 California, New Mexico and Texas \u2013 Latinos already account for more than half of all students.\n\nHispanics are also an integral part of America\u2019s economy. If the U.S. Latino GDP were considered an economy of its own, it would be a G-7 country and would be the seventh-largest in the world in, just behind France and ahead of India.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAll of this explains why it is critical for political campaigns to reach out to Latinos and speak to them authentically about the issues they care about. This should be easy since they are the same issues all Americans care about \u2014 the economy, jobs, health care, education, climate change and immigration.\n\nThe Democratic candidates have their work cut out for them. While most Latinos do not support President Trump Donald John Trump Comey: Mueller 'didn't succeed in his mission because there was inadequate transparency' During deposition, official says he made several efforts to advocate for Marie Yovanovitch Bolton looms large as impeachment inquiry accelerates MORE, he likes to tout the record-low unemployment rate among Latinos.\n\nThe unemployment rate is great, but the economic situation for many Latinos is not. If you must hold down two or three jobs simply to make ends meet, that is not an economy that is working for you. If you are afraid of losing your health care, as many Latinos are since Trump took office vowing to get rid of ObamaCare, you do not have peace of mind. And if you are an immigrant living in a mixed-status household or have simply been at the receiving end of xenophobic, racist rhetoric normalized by Trump, you are not feeling secure in your own country.\n\nThis is what Democrats must focus on. They must offer a better path forward that gives Latinos a robust economic future and an optimistic outlook that celebrates their contributions.\n\nAmerica would collapse tomorrow if Latino workers and Latino talent suddenly disappeared. Our community is so intertwined with this magnificent country that when the Latino community does well, so does the nation. 2020 candidates must understand this reality.\n\nHispanics will be the majority minority voters in 2020, and they cannot be taken for granted. Candidates must engage Hispanic voters now, not just a month before the election. They must make a robust argument as to why their candidacy is worthy of their vote. A solely anti-Trump agenda will not be enough to win over most Latinos.\n\nCandidates must speak to Latino aspirations, hopes and dreams, not just their fears. They believe this country, their country, is better with them in it. The winning Democratic candidate will too.\n\nMaria Cardona is a principal at the Dewey Square Group, a Democratic strategist and a CNN/CNN Espa\u00f1ol political commentator.
