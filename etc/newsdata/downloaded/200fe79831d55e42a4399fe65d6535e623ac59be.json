We stand by the reporting in the book, 100 percent, and believe that it discredits this attempt by NBC to rewrite the facts,\u201d a spokesperson for Farrow told Fox News.\n\nOppenheim and NBC News Chairman Andy Lack have been accused of a \u201cmassive breach of journalistic integrity\u201d by Farrow\u2019s former NBC News producer Rich McHugh. Farrow has long claimed that NBC News stopped his reporting in an attempt to essentially cover for Weinstein, and his book has already caused NBC executives to release statements and hold sit-downs with concerned employees.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOppenheim famously told Farrow that his reporting wasn\u2019t fit to print, so he took it to The New Yorker where it won the Pulitzer Prize and helped launch the #MeToo movement.\n\nIn a copy of the book obtained early by Fox News, Farrow describes Oppenheim as a \u201cdoe-eyed stoner whose mellow seemed impossible to harsh\u201d and said they \u201claughed about his stories of getting high.\u201d Farrow also says he and Oppenheim \u201cplanned to spend a night in with some edibles\u201d before their eventual fallout over the Weinstein reporting.\n\nFarrow was on \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d to promote the book on Monday when he was informed about Oppenheim\u2019s memo to staffers.\n\n\u201cThis book is an extraordinary, meticulously fact-checked work of investigative journalism. It's two years of reporting; one of the senior fact-checkers at The New Yorker checked it; I\u2019ll let the reporting in the book stand on its own. We\u2019re very confident in it,\u201d Farrow said.", "description": "Ronan Farrow on Monday stood by his highly anticipated book, \u201cCatch and Kill,\u201d after troubled NBC News\u00a0President Noah Oppenheim said it was an \u201ceffort to defame\u201d the\u00a0Peacock Network \u2013 but the celebrity scion said his former boss simply has \u201cthe most to lose from the truth.\u201d", "authors": ["Brian Flood", "Brian Flood Covers The Media For Fox News.
