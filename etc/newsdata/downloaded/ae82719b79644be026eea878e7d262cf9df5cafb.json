Democrats warned Trump is \u201con a path of defiance, obstruction and cover-up\u201d and said defying their subpoena would be considered \u201cevidence of obstruction,\u201d potentially an impeachable offense.\n\nThe White House was expected to send a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi arguing that Congress could not mount its impeachment inquiry without first having a vote to authorize it. The letter was expected to say the administration wouldn\u2019t cooperate with the probe without that vote.\n\nTrump said the resolution would likely pass the House, but he predicted it would backfire on Democrats.\n\n\u201cI really believe that they\u2019re going to pay a tremendous price at the polls,\u201d he said.\n\nThree Democratic chairmen \u2014 Reps. Elijah Cummings, Adam Schiff and Eliot Engel \u2014 warned Trump in a letter accompanying their subpoena, stating, \u201cSpeaker Pelosi has confirmed that an impeachment inquiry is underway, and it is not for the White House to say otherwise.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s comments came shortly before Democrats sent an extensive request for documents to Vice President Mike Pence about his contacts with Ukraine. Lawmakers have made Trump\u2019s request that Ukraine investigate former Vice President Joe Biden the centerpiece of the probe. A whistleblower complaint said that Trump sought to use military assistance for Ukraine to push President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate the 2020 Democratic hopeful.\n\nThe West Wing was set to allow the similar request for documents from the president\u2019s staff to go unfulfilled Friday, likely forcing Democrats to make good on their threat to issue a subpoena for the records.\n\nPence spokeswoman Katie Waldman dismissed the new demand for documents, saying that given its wide scope, \u201cit does not appear to be a serious request.\u201d\n\nWhen Pelosi recently announced that the House was initiating the inquiry, she didn\u2019t seek the consent of the full chamber, as was done for impeachment investigations into former Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton.\n\nBut it is underway, and at a rapidly escalating pace.\n\nLate Thursday, House investigators released a cache of text messages that showed top U.S. diplomats encouraging Ukraine\u2019s newly elected president to conduct an investigation linked to Biden\u2019s family in return for granting a high-profile visit with Trump in Washington.\n\nThe release followed a 10-hour interview with one of the diplomats, Kurt Volker, who stepped down as special envoy to Ukraine after the impeachment inquiry had begun.\n\nTrump repeated on Friday that he was pressing Ukraine to investigate corruption, not trying to undermine Biden, who could be his 2020 presidential election opponent. He made a related request of China, specifying Biden and his son, on Thursday.\n\nAs Republicans search for a response to the investigation , the absence of a procedural vote to begin the probe has been a main attack line against Democrats.\n\nPelosi swatted the need for such a vote back as unnecessary, saying the House is well within its rules to pursue the inquiry without it.\n\n\u201cThe existing rules of the House provide House Committees with full authority to conduct investigations for all matters under their jurisdiction, including impeachment investigations,\u201d Pelosi wrote Thursday in a letter to House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy after he, too, pressed for a floor vote.\n\nPelosi has sought to avoid a vote on the impeachment probe for the same reason she resisted, for months, liberal calls to try to remove the president: It would force moderate House Democrats to make a politically risky vote.\n\nThe White House, meanwhile, is trying to force the question on Democrats, as it seeks to raise the political cost for their impeachment investigation and to animate the president\u2019s supporters ahead of the 2020 election.\n\nTrump allies have suggested that without a formal vote, the House is merely conducting standard oversight, entitling lawmakers to a lesser level of disclosure from the administration. The Justice Department raised similar arguments last month, though that was before Pelosi announced the impeachment investigation.\n\nTwo days after telling reporters, \u201cWell, I always cooperate,\u201d Trump struck a different note on cooperating with the House probe. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s up to the lawyers.\u201d\n\nDemocrats have warned that the Trump administration\u2019s obstruction of the investigation is itself a potentially impeachable office. The administration was expected to miss various deadlines Friday to comply with House investigators\u2019 requests for documents.\n\nThere\u2019s no clear-cut procedure in the Constitution for initiating an impeachment inquiry, leaving many questions about possible presidential obstruction untested in court, said Allan Lichtman, a history professor at American University.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no specification in the Constitution in what does and does not constitute a more formal impeachment inquiry or investigation,\u201d he said.\n\nRudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal attorney, dismissed the entire premise of the impeachment inquiry, which is centered on Trump asking Ukraine to investigate his possible political rival, Democratic former Vice President Biden.\n\n\u201cThe president was not tasking Ukraine to investigate a political opponent,\u201d Giuliani told The Associated Press on Thursday. \u201cHe wanted an investigation into a seriously conflicted former vice president of the United States who damaged the reputation of the United States in Ukraine.\u201d\n\nDemocrats have sought to use their declared impeachment investigation to bolster their case to access all sorts of documents from the administration, most recently secret grand jury information that underpinned special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report on Russian interference in the 2016 election. They have also threatened to use the administration\u2019s refusal to turn over documents and make witnesses available to potentially form an article of impeachment over obstruction of the congressional inquiry.\n\nWhere courts have generally required congressional oversight requests to demonstrate a legitimate legislative purpose, impeachment requests could be wide-ranging.\n\nIt is unclear if Democrats would wade into a lengthy legal fight with the administration over documents and testimony - or if they would just move straight to considering articles of impeachment.\n\n___\n\nAP writers Lisa Mascaro and Mark Sherman in Washington and Jonathan Lemire in New York contributed.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The impeachment investigation into President Trump widened on Friday into a constitutional battle between the executive branch and Congress, as Democrats subpoenaed White House officials and the president signaled his administration would not cooperate.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Zeke Miller", "Jill Colvin"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/04/trump_02160_c0-0-5472-3190_s1770x1032.jpg?84283544d3cc688d49296344fdb2455c1a0f271f", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
