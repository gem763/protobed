As she was taken away in the ambulance, Sonia realised that she needed to inform Martin about what\u2019s transpired, and thus she called him. However, his phone went straight to voicemail \u2014 much to her dismay.\n\nMeanwhile, at the Slaters\u2019, Kush (Davood Ghadami), Jean (Gillian Wright) and Kat (Jessie Wallace) deliberated over Martin\u2019s inability to return to the Square considering the circumstances which forced him to leave in the first place, but nonetheless Kush was adamant that he needed to know what happened.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOver at the hospital, Sonia informed Bex that Martin was on his way \u2014 a lie which she later regretted. However, Max (Jake Wood) and Stuart (Ricky Champ) both applauded her for giving Bex something to look forward to, but Sonia wasn\u2019t so sure, and the discussion of Martin unleashed the anger she feels towards her ex-husband.\n\nShe berated Martin for not answering her calls, claiming that he\u2019s \u2018made his choice\u2019 and that he doesn\u2019t care about his daughter.\n\nHowever, unbeknown to Sonia, Martin was already back on the Square.\n\nAs Ben grew concerned over the threat he\u2019d received off Kheerat and Jags Panesar (Jaz Deol and Amar Adatia), an angry Martin \u2014 in cognito, of course \u2014 watched from afar.\n\nBex is the reason he\u2019s back, but will he be out for retribution on Ben also?\n\nEastEnders continues on Monday 7th October at 8pm on BBC One.\n\nNeed support?
