REUTERS/Brian Snyder\n\nCampaign officials for Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, said the big fundraising haul was evidence of his continued strength in the Democratic presidential race despite slipping in some public opinion polls in the last month or two.\n\nSanders, who had been running second to former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden in most Democratic presidential polls for months, has also fallen behind fellow progressive Elizabeth Warren, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, in several recent polls.\n\n\u201cMedia elites and professional pundits have tried repeatedly to dismiss this campaign, and yet working-class Americans keep saying loudly and clearly that they want a political revolution,\u201d Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said in a statement.\n\nSanders was the first of the 19 candidates seeking the Democratic nomination to challenge President Donald Trump in 2020 to report a third-quarter total. The haul for Sanders surpasses the top Democratic fundraising total in the second quarter, the $24.8 million raised by rival Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana.\n\nThe campaign rushed to make the strong fundraising numbers public, releasing them to reporters just minutes after the Federal Election Commission\u2019s quarterly deadline for reporting fundraising totals, which came at midnight on Monday.\n\nCampaigns must file detailed financial reports by Oct. 15. The campaign said Sanders has raised a total of $61.5 million since he launched his bid in February.\n\nShakir and other Sanders officials have pointed to the grassroots, small-dollar nature of his fundraising as a sign of the breadth of his support.\n\nThe campaign said the final day of the third quarter on Monday was Sanders\u2019 second biggest fundraising day of the campaign, although it did not give a total. The average donation for the quarter was $18.07.\n\nNearly all of Sanders\u2019 donors had not hit their maximum allowed contribution, the campaign said, meaning they can give again as the race rolls on. The first state nominating contest, in Iowa, will be on Feb. 3, 2020.\n\nSanders also transferred $2.6 million from other campaign accounts to help fund his race, the campaign said.", "description": "U.S. presidential candidate Bernie Sanders raised $25.3 million in the third quarter of 2019 for his White House run, his campaign said on Tuesday, piling up 1.4 million individual donations and surpassing the $18 million he raised in the second quarter.", "authors": ["John Whitesides", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435839301&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF902H7", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
