You can't tell nobody nothin', not a thing,\" Wilkins allegedly said, according to the indictment.\n\nGranville County\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what \"racially insensitive\" language Brindell believed was on the tape that he was so fearful would be released. His office is also facing a second investigation from the district attorney over \"accounting practices and controlled substance interdiction efforts.\"\n\nWilkins was released on $20,000 bond Monday after appearing before a Granville County judge. He is technically not barred from continuing to serve as sheriff while the case is ongoing, according to Freeman.\n\nHis first court date isn't until Oct. 9, though, so the Granville County Board of Commissioners could vote to remove him from office.\n\nHe was ordered to surrender his passport and have no contact with the people involved in the case as part of the conditions of his release.\n\n\"It is something the public has a right to have diligently reviewed,\" Freeman said. \"No one is above the law.\"\n\nABC News' Mark Osborne contributed to this report.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
