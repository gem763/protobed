Yoo is a cofounder of Boston-based Kyruus \u2014 which develops software that health systems can leverage to best match patients with doctors \u2014 where she also served as chief product officer before taking up her role at Andreessen Horowitz, according to her LinkedIn profile.\n\nThat a prominent VC firm known for its hefty investments in tech firms has hired a health tech pro as general partner underscores that investors see digital health as a massive opportunity. Andreessen Horowitz has poured funds into digital health startups over the last year: Notably, the VC giant led health insurtech Devoted Health's $300 millionraise last October \u2014 an industry blockbuster considering the average deal size for a digital health startup was $22 million in 2018, per Rock Health. Business Insider Intelligence\n\nAndreessen Horowitz also shoveled cash into Ciitizen, a tech firm boosting patient health data shareability, in January 2019, and contributed to chronic disease management upstart Omada's financing round in June. With Yoo as a general partner, we should see the VC giant funnel even more cash into health tech cos' funding rounds: Yoo says she'll have her sights set on companies looking to disentangle the healthcare journey for patients and streamline revenue management for healthcare leaders.\n\nBut Andreessen Horowitz seen isn't the only investment giant staking a claim in health tech companies: SoftBank Vision Fund, the world's largest tech investor, led health benefits firm Collective Health's $215 million funding round in June, for instance.\n\nWe expect traditional healthcare firms will ramp up investment activity in digital health startups, too \u2014 here are the areas we think each stakeholder will be eyeing:\n\nBehavioral health startups will likely attract attention from insurers. The behavioral health space was a hotbed for investment in the first three quarters of 2019 \u2014 and we saw insurers partaking large-scale deals: Centene led Quartet Health's $60 million round in June, while UnitedHealth's Optum tied up with Talkspace to make the service to 2 million of its members in May. It makes sense that insurers are betting on tech-enabled mental health startups since they'll likely be shouldering a sizable share of the $238 billion the US is expected to spend on mental health in 2020.\n\nDigital therapeutics should be a cash magnet for pharma companies. Not only have we seen digital therapeutics firms landing big research partnerships with pharma companies in recent months, the deep-pocketed giants are also shelling out cash for startups' investment rounds: Pear Therapeutics \u2014 which makes prescription digital treatments for conditions ranging from insomnia to drug addiction\u2014 received funding from drug maker Novartis in each of its 2018 funding rounds. We think pharma giants will continue to dispense dollars into these companies, especially those working to develop treatments for conditions that have historically been difficult to treat with traditional meds \u2014 like obesity, for which there are only a handful of costly FDA-approved drugs on the market.\n\nAnd precision medicine firms are likely to rope in funds from providers. Hospitals have become much more active investors in the past five years: Investment deals involving at least one provider-linkedb VC fund reached nearly $1.3 billion in 2018, almost triple the amount recorded in 2013. We think the rapid swelling will continue over the next few years \u2014 and we could see startups working to enhance precision medicine efforts on the receiving end of their investments because of its promise to streamline diagnoses and treatments. We've seen health systems pour money into precision medicine funds in an attempt to get in on a market that could reach $88.6 billion by 2022.\n\nWant to read more stories like this one?
