A real cop hauled him away.", "language": "en", "text": "A New Mexico teen who allegedly pretended to be a Bernalillo County sheriff\u2019s officer later found himself crying real tears when an actual cop showed up.\n\nBrenden Wysynski, 18, is facing a misdemeanor charge for impersonating a peace officer, according to court records. He pleaded not guilty on Sept. 24, and his attorney denied the teen had any ill will.\n\nWearing jeans, a dark polo and an Air Force hat, Wysynski stopped a silver Nissan SUV for speeding, authorities said. In a police video, the 6-foot-2 teen\u2019s gray Ford sedan can be seen with blue and red lights flashing. The driver had said that his sister was sick and that he was rushing to get to the hospital, police say Wysynski later told them.\n\nAlbuquerque Police Officer Danny Anzo pulled over to assist what he believed to be another officer making a routine traffic stop but quickly realized something was odd, he told KOAT.\n\n\u201cThe vehicle that conducted the traffic stop didn\u2019t have any markings, and the person that was standing outside wasn\u2019t wearing a uniform, didn\u2019t have any equipment on them,\u201d Anzo said as he recounted the incident.\n\nWysynski, who described himself as a gamer, computer engineer and funny person on his private Facebook account, claimed to have been with the department for three years, according to Anzo, a 13-year veteran. Although Wysynski had a Bernalillo County Sheriff\u2019s Office badge attached to one of his hips, his youthful appearance made Anzo question more, the officer told the news outlet.\n\nWhen Anzo asked for clarification about Wysynski\u2019s work department and for ID, the teen allegedly told the officer that he was \u201cunder equipped\u201d and headed over to a courthouse.\n\nWysynski was asked to sit in the back of Anzo\u2019s cop car, which the officer said prompted a pretty quick confession.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just going to be straight up honest with you,\u201d Wysynski said, according to Anzo. \u201cI\u2019m not a cop.\u201d\n\nAnzo called a supervisor with the Bernalillo County Sheriff\u2019s Office to check out the badge Wysynski was flashing.\n\nBut the teen wasn\u2019t done changing the details of his story, according to the police account of the event.\n\nWysynski initially told Anzo that he had bought his fake badge online. But when the Bernalillo County Sheriff\u2019s Office supervisor arrived on the scene, the teen claimed the badge had belonged to his late father.\n\nThe teen had purchased a real but outdated badge online, according to KOAT\u2019s review of court documents.\n\nOfficers found a revolver in a gun case, six magnum cartridges, a Go-Pro camera and handcuffs in Wysynski\u2019s car, according to KOAT\u2019s review of the police report. The teen also had red and white LED light bars, \u201cwarning notices,\u201d a BCSO bumper sticker, and a \u201cthin blue line\u201d vanity plate.\n\nAnzo could not be immediately reached, and the Bernalillo County Sheriff\u2019s Office did not immediately respond to request for comment.\n\nWysynski\u2019s lawyer, public defender Carlos Scarborough, said a case like Wysynski\u2019s isn\u2019t seen very often.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at a young man who in this case wasn\u2019t out to hurt anyone. It seems he was concerned about community safety,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThis teenager has admired law enforcement for a long time and respects the work they do.\u201d\n\nWysynski\u2019s Facebook page shows an affinity toward law enforcement and the armed services. He has liked the pages for many New Mexico-based law enforcement agencies, pro-cop President Trump and even the Blue Lives Matter page.\n\nWysynski didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nA bench trial is set for the morning of Nov. 6, according to public records.\n\nIf found guilty, Wysynski could face a maximum of 364 days in county jail and up to a $1,000 fine.\n\nThe likelihood that Wysynski will serve much time is low, according to Albuquerque-based criminal defense attorney David Serna, who mentioned that the courts in the area are fairly lenient and pointed out that the jails are overcrowded.\n\n\u201cWhat he\u2019s probably going to get is a stern warning and supervised probation,\u201d Serna said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be watched for a while to see if he can conform himself to society\u2019s rule. The beautiful thing about probation is that it gives him a chance to prove himself, and if he messes up, then he goes to jail.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nPolice say a man was impersonating officers.
