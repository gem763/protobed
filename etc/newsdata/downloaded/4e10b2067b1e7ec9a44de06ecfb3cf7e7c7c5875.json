In fact, Clarkson is such a diehard fan that she used her immense clout to gain access to set, meet the cast, and suss out season 5. And boy did the devil deliver.\n\nEarlier this year, Netflix announced it had added six more episodes to the final season, bringing its total episode tally to 16. Which might not sound like much compared to earlier seasons but season 4 only had 10 episodes. Not to mention, the show was also cancelled at one point before Netflix revived it.\n\nAnywho, charming devil Tom Ellis revealed season 5 will be split into two equal halves.\n\n\u201cNetflix is going to drop eight episodes and then there\u2019s going to be a little break and then they\u2019re going to drop another eight episodes,\u201d he revealed.\n\nPro: You can\u2019t binge it all at once.\n\nCon: You can\u2019t binge it all at once.\n\nThe supernatural series follows actual devil Lucifer Morningstar (Ellis) after he leaves Hell to live with the humans. He likes to spend his time stirring the pot and helping LAPD detective Chloe Decker (Lauren German) solve crimes. Sometimes, he just annoys her for fun.\n\nSEASON 4 SPOILER ALERT!\n\nJust as Chloe finally tells Lucy that she loves him, (after four goddamn seasons) Lucifer heads back to Hell, for an indefinite amount of time. That\u2019s how season 4 ended. I know.\n\nBack to Clarkson, she also took her mum and sister to set because they\u2019re all very big fans. It really is just five minutes of Clarkson and her family freaking out over everyone.\n\nLucifer is available for your binging pleasure on Netflix now.", "description": "Charming devil\u00a0Tom Ellis\u00a0revealed the fifth and final season of 'Lucifer' will be split into two equal halves on Netflix with a little break between.", "authors": ["Steffanie Tan"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/Lucifer.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
