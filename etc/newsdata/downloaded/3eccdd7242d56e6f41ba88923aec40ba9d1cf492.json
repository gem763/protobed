Yelich will return to Milwaukee and have additional testing on the knee today.\n\nWinners of five in a row including Tuesday\u2019s 4-3 victory over the Marlins, the Brewers are one game behind the Chicago Cubs for the second NL wild-card spot.\n\nHad he been able to finish the year, Yelich would have had a shot at winning MVP again. If he is truly done for the year, he\u2019ll end 2019 with a .329/.429/.671 batting line, 44 home runs, 97 RBI, 30 stolen bases, and 100 runs scored in 131 games. The All-Star outfielder was also leading the majors in slugging percentage and OPS when he went down.\n\n\u201cWe feel awful for Christian,\u201d manager Craig Counsell said. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing that resonates with me right now. He\u2019s a special player and it\u2019s a joy to watch him play every day. He\u2019s the best at what he does. Not being able to see that every day is not good.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: RealClearLife, a news and lifestyle publisher, is now a part of InsideHook.
