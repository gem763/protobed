But Trump dismissed the matter, insisting he did nothing wrong.\n\nHe declared Friday that the complaint was made by a \u201cpartisan whistleblower,\u201d though he later said he did not know the identity of the person. He chided reporters for asking about it and said it was \u201cjust another political hack job.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have conversations with many leaders. It\u2019s always appropriate. Always appropriate,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAt the highest level always appropriate. And anything I do, I fight for this country.\u201d\n\nSome of the whistleblower\u2019s allegations appear to center on Ukraine, according to a person familiar with the matter. The person was not authorized to discuss the issue by name and was granted anonymity.\n\nTrump, who sat in the Oval Office with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, whom he was hosting for a state visit, was asked if he knew if the whistleblower\u2019s complaint centered on a July 25 phone call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky. The president responded \u201cI really don\u2019t know\u201d but continued to insist any phone call he made with a head of state was \u201cperfectly fine and respectful.\u201d\n\nThe standoff raises fresh questions about the extent to which Trump\u2019s appointees are protecting the Republican president from oversight and, specifically, whether his new acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, is working with the Justice Department to shield the president from the reach of Congress.\n\nIt also plunged the Trump administration into an extraordinary showdown with Congress over access to the whistleblower\u2019s Aug. 12 complaint as lawmakers press their oversight of the executive branch.\n\nMARCUS TAPPAN via Getty Images Joseph Maguire looks on during his Senate confirmation hearing to become director of the National Counterterrorism Center.

A lawmaker said the complaint was \u201cbased on a series of events.\u201d\n\nThe inspector general appeared before the House intelligence committee behind closed doors Thursday but declined, under administration orders, to reveal to members the substance of the complaint.\n\nThe chairman of the House committee said Trump\u2019s attack on the whistleblower was \u201cdisturbing.\u201d Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., told reporters it\u2019s also \u201cdeeply disturbing\u201d that the White House appears to know more about the whistleblower\u2019s complaint than its intended recipient \u2015 Congress.\n\nThe information \u201cdeserves a thorough investigation,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cCome hell or high water, that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.\u201d\n\nSchiff, who said he was prepared to go to court to force the administration to open up about the complaint, said he was worried the president\u2019s actions will have a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on other whistleblowers.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what I discussed.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats are fighting the administration separately for access to witnesses and documents in impeachment probes. Democrats are also looking into whether Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani traveled to Ukraine to pressure the government to aid the president\u2019s reelection effort by investigating the activities of potential rival Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter, who worked for a Ukrainian gas company.\n\nTrump was asked Friday if be brought up Biden in the call with Zelensky, and he answered, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what I discussed.\u201d But then he used the moment to urge the media \u201cto look into\u201d Biden\u2019s background with Ukraine.\n\nDuring a rambling interview Thursday on CNN, Giuliani was asked whether he had asked Ukraine to look into Biden. Giuliani initially said, \u201cNo, actually I didn\u2019t,\u201d but seconds later he said, \u201cOf course I did.\u201d\n\nGiuliani has spent months trying to drum up potentially damaging evidence about Biden\u2019s ties to Ukraine. He told CNN that Trump was unaware of his actions.\n\n\u201cI did what I did on my own,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cI told him about it afterward.\n\nLater, Giuliani tweeted, \u201cA President telling a Pres-elect of a well known corrupt country he better investigate corruption that affects US is doing his job.\u201d Giuliani\u2019s efforts have sparked anger among Democrats who have claimed that Trump, in the aftermath of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation, may have asked for foreign assistance in his upcoming reelection bid.\n\nAlex Wong via Getty Images WASHINGTON, DC - SEPTEMBER 19: Committee Chairman Rep.

The call took place one day after Mueller\u2019s faltering testimony to Congress effectively ended the threat his probe posed to the White House.\n\nSchiff said he, too, could not confirm whether newspaper reports were accurate because the administration was claiming executive privilege in withholding the complaint. But letters from the inspector general to the committee released Thursday said it was an \u201curgent\u201d matter of \u201cserious or flagrant abuse\u201d that must be shared with lawmakers.\n\nThe letters also made it clear that Maguire consulted with the Justice Department in deciding not to transmit the complaint to Congress in a further departure from standard procedure. It\u2019s unclear whether the White House was also involved, Schiff said.\n\nTrump named Maguire, a former Navy official, as acting intelligence director last month, after the departure of Director Dan Coats, a former Republican senator who often clashed with the president, and the retirement of Sue Gordon, a career professional in the No. 2 position.\n\nMaguire has refused to discuss details of the whistleblower complaint, but he has been subpoenaed by the House panel and is expected to testify publicly next Thursday. Maguire and the inspector general, Michael Atkinson, also are expected next week at the Senate intelligence committee.\n\nAtkinson wrote in letters that Schiff released that he and Maguire had hit an \u201cimpasse\u201d over the acting director\u2019s decision not to share the complaint with Congress. Atkinson said he was told by the legal counsel for the intelligence director that the complaint did not actually meet the definition of an \u201curgent concern.\u201d And he said the Justice Department said it did not fall under the director\u2019s jurisdiction because it did not involve an intelligence professional.\n\nAtkinson said he disagreed with that Justice Department view. The complaint \u201cnot only falls under DNI\u2019s jurisdiction,\u201d Atkinson wrote, \u201cbut relates to one of the most significant and important of DNI\u2019s responsibilities to the American people.\u201d\n\nThe inspector general said he requested authorization to at the very least disclose the \u201cgeneral subject matter\u201d to the committee but had not been allowed to do so.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Deb Riechmann, Eric Tucker, Alan Fram and Zeke Miller contributed to this report.", "description": "Speaking from the Oval Office, Trump tried to dismiss growing concerns about his alleged misconduct and accusations his administration is engaged in a co...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8515ad2300005700d035af.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
