The new home they hankered after, however, was more elaborate than most would dare to dream of.\n\nAfter leaving London in 2004, they borrowed \u00a31.8 million to build a staggering modernist \u2018lighthouse\u2019 at Down End Point, a renowned beauty spot in North Devon. The six-bedroom house was to be rendered white to catch the light bouncing off the ocean, its four-storey cylindrical tower featuring a dining room with 9ft-high windows, master bedroom and observatory.\n\nIn the main body of the house, to its side, would be a kitchen with uninterrupted sea views, a guest wing, sauna and cinema; in front, a 60ft glass-edged infinity pool with panoramic views across Croyde Bay.\n\nEdward and Hazel Short (pictured) borrowed \u00a31.8million to build a modernist 'lighthouse' at Down End Point in Devon. They were to create a six-bedroom house for their family (pictured with their children in Devon)\n\nPerhaps most impressive, however, were the 25 steel piles that were going to be drilled deep into the bedrock beneath, to defy coastal erosion, hold the house in position and present the appearance of a \u2018floating\u2019 home in years to come.\n\nIn other words, a very ambitious project. But one, as anyone who watched Channel 4\u2019s Grand Designs this week will attest, that has not quite gone according to plan.\n\nThe programme \u2014 compelling, if cringeworthy, viewing \u2014 charted the Shorts\u2019 struggle to realise their dreams since 2011. It revealed they had taken out a series of crippling loans that failed to cover the extortionate building costs, their debt compounded by a second home Edward built on the site which he hoped to sell to continue financing the project.\n\nAs the Shorts\u2019 daughters, Nicole and Lauren, grew up, and the worry lines became etched ever deeper on their parents\u2019 faces, every devastating setback only seemed to make Edward more determined to pursue his dreams.\n\nThe upshot? A debilitating \u00a33 million worth of debt and, two grown-up children later, the Shorts\u2019 much trumpeted new home looks less like a lighthouse and more like a ramshackle multi-storey car park.\n\nBy 2017, the couple had run out of funds and the means to acquire more. Today, Chesil Cliff House boasts no gently curved whitewashed walls or sparkling azure swimming pool.\n\nIt was to be rendered white to catch the light bouncing off the ocean, its four-storey cylindrical tower featuring a dining room with 9ft-high windows, master bedroom and observatory\n\nBut the family home ended up looking like a ramshackle multi-storey car park and created \u00a33 million worth of debt\n\nThe dining room is still a breeze-block shell and the overall effect, as TV presenter Kevin McCloud, who has followed the family\u2019s progress, commented despairingly this week, a \u2018desolate carcass\u2019.\n\n\u2018I sometimes wonder if I might have been a bit ambitious,\u2019 says Edward, the director of a music company called the Department of Good Ideas. Quite.\n\nBut it isn\u2019t the fact that the project has been shelved that bothers him most. Nor is it the grief he is getting from locals who loathe the look of his perennially unfinished project, which one described as akin to a \u2018North Korean missile bunker\u2019.\n\nIt is the destruction of his 20-year marriage. While Edward and daughter Lauren, now 18, appeared on Grand Designs this week, there was no sign of Hazel and the couple\u2019s elder offspring Nicole, 20. Pointing the blame squarely at stress sparked by his lighthouse project, Edward admitted he and Hazel had separated last year and said his \u2018ambition and vanity has probably collapsed the marriage\u2019.\n\nThe ambitious self builder had dreamed of building a white art-deco lighthouse, but ran out of money in summer 2017, when the project halted. He now says the property should be finished in 2020\n\nSo what on earth compelled him to keep going for so long? And how does he feel now the full scale of his failure has been made public?\n\n\u2018My wife has been through a terrible time. I feel so bad. She didn\u2019t deserve what she\u2019s gone through,\u2019 Edward, 50, tells me this week.\n\nIt has gone \u2018spectacularly wrong,\u2019 he admits.\n\nPerversely, his feelings of guilt have made him more determined to plough on so he can finally afford to buy Hazel a home fit to live in: \u2018My biggest motivation is to get out of this and buy her a nice house.\u2019\n\nWhile many might question Edward\u2019s sanity in striving to complete the project, likely to cost another \u00a32 million, the truth is he has little choice. He can\u2019t get the price he needs from the sale of his second home he has built until the lighthouse is finished, because health-and-safety regulations prevent any prospective owner from moving in permanently.\n\nHe is, he laments, \u2018trapped\u2019 with no option but to borrow more: \u2018I\u2019ll lose everything if I don\u2019t, so I might as well.\u2019\n\nAn affable man who made his name launching a string of Nineties dance music compilation CDs, Edward speaks candidly about his unenviable predicament.\n\nHe won\u2019t be drawn into details of how he and Hazel, both now renting property in nearby Bideford, split last year, but concedes he \u2018never would have started\u2019 building the lighthouse if he thought it would put his marriage at risk.\n\nHazel said the couple's money was completely 'gambled' and if she thought about the mounting debt, she would not be able to get any sleep\n\nThe house was described as 'a skeleton' on Grand Designs, but Edward insisted he wanted to finish the home. Edward said: 'We all have dreams and don\u2019t often act on one of them. Unfortunately, I\u2019m one of those people who tries to make it happen'\n\nAn artist's impression of their dream home with a four storey observation tower and a glass- fronted infinity pool\n\nThe two are still on amicable terms and watched Grand Designs this week with their daughters \u2014 an experience Edward describes as \u2018emotional\u2019, adding: \u2018We wouldn\u2019t get back together, but she\u2019s the mother of my children so I\u2019m always going to be protective and do what I can for her.\u2019\n\nNicole and Lauren were both under five when the family moved to Devon from London in 2004.\n\nEnticed by the best beaches in England, Edward was able to continue his music career from the South-West and Hazel quit her job as a retail buyer in the capital to bring up the children. Shortly after their arrival, the site went on sale. Edward admits \u2018ambition took over\u2019 as they scrabbled savings and borrowed enough to pay \u00a31.4 million for the existing property on it \u2014 an unremarkable yellow fronted 1950s home \u2014 and raised a further \u00a31.8 million to build their lighthouse.\n\nApparently rueing his compulsive behaviour, he adds that \u2018we all have dreams and don\u2019t often act on one of them. Unfortunately, I\u2019m one of those people who tries to make it happen. Very early on I thought it would be so cool to knock it down and build a lighthouse, in a rocky area where ships would have gone to ground. I knew the planners would like it.\u2019\n\nApproval was granted in 2010. Edward let Grand Designs cover the project as an \u2018insurance policy\u2019 to document how it was built to future buyers and deployed architect Alan Phillips to turn the inconvenient fact that coastal erosion put the site in danger of crumbling into the sea into an unlikely plus.\n\nDespite the state of the desolate building after a decade of development, Edward said he couldn't stop trying to finish the lighthouse\n\nAccording to Phillips, the finished article could look \u2018stunning.\u2019 With up to 25 piles (steel poles hammered up to 25 metres into the bedrock), he said: \u2018The whole of the cliff face could be washed away, until we get to just raw rock, and the house would just be floating over the top of it \u2014 but completely stable.\u2019\n\nYet it was, with hindsight, perhaps laughably na\u00efve for Edward to expect the project to take just 18 months to complete \u2014 not least because an impending recession in 2012 prompted cold feet from the bank, which withdrew its lending offer.\n\nBoxes were unpacked, two \u2018gutted\u2019 daughters informed and the project put on hold as Edward attempted to secure funds elsewhere. In 2014, he borrowed \u00a3500,000 from a hedge fund, his intention to use the money to build a three-bedroom home on the site and sell it for \u00a32.5 million to raise cash for the lighthouse.\n\nBy 2016, his already massive risk had grown even greater with rising building costs. Edward needed more money than the sale of the second home could provide, and borrowed a further \u00a32.5 million from private investors.\n\nWhen Grand Designs returned that year to film an update, viewers could already see the strains on the marriage, with Hazel\u2019s caution at odds with her husband\u2019s unassailable optimism.\n\nHazel admitted that if she thought about their mounting debt too much she wouldn\u2019t sleep. \u2018We\u2019ve been forced into a corner. All our money\u2019s gone. It\u2019s all gambled,\u2019 a decidedly nervous-looking Hazel said. And while Edward described living in the lighthouse as a \u2018dream\u2019, Hazel remarked that it was a \u2018nightmare at the moment\u2019.\n\nToday, Edward admits he was addicted to finding money: \u2018Once you\u2019ve started, it\u2019s hard to change. We were on a roller coaster.\u2019\n\nHe claims his wife never begged him to stop. \u2018I\u2019d say she was very supportive,\u2019 he says, her faith stemming in part from the quarter of a million pounds they forked out on professionals to advise them: \u2018We were pretty confident of the build and the landscape.\u2019\n\nYet his unbridled optimism backfired. After their existing house was finally demolished in 2016, and the family had moved into rented accommodation, it transpired that excavating to the bedrock to lay the lighthouse foundations was tantamount to drilling wood with candyfloss. Or, as one shocked workman put it: \u2018I\u2019ve driven a digger for ten years and it\u2019s the hardest rock I\u2019ve ever seen.\u2019\n\nThe process added six months to the schedule and a further \u00a31 million to costs. \u2018I never tested how hard the rock was. I never thought of that,\u2019 Edward tells me, laughing at the irony that the concrete his builders were pouring back in was not as hard as the rock they were taking out.\n\nAdmittedly, the \u2018floating\u2019 drive leading to the property \u2014 suspended between 25ft and 40ft off the ground and requiring five lorryfuls of concrete \u2014 wasn\u2019t cheap either. \u2018It was costed at \u00a3100,000 and came in at a quarter of a million,\u2019 says Edward, who still seems shocked by how things turned out and insists he was \u2018so well prepped.\u2019\n\nThe super-strength glazing required to survive sea gales cost a further \u00a3200,000, while the curved walls of the lighthouse were incredibly difficult to construct from breeze blocks. One of the crane operators tasked with constructing the \u00a3150,000 circular steel frame described it as a \u2018bit like threading the eye of a needle\u2019.\n\nAt least the couple\u2019s daughters appeared devoted to the area when, as teenagers, they were shown on TV jumping wet-suited with their parents into the nearby sea, during a brief respite from the \u2018scary\u2019 mounting debt. \u2018When we all come down here we\u2019re just like little kids again,\u2019 said Hazel. By May 2017, however, the family had used up the last of their loan. To carry on with the building, they had to sell the second home for at least \u00a32 million. Yet the negative impact of the ongoing building work would reduce the asking price. It was, Edward said, a \u2018horrendous Catch-22\u2019.\n\nIn July 2017, building ground to halt, with Edward describing the months that followed as \u2018a low point\u2019, but insisting he couldn\u2019t \u2018come this far and give up\u2019.\n\nWhen Grand Designs contacted him this year to film the next instalment of the project he was surprised. \u2018I thought they would want to wait until it was done,\u2019 says Edward.\n\nPerhaps they had an inkling it might never be finished. Last month, McCloud witnessed the \u2018bare bones of a house\u2019, with \u2018please finish\u2019 graffitied by an unknown artist on a wall, the grey concrete cylindrical shape marring the Devon coast.\n\nEven Edward described it as an eyesore, but adds, defensively: \u2018I hope people will wait and judge when it\u2019s done rather than as a half-finished building site with a horrendous fence round it.\u2019 And it will be done, he insists: \u2018I can\u2019t leave a legacy like that, and the hate that people have.\u2019\n\nDaughter Lauren admitted to camera she \u2018didn\u2019t think it would be this difficult,\u2019 but at least she agreed to appear on the programme. Nicole, notably, did not, and is, perhaps, as perturbed by the predicament as her mother.\n\nEdward is now pinning his hopes on new funding and insists the lighthouse will be completed in August 2020, and put on the market to recoup his debts. He says Hazel, now an office administrator who declined to discuss the project with the Mail, supports his plan, as \u2018the only course available to us\u2019.\n\nAnd fuelled by loyalty to the woman he lost to his ambition, he adds: \u2018I\u2019m hugely driven to get that stability \u2014 a family home for her and the girls.\u2019\n\nGrand Designs, Wednesdays, 9pm, Channel 4.", "description": "ANTONIA HOYLE: Edward and Hazel Short had all their money 'gambled' after investing in a dream home in Devon which left them \u00a33m in debt.
