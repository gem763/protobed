He said each trap had more than 100 dead wasps inside.\n\n\u201cTwo traps on table contained many wasps. And more traps in place. There has to be a better way. We had three wasps feeding off jam on our plate, none hassled us, we didn\u2019t panic, and they all flew away happy,\u201d the 55-year-old IT consultant told The Independent.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Earlier this year a study, published in the journal Biological Conservation, warned that numbers are plummeting so quickly that almost all insects could vanish within a century. According to their review of 73 historic reports of insect declines, more than 40 per cent of species are at risk of extinction with decades.\n\nMatt Shardlow, chief executive of conservation organisation Buglife, has previously advised the National Trust on this issue and says he gets calls from people \u201coutraged\u201d that public sites are using traps. He told The Independent that leaving out traps out actually increases the number of wasps.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

This means you increase the number of wasps near people.\n\n\u201cYou end up with a soup of decaying, smelling matter. What these properties are basically showing the public is that they are doing something, but it doesn\u2019t actually achieve anything.\u201d\n\nHe recommends properties keep lids on sugary things to stop wasps appearing in the first place. He says there should be simple white jackets with elasticated cuffs available for people who are allergic to wasps, and adds that wasps are more likely to attack if threatened so it is better to waft them away as opposed to swatting them if they come close.\n\nSeirian Sumner, an expert in behavioural ecology at University College London (UCL), said wasps caught in cafes at this time of year are workers that are coming to the end of their lives. They are heading to cafes because their services are no longer required by the colony and this means killing them does not affect overall populations.\n\n\u201cThe adult wasps don\u2019t eat prey (they are just the hunters!), but they still need sugar. When they are feeding brood, they get a sugary reward from the larvae, in return for their prey load. There are fewer larvae to feed and so less sugary rewards for them. So the wasps have to start looking elsewhere for sugar \u2013 for example a National Trust cafe,\u201d said Dr Sumner.\n\n\u201cIt may be saddening to see large numbers of wasps in these traps, but given that each colony has around 6,000 workers, this is a small cull, especially so when you consider how many millions of wasps are killed by pest controllers from people\u2019s gardens and lofts very week in the UK,\u201d she said.\n\nA spokesperson from the National Trust said that the traps \u2013 which hang from trees \u2013 were put out at the end of July and will be taken back in as soon as the number of wasps in the cafe drops.\n\nThe spokesperson said: \u201cWasp traps are used as a last resort at National Trust places and while we would rather not use them we have to assess the impact on visitor safety, especially for those with serious allergies.\n\n\u201cWe will always seek to use preventative measures such as decoy nests to deter wasp in the first instance. Occasionally, however, these are not effective, in which case we revert to alternative deterrents.\u201d", "description": "The National Trust has defended killing pollinators despite catastrophic declines, describing its wasp traps as a \u201clast resort\u201d to keep visitors safe.\u00a0 Andrew Perkin visited Knole\u00a0house\u00a0and said he was\u00a0\u201cvery disappointed\u201d to see that the trust\u00a0\u2013 which is meant to promote\u00a0environmental conservation \u2013 is using traps in its\u00a0cafe.
