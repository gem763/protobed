The negotiations took place in Stockholm on Saturday, resulting in a failure as the North Korean delegation broke off, saying the talks \u201chave not fulfilled\u201d their expectations.\n\nAlso on rt.com North Korea launches \u2018unidentified projectiles\u2019 hours after agreeing to resume nuke talks with US\n\nThe statement came in response to Washington\u2019s attempts to downplay the extent of the flop.The US State Department insisted that Pyongyang agreed to hold new talks in two weeks, while the remarks of the Korean chief nuclear negotiator, Kim Myong Gil, did not reflect \u201cthe content or spirit\u201d of the meeting.\n\nThe ministry argue that wasn\u2019t the case, expressing doubts that the US is able to come up with any meaningful suggestions in just two weeks.\n\nThe US is spreading a completely ungrounded story that both sides are open to meet after two weeks but as it has conceived nothing even after the passage of 99 days since the Panmunjom summit, it is not likely at all that it can produce a proposal commensurate to the expectations of the DPRK and to the concerns of the world in just fortnight.\n\nPyongyang went further and accused the US of using the Stockholm talks as a vanity event \u201cto meet its political goal of abusing the DPRK-US dialogue for its domestic political events.\u201d No actual preparations for the talks had been made by the US, the ministry claimed, as Washington simply repeated the same old points it produced before.\n\nAlso on rt.com North Korea says talks with US have FAILED, urges Washington to \u2018reconsider position\u2019\n\nSuch an approach makes North Korean leadership \u201csceptical\u201d about the existence of \u201cpolitical will\u201d in Washington to actually fix the bilateral relations, the ministry said, warning that the country does not seek to further engage into that pointless talks unless the US changes its attitude and stops its \u201chostile policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have no intention to hold such sickening negotiations as what happened this time before the US takes a substantial step to make complete and irreversible withdrawal of the hostile policy toward the DPRK,\u201d the statement reads.\n\nAs we have clearly identified the way for solving problem, the fate of the future DPRK-US dialogue depends on the U.S. attitude, and the end of this year is its deadline.\n\nWhile the relations between North Korea and the US have been quite hostile for decades, they got particularly heated during Donald Trump\u2019s Presidency. The US leader and his North Korean counterpart Kim Jong-un engaged in a bitter war of words, featuring military threats and personal insults, yet ultimately managed to stick to diplomacy and entered direct talks. Their first summit in Singapore, held in June 2018, was touted as a major breakthrough towards a peace settlement in the Korean Peninsula.\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018New phase in containing outside forces\u2019: North Korea brags of successful test of submarine-launched missile (PHOTOS)\n\nStill, the prospects of the negotiation process became uncertain this February after the Trump-Kim summit in Vietnam flopped. The new failure of a major diplomatic event in Stockholm makes the future of the talks even more unclear, while a re-ignition of the Korean Peninsula standoff grows increasingly possible.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
