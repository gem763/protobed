Clear analysis. Everything you\u2019ve come to expect from the newsroom of The Post -- for your ears.\n\nISIS leader dies in U.S. raid\n\nAbu Bakr al-Baghdadi has died. President Trump announced that the leader of the Islamic State detonated a suicide vest, killing himself and three of his children as U.S. troops closed in on him in northern Syria \u2014 where Trump announced a withdrawal of troops earlier this month.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn describing the raid over the weekend, Trump said Baghdadi \u201cdied like a dog. He died like a coward.\u201d The president seizing on the death as a major U.S. victory. \u201cHe died after running into a dead-end tunnel, whimpering and crying and screaming all the way.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t even know how he could have known that, since he wouldn\u2019t have necessarily been hearing real-time audio for that operation,\u201d says reporter Missy Ryan . \u201cThere are a lot of different narratives out there, but what we believe what has happened is that the United States has worked really closely with Kurdish intelligence in both Iraq and Syria.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe issues with cocoa certification\n\nCocoa farms in West Africa that use child labor and are linked to deforestation in the region have been approved for certification by the leading organizations charged with policing cocoa standards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of big holes in the certification process,\u201d says investigative business reporter Peter Whoriskey .\u201cincluding the largest of the certifiers, a Dutch organization called Utz, which certifies more cocoa in the world than anyone else.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile there are other organizations that audit cocoa farms, Whoriskey says Utz is an example of a company that\u201chas had significant lapses in its compliance reviews, casting doubt on the claims by major chocolate companies that the monitoring efforts are eliminating those abuses.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a statement to The Post, Utz said that it is adopting a new approach to child labor. \u201cWe acknowledge that things must change \u2026 A certification system must adapt and innovate to create more impact and provide more value to producers and companies. We have worked consistently to improve our standards, assurance mechanisms and associated interventions \u2014 and will continue to do so.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\nClimate change is creating a gender gap in sea turtles\n\nSand\u2019s temperature determines the sex of a turtle hatchling. The warmer the sand, the more likely the turtles will be female. With the warming climate, scientists expect turtle hatchlings worldwide to skew overwhelmingly female, making the animals an unwitting gauge for the warming climate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re seeing major gender disparities in south Florida, in Australia, in southern California,\u201d says West Africa bureau chief Danielle Paquette . \u201cThis is happening everywhere the Earth is getting hotter.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nPaquette spoke with biologists studying the phenomenon in Cape Verde\u2019s Boa Vista island, home to an enormous population of loggerhead sea turtles, an endangered species. Paquette reports that these creatures \u2014 which outlasted dinosaurs \u2014 could be plodding toward extinction.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:", "description": "Missy Ryan on how U.S. troops closed in on ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.
