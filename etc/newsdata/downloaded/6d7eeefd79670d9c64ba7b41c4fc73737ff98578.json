(iStock)\n\nNew renters and new homeowners are often on a tight budget, and yet they want to outfit their home with furniture that works for their surroundings. If you have limited dollars to spend, interior designers recommend focusing on a big-ticket item, such as investing in a good sofa that will last for the long-term.\n\nWe asked Cheryl Eisen, founder and president of Interior Marketing Group in New York City, to share her advice about which factors are important when choosing a sofa to fit any budget. Here are her recommendations:\n\n\u00b7 Shape: I love modular sofas, because they work in so many different layouts. They allow you to swap pieces and adjust the shape if you move to a new home or get tired of it. If you\u2019re going to invest in a piece, you want something that is adaptable for different spaces and uses.\n\n\u00b7 Size: The size should be consistent with the size and layout of your space. That\u2019s another reason modular pieces are a great investment, because the size and configuration can be easily tailored to suit your space.\n\n[How to create style in your home when you aren\u2019t sure what your style is]\n\n\u00b7 Design/Construction: Other important considerations include construction and design. You want to choose a piece that\u2019s timeless. To me, this means clean lines, neutral colors, high quality and durable construction. Choose a piece that is simple yet classic, nothing too trendy or bold. Over time, you may outgrow anything too taste-specific.\n\n\u00b7 Quality: Durability is essential, as well. A high-quality piece will stand the test of time and offer the comfort that will make it a worthy investment. Don\u2019t compromise quality for a piece that looks great but is of poor quality.\n\n\u00b7 Where to shop: I wouldn\u2019t recommend purchasing a sofa online unless you are able to view it in a showroom prior to purchasing it. You want to be able to test the look and feel to ensure you\u2019re getting the quality you\u2019re looking for. The only way to know how comfortable a sofa will be is to test it out for yourself!\n\n\u00b7 Custom design: Custom design is necessary only if you have a very specific style in mind or an unusual room layout that doesn\u2019t allow for a typical shape or size of most sofas.\n\n\u00b7 Making a good investment: Make sure you consider factors such as moving plans in the next few years and what the space and size of your new space might be.", "description": "TOWN SQUARE | Choose a piece that is simple yet classic, nothing too trendy or bold.
