REUTERS/Umit Bektas\n\nEleven Saudi officials are on trial in Riyadh for the killing of Khashoggi, a former royal insider turned critic of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, which took place inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2 2018.\n\nThe trial is being held behind closed doors but six sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters more than one of the defendants had mentioned Qahtani\u2019s name.\n\nAsked to comment, U.N. rapporteur for extrajudicial executions Agnes Callamard said she could not confirm their accounts but that if people were prepared to name him in court, she welcomed it.\n\n\u201cIf he appears to become or to be a person of interest as per the proceeding of the trial, then of course the next logical step must be to bring him in the trial,\u201d she said, noting that his name had already been mentioned by the Saudi prosecutor.\n\n\u201cWhile I will welcome calling him as a key witness, I think that is still very far from where he should be, which is behind the dock as one of the accused,\u201d Callamard told Reuters ahead of a ceremony just yards from the consulate door which Khashoggi entered shortly after 1 pm on Oct. 2 last year.\n\nHe was dead within minutes, Turkish officials say.\n\nThe Saudi public prosecutor said last November that Qahtani had discussed Khashoggi\u2019s activities before he entered the Saudi consulate with the team which went on to kill him.\n\nThe prosecutor said Qahtani acted in coordination with deputy intelligence chief Ahmed al-Asiri, who he said had ordered Khashoggi\u2019s repatriation from Turkey and that the lead negotiator on the ground then decided to kill him.\n\nBoth men have been dismissed but while Asiri is on trial, Qahtani is not.\n\nThe government communications office did not respond to a request for comment. Reuters has been unable to reach the public prosecutor or Qahtani.\n\n\u201cHe was mentioned by the Saudi prosecutor, who however did not indict him, did not charge him, even though by his own words the prosecutor acknowledged that Saud al-Qahtani had called on the team to bring back Mr Khashoggi because he was a national security threat,\u201d Callamard said.\n\n\u201cSo just for that reason alone he should have been charged.\u201d\n\nCONFESSIONS\n\nTwo of the sources said that for Qahtani\u2019s name to be mentioned in court would likely have to have been approved by senior authorities in the kingdom.\n\nDiplomatic sources have said that Western allies want Riyadh to give up Qahtani in order to satisfy demands for accountability. It was unclear whether the defendants\u2019 statements about him went further than what has already been officially announced.\n\nOne of the six sources with knowledge of the court proceedings who spoke recently to Reuters said several defendants had confessed to their role and offered \u201cgruesome details\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey told the court they met with Qahtani the night before going to Istanbul,\u201d said the source, who like the others requested anonymity to discuss the case.\n\nIn January, six sources with links to the royal court told Reuters Qahtani continued to wield influence in the crown prince\u2019s inner circle while keeping a low profile.\n\nThe murder of Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist, sparked Saudi Arabia\u2019s worst political crisis in a generation and threatened ties with close allies.\n\nSaudi media said the court has convened eight sessions since the trial began in January, during which the defendants confessed and the prosecutor requested the death penalty for five of them.\n\nThere is no indication that Qahtani has appeared.\n\nDUTY-BOUND\n\nOn Wednesday, Callamard joined Amazon.com Inc Chief Executive and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos, as well as friends and supporters of Khashoggi and rights activists, who pledged to keep fighting for justice.\n\n\u201cWe will never give up on this,\u201d said Andrew Gardner, Amnesty International\u2019s representative in Turkey, who condemned what he called \u201cthe sham trial\u201d.\n\nHe called for a U.N.-led investigation with the power to interview all suspects \u201cwhatever their level in government or position in power\u201d.\n\nIn the Riyadh trial, the suspects\u2019 lawyers have said they were duty-bound as state employees to follow orders, according to a June report by Callamard.\n\nTwo regional intelligence sources told Reuters previously that Qahtani oversaw Khashoggi\u2019s killing by giving orders via Skype to a team of security and intelligence operatives.\n\nThe CIA and some Western governments suspect Prince Mohammed, known as MbS, ordered the murder. In an interview with CBS program \u201c60 Minutes\u201d broadcast on Sunday, he denied that and called the killing a mistake, but said he ultimately bears responsibility as de facto leader.\n\nAsked specifically about Qahtani and Asiri, he said: \u201c...once charges are proven against someone, regardless of their rank, it will be taken to court, no exception made.\u201d\n\nQahtani\u2019s current location and activities are unknown.\n\nCallamard has called for senior officials including MbS and Qahtani to be investigated, and said an international criminal probe should replace the Saudi trial, which Riyadh rejects. She said the crown prince\u2019s recent remarks are aimed at rehabilitating his image.\n\nThe Trump administration has pressed Riyadh to show \u201ctangible progress\u201d toward holding to account those behind the killing before the one-year mark, a senior administration official has said.", "description": "Supporters of murdered Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi called for justice a year after his death and a U.N. investigator said Saud al-Qahtani, a key adviser to the kingdom's crown prince, should be put in the dock.", "authors": ["Dominic Evans", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436307397&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF911AM"}
