The battle over impeaching Trump is likely to drag into the 2020 presidential campaign and will become the biggest issue in key House districts.\n\nTrump and the Republicans quickly dismissed the inquiry as a political stunt designed to damage the president's reelection campaign next year, and Republican operatives note recent polls show most Americans don't want to impeach Trump despite having unfavorable views of his presidency. Trump's reelection campaign was already fundraising off Pelosi's announcement just minutes after her press conference ended.\n\n\"Democrats can't beat President Trump on his policies or stellar record of accomplishments, so they're trying to turn a Joe Biden scandal into a Trump problem,\" said Brad Pascale, Trump's campaign manager, in a statement. \"The misguided Democratic impeachment strategy is meant to appease their rabid, extreme, leftist base, but will only serve to embolden and energize President Trump's supporters and create a landslide victory for the president.\"\n\nBut Democratic outrage over Trump's alleged threat to cut off U.S. military aid to Ukraine unless officials there launched an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son convinced House Democrats from across the political spectrum to back an inquiry. Dozens of centrist and moderate Democrats have come out in support of an impeachment during the last 72 hours, convincing Pelosi and other top party leaders to back the effort.\n\nLeaving a two-hour closed-door caucus meeting, Pelosi told reporters the Ukraine controversy was a \"sea change\" for her. Earlier in the day Pelosi spoke with Trump by phone. The conversation was initially about gun control but veered into other topics including Trump urging the Ukrainian president to investigate Biden.\n\nPelosi told lawmakers that Trump said he had nothing to do with blocking the whistleblower complaint to which the speaker told him to \"undo it,\" according to sources in the room.\n\n\u201cThe president of the United States admitted that he spoke to the president of a foreign country, that would be Ukraine, about something that would assist him in his [election],\" Pelosi told reporters later. \"So that has changed everything.\u201d\n\nIn a separate closed-door meeting earlier in the afternoon, Pelosi told six key committee leaders to compile their arguments for impeachment and send them to the House Judiciary Committee, which will then review and package it all together before deciding whether to send impeachment to the House floor, according to multiple lawmakers and aides.\n\n\u201cThe other committees are going to act under an umbrella of a formal inquiry,\u201d House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal said, confirming the caucus' strategy. \u201cThe emphasis is on the term \u2018inquiry.\u2019\"\n\nBut several Democrats said there was no clear timeline for the committees to submit the evidence to Judiciary or how to proceed, fueling fears that this is an attempt by leadership to actually slow the process.\n\nPelosi\u2019s months-long effort to contain the push for impeachment crumbled this week in the face of the startling new charges of abuse of power by Trump. Pelosi, however, did not back creation of a select committee of lawmakers to centralize the impeachment probe and pluck it from the jurisdiction of the House Judiciary Committee \u2014 a demand made by some moderate Democrats.\n\nPelosi has previously expressed support for House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler's probe, which the chamber termed an \"impeachment investigation\" in a July legal filing that Pelosi signed off on.\n\nThe House will also take up a resolution Wednesday condemning Trump's alleged attempts to pressure Ukrainian officials. The resolution won't call for Trump's impeachment, although it could become the basis for such proceedings.\n\nStill, not all Democrats are happy with the current strategy. Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.), one of seven vulnerable freshman Democrats who backed impeachment hearings in an op-ed Monday night, blasted the game plan in the caucus meeting.\n\n\u201cWe came out [for an inquiry] because this is something different. This meeting did not give me confidence that this will be something different,\u201d Slotkin said, according to sources in the room. \u201cIf you are asking us to stay on message, give us a goddamn message to stay on.\u201d\n\nThe speed at which the Ukrainian scandal has unfolded has stunned lawmakers on both sides of the Capitol. Yet it was clear by Monday \u2014 when a large bloc of \"frontline\" Democratic freshmen from swing districts came out in support of an impeachment inquiry \u2014 that the momentum was building for the effort.\n\n\"I truly believe the time to begin impeachment proceedings against this president has come,\" said Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), a revered figure in the caucus and Pelosi ally whose blessing was seen as a signal that House leaders were on board. Lewis said after his remarks that he talked to Pelosi before announcing his decision.\n\nBy Tuesday morning, the number of Democrats publicly backing impeachment proceedings surged to two-thirds of the caucus, with more poised to join them by the end of the day. That includes a sharply climbing number of Democrats considered vulnerable in 2020. By Tuesday afternoon, more than half of the 44 \"frontline\" Democrats \u2014 considered the party's most vulnerable incumbents \u2014 had voiced support for impeachment proceedings.\n\n\"Having taken an oath of office before God and my fellow citizens to support and defend the Constitution of the United states, I can only conclude that Congress move forward with articles of impeachment,\" said Rep. Antonio Delgado (D-N.Y.), one of those vulnerable Democrats.\n\nThough impeachment seemed unlikely as recently as last week, Democrats were pushed to the brink amid reports that Trump used the leverage of his office to pressure Ukraine\u2019s president to interfere in the 2020 election by investigating Biden and his son Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukrainian energy firm.\n\nTrump has already acknowledged that on a July 25 call with Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, he encouraged the recently elected leader to probe Biden's involvement in the ouster of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was seen by the international community as corrupt. But Trump allies have claimed with no evidence that Biden may have acted to protect Hunter Biden.\n\nDemocrats say Trump's open solicitation of assistance in the 2020 election from a foreign leader \u2014 especially one reliant on U.S. aid in an ongoing military struggle against a Russian incursion in eastern Ukraine \u2014 is a grave abuse of power. Also outraging the party: Trump has blocked a whistleblower complaint reportedly involving his actions toward Ukraine from reaching Congress, despite laws requiring it to be shared with the Intelligence Committees.\n\nDemocratic leaders now view a House Intelligence Committee hearing on Thursday featuring Trump's top intelligence official \u2014 as well as a deadline that day for the State Department to turn over related documents potentially implicating the president and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani \u2014 as key points in the impeachment proceedings.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump said he intended to release the transcript of his call with Zelensky \u2014 but not the full whistleblower complaint \u2014 even as Democrats warned it would not fulfill their demands. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff also indicated the whistleblower was seeking to testify to Congress and is awaiting legal guidance from intelligence community officials.\n\nPelosi has been coming under increasing pressure to embrace impeachment as freshman Democrats in swing districts rethink their stance after Trump\u2019s alleged attempt to pressure Ukrainian officials in an effort to tarnish the former vice president, the frontrunner for the 2020 Democratic nomination.\n\nNadler \u2014 who has been criticized by Pelosi and some other Democrats for his handling of the panel's impeachment inquiry \u2014 declined to answer questions about the timeline or process for the newly elevated probe.\n\n\"Full speed ahead!\" Nadler told reporters following a closed-door meeting of all Democrats on Tuesday. Nadler's control of the impeachment inquiry was reaffirmed by Pelosi during the session. Yet the Judiciary Committee has struggled to sustain momentum for impeachment efforts.\n\nJudiciary Committee Democrats, for their part, have at times expressed frustration about the constraints they've faced from House leaders. Pelosi herself has refused to publicly characterize the committee's probe as an \"impeachment investigation\" up until this point, snarling the House's message as members struggled to define what they were doing.\n\nThe rise of the Ukraine issue as the tipping point for impeachment efforts is a whiplash-inducing turn after Democrats failed to garner public support for such a move in the wake of special counsel Robert Mueller's report about the Trump campaign's welcoming of Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nMueller portrayed a campaign eager to benefit from Russia's malign activity and a president eager to thwart the investigation of his allies \u2014 providing evidence of potential instances of obstruction of justice.\n\nBut Mueller's report and his public testimony in late July failed to galvanize public sentiment, even as a steady stream of Democrats cited his work to endorse impeachment proceedings.\n\nAndrew Desiderio and Sarah Ferris contributed to this report.", "description": "Nancy Pelosi said the president \u2018must be held accountable.\u2019", "authors": ["Kyle Cheney", "Heather Caygle", "John Bresnahan", "Jack Shafer"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1170833065-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
