(Rui Vieira/PA)\n\nBefore Roman Abramovich\u2019s billions turned Chelsea into Premier League contenders, many of the previous years had been a duel between Wenger\u2019s Arsenal and Ferguson\u2019s United.\n\nThe clashes between the two sides were the heavyweight contests of the season and often led to the drama spilling into the dugouts \u2013 with the overall record showing just how evenly-matched their teams often were.\n\nThe two bosses were never friends but their rivalry came to a head in 2004 when United ended Arsenal\u2019s 49-game unbeaten run.\n\nClashes outside the dressing room after the fiery contest saw pizza thrown over Ferguson, who revealed in his autobiography that the rift was not healed until after a Champions League semi-final in 2009 when Wenger congratulated his contemporary on beating the Gunners.\n\nTowards the end of his reign, Wenger said he had \u201cvery, very, very heated moments\u201d with Ferguson but now he is \u201chappy to see him\u201d as they share a glass of wine \u2013 with Ferguson presenting his former foe with a commemorative trophy on his final trip to Old Trafford.\n\nJose Mourinho \u2013 Chelsea, Manchester United\n\nP19 W2 D7 L10 F12 A29\n\nThe relationship between Wenger and Mourinho also thawed in later years. (Martin Rickett/PA)\n\nWith Wenger and Ferguson\u2019s rivalry long established, Mourinho arrived onto the scene at Stamford Bridge and upset the established order \u2013 as well as both the Arsenal and United bosses.\n\nBut it was against Wenger that Mourinho would focus plenty of his words, even during his press conference after being appointed as United manager himself last summer.\n\nThe Portuguese memorably labelled Wenger a \u201cvoyeur\u201d and a \u201cspecialist in failure\u201d, while the Arsenal boss questioned the tactics of some Mourinho sides.\n\nTheir rivalry escalated to a physical one when Wenger pushed Mourinho during a 2-0 Chelsea win in 2014, just months after his 1,000th game in charge of the Gunners saw them humbled 6-0 by Mourinho\u2019s Blues.\n\nSam Allardyce \u2013 Bolton, Newcastle, Blackburn, West Ham, Crystal Palace, Everton\n\nP 29 W 17 D 8 L 4 F 56 A 28\n\nSam Allardyce enjoyed some early success in his matches against Wenger when in charge of Bolton. (Tom Hevezi/PA)\n\nA hard-nosed manager who cut his teeth in the lower leagues, Allardyce rubbed Wenger up the wrong way \u2013 with their relationship not helped by the fact \u2018Big Sam\u2019s\u2019 Bolton became Arsenal\u2019s bogey side.\n\nBetween 2003 and 2006, Allardyce\u2019s Trotters played eight games against Arsenal and lost only once as Wenger\u2019s teams struggled to deal with the direct approach of Bolton.\n\nAllardyce said in his recent autobiography that Wenger \u201ctakes it all very personally and has an air of arrogance\u201d, while in 2003, the Bolton boss delivered a blow to Arsenal\u2019s title hopes.\n\nA big friend of Ferguson, Allardyce\u2019s side came from two goals down to draw 2-2 with the Gunners and hand the advantage in a tight title race to the Red Devils.\n\nWenger, who has since defended Allardyce after his controversial sacking from the England post, said he was \u201cscarred for life\u201d by that result \u2013 although he did not lose to an Allardyce side after 2006.\n\nTony Pulis \u2013 Stoke, Crystal Palace, West Brom\n\nP 18 W 12 D 2 L 4 F 31 A 16\n\nPulis was another manager who fell foul of some harsh words from Wenger. (Nick Potts/PA)\n\nLike with Allardyce, Pulis and Wenger were not competing for honours in the same way as his battles with Ferguson and Mourinho \u2013 the pair had issues with one another\u2019s approach to the game over the years.\n\nTheir rivalry came to a head in February 2010 when Stoke defender Ryan Shawcross broke Aaron Ramsey\u2019s leg in a tackle which Wenger labelled \u201chorrendous\u201d.\n\nWenger brandished Pulis\u2019 approach as \u201crugby\u201d tactics as the Potters often rattled Arsenal when they visited Staffordshire, with the Welshman replying that Wenger is only \u201cperceived to be a genius\u201d.\n\nPulis also defended his side\u2019s record by saying he had not had as many red cards as a manager as Wenger \u2013 but after moving on to Palace and West Brom, the pair no longer clashed, with Wenger saying his one-time nemesis \u201cmade a miracle\u201d by keeping the Eagles in the top flight during his time at Selhurst Park.", "description": "Wenger was involved in some of the most high-profile managerial feuds in the modern era .", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/06/wire-19977152-1571634853-226_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
