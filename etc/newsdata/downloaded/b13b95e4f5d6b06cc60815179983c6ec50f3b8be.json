His Virginia Neighbors May Just Elect One.", "language": "en", "text": "HERNDON, Va. \u2015 Attorney General William Barr said it\u2019s \u201cdangerous to public safety\u201d to elect progressive prosecutors who \u201cstyle themselves as \u2018social justice\u2019 reformers.\u201d Next month, his neighbors in suburban Virginia might do just that.\n\nSteve Descano is the Democratic nominee for commonwealth\u2019s attorney in Fairfax County, where Barr resides. In June\u2019s primary, Descano beat longtime incumbent Ray F. Morrogh, who had not faced a primary challenger since he was first elected in 2007. Morrogh took over the job 12 years ago from his old boss and mentor, who retired after 40 years in the position. To put it another way, just two men had served as Fairfax County prosecutor since 1967, the year the Supreme Court struck down Virginia\u2019s ban on interracial marriage.\n\nDescano will face Jonathan Fahey, an independent who has been endorsed by the Fairfax County GOP, in the general election Nov. 5 \u2015 a test of whether the progressive prosecutor movement Barr warned was taking over in \u201clarge cities\u201d can branch out to the burbs.\n\n\u201cCriminal justice reform has taken root in cities. If the movement is to grow and expand, the next step is the suburbs,\u201d Descano said in an interview with HuffPost during a day of canvassing in Herndon, Virginia. He believes his race can serve as a \u201cblueprint\u201d for the criminal justice reform movement outside of major cities.\n\n\u201cThis is the front line of criminal justice,\u201d Descano said. \u201cIf criminal justice reform succeeds in Fairfax County, it\u2019ll spread across Virginia and then it\u2019ll spread nationwide to other suburban jurisdictions.\u201d\n\nDescano has a detailed 22-page plan that lays out his priorities, which includes curtailing use of charges the come with mandatory minimums, ending the use of the death penalty, stopping the prosecution of marijuana possession cases, and directing his prosecutors not to seek cash bail.\n\nBut when knocking doors in late September, Descano\u2019s quick pitch was pretty simple: He\u2019s the Democrat, while his opponent \u201cused to work for the Trump administration.\u201d Descano\u2019s campaign has branded Fahey a \u201cTrump Lawyer\u201d because he was general counsel for the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy for seven months last year. Fahey, another former federal prosecutor, announced his run as an independent in August after Morrogh\u2019s primary defeat.\n\nBarr\u2019s August speech warned of \u201canti-law enforcement DAs\u201d emerging \u201cin jurisdictions where the election is largely determined by the primary\u201d where they \u201cambush an incumbent DA ... with misleading campaigns and large infusions of money from outside groups.\u201d\n\nFairfax County generally votes Democratic, so the primary was indeed important. And Descano\u2019s campaign got nearly a half million dollars by the Justice & Public Safety PAC, which received more than $1 million from billionaire George Soros this year.\n\nBut Descano isn\u2019t a shoo-in. Fairfax County may lean blue, but Virginia doesn\u2019t list party affiliation on the ballot for positions like commonwealth\u2019s attorney. And, in an unusual move, current Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney Morrogh also endorsed Fahey over the man who beat him in the Democratic primary, a move which led Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.) and former Gov. Terry McAuliffe to brand Morrogh a \u201csore loser.\u201d Neither Morrogh nor Fahey\u2019s campaign responded to interview requests.\n\nBarr has not formally weighed in on the race between two former federal prosecutors, and a Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment on his voting plans. Descano said he\u2019d welcome Barr\u2019s opposition.\n\n\u201cI would wear it as a badge of honor if someone like William Barr would take a swipe at me,\u201d Descano said. \u201cWe need people at every level \u2015 at the local, at the state level, at the federal level \u2015 to fight against Barr and what that administration is trying to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s taken a swing at the criminal justice reform movement,\u201d Descano said. \u201cHe may not say my name, but I know he\u2019s thinking of me when he takes that swing.\u201d\n\nRyan J. Reilly / HuffPost Steve Descano, the Democratic candidate for Fairfax County prosecutor, knocks on doors last month.\n\nMore voters are waking up to the notion that a \u201ctough on crime\u201d approach to law enforcement \u201cjust hasn\u2019t worked,\u201d argued Miriam Krinsky, founder and executive director of Fair and Just Prosecution, a nonprofit that connects progressive-leaning prosecutors across the country.\n\n\u201cThere were only two commonwealth attorneys since the mid-\u201960s on,\u201d Krinsky said. \u201cI think we\u2019re reaching a moment in time where incumbents and elected prosecutors no longer have life tenure in that job. Their feet are going to be held to the fire. The community expects more from them, and people are now more educated from data and what we\u2019ve seen about these smarter ways to think about what we prosecute, if we prosecute, what kind of accountability is appropriate to seek, and how we make communities safer in making those choices.\u201d\n\nJust because Fairfax County isn\u2019t an urban area doesn\u2019t mean voters aren\u2019t interested in the values that their justice system promotes, Krinsky said.\n\n\u201cSmart thinking is not limited to urban communities,\u201d Krinsky said. \u201cWe\u2019re not seeing these kinds of perspectives and leaders coming to office only in urban areas, or only on the coasts. It\u2019s happening across the country.\u201d\n\nFahey says he\u2019d \u201cput public safety ahead of politics,\u201d and has attacked Descano\u2019s reliance on Soros.\n\n\u201cThe agenda for these George Soros candidates is essentially to delegitimize the entire process,\u201d Fahey said on a September radio show hosted by Trump supporter John Fredericks. \u201cSaying the criminal justice system is inherently flawed and unfair and needs to be fundamentally changed ... It\u2019s part of this overall undermining of the entire system that we have, which I think is a great system we should be proud of and always work to keep improving.\u201d\n\nFahey said that \u201cnobody really even knows about the commonwealth\u2019s attorney all that much in Fairfax County\u201d because because Morrogh\u2019s office had done such a great job and the community was so safe.\n\n\u201cDo we want to go down the road of Philadelphia?\u201d Fahey asked. \u201cIs that where we want to go in Fairfax County? Because I think people in Fairfax County value our public safety.\u201d\n\nFahey\u2019s reference to Philadelphia alludes to the election of District Attorney Larry Krasner. Trump-appointed U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania William McSwain launched a highly unusual attack against Krasner in August, saying that a shooting of six Philadelphia police officers was \u201cprecipitated by a stunning disrespect for law enforcement ... promoted and championed by\u201d Krasner.\n\nUnlike Krasner, a former public defender and civil rights attorney who filed 75 suits against the Philadelphia Police Department before his election, Descano doesn\u2019t necessarily fit the profile of a criminal justice reform advocate.\n\n\u201cA West Point grad, Army officer, federal prosecutor doesn\u2019t necessarily scream \u2018reform,\u2019 right?\u201d Descano joked. But his evolution, Descano said, hasn\u2019t been as sweeping as it might seem, pointing to his roots in South Philadelphia, where he was raised in a row home by parents who didn\u2019t attend college.\n\n\u201cI got to grow up not wealthy, not privileged, at the whims of my dad\u2019s plant being closed down,\u201d he said. \u201cI came from a working-class background. I got to know people who were affected by a criminal justice system.\u201d\n\nSo when he was recruited to be part of the prestigious Attorney General\u2019s Honors Program after he got his law degree from Temple University, he says he felt drawn to consumer protection cases.\n\n\u201cI had my choice of what I wanted to do ... and the work that appealed to me was the work where the rich and powerful were taking advantage of the poor and vulnerable,\u201d Descano said.\n\nDescano is now running to represent residents of one of the richest counties in America, where he\u2019s lived for the past eight years with his wife and 8-year-old daughter. He\u2019s been endorsed by The Washington Post\u2019s editorial board, but was outraised in July and August by Fahey, who brought in nearly $103,000 compared to Descano\u2019s $52,000. Although most of Descano\u2019s money have come from that Soros-backed PAC, campaign finance reports showing Fahey received a number of donations from Justice Department employees and corporate attorneys.\n\nRyan J. Reilly / HuffPost Steve Descano campaigns in Fairfax County.\n\nIf he does win, Descano will face the challenge in taking the helm of an office that hasn\u2019t exactly rolled out the welcome mat.\n\nThree current prosecutors wrote in a letter that Descano \u201cran on a \u2018reform\u2019 platform that has taken over in cities such as Philadelphia and Chicago \u2015 jurisdictions that continue to be plagued by a level of crime we want to keep at a considerable distance.\u201d (While Philadelphia\u2019s violent crime rate dropped during Krasner\u2019s first full year in office, the homicide rate rose. But there are likely a variety of factors at play in any increase in shooting deaths: Krasner has pointed to the recent loss of a level 1 trauma center that means shooting victims have to travel further to receive care that could save their life.)\n\nThe Fairfax County prosecutors wrote that, under Descano, the office \u201cis certain to lose some if not most of its valuable, experienced prosecutors \u2015 prosecutors who\u2019ve fought hard for crime victims while striving to ensure defendants are treated fairly and respectfully.\u201d\n\nAfter the primary, Descano tried to reach out to prosecutors in the office through Morrogh, who never responded. So he sent an email to prosecutors on \u201cthe future of the office\u201d that thanked prosecutors for their \u201cdedicated service\u201d and tried to ease some of their \u201cuncertainty and trepidation\u201d about their future.\n\n\u201cI respect the hard work and dedication you have shown in service of the county and I would like to discuss your continuing to serve in the office,\u201d Descano wrote in the email to more than two dozen employees.\n\nIf elected, Descano said he plans to go in with \u201copen ears\u201d and not run the office \u201cby diktat.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you can row in the same direction as we\u2019re going, I\u2019d love to have you,\u201d Descano said. \u201cI think that a good, a great majority of the people in that office are going to be able to do that, because they are true public servants and they want to fight for safety and justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe people who don\u2019t see it that way ... I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll fit them all in the office,\u201d he said. \u201cThe criminal justice system should be reflective of the community, and when the community has spoken, and says they want certain things, it\u2019s our job as public servants to do that.\u201d", "description": "Steve Descano is running on a criminal justice reform platform in Fairfax County, which the attorney general calls home.", "authors": ["Senior Justice Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9cedaa210000290733e673.jpeg?cache=94cgm04hqn&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
