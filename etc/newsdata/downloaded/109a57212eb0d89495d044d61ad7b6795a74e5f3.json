But it could have an impact on Senate Republicans\u2019 evaluation of his fitness, and their willingness to be his firewall.\n\nFor now, I do not believe the president is in trouble. The intensity of the opposition\u2019s objection to Trump the man has always been far stronger than the persuasiveness of their case that Trump the president has committed impeachable offenses. Currently, Democrats offer nakedly partisan and unconvincing allegations of impeachable conduct; these may well be further discounted by ongoing Justice Department investigations of the Obama administration\u2019s abuse of counterintelligence powers in monitoring Trump\u2019s campaign. In a political process, if this is the state of play, the GOP-controlled Senate will give a quick back-of-the-hand to any impeachment articles voted by the Democrat-controlled House.\n\nThe landscape could change, though, if things get ugly in Syria. As we\u2019ve seen this week, the dominant narrative is that Trump is responsible for the lethal abandonment of heroic American allies. That narrative is being driven not just by Trump\u2019s opposition in the media and Democratic party but also by incensed Republicans, who supported American intervention in Syria and championed the Kurds. Things could become immeasurably worse for the president if what follows are weeks of powerful video images and on-the-ground reporting of atrocities by the Turks, and if the PKK predictably responds with terrorist attacks in Turkey that prompt Ankara to more aggression, potentially igniting a wider war.", "description": "", "authors": ["Andy Mccarthy", "Nationalreview.Com Impeachment-Process-Political-Not-Legal"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
