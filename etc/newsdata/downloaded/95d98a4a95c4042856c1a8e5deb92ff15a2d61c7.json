If clicked once, the links had the capacity to install spyware on iPhones and Android devices, the digital rights group Citizen Lab reported on Tuesday.\n\nThe hacking attempts were carried out by the same group that previously targeted Uyghur Muslims in China, according to the Citizen Lab's report. Those hacks were publicized by Google researchers last month, and TechCrunch reported that the attack was carried out by a group linked to the Chinese government.\n\nAt the time, Google researchers said the one-click hacks targeted iOS devices and that any iPhone user could be vulnerable. Apple downplayed that characterization, stating that they were already in the process of fixing exploits when Google uncovered the attacks and that only a narrow set of users were targeted.\n\nSince then, both companies have rolled out updates to iOS and Android that patched vulnerabilities to the attacks.\n\nNone of the Tibetans who clicked on malicious links were compromised because they had already downloaded the software updates protecting their devices, according to The Citizen Lab's report.\n\nThe hackers messaged targets pretending to be affiliated with nonprofit organizations like Amnesty International. Hackers claimed to be drafting human rights reports about China, and asked targets to follow links to view supposed photo and video evidence.\n\nIn another instance, a hacker pretended to be a New York Times reporter by the name of \"Lucy Leung\" asked their target to click on a link, claiming it led to a news article.\n\nResearchers observed 17 intrusion attempts against Tibetan targets, and 12 of those included one-click exploit links. In total, more than 140 people clicked on the link that led to iOS spyware, according to the report.\n\nAn Apple spokesperson highlighted the fact that users who had already downloaded the patched version of iOS were protected from hack attempts.\n\n\"Our customers' data security is one of Apple's highest priorities and we greatly value our collaboration with security researchers like Citizen Lab. The iOS issue detailed in the report had already been discovered and patched by the security team at Apple. We always encourage customers to download the latest version of iOS for the best and most current security enhancements,\" the Apple spokesperson said in a statement to Business Insider.\n\nA Google spokesperson could not be immediately reached for comment.", "description": "Hackers targeted Tibetan leaders in an attempt to monitor their devices with spyware throughout the past two years, according to a new report.", "authors": ["Aaron Holmes"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8a38c92e22af42ca5145d6-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
