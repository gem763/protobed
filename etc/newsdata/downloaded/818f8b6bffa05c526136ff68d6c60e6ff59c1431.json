And that halt must start with a final say vote on Brexit, the only way to drain the poison from our national conversation.\n\nWe have seen already what permissive leadership can unleash. He might not have said the words himself, but the calls of \u201cSend Her Back\u201d echoing around Donald Trump\u2019s speeches did not surprise him, it didn\u2019t throw him off. He didn\u2019t halt his speech and admonish the crowd. He bathed in the warm glow of the hate he had unleashed.\n\nAnyone who tells you that sort of thing can\u2019t happen here, really, really needs to take a closer look at just what is going on right here, right now.\n\nWe have a prime minister who has bluffed his way into Downing Street, openly lying to the public, about practically everything, but most pertinently about the big issue of the day \u2013 Brexit. He made no attempt to use his honeymoon period to win over new support for his approach. In fact he went the other way.\n\nHe has moved to close down parliament, close down scrutiny, and close down the voices of democratically elected representatives. It doesn\u2019t have to be a military coup to be dangerous. It doesn\u2019t have to be unprecedented to be unacceptable. It doesn\u2019t have to be illegal to be unethical. The warning signs for our country are flashing a burning, urgent red.\n\nAnd yet Johnson remains the most popular realistic choice as prime minister. He can do these monstrous things because he knows most people are fed up with politicians. No matter how good a job Laura Kuenssberg does of explaining it on the news \u2013 the technicalities of this amendment or that motion or the shock of parliament being prorogued \u2013 all it does is make this about procedure when it should be about people.\n\nMost people are so bored with Brexit, they want us to get on with it so badly, and they don\u2019t really even care what the \u201cit\u201d is anymore. But still every time a Tory MP parrots this line about getting on with it, that is just a further lie.\n\nNo deal is not the ripping off of a plaster that it is presented as. It is not the end, only another beginning. And it is the beginning of tortuous, painful process that will drain all of our national attention for many, many years.\n\nTrade deals will need to be done, the handling of the Irish Border will still need to be sorted, how we get our medicines, staff for our NHS, who we buy what from when, where we can and can\u2019t travel with ease. These questions don\u2019t go away because Boris Johnson did a hard man routine to make Nigel Farage like him.\n\nOn that point, a recent poll showed that young people are more and more inclined towards a so called \u201cstrongman\u201d leader, and less and less bothered about democracy. We are sleepwalking to disaster here.\n\nIt is no use saying that Boris did this and that as Mayor of London, that he\u2019s actually a liberal, one-nation Tory really. This prime minister will wear any clothes that fit, and right now causing chaos, spreading fear, and fostering hate strengthens his hand. We are growing our own Berlusconi, and time is short to put an end to this descent into a populist benevolent dictatorship. We have to draw a line in the sand.\n\nThe last thing I\u2019m ever going to do is point the finger and blame anyone else \u2013 this is a political crisis made by politicians. I know that. It is no coincidence that Boris\u2019s big gamble came just the day after leaders of opposition parties from across parliament finally came together to plan a better outcome for the country.\n\nBut it is going to take more than politicians to bring the country back together. The people have to be part of this, because if they aren\u2019t, the establishment politicians \u2013 who pose with pints and patronisingly pretend they are down with the normal folk \u2013 will simply trot out a line about \u201can establishment stitch up\u201d and blame migration somehow. If they love the people so much surely we should let them have a say in how we settle this division.\n\nThe good news is, it\u2019s not too late to fight back. The demonstrations across the UK that have sprung up since Boris Johnson announced his plan to suspend parliament have been inspiring, a spontaneous show of force from people who remember the sacrifices made to secure our democratic rights. And on 19 October, the People\u2019s Vote campaign is organising a march on parliament that has the potential to be one of the largest political demonstrations in British history. The last one, in March, saw around a million people take to the streets. Now, the crisis facing our country is even more urgent.\n\nI\u2019ll be accused of hyperbole, the sexist commentators will call me shrill and hysterical as if I\u2019m worried about a dictatorship and division because I\u2019m on my period. The shutting of parliament to enable one man to win a game is dangerous: where does it end? One thing I\u2019m sure of is if we let this pass without a fight, it will happen again and again, and we will end up with a strongman leader who you can guarantee won\u2019t even get the trains to run on time.", "description": "We are living in dangerous times.
