Give up or fight back? The BA customer chose the latter option and got in touch with our Consumer Fight Back columnist Helen Dewdney for advice \u2013 and this is what happened next.\n\nA BA customer was refused a refund for the reservation of particular seats after she cancelled\n\nTracy who writes for the money saving travel blog Mind over Money Matters planned a luxury trip and researched ways to save money on various areas of the trip. This included booking two flights, for her and her husband, Taz, to San Francisco for April 2020, using Avios points.\n\nThis was both to save \u00a31,000's and because you can cancel or amend bookings and get fully refunded (less a small fee) up to 24 hours before the flight.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the case when you book directly with most airlines, you\u2019ll get just the taxes back.\n\nTracy booked business class flights on the A380, a double decker plane. She immediately pre-booked the seats, upstairs for the outward flight and downstairs to come back in one of the \u2018together\u2019 seats, which converts to a double bed, at a cost of \u00a3386.\n\nUnfortunately, due to unforeseen circumstances, the flights had to be cancelled and she had to ask for a refund. However, she then discovered that the seat bookings were non-refundable.\n\nBA told her that she had signed the terms and conditions when she booked the seats. She tried by phone, online and on Twitter but got the same response. After six weeks she had got nowhere, so Tracy got in touch with me got help.\n\nAre BA\u2019s terms unfair?\n\nI read the BA booking terms and conditions and thought they were unfair. The Consumer Rights Act 2015 creates a \u2018fairness test\u2019 to stop consumers being put at an unfair advantage.\n\nIt would be considered unfair if something tilts the rights and responsibilities in favour of the trader.\n\nAlso, it may be considered a breach of The Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008. Under these regulations a practice would be considered unfair if it harmed, or was likely to harm the economic interests of the average consumer.\n\nThis protects a consumer from making a purchasing decision they would not have made had they been given accurate information, or not put under unfair pressure to do so.\n\nIt could be that a court would consider that someone is put under unfair pressure if they have no alternative but to agree to the terms and conditions.\n\nBA said the pre-booked seats Tracy had to cancel were non refundable, leaving her down \u00a3386\n\nI advised Tracy to go straight to the top and write to the British Airways CEO, quoting the laws and her belief that they were in breach.\n\nShe got a standard email back that said \u2018Pre-booked seats are non-refundable\u2019 with no reference to her reasons. This made me quite cross. So, I advised her to write back changing the subject line to \u2018email before action\u2019 and saying the same as before.\n\nThat got Tracy a call from the CEO\u2019s office. She said she had a friendly discussion but still the representative would not budge. He appeared to have never heard of the consumer laws, incidentally, saying \u2018I don\u2019t know anything about that\u2019.\n\nShe even said she would be happy to change the pre-booking to the new flights, but he said that this would not be possible. That is quite clearly just profiteering.\n\nReally quite cross now, I told Tracy that the only options open to her were either to let it go, or to test it in court. It is important to note that no-one has yet taken a travel company to court for refunds of a seat booking charge, so it would set a precedent either way.\n\nI was delighted that Tracy chose to go to court. She submitted her claim through HM Courts & Tribunals Money Claim Online service.\n\nBritish Airways notified the court of its intention to fight the claim. Hurrah!\n\nPersistence pays off\n\nThe case was filed 12 August 2019. Tracy received notification on 28 August from the court that BA intended to defend the case.\n\nBut then the following day she received an email from BA to say: \u2018As previously explained, pre-booked seats are non-refundable as per the terms and conditions.\n\n'The terms of the contract were clearly set out and there was no breach of contract or any other legal course of action which would enable you to recover the amount for the pre-booking. As such BA is not liable to pay any sum to you and liability for your court claim is denied.\n\n'However, BA does not wish to remain in dispute with you and on this occasion only, BA has raised the amount of \u00a3386 to be sent to you by way of cheque in full and final settlement of your claim. This will put you back in the position that you were in before the payment for the seats was made.\n\n'Please note that this is a goodwill gesture and does not reflect the legal position.\u2019\n\nThis out-of-court settlement was a great result, eventually.\n\nTracy received the cheque on 1 September 2019.\n\nI asked BA for a statement regarding this case. Why did it say it would defend the case and then decide to pay out?\n\nA spokesperson for BA said: \u2018It clearly states in our terms and conditions, which a customer must agree to before booking, that a refund is not due for pre-booked seating if they choose to cancel their flight. On this occasion, we offered our customer a gesture of goodwill.\u2019\n\nI tried several times to get a statement about BA\u2019s change of mind on defending the case in court but it just repeated its statement above.\n\nTracy said: \u2018BA have the worst customer service ever. They must be trained to ignore and frustrate customers until we give up. This was about the principle \u2013 how could I not be refunded for something that didn\u2019t exist anymore?\u2019\n\nPaying for booking seats in this way has still to be tested in court. But it does show that it IS worth trying to get the refund and even going as far as starting on small claims court action.\n\nYou\u2019ll either get a refund or make your mark in setting a legal precedent.\n\nWhat about paying to sit together?\n\nOn a similar note, many of us have faced the \u2018Do I pay to sit my family together on the plane or risk it?\u2019\n\nI recently had a run in with Tui who said I had to pay to sit my family together to guarantee it. I quoted regulations at them, yet they still tried to charge me.\n\nI explained the EU regulations about the seating of children and the CAA statement on the issue. I didn\u2019t pay to sit my family together. But that story is for another day.\n\nIt just goes to show that sometimes you really need to persist to get the outcome you want. Companies will often try to fob you off. How many people have been caught like this and how much additional profit are these companies making through these unfair charges?\n\nAlways challenge, using these ten easy steps to get results and if you still need help please contact me!", "description": "A BA customer who paid the equivalent of thousands of pounds in Avios points was refused a refund for the \u00a3386 she spent reserving seats when she had to cancel her flights.", "authors": ["Helen Dewdney For This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
