It could even fall below zero,\" he said.\n\nThe median economists forecast polled by Reuters is a rise of 145,000 in September.\n\nHeightened worries about the U.S. service sector increased expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at the end of this month, undermining the dollar's yield advantage.\n\nFed funds rate futures are almost fully pricing in a 25 basis point rate cut and a high chance of another cut by December.\n\nBut some market players think rate cuts are far from a done deal.\n\n\"Opinions in markets over whether the Fed needs to cut rates that much are divided. The dollar is not going to fall sharply given not everyone thinks the Fed will cut rates this month,\" said Kazushige Kaida, forex manager at State Street.\n\nElsewhere, sterling traded at $1.2333, having risen to one-week high of $1.2413 on Thursday after the head of a group of eurosceptic lawmakers in Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative Party said the government's latest Brexit proposals offered the possibility of a \"tolerable deal.\"\n\nStill, traders remained unsure whether Johnson's proposal to replace the Irish border \"backstop\" was going to morph into a final Brexit divorce agreement due to mixed messages coming from both sides.
