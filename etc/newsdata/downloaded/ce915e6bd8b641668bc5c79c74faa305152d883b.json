Gilbert Carrasquillo\n\nMr Farrow won a Pulitzer Prize for public service for his investigation into Mr Weinstein, published in the The New Yorker in 2017.\n\nLast week, the book was available on the online retail giant\u2019s US store, but not the Australian one, with observers pointing to this country's much more onerous defamation laws. However, on Sunday, the book was available on Amazon Australia, in Kindle, audiobook, paperback and hardcover versions.\n\nAmazon declined to comment. Booktopia also decided to not sell the book and on Sunday it still remained unavailable. Many smaller bricks and mortar book shops received the legal threats, but pushed ahead with making it available last week anyway. Mr Howard's Australian lawyer, Andrew Thorpe, did not have a comment about Amazon's change when contacted on Sunday.", "description": "Amazon has now quietly made Ronan Farrow's blockbuster available in its Australian store.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6003%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_128%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/4eb2876cb7be4a9a6443c7bfc2001f8d34e709c1", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
