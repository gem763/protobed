Following a series of ordeals at the hands of rapist Laurie (Kyle Pryor), she was faced with a deadly dilemma when she stumbled upon twins whom she believed to be her own, and subsequently set about arranging a plan to kidnap them. In spite of her harrowing year, Brody (Adam Woodward) was with her every step of the way \u2014 that is, until he discovered that she knew about Maxine (Nikki Sanderson) faking her illness and did nothing.\n\nWith Liberty (Jessamy Stoddart) pregnant with their child, Brody and Sienna should be over the moon, but the animosity between them is proving rather difficult for everyone involved \u2014 especially Liberty. In the coming episodes, Liberty asks Brody if he could come to the scan alongside both her and Sienna, but \u2014 after giving it some thought \u2014 he ultimately decides not to.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFed up with the atmosphere, Liberty asks Sienna to apologise to Brody and put their feud aside for the sake of the baby. It takes quite a bit of persuasion, but Sienna ultimately agrees to do so.\n\nHowever, when she heads round to The Love Boat, she\u2019s left heartbroken, as she discovers Brody and Cindy (Stephanie Waring) together \u2014 and sparks are certainly flying between the pair.\n\nAfterwards, a devastated Sienna informs Liberty that she doesn\u2019t want to have a baby without Brody and thus she begins to pack her bags.\n\nWill Sienna leave the village?\n\nHollyoaks continues Friday 10th October at 7pm on E4.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Sienna is left devastated by what she sees.", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Sienna-Hollyoaks-4cc7_1570727232.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
