Police responded with tear gas.\n\nThe violence tarnished an otherwise peaceful march that brought thousands of people, including some yellow vests, onto the streets, a day after marches in Paris and other cities worldwide to demand government action against climate change.\n\nDemonstrators carried slogans like \u201cEnd oil now\u201d and \u201cEnd of the world\u201d while some held carnival effigies, including one of President Emmanuel Macron wearing a crown marked \u201cKing of bla-bla\u201d.\n\nThe yellow vests, named after motorists\u2019 high-visibility jackets, were holding a 45th consecutive Saturday of action. The movement emerged late last year, triggered by fuel tax rises and swelling into a revolt against Macron\u2019s style of government.\n\nSome of their protests have been marked by rioting, partly blamed on black blocs.\n\nSlideshow (6 Images)\n\nA separate march on Saturday was called by the FO trade union to contest the government\u2019s planned overhaul of France\u2019s retirement system. The proposed reform prompted a strike by metro workers on Sept. 13, shutting most of the underground network.\n\nThe authorities have also been taking precautions so protesters do not disrupt an annual heritage event this weekend that gives the public special access to many historic sites.\n\nSome sites like the Arc de Triomphe monument have been closed while others like the Elysee presidential palace have required visitors to register in advance.", "description": "French police fired tear gas and made over a hundred arrests in Paris on Saturday as they dispersed \"yellow vest\" protesters attempting unauthorized rallies and black-masked demonstrators who disrupted a climate march.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190921&t=2&i=1432317124&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8K0B6", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
