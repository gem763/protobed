So, at the moment, we are at that stage.\u201d\n\nTrump and His Team Send Clashing Messages on U.S. Troops in Afghanistan\n\n\u201cI think throughout this process we\u2019ve seen the U.S. and Zalmay get a little over his skis when it comes to things like negotiation details or a timeline for withdrawal or in this case announcing the deal being agreed upon in principle,\u201d said one former U.S. official familiar with the details of the ongoing talks in Doha. \u201cIt isn\u2019t over and done until Trump says it is and as we know the president\u2019s thoughts on big deals like this often change at the last minute.\"\n\nMeanwhile, inside the White House, senior Trump officials are discussing last minute details of the Khalilzad-negotiated deal, according to two officials with knowledge of those conversation. Those discussions have focused in part on how to continue to support the Afghan security forces throughout the withdrawal process, those sources said.\n\nBut the longer the talks go on, the clearer it is that the Taliban have the final say. They know Trump is desperate to leave, and they are determined not only to remain a power in their country, but to re-establish what they call the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cThe Taliban have been rather rude with the U.S. throughout the peace process because they have the impression that a withdrawal deal is a desperate desire of the USA, not the Taliban,\u201d says a senior European diplomat in Kabul. \u201cImagine how rudely and offensively the Taliban will treat the already upset and isolated President [Ashraf] Ghani.\u201d\n\nPresumably there will be some agreement in the not too distant future as the Taliban give Trump enough concessions to save face, but they know what they call the \u201cevacuation\u201d of all American forces, whether in uniform or as covert or contract operatives, will demoralize the U.S.-backed regime in Kabul and especially the Afghan military and security forces. These local soldiers and police, after 17 years and tens of thousands of casualties in their ranks, still remain largely dependent on American support, especially from the air.\n\nThere are many precedents indicating what to expect when such dependent troops see their patrons abandoning them. Typically, large numbers lose the will to fight and they flee, surrender, or change sides.\n\nSuch was the case after peace talks with Hanoi allowed Richard Nixon political cover to withdraw all American combat troops by the end of 1973 only to see Saigon fall to North Vietnam in the spring of 1975, less than two years later.\n\nWhen the Israelis were ending their occupation of South Lebanon in 2000 they quickly discovered that the militias they created and armed there were selling them out and forging covert alliances with their enemy.\n\nAlready, Taliban sources tell The Daily Beast they are looking at what Afghan military units\u2014perhaps entire bases\u2014are most likely to come over to their side as the Americans withdraw.\n\nAt present the U.S. has only 14,000 uniformed troops left in the country. It invaded in 2001 following the September 11 attacks on New York and Washington by al-Qaeda, which operated out of Afghanistan with Taliban protection. By 2010 under President Barack Obama there were 100,000 U.S. troops on the ground as well as contingents from NATO allies. But Obama had brought the American presence down to 8,400 by the time he left office\u2014slightly fewer than the number of troops Trump mentioned in his latest public peroration on the subject.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going down to 8,600 and then we make a determination from there as to what happens,\u201d Trump told Fox News Radio last week. Obviously aware how unsatisfying such arrangements are for supporters who want a definitive end to America\u2019s longest war, Trump also repeated his thought that the U.S. could win that war \u201cso fast, if I wanted to kill 10 million people ... which I don\u2019t.\u201d", "description": "EVGENIA NOVOZHENINA/ReutersDOHA, Qatar\u2014The American negotiator trying to cut a deal with the Taliban that might let Donald Trump get all uniformed troops out of Afghanistan before next year\u2019s election says that the two sides have an \u201cagreement in principle.\u201dBut Taliban officials and diplomats here in", "authors": ["Sami Yousafzai Erin.Banco Thedailybeast.Com", "Erin Banco", "Christopher.Dickey Thedailybeast.Com", "Christopher Dickey"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/E_SliWMzLByhVCeyyDiuqQ--~B/aD02NTg7dz0xMTcwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/267c72ff05029303a8f5f3c8a8ee05f9", "published_at": "2019-09-03"}
