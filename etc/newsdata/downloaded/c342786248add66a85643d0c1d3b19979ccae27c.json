Reported reason: According to a tweet, President Trump said Acosta resigned over ongoing controversy surrounding Acosta\u2019s handling of an investigation into Jeffrey Epstein in 2008. \u201cHe felt the constant drumbeat of press about a prosecution which took place under his watch more than 12 years ago was bad for the Administration, which he so strongly believes in, and he graciously tendered his resignation ...,\u201d Trump wrote.\n\nPhoto: Chip Somodevilla, Getty Images\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders\n\nRole: White House Press Secretary Date: Resigned in June 2019.
