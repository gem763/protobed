Authorities said they found nearly 300 animals living at the operations in Texas and Missouri, but that many of the animals had to be euthanized because of poor health.\n\nTiffany Woodington, 49, is charged in Missouri with 10 counts of felony animal abuse and two misdemeanor counts of animal abuse. Her husband, Steven Woodington, 55, is charged in Texas with 19 counts of animal cruelty. A second man described as the caretaker also was charged in Texas with animal cruelty. All three are free on bond. No attorney is listed for Tiffany Woodington in online court records and she doesn\u2019t have a listed number.\n\nCameron County, Texas, Sheriff Omar Lucio said Tuesday that authorities discovered about 270 animals \u2014 about two dozen of them dead \u2014 on property in the small community of Los Fresnos, which is north of Brownsville in the far southern part of the state. They were found Sept. 9 after authorities received complaints from neighbors about barking dogs, according to Lucio and Cameron County prosecutor Edward Sandoval. Deputies found many of the dogs covered in feces and urine, with two or three of them packed together in each cage. Authorities estimated that more than half of the Texas dogs wouldn\u2019t survive or would have to be euthanized.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

It\u2019s staggering, it\u2019s staggering to the imagination.\u201d\n\nPaul Fourt Jr., the attorney for Steven Woodington, said his client intends to plead not guilty to the charges. \u201cHe was at all times trying to rescue and save those animals,\u201d Fourt said, explaining that Woodington intended to also send the dogs to shelters in Kansas and Oklahoma so that they could ultimately be adopted. Fourt indicated that others were responsible for their mistreatment.\n\nThe Benton County Sheriff\u2019s Office said Steven Woodington was transporting the animals to Cole Camp, Missouri, which is about 90 miles (145 kilometers) southeast of Kansas City. Law enforcement went to a property there, where Tiffany Woodington led them to an old school bus, a barn and a house. The Benton County Sheriff\u2019s Office said it found about 120 dead dogs and a dead cat in \u201cvarious stages of decay, some were just bones\u201d on Sept. 12. Benton County Sheriff Eric Knox said some of the animals died in the same cages, making it difficult to get an exact count.\n\nAuthorities also found 38 dogs and one cat \u201calive but in unimaginable conditions.\u201d Tiffany Woodington had moved some of them to another location in the area, a sheriff\u2019s sergeant wrote in a report. Tiffany Woodington told authorities that the dogs died of distemper and all within a three-day span. She was asked why she didn\u2019t seek help and \u201cshe did not have answer other than it just happened so fast,\u201d according to the report.\n\nJeane Jae, a spokeswoman for the Humane Society of Missouri, said the surviving animals, which are in its care, were matted and skinny. \u201cIt is going to take a long time to rehabilitate these animals,\u201d she said, adding that one dog and one cat found in Missouri had to be euthanized for medical reasons.\n\nKnox said he had heard \u201cnot a word\u201d about problems before the dead animals were found, even though the nearest neighbor lived about 500 feet (152 meters) away.\n\n\u201cIt really surprises me that no one in the community said, \u2018You better check that lady out.\u2019 And the smell, as soon as I drove up, I could smell it,\u201d he said. \u201cI am a dog lover, and I struggle with it.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Tiffany and Steven Woodington operated All Accounted For, which brought animals from Texas to Missouri, the Sheriff's Office said", "authors": ["Heather Hollingsworth", "David Warren"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/animal-rescue-dead-dogs-texas.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
