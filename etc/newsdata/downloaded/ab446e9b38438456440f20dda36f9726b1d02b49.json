Even the capital's more combustible suburbs were calmer.\n\n- Focus and leadership lacking -\n\nThe violence in Chile, usually one of the most stable countries in Latin America, is the worst experienced since returning to democracy after the 1973-1990 right-wing dictatorship led by General Augusto Pinochet.\n\nBut the protests lack a clear focus or recognizable leadership.\n\n\"This is the whole country's complaint. We're fed up,\" shouted one demonstrator over the din of pots and pans being banged in front of soldiers in Santiago.\n\nIn an address to the nation late on Tuesday, Pinera apologized for failing to anticipate the outbreak of social unrest and announced a raft of measures aimed at placating demonstrators.\n\nHe promised to increase the universal basic pension and minimum wage, cut public sector salaries and cancel a recent hike in electricity bills.\n\nForeign Minister Teodoro Ribera told reporters next month's APEC trade summit would go ahead despite the protests.\n\nUS President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping are among those expected to attend the November 16-17 meeting to discuss ending their trade war.\n\nIn Paraguay, South American football's governing body CONMEBOL said the November 23 final of the Copa Libertadores -- the continent's equivalent of Europe's Champions League -- between champions River Plate of Argentina and Brazilian giants Flamengo would take place as planned in Santiago.\n\nRibera also said the capital would still host December's climate change conference Cop 25.", "description": "The United Nations said Thursday it would send a special mission to investigate human rights abuses in Chile, where a general strike went into its second day following a week of street protests that left 19 dead.
