The company said these changes include \u201cruthlessly prioritising, and always holding ourselves accountable to a high bar of performance and agility.\u201d It made this announcement in the midst of Apple\u2019s iPhone 11 keynote event.\n\nAccording to TechCrunch, which first reported the news, the layoffs coincide with the company lifting a hiring freeze it set in place in August.\n\nGenerally, the proof that a hiring freeze has ended is evidenced by employing new people rather than tossing several hundred old ones out on their asses.\n\nIn fact, Uber said earlier this week that it plans to hire 2,000 employees in its Chicago office \u2014 but most of those new hires will work for Uber Freight, the company\u2019s trucking division, which was reportedly not impacted by today\u2019s layoffs.\n\nNews of the layoffs comes as California lawmakers ready to vote on legislation, called AB5, that would likely require Uber and other gig work companies to classify drivers as employees instead of independent contractors.\n\nUber and competitor Lyft have campaigned heavily against the bill, which is expected to pass into law, and it is widely expected to hurt their ability to make a profit \u2014 something neither company has done to date.\n\nMeanwhile, Uber\u2019s stock price has continued to drop.", "description": "Uber has laid off 265 engineers and 170 members of its product team because it is a successful company based on sound financials that is not badly in need of a drastic overhaul....", "authors": ["Tegan Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/tdw7zokepshxkqdedcwc.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
