Yahoo Entertainment has confirmed that the 33-year-old Jersey Shore star was taken into custody and charged with kidnapping. Ortiz-Magro posted bail Friday, which was set at $100,000, and was released.\n\nAccording to TMZ, Ortiz-Magro and Harley \u2014 who have a volatile history \u2014 got into a heated argument at an Airbnb they are renting in Los Angeles. The reality star allegedly slapped and punched Harley before she went running out of the house screaming for help. Ortiz-Magro then allegedly chased after her with a knife demanding she return inside \u2014 as he held their 18-month-old daughter, Ariana Sky. Ortiz-Magro eventually dropped the knife and locked himself and Ariana inside before police arrived. Authorities reportedly broke down the door fearing for Ariana's safety. Police eventually tasered Ortiz-Magro as he would not peacefully cooperate. Law enforcement sources tell TMZ that Harley told police Ortiz-Magro had been doing cocaine.\n\nSANTA MONICA, CA - JUNE 16: TV personality Ronnie Ortiz-Magro attends the 2018 MTV Movie And TV Awards at Barker Hangar on June 16, 2018 in Santa Monica, California.

Ortiz-Magro's manager did not immediately respond to Yahoo Entertainment's request for comment.\n\nA Fox Los Angeles reporter, who broke the story, shared a photo of Ortiz-Magro shirtless and handcuffed on a stretcher at 3 a.m. \"Woman reported being assaulted + that Ortiz had her baby inside home,\" Gigi Graciette tweeted. \"Police say he wouldn\u2019t come out so they broke down door to rescue baby.\"\n\nEXCLUSIVE:\n\nJersey Shore\u2019s Ronnie Ortiz in handcuffs after 3am domestic violence incident.

Officers deployed the taser on the suspect (minor use of force). There was a child at the location. The child was unharmed. The suspect was arrested for domestic violence.\"\n\nWhile Harley suffered no major injuries, TMZ reports she had visible marks on her face.\n\nThis is just the latest altercation in a string of disturbing incidents between Harley and Ortiz-Magro, who have both accused each other of infidelity and violence. In July, Harley was cleared of domestic battery after an allegedly violent fight on New Year's Eve. Friday's alleged domestic violence incident comes hours after Harley and Ortiz-Magro declared they were back together.\n\nOn Thursday\u2019s episode of Jersey Shore: Family Vacation, Harley questioned her on-again, off-again boyfriend\u2019s sobriety, which irritated Ortiz-Magro. The reality star completed a 30-day rehab program for alcohol abuse earlier this year.\n\n\"I was making wrong decisions and I was very depressed,\" he told Us Weekly after treatment. \"When I was depressed I would turn to drinking and when I would drink, bad things would just continue to happen because I wasn\u2019t reacting the way I should.\"\n\nHe continued, \"I decided to go to treatment because I wanted to be a better person, a better father for my daughter. Eventually, all the bad decisions I was making were going to lead me to places that I didn\u2019t want to be. I wanted to be led to the place that I am now \u2013 that\u2019s happy, healthy and the best role model for my daughter.\"\n\n[Editor\u2019s note: This post has been updated to reflect Ortiz-Magro\u2019s release.]\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:\n\nWant daily pop culture news delivered to your inbox?
