Make sure you\u2019re actually tired\n\nIt sounds obvious, but it\u2019s much easier to sleep at night if you\u2019re ready for bed. However, night owls in particular often find it hard to doze off at what others consider a \u201cnormal\u201d bedtime. If this sounds like you, try to expose yourself to as much natural light as possible during the day \u2013 starting as soon as you wake. Scientists have shown that this can help night owls to train their internal body clocks (AKA circadian rhythms) to be ready for sleep earlier.\n\nGetting enough exercise during the day is important, too; but avoid exercising during the four hours before bed, as the resulting adrenaline may keep you awake. And unless you\u2019re a toddler, try to avoid daytime naps. These can help if you\u2019re particularly short on sleep, but in general, sleeping during the day \u2013 especially after 4pm \u2013 can make you less likely to drop off at night.\n\n2. Pay attention to what you eat and drink\n\nThe journey to good sleep starts long before bedtime \u2013 around six hours beforehand, in fact, when you should enjoy your very last caffeinated beverage of the day. Caffeine can stay in your system for up to nine hours, so if you\u2019re serious about getting a good night\u2019s sleep, consider cutting out tea, coffee and fizzy drinks after 12 noon.\n\nMost people find it hard to sleep on an empty stomach, but going to bed full to busting can have similarly poor outcomes for sleep. If you can, have dinner around four hours before bedtime, avoiding anything heavy (which could prevent you from sleeping) or sugary (which could make you wake in the night).", "description": "Tried-and-tested tips for good sleep hygiene, from bedtime rituals to late-night listening", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p07r60lc.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
