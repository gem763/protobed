Two economists investigated the relationship with the regulatory burden and corruption.\n\nEmpirical studies such as Meon and Sekkat (2005) and De Rosa et al. (2010) show that corruption is more damaging for economic performance at higher levels of regulation or lower levels of governance quality. \u2026Building on the above literature, in this paper, we use firm-level survey data on 39,732 firms in 111 countries collected by the World Bank\u2019s Enterprise Surveys between 2009 and 2017 to test the hypothesis that corruption impedes firm productivity more at higher levels of regulation. \u2026estimate the model using sample weighted OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) regression analysis.\n\nAnd what did they discover?\n\nWe find that the negative relationship between corruption and productivity is amplified at high levels of regulation. In fact, at low levels of regulation, the relationship between corruption and productivity is insignificant. \u2026we find that a 1 percent increase in bribes that firms pay to get things done, expressed as the share of annual sales, is significantly associated with about a 0.9 percent decrease in productivity of firms at the 75th percentile value of regulation (high regulation). In contrast, at the 25th percentile value of regulation (low regulation), the corresponding change is very small and statistically insignificant, though it is still negative. \u2026after we control for investment, skills and raw materials, the coefficients of the interaction term between corruption and regulation became much larger\u2026 This provides support for the hypothesis that corruption is more damaging for productivity at higher levels of regulation.\n\nLord Acton famously wrote that \u201cpower corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.\u201d\n\nBased on the results from the World Bank study, we can say \u201cregulation corrupts, and added regulation corrupts additionally.\u201d\n\nNot very poetic, but definitely accurate.\n\nFigure 4 from the study shows this relationship.\n\nSeems like we need separation of business and state, not just separation of church and state.\n\nThis gives me a good excuse to recycle this video I narrated more than 10 years ago.\n\nP.S. Five years ago, I cited a World Bank study showing that tax complexity facilitates corruption. Which means a simple and fair flat tax isn\u2019t merely a way of achieving more prosperity, it\u2019s also a way of draining the swamp.\n\nThe moral of the story \u2013 whether we\u2019re looking at red tape, taxes, spending, trade, or any other issue \u2013 is that smaller government is the most effective way of reducing sleaze and corruption.", "description": "When\u00a0I wrote last month about the Green New Deal, I .09/02/2019 3:17:11AM EST.", "authors": ["Daniel J.
