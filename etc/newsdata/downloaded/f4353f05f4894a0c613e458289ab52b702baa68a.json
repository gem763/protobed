REUTERS/Jason Lee\n\nThe step underscores how Chinese government and party authorities are growing more deeply integrated into the private sector, as its economy sputters amid an intensifying trade war with the United States.\n\nThe city of Hangzhou, home to Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N), will designate government officials to work with 100 local companies in the eastern province of Zhejiang, the local government said on its website.\n\nThe directives, presented as a means to boost the local manufacturing industry, did not name the 100 companies subject to the policy, but state media reports said Alibaba and auto maker Zhejiang Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd [GEELY.UL] would be among the companies.\n\nAlibaba said the plan would not interfere with its operations.\n\n\u201cWe understand this initiative... aims to foster a better business environment in support of Hangzhou-based enterprises. The government representative will function as a bridge to the private sector, and will not interfere with the company\u2019s operations,\u201d Alibaba said in a statement.\n\nGeely did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nChinese law has long required private companies, including foreign entities, to establish formal party organizations.\n\nSuch groups were once seen as largely symbolic. However, in recent years, foreign executives have said here they have come under increasing pressure to allow party representatives more sway over business operations.\n\nDomestic companies have strengthened party committees as well. In 2018, dozens of Chinese banks announced changes to their articles of association, granting more power to party committees.", "description": "China's top technology hub Hangzhou plans to assign government officials to work with 100 private companies including e-commerce giant Alibaba, according to state media reports, in a move likely to raise concerns over the growing role of the state.", "authors": ["Josh Horwitz", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1432846474&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M0BP", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
