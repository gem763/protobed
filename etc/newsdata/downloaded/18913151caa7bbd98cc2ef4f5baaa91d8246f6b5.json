For years, Tripoli has been plagued by a reputation for violence and radicalism, often used as a byword for the country\u2019s sectarian ills.\n\nIt might appear from the outside that a dramatic change has taken place. But for residents here, the story of these demonstrations is not one of transformation, but of a city showing its true face to the world.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

I always thought people would come together, they just needed a reason.\u201d\n\nIn Tripoli, a coastal city of more than 700,000 people in northern Lebanon, the reasons abound. Huge protests erupted across the country last week after the government announced a tax on the popular messaging service WhatsApp \u2013 a proposal that was quickly cancelled. But the deeper causes have been building for years.\n\nDecades of widespread corruption and economic mismanagement by Lebanon\u2019s leaders have brought it to the brink of financial collapse. It is one of the most indebted countries, jobs are scarce, prices are rising and basic services such as electricity and water are intermittent.\n\nThese underlying causes of the protests are more acute in Tripoli than anywhere else. The city lies in the poorest region of Lebanon \u2013 some 57 per cent of its population lives in poverty. In the most deprived suburbs, nearly two thirds of people are unemployed.\n\n\u201cThe middle class just doesn\u2019t exist any more in Tripoli,\u201d says Rene Charkass, a 24-year-old sports journalist, who has been protesting every day.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

We pay electricity twice, water twice, there are no social services. Many families can\u2019t afford food, education or medical treatment.\n\n\u201cThe people here are tired.\u201d\n\nYoung people growing up in the city, who make up a large contingent of protesters in the square, are afraid there will be no jobs for them once they leave school.\n\n\u201cEveryone here is poor \u2013 people are searching for work every day but there is nothing,\u201d says 16-year-old Kareem Shlaylat, an IT student, as he watches the protests from the fourth floor of an abandoned building overlooking the square.\n\n\u201cIt feels like the politicians help each other but don\u2019t help poor people. I want the politicians to go away and for us to have new people who can be trusted.\u201d\n\nThe city\u2019s woes have been compounded by years of sectarian violence. Up until 2014, the city saw frequent armed clashes between Sunni residents of the Bab al-Tabbaneh district and Alawites in neighbouring Jabal Mohsen.\n\nThe outbreak of the Syrian civil war just over the border exacerbated those tensions, and led to a rise in Islamist militancy. Gunmen once streamed through the same square where tens of thousands now gather.\n\nThat violence has given Tripoli a reputation that it has struggled to shake.\n\n\u201cI think people have the wrong perception of Tripoli and it\u2019s because of the media,\u201d says Mariam al-Kotob, 26, a graphic designer. \u201cThey only show the war.\u201d\n\nShe adds: \u201cA lot of people wouldn\u2019t dare to come and figure it out for themselves.\u201d\n\nAll of which explains why the giant, raucous, musical protests in the city have caught the attention of many Lebanese. A video of a giant \u201cprotest rave\u201d in the centre of the city went viral around the world earlier this week. \u201cIf you really want to protest you should go to Tripoli,\u201d one protester was reportedly overheard saying at a demonstration just outside of Beirut.\n\n\u201cThe scenes in Tripoli have been deeply moving because many had written off the city as a hub of Sunni extremism,\u201d says Lina Khatib, head of the Middle East and North Africa Programme at Chatham House think tank and a Lebanese citizen.\n\n\u201cThe peaceful and joyous coming together of Tripoli\u2019s residents and their chants of solidarity with fellow Lebanese from those southern cities also unfairly reputed as hubs of Shia extremism took many by surprise, but is one of the most powerful expressions of Lebanese society taking a stand against sectarian divisions.\u201d\n\nA Lebanese army campaign against militants in the city in 2014 put an end to the fighting, but the city\u2019s problems have not gone away. Despite its dire need for reconstruction and investment, Tripoli has been perennially neglected by the government in Beirut and by its own leaders. Big development projects, often announced with great fanfare, repeatedly fail to get off the ground.\n\n\u201cLook at all the promises they made for Tripoli, and nothing happened,\u201d says Safadi, the photographer. \u201cAll the politicians give us is words. They cannot give us anything else. We\u2019re not unique in that sense. We\u2019re the same as Baalbek and Sour and any other city in Lebanon.\u201d\n\nThe past few months saw Lebanon\u2019s financial crisis spiral out of control. Fears of a US dollar shortage have sparked panic for businesses across the country. Petrol stations have closed down in protest at the rising exchange rate and bakeries have warned they will not survive.\n\nIn Tripoli, where people were already living on the edge, the impact was devastating. When the WhatsApp tax was announced, people took to the streets across the city and the country at large. Even after the tax was shelved, protests spiralled and grew.\n\nPrevious outbreaks of unrest in Lebanon have tended to be party political. This time, however, protesters are demanding a complete overhaul of the country\u2019s political system, calling for an end to the sectarian, civil war-era parties that have held onto power through clientelism and gerrymandering.\n\nAcross the country, protesters are expressing anger at the failures of all party leaders. \u201cAll of them means all of them,\u201d is a popular refrain on the streets. But Tripoli has been failed by its politicians more than other cities due to its unique political makeup.\n\n\u201cSuccessive prime ministers, some of whom hailed from Tripoli, and parliamentarians, have taken the city for granted,\u201d says Randa Slim, senior fellow and director of conflict resolution at the Middle East Institute.\n\n\u201cUnlike other areas of Lebanon, Tripoli is a city that is heavily contested politically: no single party or leader can claim a dominant role in the city politics. Because they have other sides to blame for their failure to deliver, blame cannot be focused on one party.\u201d\n\nThat strategy worked when the city was polarised, but things have been slowly changing in Tripoli over the past few years \u2013 as they have across Lebanon. When the current crisis bit and the city\u2019s leaders could offer no help, something broke.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t surprised when I saw people on the street, because I was waiting for this to happen,\u201d says al-Kotob, the graphic designer. \u201cEverything was so bad, it was kind of an explosion.\n\n\u201cA lot of political parties were trying to keep Tripoli down. They were using the people of this city for elections.\n\n\u201cWhat is happening now is a lesson for them. When people are hungry, they are ready to fight.\u201d", "description": "A cacophony of beating drums, fireworks and chants rattles across Tripoli\u2019s central square, but the thumping music rises above them all.
