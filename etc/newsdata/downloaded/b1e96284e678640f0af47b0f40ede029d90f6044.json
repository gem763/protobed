The Washington Mystics had everything locked up.\n\nThat didn\u2019t stop the Mystics from deciding to push Chicago around on the final day of the WNBA regular season.\n\nElena Delle Donne rang up 25 points, 11 rebounds and three blocks and Tianna Hawkins added 24 points and nine boards as the Mystics stomped out the Sky 100-86 in Sunday\u2019s regular season finale.\n\nThe Mystics already had clinched the No. 1 seed and postseason home-court advantage on Friday, when they beat Dallas and second-place Connecticut lost. With Sunday\u2019s win they finished the regular season 26-8, the same record the Seattle Storm owned last year as they marched on to win the WNBA championship.\n\nThe Mystics will host Games 1 and 2 of their WNBA semifinal series on Sept. 17 and 19. The first two rounds of single-elimination games will determine their opponent.\n\nWith a win and some help, the Sky could have improved their playoff seeding and earned a first-round bye. Instead, they finished the year 20-14 and remained in fifth position.\n\nWashington used 11-0 and 7-0 runs and seven offensive rebounds to establish an 11-point advantage after one. It grew to a 56-30 halftime lead as Delle Donne reached 20 points and six rebounds in 17 minutes on the floor.\n\nChicago center Astou Ndour was ejected in the second quarter, despite her team\u2019s protests, for making incidental contact with official Kevin Fahy after a play.\n\nLate in the third period, the Sky posted a 9-0 run against Washington\u2019s second-string unit, bringing the game within six \u2014 the closest it got all day. The Mystics responded by running off 13 unanswered points across the end of the third and the start of the fourth. Five apiece came from Hawkins and Aerial Powers, helping them eventually slam the proverbial door.\n\nIt was a postseason tune-up for the Mystics, who have won their last six.\n\n\u201cWe just need to play people,\u201d Thibault said. \u201cEverybody was saying, \u2018Well, you rest your people.\u2019 If we had rested our people, they would all have had 11 days without a game.\u201d\n\nHawkins, who tied a season high with her 24, has rested occasional games down the stretch to go easy on a sore knee.\n\n\u201cI had a few days where I was able to rest, but coming back, the first thing I did yesterday was get in the gym and got my shots up,\u201d Hawkins said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be the biggest thing for everyone \u2014 just trying to stay in our rhythm and to keep on doing what we do best.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
