Adding to the market\u2019s weight was a Reuters report that said Saudi Arabia had restored faster-than-expected production lost from the Sept. 14 attack on its Abqaiq crude processing plant and Khurais oil field.\n\nCrude prices started the session lower on Congress\u2019s decision on Tuesday to start the impeachment process against President Donald Trump following reports he asked Ukraine to investigate political rival and former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nsettled down 80 cents, or 1.4%, at $56.49 per barrel.\n\nsettled down 71 cents, or 1.1%, at $62.39.\n\nThe two crude benchmarks fell more than 2% earlier, but came off their lows after Trump said a trade deal with China could happen sooner than expected.\n\nU.S. rose by 2.4 million barrels last week, the Energy Information Administration reported, against market expectations for a draw of 250,000 barrels. It was the second-straight weekly crude build cited by the EIA after four-straight weeks of unseasonably heavy crude draws late into the summer that took 24 million barrels off stocks.\n\n\u201cThis could be the clearest signal that the post-summer crude draws are over and that we could see substantial builds here on, which is hardly ideal for oil bulls as the risk impact from the Saudi attack is slowly fizzling,\u201d Investing.com analyst Barani Krishnan said.\n\nThe EIA also said that rose by 519,000 barrels, compared with a consensus for a rise of 296,000 barrels. The only bright spot for oil bulls was a near 3-million-barrel draw in versus analysts\u2019 projections for a slide of 733,000 barrels.\n\nReuters, quoting three sources, reported that Saudi Arabia had restored its oil production capacity to 11.3 million barrels per day, faster than thought.\n\nWith Wednesday\u2019s slide, crude prices were just about $2 higher since the attack on Saudi Arabia.\n\n\u201cIn less than two weeks, we have given back all that huge geopolitical premium we saw from the Saudi crisis\u201d, Krishnan said. Gains of as high as $8 per barrel were seen right after the attack.", "description": "Oil Slides on U.S. Build, Saudi Recovery; Trump Weighs Too", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEF0F1NE_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
