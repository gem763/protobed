(Picture: Rex Features)\n\nFancy scaring people for a living? Well, now you can, because a team building company has launched a new scaring service and is recruiting people who resemble some of the \u2018world\u2019s scariest clowns\u2019 in a \u00a3100 an hour job role.\n\nThe company is looking for people across the UK to scare people in their workplace, from 28 to 31 October.\n\nHowever, you\u2019ll only get the job if you actually have some physical likness to the likes of Pennywise, Wrinkles and the Joker.\n\nTo celebrate Halloween, members of the public will be able to hire the clowns through TeamTactics.co.uk, to scare friends and/or family at their place of work.\n\nTeam Tactics is recruiting people who have the capabilities to play a convincing Pennywise, Wrinkles and Joker clown. For example, hopeful applicants must have a large forehead and high pitched voice to act as Pennywise, and be slim with a manic laugh to be recruited as the Joker. An acting background or training is not essential, but it is a bonus.\n\nOr how about the Joker? (Picture: Warner Bros)\n\nTo apply, all you have to do is provide a photo along with which clown you\u2019re wanting to play, and a short paragraph on why you\u2019d make a good scary clown.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you\u2019re auditioning for Pennywise, we recommend talking about your love of drains and red balloons.\n\nCostumes will be mailed to each hired clown, with Team Tactics looking to find 10 clowns across the UK to cover all major regions.\n\nThe job will see successful applicants creeping into places of work and scaring unsuspecting people, while in character as the clown they\u2019re playing. The encounters will also be filmed for people to relive once they are over the initial scare.\n\nTina Benson, managing director at TeamTactics.co.uk said: \u2018Halloween, although traditionally an American holiday, has soared in popularity in the UK over the years, and for good reason! It\u2019s a fun celebration of all things spooky, and let\u2019s be honest, lots of people love the adrenaline rush of being scared or the thrill of scaring a friend. So, we thought we\u2019d introduce something that ticks both these boxes.\n\n\u2018We\u2019re amazed at the massive demand we\u2019ve had for the clown scaring service, we knew it would be popular, but there\u2019s a lot of colleagues out there who can\u2019t wait to see their work friend get spooked, and the best part? We\u2019ll catch it all on camera!\n\n\u2018Now, all we need is some seriously scary clowns to help cater to all the requests we have, I encourage any person who can pull off a creepy clown to apply, it\u2019s going to be a lot of fun.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: Woman finds her copy of a book 25 years after she gave it to a charity shop\n\nMORE: A mum suffering from endometriosis will be forced into menopause at age of 30\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "A company is looking to pay lookalikes to dress as Pennywise the clown and the joker to prank workplaces.", "authors": ["Hattie Gladwell"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_91186069_1571756409.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
