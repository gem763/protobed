It makes her feel terribly guilty and sad, and while she wants to help, she doesn\u2019t know how. Neither do I. What should I do?\n\nChris\n\nDear Chris,\n\nFirst, you should know that your reaction is completely understandable in the aftermath of infidelity. In fact, what you\u2019re describing is a common response to trauma. I use the word trauma because while most people can easily imagine (or are personally acquainted with) the pain of being cheated on, what some may not realize is that many betrayed partners experience symptoms of PTSD.\n\nSome of these symptoms are irritability, insomnia, hypervigilance, and difficulty concentrating. People can also suffer from \u201cintrusion symptoms,\u201d such as flashbacks (of, say, walking in on a cheating partner), nightmares related to the affair, physical reactivity to traumatic reminders (like increased heart rate when running into the co-worker), or emotional distress in the face of traumatic reminders (like the mood \u201cdisruption\u201d you\u2019re experiencing when seeing him).\n\nThe \u201creal issue\u201d here is that the affair was very painful, and seeing your co-worker is a traumatic trigger for the actual issue: betrayal. Part of what makes infidelity so devastating is that it involves multiple levels of betrayal. Yes, your girlfriend betrayed your trust, and the two of you are working through that together. But your co-worker also betrayed you, and this part of the trauma can be especially hard to work through, because most people focus so much on the primary betrayal (between you and your girlfriend) that they don\u2019t take the time to work through\u2014or even acknowledge\u2014the secondary one.\n\nYou may be thinking, Wait, I barely know this co-worker. It\u2019s not as if he was my best friend. And to be sure, many would likely say that this isn\u2019t about the other person at all. After all, this person never made a commitment to you. Only your partner did.\n\nBut there\u2019s something disingenuous about that line of thinking. The other person involved in infidelity, even if that person is single and available and has little or no connection to the betrayed partner, is complicit in the betrayal. Rationalizations such as \u201cShe was unhappy in her relationship\u2014I didn\u2019t do anything wrong\u201d are the equivalent of driving the getaway car in a robbery and claiming not to be an accessory to the crime. \u201cI wasn\u2019t in a relationship with you\u2014she was\u201d is tantamount to saying, \u201cI didn\u2019t commit the theft; I just happily took a share of the stolen money.\u201d These mental gymnastics leave the betrayed partner feeling irrational for having reactions like the one you\u2019re having when seeing your co-worker.\n\nPresumably, your co-worker knew that the woman he was having sex with was your girlfriend. So in addition to the pain of seeing him at work, there\u2019s also the awkwardness of neither of you acknowledging the betrayal. He hasn\u2019t come up to you and said, \u201cI\u2019m sincerely sorry about the pain I caused.\u201d Of course, it\u2019s possible that he hopes you don\u2019t know about it; or that he knows that you do, and he feels too guilty to bring it up.", "description": "I\u2019ve forgiven her, but I can\u2019t forgive him.", "authors": ["Lori Gottlieb"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/betrayed_and_angry_final/facebook.jpg?1571622993", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
