Allies aren\u2019t so sure.", "language": "en", "text": "It\u2019s a prospect that may seem far-fetched. Senate Republican officials say the party still foresees an almost entirely partisan outcome in a potential impeachment trial. And Republicans \u2014 especially those up for election in 2020 \u2014 have long been afraid of losing Trump\u2019s base if he turns on them. They\u2019ve rarely defected from the president in large numbers for key votes.\n\nBut the landscape could shift quickly if fresh details emerge that help Democrats make their case that Trump must go, said Michael Steel, a longtime GOP operative and aide to former House Speaker John Boehner.\n\n\u201cIf the Democrats are able to make an argument that\u2019s clear and captures the public imagination \u2026 then you start thinking more seriously about what a Senate trial could look like and whether you could get to that possibility,\u201d Steel said of a scenario in which enough GOP senators defect to remove Trump\u2026\n\n\u201cPresident Trump really goes after anyone who is anything less than completely supportive. The way he\u2019s gone back after Sen. Romney is inappropriate and disgraceful,\u201d Coons said. \u201cIf I were a Republican senator, I would make a pretty tough but prompt assessment that history will judge harshly those who do not show some independence from this president.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com News"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
