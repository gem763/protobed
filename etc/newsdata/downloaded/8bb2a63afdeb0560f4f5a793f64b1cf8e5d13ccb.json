Now I\u2019m learning how to point to every country on a map. I\u2019ll never need this information, but it feels cool to know. I\u2019m learning on the free flashcard app Tinycards, which feels remarkably like playing a mobile game, but one you can feel good about. Here\u2019s the best pointless knowledge you can pick up on the app.\n\nIf you feel addicted to any time-wasting mobile apps, Tinycards is a great replacement. The slickly designed app from Duolingo gives you the same trickle of dopamine that social media and mobile games do. The minimum time you need for a useful Tinycards session is about 30 seconds. Don\u2019t try to learn anything tough or wordy (unless that\u2019s your thing). Try these simple things that are kind of cool to know:\n\nUnlike a basic flashcard app, Tinycards controls what cards you see and when, using the scientifically optimised spaced repetition method. This helps you memorise things better, but it also means that when you blast through a set of cards for the third time, you feel like you\u2019re beating a video game level that always killed you before.\n\nThere\u2019s even a way to adjust your difficulty setting: Sometimes you\u2019ll run into a deck where you already know half the cards. Mute the easy cards with the eye icon, and you\u2019ll only get the more challenging ones.\n\nTinycards is great if you can find a pre-made deck. If you want to make your own cards for real studying, you might prefer other flashcard apps like Anki. But if you just want to find something cute to learn for fun, Tinycards is your best bet.", "description": "I learned the NATO phonetic alphabet.
