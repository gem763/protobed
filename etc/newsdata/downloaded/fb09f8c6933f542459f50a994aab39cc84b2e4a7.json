Now all success is scrutinized. Merely to succeed, especially financially, invites scrutiny, judgment, abuse.\u201d\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nCouldn't have said it better myself. That\u2019s an articulate statement. It neatly sums up the political reality of America today. The left has no time for success.\n\nSo who said it? Alec Baldwin, the Hollywood actor who leads the Trump-hating charge on \"Saturday Night Live.\"\n\nI should point out that Baldwin\u2019s tweet was in defense of Felicity Huffman, who was sentenced to two weeks in jail for her part in the college admissions scandal. Baldwin thinks she was punished excessively because she's wealthy. He thinks she should only do community service.\n\nPut that debate aside, and focus on what Baldwin said because he's dead right.\n\nAnyone who sat through the three-hour Democratic debate Tuesday night would have seen the rich bashed and blamed throughout. Financial success these days is frowned on. The billionaires, the giant corporations and the mega-wealthy; it\u2019s all their fault. Take their wealth away, because no one \"deserves\" that much money! What was that Baldwin said again? \"Financial success invites scrutiny, judgment, abuse\"!\n\nNow, I don't think Baldwin and Hollywood are suddenly going to become Republican. They're on the left, and they're going to stay there. They hate Trump and that\u2019s not going to change.\n\nBut how refreshing to get such accurate commentary. Alec Baldwin identified one of the dominant themes of the day: you're successful, and you don't deserve it. It\u2019s the American Dream, stood on its head.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "Alec Baldwin identified one of the dominant themes of the day.", "authors": ["Stuart Varney"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/Alec-Baldwin-Getty-001.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
