REUTERS/Al Drago\n\nIn June, the United States ended its preferential trade treatment for India, removing it from the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) programme that allowed duty-free entry for up to $5.6 billion worth of its annual exports to the United States.\n\nThe elimination of GSP brought higher retaliatory tariffs from New Delhi on 28 U.S. products including almonds, apples and walnuts.\n\nIn the letter addressed to United State Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and dated Sept. 17, the members of Congress said: \u201cJust as U.S. industries are harmed by lack of fair and reciprocal access to India\u2019s market, American companies and workers also are harmed by new tariffs due to the GSP termination.\u201d\n\nA lot of American jobs depend on the trade between India and the United States, the U.S. lawmakers said in the letter seen by Reuters.\n\nThe letter comes days ahead of a meeting between Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nAfter the Trump administration\u2019s decision to remove trade privileges from Indian products under the GSP, U.S. and Indian trade negotiators met in July. But they failed to make any major progress on the issue of tariffs and other protectionist measures imposed by both sides.\n\nThe two sides had resumed trade talks after Trump and Modi met on the sidelines of the G20 summit in June and agreed to seek to deepen the two countries\u2019 relationship.\n\nOther than seeking the rollback of Indian tariffs imposed on agricultural products like almonds and apples, Washington has also expressed its concerns over India\u2019s tightening of regulations that have undermined major U.S. e-commerce companies like Walmart\u2019s (WMT.N) Flipkart and Amazon (AMZN.O).\n\nIndia is by far the largest buyer of U.S. almonds, paying $543 million for more than half of U.S. almond exports in 2018, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture. It is the second largest buyer of U.S. apples, taking $156 million worth in 2018.\n\nOn Sept. 22, Trump, who has repeatedly called out India for its high tariffs, will travel to Houston, Texas, to participate in an event with Modi and to \u201cdiscuss ways to deepen their energy and trade relationship.\u201d\n\nModi will visit Houston to participate in an event called \u201cHowdy Modi!
