USA TODAY\n\nASHBURN, Va. \u2014 On the day that the Washington Redskins fired head coach Jay Gruden, leaving an already dissipating fanbase with little hope and an already hapless franchise with an unclear direction, team president Bruce Allen said that everything is fine.\n\nIn a rare news conference at Washington's practice facility Monday, Allen said he can feel the passion of Redskins players, who have yet to win a game this season. He said the front office has had \"a few great drafts\" and \"the pieces are here for a winning team.\" And perhaps most notably, he praised the culture of an organization that has lost 11 of its past 12 games and become known throughout the league for its dysfunction.\n\n\"You know, the culture is actually damn good,\" Allen said. \"These people care. We have a very young core of players that we have brought in here who are accustomed to winning. If you look at the record of these guys they're accustomed to winning. They want to win.\n\n\"We've made too many mistakes on game day. But the effort \u2014 the effort of the players and the rest of this organization is fantastic.\"\n\nWhen asked about how that \"damn good\" culture has translated to wins, Allen offered a puzzling response.\n\n\"Through winning football games. We have to win. We didn't win any of these games,\" he said.\n\nWashington Redskins president Bruce Allen (left) team owner Daniel Snyder (right) on the field before the game against the Cincinnati Bengals at FedEx Field. (Photo: Brad Mills, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThe purpose of Monday's news conference was ostensibly to discuss the firing of Gruden after five-plus seasons, but it quickly devolved into a referendum on Allen, who joined the organization nearly a decade ago.\n\nAs coaches, scouts and players have come and gone since late 2009, Allen has remained entrenched as owner Dan Snyder's right-hand man \u2014 even though the Redskins have posted an overall record of 59-89-1 during his tenure. And on Monday, Allen sidestepped multiple questions about his personal role in the organization's demise.\n\n\"We're all involved in this,\" he said, when asked directly about his level of accountability for Washington's performance over the past decade.\n\n\"We're all 0-5,\" he said at another point.\n\nAllen has, most recently, drawn fans' ire for refusing to trade Pro Bowl left tackle Trent Williams, who has been holding out since training camp. Allen said \"there's been no dialogue with any other team\" about Williams and he is not considering making a trade at this point.\n\nAs for Gruden, Allen did not offer much reasoning for the coach's dismissal other than to say the decision was made a few hours after Washington's 33-7 loss to the New England Patriots on Sunday and was \"difficult, but it was necessary.\"\n\nOffensive line coach Bill Callahan, the former Oakland Raiders and University of Nebraska coach, will serve as the Redskins' interim coach as they prepare to face another winless team, the Miami Dolphins, on Sunday.\n\nContact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday.com or on Twitter @Tom_Schad.", "description": "Amid questions about the state of the franchise following Jay Gruden's firing, Redskins president Bruce Allen contended the team is in fine shape.", "authors": ["Tom Schad", "Published P.M.
