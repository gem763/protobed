N. General Assembly (UNGA), an event he ordinarily uses to advance Israeli interests on the world stage, because of current \u201cpolitical circumstances,\u201d but did not elaborate, The Times of Israel reported.\n\nThe trip\u2019s cancellation came just hours after Israel\u2019s national elections, in which Netanyahu failed to secure an outright victory in the polls and now taxing coalition talks are expected to follow.\n\nForeign Minister Israel Katz, a member of the ruling Likud party, will reportedly attend UNGA in Netanyahu\u2019s place.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s visit to the United States next week was supposed to include a meeting with President Trump, but the official said that meeting will no longer take place.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump said he was looking forward to meeting with Netanyahu after the elections in Israel to potentially discuss a possible U.S.-Israel security pact, but there is reportedly no word whether the meeting would be rescheduled.\n\nWhen addressing reporters in Los Angeles on Wednesday afternoon, President Trump acknowledged he had not been informed on the latest developments with the Israeli elections but said, \u201cOur relationship is with Israel.\u201d\n\nInitial results show Netanyahu\u2019s conservative Likud party and Gantz\u2019s centrist Blue and White party virtually deadlocked.\n\nISRAELI EXIT POLLS SHOW NETANYAHU SHORT OF MAJORITY IN YEAR'S SECOND ELECTION\n\nGantz\u2019s centrist bloc, which could potentially include the Joint List of Arab parties, has a slight edge over Netanyahu and his religious and nationalist allies.\n\nThe Joint List was expected to win about a dozen seats in the 120-member assembly, coming third after the Blue and White party and the Likud party.\n\nThe increased turnout among Arab voters propelled the bloc to a strong showing at the polls and may have prevented Netanyahu from attaining the right-wing coalition he had desperately sought.\n\n\"There is no other prime minister who incited against us like Netanyahu,\" the leader of the Joint List, Ayman Odeh, told Israeli media. \"There's a limit. The Arab citizens undoubtedly felt that they became a persecuted minority, an endangered minority.\"\n\nNeither Netanyahu nor Gantz have enough support to form a government without the Yisrael Beitenu party led by former Netanyahu ally-turned-rival Avigdor Lieberman, who has emerged as kingmaker. The Yisrael Beitenu party is expected to secure 9 seats.\n\nLieberman said Wednesday he\u2019ll insist upon a secular unity government between Netanyahu\u2019s and Gantz\u2019s parties, adding that is the \u201cone and only option.\u201d\n\nGantz, a former military chief, has ruled out sitting with a Netanyahu-led Likud at a time when the prime minister is expected to be indicted on corruption charges in the coming weeks, which could mark the end of Netanyahu\u2019s more than a decade in power.\n\nHowever, final results, which are expected on Thursday morning in Israel, could still swing toward Netanyahu.\n\nEven though Netanyahu failed to secure enough support in Tuesday\u2019s elections to form a new government with his right-wing political allies, he said he will seek to lead a ruling coalition with those supporters.\n\nBENJAMIN NETANYAHU'S CAREER ON THE LINE AS ISRAEL VOTES IN REPEAT ELECTION\n\nAt a party meeting in Jerusalem on Wednesday Netanyahu said that he is against any government that \u201cleans on the anti-Zionist Arab parties,\u201d and said he would make \u201cevery effort to prevent a dangerous government like this.\u201d\n\nTuesday\u2019s elections came after Netanyahu failed to form a government in the allotted time frame and pushed through a vote to dissolve the Israeli parliament, calling for new elections rather than allowing Ganz the opportunity to form a governing coalition.\n\nOnce the official results are announced, Israel President Reuven Rivlin will select the candidate he believes has the best chance of forming a stable coalition. Rivlin is expected to consult with all parties in the coming days before making his decision.\n\nThe president reportedly has until October 2 to task a lawmaker with forming a government.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nRivlin\u2019s choice will then have up to six weeks to assemble a government and if that person fails, the president can appoint another candidate, who will get up to four weeks.\n\nFox News\u2019 Trey Yingst and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu canceled his trip to New York City for the United Nations\u2019 annual General Assembly next week after falling short of securing a parliamentary majority in Israel\u2019s second general election in five months, his office announced Wednesday.", "authors": ["Talia Kaplan", "Talia Kaplan Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com.
