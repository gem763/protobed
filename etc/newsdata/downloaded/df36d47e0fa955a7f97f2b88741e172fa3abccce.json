Of course, we learned in 2016 that polls can sometimes mislead, and in this particular case, digging a little shows a deeply partisan divide. While nearly 50 percent of people polled now support impeachment, that number is made up of nearly 85 percent Democrats. Just 12 percent of Republicans support impeachment and upward of 70 percent of Republicans believe the president\u2019s dealings with Ukraine are within typical presidential limits. Most Republicans think he meant to stop corruption and protect American interests, according to a CBS News poll.\n\nWith a damning reconstructed phone call transcript, a detailed whistle-blower report, several high-ranking Trump surrogates being subpoenaed and testimonies well underway, how can such a seemingly cut-and-dry issue be read in an oppositional way? With farmers left in the dust, discrimination against pre-existing conditions returning to insurance coverage and taxes rising for millions, how can Republicans continue to support the president?\n\nSimple. They identify with him.\n\nWorking-class Republicans in Alachua County see Donald Trump as a white businessman who made a lot of money. They like to think that could be them. The only thing standing in the way of achieving that dream, they tell me, are policies that elevate people of color, immigrants and poor people without health care. My neighbors misidentify what is holding them back, but they don\u2019t want to correctly identify the actual problem \u2014 corporations, billionaires, white privilege, late-stage capitalism \u2014 because they hope to be part of that world someday. They think they have rightfully earned it.\n\nOn a recent Saturday night, while sitting outside a bar with a friend, a man with just a few teeth started a conversation with me. The first thing he uttered was an apology for his lacking dental work. Like so many other Americans, he couldn\u2019t afford to get them fixed.\n\nThe conversation took an unexpected turn when he went on to rail against universal health care. He didn\u2019t want to pay for other people to get help. He didn\u2019t have health insurance and told me he once duct-taped a cut on his arm because he couldn\u2019t afford stitches.", "description": "Working-class Republicans see Donald Trump as a white businessman who made a lot of money.
