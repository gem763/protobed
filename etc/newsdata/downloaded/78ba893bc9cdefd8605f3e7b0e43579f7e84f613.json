Henry Cuellar. | Alex Wong/Getty Images Congress House approves bill to avoid shutdown \u2014 but wall fight looms\n\nThe House on Thursday easily passed a stopgap spending measure to avert a shutdown at month\u2019s end. But the hard part is just beginning.\n\nDemocratic and Republican leaders will spend the next two months attempting to forge a lasting deal to fund the government involving all of the same political landmines that thrust Washington into a 35-day shutdown \u2014 and more.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe border wall. Detention beds. Immigration agents. And now, President Donald Trump\u2019s cash grab from the Pentagon to fund the wall.\n\n\u201cThat is going to be a big fight, like we saw last time,\u201d Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas) said in an interview. \u201cNobody wants a shutdown. But what do you do when you\u2019re so far apart?\u201d\n\nAfter a 301-123 vote, the House-approved funding bill \u2014 which keeps the government open until just before Thanksgiving \u2014 now heads to the Senate, which is expected to clear the legislation well before the Sept. 30 deadline.\n\nCongressional leaders will then have until Nov. 21 to reach an accord for full-year funding, or, as many lawmakers expect, another funding patch through Christmas. That sets up Congress for an eerily similar scenario to fall 2018, when dealmaking broke down and Trump shuttered the government after Democrats refused to fund his wall.\n\nEven this short-term funding bill resulted in some behind the scenes drama: Democratic and Republican spending leaders struggled to reach a deal for days as they sparred over Trump\u2019s controversial aid program for farmers hit by his trade wars, Puerto Rico\u2019s Medicaid funding, and, of course, the wall.\n\nThe most difficult piece of the upcoming funding talks center on a small slice of the $1.4 trillion budget: the Department of Homeland Security. That bill alone, and the related fight over the wall, was the trigger of the longest-ever government shutdown that stretched from last December to January.\n\nSo far this year, neither party has formally released its opening bid on the DHS funding bill. House Democratic leaders have said they plan to offer zero dollars for Trump\u2019s wall, while pursuing more restrictions for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, including fewer detention beds.\n\nSenate Democrats, meanwhile, have skewered Republicans for proposing that $5 billion from domestic programs be spent on the wall, with plans to divert another $7 billion in military construction funds to border projects. Those fiscal 2020 funding levels could be in flux, however, as both parties in the upper chamber continue negotiating behind the scenes.\n\nSenate Appropriations Chairman Richard Shelby acknowledged earlier this week that bipartisanship in the appropriations process has eroded over funding for Trump\u2019s wall.\n\n\u201cThe controversy has seemed to grow and gotten deeper in the Democratic ranks,\u201d the Alabama Republican said. When asked on Thursday if a short-term spending bill is just punting on that contentious issue, he replied, \u201cCould be.\u201d\n\nDemocratic lawmakers view the request for more wall funding as a slap in the face. The White House already unilaterally diverted several billion dollars from military construction projects for his wall this year.\n\n\u201cThey know darn well that $12 billion in additional monies for the wall isn\u2019t going to fly with Senate Democrats or the House,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said.\n\nFunding disputes over the wall are part of why the Senate has yet to pass a single spending bill on the floor \u2014 a delayed start that has complicated any attempt by the two chambers to begin talks on a final deal. Disagreements over abortion-related provisions have also ensnared some of the Senate\u2019s spending bills.\n\nHouse Democrats, meanwhile, have passed funding bills for nearly every other department.\n\nBut Democratic lawmakers say they are also unwilling to delay consideration of a DHS funding bill for much longer \u2014 fearful of simply maintaining current funding and other policy provisions that Democrats are eager to change.\n\n\u201cOne of the things I\u2019m going to be pushing is that DHS doesn\u2019t become the orphan child again. But that there\u2019s going to be a total package,\u201d said California Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, who leads Democratic negotiations for the House DHS funding bill.\n\nProgressive lawmakers, in particular, are eager to use the upcoming funding talks to fight Trump\u2019s border policies, which include not just the wall, but a slew of new hard-line moves taken over the summer.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) told reporters this week that he expects \u201csome big fights\u201d this fall \u2014 \u201cincluding how people are treated at the border.\u201d\n\nStill, Rep. Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.), who leads the House Appropriations Committee, downplayed the drama.\n\n\u201cThere are many difficult issues. We\u2019ll sit down and work them out,\u201d Lowey said. \u201cThat\u2019s what government is all about.\u201d", "description": "The Senate is expected to pass the measure next week.", "authors": ["Sarah Ferris", "Caitlin Emma"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/1c/88/5a7b040a4a8a85848b0f878f52dd/190919-henry-cuellar-gty-77e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
