For , all roads likely lead to $1600-$1800. There could be significant bumps in these roads, probably involving time more than price.\n\nSilver\n\nSilver looks stronger than gold, but gold is also looking very solid, from both a fundamental and technical perspective.\n\nWhether silver breaks out from the bull wedge now or a bit later really doesn\u2019t matter.\n\nMy recommendation to silver price enthusiasts is to get in on the action right now and buy more on any further price softness, which may or may not happen.\n\nGold\n\nIt\u2019s been my firm contention that rather than roar higher or melt lower, gold is poised to consolidate with sideway action.\n\nThe $1465 support zone is acting like a sponge more than a trampoline or trap door, and that\u2019s positive.\n\nWhile the Western fear trade gets the most attention from gold market fundamentalists, it\u2019s like the hare while the love trade is the turtle. In the long term, it could be the love trade that drives and sustains gold at prices that currently seem almost unimaginable.\n\nN Business On New UAE Gold Policy\n\nOne of my predictions has been that Dubai (the city of gold) will ultimately become the world\u2019s main centre of price discovery.\n\nDubai jewellers estimate the world\u2019s annual demand for gold jewellery at more than 2000 tons, and they project solid growth for the long-term.\n\nMine supply is stagnant and central banks don\u2019t appear interested in selling gold. India\u2019s RBI has recently joined the central bank \u201cbuy club\u201d with modest accumulation.\n\nOn the demand side, Dubai\u2019s new gold policy can help make the $1400-$1500 zone into a real floor.\n\nThe lower-for-longer approach to interest rates in the West is another floor-building theme.\n\nAlso, the US-China trade deal appears to be more of a tariff taxes lock than an actual trade deal, and I\u2019ve predicted these tariff taxes will be here for at least the next decade.\n\nBloomberg News On Gold\n\nWhat about the retail investor? Standard Chartered (LON: ) Bank\u2019s heavyweight analyst Suki Cooper is highly respected in the institutional investor community.\n\nShe predicts the stock market is likely to swoon in 2020, and retail investors will seek refuge in gold as that happens.\n\nI\u2019ve also been adamant that in any stock market sell-off, gold will be a better safe-haven that T-bonds.\n\nMost money managers believe QE and rate cuts have waned as tools to boost economic growth, but they can still help to cushion a stock-market meltdown.\n\nWhen the Fed rolled out QE and rate cuts in 2008, T-bonds still paid some interest. Money managers are concerned that the Treasury will join other central banks and begin offering negative rate bonds to investors.\n\nNegative rate bonds issued by a US government that refuses to cut spending and debt are not a safe-haven\u2026 and they could be a time bomb! Institutional concern about negative rate bond issuance is clearly an important driver of gold demand that could be here to stay.\n\nVanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF\n\nGOAU Precious Metals ETF\n\nGDX (NYSE: ) doesn\u2019t look as good as silver or gold bullion. The U.S. Global GO GOLD and Precious Metal Miners ETF (NYSE: ) ETF sports a beautiful bull wedge pattern.\n\nWhether there\u2019s a bit more bump-and-grind action within the wedge should not be a concern for investors. The focus should be on the bull wedge itself, because it suggests a move to and through the $18-area highs will be the next big event.", "description": "Commodities Analysis by Stewart Thomson covering: XAU/USD, XAG/USD, Standard Chartered PLC, Gold Futures.
