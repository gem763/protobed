Gen. Stephen C. Williams said, \"As required by U.S. law and United States Forces Korea-Korean Employees Union agreements to provide six-month's notice of a potential lapse in Special Measures Agreement contributions, on October 1, 2019 U.S. Forces Korea notified the ROK Ministry of Employment and Labor and the Korean Employees Union on the timeline for a potential furlough of USFK Korean National and Korean Service Corps (KSC) employees that could occur on April 1, 2020 absent an agreed upon SMA. Due to the ongoing consultative talks between the U.S. and Republic of Korea delegations, we are unable to speculate on potential outcomes related to the SMA negotiations. We remain hopeful for a swift conclusion to SMA discussions to mitigate a potential lapse in contributions that directly support compensation for the nearly 9,000 members of the USFK Korean National workforce currently employed in Korea.\"\n\nKorea already increased its share to nearly US$1 billion last year and now U.S. President Donald Trump reportedly wants to hike the amount five-fold.\n\nSo far the Korean government has stalled by only naming its chief negotiator on the first day of talks in Seoul last month. But now the U.S. is ramping up pressure to settle by year's end. President Moon Jae-in's meeting with Trump in New York last month seems to have made no difference.\n\nUSFK headquarters sent a similar letter to the Korean side during the last talks.\n\nShin Beom-chul at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies said, \"In past years, the U.S. did similar things ahead of the negotiations, but the $5 billion the U.S. is now demanding is such an extortionate amount that the pressure is felt quite differently.\"\n\nThe government believes that the U.S. eventually expects to settle for $2 billion, or double the current amount.\n\n", "description": "USFK Threatens to Send Korean Staff on Unpaid Leave", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://image.chosun.com/facebook/newson.gif", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
