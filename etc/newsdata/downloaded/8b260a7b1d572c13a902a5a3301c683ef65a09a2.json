They misdiagnosed the individual they were dealing with, assuming that Mr. Trump would \u201cgrow in office\u201d and that they, the \u201cadults in the room,\u201d would be able to control and contain him. At the outset of this unholy alliance, they were convinced they would change Mr. Trump more than Mr. Trump would change them. But the transformation turned out to be in them, not him.\n\nNor should one underestimate the role self-interest plays in the Trump-Republican relationship. \u201cAll people in elective politics are interested in self-preservation,\u201d a Republican who served in the Senate told me. \u201cAny negative comment by a Republican in Congress about the president would invite trouble in the next election either in the form of opposition in the next primary or lack of support in the general.\u201d\n\n\u201cUntil Republicans feel their existence is threatened by Trump\u2019s mendacity and corruption, most will be blind to it,\u201d a former Republican presidential aide told me. \u201cThat isn\u2019t to say there won\u2019t be leading indicators of potential moral restoration,\u201d he said, \u201cbut in the meantime, the cowed stay in line like the trophies of a bully.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis storm has more staying power than most,\u201d he added, ominously.\n\nThere\u2019s also this to factor in: For many Republican members of Congress, the president is more popular among Republican voters in their districts and states than they are. Even in the districts of moderate Republicans, Trumpist true-believers are the most vocal supporters of the party, the ones who do the essential grass-roots work. So to go crosswise of a sitting president of one\u2019s own party invites political trouble, which most politicians seek to avoid. That is especially true when it comes to Mr. Trump, who specializes in savaging Republicans \u2014 and everyone else, for that matter \u2014 who dare to criticize him.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want to get bludgeoned,\u201d a person who served in Congress told me. \u201cTheir mind is looking for a rationale for not having to do it.\u201d In addition, this person added, Mr. Trump has \u201cconditioned people in the base so much so that it\u2019s just \u2018us versus them\u2019 and that if you give an inch on him, you\u2019re just giving the other side what they want. You\u2019ve made yourself a \u2018useful idiot.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easier to stay with the tribe,\u201d this individual told me. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to stay with the team.\u201d Even when the leader of the team is thoroughly corrupt.\n\nAll of this is tied to the psychology of accommodation. As a conservative-leaning clinical psychologist I know explained to me, when new experiences don\u2019t fit into an existing schema \u2014 Mr. Trump becoming the leader of the party that insisted on the necessity of good character in the Oval Office when Bill Clinton was president, for example \u2014 cognitive accommodation occurs.", "description": "Trump has given them another chance to break away.
