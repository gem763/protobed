Schiff was also consulting with the House's sergeant at arms.\n\nThe GOP-led stunt, led by House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.), comes as President Donald Trump has demanded that Republicans \u201cget tough and fight\u201d for him in the impeachment probe. But Republicans have struggled to defend Trump on the substance of the allegations against him, and have instead focused on hammering Democrats over what they see as an illegitimate impeachment process.\n\nRepublicans knew they would be turned away from the closed-door deposition; only members who sit on the authorized committees are permitted to sit in on the sessions. Scores of Republicans who sit on the three panels leading the inquiry have been participating in the witness interviews.\n\nBut the GOP has been girding for a showdown with Democrats over the inquiry, which they believe is being conducted unfairly. Democrats expressed frustration with the stunt on Wednesday, saying it put a scheduled deposition on hold.\n\n\u201cThey basically ran over a member of the staff\u201d to get in the room, said Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.). \u201cThey just came into the room and started shouting about the president. Literally some of them were just screaming \u2026 saying that the process is wrong.\u201d\n\nOther Democrats said the stunt showed that Republicans were reeling from Tuesday\u2019s testimony by William Taylor, the top American diplomat in Ukraine, who directly tied Trump to a quid pro quo with the eastern European nation involving critical military aid.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s completely inappropriate. When the facts are against you, the law is against you, the president clearly committed a crime, you\u2019re left with arguing the process,\u201d said Rep. Harley Rouda (D-Calif.), who witnessed the chaos unfold behind closed doors.\n\nBut one Republican who has been able to attend the proceedings, Rep. Chris Stewart of Utah, acknowledged that the closed-door nature of the impeachment proceedings are consistent with the House\u2019s procedures.\n\n\u201cThis may be within House rules. That\u2019s not the question. The question is, is it a good idea to impeach the president in secret hearings?\u201d Stewart said. \u201cThis may very well be within Chairman Schiff\u2019s and Nancy Pelosi\u2019s authority to do this. I think it\u2019s a bad idea.\u201d\n\nDemocrats leading the impeachment inquiry have been gathering evidence for the probe behind closed doors, asserting that secrecy is paramount in order to protect the integrity of the investigation. Republicans have said the depositions with current and former Trump administration officials should be done in public.\n\nRepublicans also say it\u2019s unfair that only members of the three committees spearheading the inquiry \u2014 Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs \u2014 are allowed to attend the closed-door interviews. On Wednesday, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Laura Cooper appeared for testimony, and GOP members of the House Armed Services Committee asserted it was their right to attend the deposition because the Pentagon falls under their committee\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n\u201cI represent nearly a million Floridians who are asking me my thoughts on this process, and yet I can\u2019t relay to them anything except what\u2019s being leaked to the media. It is really a travesty,\u201d said Rep. Michael Waltz (R-Fla.), a member of the Armed Services panel.\n\nIn reality, more than 45 House Republicans \u2014 nearly a quarter of the House GOP conference \u2014 already have full access to the depositions via their membership on one of the three committees leading the impeachment inquiry. And during the depositions, Republican counsel is given the same amount of time to question witnesses as Democratic counsel.\n\nHeather Caygle and Kyle Cheney contributed to this report.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/a4/d0/fa2766d940cc94df82ca8b668e4f/191023-steve-scalise-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
