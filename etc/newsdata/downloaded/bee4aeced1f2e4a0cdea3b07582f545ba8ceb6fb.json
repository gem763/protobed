Even The Weather Channel has fallen victim.\n\nBut before those attacks, there was an attack on the nation\u2019s capital, days before the presidential inauguration. An article from The Wall Street Journal details how hackers Alexandru Isvanca and Eveline Cismaru seized control of Washington, DC\u2019s surveillance cameras right before Trump\u2019s inauguration. The piece is full of twists and turns, from the small-time beginnings of the hackers\u2019 scamming careers to them eventually turning on each other.\n\nThe story contains a lot of colorful details about the pair. Here are some highlights:\n\nThe hackers weren\u2019t initially trying to hit DC police cameras. They caught a break after sending out hundreds of thousands of emails containing ransomware to a list of addresses purchased on the dark web \u2014 it just so happened that at least one was connected to DC police. In the end, they controlled 126 out of 186 DC police computers, which in turn controlled the surveillance cameras.\n\nIsvanca and Cismaru led authorities straight to a smoking gun. Well, at least a barbecuing device called a smoking gun. It turns out the pair used that same hacked DC police computer in a separate Amazon scam Cismaru was running. She ordered a smoking gun, and the tracking number showed up on the police computer, allowing authorities to see and raid the package\u2019s destination.\n\nIsvanca didn\u2019t do a great job of covering his tracks either. He ordered pizza using the same email address he used to hack the computers.\n\nCismaru said that hacking into the capital\u2019s surveillance system was easy. \u201cAmericans are stupid,\u201d she said in a text to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nYou can read the rest of the fascinating details in the full story here.", "description": "Hackers Alexandru Isvanca and Eveline Cismaru launched a ransomware attack which hit DC police surveillance cameras eight days before Trump\u2019s inauguration, and then led authorities straight to them by failing to cover their tracks, including a separate Amazon scam that literally involved a smoking gun.", "authors": ["Aliya Chaudhry", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7cXsOVLmKnzRFWdwvGarbnPE6wM=/0x77:1100x653/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/assets/2243371/hacker-stock1_2040.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
