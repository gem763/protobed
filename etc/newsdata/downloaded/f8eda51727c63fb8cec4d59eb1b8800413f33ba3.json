Three pellets \u2013 which came from the same gun \u2013 were lodged in the bird\u2019s body, while another two \u2013 from a separate airgun \u2013 had lodged in its shoulder and head.\n\nNo Casino shootout: police deny plan to kill swooping magpies in NSW town Read more\n\nThe motive for the attack is unknown. Crosta said he wasn\u2019t sure who delivered Mr Cocky to the practice \u2013 \u201cwe receive so many birds\u201d \u2013 and it is unclear whether the bird was known to its attackers.\n\n\u201cThey [sulphur-crested cockatoos] are pretty loud,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe it was annoying someone, or maybe two kids being stupid. Maybe he was just really unlucky and got shot by one person and flew away and got shot by someone else.\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t have any idea why. I can understand someone who shoots a rabbit or a deer to eat it, and these are invasive species. But shooting a cockatoo? Why? It\u2019s a native bird. It is very common, I agree, but what\u2019s the point? It\u2019s not even fun. If you want to prove you are a very good shooter, shoot a pigeon that is quick at least.\u201d\n\nMotive aside, Crosta said Mr Cocky had taken the shooting stoically.\n\n\u201cHow can I tell you this?,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen we receive a wild bird we first do a triage and if there is a chance we can fix them, we fix them. Otherwise, if the bird cannot go back to the wild, it unfortunately goes immediately to meet its ancestors. In this case we thought, okay, he is moving the wing he seems to be okay, so why not?\u201d\n\nThe shot to the head \u201cdid not seem to affect\u201d the bird and the three to its body had not been causing it considerable discomfort. Crosta will wait until the bird fully recovers before making a decision about whether to remove the final bullet in its shoulder.\n\nHarming wildlife is prohibited by the NSW Biodiversity Conservation Act.\n\nAn individual could face a fine of up to $88,000 for harming an animal such as the sulphur-crested cockatoo.", "description": "The bird, called Mr Cocky by rescuers, was treated at Sydney animal hospital and seems largely unaffected by ordeal", "authors": ["Michael Mcgowan"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53ac506d725739ea3e3620639135fcfae509ccc0/0_112_940_564/master/940.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d629851fb1b5965accf24a7a81206b8f", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
