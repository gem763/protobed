She strived to prove what was written actually works and went through a trial-and-error process. I was impressed.\u201d\n\nWhen the characters of Haga\u2019s essay revealed themselves in the heat, Yamada \u2013 who had promised his students extra marks for creativity \u2013 decided to award her an A.\n\nHaga, 19, made the ink by soaking soya beans overnight and then squeezing them into a paste. She said she had tested three different kinds of paper for the optimum effect.\n\n\u201cIf the paper is too thin, it burns when heated. If it\u2019s too thick, it doesn\u2019t absorb the ink very well,\u201d she said. \u201cI usually use pens and PC to write things. It\u2019s been a while since I took a brush to write with an invisible ink.\u201d\n\nYamada said reports filed as scrolls or folded into throwing stars were the most creative he had seen from students until now. \u201cWe discussed the use of invisible ink but I was amazed that someone actually used it,\u201d he said, adding that he didn\u2019t read the entire paper because he wanted to keep some of Haga\u2019s work invisible.\n\n\u201cBy learning about ninja \u2026 we can apply their knowledge and ways to modern society,\u201d Yamada said.\n\nNinjas were agents revered for their ability to combine stealth and violence in the service of their samurai masters during the \u201cwarring states\u201d period in Japan from the mid-15th century.", "description": "Professor was so impressed with Eimi Haga\u2019s creativity, he didn\u2019t reveal whole text", "authors": ["Agence France-Presse In Tokyo"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d44beee466cf04ae0939e90aa925df6ee5d61e1/0_238_3313_1986/master/3313.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a7a3b991c646a06ac1b5eb1d5c4bde06", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
