Biden, was stepping down from the board of a Chinese-backed firm and that he wouldn\u2019t serve on the boards of foreign companies if his father is elected president.\n\nCNN host Jake Tapper asked if the announcement was a tacit acknowledgment from Hunter Biden and/or the Biden campaign that there was at least an appearance of a conflict of interest issue there that was valid, in light of increasing questions about the younger Mr. Biden\u2019s business ties in Ukraine and China.\n\nBut Mr. Buttigieg declined to take a shot at his 2020 Democratic presidential rival over the issue.\n\nHe called Mr. Trump a \u201cwalking conflict of interest,\u201d pointing to adviser and presidential daughter Ivanka Trump\u2019s benefitting from trademarks from the Chinese and adviser and presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner\u2019s \u201ctexting\u201d with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\n\u201cWhile meanwhile, the president\u2019s sons go around the world pretending like the fact that their father is the president of the United States has no impact on the international business dealings that they do,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t even know whether Trump financial interest[s] in Turkey contributed to the decision to betray American allies and American values, and they want to talk about conflicts of interest - it is a radically different standard and we cannot allow this president to be able to change the subject, especially with unfounded allegations,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
