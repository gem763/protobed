Unless you\u2019ve got a first-generation Watch, you can wear it in the shower, while swimming in a pool or lake, and while running until you sweat. In fact, the Watch doesn\u2019t only keep water out; it can actually expel any excess water that may have gotten into the works.\n\nThere\u2019s a quick way to seal your Watch against water damage before you take a shower or jump in the pool.\n\nSwipe up from the bottom of any screen to open the Command Center\n\nScroll up or down by either rotating the Digital Crown or flicking the screen with your finger until you see the water drop icon. Tap it.\n\nAt that point, a couple of things happen: your Watch seals up its speakers and microphones, and the screen stops responding to taps or swipes.\n\nWhen you get out of the water, rotate the Watch\u2019s crown. The Watch will beep a few times, expel any water that may have gotten into the speakers and mics, and reactivate the screen.\n\nGrid View Before you swim, tap the water drop icon in the Command Center.\n\nWhile it\u2019s sealed, the Watch will not respond to taps or swipes.\n\nRotate the crown, and the Watch will unseal itself and expel any excess water.\n\nYour Watch will also seal itself up if its activity monitor senses that you\u2019re swimming or if you tell it you\u2019re starting a swimming workout. Unlock your Watch when you\u2019re done by rotating the crown.\n\nBe aware that the Watch is only water resistant, not waterproof, meaning it can\u2019t handle lower depths (as in scuba diving) or higher force (like water skiing). In addition, Apple warns that substances like soapy water, lotions, and sunscreen or environments such as steam baths and saunas can eventually wear out the Watch\u2019s water-resistant seals. Finally, check your Watch band; not all are water resistant.\n\nSo enjoy your swim, but don\u2019t get careless.", "description": "There\u2019s a quick way to seal your Apple Watch against water damage before you take a shower or jump in the pool.", "authors": ["Dan Rosenbaum", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aNZnagfKWyLHv_dBi0Qp4gB0KP8=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19208776/vpavic_190913_3669_0246.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
