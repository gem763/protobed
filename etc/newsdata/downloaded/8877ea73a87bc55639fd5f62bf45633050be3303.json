Mac proceeded to publish the email, infuriating Musk, who claimed it was off-record, and not for publication.\n\nOn Friday, BuzzFeed\u2019s legal team filed a motion to quash both Musk and Unsworth subpoenas, saying they were irrelevant and part of an intimidation campaign against BuzzFeed, and that Musk couldn\u2019t be held accountable for the statements simply because he believed they were off the record.\n\nBuzzFeed argued that there was no legal reason Mac was compelled to testify, and that the company had already provided all of Mac\u2019s communications with Musk.\n\nThe company said that Musk \u201cclearly harbors personal animosity against Mac personally,\u201d and that the issue of harassment was \u201cnot a merely hypothetical concern in this case given Musk\u2019s long history of attacking his critics in the press and considering his obvious hostility towards Mac.\u201d\n\nFurther, BuzzFeed suggested there was a more sinister motive for Musk\u2019s subpoena: The billionaire, according to BuzzFeed, had an \u201culterior motive,\u201d and hoped to \u201cturn up something he can use against him later.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is one of the most basic rules of engagement in journalism and, if Musk (a public figure who has freely engaged with journalists for years) regrets the consequences his decision to make unguarded statements to a reporter, he only has himself to blame,\u201d the company said.\n\nRegardless of whether BuzzFeed testifies, Musk likely faces an uphill battle challenging the defamation claim. While his team says Musk\u2019s claims about Unsworth are \u201ctrue or substantially true,\u201d they have not presented evidence supporting its claims about the diver\u2019s allegedly unsavory behavior. Instead, the team has argued that Unsworth brought the outburst on himself by starting the feud.\n\n\u201cBefore Mr. Musk had said anything about Unsworth\u2014or even knew who he was\u2014Mr. Unsworth capped off his attacks on Mr. Musk with the terse suggestion that Mr. Musk take the miniature rescue submarine that he and his engineers had invented and built for the rescue and \u2018stick it where it hurts,\u2019\u201d Musk\u2019s team said earlier this year.", "description": "The media outlet accused the tech billionaire of harassing and intimidating a reporter for printing unguarded comments Musk made accusing a critic of being a pedophile.", "authors": ["Maxwell Tani", "Media Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568417458/190913-tani-musk-buzzfeed-tease_w3kink", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
