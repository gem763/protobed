The positive outcome for Westpac over ASIC has probably helped to alleviate some of the focus on discretionary spending, with lenders likely to focus more on non-discretionary spending behaviour that would be difficult to change once being approved for a loan.\u2019\u2019\n\nImportantly, he says, the outcome of Westpac v ASIC affirms that pre-loan spending behaviours aren\u2019t necessarily reflected in behaviour post-loan.\n\n\u201cBorrowers can modify their expenses for discretionary spending such as luxury items, dining out or entertainment, but non-discretionary spends such as utility bills and other debt repayments are much harder to reduce.\u201d\n\nIn other words: caviar and cabernet and the cleaner are on the chopping block, but power, water and solid Wi-Fi are non-negotiable.\n\nAnd increased competition will be at the centre of the coming recovery, he says.\n\nHard bargain\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember a time when the mortgage market has been more competitive than it is at the moment,\u201d Lawless says.\n\n\u201cThe banking sector is losing market share to non-banks \u2013 and digital banks are emerging as another source of lending. For \u2018high quality\u2019 borrowers (borrowers with a larger deposit and high income relative to their debt) this means they can drive a hard bargain and secure extremely low mortgage rates.\n\n\u201cBorrowers who are less credit worthy (smaller deposits and a higher ratio of debt relative to income) may not be able to secure the best loan terms despite such stiff competition amongst lenders.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd mortgage brokers will help \u2013 albeit in a complex landscape.\n\n\u201cThe mortgage environment is arguably more complex than it has ever been with such a broad range of products, differential interest rates and add-ons,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cMortgage brokers are playing an increasingly important role in helping consumers navigate this complexity to choose the most appropriate lender and product based on the borrower\u2019s individual needs and the quality of their application.\u201d\n\nAccording to research from Comparator, mortgage brokers were involved with 56 per cent of all loans originated over the June quarter, which was a record for any June quarter share of market.\n\n\u201cThe result highlights that consumers are relying on the services of mortgage brokers more than they ever have in the past.\u201d\n\nAussie Home Loans chairman John Symond. John Veage\n\nAussie supremo John Symond agrees: \u201cToday\u2019s property market has all the right conditions: it\u2019s steady, we\u2019ve got low interest rates and national average auction clearance rates are above 75 per cent.\u201d\n\nAnd what does the future hold?\n\nLawless says: \u201cLenders are rebuilding trust following the royal commission and they are doubling down on their service offering.\n\n\u201cMortgage brokers have demonstrated their value by offering a service that cuts through the complexity of the market via a strong service offering that appeals to consumers.\n\n\u201cNo doubt lenders will be keen to match the broker service offering, and we can already see this from mobile lenders who can travel to meet prospective borrowers and work to more flexible hours.\u201d", "description": "Property market begins to recover as record low interest rates and easier home loan serviceability assessments combined with increasing competition among lenders begin to take effect.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1936%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/2d4340c66766033b2363a458928bfa08cdbc624a", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
