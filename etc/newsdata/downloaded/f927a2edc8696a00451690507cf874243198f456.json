But it appears to have pursued only one seriously: the Steele dossier. The Clinton-Libya file, on the other hand, you've never heard of, until now. Mark Hemingway reports the details:\n\nDocuments quietly posted online by the FBI in June allege longtime Clinton operative Sidney Blumenthal tried to exploit his relationship with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to make millions repatriating $66 billion stolen from Libya by Moammar Gadhafi.\n\nThere is little indication the FBI investigated the allegations, which it received from sources connected to Republicans.\n\nThe FBI received the documents in mid-2016, around the same time it launched an exhaustive investigation of the Trump campaign\u2019s ties to Russia, which relied on private sources connected to Democrats.\n\nOne FBI agent played an especially pivotal role in dealing with both matters: Peter Strzok , who would eventually be fired by the bureau because of his anti-Trump bias.\n\nLater, Blumenthal worked with Cody Shearer, another Clinton operative, to circulate the Steele dossier\u2019s anti-Trump claims.\n\nThe Trump Investigations: Top Articles\n\nTrump Loose Lips Tied to 2017 Removal of Top Spy From Russia, CNN\n\n'No Public Evidence' Trump Imperiled CIA Spy Who Left Russia, NY Times\n\nAbout That Sketchy Russian Spy Exfiltration Story, Conservative Treehouse\n\nHiding in Plain Sight, Can Ex-CIA Spy Survive Putin\u2019s Assassins?, Daily Beast\n\nLate Obama State Dept.

But recently declassified cables reveal in new detail interrogators\u2019 attempts to transform detainees into collaborators in the war against Al Qaeda. They display in cold bureaucratic prose the thinking behind tactics many consider torture, including waterboarding and sleep deprivation. And they exhibit a committed belief that enhanced measures always move detainees closer to an imagined breaking point that, once met, force them to produce more accurate information \u2014 a belief that a 2014 Senate torture report disputed.\n\nJustify Failed a Drug Test Before Winning the Triple Crown\n\nNew York Times\n\nJustify may be the Lance Armstrong of thoroughbreds. The horse that electrified the sport in 2018 by becoming just the 13th winner of the Triple Crown, failed a drug test just weeks before the Kentucky Derby. That meant Justify should not have run in the Derby, if the sport\u2019s rules were followed. They were not, according to documents reviewed by The New York Times. Instead of the failed drug test causing a speedy disqualification, the California Horse Racing Board took more than a month to confirm the results. Then, instead of filing a public complaint as it usually does, the board made a series of decisions behind closed doors as it moved to drop the case and lighten the penalty for any horse found to have the banned substance that Justify tested positive for in its system.\n\nSome Women Seek Abortions Out of State Amid Restrictions\n\nAssociated Press\n\nAt least 276,000 women went to another state to end a pregnancy between 2012 and 2017, some evidently in response to the home state's abortion restrictions. In New Mexico, for example, the number of women from out of state who had abortions more than doubled in that period, while Missouri women represented nearly half the abortions performed in neighboring Kansas. Still, the data are murky. Georgia\u2019s share of abortions involving women from out-of-state rose from 11.5% to 15% during that period while North Carolina saw its share increase from 16.6% to 18.5% - even though both states have passed restrictive laws. In addition, the share of women who had abortions out of state rose slightly, by half a percentage point.\n\nWhen Medicaid Takes Everything You\u2019ve Left Your Heirs\n\nThe Atlantic\n\nMedicaid, the government program that provides health care to more than 75 million low-income and disabled Americans, isn\u2019t necessarily free. It\u2019s the only major welfare program that can function like a loan. If they have the resources, Medicaid recipients over the age of 55 are expected to repay the government, and to satisfy the debt states will seize houses and other assets after those recipients die. This story focuses on a family whose mother\u2019s estate owed almost $200,000 \u2013 a sum that would require her survivors to sell the family home. Opponents of so-called estate recovery say the harm of destabilizing low-income families does not justify the meager returns. \u201cIt\u2019s a drop in the bucket given the amount of misery they cause people,\u201d says one.\n\nHate-Crime Spike in New York Has Nothing to Do With White Supremacy\n\nNational Review\n\nMayor Bill de Blasio has attributed the spike in anti-Semitic attacks in New York City to white supremacists emboldened by Donald Trump. This article challenges that assertion. It reports that none of the suspects in any of New York City's reported anti-Jewish crimes had any previous arrests for hate crimes or any background in hate-related activities. In addition, many of the attacks were perpetrated by people of color. In 2017 and 2018, 37 blacks and 46 whites were arrested for anti-Jewish hate crimes, the majority of which were for property vandalism and harassment \u2014 statistics consistent with national data.\n\nNew Sources Come Forward in NY Times Reporters' Book on Weinstein\n\nNew York Times\n\nTwo years before the allegations of sexual harassment and abuse against Harvey Weinstein became public, his own brother and business partner, Bob Weinstein, confronted him, pleading with him to get medical treatment for what he described as many years of \u201cmisbehavior.\u201d \u201cYou have brought shame to the family and your company through your misbehavior,\u201d Bob Weinstein wrote. The previously unreported letter is reprinted in full in \u201cShe Said: Breaking the Sexual Harassment Story That Helped Ignite a Movement,\u201d a new book by Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey of the New York Times. It uncovers more of the extent of Weinstein\u2019s alleged transgressions, and the labyrinth of secret settlements and restrictive nondisclosure agreements that allowed Mr. Weinstein and other men in positions of power to conceal their behavior and thrive in their careers and find new victims.\n\nBlasey Ford's Dad Backed Kavanaugh\n\nThe Federalist\n\nWhen Christine Blasey Ford testified before the Senate on alleged sexual misconduct by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, some observers found it uprising that her parents, who lived in the D.C. area, did not attend the hearing to support her. This article reports that the Blasey family had significant doubts about what she was up to. Within days of Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation, the father of the new justice was approached by Ford\u2019s father at the golf club where they are both members. \u201cI\u2019m glad Brett was confirmed,\u201d Ralph Blasey told Ed Kavanaugh, shaking his hand. Blasey added that the ordeal had been tough for both families.\n\nHow John Roberts Killed the Census Citizenship Question\n\nCNN\n\nChief Justice John Roberts cast the deciding vote against President Trump's attempt to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, but only after changing his position behind the scenes, sources familiar with the private Supreme Court deliberations tell CNN. Roberts' action recalled his dramatic switch in the 2012 case that saved President Obama's Affordable Care Act. Once again, the chief, an appointee of President George W. Bush and usually a conservative, had sided with the liberals as a dispute of immense national significance went down to the wire.\n\nDid the Heir to the Red Bull Empire Get Away With Murder?\n\nWalrus\n\nIn the early morning of Sept. 3, 2012, a Bangkok playboy roared his Ferrari down Sukhumvit Road, slamming into a motorcycle cop, dragging the officer, along with his tangled bike, down the block to his death. The playboy, Vorayuth \u201cBoss\u201d Yoovidhya, scion of a founder of Red Bull energy drinks, immediately fled the scene. Locals like to say that Thai jails are only for the poor. Boss seems to be living proof. Seven years later, the prosecution has been indefinitely delayed even as the statute of limitations is expiring on potential charges. The times when Boss has been called into court, he hasn\u2019t shown up. In fact, within weeks of the incident, Boss was back to enjoying his family\u2019s jet-set lifestyle. He flew around the world on private Red Bull jets, cheered the company\u2019s Formula One racing team from Red Bull\u2019s VIP seats, and kept a shiny black Porsche Carrera in London with custom license plates\u2014B055 RBR, or Boss Red Bull racing.\n\nThe Last of the Dunk Tank Clowns\n\nNew York Times\n\nDavid Simmons is a dunk-tank clown. He makes a living by shouting insults at passers-by at America\u2019s small-town fairgrounds: the weight of a man\u2019s date, or the cheap finish of a woman\u2019s fake gold hoop earrings. He hopes to rile them enough to spend $2 to exact a watery payback. This article reports that dunk tank clowns are fading away in a world where Americans are beginning to believe that cracking jokes about people\u2019s skin color, size, poverty or intelligence is maybe not a good thing. \u201cThey\u2019re retiring left and right,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cThey\u2019re being run out of town.\u201d Our taste for insults seems to be evaporating.
