I need to bat big like the Indian team has done and score big runs.\u201d\n\nOpening batsman Dean Elgar has been the only standout South Africa performer with his 160 in the first match.\n\nDu Plessis said his side needed to change its mentality to compete against the hosts.\n\n\u201cHow can the batsman be hungry for big runs? From the bowling point of view how can we get 20 wickets? We haven\u2019t done that this series,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf we do those things, we will compete with India.\u201d\n\nDespite having lost the series, du Plessis said the Ranchi game was still important as points in the new ICC World Test Championship were still up for grabs.\n\nIndia consolidated their number one position in the championship table after collecting 80 points from their first two Test wins. The Proteas are in a lowly seventh place.\n\nSouth Africa were dealt a blow ahead of the final Test after Aiden Markram was ruled out after injuring his wrist lashing out at a \u201csolid object\u201d in Pune.\n\nThe incident happened \u201cin frustration\u201d after Markram, who has apologised to the rest of the team, was out for his second duck of the second Test in Pune.\n\nBut Du Plessis was guarded on what Markram\u2019s absence meant for the Proteas\u2019 line-up.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t want to give away too much. We are a making a few changes to the side. The batting order will change,\u201d du Plessis said.", "description": "Ranchi (India) (AFP) \u2013 Skipper Faf du Plessis hopes to \u201cbat big\u201d as South Africa look to salvage some honour in their final game against", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/17/03b3f2_du-plessis-his-needed-change-its-mentality-compete-india-losing-test-series-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
