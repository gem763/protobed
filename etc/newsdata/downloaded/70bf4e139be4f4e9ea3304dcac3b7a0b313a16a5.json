Now the chairman is operating under this mandate and mantle of the Speaker of the House that this is impeachment, this is very serious, and you have to cooperate. You can\u2019t go to court. You can\u2019t have a judge test this. Because if you try to do that, that\u2019s contempt. So it\u2019s a gotcha moment, which I think, again, we\u2019re setting one bad precedent after another.\n\nJON SCOTT: Without a vote of the full House, there are many legal scholars who argue that there is no impeachment proceeding that the White House can obstruct because the House hasn\u2019t voted on it.\n\nSTARR: And those scholars have tradition and history on their side, but what they don\u2019t have on their side is the text of the Constitution. And the text of the Constitution just entrusts [impeachment] to the good judgment, whether it\u2019s being exercised or not, to the House of Representatives. I don\u2019t think any court is likely to quarrel, ultimately, with that. But history will, I think, judge this not well. It should judge this not well. [You] didn\u2019t have a full debate on the floor of the House \u2014 and that just lends itself, then, to, \u201cwell, let\u2019s go to court and have this litigated.\u201d And of course, the chairman then says, \u201cyou go to court, you\u2019re in contempt.\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\nFor the chairman [Schiff] to, today, essentially declare guilt, I think, again, is another procedural irregularity. He should try his best\u2026 to give the appearance of fairness and open-mindedness. He\u2019s already declared \u2014 I mean, we heard him \u2014 he\u2019s declared the president substantively guilty, as well as procedurally guilty.", "description": "Ken Starr said history will frown upon the House Democrats' secret impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/wi/afp/30/463745_house-intelligence-committee-chairman-adam-schiff-democrat-leading-impeachment-e1572370542581-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
