James shook him off.\n\nChirinos put down the same signal.\n\n\u201cIt was one of those situations where I trusted him,\u201d James said. \u201cHe knew what to call and I just threw it.\u201d\n\nJames\u2019 second changeup spun off the inside corner and would have been ball four, but Zimmerman swung over it. The Nationals wasted an opportunity yet again as the Astros won 4-1 Friday night and clawed back to 2-1 in the World Series after losing the first two games at home.\n\nAstros pitchers baffled batters when it mattered most, shutting down an October offense of uncanny timeliness.\n\nWashington had a .314 average with runners in scoring position in its first 12 postseason games, 68 points higher than any of the other nine postseason teams. The Nationals threatened in each of the first six innings Friday but went 0 for 10 with runners in scoring position and stranded 12. On a night of pitching dangerously, Zack Greinke and the Astros\u2019 bullpen kept escaping.\n\n\u201cA lot more runs could have been scored there,\u201d Zimmerman said. \u201cHad a chance a couple times but, yeah, that\u2019s baseball.\u201d\n\nHouston pitchers had just one 1-2-3 inning, by Will Harris in the seventh, just the fourth time the Astros retired the side in order in the Series.\n\nUnsustainable in the long run, but on this night good enough.\n\nChirinos, who also homered Friday, spent six hours watching video before Game 1 at Minute Maid Park, examining Nationals\u2019 plate appearances all the way back to 2017.\n\n\u201cJust trying to look for anything I can take advantage in,\u201d he said.\n\nHe spent two-to-three hours at Nationals Park on Friday reviewing the first two games.\n\n\u201cHow they\u2019re taking spins, how they\u2019re swinging at fastballs, where they\u2019re putting better swings,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in the World Series. You have to put the time, the effort in this situation.\u201d\n\nJames relieved Greinke after Asdr\u00fabal Cabrera\u2019s two-out double put runners on second third. James\u2019 0-2 pitch sent Zimmerman sprawling, a 98 mph fastball near the batter\u2019s head.\n\n\u201cI think it scared me more than anything, but that\u2019s part of the game,\u201d said Zimmerman, who was slow to get up.\n\nZimmerman took two balls, fouled off two, and took the first changeup. Then came the key moment.\n\n\u201cI know Zimmerman chases the changeup,\u201d Chirinos said. \u201cJJ wanted to throw the slider. I didn\u2019t think it was the right pitch in that situation. Something I saw.\u201d\n\nJames wasn\u2019t hard to persuade.\n\n\u201cI knew if I got it relatively in the zone, around the zone, I could get him to swing, hopefully some soft contact or get him to swing and miss,\u201d he explained.\n\nJames, who got the win, combined with Brad Peacock, Will Harris, Joe Smith and Roberto Osuna for 4 1/3 innings of shutout, two-hit relief.\n\nGreinke, pitching four days after his 36th birthday, was 0-2 with a 6.43 ERA in his first three starts. He displayed his broad repertoire against the Nationals, mixing four-seam fastballs (39) and two-seamers (six) with curveballs (18), changeups (18) and sliders (14) to keep batters off-balance.\n\n\u201cWe were kind of surprised early that they were swinging at Zack\u2019s curveball,\u201d said Chirinos, who was so alarmed at Washington\u2019s approach that Houston checked video to make sure Greinke wasn\u2019t tipping the curves.\n\nGreinke\u2019s fastest pitch was 93 mph, and his slowest 67. He struck out Juan Soto, playing on his 21st birthday, on a 72 mph curve to strand a runner at second in the first inning, fanned Cabrera on a curve with two on to end the third and retired Trea Turner with a curve hit for a grounder to leave a runner at third base in the fourth.\n\nWith two on in the second, Victor Robles grounded a fastball for a 5-4-3 double play.\n\n\u201cHe toys with the strike zone. He never really concedes,\u201d Astros manager AJ Hinch said. \u201cHe would rather pitch carefully to you than necessarily throw a ball right down the middle.\u201d\n\nGreinke fell one out short of getting the win but was more concerned about taxing his bullpen ahead of Houston\u2019s all-reliever pitching plan for Game 4 Saturday.\n\n\u201cWe might have used a guy a little more, to make it a little harder for tomorrow,\u201d he said.\n\nOsuna, booed loudly when he entered, froze Soto with a 99 mph fastball for a called third strike to end it. The Astros lined up in front of the third-base dugout for handshakes.\n\n\u201cIt brings a lot of confidence back,\u201d he said.\n\nHouston managed to avoid a sweep. And maybe more.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Josh James sailed a changeup high and tight to Ryan Zimmerman, going to a full count with two on and the Houston Astros clinging to a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
