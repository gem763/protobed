((Singaporean Ministry of Communications and Information))\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 President Trump may be distracted by the pitched political battle over his possible impeachment, but he\u2019s still locked in a far larger war.\n\nAt the dais of the U.N. General Assembly this week, Trump renewed his attacks on China, decrying Beijing\u2019s \u201ceconomic model dependent on massive market barriers, heavy state subsidies, currency manipulation, product dumping, forced technology transfers and the theft of intellectual property and also trade secrets on a grand scale.\u201d\n\nIn a briefing with reporters, Trump suggested that the increased pressure of his trade war was costing China jobs and sending Chinese supply chains \u201cto hell.\u201d The two countries are preparing for the next round of talks in October, with the threat of new U.S. tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods still hanging over proceedings. Trump welcomed recent Chinese moves to increase purchases of U.S. agricultural products but probably won\u2019t relent on tougher U.S. demands regarding how China administers its economy.\n\n\u201cYou know they want to make a deal and they should want to make a deal,\u201d Trump said, indicating that he believed the United States has the upper hand. \u201cThe question is: Do we want to make a deal?\u201d\n\nFor their part, the Chinese cautioned Trump from pushing too hard. \u201cSeventy years on, it is important for the United States to avoid picking another misguided fight with the wrong country,\u201d Foreign Minister Wang Yi said at a business event in Manhattan, referring to the advent of the communist People\u2019s Republic in 1949. He said the United States had little reason to see China as a rival superpower and claimed his government had \u201cno intention to play the game of thrones on the world stage.\u201d\n\nSigned the Protocol of Amendment to the 1990 MOU Regarding US Use of Facilities in Singapore with US President @realDonaldTrump today. Look forward to strengthening cooperation between the US and Singapore. \u2013 LHL \ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 pic.twitter.com/K4RLCxxQBF \u2014 Lee Hsien Loong (@leehsienloong) September 23, 2019\n\nSingaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong is hoping cooler heads will prevail. But he\u2019s not sure they will. Both China and the United States \u201chave hardened their positions,\u201d Lee said in an interview with Today\u2019s WorldView this week. He suggested the maximalist view of the dispute \u2014 seeing the tensions as \u201ca conflict between two systems, almost two civilizations\u201d \u2014 seems prevalent and is \u201cvery worrying\u201d for the world.\n\n\u201cThis is not a struggle which can end up with one loser and one winner,\u201d said Lee.\n\nYet, those are precisely the terms Trump and some of his hawkish allies have framed in their confrontation with the Chinese. Talk of a \u201cdecoupling\u201d between the world\u2019s two biggest economies \u2014 once a fantastical notion \u2014 appears to be gaining traction. Even in a divided Washington, antipathy to China and an eagerness to curb its rise has essentially become a bipartisan position.\n\n\u201cYou wanted an open-door policy on the Chinese,\u201d Lee said, gesturing to a rosier period in Sino-U.S. relations. \u201cNow, if the U.S. does not want an open-door policy anymore, where is your part of the world, and who will be in your system?\u201d Lee asked. All of the United States\u2019 partners and allies \u201care so deeply enmeshed with the Chinese,\u201d he argued, that forcing them to \u201cdisentangle\u201d from Beijing would be \u201ca very challenging strategic stance to take.\u201d\n\nFor Lee, whose country does roaring business with China and maintains close military and economic ties with the United States, the situation is \u201csad\u201d and \u201ctroublesome.\u201d He worries the hostility toward Beijing that\u2019s widespread among the American foreign policy establishment is \u201coverblown\u201d and could become a \u201cself-validating narrative,\u201d deepening a climate of tensions that some analysts already cast as the 21st century Cold War.\n\n\u201cI think it is very unlikely that you can treat the Chinese the same way that you treated the Soviet Union,\u201d Lee warned, referring to decades of an official American policy of Soviet containment. \u201cEven in the case of the Soviet Union from 1946, when you had George Kennan, to 1989 when the Berlin Wall fell, it was 40-something years before their system collapsed.\u201d He added that \u201cthe Chinese have looked at the Soviet example. They studied it minutely and are absolutely determined not to go in that direction.\u201d\n\nBut the Singaporean leader argued the Chinese, too, ought to reconsider their approach. China needs to recognize it\u2019s no longer the enfeebled nation wronged by 19th-century European colonial powers or even the waking giant that was brought into the World Trade Organization in 2001.\n\n\u201cThey have to take their share of responsibility upholding and supporting the global system,\u201d he said. \u201cThat requires a reset of their status, a reset of their mind-set to know that while they may not be a fully developed country yet, they already have to take on responsibilities and make adjustments which may well be politically difficult to do, but are necessary if they are going to live peacefully and to be seen as a constructive player in the world.\u201d\n\nBut Lee also recognized that neither Trump nor Chinese President Xi Jinping have much room to maneuver. Trump wants a fundamental rebalancing of the U.S. relationship with Beijing and won\u2019t want to concede much to Chinese negotiators amid a reelection campaign. Xi, meanwhile, is grappling with a slowdown and \u201cvery difficult structural problems within the economy,\u201d said Lee. The political unrest in Hong Kong \u2014 and other challenges to \u201cinternal cohesion,\u201d as Lee delicately put it, including the detentions of possibly millions of Turkic Muslim minorities in the far-western region of Xinjiang \u2014 further complicate matters for Beijing.\n\nLee Kuan Yew, Lee\u2019s late father and Singapore\u2019s founding leader, was widely admired by a generation of political elites elsewhere as a venerable 20th-century statesman and a clear-eyed thinker on world affairs. Now, his son wants to see \u201cstatesmanship, consistency, perseverance and wisdom\u201d from both the Americans and Chinese, though he\u2019s circumspect about the present ability of either side to find a shared \u201cmodus vivendi.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think, from America\u2019s point of view, you will be right to conclude they are not going to become like you,\u201d Lee said. \u201cBut on the other hand, you have to ask yourself: Is it better for them to be like this and quite powerful, or is it better for them to be like they were when, during the days of Mao [Zedong], when they were much less prosperous or powerful but much more hostile and troublesome?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have to find the right combination of pressure and negotiation, of action and talk, which will lead to a calibrated and constructive outcome,\u201d Lee advised. \u201cIt cannot just be maximum pressure and hope for total collapse of the other party. It will not happen.\u201d\n\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday, along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions?
