But there's no denying the boomers will be market force, it's just not certain how they will impact the markets. Right now, workers over the age of 55 years represent a near-record 24% of all U.S. employees, according to the BLS.\n\nOne such study on the theory that has raised alarm\u2014 and the one cited by Darby \u2014 comes from Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco in 2011, which found evidence that U.S. equity values are tied to the age distribution of the population. Such a relationship, the paper concluded, implies that prices could slump until 2025 until millennials start buying back the stocks their parents and grandparents ditched.\n\n\"There has been a tight correlation between population dependency ratios ... and the P/E ratio of the U.S. stock market,\" Fed researchers Zheng Liu and Mark Spiegel wrote. \"In the context of the impending retirement of baby boomers over the next two decades, this correlation portends poorly for equity values.\"\n\n\"Market participants may anticipate that equities will perform poorly in the future, an expectation that can potentially depress current stock prices,\" they wrote.\n\nBut in addition to a possible uptick in foreign investment, Jefferies believes fears of a decadelong slog for stocks are overblown.\n\nDarby noted that a 2006 Government Accountability Office report showed that macroeconomic and financial factors explained much more the variation in stock returns between 1948 and 2004 despite changes in population age over the 56-year period, the Jefferies strategist wrote.\n\n\"The bottom line is that the 2006 GAO study suggests that retiring boomers are not likely to sell financial assets in such a way as to cause a sharp and sudden decline in prices,\" the Jefferies strategist wrote.\n\nInstead, increased life expectancy could both smooth and extend retiree asset sales over a longer period, while many may opt to work beyond the traditional retirement age, he added.", "description": "Jefferies analysts discuss an economic theory that the impending wave of baby boomer retirements could trigger a U.S. equity slump.", "authors": ["Thomas Franck"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105131112-GettyImages-80639420.jpg?v=1569324127", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
