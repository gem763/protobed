I\u2019m happy, like you and Portia (de Rossi, DeGeneres' wife).\n\n\u201cMaybe even happier than you and Portia. I hear you guys fight,\u201d Stern joked.\n\nSurprise!: Beth Stern agrees to remarry Howard Stern after proposal on 'Jimmy Kimmel'\n\nHoward Stern on apologizing to Robin Williams, turning down Trump, grilling Weinstein\n\n\"So, I go on Jimmy\u2019s show, and I thought it would be funny if I proposed to show him how she will turn me down,\" he recalled. \"And, I got on one knee, and I said, \u2018Darling, I love you.\u2019 And it was going to be great. It was gonna get big laughs when she turned me down, and she said yes, she would marry me. I don\u2019t know why. That ruined the bit.\u201d\n\nDeGeneres then explained that she knew the couple watches \"The Bachelor,\" and as a special treat, former lead of the dating show Colton Underwood had been ordained in order to perform their vow renewal.\n\nIn front of an arch covered with flowers and Underwood, Beth gushed over her husband and had a very important question for him.\n\n\"Howard is so romantic. He is the most romantic man,\" the animal lover said. \"Every day, he tells me how beautiful I am. He knows I'm very insecure, and every day, he tells me he wants to remarry me, and I didn't know I was part of a bit that I was supposed to say no yesterday. I'm learning that for the first time today So, do you want to marry me?\"\n\n\"I so want to marry you,\" Stern assured her, \"and I vow to you, if you remarry me, I promise you for the rest of my life to watch 'The Bachelor' with you, in bed, every single night, and 'Bachelor in Paradise.' \"\n\nThe two then exchanged vows once more.\n\n'Dearest, most favorite friend': Ellen emerges for pal Jennifer Aniston after Bush fracas\n\nHoward Stern re-proposes to Beth Stern on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" (Photo: Randy Holmes/ABC)\n\nBut that wasn't the only kiss shared Monday.

Bush at a football game on Oct. 6.\n\n\"People have this picture in their mind of you and George Bush,\" Stern said. \"What you need to do \u2013 in my opinion \u2013 is take a picture with me, making out with me.\"\n\n\"Now just hear me out,\" Stern said after getting some resistance from DeGeneres. \"I was just thinking once people see me with you, no one's gonna be thinking about George Bush.\"\n\n\"I see,\" DeGeneres said. \"Oh, that's true.\"\n\n\"You OK with this?\" Stern asked getting ready for their kiss.\n\n\"Nothing worse can happen to me now,\" DeGeneres quipped.\n\nAfter setting the boundary of \"no tongue,\" the two touched lips for a few seconds.\n\nOn her program, DeGeneres said she and the former nation's leader were \"friends\" and defended her choice to take in the game beside him.
