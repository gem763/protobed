REUTERS/Alberto Lingria\n\nThe admission by Pompeo, a key Trump ally, moved the top U.S. diplomat closer to the center of the scandal and raised further questions about his role in the administration\u2019s interactions with Ukraine, including the recall of the U.S. ambassador to Kiev earlier this year.\n\nThe Democratic-led House last week launched its impeachment inquiry, which threatens Trump\u2019s presidency, in the aftermath of a complaint brought by a whistleblower within the U.S. intelligence community over Trump\u2019s request to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy during a July 25 phone call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nBiden is a leading contender for the Democratic nomination to challenge Trump in the 2020 presidential election. Democrats have accused Trump of pressuring a vulnerable U.S. ally to interfere in the 2020 U.S. election to harm a domestic political rival for Trump\u2019s personal political benefit.\n\n\u201cI was on the phone call,\u201d Pompeo told reporters during a visit to Italy.\n\nPompeo said the call was in the context of U.S. policymaking in Ukraine, including \u201ctaking down the Russia threat,\u201d rooting out corruption in government and boosting the economy. The Wall Street Journal first reported that Pompeo was on the call.\n\nTrump made his request to Zelenskiy shortly after he had frozen nearly $400 million in U.S. aid to Ukraine. Zelenskiy agreed to Trump\u2019s request on the call. The aid money was later provided to Ukraine. Democrats have accused Trump of using taxpayer money as leverage on Ukraine.\n\nTrump, who is seeking a second four-year term as president, has denied wrongdoing and has assailed the impeachment probe.\n\nIn an intensifying battle between House Democrats and Trump\u2019s administration, Democratic-led committees have subpoenaed Pompeo and Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, as well as documents. They will begin depositions of current and former State Department officials this week.\n\nThe department\u2019s inspector general, Steve Linick, was due to brief congressional staff on Wednesday to address Ukraine-related documents that have been subpoenaed, according to two sources familiar with the situation.\n\n\u2018FUNDAMENTAL VALUES\u2019\n\nPompeo on Tuesday objected to House efforts to obtain depositions and accused Democrats of bullying and intimidation.\n\nAsked about his concerns, Pompeo said State Department employees had been contacted directly by lawmakers or their staff and told not to talk to the State Department\u2019s legal counsel. He said, however, that he would cooperate with Congress.\n\n\u201cWe will of course do our constitutional duty to cooperate with this co-equal branch but we are going to do so in a way that is consistent with the fundamental values of the American system,\u201d Pompeo said.\n\nThe Democratic chairmen of three House committees have accused Pompeo of intimidating witnesses, and said doing so is illegal. They warned Pompeo on Tuesday that he is considered \u201ca fact witness in the House impeachment inquiry\u201d based on his role in Trump\u2019s call with Zelenskiy.\n\nHouse Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings intends to subpoena the White House for Ukraine-related records on Friday after what he described as \u201cflagrant disregard of multiple voluntary requests for documents,\u201d according to a memo he sent to the panel.\n\nAccording to a summary of the July call released by the White House, Trump asked Zelenskiy to investigate Biden and his son Hunter in coordination with U.S. Attorney General William Barr and Giuliani.\n\nHunter Biden had sat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company that had been under investigation by Kiev.\n\nThe prospect that Trump solicited Ukraine\u2019s help against his potential challenger next year has infuriated Democrats, many of whom blame the loss of the 2016 presidential election on Russian interference. Moscow has denied interfering in that campaign.\n\nOn Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said he saw no evidence of pressure in Trump\u2019s July conversation with Zelenskiy and added that there was nothing wrong with the U.S. president asking for an investigation into potential corruption.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies and Special Counsel Robert Mueller concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 election with a scheme of hacking and propaganda to boost the Republican Trump\u2019s candidacy and disparage his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton.\n\nKurt Volker, who resigned last Friday as Trump\u2019s special representative for Ukraine, was scheduled to go to Capitol Hill to give a deposition to House staff on Thursday, the day he had been asked to appear. Marie Yovanovitch, who was U.S. ambassador to Ukraine until she was abruptly recalled in May, has agreed to appear on Oct. 11. In his phone call with Zelenskiy, Trump called Yovanovitch \u201cbad news.\u201d\n\nWith their deep knowledge of Ukraine, testimony by Yovanovitch and Volker could be especially important to the impeachment probe.\n\nThe inquiry could lead to approval of articles of impeachment - or formal charges - against Trump in the House. That would lead to a trial in the Senate on whether to remove him from office. The president\u2019s fellow Republicans control the Senate and have shown little appetite for removing him.", "description": "Secretary of State Mike Pompeo acknowledged on Wednesday that he listened in on the telephone call between Donald Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart that prompted a House of Representatives impeachment inquiry against the Republican U.S. president.", "authors": ["David Brunnstrom", "Patricia Zengerle", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436252999&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF910YN-OCATP"}
