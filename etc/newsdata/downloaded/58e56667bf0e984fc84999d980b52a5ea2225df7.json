Instead, it has information about land claim agreements, treaty areas, traditional lands, Indigenous languages and forced population movements of Canada's Indigenous peoples.\n\n\"It's so completely different from anything we've ever seen,\" said Charlene Bearhead, an Indigenous education advocate who worked on the project.\n\nAlthough it's produced by the Royal Canadian Geographical Society, more than 100 Indigenous storytellers, knowledge keepers and writers contributed to creation of the atlas, said Bearhead. She said all decisions for the atlas were made by Indigenous peoples.\n\nThe four-volume atlas is not only a map; it's an encyclopedia about the various Indigenous groups of Canada \u2014 from First Nations to Inuit.\n\nThese are the four volumes included in the atlas. They touch on truth and reconciliation, and include information about the different Indigenous groups in Canada.

There's not a political boundary on it,\" said Bearhead.\n\n'She started to cry'\n\n\"I hope that the youth will feel proud of their people, of where they come from,\" said Karen Wright-Fraser, a Gwich'in contributor to the project. \"We don't have too much of that.\"\n\nNow they're going to see themselves. And they're going to feel like we matter. - Karen Wright-Fraser, Gwich'in contributor\n\nShe recalled a special moment when an Indigenous educator shared an emotional testimony in a sharing circle.\n\n\"She started to cry. And she said the youth that she works with in the school have never seen their name on a map,\" said Wright-Fraser. \"Now they're going to see themselves. And they're going to feel like we matter.\"\n\nWright-Fraser holds the Inuit volume of the atlas. She says she hopes that youth will feel proud of their people after learning from these textbooks. (Priscilla Hwang/CBC)\n\nWright-Fraser pointed out the blurb that starts each of the volumes.\n\n\"'Indigenous perspectives much older than the nation itself,\"' said Wright-Fraser, reading from the page. \"I love it.\"\n\nThe project was produced in partnership with organizations like Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, the Assembly of First Nations, the M\u00e9tis National Council, the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation, and Indspire.\n\nThe atlas isn't available in stores until Sept. 20, but people are flocking to pre-order it.\n\nBearhead said she believes every school district in the country should have at least one of these kits.\n\nWith files from Rachel Zelniker, Lawrence Nayally", "description": "The Indigenous Peoples Map of Canada shows the country without provincial or territorial boundaries.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4807558.1535760969!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/karen-wright-fraser.JPG"}
