It only took him nine years to give us a second film. Photo: Courtesy of IFC Films\n\nChris Morris, the 57-year-old English writer, comedian, and director, is both revered and reviled. He came up angering the masses with his breakneck parodies of news media, The Day Today (co-created by Armando Iannucci) and Brass Eye, programs that predated Jon Stewart\u2019s The Daily Show. Arguably more radical and surreal than their various spawn, the satirical shows allowed for Morris to, for example, trick members of Parliament into somberly weighing in on a nonexistent Czechoslovakian drug called Cake. On an infamous one-off edition of Brass Eye, 2001\u2019s \u201cPaedogeddon!\u201d special, he tackled moral panic around pedophilia by duping Phil Collins, among other celebrities, into supporting a fake charity, Nonce Sense. (If you\u2019re familiar with British slang, you get it.) Channel 4 reportedly received 2,000 complaints after it aired.\n\nIn 2010, Morris reinvented himself as a movie director with Four Lions, a tightrope act of a comedy about a pack of bungling would-be jihadists, starring a young Riz Ahmed. The film prompted critic Andrew Pulven to declare in the Guardian, \u201cChris Morris is still the most incendiary figure working in the British entertainment industry.\u201d Nearly a decade later, Morris is back with his follow-up, The Day Shall Come, a movie he once again co-wrote with Succession creator Jesse Armstrong. Like Four Lions, it\u2019s a tricky attempt at getting laughs out of impossibly dark subject matter. The topic is ginned-up FBI stings in which hapless nobodies get reinvented as terror masterminds. The stories are manifold and depressingly familiar: an FBI informant finds a susceptible target with extreme leanings and offers money, encouragement, and weapons \u2014 and, eventually, the FBI has an alleged massive terror-plot bust to crow about. In The Day Shall Come, newcomer March\u00e1nt Davis plays Moses Al Shabaz, a lovable dummy and would-be revolutionary who gets manipulated by Anna Kendrick\u2019s ambitious, conflicted FBI agent. (Her read on Moses: \u201cHe\u2019s got the threat signature of a hot dog.\u201d) As Morris explained in our conversation ahead of the film\u2019s release, \u201cYou have the Department of Justice behaving like gods \u2014 like rather paranoid gods. They\u2019re playing with people that they don\u2019t understand but that they can manipulate.\u201d\n\nThe Day Shall Come is billed as being based on \u201ca hundred true stories.\u201d Was there one, in particular, that inspired you?\n\nVery much so, yes. I was just watching the news on British TV, and the story came up that the FBI had arrested an army launching a full-scale ground war from a warehouse in Miami. I didn\u2019t realize then it was the origin of a film, but three years later I ran into [former CIA operations officer and terror expert] Marc Sageman, who was a witness at the trial. He said, \u201cRemember that full-scale ground war in Miami? It was actually going to be seven guys on horses. But they didn\u2019t even have horses.\u201d It turned out an FBI informant was offering $50,000 for them to come up with a plan against the government. Their first plan was to lead a protest to the governor\u2019s house in Miami against conditions in the projects. And the informant said, \u201cWell, you\u2019re not gonna get much money for that, so you need to think bigger.\u201d And they basically riffed their way into a ludicrous plot to knock over the Sears Tower, which they claimed they could do even though they had no idea how, and which they claimed would cause a tidal wave which would swamp Chicago. Then they said that the waters would subside and they would ride into town on horses because they said people respect a man on a horse.\n\nSo this was what was presented through a news bulletin as a bigger threat to the United States than 9/11. By the [former] attorney general, by the way! [Alberto] Gonzales. That\u2019s how he described it. I just thought, \u201cRight, that\u2019s some great lie. And I now want to get to the bottom of this.\u201d I was further drawn in by the fact that this was a pattern by which the FBI comes up with a terrorist plot and then tries to get someone to try and carry it out.\n\nBefore making Four Lions, you spent years researching jihadism. Was it a similar research process this time?\n\nOnly in that you\u2019re following something to find out more. But in all other respects, there were very few similarities. This is a story about law enforcement setting up a fake world and leading someone into it, creating a sort of Truman Show\u2013type environment. The research then took me to a lot of places that were strange to me. I\u2019ve never been in an FBI building before, I\u2019ve never spoken to people in the Department of Justice or been around any American city police stations. I hadn\u2019t been to Detroit, Dearborn, Chicago, where some of these cases had been perpetrated on people. It was a series of very interesting, exciting acquaintances with the unknown.\n\nIf you\u2019re trying to write a character like Moses, you\u2019re trying to create a fringe preacher, someone who has come up with their own ideology which represents a transcendent narrative to people who are living in an area which is pretty downtrodden. And in order to do that you have to understand the still-ongoing segregation that happens. We came across a bridge across a canal in Miami which separated two neighborhoods. The kids in the poorer neighborhood went to school in the better-off neighborhood across this bridge on the canal, but there was a dirty, great big steel door in the middle of the bridge and these kids were only allowed to walk to school with a police escort. Then at the end of the school day they were sort of ushered through back to the poorer neighborhood, and the steel door was slammed shut. You see that, and then you can start to write within the confines that the real world has set out for you.\n\nChris Morris in Brass Eye.

There\u2019s an agent who [accidentally] left their recording on after when they\u2019d been to visit a target, and once that recording is left on it has to be available to the court in a trial. So there was a brief moment, before the judge overruled [it as evidence], when this recording was around, and you can hear the agent coming back to the office saying, \u201cGreat, this guy is such an idiot, and is so poor, we\u2019re not even going to need to offer him $50 to do something! We\u2019re definitely on to something here!\u201d And somebody else, another voice, says, \u201cYeah, but should we really be targeting this kind of person?\u201d And there\u2019s a bit of a pause and then somebody else says, \u201cYeah, we should.\u201d\n\nThe FBI has been historically known to open files on musicians, writers, and all sorts of private citizens. Do you think they might have a file open on you now?\n\nIf I say no, it\u2019ll give someone who has got a file open on me a laugh. Who knows.\n\nWhat kind of sway does being a U.K. comedy legend get you in the U.S. moviemaking system?\n\n[Dry British chuckle] Well, it varies. It\u2019s certainly not the first part of the conversation.\n\nI\u2019m curious about your development over the years. Your movies \u2014 while impressively lacking any glint of a happy ending \u2014 very much are trying to tell empathetic human stories. Brass Eye, though, was almost nihilistic. It was, like, punk.\n\nOh, you prefer the happy ending of a punk attack?! Well, you know, those things are reactions. They\u2019re glorified spasms, aren\u2019t they? If you\u2019re doing satirical commentary on the fabric of news presentations, or on how politics is mediated through the news, or on how celebrities stand for things they don\u2019t understand, you\u2019re just trying to detonate the same membrane that\u2019s giving you this crap. You\u2019re just trying to ruin the fabric. It\u2019s like a grenade attack. It is a series of spasms which you make as jokes.\n\nWhen you\u2019re doing it, you\u2019re basically setting yourself impossible tasks. You go, \u201cRight, there\u2019s no way we can get away with this, it\u2019s impossible \u2026 so let\u2019s try it.\u201d And then you discover, \u201cOh my God, we got away with that.\u201d There\u2019s an internal logic. It\u2019s not just the end that\u2019s driving you forward. It\u2019s your personal investment. Your testing of your own presumptions and basic discoveries of human psychology. Once you\u2019ve discovered that, you\u2019d be mad to carry on doing it. God, it would be so dispiriting. You\u2019d be going [clicks into quiet, jaded voice], \u201cYeah, yeah, I go into this situation, I write this, I get that person to say this, and we\u2019d end up with [long harrumph] another funny thing.\u201d It would be awful!\n\nMoses Al Shabaz in The Day Shall Come. Photo: IFC Films\n\nA common observation about the pretty insane Brass Eye is that it wouldn\u2019t look all that insane held up next to something like current-day Fox News. That, in a way, your fake news predicted the tenor of today\u2019s real news.\n\nI\u2019m \u2026 I\u2019m pretty skeptical. I think it\u2019s a quite superficial. In the time when I was satirizing the fabric of the media, the media took itself seriously, in that sort of universal voice. And since that time, that universal voice, and indeed the degree that people feel the news has a right to take itself seriously, has diminished. So there\u2019s not an authority to undermine. People, you could say, they go around undermining their own authority now.\n\nAnd politicians, if you are going to get them to campaign for something that doesn\u2019t exist, you have to get them to talk unbelievable rubbish. I mean, really. I don\u2019t mean just something you can\u2019t believe but mind-blowingly stupid rubbish in order for it to be funny enough to put in a program.\n\nIt does feel like politicians lean into the shameless these days. You have to go so much farther for something to feel ridiculous.\n\nThe shamelessness is a strongman political tactic now. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a very good long-term game, do you? It\u2019s disorientating because someone is offending the social codes. And in those circumstances, whether it\u2019s amongst your own social group or amongst what is perceived to be the right way for politicians to behave, you can steal a certain amount of territory by doing that. You disarm the room, or the country, or the opposition by doing that, by simply not owning it as a problem. And [Trump] does just sort of drop a turd and move on and drop a turd and move on. It\u2019s a disruptive tactic until people realize quite how basic the tactic is.\n\nYou and Charlie Brooker together came up with the idea for the the Black Mirror episode \u201cThe Waldo Moment,\u201d in which a comedian playing a CGI bear becomes a rising political star. Waldo\u2019s success comes from just being funny and awful, all the time. That\u2019s another bit of content that could be said to foreshadow our current moment.\n\nI\u2019m not suuure. It\u2019s the idea of being in character. As long as you\u2019re in character, you can get away with anything. So as an evasion tactic, it\u2019s pretty good. But I don\u2019t think we thought, \u201cErrhmm, the way things are going, there\u2019s gonna be a populist uprising and an appeal to the lowest common denominator, and an appeal to people\u2019s gut feelings without bothering about arguments or rigor or any of those processes which you expect from politicians\u201d \u2014 I don\u2019t think we saw all that. We probably just saw that childishness worked.", "description": "The Brass Eye and The Day Today creator reinvented himself as a movie director with Four Lions.
