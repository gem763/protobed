REUTERS/Francis Mascarenhas/Files\n\nNEW DELHI (Reuters) - Collections from India\u2019s nationwide goods and services tax (GST) fell to a 19-month low in September, data showed on Tuesday, increasing the risk of fiscal slippage at a time when demand continued to remain weak in Asia\u2019s third largest economy.\n\nThe tax collections for September stood at 919.16 billion Indian rupees ($12.93 billion), a fall of 2.7% from last year and the first drop since the beginning of the 2019/20 fiscal year in April.\n\nThe government needs an average monthly collection of more than 1 trillion rupees every month to meet its budget target.\n\nThe lower collection will further exacerbate the risk of the country slipping from its fiscal deficit target of 3.3% of gross domestic product in 2019/20, especially after government tax revenue for the current fiscal year was reduced by 1.45 trillion rupees due to cuts in corporate tax rates.\n\nThe government\u2019s direct tax collections growth since the beginning of the current fiscal stands at 6% so far, below the required growth rate of 17%.\n\nLower tax collections reflect relatively weak economic growth, which fell to a six-year low of 5% in the April-June period.\n\nOn Monday, the government released India\u2019s infrastructure output data which showed contraction for the first time since 2015, signalling a tepid recovery in the July-September quarter and enhancing the chances of further interest rate reduction by the Reserve Bank of India later this week.\n\n($1 = 71.0620 Indian rupees)", "description": "Collections from India\u2019s nationwide goods and services tax (GST) fell to a 19-month low in September, data showed on Tuesday, increasing the risk of fiscal slippage at a time when demand continued to remain weak in Asia's third largest economy.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435885756&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF902SI", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
