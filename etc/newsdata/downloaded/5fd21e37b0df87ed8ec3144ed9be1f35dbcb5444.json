What should I do?", "language": "en", "text": "This isn\u2019t what you want to hear, says Annalisa Barbieri, but to give yourself a chance at a meaningful relationship, you need to do some work on yourself\n\nI met my ex when I was 16. We fell madly in love, but she ended the relationship four years later; I\u2019d lied to her about the drugs I was taking to numb myself from the pain of my mother leaving me when I was 17.\n\nFast forward four years, to last year: I\u2019m in a new relationship after a couple of failed ones. This new lady is amazing and fulfils my needs. But then I met my ex at the end of last year and realised that I still had feelings for her. We didn\u2019t see each other for some time, but eventually met again this summer. It was a magical night.\n\nMy current partner picked up on this. She said I should go and deal with it, so we took a three-week break. I organised to see my ex and profess my undying love for her. She reciprocated, saying she has never felt the same connection with anyone \u2013 not even for her current partner, who she\u2019s been with for six years. We ended up making love.\n\nI know where I stand and what I want. She has the same feelings for me, yet is scared of losing me or her partner. I\u2019m in limbo and don\u2019t know what to do.\n\nIt would be easy for me to say, \u201cGo to your first love and see how it plays out.\u201d But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the right thing to do \u2013 probably neither of these women is right for you, and you will continue to vacillate \u2013 if not between these two, then eventually between two other women. This is because you hit the nail on the head when you talked about your mother and the wound her leaving caused. Did you see her again? Where is she now? I think it\u2019s probable that relationships (and drugs) have helped you gloss over this pain, and now the strands of your mother and your first love are inextricably interwoven. Time to undo them.\n\nI talked through your problem with psychotherapist Hazel Hyslop (psychotherapy.org.uk). She wondered if the relationship with your ex is based on fantasy. \u201cIt seems like a drug \u2013 it brings a good feeling, a buzz. But there\u2019s also a sense of you trying to fill the gap your mother left. Have you ever been alone, in a relationship with yourself?\u201d\n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like you have, from your letter, but rather that you\u2019ve gone from one relationship to another. Do you fear being alone?\n\nHyslop went on to explain that any addiction is about escape, a way for someone to numb painful emotions but also to detach from reality, because somewhere along the line they have learned that reality hurts. \u201cYou learn that it\u2019s not safe to be authentic, so you start detaching and creating a fantasy life.\u201d Which is just what you\u2019ve done.\n\nWhen we close down certain real-life emotions we can seek to recreate them with drugs, food, or love. In this way, we think we are getting the feeling without any of the hurt. But in truth, it\u2019s not real and we get into a destructive cycle of always chasing the highs and fearing the lows. I think this is what you are doing with your relationships.\n\nHyslop also pointed out that you are outsourcing responsibility for your happiness, \u201cYou are looking for external validation. It\u2019s not up to your girlfriends to meet your needs. You need to look after each other, but in terms of meeting needs, you have to do that for yourself.\u201d She also felt there was some co-dependency in your relationship with your first girlfriend and suggested you look at coda-uk.com.\n\nShould I go to my son\u2019s wedding? His mother poisoned everyone against me Read more\n\nI know this isn\u2019t what you want to hear. But to give yourself a chance at a meaningful, realistic relationship with depth and intimacy, one that\u2019s going to last, you need to do some work on yourself and \u2013 cliche alert \u2013 you need to learn to love yourself. If your mother \u2013 the first woman who should love you \u2013 left you, that must have caused a deep scar. I\u2019m really sorry this happened to you. But you sound \u201cinterested in your self-development\u201d, as Hyslop said, and that bodes well for you.\n\nIf my maths is correct, you are in your mid-20s \u2013 a ripe time for growth and introspection \u2013 and a time when a lot of things come together. It\u2019s an exciting period. Try to get therapy, try to heal that 17-year-old boy. Learn to be with yourself and invest in things that make you feel good: other friends, work, exercise. Press pause on romantic relationships for a little while.\n\n\u2022 Send your problem to annalisa.barbieri@mac.com.
