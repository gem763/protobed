There is no stable example of a modern socialist nation. All attempts, such as those seen in Sweden and Denmark, were blunders that led toward economic demise. Sanders still cites Sweden as the bastion of democratic socialism \u2014 even though it hasn\u2019t been remotely socialist for two decades.\n\nThis is where our nation\u2019s young people get their backwards history of socialism: from the complete mischaracterization of supposedly \u201csocialist\u201d nations and their past. To my fellow peers, classmates and friends: socialism cannot be reformed. It cannot be modernized. It cannot be revived, rejuvenated, or renovated, no matter how much our politicians may cajole us to adopt it. We cannot allow the youth of America to be baited by false promises of a restoration of socialism. If we do, we risk repeating history. And the repetition of history often leads to catastrophe.", "description": "", "authors": ["Thomas Ullman", "Spectator.Org Gen-Z-Ers-Like-Me-Are-Being-Seduced-By-Socialism"], "top_image": ""}
