Jim DeMint, publisher Al Regnery, presidential historian Craig Shirley, Citizens United President Davis Bossie, Club for Growth President David McIntosh and more than 100 more.\n\n\u201cAs acting head of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), Cuccinelli has proven himself exceptionally capable of executing the president\u2019s agenda on complex and sensitive issues. Rather than backing away from a media that is at times overtly hostile to the president\u2019s enforcement of the law, Cuccinelli has consistently been an unwavering, articulate, and extremely knowledgeable advocate of the policies his agency has put forward,\u201d the group noted in their rationale.\n\n\u201cMoreover, Cuccinelli is a proven executive with a personal touch, and an excellent manager. In an agency with many components, he will be a leader that builds a team atmosphere in order to get the work accomplished. His tenure at USCIS has seen a renewal in agency morale, and discipline of those attempting to undermine the president\u2019s policies.\u201d\n\nFind the big list of Cuccinelli fans and their statement at ConservativeActionProject.com.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
