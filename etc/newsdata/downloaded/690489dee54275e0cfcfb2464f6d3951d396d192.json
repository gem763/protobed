As a psychic medium I 'see' visions that are like a movie with full colour, clarity and detail, and I 'see' people in my mind's eye too. The visions are of a person's past, present and future. I 'hear' voices that tell me all sorts of things, sometimes it is just a name or a word and I then have to interpret it's meaning, usually along with a 'knowing', a 'vision' and a 'feeling' of what the voice wants me to understand.\n\nOne of the strangest things she has been asked to do in these sessions is confirm the identity of a spirit that was 'haunting' a client's home because she was convinced she was in love with it.\n\n'Naturally I thought she was having me on but she was dead serious,' she said.\n\nWhile she knows not everyone is so accepting of what Ms Dimech does for a living, she doesn't believe it's her job to convince people.\n\n'If someone is curious and willing to let me, I will offer them some information about themselves that I simply should not logically \"know\" and see if that expands their minds,' she said.", "description": "An Australian psychic has revealed how her abilities have saved people from life threatening illnesses like heart attacks and cancer and the strangest request she's ever been asked.", "authors": ["Matilda Rudd For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/01/02/19134782-0-image-a-12_1569893600322.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
