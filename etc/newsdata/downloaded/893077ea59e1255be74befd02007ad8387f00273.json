Brinkley also said that making the video with Joel was one of the \u201cfun highlights of my career.\u201d", "description": "Sailor Brinkley-Cook stepped in at the last moment to replace her mom while honoring her legacy.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8110712300001005565452.jpeg?cache=wwpqabrwk0&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
