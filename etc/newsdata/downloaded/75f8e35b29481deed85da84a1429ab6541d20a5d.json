Its economic impact will be worse than the deal negotiated by Johnson\u2019s predecessor Theresa May and rejected three times by the U.K. Parliament earlier this year. That is true both in the short term and in the long term.\n\nIn the short term, it leaves the U.K. outside the customs union where it would have stayed under the infamous \u201cbackstop\u201d negotiated by the previous government. But more uncertainty is also hanging over the near term economic future. The dearth of investment in the last three years has been the main drag on the U.K. economy, which explains why the country\u2019s GDP is now 1-to-3% lower than it would have been if voters had opted for remain in 2016.\n\nNew elections are looming, setting up a border in the Irish sea is rife with practical difficulties, and starting talks with the European Union on a future trade deal will prove challenging after so much goodwill evaporated in the last three months.\n\nThe economy will also suffer in the longer term. Reduced trade with the EU and limits on immigration will hit the economy. The UK in a Changing Europe, a think tank, estimates that compared to remaining in the EU, GDP would be lower in ten-year\u2019s time by between 2.3% and 7% - a bigger hit than if the May deal had been approved.\n\nBut the political background will count too. Johnson\u2019s government is not seeking to conclude with the EU an agreement on a \u201cfuture relationship\u201d that would keep both sides closely intertwined. It is just seeking a bare-bones free trade deal, meaning it will pay an economic price for its political choices.\n\nRelated: Brexit pact faces steep odds in the U.K. Parliament \u2014 and Johnson might not mind failure\n\nAlso read: What a Brexit deal would mean for U.S. stocks and global investors", "description": "Boris Johnson has signed a deal he said he didn\u2019t need, creating a border he didn\u2019t want, under the authority of a Court he didn\u2019t accept, to be submitted to...", "authors": ["Pierre Brian\u00e7on", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT525_Johnso_ZG_20191017104213.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
