It was announced back in May that \u201cBillions\u201d had been renewed for a fifth season at the premium cabler, with the show remaining one of Showtime\u2019s highest-rated and most-watched series.\n\nAlong with \u201cBillions,\u201d the duo has previously worked on films such as \u201cRounders,\u201d \u201cOcean\u2019s Thirteen,\u201d \u201cRunaway Jury\u201d and \u201cSolitary Man.\u201d\n\nIsaac is an award-winning tech reporter at the New York Times who writes frequently about Uber, Facebook and other Silicon Valley titans. Previously, he was a senior editor reporting on social media companies for Re/Code and AllThingsD, and was also a staff writer for WIRED.\n\nHe is repped by UTA and Levine Greenberg Rostan.\n\nLast week, Showtime announced that David Oyelowo had been cast in the lead role of the pilot \u201cThe President Is Missing,\u201d based on the book by Bill Clinton and James Patterson. It was also recently announced that the network had cast \u201cFleabag\u201d star Andrew Scott in the lead role of the series based on the Tom Ripley novels by Patricia Highsmith.\n\nPopular on Variety:", "description": "Brian Koppelman and David Levien will serve as writers and executive producers on the series,", "authors": ["Joe Otterson", "Tv Reporter", "Https", "Twitter.Com Joeotterson", "Joe'S Most Recent Stories", "View All"], "top_image": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/brian-koppelman-and-david-levien-billions-writers.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
