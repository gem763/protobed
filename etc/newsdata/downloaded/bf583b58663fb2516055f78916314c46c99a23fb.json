And this includes checking out Europe the way millions of people do \u2013 from a cruise ship.\n\nI'm not out to promote or put down cruising. For some people, it's a great choice, and for others, it's not. On the plus side, cruising can be economical, with transportation, a room, and meals all included in one price. It can be ideal for those who want their vacation logistics taken care of. And toggling from a floating resort to exciting days onshore \u2013 nearly each day in a different country \u2013 can be efficient if you want to sample a range of places in a short time.\n\nCruise ships offer plenty of onboard fun, but to me, the destinations are the reason to set sail. The trick is deciding how to best experience them. Many would say cruising can insulate you from the \"real Europe.\" You're going to the most famous places and seeing them at the same time as thousands of other tourists.\n\nFind out more: Watch Europe unfold before your eyes on a river cruise vacation\n\nNavigating crowds is indeed one of cruising's challenges. Ships can be huge \u2013 the last Mediterranean cruise ship I sailed on had about 3,000 passengers. To avoid the hordes, get out as early as possible and come back as late as you can. Doing this, you'll enjoy fewer crowds and more unforgettable moments.\n\nYou don't have to purchase the cruise ship's sightseeing package to have an enjoyable time onshore. In most port terminals, reputable companies offer essentially the same tours as the cruise lines for a fraction of the cost.\n\nAnother option: Book a private guide in advance. It's a comfort to be met at the port with a warm personal welcome. You can share the cost: Four people hiring a guide with a car costs about the same as four people taking the official cruise excursion. And with a guide, you get your own private teacher, you won't get lost, and you enjoy the freedom to go at your own pace.\n\nNice, France, will soon have a tramline connecting the city center right to its cruise port.

Most ports offer helpful tourist offices and are well-served by public transit. For example, with a good guidebook and public transportation, exploring the French Riviera is a snap. Frequent trains link the cities along the coast, and Nice \u2013 the Riviera's hub \u2013 will soon have a tramline connecting the city center right to its cruise port.\n\nIn many big cities, hop-on, hop-off bus companies offer do-it-yourselfers economic and efficient transportation. Buses meet the cruise ships at the port and offer big loop tours that connect major sights, allowing you to hop off and on all day long and dropping you back at the port.\n\nIn many big cities, hop-on, hop-off bus companies offer do-it-yourselfers economic and efficient transportation.

Or take it easy onshore: Simply walk or catch a ride to the town center and enjoy a free day \u2013 shopping, browsing, sipping a drink, or soaking up some sun on the beach. Be creative. Mix it up. Your goal: Get the most out of your vacation time and money, enjoy the best experiences, and have fun.\n\nIn some ports, such as Naples, the scene can feel aggressive. Stepping through the port security gate, you may find yourself in a scrum of assertive cabbies and tour guides. If you're skipping the cruise line's organized excursions, remember that cruise ports attract hustlers and con artists planning to overcharge naive tourists. Research the regulated taxi prices or book a local tour or guide in advance.\n\nBe on the lookout: European travel scams every tourist needs to know about\n\nCruise scams: 6 scenarios you should beware of when booking a trip\n\nEach country has its iconic quick-and-easy meal. In Naples \u2013 it's got to be pizza. Enjoy yours with a view of Mt. Vesuvius.

Each country has its iconic quick-and-easy meal. In Naples \u2013 it's got to be pizza. It's tapas in Spain. In southern France, I love a good salade ni\u00e7oise. In Greece, I'll look for a souvlaki pita.\n\nTapas 101:Rick Steves' guide to eating adventurously, authentically and affordably in Spain\n\nA cruise ship offers memorably fantastic views of the classic whitewashed villages of Santorini, Greece. (Photo: Cameron Hewitt)\n\nOne bonus to cruising is the scenic arrivals and departures. Being on the top deck as the ship approaches the day's destination gives me a quiet, bird's-eye view. The sight of an exotic and fabled Greek island like Santorini \u2013 as the moon sets and the sun rises, just kissing the lip of the breathtaking cliffs \u2013 is worth getting up for.\n\nA cruise can be what you make of it: a prepackaged travel clich\u00e9, or a springboard for independent spirits. As with travel in general, for cruisers, lifelong memories can be yours when you know your options and then match them with your personal style of travel.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/cruises/2019/10/08/cruises-how-do-european-cruise-right-according-rick-steves/3900585002/", "description": "Rick Steves shares a few DIY tips from his own European cruise experiences: Disembark early and return late, try private tours and eat off the ship.", "authors": ["Rick Steves", "Special To Usa Today", "Published A.M.
