Pictured: A valley in the Yanachaga-Chemillen National Park\n\nHer parents Rupert and Cecilia - who live in a \u00a3650,000 home in the village of Grateley, near Andover, Hampshire, - immediately flew out to Peru after hearing of their daughter's disappearance.\n\nUp to 50 police officers, joined by firefighters and park rangers, scoured the forest for signs of life but discovered Elizabeth's clothed body at the bottom of the ravine six days later.\n\nAssistant Coroner Ian Singleton recorded a conclusion of accidental death at the inquest in Salisbury, Wiltshire.\n\nHe said: 'In the absence of any response, Rachel and Calum went back to their hostel, hoping Lizzie would be there already or would appear the next day.\n\n'After an extensive search in difficult terrain, Lizzie's body was found in a ravine at the bottom of a long drop, adjacent to a route known as Orchid Way.\n\n'Lizzie had been trying to climb down the side of a waterfall in circumstances that may well have been dark.'\n\nShe was trekking through the South American forest with sister Rachel Orchard and her sister's boyfriend Calum Jones. When the couple went back to their hostel, Elizabeth continued alone\n\nThe inquest heard how Elizabeth had explored the beautiful national park alone on May 30 before meeting her sister and her partner the following day.\n\nShe was excited to show the picture-perfect 'jurassic' locations she had discovered during her solo trek with the couple and told them the trip would feel like a 'time-warp back to the age of the dinosaurs'.\n\nIn a statement read to the court, Rachel said: 'Elizabeth described the fireflies and the stars as being incredible but that it had got much colder than she expected.'\n\nMs Orchard's parents, sister, brother and two uncles were in court.\n\nIn a statement, the family said: 'We are very sad to have lost a much loved daughter and sister. However, we are relieved to know how she died.\n\n'We would like to take this opportunity to thank all those who have supported us throughout this difficult time, including the authorities in Peru and the Foreign & Commonwealth Office, as well as our extended family and many friends.\n\n'We now ask that our privacy be respected and that we be allowed to grieve in peace.'", "description": "Elizabeth Orchard, 25,\u00a0was trekking through the through the Yanachaga-Chemillen National Park in Pasco, Peru, with sister Rachel and her sister's boyfriend when Elizabeth decided to continue alone.", "authors": ["Jemma Carr For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/17/19452040-0-image-a-11_1570553029777.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
