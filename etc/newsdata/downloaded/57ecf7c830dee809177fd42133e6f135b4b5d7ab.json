Detectives will decide later whether to charge him with an offence, release him or ask a court for more time to question him.\n\nThe victims - 31 men and eight women - are being moved to a hospital mortuary from a secure location at docks near the industrial estate in Grays about 20 miles (30 km) east of London where the bodies were found.\n\nPost-mortem examinations were beginning to determine how exactly they died while forensic experts sought to identify the deceased.\n\nHoa Nghiem from Human Rights Space, a civic network based in Vietnam, said at least one of the deceased might have been Vietnamese.\n\nPham Thi Tra My, 26, sent a text message to her mother saying she could not breathe at about the time the truck container was en route from Belgium to Britain, Hoa said.\n\n\"I'm sorry Mom. My path to abroad doesn't succeed. Mom, I love you so much! I'm dying bcoz I can't breath ... I'm from Nghen, Can Loc, Ha Tinh, Vietnam ... I am sorry, Mom,\" the message said according to Hoa.\n\nShe said Tra My had gone to China and was planning to reach England via France.\n\n\"Our contact is getting more alerts that there could be more Vietnamese people in the truck,\" Hoa said on Twitter.\n\nVietHome, an organisation for the Vietnamese community, said it had received news from 10 families that their loved ones were missing. Hanoi's London embassy was coordinating with British police, the official Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reported.\n\nFor years, illegal immigrants have attempted to reach Britain stowed away in trucks, often from the European mainland. In 2000, 58 Chinese were found dead in a tomato truck at the port of Dover.\n\n\n\n\n\nBRITAIN 'HAS NOT FULFILLED RESPONSIBILITY'\n\nChina's Global Times, which is published by the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily, said in a Friday editorial that Britain should bear some responsibility for the deaths.\n\n\"It is clear that Britain and relevant European countries have not fulfilled their responsibility to protect these people from such a death,\" the widely read tabloid said.\n\nIt added that Britain appeared not to have learned its lesson from the Dover incident two decades ago.\n\nThe police investigation is focused on the movement of the trailer prior to its arrival at Purfleet docks near Grays little more than an hour before the bodies were found, and on who was behind the suspected human trafficking.\n\nIrish company Global Trailer Rentals said it owned the trailer and had rented it out on Oct. 15. The firm said it was unaware of what it was to be used for.\n\nThe refrigeration unit had travelled to Britain from Zeebrugge in Belgium and the town's chairman, Dirk de Fauw, said he believed the victims died in the trailer before it arrived in the Belgian port.\n\nThe Times newspaper reported that GPS data showed the container had arrived at the Belgian port at 2.49 p.m. local time on Tuesday before later making the 10-hour sea crossing to Britain.\n\nPolice said the cab unit of the truck was driven over from Dublin on Sunday, crossing the Irish Sea by ship and entering Britain in North Wales. It picked up the trailer in Purfleet shortly after midnight on Wednesday.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Police investigating the deaths of 39 people in a truck near London said they had arrested a man and a woman on Friday on suspicion of human trafficking amid signs that some of the dead may be Vietnamese.
