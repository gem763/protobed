The central bank purportedly believes that a public central bank digital currency (CBDC) could be the answer to the direct threat that cryptocurrencies apparently present.\n\nThe document, titled \u201cCentral Bank Money: The Next Generation,\u201d was reportedly prepared for the current Governor of the Bank of Canada, Stephen Poloz, for a September 2018 board meeting and was presented as part of a two-year research project on whether or not the bank should launch its own CBDC.\n\nOn Oct. 17, an internal source at the Bank of Canada confirmed to Cointelegraph that the presentation did in fact happen. The author of the document, Stephen Murchison, wrote at the time:\n\n\u201cWe need to innovate to stay in the game. [...] the CBDC would have all the benefits [of a central bank-backed asset] and all the convenience and security of wireless, electronic payments.\u201d\n\nAccording to the document, one of the benefits to the Canadian central bank of launching its own digital currency would be the ability to collect more information on its citizens than is possible when people use cash. These personal details wouldn\u2019t be shared with the payee, but could be shared with police or tax authorities, the document reads.\n\nHowever, in an email to Cointelegraph, Josianne M\u00e9nard, spokesman for the central bank, said that the bank had not yet made any decisions as to whether it will launch its own digital coin, adding:\n\n\u201cOur work on CBDC is exploratory, given technological advancements and the important public service that bank notes provide to Canadians.\u201d\n\nChina shifts development of CBDC in extra gear\n\nCointelegraph recently reported that analysts at RBC Capital Markets suggested that stifling Facebook\u2019s Libra may leave the field open to China\u2019s own yuan-backed CBDC to dominate in emerging economies.
