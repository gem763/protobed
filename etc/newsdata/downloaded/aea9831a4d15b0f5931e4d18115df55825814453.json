"title": "Don\u00b4t risk mixing general election with Brexit, Tony...", "language": "en", "text": "Tony Blair has warned that fighting a general election on the issue of Brexit is a \u201cvast elephant trap\u201d that could allow Boris Johnson to claim a mandate for leaving without a deal.\n\nThe former prime minister said that he would \u201cbeg\u201d MPs not to contest a general election over fears of a \u201csubstantial risk that we end up with a no-deal Brexit\u201d \u2014 which he argued was the UK Government\u2019s strategy.\n\nA no-deal Brexit would also be a \u201cprofound threat\u201d to the union of the United Kingdom, Mr Blair suggested, adding a \u201cwhole additional dimension\u201d to the argument for Scottish independence.\n\nSpeaking in Edinburgh to the Scottish Parliamentary Journalists\u2019 Association, Mr Blair made a plea for MPs not to have a general election underpinned by the issue of Brexit, suggesting that \u201cthe opposition vote is divided\u201d which could allow a victorious Mr Johnson to claim a mandate for his apparent no-deal strategy.\n\nReferring to a Government briefing that the Tories would contest an election on a platform supporting a no-deal Brexit, Mr Blair said: \u201cThe strategy is laid out very clearly, and it\u2019s a vast elephant trap of great width and depth, with neon signs flashing around it saying: \u2018Elephant trap \u2013 elephants of limited awareness please fall in\u2019.\n\n\u201cThey should avoid that.\u201d\n\nMr Blair added: \u201cThe right thing is indeed to go back to the people but I beg you, please, not by way of a general election.\n\n\u201cTo mix a general election up with the specific issue of Brexit is wrong in principle and it\u2019s wrong in the politics.\u201d\n\nFormer prime minister Tony Blair warned against falling into the Tories\u00b4 `elephant trap\u00b4 (Aaron Chown/PA)\n\nDescribing politics as having been \u201cupended\u201d by the combination of Brexit, a decade of austerity and Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s election as Labour leader, Mr Blair suggested that a no-deal outcome was now most likely, which he said would be used in arguments for Scottish independence.\n\nHe said: \u201cI remain a convinced unionist, I want Scotland to remain part of the United Kingdom irrespective of Brexit, whether it happens or doesn\u2019t happen.\n\n\u201cBut it would be foolish to deny that if what is proposed is a no-deal Brexit, and we were to do such a thing, then it would be a whole additional dimension for the argument for independence that those who wish for independence would use and use persuasively.\u201d\n\nSince he left office in 2007, Mr Blair explained that he has been able to witness \u201chow rapidly the world is undergoing vast change \u2013 economically, socially and geopolitically\u201d and said that there is a technological revolution that is going to change literally everything.\u201d\n\nCalling for the UK to embrace the global changes to \u201caccess opportunities and mitigate its risks and dangers\u201d, Mr Blair cited the collapse of Thomas Cook as an indication of how public behaviour is shifting.\n\n\u201cThomas Cook is part of the changing way that consumers are operating today and that technological change,\u201d Mr Blair said.\n\n\u201cThis is a symbol of the change that is going to be happening in industries and sectors right across the economy for years to come.\u201d\n\nRelating the global challenges to the campaign for Scottish independence, Mr Blair said that he hoped the debate recognised \u201cindependence in itself will not solve these major challenges\u201d and hoped for less \u201cdistorted\u201d political discourse.\n\nMr Blair reflected on devolution and the creation of the Scottish Parliament during his time in office as a \u201csuccess\u201d and said: \u201c20 years on, my ultimate reflection is that it was an attempt to find a way of reconciling the need for a nation a such as Scotland to have far-greater power and control over its own affairs while still remaining part of a larger alliance that could help the interests of that nation state in a changing world.\n\n\u201cI still think the same argument applies to Britain\u2019s place in Europe and I hope that maybe out of all the turmoil of these past years, we are able to get to a place where our politics better reflects that view.\n\n\u201cIf it does, we may find that this populist surge which has distorted our politics and politics around the world over these past years finally exhausts itself and allows us to get back to the true principles and true activity of governing in the interests of the people.\u201d\n\nAddressing the Labour Party\u2019s shift \u201cfurther left than ever before\u201d, Mr Blair suggested there is a \u201chuge opportunity\u201d for Scottish Labour to embrace a pro-union and pro-EU position.\n\nHe said: \u201cMy belief is that it will be clear over these next months that there is the potential for a renewal of the centre ground of politics.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s true in the UK as a whole and I think that\u2019s true in Scotland as well. With the departure of Ruth Davidson from the scene of politics in Scotland, there is a very open space for the competition for that centre-ground vote.\u201d", "description": "Tony Blair warned against Boris Johnson\u00b4s apparent desire for a no-deal Brexit.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/17/wire-19450882-1570550914-2_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
