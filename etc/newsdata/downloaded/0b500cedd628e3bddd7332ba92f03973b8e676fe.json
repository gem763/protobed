The key question is whether that weakness seeps through the economy, and whether that's aggravated.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, uncertainty over the rates outlook made its way into the market for interest-rate futures tied to the Fed's policy rate, where bets rose that the central bank's expected reduction to its benchmark overnight lending rate this week will be its final rate cut of the year.\n\nTraders, as of late Tuesday morning, gave a 61% probability that the Fed would reduce its policy rate by a quarter of a percentage point to a range of 1.75% to 2% on Wednesday, down from 92% just a week ago.\n\nFurther complicating matters, the Fed's policy rate spiked overnight, forcing the New York Fed to take immediate steps to relieve stress in U.S. funding markets that are relied on by securities firms to finance their positions.\n\nThough the volatility isn't expected to have a direct impact on the Fed's setting of rates, it could weigh on Fed officials as they consider technical adjustments and guidance for their balance sheet outlook.\n\n\n\n\n\n'MIXED OPINION'\n\nSince the Fed's 8-2 decision to cut rates in July, a move that Powell called a 'mid-cycle' adjustment, the economic data has delivered mixed signals.\n\nStrong retail sales and continued wage growth may add to Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren's confidence that current economic conditions do not justify further policy easing. He dissented in the July policy decision.\n\nThe ongoing U.S.-China trade war makes Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan among others concerned about slowing factory output and a slide in business investment. Kaplan supported July's rate cut.\n\nThe newest wild card to factor in to the debate emerged unexpectedly in Saturday's attacks on the Saudi oil facilities, which triggered the biggest spike in oil prices in more than two decades.\n\nFed officials could see the development either as a risk to an already fragile growth outlook, which would support the case for more easing, or as a welcome boost to inflation, which would back a case for standing still for now.\n\n\"If everyone was on the same page at the Fed I could understand it,\" said Lee Ferridge, head of macro strategy for North America at State Street Global Markets.\n\n\"But clearly there is disagreement at the Fed ... If the Fed is very split and Powell can't give a strong signal, doesn\u2019t that imply very few moves are likely, rather than these dramatic cuts?\"\n\nFed policymakers will bring to the meeting their own views of where rates should be by December. In June, the last time they published their forecasts, about half of policymakers expected a total of two rate cuts this year; about half thought no rate cuts would be appropriate.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Deep disagreements within the Federal Reserve over the economic outlook and how the U.S. central bank should respond will not stop policymakers from cutting interest rates at a two-day meeting that began on Tuesday.
