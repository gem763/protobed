No justification for taking action with such an extreme effect has been put before the court.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cThis court has already concluded that the prime minister\u2019s advice to her majesty was unlawful, void, and of no effect.\n\n\u201cThis means that the Order in Council to which it led was also unlawful, void, and of no effect and should be quashed. This means that when the royal commissioners walked into the House of Lords it was as if they walked in with a blank sheet of paper.\n\n\u201cThe prorogation was also void and of no effect. Parliament has not been prorogued.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the unanimous judgment of all 11 justices.\u201d\n\nJohnson lashes out at Supreme Court\n\nGetty\n\nSpeaking with reporters in New York, where he was attending the UN General Assembly, Johnson accused his opponents of trying to \u201cfrustrate Brexit\u201d and accused the court of wrecking his hopes of negotiating a new exit deal with the European Union.\n\n\u201cI strongly disagree with this decision,\u201d Johnson said.\n\n\u201cI have the upmost respect for our judiciary \u2013 I don\u2019t think this was the right decision. I think that the prorogation has been used for centuries without this kind of challenge.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cLet\u2019s be in no doubt there are a lot of people who want to frustrate Brexit. There are a lot of people who want to stop this country coming out of the EU.\u201d\n\n\n\nRead more:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018There are a lot of people who want to frustrate Brexit\u2019: Boris Johnson accuses Supreme Court of sinking deal with the EU\n\n\n\nA representative for the prime minister said he would not be resigning but would return home early in time to be back in Parliament on Wednesday.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nReuters / Henry Nicholls Demonstrators outside the Supreme Court in London on Tuesday.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s 11 judges dealt with two appeals relating to Johnson\u2019s decision over a three-day hearing.\n\nThe first was the UK government\u2019s appeal against Scotland\u2019s Court of Session, ruling that Johnson\u2019s move to suspend Parliament was unlawful and intended to stifle parliamentary scrutiny of his handling of Brexit.\n\nThe second was from Gina Miller, the activist who took an appeal to the Supreme Court after the English High Court ruled that Johnson\u2019s proroguing of Parliament was entirely political and not a matter for judges.\n\nThe UK government previously insisted it would abide by the verdict of the court, meaning Parliament could be reconvened immediately.\n\n\u2018Momentous\u2019\n\nLeon Neal/Getty Images The activist Gina Miller.\n\nFollowing the verdict, Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, called on Johnson to \u201cconsider his position\u201d and \u201cbecome the shortest-serving prime minister there\u2019s ever been.\u201d\n\nScottish National Party MP Joanna Cherry, who helped bring the case in Edinburgh\u2019s Court of Session, said Johnson\u2019s position had become \u201cuntenable\u201d and called on Parliament to resume \u201cimmediately the important job of scrutinizing this minority Tory government.\u201d\n\nShe said: \u201cThis is a huge victory for the rule of law and for democracy and is very much in keeping with the Scottish constitutional decision that neither the government, or indeed the monarch, are above the law.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cHis position is untenable and he should have the guts for once to the decent thing and resign.\u201d\n\nThe House of Commons speaker, John Bercow, called on Parliament to reconvene immediately.\n\n\u201cI welcome the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment that the prorogation of Parliament was unlawful,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\n\u201cIn reaching their conclusion, they have vindicated the right and duty of Parliament to meet at this crucial time to scrutinize the executive and hold ministers to account. As the embodiment of our parliamentary democracy, the House of Commons must convene without delay. To this end, I will now consult the party leaders as a matter of urgency.\u201d\n\nParliament is due to return at 11:30 on Wednesday morning.\n\nThis means members of Parliament, who are taking part in a series of party conferences, may have to return to London as early as Wednesday.\n\nCorbyn, who was at the party\u2019s annual conference in Brighton, brought forward a speech scheduled on Wednesday to Tuesday afternoon to facilitate that plan.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
