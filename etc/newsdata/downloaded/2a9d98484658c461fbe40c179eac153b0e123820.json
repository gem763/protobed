Astronomers said Thursday it\u2019s traveling 93,000 mph (150,000 kph), so fast it likely originated outside our solar system. It\u2019s 260 million miles (420 million kilometers) from the sun and getting closer.\n\nIt\u2019s expected to completely sidestep Earth, remaining beyond Mars\u2019 orbit.\n\nScientists predict the comet will hurtle past the sun in December and keep going until it\u2019s back in interstellar space. It should be visible with professional telescopes well into next year. Its nucleus is estimated between 1.2 miles and 10 miles across (2 kilometers and 16 kilometers).\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

In 2017, a telescope in Hawaii spied our first known interstellar visitor.\n\nWith another so soon, these interstellar passers-by could be more common than thought.\n\n\u201cWe are now working on getting more observations of this unusual object,\u201d Marco Micheli of ESA\u2019s Near-Earth Object Coordination Center said in a statement. \u201cWe need to wait a few days to really pin down its origin with observations that will either prove the current thesis that it is interstellar, or perhaps drastically change our understanding.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Both NASA and the European Space Agency are reporting that a newly discovered comet zooming toward the sun is likely from another star", "authors": ["Marcia Dunn"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/new-comet-solar-system.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
