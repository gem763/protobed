The people spoke on condition of anonymity because the settlement talks are ongoing.\n\nThe offer was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nShares of McKesson, AmerisourceBergen and Cardinal advanced more than 6% after the opening bell while broader indexes slipped.\n\nAll three companies are defendants in the first federal trial over the epidemic. Jury selection in that case, which will be tried in Ohio, was scheduled to begin Wednesday.\n\nInvestors are expecting a settlement ranging from $15 billion to $25 billion over five to 10 years, Jefferies analyst Brian Tanquilut said in a research note. He added that the reported deal should be viewed positively.\n\nTanquilut noted that uncertainty over liability in an opioid settlement made investors reluctant to buy the stocks.\n\nSackler family could pay billions to settle opioid lawsuits\n\nCounting prescription drugs and illegal ones such as heroin and illicitly made fentanyl, opioids have been blamed for more than 400,000 deaths in the U.S. since 2000.\n\nThat trial is considered a bellwether because it could help shape how future trials are conducted or possibly spur the global settlement sought by U.S. District Court Judge Dan Polster, who is overseeing more than 2,000 lawsuits filed by local governments and other entities against drug companies.\n\nFive drug manufacturers, including Purdue Pharma, have already used settlements or bankruptcy filings to be dismissed from the trial.", "description": "Shares of McKesson, AmerisourceBergen and Cardinal climbed more than 6% amid talk of deal to resolve lawsuits", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/02/25/0ddca83b-8d94-480b-8668-cff682632f25/thumbnail/1200x630/0a14c04e3f5c0c7fb7334260ee387474/opiods-pills-and-bottle-promo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
