Thousands of felons registered after the amendment took effect on Jan. 8.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut in June, DeSantis signed a law that said only felons who had paid all fines, fees and restitution could register to vote. Voting advocates estimate that this would impact between 500,000 to 800,000 felons.\n\nOn Friday, U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle ruled that the state can ask that the fines be paid, but it can\u2019t bar anybody from voting if they can\u2019t afford to pay.\n\nHe noted that while the Florida Supreme Court will hear a different lawsuit on the issue next month, time is running out for felons who want to vote. Local elections will take place in November around the state, and the presidential primary is in March.\n\n\u201cWhen an eligible citizen misses an opportunity to vote, the opportunity is gone forever; the vote cannot later be cast,\u201d Hinkle wrote. \u201cSo when the state wrongly prevents an eligible citizen from voting, the harm is irreparable.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHinkle\u2019s ruling technically applies to only 17 people named in the lawsuit, which was brought by the NAACP and several other groups. But experts expect it to be applied more broadly to other felons in the state.\n\nTampa pastor Clifford Tyson was one of the 17 felons cited in Hinkle\u2019s opinion. He said he has tried several times to see if he owes any fines from decades-old convictions for armed robbery and theft. He registered to vote on Jan. 8, and has voted in two local elections since then.\n\n\u201cI was so excited to vote for the first time in 42 years,\u201d Tyson said. \u201cI brought my 5-year-old grandson with me, he wanted to watch. When they handed me the ballot and directed me to the voting book, I began to cry. Tears kept on flowing.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut after DeSantis signed the law limiting which felons could register, Tyson said he is afraid to vote now.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAfter that bill came out, I have not attempted to vote. I\u2019ve been afraid to vote. I don\u2019t want to break the law,\u201d Tyson said.\n\nHe said he can\u2019t find out how much money in court fines he owes, if any.\n\n\u201cI tried to find out what I owed. I went to the clerk of court four times,\u201d Tyson, 63, said. \u201cI still couldn\u2019t find everything I needed.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s ruling affirms the governor\u2019s consistent position that convicted felons should be held responsible for paying applicable restitution, fees and fines while also recognizing the need to provide an avenue for individuals unable to pay back their debts as a result of true financial hardship,\u201d DeSantis spokeswoman Helen Aguirre Ferre said in a statement.\n\nAD\n\nThe Florida Rights Restoration Coalition has raised nearly $1 million in donations to help felons pay outstanding fines, according to Neil Volz, the group\u2019s political direction. He said a statewide bus tour next month will offer \u201creturning citizens\u201d help figuring out fines and paying them.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is a step forward,\u201d Volz said about Hinkle\u2019s decision. \u201cWe\u2019re going to keep moving forward and registering people to vote.\u201d\n\nVolz, a former lobbyist who was convicted of a felony conspiracy count in the corruption scandal of D.C. lobbyist Jack Abramoff in 2007, said he owed $3,000 in fines, and paid them off \u201cyears ago.\u201d\n\nDesmond Meade, president of the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, said his drug conviction more than 20 years ago didn\u2019t carry any fines. Meade registered to vote on Jan. 8. He agreed that Hinkle\u2019s decision shows progress, but \u201cI think that maybe we\u2019re treading a little water\u201d with the state\u2019s rules about paying fines before registering to vote.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt gets frustrating, because of the heightened sense of uncertainty,\u201d Meade said. \u201cWe run across a lot of people who are nervous, they\u2019re confused.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMeade and others hope that Hinkle\u2019s ruling will cause the state to streamline the process.\n\n\u201cThe court made clear that wealth cannot be a barrier to right restoration,\u201d said Myrna P\u00e9rez, director of the Brennan Center for Justice\u2019s Voting Rights and Elections Program. \u201cAnd he said the state has to come up with an efficient process so that everyone who cannot pay, can establish that. He was pretty clear that the legislature created a mess.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Advocates called the decision a win for voting rights and the state\u2019s 1.4 million felons.", "authors": ["Lori Rozsa"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/5fy0Z_BOElkaDrbyqlKz75L0lhU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KLTIHZCMDUI6TE6QMTN46OF2IE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
