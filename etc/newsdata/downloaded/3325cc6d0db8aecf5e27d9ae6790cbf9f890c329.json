I believe in the players that are in Tottenham today.\n\n\u201cI respect the opinion of people who say we need to change or do something, in or out. But if it is my decision, I am going to to stick with players because I know have the quality.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only to unlock some situation that is going on in their minds. We have great quality to achieve the things we are expected to.\n\n\u201cIt is not about changing this chair for a sofa and moving the table. We are the same. It is most important to help them, most important to provide calm.\n\n\u201cIt is important that players feel support from the manager. I trust 200 per cent in them and believe they have capacity and potential to win the games.\n\n\u201cThis situation happens at all clubs sooner or later. We have confidence we have the quality. It is only matter of time. For them, they are the principal actors on the pitch.\u201d\n\nTottenham were hammered by Bayern Munich (Steven Paston/PA)\n\nThe international break came at a good time for Spurs after a horror 10 days which saw them lose to League Two Colchester in the Carabao Cup, get hammered 7-2 by Bayern Munich in the Champions League and then go down 3-0 at Brighton.\n\nPochettino could not sulk, though, as he had a pre-arranged speaking engagement in Qatar, which he said was like medicine.\n\n\u201cWe had an offer a few months ago to go to Aspire, I was talking there for one and a half hours, in front of 100 people, 50 clubs, all the big clubs in the world were there,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cIt was like a medicine. We flew at 8am on Sunday and I was dead. We arrived and it was difficult to find the energy and then to talk about Tottenham and our ideas and philosophy and football.\n\n\u201cIt was the most difficult thing but we found the energy.\u201d\n\nGiovani Lo Celso is still some way away from a return to the side (John Walton/PA)\n\nSpurs will be expected to return to form when they host bottom-club Watford on Saturday, though Christian Eriksen is a doubt due to a dead leg.\n\nGiovani Lo Celso and Ryan Sessegnon have returned to full training, but Pochettino has warned their return to the team is \u201cfar away\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey are far away from the level they need to be involved,\u201d the boss added. \u201cThere are a lot of players ahead of them.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s good news that from tomorrow they are going to be involved with the team. Massive step.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time they were out. They will feel us, understand, compete with team-mates.\u201d", "description": "Christian Eriksen, Toby Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen are among those out of contract in the summer.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/14/wire-19840400-1571320480-955_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
