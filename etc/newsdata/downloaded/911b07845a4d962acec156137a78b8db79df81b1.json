I have never heard of the conversion going well if a loved one brings it up.\n\n'I think it\u2019s highly unlikely someone who is struggling with their weight doesn\u2019t know it.\n\n'There is no benefit in saying \"You\u2019re really overweight and I\u2019m concerned about you\".\u2019\n\nThe Chief Science Officer for WW suggested that you should never bring up a loved-one's weight unless they did first, no matter how good your intentions (stock image)\n\nHe explained: 'Lets assume that family members are concerned about others. Lets also assume that the person is accurately aware of their body weight, and I think it\u2019s actually a bad practice, an unhelpful practice.'\n\nInstead of bringing up somebody's weight, he said people should 'listen to a signal' from the individual to open up.\n\nHe suggested: 'I think it makes great sense if someone says \"I\u2019m really unhappy with my weight\" to respond \"Tell me more\".\n\n'Offer support that is being asked for \u2013 it\u2019s important to know whats helpful for the friend and not whats helpful for you.'\n\nThe Chief Science Officer suggested that 'tough love doesn't help'\n\nHe added: 'It sounds counter intuitive because people want to help \u2013 but it\u2019s not something the person isn\u2019t aware of.'\n\nGary went on: 'Let the person take the lead \u2013 they have to bring up the conversation. I have never heard of the conversion going well if a loved one brings it up.'\n\n'Tough love doesn\u2019t help \u2013 it hurts emotionally, and gets in the way of the journey.'\n\nEqually, he insisted that fat-shaming by strangers is just as unhelpful when it comes to deciding to lose weight.\n\nPersonal trainer Dani Levy hit the headlines in September as she argued that fat shaming is an effective way to encourage people to shed the pounds.\n\nBut Gary slammed the idea, suggesting it was a common - although misguided - assumption that fat-shaming will spur people into action.\n\nGary's comments come in sharp opposition with that of fitness instructor Danielle Levy, who hit headlines in September after claiming fat shaming helped people lose weight\n\nHe said: '[People say] we shouldn\u2019t accommodate people of size, we should make airline seats smaller, we should make it uncomfortable for people, make it difficult for people, make them feel the pain....As if they don\u2019t know its uncomfortable to go up steps, or its tough to walk around at times.'\n\n'If somebody says you\u2019re grotesque, you're fat, you're despicable, you're lazy, you're undisciplined, you would think that\u2019s motivating. It's not, it's demotivating.'\n\nHe added: 'If you're overly critical to yourself, its also not helpful. It takes you down to a darker place, because you're saying there's some fundamental character flaw.'\n\nInstead, he extolled the body positivity movement as helping people to accept and love their bodies.\n\nHe went on to say that those who valued themselves had 'more energy' on their 'weight management' journey.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Gary Foster, from\u00a0Philadelphia, Chief Science Officer at WW (formerly Weight Watchers) told Femail that there's no point bringing it up, because the person is already aware of their size.", "authors": ["Harriet Johnston For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/10/20275230-0-image-a-6_1572259685676.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
