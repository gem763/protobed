It was his passion,\" Jackson told CBC's Mainstreet. \"What our goal is, is just to find somebody that maybe doesn't have an equal passion for it like he did, but would certainly appreciate the collection and use it and listen to it.\"\n\nIt wasn't easy to decide to sell the eclectic collection, which contains music from as early as the '40s right up to the 2000s, Jackson said, noting her dad's favourite artist was Hank Williams. The collection also includes artists such as Merle Haggard, Dolly Parton and Johnny Cash.\n\nAmanda Jackson is selling the collection whole.

By the time Jackson was born, her dad could most often be found in his music room, where he jammed with friends or recorded songs and interviews on cassette.\n\nHe hardly ever missed a chance to sing folk and gospel songs at church on Sunday.\n\n\"He taught himself how to play the guitar at a young age, and his love for the music carried right through his entire life, and basically every facet of what he did his entire life,\" Jackson said.\n\nDeal died in the summer of 2018.\n\nJackson, who used to sing in one of her dad's bands, wouldn't call herself a musician \u2014 or even a country music fan, for that matter.\n\nJackson says her dad could most often be found in his music room.
