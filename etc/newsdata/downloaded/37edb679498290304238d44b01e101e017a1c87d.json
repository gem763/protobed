For that matter, \u201cJazz,\u201d a similar 10-episode effort by Burns in 2001 to let history tell the story of the ineffable, fit more neatly into his disciplined format. And 2017\u2019s \u201cThe Vietnam War\u201d took a touchy subject and conquered it with the sheer power of facts \u2014 wrestled down and beautifully arranged, then clarified with firsthand accounts. The work speaks for itself.\n\nBut country, with its many styles and pedigrees, is as wily and clever as its reputation. Here, the music must speak for itself, amid a history full of boasts and betrayals and an array of patron saints who are often revered for their sins.\n\nThere\u2019s also a deep insecurity at the root of it \u2014 the prideful notion that country music is by and for people who were and still are judged and looked down upon as lower-class folk, rednecks and so on. Burns struggles to both address and ignore the chips on country\u2019s shoulders, the bitterness that stoked the genre\u2019s outlier creativity and inspired its rebellious streak.\n\nWorking with writer-producer Dayton Duncan and producer Julie Dunfey, Burns delivers an enlightening, educational and often emotionally stirring account of country\u2019s essential evolution (still in progress), from traditional immigrant and church songs heard in the misty mountain hollers to a powerful, Nashville-centric industry that grew to favor predictable hits over authentic origins. I cried three times while making my way through it, moved by the music but also by the common thread of suffering that travels through those who create it.\n\n[12 new fall shows to watch (\u2018Unbelievable,\u2019 \u2018Evil,\u2019 \u2018Watchmen\u2019) and 5 you can probably skip]\n\n\u201cCountry Music\u201d (premiering Sunday and continuing through Sept. 25) is proof that Burns\u2019s technique can eventually and accurately convey the basic truth about any subject. Fans of the music as well as newbies will learn quite a bit in the first couple of hours, as the film, which spans from the late 19th century to the mid-1990s, sorts through the origins of an elemental sound, which went by many names: \u201chillbilly songs,\u201d \u201crace records,\u201d \u201cold-time songs,\u201d \u201cfolk music\u201d and more.\n\n\u201cThose songs were captured, rather than written,\u201d Rosanne Cash observes about the music\u2019s earliest recordings. \u201cThey were in the hills like the rock formations.\u201d\n\nFrom such bedrock comes a commingling of cultures and an unevenly shared experience.\n\nThis involved both the embrace and exclusion of African American music and traditions by white musicians, and it\u2019s here that \u201cCountry Music\u201d makes the first of its occasional, cursory attempts to reckon with the genre\u2019s racial divide \u2014 a fact as shameful and plain as the minstrelsy performed in country\u2019s early radio shows, and then all the way up to the industry\u2019s rejection this summer of Lil Nas X\u2019s \u201cOld Town Road.\u201d It\u2019s the hit single of 2019, a song from a black rap artist that sought to broaden the genre, yet was shunned by country radio\u2019s ruling order.\n\nAs a historical work, \u201cCountry Music\u201d doesn\u2019t get as far as \u201cOld Town Road,\u201d but it follows those old roads back a century to briefly describe the friction between white and black experiences of the music, along with the appropriation and morphing of certain styles. Such blending and borrowing is broadly dubbed here as \u201cthe rub,\u201d amplified by the dawn of AM radio transmissions, which brought the nation\u2019s first wave of popular hits.\n\nThen and now, country music relies on its most lasting and familiar themes \u2014 that love often leads to heartbreak, cheatin\u2019 and other drunken regrets; that Saturday night\u2019s transgressions wind up in Sunday morning\u2019s church pews. Along with redemption, country has a healthy yet depressing obsession with grief, loss and loneliness, drawing its strength from the power of family and the promise of an afterlife. (\u201cThree chords and the truth,\u201d still a prevailing description for country, is attributed to the late singer-songwriter Harlan Howard, who wrote or co-wrote many hits, including Patsy Cline\u2019s \u201cI Fall to Pieces.\u201d)\n\n\n\nMusicians perform at the \u201cGrand Ole Opry\u201d show at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville around 1960. (Les Leverett/Grand Ole Opry Archives)\n\nWith great care and reverence, \u201cCountry Music\u201d recounts the establishment of country\u2019s institutions, such as the rise of Nashville\u2019s \u201cGrand Ole Opry\u201d show and other live broadcasts. The yodeling greatness of Jimmie Rodgers, whose oft-covered \u201cMule Skinner Blues\u201d (first dubbed \u201cBlue Yodel #8\u201d when it was recorded in 1930) serves as one of \u201cCountry Music\u2019s\u201d two key refrains, the other being the Carter family\u2019s hauntingly epochal \u201cCan the Circle Be Unbroken (By and By),\u201d their 1935 rework of the 1907 church hymn.\n\nFurther episodes attempt to weave country\u2019s presence alongside American history as well as the country music community\u2019s ability to remain apolitical and even decidedly insular, rejected by the cultural upper crust as a little too common, poor or unrefined. By the early 1970s, country music fans began to identify with President Richard Nixon\u2019s concept of the \u201csilent majority\u201d \u2014 conservative, God-fearing Americans who are astonished and even repulsed by . . . well, fill in the blanks: diversity, hippies, sissies, communists, elitism and other big-city stuff.\n\n[Don\u2019t count the old networks out yet. Their fall shows aren\u2019t bad, and their potential audience is huge.]\n\nWe also watch as country survives all-comers \u2014 jazz, swing, big bands, rock-and-roll, the Beatles. Billboard magazine settled on a name for the genre (\u201ccountry & western\u201d) in 1949, which gave the industry a motive to refine itself for a mass market and gain some distance from folk and bluegrass.\n\n\u201cCountry Music\u201d will, for some viewers, serve as both introduction and image rehab; there is no way to watch it and not gain a finer regard for its poetic artistry and its role in the American story.\n\nIt\u2019s also a wonder that anyone can agree what country music really is, given such a complex tangle of sounds. The more \u201cCountry Music\u2019s\u201d experts and practitioners talk about it, the more personal it becomes.\n\n\n\nFrom left, A.P., Maybelle and Sara Carter, seen here around 1930, made up the Carter Family music group. (Carter Family Museum/Rita Forrester)\n\nHank Williams, who died at age 29 in 1953, is widely considered one of the most influential country singers of all time. (AP)\n\nThroughout, the profiles of country's innumerable influencers range from the routine mention to the epic portrayal. Hank Williams's tragic presence looms next to Jesus (\"I wish [Hank Williams] had lived to be as old as I am,\" 83-year-old Kris Kristofferson says, \"because I know there's a lot of great songs in there\"), but there are also revealing portraits of Gene Autry, Cline, Johnny Cash, Loretta Lynn, Dolly Parton and George Jones.\n\nBecause Burns is such a meticulous organizer, the casual country listener can finally get a sense of the genre\u2019s progression, and learn to distinguish hillbilly from honky-tonk, then reckon with the lushly orchestrated and hyper-produced \u201cNashville Sound\u201d that rose in the 1950s and \u201960s. Just when country music settles into a popular style, another comes along to reorder both the fans\u2019 and the artists\u2019 understanding of what the genre is.\n\nComing in for a long windup, \u201cCountry Music\u201d travels from the syndicated TV success of \u201cHee Haw\u201d (filled with hillbilly stereotypes, yet remarkably effective at sharing country with untapped audiences) to the countrypolitan \u201cUrban Cowboy\u201d years of crossover pop in the early 1980s. The film ends, more or less, in an era of sold-out concert arenas and Garth Brooks\u2019s multimillion record sales.\n\nThere\u2019s a slight bit of foreshadowing of country\u2019s 21st-century future, as corporate consolidation would shape and restrict the music. (Sorry \u2014 there\u2019s no breakdown of the Dixie Chicks controversy, bro-country, line dancing, red Solo cups or \u201cJesus, Take the Wheel.\u201d) Also given short shrift is how country seemed to corner the cultural market on patriotism in the decades between the Reagan Revolution and the September 2001 terrorist attacks \u2014 unless I missed it, there\u2019s no mention of Lee Greenwood\u2019s \u201cGod Bless the U.S.A.\u201d (a.k.a. \u201cProud to Be an American\u201d), which for many became as sacred as the national anthem.\n\n\n\nSingers Travis Tritt and Marty Stuart on the Grand Ole Opry in 1991. (Bill Thorup/Grand Ole Opry Archives)\n\nBurns\u2019s resolute, objective path through country\u2019s history is somewhat hindered by a lack of analysis. For all its gorgeous sounds, rare footage and tearful reminiscences, \u201cCountry Music\u201d needs a deeper probe, one that would pursue both psychological and sociological angles. Filled to bursting with mutual praise and admiration for the artistry and entrepreneurial prowess of Nashville, it could use a few more critics and even a contrarian or two.\n\n[Fall premiere dates for returning shows, including \u2018The Crown,\u2019 \u2018Mrs. Maisel\u2019 and \u2018This Is Us\u2019]\n\n\u201cCountry Music\u201d mostly glides past the industry\u2019s lousy inability to produce more than one legend who is also a person of color (Charley Pride is here with his pile of No. 1 hits, a miraculous exception, then Freddy Fender and then . . . precious few). But it is far better on the equally fraught subject of gender, celebrating the women of country who succeeded despite the barriers that would hold them back. A particularly sharp moment comes as a supercut compilation of Porter Wagoner and other famous male hosts, singers and producers, who condescendingly refer to female singers \u2014 grown women, some of them already chart-topping successes \u2014 as \u201cpretty little girls,\u201d \u201cthis little gal,\u201d \u201cpurdy little lady\u201d and \u201clittle bitty girl . . . with a big ol\u2019 voice.\u201d\n\n\u201c \u2018C\u2019mon and put your hands together and make her feel welcome,\u2019 \u201d singer and \u201cGrand Ole Opry\u201d star Jeannie Seely recalls, mimicking those patronizing introductions. \u201cThe connotation being she isn\u2019t welcome \u2014 just make her feel that way.\u201d\n\nAnd while \u201cCountry Music\u201d makes a strong case for the genre\u2019s place as an American institution, it fails to account for why \u2014 despite its enormous success and sonic ubiquity \u2014 it still isn\u2019t regarded as the predominant music of its time.\n\nThink about it this way: When someone makes a movie or TV show about a certain era in modern American history, they still pull from the rock and pop playlist \u2014 or big-band and jazz, if earlier \u2014 unless the story is specifically about regional, country people. Otherwise, when we seek to evoke and reference the American sound, country remains on the fringe.\n\nMight this have something to do with country\u2019s consistent inability to celebrate and promote diversity? Shouldn\u2019t a 16-hour documentary of its history either refute that premise or make it more clear? Shouldn\u2019t we come away with a better sense of how country divided us as much as it might have united us?\n\n\n\nJohnny Cash fiddles with his instruments at his home in California around 1960. (Sony Music Archives)\n\nWhere \"Country Music\" works best, of course, is on the emotional level. As daunting as it may seem to watch all 16 hours, the music is more than enough to carry a viewer enthusiastically along \u2014 and worth the time to do so. It will break you down and lift you up. The artistry will astonish and surprise you. When Rosanne Cash at last forgives her father, Johnny, for his failings, there is a remarkable sense of release.\n\nOn that note, hardly an episode of \u201cCountry Music\u201d passed where I did not find myself thinking of my late father. One hallmark of his midlife crisis in the early \u201980s (besides, as Tammy Wynette once sang it, the D-I-V-O-R-C-E) included his resolute return to his country-boy, Oklahoma roots \u2014 especially as conveyed by what was playing on the FM radio in his truck, where he found a powerful relatability in what Nashville was serving: the cheatin\u2019 hearts, the carousin\u2019 with Waylon and Willie and the boys; the outlaw sensibility, the high-lonesome independent streak.\n\nAs a teenager trying to wrest the dial back to the rock and new-wave stations, it was my great failing to hear the twang but not the solace. I hear it now, of course, in bits and pieces, and regrettably too late. It\u2019s a feeling that\u2019s sort of like a country song itself, with the circle unbroken and no storyteller ever so lost as to fall beyond redemption.\n\nCountry Music (eight episodes, about 16 hours) begins Sunday at 8 p.m. on WETA and MPT.
