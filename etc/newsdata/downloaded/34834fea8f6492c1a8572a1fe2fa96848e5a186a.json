(\u201cPOET\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (OTCQX: POETF; TSX Venture: PTK), the designer and developer of the POET Optical Interposer and Photonic Integrated Circuits (PICs) for the data center and tele-communication markets, today announced that the Closing of the sale of the Company\u2019s subsidiary, DenseLight Semiconductors Pte. Ltd. (\u201cDenseLight\u201d) to DenseLight Semiconductor Technology (Shanghai) Co. Ltd (the \u201cBuyer\u201d or \u201cDL Shanghai\u201d) will close on or before Friday, November 8, 2019.\n\n\n\nWidely reported instances of more strict and careful review of foreign currency conversion applications by regulators in the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) have curtailed several forms of foreign investment by Chinese investors and prolonged the Overseas Direct Investment (\u201cODI\u201d) process1. In the case of the sale of the shares of DenseLight to the Buyer, the result is a short delay in the ODI process and subsequent transfers needed to make the first tranche payment of US$8 million to the Company. With the extended review process likely to continue for some time, and to ensure that all interested investors in DL Shanghai are able to participate, the Company has agreed to receive the total purchase price of US$26 million in three tranches, with the first being a payment of US$8 million on or before November 8, plus two additional installments of US$13 million on or before December 31, 2019 and another for US$5 million on or before May 31, 2020. The additional US$2 million to be paid on behalf of the Buyer to Oak Capital for due diligence, legal and other expenses will be made to POET and remitted to Oak Capital with the second tranche payment. The Buyer has provided documentary evidence that the funds needed for the first tranche payment are present in its accounts and will continue to inform the Company on the status of its ODI applications, conversion to US dollars and associated bank transfers. The sale will close upon receipt of the US$8 million into POET\u2019s account.\n\nThe Company also announced that it had received final approval for the sale transaction from the TSX Venture Exchange and confirmed, as previously agreed between the Buyer and the Company, that DL Shanghai will be responsible for the operating expenses of DenseLight Singapore beginning on November 1, 2019.\n\nAbout POET Technologies Inc.\n\nPOET Technologies is the designer and developer of optical engines based on its innovative Optical Interposer platform.
