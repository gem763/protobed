A reader came across two ultra rare four and five leaf clovers in a book that dated back 200 years\n\nDried plants - and in some cases spiders, roaches, book worms and even a lizard - were also stumbled upon.\n\nIt seems that many people wanted to bestow some luck on to the next reader who picked up their book, with numerous people finding $2 bills or notes scrawled with the word, 'surprise'.\n\nSpeaking of good fortune, what could be luckier than finding a rare four-leaf clover, as one reader did in a 200-year-old book.\n\nIn more bizarre instances, someone found a 'drug stash' in a hollowed-out book while another person came across a crushed can.

When readers picked up editions of novels and were stunned to find the author's signature.\n\nThat's gotta be worth something: A shocked reader found a photo and an autograph of Stephen King inside a library copy of The Shining\n\nLucky!

A library user was taken aback to find that the previous reader of their book had used a taco as a book mark\n\nRemember these? A Reddit user joked, 'What are these save buttons doing in my book' as they came across some outdated floppy discs\n\nDisplay: A wall of 'found' items compiled by a used book store makes for fascinated glimpse into people's personal lives\n\nYikes! A reader stumbled upon a dead lizard in a book and took to Reddit to share the questionable find\n\nHistory: One woman shared how her son had found a near-100-year-old school report card for a Ms Anamae Marie Valpey\n\nRations: A history-lover was happy to find Government-issued ration coupons inside a vintage Hemmingway novel\n\nDamage: A reader who thought their book was carved into, suddenly realized that it had been burrowed into by a book worm\n\nWordsmith: A reader found this cute poem tucked into a children's book from 1949\n\nMysterious: A reader found this note, likely written by a child or teenager, in a book in a cafe five years ago\n\nWho is he? A reader found this rather hilarious snap in a 1947 Red Cross First Aid textbook\n\nHidden: A book lover picked up this tome at a thrift store only to find it contained a hidden compartment with a $200 check from 1994", "description": "A list of what people have found in thrift store, library and charity book stores belies belief: particularly, a drug stash, a taco, inset, vintage ads from the 1800s, left, plane tickets from now-defunct airlines.", "authors": ["Freya Drohan For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/16/19498406-0-image-a-34_1570634850514.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
