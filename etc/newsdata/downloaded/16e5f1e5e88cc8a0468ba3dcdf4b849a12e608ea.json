The system lessened but still resulted in heavy rain.\n\nGaza, ruled by the militant Hamas group and blockaded by Israel and Egypt, has rundown infrastructure and residents are vulnerable to such mishaps.\n\nHealth officials said the teenager touched the electric pole in a puddle and died immediately.
