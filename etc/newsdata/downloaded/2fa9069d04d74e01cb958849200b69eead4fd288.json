The bank last hiked in October of 2018 but has stood pat for the seven meetings since then. That's a time frame that has seen central banks around the world cut their rates in an attempt to offset the damage from an ongoing trade war.\n\nSo far, the Bank of Canada has been able to stay on the sidelines. But that may not last.\n\nBroadly speaking, the bank will cut its rate to stimulate the economy, and it will raise the rate in order to tame inflation. The bank's rate filters down to the broader economy by impacting the rates that Canadian borrowers and savers get for things like mortgage and rate-sensitive investments.\n\nTD Bank economist Brian DePratto is among those who think the bank is on track for a rate cut sooner rather than later.\n\n\"Reading between the lines, nearly every positive note in today's statement was balanced by a qualifier,\" he noted. \"Even if the Bank of Canada has not telegraphed an October rate, we believe the backdrop makes it the most likely outcome.\"\n\nPrior to the decision, traders thought there was a slight chance of a rate cut. Now that the bank has said it will stand pat for now, however, investors are pricing in about a 50/50 chance of a rate cut next month.\n\nThe Canadian dollar gained about a third of a cent when the rate decision came out. (Mark Blinch/Reuters)\n\nNot everyone is convinced that will happen.\n\nJames Laird, president of mortgage brokerage Canwise Financial, said Wednesday he saw nothing in the bank's statement to suggest the bank would be in a rush to lower rates.\n\n\"This announcement should throw some cold water on the prediction that we could see a rate cut as soon as next month,\" Laird said.\n\nCurrency investors are similarly skeptical. All things being equal, a rate cut is bad for a country's currency, because it reduces the value of investments in that currency. So if a rate cut is coming, a currency should decline.\n\nBut that's not what happened on Wednesday. The Canadian dollar jumped up a third of a cent after the Bank of Canada's decision came out. That's a sign that currency investors don't think a cut is imminent.", "description": "Canada's central bank has decided to keep its benchmark rate at 1.75 per cent, despite 'escalating trade conflicts' that are starting to take a toll on the country's economy.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4863762.1539630916!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/boc-business-outlook-20181016.jpg"}
