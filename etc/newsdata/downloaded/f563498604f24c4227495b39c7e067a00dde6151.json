The country\u2019s popular new president, 38-year-old Nayib Bukele, has asked the Trump administration for more help to resettle deported migrants, along with more temporary U.S. worker visas for Salvadorans.\n\nThe Salvadoran government has also been pushing for the U.S. to grant permanent legal status to the 200,000 Salvadorans living in the U.S. under a program called Temporary Protected Status, which the administration has ended.\n\n\u201cThe main issue is to protect our people that are forced to flee the country,\u201d Ms. Hill said. \u201cWe are talking about giving them more security and increasing legal alternatives for safe migration.\u201d\n\nThe Friday deal forms another plank of President Trump\u2019s regional strategy to force asylum seekers to look for refuge in countries other than the U.S. The Mexican government has agreed to drastically step up border enforcement on its own southern border, contributing to a drop in border crossers coming to the U.S. in the last couple months.\n\nAs the migrant crisis on the U.S. border with Mexico intensifies, government agency leaders have been invited to testify before the House Committee on Oversight and Reform. Here's a look at the conditions drawing scrutiny and the answers lawmakers will be seeking.

Currently, the U.S. has just one safe-third-country agreement, with Canada.\n\nIn July, the Trump administration struck another safe-third-country agreement with Guatemala. The agreement has yet to be implemented.\n\nGuatemala, like El Salvador, carries the State Department\u2019s second-highest travel-safety warning, advising most Americans to reconsider travel there.\n\nEl Salvador\u2019s murder rate fell by more than half between 2015 and 2018, to 50.3 homicides per 100,000 people, according to the Igarap\u00e9 Institute, a think tank in Brazil that tracks global violence. That still ranks El Salvador as one of the most dangerous countries in the world, leading some refugee advocates to say it isn\u2019t a well-suited destination for people fleeing violence.\n\nThe administration is pushing to strike similar agreements with the governments of Honduras and Panama. An agreement with Honduras could be announced within weeks, officials said.\n\nMr. Trump this year threatened to cut off humanitarian aid to what is known as the Northern Triangle \u2014El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras\u2014sparking criticism from some members of Congress who said the move would only exacerbate the crises that push migrants north. The government has since reversed some of those cuts, but the State Department has said most projects in those countries won\u2019t be funded going forward.\n\nPresident Trump said the U.S. will end Central American aid as thousands of migrants march toward the U.S. border.

Just 48 people have been granted asylum in the tiny Central American nation by the end of 2018, according to the United Nations refugee agency, while there were 18 pending applications.\n\nBy contrast, the U.N. agency estimates some 71,500 Salvadorans have been internally displaced by widespread violence. Around 46,800 Salvadorans sought asylum world-wide in 2018, ranking the nation sixth among countries of origin for new asylum seekers, according to the U.N.\n\n\u201cEl Salvador has an emerging asylum system that reflects the low demand. That\u2019s why there is no so much infrastructure right now to handle a possible higher flow,\u201d said Giovanni Bassu, the U.N. refugee agency\u2019s representative for Central America and Cuba. \u201cTo build [a more robust asylum system] in El Salvador won\u2019t be easy or quick.\u201d\n\n\u2014Robbie Whelan contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Michelle Hackman at Michelle.Hackman@wsj.com and Juan Montes at juan.montes@wsj.com", "description": "The Trump administration reached a deal with the government of El Salvador to send some asylum seekers from third countries back to El Salvador, in the latest effort to dissuade migrants from entering the U.S. illegally.", "authors": ["Michelle Hackman", "Juan Montes", "Michelle.Hackman Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109359/social", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
