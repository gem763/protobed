He is alleged to have driven his silver 2018 Dodge pickup in reverse through the windows on the northwest side of the restaurant. It came to rest against the front counter\n\nEmployees were ordered by their manager to the back of the restaurant (pictured above) and then exited out the rear door.\n\nLincoln Police Chief Jeff Bliemeister said cops seized computers from Cimino's apartment but found no immediate evidence of a premeditated motive for the rampage, reports the Lincoln Journal Star.\n\nCimino had lived in the area for a short while and was even known to police, but he did not have an arrest record, after cops ran a background investigation on the man.\n\nThe violence erupted when Cimino was unhappy with his food, shortly before 1 p.m.\n\nEmployee Thomas Arias, 15, told the Lincoln Journal Star that he was working behind the counter when he heard a disturbance coming from the dining room. When he looked to see, Arias said he spotted Cimino flipping over tables and throwing food.\n\n'He was yelling, 'It's just a f---ing sandwich,'' the teen worker recalled.\n\nEmployees were ordered by their manager to the back of the restaurant and then exited out the rear door.\n\nAnother patron Todd Ogden, who is president and CEO of the Downtown Lincoln Association, and who was at the restaurant with his wife, tackled Cimino from behind for screaming attacking customers, reports the Lincoln Journal Star.\n\nThat's when Cimino returned with a vengeance, backing up his pickup truck into the restaurant.\n\nLincoln Police Chief Jeff Bliemeister(pictured above) said cops seized computers from Cimino's apartment but found no immediate evidence of a premeditated motive for the rampage\n\nCustomers are seen running for cover in a video taken of the rage moment, after Cimino drives the silver 2018 Dodge pickup in reverse through the windows on the northwest side of the restaurant. It came to rest against the front counter and he is seen punching the restaurant's equipment.\n\nHall, on line when Cimino returned to menace more people inside the restaurant, noticed the enraged man was armed with a commercially available stun gun. When he came at Hall, the railroad cop tried to calm the situation down.\n\n'The cop was like, 'Calm down and back off,' but the guy kept approaching,' recalled Arias. 'So the cop pulled his gun and shot him'.\n\nThere were no other injuries. Chief Bliemeister said the a grand jury would step in to review the findings of an investigation and make a final determination of what prompted such violence from Cimino.\n\nHall also will be brought in for questioning, said Bliemeister.", "description": "A disgruntled Chick-fil-A customer armed with a stun gun was fatally shot  after raging at one of the chicken chain's restaurants and backing his truck into establishment.", "authors": ["Ralph R.
