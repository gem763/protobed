Bullock introduced what his campaign calls an \u201cAccomplished Teacher Initiative,\u201d which would be a free post-secondary institution that trains teachers and sends them to teach in underserved areas. His proposal also includes fully funding the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act during his first term, and he would increase funding for breakfast and after-school meal programs.\n\nHigher Education\n\nBullock said he would make community college free, and extend Pell Grant eligibility to students who want to earn \u201cemployer-recognized certificates.\u201d\n\nWith Congress\u2019 approval, Bullock would offer tax credits to employers who have apprentices or offer work-based learning opportunities, and employers who help their employees pay off student debt.\n\nHis plan would allow employers to contribute up to $5,250 per year to an employee\u2019s student loan repayments tax-free. Employees would receive those contributions without having to pay income tax on them.\n\n\"$5,250 is the same amount that Section 127 of the tax code now treats as tax-exempt for employer-provided tuition assistance,\u201d Galia Slayen, Bullock\u2019s communications director told POLITICO. \u201cWith the average student loan payments totaling $393/month, an annual $5,250 benefit \u2014 or $437/month \u2014 would allow most people to get their full monthly payment covered under Governor Bullock\u2019s plan.\u201d\n\nHow much would it cost?\n\n\"We expect the total cost to be about $250 billion, and will pay for it by returning tax rates to pre-2017 Trump tax cut levels for income above $200,000,\" Slayen said.\n\nBullock\u2019s plan does not include specifics on how the funds will be divided, nor how his initiatives would be implemented. His proposal says that he would request higher education funding in his annual budget proposal and work with Congress to pass legislation.\n\nHe would also direct the Education Department to prioritize grants and loan forgiveness program for underserved and low-performing schools, and would provide grants and loan forgiveness programs to people who commit to teach in those schools. He also vowed to evaluate the Title I funding process.\n\nWhat have other candidates proposed?", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/11/73/6564aa264761a69faaf435d975b0/191011-steve-bullock-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
