But it will have the same effect.\n\nNow that the transcript has been released, it\u2019s The New York Times that doesn\u2019t want anyone to see it. (RELATED: Trump Is Handling The Presidency Like A Mafia Leader \u2014 That\u2019s Why He May Get Impeached)\n\nThe transcript I\u2019d like to see is the one of Nancy Pelosi reading the Trump transcript.\n\nF@@@@@@CK! Whose f***ing idea was it to demand this goddamn transcript?\n\nF@CK!\n\nF@@CK!\n\nF@@@CK!\n\nThe absolute worst version for Trump \u2014 i.e. the one being repeated non-stop on MSNBC \u2014 is that he did exactly what Obama and Biden were doing to Ukraine: intimidating an ally into giving us something in exchange for the foreign aid we were giving them.\n\nBiden himself bragged about getting Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor fired by threatening to withhold a big fat check from them.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 argument is: No, no, no! When WE were pressuring Ukraine, we were doing it for good! Don\u2019t you understand? We\u2019re good; they\u2019re bad.\n\nThe other reason the media are going to have to bury this transcript is that Trump brought up a few items that the media have been hoping the public would never find out about.\n\nTrump said: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution, so if you can look into it \u2026 It sounds horrible to me.\u201d\n\nWell, that\u2019s something the media haven\u2019t mentioned before. Ninety-nine percent of Americans will be hearing about the funny business with Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, for the first time with the release of this transcript. (RELATED: Take It From This Campaign Finance Attorney: Trump Is In The Clear In My Area Of Law)\n\nWhy did Vice President Biden order the Ukrainian president to fire the prosecutor investigating the Ukrainian company paying his son millions of dollars? Are Democrats claiming that this company was clean as a whistle and it was an absolute OUTRAGE that it was being investigated?\n\nUkraine was looking into the company that conveniently placed Hunter Biden on its board long before Trump came on the scene. Something must have made the Ukrainian prosecutor want to investigate Biden\u2019s company \u2014 and it sure wasn\u2019t to curry favor with the Obama/Biden administration.\n\nThe second issue the media does not want anyone to think about is CrowdStrike.\n\nWhat is CrowdStrike, you ask? That is the cybersecurity firm that is the sole source of the claim that the Russians hacked the DNC\u2019s emails \u2014 which launched the conspiracy theories that tied our country in knots for the past three years.\n\nThe Russian collusion story was originally hatched by Hillary Clinton in the summer of 2016 to cover up the utter corruption revealed by the dump of Democratic National Committee emails on Wikileaks. As was her practice whenever a scandal threatened to engulf her, Hillary rushed out and told the press to investigate something else.\n\nAnd \u201cthe great story\u201d about the DNC email hack wasn\u2019t about a \u201cvast right-wing conspiracy\u201d \u2014 as she claimed when the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke. No, this time, it was a vast Russian conspiracy!\n\nAt the time, the entire media laughed at Hillary\u2019s Russian conspiracy nonsense \u2014 The New York Times, New York Newsday, the Los Angeles Times and so on. But then Trump won the election, and suddenly the Russia conspiracy seemed totally believable. What else could explain how Americans could put this boob in the White House?\n\nThe subsequent three years of breathless Russia coverage was based entirely on the word of one cybersecurity firm, CrowdStrike, that the DNC\u2019s emails had been hacked by Russia.\n\nRecall that the DNC wouldn\u2019t allow the FBI or any other U.S. government official anywhere near its computers. That\u2019s precisely why so many cybersecurity experts doubted that it was the Russians: The FBI was never allowed to perform its own investigation. (RELATED: Trump Transcript Shows Him Trying To Stop Corruption, Nothing Else)\n\nCrowdStrike was founded by Ukrainian Dmitri Alperovitch (now an American citizen apparently \u2014 because who isn\u2019t?) and funded by the fanatically anti-Russian Ukrainian oligarch Viktor Pinchuk Foundation.\n\nTalk about interfering with our democracy! Alperovitch and Pinchuk sent one political party and nine-tenths of the American media off on a wild goose chase into Russian collusion that, after years of accusations, investigations and embarrassing conspiracy-mongering \u2026 turned up goose eggs.\n\nThe entire Russian insanity was launched by a couple of Ukrainians. I think a lot of us would like to get to the bottom of that.\n\nThis is why Trump said to President Zelensky: \u201cI would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike \u2026 I guess you have one of your wealthy people \u2026 The server, they say Ukraine has it.\u201d\n\n(How\u2019d you like to be the Ukrainian translator for a Trump conversation?)\n\nTrump has been justly criticized for hiring his daughter and son-in-law at the White House. But at least when he pressures a foreign leader for a favor, it\u2019s to investigate corruption, not to get a prosecutor off his son\u2019s back. Maybe Biden\u2019s son was guilty, maybe he was innocent. But it is a fact that Joe Biden held up foreign aid to a desperately needy ally in exchange for their halting prosecution that implicated his son. It\u2019s not Trump\u2019s fault that Biden is now running for president.\n\nI\u2019ll give the Democrats this: They\u2019ve gotten so good at trying to remove Trump from office that, instead of three years, their insane accusations blow up in their faces within a week.\n\nAnn Coulter is a syndicated columnist and lawyer.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author and do not reflect the official position of The Daily Caller.", "description": "Democrats asked for the Trump transcript \u2014 but now they don't want to talk about it", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1165474345-e1567364190105.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
