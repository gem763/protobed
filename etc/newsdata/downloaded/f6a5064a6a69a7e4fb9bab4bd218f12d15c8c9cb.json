'It\u2019s the longest living franchise. I don\u2019t think it will go, unless a meteor comes crashing down and that\u2019s it.'\n\nOf a change in gender, he admitted producer Barbara Broccoli would get his full support should she opt to defy convention - and with it author Ian Fleming's realization of the debonair character he first brought to life in 1953 novel Casino Royale - by casting a woman in the role.\n\nClose: Moore shared steamy scenes with then 29-year old actress Tanya Roberts in his final Bond film, 1985 hit A View To A Kill\n\nCo-stars: He also bedded May Day, the character famously played by Grace Jones\n\n'It would be her idea,' he said. 'And if that were the case I\u2019d definitely back her, and I think the fans would go along with that.'\n\nWith current Bond Daniel Craig finishing work on what will be his fifth and final appearance as the secret agent in forthcoming film No Time To Die, the franchise is once back in the public arena.\n\nBut while Moore will forever be remembered for his portrayal of the character, Geoffrey and daughter Ambra, Moore's granddaughter, are hoping to drive his incredible legacy as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador with the launch of a new single dedicated to his memory.\n\nTopical: With current Bond Daniel Craig finishing work on what will be his fifth and final appearance as the secret agent in forthcoming film No Time To Die, the franchise is once back in the public arena\n\nThe track, titled U.N.I (You & I), has been co-written and sung by Geoffrey, with production credits going to Chic guitarist Nile Rodgers, actress Naya Rivera and former Dancing With The Stars professional Julianne Hough, along with Ambra.\n\nAn accompanying video features lip-syncing contributions from more than 50 global celebrities, among them Sir Michael Caine, Stephen Fry, David Walliams, Joanna Lumley and Piers Morgan.\n\n'It\u2019s a really up, positive song,' Geoffrey explained. 'To the point where I think we generate momentum through friends of Ambra\u2019s grandfather.'\n\nFor a good cause: Geoffrey and daughter Ambra Moore have teamed up to launch a new UNICEF single in honour of Sir Roger's memory and his humanitarian legacy\n\nMoore's ambassadorial work with UNICEF began in 1991 after the actor was encouraged to throw his celebrity weight behind the charity by close friend Audrey Hepburn.\n\nHis commitment to humanitarian causes also resulted in the narration of a video for PETA, in which the animal charity successfully railed against the wholesale distribution of foie gras.\n\nMoore's involvement in the project encouraged positive change, with London department store Selfridges later removing the product from their shelves.\n\nFamiliar faces: Michael Caine is one of 50 celebrities to feature in the track's accompanying video\n\nGetting involved: Liam Neeson and Natalie Dormer also lip-sync the track in a new promotional video\n\nIcon: Joan Collins also throws her weight behind the new project, which is being driven by Geoffrey and Amber\n\n'You can\u2019t really say no to Audrey,' Geoffrey said of his father's initial connection to UNICEF.\n\n'She said please come along, and that\u2019s when she really realised the power of stardom and how she could bring this matter to a wider audience.\n\n'He didn\u2019t have much to say because he didn\u2019t know much about it, but as a crash course she said come and see what I see, and he couldn\u2019t stop crying. He said \"this is not for me, it\u2019s not a good image,\" and she said \"on the contrary Roger, I was like that at the beginning too.\"\n\n'So he continued that goodwill programme, Audrey was the founder but she needed a contemporary who had that kind of reach to a wider audience. And he kept it going.'\n\nU.N.I (You & I) is available to download from the track's official website, with all proceeds going straight to UNICEF.", "description": "The actor, who passed away in 2017, played Bond on seven highly entertaining occasions over a 12-year period after taking the Walther PPK from Sean Connery ahead of his debut.", "authors": ["Jason Chester For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/01/19278986-0-image-a-34_1570150085924.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
