We have a lot of players of different ethnicities and skin colour. I don\u2019t think we have as a big a problem like, for example, England do.\n\n\u201cIn the Bulgarian championship, we have not had such problems while there have been incidents in all levels of English football involving racism. I consider that something normal because it is a big country with a very diverse population. But we don\u2019t have this problem in Bulgaria - I can assure you of that.\u201d", "description": "Bulgaria head coach Krassimir Balakov has claimed it is English football and not his own country that has a widespread problem with racism.", "authors": ["Matt Law", "Football News Correspondent", "Sam Wallace", "Jason Burt"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/13/TELEMMGLPICT000212930749-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqMJPon70mhaLfCzXv-FMPEFeRj4zTTmVZevAAViyuXMc.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
