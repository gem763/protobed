The Europeans came back with a totally different date for a set of reasons that was theirs.\u201d\n\nHowever, Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, said three months was his recommendation. A \u2018flextension\u2019 \u2013 allowing the UK to leave before 31 January, if it ratifies the deal \u2013 is highly likely.\n\nMr Clarke warned a bill to trigger a December election would trigger a host of amendments, saying: \u201cPeople will want to reduce the voting age to 16 for a start, but I think a lot of people will be thinking of a lot of other ingenious things they could put in.\u201d", "description": "A pre-Christmas general election has moved a step closer after a government minister said it was the only way to break the Brexit deadlock and Labour appeared to give its backing.
