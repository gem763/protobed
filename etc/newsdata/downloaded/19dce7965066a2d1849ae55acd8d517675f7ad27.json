That idea \u2013 the name anyway \u2013 didn\u2019t sit well with pretty much everyone that had even a remote interest in the Mustang\u2019s legacy. The company reversed course on the name but not the idea, and we now have our first hint of how this new offering will look in a short teaser video, and an official line image from Ford.\n\nCrossing over:\n\nThe video first appeared on advocate.socialchorus.com, followed by Ford posting it on social media and on its website. The 22-second clip shows close-ups of a full-size clay model along with a line sketch of the forthcoming SUV.\n\nThe date 11-17-19 (17th of November 2019) basically confirms when this new crossover will be revealed, which incidentally is a Sunday leading up to media days at the Los Angeles Auto Show. We contacted Ford about this video since we couldn\u2019t find it at official Blue Oval channels, and the company did confirm it\u2019s a legitimate teaser. We were also sent a high-resolution version of the line sketch, which you can see at the top of the article, along with a promise that more information would be coming soon.\n\nWhat do we know about this crossover as of now? Not much, unfortunately, save for it being based on the Mustang and that it will be Ford\u2019s first fully electric offering built from the ground-up to be an EV. Ford has been slow to enter the electric realm, but the teaser sketch certainly reveals what looks like a shapely offering in the exploding crossover market. The Mustang\u2019s influence is easily seen, and if we may take a minute to brag, it doesn\u2019t look too far off from the exclusive renderings we\u2019ve created over the last year or so.\n\n2020 Ford Mustang Mach 1 More\n\nMustang based electric crossover rendering More\n\nAs for the name, Ford has been careful to say Mustang-based in the few instances for which the EV crossover topic has come up. Beyond that, Mach-E could be a candidate as we\u2019ve heard that mentioned on occasion. It seems unlikely the Blue Oval would revive an older nameplate such as Maverick or Falcon.\n\nIn any case, we will have full knowledge no later than 17 November on what could be an attractive, sporty offering in the burgeoning EV crossover market.\n\n\n\n", "description": "The connection to the Mustang is unmistakable, even in this simple line sketch.", "authors": ["Feedback", "Christopher Smith"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/IjdWrZ037PYkQMu.M.K8vw--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/motor1_uk_340/b0ee2ca3ac406a51810c991d76f0eb00", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
