Iran has barred female spectators from football and other stadiums for around 40 years, with cleric arguing that women must be shielded from the masculine atmosphere and sight of semi-clad men.\n\nLast month, FIFA ordered Iran to allow women access to stadiums without any restrictions and in numbers determined by demand for tickets.\n\nThe directive came after a fan dubbed \u201cBlue Girl\u201d died after setting herself on fire in fear of being jailed for dressing up as a boy in order to attend a match.\n\nIranian women will now be able to attend their national team's upcoming Iran\u2019s 2022 World Cup qualifier against Cambodia at Tehran\u2019s Azadi Stadium on October 10.\n\nDon't Miss 171 SHARES 431 SHARES 123 SHARES\n\nAFP\n\nThe announcement that some 3,500 segregated seats of the nearly 80,000 at the stadium would be reserved for women led to a joyous reaction from long-suffering followers of the sport.\n\n\"I got a ticket, I will go to the stadium!\" tweeted a woman, adding: \"Can you believe I'm saying this?\"\n\nIntense campaign from women\u2019s rights activists and increased pressure from FIFA led to the milestone decision.\n\nOne of the 3,500 women to have secured a ticket was Raha Poorbakhsh, a football journalist. \u201cI still can\u2019t believe this is going to happen because after all these years of working in this field, watching everything on television, now I can experience everything in person,\u201d she told AFP.\n\nAbout 20 Irish women attended a World Cup qualifier in 2001, and four years later a few dozen Iranian women were allowed to watch the national \u201cTeam Melli\u201d take on Bahrain.\n\nAFP\n\nMany Iranian men also expressed their joy about the victory for Iranian women while expressing the hope that the women's attendance at Azadi Stadium won't be a one-off event.\n\n\"I bought tickets for my mother and my wife,\" said the deputy of Tehran's sports municipality, Farzad Radboy, on Twitter. He said he will be baby-sitting his 10-month-old daughter on October 10 so that his mother and his wife can watch the match.\n\nDespite cheer, some hardliners protested outside of parliament while calling for action against those behind the decision.\n\nThe demonstrators said the action allowing female spectators to watch the game was not in line with calls by senior clerics -- including Aytatollah Makarem Shirazi -- who have said in the past that it was \"unsuitable\" for women to enter stadiums due to the mingling of sexes and because of men's \"improper\" uniforms that reveal too much of their bodies.\n\nThey claim that atmosphere inside the stadiums is inappropriate for women.\n\nDespite scores of die-hard female fans for many sports, Iran is the only country that bans women from attending male sporting events.", "description": "After decades of being banned from male sporting events, Iranian women will be able to enter a football stadium on Thursday.
