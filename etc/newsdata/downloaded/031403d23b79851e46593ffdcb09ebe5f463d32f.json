But insiders previously told Business Insider they questioned the validity of the science behind its products.\n\nAfter months of challenges and setbacks, the Silicon Valley health startup uBiome is shutting down.\n\nThe company could not extend the loans that had been funding its bankruptcy and is now appointing a trustee to oversee its liquidation, according to documents viewed by Business Insider. The plan still requires approval from the bankruptcy court.\n\n\"I have to share some bad news,\" uBiome said in an email to staff that was seen by Business Insider. \"We will not be able to continue to operate as normal because we won't have the funding.\"\n\nuBiome had previously filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy, and was looking for a buyer to take over its assets, save jobs, and keep parts of the core business running. That is no longer happening. Instead, the company will close down.\n\nuBiome confirmed the liquidation in a press release shortly after this story was written.\n\n\"Management and the independent directors of the Board of uBiome have determined that, without consensus among the Committee, the lenders and the Company, the conversion to a case under Chapter 7 is in the best interests of uBiome and its stakeholders,\" the release said.\n\nCourt documents in uBiome's initial bankruptcy filing said the company may owe millions of dollars to health insurance companies, and could also face criminal and civil penalties from ongoing investigations related to its billing practices.\n\nThe company laid off half its staff this summer. In addition, insiders told Business Insider that the company's key science was flawed from the start, prompting the company to start an internal investigation. A top science journal where uBiome published its basic research is also investigating.\n\nuBiome raised more than $100 million from some of Silicon Valley's top venture capital firms on the promise of providing new insights into the microbiome, the trillions of bacteria that live in and on each of us. The startup's main products evaluated an individual's microbiome using a sample of their poop.", "description": "The company is converting its bankruptcy filing from Chapter 11 to Chapter 7, a much more serious form of bankruptcy.", "authors": ["Erin Brodwin"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5cf68bef11e2053b7d214039?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
