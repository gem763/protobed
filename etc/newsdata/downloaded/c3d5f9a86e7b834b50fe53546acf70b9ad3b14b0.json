(Reuters) - Members of the close-knit Santa Barbara boating community gathered on Tuesday to construct a makeshift memorial to the 34 people believed to have perished when their dive boat caught fire and sank off the California coast.\n\nA woman pauses to look over a makeshift memorial near Truth Aquatics as the search continues for those missing in a pre-dawn fire that sank a commercial diving boat off a Southern California island near Santa Barbara, California, U.S., September 3, 2019. REUTERS/Mike Blake\n\nAs of Tuesday, 20 badly burned bodies had been recovered from wreckage of the Conception, which caught fire near Santa Cruz Island early on Monday, and officials say they expect 14 other people died in the fast-moving blaze.\n\n\u201cAlmost everyone, because we are right on the water here, has been out on (the Conception). We all have a personal connection with it,\u201d said Judy Weisman, 72, as she visited the growing memorial of flowers, candles and pictures at the boat\u2019s dock.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just such a horrific notion to think what the people down in the below decks, the people sleeping down there must have gone through,\u201d Weisman said. \u201cHow terrifying.\u201d\n\nOnly five people are known to have survived the fast-moving flames, the boat\u2019s captain and four crew members who were above deck and escaped on an inflatable boat after jumping off the Conception. The single crew member who did not survive may have been sleeping below deck with the passengers at the time.\n\nMourners who made their way to the dock wove flowers into a wooden fence and left behind dive flippers and sea shells in remembrance. One of the shells was inscribed with the name \u201cKristy.\u201d\n\nA framed photograph of a smiling young couple had a note tucked inside that read: \u201cI love you Allie - and you know I always will! I miss you forever. Love, Rob.\u201d\n\nOne young woman visiting the memorial in tears said only that she had lost a close friend in the accident.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still a small town. It\u2019s still a small town atmosphere and everybody is connected here,\u201d said Michael Gallagher, a 53-year-old Santa Barbara County firefighter\n\n\u201cQuite honestly, this area has gone through a lot between the Thomas Fire and then right after that the debris flow from Montecito and Carpenteria where people were killed, and now this,\u201d Gallagher said, referring to recent natural disasters to befall the community.\n\nThe Thomas Fire, which broke out in December 2017, destroyed more than 1,000 homes and other structures in Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties. The towns of Montecito and Carpenteria were struck by mudslides in January 2018 from hillsides left barren by the fire.", "description": "Members of the close-knit Santa Barbara boating community gathered on Tuesday to construct a makeshift memorial to the 34 people believed to have perished when their dive boat caught fire and sank off the California coast.", "authors": ["Omar Younis", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1425994730&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF830AN"}
