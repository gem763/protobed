I still am, but at least my children can wake up every day their father is going to live.\n\n\"Maisy has seen me battling cancer for six years, it has affected her too.\n\n\"It was very traumatic for her. She visited me while I was in hospital and was distraught when she left. She completely broke down.\n\n\"She's only eight, so we didn't go into too much detail, but we felt like we couldn't lie to her either.\n\n\"For an eight-year-old to deal with all that, it's incredibly.\"\n\nMaisy said she was the \"happiest girl in the world\", adding: \"My daddy is my best friend and I hated him being in hospital, now I've got him back cancer-free for the rest of my life.\"", "description": "Maisy Dickson, of Morecambe, Lancashire, sprinted downstairs to greet her dad, who caught her emotional reaction on video, after he sent her a Snapcat selfie asking for a hug", "authors": ["Brendan Mcfadden", "Image", "Dickson Family", "Swns"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20526802.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_SWNS_CANCER_SURPRISE_07.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
