He embraced his wife, Grace Sugutt, before his team piled in on a tidal wave of admiration.\n\n\"Today we went to the Moon and came back to earth! I am at a loss for words for all the support I have received from all over the world,\" Kipchoge tweeted.\n\nA video posted on Twitter by the National Olympic Committee for Kenya showed the crowd in Eldoret, Kenya \u2013 Kipchoge's hometown \u2013 cheering and jumping as his record time was announced. According to Citizen Digital, a Kenyan news organization, Kipchoge will have a street named after him in Eldoret when he returns.\n\nOn the Hauptallee, a stretch of tree-bordered road that runs through Prater park, where the course was set, teammates lifted Kipchoge up on their shoulders, draping a Kenyan flag around his shoulders.\n\nIn several interviews, Kipchoge has compared his attempt to beat two hours to the effort that goes into putting a man on the moon.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption ALEX HALADA/AFP via Getty Images ALEX HALADA/AFP via Getty Images\n\nKipchoge, 34, had come to dominate the world of marathon running, winning the Chicago Marathon in 2014, the Berlin and London marathons in 2015, and the London Marathon in 2016.\n\nHe competed in the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, snagging the gold medal in the marathon.\n\nThe following year, 2017, saw Kipchoge win another Berlin Marathon and participate in Nike's Breaking2 event, a marathon held on a Formula One racetrack in Monza, Italy. It was the first marathon Kipchoge ran where he sought to break the two-hour mark, assisted by a team of pacesetters who acted as a windshield running in a V-formation around him. The assistance would mean that, if he beat two hours, the record would stand as unofficial.\n\nOn May 6, 2017, he crossed the finish line in Monza 25 seconds past the two-hour mark.\n\nUndeterred, in 2018 Kipchoge won the London Marathon, then turned around and competed in the Berlin Marathon later that year.\n\nAt the time, the men's marathon world record was 2:02:57, held by fellow Kenyan marathoner Dennis Kimetto. Kipchoge beat that time by a minute and 18 seconds, coming in at 2:01:39. He now held the men's world record for the first time in his life.\n\nIf he had stopped then, he would have gone down as one of history's best marathoners. But the glory of the record in Berlin meant that legendary sub-2-hour record, which had eluded him a year before, was back in his sights.\n\nSports Kenyan Runner Eliud Kipchoge Breaks World Marathon Record In Berlin Kenyan Runner Eliud Kipchoge Breaks World Marathon Record In Berlin Listen \u00b7 3:25 3:25\n\nSaturday's feat that tested the upper limits of physical prowess, however, will not be officially recognized as a world record by the International Association of Athletics Federations, much like the Breaking2 event. The race, held in Prater park in the heart of Vienna, was not an open event, the course in the park was evened ahead of time and Kipchoge had a team of 41 pacesetters with him, running in rotating teams of seven.\n\n\"Remember, the 41 pacemakers are among the best athletes ever, in the whole world,\" Kipchoge said. Among them was Matthew Centrowitz, who earned a gold medal for the U.S. in the men's 1500 meters at the 2016 Summer Olympics.\n\nKipchoge was also guided by an electric car that projected a green laser, moving at the pace needed to beat two hours, according to the IAAF.\n\nKipchoge's shoes were also the subject of much interest. He tied on Nike's new model of the NEXT% shoe, equipped with a carbon-fiber plate.\n\nDr. Joyner said it is all about maximizing the runner's energy economy.\n\n\"There's less energy loss with each foot strike. They've tuned it so that the recoil properties of the shoe optimize the ability of the runner to apply force to the ground.\"\n\nBetween the shoes, the pacers, the closed race and the electric car, Joyner said that the phrase \"assisted\" in conjunction with Saturday's marathon needs to be put in context, especially in comparison to Roger Bannister's mile 65 years ago.\n\n\"Bannister had two pacers, the track at Oxford had been recently refurbished, Bannister was a medical student working on maximum human performance, and his shoes had special ultralight spikes,\" Joyner said. \"I see many parallels between him and Mr. Kipchoge.\"\n\nThe lack of sanction has, however, not deterred Kipchoge's supporters. He's now trending on Twitter, and many professional runners and other athletes have voiced their support, like four-time Tour de France winner Chris Froome. According to The Associated Press, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta called Kipchoge shortly after the race.\n\n\"You've made history and made Kenya proud while at it,\" Kenyatta tweeted.\n\nAlexander Tuerk is an intern at Here and Now.", "description": "Accompanied by pacesetters and an electric car, the Kenyan runner set a record Saturday that was long considered not humanly possible.
