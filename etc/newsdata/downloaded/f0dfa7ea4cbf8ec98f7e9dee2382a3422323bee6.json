REUTERS/Stefano Rellandini/File Photo\n\nMILAN/MADRID (Reuters) - A Spanish court has temporarily halted a plan to merge Italian broadcaster Mediaset\u2019s domestic and Spanish business into a Dutch holding company, pending a legal challenge by shareholder Vivendi, Mediaset Espana (TL5.MC) said on Friday.\n\nMediaset\u2019s (MS.MI) second-biggest shareholder Vivendi (VIV.PA) challenged the corporate overhaul in court because the French group sees it as detrimental to minority shareholders.\n\nPending a decision on Vivendi\u2019s lawsuit, the court granted a precautionary suspension.\n\n\u201cMediaset Espana strongly disagree with this interim ruling, and will immediately appeal,\u201d the company said, adding it was confident a higher court would reverse the decision.\n\n\u201cThe reasons behind Mediaset Espana\u2019s position ... are very solid and support the legal, economic and managerial rationale of the accords that have been challenged.\u201d\n\nMediaset\u2019s reorganization plan aims at creating a platform to better pursue pan-European tie-ups to face growing competition in the industry.\n\nVivendi has been a hostile Mediaset shareholder since the tycoons who control them, Vincent Bollore and former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, fell out in 2016 over an aborted pay-TV deal. They have been in a legal war ever since.\n\nBy 1030 GMT shares in Mediaset Espana fell 1.4% having extended losses following the court ruling. Shares in Mediaset were broadly flat.\n\nNeither Vivendi or Mediaset was immediately available for comment.", "description": "A Spanish court has temporarily halted a plan to merge Italian broadcaster Mediaset's domestic and Spanish business into a Dutch holding company, pending a legal challenge by shareholder Vivendi, Mediaset Espana said on Friday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439676228&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A14A", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
