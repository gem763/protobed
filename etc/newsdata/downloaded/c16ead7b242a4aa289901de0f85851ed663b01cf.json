To the south, Southern California Edison also said Tuesday that more than 106,000 of its customers in parts of eight counties could face power cuts.\n\nThe news came as residents in the region\u2019s wine country north of San Francisco marked the two-year anniversary of deadly wildfires that killed 44 and destroyed thousands of homes. San Francisco is the only county in the nine-county Bay Area where power will not be affected.\n\nThe utility had warned of the possibility of a widespread shut-off Monday, prompting residents to flock to stores for supplies as they prepared for dying cellphone batteries, automatic garages that won\u2019t work and lukewarm refrigerators.\n\nFlashlights, batteries and propane tanks for barbecues were in high demand as people prepared for an outage that PG&E said may last \u201cseveral days.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe sold out of lanterns this morning. The shelf is completely empty,\u201d said Howard Gibbs, the manager at Ace Hardware in the town of Lafayette, 20 miles east of San Francisco. \u201cWe\u2019ve got just a few flashlights left, and we\u2019re down to our last couple propane tanks, too.\u201d\n\nOakland Mayor Libby Schaaf asked residents Tuesday not to clog 911 lines with non-emergencies and urged people to be prepared. The city canceled all police officers\u2019 days off in preparation for the outages.\n\n\u201cWe all know the devastation that fires can cause,\u201d she said.\n\nIn 1991, a grass fire torched the Oakland Hills, killing 25 people and destroying more than 3,000 homes.\n\nPG&E said it was informing customers by text and email about where and when the power would be cut. But its website, where it directed people to check whether their addresses would be affected, was not working most of the day Tuesday after being overloaded with visitors.\n\nThe outage will also affect portions of the agricultural Central Valley, the state\u2019s northern and central coasts and the Sierra Nevada foothills where a November wildfire blamed on PG&E transmission lines killed 85 people and devastated the town of Paradise.\n\nJennifer Siemens, who lost her home in Paradise, rents a house in the nearby town of Oroville and said she was bracing for a third blackout in a month.\n\nSiemens had her car gassed up, had stocked up on bottled water and flashlights and made sure all the family\u2019s electronic devices were fully charged.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with the power lines that they have to do this so much?\u201d asked Siemens. \u201cWe don\u2019t want any more fires, obviously, but I feel like they are going a little overboard.\u201d\n\nWinds can knock down live wires and power poles or drive trees and other vegetation into contact with them \u2014 and some of California\u2019s most destructive blazes in recent years were started by PG&E power lines.\n\nBut the planned outages will not be limited to fire-prone areas because the utilities must turn off entire distribution and transmission lines to much wider areas to minimize the risk of wildfires.\n\nSan Francisco-based Pacific Gas & Electric sought bankruptcy protection in January, saying it could not afford an estimated $30 billion in potential damages from lawsuits stemming from recent wildfire. As part of ongoing bankruptcy litigation, last month the company agreed to pay $11 billion to a group of insurance companies representing claimants from deadly Northern California wildfires in 2017 and 2018.\n\nIn Southern California, the largest numbers of potentially affected customers were in Los Angeles County and to the east in San Bernardino and Riverside counties.\n\nPublic agencies throughout the region were urging people to prepare by buying water and non-perishable food, getting a full tank of gas, having cash at hand and parking vehicles outside garages or making sure they know how to manually open their garage doors.\n\nThe California Department of Forestry and Fire Prevention said it increased staffing in preparation for extreme fire weather and what was expected to be the strongest wind event so far this fire season.\n\n\u201cWith some of the most destructive and deadliest fires occurring October through December, we need Californians to not be complacent,\u201d said Cal Fire Chief Thom Porter in a news release. \u201cResidents need to be ready to evacuate at a moment\u2019s notice in the event of a wildfire.\u201d\n\nAt the Dollar General store in Paradise, people were buying candles, gas cans, ice, flashlights, batteries and canned food and the store ran out of ice chests Tuesday morning, said manager Ben Humphries.\n\nHumphries, who moved to Oroville with his family after losing his home in Paradise, said his family lost power two times already in the last month and he was making sure they had enough fuel for their generator and plenty of ice in coolers.\n\nBut he said there was a sense of irony to PG&E\u2019s aggressive action in the area now, after the company opted not to turn off the power ahead of the Nov. 8 fire that wiped out Paradise.\n\n\u201cI understand their concerns but in my opinion it\u2019s too little too late, we already had our town burned to the ground,\u201d Humphries said.", "description": "Pacific Gas & Electric is trying to prevent wildfires ignited by electrical equipment.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS905_pge100_ZG_20191008182656.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
