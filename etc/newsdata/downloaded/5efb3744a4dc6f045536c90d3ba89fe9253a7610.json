Grooming by Melissa DeZarate at The Wall Group.\n\nWithin minutes of my meeting Jonathan Groff, he asks if I would like a slice of cherry pie, and then, only a short time later, if I would like to be eaten by a giant plant. The first I readily accept because Groff and the rest of the cast of Little Shop of Horrors have thoroughly analyzed the desserts they picked up for a bus ride down from New York to the suburban Philadelphia puppet studio where they\u2019re rehearsing for the day, and they\u2019ve all concluded it\u2019s the best option. The idea of being eaten by a plant seems a little less palatable, considering the contortions involved in entering the hippopotamus-esque maw of the man-eating Audrey II, which is operated by several puppeteers, and because I\u2019m not sure if Groff is making a serious offer. I learn quickly that he is always offering you things, and those offers are always serious.\n\nThe puppet in question represents the largest form of Audrey II, a sassy carnivorous horticultural oddity that convinces Seymour, an awkward flower-shop assistant, to commit murder in the pursuit of fame, fortune, and a suburban life with the original Audrey, a human who works with him. The day I visit, Groff, playing the misfit Seymour (despite good looks that actor Christian Borle, who plays the maniacal dentist, Orin, describes as \u201cscrumptious\u201d), and his castmates are climbing inside Audrey II one by one, figuring out how each of them will die. Wearing a hat from Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z\u2019s \u201cOn the Run II\u201d tour, Groff jumps inside wielding a floppy machete, which is so un-aerodynamic it keeps getting stuck in Audrey II\u2019s lips. Groff suggests a real machete prop would be sturdier, and they try substituting an umbrella, which flies out more cleanly. Michael Mayer, the director, says with satisfaction, \u201cIt\u2019s a belch!\u201d\n\nStaging this revival of Little Shop is \u201cillegal fun,\u201d as Groff puts it. The original ran from 1982 to 1987 but never transferred to Broadway, at the insistence of writer-lyricist Howard Ashman, who wanted to preserve the show\u2019s off-kilter spirit in a smaller space. Ashman and composer Alan Menken would go on to fill the Disney Renaissance \u2014 which consisted of films like The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast \u2014 with the Marie\u2019s Crisis\u2013ready melodies and queer subversions you can already hear in Little Shop (Ashman died of aids-related complications in 1991). Despite a Broadway staging that kicked off in 2003, this version is staying put at the Westside Theatre Off Broadway in hopes of preserving the quirky spirit of the original. There\u2019s a lot of laughter in rehearsal as well as dress codes like a \u201ckimono Wednesday,\u201d which Mayer enforces by handing me a spare kimono when I drop in that day.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine anyone who is consistently involved in or adjacent to homicide having a better time. In addition to playing a murderously nice guy in Little Shop, Groff stars in Netflix\u2019s David Fincher\u2013produced drama Mindhunter, playing an FBI agent who interviews serial killers; the show is based on the real work of John Douglas, who was one of the first criminal profilers. Considering he\u2019s no big fan of true crime, Groff is somewhat confused about how he became a poster boy for gore and mutilation, though he\u2019s enjoying the texts from friends who point out that even when he does musical comedy, there\u2019s a dark edge involved. A few days after we meet in Philadelphia, we\u2019re talking over breakfast at the cozy Grey Dog in Chelsea, where he insists on paying for everything, picking up all the water and utensils, and getting up from the table to refill my coffee cup when it\u2019s empty.\n\nGroff in Mindhunter.

He\u2019d never played Seymour before, unlike the majority of white male theater actors, but he had positive memories of seeing the first performance of the 2003 Broadway version just after high school, when he was rehearsing the role of Rolf in a non-Equity tour of The Sound of Music. \u201cI wanted to make sure that I\u2019m bleeding for it eight times a week,\u201d he says, which is his measure for doing musicals; he wants to make sure he won\u2019t get bored with the material. Even now, when I assume he might want a break from it during rehearsals, Groff still has the album on repeat. \u201cI never went to college, and I\u2019m not educated, really, so I couldn\u2019t say, like, intellectually why that is,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I listened to it, it shot through my heart.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a clue, however, in the way he remembers obsessing over the film version of the show as a seventh-grader, standing in his kitchen with the song \u201cSkid Row\u201d on repeat \u2014 specifically when Seymour sings, \u201cSomeone show me a way to get outta here.\u201d It was an appealing message to a closeted kid whom Groff describes as just \u201ca sweaty, uncomfortable person with a secret that was so deep-rooted I wasn\u2019t even flirting with the idea of being myself.\u201d With a little distance from that version of himself (the child of a phys-ed teacher and a horse trainer, growing up in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and occasionally having to clean stables on the weekends), Groff recalls the kinds of tells that seem obvious in retrospect, like, say, listening to \u201cSkid Row\u201d on repeat. Or developing an obsession with I Love Lucy, which he still watches before going to bed. Or dancing along to the Donna Reed\u2019s Dinner Party album when his parents weren\u2019t home. There\u2019s a similar longing in Little Shop, which has the queerest kind of perspective on its central couple, as Audrey and Seymour imagine an unreachable, heteronormative life away from skid row and where she looks \u201clike Donna Reed.\u201d\n\nI was so compartmentalized, singing about sex but then not talking about it.\n\nIf there\u2019s a murderous kinship between Little Shop and Mindhunter, it extends to the shows\u2019 shared skepticism about that white-picket-fence-style normalcy. Holden, Groff\u2019s profiler character, is a cardboard cutout of a man with a girlfriend who introduces him to 1970s-style sexual liberation, but he is ultimately more fascinated with the deviancy of the killers he\u2019s interviewing. To play him, Groff shuts down his charisma, amassing such emptiness between his angular jaw and his eyebrows that you wonder if he\u2019ll slip into deviancy himself. It\u2019s a performance of square, even sinister straightness that feels close to the best-little-boy performances of closeted queer men, though what seems to thrill Holden most in the show are his interviews with killers. \u201cSexuality is so complicated, and the people I\u2019ve ended up working with who have cast me in straight parts are interested in looking at things in a complicated way,\u201d Groff says, noting that he feels the argument about whether gay actors can play straight, or vice versa, has gotten \u201csillier\u201d as time goes on. \u201cBeing out and gay and being myself, it allowed me to find people that weren\u2019t closed-minded.\u201d\n\nGroff came out when he was 23, without directly consulting his agent, after he\u2019d become an idol to the nation\u2019s theater teens of Facebook by starring as the sexy, rebellious, tousle-haired Melchior in Spring Awakening. \u201cI was so compartmentalized,\u201d he says, \u201csinging about sex but then not talking about it.\u201d He remains thankful for the way Mayer, who also directed that show, choreographed the explicit sex between himself and Lea Michele\u2019s Wendla clinically, without asking them about their own experiences. He hadn\u2019t spent too much time worrying about the aftereffects of coming out on his career, which were more limiting in 2009 than they are now. \u201cI did think I might not be seen as a romantic lead, but ultimately I was okay with that,\u201d he says, explaining that he was in love at the time and didn\u2019t want to hide it. \u201cAt 23, I\u2019d rather just have a real romantic relationship than pretend to have one with a girl.\u201d\n\nSeveral years after coming out, Groff booked a leading role in HBO\u2019s Looking, a comedy-drama about gay men in San Francisco, which he calls one of the most fulfilling roles he\u2019s had. The series ran for two seasons and got a wrap-up movie but never quite found a viewership, even among queer audiences, instead receiving, as he puts it, \u201ca total mixed bag of very extreme reactions.\u201d Some of that was because people just didn\u2019t like the show \u2014 which was often slower, more interior, and whiter and fitter than people may have wanted \u2014 and some of it was because it was \u201ccarrying a lot of weight; there wasn\u2019t a lot of specifically gay content on a major cable network.\u201d To Groff, making the show opened him up to the possibility of using material from his own experience in his work. Among the cast and crew, \u201cwe would talk about stories about PrEP and uncut dicks and monogamy,\u201d he recalls, among \u201cso many stories about anal douching,\u201d and those anecdotes would make their way into the scripts. He was used to a sort of \u201ccloseted training of the mind\u201d to abstract himself from his own experience. Looking taught him he could use it.\n\nRecently, Groff has developed an ability to end up near the center of cultural sensations. He stepped in for Brian d\u2019Arcy James as Hamilton\u2019s fey Britpop version of King George III midway through the show\u2019s Off Broadway run. It was a somewhat ideal gig, given that he was onstage for only about nine minutes a night, performed crowd-pleasing kiss-off songs, met Beyonc\u00e9, earned a Tony nomination, and got a lot of reading done backstage. This fall, he\u2019s in Disney\u2019s sequel to Frozen, where he returns to play Princess Anna\u2019s rugged (at a Disney-appropriate level) love interest, Kristoff. In the first movie, while Idina Menzel\u2019s Elsa got the vocal-cord shattering \u201cLet It Go,\u201d Groff sang only a few lines of melody between Kristoff and his reindeer, Sven. This time around, he\u2019s putting his Broadway training to use with a full-length solo. It\u2019s the second one he recorded for the movie, since the writers had one idea for a Kristoff piece (\u201ca jam\u201d) but then canned that song while promising Groff they\u2019d write something different, which he didn\u2019t quite believe. \u201cThen they fucking wrote that other song,\u201d he says, characteristically effusive. \u201cI was like, Wow, and the animation of the song is so brilliant.\u201d\n\nAs personable as Groff is and as successful as he has become \u2014 and as beloved, especially among theater fans and people like my mother \u2014 there\u2019s a point at which he maintains a certain distance, in what feels like a way to stem his own impulses. He doesn\u2019t use any social media, though he did consider it when Looking was struggling, before he realized \u201cI\u2019d have to be good at it and want to do it, and I don\u2019t.\u201d He has never thrown himself a birthday party, because the impulse to make sure everyone\u2019s having a good time would stress him out too much. In behavior that reminds me of both a secret agent and Kim Kardashian, he regularly goes through and deletes all his texts after responding to each of them. \u201cI want to make sure I get back to everyone,\u201d he says, holding his iPhone up in front of me to reveal the remarkably few surviving messages.\n\nBefore Groff gets up to leave breakfast and travel to rehearsal by way of the single-speed bicycle he rides around Manhattan, we end up talking about the larger trajectory of his career. Considering that he\u2019s scaling down for a revival run of a musical Off Broadway, was he ever the kind of actor who thought of his work as building up to something? A big film? A franchise? \u201cI think I gave that up when I came out of the closet,\u201d he says. \u201cI gave up the idea that there was an end goal or ideal or some kind of dream to work toward.\u201d An image appears in my mind of the life Audrey sings about in Little Shop, a place that\u2019s comfortable, traditional, and expected, somewhere that\u2019s green. \u201cWhen I moved to New York, what I wanted was to be on Broadway. That happened and then I came out, and it\u2019s sort of been anybody\u2019s guess since then,\u201d Groff says. \u201cI like when something makes me cry or I can\u2019t stop listening to it. Okay, I want to do that.\u201d\n\nLittle Shop of Horrors is in previews and opens October 17 at Westside Theatre Upstairs.
