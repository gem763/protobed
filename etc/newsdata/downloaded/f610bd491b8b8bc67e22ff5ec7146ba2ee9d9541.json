The Washington Times reported that Mr. Durham, the U.S. attorney for Connecticut, obtained two Mifsud BlackBerry cellphones. Stephan Roh, Mr. Mifsud\u2019s attorney, told The Times he provided the deposition recording to Mr. Durham\u2019s team in midsummer.\n\nMr. Mifsud\u2019s April 2016 conversation with a Trump associate ignited the FBI\u2019s long Trump-Russia probe. In May 2018, Mr. Mifsud sat in Mr. Roh\u2019s law office in Zurich recounting his time as an academic traveling in Europe, from London to Rome to Paris to Moscow.\n\nMr. Roh contends that Mr. Mifsud, who has been in hiding for months, was not just a peripatetic professor but also a Western \u201cintelligence operative\u201d who fed what he knew to retired officials.\n\nThe Times could not confirm this. No independent evidence at this point shows Mr. Mifsud played that role. The Times reached out to one person named by Mr. Roh as a Mifsud intelligence contact, but that person didn\u2019t respond.\n\nFormer FBI Director James B. Comey, with access to counterintelligence files, said flatly that Mr. Mifsud was a Russian \u201cagent.\u201d\n\nMr. Roh said the FBI detained and questioned him upon his arrival in the U.S. for vacation. He was never accused of wrongdoing. No Trump associate has been charged in any Russian election conspiracy.\n\nThe FBI questioned Mr. Mifsud in February 2017 while he was attending a State Department-linked conference on Capitol Hill. The event was one of a string of Mifsud sightings in close contact with Western officials in the U.S. and Europe over a number of years.\n\nRep. Devin Nunes of California, the top Republican on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said categorically that Mr. Mifsud was not a Moscow agent. He takes this view because the only evidence offered by the U.S. is the professor\u2019s relatively few contacts with Russians, and no Western governments seem concerned about Mr. Mifsud\u2019s numerous associations with intelligence figures and diplomats in their countries.\n\nIn an email exchange with The Times, Mr. Roh talked of his client\u2019s \u201cmissions and engagements.\u201d\n\nAsked whether this is in the recording and an accompanying transcript, Mr. Roh said, \u201cIn relation to the LCILP, yes. Outside recordings, he explained us more.\u201d\n\nLCILP is the now-defunct London Center of International Law Practice. It was the link that brought Mr. Mifsud together with George Papadopoulos, a Trump campaign adviser and energy consultant.\n\nMr. Roh later wrote, \u201cThe LCILP was not \u2018real.\u2019 It was rather a cover-up for intelligence agents.\u201d\n\nMr. Mifsud was a director of the London center when Papadopoulos arrived. In March 2016, he traveled to Link Campus University in Rome. Link University is a for-profit school founded by former Italian government officials. It trains NATO intelligence personnel and has hosted FBI agents.\n\nLondon center personnel urged Papadopoulos to visit Link, where he met Mr. Mifsud at a gathering. Mr. Mifsud promised to help him make Russian contacts who could facilitate Papadopoulos\u2019 ambition to set up a Kremlin-campaign meeting.\n\nMr. Mifsud returned to London in April 2016 after participating in a Moscow think tank panel that included Mr. Roh. Over breakfast, Mr. Mifsud told Papadopoulos he had heard that Moscow owned \u201cdirt\u201d on Hillary Clinton in the form of thousands of emails.\n\nRussian military intelligence had indeed been hacking Democratic Party computers. FBI agent Peter Strzok heard about the conversation via an Australian diplomat and officially opened a counterintelligence probe on July 31, 2016.\n\n\u2018The Faking of Russia-Gate\u2019\n\nPapadopoulos believes Mr. Mifsud was a Western plant dispatched to try to incriminate him. He said Mr. Mifsud promised to hook him up with Russian officials but never did, creating suspicion that he really didn\u2019t know any.\n\nPapadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his association with Mr. Mifsud.\n\nPapadopoulos\u2019 suspicions proved correct about another London encounter. Looking back, he began to piece together a timeline that told him that Stefan Halper was more than a Washington establishment scholar who gave him $3,000 for an energy study. He also was an FBI plant sent to spy on him. So was Azar Turk, a flirtatious Halper associate who tried to coax him into talking about Russia and emails.\n\nIn May 2018, Mr. Mifsud spoke into a recorder in Zurich at the same time he signed over power of attorney to Mr. Roh. Mr. Roh said his client was living in Italy at the time.\n\nMr. Roh said he has had no direct or indirect communication with his client since special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report was released in March. The report branded Mr. Mifsud as an associate of sinister Russians.\n\n\u201cThe recording outlines in general terms his work which he called \u2018track to diplomacy,\u2019\u201d Mr. Roh said. \u201cMifsud, non-recorded, but in front of our team, talked about some matters, missions and engagements.\u201d\n\nAsked whether the audio recording was given to Mr. Durham, Mr. Roh said, \u201cWe provided the audio tape of Mifsud\u2019s declaration, and our own working transcript.\u201d\n\nMr. Roh, an energy company executive and investor, maintains Russian business ties and is married to a Russian fashion designer.\n\nHe wrote a 2018 book about his and Mr. Mifsud\u2019s saga, \u201cThe Faking of Russia-Gate: The Papadopoulos Case.\u201d In the fall of 2017, arriving at New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy International Airport on a vacation with his wife and three children, the FBI and an \u201carmed police force\u201d awaited.\n\n\u201cThere followed hours of interrogation and search by the FBI, a team of Special Counsel Robert Mueller investigating Russia-Gate,\u201d Mr. Roh wrote. \u201cReleased, he and his family, during all their holiday stay in New York, were observed, followed and taped, at every moment and every place in New York, permitting a huge number of following FBI officers to enjoy the same tourist attractions as well. The family was assigned to special rooms at the hotel, and security personnel patrolled in the corridors.\u201d\n\nA question remains: Why did all this happen?\n\nMr. Roh profiled Mr. Mifsud: \u201cThe Professor, who was wrongly and offensively styled as a shady and dark personality, suspected to be even a Russian spy, is an elder statesman, former foreign policy officer, European activist, a diplomat, but also a long serving academic, who was teaching at many European universities, being a political analyst and commentator, invitee at European, US and global think tanks, with international contacts on highest level. The Professor, most importantly, is an employee and a missionary of Clintonian and U.S. Democrats\u2019 institutions and a close co-operator and an \u2018asset\u2019 of Western intelligence services.\u201d\n\nMr. Roh told The Times that his story prompted Mr. Mifsud, whom he has known for years after meeting at a security conference, to officially retain him.\n\n\u201cMifsud was deeply thankful with us for writing the book,\u201d he said. \u201cMifsud confirmed the content and appointed thereafter our law firm as his lawyers. We also understand that this book, which was distributed April 2018 to 400+ journalists and news outlets, helped to save Mifsud\u2019s life.\u201d\n\nKey questions loom: If Mr. Mifsud was a Western intelligence plant sent to befriend Papadopoulos, why did the FBI interview him in Washington in 2017? Why did agents stop and question Mr. Roh? Why is Mr. Mifsud mentioned in the Mueller report 87 times?\n\nStefan Halper, a known FBI informant who encountered the same Trump adviser, is not mentioned once.\n\nMaybe the FBI didn\u2019t know Mr. Mifsud\u2019s true role in Europe. A source told The Washington Times that there is no doubt Mr. Mifsud worked at times with a U.S. intelligence agency.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
