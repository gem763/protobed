Wells Novel", "language": "en", "text": "Do not panic. Despite your first assumption this trailer must be for a documentary, it is, in fact, your first look at the BBC\u2019s upcoming three-part adaptation of the H.G. Wells sci-fi classic The War of the Worlds. Set in Edwardian England, Rafe Spall and Eleanor Tomlinson star as George and Amy, a recent divorc\u00e9 and the woman he left his marriage for despite society\u2019s disapproval. Luckily, the neighbors can only wag their tongues for so long before bigger fish arrive to get fried in the form of massive robotic aliens stomping across the British countryside. Rupert Graves and Robert Carlyle costar as George\u2019s brother Frederick and astronomer Ogilvy, respectively. Here\u2019s hoping King Edward VII has some sort of secret steampunk Iron Man suit in one of Buckingham Palace\u2019s many rooms, because he\u2019s going to need it. The War of the Worlds premieres on BBC One later this fall.", "description": "BBC releases the first trailer for their three-part adaptation of H.G.
