The organization provides early intervention and prevention services through an after school mentoring program for girls ages 8 to 17 at risk of teenage pregnancy, drug addiction, or failing in school. \u201cHelping people is what I\u2019ve done my entire life,\u201d she says. \u201cI guess I\u2019m not really retiring.\u201d\n\nPhoto courtesy of Carol Nash\n\n\u201cI burn with a passion for what I am doing,\u201d she told me when I interviewed her for my recent book, \u201cNever Too Old To Get Rich: The Entrepreneur\u2019s Guide to Starting a Business Mid-Life\u201d. \u201cIf I can make the difference in the life of one child, then I believe I have fulfilled a purpose here.\u201d\n\nInterest in starting a nonprofit between the ages of 50 and 70 has nearly doubled in recent years, according to research from Encore.org. There are those with a singular focus, like Nash, who are driven by personal life experience. She was raised from age 3 in the convent of the Franciscan Handmaids of Mary, an order of African-American nuns, after the death of her mother. Her guardian there was Sister Maria Bernadette.\n\n\u201cI attribute my early development of self-esteem and confidence to her,\u201d Nash says.\n\nSubsequently, as a registered nurse, Nash came into contact with \u201cyoung women caught in an endless cycle of teen pregnancy and illiteracy.\u201d So when she retired, she realized she had a calling to support and develop young girls. \u201cI didn\u2019t know where the money was coming from, but I stepped out in faith, found a building close to home, started advertising, and kids started coming,\u201d she says.\n\nNash invested about $25,000 of her own savings to set up the program. Donors helped provide furniture, fix a leaky roof, and paint the leased space. Volunteer mentors are professional women who make a one-year, one-hour-a-week minimum commitment to working with a child.\n\nEach day after school, more than a dozen girls come to the white house, built in 1892, and stay until 6:30 p.m. There are a range of activities including learning etiquette, reading, dance classes, and more. Each girl is given a mentor, who shares new adventures with her, sometimes going to a ballet, a movie, or the theater, says Nash.\n\nBernadette\u2019s House also runs a summer program where girls can learn to play sports like lacrosse and tennis. The organization operates mostly from donations and grants. \u201cI believe these kids can really thrive if someone pays attention to them,\u201d Nash says.\n\nHer advice for those who are thinking of starting their own social enterprise venture? \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid to follow your dream, and never give up. Take your time. You need to do your research, seek mentors, and make sure there\u2019s a genuine need for what it is you want to do. If you think you\u2019ve found a niche and are fulfilling a need to make this a better place, then just do it.\u201d\n\nHere are some steps you can take \u2014 preferably before you retire from your old job \u2014 toward creating your social entrepreneur venture with purpose in your next chapter.\n\nGet financially fit. Debt is a dream killer \u2014 one of my favorite mantras. If you\u2019re financially fit, it gives you options.\n\nTake time to reflect. \u201cCarve out solitude, space, and time to consider what kind of mission speaks to you,\u201d says Marci Alboher, the author of \u201cThe Encore Career Handbook\u201d. You need a certain amount of humility to switch to nonprofit work.\n\nReach out to your network to ask for help. Whom do you know in the nonprofit field? Tap your LinkedIn and other social media connections to search for possible contacts. Book an advice and counseling lunch or coffee to brainstorm. Always ask for another name or two of people you might be able to reach out to for guidance.\n\nDo something daily to inch toward your goal. Don\u2019t struggle to find an ideal starting point, or perfect path. Once you have some picture of where you want to go, get things moving by taking small steps toward that vision.", "description": "How to start a nonprofit after you retire \u2014 from someone who did it.", "authors": ["Kerry Hannon"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR954_holdin_ZG_20190924120759.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
