I ran out onto the balcony which faced north \u2013 and it was dead silent,\u201d Wolf, 65, told Fox News. \u201cI stepped back through the sliding glass door, and all I heard was 'Ka-boom.' Then someone on the street said, \u2018Oh my God, a plane has gone into the World Trade Center,\u2019 and I yelled back, 'Are you kidding me? My wife works there.'\u201d\n\nThe days that followed passed in an agonizing blur for the musician, pilot, and businessman. Every time the phone rang, his heart leaped into his throat, and he scrambled in anticipation. But Friday came, and there was still no word from his bride, Katherine.\n\n\u201cI decided I need to help myself, so I decided to go to the barber and for a manicure. I\u2019m a wreck,\u201d Wolf remembered. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t take me for a haircut, so I ran out the door without my umbrella. I could not speak my name.\u201d\n\nA STORY OF A FAITH TRANSFORMED IN THE MIDST OF THE 9/11 TERROR ATTACKS\n\nKatherine Wolf worked for financial strategy firm Marsh & McLennan, located on the 97th floor of Tower One, the North Tower. She had been on the job just two weeks. A few days earlier, her boss asked if she would mind starting at 8.30 am instead of nine \u2013 putting her right in the terrorists\u2019 flight path.\n\nThat Friday afternoon, Wolf impulsively ran from his barber and over to the firm\u2019s midtown office. He was quickly escorted to a meeting where other anguished co-workers, loved ones and friends of missing employees were passing a microphone around and asking desperate questions. He found the answer.\n\n\u201cFinally, someone asks what the highest floor anybody got out of was? And then the magic words,\u201d Wolf recounted, adding that an executive had informed them that regardless of media reports, he had checked with other companies and nobody above the 91st floor had been found alive. \u201cWhen I heard that, I said she is gone. She is gone.\u201d\n\nThere was an odd comfort Wolf felt in facing such a painful truth. Out-of-turn, he stood back up to face the sea of strange and sobbing faces before him.\n\n\u201cSo, I stood up\u2026 I don\u2019t know where this came from, but I wanted to say something positive. I said, 'As far as I am concerned, our people were vaporized.' Everyone gasped, like a Greek chorus,\u201d Wolf went on. \u201cAnd I said, 'Furthermore, we need to thank God that our people didn\u2019t need to make the decision to stay there and burn, or to jump.' And I sat down.\u201d\n\nGradually, others deep in shock and sadness approached Wolf with questions. In those moments, he said, he went from grieving to offering comfort. It also marked the beginning of a protracted journey \u2013 one that would last almost 18 years \u2013 to ensure suffering families were adequately taken care of by the federal government.\n\nIn the ensuing months, with the smoke of the twin towers fading into memory, Wolf learned that some 2,200 men and 600 women were in the buildings, prompting a critical question. The imbalance indicated hundreds of widows were out there, left to care for their families.\n\n\u201cWho is left over? The women. What are the women going to be doing? Taking care of the family, that is their priority. The kids,\u201d Wolf asserted. \u201cThey aren\u2019t going to be focusing on the financial aspect of things. I said, 'I am going to do this for the widows because they are going to wake up four or five years later and say, 'Why didn\u2019t we do something?'' I didn\u2019t know how I was going to do it, but I did it. I said the press is going to be my megaphone.\u201d\n\nThe September 11th Victim Compensation Fund, otherwise known as the VCF, had just been established to provide financial support \u201cfor any individual or a personal representative of a deceased individual who suffered physical harm or was killed as a result of the terrorist-related aircraft crashes of September 11, 2001 or the debris removal efforts that took place in the immediate aftermath of those crashes.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Wolf recounted, the process for seeking financial compensation was wrapped up in a web of red-tape and political posturing. Some in the media were conflating charity with victim compensation, he noted, and groups were even accusing women of being \u201cgreedy grieving widows.\u201d In June 2002, he took it upon himself to create www.fixthefund.org as an advocacy organization to \u201cfix the problems in the September 11th Victims Compensation Fund of 2001\u201d and assist others in wading through \u201cthe mess.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe first incarnation (of the fund) had a two-year limit for application but no monetary limit, Congress had to appropriate the money. The second time, they did put a time limit on it and a monetary limit,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cAs we all know, cancer has a gestation period, and then the cancer started coming like a roar.\u201d\n\nThe passage of time has brought thousands more victims, as first responders continue to be stricken by cancer and respiratory diseases. The attacks unleashed dangerous chemicals into the Manhattan air \u2013 asbestos, dioxins, and all kinds of carcinogenic materials.\n\nFirst responders today are also afflicted by other illnesses, including heart problems.\n\nAccording to a study conducted by the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and published in the Journal of the American Medical Association last week, a \u201csignificant association\u201d has been detected between New York City firefighters who dashed into the burning building and an increased risk of long-term cardiovascular disease.\n\nMedical researchers noted that those firefighters have a 44 percent higher chance of a cardiovascular ailment than even those who arrived at the scene the following day. Such risks range from a heart attack and coronary artery surgery to angina and angioplasty.\n\nAnalysts now expect that those who have died and will continue to die as a result of exposure to toxins in the attack aftermath may well outnumber the nearly 3,000 who were killed in the towers that morning.\n\nJON STEWART: 9/11 VICTIMS ARE 'AT THE END OF THEIR ROPE' SEEKING HELP FROM CONGRESS\n\nThe road for relentless advocates like Wolf was a rough one. After fighting for funds the first time, the second reiteration of the bill to help victims and families was re-authorized in late 2010 with $4.2 billion sidelined for survivors and the mandate that it required re-authorization in 2015. After a political melee, the legislation was extended for another five years.\n\nBut by early this year, the fund was falling. The money and limitation were slated to run out. Following an intense and emotional campaign \u2013 fronted by Jon Stewart this summer \u2013 lawmakers signed on to make sure that those in need won\u2019t be neglected.\n\nIn late July, President Trump signed the \u201cNever Forget the Heroes\u201d bill that permanently re-authorized the September 11 Victim Compensation Fund. The act extended the VCF\u2019s claim filing deadline from December 18, 2020, to October 1, 2090, and \u201cappropriates such funds as may be necessary to pay all approved claims.\u201d\n\nWolf\u2019s website now reads, \u201cThe Fund is Fixed!\u201d It was a monetary triumph but it was also a moral victory, and an endeavor Wolf knows would have made his late wife \u201cvery happy.\u201d\n\nMore than 51,000 victims have applied to the fund, and more than $5.5 billion has been extended to those suffering. Wolf encouraged others to come forward.\n\n\u201cA lot of people, the rescue workers, they are tough people. They pull themselves up by the straps, tough people. Real salt-of-the-earth,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cThey don\u2019t like to ask for help, which is very admirable. But this is something they did in the service of their country. Inquire, ask if you have any doubt whatsoever.\u201d\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFor Wolf, helping others keeps alive the memories of Katherine, whom he met in a church basement thirteen years earlier.\n\n\u201cWhen you move on, it doesn\u2019t mean you have forgotten. When you move on, it doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t love the person you lost. It\u2019s that time of the year when the emotions can get very raw again,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cOne thing that really helped was when the new One World Trade Center peeked its head up from behind the buildings.\u201d\n\nIt was a symbol of letting go but remembering at the same time.\n\n\u201cRepair and restoration,\u201d Wolf added. \u201cThat is a big part of what I have been about for the past 18 years.\u201d", "description": "The roar of an airplane flying low over his downtown Manhattan apartment on Tuesday, September 11, 2001, sent chills over Charles Wolf\u2019s body.", "authors": ["Hollie Mckay", "Hollie Mckay Has A Been A Fox News Digital Staff Reporter Since She Has Extensively Reported War Zones Including Iraq", "Syria", "Yemen", "Afghanistan", "Pakistan", "Burma", "Latin America Investigates Global Conflicts", "War Crimes", "Terrorism Around The World.
