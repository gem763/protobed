It\u2019s alleged they deliberately lured 9-year-old Tyshawn Lee into an alley and shot him in a gang-related execution.\n\nProsecutors say Tyshawn was playing on a basketball court in a South Side Chicago park when Dwright Boone-Doty, 25, tricked him into going into an alley, at which point he shot the child multiple times, killing him. This was allegedly at the behest of fellow defendant Corey Morgan, 30, prosecutors claim. A third man, Kevin Edwards, who has already been convicted and sentenced, acted as a getaway driver and lookout.\n\n\u201cA child in a casket to me is the face of evil, but this was a whole new level,\u201d Reverend Michael Pfleger, who gave the eulogy at Tyshawn\u2019s funeral, tells TIME.\n\nProsecutors claim the defendants believed that Tyshawn\u2019s father, Pierre Stokes, was a member of a rival gang, and that he was responsible for a previous shooting in which Morgan\u2019s brother Tracey was killed and his mother was wounded. Stokes has not been charged in relation to that shooting; Khalil Yameen and Christopher Smith \u2014 alleged members of the same gang that police have also claimed Stokes was involved with \u2014 were later arrested.\n\nBoth Yameen and Smith were charged with first-degree murder and attempted first-degree murder in October 2016. They are still awaiting trial, according to authorities.\n\nStokes has never confirmed any gang affiliation \u2014 in a 2015 interview with the Chicago Tribune, he \u201cdid not talk specifically about whether he was a gang member,\u201d and added that he did not feel the narrative that the police had painted about him was not accurate. He said that no one should have had a motive to kill his son.\n\nMorgan and Boone-Doty are being tried together, but they are appearing in front of separate juries. Their trial began on Sept. 17, and is expected to last until the first week of October. Here is everything you need to know about the crime, and the ensuing court proceedings.\n\nWhat happened to Tyshawn Lee?\n\nOn Nov. 2nd, Tyshawn was playing in Dawes Park, a public park on the south side of Chicago, after school with other kids. He was approached by Boone-Doty and Morgan, who began playing basketball with him to gain his trust, Assistant State Attorney Margaret Hillmann said at the trial.\n\nBoone-Doty then allegedly picked up Tyshawn\u2019s basketball, offered him a juice box and led him to a nearby alley, while Morgan and Edwards watched from a nearby parked car.\n\n\u201cAnd Dwright Doty took out a .40-caliber handgun, and he executed Tyshawn in broad daylight,\u201d Hillmann told jurors in her opening statement at the trial.\n\nIn this Tuesday, Nov. 10, 2015, file photo, a mourner holds the program for the funeral of 9-year-old Tyshawn Lee at St. Sabina Church in Chicago. Brian Jackson\u2014Chicago Sun-Times/AP\n\n\u201cTyshawn Lee was murdered in probably the most abhorrent, cowardly, unfathomable crime that I\u2019ve witnessed in 35 years of policing,\u201d then-Chicago Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy told reporters in 2015.\n\nWho was arrested for Tyshawn\u2019s murder?\n\nMorgan was arrested three weeks after the shooting on Nov. 25th and subsequently charged with Tyshawn\u2019s murder. Boone-Doty was arrested on the same charge in March 2016.\n\nThe third man, Edwards, pleaded guilty to a first-degree murder charge earlier this month and received a 25-year prison sentence. He is not expected to testify against Boone-Doty or Morgan, according to the Chicago Tribune.\n\nThe shooting of Morgan\u2019s mother broke a \u2018gang code\u2019 mandating that innocent family members be left out of gang disputes, prosecutors argued to the jury. (According to Hillmann, Boone-Doty and Morgan are allegedly members of the Black P. Stone Nation Bang Bang Gang (BBGs). Stokes is allegedly part of the Gangster Disciples Killa Ward gang.) With that \u2018code\u2019 broken, prosecutors claim Morgan arranged for Stokes\u2019 family to be targeted in revenge.\n\nDwright Boone-Doty appears during opening statements in his trial for the murder of 9-year-old Tyshawn Lee at the Leighton Criminal Court building in Chicago on Tuesday, Sept. 17, 2019.

Jason Wambsgans\u2014Chicago Tribune/AP\n\nCorey Morgan appears during opening statements in his trial for the murder of 9-year-old Tyshawn Lee at the Leighton Criminal Court building in Chicago on Tuesday, Sept. 17, 2019. E. Jason Wambsgans\u2014Chicago Tribune/AP\n\nPolice say that, in 2016, on the same day that Boone-Doty first appeared in court over Tyshawn\u2019s murder, Stokes was involved in a \u201cgang-related\u201d shooting. He is currently in jail awaiting trial for aggravated battery and other charges related to the attack, in which three men were wounded.\n\nStokes \u201csuffered an unspeakable loss with the calculated execution of his son,\u201d Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi at the time of his arrest, according to the AP. \u201cDespite this, he continued to engage in the same gang activity that started this initial cycle of violence.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s happened in the trial so far?\n\nDuring opening statements on Sept. 17, Hillmann explained the prosecution\u2019s case in emotive detail to the jury, telling them that Tyshawn was so excited to play basketball after school that he hadn\u2019t even changed out of his uniform.\n\n\u201cTyshawn brought a basketball to Dawes Park. Corey Morgan, Dwright Doty and Kevin Edwards brought guns,\u201d she said.\n\nHillmann says that Boone-Doty\u2019s DNA was found on the basketball found next to Tyshawn\u2019s body, and that the two men were seen with the victim before the shooting happened. Although prosecutors are not arguing Morgan shot Tyshawn, they are alleging he orchestrated the murder as a revenge attack \u2014 and is thus also culpable.\n\nTo this effect, several witnesses have testified to seeing Boone-Doty and Morgan in Dawes Park. One witness also told the court he saw one of the defendants with a gun, according to ABC7 Chicago.\n\nAssistant State's Attorney Margaret Hillmann makes opening statements in the trial of Corey Morgan for the murder of 9-year-old Tyshawn Lee at the Leighton Criminal Court building in Chicago on Tuesday, Sept. 17, 2019. E. Jason Wambsgans\u2014Chicago Tribune/AP\n\nThomas Breen, an attorney for Morgan, told the jury that Boone-Doty acted on his own. He argued in his opening statement that Morgan had nothing to do with the crime. \u201cThat execution of that 9-year-old boy has to come from one singularly evil person,\u201d Breen said to jurors. \u201cNot from a plan. His killer did so of his own volition and for his own reason. Not at the behest or help of Corey Morgan.\u201d\n\nBreen also told the jury to look for the lies that are contained in the case against Morgan.\n\nBrett Gallagher, Boone-Doty\u2019s attorney, told the jury to be \u201cskeptical\u201d about the state\u2019s case. She in turn claimed that Morgan is the defendant with a potential motive in the killing, not Boone-Doty.\n\nGallagher also addressed audio recordings of Boone-Doty discussing his involvement in the murders while in jail awaiting the trial \u2014 and argued that he only spoke about the murders to appear tougher to other inmates. \u201cHe pretended to be bigger and badder and more ruthless than he actually was in order to survive,\u201d Gallagher told the jury.\n\nNeither Gallagher nor Breen has addressed their clients\u2019 explanation of the circumstances surrounding Tyshawn\u2019s death during the trial. Neither attorney responded to TIME\u2019s request for comment on this matter, or with regards to their clients\u2019 potential affiliation with gangs.\n\nOn Sept. 18, Tyshawn\u2019s grandmother, Bertha Lee, took the stand. She told jurors that the last thing Tyshawn said to her was that he loved her, according to the AP.\n\nHow has the Chicago community responded?\n\nCommunity members and activists say that this murder hit residents harder than other instances of gang violence, which has long plagued the city.\n\nAs the crime\u2019s details began to emerge, \u201cpeople just got more and more angry,\u201d Reverend Pfleger says. But he notes that the emotional impact of such violence is, at least, two-fold. \u201cIt causes people to live in fear,\u201d he adds.\n\n\u201cWe want to get children out of the house\u2026 we want them to go out and get exercise, but you can\u2019t do that if you live in a place where you\u2019re afraid your child is going to get shot and killed,\u201d Pfleger says.\n\nTyshawn\u2019s killing came during a year in which 468 people were murdered in Chicago. 2016 saw a significant jump in murders still, with 769 people killed, according to the Chicago Police Department.\n\nCinaiya Stubbs, the Executive Director of Chicago Youth Programs, a youth organization that serves a variety of neighborhoods in the city, says the effects of gun violence are amplified by the fact that they are often concentrated on specific neighborhoods. She feels this leaves residents desensitized, and in some cases indifferent to the violence.\n\nStubbs also believes a much larger cultural desensitization is at play in how the greater general public responds to such horrifying crimes \u2014 and that national attention is often fleeting. \u201cIt takes something that the external community sees as vile for people to stand up and pay attention,\u201d Stubbs tells TIME of Tyshawn\u2019s murder. \u201c[But] something that we\u2019ve learned is that they may look for 30 seconds\u2026 and then people will go back to their regular business.\u201d\n\nAdam Alonzo, the CEO of Build Chicago, another organization that aims to help children in the city, agrees that the shooting was \u201cshocking\u201d and \u201ctragic.\u201d But he also says more attention needs to be on people in the impacted neighborhoods who are trying to make a difference.\n\n\u201cWe can focus on what is completely wrong in these situations or think about how we highlight the work of folks who are out there really trying to do this work to engage the community,\u201d Alonzo tells TIME. \u201cIf you let the reality of some of these things sink in and that then takes root and you let it grow, it takes over and you can\u2019t see anything positive. Those are things we do not want our kids to hold as their truth.\u201d\n\nA mourner embraces Pierre Stokes, the father of 9-year-old Tyshawn Lee, during a candlelight vigil held outside his home in memory of his son on November 5, 2015 in Chicago. Scott Olson\u2014Getty Images\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nIf convicted, Boone-Doty and Morgan face a minimum of 20 years in prison \u2014 and up to a maximum charge of 60 years. Tyshawn\u2019s grandmother told reporters she wants to see the men get the maximum sentence.\n\nBeyond their sentencing and the focus on punitive justice, activists say changes in impacted communities will require a larger, more sustained effort from neighborhood residents along with the local and federal government.\n\n\u201cThe systemic part of [combatting gun violence] would require a complete and utter strip-down of how things are done so inequitably,\u201d Stubbs says. \u201cInternally there are stigmas that exists that we have perpetuated that would have to also be stripped down. There is no quick and easy answer to these problems.\u201d\n\nWrite to Josiah Bates at josiah.bates@time.com.", "description": "Two men are on trial for the 2015 \"targeted execution\" of the 9-year-old.
