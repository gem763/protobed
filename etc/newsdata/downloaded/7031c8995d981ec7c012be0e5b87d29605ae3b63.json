A House vote in favor of impeachment would trigger a Senate trial to determine if the Republican president is guilty of any of the charges and thus should be removed from office.\n\n(Reporting by Richard Cowan; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)", "description": "Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives on Monday blocked  a Republican effort to censure House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff over statements he has made related to an impeachment investigation of President Donald Trump.
