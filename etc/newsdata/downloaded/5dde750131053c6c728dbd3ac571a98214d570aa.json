(Neil Hall/EPA-EFE)\n\nHe said there had been \"treaty after treaty and change after change in our relationship with the EU, with referendums often being promised but never being delivered.\"\n\n\"When we voted on it in 1975, it was eight countries and called the European Community. Now it's a very different organization.\"\n\nCameron has written a book about the vote and his political career, For The Record, released in Canada last week.\n\nWhile he called it an attempt \"to be as frank as I can about mistakes that were made along the way, but also mentioning some of the things that I'm proud we managed to achieve,\" he acknowledged that \"historians get to decide what your legacy is. You don't.\"\n\nBrexit must be delivered 'with a deal'\n\nBritain voted to leave the EU in June 2016 with 51.9 per cent of the vote. Divorce negotiations with the EU have been fraught, and MPs have yet to agree a departure deal \u2014 several times rejecting the one crafted by Cameron's successor, Theresa May.\n\nMay's own successor, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, is adamant that the country will leave on Oct. 31, even though leaving without a trade deal could mean customs checks, import delays and tariffs imposed . He suspended Parliament only to have the move quashed by the courts, and has threatened to hold a general election. Last week, he rejected calls from MPs to moderate his language and rhetoric.\n\nBoris Johnson dares raucous U.K. Parliament to topple him:\n\nU.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson dared his foes to try to topple him at a raucous session of Parliament, a day after Britain's highest court ruled he acted illegally in suspending the body ahead of the Brexit deadline. 2:33\n\nCameron has remained largely silent since he stepped down as an MP in 2016, believing that \"prime ministers that resign should let their successors get on with it.\"\n\nNow he says that while he doesn't \"agree with all the decisions\" Johnson has made in his two-month term, he thinks \"the crucial thing now is to look at the big picture and to support the prime minister as he goes to Brussels.\"\n\n\"The way to deliver the referendum is to do so with a deal,\" he told Lynch.\n\n\"It would be very bad for us to try and leave the EU without a deal, be bad for the economy, be bad for our United Kingdom \u2014 it wouldn't be a good idea for the European Union either,\" he said.\n\n\"If we can't then we're going to have to look at a general election, or possibly even a second referendum, as a way of unblocking a situation that has become badly blocked.\"\n\nIt's a legitimate option for us to be friends and neighbours and partners of the EU \u2014 we can make it work - David Cameron\n\nDespite the political deadlock, he is optimistic that the turmoil in Britain can be turned toward prosperity.\n\n\"While Brexit is not my choice, Britain is the sixth biggest economy in the world. It's a legitimate option for us to be friends and neighbours and partners of the EU \u2014 we can make it work,\" he said.\n\n\"Today we're just dealing in a world where there is great uncertainty in the U.K., and I fear that's going to continue, at least for the coming weeks.\"\n\nDavid Cameron announces his resignation the morning after the Brexit vote\n\nPrime Minister David Cameron resigns 0:23\n\nWhy Cameron thinks he lost\n\nLooking back on the campaign, Cameron said he believes his Remain side made \"brilliant technical arguments about why economically, and for jobs and prosperity, it's best to stay in\" the EU.\n\n\"But I think we didn't make enough arguments that connected with people emotionally,\" he said.\n\nBy contrast, said he believes the Leave campaign tapped into public concerns around British sovereignty being under threat, and the idea that EU freedom of movement was leading to uncontrolled immigration.\n\n\"Those two issues coming together, I think, was a powerful case that persuaded a lot of people to vote to leave.\"\n\nA Vote Leave battle bus carrying a false message parked outside U.K. Parliament during the 2016 campaign (Getty Images)\n\nDuring the referendum, Leave campaigners claimed that Brexit would mean a weekly payment of \u00a3350 million ($571 million Cdn) could be spent on Britain's health care system rather than EU membership fees. The claim was made online and printed on the side of a bus that shuttled campaigners around the country. But after the referendum it was acknowledged by prominet Leave campaigners as false .\n\nCameron said he doesn't think these claims made for an unfair campaign, but says other assertions have not survived being put to the test.\n\n\"They said it would be the easiest deal in history. They said that we would hold all the cards, the negotiation was very straightforward,\" Cameron said.\n\n\"A lot of those things have not turned out to be the case, as I argued they wouldn't be.\"\n\nWritten by Padraig Moran.
