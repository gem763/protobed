Other voices spoke in hushed murmurs.\n\nTrump had just demanded to know who provided a whistleblower with information about his call with the Ukrainian president, describing that person as \u201cclose to a spy\u201d and adding, \u201cYou know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? With spies and treason, right? We used to handle them a little differently than we do now.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s comments, which were included in leaked video obtained by The Washington Post and others, have sparked intense backlash, with top Democrats decrying his words as \u201cthreatening\u201d and defending the whistleblower at the center of a new push for impeachment.\n\n\u201cHe sounds like a criminal,\u201d Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), a presidential hopeful, told MSNBC on Thursday night. \u201c'Who snitched? Who gave up the goods? Let\u2019s find out who gave up the goods on us and make sure there\u2019s a consequence and it\u2019s serious, and let that be a lesson to everybody else.'\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cIt sounds like it\u2019s straight out of some bad drama, but the fact is this is the president of the United States.\u201d\n\n[\u2018Almost a spy:\u2019 Transcript of Trump\u2019s remarks at private U.N. event about whistleblower]\n\nHarris was joined by fellow Democratic candidates Sens. Cory Booker (N.J.) and Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke and former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, who suggested that Trump\u2019s comments could endanger the lives of the whistleblower and anyone else who aided in the complaint. Trump was also rebuked by some Republicans, including former Illinois congressman Joe Walsh and former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld, who are challenging the president for the GOP nomination, and Rep. Will Hurd (R-Tex.).\n\nIn a joint statement, the chairmen of the House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence, and Oversight and Reform Committees argued that Trump\u2019s remarks amounted to \u201creprehensible witness intimidation and an attempt to obstruct Congress\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe condemn the President\u2019s attacks, and we invite our Republican counterparts to do the same because Congress must do all it can to protect this whistleblower, and all whistleblowers,\u201d said the statement from Reps. Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.), Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) and Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.). \u201cThreats of violence from the leader of our country have a chilling effect on the entire whistleblower process, with grave consequences for our democracy and national security.\u201d\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment early Friday.\n\nTrump\u2019s statements came after the House released a nine-page version of the whistleblower\u2019s complaint. According to the complaint and a rough transcript of a July 25 phone call, Trump repeatedly urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate his political opponent, former vice president Joe Biden, offering assistance from the Justice Department and raising the possibility of a White House sit-down. The call took place after Trump had halted almost $400 million in military aid to Ukraine.\n\n[Read the whistleblower complaint regarding President Trump's communications with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky]\n\nAs Democrats speed up their impeachment investigation, Trump and other Republican leaders have continued to attack the credibility of the whistleblower and the complaint, highlighting that many of the allegations rely on secondhand information from other U.S. officials.\n\nThursday\u2019s private event, which was closed to the press, was intended to honor the staff and families of the U.S. delegation, but Trump took it as an opportunity to grouse about his enemies. During his speech, the president again went after Biden, the \u201ccrooked\u201d media and the whistleblower\u2019s complaint.\n\n\u201cBasically that person never saw the report, never saw the call,\u201d Trump said of the whistleblower on Thursday. \u201cHeard something, and decided that he or she or whoever the hell it is \u2014 sort of like, almost, a spy.\u201d\n\n[Whistleblower painstakingly gathered material and almost single-handedly set impeachment in motion]\n\nThen, the president appeared to suggest that the whistleblower and whoever may have supplied the person with information about the Ukraine call had behaved like spies. Trump also mentioned treason, which in the past has been punished by death.\n\nIn an interview with MSNBC on Thursday, Booker said Trump sounded \u201cmore like a threatening thug than giving forth the ideals of a statesman\u201d and accused the president of using rhetoric that \u201cgives license to people to do dangerous things.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that Donald Trump doesn\u2019t know the difference between patriotism and treason,\u201d the New Jersey senator said. \u201cIf there\u2019s any treasonous actions here it is coming from the White House.\u201d\n\nCastro, who also appeared MSNBC, called the president a \u201cdictator.\u201d In Castro\u2019s view, Trump had suggested that the whistleblower \u201cshould basically be killed.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, other presidential candidates took aim at Trump on Twitter, echoing criticisms that his comment constituted a threat.\n\n\u201cThis is wrong and this is un-American,\u201d Walsh tweeted about Trump\u2019s attacks on the whistleblower. \u201cAnd Congressional Republicans say nothing. Shameful. History is watching.\u201d\n\nThe President of the United States is threatening to harm a public servant for exposing his abuse of power.\n\n\n\nIf you don\u2019t see why he should be impeached, you\u2019re not looking. https://t.co/52pkxH1vpX \u2014 Beto O'Rourke (@BetoORourke) September 26, 2019\n\nTRANSLATION: The President is insinuating that those who assisted the whistleblower would be executed \"in the old days.\"\n\n\n\nNice.\n\n\n\nHe knows no limits. https://t.co/vyrQR6YFR6 \u2014 Amy Klobuchar (@amyklobuchar) September 26, 2019\n\nSeveral politicians also defended the whistleblower, with some referencing federal laws protecting those who expose wrongdoing. There are specific guidelines for whistleblowers in the intelligence community, who are protected from retaliation so long as they follow proper protocol when submitting complaints.\n\n\u201cThis person is not a spy,\u201d Hurd said at an event in Austin on Thursday night, according to the Dallas Morning News. \u201cLet me say that very clearly. This is clearly somebody who knew the consequences of what he or she was doing \u2026 and they shared it through the right mechanism.\u201d\n\nHarris expressed concerns that Trump was failing to uphold the law and respect the system created for whistleblowers.\n\n\u201cIt should be the president of the United States, above all, who says that we welcome and will always protect people who are fighting for the integrity of our democracy,\u201d she said on MSNBC.\n\nIn a video shared on Twitter, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) thanked the whistleblower for \u201can extraordinary act of courage.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump has used the word treasonous to describe this whistleblower,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWell, let me tell you what I think treasonous activity is. It is a president who is trying to undermine the Constitution of the United States and a president who thinks he is above the law.\u201d\n\nTrump described the whistleblower as \u201ctreasonous.\u201d I think treasonous activity is a president trying to undermine the Constitution of the United States. pic.twitter.com/YtDq4sk6s5 \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 26, 2019\n\nTrump did not address the backlash Thursday night over his leaked remarks. Instead, the president appeared to be watching Fox News\u2019s coverage of the Ukraine scandal, going on Twitter to share several clips from host Sean Hannity\u2019s Thursday show.", "description": "Trump said Thursday that the whistleblower is \"almost a spy,\" later adding, \u201cYou know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart?
