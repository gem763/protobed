Along the way, as he has before, he weaves in stories of the astonishing characters who have been figuring humans out.\n\nConsider John H. Gibbon\u2019s quest, in the early 1930s, to oxygenate blood to make open-heart surgery possible: \u201cTo test the capacity of blood vessels deep within the body to dilate or constrict, Gibbon stuck a thermometer up his rectum, swallowed a stomach tube, and then had icy water poured down it to determine its effect on his internal body temperature.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re committed to your job? Really?\n\nAD\n\nBryson also chronicles myriad examples of medicine gone wrong. Founding Father and esteemed surgeon Benjamin Rush, during a yellow-fever epidemic, \u201cbled hundreds of victims and was convinced that he had saved a great many when in fact all he did was fail to kill them all.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cPart of the problem,\u201d Bryson explains, \u201cwas that he believed that the human body contains about twice as much blood as it actually does and that one can remove up to 80 percent of that notional amount without ill effect.\u201d\n\nWhy didn\u2019t Bryson subtitle \u201cThe Body: A Guide for Occupants\u201d as \u201cAn Owner\u2019s Manual\u201d instead? Wouldn\u2019t that have been terribly clever?\n\nNo, because, as Bryson makes clear, we don\u2019t own our bodies. Evolution owns our bodies. We occupy them \u2014 although the more you read, the less clear it is how to define these roving, rickety, skin-slathered bone towers of electric impulses, chemical cocktails and micro-organismic colonies as \u201cwe.\u201d And, as you know, we take pitiful care of these fleshly loaners, filling them with crud, parking them in chairs and laying them out on sofas to the point of reversing the mortality gains modern science has enabled. Then again, there are exceptions, such as Jeanne Louise Calment, who ate two pounds of chocolate a week, smoked until she was 117 and died at 122. (Bryson doesn\u2019t mention it, but she also enjoyed red meat, cheap wine and hunting.)\n\nShorter than \u201cNearly Everything\u201d and with more snack-size chapter lengths, \u201cThe Body\u201d nonetheless draws on dozens of experts and a couple hundred books to carry the reader from outside to inside, from up to down and from miraculous operational efficiencies to malignant mayhem when things go awry. In some cases, that biological ingenuity and chaos are two sides of the same coin.\n\nCancer, for instance, as one expert puts it, \u201cis the price we pay for evolution. If our cells couldn\u2019t mutate, we would never get cancer, but we also couldn\u2019t evolve.\u201d There are more than 200 cancers, and age is usually a major factor, with an 80-year-old 1,000 times as likely as a teenager to get it.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDespite the body\u2019s harrowing malfunctions, you will marvel at the brilliance and vast weirdness of your design. The brain, holding its \u201c200 exabytes of information, roughly equal to \u2018the entire digital content of today\u2019s world.\u2019 \u201d The heart, beating some 3.5 billion times in a lifetime. The bones, \u201cstronger than reinforced concrete, yet light enough to allow us to sprint.\u201d The lungs, processing 4,000 gallons of air a day.\n\n\u201cYou are pretty seriously perforated,\u201d Bryson writes, with \u201ctwo to five million hair follicles and perhaps twice that number of sweat glands.\u201d And you are \u201cexquisitely fine-tuned,\u201d with nerve receptors able to detect movement of 0.00001 millimeters.\n\nYou grow 25 feet of hair in a lifetime. You host 40,000 species of microbes, and when you kiss you transfer some 1 billion bacteria to your beloved. While that statistic might not enhance the mood, the special sharing is thought to be helpful in sampling the partner\u2019s histocompatibility genes involved in immune response. Oh, baby!\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn a lifetime, you eat 60 tons of food, extracting the nutritional necessities and then producing seven tons of poop. That\u2019s almost the weight of three Hummer H3s. (Not that I have some weird thing about Hummers.) We produce enough flatulence that before laparoscopic insertion of carbon dioxide became the norm, patients undergoing anal surgery sometimes literally exploded.\n\nBryson dispels some long-held biological myths. That \u201ctaste map\u201d on your tongue you learned about in middle school \u2014 sweet on the tip, sour on the sides, bitter on the back? Not true. What is true is that we have taste receptors not just in the mouth, throat and gut, but in the heart, lungs and testicles too, perhaps so that they can send signals to the pancreas to adjust insulin output.\n\nAnd no, men don\u2019t think about sex every seven seconds. They think about it 19 times a day, about the same rate they think about food.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile we\u2019re timing things, let\u2019s note that our sex acts take about nine minutes (\u201cin Britain at least\u201d). Men burn 100 calories during those encounters, women 70.\n\nOlder people have an increased risk of heart attack for three hours after coitus, but Bryson, ever the practical life coach at age 67, wisely points out that the risk \u201cwas similarly raised for shoveling snow, and sex is more fun than shoveling snow.\u201d\n\nAlexander C.
