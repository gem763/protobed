'It's so beautiful.\n\n'Most strikers don't imagine it, eight out of 10 don't even think about it, two who actually think about it, one of the two can't even do it. The way he executed that goal is so beautiful.\n\n'I'm so happy for him, I used to play with him at Arsenal, I saw that ability. He has potential to be a top player, if he can do those type of goals he can become that type of player. That goal is like one you will score once in your life.'\n\nAbsolute class from The Ox!! \ud83d\ude31\n\n\n\nFirst time \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOutside of the boot \u2714\ufe0f\n\nIn off the crossbar \u2714\ufe0f\n\n\n\nHe's got his second of the night and it is truly sublime! pic.twitter.com/nqV2xBGnno \u2014 Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) October 23, 2019\n\nSadio Mane made it 3-0 with a well-taken finish as Liverpool romped to victory in Belgium\n\nMo Salah scored Liverpool's fourth to add gloss to the scoreline before Genk's consolation\n\nRio Ferdinand, who was alongside Van Persie in the studio, also weighed in and said the England international gives Liverpool's midfield much-needed variety.\n\n'You can tell he's a good team-mate, and Klopp likes him too. He offers something totally different to the likes of Milner, Wijnaldum, Fabinho, Henderson.\n\n'He's obviously a popular lad, to come back in and get a couple of goals will lift him.'\n\nSadio Mane and Mo Salah also found the back of the net late on to add gloss to the scoreline, before Genk scored a late consolation.\n\nJurgen Klopp was delighted with Oxlade-Chamberlain but says he can 'do so much better'\n\nDespite winning Van Persie's praise, Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp believes Oxlade-Chamberlain can improve on his overall performance.\n\n'The goals were brilliant but he can do so much better,' he said. I'm not too critical, a long time out, lack of rhythm. The goals were incredible, I'm really pleased for him, a big step.'\n\nMeanwhile, the 26-year-old revealed his delight at returning to Champions League action after missing most of last season with a serious knee injury.\n\n'I've definitely missed it [the Champions League]. It's nice to be back out there, a special tournament to play in. Seeing the boys do so well in it last year, I was lucky enough to be back on the bench for the final.\n\n'It's nice to be back in the starting line-up and put in a performance to help the team. [But] we've got to do a lot better if we want to go far in this competition.'\n\nThe result leaves Liverpool second in Champions League Group E on six points, a point adrift of leaders Napoli who beat RB Salzburg 3-2.", "description": "Robin van Persie lavished praise on Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain after he scored a stunning 20-yard goal with the outside of his right foot in Liverpool's 4-1 Champions League win over Genk.", "authors": ["Alec Fenn For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/22/20104310-0-image-a-7_1571866604112.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
