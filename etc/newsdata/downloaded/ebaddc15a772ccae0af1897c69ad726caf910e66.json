The article included a quote from Richard Manning, president of Americans for Limited Government, accusing Ocasio-Cortez of profligate spending.\n\n\u201cAOC is the Eva Per\u00f3n of American politics,\u201d Manning told the paper, referencing the late Argentine first lady. \u201cShe preaches socialism while living the life of the privileged.\u201d\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez's hair appointment riled up critics. (Photo: REUTERS/Erin Scott) More\n\nOcasio-Cortez\u2019s critics also pounced on the Times report and accused the Democrat of being a hypocrite for splashing out on her hair while taking a stand against income inequality. The Times also contrasted her cut and color to Jeff Sessions\u2019s reportedly thrifty trim, and suggested she should have saved money by visiting the House barber.\n\n\u201cShe could get a cheap haircut and give the rest away to those in need,\u201d read one complaint on Twitter.\n\nNow the congresswoman, who turns 30 next week, is pushing back against the uproar. On Thursday, she interrupted her visit to Copenhagen for the C40 World Mayors Summit to call out the \u201cright-wing\u201d for fixating on her hair rather than tackling poverty.\n\nShe credited Democratic socialist policies for advancing \u201cprosperity for working people,\u201d sassily adding that critics are \u2018just mad we look good doing it.\u201d\n\n40 million Americans live in poverty under today\u2019s extreme inequality, yet the right-wing want you to blame Democratic socialism for their own moral failures.\n\n\n\nOur policies, like Medicare for All, advance prosperity for working people.\n\n\n\nThey\u2019re just mad we look good doing it \ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f https://t.co/l9gKGtyKra \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) October 10, 2019\n\n\u201cI wonder if Republicans care about corruption as much as they care about a woman\u2019s cut and color,\u201d she added in a follow-up tweet which referenced Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s own expenses.\n\nWon\u2019t you look at that: Mike Pence used *taxpayer funds* - not personal ones - to spend several thousand haircuts\u2019 worth of public money on a visit to Trump golf courses.\n\n\n\nI wonder if Republicans care about corruption as much as they care about a woman\u2019s cut & color. https://t.co/xBze4obZhv \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) October 10, 2019\n\nOcasio-Cortez isn\u2019t the only one who found the backlash to be sexist. Many women came to her defense, arguing that the nearly $300 price tag wasn\u2019t out of the ordinary and that she was being unfairly targeted because of her gender and politics.\n\n$80 for a NYC haircut!? Good for you @AOC PUT THIS WOMAN IN CHARGE OF ALL OUR MONEY <3 \u2014 Aminatou Sow (@aminatou) October 10, 2019\n\nLook I wasn\u2019t going to get involved in this @AOC hair scandal. I really wasn\u2019t. Bc I\u2019m a defense reporter and, why? But I cannot NOT remark that the story seems distressed that AOC, a \u201csocialist,\u201d got a $300 haircut instead of...a government-subsidized one?https://t.co/D7q9c4tL0p pic.twitter.com/OJ46UrkBOF \u2014 Katie Bo Williams (@KatieBoWill) October 10, 2019\n\n1) this would obvs never be a story about a man\n\n\n\n2) this is not an expensive haircut/color for a public figure who is frequently on TV\n\n\n\n3) if her hair was raggedy, that would be the lead story instead\n\n\n\n4) \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44https://t.co/CyXaQ860ts \u2014 Jessica Valenti (@JessicaValenti) October 10, 2019\n\nLiterally nothing women do is the right thing in some people\u2019s eyes \u2014 Sarah Goodyear (@buttermilk1) October 10, 2019\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "\u201cI wonder if Republicans care about corruption as much as they care about a woman\u2019s cut and color,\" AOC tweeted.", "authors": ["Erin Donnelly"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/E_w4AoFWijSEfSFgQ03eWg--~B/aD00MDI0O3c9NjA0ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/dba5b520-eb72-11e9-af9b-b7253407fdb2", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
