Lindsey Graham (R-SC) said during a press conference Wednesday that House Democrats have continued to \u201cselectively leak\u201d information to the media to drive down President Donald Trump\u2019s poll numbers.\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Graham and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) released the Graham-McConnell resolution Wednesday, which condemns House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s (D-CA) secretive impeachment inquiry proceedings. The resolution has 44 Senate Republicans backing the resolution.\n\nSen. Graham said that the Democrats\u2019 current proceedings constitute a \u201csubstantial deviation\u201d from previous impeachments, including that of former President Bill Clinton.\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee chairman said that Democrats\u2019 new impeachment methods are \u201cdangerous for the country\u201d because they break with precedent. Pelosi charged House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA), not House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-NY), with the impeachment investigation. Graham noted that the Judiciary Committee normally investigates the president for a potential impeachment trial, not the Intelligence Committee.\n\n\u201cInstead of the Judiciary [Committee] looking at impeachable offenses, they created a process in the Intel Committee that\u2019s behind closed doors, doesn\u2019t provide the president access to the accuser,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAt its core un-American,\u201d Graham added.\n\nSen. Graham said that the Democrats have continued to \u201cselectively leak\u201d information to the media, which sets a dangerous precedent for future presidents, including Democrat presidents.\n\nHe said that the \u201cprocess is dangerous to the future of the presidency, because if you can drive down a president\u2019s poll numbers by having proceedings where you selectively leak information, where the president who\u2019s the subject of all of this, pretty much shut out of it, God help future presidents.\u201d\n\nGraham said that in contrast, they have \u201c41 senators\u201d backing the bill, showing that Republicans are fighting back.\n\nThe South Carolina senator then criticized the media\u2019s bias, suggesting that if Republicans deployed the same tactics Democrats have used against Trump for impeachment, \u201cyou would beat the shit out of us.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think if we were doing this you would beat the shit out of us,\u201d Graham said. \u201cI think if a Republican were doing to a Democrat what we\u2019re, you would be all over me, and I think it says a lot about people in your business.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou would be calling us every kind of bad name and we would deserve it,\u201d Graham added.\n\nRead the Graham-McConnell resolution here.", "description": "Lindsey Graham said that Democrats have continued to \"selectively leak\" information to drive down Trump's polling and push for impeachment.", "authors": ["Sean Moran"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Lindsey-Graham-Impeachment-Presser-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
