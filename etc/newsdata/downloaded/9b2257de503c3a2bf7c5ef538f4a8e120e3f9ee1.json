Then, his face out of frame, he fired an anti-tank round into Israel.\n\nThe widely-circulated propaganda video is only one of the issues on Israeli prime minister Benjamin \u201cBibi\u201d Netanyahu\u2019s plate this week. After publicly escalating against Israel\u2019s enemies across the region last month, Netanyahu has had to carefully manage the cycle of responses and counter-responses. And he\u2019s also facing a duo of internal issues: a showdown with the semi-autonomous Palestinian government and a looming corruption investigation.\n\nWith snap elections scheduled for September 17, Netanyahu is in a life-and-death political struggle.\n\n\u201cSo far [the clashes have had] no effect. The election is a public referendum on Netanyahu,\u201d wrote Aluf Benn, editor in chief of Ha\u2019aretz, in an email to the National Interest. Benn named the prime minister\u2019s behavior, accusations of corruption, and \u201ctribal loyalties\u201d as the main focus of the election.\n\nA recent New York Times investigation revealed that Netanyahu had clashed with then-chief of staff Gen. Benny Gantz, now the leading opposition candidate, over a plan to bomb Iranian nuclear facilities. With Gantz gone, the Netanyahu government is reportedly \u201cconsidering the possibility of a unilateral strike against Iran.\u201d But last week, Israel faced the possibility of fighting Iran\u2019s allies on its own soil.\n\nOn September 1, the Lebanese political party and militia Hezbollah fired anti-tank rounds across the border with Israel, striking an armored personnel carrier near the town of Avivim. The Israeli military responded with artillery fire and airstrikes in south Lebanon, and ordered towns along the border to prepare their own air raid shelters.\n\n\u201cWe have no casualties\u2014not even a scratch,\u201d Netanyahu told Israeli reporters. \u201cI have given instructions to be prepared for any scenario, and we will decide on what's next depending on how things develop.\u201d\n\nUNIFIL, the United Nations peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon, confirmed that Israel\u2019s \u201cretaliatory fire\u201d hit positions in Maroun al-Ras and Aitaroun, a few miles over the Lebanese side of the border. UNIFIL spokesman Andrea Tenenti said that neither the international monitors nor the Lebanese authorities were aware of any casualties on the Lebanese side of the border.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a serious incident in violation of Security Council Resolution 1701,\u201d Tenenti told the National Interest. \u201cIn a way, it was directed to undermine the situation in the area of operations. Luckily, we were able to, together with the parties, deescalate the situation and restore calm in the area.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe head of mission and force commander, Major General [Stafano] Del Col, has been fully and continuously engaged with the parties on the Lebanese side and the Israeli side to ensure that stability is maintained and also to ensure that there is no space for misunderstanding and escalation of tensions,\u201d he added. \u201cThe cessation of hostilities has been restored.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt least for now, both sides\u2014Hezbollah and Israel\u2014want to stick to this process of testing each other\u2019s red lines through a calibrated strategy,\u201d said Randa Slim, founding director of the Initiative for Track II Dialogues at the Middle East Institute.\n\nThe clash seems to make good on Hezbollah\u2019s prior threats to retaliate for Israel\u2019s attacks in late August. Two weeks ago, Israel killed two Hezbollah members in Syria, accusing them of planning a drone attack on Israelis in the disputed Golan Heights. Israeli drones then allegedly attacked a Hezbollah headquarters in Beirut.\n\nHassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, threatened an even wider response in a speech after the September 1 clashes.\n\n\u201cThe red line that Israel established on its border with Lebanon has been crossed,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you attack, then all of your borders, and soldiers and settlements on the border, and in the interior, and in the interior of the interior, will decisively be within the radius of intimidation and targeting and response, without any difficulty.\u201d\n\nBut for now, the battle has only escalated into a war of words, as both sides claim to be the victor.\n\nHezbollah claimed via its affiliate TV station to have killed or injured everyone on board the Israeli vehicle. Israel brushed off the injured soldiers caught on tape entering an air ambulance as decoys wearing fake blood.", "description": "Netanyahu battles enemies at home while holding off a fight in Lebanon.", "authors": ["Matthew Petti"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3k4n4wRmr.csXc9tJcxtOg--~B/aD05NzE7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/3187b82c9feb16b1dc68ff37f068c1ac", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
