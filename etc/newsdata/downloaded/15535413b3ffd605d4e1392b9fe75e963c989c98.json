But Canadians are far from aligned on which specific energy and climate policies to back.\n\n\u2014 The blackface scandal that rocked the election conversation has not yet realigned the race. An aggregate of surveys shows the top two parties still tied.\n\n\u2014 While Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland fight for their political survival above the 49th parallel,a team of old political hands will represent Canada at the U.N.

Opinions are largely split on regional and party lines, Lauren reports this morning.\n\n\u201cThe data just confirmed how divisive some of these issues and how regionalized they are,\u201d Abacus CEO David Coletto said.\n\n\u2014 Main takeaways: As one might expect, respondents from Western Canada were largely in favor of building more pipelines and expanding the oil industry, while Quebecers were mostly opposed. British Columbia voters were evenly split, and Ontarians\u2019 responses tracked with national opinion.\n\nThere was no clear national consensus on the carbon tax, while a modest plurality of those surveyed \u2014 41 percent \u2014 said Canada should build more pipelines.\n\nColetto noted quite a few voters didn\u2019t have a strong opinion one way or the other on energy and climate issues. While Canadians generally support the domestic energy industry, many don\u2019t appear to be as fervent about backing the sector as voters who live in the oil patch itself, he said.\n\n\u2014 How views could evolve: The data also show a strong correlation between voters\u2019 support for a carbon tax and whether they think climate change is a serious issue for government to address, Coletto said.\n\n\u201cAs more and more Canadians become concerned about climate change, it\u2019s likely that fewer and fewer will be supportive of keeping [the oil] industry going and keeping status quo public policy on it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2014 NDP on climate: New Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh announced Sunday that his government would more than double disaster mitigation funds to communities grappling with the effects of extreme weather events that scientists say will become more commonplace.\n\nSingh announced the plan in Gatineau, Que., which has faced flooding so severe in recent years that the provincial government has bought out some residents to compel them to live elsewhere.\n\nAT THE RACES \u2014 Trudeau\u2019s Liberal Party and the Conservative Party remain tied at 34 percent, according to an aggregate of polls.\n\nThat's nearly identical to last week's results, which had the Liberals down by one point. The other parties haven\u2019t picked up much support, either.\n\nTrudeau\u2019s party still has a subtle advantage in the regional breakdown of the votes: It holds a 15-point lead in Quebec and a five-point lead in Ontario -- the two provinces with the most seats.\n\n\u2014 Watching for other surprises: Coletto told Alex that the scandal\u2019s initial impact appears minimal, but that could change. One reason it could still matter is the race is so close, he said, and any individual event could ultimately prove decisive in a neck-and-neck battle.\n\nAnother factor to keep in mind is international reaction. Canadians are sensitive to the way their country is perceived, and they prize its reputation for tolerance, Coletto said.\n\nThus, the scandal could affect Canadians as they see the story picked up by major international outlets. \u201cWhen Donald Trump is surprised by this and commenting on it, you know it\u2019s gone beyond [Canada],\u201d Coletto said.\n\n\u2014 Stand by me: Freeland lent her voice last week to the chorus of support Trudeau\u2019s received from his Cabinet, saying Friday she had confidence in his leadership despite being \u201ctroubled and disappointed\u201d by the images. That\u2019s notable given her high visibility in Trudeau\u2019s government.\n\n\u2014 More blackface admissions: Green Party leader Elizabeth May acknowledged Saturday that one of the party\u2019s candidates in Newfoundland and Labrador admitted to wearing blackface once in a comedy sketch broadcast on the CBC nearly 30 years ago. May said the incident \u201cfalls in a different category\u201d because the skit \u201cwasn\u2019t a hidden video.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Peeling back the curtain: \u201cInside the charity gala where Justin Trudeau shocked 500 guests with blackface,\u201d from The Telegraph of U.K.\n\nWEEKEND ROUNDUP \u2014 Here\u2019s a quick look at what the major party leaders were touting on the stump over the weekend:\n\n\u2014 Liberals: After taking Saturday off, Trudeau announced on Sunday his plan to exempt from taxes the first $15,000 per year earned by \u201cmiddle-class Canadians.\u201d He also pledged to lower cell phone bills by encouraging more wireless competition.\n\n\u2014 Conservatives: Leader Andrew Scheer outlined a plan on Sunday in Charlottetown, P.E.I., to better deliver pensions and benefits to Canadian veterans.\n\n\u2014 NDP: Aside from making a climate announcement, Singh didn\u2019t rule out working with Liberals in a minority government, despite the brownface scandal. And Singh said Friday he\u2019d entertain a meeting with Trudeau to discuss racism, as long as it happened behind closed doors. On Saturday, he promised health and dental benefits to part-time and contract workers.\n\n\u2014 Greens: Leader Elizabeth May vowed Saturday in Winnipeg to decriminalize street drugs like methamphetamines and heroin.\n\nCANADA AT THE U.N. \u2014 It\u2019s customary for Canadian politicians to eschew travel abroad during formal campaign periods, so Ottawa is instead sending a team of veteran government hands to New York for UNGA\u2019s 74th session.\n\n\u2014 Who\u2019s who: Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Marta Morgan will lead the delegation, which includes former prime ministers Jean Chr\u00e9tien and Joe Clark; former Quebec premier Jean Charest; and Sen. Peter Boehm. Boehm served as Trudeau\u2019s sherpa when he hosted the G-7 in Charlevoix, Que., in 2018, an event memorable for President Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter diatribe upon his exit.\n\nClimate change is expected to be a major issue at the global confab this week.
