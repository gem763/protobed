VW's new ID3 models to be launched next year will have a range of 600km (373 miles).\n\nRwanda has an installed power generation capacity of 286 megawatts. Unlike many nations in Africa, Rwanda boasts electricity that is relatively reliable. And the cars would mainly charge at night, when there is an excess of power.\n\nEdouard Ngirente, Rwanda's prime minister, said he hoped electric car use could expand, noting that fuel products were Rwanda's biggest import last year.\n\nSchaefer acknowledged the high price of electric cars would not appeal to most African consumers, but said scaling up production and favourable government policy could help bring prices down.\n\n\"The Rwandan government is working on electric vehicle policy, and if that policy favours electric cars over traditional [ones], then that development can happen very fast, Schaefer said.", "description": "As a testing ground, Volkswagen will launch new electric vehicles in Kigali as part of its app-driven Move service.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/29/e1d18302a0d343d390a5236db3b1fe4e_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
