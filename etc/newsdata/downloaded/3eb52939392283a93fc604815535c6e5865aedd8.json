I guess we\u2019ll see, if we decide to put it on the Switch, if we can do it. Probably not.\u2019\n\nThe bigger question is whether the game will be released on the PlayStation 5 and next generation Xbox, rather than just being available via backwards compatibility, but Mamais only skated around that issue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It\u2019s going to be awesome\u2019, he said of the next generation. \u2018It\u2019s always cool to have new consoles coming out and I can\u2019t wait to work on those things. We\u2019ll see what we can do with those. It\u2019s fun watching games evolve; they\u2019re looking more and more realistic, which is \u2013 I like working on games like that. The more powerful the technology, or the consoles, the more it is [good] for me as a game developer.\u2019\n\nThere wasn\u2019t a lot of other new information from the interview, but Mamais did reconfirm that there will be no multiplayer available at launch and hinted that the game\u2019s DLC plans would be similar to The Witcher 3\u2019s \u2013 including no microtransactions.\n\nHe also offered the following on whether the game would hit the 16 April release date:\n\n\u2018A lot of people do [feel good about the April 2020 date and] some people are scared about the date. It\u2019s a normal kind of mixture of feeling about that date in the studio. That\u2019s the directive; we need to keep that date.\u2019\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter\n\nMORE: Cyberpunk 2077 will definitely have multiplayer, but not at launch\n\nMORE: Cyberpunk 2077 cut scenes \u2013 and sex scenes \u2013 will now be first person\n\nMORE: Cyberpunk 2077 deep dive gameplay video released \u2013 watch it here", "description": "The Witcher 3 may have made a surprise appearance on Switch but it doesn\u2019t seem as if the same is planned for its sci-fi follow-up.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/template-01be_1571049681.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
