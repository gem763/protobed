The biannual event first began in 1987 and is based on a notion that a 1000 watt car would complete the trip from Darwin to Adelaide in 50 hours.\n\nThe teams are expected to complete the race by Thursday, with speeds of 90-100 kmh (55-62 mph) powered only by the sun. In the week preceding the event, teams had to pass a series of practical safety and compliance tests to qualify for the start line.\n\nTop Dutch Solar Racing team car \u2018Green Lightning\u2019 led off the competitors from Darwin\u2019s State Square after earning pole position with the fastest lap at Hidden Valley Raceway on Saturday .\n\nThe teams, comprising of secondary and tertiary students form countries ranging from Australia through Sweden, Netherlands and Japan to the United States, must be self-sufficient, travelling each day as far as they can until 5 p.m. and making camps to stay overnight along the route through the desert.
