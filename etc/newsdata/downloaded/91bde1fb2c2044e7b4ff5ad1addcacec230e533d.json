While we all know getting into the spirit of the season is not a competition, you also want to create a festive home that really captures the magic of the holidays. And also, it wouldn't be so bad if everyone you knew raved that your decor looked straight out of a Hallmark movie. Well, now it could be.\n\nThe Hallmark Channel has officially launched their annual Holiday Home Decoration Sweepstakes, where you can win a chance for the television network to decorate both the inside and outside of your home\u2014for free. They are working with Balsam Hills, a Christmas decor company, to give home in the U.S. the opportunity to look like all the heartwarming, twinkly-light-covered, giant-ornamented-tree-bedecked houses you see in every Hallmark Christmas movie.\n\nPhoto credit: Rob Lewine - Getty Images More\n\nWondering how this could be your house this year? Psh, it's almost too easy to sign up. All you have to do is fill out a short application\u2014that will only ask for your name, email address and zip code\u2014in order to get a chance to revamp your abode. (You can earn an additional entry by creating a holiday scene on Hallmark's website, which you'll see just below the entry form.) You have now until 10 a.m. on September 23 to enter the raffle.\n\nOnce entries have closed, 25 finalists will be chosen at random, and that's where things get interesting: You'll be asked to fill out some forms and submit at least five photos of your home, according to the giveaway's rules. The top 25 will eventually be narrowed to five finalists, chosen by a team of judges, and from there, the public will help choose the grand-prize winner, who will get the interior and exterior of their home tricked out to look like the set of a holiday movie.\n\nYour Christmas miracle\u2014and bragging rights\u2014await! You can enter the sweepstakes here.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "Your Christmas miracle came early.", "authors": ["Megan Uy"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/fh.x73SZYdx5RU_C2D1I7g--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/house_beautiful_336/aa5141aa78422a76a71d1ec9e0a2d3b5", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
