Trading volume ballooned to about 95 million shares, compared with the full-day average of about 28.8 million shares, and enough to make the stock the most actively traded on major U.S. exchanges.\n\nIn a letter to AT&T\u2019s board of directors, Elliott Management said it believes the stock\u2019s underperformance relative to the S&P 500 SPX, -0.01% over the past decade has left the company \u201cdeeply undervalued.\u201d\n\nElliott said it\u2019s four-part value-creation plan \u2014 Activating AT&T Plan \u2014 could create an opportunity to boost the stock price to above $60 by the end of 2021, which would take the stock above the July 16, 1999, record close of $59.19. That would represent a gain of more than 65.5% from Friday\u2019s closing price of $36.25.\n\nElliott disclosed in the letter that it owned a $3.2 billion stake in AT&T, which it appears to have acquired within the past three months. In Elliott\u2019s latest 13F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission of its equity holdings, the hedge fund founded by billionaire Paul Singer, the fund didn\u2019t own any AT&T stock as of June 30.\n\nElliott\u2019s four-part plan includes an improved strategic focus, significant operational improvements, a formal capital allocation framework and enhanced leadership and oversight.\n\nThe first thing AT&T needs to do is to shift its strategy away from acquisition and toward execution, Elliott said, and start this by conducting a review of its portfolio to see what it should prioritize and which business it should divest.\n\nAmong some of assets Elliott believes are non-core and should be sold or spun off include DirecTV, the Mexican wireless operations, some of its wireline footprint and \u201cmany, many more.\u201d\n\nElliott also recommended more aggressive cost cutting, and has identified more than $10 billion in \u201copportunities\u201d for savings. And for capital allocation, Elliott said AT&T should continue to aggressively repay debt, remain committed to growing the dividend and should consistently repurchase its stock, especially since valuations are currently at the lowest levels since the financial crisis.\n\n\n\nDuring the second quarter ended June 30, AT&T spent about $71.8 million to buy back 2.2 million shares, after spending $208.2 million to repurchase about 6.8 million shares during the first quarter.\n\nElliott pointed out that AT&T\u2019s dividend yield, currently at 5.52%, presents a \u201cuniquely attractive opportunity,\u201d given its spread above Verizon Communications Inc.\u2019s VZ, -0.68% current dividend yield of 4.19% and above the yield on the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, +5.18% of 1.62%.\n\nSeparately, Elliott pointed out that Verizon has been aggressively cutting costs, including workforce reductions, while AT&T\u2019s organization is unnecessarily complicated and inefficient. For example, recent annual reports show that Verizon\u2019s workforce fell to 144,500 at the end of 2018 from 155,400 at the end of 2017, while the number of AT&T employees increased to 268,000 from 252,000 over the same time.\n\nAT&T\u2019s stock has gained 15% over the past 12 months, while Verizon shares have advanced 8.8% and the S&P 500 has tacked on 3.6%. Over the past decade, shares of AT&T have rallied 42%, while Verizon has more than doubled (up 104%) and the S&P 500 has almost tripled (up 188%).\n\nFactSet, MarketWatch\n\nRegarding enhanced leadership, Elliott said it has identified several leading candidates who may help as qualified directors, that it would like to discuss with the board.\n\nAT&T responded by saying it will review Elliott\u2019s perspectives. \u201cIndeed, many of the actions outlined are ones we are already executing today,\u201d AT&T said in a statement.\n\nAlso read: AT&T bows out of Hulu; will Comcast be next to sell its stake?\n\nSee related: WarnerMedia offers buyouts to Turner workers as AT&T reshapes business.\n\nCitigroup analyst Michael Rollins reiterated his buy rating while raising his price target for AT&T\u2019s stock to $42 from $37, but said that was independent of Elliott\u2019s activism efforts. He said his raised target was a result of the opportunities AT&T has to reduce debt, improve operating segments, further monetize non-core assets and improve returns to shareholders.\n\nAnalyst Jennifer Fritzsche at Wells Fargo kept her target at market perform, saying Elliott\u2019s letter shines the light on parts of AT&T\u2019s history which have resulted in the stock\u2019s compelling valuation. \u201cHowever, many of the suggestions it is making (beyond management change) we believe [AT&T is already pursuing,\u201d Fritzsche wrote in a note to clients. \u201cOne area we were somewhat surprised the letter didn\u2019t dig into was the need to fix the broadband issue.\u201d\n\nIn terms of AT&T\u2019s history that has hurt the stock, Elliott laid out AT&T\u2019s \u201cquestionable\u201d merger and acquisition strategy, in which it spent nearly $200 billion over the past decade in acquisitions that shifted the company\u2019s focus from a pure-play telecom company with leading franchises into a \u201csprawling collection of businesses\u201d in new markets with different regulations and well-funded competitors.\n\nDespite nearly 600 days passing since AT&T closed on its $109 billion buyout of Time Warner, which was originally announced in 2016, the company has yet to articulate a clear strategic rationale as to why it needs to own the media giant. \u201cWe think that, after $109 billion and three years, we should be seeing some manifestations of the clear strategic benefits by now,\u201d Elliott wrote.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: DirecTV is proving good for AT&T\u2019s wireless business, bad for TV.\n\nDespite AT&T saying pay TV is a \u201cvery good, durable business\u201d when the company announced a $67 billion acquisition of DirecTV announced in 2014, Elliott said the pay TV ecosystem has been under immense pressure since the deal closed. \u201cIn fact, trends are continuing to erode, with AT&T\u2019s premium TV subscribers in rapid decline as the industry, particularly satellite, struggles mightily,\u201d the letter said. \u201cUnfortunately, it has become clear that AT&T acquired DirecTV at the absolute peak of the linear TV market.\u201d\n\nMaybe the most damaging deal was the $39 billion deal to buy T-Mobile announced in 2011, that did not close because of regulatory pressure. \u201cUnfortunately for AT&T and the industry, AT&T paid the largest break-up fee of all time and provided T-Mobile with a seven-year roaming deal and the invaluable spectrum it needed to develop from a then-struggling competitor into the thriving force it is today,\u201d the letter said. \u201cIn addition to the internal and external distractions it caused itself, AT&T\u2019s failed takeover capitalized a viable competitor for years to come.\u201d", "description": "Shares of AT&T Inc. surge in heavy volume to an 18-month high, after an activist investor that recently purchased a large stake in the telecom and media...", "authors": ["Tomi Kilgore", "Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ943_ATT_09_ZG_20190909130459.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
