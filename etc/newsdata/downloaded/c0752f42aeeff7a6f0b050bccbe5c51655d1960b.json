The flavored e-cigarettes, in particular, have been criticized for their appeal to children. President Donald Trump voiced support to ban them in early September.\n\nBut the FDA commissioner\u2019s guarantee that he will enforce existing law stops short of an outright ban on flavored e-cigarettes. Existing law puts a halt on marketing such items until manufacturers can demonstrate that \u201cmarketing their products is appropriate to the protection of public health,\u201d Sharpless said. Companies will have until May 2020 to apply with the FDA for a license to do so, according to Bloomberg.\n\nHe added that it \u201cwould not mean flavored products will never be marketed.\u201d\n\nBan or not, the vape industry is in a state of upheaval over regulations and health concerns. Kevin Burns, CEO of the popular e-cigarette company Juul Labs, stepped down Wednesday as state and federal governments crack down on the industry and its marketing practices.\n\nAfter vaping products \u2015 many of them containing THC \u2015 were linked to nine deaths and hundreds of illnesses, Massachusetts announced a monthslong ban on the sale of all vaping products, and Walmart stopped selling e-cigarettes altogether.", "description": "During a hearing Wednesday, Ned Sharpless responded to congressional calls for an outright ban by saying his agency will \"enforce existing law.\"", "authors": ["Associate Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8b9a032200005800512a24.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
