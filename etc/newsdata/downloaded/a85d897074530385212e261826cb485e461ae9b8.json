Preschoolers rip toys out of each other\u2019s hands. Tweens gossip. The siblings you hoped would support each other now fight so often, you\u2019re a full-time referee.\n\nSome of that is just growing up. Little kids lash out because they haven\u2019t learned self-control. Older kids are thrown into complex social environments with relatively little control. Childhood can be really hard, and sometimes kids can, simply put, act like jerks.\n\nThe challenge for parents is figuring out whether a child\u2019s unkind or aggressive behavior \u2015 while perhaps not ideal \u2015 is developmentally appropriate, or whether it\u2019s a possible red flag.\n\n\u201cOur job as parents is not just to look out for protecting our kids from others, but also to make sure they\u2019re engaging in appropriate behavior,\u201d said Amanda Nickerson, director of the University at Buffalo\u2019s Alberti Center for Bullying Abuse Prevention.\n\nKerkez via Getty Images\n\nTo start, parents need to know what bullying is.\n\nBullying is generally defined as behavior that is unwanted and aggressive, that involves a real or perceived imbalance of power, and that happens repeatedly. It\u2019s important that bullying has emerged as a global public health issue, but experts say there is also now a tendency to use the term casually.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve become sloppy with the language,\u201d said Sherryll Kraizer, author of \u201c10 Days to a Bully-Proof Child\u201d and founder of the child safety nonprofit Coalition for Children. \u201cBullying is not, \u2018Billy was mean to me.\u2019 Bullying is a deliberate, repeated act of aggression of some sort; it might be emotional aggression.\u201d\n\nThat is different from conflict, which is an especially common part of early childhood. With conflict, there\u2019s no power difference. Both parties are disagreeing over something \u2015 like, I was playing with this first, and that\u2019s not fair. Teachers sometimes get frustrated when parents classify typical day-to-day conflicts as bullying, Nickerson said.\n\nHow we talk about this is important, because it can help parents discern if and when their own child\u2019s behavior is outside the norm. It also sets off a different chain of events for how schools deal with a particular child or incident. And it sends a message to kids: Labeling a child a \u201cbully\u201d is a big deal, and if they hear themselves described that way \u2015 as opposed to something like, \u201cHe\u2019s struggling to get along with other kids in a way that\u2019s cooperative\u201d \u2015 there\u2019s a risk it becomes almost a self-fulfilling part of a child\u2019s persona, Kraizer said.\n\nLook out for intentionality and repetition.\n\n\u201cBullying is intentional aggressive behavior,\u201d Nickerson said. \u201cIt usually happens over and over again, so that kind of pattern of behavior is definitely a concern.\u201d\n\nGet in the habit of asking short, specific and direct questions about how your child\u2019s day went. Ask about places where bullying often happens, like the playground, the bus, or, if they\u2019re a bit older, online. Say things like: \u201cWhat did you do on the playground today?\u201d \u201cWho\u2019d you play with?\u201d \u201cWho do you sit with?\u201d\n\nThen, as much as your schedule allows for it, try and directly watch your kids as they interact with other children. This can help you get a sense of these questions of intentionality and repetition.\n\n\u201cWhat we hear from them may or may not reflect what\u2019s really happening,\u201d Nickerson said. Watching can help.\n\nIf your kids are being unkind to others, talk to them about how it feels.\n\n\u201cPower feels good, and it\u2019s self-reinforcing, so you have to call it for what it is, and compare it to the cost on the other side,\u201d Kraizer said. She noted she\u2019s surprised by how seldom we talk to kids honestly about what it feels like when they\u2019re acting out.\n\nFor example, your preschooler might having a hard time sharing. You can acknowledge that it might feel good to get the toy they want by grabbing it from a friend\u2019s hand \u2015 and that it might even feel a little bit fun to give someone a hard time. Then ask: How do you think your friend felt?\n\nThe goal is to build up your kid\u2019s awareness of the other child\u2019s feelings, and to help them develop the skills they need to handle similar situations in a different way. You might say: Sure, it felt good to get that toy, but what are other ways you could go about it that wouldn\u2019t make your friend feel really sad?\n\nBasically, you\u2019re helping to teach them about empathy, which is a skill parents can help cultivate. It\u2019s by no means the antidote to bullying behavior, but it\u2019s certainly part of the equation.\n\nTune in to their need to be \u201cright.\u201d\n\nBullying is about power and a need for control, Nickerson said, so that\u2019s something to be aware of. Of course, many young kids insist they\u2019re right when they\u2019re clearly not, under many different circumstances. But does your child have a very strong desire to be right, so much so that it overrides all other behavior? \u201cWhen they talk about other people, do they use derogatory or negative terms about others in that same vein of, \u2018I\u2019m right and everybody else is stupid, or ugly, or slow?\u2019\u201d Nickerson said.\n\nNone of these things by itself necessarily means your child is a bully. But they can be signs that you might need to intervene and do some work with them around empathy and language use.\n\nGo to your kid\u2019s teachers.\n\nA good time to do that, unless it feels more urgent, is at the parent-teacher conference. \u201cYou might say, \u2018I\u2019m seeing some of this at home, and I just wonder if they\u2019re doing it with their peers?\u2019\u201d Nickerson said. \u201cAre there things you\u2019re working on, or things I can help reinforce at home?\u201d Teachers are around kids all day long, so they tend to have a sense of whether the behavior is something every kid does at that age, or whether it\u2019s a potential issue.\n\nAgain, some degree of this is just normal childhood stuff, but you do want to be working to develop social skills and to establish boundaries when kids are toddlers, and really cementing them when they\u2019re preschoolers, Kraizer says.\n\n\u201cOften, children who exhibit bullying behavior when they\u2019re younger are just telling you, \u2018I don\u2019t know how to get what I want,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cOr, \u2018I don\u2019t know how to make friends.\u2019 Or \u2018I don\u2019t know how to get the teacher\u2019s attention beyond misbehaving.\u2019\u201d Teachers and parents are skill builders, not just managers of children\u2019s behavior.\n\nBe clear about what\u2019s acceptable and what\u2019s not.\n\nAs simple as it sounds, remember that it\u2019s incredibly powerful to set clear, firm boundaries.\n\n\u201cYou say, \u2018This is unacceptable in our family. We do not treat people that way,\u2019\u201d Kraizer said. \u201cKids, especially young ones, are looking for, \u2018Who are we? What\u2019s acceptable to us?\u2019\u201d\n\nEstablishing clear boundaries also helps get at that question of intention. If your child is being aggressive and you haven\u2019t necessarily been clear about where the lines are, perhaps they\u2019re just confused. But if you have established clear, consistent boundaries, and they seem to be purposefully ignoring them, that is absolutely something to note.", "description": "Kids sometimes act out.
