(AP) - Dawn Staley didn\u2019t get to spend much time savoring her U.S. team\u2019s run to the FIBA AmeriCup championship. Less than two days later, the national coach was back barking orders and looking for more out of South Carolina at the Gamecocks opening practice Tuesday.\n\nStaley spent the past two weeks away, the first at a training camp for national team members playing in the FIBA event, then last week competing in Puerto Rico. The Americans won all six tournament games with an average margin of victory of more than 38 points. They took gold Sunday night with a 67-46 win over Canada.\n\n\u201cIt was a lot of newness, a lot of fun,\u201d Staley said of the event. \u201cIt didn\u2019t seem as pressure packed.\u201d\n\nStaley saved the pressure for the Gamecocks, who enter the season with the country\u2019s No. 1 recruiting class that includes four of the top 11 prospects from last year\u2019s high school class according to ESPN.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t stand still,\u201d Staley said during one time out. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to keep moving.\u201d\n\nStaley said she also was amped up to start working the Gamecocks out. She understands that it\u2019s only day one with more than a month to go before South Carolina opens the season against Alabama State on Nov. 5. Things ramp up in a hurry with the second game on Nov. 10 at Maryland.\n\n\u201cThe anticipation was there,\u201d Staley said. \u201cThe execution wasn\u2019t. But it\u2019s good. We\u2019ve got to have a team that needs probably to understand both sides of the basketball.\u201d\n\nThe 12-woman roster includes five freshman and Destiny Littleton, a Texas transfer who is awaiting an NCAA waiver to see if she can play immediately instead of sitting out.\n\nThe highly regarded freshman are 6-foot-4 forward Aliyah Boston, the country\u2019s third-ranked recruit; 5-9 point guard Zia Cook (No. 4); 6-3 forward Laetecia Amihere (No. 10); and 6-foot guard Breanna Beal (No. 11).\n\n\u201cI think they realize they realize they\u2019re good individual players,\u201d Staley said. \u201cBut how we get that to mesh as a team, we\u2019re a long way from that.\u201d\n\nStaley had some help on the scout team with WNBA players A\u2019ja Wilson and Tiffany Mitchell. Wilson was a three-time SEC player of the year while Mitchell won that honor twice.\n\nHaving both former Gamecocks stars on the court can help speed up the learning process, Staley said, and give the newcomers a glimpse of what may await them after college.\n\nTyasha Harris, the team\u2019s returning senior point guard, said it\u2019s been fun watching the first-year players meld to South Carolina way of high-tempo on offense and relentless effort on defense.\n\n\u201cThey know what\u2019s expected and we have standards they have to live up to,\u201d she said.\n\nBeal, from Rock Island, Illinois, acknowledged she was winded after a three-hour practice, something that rarely if ever happened in high school. She said she and the other first-year players know they\u2019ve got to learn and contribute quickly if the Gamecocks hope to challenge for SEC titles.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re willing to learn. We go through trial and error,\u201d Beal said. \u201cWith having the upper class and the coaches there to guide us, it won\u2019t take long.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top 25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Dawn Staley didn't get to spend much time savoring her U.S. team's run to the FIBA AmeriCup championship.
