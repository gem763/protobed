So as approximately 20 million students head back to college this fall, we got to wondering just what they will be eating. The truth may lie somewhere at the bottom of America\u2019s takeout orders.\n\nOnline food delivery company GrubHub, which now serves more than 20 million meals each quarter, analyzed delivery orders sent to more than 100 colleges in 47 states during the 2014-2015 academic year to see which students are making healthy choices at meal time. (The company used e-mail addresses ending in .edu to determine which orders came from people associated with college and universities.)\n\nThe University of Buffalo, home to 30,000, students, leads the competition when it comes to making healthy choices when students log online for food delivery. To determine the most health conscious schools, GrubHub analyze deliveries, looking for the highest percentage of orders at schools that contained any of 31 options which suggested students had made healthy food choices, like substituting a salad for another side dish or telling restaurants to go light on dressing.\n\nWhat schools are most often ordering vegetables? The University of North Carolina tops the list, according to GrubHub\u2019s analysis, followed by University of California, Berkeley, Stanford University, Harvard University and the University of Virginia.\n\nFor the complete list of healthiest colleges, see below.\n\nHEALTHIEST COLLEGES University of Buffalo St. John\u2019s University UC Davis Southern Illinois University The City University of New York University of Notre Dame Florida International University Fordham University American University University of California \u2013 Berkeley Miami University James Madison University Georgetown University University of Arizona Clemson University Northeastern University University of Florida The College of New Jersey Monmouth University Florida State University Vanderbilt University New Jersey Institute of Technology Rider University Manhattan College Elon University University of Delaware Yale University Villanova University Johns Hopkins University University of Tennessee Arizona State University University of Southern California Columbia University Fashion Institute of Technology Rowan University University of South Carolina Purdue University Suffolk University University of Illinois University of Illinois \u2013 Chicago New York University Johnson & Wales University Kent State University of California \u2013 Los Angeles Massachusetts Institute of Technology Roosevelt University Wesleyan University Boston College Eastern Michigan University Adelphi University\n\nPhoto: Danny Kim for TIME", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://timeinclabs.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/time-50-healthiest-foods-tomatoes-lighter.jpg?quality=75&strip=color"}
