The misery index is now as low as it has been since the late 1960s.\" (Incidentally, it was in the 1960s that economist Art Okun cooked up the measure.)\n\nThe message was clear: sure, we have our fair share of unsettling challenges in today's economy, but set against times past it could be much worse.\n\n\"It is useful to remind ourselves of this sometimes,\" Lowe said.\n\nHousehold incomes\n\nI remember the misery index. Not from four decades ago (I was still mastering walking), but even a decade ago it was still a thing. So why don't we talk about it anymore? After all, it is true. Unemployment is relatively low and inflation lower still. Why don't we feel more positive about the economy and our position in it?\n\nWell, as Lowe himself noted, the \"close cousin\" of low inflation is \"slow growth in nominal wages and household incomes\".\n\nTaking it a step further, it is evident that what Lowe & Co are battling is not high and climbing unemployment, but stubbornly abundant spare capacity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficial data on Thursday showed the jobless rate ticked down to 5.2 per cent from 5.3 per cent after a record 36-month run of job gains.\n\nIt was a good number, agreed economists. But some of them added a caveat, including Westpac's Simon Murray.\n\n\"Looking past the monthly movement, an 8.3 per cent underemployment rate is still quite high and evident of broader labour market slack beyond the 5.2 per cent unemployment rate,\" he wrote.\n\nThere is a degree of angst in the labour market not captured by the official jobless stats. Jason South\n\nIn fact, economists have become increasingly obsessed with the \"underemployed\".\n\nIn previous decades, the jobless rate was considered an appropriate measure of spare capacity in the labour market. Lowe noted in a June speech that the traditional assumption was \"if you have a job you are pretty much fully employed\".\n\nYet this \"is not a realistic assumption in today's modern flexible labour market\".\n\nThe rise of part-time work, particularly among the growing female labour force, has been reinforced by the more recent advent of the \"gig economy\" \u2013 one-off jobs facilitated by tech platforms, which match those seeking work with those supplying it, such as Airtasker.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis has led to a more modern phenomenon in which, in Lowe's words, \"it has become common to be both employed and to work fewer hours than you want to work\".\n\nThese are the jobs stats that show the soft underbelly of the economy.\n\nThey sit alongside sky-high household debt, negligible wage growth and soft business investment. A less vital economic status quo is further threatened by cyclical factors with long tails: the continued collapse in homebuilding activity and a fractious global economy.\n\nWith this in mind, a better \"misery index\" would include not just the official jobless rate, but also the underemployment rate. Combined, these gauge the labour market \"underutilisation rate\".\n\nLingering concerns\n\nTracking the movement of our new adjusted misery index over time shows Lowe's point still holds: we are better off these days than we were back in the 1970s and 1980s. But there are some telling insights in our most recent history.\n\nFor one, it's clear that since around the GFC the traditional misery index has trended lower, even as the version adjusted for underemployment has drifted the other way. It hasn't spiked by any means, but our adjusted misery index doesn't tell the same unalloyed positive story one might have taken by simply considering low inflation and falling unemployment. It speaks to the lingering concerns that have undermined confidence and retail spending.\n\nThere is a happier story to tell around the underemployment statistics, which belies the \"misery\" tag I've attached.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe trend towards part-time and more flexible jobs has provided more options to many who otherwise might have chosen either not to enter or to leave the workforce.\n\nLowe noted this in his June speech, adding: \"From the perspective of adding to the productive capacity of the nation, this is a good outcome and if there was a measure of underutilisation that took account of exclusion from the workforce, it would surely have declined.\"\n\nMore broadly, the message from the misery index is that we need to reconsider many traditional measures of economic progress and prosperity. Work has changed, as we have seen. But so, arguably, has economic output in a digital age \u2013 changes that may not be captured in traditional measures of GDP and productivity.\n\nIt all adds to the challenges facing us as investors in interpreting the data by which we are trying to steer.", "description": "This week confirmed a record streak of jobs growth, but structural shifts in the labour market mean this is not the unalloyed good news of times past.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_398%2C$y_29/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/a0e2b54855b22bcc6788fb7971370253a6f76491", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
