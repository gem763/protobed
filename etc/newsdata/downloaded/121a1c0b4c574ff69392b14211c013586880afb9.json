Which is a long time by the way, given that there hasn't been one whiff of a release data for the sequel.\n\nSo far, develop Rockstar Games has made no allusions to follow up title to their 2013 smash hit. There have been a few unconfirmed leaks, and a hint or two from voice actors supposedly involved in the project, but nothing more. So is this superfan going to drive themselves into a coma? Probably not.\n\nThe feat will likely be the longest ever test of endurance in gaming history. Well beyond human capabilities really, so it's likely they will be using one of the many auto-driving bots available online. Which makes even more sense when you realize the YouTuber is accepting donations for this stunt.\n\nStill, the stream has been online for over 21 days at the time of writing, with them having completed about 1400 laps of the entire map of the game.\n\nIt is very likely we will see a GTA 6 soon though, either later this year or early 2020. After all, it's been about six or so years since the last game, about the average amount of time it takes to develop a game of this size. But only time will tell for sure.", "description": "The Grand Theft Auto franchise is 22 years old now, but it still has a dedicated fan base ready to play each new installment.
