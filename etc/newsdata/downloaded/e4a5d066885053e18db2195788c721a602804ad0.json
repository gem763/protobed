Marry Me???\u201d\n\nAlthough Antoine can be heard excitedly accepting the proposal in the video, Weber did not survive long enough to celebrate the good news with her.\n\n\u201cYou never emerged from those depths, so you never got to hear my answer, \u2018Yes! Yes! A million times, yes, I will marry you!!\u2019 \u201d she wrote in her emotional post.\n\n\u201cWe never got to embrace and celebrate the beginning of the rest of our lives together, as the best day of our lives turned into the worst, in the cruelest twist of fate imaginable,\u201d she said. \u201dI will try to take solace in the fact that we enjoyed the most amazing bucket list experiences these past few days, and that we both were so happy and absolutely giddy with excitement in our final moments together.\u201d\n\nAs she mourned his death, Antoine wrote that she will love Weber for the rest of her life.\n\n\u201cI will carry the blessing of the love we shared with me forever. I will find you and marry you in the next lifetime, and the next, and the next, and the next\u2026 I love you so much, and I always will,\u201d she wrote.\n\n\u201cPlease pray for all the family and friends that loved him so much. Please love each other while you can, as hard as you can. I know that wherever in the universe Steven\u2019s spirit now resides, that is exactly what he\u2019s doing: giving love and spreading joy and laughter. And knowing him, always quick with an off-color joke, he\u2019s probably entertaining someone with a story about how he royally screwed up that proposal and died while being extra,\u201d she added. \u201cRest well, my sweet baby! Always know that you are forever loved!\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Carpenter with Just 2 Pairs of Jeans Dies with $3 Million in Savings and Sends 33 People to College\n\nOn Saturday, the CEO of The Manta Resort issued a statement to CNN, confirming Weber\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cOur sincerest condolences, thoughts and prayers are with his girlfriend, families and friends impacted by this tragic accident,\u201d said Matthew Saus, who also told the outlet that the incident was being investigated by local authorities.\n\nThe State Department also confirmed that a U.S. tourist died in Tanzania, but did not identify Weber by name, according to WBRZ.\n\n\u201cWe offer our sincerest condolences to the family on their loss.
