We will adopt your baby!\u201d a sign in the photo said.\n\nThe couple posted the image in response to New York\u2019s recently passed law that legalizes abortion up to birth in many cases.\n\nAfter the couple\u2019s post went viral, the couple agreed to adopt a child. Their request initially fell through, because the mother decided to keep the child.\n\nBut their wishes of adopting a child were answered, as the couple told Fox News that they are about to adopt an 11-year-old Bulgarian boy.\n\n\u201cWe recently felt God burdening our hearts for older orphans, specifically boys who statistically are the least likely to be adopted,\u201d Sarah Tomas told the outlet. \u201cWe\u2019re so excited to meet him and we\u2019re amazed by how God has already filled our hearts with love for this boy on the other side of the world that we\u2019ve never met.\u201d\n\nThe child is not the first to enter the Thomas family through adoption.\n\nThe family has a three-year-old son named Kayden whom they adopted through the foster care system, in addition to their one-year-old biological son.\n\nThe Virginia couple says dozens of mothers have reached out to them saying they were inspired to keep their babies after seeing their Facebook post.", "description": "A Virginia couple, who went viral with a pro-life Facebook post this year urging women not to abort their babies, got their wish.", "authors": ["Katherine Rodriguez"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/07/abortion-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
