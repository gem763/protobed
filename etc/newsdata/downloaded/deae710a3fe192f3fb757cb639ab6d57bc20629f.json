So actually, scratch that, it is definitely time to panic.\n\nREAD MORE HOW GOOD: Scott Morrison To Miss Huge UN Climate Summit During US Trip\n\nA recent report by the UN and the world\u2019s best climate agencies has found that the period between 2015-2019 has seen the hottest global temperate on record.\n\n\u201cIt is currently estimated to be 1.1 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial (1850-1900) times and 0.2 degrees Celsius warmer than 2011-2015,\u201d the report read.\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking. 1.1 degrees? That\u2019s the difference between a light cardi and a hoodie, it\u2019s nothing! But that 1.1 degree of warming is set to have catastrophic impacts that will be felt all over the world.\n\nThe report also found that the Arctic summer ice as decreased by a whopping 12% in the last 40 years, largely because of the warming since 2015.\n\nMeanwhile, the Antarctic is equally fucked, with the melt rate increasing sixfold each year between 1979 and 2017. The report also concluded that glacier loss in the last five years is at an all-time high, according to news.com.au.\n\nAccording to CSIRO Climate Science Centre\u2019s chief research scientist, Dr Pep Canadell, we need to cut emissions as soon as possible. Preferably, yesterday.\n\n\u201cIf we increase to 2 degrees or above the impact of extreme weather events will be catastrophic for many economies,\u201d he said in an SMH interview.\u201cIt is very likely we will go to 2 degrees and if we don\u2019t do a lot more we will go well above that.\u201d\n\nInstead of reducing, the world\u2019s CO2 emissions actually grew by 2% last year, which is exactly the opposite of what needs to happen right now.\n\n\u201cTechnically, it is still possible to bridge the gap in 2030 to ensure global warming stays below 2 degrees and 1.5 degrees \u2026 However, if nationally determined contributions are not increased urgently and backed up by immediate action, exceeding the 1.5 degrees goal can no longer be avoided,\u201d the report warned.\n\nThe UN\u2019s report comes after last week\u2019s climate strike\u2019s, with Secretary General Antonio Guterres calling a climate summit on Monday to urge countries to drastically reduce their emissions. According to The Guardian, we need to triple our climate emission reduction targets in order to meet the Paris Climate Agreement goals.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s face it, we have no time to lose,\u201d Gueterres said before the summit.\n\nShocking to absolutely nobody at this point, ScoMo isn\u2019t attending the summit despite being in the US right now. He actually refused Guterres\u2019 request to meet, likely because he\u2019s too busy taking photos with Gold Logies at NASA HQ. Despite all of the incredible efforts across the country at last week\u2019s climate strike, Scott Morrison continues to blatantly ignore the issue. Are we surprised? No. Are we disappointed? Absolutely.", "description": "The UN has just released a report that reckons we need to triple our emission reduction to avoid feeling catastrophic impacts.", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-647015894-1024x648.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
