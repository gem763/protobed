Photo: Courtesy of the vendors\n\nWhile poking around the bowels of Amazon, we noticed something slightly surprising \u2014 sprinkled among the site\u2019s many, many men\u2019s watches from brands you\u2019ve never heard of were plenty of actually great timepieces, from known makers like Braun, Nixon, Timex, Skagen, and Daniel Wellington. The best part? Lots of them cost under $150. It\u2019s true that people are less inclined to wear watches these days, but a lot of these watches are so fun \u2014 and affordable \u2014 that we think you might be convinced to go analog again (okay, there are a few digital watches here too, but you know what we mean).\n\nTimex Weekender Watch, 38mm The military-style Timex Weekender is a classic at a great price. We like the rugged look of the olive nylon band and off-white dial, but there are plenty of other options, including one with Snoopy in a space suit. $31 at Amazon Buy $31 at Amazon Buy\n\nCasio G-Shock Digital Watch $44 (was $70, now 37% off) This old-school Casio G-Shock is simple and durable, with plenty of throwback style. Plus, it\u2019s much more low-profile than your typical G-Shock. $44 at Amazon Buy $44 at Amazon Buy\n\nTimex Metropolitan Watch, 40mm With its black, genuine leather strap and silver dial, Timex\u2019s Metropolitan watch makes for a sophisticated and surprisingly affordable timepiece. $54 at Amazon Buy $54 at Amazon Buy\n\nSeiko Men\u2019s SNK807 Seiko 5 Automatic Stainless Steel Watch With Blue Canvas Band A self-winding automatic watch at less than $70 is basically unheard of, and the brushed-steel casing and blue canvas band give this a refined-but-casual look. $67 at Amazon Buy $67 at Amazon Buy\n\nFossil The Minimalist Quart Stainless Steel Dress Watch, 44mm $73 (was $135, now 46% off) You can\u2019t go wrong with with this elegant, stripped-down Fossil watch. The numberless black dial with white markings is sophisticated and still easy to read. $73 at Amazon Buy $73 at Amazon Buy\n\nSt\u00fchrling Original Men\u2019s 122.33551 Classic Ascot Somerset Watch Black mesh metal and large gold numbers give this big Airplane Cockpit Energy. $90 at Amazon Buy $90 at Amazon Buy\n\nCitizen Men\u2019s BM8180-03E Eco-Drive Stainless Steel Watch With Green Canvas Band Another military-style watch, from the brand Citizen. The black dial and prominent markings give it the look of an expensive diver\u2019s watch, while the olive canvas band makes it a little more understated. $94 at Amazon Buy $94 at Amazon Buy\n\nSkagen Kristoffer Multifunction Stainless Steel Quartz Watch with Woven Fabric Band $97 (was $125, now 22% off) If you aren\u2019t afraid of a little color, this multifunction quartz watch from Skagen is a lot of fun. $97 at Amazon Buy $97 at Amazon Buy\n\nBraun Men\u2019s BN0032WHSLMHG Classic Mesh Analog Display Japanese Quartz Silver Watch Regular readers will know we are big fans of a classic Dieter Rams Braun number, and this watch is no exception. The mesh metal band, white dial, and probably-Helvetica hour markers are all part of its iconic look. $105 at Amazon Buy $105 at Amazon Buy\n\nDaniel Wellington Classic Black Sheffield, 40mm $114 (was $229, now 50% off) We\u2019ve been seeing these minimalist Daniel Wellington watches everywhere (and not just on those subways that are plastered with the brand\u2019s ads featuring Hailey Bieber and Odell Beckham Jr.). They\u2019re popular for a reason: These sleek watches look like they could easily be ten times the price. $114 at Amazon Buy $114 at Amazon Buy\n\nSwatch Metal Knit Quartz Resin Watch This one came to us via our Resident Cool Guy Chris Black, who says it\u2019s \u201cthe perfect choice if you want something new and crushingly simple. A truly \u2018less-is-more\u2019 piece of wristwear, it says I am smart and successful, but don\u2019t need a piece of high-end wristwear to prove it.\u201d $120 at Amazon Buy $120 at Amazon Buy\n\nAdidas Watches Archive M1 Stainless Steel Digital Watch For some reason, we\u2019re really into vintage-looking digital watches right now, so here\u2019s another from Adidas that feels almost \u201cretro-future,\u201d like something you\u2019d see in Blade Runner. $130 at Amazon Buy $130 at Amazon Buy\n\nNautica Men\u2019s N16695G NCT 17 Brushed Stainless Steel Watch With Brown Band The brown leather band, deep-blue dial, and multiple stopwatch dials give this a sporty \u2014 but still classic \u2014 look. $137 at Amazon Buy $137 at Amazon Buy\n\nProjects Unisex Crossover 40mm Leather Band Watch Because you\u2019re wondering: The second hand is yellow, the minute hand white, and the hour hand gray. Wear this watch and tell people you\u2019re an architect or something. They\u2019ll believe you. $145 at Amazon Buy $145 at Amazon Buy\n\nLacoste Men\u2019s \u201812.12-TECH\u2019 Quartz Plastic and Rubber Smart Watch Lacoste isn\u2019t just for preps.
