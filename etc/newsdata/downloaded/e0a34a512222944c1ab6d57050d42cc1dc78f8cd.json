He was unrepentant about using intemperate language, doubling down on describing the Benn Act, forcing him to seek an extension of the UK\u2019s EU membership in the event of no deal, as the \u201cSurrender Act\u201d. It doubtless plays well in focus groups, and he will not lose sleep if accusing parliament of surrendering to the EU widens the already dangerous divide between MPs and the public. Or worry that his label is factually inaccurate: the Benn Act, named after its Labour sponsor Hilary Benn, gives MPs the right to reject an extension proposed by the EU.\n\nIn his interview, Mr Johnson used \u201csurrender\u201d no fewer than 15 times, taking refuge in MPs\u2019 use of military metaphors \u201cfor centuries\u201d. He deployed it to deflect attention from his dismissing as \u201chumbug\u201d the fears of female MPs about threats of violence against them. He claimed, unconvincingly, there was a misunderstanding; that he used \u201chumbug\u201d in the context of MPs trying to prevent him using \u201csurrender\u201d.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

As with their bogus claim in the 2016 referendum that leaving the EU would provide an extra \u00a3350m a week for the NHS, they calculate that if enough people talk about something, it enters the public consciousness whether it is true or not. It diverts attention from what they don\u2019t want to talk about: the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark ruling that Mr Johnson unlawfully suspended parliament slipped quickly out of the headlines amid rowdy Commons scenes encouraged by Mr Johnson\u2019s language.\n\nBut he is playing with fire: his apparent dismissal of threats of violence has damaged him, and will not help him close the gender gap in which his support among women trails that among men.\n\nHe is also playing with fire in a much wider sense. The former home secretary Amber Rudd was right to warn that the language \u201ccoming out of No 10 does incite violence\u201d. Indeed, some of Mr Johnson\u2019s allies have been irresponsibly talking up the prospect of a \u201cviolent uprising\u201d if parliament blocks Brexit.\n\nAlthough Downing Street sources deny they might use such a threat to evade the Benn Act by invoking the Civil Contingencies Act, the same sources denied Mr Johnson was about to prorogue parliament just before he did. The prime minister deserves full marks for irony: another possible loophole in the Benn Act being explored by ministers is to argue that EU law takes precedence over it, so the UK should leave on 31 October under Article 50 of the EU\u2019s governing treaties. Such a claim should be tested in the Supreme Court, and surely would be.\n\nBy writing the 48 per cent out of the script, Mr Johnson is breaking his promise to unite the country. He has set his course: a narrow path to a general election in which he hopes to whip up angry Leave voters, and rely on the Remain vote being split between the Tories\u2019 rivals. It would further polarise the country. He is also ignoring his responsibility as prime minister to set the right tone of the debate at such a sensitive time. His claim to have been \u201ca model of restraint\u201d is fanciful.\n\nAt some point, after an election or Final Say referendum or perhaps both, a decision on Brexit will be reached. Mr Johnson or a successor will have to pick up the pieces, heal the wounds and bring the country back together again. As he prioritises getting over the Brexit line whatever the damage, Mr Johnson\u2019s reckless approach is making that eventual task much more difficult.", "description": "When he took office two months ago, Boris Johnson said outside 10 Downing Street: \u201cMy job ... is to be prime minister of the whole United Kingdom, and that means uniting our country.\u201d", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/26/19/boris-johnson-downing-street-0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
