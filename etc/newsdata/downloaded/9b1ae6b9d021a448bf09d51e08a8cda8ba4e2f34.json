Today, more than 42 million people from all over the world come to the mall annually.\n\nFrom groundbreaking to opening day, here are photos from the early days of the Mall of America.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nWhen it opens on Friday, American Dream will be one of the largest malls in North America, featuring a theme park, ice rink, water park, and indoor ski center in addition to over 450 shops.\n\nThough the three-million-square-foot American Dream megamall will be huge, it won't be the largest mall in the US. That title belongs to Mall of America, which is owned by Triple Five Group, the same company that owns American Dream.\n\nCovering more than 5.6 million square feet and boasting a theme park and aquarium, Mall of America is more than just a shopping center. It's practically a city. 40 million people visit this Minnesota complex annually and it cost over $650 million to build. The mall currently has over 500 stores, and it generates nearly $2 billion in economic activity for Minnesota every year, according to press materials for the shopping center.\n\nBut when 78 acres of land were set to be developed by Bloomington Port Authority and Triple Five Group in the late 1980s, people had doubts about whether a mall of this scale would succeed. In 1989, a groundbreaking ceremony kicked off construction.\n\nThe Mall of America opened on August 11, 1992, with 330 stores and 10,000 employees. At least 150,000 people came to the mall on opening day, and the project was deemed a massive success.\n\nHere's what the mall looked like at the beginning, from construction to opening day:", "description": "The American Dream megamall opens Friday.
