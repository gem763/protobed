Those documents include emails and letters describing negotiations by Qatari officials before the vote to award the championships on 18 November 2014. The negotiations were with Diack and his father, the former IAAF president Lamine Diack, who are both due to stand trial on corruption charges next year in Paris.\n\nLamine Diack is being held in France. Papa Massata Diack, who was banned from athletics for life in 2016, is a fugitive in Senegal. Both men deny the charges. The International Olympic Committee said in a statement it had been told by Senegal\u2019s president, Macky Sall, that his country would \u201cfully cooperate with the French judicial authorities\u2019 investigations\u201d.\n\nThe Guardian, Der Spiegel and Mediapart have seen a draft and unsigned contract drawn up in February 2015, which sets out how the $4.5m mentioned in an 18 November 2014 letter would be paid in instalments. That draft contract was also discovered during the ongoing investigation by the French investigating judge Renaud Van Ruymbeke, which has now been taken up by his colleague B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte de Perthuis.\n\nPapa Massata Diack, who is the subject of an Interpol arrest warrant after being accused of corrupting the bidding processes of a number of IAAF world championships and Olympic Games, denied any wrongdoing. He told the Guardian he had a \u201cfull mandate\u201d to negotiate on behalf of Dentsu, a Japanese marketing company. In an unsigned document, it was proposed the IAAF should grant Dentsu the commercial rights to the world championships but that \u201cDentsu has indirectly granted the rights to TSA [the Sporting Age].\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Papa Massata Diack said he had a \u2018full mandate\u2019 to negotiate deals. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe IAAF said in a statement any contracts signed by it were part of the French investigation and so it was not able to comment. However it added \u201cit is important to note that sponsor and broadcast commercial partnerships are signed with Dentsu who own the marketing and commercials rights\u201d and that the Sporting Age received no money in those contractual payments.\n\nThe organisers of the Doha bid not respond to a number of questions. Dentsu also did not respond to a request for comment. The Guardian has been unable to confirm whether or not a $4.5m payment was made.\n\nAccording to other documents seen by the Guardian, the Sporting Age received $4.3m from September 2014 from the Beijing 2015 World Athletics Organising Committee, under a contract for the purchase of national rights similar to the one negotiated with Doha. The Beijing committee did not respond to requests for a comment.\n\nPapa Massata Diack did not deny his close links to The Sporting Age and told the Guardian: \u201cMy contract with [the] IAAF did not cover receiving any payment on behalf of the IAAF and I have never done so,\u201d he said. \u201cAs of the French investigation on marketing, sponsorship and TV activities my stance is very clear. They have no legal jurisdiction to investigate contracts under Swiss, Monaco or Japanese laws. The French investigation seems to be trying to audit the full 16 years of Lamine Diack leadership.\u201d\n\nLamine Diack, through his lawyer, said he did not want to comment.\n\nSign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n\nBoth Diacks are at the heart of one of the biggest corruption investigations in the history of sport. They are due to face trial from 13 January 2020 for having been allegedly involved in a scheme in which the Russian athlete Liliya Shobukhova was extorted for money in exchange for hiding anomalies with her biological passport, allowing her to compete at the London 2012 Olympics.\n\nIt has already emerged the Qatar organising committee for the world championships, which begin on Friday, sent the IAAF a letter promising to build 10 athletics stadiums around the world the day before the 2014 vote. A second letter, to Lamine Diack, only a few hours before the vote purported to promise additional benefits, including a $30m sponsorship from a Qatari bank and the purchase of the TV rights by BeIN for $2.5m.\n\nThe IAAF said the 10 tracks are subject to a \u201cneeds-based assessment\u201d to decide where they should go. It said the Qatari bank sponsorship deal was signed last year with all contractual payments going to Dentsu. However a BeIN contract was never signed and BeIN does not hold any rights to the 2019 world championships.\n\nPapa Massata Diack said in an email: \u201cAs for Qatar, China, Russia, South Korea, Brazil, UAE, I have full mandate to secure and sign sponsorship agreements, on behalf of Dentsu or [a Swiss company] AMS.\n\n\u201cAny monies collected by my company is duly documented and approved by my stakeholders: the rights owner. My relationship with Dentsu and AMS does not suffer of any discrepancy. I have helped them enrich the IAAF and the sport of athletics.\u201d\n\nThe IOC reiterates its full commitment to the protection of the integrity of sport International Olympic Committee statement\n\nAMS said: \u201cWe do not respond to media inquiries.\u201d\n\nThe Guardian, Mediapart and Der Spiegel sent a series of questions to the International Olympic Committee. The IOC reply concluded: \u201cYour requests refer to events before the IOC introduced far-reaching reforms. With the reforms of Olympic Agenda 2020, the IOC reinforced its code of ethics and introduced an approved list of consultants. In order to be on the list, the consultants have to declare they respect the strict IOC rules on governance and ethics, and in particular anti-corruption. Candidate cities can only hire consultants that are on the list.\n\n\u201cThe IOC reiterates its full commitment to the protection of the integrity of sport. It will continue to address any issue under the rules and regulations of its recently reformed governance system. The IOC Ethics Commission will continue to monitor the situation and, where evidence is provided, we will act.\u201d\n\nThe investigating judges suspect that Papa Massata Diack took commissions on IAAF contracts in exchange for his father influencing the votes for the Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020 Olympics. In March Tsunekazu Takeda, the chairman of the Japanese Olympic Committee, resigned after coming under investigation by Van Ruymbeke. Takeda has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nDoha\u2019s unsuccessful bid for the 2017 World Athletics Championships, which was won by London, is also under investigation because of two payments totalling $3.5m which were sent to Papa Massata Diack in October and November 2011 at a time when Qatar was bidding to host several major events, including the 2020 Olympics.\n\nNasser al-Khelaifi, the president of Paris Saint-Germain and the Qatari media group beIN, and the general manager of beIN, Yousef al-Obaidly, are under investigation by French judges regarding this payment. Both men strenuously deny any wrongdoing.", "description": "Leaked documents involve firm linked to Papa Massata Diack", "authors": ["Sean Ingle"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25f88676465e447f54e8b89d5ff9c7ea77fc6a81/0_365_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c8673e10a1021350df42e755188b9fc7", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
