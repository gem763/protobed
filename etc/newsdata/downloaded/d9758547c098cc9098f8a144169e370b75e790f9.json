Did he have the right mind-set to be a Manchester United player? After all, the manager has seen his fair share of talented individuals pass through Old Trafford who aren't psychologically cut out to succeed at a club of United's stature.\n\nHe wanted to know if that might be the reason why the fourth most expensive signing in United's history had failed so miserably to make an impact in the 16 months since he was signed from Shakhtar Donetsk for \u00a352million.\n\nFred endured another afternoon to forget as Manchester United lost 1-0 away at Newcastle\n\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer met Fred for a chat in pre-season but his displays have not improved\n\nFRED AT MAN UNITED Appearances: 32 Starts: 24 Goals: 1 Assists: 3 Chances created: 26 Yellow cards: 5\n\nIt doesn't help when the man himself admits to being slightly overawed by the prospect of representing United. 'I know this club is gigantic,' said Fred last week. 'Every day when I arrive at the training ground, when I see those big letters with the name of the club, I pinch myself.'\n\nDespite claims to the contrary, Jose Mourinho was actually rather pleased when United got their man in June of last year. Once again, they had pinpointed a Manchester City transfer target and gazumped their neighbours to sign him. Like Alexis Sanchez, however, Fred has turned out to be a huge - and costly - disappointment.\n\nIndeed, when United fans pay tribute to Solskjaer with a rendition of 'Ole's at the Wheel' and sing the line 'we've got Sanchez, Paul Pogba and Fred', it does have a rather hollow ring to it.\n\nJose Mourinho was happy to land Fred ahead of rivals Manchester City in the summer of 2018\n\nFred played 25 times in his first season including five appearances as a substitute, chalking up one goal against Wolves at Old Trafford 11 months ago and two assists, one of which was for Romelu Lukaku against Southampton in March.\n\nOnly he and Solskjaer know what was said during that chat in the summer after the player was allowed to miss the Australian leg of United's pre-season tour to celebrate his marriage to Monique Salum - mother of his baby son Benjamin - at home in Brazil.\n\nHowever, the 26-year-old appears to have gone backwards since then. So far this season he has made seven appearances and four starts, including the less taxing games against Astana of Kazakhstan and Rochdale.\n\nFred missed some of Manchester United's pre-season to celebrate marrying Monique Salum\n\nThe Brazilian has found himself on the bench for much of his time at Old Trafford so far\n\nDespite the departures of Ander Herrera and Marouane Fellaini, Fred has been unable to hold down a regular first-team place. The emerging Scott McTominay is the preferred partner for Pogba in defensive midfield. When either of those two players aren't available, Solskjaer - like Mourinho - is just as likely to turn to Nemanja Matic, a slower but more reliable alternative.\n\nAfter Fred got the nod ahead of Matic in United's last game, a lame defeat at Newcastle, Sportsmail pundit Martin Keown delivered a withering assessment of the South American after seeing him lose the ball on several occasions.\n\n'They're so inept in possession,' said Keown. 'Fred, it's almost becoming a joke when he gets the ball.'\n\nLee Dixon was just as brutal on American TV channel NBC. 'The jury has delivered its verdict. If Fred is the answer to United's problems then they are in big trouble,' said Dixon.\n\nBig things were expected of Fred when he joined United for \u00a352million from Shakhtar Donetsk\n\n'He is clearly not the answer. You look at Manchester United's midfield as a whole and you wonder what the game plan is. What is the system? Does anybody know? Against Newcastle it just got worse and worse. It was the same with Fred. He doesn't look a Manchester United player.'\n\nThe Newcastle game came three days after Fred had started against AZ Alkmaar in the Europa League and passed the ball into touch no fewer than four times on the plastic pitch in Den Haag.\n\nUnderstandably, BT Sport experts Michael Owen and Owen Hargreaves were unimpressed. 'He's just a moderate player isn't he?' said Owen. 'That's the bottom line. What can you say?\n\n'We were discussing his best position. I probably think it's a No 6, Owen thinks it's a No 8. Really, once we start arguing about it, he can't do either role that well!'\n\nThree days before that, Fred had come off the bench in a draw at home to Arsenal that left Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville questioning the Brazilian's usefulness.\n\n'He looks like he takes the ball, he's tidy on it but I don't see a goal scorer,' said Neville. 'I don't see a defensive midfield player, I don't see a runner. I'm not quite sure what I see.'\n\nThe former Shakhtar Donestk star has come under-fire from a number of pundits this season\n\nFormer United defender Gary Neville says he is not sure what type of midfielder Fred is\n\nFred took the criticism surprisingly well and has promised to use it to improve his game. 'Some critics are pointless but many can offer me lessons,' he said. 'I like to read what people are saying about my performances. With that, I can try to get better.\n\n'They are within their rights. They've won many titles with this club. We have to shut up and work on the pitch.'\n\nFor now, he remains a prime example of United's profligacy in the transfer market. Only Pogba, Lukaku and Harry Maguire have cost the club more money.\n\nThere's a hope that Fred can yet find his feet in the Premier League. After all, this is a Brazil international who has been tipped to become one of the best midfielders in the world by his former Shakhtar coach Paulo Fonseca, now at Roma. A player who helped United to that stunning Champions League win over Paris Saint-Germain last season and was good enough to attract strong interest from City long before they spent \u00a362m on Rodri in the summer.\n\nHe has kept his spirits up around Carrington and is close to fellow Portuguese speaker Andreas Pereira as well as the Spanish contingent at United.\n\nBut unless Fred can convince Solskjaer that he has what it takes to be a Manchester United player, he is in danger of joining Kleberson and Anderson on the list of Brazilians who have flopped at Old Trafford.", "description": "CHRIS WHEELER: When Ole Gunnar Solskjaer sat down with Fred for a one-on-one chat during the summer, it wasn't the Brazilian's physical attributes that were in question.", "authors": ["Chris Wheeler For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/13/19882660-0-image-a-19_1571400527068.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
