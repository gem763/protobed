A day later, Washington listed the second-year running back as its starter ahead of Sunday\u2019s Week 1 matchup against the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nGuice was among the Redskins\u2019 first-team on Washington\u2019s depth chart \u2014 over veteran running back Adrian Peterson.\n\nGuice, who is coming off a torn ACL, received 11 carries for 44 yards in the preseason. His lone appearance came in Week 3 against the Atlanta Falcons.\n\n\u201cWe drafted him for a reason,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cWe feel like he can be a first-, second- and even a third-down back, if needed. I think the offense, carries-wise, will probably go through him, pretty much.\u201d\n\nThe Redskins plan on still splitting carries between Guice, Peterson and Chris Thompson, but it now sounds like Peterson could have less of a role than initially anticipated.\n\nPeterson, of course, replaced Guice after the LSU product\u2019s injury. The 34-year-old ran for 1,042 yards and seven touchdowns on 251 carries.\n\nPeterson has told reporters throughout the offseason he\u2019ll accept splitting carries with Guice, but he has gotten upset over a diminished role before. Peterson was traded from New Orleans to Arizona in 2017 after he was forced into a lesser role behind Alvin Kamara and Mark Ingram.\n\n\u201cWe feel good about the guys we kept,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cObviously, AP is still here that can run the ball as good as anybody. We\u2019re good at running back.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
