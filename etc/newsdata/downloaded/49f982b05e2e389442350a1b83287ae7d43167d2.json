Located on the Pacific coastline, Tsurigasaki surfing beach draws many surfboarders during the early morning and late afternoon thanks to easy access from the center of the capital. The nearest station is JR Kazusa-Ichinomiya, about an hour by express from Tokyo Station.\n\nBunta Terada, a 13-year-old junior high school student, goes there almost every day in season from his home in neighboring Isumi city. According to the teen surfer, the coast has \"good waves\" for Japan's top competitors to hone their skills.\n\nAbout 600,000 surfers a year visit Ichinomiya, which has a population of 12,000. It hosts an international competition for professional athletes from around the world every year, and has seen a steady rise in its profile.\n\nIn October 2015, the local government worked out a comprehensive town-building strategy centering on \"Surfonomics\" -- or the economic effects of surfing.\n\nIt has created a \"surf street\" along the beach dotted with surf shops and restaurants. An information center that opened in April 2018 rents surfboards and bicycles for people to carry their gear.\n\n\"The Olympics is a significant opportunity for us,\" said Ichinomiya mayor Masaya Mabuchi, 61, who expects to see an increase in the number of foreign surfers. \"I hope we can use the economic effects of surfing to revitalize other industries.\"\n\nHyuga in Miyazaki Prefecture on the southwestern main island of Kyushu has pursued an initiative dubbed \"Relax Surf Town Hyuga\" since December 2016.\n\nBoasting a warm climate, the city has one of the nation's most popular surfing spots. In 2017, the latest year for which figures were available, it attracted more than 300,000 surfers and beachgoers, up from 200,000 in 2012.\n\nIt regularly releases promotional videos on a special website and uploads images of the Hyuga coastline on social media. It is working hard to attract surfing events as it looks to capitalize on surfing's Olympic debut.\n\n\"First of all, we hope people will get to know Hyuga City, seizing on the opportunity created by surfing,\" a city official said.\n\nMakinohara in Shizuoka Prefecture, central Japan, lost out to Ichinomiya in the bid to be selected as the Olympic surfing venue, but it was chosen to host pre-games training for the U.S. and other surfing teams.\n\nThe city on the Pacific coast organizes surfing lessons for elementary school students to familiarize people with the sport from an early age.\n\nAnother spot known for the quality of its waves is Niijima Island. Part of the Izu Islands, Niijima takes about two and a half hours to reach from Tokyo by high-speed jet ferry or 35 minutes by air.\n\nNiijima used to host international surfing competitions and is trying to boost the remote island's economy by wooing back surfers.\n\nThe move appears to be succeeding as the annual domestic surfing competitions and festivals it hosts have led to an increase in the number of people visiting for surfing in recent years.\n\n\"The beautiful ocean is the pride of the island,\" an official said. \"We hope more people will come and enjoy surfing.\"\n\n\u00a9 KYODO", "description": "Surf towns across Japan are looking to ride a wave to economic revitalization ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Games, when surfing makes its Olympic debut.
