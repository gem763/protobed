Clendenin/Los Angeles Times via Contour RA by Getty Images\n\n\u201cI can only show you this \u2019cause you\u2019ve seen the film,\u201d Aaron Paul says, grinning proudly as he scrolls through hundreds \u2014 maybe thousands? \u2014 of photos featuring his 19-month-old daughter, Story. He settles on a short video of the two of them taken during a break in the filming of El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie. The clip finds the actor in full makeup as Jesse Pinkman, the emotionally pulverized, physically lacerated meth-maker. As Paul gently describes to Story the harrowing (and very top-secret) El Camino scene he has just filmed, his daughter gazes at her father\u2019s bruised and grubby face with affection. \u201cShe\u2019s totally fine when she sees Jesse\u2019s scars,\u201d Paul says, putting down his phone. \u201cShe looks past all of that and right into my eyes.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s less than a month before the release of El Camino, and the 40-year-old Paul is sitting on the back terrace of his Los Feliz home, dressed in a beige linen shirt and matching slacks. A red Radio Flyer wagon \u2014 piloted by a lone teddy bear \u2014 is parked nearby at the foot of an immense artificial waterfall that cascades down an entire hillside. The nearly 100-year-old estate has been home to several Hollywood dignitaries over the years \u2014 including Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Jim Parsons, and Twilight-era Robert Pattinson \u2014 and is anchored by a lush, panoramic garden so large Paul is still sorting through every plant. \u201cWhen we moved in,\u201d he says, \u201cthey gave us two binders of information about running this place.\u201d\n\nPaul and his wife, the anti-bullying-nonprofit founder Lauren Parsekian, took over the estate earlier this year, not long after a family trip to New Mexico. That\u2019s where Paul had spent several months covertly reprising the role of Jesse, last seen in Breaking Bad\u2019s 2013 conclusion. In his final onscreen moments, Jesse plows through the gates of a desert compound in a stolen El Camino, sobbing and howling after having escaped not only his Aryan Brotherhood captors but also the emotional clutches of his mentor turned manipulator, Walter White, played by Bryan Cranston.\n\nFor those who\u2019d come to root for Jesse, the send-off felt victorious. But it also left some questions in the balance. Ever since the finale, Paul notes, \u201cpeople always ask, \u2018What happened to Jesse? Is he okay?\u2019 And I\u2019d say, \u2018You know as much as I do.\u2019 \u201d\n\nWritten and directed by Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan, El Camino, which debuts on Netflix on October 11, begins right after the massacre in the show\u2019s finale, which left Walter dead and tipped off police to the vast drug empire Jesse had helped build. The movie is deeply satisfying on its own, featuring all the twists and pivots of a gnarly, on-the-run thriller; but for Breaking Bad devotees, there\u2019s the added emotional investment of having watched (and worried about) Jesse Pinkman for five seasons. El Camino also pairs Paul with several of his former Breaking Bad cronies, though to name them, or to reveal even the haziest plot points, would violate Netflix\u2019s demands of secrecy. Suffice it to say that many of the show\u2019s hallmarks \u2014 revelatory flashbacks, grisly humor, and abrupt violence \u2014 are still very much in effect in El Camino.\n\nStill, it gives away nothing to note that the sole focus of El Camino is Jesse Pinkman, whose heartaches and fears were like psychological open wounds made visible through Paul\u2019s fidgety physicality and sad, searching eyes. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be more opposite of that guy,\u201d notes the actor, \u201cother than the fact that I wear my heart on my sleeve. I don\u2019t bury anything.\u201d That on-the-surface rawness made for one of the more intensely symbiotic performances on television (while also earning Paul a trio of Emmys during Breaking Bad\u2019s run). So much so that, in the years after the show ended, Paul himself wondered what had become of his troubled old friend. \u201cHe was real to me,\u201d the actor says. \u201cI loved Jesse. I cared for him. I wanted him to be okay.\u201d\n\nAaron Paul in El Camino.

Over the next few years, he\u2019d land a series of one-off prime-time roles, playing parts like \u201cFrat Boy No. 2\u201d on an episode of Melrose Place and a Jackass-inspired stunt-doofus on The X-Files. He also tried out a couple of acting classes. \u201cI saw people doing strange exercises that I just didn\u2019t understand,\u201d he says. \u201cIn my head, I\u2019m like, Isn\u2019t the point of acting to believe the situations are happening to you, as that character?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s how he approached Jesse, who was initially conceived as a ding-a-ling poser, one who likely wouldn\u2019t survive the first season. He was spared after producers noted how well Paul and Cranston fit together onscreen. \u201cThey could find the humor and warmth in these two characters who didn\u2019t want to be together,\u201d says Breaking Bad and El Camino producer Melissa Bernstein. \u201cVince immediately knew Jesse was going to be a more meaningful character.\u201d\n\nDuring the show\u2019s early seasons \u2014 before Cranston taught him how to mellow a bit \u2014 Paul treated the role as a 24-hour-a-day assignment. He\u2019d sometimes lurk around Albuquerque late at night, investigating the city\u2019s darker corners in order to understand Jesse\u2019s world and mind-set. (Bernstein, who knew Paul before his Breaking Bad days, didn\u2019t know about his after-hours research. But she has a vivid memory of him on the Bad set one day, \u201cpulling up his hoodie, putting on some music, and doing some intensive pacing, like a fighter preparing for a fight.\u201d) At times, Paul even dreamed as Jesse. \u201dIt sounds odd, but I lived and breathed every moment of his life,\u201d says Paul. \u201cI know him so well it feels like these things happened to me, in a way.\u201d\n\nPeople always ask, \u2018What happened to Jesse? Is he okay?\u2019 And I\u2019d say, \u2018You know as much as I do.\u2019\n\nAs the show\u2019s final episodes neared, Jesse had become increasingly imperiled by Walter\u2019s schemes. Most Breaking Bad fans assumed the character was going to die \u2014 as did Paul, who by then had been playing the character for five years. He wrote a letter to Gilligan, pleading that Jesse go out honorably. \u201cI asked Vince to read it to the entire staff,\u201d Paul says. \u201cI said, \u2018If Jesse\u2019s going to die, can it at least be by his own hands? I beg you: Let him make that decision himself.\u2019 Vince wrote back: \u2018I could never kill the heart of the show.\u2019\u201d By the time Jesse roared out of the neo-Nazi prison, he\u2019d been transformed from swaggering motormouth to wrung-out abuse victim \u2014 and had somehow become the show\u2019s unlikely hero.\n\nIn the years that followed Breaking Bad\u2019s sign-off, \u201cI zipped off that skin and left it behind,\u201d Paul says, \u201cand Jesse stopped visiting me.\u201d The actor didn\u2019t learn about Gilligan\u2019s plans for El Camino until late in 2017, when he was visiting New York City with Parsekian. The couple had met several years earlier at a certain California-desert music festival \u2014 Paul still lists his wife as \u201cLauren Coachella\u201d on his phone \u2014 and had journeyed east so Paul could work on Hulu\u2019s drama The Path. Paul got a call from Gilligan, hoping to discuss the series\u2019 upcoming tenth anniversary. \u201cI was standing outside,\u201d Paul recalls, \u201cand towards the end, Vince said, \u2018I feel like I have an idea about the next chapter of Jesse Pinkman\u2019s journey. What are your thoughts on that?\u2019 \u201d\n\nAt that point, Paul says, \u201cI was in a very good place. We\u2019d just gotten pregnant, which we\u2019d wanted for a long time.\u201d Yet he\u2019d struggled with some of his post\u2013Breaking Bad endeavors, including The Path. The series, which cast Paul as a cult member with creeping doubts about his faith, was released in the wake of the quality-TV coup that shows like Breaking Bad had helped foster. But The Path never found the awards recognition or critical reverence of Paul\u2019s previous drama, and by its third season, the actor was becoming frustrated. \u201cI love everyone on that show,\u201d he says of the series, which was canceled in 2018. \u201cBut story-wise, I don\u2019t know if we knew the direction it was going.\u201d\n\nHe found it hard to leverage his TV success into a film career. \u201cI was so spoiled at the height of Breaking Bad,\u201d he says. \u201cI was being offered everything.\u201d Paul landed his first leading-man role in the race-car drama Need for Speed and worked with Ridley Scott on the swordplay epic Exodus: Gods and Kings, but neither connected with U.S. audiences. He found greater success with supporting roles in indies, including this year\u2019s American Woman, but Hollywood often seemed unwilling to let him be anyone other than Jesse Pinkman: In the Kevin Hart\u2013Dwayne Johnson comedy Central Intelligence, Paul\u2019s character even employs Jesse\u2019s \u201cbitch\u201d catchphrase. When it became clear that he couldn\u2019t sell big studio films on his own, he says, the fallout was immediate: \u201cYou do one commercial film that\u2019s not the success they think it\u2019s going to be, and you\u2019re damned.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s possible, of course, that the traits that make Paul such a transfixing TV presence are too nuanced for the big screen: For all of Jesse\u2019s spaz-outs and \u201cbitch\u201d-snaps, Paul carries much of the character\u2019s pain and (minimal) joy in his face \u2014 the kind of subtle gestures that work best within the intimacy of a prime-time drama. There\u2019s also the fact that Jesse has never actually gone away, since Breaking Bad is effectively in a state of perpetual reruns on Netflix. Television actors \u2014 even those with multiple Emmys \u2014 have always struggled to navigate the gulf between TV and film. That\u2019s all the more difficult when your best-known character is being rediscovered on a daily basis.\n\nEither way, it didn\u2019t help that, according to Paul, he was steered away from one film that would go on to become a \u201cmonster, monster hit\u201d \u2014 he declines to name it \u2014 eventually prompting him to part ways with his longtime manager.\n\n\u201cThere were some big thorns in my side that I had to let go,\u201d he says of the past few years. \u201cMy wife knew all of this was going on, so when I told her what Vince wanted to do, she threw her arms around me. She knew it was an opportunity for me to spread my wings again.\u201d\n\nOver the next several months, Gilligan worked on the script for what would become El Camino, occasionally sending Paul a screenshot of a work-in-progress page. Finally, in early 2018, the actor visited Gilligan\u2019s office, kicked off his shoes, and stretched out on a couch for almost three hours, slowly reading the El Camino script. \u201cWhen I flipped the last page, I just laid there in silence.\u201d From the moment Gilligan had told him about the film, he\u2019d been eager to learn Jesse\u2019s fate. \u201cBut I was also thinking, My God, what is this gonna look like, revisiting this guy?\u201d\n\nHalfway through our discussion of Jesse\u2019s future, Paul heads into his living room and returns with a half-empty bottle of Dos Hombres Mezcal, the liquor brand he co-created with Cranston. The two actors (who still check in with each other every day) were sharing sushi in New York City a few years ago when Cranston suggested they try to find another TV project. \u201cI said, \u2018Dude, it\u2019s way too early,\u2019 \u201d says Paul. \u201cPeople are just going to think of Walt and Jesse.\u201d They settled on Dos Hombres, which was released this summer. The timing worked out perfectly for the new movie. Breaking Bad lovers had become convinced the show\u2019s cast members were involved with some secret project, and the Dos Hombres news became yet another cover for El Camino.\n\nGilligan and the film\u2019s production staff had gone to obsessive lengths to keep production a secret \u2014 adopting code names, shielding locations from view, and even creating shared backstories in case anyone asked why they were in town. Whenever Paul was spotted around Albuquerque, he\u2019d tell inquisitive onlookers that he was there for a \u201clittle passion project\u201d \u2014 which, for the show\u2019s fans, is an apt description of Gilligan\u2019s new film. Rumors of a Breaking Bad sequel have been volleyed online for years now, as the show has never quite left its perch in the popular culture: AMC\u2019s current Better Call Saul has earned Emmy nominations for ex-Bad stars Bob Odenkirk, Jonathan Banks, and Giancarlo Esposito. Breaking Bad remains so familiar that, as recently as last month, the New York Times ran a story with the headline, \u201cVaping Bad: Were 2 Wisconsin Brothers the Walter Whites of THC Oils?\u201d\n\nYet as word of El Camino\u2019s New Mexico shoot leaked last fall \u2014 after local papers noted the existence of a mysterious project named Greenbrier \u2014 there was some concern among the series\u2019 faithful. \u201cThey\u2019re like, \u2018The show was so perfect, why mess with it?,\u2019\u201d notes Paul. When Breaking Bad went off the air six years ago, it was already considered one of the era\u2019s great prime-time dramas: a visually inventive, smartly plotted, sometimes shockingly funny tale of sunbaked moral rot. But in recent years, with many of Breaking Bad\u2019s contemporaries faltering in their later seasons, Gilligan\u2019s series has increasingly found itself at the center of numerous \u201cbest show ever\u201d conversations \u2014 one of the few prestige-era titles to not fuck up its finale.\n\nFor Bernstein, though, there was one very compelling reason to risk reviving a near-perfect show: Jesse Pinkman. \u201cWith Jesse, it felt like we were scratching at something that hadn\u2019t been fully addressed,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was the one story with an immediate fallout. And Vince came to writing this from an honest place: It wasn\u2019t like, \u2018We\u2019re going to pay you 70 zillion dollars to do a spinoff.\u2019 He had something to say, and I didn\u2019t doubt for a minute that it was worthy.\u201d\n\nPaul, who\u2019s in nearly every moment of El Camino, shot his scenes without any rehearsal. He became Jesse Pinkman the same way he had during the show\u2019s original run: by convincing himself that he\u2019d endured everything Jesse had endured \u2014 that their scars were shared. \u201cIt was easy to access those emotions, man,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was all very much still in me, and it was nice to release those feelings again.\u201d\n\nBut El Camino, for all its pulpy propulsiveness, is also a tale of severe trauma, with Jesse\u2019s fragility more on display than ever before. It\u2019s part of a performance that, in many ways, was informed by Paul\u2019s becoming a father. \u201cI look at the world completely differently now,\u201d he says. \u201cHaving my daughter view the world for the first time, and seeing everything as being new, is so eye-opening. I see Jesse as this damaged soul \u2014 as this guy who\u2019s just hurting \u2014 even more now.\u201d Adds Bernstein: \u201cWhen we looked for writers for Breaking Bad, one of the things Vince was really keen on was finding writers who\u2019d lived a life \u2014 they\u2019d seen some highs and some lows and really understood the tapestry. Aaron\u2019s now further on down the road. He\u2019s lived more, so he can bring all of those colors to his performance.\u201d\n\nNot long after the movie wrapped, Paul joined the season-three cast of HBO\u2019s Westworld, which is nearly as guarded as El Camino. (He can\u2019t say anything about his role, though he does admit he finds himself overwhelmed by the show\u2019s elaborate sets: \u201cYou walk on and you\u2019re like, My God, they have a lot of money. Holy shit.\u201d) He\u2019ll also star in Apple\u2019s forthcoming crime series Truth Be Told and has spent the past five years voicing the asexual stoner Todd Chavez on Netflix\u2019s BoJack Horseman. After a few years of attempting film stardom, he\u2019d rather pursue TV than another megamovie. \u201cI can\u2019t live with that pressure on me, nor will I. I\u2019m happy.\u201d\n\nToward the end of our talk, the terrace door opens and Parsekian emerges carrying Story, who\u2019s waking up from her afternoon nap. She soon attaches herself to Paul, who bounces her on his knee. \u201cShe\u2019s in such a daddy phase now,\u201d he says. There are birds circling over the Spanish-style roof and a fountain gurgling nearby, but for now, Story looks right into his eyes.\n\n*A version of this article appears in the September 30, 2019, issue of New York Magazine.
