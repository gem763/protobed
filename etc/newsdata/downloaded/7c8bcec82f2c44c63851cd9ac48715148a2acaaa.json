And I think that those tensions are something we have to live with.\u201d\n\nThe policy sparked controversy this month after Facebook refused to remove a 30-second Trump campaign advertisement accusing former Vice President Joe Biden of pressuring Ukrainian officials to drop an investigation into a company where his son was on the board.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee unsuccessfully petitioned on Facebook to remove the allegedly false ad, which CNN has refused to run.\n\n\u201cThe long journey towards greater progress requires confronting ideas that challenge us,\u201d Zuckerberg said while addressing the crowd at Georgetown University\u2019s Gaston Hall. \u201cI\u2019m here today because I believe we must continue to stand for free expression.\u201d\n\nWhile Facebook has a third-party fact-checking program, political figures are exempt from the process. In September, the company announced it was lifting regulations against posting hate speech for politicians on the grounds that such content is \u201cnewsworthy\u201d when it comes from political figures.\n\n\u201cI know some people will say we should go further. That we are wrong to allow politicians to use our platform to say nasty things or make false claims\u201d said Facebook\u2019s head of policy, Nick Clegg, at the Atlantic Festival in Washington last month. \u201cBut imagine the reverse.\u201d\n\nSubscribe here for our free daily newsletter.\n\nRead the full story at The Hill", "description": "", "authors": ["Kayla Kibbe"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/facebook-logo.jpg?fit=1024%2C683", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
