Accessories like the AirPods have been especially hot, with Apple crediting \u201cphenomenal demand\u201d for the wireless earbuds in its most recent results.\n\nThe iPhone, alas, isn\u2019t doing so hot. Revenue from the iconic smartphone slid 15% from a year earlier for the nine-month period that ended in June. Apple has successfully diversified its business some; iPhone now accounts for 56% of the company\u2019s trailing 12-month revenue compared with 64% three years ago. But the iPhone\u2019s slump still weighs heavy on the company. Apple\u2019s total revenue so far this fiscal year is down 3%\u2014despite gains in all of the company\u2019s other segments.\n\nThe new phones Apple is slated to unveil Tuesday are unlikely to change that. No major new designs are expected, and the company is also unlikely to incorporate 5G technology into its handsets until next year. Analysts don\u2019t expect iPhone sales to resume growth until Apple\u2019s 2021 fiscal year, which would be led by whatever devices the company releases next fall.\n\nThat gives Apple\u2019s supporting cast a much bigger role to play in the year to come. Improvements to the Mac and iPad lines have recently rejuvenated sales in those categories, and the Apple Watch has become a sizable business in its own right after launching five years ago. Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein expects the smartwatch to generate a little over $13 billion in revenue this fiscal year. Apple has updated the Watch at every September product event since its launch.\n\nAirPods, meanwhile, are still hot\u2014even three years after their initial launch. Mr. Sacconaghi estimates that Apple is now close to selling about 10 million units each quarter, which is more than even the iPod managed at the same stage of life. But AirPods also face mounting competition from other wireless buds. Consumer Reports even recently picked Samsung\u2019s new Galaxy Buds as \u201cthe clear winner\u201d in the category the AirPods once owned.\n\nIn fact, Apple now faces tougher competition across all of its categories. The Mac, iPad, Apple Watch and Apple TV must all contend with rival devices from companies who have learned to take a page from Apple\u2019s formidable design chops. The company is still right to lessen its dependence on the iPhone. But it will fight hard for every sale.\n\nWrite to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com", "description": "Inconveniently for Apple, its new iPhones are coming just as everything not named iPhone is doing great.", "authors": ["Dan Gallagher"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105036/social", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
