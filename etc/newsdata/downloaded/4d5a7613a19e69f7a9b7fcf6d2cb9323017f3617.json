Increasingly, it is coming from the government itself.\n\nIn the coming days Bolsonaro is set to unveil draft legislation that would allow commercial mining in indigenous territories, something currently outlawed, despite overwhelming opposition from voters.\n\n\u201cIndians don\u2019t want to be poor landowners living on rich soils \u2013 especially the richest soils on Earth,\u201d Bolsonaro told last month\u2019s UN general assembly, boasting of the gold, diamonds, uranium, niobium and rare earths hidden beneath their reserves.\n\n\u201cNot since the dictatorship have Brazil\u2019s indigenous peoples felt as threatened as they do now,\u201d said Randolfe Rodrigues, a progressive senator from Amap\u00e1, another of the Amazon\u2019s nine states.\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s not just threats. It is concrete facts,\u201d added Rodrigues, highlighting attacks on Amap\u00e1\u2019s Wai\u00e3pi indigenous community and the recent murder of an activist fighting to protect the territory sheltering Brazil\u2019s largest concentration of uncontacted tribes.\n\nF\u00e1tima Cleide, a prominent Workers\u2019 party (PT) politician in Rond\u00f4nia, said indigenous communities stood at a historic and perilous juncture. \u201cThis is a war for survival \u2026 What they want is for the indigenous peoples to disappear.\u201d\n\nBolsonaro allies celebrate his Amazonian blueprint and brand critics foreign conspirators.\n\nMarcos Rocha, Rond\u00f4nia\u2019s Bolsonarista governor, claimed opening supposedly impoverished indigenous communities to mining would bring \u201cdignity\u201d.\n\n\u201cIndians want to grow and to develop, just like any human being. Most other countries have decimated their Indians. We want them to walk alongside us \u2013 because they are Brazilians, just like us,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Bolsonarian congressman Jo\u00e3o Chris\u00f3stomo compared his leader\u2019s plans to the creation of casinos on Native American reservations in the United States. \u201cToday all the Indians there are super-millionaires,\u201d Chris\u00f3stomo claimed, laughing.\n\nBut many fear Bolsonaro\u2019s moves could prove catastrophic for small and already fragile communities such as the 150-strong Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau \u2013 a semi-nomadic, Tupi-speaking group which remained uncontacted until 1981 and whose members were once called the Bocas Pretas (Black Mouths) for their distinctive tattoos made with the juice of the genipap tree.\n\n'He wants to destroy us': Bolsonaro poses gravest threat in decades, Amazon tribes say Read more\n\n\u201cThe government\u2019s attitude towards indigenous people is the same attitude the Portuguese had when they first came to Brazil: to enslave, to colonize and to acculturate \u2013 to destroy their cultures,\u201d claimed Rodrigues.\n\n\u201cBolsonaro is a president who governs with the mindset of a Portuguese mercenary who arrived here in the 16th century.\u201d\n\nThe head of the Indigenous Missionary Council, Roque Paloschi, said his group was not opposed to progress, per se: \u201cBut what kind of progress \u2013 and for whom?\u201d\n\nBrazil\u2019s indigenous peoples \u2013 who numbered upwards of 3.5 million when Portuguese explorers arrived in 1500 \u2013 suffered a wretched start to the 20th century. As outsiders pushed deeper into their traditional homes, illness and violence reduced their total population to as little as 70,000. During the 1970s they faced further pain as the dictatorship bulldozed roads through the Amazon and lured migrants with the slogan \u201ca land without men for men without land\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A bullet-riddled sign warning outsiders off the Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau reserve Photograph: Avener Prado/The Guardian\n\nBut the return of democracy brought hope. Brazil\u2019s 1988 constitution gave indigenous communities the exclusive right to vast areas, and protected reservations such as the 1.9m hectare Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau territory were born. By the turn of the century Brazil\u2019s indigenous population had rebounded to some 350,000.\n\n\u201cUntil Bolsonaro came along it was looking really very good,\u201d said John Hemming, a veteran chronicler of indigenous affairs whose latest book remembers the Villas-B\u00f4as brothers, storied Brazilian explorers and champions of the indigenous cause.\n\n\u201cBrazil can be so, so proud of what it has done,\u201d Hemming added. \u201cBut that is all about to be undone by this creature.\u201d\n\nAmazon's indigenous warriors take on invading loggers and ranchers Read more\n\nHemming claimed the Villas-B\u00f4as brothers \u2013 who helped create Brazil\u2019s most famous indigenous reserve in the Xingu \u2013 would be \u201cturning in their graves\u201d at Bolsonaro\u2019s \u201cterrifying\u201d plans. Claims Bolsonaro\u2019s project would make tycoons of the indigenous were \u201ca Goebbels\u200b\u200b-type lie\u201d.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in despair, like everyone else,\u201d Hemming admitted.\n\nOn the Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau reserve \u2013 and indigenous territories across Brazil \u2013 despair is spurring action.\n\nOn a recent afternoon, two village leaders emerged from the rainforest, carrying rifles and drenched in sweat after a day tracking illegal loggers into the jungle.\n\n\u201cAll we heard was the din of the chainsaw. We didn\u2019t see them,\u201d said one of the pair, 33-year-old Ari Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau, showing off a smartphone video of the scene.\n\nAs he wolfed down a late lunch of peccary and pasta, the second man, Clebeson Tenharim, said he was certain the invasions were accelerating. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like this last year. It has got much worse. They\u2019re really coming into the reserve now,\u201d he said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Clebeson Tenharin after a forest excursion to find invaders: \u2018It wasn\u2019t like this last year. It has got much worse. They\u2019re really coming into the reserve now.\u2019 Photograph: Avener Prado/The Guardian\n\nTenharim had no doubt who was to blame.\n\n\u201cThis Bolsonaro \u2026 all he wants to do is destroy,\u201d the 36-year-old complained, arguing the president\u2019s hostility to indigenous communities was encouraging raiders. \u201cThey think the government\u2019s on their side.\u201d\n\nBut hardwood-looting loggers are no longer the only menace. Tenharim feared Bolsonaro would \u201crent the indigenous land out to foreigners\u201d and wondered who would benefit, apart from mining goliaths from abroad.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to understand our government,\u201d Tenharim sighed. \u201cFirst they make a law giving us the right to the reserve. Then they break it themselves.\u201d\n\nAs he toured Aldeia Nova \u2013 one of six small settlements on the reservation\u2019s eastern flank \u2013 Awapu Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau said he was also perplexed by the government\u2019s designs.\n\n\u201cThey should respect our culture,\u201d the cacique insisted. \u201cWhen the Portuguese arrived we were already here. Everyone who has studied history knows this.\u201d\n\nAt the UN last week Brazil\u2019s president posed as an ally of the indigenous, donning a necklace from the Xingu as proof of his dedication. \u201cBrazil now has a president who cares about those who were here before the arrival of the Portuguese in 1500,\u201d claimed Bolsonaro, whose Italian forefathers migrated to Brazil in the late 19th century.\n\nThousands of miles away in the Amazon few descendants of Brazil\u2019s original inhabitants are convinced by such claims.\n\n\u201c[If Bolsonaro came here] I\u2019d tie him up \u2026 until he abandoned this act he wants to pass,\u201d Tenharim joked.\n\nAwapu was more downbeat as he pondered the future of his ancestral home. \u201cWe feel sad,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know where this will end.\u201d", "description": "Activists say onslaught has intensified as illegal loggers and land-grabbers take the president\u2019s verbal offensive against indigenous communities as a green light to act", "authors": ["Tom Phillips"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b075e9344fe8cf8a864eaff717a6400a5aa056c/0_363_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7961c57e1e4ec9715bf149f918e6e1d0"}
