Taylor said Morrison had been told that Trump insisted Zelensky publicly commit to investigating the 2016 election and the Bidens, and that hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to Ukraine hinged on his willingness to do so.\n\nWorth noting: Morrison's name appeared 15 times in Taylor's opening statement.\n\nMeanwhile, the White House is being stymied in its efforts to prevent current and former officials from complying with the committees' requests, and Morrison appears to be no exception.\n\nMorrison's lawyer told Politico that \"If subpoenaed, Mr. Morrison plans to appear for his deposition.\u201d\n\nTrump, who compared the impeachment inquiry to a \"lynching\" this week, has been extremely frustrated with Democrats' investigation, and he has lashed out at the officials cooperating.\n\nThe president has specifically singled out Taylor \u2014 who was handpicked by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo \u2014 calling him a \"Never Trumper\" and adding that \"Never Trumpers\" are \"human scum.\"\n\nBut three veterans who have served with Taylor defended him in powerful interviews with CNN's Jake Tapper and Kate Sullivan, describing him as a \"man of honor,\" \"public servant\" and \"role model\" who \"represents the best of our Department of State.\"\n\nWhat's next: The following current and former administration officials are also scheduled to testify this week:\n\nTuesday, Oct. 29 at 9:30 am: National Security Council Director for European Affairs Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman.\n\nNational Security Council Director for European Affairs Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman.
