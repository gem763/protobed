REUTERS/Carlos Jasso\n\nThey have known each other long enough to form a bond - but not so long that Castillo has shared all that happened to him before he fled his country last October.\n\nHis intended destination had been the United States, Mexico a mere thoroughfare. But, for now, Mexico City has become his home, and Ruiz, he said with a slight smile, his \u201cadopted\u201d mother.\n\nCastillo, 20, told Reuters he left after local gang members shot him in the leg. He became convinced he was marked for death by the gunmen stalking him at school and on his way home. \u201cI always felt like the whole world was against me, like death was coming for me,\u201d he said.\n\nIt seemed everyone was in a gang \u2013 even his own father, said Castillo, who spoke on condition that only part of his name be used, saying he feared gang retaliation. He joined the October caravan in southern Mexico intending to seek asylum in the United States, where he said he hoped to find safety as well as work to help support his family back home.\n\nBut just south of the U.S. border, in the state of Sonora, a bus he boarded with other migrants flipped over. He was in the hospital for a week with a fractured skull.\n\nRuiz was working with volunteers seeking to support Central American migrants when she received a call from a friend: \u201cThere\u2019s a young boy with a broken head,\u201d she recalled the man saying.\n\nRuiz chipped in to cover some of Castillo\u2019s medical expenses. Castillo sought to thank her and, corresponding across the miles, their friendship deepened. Eventually he was calling or writing almost daily from the border, reporting what he had found to eat or where he would spend the night.\n\nIn December, Ruiz, 46, persuaded Castillo to turn back and move to Mexico City. Now he lives with two Honduran youths in an apartment Ruiz helped them rent, with contributions from a group of mothers she met at her four-year-old daughter\u2019s preschool.\n\n\u201cThe time in Mexico is helping me a lot,\u201d said Castillo, who is slim with wavy brown hair and a gap-toothed grin.\n\nThe moms had banded together before to support victims of a powerful 2017 earthquake in Mexico. Then last year, Ruiz, who frequently travels to southern Mexico for her research on Guatemalan refugees, noticed the growing stream of families marching north.\n\n\u201cI began to speak with the mothers in the preschool: We have to do something to help,\u201d Ruiz said.\n\n(For an interactive version see tmsnrt.rs/2VssPY7)\n\nIn his first weeks in the capital, Ruiz recalled, Castillo would get into minor altercations on the metro, responding with the defensive instincts he needed for survival in Honduras.\n\n\u201cDaniel still carried the violence within him,\u201d Ruiz said. \u201cDaniel thinks differently now.\u201d\n\nRuiz asked Castillo about the scar on his arm. At first, Castillo said only that he fell. Later, he explained he was fleeing gang members.\n\nThat was his old life, one he can\u2019t forget but isn\u2019t eager to revisit. Castillo said he is much calmer now, a thousand miles north. He has settled into a new routine, studying and working occasionally to send money back to his family.\n\nHe has not abandoned his dreams of an American life. But his departure date is receding as his roots in Mexico deepen.\n\n\u201cI know that it would be hard for me to find there what I have found here,\u201d Castillo said.", "description": "Over breakfast on a recent Sunday, Veronica Ruiz Lagier, a Mexican anthropologist, eyed a scar snaking around the elbow of Daniel Castillo, a young Honduran she has befriended.", "authors": ["Julia Love", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439230698&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF990W5", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
