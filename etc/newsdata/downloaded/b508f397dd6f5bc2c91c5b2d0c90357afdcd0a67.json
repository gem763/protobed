We are sure that Washington has sufficient leverage to mediate a sustainable peace between us and Turkey.\"\n\nOn Sunday Turkish forces and their proxies pushed deeper into Syria, on the fifth day of the offensive, as Washington announced it was withdrawing its 1,000 troops from the country's north.\n\n\"In light of the invasion by Turkey and the existential threat its attack poses for our people, we may have to reconsider our alliances,\" he said.\n\nMr Abdi said Syria's government and their Russian allies \"have made proposals that could save the lives of millions of people who live under our protection.\n\n\"We do not trust their promises. To be honest, it is hard to know whom to trust,\" he said.\n\nBut he said that if the Kurds were forced to choose between \"compromise and the genocide of our people, we will surely choose life for our people\".\n\nDamascus, which has accused the Kurds of treason over their alliance with Washington, rejects their self-rule and wants central government institutions restored in Kurdish-held areas, especially in the oil-rich east.\n\nAccording to the Rami Abdel Rahman, head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor, the Kurdish administration and the SDF \"made compromises to Syria in order to stop the advance of the Turkish forces in the north\".\n\nIn Sunday's statement, the Kurdish administration said the deal struck with Damascus \"paves the way to liberate the rest of the Syrian cities occupied by the Turkish army such as Afrin\", a majority Kurdish enclave in the northwest.\n\nTurkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the aim of the operation - which has sparked an international outcry - was to establish a \"security zone\" that would extend 30km to 35km into Syria and run from Kobane to Hasakeh - a stretch of 440km.\n\nSince it was launched on Wednesday, the Turkish offensive has killed dozens of civilians and fighters and forced tens of thousand of Syrians to flee their homes.\n\nAFP", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [BEIRUT] The Kurdish administration in northern Syria on Sunday announced a deal with the Damascus government on a Syrian troop deployment near the border with Turkey to confront Ankara's offensive. .
