It prompted a letter from the FAA administrator, Steve Dickson, to Boeing\u2019s chief executive, Dennis Muilenburg, demanding an \u201cimmediate\u201d explanation for the delay in turning over the documents.\n\nA person briefed on the matter said Boeing failed to turn over the documents to the FAA for four months and that the justice department is also in possession of the messages.\n\nThe Boeing internal messages raised questions about the performance of the so-called MCAS anti-stall system that has been tied to the two fatal crashes in five months.\n\nThe messages are between the Max\u2019s then chief technical pilot, Mark Forkner, and another Boeing pilot, the sources said, and raised questions about the MCAS\u2019s performance in the simulator in which he said it was \u201crunning rampant\u201d.\n\nForkner has since left Boeing. The Seattle Times reported in September that Forkner repeatedly invoked his fifth amendment right to not turn over documents subpoenaed by the justice department.\n\nBoeing said in a statement the company \u201cbrought to the committee\u2019s attention a document containing statements by a former Boeing employee\u201d.\n\nForkner said in one text message, \u201cI basically lied to the regulators (unknowingly).\u201d The other employee responded that \u201cit wasn\u2019t a lie, no one told us that was the case\u201d of an issue with MCAS.\n\nForkner responded soon after: \u201cGranted I suck at flying, but even this was egregious.\u201d\n\nThe FAA plans to turn over more communications from Forkner to Congress later on Friday, sources said.\n\nBoeing is revising the 737 Max software to add more safeguards and require the MCAS system to receive input from two key sensors.\n\nThe FAA reiterated that it is \u201cfollowing a thorough process, not a prescribed timeline, for returning the Boeing 737 Max to passenger service. The agency will lift the grounding order only after we have determined the aircraft is safe.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, Southwest Airlines delayed the return of the plane to its flight schedule until February.", "description": "Boeing failed to turn over documents about MCAS program, linked to two fatal crashes of 737 Max airliners, to the FAA for four months", "authors": ["Guardian Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad15aad956173d46972eb94bc475ae419eb0e270/0_248_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=752cc30890c5d947768ce93544aa56ff", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
