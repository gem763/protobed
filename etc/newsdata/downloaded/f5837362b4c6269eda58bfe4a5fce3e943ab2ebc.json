But if all The Highwomen were doing was femme-ing up butch tropes, their self-titled debut wouldn\u2019t be such a triumph. Morris is a rising superstar of rare nuance; Carlile is a literary-spirited outsider with a fierce wail; Shires uses Dolly Parton inflections for sneakily devastating narratives; Hemby, the least known of the members, has written five No. 1 country singles. All are nimble singers and songwriters who understand the trick Webb pulled with the astronaut\u2014doing something not only new but also a bit weird, while making it sound classic.\n\nThat \u201cclassic\u201d sound owes to a true team effort. The four main women sometimes share and sometimes trade off songwriting and singing duties; there are arms-around-shoulder gang singalongs and delicate solo interludes. In either case, they\u2019re backed by an ace band and guided by the star Nashville producer Dave Cobb. Contributions come from the alt-country mainstay Jason Isbell (Shires\u2019s husband) and guest vocalists, including Sheryl Crow. Polished and lush, throwback-y but not anachronistic, and packed with well-drawn melodies, the album dares country-radio programmers to continue their notorious habit of downplaying female talent. Moreover, the songs mostly avoid the dreary stereotypes of protest music.\n\nWhich isn\u2019t to say that pink-hatted protesters shouldn\u2019t scour the lyrics for sign-making inspiration. Take these rah-rah updates of domestic clich\u00e9s from the statement-of-purpose single \u201cRedesigning Women\u201d: \u201cPulling up the floors and changing out the curtains / Some of us are saints and some of us are surgeons / Made in God\u2019s image, just a better version.\u201d If these are bumper stickers in waiting, they\u2019re also chewy singalong lyrics over a honeyed, mid-tempo groove. You can tell the four women are having fun in the first verse as they pass the mic between one another like it\u2019s the medicine ball in a gym warm-up.\n\nWhen The Highwomen take on personal matters\u2014with the anti-sexism social meaning only implied\u2014they\u2019re equally memorable. Morris\u2019s \u201cOld Soul\u201d hits upon a fabulously specific idea that tweaks the frontiersman image: It\u2019s the confession of someone who\u2019s had to be a strong and silent provider wishing they could have lived a wilder life. Another Morris-led banger, the catchy and fiddle-laden \u201cLoose Change,\u201d uses simple and deft metaphors around money to deliver a kiss-off. \u201cIf She Ever Leaves Me\u201d has Carlile serenading a hard-to-get woman, and what\u2019s remarkable is not only the queer desire, but also the way it recasts the clich\u00e9 of the heartbreaker at the honky-tonk. These are subversions, but they are also good country songs in the traditional way, taking a piece of the heartland\u2019s conceptual furniture and tipping it only slightly askew.", "description": "The supergroup puts a feminist spin on familiar traditions while still maintaining a classic feel.", "authors": ["Spencer Kornhaber"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/the_highwomen2/facebook.jpg?1567806327", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
