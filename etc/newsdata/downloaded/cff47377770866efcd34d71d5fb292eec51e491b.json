However, this was because iSignthis was not offering financial services at the time of introduction, in 2016.\n\n\"Therefore, Tradologic was not ever offered any financial services, so formal customer due diligence was not applicable.\"\n\nAlso, it derived no revenue from Tradologic or any Tradologic-introduced client in the June half of 2018.\n\n\"The Tradologic platform integration took multiple months to conclude (into second quarter of 2017) by which time binary options were beginning to fall out of favour with regulators per the July 2016 warnings on binaries and leading up to the 29 July 2017 review,\" iSignthis explained.\n\nSeparately, iSignthis expanded on a previous explanation for its banking relationship with KAB, or K\u00f8benhavns Andelskasse, which was a Danish co-op bank shut down by regulators and subsequently investigated for breach of anti-money laundering laws.\n\niSignthis was \"not in a position to attract interest from larger banking entities as its revenues were modest at that stage\" and \"KAB was prepared to move swiftly in order to secure the company\u2019s business\".\n\nThe company only became aware of the issues at KAB to a limited extent on September 16, 2018, iSignthis said, in response to a question about why it only disclosed supply chain issues to the market on September 26, 2018.\n\nAdvertisement\n\niSignthis also confirmed it has no details of the 26 suspicious activity alerts which The Australian Financial Review reported were triggered by payments in and out of the KAB bank account of iSignthis in June and July of 2018.\n\n\"Even if they did exist, [iSignthis] has not received any notice from any government agency regarding the matter,\" the company said.\n\nThe timing of the KAB transactions coincided with escalating revenue hurdles linked to the issue of performance shares.\n\niSignthis, which has soared to a $1 billion valuation on account of its rapid revenue growth, has been suspended from trading for nearly a month as regulators probe the customer authentication and payments firm.\n\nLast week, chief executive John Karantzis fronted clients of Goldman Sachs' technology conference and said neither management nor the board were concerned by any of the regulatory queries so far received.", "description": "iSignthis has revealed the extent of historical revenue coming from online foreign exchange and contracts for difference providers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6637%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_104%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/78f8715d138badeedaad57ab640a475ee415602b", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
