And he\u2019s said that the president did nothing wrong when he asked Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate Democrat Joe Biden and his son Hunter on a July 25 phone call.\n\nThe secretary has been 4,000 miles away in southern Europe this week, but his defense of Trump and attacks on Democrats in Congress resonate both in the Oval Office and in Kansas, where Pompeo is weighing a Senate run in 2020. While the impeachment crisis could bruise his political standing -- forcing him to choose between the president and defending his department\u2019s career diplomats and appointees -- breaking with Trump now would probably be political suicide.\n\n\u201cPompeo\u2019s career play is to remain as close as humanly possible to the president and, in a ruby-red place like Kansas, the president\u2019s endorsement will seal the seat,\u201d said Christopher Preble, vice president of defense and foreign policy studies at the Washington-based Cato Institute.\n\nYet that strategy has risks: While Kansas hasn\u2019t elected a Democratic senator since 1932, voters there picked a Democratic governor in 2018. The Democratic share of the state\u2019s registered voters has climbed gradually to more than 25%. And Pompeo may be unable to escape blame -- and possible legal repercussions -- if the president is eventually impeached.\n\nListened to Call\n\nEven from Italy, where he visited his family\u2019s ancestral home, Pompeo has been in the thick of the impeachment debate back in Washington. In Rome on Wednesday, Pompeo said publicly for the first time that he listened in during Trump\u2019s July 25 call. Earlier in the week, he spurned demands for officials to testify to House committees this week as \u201cunfeasible\u201d and said Democrats were trying to \u201cintimidate, bully, & treat improperly the distinguished professionals of the Department of State.\u201d\n\nAfter three years working to earn a place in Trump\u2019s innermost circle -- first as CIA director and now as secretary of state -- Pompeo\u2019s fate is intertwined with the president whose candidacy he opposed during the 2016 Republican primaries. Testimony and additional documents expected to emerge as the impeachment inquiry expands will make it hard for the top U.S. diplomat to stay out of the fray.\n\n\u201cHow do you prepare for information that may be out there that hasn\u2019t been released?\u201d said said Jeremi Suri, a professor of public affairs and history at the University of Texas in Austin.\n\nDespite Pompeo\u2019s resistance to congressional demands for diplomats to testify, Kurt Volker, Pompeo\u2019s former special envoy to Ukraine and a prominent donor to Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, appeared behind closed doors on Capitol Hill throughout the day on Thursday.\n\nVolker shared documents showing U.S. diplomats exchanged text messages arguing about whether Trump improperly demanded that Ukraine investigate Biden and his son in exchange for military aid the administration had held up.\n\n\u201cAs I said on the phone, I think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d Bill Taylor, the U.S. charge d\u2019affairs in Kyiv, said in a text in September to Volker and Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union. Sondland -- who contributed $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration committee, according to the Center for Responsive Politics -- answered that the president \u201chas been crystal clear: no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind.\u201d\n\nAt one point, Sondland told Taylor he should talk to Pompeo if had objections, an indication that the secretary of state was aware of the maneuvers.\n\nIn addition, in August Sondland and Volker discussed a proposed statement for Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that would have committed his government to pursue issues involving Biden as well as Trump\u2019s suspicion that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election to help Democrat Hillary Clinton, according to excerpts released by House Democrats late Thursday. In return, the officials dangled the promise of a firm date for Zelenskiy to visit Trump in the White House.
