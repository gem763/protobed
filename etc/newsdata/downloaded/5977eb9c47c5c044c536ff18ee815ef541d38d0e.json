His Air Force buddies flew the MAX. He would never put himself, his friends or any passenger in an unsafe plane,' Forkner's attorney David Gerger told the Wall Street Journal.\n\nHowever, it was uncovered that Forkner, who started at Boeing in 2011, and fellow technical pilot Patrik Gustavsson complained about the new automated system known as MCAS during simulated flights in 2016 messages.\n\nIn one message Forkner writes, 'Granted, I suck at flying, but even this was egregious.'\n\nHe then writes, in reference to the FAA being in the process of certifying the 737 MAX as safe to carry passengers: 'So I basically lied to the regulators (unknowingly).'\n\nAn anonymous pilot said Forkner repeatedly indicated that he feared losing his job if the FAA rejected Boeing\u2019s arguments to minimize training.\n\nThe 737 Max jets were grounded in March following two horrific crashes that killed 346 people. The Ethiopian Airlines crash wreckage pictured above on March 12 in Bishoftu, Ethiopia\n\nHowever, Boeing in a statement backed away from the latest controversy, saying text messages between the pilots have been misinterpreted and it was 'unfortunate' that they were released without 'meaningful explanation'.\n\nWhen messages with Forkner and another pilot were obtained, Southwest Airlines Pilots Association President Jon Weaks said it showed 'Boeing misled pilots, government regulators and other aviation experts about the safety of the 737 MAX.'\n\nSince July 2018, Forkner has been a technical adviser for Southwest Airlines, his LinkedIn page shows.\n\nBoeing said messages between pilots about problems with MAX planes during testing have been misinterpreted and and it was 'unfortunate' that they were released without 'meaningful explanation'\n\nOne of Forkner\u2019s main responsibilities at Boeing was to make sure airlines purchasing the MAX wouldn\u2019t have to pull pilots off moneymaking passenger flights for additional training, the Wall Street Journal said.\n\nThe crisis now goes deeper than the crashes that killed 346 people in Ethiopia and Indonesia.\n\nThe Justice Department probe is examining how the MAX was designed and certified as safe by the FAA and, equally as important, whether Boeing officials may have misled regulators as part of that process.\n\nThe MAX aircraft remain grounded as answers are sought. Southwest has them on the tarmac until at least early February.\n\nBoeing feeling the heat, removed Kevin McAllister as head of its commercial airplanes unit, making him the highest-profile departure from the company since the MAX ordeal.", "description": "Mark Forkner, Boeing's former chief technical pilot, told co-workers that he was concerned for the MAX planes after issues with the simulator.
