The non-binary emojis even extend to fantastical creatures such as merpeople, fae, and vampires.\n\nThe addition comes after Google offered Android users their own non-binary emojis in May.\n\nMany in the LGBTQ community are celebrating the new additions, which expand on the inclusivity and diversity of the emoji library. In 2015, Apple released increased skin tone options for its human emojis.\n\nBut some are critical of the non-binary emojis for reinforcing a fixed idea of what gender-nonconforming people \u201clook\u201d like.\n\ns*nya (@lavenderblunt) I feel very critical of this bc i feel like it reinforces the idea that nonbinary/gnc people should have a particular look ? Like how do u determine that these emojis are how gender-neutrality should be represented or that these emojis even represent most gnc people https://t.co/S0zyDMXliU\n\nGender inclusivity has become a new focus for brands and companies. The dating app Tinder recently allowed users to display their sexual and gender identities. Last year, fast-fashion giant H&M launched a gender-neutral fashion collection. And Mattel, the maker of Barbie and G.I. Joe, released a line of gender-neutral dolls last month.\n\nThe new iOS 13.2 update also includes emojis that represent people who use wheelchairs, walking cane, hearing aids, and mechanical arms and legs.\n\nHowever, there are still improvements to be made. There are only five skin tones to choose from when it comes to human emojis. And some have criticized programmers for only allowing \u201craceless\u201d (what many call the default yellow skin tone of Apple\u2019s emojis) options for partner pairings and families.\n\nThere are some unexpected, highly specific new emojis as well, including a snorkel, a yo-yo, a banjo, and a juice box.\n\nAccording to Emojipedia, the \u201cWikipedia\u201d of emojis, there are now 3,178 emojis. In 2010, there were 625.\n\n", "description": "While celebrated, some in the LGBTQ community say it reinforces a fixed idea of what gender-neutral people should look like", "authors": ["Andr\u00e9 Wheeler"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12bdecb6f37060aa3176c603f3815015cdfe98f8/0_97_842_505/master/842.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0bf22be66bc81a1efaabc20d86ed00bb", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
