(Al Drago/Reuters)\n\nA new audio recording obtained by NR reveals that Schumer has put his thumb on the scale for candidates willing to follow his fundraising-first approach.\n\nSenate minority leader Chuck Schumer has taken a heavy-handed, top-down approach to selecting Democrats to challenge vulnerable Senate Republicans this cycle, putting his thumb on the scale for candidates willing to shun grassroots outreach in favor of a smile-and-dial, fundraising-first approach, according to an audio recording obtained exclusively by National Review.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the recording, taken during a September 26 talk at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, North Carolina state senator Jeff Jackson describes the experience of courting Schumer while he was considering running for the Democratic nomination to challenge the state\u2019s incumbent Republican senator, Thom Tillis, in 2020.\n\nJackson had grand ambitions: When he flew to Washington to meet with Schumer earlier this year, he told the minority leader that he was going to do \u201c100 town halls in 100 days\u201d and talk to as many North Carolinians as possible to get a feel for the electorate\u2019s priorities. But Schumer, who had previously dispatched his staff to meet with Jackson at his home, had other plans.\n\n\u201cWrong answer,\u201d Schumer said when confronted with Jackson\u2019s grassroots strategy, according to the account of their conversation Jackson gave at UNC Charlotte. \u201cWe want you to spend the next 16 months in a windowless basement raising money and then we\u2019re going to spend 80 percent of it on negative ads about Tillis.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJackson explained that, while he didn\u2019t technically require Schumer\u2019s support to run, the minority leader\u2019s control over the funds disbursed by major donors and the Senate Democrats\u2019 campaign arm, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC), made running without his support an impossibility.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo, did I need his permission to run for that race? No,\u201d Jackson said during his address at UNC Charlotte. \u201cBut talking to my family and seeing the opportunity we have \u2014 sort of the obligation we have to try and take the majority to end gerrymandering in 2020 \u2014 and realizing that I probably wasn\u2019t going to have the support of this group, which is important financially because I ain\u2019t rich . . . I mean, they kind of tipped the scales in favor of not running.\u201d\n\nAnd if the lack of funding wasn\u2019t enough, Jackson said he was turned off by Schumer\u2019s insistence on running an entirely negative campaign against the incumbent, Tillis \u2014 a preference that Jackson attributed to \u201cartistic differences\u201d between himself and the minority leader during his UNC talk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead of Jackson, Schumer and national Democrats are throwing their considerable support behind Cal Cunningham, a former state legislator and Army veteran who, in apparent accordance with Schumer\u2019s wishes, has given just three interviews since announcing his candidacy in June. Reached for comment, Cunningham\u2019s spokesman denied that the candidate has eschewed public appearances and grassroots activism in favor of fundraising.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cCal is proud to have earned support from across the state, including dozens of North Carolina elected officials and community leaders, and the more than 4,000 North Carolinians who contributed to the campaign in the third quarter because they are excited about Cal\u2019s experience as a veteran who prosecuted corruption, and they trust him to represent them in the U.S. Senate where he\u2019ll fight for their jobs, their health care, and our climate,\u201d the spokesman said.\n\nA copy of Cunningham\u2019s campaign schedule obtained by National Review lists 18 appearances at various barbecues, galas, and church services from August 10 to September 29. During his remarks at UNC, Jackson dismissed these appearances as meaningless window-dressing compared to the town halls he\u2019d planned for his own campaign.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Jackson said when asked if Cunningham has been in \u201ca windowless basement\u201d since announcing his candidacy. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t held a public event. He didn\u2019t have a kickoff. This is like month three. He goes to Democratic-party events if you follow him, right \u2014 places where they\u2019re going to say, \u2018And everybody, Cal Cunningham is here!\u2019 And he gets to be like, \u2018Hey!\u2019\u201d (Jackson did not respond to a request for comment, but announced his endorsement of Cunningham hours after he was contacted and learned of the existence of the audio recording.)\n\nAs RealClearPolitics reporter Susan Crabtree noted in August, Cunningham appears to be benefiting from his adherence to Schumer\u2019s \u201cwindowless-basement strategy\u201d:\n\nDuring the second fundraising quarter, just before he entered the contest, Cunningham received $152,000 from New York donors \u2014 nearly 35% of his itemized contributions for that period, according to federal election records. Every one of those 55 donations were made during the last week of the quarter and 51 donors maxed out their contributions of $2,800 to Cunningham. All but two of them have donated to Schumer, ponying up a total of $675,000 to him over the course of his political career, the records show.\n\nCunningham\u2019s chief primary rival, state senator Erica Smith, who announced her candidacy roughly five months before him, has already taken note of the national party\u2019s intrusion in the race.\n\n\u201cThe special interest groups and big, wealthy donors out of New York are trying to buy this Senate seat, and it\u2019s just shameful and it is embarrassing,\u201d she told Crabtree. \u201cI just worry about the people I serve in North Carolina. We don\u2019t have the same demographics as New York, and this Senate seat is not for sale.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReached by phone, Smith lashed out at Schumer and the DSCC for being dishonest about their support for Cunningham, telling National Review that Schumer\u2019s public and private stances on candidates were \u201cdiametrically opposed.\u201d She claimed that shortly before she learned Cunningham was fundraising off of the DSCC\u2019s email list, Schumer had assured her that he had not endorsed any particular candidate and would remain agnostic for the time being.\n\nSmith has also pointed out that, in addition to avoiding public appearances, Cunningham appears to be avoiding public-policy commitments altogether. The only information or interactive features on his website concern donations.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t find his policy positions either,\u201d Smith tweeted in August in response to a message one constituent wrote about the difficulty she\u2019s had in identifying where Cunningham stands on any policy she cares about.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe same pattern, in which Democratic leadership handpicks a preferred candidate to run against a vulnerable Senate Republican, is also playing out in Maine and Iowa.\n\nIn Maine, incumbent Republican senator Susan Collins is sure to face a tough reelection amid the liberal backlash to her support for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation. Schumer and the DSCC have made clear that their preferred candidate is state House speaker Sarah Gideon. Like Cunningham, Gideon has carefully avoided the spotlight and policy commitments. And like Cunningham, she\u2019s benefited from her deference to Washington: She raised more than $1 million in the first ten days after she announced her candidacy in June, and she\u2019s reaped the high-profile endorsements that follow from being taken under Schumer\u2019s wing.\n\nLike Cunningham\u2019s opponent, Smith, Gideon\u2019s opponent, Betsy Sweet, has taken notice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAn open letter to Democratic leadership,\u201d reads an August fundraising email from Sweet\u2019s campaign. \u201cHow many times. How many times are you going to interfere with primary races by picking an opponent before the people do?\u201d\n\nIn Iowa, it\u2019s Theresa Greenfield, a real-estate-development executive and first-time candidate, who has been chosen to follow the Schumer playbook. The DSCC endorsed Greenfield just three days after she announced her candidacy in June, shunning J. D. Scholten, who vaulted to national acclaim last year after nearly beating the racist Republican representative Steve King in the state\u2019s fifth district.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need a primary,\u201d Schumer reportedly told Scholten on a phone call at the end of May.\n\nSchumer\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment by press time.", "description": "Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has put his thumb on the scale for Democratic Senate candidates willing to shun grassroots outreach in favor of a quiet, fundraising-first approach.", "authors": ["Jack Crowe", "Andrew C.
