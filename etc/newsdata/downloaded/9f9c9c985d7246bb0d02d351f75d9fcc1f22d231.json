If MPs reject it, it will trigger renewed calls for a general election.\n\nLabour has described the whole exercise as a political \"stunt\" while the Lib Dems said Mr Johnson couldn't deliver on his promises as Brexit would make the UK poorer.\n\nDespite continuing Brexit uncertainty, the government has said it is determined to press ahead with its plans, announcing its intention to hold a Budget on 6 November.\n\nNegotiations over the UK's departure from the EU continue, with the UK trying to secure an agreement that will enable the UK to leave by 31 October.\n\nThe government says if it can strike a deal with the EU, it will introduce a withdrawal agreement bill and aim to secure its passage through Parliament before the Halloween deadline, although intensive talks over the weekend failed to produce a breakthrough.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The Queen was accompanied by the Prince of Wales\n\nImage copyright PA Media Image caption The origins of the current State Opening date back to the 1850s\n\nImage copyright PA Media Image caption The prime minister's partner, Carrie Symonds, is among those in the audience\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Labour described the Queen's Speech as a \"party political broadcast\"\n\nThe Queen's Speech is famous for its pageantry - with the monarch arriving at the Palace of Westminster in a carriage procession and delivering her speech from the throne in the House of Lords, flanked by the Prince of Wales.\n\nMr Johnson, whose government took office in July, said it was focused on \"seizing the opportunities that Brexit present\".\n\nThe 26 bills include:\n\nSeven pieces of Brexit-related legislation, including measures to establish new regulatory frameworks for fishing, farming, trade and financial services, and a bill to end freedom of movement and bring in a points-based immigration system from 2021.\n\nSeven criminal justice bills, including measures to ensure the most serious offenders serve \"longer in custody\", tougher penalties for foreign national offenders who try to return to the UK after being deported, and greater protection for police officers. Domestic violence legislation will also be carried over from the last session.\n\nPlans for an independent NHS investigations body with legal powers - the Health Service Safety Investigations Body (HSSIB) - to look into \"serious healthcare incidents\", and a pledge to update the Mental Health Act to reduce the number of detentions.\n\nAn environment bill to \"enshrine principles in law\" and set legally binding \"improvement targets\" to reduce plastics, cut air pollution, restore biodiversity and improve water quality. A separate animal welfare bill to outlaw trophy hunting.\n\nProposed reforms to the divorce laws to minimise the impact of family breakdown on children, and changes in employment law to give waiting staff a fairer share of tips.\n\nThere is also a commitment to reform adult social care in England, although no legislation.\n\nNew measures will also be brought forward to tackle electoral fraud, including requiring people to show an approved form of ID before voting in general and local elections.\n\nA shake-up of the rail franchising system in England is also being proposed to improve service reliability, reduce \"fragmentation\" and introduce a \"greater distance\" between ministers and the day-to-day running of the network.\n\n'Election manifesto'\n\nMr Johnson said the programme, which includes four bills carried over from the last session, demonstrated Brexit was not the limit of the government's ambitions.\n\n\"The people of this country don't just want us to sort out Brexit,\" he said. \"This optimistic and ambitious Queen's Speech sets us on a course to make all that happen, and more besides.\"\n\nBut Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said it was a waste of time.\n\n\"Having a Queen's Speech and a State Opening of Parliament is ludicrous,\" he said. \"What we have got in effect is a party political broadcast from the steps of the throne.\"\n\nThe SNP's Joanna Cherry said it was \"an election manifesto for the Conservative Party, which will almost certainly be rejected in Scotland\".\n\nFormer Tory cabinet minister Dominic Grieve, who now sits as an independent after rebelling over Brexit, said the PM would find it \"very difficult\" to govern until Brexit was resolved.\n\nThat was a very long shopping list of things, but the unsaid reality, of course, is that the biggest question hanging over it all is Brexit.\n\nThe Queen may have said with certainty in her opening lines that the UK will be leaving on 31 October, but there's no way anyone in this square mile can be sure that happens. Whether it happens - and how it happens - is a much bigger influence than anything we've just heard being said.\n\nIn many ways, it's a Queen's Speech from a parallel universe - one in which Boris Johnson gets his way. Where he definitely gets his deal with Brussels by the end of this week, he definitely gets it through Parliament on Saturday and definitely gets all the Brexit legislation passed. It's also a world in which he definitely gets the general election he wants in the next few weeks and then definitely gets a Conservative majority.\n\nWe shouldn't dismiss this speech - it does mean something, but what it means is this is what we are likely to see as the basis for a Conservative manifesto whenever that election does come.", "description": "Crime and health take centre stage, but opposition parties dismiss the programme as \"election manifesto\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07r075h.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
