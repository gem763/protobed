The Issaquah, WA-based company has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 6%. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.3%. Let\u2019s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is $2.54, suggesting growth of roughly 7.6% from the year-ago quarter. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has advanced by a penny in the past 30 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues currently stands at $47,258 million, indicating an improvement of 6.4% from the year-ago reported figure.\n\nFactors Influencing Costco\u2019s Performance\n\nCostco continues to be one of the dominant retail wholesalers based on the breadth and quality of merchandise offered. In fact, the company\u2019s strategy to sell products at heavily discounted prices has helped it to remain on growth track. We believe that the company\u2019s growth strategies, sturdy comparable sales (comps) performance and strong membership trends are likely to fuel the top line in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nNotably, comps for the month of August rose 5.5%, following an increase of 5.6%, 5.4% and 4.2% in July, June, and May, respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for comps indicates growth of 5.2% in the third quarter.\n\nCostco has been able to create a niche for itself on the back of growth strategies, better price management, strong membership trends and increasing penetration of e-commerce business. A differentiated product range enables the company to provide an upscale shopping experience, resulting in market share gains and higher sales per square foot.\n\nThe company is fast adopting the omni-channel mantra to provide a seamless shopping experience, whether online or in-stores. It is steadily expanding e-commerce capabilities in the United States, Canada, the U.K., Mexico, Korea and Taiwan. E-commerce comparable sales surged 23.9% in the month of August, following an increase of 21.3%, 15.7%, 20.2% in the months of July, June and May, respectively.\n\nCertainly, the decent performance indicates that the company\u2019s growth efforts have been fueling traffic across both the online and brick-and-mortar platforms. However, analysts pointed that any incremental investments or aggressive pricing strategy may weigh on margins. Moreover, rising SG&A expenses and stiff competition also remain concerns.\n\nCostco Wholesale Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nCostco Wholesale Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise More\n\nCostco Wholesale Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Costco Wholesale Corporation Quote\n\nWhat the Zacks Model Unveils?\n\nOur proven model shows that Costco is likely to beat estimates this quarter.
