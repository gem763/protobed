(Alliance of Nurses for Healthy Environments)\n\nAmong nurses, says Erica Jones, there is an unspoken rule to \u201cstay in your lane.\u201d\n\nAs a nursing student a decade ago, Jones heard warnings from professors not to \u201cbe political\u201d and to focus on caregiving. She said she took the advice seriously. It will continue to be at the forefront of her mind Monday, when she and dozens of other nurses administer blood pressure tests on the streets of downtown Washington, joining hundreds of activists planning to \u201cShut Down DC\u201d in the name of climate justice.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little scary, for sure,\u201d said Jones, 31, who works in the burn and trauma unit at the MedStar Washington Hospital Center in Northwest Washington and has not participated in political action of this sort before. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard with climate change. It\u2019s harder and harder to avoid taking a stand.\u201d\n\nNurses like Jones are mobilizing in growing numbers, joining a movement led in large part by youth activists.\n\nApart from students and scientists, organizers say, health-care workers \u2014 specifically, nurses \u2014 are anticipated to have the strongest presence at major climate rallies being held nationwide over the next few days. In addition to joining the action Monday, several hundred nurses are expected to attend protests today in New York and Washington.\n\nSome say they are driven to act by what they see in their clinics; others, by brushes with climate disaster or medical mission trips. Those interviewed this week said they have carefully weighed their decisions to join the picket line.\n\nNursing was ranked in Gallup\u2019s annual ethics survey as the most trusted profession in the country for 17 consecutive years. It is a reputation they know could be at risk in certain communities if they openly support efforts to address climate change.\n\nBut advocates say this reputation also places nurses in a unique position to drive the climate movement forward.\n\n\u201cThey are incredibly credible voices that span all political spectrums,\u201d said Sara Shor, the associate director of U.S. campaigns at the global environmental group 350.org.\n\n\n\nActivists paint posters Thursday ahead of climate change protests in Berlin. (Hannibal Hanschke/Reuters)\n\nGroups of nurses have previously advocated for environmental justice issues.\n\nIn 2008, while Sen. James M. Inhofe (Okla.), the top Republican on the Committee on Environment and Public Works, was calling global warming \u201ca hoax,\u201d the American Nurses Association published a resolution declaring that \u201cthe challenges we face as a result of global climate change are unprecedented in human history.\u201d\n\nFive years later, nurses in San Francisco led hundreds of people across the Golden Gate Bridge to protest the Keystone pipeline.\n\nBut starting in late 2017 \u2014 with Hurricane Maria, some say \u2014 there has been a new, broad-based surge of interest in the issue within the profession.\n\nKatie Huffling, the executive director of the Alliance of Nurses for Healthy Environments, said the organization has seen an uptick in nurses attending events and lectures on climate change. In a 2018 survey, close to 90 percent of the alliance\u2019s 4,500 members said the government has a responsibility to protect people from the effects of climate change, up from 61 percent the previous year.\n\nNella Pineda-Marcon, a nurse at Mount Sinai-St. Luke\u2019s Hospital in Manhattan, was among the founding members of the Climate Justice and Disaster Relief Committee at the New York State Nurses Association. For years, she said, the committee struggled to recruit members. Now, nurses across the state email asking how they can join.\n\nJones said this summer \u2014 the warmest on record for the Northern Hemisphere \u2014 was the first time she saw patients suffer burns after coming into contact with the sidewalk. Fellow D.C. nurse Amanda Trebach, 33, said she has noticed an increase in heat-related illnesses, and Kristen Brown, an intensive care unit (ICU) nurse based in Lanham, Md., reported more patients coming in for chronic respiratory diseases.\n\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t connected the dots until now,\u201d said Brown, 32, who is marching for the first time on Friday, joining other nurses in an event led by 16-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg.\n\n\n\nClimate activists Militza Flaco, right, of Panama and Greta Thunberg, center, of Sweden take a selfie Wednesday in front of the U.S. Supreme Court. (Olivier Douliery/AFP/Getty Images)\n\n\u201cOnce you become more aware of the problem,\u201d Jones said, \u201cit\u2019s hard, as a person who cares about other people, to ignore it.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, when Hurricane Sandy hit the coastal Far Rockaway neighborhood in Queens, nurses at St. John\u2019s Episcopal Hospital took turns sleeping in the break room while working 18-hour shifts, recalled Iona Folkes, an emergency room nurse.\n\nSuddenly, they could make a connection between their lunchtime view of the Atlantic Ocean and what the talking heads on television were saying about rising sea levels.\n\n\u201cThere was the understanding that this directly can affect me,\u201d Folkes said. \u201cIt\u2019s like, okay, it\u2019s serious, we really have to be concerned.\u201d\n\nIn response to student demands at the University of Minnesota\u2019s nursing school, all faculty have been asked to incorporate climate change into their curriculums, said professor Teddie Potter.\n\nTo Potter, who has served as the faculty lead on the initiative, the move makes sense. Nurses are used to caring for patients in \u201cmulti-system failure,\u201d in which different biological systems malfunction simultaneously, she said.\n\n\u201cThis is part of our profession. We look at mobility, we look at nutrition, we are big-systems thinkers,\u201d she added. \u201cWell, it happens right now that the earth is in multi-system failure.\u201d\n\nBut longtime climate advocates within the profession say not everyone is on board. Many nurses struggle to carve out time for dedicated political action. Although there is a consensus among nurses that climate change is a problem, as in other science-based professions, some still believe their role is by the bedside, not in the streets, Huffling said.\n\n\u201cIt takes a lot for us to want to step out of our role and be more political,\u201d Jones said. \u201cSo if we are, people should listen.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nMost U.S.> teens frightened by climate change, poll finds; about 1 in 4 are taking action\n\nActivist Greta Thunberg demands that Congress \u2018listen to the scientists\u2019\n\nAmericans increasingly see climate change as a crisis, poll shows\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Those participating in protests Friday and Monday say they are responding to what they see on the job.", "authors": ["Rebecca Tan", "Local Reporter", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/xBNMRMlB5fhx5i9raFW_gVDDCBY=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YAZJKUW3DUI6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
