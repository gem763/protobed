Another example the BBC cites is anti-vaxxer bullshit and its popularity on social media bleeding into real-world health crises. And, of course, there\u2019s the incident that practically entered \u201cfake news\u201d into our vocabulary: the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe BBC doesn\u2019t go into detail about what this early warning system will look like, only that its \u201cemphasis will be on moving quickly and collectively to undermine disinformation before it can take hold.\u201d The online statement simply promises future updates.\n\nOther preventative measures the group has planned include targeted campaigns to improve media literacy, educate voters with impartial civic information such as how and when to vote around election time, and otherwise \u201cpromote media education messages.\u201d\n\n\u201cDisinformation and so-called fake news is a threat to us all. At its worst, it can present a serious threat to democracy and even to people\u2019s lives,\u201d BBC Director General Tony Hall said, according to the online statement.\n\nThe Department of Defence\u2019s Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) announced earlier this week that it\u2019s developing disinformation campaign countermeasures as well. DARPA has established the Semantics Forensics program to try tackling the problem with a more automated model, and the organisation is currently \u201csoliciting innovative research proposals\u201d regarding algorithms that can identify and analyse targeted attempts at spreading misinformation.\n\nThe timing of these initiatives likely isn\u2019t a coincidence since the days are quickly counting down to the 2020 U.S. presidential election. According to numerous reports, several tech giants have already begun meeting with U.S. intelligence agencies to come up with a plan of attack before next November gets here. And while all that may be outside the UK\u2019s purview, recent cases of election meddling have shown that these kinds of malicious misinformation campaigns can happen anywhere, so it\u2019s in countries\u2019 best interest to have a defensive strategy in place before it needs one.", "description": "The BBC is teaming up with some of the biggest names in tech to coordinate a defence against the online disinformation campaigns endemic to some of their platforms, the outlet announced Saturday....", "authors": ["Julie Muncy", "Rhett Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/ef6re1tu71tsatzgajuw.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
