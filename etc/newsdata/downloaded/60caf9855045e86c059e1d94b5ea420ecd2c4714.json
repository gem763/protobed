The report notes that \u201cSince FY17 the percentage of innovation-active companies has increased by more than 30%. Regardless of size, location and industry, innovation is now far better understood by companies that seek to remain relevant and competitive.\u201d\n\nThe report goes on to demonstrate that innovation-active organisations share common traits. They are more confident in their ability to adapt to change, have a growth orientation and display a greater awareness to the opportunities and threats around them.\n\nAnd when it comes to performance, the report finds that not only do innovative businesses report a brighter revenue outlook, but that \u201cinnovation-active companies are also more likely to benefit from non-financial, less tangible rewards gained from implementing significant change. For example, there is a virtuous cycle around their workforce.\u201d\n\nSo, the general behaviours of innovative organisations and associated benefits are evident, but what is driving increasing business innovation? The report notes that \u201cof all the factors driving businesses to implement change, the one that stands out is the imperative to meet evolving customer expectations and to improve the customer experience. This is also influencing the skills and capabilities that they seek to access to ensure their organisation is future-fit\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s all about staff, quality and skills\n\nThe Commonwealth Bank\u2019s NBIR brings out one clear reality \u2013 innovative organisations are more likely to focus on people, staff and skills development as they strive to prepare for the future. While innovative organisations are more likely to place a premium on technology, businesses are seeking a mix of soft and technical skills to ensure their organisation is future-fit.\n\n\u201cDespite a clear desire among Australian businesses to develop technology skills, the research finds there is equal, if not more, emphasis on the so-called soft skills. Businesses want employees who are flexible and adaptable, who communicate well and can manage and lead others,\u201d the report said.\n\nThis is also clear in the behaviours and benefits of innovation identified in the Commonwealth Bank\u2019s survey of Australian business. These are \u2013 in many respects \u2013 the physical and real-world manifestations of what the academic research says should result from iterative and persistent innovation.\n\nCommonwealth Bank\u2019s NBIR details key characteristics of innovative organisations and their perspectives of their staff in relation to the approach they take to operational outlook, approach to skills development and prioritisation of technology.\n\nOperational\n\nThe NBIR shows that decision-makers at innovative companies are more aware of the challenges around implementing change. Employees that consider their employer to be innovative are also more confident they have the skills and capabilities their organisation needs for the future.\n\nSkills Development\n\nFirst, it\u2019s clear from the research that innovative organisations have a much stronger focus on business growth as the catalyst for developing new skills. They are more inclined to need creativity and problem-solving skills, as well as look for technology and leadership capabilities, to support their future needs.\n\nTo secure these skills, innovative businesses are prioritising certain training and development programs. They use personalised development plans and formal coaching more than their peers, are more likely to replace staff who can\u2019t adapt, and to seek new skills to diversify the workforce\u2019s capability.\n\nInnovative companies are also significantly more likely to support employee wellbeing, and their employees consider that their skills are being more fully utilised.\n\nTechnology\n\nWhile there is a focus among innovative companies on culture and organisational benefits, the fact respondents to the NBIR survey see technology as important enabler of change should not be understated.\n\nBoth employees and decision-makers at innovative companies place more importance on the role of technology in maintaining a competitive edge. This supports the finding that innovative companies are also significantly more likely to invest in emerging technology than other businesses.", "description": "", "authors": ["Greg Mckenna"], "top_image": "https://businessinsider.com.au/favicon.ico/apple-icon-57x57.png", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
