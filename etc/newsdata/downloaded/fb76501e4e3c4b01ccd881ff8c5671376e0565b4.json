(Leah Millis/Reuters)\n\nPresident Trump on Monday vowed to punish Turkey if the country takes any action the U.S. considers \u201coff limits\u201d amid concerns that Turkey would take advantage of the administration\u2019s decision to pull U.S. troops away from northern Syria.\n\n\u201cAs I have stated strongly before, and just to reiterate, if Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I\u2019ve done before!),\u201d Trump wrote in a pair of tweets. \u201cThey must, with Europe and others, watch over the captured ISIS fighters and families. The U.S. has done far more than anyone could have ever expected, including the capture of 100% of the ISIS Caliphate. It is time now for others in the region, some of great wealth, to protect their own territory.\u201d\n\nThe White House announced Sunday evening that the U.S. will withdraw troops from the northern border of Syria ahead of an expected Turkish invasion of the region, drawing criticism from Republicans and Democrats alike. Turkey will \u201csoon be moving forward\u201d with a \u201clong-planned operation\u201d to resettle Syrian refugees in northern Syria, and the U.S. will not be involved, the White House said Monday in response to suggestions that the withdrawal indicated U.S. approval of the expected Turkish encroachment.\n\nThe move caused consternation among the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, who have been supported by U.S troops in fighting the Islamic State. The SDF called the White House\u2019s decision \u201cshocking and unexpected\u201d and predicted that \u201call the sacrifices we made to defeat ISIS will all be destroyed with the latest American decision.\u201d\n\nRepublican Senator Lindsey Graham, usually a close Trump ally, called the decision a \u201cdisaster in the making\u201d that \u201censures ISIS comeback,\u201d and \u201cforces Kurds to align with Assad and Iran.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Kurds fought with us, but were paid massive amounts of money and equipment to do so,\u201d Trump said of his decision. \u201cI held off this fight for almost 3 years, but it is time for us to get out of these ridiculous Endless Wars, many of them tribal, and bring our soldiers home.\u201d", "description": "\"The Kurds fought with us, but were paid massive amounts of money and equipment to do so,\" Trump said of his decision to pull troops away from Northern Syria.", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle", "Andrew C.
