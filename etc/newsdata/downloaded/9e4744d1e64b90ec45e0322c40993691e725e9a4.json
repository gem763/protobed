That\u2019s why we\u2019re here; that\u2019s why this is not an ordinary environmental case.\u201d\n\nThe sulfolane was not disclosed in the sale, and Williams Petroleum has not contributed to cleanup efforts during the years of litigation, Flint Hills Resources attorney Jan Conlin said.\n\n\u201cThey blamed the state, they blamed the city, they blamed Flint Hills, and they blamed the citizens of the North Pole community,\u201d Conlin said.\n\nSulfolane is not considered a hazardous chemical by the state, nor was it a regulated chemical at the time of the spill, Williams Petroleum attorney David Shoup said.\n\nNeither Williams Petroleum nor Flint Hills Resources is under obligation to clean the spill as the state has not set a cleanup standard. The possible standard listed in parts per billion also has shifted over time.\n\n\u201cUnless there is a cleanup standard, there is no way to know what we have to do to clean up,\u201d Shoup said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Fairbanks (Alaska) Daily News-Miner, http://www.newsminer.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The state of Alaska and two companies have gone to trial to determine who will be held responsible for water contamination in the community of North Pole.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
