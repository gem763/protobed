REUTERS/Brian Snyder/File Photo\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders said on Wednesday he does not intend to scale back his presidential campaigning after a heart attack, saying he had not intended to give the impression he was slowing down.\n\n\u201cI misspoke the other day. I said a word I should not have said and media drives me a little bit nuts to make a big deal about it,\u201d Sanders said in an interview with NBC News. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get back into the groove of a very vigorous campaign. I love doing rallies and I love doing town meetings.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to start off slower and build up and build up and build up.\u201d\n\nSanders, 78, who is one of the top three contenders among the 19 Democrats seeking to take on Republican President Donald Trump in the November 2020 election, suffered chest pains on Oct. 1 while in Nevada for a campaign stop and abruptly canceled campaign events.\n\nHe told reporters outside his home in Burlington, Vermont, on Tuesday that he had wrongly ignored warning signs about his health. He said he would still actively campaign but could \u201cchange the nature of the campaign a bit\u201d and \u201cmake sure that I have the strength to do what I have to do.\u201d\n\nIn the NBC interview, Sanders rejected criticism that his campaign was not forthright about the heart attack, since it initially told reporters there was a blockage in his artery.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s nonsense,\u201d he said, explaining he and his family were dealing with multiple doctors and trying to figure out what had happened - not what to tell the media.\n\nSanders, the oldest candidate in the Democratic field, told NBC he planned to release all of his medical records, but did not say when. He plans on participating in next week\u2019s fourth Democratic presidential debate.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m healthy and we\u2019re going to run a vigorous campaign and we\u2019re going to win this thing,\u201d he said.", "description": "U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders said on Wednesday he does not intend to scale back his presidential campaigning after a heart attack, saying he had not intended to give the impression he was slowing down.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1439014181&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9824T", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
