If I\u2019m half the mother my mum is then I\u2019ll be happy,\" she added.\n\nThey wanted to keep the sex of their unborn baby a surprise, so didn't go down the usual celebrity route of throwing a gender reveal party.\n\nThe pair did have a lavish rainbow-themed baby shower , however, where Brooke posed with a white cake and a bunch of multicoloured balloons.\n\n\"Me, Kean & our families had the most perfect day. There's a whole lot of people who have got a whole lot of love to bless our child with. The three of us are so lucky,\" she gushed.\n\nBrooke joined her Corrie co-stars Hayley Tamaddon and Julia Goulding for a special spa day in August, where the trio compared their growing baby bumps.\n\nThe close friends showed off their bumps in their swimsuits, with Hayley captioning the snap: \"Mummy's to be having a spa day at the garden spa in Warrington .. proudly showing off our baby bumps. So lucky we get to go through this together.\"\n\nSally Carman, who plays Abi Franklin, commented: \"I couldn't love this picture more.\"\n\nAnd Charlie de Melo, who plays Imran Habeeb, said: \"This is fantastic.\"\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nJust earlier this month, Brooke hinted she was getting fed up of being pregnant when she shared a snap of herself as a young Sophie looking unimpressed on Corrie.\n\n\"When people say 'I feel like you've been pregnant for ages'... 'Yes...don\u2019t we all Lesley',\" she joked.\n\nLast month she revealed her bump was too big to get to her shoes when she and Kean went out on a date night.\n\nWearing the ubiquitous Zara black and white polka-dot dress that was everywhere this summer, Brooke wrote: \"Must be the largest Dalmatian you did ever see.\n\n\"One of the few times I've been dressed with make up on & yes Kean had to put on & take my shoes off.\"\n\n(Image: lucyfallonx/Instagram)\n\n(Image: Brooke Vincent/Instagram)\n\nBrooke bid an emotional farewell to her Corrie castmates back in August before going on maternity leave, as it was revealed her character wouldn't be leaving the cobbles for good.\n\n\"I can't believe 15 years ago I came onto the street to play Sophie Webster and today I left to play my biggest role yet Mummy my amazing family at Coronation Street I am going to miss you all so much,\" she wrote as the cast showered her with gifts and flowers.\n\n\"Thank you for always looking after me, for keeping me on the straight and narrow and for letting me get away with murder over the years.\"\n\nShe also paid thanks to Kean for everything he was doing in the final stages of the pregnancy.\n\n\"Also @kean8 for making my last day extra special coming home to the best treats!!
