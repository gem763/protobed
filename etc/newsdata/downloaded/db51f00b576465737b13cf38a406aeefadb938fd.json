Her message, summarized: \"I've been reflecting and I see that I was a bully when we were kids. Sorry! I hope you're doing well.\"\n\nI'm not sure what to say. All morning I've been indulging a fantasy of writing back to tell her that I actually don't forgive her and have spent 25 years replaying all her insults about how ugly and stupid I am. That at least 50 percent of my time in therapy has focused on undoing the inferiority complex and impostor syndrome I developed as a kid hanging out with that particular \"frenemy.\" That her name is a household word, referring to someone who kicks you when you're down.\n\nI know the answer is probably no. But is there ANY value at all in saying any of these things to her? I feel that silence, or just pithily accepting her apology, lets her off the hook.\n\n\u2014 Bullied\n\n\n\n(Nick Galifianakis/For The Washington Post)\n\nBullied: I am so sorry she tortured you, and that it shaped you so, and you still carry it with you. It\u2019s just not right and no apology will give you back those years.\n\nWas her message at full length as flippant as you suggest with your summary? Because that would be an insult to your injury.\n\nI suggest you let it sit for a while, leave the whole message and your feelings about it to soak, before you decide anything. Then read it again to see whether the words are more potentially healing than they seemed at first. A few days from now at least. See if anything softens.\n\nWhether your opinion of the message changes or not, any response you have to it after a waiting period will have a higher ratio of logic to emotion, and therefore will be more likely to represent who you are now instead of the angry, wounded kid you were then. Not to say that kid hasn\u2019t earned a chance to yell, but I think you\u2019ll be more satisfied by the exchange if it\u2019s the adult you talking.\n\nIf it helps, the silence she\u2019ll hear in the meantime won\u2019t be \u201clet[ting] her off the hook.\u201d If anything, I expect not hearing back will be uncomfortable for her.\n\nNot that I recommend ignoring her message just to let her twist \u2014 a healthy response is one you choose toward your own peace of mind, not toward corroding hers. Tempting though it may be, you don\u2019t want to use an updated, adult version of her own tactics against her.\n\nIn fact, whether your response does or doesn\u2019t let her off any hooks is best treated as coincidental. You do what you need to do, period.\n\nI hope you\u2019ll find enough sincere remorse in the note to justify talking to her directly \u2014 at which point, yes, there is value in sharing the consequences you live with. Let her own her handiwork.\n\nBut if nothing in her message calls to you, then nothing is a valid response.", "description": "The woman owned up to her behavior.
