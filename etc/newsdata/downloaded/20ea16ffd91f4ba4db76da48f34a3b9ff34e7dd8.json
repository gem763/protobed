Since the 1970s 41 per cent of British species alone have decreased in abundance \u2013 meaning that per species measured, there are significantly fewer individuals in each population.\n\nDespite a pleasing 26 per cent of species increasing in population size during the same period, we are still faced with the sobering reality of wildlife disappearing before our very eyes \u2013 and not recovering.\n\nThe report details that such losses have been most acutely measured within the last decade and that it has been a relentless struggle for our treasured wildlife, with 20 per cent of species showing \u2018little change\u2019. Change is what we so desperately need.\n\nThe turtle dove is under threat (Picture: Getty)\n\nThis is due to a complex cocktail of persistent misguided agricultural management, urbanisation, pollution, invasive species, climate change, hydrological change and \u2013 in my opinion one of the most important reasons \u2013 a continued resistance to the urgent change required among those in charge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt shines a much needed spotlight on our behaviour, habits and desire for societal progression \u2013 whilst at the mercy of the very things that sustain us.\n\nOf every three species you see outside now, one of them has decreased in number. Butterflies, moths and animals with specialised habitat needs, have been particularly hard hit.\n\nSuccessful conservation thrives on teamwork, passion and communication (Picture: Jack Johns)\n\nOnce upon a time, the hedgerows buzzed like freshers queuing outside their first nightclub. Grasshoppers and crickets leaped ahead of you on an afternoon stroll \u2013 all that was normal. We didn\u2019t realise what we would miss.\n\nNow, I only seem to see a grasshopper leaping ahead of me if I visit a sensitively managed nature reserve, or specialist organic farm. And the only deafening dawn chorus I hear is via the Calm app on my top three \u2018Nature Soundscapes\u2019. That is not normal. I don\u2019t want it.\n\nBut for all the gloom \u2013 for all the bitterness I feel that 26 per cent of UK mammals are at risk of disappearing \u2013 reading the report gave me hope.\n\nWildlife is the most hilarious soap opera if you just take the time to look (Picture: Getty)\n\nMany of the contributing factors to nature\u2019s current \u2018state\u2019 are reversible. While much of the burden remains in the way the UK farms the land, there is much that we can do in our houses, at work and on our social media to be a voice for the voiceless.\n\nPublic support for helping nature has blossomed over the past 18 months thanks to huge campaigns on social media, TV shows like Blue Planet and phenomenal uproar by young people with a future to protect.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuccessful conservation thrives on teamwork, passion and communication, and the report demonstrates how this has enabled species like the booming bittern and spectacular large blue butterfly to bounce back from the brink.\n\nLet\u2019s give ourselves permission to be lazy in the garden (Picture: Getty)\n\nIf every single one of us planted a window box of wildflowers for pollinators, saw manicured lawns as a thing of the past, left autumn\u2019s carpet where it fell, saw \u2018insect markets\u2019 instead of \u2018weeds\u2019 \u2013 essentially giving ourselves permission to be \u2018lazy\u2019 at home! \u2013 then we might just have a chance in letting the wild reach our doorstep once again.\n\nI can\u2019t remember what drew me to conservation and loving nature. It\u2019s just always been there. I\u2019ve always had this emotional urge to love animals and to view them as beings with myriad emotions, intelligence and an intense purpose for \u2018life\u2019 that I often envy.\n\nI see nature as an essential part of life and a fundamental and unique romance that we are in danger of divorcing from. I also see it as a huge form of entertainment \u2013 wildlife is the most hilarious soap opera if you just take the time to look.\n\nFriendships, break-ups, make-ups, cheaters, comedians, epic fails \u2013 it\u2019s all there! And the best thing? Once you start looking, discovering, sharing \u2013 it\u2019s addictive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI adore hiking and I am amazed at how the path sucks you in. It makes you feel good. It helps your anxieties fade into nothing. Nature is the most wonderful constant, humming away in the background, drowning out the noise.\n\nI worry that if we continue with \u2018business as usual\u2019 that the \u2018hum\u2019 will fade away; that future generations won\u2019t know nature as it deserves to be known and that society will become even more disjointed, confused and unhappy. Humans are meant to let nature in.\n\nPeople protect what they love. If we can communicate the findings of this year\u2019s report appropriately, in a way that instills the average Brit with a joyous love of nature, only then can we find real hope for a brighter future for our natural world.\n\nYou can follow Sophie on Instagram here.\n\nMORE: We\u2019re already in the middle of a mass extinction and it\u2019s going to get worse\n\nMORE: Duckling chews cigarette butt thrown on the ground at nature reserve\n\nMORE: Post-apocalyptic \u2018nuclear winter\u2019 could send humanity into extinction, scientists warn", "description": "Once upon a time, the hedgerows buzzed like freshers queuing outside their first nightclub - but they don\u2019t anymore.", "authors": ["Sophie Pavelle", "Zoologist", "Science Communicator."], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-603452665_1570196203.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
