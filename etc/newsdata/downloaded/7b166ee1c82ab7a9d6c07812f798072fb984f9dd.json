Since then, the group has grown in size, as each of its members has also gotten a lot more famous. Looking back at the group\u2019s history, Kail jokes that you can date photos by \u201chow tired Lin is,\u201d back before he had the \u201cweight of the world on his shoulders\u201d thanks to Hamilton. Looking back at Freestyle Love Supreme\u2019s history, as it turns out, was exactly what we asked Kail to do, walking us through a miniature history of the group by way of photos they took over their decade and a half together.\n\nBefore we get to that, a little basic information: This fall, after a successful run Off Broadway, Freestyle Love Supreme is reuniting on Broadway starting September 13 at the Booth Theatre, with a core cast that includes Andrew Bancroft, a.k.a. \u201cJelly Donut\u201d; Arthur Lewis, a.k.a. \u201cArthur the Geniuses\u201d; Bill Sherman, a.k.a. \u201cKing Sherman\u201d; Chris Sullivan, a.k.a. \u201cShockwave\u201d; Anthony Veneziale, a.k.a. \u201cTwo-Touch\u201d; and Utkarsh Ambudkar, a.k.a. \u201cUTK.\u201d There will also be special guests, including Lin-Manuel Miranda, Christopher Jackson, Daveed Diggs, James Monroe Iglehart, Wayne Brady, and Ashley P\u00e9rez Flanagan, who show up in photos along the way. Now, let\u2019s get to the digital archives.\n\nEarly promo art of the group.

Jack and Bill Sherman was apparently not yet King Sherman.\u201d Shockwave (Chris Sullivan), as Kail remembers, introduced himself with a nickname already intact when the group was first performing at the Peoples Improv Theater. \u201cHe said, \u2018My name is Shockwave. You need a beatboxer.\u2019 Shockwave came fully monikered.\u201d\n\nFrom the original 2004 production of Freestyle Love Supreme at Ars Nova. Photo: Courtesy of Freestyle Love Supreme\n\nThis picture hails from Freestyle Love Supreme\u2019s time at Ars Nova in 2004, which Kail describes as \u201clife-changing\u201d for the group, since it was the first time he or Miranda had been paid to perform. \u201cWe were doing it five or six times a week,\u201d Kail says. \u201cWe took this one-off show we were doing and then we had to create a structure that could be solid and then also evolve. The shape of the show started to emerge then.\u201d For instance, when the group did its opening number there, most audience members wouldn\u2019t believe it was made up on the spot, so the group came up with a bit dubbed \u201cfoundations of freestyle\u201d where they\u2019d solicit nine or ten words from the audience and work them into a performance to showcase their flexibility. \u201cThat was the kind of thing in that small space that we were finding and perfecting,\u201d Kail says. \u201cWe still haven\u2019t perfected it, of course.\u201d\n\nHanging out at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 2005. Photo: Courtesy of Freestyle Love Supreme\n\nAs the group grew in recognition, it moved between the comedy and theater worlds, appearing at the Aspen Comedy Festival in 2004, and the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 2005. That\u2019s where Miranda and Jackson are above, goofing off in their free time. \u201cBecause we really started Ars Nova as this intersectional space, and we went straight to the comedy world with the act, and then we went to Edinburgh. Edinburgh can be anything. You\u2019re right next to the contortionists,\u201d Kail remembers. \u201cYou\u2019re right next to the people that are doing their high-school Shakespeare production from Tennessee. Literally anything goes. Then we went back to the comedy stuff for Melbourne and then the Just for Laughs in Montreal, but then in New York, we were playing a lot of these much more traditional music spaces. That was fun. It was fun being able to bounce around like that.\u201d\n\nLin-Manuel Miranda, Anthony Veneziale, and Utkarsh Ambudkar rehearsing.

Photo: Courtesy of Freestyle Love Supreme\n\nThe group was less active as a whole during the latter half of the 2000s, considering that many of its members were getting busy elsewhere, particularly with the Broadway run of In the Heights. After In the Heights opened on Broadway in 2008, the group started to play for larger audiences, such as at Irving Plaza in 2011, as pictured above. \u201cI remember we sold out Irving Plaza after we were on Broadway for a little while with Heights,\u201d Kail says. \u201cIt was the first understanding that we had of, \u2018Oh, there\u2019s a larger audience now.\u2019\u201d\n\nAt a 2012 promo shoot for Participant Media, which owned Pivot. Photo: Courtesy of Freestyle Love Supreme\n\nFreestyle Love Supreme also got together for a TV show that ran on Pivot. \u201cWhat was really cool about it is they gave us a lot of space and room,\u201d Kail says. They shot a promo for it in 2012, the source of the photo above, and based the plotlines for the TV series around ten live shows they performed at Ars Nova.\n\nA photo from the Pivot TV series, with Shockwave in a gorilla suit.

That meant a clip with Eli Manning, seen above, as well as one bit about Cris Carter, which ended in the refrain \u201cPut the damn man in the Hall of Fame\u201d (something that happened that year). In New Orleans that year, the group also performed with Daveed Diggs, and as Kail remembers, it was when he and Diggs talked about the next big thing they\u2019d do together. \u201cDaveed first heard about Hamilton waiting to go on,\u201d Kail remembers.\n\nTatted up backstage Off Broadway in 2019. Photo: Courtesy of Freestyle Love Supreme\n\nThis picture comes from Freestyle Love Supreme\u2019s Off Broadway run earlier this year, though the tattoos didn\u2019t all get inked at once. \u201cThey each got their tattoos at different times. I don\u2019t remember when or who. I don\u2019t remember why also, but that\u2019s another question,\u201d Kail says. \u201cThe last episode of the Pivot television show is Bill Sherman getting his tattoo. The episode is called \u2018Do No Arm,\u2019 which we thought was pretty funny.\u201d\n\nOnstage (left) and off (right) during Freestyle Love Supreme's Off Broadway run in 2019.
