A decision on the outcome will be heard on December 16.\n\nHatem Ben Arfa would receive an ethics premium of \u00a365,000 during his time at PSG\n\nBen Arfa, pictured in 2016, would only earn that though if he met certain contractual clauses\n\nHe is currently suing the club for \u00a37million in damages following an ill-fated two-years there\n\nDuring this week's hearing the breakdown of Ben Arfa's salary was told.\n\nAs reported by L'Equipe, he would earn a gross monthly salary of \u00a3434,000 that was divided into two parts. This would entail a lump sum of \u00a3369,000-per-month and an ethics premium of \u00a365,000.\n\nThis ethics premium would be paid out if the France international met certain objectives at the club. These included to arrive to training on time and to not speak ill of the club in the media.\n\nL'Equipe state that the maverick playmaker only failed to achieve these objectives once in December 2017.\n\nAs reported by Get French Football News, Ben Arfa's lawsuit with PSG is due to his exclusion from the first-team between April 2017 and June 2018.\n\nBetween April 2017 and June 2018 the maverick forward made just one first-team appearance\n\nThe 32-year-old made just one appearance for the Parc des Princes during this time and is subsequently suing them on two counts. In fact he didn't play at all during the 2017-18 campaign.\n\nThe first is symbolically for \u20ac1 (87p) for psychological and moral damage to him caused by the club. The rest is due to the 'opportunity cost' of him being demoted to the reserves and thus a loss of potential individual and team bonuses if he was in the first-team.\n\nPSG are refuting the claims and their lawyer Marie-Helene Cohen-Guilleminet said: 'PSG were not in breach of their obligations when they decided not to select the player, who were within their rights to do so because of failings at training and weak performance from the play\u2026 Everyone knows that he did not train enough.'\n\nSpeaking at the end of Wednesday's three-hour court session, Ben Arfa said: 'All the players were surprised that I was not playing, including Neymar, because I performed very well in training. I was told: \"You will give in, you will lose the plot\". But I am not scared of adversity. I stayed because I was convinced that I would play for them.'\n\nBen Arfa, who had spells in England with Newcastle and Hull City, is a free agent after leaving Ligue 1 outfit Rennes at the end of last season.", "description": "The fallout of Hatem Ben Arfa's ongoing legal battle with Paris Saint-Germain has revealed that he received a bonus for not badmouthing the club publicly and for being punctual to training.", "authors": ["Luke Augustus For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/15/19840580-0-image-a-38_1571321088934.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
