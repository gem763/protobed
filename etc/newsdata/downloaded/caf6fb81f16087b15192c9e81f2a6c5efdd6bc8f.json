Expert insight. Clear analysis. Everything you\u2019ve come to expect from the newsroom of The Post -- for your ears.\n\nModerate Democrats shift their focus from Joe Biden to Elizabeth Warren\n\nOn Tuesday night, 12 Democratic presidential candidates debated for more than three hours in Westerville, Ohio, to discuss impeachment, butt heads over subjects such as Medicare-for-all and pile onto Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter four debates, those who emerged toward the top of the field at the start of the primary campaign \u2014 Warren, former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) \u2014 remain in the top tier, while struggling candidates continue their slog.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the debates have revealed the disparate personalities seeking the nomination, says political reporter Amber Phillips\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThey still have deep ravines between the moderates and the liberals on big issues,\u201d Phillips says. \u201cOn politics, I think last night\u2019s debate shifted things fairly dramatically, and what I mean by that is the candidates \u2013 almost all of them except for Elizabeth Warren \u2013 decided, \u2018Let\u2019s go after each other.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy a Seattle millionaire is at the center of the impeachment inquiry\n\nThe U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, intends to tell Congress this week that text messages in which he denied that President Trump had offered Ukraine a quid pro quo arrangement were simply Sondland relaying a message that Trump told him over the phone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only true that the president said it, not that it was the truth,\u201d a person familiar with Sondland\u2019s planned testimony told investigative reporter Aaron Davis\n\n\n\n\n\nUntil revelations about the president\u2019s phone call with Ukraine became public three weeks ago, Sondland was a relatively quiet public figure. Now, many are wondering how a man with no prior diplomatic experience could ascend so high in the administration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHaving been a very successful hotelier, he was worth tens of millions of dollars,\u201d Davis says. \u201cHe had lots of friends who were millionaires. He would hold fundraisers in his home and invite lots of other millionaires and then bundle all of these donations into six- and seven-figure contributions that would get the attention of candidates running for office\u201d \u2014 in hopes of one day becoming an ambassador.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy a drug lord who devastated D.C. is back in court\n\nEven after he was sent to prison for life, drug kingpin Rayful Edmond III remained a legend to some in Washington.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHe had a following,\u201d says crime and courts reporter Keith Alexander . \u201cHe had a fan base. I mean, this was a young man who was 22, 23, 24 years of age, and he had chauffeur-driven limousines. He was always buying diamonds. He would give money to little league baseball teams, pay the rent for individuals in his neighborhood, for their mothers.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Edmond oversaw a crack cocaine epidemic in the late 1980s that devastated the District and helped make it the murder capital of the country. And this week, a judge could decide that he\u2019ll be released from federal prison with time served.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:", "description": "Amber Phillips shares her takeaways from the fourth Democratic presidential debate.
