Last Christmas, she gifted the family at-home DNA kits to trace their family tree, which they all took. Two months later, results showed that she didn't share any of Cartellone's genetic history and makeup and a separate paternity test confirmed the results. A lawsuit filed last month against Cincinnati's Institute for Reproductive Health, The Christ Hospital and Ovation Fertility claims another man's sperm was used to create the embryo. Los Angeles mom Anni (left) was hospitalized for two days as she fought to regain custody of her weeks-old son, who was born to another woman in New York following an IVF mix-up In March, two fertilized embryos, one belonging to Anni Manukyan, were wrongly implanted into a Korean-American IVF patient, with the mistake only noticed when the couple expecting twin girls gave birth to two Caucasian boys. Alec, pictured with Ashot, finally returned to Los Angeles at the end of May after a six-week court battle over his custody. He was born prematurely in March to a Korean-American couple who accidentally received his embryo The couple, who live in Los Angeles, were granted custody of the baby in a New York courtroom in May when he was six-weeks-old and named him Alec after DNA tests proved they were the child's genetic parents. A judge ruled that 'DNA is DNA and genetics play a big role in everything, so the baby belongs with Anni and Ashot Manukyan.' Manukyan has paid tribute to the Korean-American family, from Queens, named only in court documents as A.P. and Y.Z., describing the heartbreaking meeting as having 'no tension, only love.' The Asian couple from Queens, New York sued the Los Angeles fertility clinic after they gave birth to someone else\u2019s twins after undergoing treatments with the couple's female embryos. Donald Cline, an Indiana fertility doctor who used his own sperm to artificially inseminate dozens of patients without their consent, has been confirmed to be the father to at least 48 children born in the 1970s and 1980s According to legal documents filed in Brooklyn federal court, the couple were shocked to discover that not only was the woman carrying boys, but that neither of the babies were Asian. After the birth, the parents were forced to give up custody of both babies to their biological parents. Donald Cline, an Indiana fertility doctor, who used his own sperm to artificially inseminate dozens of patients without their consent is confirmed to be the father to at least 48 children born in the 1970s and 1980s. The now-80-year-old has admitted to using his own sperm to inseminate at least 50 unwitting women. Several of the children conceived as a result have bonded with their half-siblings over the startling discovery that they're related Cline was convicted of lying about the inseminations in December 2017. The British couple first used the clinic in January 2015 using the husband's sperm and embryos from a known donor. Then, in December 2017, they underwent a second round of IVF, again using embryo from the known donor and the husband's sperm, according to documents A British couple sued a Connecticut IVF clinic for allegedly giving them a stranger's embryo-sperm combination, after their baby was born a different race in April. The unnamed pair say CT Fertility P.C., which has since closed down, inseminated the wife with the wrong fertilized egg. A DNA test on both the couple's children was said to have shown the two brothers are not related. The suit states: 'Their second child appeared to have a much darker skin pigmentation then either the father, the genetic mother or their first child which was extremely unexpected and perplexing as the children were supposed to have the same genetic makeup.' They are said to be 'plagued with fear' their genetic material may be used for another family. They are also said to 'live in constant, nagging, debilitating fear that the person whose genetic material was used will realize'.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Dr. Paul Jones is being sued for fraud by allegedly using his own sperm to artificially inseminate Cheryl Emmons in 1980 and 1985 in Colorado.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/20/20346542-0-image-a-18_1572382704442.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
