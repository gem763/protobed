With a successful landing today, the X-37B completed its longest flight to date and successfully completed all mission objectives,\u2019 said Randy Walden, Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office director, in a statement.\n\n\u2018This mission successfully hosted Air Force Research Laboratory experiments, among others, as well as providing a ride for small satellites.\u2019\n\nPersonnel in self-contained atmospheric protective ensemble suits conduct initial checks on X-37B back in 2010 (Getty)\n\nIn the same statement, the US Air Force explained that the X-37B enables the US to \u2018efficiently and effectively develop space capabilities necessary to maintain superiority in the space domain.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe previous record for an orbital mission was 718 days \u2013 set by the same vehicle on the OTV-4 mission in May 2017.\n\nThe aircraft has a wingspan of less than 15ft \u2013 and is taken into space on a rocket, but glides back to Earth like a space shuttle.\n\nDuring the aircraft\u2019s previous missions, amateur astronomers were able to detect the orbital pattern of the first X-37B which included flyovers of North Korea, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan, heightening the suspicion that the vehicle was being used for surveillance.", "description": "The X-37B has landed after 780 days in orbit", "authors": ["Jeff Parsons"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_93258396_1572270647.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
