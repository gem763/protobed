But finally an arrangement seems to have been made.'\n\nIt is usual for tax settlements to be on the basis of an agreed amount but with no admissions of liability.\n\nSlavica, Tamara and her 28-year-old sister, Petra, are all beneficiaries of the trust.\n\nWhen Bernie had a triple heart bypass in 1999, all of the share capital of F1's parent company was transferred to a business called Petara in Jersey.\n\nA source told the Sun : 'There's been a number of offers made, and failed suggestions on how to settle the bill. But finally an arrangement seems to have been made'\n\nIt is usual for tax settlements to be on the basis of an agreed amount but with no admissions of liability. Pictured is Ecclestone's car\n\nSlavica transferred the asset - his most valuable - in case he died.\n\nShe then moved the shares to the trust. The trust's offshore location meant no tax was paid on the cash raised from selling the shares.\n\nHe has faced long-running questioning about a Lichtenstein trust set up by his wife, Slavica (pictured together), in 1997\n\nBernie is prevented from controlling the trust because he is a UK resident. Were he to take control, he would be required to pay tax on the money raised from selling the shares.\n\nIf UK residents transfer assets to a non-domicile and income becomes payable to that person, the law states that the person making the transfer must not enjoy it.\n\nThe ex-F1 boss claims to never have controlled Bambino and in 2008 it was found he had not breached rules when transferring the shares.\n\nSix years later investigators argued in court they had been 'misled and relied on representations that were false' and rescinded the settlement agreement.\n\nIn 2015 Bernie's lawyers appeared at the High Court and it was found he filed three lawsuits in an attempt to block a bill issued by HMRC.\n\nThe bill he was trying to block related to 13 years of income the trust had earned that totalled \u00a3674million with another \u00a3349million in interest.\n\nAt the time Bernie said he was 'effectively suing' the government department for 'breach of contract' due to their assessment of him.\n\nTamara visited HMRC's base in East London in December 2017.
