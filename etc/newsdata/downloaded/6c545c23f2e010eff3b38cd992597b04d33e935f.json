We loved that an auto shut off makes it super safe, and that it could be used as a nightlight even with the mist switched off. When tested with Neom\u2019s Scent to Sleep essential oil blend, this pod soon became our bedside table essential as we wound down to the relaxing scents of lavender, sweet basil and jasmine. The ceramic cover with rose gold trim gives this diffuser a stylish, premium finish and it comes in a beautiful box too, making it a great one for gifting.\n\nBuy now\n\nHomedics dream ultrasonic diffuser: \u00a339.99, Homedics\n\nAt first glance, this white, plastic diffuser is pretty basic. Plug it in and get it going however, and it performs just as well as the more expensive ones in our line-up. The steady stream of mist scents the room nicely, and a colour-changing light gives an ambient glow, without being irritating. We liked being able to choose the intermittent 30 seconds on, 30 seconds off, option, lasting for 12 hours, or a continuous mist that shuts off after six hours when it runs out of water. This one was road-tested by a teen and although she noted the noise was a little \"gurgly\", she found it particularly nice to have as part of her nighttime routine.\n\nBuy now\n\nNeal\u2019s Yard Remedies Esta aroma diffuser: \u00a357.50, Neal\u2019s Yard Remedies\n\nThe Esta diffuser wouldn\u2019t look out of place in a Scandi spa with its lovely bamboo cover and gentle bubbling sound \u2013 and the wellness experience doesn\u2019t end there. Use with one of Neal\u2019s Yard Remedies\u2019 legendary botanical essential oils and you have aromatic therapy at the touch of a button. You take off the top to add the water and essence, and the lid\u2019s nightlight gives a soft, relaxing glow. There\u2019s an intermittent, 30-second mist setting, and it turns off automatically when the tank is empty. We tried this one with Neal\u2019s Yard Remedies\u2019 woman\u2019s balance oil blend and enjoyed the gentle, relaxing vapour that quickly scented the room.\n\nBuy now\n\nRituals perfume genie: \u00a399, Rituals\n\nLiving up to its name, this wireless diffuser is shaped like a genie\u2019s lamp and looks elegant on a shelf or side table as it gently works its fragrant magic. Unlike other diffusers that require water and oil, this works by popping in a Ritual fragrance cartridge \u2013 available in six atmospheric scents that each last for up to 270 hours. What really won us over though is how it\u2019s controlled. Download the app and you can remotely schedule the days and times that the diffuser turns on, as well as changing the perfume strength according to the size of your room. Coming home to an already lush-smelling living room certainly makes its price-ticket worth it.\n\nBuy now\n\nThis Works scent well diffuser: \u00a355, This Works\n\nWe were excited by this portable option as it meant we could get all the wellbeing benefits of aromatherapy, while on the go. The scent well diffuser is small but effective so is travel-friendly or even great to whip out in the office; it\u2019s charged by USB, so can be plugged into a laptop to power-up. And it\u2019s incredibly easy to use: add a few drops of oil into the top, press the side button, and you have an aromatherapy-infused mist to give you an energy pep, add a sense of calm to your space, or to help you sleep. It switches off after an hour too, which is a nifty feature if you leave it on while nodding off.\n\nBuy now\n\nMuji large aroma diffuser: \u00a389.95, Muji\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever stepped inside a Muji store, it\u2019s likely you\u2019ll have noticed this diffuser misting up the shop floor. And it\u2019s a bestseller for several reasons. The neutral, minimalistic curved shape blends discreetly into any d\u00e9cor and with a large 350ml tank, it\u2019s a good choice for scenting bigger rooms. The timer settings are handy \u2013 you can run it for 30, 60, 90 or 180 minutes, and we liked that it also doubles up as a side lamp with a dimmable option on the light. Want to spend a little less? Go for Muji\u2019s smaller diffuser at \u00a359.95, or the portable version that\u2019s even cheaper.\n\nBuy now\n\nDiptyque hourglass diffuser: \u00a3128, Diptyque\n\nThe hourglass diffuser is almost too beautiful to be a functional item but highly functional it is, effortlessly filling the room with one of Diptyque\u2019s delicious signature scents. This diffuser isn\u2019t electrical \u2013 making it unique to the others, so we found it great to position where there\u2019s no plug access or if you just don\u2019t want to see a tumbling lead from your device. But how does it work? You turn over the hourglass and the perfume dribbles through the diffuser channel and delivers scent into the air, lasting for months. You can then buy a fragrance refill to use the diffuser again. It\u2019s certainly budget-busting, but a very sophisticated way to have a nice smelling home. We figured it would make the ultimate gift for someone interiors obsessed, or if elegant scents are your thing, a glorious treat for yourself.\n\nBuy now\n\nMade By Zen vitra scent diffuser: \u00a358, Amara\n\nWhen it comes to ultrasonic diffusers, Made By Zen knows its stuff, selling a range of decorative devices that both fragrance the home and reduce dryness caused by central heating. We loved that the geometric glass Vitra diffuser looks like a stylish nightlight with its ambient glow. It\u2019s easy to use \u2013 add water and essential oil for a subtle waft of scent that can be used in intermittent mist mode too. You can also use with just with water to get the humidifying benefits.\n\nBuy now\n\nPuressentiel plug in gentle heat diffuser: \u00a325.10, Puressentiel\n\nThis is a completely different offering from the ornamental aroma oil diffusers, but super-handy nonetheless. Flip the lid, put drops of essential oil in the diffuser\u2019s metallic pan and plug in to a socket point. It then pumps a gentle mist into the air, shutting off after eight hours of use. We tried it with Puressentiel\u2019s air-purifying blend of oil and it managed to rid the kitchen of strong smells after cooking. For when you want a discreet, but powerful boost of aromatherapy around the house, this is a mini diffuser is must-have.\n\nBuy now\n\nMoodo smart home fragrance creation: \u00a3169.95, Selfridges\n\nThis diffuser set is for those serious about their scents \u2013 and their tech. It isn\u2019t cheap, but for a seamless home fragrance experience, it\u2019s a super-smart pick. Moodo\u2019s wifi connected system can be loaded with four fragrances at a time from a choice of 10 wellbeing-enhancing, eco-friendly capsules. It then delivers a scent on demand by downloading the app and setting a schedule, or by syncing up with your home tech hub; Moodo is compatible with Amazon Alexa, Siri and Google Assistant. We loved that the app suggests fragrance combinations or you can play around blending your own bespoke smells according to your mood.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Aroma diffusers\n\nNeom\u2019s Wellbeing Pod gets our Best Buy badge: it\u2019s a stylish looking diffuser that delivers on both style and scent \u2013 use with Neom\u2019s expert blend of oils for maximum benefit. The Homedics Dream diffuser deserves a bravo for being great value for money and we also love the portability of the Scent Well diffuser by This Works.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
