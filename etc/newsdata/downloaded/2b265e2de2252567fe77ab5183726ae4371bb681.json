If you want to spend a bit less, you might go for the Apple Watch Series 3, which has many of the same features as the Series 5, like Apple Pay, GPS, and more.\n\nHow much you\u2019ll pay depends on which watch you choose, how you customize the watch in the new Apple Watch Studio, and what country you\u2019re in. Both versions are available with either just GPS, or GPS and a cellular connection, so the watch can connect to a cell network without needing to be near a phone.\n\nThe prices vary widely even among the base version of these models, from relatively low prices in the US and Canada to much higher prices in Brazil and Russia. Not all models available in the US are available in other countries.\n\nHere\u2019s how much the base model Apple Watches cost in 15 countries.\n\nApple Watch Series 3 with GPS\n\nsource Issei Kato/Reuters\n\nUnited States: $199\n\nUnited Kingdom: \u00a3199, or $245\n\nAustralia: A$319, or $215\n\nCanada: C$259, or $195\n\nJapan: \u00a5 19,800, or $183\n\nChina: RMB 1,499, or $210\n\nMexico: Mex$4,799, or $245\n\nGermany: \u20ac 229, or $251\n\nSweden: SEK 2,495, or $256\n\nItaly: \u20ac239, or $262\n\nRussia: 15,990 pyb, or $249\n\nBrazil: R$1,999, or $478\n\nPoland: z\u0141 999, or $250\n\nThe Philippines: \u20b111,990, or $229\n\nTurkey: $1,499 TL, r $264\n\nApple Watch Series 3 with GPS and cellular\n\nUnited States: $299\n\nUnited Kingdom: \u00a3299, or $370\n\nAustralia: A$469, or $316\n\nCanada: C$389, or $353\n\nJapan: \u00a5 30,800, or $286\n\nChina: RMB 2,299, or $322\n\nMexico: Mex$7,299, or $373\n\nGermany: \u20ac 329, or $360\n\nSweden: SEK 3,695, or $379\n\nItaly: \u20ac339, or $371\n\nRussia: n/a\n\nBrazil: R$2,899, or $693\n\nPoland: z\u0141 1449, or $362\n\nThe Philippines: n/a\n\nTurkey: n/a\n\nApple Watch Series 5 with GPS\n\nsource Lisa Eadicicco/Business Insider\n\nUnited States: $399\n\nUnited Kingdom: \u00a3399, or $493\n\nAustralia: A$649, or $438\n\nCanada: C$529, or $399\n\nJapan: \u00a5 42,800 , or $397\n\nChina: RMB 3,199, or $449\n\nMexico: Mex$9,999, or $511\n\nGermany: \u20ac 459, or $502\n\nSweden: SEK 4,995, or$512\n\nItaly: \u20ac559, or $612\n\nRussia: 32,990 pyb, or $514\n\nBrazil: n/a\n\nPoland: z\u0141 1999, or $499\n\nThe Philippines: n/a\n\nTurkey: n/a\n\nApple Watch Series 5 with GPS and cellular\n\nsource Business Insider/Lisa Eadicicco\n\nUnited States: $499\n\nUnited Kingdom: \u00a3499, or $617\n\nAustralia: A$799, or $539\n\nCanada: C$659, or $497\n\nJapan: \u00a5 53,800, or $499\n\nChina: RMB 3,999, or $561\n\nMexico: Mex$12,499, or $638\n\nGermany: \u20ac 549, or $601\n\nSweden: SEK 6,195, or $635\n\nItaly: \u20ac559, or $612\n\nRussia: n/a\n\nBrazil: n/a\n\nPoland: z\u0141 2449, or $611\n\nThe Philippines: n/a\n\nTurkey: n/a", "description": "Business Insider - Apple now only carries the Series 3 and Series 5 Watches, and they range from least expensive in the US and Canada to most expensive in Brazil..
