The original sin of this presidency is failure to divest", "language": "en", "text": "This is Trump\u2019s latest scheme to profit off of his time in public office. In less than three years, Trump\u2019s failure to divest from his businesses and his actions as president have resulted in more than 2,300 conflicts of interest between his administration and his personal financial interests, according to a report released this month by my organization, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.\n\nThose conflicts are not merely a breach of Trump\u2019s campaign promise to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d \u2014 they also constitute abuses of the powers of his high office that should be the subject of an impeachment inquiry.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s failure to divest from his businesses was the original sin of his presidency, because that failure made conflicts of interest inevitable. It meant that countless decisions he would make as president would have the potential to be influenced by his own financial interests.", "description": "", "authors": ["Noah Bookbinder", "Usatoday.Com Story Opinion Trump-Presidency-Spawns-Conflicts-Of-Interest-Personal-Profits-Column"], "top_image": ""}
