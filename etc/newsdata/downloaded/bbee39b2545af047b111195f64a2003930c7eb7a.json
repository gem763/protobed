Designed by Erno Goldfinger and opened in 1968, when local authorities still built council housing in earnest, Balfron arrived on the crest of a wave of high-rise developments. Towers were seen as the ideal solution to the problem of how to house people well in dense urban centres.\n\nThirty years later Sadler, now a children\u2019s diabetes specialist nurse, bought a flat three doors down at number 81. Although Balfron\u2019s apartments were now selling on the open market, Sadler says the thing she\u2019d originally loved about it remained: the sense of community. \u201cThere were old East Enders who had lived there since the building opened, Bangladeshi families, Africans and eastern Europeans,\u201d she said.\n\nIan Fleming hated Goldfinger so much that he named a Bond villain after him\n\nIn 2011, however, she received a compulsory purchase order: she was being forced her to sell her flat. Balfron was going to be redeveloped for the luxury market. The residents had to go.\n\nIn bringing up Ballard, Sadler is referring to High-Rise, the author\u2019s 1975 novel set in a multi-storey building partly inspired by Balfron. It featured Antony Royal, a monstrous architect who, like Goldfinger, lived at the top of the tower he built. (Unlike Goldfinger, the fictional Royal beat up his tenants if they got too curious.) The book asked the question: what if, instead of the council tenants who lived in Balfron, such a tower was instead filled with a striving professional class and leisure activities that detached them from the world outside?\n\nBallard\u2019s answer was that the proto-yuppie residents would be driven to vicious distraction by the bourgeois competitiveness fostered by their environment. Braying bourgeois mobs skulk in foyers. Dogs are eaten.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve looked at some of the stuff from the new developers,\u201d says Sadler, \u201cand I\u2019m thinking, \u2018Oh my God, it\u2019s that book.\u2019\u201d\n\nIndeed, life is mirroring art: this Saturday, the media will get an early glimpse of the new Balfron. All former residents of the 146-property building \u2013 renters and owners alike \u2013 have been moved on (bar six leaseholders who dug in their heels). The developer, Londonewcastle, commissioned the architects Egret West and Ab Rogers (son of Sir Richard) to modernise to a \u201c21st-century standard\u201d, and the new residents are expected to be a panoply of professionals who will enjoy a high-spec cinema club, a music room complete with drum kit, a workshop, a library, a gym and a cooking and dining space for bigger soirees. All of the flats will be for sale, not rent.\n\nThe interiors, too, have been reshaped to 21st century standards. There is increased acoustic insulation, sprinklers, and ducts for a filtered ventilation system. The properties Goldfinger demarcated into separate rooms for living, cooking and dining are now open-plan, except for a handful of \u201cheritage\u201d apartments that have been given a \u201creverse-makeover\u201d using carefully sourced period elements \u2013 most of the original taps, for example, were bought on eBay.\n\nThe real selling point is how faithful the redevelopment will be to the original: Goldfinger\u2019s colour-coded floors and doors return, as do steel Crittall windows and the marble entrance hall (its replacement marble flown in from Portugal with the approval of English Heritage).\n\nLiving spaces in Balfron Tower: left, as originally conceived, and right in the remodelled version. Photographs: courtesy of the Goldfinger family/Londonewcastle\n\nIndeed, the true value of Balfron on the real estate market is its symbolism, because this tower encapsulates the story of London\u2019s last 50 years better than almost any other building. Each decade of its existence captures the spirit of the age: from optimistic council estate in the 1960s to reviled brutalist bugbear in the 1970s; from right-to-buy individualist homeowning dream in the 1980s to crime hotspot in the 1990s; from being the target of commercial development in the 2000s to an artist-occupied embodiment of gentrification in the 2010s.\n\nBalfron\u2019s 27 storeys may have been eclipsed by higher towers, but it still stands as a huge physical and metaphorical gateway for London \u2013 between north and south, lording over the Blackwall tunnel under the Thames; between east and west London, where its sister building, the Trellick tower, looms like Isengard to its Barad-d\u00fbr; between London and the world, via the A13 road to the ports on the coast; and, more than anything, between the city\u2019s much mythologised East End of cockney traders and pie and mash, and the modern financial domination of Canary Wharf, less than half a mile away.\n\nNow, reflecting the way in which London\u2019s regeneration story has shifted from individual gentrification to huge district-area facelifts, Balfron\u2019s own facelift is the centrepiece of much wider plan. What is envisaged is nothing less than a large-scale and long-term regeneration of this entire district, an area that back when Balfron was built was accessible only by bus. Canary Wharf is coming for Poplar at last.\n\nA dining area available to new residents for larger-scale entertaining, created in a space that was once the tower\u2019s boiler room. Photograph: Londonewcastle\n\nThe architects and developers are acutely aware of the tension inherent in such a plan, and have taken pains to emphasise their commitment to community. \u201cIt was really important\u2026 that this was a building again, community-forming,\u201d says Londonewcastle\u2019s head of development, Baerbel Schuett. \u201cIt\u2019s owner-occupier. It\u2019s not going to be taken to any kind of far-east show. It is sold here in London.\u201d\n\nIt is nevertheless being sold to a particular clientele. One bedroom flats start at \u00a3365,000. In the marketing materials, the proximity of Canary Wharf is a major selling point.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame,\u201d says Sadler. \u201cI just feel like we all benefit from mixing up together, and I think what they are producing is something that will end up being exclusive.\u201d\n\nI was given an early look at the still-to-be-finished building, and was shown inside a large dining space that used to be the boiler room, located inside Balfron\u2019s distinctive thin concrete tower, which is connected to the main residential block by \u201cstreets in the sky\u201d walkways (Goldfinger\u2019s solution for distancing the apartments from mechanical noise). Among the gathered crowd were representatives from the architects, Ab Rogers and Egret West, who enthusiastically projected their vision of future residents filling the room with dinner guests.\n\nI am assured that the concierge will manage the bookings for the dining area, avoiding the kind of edgy bourgeois encounters that Ballard envisaged.\n\nPoplar: stuck in the middle\n\nYou could say Balfron died as soon as it was born.\n\nGoldfinger, a modernist architect from Hungary, was a Marxist who began designing the tower in 1963 as part of the wider Brownfield estate of council houses. Balfron was built to a \u2018scissor plan\u2019 \u2013 a way of interlocking flats to maximise space \u2013 and the design was generous: every apartment had dual aspect windows, welcoming sunrise to their bedrooms and sunset to their living rooms. The elegant yet imposing, burly yet intricate tower itself took the breath away, whether you liked it or not.\n\nWhen it opened in 1968, it was one of the tallest towers in Europe; Goldfinger and his wife moved into a flat on the 24th floor for two months, gleaning feedback from tenants by putting on lavish champagne parties.\n\nErno Goldfinger and his wife Ursula on the balcony of their flat in Balfron Tower. Photograph: Keystone/Getty Images\n\n\n\nThe almost immediate response from its vocal critics, however, was that in his feverish devotion to brutalism, Goldfinger had created a monster. \u201cThe first tower, although perversely beautiful, conjures up thoughts of prisons and pill-boxes,\u201d wrote Terence Bendixson in the Guardian in 1969. \u201cHere, too, vandalism is setting in.\u201d The timing was equally terrible: two days after Goldfinger\u2019s opening press conference in May 1968, the Ronan Point tower block in nearby Canning Town collapsed, undermining the supposed futurism of high-rise living.\n\nIn 1978, the East London Advertiser reported that Balfron residents felt isolated in the tower. Fifty-nine-year-old Harold Byford, who lived alone, said he felt like a \u201cbattery chicken in a box\u201d. Parents bemoaned a lack of playing space and the impossibility of children mixing between floors. In the 1990s it developed a bad drug problem, and by 2002 it was providing a gritty, shopping trolley-strewn stage for the zombie horror 28 Days Later. Ian Fleming hated Goldfinger so much that he named a Bond villain after him.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong,\u201d says Steve Stride as we climb to the roof of a nearby high-rise building last month to have a look at Balfron: a tower of scaffolding and sheeting as concrete is sandblasted and lifts made faster. \u201cA lot of people love [Balfron]. I take them round: \u2018Oh, isn\u2019t this fantastic? It\u2019s brutalist architecture!\u2019 \u2026 Well you\u2019re welcome to it.\u201d\n\nStride is the CEO of the powerful but little understood organisation that was behind the decision to turn Balfron into a luxury development: the Poplar Housing and Regeneration Community Association, better know as Poplar Harca.\n\nHarca was once a small housing association, set up by Tower Hamlets in 1996 with the explicit intention of reviving the area. But it has grown in stature as the plan to reshape Poplar has mushroomed, and it now has a hold on Poplar that feels rare in a London borough. Harca owns one third of Poplar\u2019s land and 75% of its housing stock as well as 16 community facilities, 13 community gardens and some roads and green spaces. And its remit to regenerate Poplar now includes not just Balfron but the regeneration of the whole Brownfield estate, as well as Aberfeldy estate and Chrisp Street Market.\n\nIn 1969, Terence Bendixson wrote of Balfron tower that it was \u2018perversely beautiful\u2019 but \u2018conjures up thoughts of prisons and pill-boxes\u2019. Photograph: Riba Collections\n\nMoreover, it is also trying to reshape the entire economy of this piece of cockney London. It wants to bring the rag trade back to the district by building a \u201cfashion hub\u201d, Poplar Works \u2013 a collaborative venture with the Trampery, a social enterprise for creatives, and London College of Fashion \u2013 that will turn old garages into more than 40 low-cost studios and workshops for early-stage fashion businesses.\n\nPoplar, Stride says, has long been \u201cstuck in the middle\u201d between booming examples of London regeneration and he is glad it is finally receiving a piece of the action. The regeneration is fuelled by Harca\u2019s quasi-Robin Hood business model, which seeks to generate as much value as possible from its assets. This means, for example, selling Balfron and building new private high-end flats at Chrisp Street Market, then using the money generated for social housing, upgrades to the area and helping new businesses set up, such as London\u2019s first Haitian cafe.\n\nFrom our vantage point on the roof, Stride gestures past Balfron to the totems of London\u2019s eastern facelift: Canary Wharf, the O2, the vast new housing developments at Canning Town. \u201cThere is lots of regeneration going on,\u201d he says. \u201cStratford is completely transformed of course, while we are the second most deprived area.\u201d In particular, he says, he wants a more genuine connection between Canary Wharf, with its bankers and high-end restaurants, and more working-class Poplar. \u201cWhat we are saying is: bring the jobs and the changes that you\u2019re benefiting from \u2013 we want it here as well!\u201d\n\nBalfron is the jewel in the crown, the centrepiece of this vision. The decision to sell it means Harca can help do all the simple things that make a working-class neighbourhood respectable, he says, such as cleaner streets and more parks, which will make residents feel safe and proud when walking through the area. He also said the cost of upkeep was prohibitive, that elderly people and families with kids suffer when they live so high up, and that crime was an issue, although steps had been taken to combat it. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a very good antisocial behaviour team and [resident-funded] police team, so the people who were throwing things out of their windows, we were able to get rid of them,\u201d he says.\n\nWe couldn\u2019t stop Balfron Tower from being privatised ... In fact we probably helped it along, by turning brutalism into a coffee-table fetish object Owen Hatherley\n\nThose apparently less salubrious residents aside, Harca made it a priority to rehouse \u2013 or \u201cdecant\u201d, in their parlance \u2013 all the former Balfron residents nearby. It claims that 95% of former residents were rehoused within Tower Hamlets (81% in Harca properties), and that approximately 35% of families were moved into a bigger property; 6% were downsized and the rest remained in comparable properties. New, lower-rise flats were built specifically for the former Balfron residents, and those residents who wanted to remain living in a brutalist block were moved into neighbouring Carradale, another Goldfinger-designed tower \u2013 their flats were bought by Harca using money from the government\u2019s Decent Homes programme.\n\n\u201cIs this all gentrified?,\u201d Stride asks, gesturing to the new low-rises flats. \u201cThis is all social rent and the quality is fantastic. Low-cost home ownership there. There\u2019s no way you can say that is gentrified. Then you\u2019ve got that tower in the corner. Then the rest is social rent. It\u2019s beautiful.\u201d\n\nColin Woollard, a Brownfield resident for 14 years and member of the estate board, which was involved in the regeneration, says Harca has facilitated four new parks and a school on the estate. \u201cWhat we have had, over the last 10 years, is a total refurbishment [of the housing],\u201d he said. \u201cWe only had an upstairs toilet, and I\u2019ve got a disabled child, so we got a downstairs toilet [put in]. [We have had] new kitchens \u2013 they are trying to bring up a nice standard of living.\u201d\n\nWoollard, like Stride, doesn\u2019t much like Balfron. \u201cI\u2019d rather demolish it, to be truthful \u2026 It was good for that time, but as the decades passed it was a paradise for drug deals and an assembly point for gangs and stuff like that.\u201d\n\nThe sale of Balfron provided Harca with money for more social housing and upgrades to public space in the area. Photograph: Sam Mellish/In Pictures via Getty Images\n\nFor those who have to leave their homes in Balfron, supposedly to make the maths work for the improvement of the rest of the neighbourhood, the thinking is that high-rise living has never been for everyone. Indeed, many rightly criticise earlier practices of housing people in towers who may not have wanted to live so high. And yet, not only did many people live happily in Balfron for decades, but now many others will pay top whack to live in it.\n\nThat Balfron is being readied for the luxury market, says John Boughton, the author of Municipal Dreams, a book on the story of UK council housing, \u201cis a backhanded compliment for the fact that actually it was just very good housing.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Balfron wasn\u2019t always vilified. For several decades it was considered by many to be a decent place to live. Sadler says it was only in the 1980s, after Margaret Thatcher abandoned the Greater London Council \u2013 the governing body of London that had overseen Balfron \u2013 that it began to go downhill, as the local council, Tower Hamlets, shouldered the burden.\n\nBut Balfron had long been lauded as a design success by the cultural establishment. It was listed in 1998, and acted as a post-industrial reference point to music videos by grime acts and indie bands.\n\nBrutalism became de rigeueur; concrete was cool.\n\n\u201cOK, so we couldn\u2019t stop Balfron Tower from being privatised and turned into luxury flats,\u201d wrote author Owen Hatherley, one of Harca\u2019s most vocal critics. \u201c[I]n fact we probably helped it along, by turning brutalism into a coffee-table fetish object.\u201d\n\nBalfron Tower was listed in 1998.\n\nThat process was crystallised in 2011: Harca invited artists to temporarily occupy the empty flats in a \u201cguardianship\u201d scheme in collaboration with Bow Arts Trust as the building was being emptied of its tenants. The artist Wane Hemingway made over Goldfinger\u2019s old flat, No 130, with retro stylings; Turner nominee Catherine Yass\u2019s \u201cPiano Falling\u201d would have seen her drop a piano from the 26th floor as a \u201cswan song\u201d for Balfron, before it was called off after a petition from local residents. An artist moved next door to Sadler\u2019s sons, who were living in the family flat. \u201cHe\u2019d come and knock on the door and want a chat. He was doing some project on extra terrestrials.\u201d\n\nTower Hamlets has always prided itself on being diverse and inclusive. Might I suggest that social cleansing in this way is the antithesis of that? Lord Cashman\n\nFor many, however, the scheme turned Balfron into a shorthand for \u201cartwashing\u201d: the practice of developers inviting artists to live in an area, giving it a vibrancy that raises property prices. One guardian, Rab Harling, entered Balfron in 2011 as an artist, and began a photography project to document the interior worlds of the flats. \u201cI wanted to turn the building inside out,\u201d he said. Instead, he began to learn more about the tenants compelled to leave the tower. He recorded some of their complaints in a short documentary that included claims from former residents of Balfron that they signed an agreement which stated that they could come back after refurbishment, only to be sent a letter by Harca a few months later reversing the decision. \u201cI know a few people, a lot of the old people, wanted to go back,\u201d one resident, Cindy, who lived there for 25 years, says in the film. \u201cI think they lie to you.\u201d Gavin, another former resident who was told he could stay, says his fortunes changed when housed in the tower in the 90s. \u201cI was homeless and I was really thankful for a place \u2026 now it\u2019s going to the richest of society.\u201d\n\nHarca\u2019s own regeneration consultation documents promised that \u201cno resident will lose their home involuntarily\u201d. In response to the claims made in the film, a Harca spokeperson said: \u201cWe know that some residents wanted to return to Balfron \u2013 it had been their home for a long time. However, speaking with those same residents now, most of whom are settled in next-door in Goldfinger\u2018s Carradale House, given the option they would now stay where they are.\u201d\n\nHarling, for his part, says he now feels that his presence as an artist was manipulated to encourage the social cleansing of the area, a strategy he describes as: \u201cGet the artists in there, push the property prices up, this is our flagship. This is jewel in the crown of the entire area, which is about to be developed all the way up to the River Lea\u201d (where another 30,000 new housing units are being built).\n\nIn 2013 Harling was evicted. He has since been homeless but continues to campaign against \u201cclass cleansing\u201d on his Twitter account, Balfron Social Club, which was denounced by the director of the V&A, Tristram Hunt, as \u201ckeyboard warriors and artwash agitators\u201d.\n\nYet it isn\u2019t only keyboard warriors who have criticised Harca\u2019s approach. The former Labour and now independent peer Lord Cashman made a stand against Harca\u2019s Balfron plans in November 2015: \u201cThere has been incredibly poor communication with, and an incredibly poor attitude towards, tenants and leaseholders from the current landlord Poplar Harca over the decant and refurbishment, with changing plans, the insidious decanting of tenants, years of delay and an eventual declaration that Balfron Tower would be 100% privatised,\u201d he said. \u201cTower Hamlets has always prided itself on being a diverse and inclusive borough. Might I suggest that social cleansing in this way is the antithesis of that?\u201d\n\n\u2018Regenerated or degenerated?\u2019\n\nStride takes me to a well-used, open-faced DLR station. \u201cI used to bring government ministers here,\u201d he says. \u201cThis was a narrow alleyway, people getting mugged ... a caged barbed wire bridge, it was awful. There was this massive issue about accessibility: because of the railways the rivers, the canals, the motorways, [the district] gets very easily divided.\u201d He says Tower Hamlets had promised a station in the early 80s, but London Transport reneged on it. Harca organised the community, says Stride. \u201c[They said] people won\u2019t use it, and it will delay the train times between Stratford and Canary Wharf. So that was a red rag to a bull. And we won. They now say it\u2019s the best station on the whole network ... if you were here late at night you\u2019d feel comfortable.\u201d It now has 120,000 users a month. \u201cThat type of intervention, that\u2019s what regeneration should be about.\u201d\n\n\u201cRegenerated, or degenerated?\u201d retorts Lorraine Paul when I ask her about Harca\u2019s plans for Chrisp Street market, where she runs Ivy\u2019s cafe. Ivy\u2019s has served pease pudding, faggots and saveloys here since it was built by Sir Frederick Gibberd over the site of the old market and opened as part of the Festival of Britain in 1951.\n\nChrisp Street market still has its characteristic pie and mash shops, but residents wonder if they survive the area\u2019s regeneration. Photograph: Simon Balson/Alamy\n\nChrisp Street market still clings on to its old character \u2013 its pie and mash shops, independent hardware stores and pubs \u2013 while integrating some of the newer elements: the Haitian coffee shop, an Idea Store (as libraries are now called), and a co-working space run by the London Small Business Centre, called Chrisp Street Exchange. The Lansbury Estate and other buildings built during the Festival of Britain will be spared. But the artist impressions Stride shows me of what the new parts of Chrisp Street will look like seem cookie-cutter, resembling any recently regenerated square or quarter of London once deemed unfashionable or dangerous \u2013 although a pie and mash shop has been allowed to remain.\n\nPaul doesn\u2019t think Ivy\u2019s will survive. The original building will be demolished next year as part of the regeneration and will not be replaced for another three years. During that time, the cafe will be moved to a new spot behind some barriers while the building work proceeds. The noise and dust will put off the customers, she predicts. Beyond that, she fears for the heart of the market.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like what\u2019s happening in this area any more. You ruin the East End. Just standardising every area to have a coffee shop, a wine bar, getting rid of all these markets that existed for years and years.\u201d\n\nShe believes the neglected condition of the market under Harca is intentional.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not gonna sell for \u00a31.5m when you look down on this shithole, are you? There\u2019s millions of mice and rats underneath this ground. The floor is collapsing because they live underneath and all the tiles keep collapsing down because they are digging tunnels.\u201d\n\nThe Chrisp Street Market as it currently is; newer elements such as a Haitian cafe have been incorporated already, but the regeneration project will mean wider changes. Photograph: Pat Tuson/Alamy\n\nHarca deny that they have neglected the market. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working hard to sustain the market with events, publicity and investment,\u201d insists a spokesperson. \u201cThe reason for the regeneration is because local people recognise that a significant intervention is necessary to protect the long-term future of the area \u2013 bringing new homes, jobs and energy to a much-loved community hub.\u201d\n\nPaul\u2019s home on the nearby Teviot estate is being knocked down and rebuilt, following a resident vote in May that saw 86% of residents vote for expansion. Residents have been told they will be able to return after being decanted. Paul is moving to the Isle of Wight.\n\nStride says his hero is George Lansbury, the architect of \u201cPoplarism\u201d, the 1920s movement demanding poor relief be shared equally across all London boroughs. Poplar back then was a poster child for urban poverty after the shipping industry declined, and Lansbury, whose rise contains echoes of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s, argued for direct action.\n\nStride says he is \u201csympathetic to a more radical approach\u201d, but suggests his hands are tied: even if Harca had wanted to renovate Balfron to include social housing, they would not have been given government funding to do so.\n\nAb Rogers, one of the architects, echoes that. He says he wishes he had the kind of backing that Goldfinger did. \u201cOf course, I think all of us, without doubt [wish that],\u201d he said. \u201cNever are we further from it than now.\u201d\n\nHe argues that the right-to-buy policy, which allowed council tenants to buy their property, \u201chad a huge amount to answer for as well, because any social housing that is good gets bought out.\u201d\n\nThe only solution, he says, is for the UK government to \u201cbuild a significant social housing programme \u2013 building in significant ways through real long-term solutions, not wrapping up old buildings in really bad cladding that then catches on fire.\u201d\n\nThe proximity of Canary Wharf to Balfron Tower is a selling point for the new development. Photograph: Ben Pipe Photography/Getty Images\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, Balfron will be lived in only by those who can afford it, likely to be employees in Canary Wharf or the City of London, people who pay their service charges without a fuss and presumably won\u2019t throw things out of the window. The implication is that Goldfinger\u2019s aspirant architecture is somehow a bit much for lower earners: the luxification of the tower suggests the windows let too much light in, its design is too desirably functional, its spaces are too full of promise and endeavour to be considered for universal consumption.\n\n'Delicate sense of terror': what does concrete do to our mental health? Read more\n\nI take a queasy ride on the workman\u2019s lift to the Balfron roof, where there is a breathtaking 360-degree view of London. Goldfinger\u2019s original working chimneys and ventilation shafts are gone; in their place will be a wild (but landscaped) meadow-style garden, with shrubs and hardy perennials \u2013 low-maintenance foliage that can withstand a battering from the weather. Goldfinger once said of his tower that \u201cit will help bring the countryside to London\u201d, a statement that spoke to the way the architect felt his buildings could open the city up to their residents. Balfron\u2019s new walled garden, on the other hand, speaks of a privatised city folding in on itself.\n\nFollow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter", "description": "The selloff of Erno Goldfinger\u2019s landmark building in Poplar is a central element of a new plan to transform London\u2019s East End", "authors": ["Tim Burrows"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/913bb70c1a7461ba5d919710c7b07165fde3a9b5/385_1415_4832_2899/master/4832.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=935cdebf2ff01be0c74b17f768b5f584", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
