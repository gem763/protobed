The event is co-organized by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, a non-profit focused on LGBTQ issues.\n\nThe town hall comes amidst increased U.S.-China tensions \u2014 a subject that hits close to home in the entertainment industry, which depends heavily on Chinese consumers to buy movie tickets and visit theme parks.\n\nHollywood executives have remained conspicuously quiet about U.S.-China relations in the wake of democracy protests in Hong Kong that have put global businesses including the NBA to Apple in a difficult spot.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has publicly hammered Biden over his close ties with China, accusing the former Vice President and his son, Hunter, of being \u201cpaid off\u201d by foreign interests.\n\nModerators of Thursday\u2019s town hall include CNN\u2019s Dana Bash, Anderson Cooper, Chris Cuomo, Don Lemon and Nia-Malika Henderson.\n\nSen. Harris (D-CA) reportedly attended a reception at The Abbey in West Hollywood on Wednesday, while Buttigieg is set to attend a fundraiser at the Belasco Theater in downtown L.A.\n\nDeadline reported earlier this week that Buttigieg attended a separate L.A. fundraiser on Tuesday at the home of former CAA agent Michael Kives, who is now head of the investment advisory firm K5 Global.\n\nCelebrities who were reportedly in attendance include Leonardo DiCaprio, Glenn Close, Ashton Kutcher and Paris Hilton.\n\nHollywood is a reliable fundraising pitstop for Democratic candidates.\n\nHillary Clinton made numerous L.A. visits in her failed 2016 bid for the White House, including events with mega donor and billionaire Haim Saban, the founder of Saban Entertainment.\n\nCNN\u2019s town hall is set to take place at the Novo, at the L.A. Live complex in downtown L.A.\n\nOther Democratic presidential hopefuls scheduled to appear include Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Beto O\u2019Rourke, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, Tom Steyer and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ).\n\nFollow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg. Have a tip?
