The ICC ACU is reliant on players to play a central part in the fight against corruption and I didn\u2019t do my duty in this instance,\u201d he said in a statement released by the ICC.\n\n\u201cLike the majority of players and fans around the world, I want cricket to be a corruption-free sport and I am looking forward to working with the ICC ACU team to support their education programme and ensure young players don\u2019t make the same mistake I did.\u201d", "description": "Shakib Al Hasan, the Bangladesh captain and the world\u2019s no 1 ranked all-rounder, has become one of the biggest names of recent years to be banned for corruption offences after the ICC announced he has been hit with a two-year suspension.", "authors": ["Nick Hoult", "Cricket News Correspondent", "Simon Briggs"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/cricket/2019/10/29/TELEMMGLPICT000214506008-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqPjDZOdMgceQ0ik-fUDgEduwf3DcmiwBH9GBJNOGGkTw.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
