In the UK, the number of vegans reportedly quadrupled between 2014 and 2018. Even fast-food giants are now offering vegan alternatives to meat. And here in Dubai, a restaurant billed as the world's largest vegan restaurant (\u2018Veganity\u2019) has just opened its doors.\n\nVeganity\u2019s founder Sky Sommer\u2019s business was borne of her desire to show people that having a plant-based diet does not have to be a sacrifice.\n\nWith over 200 dishes on the menu, everything from soul food to gourmet food are on offer. Sommer\u2019s favourite dish is Molokhia; a recipe which has its roots in Ancient Egypt.\n\n\u201cIt's actually the name of a leaf; a greeny leaf that looks like spinach. So you just put olive oil, onions and garlic and coriander. This is what gives it that kick. Tomato paste, white vinegar, vegetable stock. Once you add the molokhia and the tomato paste you just let it boil to render down a bit. It becomes a bit thick and then you just get a hand blender.\u201d\n\nBelow we've provided a delicious Vegan recipe for you to try at home.\n\nRecipe Laham Ajeen\n\nChop tomatoes x4\n\nDiced onions x2\n\nGarlic diced x8\n\nParsley chopped x1 bunch\n\nRed capsicum small squares x1\n\nGreen capsicum small squares x1\n\nMinced meat (TVP) 250g\n\nCook all together with 3-4 tablespoons of olive oil for around 10 minutes then add the spices below until they are well combined:\n\nPaprika x 4 tablespoons\n\n7 spices x 4 tablespoons\n\nGarlic powder x 2 tablespoons\n\nVegan Worcester sauce x 1 tablespoons\n\nTomato paste x 4 tablespoons\n\nVegetable stock x 1 cup\n\nLeave to marinate for up to 1 hour stirring it every 15 min till all liquids have dissolved then serve with half a lemon slice.\n\nThe dough\n\n5 cups of flour of choice\n\n2 cups water\n\nPinch of salt\n\nSieve the flour into a bowl\n\nAdd the salt\n\nSlowly add the water bit by bit while mixing the dough, cover and let rest for 30 minutes in a cool place then roll out to a clean surface and need for 5 min.
