This is the answer \u2014 for now and decades in the future", "language": "en", "published_at": "2019-09-03", "text": "Predictions about the economic impact of a no-deal Brexit have ranged from the apocalyptic to \u201cno big deal.\u201d Indeed, some fringe economists have even suggested that no deal would boost the UK economy. And while no credible analysis supports this view, there is huge uncertainty \u2013 particularly in the short term.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean that economics has nothing useful to say, or that there isn\u2019t consensus among credible economists about the likely consequences. As our report on the impacts and implications of no deal shows, the imposition of tariff and non-tariff barriers between the UK and its largest trading partner will be a major shock to the UK economy.\n\nWe can also identify the sectors \u2013 the car industry, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, food from agriculture, and so on \u2013 that are likely to be most affected, although we can\u2019t predict just how serious any additional disruption and delays at key ports will be.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBeyond that, the fall in the pound \u2013 most if not all of which will be priced in well before 31 October \u2013 will push up inflation and, as after the referendum, reduce real wages. We can also be reasonably certain that some things won\u2019t happen \u2013 the financial system won\u2019t collapse, the stock market won\u2019t crash, and interest rates won\u2019t skyrocket. And policy can, and in all likelihood will, respond \u2013 the government will probably increase spending and perhaps cut taxes, while the Bank of England will, if necessary, cut rates.\n\nBut the big question in the short term is what happens to business and consumer confidence \u2013 Keynes\u2019 famous \u201canimal spirits.\u201d Pre-referendum forecasts assumed that a Leave vote would mean a big and lasting hit, depressing consumer spending and business investment. In fact, when it became clear nothing much would change in the short term, confidence quickly recovered. If Brexit \u2013 indeed, the hardest possible Brexit \u2013 becomes a reality, will this time be different?\n\nThat is likely to depend on just how severe the immediate disruption to trade is, but also on political developments and public perceptions. There are no economists, or anyone else, who can reliably forecast these.\n\nSo the bottom line is that the immediate impact of no deal will be a major economic shock. A recession is very much a possibility \u2013 but its depth and severity are uncertain.\u200b\n\nThe UK economy will, however, eventually adjust, one way or the other, to the new realities of life outside the EU. And here there is greater certainty about the economic impact of Brexit. At the most basic level, leaving the EU will make the UK poorer because it will make it harder for UK firms and consumers to do business with European countries, as well as reducing labour mobility between the UK and the EU.\n\nAnd leaving the EU with a no-deal Brexit will be more costly than doing so with a deal which allows us to stay in the EU\u2019s customs union or single market. These costs won\u2019t just fall on the UK \u2013 the EU will also lose from Brexit, but the costs will be much smaller relative to the size of its economy because we are far more dependent on trade with the EU27 than vice versa.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. \u2018Brexit is like...\u2019 The Top 20 Twitter analogies Show all 20 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.\" Shutterstock / sasha2109\n\nOur earlier research analysed the long-run effects of trading with the EU on World Trade Organisation (WTO) terms. We found that, after 10 years, a WTO Brexit would reduce the UK\u2019s income per capita by between 3.5 per cent and 8.7 per cent. The government\u2019s own modelling exercise produced similar results.\n\nForecasts are uncertain \u2013 and here, in addition to the normal uncertainties inherent in long-term economic modelling, there are additional ones about future policy.\n\nFor example, both the UK and US governments have signalled their intentions to negotiate a speedy trade deal. But \u2013 even leaving aside the political difficulties \u2013 it is likely that any benefits will be relatively small. The EU accounts for around half of UK trade, more than three times as much as the US. And standard free trade agreements do less to reduce trade barriers than the deep integration that is the hallmark of the EU single market.\n\nThe government\u2019s own analysis said that, even on optimistic assumptions about the number of deals that could be concluded over the next decade, the impact would be very small: overall, new trade deals could boost GDP by between 0.2 per cent and 0.7 per cent of GDP in the long term.\n\nOther policy changes to mitigate the negative impacts are also possible. Theresa May\u2019s departure opens the way for a more liberal immigration policy than that suggested in the Immigration White Paper, which could boost economic performance; although the new home secretary, Priti Patel, has signalled her intention to pursue a relatively restrictive policy, which would have the opposite effect.\n\nOur research suggested that the White Paper proposals would reduce GDP by up to 1.8 per cent over 10 years. And it is conceivable that Brexit \u2013 and in particular the economic impact of a no-deal Brexit \u2013 might provide the impetus for government to address some of the longer-term issues, such as the lack of public investment in infrastructure and poor provision of training and skills, that have contributed to the UK\u2019s poor productivity performance.\n\nHowever, overall, there is little doubt that, whatever else may happen over the next decade, a no-deal Brexit will be a persistent drag on the UK\u2019s economic growth for years to come.\n\nJonathan Portes is a senior fellow at The UK in a Changing Europe and Professor of economics and public policy at Kings College London.
