A third-round pick or better, per Schefter:\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nDenver traded fellow veteran receiver Demaryius Thomas to the Texans last year for a 2019 fourth-round pick, and sources tell ESPN that the Broncos are expected to be seeking a higher form of compensation for Sanders, who is in the last year of his contract.\n\nSchefter also listed several teams \"expected to be in the wide receiver market,\" and the New England Patriots were among those clubs.\n\nThe Patriots definitely would benefit from adding a wide receiver before the trade deadline.\n\nVeteran wideout Josh Gordon will miss Monday night's Week 7 game against the New York Jets because of a knee injury. Phillip Dorsett missed New England's Week 6 win with a hamstring injury, and he's questionable to play versus the Jets. Reigining Super Bowl MVP Julian Edelman also has been banged up a bit this season, although he has not missed a game.\n\nMaking matters worse for New England is its lack of offensive production at tight end. And now, injuries also are a concern at the position. The Patriots already have ruled out tight ends Matt LaCosse (knee) and Ryan Izzo (concussion) for Monday's matchup in New York, leaving 38-year-old Benjamin Watson atop the tight end depth chart.\n\nStory continues\n\nSanders and Cincinnati Bengals star A.J. Green are two of the most popular wide receivers involved in trade rumors entering the deadline. Green has battled an ankle injury all season and has yet to play in 2019. Sanders, meanwhile, has played in all seven of Denver's games with 30 receptions for 367 yards and two touchdowns. He can play outside or in the slot, and we know Patriots head coach Bill Belichick values versatility quite a bit.\n\nThe Patriots must decide if adding a player of Sanders' caliber is worth the cost required to bring him to New England. The Patriots are 6-0, but there are genuine concerns about their depth at wide receiver. Taking a chance on Sanders, even at the cost of a valuable draft pick, does make sense because New England should do all it can to maximize what's left of quarterback Tom Brady's career.\n\nClick here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!
