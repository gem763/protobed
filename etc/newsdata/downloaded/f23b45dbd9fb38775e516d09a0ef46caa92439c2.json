Now she\u2019s charged in his suicide.", "language": "en", "text": "On Monday, the Suffolk County district attorney charged You, also a Boston College student at the time, with involuntary manslaughter in Urtula\u2019s suicide \u2014 a case that closely mirrors that of Michelle Carter, who was convicted of the same crime in 2017 after encouraging her boyfriend to kill himself.\n\nAD\n\nYou, 21, had \u201ccomplete and total control\u201d over Urtula, 22, during their 18-month relationship, often using text messages and threats of self harm to manipulate him, said Rachael Rollins, the district attorney.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMany of the messages clearly display the power dynamic in the relationship wherein Ms. You made demands and threats with the understanding that she had complete and total control over Mr. Urtula, both mentally and emotionally,\u201d Rollins said at a news conference.\n\nIndicting a Former Boston College Student for Boyfriend\u2019s Suicide Investigators with our office and the MBTA Transit Police determined that, for 18 months, former Boston College student Inyoung You was physically, verbally and psychologically abusive towards her boyfriend Alexander Urtula and that she was present at the time of his death. Today we announced an indictment charging her with involuntary manslaughter. Posted by Suffolk County District Attorney's Office on Monday, October 28, 2019\n\nThe abuse became \u201cmore frequent, more powerful and more demeaning in the days and hours leading up to\u201d Urtula\u2019s death, Rollins said. In the two months prior, the couple exchanged more than 75,000 text messages, and at least 47,000 came from You \u2014 a stream of unrelenting abuse, the district attorney said.\n\nAD\n\nIn those messages, Rollins said, You encouraged Urtula to kill himself hundreds, perhaps thousands, of times, telling him to \u201cgo die\u201d and saying she, his family and the world would be better off without him.\n\nThe abuse was also documented in Urtula\u2019s journal and by both their classmates and family members, who said they witnessed the abuse, Rollins said.\n\nAD\n\nYou, who studied economics, withdrew from classes at Boston College in August, school spokesman Jack Dunn said. She was scheduled to graduate in May 2020. She\u2019s now in South Korea, where she\u2019s from, and The Washington Post could not reach her for comment.\n\nRollins said her office is in contact with someone who is representing You, but she did not disclose the attorney\u2019s name. Authorities are hopeful she will return voluntarily, but if she doesn\u2019t, Rollins said, they will \u201cutilize the power we have to get her back,\u201d including by extradition.\n\nAD\n\nThe district attorney said some of this case\u2019s basic facts were similar to the Carter case: Both occurred in Massachusetts and both carried allegations of a young woman encouraging her boyfriend to kill himself.\n\nCarter, who was 17 when Conrad Roy III killed himself in 2014, urged him in text messages to go through with it. But in that case, Rollins said, Carter and Roy had limited physical contact.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe have, quite frankly I would say, the opposite of that,\u201d Rollins said. \u201cWe have a barrage, a complete and utter attack on this man\u2019s very will and conscience and psyche by an individual to the tune of 47,000 messages.\u201d\n\nTo reach the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, call 1-800-273-TALK (8255). You can also text a crisis counselor by messaging 741741.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Authorities say Inyoung You often used text messages and threats of self harm to manipulate her boyfriend, Alexander Urtula, who killed himself on the day of his college graduation.", "authors": ["Reis Thebault", "National", "Breaking News Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/EEHH7wVo86BWMA_YQ9SryeaWscA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AGZJELQZO5FC3LIGF3XGZX2QN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
