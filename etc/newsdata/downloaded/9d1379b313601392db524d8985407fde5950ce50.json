In fact, 63 percent of millennials are starting or have already incorporated unprocessed or plant-based foods into their diets.\n\nThis coincides with a recent finding that millennials aren't drinking as much alcohol, but they are drinking higher-quality booze, according to one executive from a best-selling premium vodka brand.\n\n\u201cThey kind of move away from beer towards wine and spirits,\u201d said Grey Goose North America Vice President Martin de Dreuille during an interview on FOX Business\u2019 \u201cMornings with Maria.\u201d \u201cWhat they want to find out is what are these brands and these products with the best ingredients because they want to know what they drink ... They really are much more conscious about their drinking.\u201d\n\nThe survey found a majority of millennials are reading labels closely and are buying more organic food.\n\nDespite that, more than half of millennials found sticking to an alternative diet, such as Keto, Whole30, plant-based or vegan is too inconvenient so they are willing to pay more for more convenient options, such as ready-made meals.\n\nBut when it comes to healthy ready-made meals, another thing millennials are looking for is how their food impacts the environment.\n\nA majority of millennials try to find food packaging that's more sustainable.\n\nNearly seven in 10 millennials spent more on their food than they did on travel in the past year.\n\nSome attributed that to the fact that they considered themselves \"adventurous\" eaters and 60 percent said they cooked brand new dishes often.\n\nCLICK TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nThe survey, conducted by YouGov, spoke to more than 1,000 adults between the ages of 22 and 37.", "description": "Transparency and quality are what millennials are looking for when they head to the grocery store.", "authors": ["Blair Shiff"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/iStock-855628408.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
