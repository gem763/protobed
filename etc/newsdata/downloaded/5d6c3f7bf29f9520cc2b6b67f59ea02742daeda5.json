Goodwin alleged that the school also had placed a mat on the floor in case the boy needed to nap.\n\n\"I was stunned,\" Goodwin told KOMO News. \u201cI was so shocked that I just took the picture because I didn't believe what I was seeing.\u201d\n\nLucas said the arrangement had scared him and he \u201cthought this was going to be where I was for the rest of the year.\n\nGoodwin said she took her son out of school because the faculty provided no alternative to the arrangement.\n\n\u201cWe are still waiting to hear from the district,\u201d she said.\n\nAmid outrage on social media, Superintendent Greg Baker released a statement explaining that limited funding for schools has created \u201climited space to meet students\u2019 instructional and social-emotional needs.\u201d\n\nTEXAS HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT ARRESTED AFTER HITTING PRINCIPAL, THREATENING SCHOOL SHOOTING\n\n\u201cThis current situation is an example of staff trying to seek a solution to temporarily repurpose a room. To our knowledge, the room had been used as a storage, not as an active restroom,\u201d the statement read. \u201cAgain, my preliminary assessment is this idea was well-intentioned, but in the end we did not move forward with it.\u201d\n\nThe Bellingham School District said in a separate statement that it continued to look into the matter and that the desk has been removed.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201c[I]t appears that the restroom was set up as a possible separate quiet learning space, but no student was placed in there. The desk has been removed, and staff at the school are aware that the space should not be used for that purpose in the future,\u201d district officials said.\n\nGoodwin has acknowledged the desk\u2019s removal but added: \u201cthat doesn\u2019t help my son\u2019s self-esteem, his embarrassment.\u201d", "description": "A middle school in Washington state came under fire this week for allegedly planning to move an autistic student with special needs into a bathroom so he could be insulated from loud noises, according to reports.", "authors": ["Bradford Betz", "Bradford Betz Is An Editor For Fox News.
