The equivalent US bond in early September fell below 1.5 per cent. Now, Aussie 10-year notes yield almost 1.1 per cent and US Treasuries 1.8 per cent.\n\nHigher long-term rates are a sign of growing confidence in future growth and inflation. This feeds into demand for cyclical businesses which need both.\n\nCrucially, the US Treasury yield curve is no longer inverted. Ten-year yields moved above their three-month equivalents for the first time since May. This has lifted hopes that this historically unerring signal of an imminent US recession may prove unreliable in an era of central bank-manipulated bond markets.\n\nSince the middle of the month, value stocks such as British bank CYBG, money managers IOOF and Perpetual, nickel miner Western Areas, coal producer Whitehaven Coal, and retailer JB Hi-Fi have performed strongly, the MS analysts note.\n\n\"Based on recent client debate we detect that this is counter consensus to current positioning.\"\n\nIndeed, around the world money has been pouring into economically sensitive assets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince Treasury yields troughed in early September, global banks have jumped by 11 per cent. The export-exposed stockmarkets of Japan and South Korea are up 10 per cent and 7 per cent, respectively. In commodities, oil is 5 per cent higher since yields bottomed and copper, famous as a proxy for global industrial activity, is up by a similar margin.\n\nSo markets are pricing in an inflection point in the narrative around global growth: from recession fears to hopes of some stabilisation.\n\n\"Like high school, investing involves an inordinate amount of interest in, and time spent, talking about what other people may be up to,\" Morgan Stanley chief cross asset strategist Andrew Sheets says.\n\nEncouraging signs\n\n\"Unlike high school, it\u2019s for a good reason,\" he continues. \"Sentiment is among the most powerful forces in the market.\"\n\nAre investors getting ahead of themselves? I would say so.\n\nThe economic data offers only pallid support for a headlong rush back into cyclical sectors or value trades.\n\nLast week's early, or \"flash\", readings of global manufacturing activity showed encouraging signs of stabilisation in October. But leading indicators of employment and business investment are still declining in the US, with the former hitting its lowest since 2009.\n\nDevelopments in the two biggest geopolitical threats have also fed the more upbeat tone in markets. The British government may not have been able to get its withdrawal agreement with the EU over the line in Parliament, but the risk of a damaging \"no-deal\" exit has dwindled and allowed investors to price out the risk of a worst-case scenario.\n\nThe US-China trade conflict remains much more of a concern. Negotiations may again be under way, but tariffs are still in place, and meaningful progress likely to remain elusive. It will take a lot to improve business confidence and get them investing.\n\nUntil that happens, there's only so far these winds can carry investors.", "description": "After a fraught August, a palpable shift in mood among investors has put stocks back within reach of record highs.
