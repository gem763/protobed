It has foldable, ridged composite rotor blades that create less downwash when it lowers to the ground to drop off or pick off soldiers and supplies. Defiant is also designed to be efficient when transporting soldiers \u2013 the cabin seats 12 people comfortably or eight medevac pallets - the Blackhawk can only carry 11 soldiers. And there is weapon employments in all modes of flight.\n\n'The primary advantage that Defiant's going to offer over a traditional helicopter is, it's got twice the speed, two to three times the range, and is just an extremely maneuverable and agile platform,' said retired Marine Maj. Frank P. Conway, Sikorsky's experimental test pilot for both the SB>1 and the V-22 Osprey tiltrotor, when the concept was first unveiled.\n\nHe called the Defiant 'a very hot, sexy aircraft.'\n\nSikorsky, a subsidiary of Lockheed Martin, and Boeing are partners on SB>1 DEFIANT, as well as Future Vertical Lift Medium.\n\nThe Defiant would cruise at 250 knots and hover at altitudes of 6,000 feet.\n\nThis is more than a hundred miles an hour faster than the UH-60M Blackhawk transport, as it maxes out at 183 miles an hour.\n\nIt will also have the strength and power to carry more cargo than the average helicopters, but Lockheed is not giving all of its secrets away \u2013 it has yet to release the range and payload capacity.\n\nHowever, the firm is boasting about the machine's innovated design.\n\nThe 'warcopter' would be equipped with foldable, ridged composite rotor blades that create less downwash when it lowers to the ground to drop off or pick off soldiers and supplies.\n\nAnd the pusher propeller and active rudders will provider pilots with more stability when hovering, as a well a helping them quickly accelerate and decelerate while in flight.\n\nThe fly-by-wire concept, designed with two coaxial rotors and a pusher propeller, is said to speed through the air at nearly 300 mph and hover like a hummingbird.\n\nThe 'warcopter' would be equipped with foldable, ridged composite rotor blades that create less downwash when it lowers to the ground to drop off or pick off soldiers and supplies.\n\nDefiant is designed to be more efficient when transporting soldiers \u2013 the cabin seats 12 people comfortably or eight medevac pallets - the Blackhawk can only carry 11 soldiers.\n\nAnd there is weapon employments in all modes of flight.\n\nLockheed also shared that the Defiant can also 'dramatically reduced acoustic signature', which means it is much quieter than traditional helicopters and can go undetected by surrounding enemies.\n\nLockheed Martin\u2019s Sikorsky and the Boeing Co. are still fabricating parts for the first Defiant, which is their entrant in the Army-run Joint Multi-Role Technology Demonstration (JMR TD) program.", "description": "Called SB>1 Defiant, the radical craft is being built by Lockheed Martin and Sikorsky - and has been revealed for the first time.
