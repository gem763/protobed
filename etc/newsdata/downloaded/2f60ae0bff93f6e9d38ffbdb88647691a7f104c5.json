For the hundreds of thousands of Iowans who congregated on the capital\u2019s 300-acre fairgrounds for the annual festival of fried foods, carnival rides and farm animals, this is the slightly uncomfortable moment when they become more than just fun-seeking Midwesterners but bellwether voters, not just anonymous attendees but an attraction themselves for nearly two dozen Democratic candidates and the horde of media following them.\n\nOver a weekend of record-breaking attendance, POLITICO Magazine wandered the crowd hoping to see this staple of presidential campaigning from the perspective of native Iowans, who less than six months from now will cast votes in the state\u2019s first in the nation caucuses. We talked to blue-haired Bernie supporters, suspender-wearing Republicans and livestock-loving teens. And just as some carnival attendees get a rush from clashing bumper cars while others prefer the more sedate ferris wheel, some people love the drama and excitement the dueling politicians and their supporters bring while others hate the distraction of the political sideshow. Some were altogether indifferent, including many Trump supporters who could care less this year as Democrats vie for support in a state that in 2016 went for the president by nearly double-digits. No matter where they fall on the political spectrum, there was near universal agreement that this year\u2019s atmosphere feels more politically-charged than ever before. These are the faces of the people on the frontlines of one of America\u2019s most celebrated campaign stops\u2014whether they like it or not.", "description": "At the Iowa State Fair, presidential candidates vie for voters\u2019 attention.
