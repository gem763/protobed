Sacoolas, 42, who is married to an American diplomat, admitted that she was responsible for the crash, but fled the U.K. to the U.S. after apparently claiming diplomatic immunity, which protects diplomats and their family members from prosecution or lawsuits under the host nation's laws.\n\nHer attorney, Amy Jeffress, has said her client wants to meet with the family to apologize and take responsibility. Dunn's parents told ABC News that they would only meet with her if she returned to the U.K. to face the consequences of her actions.\n\nMichael Reynolds/POOL/EPA-EFE/REX via Shutterstock\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump suggested that British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who made a public plea for Sacoolas to return to the U.K., asked Trump would organize the meeting between Sacoolas and the Dunn family.\n\nPresident Trump says that he spoke with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who asked him if he would meet with Harry Dunn's family at the White House: \"The people were lovely, they were very nice and they were desperately sad\" https://t.co/7pAtaDH0b9 pic.twitter.com/XVy6emkrwb \u2014 ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) October 16, 2019\n\n\"I offered to bring the person in question in and they weren't ready for it, but I did offer,\" Trump said. \"I spoke with Boris, he asked me if I'd do that, and I did it.\"\n\nDunn's parents traveled to Washington on Tuesday, after receiving a call from the White House to say that they would be meeting with a senior official regarding their case.\n\n\"We had no idea,\" said Charlotte Charles. \"Certainly didn't think for a second it would be President Trump.\"", "description": "", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/trump-oval-02-ss-jt-191016_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
