In just 11 years, Ralph & Russo has not only transformed couture \u2013 in 2014 they became the first British-based house in a century, and the only Australians ever, deemed skilled enough to show during Paris Haute Couture Week \u2013 but has set about building an empire, product category by product category, armed with talent, nous and unlimited ambition.\n\nMeghan Markle\u2019s choice of engagement gown helped rocket Ralph & Russo to global fame. AAP\n\nIf you didn\u2019t know their name before, you did in 2017, when Meghan Markle donned a sheer bodice and black tulle Ralph & Russo gown for her official engagement photos with Prince Harry. The rumour mill subsequently swirled around Markle\u2019s choice of wedding dress \u2013 Ralph & Russo were odds-on favourites, but French label Givenchy won out (about which I\u2019ve been forbidden to ask).\n\n\u201cDo have a cake,\u201d says Ralph, gesturing towards a silver tray. It\u2019s easy to see why the Brisbane-raised Russo (in Tom Ford blazer and jeans) has called his fianc\u00e9e the embodiment of the Ralph & Russo woman. Elegant and focused, Ralph is a vision in heels and black silk coat gown, diamond studs on her ears, gold Rolex around her wrist, her hair honey-streaked and bouncy.\n\nShe always presents this immaculately to clients, sketching out ideas using skills that were nurtured by her mother and grandmother \u2013 both former couturiers \u2013 as a girl growing up in beachside Cronulla, Sydney.\n\nThe young Tamara sold her first piece aged 12 and made clothes for friends and private clients as a teenager, honing her craft with a degree at Whitehorse Institute of Design in Surry Hills, her mind\u2019s eye on the catwalks of Paris. \u201cBack then, the sort of couture art pieces we do now were my passion,\u201d she says of Ralph & Russo\u2019s feminine, golden-era silhouettes with their emphasis on the waist. \u201cI knew I wanted to work overseas.\n\nWe decided to build a global luxury brand organically, and the smartest way was to start at the top with couture. \u2014 Michael Russo, Ralph & Russo\n\n\u201cLuckily, I\u2019m a big believer in fate,\u201d she adds, throwing Russo a smile.\n\nIn 2006, four hours into her first visit to London, Ralph was walking down Chelsea\u2019s Kings Road when she bumped into Russo, an investment banker, and they started chatting. A year later, they were living in leafy Richmond, in a flat with a spare room just big enough for a mannequin and a sewing machine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 was one of Ralph & Russo's first customers. AP\n\n\u201cI\u2019d never thought about going into fashion until Tamara compelled me into it,\u201d grins Russo. \u201cWe decided to build a global luxury brand organically, and the smartest way was to start at the top with couture and get on a par with the big names as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\nWhen Ralph wore a self-made gown \u2013 \u201ca backless halter neck with embroidery detail, very clean and classic\u201d \u2013 to a black-tie event, a wealthy high-profile woman (they\u2019re not saying who) put in an order.\n\nOne client became 10, then 50. Within a year, Beyonc\u00e9 and Angelina Jolie were calling. Today, they have thousands of clients including babies, grandmothers and new brides (\u201cbridal is a large part of the business\u201d); their 2016 couture show closed with a gigantic wedding dress that took 50 people to create. They employ 312 people, including an atelier team with 45 nationalities, and keep growing out of their offices.\n\nKylie Minogue attends the 2015 Vanity Fair Oscar Party in a Ralph & Russo dress. Alamy\n\nTheir London base has proved convenient for an international clientele with homes and children at school in the capital, and younger women from emerging markets \u2013 China, Russia, the Middle East \u2013 who come to London to shop. \u201cThey used to have to go to Paris to see these gowns,\u201d says Russo. \u201cWe flipped it and made it easier for them to interact with the product.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, Ralph & Russo diversified into the ready-to-wear market. \u201cThe Angelina is a bestseller,\u201d says Ralph, indicating a silver asymmetric gown displayed on a nearby mannequin, as originally worn in black satin by Angelina Jolie at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival and later by the couple\u2019s great friend, Kylie Minogue, in dusky pink.\n\nFragrance, eyewear and beauty products are in the works. There are plans for boutiques in New York and Miami, and further down the track, in Sydney: \u201cAustralia has really developed as a market in terms of luxury,\u201d says Ralph. \u201cWhen I grew up there was one Chanel store and that was it. Now there are all these luxury brands offering beautiful retail experiences.\u201d\n\nRusso nods. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at Australia as a destination flagship, especially because we\u2019re seeing a lot of sales online, which also reflects the camaraderie many Australians feel towards other Australians who have succeeded globally.\u201d\n\nYou have certainly done that, I say, and they laugh good-naturedly. \u201cWe\u2019ve been fortunate,\u201d replies Ralph. \u201cBut there\u2019s so much more to do.\u201d", "description": "From Cronulla to high couture: Tamara Ralph and Michael Russo are transforming fashion with an easy charm that\u2019s a winner with A-listers, including Meghan Markle.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1751%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_97%2C$y_139/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/9293064794369b1b7144b1efff84424518cd54d5", "published_at": "2019-05-27"}
