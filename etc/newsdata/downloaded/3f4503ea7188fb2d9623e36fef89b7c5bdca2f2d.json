REUTERS/Anindito Mukherjee/File Photo\n\nSpot LNG prices have more than halved since last year due to oversupply as producers battle for market share.\n\nThe Indian market looks set to grow, however.\n\nThe country is investing $60 billion in gas infrastructure, including setting up cross country pipelines and LNG import terminals to connect gas-starved regions to supply hubs.\n\nOil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan has said that by the end of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s current term in 2024, India will be ready with a cross country natural gas grid.\n\n\u201cIndia is emerging as a major demand centre for gas. India is going to be a very exciting market ... We see it as an important energy market for decades to come,\u201d Peter Clarke, senior vice president - global LNG at Exxon Mobil Corp told Reuters at the India Energy Forum by CERA Week, on Monday.\n\nExxon has a deal to supply LNG to Petronet LNG Ltd, India\u2019s biggest gas importer, under a long term agreement from its Gorgon Project in Australia.\n\nClarke said Exxon was signing gas supply deals with various parties and was keen to strengthen its foothold in India, which needs fuel to power its economic expansion.\n\nIndia\u2019s current gas consumption is not a true reflection of its demand potential as the nation lacks infrastructure to transport gas. Most of its LNG import infrastructure is located in the western part, leading to higher gas consumption there compared with the rest of country.\n\nTotal SA said on Monday it was buying a 37.4% stake in private Indian gas distribution company Adani Gas Ltd. The French company also said it would explore opportunities in Adani Group\u2019s LNG terminals in the east and west coast.\n\n\u201cWe want to bring competitive LNG to India,\u201d said Total Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanne.\n\nPouyanne added that one of the reasons Total recently bought a major LNG project offshore Mozambique was because the project was \u201cperfectly positioned to deliver LNG to India very efficiently.\u201d\n\nTotal has committed to investing $600 million in India\u2019s gas business and \u201cthere is more to come,\u201d Pouyanne said.\n\nIndia\u2019s gas demand is expected to double to 75 billion cubic metres by 2030, energy consultancy firm Wood Mackenzie said on Monday.\n\nLNG will account for half of this demand, or equivalent to 10% of today\u2019s global LNG market, the consultancy firm said.\n\nGlobal majors are also bullish on India\u2019s domestic gas production and hope it will complement imported LNG to meet the growing need of cleaner fuels than coal and oil.\n\nIndia allows higher prices for natural gas produced from difficult and challenging fields and gives companies a freedom to sell it without federal intervention at best prices.\n\n\u201cI believe that there is close to 100 tcf (trillion cubic feet) of natural gas resources yet to be found below ground here in India,\u201d said Bob Dudley, CEO of British oil firm BP Plc.\n\nBP, in a tie up with Reliance Industries, is investing $5 billion in India\u2019s east coast to produce gas from April-May, he said.\n\n\u201cThat in itself can meet half of the natural gas demand out to 2050,\u201d Dudley added, referring to India\u2019s gas reserves.", "description": "Global oil and gas majors are looking to India, the world's third biggest oil importer, to buy some of their excess liquefied natural gas (LNG) as the South Asian nation improves its gas infrastructure and strives to reduce emissions.", "authors": ["Nidhi Verma", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440751818&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D180", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
