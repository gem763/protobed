Ikuma will host the Wizards Global Podcast and the Wizards Players\u2019 Diaries video series, which will target a Japanese audience.\n\nGeneral manager Tommy Sheppard said Hachimura\u2019s following in Japan is only going to grow.\n\n\u201cI think the NBA, the Wizards, we have a responsibility to grow basketball around the world, and the best way to do that is to be really good at what we do on the floor, obviously,\u201d Sheppard said. \u201cBut I think (Hachimura) feels a responsibility and a platform to bring attention to Japan and to Japanese basketball. I salute him for that and we\u2019re going to support him in any way we can.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
