Indigenous-led protests brought down three presidents in the years before Correa\u2019s rule.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Demonstrators and riot police clash in Quito.

It followed days of violence in which protesters burned military vehicles, destroyed dozens of rose farms, a dairy and an oil production facility. The outnumbered security forces have been unable to prevent much of the destruction.\n\nThe vandalism was an \u201cattempt to take over the seat of parliament\u201d, Ecuador\u2019s congress said afterwards.\n\nThe petrol and diesel subsidies had cost the country close to US$1.4bn (\u00a31.1bn) annually, according to official sources. They were lifted last Tuesday as part of a US$4.2bn loan deal with the International Monetary Fund reached last year that hinges on belt-tightening reforms.\n\nThe move sparked nationwide protests as prices rose overnight by about a quarter for petrol and double for diesel. A state of emergency was imposed on Thursday. Lorry and taxi drivers forced a partial shutdown of Quito\u2019s airport and roadblocks have paralysed trunks roads across the country.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Trucks block main roads near Quito during protests in Ecuador.

Two dozen police officers have been injured and a man died when he was hit by a car but an ambulance was unable to reach him due to the demonstrations, said the government.\n\nMoreno was shot in 1998 in an attempted robbery and thereafter has used a wheelchair. He was elected in 2017 as the candidate for Correa\u2019s centre-left party but has since moved to the right. Though he enjoys the support of business and the military, Moreno\u2019s popularity has sunk to under 30%, compared with 70% in 2017.\n\nAs well as ending fuel subsidies, the government is reducing the state workforce and planning some privatisations.\n\nIn a tweet, Juan Guiad\u00f3, Venezuela\u2019s self-proclaimed interim leader, accused a \u201cgroup financed by [Nicol\u00e1s] Maduro\u2019s accomplices\u201d of fuelling unrest, echoing conspiracy accusations against Guiad\u00f3\u2019s socialist rival for the Venezuelan presidency made by Moreno.", "description": "Protesters in Quito throw petrol bombs and ransack public buildings in fuel subsidy demonstrations", "authors": ["Dan Collyns"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9f0c86d5ac333cd0e40beb04b423f15599f011b/0_27_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d1047f82edee1d450d4c1b9ef7d1197f", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
