He suggests that unless viewers recognise \u201cyour language, your life experience, your community in the prevailing culture\u201d then they lose their sense of individual and collective agency, which plays into issues such as Brexit.\n\n\u201cNo one wants to see the UK turn into a cultural Airstrip One, but it\u2019s a clear and present danger. With newspapers struggling and broadcasters outgunned, I fear only effective and salient government media policy stands between Britain and a total loss of cultural sovereignty,\u201d he will tell an audience at the Steve Hewlett memorial lecture in London on Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cThough the digital giants do a great job of providing quality content, it is surely of overwhelming importance that British audiences still get access to great news, drama, comedy, documentary made first and foremost for them and them alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cA society which fails to provide its different communities and groups with the means to listen and come to understand each other\u2019s pasts and presents shouldn\u2019t be surprised if mutual incomprehension and division are the consequence. If you doubt that any of this connects to real-world politics and national well-being, you need to pay more attention.\u201d\n\nThe former BBC boss said that during discussions in 2007 to launch the iPlayer streaming service, he met Netflix\u2019s founder, Reed Hastings, who offered some stark advice: \u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re bothering Mark, you\u2019ll never beat my algorithm. Why not just give us all your content instead?\u201d\n\nThompson also bemoaned the 2009 decision, made on competition grounds, to stop the main British broadcasters joining together to launch an online streaming service codenamed Project Kangaroo, allowing Netflix to sweep in and dominate the British market. He predicts that a forthcoming recession will wipe out swathes of remaining local newspapers across North America and Europe, leaving large towns and cities without any coverage of local politics.\n\nThompson will deliver his speech in the aftermath of this weekend\u2019s Emmy awards, where shows created by Britons such as Fleabag, Chernobyl, and Killing Eve with UK writers, directors and producers won award after award. There is also a national shortage of studio space in the UK, as production companies come to Britain to take advantage of tax breaks and Netflix has said it will spend $500m on UK programmes this year.\n\nHowever, almost all the British Emmy-winning shows were co-productions involving US broadcasters and Thompson said the likes of the BBC and Channel 4 would struggle to arrange similar deals in the future. \u201cFor now it makes sense for the streamers to co-produce and share rights in the country of product. Don\u2019t expect that to last. Soon they\u2019ll want it all.\u201d\n\nAlthough the New York Times has seen a surge in the number of digital subscriptions to 5m, with digital revenue heading towards $800m a year, few industry exper believe this model can be replicated on a mass scale. Thompson also urged media companies to stop blaming Facebook and Google for their woes, saying the internet cannot be uninvented and companies need to work with the reality on the ground.\n\nThompson in his speech will urge increased public funding for some parts of the media, more support for the BBC and government co-ordination on policy: \u201cHere more than anywhere time is running out. So act now.\u201d", "description": "Mark Thompson warns firms such as Netflix will dominate media unless government acts", "authors": ["Jim Waterson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/044930ee5f57be8d58ac48b7f6d0214263ee6377/790_815_4345_2607/master/4345.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b0a1833cdb7366654dca58bdba14e79b", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
