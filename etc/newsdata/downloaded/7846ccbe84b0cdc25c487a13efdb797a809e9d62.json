Multiple times.\n\nREAD MORE Our Climate Change Efforts Are So Piss Poor That We Made The PM Of Tonga Actually Cry\n\nThe Australian PM has had a rough as guts week, attending bushfire sites in Queensland while dodging the huge Gladys Liu scandal wherever possible.\n\nScoMo has been a big fan of Liu since she entered parliament in May, and has defended her amidst the controversy that has surfaced this week. He\u2019s even gone so far as to allude to the idea that her attackers are racist and that this was an insult to the Chinese community as a whole.\n\nBut this didn\u2019t sit well with a 10 News reporter who questioned how the Gladys situation could be racist but the PMs own comments about Sam Dastyari are not.\n\n\u201cPrime Minister why was it racist to question Gladys Liu\u2019s connections to China but it wasn\u2019t racist to call Sam Dastyari \u2018Shanghai Sam\u2019?\u201d\n\nFormer Senator Sam Dastyari resigned in 2017 over his personal ties with Chinese donors and some statements he made about Australia\u2019s involvement in the South China Sea.\n\nLiu is in a similar situation right now after failing to disclose a $40,000 donation, and declaring a separate $25,000 sum three years late.\n\nIn true ScoMo fashion, he weaseled his way out of the situation by denying using the phrase \u201cracist\u201d and \u201cShanghai Sam\u201d when referring to Sam Dastyari.\n\nWell kids, if you\u2019re going to deny saying something racist or stupid, you should probably make sure it\u2019s not in any televised interviews, or on your own Twitter.\n\nAccording to 10 Daily, ScoMo has used the phrase \u201cShanghai Sam\u201d a whopping eight times during his time as federal treasurer in 2016. Yes, eight. He was even cautioned by the Speaker for using it during question time back in 2017.\n\nPM @ScottMorrisonMP denies calling @samdastyari 'Shanghai' Sam. \"I didn't use either of those phrases.\" Except he did. In 2017 on @BenFordham \"'Shanghai' Sam, who I have also christened today as 'Last Chance' Sam, has had his last chance\u2026\" he also repeated it on Sky #auspol \u2014 Jonathan Lea (@JonathanLea10) September 13, 2019\n\nOne of those times was in a tweet that\u2019s still online today.\n\nBut in an interview with equal flog Ben Fordham, Morrison tried to backtrack on his denial and claim he had misunderstood the question. I mean, it was a difficult one. I wouldn\u2019t expect the man running the whole country to be able to comprehend it.\n\n\u201cOf course I remember saying Shanghai Sam,\u201d he told 2GB\u2019s Ben Fordham.\n\nBut Morrison soon tried to clean up the brewing controversy, calling in to 2GB radio to explain the seeming lapse in memory. Speaking to host Ben Fordham \u2014 on the very same show where he had actually said \u2018Shanghai Sam\u2019 at one stage in 2016 \u2014 the PM claimed he had misheard the question\n\n\u201cThis is just another one of the silly little games that comes out of Canberra\u2026\u2026I was referring to the word racist I heard twice in the question,\u201d ScoMo said.\n\nScoMo claims he was referring to the word \u201cracist\u201d, but by my calculations, that is one word/phrase, not two. So, something doesn\u2019t quite add up here.\n\n\u201cI was referring to the word racist that I heard twice in the question and I\u2019ve got to say my focus was on the bushfires,\u201d Mr Morrison said. \u201cWe were standing in the middle of an oval and your hearing doesn\u2019t always pick up the precise wording of all the questions that comes, that\u2019s not uncommon in circumstances like that.\u201d\n\nAhh, the only thing better than a PM who name-calls, is a PM who name calls and denies it.", "description": "Scott Morrison has cleared up his original denial of his \"Shanghai Sam\" name calling, claiming he misheard the question in an interview with Ben Fordham.", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/20190913001419218879-original-1-1024x677.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
