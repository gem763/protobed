EU sources say the outspoken Eurocrat made the remarks at a meeting of his most senior advisers last week.\n\nHowever, they came before the EU widely panned Boris Johnson\u2019s compromise offer, with hopes fading in London of a deal being cut before a possible General Election.\n\nA source close to Guy Verhofstadt, the head of the EU\u2019s Brexit Steering Group, said flatly last night: \u2018Boris Johnson\u2019s proposal does not have a chance. He seems to be gunning for no deal. Nothing is moving at all this weekend\u2019.\n\nMr Juncker's remarks came before the EU widely panned Boris Johnson\u2019s compromise offer\n\nA No10 source added: \u2018Even if Juncker wanted to do a deal, it is slipping out of his control. Appointing Michel Barnier, France\u2019s most unreasonable Frenchman, to lead the negotiations is coming home to roost.\u2019\n\nAnd yesterday, Britain\u2019s former EU Commissioner Lord Hill said that the major roadblock to a deal was Dublin and compromise before the end of the month was a \u2018stretch\u2019. The Brussels expert told the BBC: \u2018I spoke to an EU ambassador who said: \u201cWe don\u2019t understand what the backstop is, we don\u2019t care about the backstop, we would be perfectly happy for the Irish to drop it, but so long as they want it, we\u2019re with the Irish,\u201d and that\u2019s the conundrum.\u2019\n\nOn Friday, No10 enforcer Dominic Cummings warned colleagues that if Europe shows no signs of compromise next week, then \u2018that\u2019s it, we\u2019re off\u2019.", "description": "Mr Juncker is due to step down on  the same day Britain is scheduled to leave the EU.
