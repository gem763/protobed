On Monday, shadow voting minister Cat Smith claimed the announcement was a \u201cblatant attempt by the Tories to rig the result of the next general election\u201d.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Under the scheme, anyone who does not have photographic ID will be able to apply for a free document proving their identity.\n\nBut Darren Hughes, of the Electoral Reform Society (ERS), said \u201cthese plans will leave tens of thousands of legitimate voters voiceless\u201d.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The problem that occurs instead is people turning up wanting to vote but finding their name isn\u2019t on the electoral register.\u201d\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

There\u2019s a very significant risk that this is going to lead to people not being able to vote.\u201d\n\nIn trials of such schemes, people have refused on principle to hand over their driving licence or passport, displaying a \u201cphilosophical resistance\u201d to the idea, Prof James said.\n\nThe director of Age UK, Caroline Abrahams, said Mr Johnson\u2019s move towards voter ID was \u201ccrazy\u201d. In a statement, she told The Independent: \u201cMany older people do not have any photographic ID so we sincerely hope the government is not going to legislate so this becomes a requirement before anyone is allowed to vote.\n\n\u201cIt would risk disenfranchising millions of older people, among others, and so on the face of it seems a crazy idea to propose.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, a University of California study found that strict voter ID laws in the US tended to \u201cskew democracy in favour of whites and those on the political right\u201d.\n\nThe Independent has contacted the Cabinet Office for comment, details on whether the new rules will be introduced through a bill or secondary legislation and about when the government hopes they will be in place.\n\nGovernment briefings to right-wing newspapers over the weekend featured a proposed title for the legislation, the Electoral Integrity Bill, although there was no reference to it being a bill in details of the Queen\u2019s Speech released on Monday.\n\nIn a briefing note circulated in advance of the Queen\u2019s Speech, the government said its move was based on a 2016 review of elections by Eric Pickles.\n\nIn additional plans introduced on Monday, campaigners are to be banned from handling postal votes and a limit imposed on how many postal votes one person can hand in. Postal voters will be required to re-register every three years.\n\nPeople will only be allowed to vote by proxy for two other electors at most, regardless of their relationship, while ministers will also try to make voting easier for people with disabilities.\n\nMeanwhile, an \u201cimprints regime\u201d will be created to police online election material to \u201cmake it clearer to the electorate who has produced and promoted\u201d it \u2013 following widespread controversy over the use of social media for targeted campaigns. In a related move, ministers will consult on measures to protect elections from foreign interference.", "description": "The government has announced plans to prevent people from voting unless they can provide photographic identification, prompting accusations it is\u00a0attempting to \u201crig the next election\u201d.
