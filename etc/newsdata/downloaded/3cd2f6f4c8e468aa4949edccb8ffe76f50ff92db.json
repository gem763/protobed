The SUV segment is much healthier, so why not make one of those? That\u2019s a line of questioning that Dr Stefan Weckbach is more than familiar with.\n\n\u201c[This] is a big investment,\u201d reasons Weckbach, vice-president, Taycan product line. \u201cWe need to have an offer with which we can realise significant volumes \u2013 therefore we decided to go in a segment we haven\u2019t been in before.\n\nThe car offers \"typical Porsche performance\", says Weckbach.\n\n\u201cWe already have two successful SUVs in the market and we didn\u2019t want to substitute ourselves in the SUV segment. In the D sedan segment we have the Panamera.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why the Taycan is aimed at the smaller \u201cC sedan segment\u201d, where Weckbach believes Porsche can gain new customers. Initial signs are very positive. In the past 18 months, more than 25,000 people have paid deposits of \u20ac2500 (about $4079) or equivalent to gain a spot in the queue \u2013 and half those have never owned a Porsche before.\n\nWe concentrated on our own targets for the Taycan to be a true Porsche. \u2014 Stefan Weckbach, VP, Taycan product line\n\nIf these people turn into buyers (strictly speaking, the deposits are refundable), the first year\u2019s planned production is more than accounted for. Fortunately, says Weckbach, there is some flexibility to up the numbers.\n\nThe Taycan will not be the sole electric Porsche for long. A high-riding Cross Turismo sibling will go into production by the end of next year, says Weckbach, and there are \u201cmaybe some additional ideas for future models\u201d based on the Taycan. There will also be a fully electric Macan SUV as soon as next year.\n\nWeckbach is an admirer of Tesla, and will not be drawn into any comparisons. \u201cWe concentrated on our own targets \u2026 for the Taycan to be a true Porsche and as close as possible to our icon, the 911.\u201d\n\nThe Taycan meets all the brand\u2019s standards on performance, charging speed, range, design quality and handling, he says. It offers \u201cthe typical Porsche performance on acceleration, on repeatability of power, constant level of power, on braking power and we are not going to comment on competitors\u2026. we are offering a Porsche with the expectations our customers have.\u201d", "description": "The Taycan is radical in more ways than one \u2013\u00a0join the queue if you\u2019re intrigued.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4036%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_353%2C$y_61/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/2b656da58537a40a003a74a1456ff0d664937012", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
