(Image: Warner Bros.)\n\nReleased in September of 1979, sci-fi romance-slash-crime drama Time After Time has a lot of elements that feel quite dated when you watch it today, including some very primitive special effects. But its chilling underlying message still rings true \u2014 and its cornier parts make it fun to revisit.\n\nIn Victorian London, an eccentric gentleman named H.G. Wells (Malcolm McDowell), still a few years away from becoming the famous author we all know him to be, hosts a dinner to unveil his new invention: a time machine.\n\nMost of the assembled group (dressed in stuffy waistcoats with pocket watches, and given to saying things like \u201cBalderdash!\u201d and calling each other \u201cOld sport!\u201d) don\u2019t know what to make of the device \u2014 but one among the party, Dr. John Leslie Stevenson (a pre-Time Bandits and Tron David Warner), seizes the opportunity to use it as an escape route when Scotland Yard arrives to arrest him for being Jack the Ripper.\n\nThat\u2019s a hell of a build-up, and it doesn\u2019t stop there.\n\nTime After Time leaps into 1979 San Francisco with Wells in pursuit of Stevenson \u2014 someone he once thought was just condescending and really good at chess, but now realises is a sadistic murderer. Even worse, he\u2019s a sadistic murderer who has appropriated Wells\u2019 invention (which Wells originally constructed as a way to visit what he assumed would be a utopian future) to commit more horrific crimes without consequence.\n\nDespite what sounds like a pulse-pounding plot, Time After Time is not what I\u2019d call an action movie. It\u2019s not a time-travel thriller like Timecop, nor is it trying to build a Terminator-style complex mythology. Instead, the stakes feel very contained and personal.\n\nBut while Marty McFly, another unwitting time traveller, could at least recognise the past he visits in Back to the Future, Wells\u2019 Time After Time journey plops him into a 20th-century world where everything is unknown. That includes whatever historical milestones he\u2019s totally skipped over, as well as advancements in technology and the evolution of culture. He also has no way of predicting or preventing whatever awful thing his former friend is going to do next.\n\nThanks to the way the time machine works \u2014 it requires the use of a special key to prevent it from returning to its point of origin, which Jack the Ripper fails to grab before he peaces out of 1890s London \u2014 Wells at least knows where and when to start his search. Why San Francisco? Well, that\u2019s where an H.G. Wells museum exhibit containing the time machine is on display, so that\u2019s where Wells turns up, to the shock of onlookers (including a very young but unmistakable Corey Feldman).\n\nWells sees a TV for the first time. (Image: Warner Bros.)\n\nTruth be told, if Time After Time had just been an entire movie of Wells fumbling around San Francisco, discovering things that both shock (cars, aeroplanes, telephones, the need for a personal ID) and delight (McDonald\u2019s French fries!) him, that would\u2019ve been OK with me. Part of that might be down to the fact that I\u2019ve lived in San Francisco for over half my life, and it\u2019s pretty incredible to see what\u2019s changed and what\u2019s stayed the same since 1979, since much of Time After Time makes use of real locations around the city. It even throws in offhand references to Bullitt and Vertigo, two of San Francisco\u2019s most famous cinematic showcases.\n\nSpeaking of movies set in San Francisco, there\u2019s a very good reason the early part of the movie feels a lot like Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home. Time After Time director Nicholas Meyer, who adapted his script from Karl Alexander\u2019s work-in-progress novel, also co-wrote Leonard Nimoy\u2019s 1986 entry in the big-screen Trek series.\n\nSpecifically, he penned the \u201cmodern day\u201d San Francisco scenes, and while there\u2019s no Time After Time scene to rival Spock nerve-pinching an obnoxious punk kid, we do see Wells trying to sell \u201cantiques\u201d he\u2019s brought through time with him to raise funds for his detective work, much like Kirk does in The Voyage Home.\n\nUltimately, his old-fashioned awkwardness serves him well when it endears him to staunchly modern gal Amy (Mary Steenburgen, whose quirky performance injects an off-kilter energy into the proceedings), the free-spirited bank employee who becomes entangled in his quest. After the two fall in love (fun fact: McDowell and Steenburgen met on the movie and were married for 10 years after), she inevitably catches the Ripper\u2019s eye when Wells and his nemesis cross paths again.\n\nAfter the success of Time After Time, his directorial debut, Meyer went on to direct 1982's Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan and 1991's Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country. But Time After Time came after Meyer scored a scriptwriting Oscar nom for 1976 Sherlock Holmes tale The Seven-Per-Cent Solution, based on his own novel about the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle character\u2019s struggles with cocaine addiction.\n\nHolmes gets a shout-out in Time After Time, a project representing the ultimate combo of Meyer\u2019s twin passions for period intrigue and sci-fi, as seen throughout his career \u2014 just look at his more recent writing credits, which include History Channel miniseries Houdini and the first season of Star Trek: Discovery.\n\nJack and Amy in a tight spot. (Image: Warner Bros.)\n\nWhile certain aspects of Time After Time are fairly ridiculous in 2019 \u2014 the time machine\u2019s trippy journeys look like someone just slapped a prismatic Instagram filter over the film, and the script\u2019s earnest attempts at championing \u201cwomen\u2019s lib\u201d now come off as cringe-worthy \u2014 its critical take on humankind\u2019s lust for violence still hits its mark. Jack the Ripper is delighted to realise he\u2019s not the sickest ticket running around in 1979, not by a long shot. In fact, he blends right in amid all the war, mass murder, civil unrest, serial killers, stores peddling guns, ultraviolent entertainment (when Wells and Amy take in a movie, it\u2019s the fictional Exorcist IV), you name it.\n\nWhen Jack picks up where he left off in Whitechapel and starts slicing up sex workers anew, the jaded San Francisco homicide cops just sigh and mutter, \u201cFirst the Zodiac, now this.\u201d It\u2019s not the utopia Wells was so sure he\u2019d find in the future; it\u2019s a grim reality check about the horrors that people can and will carry out, and it feels just as true today as it did 40 years ago. We suck, for the most part... but at least there are a few kind souls, like Amy for instance, who\u2019re doing their best to keep a certain amount of goodness in circulation.\n\nThe tale of Time After Time enjoyed a brief revival thanks to a 2017 TV adaptation based on Alexander\u2019s novel, but the series, which globbed a more convoluted storyline onto that already bonkers initial premise, failed to catch on like the movie did and was cancelled after just five episodes.\n\nNo matter \u2014 if you want to see Jack the Ripper stalking prey at a disco, or H.G. Wells sampling fast food for the first time, the mostly silly but occasionally sobering Time After Time has long since cemented its weird little corner in history.", "description": "Released in September of 1979, sci-fi romance-slash-crime drama Time After Time has a lot of elements that feel quite dated when you watch it today, including some very primitive special effects.
