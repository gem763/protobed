It said, during the year, myGov maintained 99.94% availability.\n\nIn addition to the delivery of whole-of-government digital platforms such as Digital Identity, Notifications, Tell Us Once, and improvements to myGov, for 2018-19, the DTA set itself three further priorities: The delivery of a digital transformation strategy and roadmap; a program of digital capability improvement, including sourcing reform; and the delivery of investment advice, an assurance policy and framework, and whole-of-government portfolio oversight on IT and digital investments.\n\nThe DTA said that in 2018-19, it provided advice to agencies and government on new IT proposals and increased its direct engagement with agencies to support the delivery of current projects.\n\nIt said it co-designed and brokered assurance activities for projects funded as part of the APS Modernisation Fund.\n\n\"During 2018-19, we adopted a new account management model to increase and streamline engagement with APS agencies, and thereby improve our oversight of digital and ICT investments across government,\" the annual report said.\n\nMust read: Government IT projects failing as DTA's phone calls go unanswered\n\nFor the 2019-20 Budget, the DTA said it also engaged with 18 agencies on new digital and IT-enabled proposals by providing advice to assist agencies to develop these proposals.\n\nAlthough the DTA has stopped publishing a list of the agencies and projects it was watching closely, the annual report said the agency collected performance information quarterly from 27 agencies to understand the status, risks, and trajectory of 85 existing projects. This was supplemented, the DTA said, with face-to-face engagement with the majority of agencies.\n\nFrom February through to June, the DTA said it met with 34 agencies to discuss 53 existing projects and 17 new initiatives.\n\nMeanwhile, under the banner of developing a \"program of digital capability improvement, including sourcing reform\", was the brokering of whole-of-government major sourcing agreements with Microsoft, SAP, and Concur; and the establishment of whole-of-government agreements with IBM and Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nSee also: Australia-wide AWS deal could signal the end for legacy IT procurement\n\nIt also included the establishment of the hardware marketplace panel and an expansion of the software licensing and services panel.\n\nThe digital transformation strategy and roadmap were delivered in November last year and have the goal of not only bringing all services online by 2025, but to have Australia counted as one of the world's top three digital governments.\n\nMORE FROM CANBERRA", "description": "By the end of 2018-19, the Digital Transformation Agency said there had been 11,785 downloads of its myGovID iOS smartphone app.", "authors": ["Asha Barbaschow"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/21/8260eafe-55b4-42a9-8e03-c9aee69ac859/thumbnail/770x578/0c8839f2317c31ac470bff9dec9f3643/mygovid.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
