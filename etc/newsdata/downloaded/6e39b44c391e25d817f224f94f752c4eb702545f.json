Moreover, Leading Indicator of Remodeling Activity (LIRA) developed by Harvard University\u2019s Joint Center for Housing Studies has forecasted a decline in expenditures on renovation and maintenance in 2020. Let\u2019s see whether the U.S. housing market is headed for a slowdown (read: Global Real Estate ETFs Scaling Higher: Here's Why).\n\nRising House Prices\n\nOf late, a surge in home prices has been observed which is wiping out the benefits of low mortgage rates and thus, affecting sales. Continuous supply shortages can be cited as one of the primary reasons for the soaring home prices. In fact, seeing a rise in price for the 91st straight month, the median existing house price rose 5.9% year over year to $272,100 in September.\n\nLow Inventories Build Pressure\n\nBuilders continue to bear the brunt of rising development and construction costs apart from trade woes. They are grappling with regulatory burdens, deficit of lots and lack of skilled labor. These are affecting supply, which in turn, is disturbing the reasonable pricing of homes. In fact, there was a 2.7% year-over-year decline in inventory levels to 1.83 million homes in September. Notably, inventory levels dropped for the fourth straight month.\n\nMortgage Rates\n\nPer the Mortgage Bankers Association, an uptick in the average 30-year fixed-mortgage rates from 3.92% to 4.02% was observed in the week ending Oct 18. The rise in borrowing costs resulted in around a 12% fall in mortgage and a 17% drop in refinance applications.\n\nWeak US Housing Data\n\nThe latest data on U.S. housing starts reflected a decline of 9.4% in September to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.256 million units. The figure lags analysts\u2019 expectations of 1.320 million units, per a Reuters\u2019 poll. The decline was largely due to weak construction in the multi-family housing segment. Moreover, NAR\u2019s data showed a 2.2% drop in existing homes sales to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.38 million units in September. This compares with an upwardly revised 5.50 million units in August. It also disappoints when compared with Reuters economists\u2019 forecast of a 0.7% decline to 5.45 million units. Adding to the gloom, sales of new homes dropped 0.7% in September to an annualized rate of 701,000, per the Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nIs There Any Silver Lining?\n\nThe Fed has cut interest rates for the second time at the FOMC meeting in September. When interest rate drops, mortgage rates decline, making real estate or refinancing mortgages more affordable. This, in turn, leads to higher home sales. Moreover, the market is expecting another Fed rate cut soon, which might provide some strength to the U.S. housing market. In conjunction with attractive mortgage rates, low unemployment levels and rising wages can lead to a favorable environment for the U.S. housing market.\n\nIndustry experts also believe that Harvard\u2019s LIRA index doesn\u2019t continuously adjust itself for changes in sentiment and mortgage rate. Meanwhile, the U.S. homebuilders sentiment data for October has hit the highest level since February 2018. Per the monthly National Association of Home Builders (NAHB)/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI), builder confidence rose to 71 in October compared with 68 in September, 67 in August and 68 a year ago.\n\nHomebuilder ETFs in Focus\n\nAgainst the backdrop, let\u2019s take a look at some homebuilder ETFs.\n\niShares U.S. Home Construction ETF ITB \u2014 up 33.5% year to date\n\nThis fund provides exposure to U.S. companies that manufacture residential homes by tracking the Dow Jones U.S. Select Home Construction Index.
