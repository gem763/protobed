Photo-Illustration: Joe Darrow for New York Magazine\n\nJerry Saltz won his second Ellie Award for New York at the National Magazine Awards in Williamsburg last night. Saltz\u2019s cover story from November 2018, \u201cHow to Be an Artist,\u201d was picked in the Leisure Interests category. Saltz announced last week that he\u2019s turning the piece, which is structured as a set of \u201crules\u201d for how to live life more creatively, into a book. Saltz\u2019s first Ellie for New York came in 2015 for Columns and Commentary. New York\u2019s Olivia Nuzzi was also recognized with an ASME NEXT Award for Journalists Under 30.\n\nThe New Yorker led all winners of the night with four awards, and The New York Times Magazine and Topic picked up two each.\n\nSaltz\u2019s win marked the 41st Ellie overall for New York under departing editor-in-chief Adam Moss, who was honored at the ceremony with the Magazine Editors\u2019 Hall of Fame Award for lifetime achievement. Before he took the stage, a video montage of covers from his 35-year career played for the audience.\n\n\u201cEvery bit of the work you saw on the screen was done by somebody else \u2014 editors, photographers, writers,\u201d Moss said. \u201cAn editor\u2019s job is really to trick other people to do all the work. I am really a grateful and lucky guy.\u201d", "description": "Adam Moss was honored with the Hall of Fame Award at the National Magazine Awards last night in Williamsburg.
