Court records show he was charged this month with escape.\n\nPublic records show Martin has an extensive criminal record, and had been housed at a correctional facility in another county but was brought back to the jail for a court appearance.\n\n\u201cBad men continue to try to fight to free themselves and terrorise our community,\u201d Mr Champlin said.\n\nAuthorities identified the other escapees as Christopher Clemente, Troy McDaniel Jr nd Lawrence Lee.\n\nPrevious charges against them included domestic violence, assault, menacing, drug possession, burglary and unlawful restraint, court records showed.\n\nThe sheriff said the 22-bed jail employs nine full-time corrections officers. It is housed in the basement of the county courthouse in Gallipolis, Ohio, which is about 100 miles southeast of Columbus.\n\nHe said his office has been constrained by the dormitory-type setup of the jail, which is at least 50 years old, as well as difficulty recruiting officers. He said their salaries are $11 (\u00a39) to $15 (\u00a312) an hour.\n\n\u201cWe are very limited on the modifications we can make on our facility to secure these types of inmates,\u201d Mr Champlin said. \u201cI have and I will continue to search for solutions to this problem.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times\n\nRead more\n\nInmates take over high-security prison wing after attacking guards\n\nPrisoners forced to dispose of human waste via cell windows, finds rep\n\nWisconsin prisoner \u2018confesses\u2019 to Making a Murderer killing", "description": "Four prisoners who are considered \u201cextremely dangerous\u201d escaped from a county jail in Ohio early Sunday morning after overpowering two guards, authorities said.The inmates used a homemade weapon known as a shank and stole the keys to a corrections officer\u2019s vehicle, which was used in the first part of", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/rAQFN0XilyfiyKJ965Q_DQ--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/3a9e834f2b1300154d8107a07a9d718c", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
