(AP Photo/Sue Ogrocki)\n\nJalen Hurts was so good against Texas Tech that he got replaced before the fourth quarter even began.\n\nHurts threw for over 400 yards in just shy of three quarters of playing time and continued his amazingly good start to the 2019 season in a 55-16 win by No. 6 Oklahoma over the Red Raiders on Saturday.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nHurts was 17-of-24 passing for 415 yards and threw three touchdowns while rushing for 70 yards on nine carries and also adding a rushing touchdown. Oh, he threw his first interception of the season too. But that\u2019s not that big of a deal when you\u2019re playing as well as Hurts is.\n\nThe four total touchdowns brings Hurts\u2019 total to 17 through four games in 2019. And while Hurts has 17 touchdowns (12 passing, five rushing), he\u2019s thrown just 19 incompletions all year.\n\nYes, really. Hurts is 66-of-85 passing for 1,295 yards and he\u2019s also rushed for 443 yards on 47 carries.\n\nA legit Heisman contender\n\nIt was a little crazy to think that Hurts could be a Heisman candidate after transferring from Alabama after the 2018 season. After all, no team has ever had three different players win Heisman Trophies in consecutive seasons.\n\nIt\u2019s not crazy in the slightest to believe Hurts can follow Baker Mayfield and Kyler Murray now. Here are how Mayfield and Murray fared through the first four games of their Heisman-winning seasons\n\nMayfield (2017): 76-of-101 passing, 1,329 yards, 13 TDs, 0 Ints, 17 rushing yards\n\nMurray (2018): 60-of-88 passing, 1,028 yards, 11 TDs, 2 Ints, 240 rushing yards\n\nAs you can see, Hurts has nearly the same amount of passing yards Mayfield did with a better completion percentage. And he\u2019s outrushed Murray through four games by over 200 yards.\n\nStory continues\n\nSimply put, Hurts has been the most dangerous quarterback in college football so far. If you\u2019re making an early-season Heisman list he\u2019s at the top with Wisconsin running back Jonathan Taylor and, maybe, his former Alabama teammate Tua Tagovailoa.\n\nWill Hurts keep it up? There\u2019s no reason to think he won\u2019t in Oklahoma coach Lincoln Riley\u2019s offense. He\u2019s shown ability as a passer that wasn\u2019t seen much in his time at Alabama and wide receivers CeeDee Lamb and Charleston Rambo proved again on Saturday that they\u2019re legitimate deep threats whenever Riley wants to go long.\n\nMaybe Riley really wasn\u2019t lying when he said before the season that he didn\u2019t think a historic 2018 Oklahoma offense wasn\u2019t going to take a step back in 2019. Because it certainly looks just as dangerous through the first third of the season.\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nNick Bromberg is a writer for Yahoo Sports\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Hurts has thrown for 1,295 yards and rushed for 443 yards through Oklahoma's first four games.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/pOWIbZfCa1l5VNDIMID9sw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/HWisNDO8IKyta50IvB2TXg--~B/aD0yNDkxO3c9MzczNztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/69eb33c0-e225-11e9-bd3d-48da0f9b603e", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
