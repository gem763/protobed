This marked the largest single-day increase for crude prices since December 2008.\n\nAnd while a destabilization in the energy market changes the global economic outlook, it will not lead to the Federal Reserve materially changing its policy outlook.\n\nPartly because any inflation spike due to gas prices is removed from the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation measure, and partly because changes in the price of gas simply matter less to consumers than they used to.\n\nA whole lot less.\n\nGasoline spending as a share of total personal consumption has been sliding for decades, dampening the negative impact to consumers from spikes in the price of oil. (Source: BAML) More\n\n\u201cConsumption of gasoline, fuel oil and other energy goods as a share of total consumption has fallen from around 8% before the 1970s to around 2.3% today,\u201d economists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch wrote in a note published this week.\n\nAnd with personal consumption accounting for about 70% of GDP, a 75% reduction in the relative importance of gasoline prices to this measure means that sticker shock at the pump just isn\u2019t a major risk to the U.S. economy. Even if it does lead to a slight downtick in overall consumption.\n\nMy colleague Ethan Wolff-Mann noted Tuesday that all economists have two hands \u2014 higher oil prices can be both good and bad for the economy. Because even if a negative shock from high oil prices hits consumption, higher prices should lead to increased investment from energy companies to pump more oil.\n\nGoldman Sachs economists said this week the drag on growth from any consumer pullback should \u201cslightly exceed\u201d the boost to business investment from higher oil prices. And by \u201cslightly exceed\u201d Goldman means a $10/barrel increase in oil prices would likely result in a 0.15% reduction in GDP due to lower consumption and a resulting 0.12% increase in GDP due to higher investment.\n\nThe resulting 0.03% hit to overall GDP is also known as a rounding error.\n\nSo, while Deutsche Bank economists led by Matthew Luzzetti wrote this week that the latest events in the oil market \u201cshould reinforce the Fed\u2019s already dovish bias,\u201d strong retail sales data from August and a decent August jobs report should do the same.\n\nAfter all, Fed Chair Jay Powell began telegraphing this easing cycle back in January by saying the central bank would use its tools to \u201ckeep the expansion on track.\u201d\n\nAnd working to keep this expansion on track means acting to bolster a solid labor market and confident consumers amid a muddied global economic picture, with or without oil price shocks. Shocks that likely won\u2019t matter much anyway.\n\nBy Myles Udland, reporter and co-anchor of The Final Round.
