The idea is that you can still achieve your dreams if you are disabled, even if it takes a variation.\u2019\n\nIan was born with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC), a condition that means his joints do not move and he cannot use his limbs.\n\nThe cover of Danny\u2019s Dream (Picture: Ian Parker/Mouth and Foot Painting Artists)\n\nHe says when he was a child he always wanted to draw things and throughout school, he worked to study art, learning to control the paint and improve his skills.\n\nAfter GCSE and A-Level art, he went to university to study Fine Art, completing the course in 1993.\n\nSince then, he has worked for Mouth and Foot Painting Artists \u2013 a group which employs 33 artists in the UK.\n\nIan explains: \u2018MFPA is a cooperative so we work on images throughout the year and they are sold through them.\n\n\u2018Most of what I do is for Christmas cards so even if it\u2019s blazing hot outside, I\u2019m thinking about snow and robins.\u2019\n\nBut in 2016, Ian was asked if he wanted to illustrate the book, being sold through MFPA.\n\nDanny at school before his accident (Picture: Ian Parker/Mouth and Foot Painting Artists)\n\nIan adds: \u2018I\u2019d never done anything of that magnitude before but I really didn\u2019t have to think twice. It was a challenge but it was something completely new.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s always good to try to do something different.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe words were written by Victor and it was up to Ian to draw what was happening in the story. He admits that it led to some challenges he wasn\u2019t used to with the rest of his work.\n\n\u2018The thing with a book,\u2019 he says, \u2018is that the whole thing needs to not just have a theme, but also remain consistent in look throughout.\n\n\u2018You need character development and to just make sure that the character on one page looks the same on the next.\n\n\u2018It took two years to nail down things like the wheelchair. The whole thing took a lot of back and forth with the writer to get to a point where we were happy but it was worth it.\u2019\n\nDanny in his magic chair (Picture: Ian Parker/Mouth and Foot Painting Artists)\n\nInitially, Ian and Victor were hoping to complete the project within a year but it ended up taking two and a half years as they wanted to ensure everything was right.\n\nThe book launched last week and is being sold on the Mouth and Foot Painting website for \u00a310.\n\nIan adds: \u2018So far, the feedback we have had from children has been really good, which is obviously what we wanted.\n\n\u2018The idea of the book is you can have a gift but you still need to work at it and I see that in this book.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s been a real team effort \u2013 there\u2019s my drawings but the words are by Victor and behind me I\u2019ve had my wife and two daughters and the Mouth and Foot Painting Artists.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIan is now back to completing Christmas card and calendar designs but says that he would like to do another book in the future.\n\n\u2018I think if you had asked me at the end of the book, I would have said no because I was absolutely exhausted, physically and emotionally,\u2019 he says.\n\n\u2018We completed most of the work in March and it\u2019s only just coming out so looking back now, I think I would do it again in the right circumstances. Now that I have the experience, I would know how to approach it.\u2019\n\nMORE: You Don\u2019t Look Sick: \u2018You might think I look better but I still feel horrible every day\u2019\n\nMORE: Woman who thought chronic illness had ruined her dreams of doing ballet now teaches dance from her wheelchair\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Ian Parker completed Danny's Dream through his work with the Mouth and Foot Painting Artists group.", "authors": ["Laura Abernethy"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Ian-Parker-Working-17.2.19-c467_1572277385.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
