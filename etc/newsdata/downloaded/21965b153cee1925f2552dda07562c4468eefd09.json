He added that Nissan still believes Sunderland -- which directly employs 6,500 people -- has strong assets.\n\nCarmakers have been increasingly vocal in opposing a British split from the European Union without a deal, warning of a devastating impact on the industry. Nissan has scrapped plans to build its X-Trail sport utility vehicle in Sunderland and ended production of the luxury Infiniti brand there.\n\nQashqai Question\n\nProduction of the larger Qashqai SUV could be moved to Spain, though De Ficchy said the company is currently assuming a next-generation version will remain in the U.K.\n\nThe executive was speaking after unveiling a revamped assembly line for the updated Juke crossover auto, which will be built in Sunderland from Monday. The introduction of the model will mean the loss of one of five daily work shifts as staff transfer between the site\u2019s two assembly lines, though employment levels won\u2019t be affected.\n\nDe Ficchy said output at the plant will fall 20% to 360,000 autos in the year through March as a result of already announced production changes prompted by slowing diesel demand and sluggish sales in Turkey.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Siddharth Philip in Sunderland, England at sphilip3@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Anthony Palazzo at apalazzo@bloomberg.net, Christopher Jasper, John Bowker\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Follow @Brexit\u00a0on Twitter,\u00a0sign up to our Brexit Bulletin and subscribe to our podcast.\u00a0Nissan Motor Co. issued its starkest warning yet against a no-deal Brexit, saying any tariffs on auto exports to the European Union are likely to render its U.K. operations unviable.The imposition of", "authors": ["Siddharth Philip"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/12hQ47aH6fNZszkEHCTezQ--~B/aD04OTg7dz0xMjk2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/46b172c470e5036098880b6b20f4df74", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
