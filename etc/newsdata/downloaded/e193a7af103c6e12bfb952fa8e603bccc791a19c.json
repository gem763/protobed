He issued four walks, joining Art Reinhart of the St. Louis Cardinals as the only pitchers to walk that many in the first inning they ever pitched in the post-season.\n\nReinhart walked four \u2014 including Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig \u2014 in the fifth inning of Game 4 of the 1926 World Series against the Yankees.\n\n'We didn't play very well today'\n\nCorbin walked three in a row with two outs in the 31-pitch inning. Yan Gomes was charged with a passed ball, too, and Muncy drew a free pass with the bases loaded to put the Dodgers in front.\n\n\"We didn't play very well today,\" Nationals manager Dave Martinez said.\n\nCorbin gave up two runs \u2014 one earned \u2014 and three hits in six innings. The left-hander struck out nine and finished with five walks.\n\nCody Bellinger walked with two outs and scored on an error by Kendrick in the fifth that made it 2-0. Third baseman Anthony Rendon made a diving stop on Chris Taylor's single down the line, but his throw to first wasn't in time and Bellinger went to third.\n\nMuncy's grounder rolled through Kendrick's legs for an error, scoring Bellinger, and Taylor got thrown out at the plate to end the inning.\n\nDodgers winning streak continues\n\nIn the fourth, Muncy singled leading off. Corey Seager followed with a hit that got past a diving Kendrick at first and rolled into right, sending Muncy to third. But then Corbin settled down and retired the next three batters to end the inning.\n\nThe Nationals loaded the bases in the fourth on three walks by Buehler. He escaped when Asdrubal Cabrera tapped the ball back to the mound and Buehler flipped to first to end the inning.\n\nJuan Soto, who had the key hit in the wild-card win over Milwaukee, singled in the second and Trea Turner singled in the ninth off Joe Kelly for the Nationals' only hits.\n\nIt was a quiet offensive night for each team's MVP contender. Rendon, who hit .319 in the regular season, went 0 for 2 with two strikeouts and a walk. Bellinger, a .305 hitter, struck out twice and walked twice.\n\nIt was the fourth shutout in games between the teams this season, and third by the Dodgers.\n\nLos Angeles won its eighth in a row dating to the regular season. Washington's nine-game winning streak, including the wild-card victory, ended.", "description": "Walker Buehler allowed one hit over six scoreless innings, Max Muncy drove in three runs and the Los Angeles Dodgers capitalized on mistakes to beat the Washington Nationals 6-0 in Game 1 of their NL Division Series on Thursday night.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5308546.1570158107!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/walker-buehler.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
