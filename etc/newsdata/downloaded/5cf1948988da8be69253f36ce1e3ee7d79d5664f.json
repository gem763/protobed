Walmart made a similar decision in late September.\n\nAlibaba said it already had a long-standing policy in place to not sell complete e-cigarette products in the US.\n\nVaping products have been linked to a mysterious lung illness that is reported to have led to 18 deaths as of last week, with the number of confirmed and probable cases of the condition exceeding 1,000, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Ltd said that listings for a range of products would not be displayed for users located in the US. These include box mods, which are e-cigarettes with replaceable batteries, atomisers and storage tanks. Smaller vape pens, herbal vapours, heat-not-burn devices, and empty pod cartridges would also be pulled from the market, it said.\n\nWhile Juul Labs Inc dominates the North American market for pod-based e-cigarettes, many reports of death and injury in the US have been tied to makeshift brands with no identifiable owner.\n\nThe most prominent, Dank Vapes, was linked to 24 patients with lung illness, according to a study by the New England Journal of Medicine. The products contained THC, the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis.\n\nPrior to the suspension, buyers could easily build their own counterfeit vaping devices with component parts and packaging from sites such as Alibaba or Amazon.\n\nAmazon.com Inc took down vape paraphernalia in September, although it did not specify the exact products it removed.", "description": "The Chinese e-commerce giant's move follows decisions by US firms to pull e-cigarettes from shelves as illnesses rise.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/9/24/bd49d7908c7f42d993e9debf4a1e42d9_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
