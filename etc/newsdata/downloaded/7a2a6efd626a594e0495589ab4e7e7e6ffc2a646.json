The media spin, how I apparently upset everybody, it was all nonsense,\u201d Keane told Off The Ball this week. \u201cI think when he apologises I will probably say hello to him, yeah.

I was at the club when Bryan Robson left, when Steve Bruce left, two brilliant servants for Manchester United, and I didn\u2019t like the way they were treated.\u201d\n\nKeane\u2019s exit from Manchester United came by mutual consent after an extended spell on the sidelines due to injury.

Darren Ferguson [his son] won a medal. He was very lucky. [Alex Ferguson\u2019s] brother was the chief scout for Manchester United for a long time. I\u2019m surprised his wife wasn\u2019t involved in the staff somewhere.\n\n\u201cDarren was [the manager] at Preston North End and lost his job. He had a couple of young players on loan from Manchester United, [but] guess what happens the next day? They\u2019re pulled out of Preston. Is that doing the best for Manchester United? Do me a favour.\u201d", "description": "Roy Keane has reignited his long-running feud with\u00a0Sir Alex Ferguson and said he \u201cwouldn\u2019t forgive\u201d his former manager.
