He\u2019d been living with his wife and two kids in the Brittany Heights subdivision in Chandler, Arizona, for two years by then, in a taupe two-story house that Thallikar had fallen in love with on his first visit. The double-height ceilings made it seem airy and expansive; there was a playground around the corner; and the neighbors were friendly, educated people who worked in auto finance or at Intel or at the local high school. Thallikar loved that he could stand in the driveway, look out past a hayfield and the desert scrub of Gila River Indian land, and see the jagged pink outlines of the Estrella Mountains. Until recently, the area around Brittany Heights had been mostly farmland, and there remained a patchwork of alfalfa fields alongside open ranges scruffy with mesquite and coyotes. To hear more feature stories, see our full list or get the Audm iPhone app.\n\nIn the evenings, after work, Thallikar liked to decompress by taking long walks around Brittany Heights, following Musket Way to Carriage Lane to Marlin Drive almost as far as the San Palacio and Clemente Ranch housing developments. It was during one of these strolls that Thallikar first became aware of a low, monotone hum, like a blender whirring somewhere in the distance. It was irritating, but he wrote it off. Someone\u2019s pool pump, probably. On another walk a few days later, he heard it again. A carpet-cleaning machine? he wondered. A few nights later, there it was again. It sounded a bit like warped music from some far-off party, but there was no thump or rhythm to the sound. Just one single, persistent note: EHHNNNNNNNN. Evening after evening, he realized, the sound was there\u2014every night, on every street. The whine became a constant, annoying soundtrack to his walks. And then it spread. In early 2015, Thallikar discovered that the hum had followed him home. This being Arizona, Thallikar and his neighbors rewarded themselves for surviving the punishing summers by spending mild winter evenings outside: grilling, reading, napping around plunge pools, dining under the twinkle of string lights. Thallikar had installed a firepit and Adirondack chairs in his backyard. But whenever he went out to cook or read, there was that damn whine\u2014on the weekends, in the afternoon, late into the night. It was aggravating, and he felt mounting anxiety every day it continued. Where was it coming from? Would it stop? Would it get worse? He started spending more time inside.\n\nThen it was in his bedroom. He had just closed his eyes to go to sleep one night when he heard it: EHHNNNNNNNN. He got up to shut the window, but that made no difference at all. \u201cThat was when I started getting concerned,\u201d he observed later. He tried sleeping with earplugs. When that didn\u2019t help, he also tied a towel around his head. When that still wasn\u2019t enough, he moved into the guest room, where the hum seemed slightly fainter. Each night, he\u2019d will himself to sleep, ears plugged and head bandaged, but he could feel the whine in his bones, feel himself getting panicky as it droned on and on and on and on and on. The noise hummed 24 hours a day, seven days a week, like a mosquito buzzing in his ear, only louder and more persistent. He sensed it coming from everywhere at once. Thallikar began to dread going home. As the months passed, he felt like he was in a war zone. He wrote in a text message that he felt as though someone was launching \u201can acoustic attack\u201d on his home.\n\nFrom April 2019: James Fallows on leaf blowers and activism The earliest noise complaint in history also concerns a bad night\u2019s sleep. The 4,000-year-old Epic of Gilgamesh recounts how one of the gods, unable to sleep through humanity\u2019s racket and presumably a little cranky, opts \u201cto exterminate mankind.\u201d Noise\u2014or what the professionals call a \u201cvery dynamic acoustic environment\u201d\u2014can still provoke people to murderous extremes, especially when the emitter disturbs the receiver at home. After repeated attempts to quiet his raucous neighbor, a Fort Worth, Texas, father of two, perturbed by loud music at 2 a.m., called the police, who came, left, and returned less than an hour later, after the man had allegedly shot his neighbor three times\u2014an incident not to be confused with the time a Houston man interrupted his neighbor\u2019s late-night party and, after a showdown over noise, shot and killed the host. In New York City, a former tour-bus driver fed up with noisy parties across the hall allegedly sought help from a hit man. A man in Pennsylvania, said to have had no more trouble with the law than a traffic ticket, ambushed an upstairs couple with whom he\u2019d had noise disputes, shooting them and then himself, and leaving behind a sticky note that read, \u201cCan only be provoked so long before exploding.\u201d There\u2019s the man accused of threatening his noisy neighbors with a gun, the man who shot a middle-school coach after they quarreled over noise, the man who fired on a mother and daughter after griping about sounds from their apartment, the man who killed his roommate after a futile request that he \u201cquiet down,\u201d and the woman who shot at a neighbor after being asked to turn down her music\u2014all since the beginning of this year.\n\nNoise is never just about sound; it is inseparable from issues of power and powerlessness. It is a violation we can\u2019t control and to which, because of our anatomy, we cannot close ourselves off. \u201cWe have all thought of killing our neighbors at some point,\u201d a soft-spoken scientist researching noise abatement told me. As environmental hazards go, noise gets low billing. There is no Michael Pollan of sound; limiting your noise intake has none of the cachet of going paleo or doing a cleanse. When The New Yorker recently proposed noise pollution as the next public-health crisis, the internet scoffed. \u201cPollution pollution is the next big (and current) public health crisis,\u201d chided one commenter. Noise is treated less as a health risk than an aesthetic nuisance\u2014a cause for people who, in between rounds of golf and art openings, fuss over the leaf blowers outside their vacation homes. Complaining about noise elicits eye rolls. Nothing will get you labeled a crank faster. Scientists have known for decades that noise\u2014even at the seemingly innocuous volume of car traffic\u2014is bad for us. \u201cCalling noise a nuisance is like calling smog an inconvenience,\u201d former U.S. Surgeon General William Stewart said in 1978. In the years since, numerous studies have only underscored his assertion that noise \u201cmust be considered a hazard to the health of people everywhere.\u201d Say you\u2019re trying to fall asleep. You may think you\u2019ve tuned out the grumble of trucks downshifting outside, but your body has not: Your adrenal glands are pumping stress hormones, your blood pressure and heart rate are rising, your digestion is slowing down. Your brain continues to process sounds while you snooze, and your blood pressure spikes in response to clatter as low as 33 decibels\u2014slightly louder than a purring cat. \u201cQuiet places have been on the road to extinction at a rate that far exceeds the extinction of species.\u201d Experts say your body does not adapt to noise. Large-scale studies show that if the din keeps up\u2014over days, months, years\u2014noise exposure increases your risk of high blood pressure, coronary heart disease, and heart attacks, as well as strokes, diabetes, dementia, and depression. Children suffer not only physically\u201418 months after a new airport opened in Munich, the blood pressure and stress-hormone levels of neighboring children soared\u2014but also behaviorally and cognitively. A landmark study published in 1975 found that the reading scores of sixth graders whose classroom faced a clattering subway track lagged nearly a year behind those of students in quieter classrooms\u2014a difference that disappeared once soundproofing materials were installed. Noise might also make us mean: A 1969 study suggested that test subjects exposed to noise, even the gentle fuzz of white noise, become more aggressive and more eager to zap fellow subjects with electric shocks.\n\nIn the extreme, sound becomes a weapon. Since at least the 1960s, scientists have investigated sound\u2019s potential to subdue hostage-takers, protesters, and enemy troops, against whom one expert proposed using low-frequency sound, because it apparently induces \u201cdisorientation, vomiting fits, bowel spasms, uncontrollable defecation.\u201d The U.S. military, keenly aware of noise\u2019s power to confuse and annoy, has wielded soundtracks as punishment: It tried to hurry along the Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega\u2019s surrender by blasting his hideout with rock music (Kiss and Rick Astley made the playlist); attacked Fallujah, Iraq, while pounding heavy metal on the battlefield (Guns N\u2019 Roses, AC/DC); tortured Guant\u00e1namo detainees with a nonstop barrage of rap and theme songs (Eminem, the Meow Mix jingle); and, under the supervision of the FBI, attempted to aggravate the Branch Davidian cult of Waco, Texas, into surrender with a constant loop of Christmas carols, Nancy Sinatra, Tibetan chants, and dying rabbits. (\u201cIf they go Barry Manilow,\u201d said a hostage negotiator at the time, \u201cit\u2019s excessive force.\u201d) Even when not intentionally deployed for harm, the sound of drilling, barking, building, crying, singing, clomping, dancing, piano practicing, lawn mowing, and generator running becomes, to those exposed, a source of severe anguish that is entirely at odds with our cavalier attitude toward noise. \u201cIt feels like it\u2019s eating at your body,\u201d a man plagued by a rattling boiler told a reporter. A woman who was being accosted on all sides by incessant honking told me, \u201cThe noise had literally pushed me to a level of feeling suicidal.\u201d For those grappling with it, noise is \u201cchaos,\u201d \u201ctorture,\u201d \u201cunbearable,\u201d \u201cnauseating,\u201d \u201cdepressing and nerve-racking,\u201d \u201cabsolute hell,\u201d and \u201can ice pick to the brain.\u201d \u201cIf you didn\u2019t know they were talking about noise, you might think they were describing some sort of assault,\u201d Erica Walker, an environmental-health researcher at Boston University, has said. This has spurred scientists, physicians, activists, public officials, and, albeit less in the United States, lawmakers to join in the quest for quiet, which is far more elusive than it may seem. \u201cQuiet places,\u201d says the acoustic ecologist Gordon Hempton, \u201chave been on the road to extinction at a rate that far exceeds the extinction of species.\u201d\n\nFrom April 2016: The future will be quiet Thallikar went hunting for the source of the sound. At first he canvassed the neighborhood by foot, setting out around 10 or 11 o\u2019clock at night, once the thrum of traffic had quieted down. When these \u201cnoise patrols,\u201d as he called them, yielded no answers, he expanded his perimeter\u2014by bike, then by car. He\u2019d pull over every few blocks to listen for the whine. The hum was everywhere: outside Building E of the Tri-City Baptist Church and the apartments in San Palacio; near the Extra Space Storage and the no perfect people allowed sign at Hope Covenant Church; ricocheting around the homes in Canopy Lane, Clemente Ranch, Stonefield, the Reserve at Stonefield. He\u2019d go out multiple nights a week, for 10 minutes to an hour, taking notes on where the noise was loudest. The patrols dragged on\u2014one week, two weeks, eight weeks\u2014which led to spats with his wife, who wanted to know why he kept leaving the house so late at night. Finally, as winter warmed into spring, Thallikar thought he\u2019d identified the source of the whine: a gray, nearly windowless building about half a mile from his house. The two-story structure, which had the charm of a prison and the architectural panache of a shoebox, was clad in concrete and surrounded by chain-link and black-metal fences, plus a cinder-block wall. It belonged to a company called CyrusOne.\n\nThere was no thrill in this discovery, just simmering fear that the noise might get worse. Thallikar visited the city-planning clerk, multiple times. She said she couldn\u2019t help and referred him to CyrusOne\u2019s construction manager. Kept awake by the noise at 11 o\u2019clock one Saturday night, Thallikar phoned the man, who protested that he was trying to sleep. \u201cI\u2019m trying to sleep too, dude!\u201d Thallikar told him. When they spoke again the next day, the call ended abruptly, and without resolution.\n\nAccording to CyrusOne\u2019s website, the company\u2019s Chandler campus offers Fortune 500 companies robust infrastructure for mission-critical applications. In other words, it\u2019s a data center\u2014a columbarium for thousands of servers that store data for access and processing from virtually anywhere in the world. When you check your bank balance or research a used car or book a hotel room, chances are decent that the information comes to you via one of the more than 40 CyrusOne data centers spread around the globe. CyrusOne houses servers belonging to nearly 1,000 companies, including Microsoft, Country Financial, Brink\u2019s, Carfax, and nearly half of the Fortune 20. Thallikar, wanting to confront the noise personally, made a surprise visit to CyrusOne. He found workers putting up a new building, but learned that the whine was unrelated to construction. It came from the chillers, a bulky assemblage of steel boxes and tubes permanently affixed to the sides of the two existing buildings. Servers, like humans, are happiest at temperatures between 60 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit, and the chillers were crucial in keeping the heat-generating machines comfortably cool as they worked. In the fall of 2014, around the time Thallikar started noticing the whine, CyrusOne had had room for 16 chillers. Now it was getting ready to add eight more. During a follow-up visit, Thallikar, who grew up in Bangalore and moved to Arizona in 1990 to study industrial engineering at Arizona State University, said he was informed by a worker at the site that immigrants like him should feel lucky to live in the U.S., noise be damned.\n\nCyrusOne arrived in Chandler shortly before Thallikar did and broke ground two months after he closed on his home. For CyrusOne, Chandler was a \u201cdream come true,\u201d Kevin Timmons, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, told me. The city essentially offered CyrusOne carte blanche to develop an area three times the size of Ellis Island into one of the nation\u2019s largest data-storage complexes: 2 million square feet protected by biometric locks, steel-lined walls, bullet-resistant glass, and dual-action interlocking dry-pipe sprinkler systems. CyrusOne even has two of its own substations humming with enough energy (112 megawatts) to light up every home in Salt Lake City\u2014or, more relevant to the matter at hand, to power several dozen 400- and 500-ton chillers. CyrusOne\u2019s Chandler facility was not only the company\u2019s most ambitious, but the biggest to realize its strategy of wooing clients through ultrafast, just-in-time construction. CyrusOne could now boast of being able to complete a building in 107 days\u2014faster than customers could have their servers ready. \u201cIt literally put us on the map,\u201d Timmons said. Arizona attracts data centers the way Florida attracts plastic surgeons. The state has low humidity; proximity to California\u2014where many users and customers are based\u2014but without its earthquakes or energy prices; and, thanks to lobbying efforts by CyrusOne, generous tax incentives for companies that drop their servers there. Walk 10 minutes due north from CyrusOne\u2019s Chandler complex, and you\u2019ll reach two other data centers, with a third just down the road. Drive 15 minutes from there, and you\u2019ll come across three more. Continue farther east past Wild West Paintball, and you\u2019ll hit an Apple data center, which will soon be joined by a Google facility, plus another data center from CyrusOne. Forty-five minutes west of Thallikar\u2019s home, Compass Datacenters is building on more than 225 acres of land, a plot three times the size of CyrusOne\u2019s in Chandler.\n\nBy the summer of 2015, Thallikar had thrown himself into an aggressive campaign to quiet the hum. He went up and down the city\u2019s chain of command, pleading for help. He emailed Chandler\u2019s economic-development innovation manager, its economic-development specialist, and its economic-development director, who replied that Thallikar was the only resident to complain, but dutifully went out, twice, to listen for the high-pitched whine. He didn\u2019t hear it. \u201cI do not think I am imagining things here and wasting people\u2019s time,\u201d Thallikar wrote back, adding that he\u2019d taken his family on his patrol, \u201cand they too could hear the noise.\u201d For two years, Thallikar complained to anyone who would listen and even to those who would not. Meanwhile, CyrusOne kept building. Thallikar emailed a news anchor, an executive producer, an editor, and several reporters at the local 12 News TV station, offering to help them \u201cin experiencing the problem so they can relate to it.\u201d He emailed the mayor and all five members of the Chandler city council. Multiple times. Then daily. \u201cThe noise gets louder in the night and enters our homes. And the streets are filled with it,\u201d Thallikar wrote in one email. In another: \u201cJust what will it take for one of you to respond to my emails.\u201d He presented his case at a city-council meeting, requesting that a task force be formed to research and stop the whine. He acknowledged that he\u2019d been told the sound seemed suspiciously similar to the buzz of traffic on the 202 freeway nearby.\n\nThallikar took his campaign to his homeowners\u2019 association and to his neighbors. The response was tepid, though he did persuade one person to email the city. Thallikar reached out, again, to CyrusOne, and to the Chandler Police Department. Commander Gregg Jacquin promised to investigate, but suggested that Thallikar might have more success if he cooled it with all the emails to city officials, which were creeping into the high double digits. Thallikar started keeping a log of how the noise changed, hour to hour and day to day. It was getting louder, he was sure. In the fall of 2015, Jacquin emailed Thallikar to say that he\u2019d gone in search of the noise, but hadn\u2019t heard it. \u201cI am not making this up\u2014even though I do not have the measurement numbers,\u201d Thallikar wrote back. \u201cThe noise heard over the weekend starting on Saturday starting around 10 pm through Sunday was very very bad. I got a nervous headache, and had to take medications.\u201d He never heard back from Jacquin. Before long, Thallikar began to contemplate selling his home. Noise is a clever enemy. It leaves no trace and vanishes when chased. It\u2019s hard to measure or describe. It is also relative. \u201cSound is when you mow your lawn, noise is when your neighbor mows their lawn, and music is when your neighbor mows your lawn,\u201d says Arjun Shankar, an acoustic consultant. Noise is also fiendishly difficult to legislate, though for nearly as long as humans have lived together, we have seen fit to try. The ancient Greeks of Sybaris are credited with introducing the first noise ordinance, in the eighth century b.c., banishing roosters as well as blacksmiths, carpenters, and other \u201cnoisy arts\u201d from the city limits. In the United States, the appetite for noise control reached its apex in 1972, when President Richard Nixon enacted the country\u2019s first federal statute specifically targeting noise pollution, which empowered the Environmental Protection Agency to quiet the country. Nine years later, the Reagan administration withdrew funding for the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Office of Noise Abatement and Control, foisting responsibility back onto state and local governments. Since then, little has changed. \u201cUnfortunately,\u201d says New York City\u2019s longtime noise czar, Arline Bronzaft, \u201cthe federal government is essentially out of the noise business.\u201d\n\nIn the ensuing decades, the war on noise has shifted to the margins\u2014a loose flock of mom-and-pop organizers whose agitations have all the glitz and edge of a church bake sale. The mood on pro-quiet listservs skews defeatist, the general tone more support group than picket line. (The landing page for the Right to Quiet Society politely instructs newcomers, \u201cIf you did not like what you saw here, without telling us, you might consider leaving quietly.\u201d) Anti-noise crusaders band together in ragtag crews united by geography or irritant. Depending on whether your trigger point concerns planes, trains, blowers, Jet Skis, dirt bikes, concerts, boom cars, cars, motorcycles, or Muzak, you might join ROAR (Residents Opposed to Airport Racket), HORN (Halt Outrageous Railroad Noise), BLAST (Ban Leaf Blowers and Save Our Town), CALM (Clean Alternative Landscaping Methods), HEAVEN (Healthier Environment Through Abatement of Vehicle Emission and Noise), CRASH (County Residents Against Speedway Havoc), Pipedown (\u201cthe campaign for freedom from piped music\u201d), or roughly 150 other organizations with varying levels of activity. In the United States, one of the few emitter-agnostic groups with a national scope is Noise Free America, which has 51 local chapters, noise counselors on call, and, for four out of the past six years, a tradition of going to Washington, D.C., to petition lawmakers\u2014the pinnacle of which was once getting to meet then\u2013Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi\u2019s deputy chief of staff.\n\nOn a recent Sunday morning, I joined Noise Free America\u2019s founder and director, Ted Rueter, for what he billed as a \u201cnoise tour\u201d of Brooklyn\u2014a pilgrimage to some of the borough\u2019s most sonorously grating street corners. Rueter, a 62-year-old political-science professor, met me at a Starbucks on Flatbush Avenue wearing khaki shorts, a pink polo shirt, and Bose noise-canceling headphones. He was joined by three New Yorkers concerned with the din of their neighborhoods: Manohar Kanuri, a former stock analyst who lives above the incessant beeping of construction and delivery trucks in Manhattan\u2019s Battery Park City; Ashley, a 40-something who\u2019s moved three times in an effort to escape thunderous parties; and Vivianne, a woman who lives with the constant staccato of honking livery cabs, dollar vans, and impatient drivers. (Ashley and Vivianne asked not to be identified by their real names.) For Rueter, who was in town from Durham, North Carolina, a tour of New York\u2019s cacophony seemed to have the exotic thrill of going on safari. Kanuri, Ashley, and Vivianne had corresponded extensively online, but this was their first time meeting in person, and they appeared delighted at getting to bond with sympathetic ears. \u201cWe build coalition this way,\u201d Kanuri said. All three New Yorkers had tried tackling their noise issues through traditional avenues\u2014the 311 nonemergency line (which receives more reports about noise than about any other issue), the local police, their city-council members, the public advocate, the mayor\u2014but found the city unsympathetic, unresponsive, or ineffective. Before heading out on the noise tour, they sat in the Starbucks venting about the difficulties of catching emitters in the act and encouraging police to take action. Ashley had placed so many 311 calls that she worried about getting arrested, like a Bronx woman who was thrown in a holding cell on charges of entering false information in the public record after calling 44 times in 15 months\u2014often to report her neighbors\u2019 racket. Vivianne warned Ashley that the police had probably pegged her as a \u201cserial complainer\u201d\u2014among anti-noise crusaders, a dreaded fate.\n\nNoise codes tend to be either qualitative (prohibiting subjectively defined \u201cdisturbing\u201d or \u201cunreasonably loud\u201d noise) or quantitative (defining, in measurable terms, what constitutes disturbing or unreasonably loud noise). New York City\u2019s noise code, which is the latter, considers barking a nuisance only if a dog yaps for 10 minutes straight between the hours of 7 a.m. and 10 p.m., or for five minutes straight between the hours of 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. (Four and a half minutes of barking at 2 a.m. is, technically, permissible.) At night, restaurants can be fined if their music measures in excess of 42 decibels from inside a nearby apartment and seven decibels above the level of ambient street sounds. Most ordinances correlate punishable noise with loudness, though if you\u2019ve ever tried to sleep through a dripping faucet, you know that something can be quiet and still drive you up the wall. Research confirms that what makes a sound annoying is only partially whether it whispers or roars. The volume at which noise begins to irritate varies depending on the source\u2014we tolerate trains at louder volumes than cars, and cars at louder volumes than planes\u2014and its pitch, or frequency. (Humans can hear sounds between 20 and 20,000 hertz, which roughly ranges from the low-frequency thump of subwoofers to the high-frequency buzz of certain crickets.) We are more sensitive to mid-frequency sounds\u2014voices, birdsong, squealing brakes, shrieking infants\u2014and perceive these sounds as louder than they are. Contrary to the stereotype of the old man shaking his fist, age and gender are not necessarily strong predictors of annoyance.\n\nNor must noises be heard in order to harm. Earplugs may dull the whine of motorcycles chugging outside your bedroom, but they\u2019re useless against the engines\u2019 low-frequency rumble, which vibrates the windows, floors, and your chest, and is the type of sound that\u2019s largely ignored in most official noise calculations. (Harley-Davidson, which considers that thudding a point of pride, tried to trademark the sound of its V-twin motorcycle engine, which its lawyer translated as \u201cpotato potato potato\u201d said very fast.) When regulatory officials evaluate environmental noise\u2014to determine, say, whether to soundproof schools near airport runways\u2014their calculations emphasize the mid-frequency sounds to which our ears are most sensitive and discount the low-frequency sounds (think wind turbines, washing machines, kids galloping upstairs) that have been shown to travel farther and trigger stronger stress responses. \u201cIf you actually measured sound using the right metric, you\u2019ll see that you\u2019re harming a lot more people than you think you are,\u201d says Walker, the environmental-health researcher, who is working with communities near flight paths and freeways to rethink how noise is quantified. Not only was the whine agitating\u2014EHHNNNNNNNN\u2014but its constant drone was like a cruel mnemonic for everything that bothered him. Years ago, the staff of a medical-equipment company became spooked by recurring sightings of a gray, spectral figure haunting their lab. One night, an engineer working late alone felt a chill pass through the room and, out of the corner of his eye, saw a soundless figure hovering beside him. When he wheeled around, no one was there. The next day, while adjusting one of the machines in the lab, he began to feel the same creeping unease. The poltergeist? A vibrating extractor fan, he realized. He published a paper on his ghost-busting, which concluded that the machine was emitting low-frequency sound waves: pulses of energy too low in frequency to be heard by humans, yet powerful enough to affect our bodies\u2014comparable, he found, to the inaudible vibrations in a supposedly haunted cellar and in the long, windy hallways that appear in scary stories. In addition to causing shivering, sweating, difficulty breathing, and blurry vision as a result of vibrating eyeballs, low-frequency sounds can also, apparently, produce ghosts.\n\nRead: City noise might be making you sick For two years, Thallikar complained to anyone who would listen and even to those who would not. Meanwhile, CyrusOne kept building. The company finished three new buildings and bought 29 more acres of land in Chandler, growing the site to more than 85 acres. In a press release, it congratulated itself for \u201censuring CyrusOne maintains the largest data center campus in the Southwest and one of the largest in the United States,\u201d and cheered plans to build a comparable facility in California. Some nights, Thallikar couldn\u2019t sleep at all. He started wearing earplugs during the day, and stopped spending time outdoors. He looked for excuses to leave town and, in the evenings, returned to his old neighborhood in Tempe to take his constitutionals there. As he drove home, he\u2019d have a pit in his stomach. He couldn\u2019t stop himself from making the noise a recurring conversation topic at dinner. Not only was the whine itself agitating\u2014EHHNNNNNNNN\u2014but its constant drone was like a cruel mnemonic for everything that bothered him: his powerlessness, his sense of injustice that the city was ignoring its residents\u2019 welfare, his fear of selling his home for a major loss because no one would want to live with the noise, his regret that his family\u2019s haven (not to mention their biggest investment) had turned into a nightmare. EHHNNN. EHHNNNNNNNNN. EHHNNNNNNNNNNNN. He tried meditating. He considered installing new windows to dull the hum, or planting trees to block the noise. He researched lawyers. And he made one final appeal to the newly elected members of the Chandler city council.\n\nLo and behold, one wrote back, promising to look into the issue. The council member followed up a few weeks later. \u201cAccording to the chief, police had visited 16 times on the site and conducted investigations on your claim,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey found the noise level was not significant enough to cause an issue.\u201d Thallikar contacted a real-estate agent. He would lose money, and he\u2019d have to move to a smaller house, but by the end of 2017, he\u2019d decided to sell his home. To spend time with noise warriors is to become frustratingly attuned to every gurgle, squeal, clank, and creak. As I set out with Rueter and the three New Yorkers on the noise tour, the anonymous din of Flatbush Avenue splintered into a riotous skronk of bleating cars, rattling generators, and snarling planes. Sirens yowled and vents whistled; a motorcycle potato-potato-potatoed and a can skittered on the concrete. R. Murray Schafer, a Canadian composer who, in the 1960s, pioneered the field of acoustic ecology, has advocated \u201csoundwalks\u201d as an activity that, even more effectively than ordinances, could curb noise pollution by making people more aware of their habitat\u2019s acoustics. A soundwalk\u2014during which you actively listen to the sonic demeanor of your surroundings\u2014might involve tallying the number of car horns you hear in the course of an hour or scavenger-hunting for sounds with specific characteristics, like a buzz followed by a squeak. Schafer saw soundwalks as a way to address our sonological incompetence. Teach people to tune in to their soundscapes, and they will understand which sounds to preserve and which to eliminate, then act accordingly.\n\nThe first stop on our noise tour was, mercifully, a place of quiet. We gathered in silence around a small koi pond on the Brooklyn College campus. I forced myself to listen carefully. An air conditioner purred. Water burbled. A child hollered. \u201cSee, once a kid comes, that\u2019s when the screaming starts,\u201d Ashley said. She and Kanuri discussed the inefficacy of earplugs and the pros and cons of analog versus digital white-noise machines. Ashley said she slept with three white-noise machines (which hardly makes her an exception among the sound-sufferers I met) and, because of a whistler in her office, had started wearing earplugs at work. \u201cAre you familiar with something called slow TV?\u201d Kanuri asked Ashley. \u201cIt\u2019s a sailboat that runs 10 hours, and all you hear is the ship breaking water. That\u2019s it. Every now and then you\u2019ll hear bruhhhhh\u2014another ship that passes by. That\u2019s it. It\u2019s beautiful. It\u2019s beautiful.\u201d St\u00e9phane Pigeon, an audio-processing engineer based in Brussels, has become the Taylor Swift of white noise, traveling the world recording relaxing soundscapes for his website, myNoise.net, which offers its more than 15,000 daily listeners an encyclopedic compendium of noise-masking tracks that range from \u201cDistant Thunder\u201d to \u201cLaundromat,\u201d a listener request. (White noise, technically speaking, contains all audible frequencies in equal proportion. In the natural world, falling rain comes close to approximating this pan-frequency shhhhhh.) Impulse noises, such as honking, barking, hammering, and snoring, are the hardest to mask, but Pigeon has tried: While traveling in the Sahara, he recorded \u201cBerber Tent,\u201d a myNoise hit designed to help snorees by harmonizing the gentle whoosh of wind, the burble of boiling water, and the low rattle of snoring. Because covering up a snorer\u2019s brief, punchy HRROHN! is exceedingly difficult, \u201cthe goal is to try to persuade you that snoring could be a beautiful sound,\u201d Pigeon told me.\n\nAfter a few minutes at the pond, we reluctantly tore ourselves from the quiet to prowl Brooklyn\u2019s streets for sounds. Farther north on Flatbush Avenue, encircled by lowing horns and a wheezing Mister Softee truck, Kanuri used his sound-meter app to measure the ambient noise\u2014a disappointing 75.9 decibels, lower than everyone had thought but still more than 20 decibels above the threshold at which, per a 1974 EPA report, we get distracted or annoyed by sound. (Decibels, which measure volume, are logarithmic: Turn up a sound by 10 decibels, and most people will perceive its loudness as having doubled.) The soundscape shushed as we approached the stately brownstones near Prospect Park, then thumped to life again when we stopped for lunch at, of all places, Screamer\u2019s Pizzeria. \u201cWould it be possible during our short stay here to turn down the music?\u201d Rueter asked a server. Desperate ears call for desperate measures, and the noise-afflicted go to elaborate lengths to lower the volume. Kanuri taught himself to code so he could analyze New York City\u2019s 311 data and correlate noise complaints with elective districts; he hoped he could hold politicians accountable. Having tried moving bedrooms and also apartments, Ashley is now moving across the country, to a suburb in the Southwest. I spoke with a New Yorker who, unable to afford a move, has been sleeping in her closet\u2014armed with earplugs, headphones, an AC unit, a fan, and two white-noise machines. A Wisconsin man who\u2019d re-insulated, re-drywalled, and re-windowed his home was ultimately offered sleeping medication and antidepressants. An apartment dweller in Beijing, fed up with the calisthenics of the kids upstairs, got revenge by attaching a vibrating motor to his ceiling that rattled the family\u2019s floor. The gadget is available for purchase online, where you can also find Coat of Silence paint, AlphaSorb Bass Traps, the Noise Eater Isolation Foot, the Sound Soother Headband, and the Sonic Nausea Electronic Disruption Device, which promises, irresistibly, \u201cinventive payback.\u201d\n\nOne might also run for president. Arline Bronzaft, the New York City noise czar, speculates that Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign was motivated by his quest to quiet the aircraft that disrupted Mar-a-Lago\u2019s \u201conce serene and tranquil ambience\u201d\u2014so described in one of the lawsuits Trump filed in his 20-year legal battle against Palm Beach County. Six days after he was elected\u2014and the Federal Aviation Administration shared plans to limit flights over his resort\u2014a Trump spokesperson announced that he would abandon the lawsuit. Scientists have yet to agree on a definition for noise sensitivity, much less determine why some individuals seem more prone to it, though there have been cases linking sensitivity to hearing loss. What is clear, however, is that sound, once noticed, becomes impossible to ignore. \u201cOnce you are bothered by a sound, you unconsciously train your brain to hear that sound,\u201d Pigeon said. \u201cThat phenomenon just feeds itself into a diabolic loop.\u201d Research suggests habituation, the idea that we\u2019ll just \u201cget used to it,\u201d is a myth. And there is no known cure. Even for sufferers of tinnitus\u2014an auditory affliction researchers understand far better than noise sensitivity\u2014the most effective treatment that specialists can offer is a regimen of \u201cstandard audiological niceness\u201d: listening to them complain and reassuring them the noise won\u2019t kill them. Or, as one expert put it, \u201clending a nice ear.\u201d\n\nFrom October 2019: Rebecca Giggs on why whale songs are getting deeper During the summer of 2017, Cheryl Jannuzzi, who lived a short drive from Thallikar, in Clemente Ranch, began to hear humming coming from somewhere behind her house. For a while, she\u2019d had to endure the clang and beep of construction, but this was different\u2014like an endlessly revving engine, or a jet warming up for takeoff. Jannuzzi contacted the city, and was told that the complex directly across Dobson Road from her backyard was a data center. This was news to her, and she wasn\u2019t sure what to make of it. \u201cThey\u2019re just housing data,\u201d she thought. \u201cThat shouldn\u2019t be making so much noise.\u201d Around Halloween, Jennifer Goehring started to notice a buzzing sound. It gave her headaches and kept her up at night, but her husband couldn\u2019t hear it, and neither could her kids. She worried that she might be losing her mind. She began sleeping with sound machines and pillows over her head, and went to the doctor to be sure she didn\u2019t have an ear infection. She didn\u2019t. Noise is becoming autonomous and inexhaustible. Human noisemakers have to sleep, but our mechanical counterparts do not tire, die, or strain their vocal cords. Amy Weber was with her Bible-study group in her backyard when she became aware of a consistent tone that hummed above everyone\u2019s voices. She and her husband, Steve, had heard the construction on Dobson Road for ages, but this whirring sound didn\u2019t seem to stop, or change. They tried to identify it by process of elimination, even climbing out of bed one night to clear crud from their pool pump, which, they discovered, wasn\u2019t turned on.", "description": "The tech industry is producing a rising din.
