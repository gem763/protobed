The judges are getting involved in politics.\n\n\u201cI think that they are impartial, but I\u2019m saying that many people, many leave voters, many people up and down the country, are beginning to question the partiality of the judges.\u201d\n\nThe Labour MP David Lammy described Kwarteng\u2019s comments as shameful and said the minister had hidden behind \u201cmany leave voters \u2026 \u201d to attack the judges. He said: \u201cIt is completely wrong for government ministers to actively promote and encourage the subversion of the rule of law.\n\n\u201cPoliticians must respect the impartiality of judges, even if they do not like the result of their judgments. If they do not, our liberal democratic system will fall apart.\u201d\n\nDinah Rose QC, a human rights barrister at Blackstone Chambers, criticised Kwarteng\u2019s remarks as \u201cirresponsible and dangerous\u201d. She said: \u201cAlthough he has disavowed any personal belief that the Scottish judges are biased, his claim that \u2018many people\u2019 think that they are not impartial risks planting the seed of that belief, and has the effect, whether intentional or not, of implying that such a belief is reasonable.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cMutual respect between the courts and the government is fundamental to the proper functioning of our democracy. If the government disagrees with the Scottish judgment, it has a right of appeal to the supreme court, which it is currently exercising. If it thinks that the judges were not impartial, it may make that a ground of its appeal. To shy away from such a course, whilst insinuating a lack of impartiality is improper.\u201d\n\nRose called on the lord chancellor, Robert Buckland QC, to make it clear to all members of the government that such behaviour is \u201cinappropriate, and damaging\u201d.\n\nFormer Liberal Democrat leader Lord Menzies Campbell said the comments were ill-judged. \u201cI would expect a government minister to understand the importance of the independence of the judiciary and not make any comments that might undermine public perceptions.\u201d\n\nSusan D Shaw, managing partner, Living Law, Scotland, said: \u201cThe rule of law is the bedrock of our society and affects every aspect of our daily lives. Legal judgments \u2013 decisions on the law and proven facts \u2013 frequently have profound political ramifications. That does not make them political. Rather, that they are above bluster and bullying tactics.\n\n\u201cThis government needs to wake up and grasp the basics of our constitution. The ambit of executive discretion is not infinite. They promised the patently undeliverable and have acted as though they were above the law and beyond accountability. Where we are now is simply reality.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "description": "Comments made after Edinburgh court branded parliament suspension \u2018unlawful\u2019", "authors": ["Aamna Mohdin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a0d51a593570330c8a3c08f20cfdd2ca2461bcf/0_136_4078_2447/master/4078.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b465347e7b26643309fb27a3a4c6189c", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
