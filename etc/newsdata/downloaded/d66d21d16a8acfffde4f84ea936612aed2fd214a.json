She never treated me nicely,\u201d Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One during a flight from Albuquerque to Mountain View, Calif., Tuesday afternoon. \u201cBut I would like to wish her family well. She was a professional, and I respect professionals. I respect you guys a lot, you people a lot. She was a real professional. Never treated me well, but I certainly respect her as a professional.\u201d\n\nRoberts, 75, died of complications from breast cancer on Tuesday morning, her family said. She is survived by her husband, fellow journalist Steven Roberts, and their two children and six grandchildren.\n\nPresident Trump and Cokie Roberts.

Roberts was inducted into the Broadcasting and Cable Hall of Fame, and in 2008 she was named a \u201cLiving Legend\u201d by the Library of Congress.\n\nIt is unclear what alleged mistreatment Trump was referring to in his remarks. In November 2015 he took issue with Roberts\u2019s predictions in a tweet that misspelled her first name.\n\nJust watched Cookie Roberts on @ABC. Her predictions have been so wrong for so long that she has lost all credibility. Just another sad case \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 29, 2015\n\nWhite House counselor Kellyanne Conway paid her respects on Twitter.\n\n\u201cCokie Roberts was kind,\u201d Conway tweeted. \u201cShe disagreed agreeably. Cokie listened, offered advice, showed patience and poise, worked hard, put faith & family first. God bless. RIP.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s predecessors each released statements in memory of Roberts upon learning of her death.\n\n\u201cMichelle and I are sad to hear about the passing of Cokie Roberts,\u201d former President Barack Obama said in a statement. \u201cShe was a trailblazing figure; a role model to young women at a time when the profession was still dominated by men; a constant over forty years of a shifting media landscape and changing world, informing voters about the issues of our time and mentoring young journalists every step of the way. She will be missed \u2014 and we send our condolences to her family.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are deeply saddened that Cokie Roberts is no longer with us,\u201d former President George W. Bush and former first lady Laura Bush said in a joint statement. \u201cShe covered us for decades as a talented, tough, and fair reporter. We respected her drive and appreciated her humor. She became a friend. We know Steve, their children, and grandchildren are heartbroken. They have our sincere sympathies.\u201d\n\n\u201cI liked and respected Cokie Roberts very much,\u201d former President Bill Clinton tweeted Tuesday afternoon. \u201cShe understood people and politics. For nearly half a century, she was an institution in American journalism \u2014 tough but fair, insightful, and with a voice all her own. She\u2019ll be missed.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "\u201cShe never treated me nicely,\u201d President Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One when asked about the the death of Cokie Roberts. \u201cBut I would like to wish her family well.
