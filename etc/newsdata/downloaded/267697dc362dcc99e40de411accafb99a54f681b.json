Mediation could follow.\n\nSACA also on Wednesday expressed further frustration at their court application relating to CSA\u2019s decision to restructure domestic cricket.\n\nCSA is looking to expand the system from six franchises to 12 professional provincial sides - a decision that SACA wants overturned based on financial concerns that it has over player contracting and how the change would benefit the game economically in South Africa.\n\n\"In normal circumstances one would have expected the court application to be heard in or around October this year,\" said Irish.\n\n\"However failures on the part of CSA to comply with the time periods provided for in the rules of court have led to unnecessary delays.\n\n\"CSA also failed to respond for a long period to attempts to establish a process aimed at resolving the issues around the domestic restructure. All of this has obviously been very frustrating for SACA and it creates uncertainty for the players.\n\n\"SACA remains committed to the court application as this is necessary to deal with CSA\u2019s decision to unilaterally impose a new domestic structure on the players without consultation and in clear breach of signed agreements between SACA and CSA.\n\n\"This imposed structure, if allowed, would lead to a very significant number of provincial players losing their careers as professional cricketers and it would also give rise to the likelihood of substantial cuts in the earnings and benefits of franchises players.\n\n\"In addition we believe that it will weaken the standard of our top flight domestic cricket across playing formats, at a time when we can ill afford to do this.\"\n\nSACA have requested to see exactly how a domestic restructure would be financially viable, but they maintain that they have been excluded from such information.\n\n\"None of our concerns on this front have been dealt with,\" said Irish.\n\n\"Instead we are now excluded from attending CSA\u2019s finance and commercial committee meetings.\n\n\"I wish to emphasise that despite all of this SACA remains willing to sit down with CSA in a genuine and good faith attempt to resolve these issues.\n\n\"We wish to play a responsible role in dealing with the financial picture and we know that many of the issues require mutually agreed solutions. This has to happen however in the context of good faith engagement between us, as the representative of the players, and CSA.\"\n\nSport24 contacted CSA for comment on Wednesday afternoon and is awaiting a reply.", "description": "The already strained relationship between Cricket South Africa and the South African Cricketers Association has taken another turn for the worse.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8061/3c477d2a4eb348b4ae4c8f182fa95e40.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
