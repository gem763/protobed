Ilhan Omar, Minnesota Democrat, called for Twitter to suspend Mr. Trump last month after he shared a video that falsely claimed to show her partying during the recent anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attack.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris similarly began pressing Twitter to take action after Mr. Trump recently used his account to target the unknown whistleblower that prompted Democrats to launch an impeach inquiry against the president last month.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump has 65 million followers on Twitter and we have to take seriously the weaponization of this platform by the president and the need, therefore, of a private corporation to be held accountable to say he has abused the terms and it could result literally in a threat to safety of human beings who are participating in the process of justice,\u201d Ms. Harris, California Democrat and 2020 presidential hopeful, said during Thursday\u2019s fourth Democratic presidential candidate debate.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
