(Photo: Steve Apps / Wisconsin State Journal)\n\nMADISON, Wis. \u2013 A high school security guard in Madison, Wisconsin got his job back Monday after outrage over his termination spread across the country, prompting school district officials to overturn their decision to fire him for saying the N-word while urging a student not to call him the racial slur.\n\nMarlon Anderson told supporters Monday his termination from the Madison School District was rescinded, five days after he was fired over the episode that drew outcry from thousands \u2013 including the former U.S. secretary of education and superstar Cher.\n\n\"I'm back!!\" Anderson posted on Facebook. \"Now we have to address the policy!! God is good!!!!\"\n\nA spokeswoman for the Madison School District did not immediately confirm Anderson's announcement, but Madison Teachers Inc. union executive director Doug Keillor said Anderson will receive full pay and benefits until his return to school is finalized.\n\n\u201cMTI is pleased to see the District rescind the termination of Marlon Anderson, paving the way for him to return to the incredible work he does with Madison\u2019s students,\" Keillor said.\n\nAnderson was fired under a zero-tolerance policy district officials adopted after firing or forcing to resign six district employees for using racial slurs in front of or at students.\n\nBut Anderson, who is black, was fired for telling a student who also is black not to use the racial slur while repeating it himself in making his point.\n\nMore than 1,000 students \u2013 including Anderson's own son \u2013 walked out of classrooms Friday to protest the school district's decision. Days later, the district relented.\n\nAnderson said he will instead be placed on paid administrative leave while he and district officials negotiate a \"transition plan.\"\n\nOn Oct. 9, Anderson was escorting a disruptive male student out of Madison's West High School building when the student started calling Anderson the N-word after pushing the school's assistant principal and threatening to beat her up.\n\nIn responding to the abusive language, Anderson says he said the word himself in making a point to the student not to use it. The assistant principal turned on her portable two-way radio, allowing school administrators to hear the exchange, Anderson said.\n\n\"Every type of N-word you can think of, that\u2019s what he was calling me,\" Anderson told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel on Friday. \"I said, do not call me that name. I'm not your N-word. Do not call me that.\"\n\nWest High School Principal Karen Boran later that week pulled Anderson aside, he said, and told him he had \"an uphill battle\" to keep his job.\" And in a letter Wednesday, Boran told parents a staff member \u2013 Anderson \u2013 would not be returning to the school after an investigation of the incident.\n\n\"As you know, our expectation when it comes to racial slurs has been very clear,\" Boran wrote. \"Regardless of context or circumstance, racial slurs are not acceptable in our schools.\"\n\nAnderson called the policy \"lazy.\"\n\n\"You can\u2019t eliminate racism by ignoring it \u2013 by trying to hide the word or by trying to legislate the word,\" he said. \"What if a white student calls a black student an N-word but doesn\u2019t say the word? It's the intent behind what you\u2019re saying.\"\n\n'Disrespectful': Black school guard fired for telling student not to call him the N-word by using it himself\n\nAnderson's reinstatement came after Madison School Board President Gloria Reyes asked district officials to give the 11-year district veteran his job back.\n\nThe school board had until then largely stayed quiet on the details of the incident, but board member Savion Castro on Saturday called the situation \"incredibly frustrating.\"\n\n\"While I can't comment on the specifics of Marlon Anderson's case because I would limit potential options to remedy in the future, I can say the situation is incredibly frustrating because a black man and black child were sharing an incredibly vulnerable moment together in one of our schools,\" said Castro, who is one of two board members who are black. \"Historically, educational spaces have disciplined black and brown bodies out of those spaces for simply being who we are, including language.\"\n\nWhile Anderson has been away from his job, a colleague started a fundraiser to help Anderson and his family. As of Monday, the effort had raised more than $12,000 for the Anderson family.\n\nFollow Molly Beck on Twitter: @MollyBeck.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/22/wisconsin-security-guard-fired-telling-student-not-use-slur-rehired/4061355002/", "description": "Marlon Anderson's termination from\u00a0the Madison School District was rescinded, five days after he was fired over the episode that drew outcry.", "authors": ["Molly Beck", "Published A.M.
