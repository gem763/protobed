In the second, Nadal went up 5-1 before Schwartzman made it 5-all.\n\nTook more than two hours just for those two sets. Eventually, both were claimed by Nadal. And so, ultimately, was the match and a berth in a 33rd Grand Slam semifinal for Nadal, who prevented Schwartzman from reaching his first by winning 6-4, 7-5, 6-2 after 12:30 a.m. Thursday in Arthur Ashe Stadium.\n\n\u201cLike a lion in the \u2026 jungle. He\u2019s big. He\u2019s a fighter. He knows how to play the important moments, every single time,\u201d Schwartzman said. \u201cI\u2019ve played him eight times and every important moment, he played better than me.\u201d\n\nNo wonder Nadal is 8-0 against the guy.\n\nRoger Federer and Novak Djokovic are both out of the bracket, but Nadal is still around, meaning at least one member of the Big Three is in the semis at a 62nd consecutive major tournament. That trio has combined to win the last 11 Slam trophies - and Nadal is going to be heavily favored to make that 12.\n\nNone of the other men left has played in a major final, let alone won one. Nadal, though, is closing in on a fourth championship at the U.S. Open and his 19th at all majors, which would move him within only one of Federer\u2019s record for men.\n\nOn Friday, Nadal will play No. 24 Matteo Berrettini, a 23-year-old from Rome who is Italy\u2019s first male semifinalist in New York since 1977. Berrettini barely got there, edging No. 13 Gael Monfils 3-6, 6-3, 6-2, 3-6, 7-6 (5) on Wednesday.\n\nThe other men\u2019s semifinal will be No. 5 Daniil Medvedev of Russia vs. 78th-ranked Grigor Dimitrov of Bulgaria.\n\nIn the women\u2019s semifinals Thursday, Serena Williams meets No. 5 Elina Svitolina of Ukraine, and No. 13 Belinda Bencic of Switzerland takes on No. 15 Bianca Andreescu of Canada.\n\nDimitrov won a five-setter Tuesday night against Federer, who was hampered by an issue with his upper back. Medvedev won his quarterfinal in four sets against Stan Wawrinka, who had built a big lead in the fourth round against Djokovic when the defending champion stopped because of pain in his left shoulder.\n\nA year ago, it was Nadal whose body broke down: He retired from his semifinal against runner-up Juan Martin del Potro because of a bad knee.\n\nThis time, on a muggy night with the humidity above 50%, the left-hander raised some concern by having a trainer come out to rub a cream into that forearm during a changeover early in the third set. At the next changeover, Nadal flexed his right forearm and was visited again by the trainer, took a salt pill and guzzled some drinks, then shook that arm between points in the following game.\n\nAfterward, Nadal said he had dealt with cramps late in the second set and early in the third.\n\n\u201cAnd then I took some salt, that\u2019s all, and then it was over. The body is in good shape, I think. Not big problems,\u201d Nadal said. \u201cJust, of course, a little tired. Long day.\u201d\n\nStill, Nadal managed to play his best when it mattered the most against the 20th-seeded Schwartzman, an Argentine serenaded by loud choruses of \u201cOl\u00e9! Ol\u00e9! Ol\u00e9! Ol\u00e9!\u201d by an audience that included former San Antonio Spurs star Manu Ginobili.\n\nNadal came up with a service break in the last game of each of the opening two sets, then the last one he would need made it 4-2 in the third and he broke yet again to end it.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how,\u201d Schwartzman said, \u201cbut this guy is improving every time.\u201d\n\nNow Nadal becomes Berrettini\u2019s problem.\n\nBerrettini describes his mental coach as a big help and a best friend. They\u2019ve been speaking on the phone before and after every match. And they certainly had plenty to chat about when it came to this latest victory.\n\nBerrettini double-faulted away his initial match point and then needed four more to finally put away Monfils after nearly four hours.\n\n\u201cHe told me, \u2018I need to thank you, because I thought that everyone is born once and dies once. But during that match, I was born and died 15 or 16 times,\u2019\u201d Berrettini said about his conversation with the mental coach he\u2019s worked with for several years. \u201cI collapsed and got back up. I collapsed and got back up. That match point. Those other chances. I was down then I came back. It\u2019s a great source of pride for me.\u201d\n\nIn truth, the denouement was hardly a thing of beauty, with both men, clearly spent, fighting themselves and the tension of the moment as much as the guy on the other side of the net.\n\nMonfils finished with 17 double-faults but managed to avoid any throughout the entire, exhausting fifth set until he served at 6-5 - and then he had three in that game, plus another two in the deciding tiebreaker, often doubling over between points to rest and catch his breath.\n\n\u201cA very bad day for me, serving,\u201d Monfils said.\n\nBerrettini acknowledged the obvious afterward, too, saying he felt \u201ca little bit tight.\u201d\n\nYou think?\n\nIt all was a bit of a whir.\n\n\u201cRight now, I don\u2019t remember any points, just the (last) match point, you know?\u201d he said. \u201cI remember also the double-fault; I have to be honest.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP tennis: https://apnews.com/apf-Tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Rafael Nadal kept pulling away in his U.S. Open quarterfinal, then getting reeled back in by Diego Schwartzman.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Howard Fendrich"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/04/us_open_tennis_36089_c0-204-4867-3041_s1770x1032.jpg?7d33069716af4a41bb0b7311ba1708b8ed71ca2f"}
