Gabrielle Weaver\n\nThe M109A6 features improved armor and survivability over older variants of the M109, which allows howitzer batteries to fire from dispersed locations as well as reduce the time required to set up and fire its 155 mm (6 inch) howitzer.\n\nTaiwan is also reportedly looking to increase the range of its artillery rockets up to 190 miles, and was said to be weighing between acquiring the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System or developing a longer-ranged rocket for its Thunderbolt 2000 truck-mounted multiple rocket launcher.\n\nThe National Changshan Institute of Science and Technology, which developed and manufactured the Thunderbolt 2000, has successfully developed a rocket with a range of 63 miles and is confident it can develop an even longer range rocket.\n\nThis requirement is in response to China fielding artillery rockets capable of attaining such ranges, which would put Taiwan's west coast within range from mainland China. China sees Taiwan as a renegade province and has not ruled out the use of force to take back the island.\n\nThe Trump administration has ramped up arms sales to Taiwan in recent months, with the State Department clearing the sale of tanks, fighter jets and surface to air missiles. Under the Taiwan Relations Act passed by Congress in 1979, the US is committed to providing self-defense weapons to the self-governing island off China's coast.", "description": "China has fielded artillery rockets capable of reaching Taiwan's west coast, and Taipei is looking to acquire its own longer-range artillery.", "authors": ["Mike Yeo", "Defense News"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5c827ee726289830346ea1d5?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
