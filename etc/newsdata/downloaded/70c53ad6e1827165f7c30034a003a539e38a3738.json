Guyger was still in her police uniform after a long shift when, according to her trial testimony, she mistook Jean\u2019s apartment for her own one floor below and shot him after pushing open his unlocked door and thinking he was a burglar.\n\nBrown, 28, testified in Guyger\u2019s trial about the September 2018 night that Jean was killed, saying he was in a hallway on the fourth floor, where he and Jean lived. He said he heard what sounded like \u201ctwo people meeting by surprise\u201d and then two gunshots.\n\nBrown, who became emotional at times and used his T-shirt and tissues to wipe his tears, said he had met Jean, a 26-year-old accountant from the Caribbean island nation of St Lucia, for the first time earlier that day.\n\nGuyger, 31, was fired from the department soon after the shooting. She was convicted Tuesday and sentenced the next day to 10 years in prison.\n\n'I hate myself': Dallas officer testifies about night she killed unarmed black man Read more\n\nThe newspaper did not cite authorities by name for confirmation of Brown\u2019s death. A Dallas police spokesman on Saturday would not confirm to the Associated Press that it was Brown who was shot Friday. He said the Dallas County medical examiner\u2019s office would determine the identification Sunday.\n\nPolice said in a news release that they responded to the shooting shortly after 10.30pm Friday at an apartment complex different from the one where Jean was killed. They said several witnesses flagged officers down when they arrived and directed them to an apartment parking lot where the man who was shot was lying on the ground with multiple wounds.\n\nThe man was taken to a hospital, where he died.\n\nWitnesses told police they heard several gunshots and saw a silver four-door sedan speeding out of the parking lot, according to the police news release.\n\nLee Merritt, a lawyer for the Jean family, said in a tweet Saturday that he spoke with Brown\u2019s mother and that she is \u201cdevastated\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe all are,\u201d Merritt said. \u201cJoshua Brown was a key witness in the murder of Botham Jean that helped put Amber Guyger away. We need answers.\u201d\n\nIn a statement he included with the tweet, he said authorities have not identified a suspect or determined a motive.\n\nS. Lee Merritt, Esq.
