He is seen above leading federal court in Boston in May\n\nAuthorities say Sartorio paid in cash to avoid a paper trail.\n\nProsecutors had requested a month in prison and the fine.\n\nSartorio's lawyers asked for probation and a fine, saying he deserved leniency for being the first parent to plead guilty.\n\nIn an Oct. 4 court filing, Sartorio's lawyers said he's genuinely remorseful, adding that he's different than other, wealthier parents accused in the scheme.\n\n'Mr. Sartorio is a small-scale entrepreneur,' they wrote.\n\n'He is neither rich nor famous - and he has no aspirations to achieve either status.\n\n'Mr. Sartorio's nascent, small business has struggled since his arrest in this case and it is unclear whether it will survive.'\n\nSartorio owns Elena's Food Specialties, a San Francisco company that makes frozen natural food products.\n\nSartorio's sentence was lenient most likely due to the fact that he was among the first parents to have pleaded guilty. Felicity Huffman (left) received a two-week prison sentence after she pleaded guilty as well. Full House star Lori Loughlin (right) has chosen to fight the charges\n\nIn a letter to the court, his mother wrote that losing the business 'seems unavoidable' and that Sartorio will have to sell his home.\n\nThe testing scam gave his daughter an ACT score that ranked in the 86th percentile nationally, prosecutors said.\n\nThey said it helped her get into college 'at the expense of a more qualified candidate.'\n\nProsecutors said Sartorio kept the scheme hidden from his daughter.\n\nThey have not said which college she attended or whether she is currently enrolled.\n\nSartorio is among 15 parents who pleaded guilty in the scheme, which ensnared dozens of wealthy parents accused of paying bribes to cheat on college entrance exams or to get their children into elite schools as fake athletic recruits.\n\nThey include Desperate Housewives star Felicity Huffman, who was sentenced last month to 14 days in jail for paying $15,000 to rig her daughter's SAT scores.\n\nAnother 19 parents are fighting the charges, including Full House actress Lori Loughlin and her fashion designer husband, Mossimo Giannulli, who are accused of paying $500,000 to get their two daughters into the University of Southern California as fake athletes.\n\nThe seven parents sentenced before Sartorio all received prison sentences, ranging from 14 days to five months.\n\nThey were also ordered to pay fines ranging from $30,000 to $100,000.", "description": "Peter Jan Sartorio, of Menlo Park, California, was sentenced in federal court in Boston to a year of probation after pleading guilty in May to a single count of fraud and conspiracy.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/22/19608822-0-image-a-2_1570829174302.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
