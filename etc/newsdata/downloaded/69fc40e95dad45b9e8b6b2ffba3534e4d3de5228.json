Cigarette companies are pervasive in many aspects of Indonesians\u2019 lives and play a key role in the country\u2019s music, culture, and entertainment scene.\n\nEarlier this week, news broke that a youth badminton tournament held yearly by the Djarum Foundation, the humanitarian division of one of Indonesia\u2019s largest cigarette companies, would be cancelled after this year due to backlash from the Indonesian Commission for Child Protection (KPAI) and Yayasan Lentera Anak (YLA), a children\u2019s non-governmental organisation. Unsurprisingly, the cancellation of a much-awaited, high-profile event sparked outrage online.\n\nSome sports fans didn\u2019t take the news so well, resulting in the hashtag #BubarkanKPAI (#AbolishKPAI), which trended all day on Monday.\n\n\u201cThe 2019 auditions will be a farewell, because we have decided that in 2020, we will no longer hold public auditions,\u201d Yoppy Rasimin, Program Director of the Djarum Foundation\u2019s Sports Division, told local media. \u201cThis is unfortunate for many of us, but for the sake of everyone involved, it\u2019s best for us to put it to an end so the issue can simmer down and we can think straight.\u201d\n\nIndonesians have an impressive track record in badminton, even on the international stage. Local badminton superstars like Liem Swie King, Tontowi Ahmad, Lilyana Natsir, and Kevin Sanjaya, are all Djarum-bred athletes.\n\nDjarum\u2019s decision to stop public try-outs revealed a deep-seated problem in the coaching of Indonesia\u2019s young athletes. Large conglomerates \u2014 even the controversial ones \u2014 are the backbone of specialised athletic training. When controversial sponsors decide to withdraw from events, like in the case of Djarum, the government and private companies aren\u2019t always able to step in and take their place.\n\n\n\nAinur Rohman, a sports journalist for local media, said that the Djarum vs. KPAI scandal brings back painful memories for many, like when Gudang Garam, another cigarette giant, stopped coaching young table tennis players, or when Wismilak/Sampoerna, also a cigarette company, stopped training tennis players, resulting in a huge blow to the tennis industry.\n\nMany agree that the coaching of up-and-coming athletes should remain the responsibility of the private sector, while others believe the government should take charge. Handing over the reins to the government to continue such programs, as done by Djarum in this most recent case, isn\u2019t always ideal. Nurdin Purnomo, founder of the Indonesian Federation for Recreational Sports, echoes this sentiment, saying he prefers zero government involvement so that players of different sports don\u2019t have to fight over funding.\n\nThe controversy between Djarum and the KPAI, which has been ongoing since February, began when KPAI and YLA told reporters that the Djarum Badminton Scholarship Auditions, which have been held yearly since 2006, violate cigarette promotion regulations.\n\nThe regulation in question is Governmental Regulation No. 209 of 2012. Under this law, Djarum\u2019s usage of its logo and trademark at badminton auditions is considered brand imaging of tobacco products. According to the KPAI, such cigarette company-sponsored events should not involve children under 18.\n\nThe scandal intensified when this year\u2019s first badminton try-out was held in Bandung in July. \u201cThis badminton audition held by the Djarum Foundation is a form of veiled child exploitation by the cigarette industry,\u201d KPAI Commissioner Napza Sitti Hikmawatty said at a press conference a day after the audition.\n\nAccording to local media, the KPAI\u2019s definition of child exploitation is the transfer of knowledge to the children that Djarum is a cigarette brand. \u201cWe\u2019ve done a survey with the kids. Four out of five of them know that Djarum is a cigarette brand, and that the Djarum Foundation is synonymous with cigarettes. Even though they say Djarum is a separate entity from the Djarum Foundation, the survey results don\u2019t reflect that,\u201d Hikmawatty said.\n\n\u201cIf the Djarum Foundation wants to continue hosting such events, we have no problem as long as they scrap their logo,\u201d Hikmawatty continued.\n\nAfter discussions with the government, Djarum finally agreed to remove their logo and the name \u201cDjarum\u201d from the second audition in Purwokerto on Sunday. This was also when Djarum decided it would not hold auditions next year.\n\nDespite the backlash and the hashtag, the KPAI said that they are only responsible for pointing out the laws that apply to Djarum. \u201cThe KPAI didn\u2019t stop any badminton tournaments. The KPAI urges all parties to support young Indonesians to develop their talents and excel in sports. Indonesian youth\u2019s achievements will certainly have a positive impact on our nation,\u201d Susanto, head of the KPAI who goes by one name, told local media.\n\nMeanwhile, Seto Mulyadi, head of the Indonesian Children\u2019s Institute, believes Djarum acted immaturely in its decision to halt future auditions in response to KPAI pressure. He thinks that if Djarum wholeheartedly supported badminton as a sport, it would continue to train children while distancing the brand from the auditions, which includes not using funds from cigarette sales.\n\n\u201cWhere did their genuine and sincere interest in coaching children go? If they were serious, they wouldn\u2019t have stopped auditions for commercial reasons,\u201d Mulyadi told local media.\n\nHikmawatty said her organisation has held meetings with various ministries, including the Ministry of Women\u2019s Empowerment, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Youth and Sports, and the Ministry of Human Development and Culture regarding this issue. With Imam Nahrawi, the Minister of Youth and Sports, insisting Djarum\u2019s tournaments contain no element of child exploitation, the debate is set to continue.", "description": "A badminton tournament held yearly for Indonesia\u2019s youth by one of the country\u2019s largest cigarette companies will no longer continue after backlash from children\u2019s rights activists.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d761b0c666dcf000ea3e9f3/lede/1568021273853-Untitled-design-89.jpeg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
