Friends have had similar issues with breast-screening. What\u2019s going on?\n\nAge ranges apply to all of our national screening programmes, including breast-cancer screenings and smear tests designed to spot cervical cancer.\n\nThose aged between 25 and 50 will be offered a smear every three years. For women aged 50 to 65, it\u2019s every five years.\n\nDoctors should not offer smear tests to older women because the labs will refuse to process them.\n\nIt might seem that the system leaves people out. But these age ranges are scientifically proven to catch as many people as possible, and to do so safely.\n\nAll UK women aged 25 to 64 years old are eligible for cervical screening (pictured, stock image), which checks for abnormal changes in cells in the cervix caused by certain strains of human papillomavirus (HPV), and should receive automatic invitations\n\nOver-screening can cause significant harm to patients. Unnecessary tests, incorrect diagnoses and undue anxiety can be extremely distressing, and age ranges can help keep this to a minimum.\n\nA good example of this is tests for PSA in the blood, which can indicate prostate cancer. In some cases, there\u2019s no prostate cancer but the PSA blood test comes back positive, signalling lots of other benign conditions. These problems cause no harm, so there\u2019s little point in drawing attention to them.\n\nIf you had symptoms that indicated a cervical cancer, such as bleeding or pain during intercourse, doctors would of course intervene. But you\u2019d be referred to a gynaecologist for investigations, not for a smear.\n\nBreast-screening is offered every three years to women aged from 50 to 70.\n\nWomen over 71 are still eligible for screenings, even if they aren\u2019t invited. Arrange a screening by calling your local breast-screening service, or by asking your GP.\n\nI've recently found the hearing in my right ear is terrible. My GP said I had a collapsed eardrum, but I really don\u2019t want surgery. Is there an alternative?\n\nThe eardrum is a bit like a tambourine: it vibrates when sounds enter the ear.\n\nThe vibration is converted to mechanical movement through tiny bones, called ossicles, in the middle ear that are attached to the inside of the eardrum. This movement is then transmitted to the sound-sensitive cells of the inner ear, and to the hearing nerve deep inside the skull.\n\nWhen doctors say the eardrum is collapsed, what they mean is that it is pushed firmly one way, so it\u2019s firm and unable to move as easily as before \u2013 and your hearing deteriorates. Usually the pressure from the inside is caused by fluid or mucus from the middle ear \u2013 the part behind the window of the eardrum where the hearing bones are.\n\nThis should naturally drain away via a tiny channel called the eustachian tube. But if it\u2019s not working properly, fluid can stay and the eardrum remains stuck.\n\nThis is known as eustachian tube dysfunction and can occur in smokers and people with chronic sinus or nasal problems, for example from allergies.\n\nThe eardrum is a bit like a tambourine: it vibrates when sounds enter the ear (stock image)\n\nIt can be treated in various ways. Try, in turn, decongestant sprays or drops for the nose, saline sinus rinses and sprays such as Sterimar.\n\nAntihistamine tablets can help to ease congestion, as can a prescribed steroid nasal spray.\n\nRarely a collapsed eardrum may lead to a condition known as a cholesteatoma. This is a non-cancerous growth on the eardrum that can result in permanent hearing loss.\n\nIt is due to a build-up of dead skin cells on the collapsed eardrum. Surgery is highly recommended for this condition to safely remove the growth and restore normal hearing.\n\nDon't ban our snacks... make them healthier\n\nCheap, high-calorie, high-sugar and high-fat food seems to be offered to us at every turn.\n\nBut the idea of banning eating and drinking on public transport is simply bizarre.\n\nOutgoing Chief Medical Officer Dame Sally Davies suggested last week it would help turn the rising tide of obesity.\n\nCheap, high-calorie, high-sugar and high-fat food seems to be offered to us at every turn (stock image)\n\nOutgoing Chief Medical Officer Dame Sally Davies suggested last week the idea of banning eating and drinking on public transport\n\nBut I can\u2019t see how it would even be workable. For a start, do you only ban \u2018unhealthy\u2019 foods?\n\nThis kind of initiative misses the point.\n\nThe Government needs to keep pressuring industry to provide healthier options and stop pushing calorific snacks on us when we really don\u2019t need them.\n\nI'm amazed that four in ten GPs think charging patients \u00a325 for an appointment is a good idea, yet that\u2019s what a survey by GPs\u2019 magazine Pulse found.\n\nI\u2019m totally against this \u2013 \u00a325 would be crippling, and would stop the most vulnerable seeking help.\n\nBut what about a smaller charge? The 5p tax on plastic bags has made us all think about wasteful use, and that\u2019s just what we need to consider when it comes to the NHS.\n\nMore than a million GP hours are wasted each year through no-shows. The tiniest of sums \u2013 like the plastic-bags tax \u2013 may make patients think twice about their profligacy. What do you think?
