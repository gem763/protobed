He will not be up for parole until 2058\n\n'I didn\u2019t really meet Jason for a while and when I did, he seemed okay. If she liked and trusted him, then I was good with that \u2013 I knew that she was a good judge of character.\n\n'They married in June 2004 at their house in Mount Pleasant, Michigan, followed by a lovely reception at a hotel \u2013 I was bridesmaid and she seemed really happy.\n\n'They had their son Brody in October 2007 and I honestly thought they were doing well \u2013 there were few signs of what was going on behind closed doors.\n\n'Looking back though, there were subtle clues. I remember once we were at my grandma Mildred\u2019s house sitting in the front porch. \u201cJason can be such an ass,\u201d she told me out of the blue. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I asked. \u201cGive me examples.\u201d\n\nSteff (right) and her husband Jason Fish (left) seemed happy but Sarah later found out that he had violent tendencies\n\n'\u201cHe gives me crap about getting my toe nails painted,\u201d she told me. \u201cAnd he hates me listening to my 90\u2019s music \u2013 I have to turn it off when he\u2019s around. Maybe you need to communicate better,\u201d I suggested. \u201cMarriage is all about give and take.\u201d\n\n'Stephanie also didn\u2019t like the fact that Jason was obsessed cage fighting on the TV, something she hated. She told me he watched it all the time and she thought it was nasty.\n\n'He also bragged openly that his great uncle was a Chicago based serial killer called Albert Fish who apparently kidnapped children and ate them \u2013 he was so strange like that.\n\n'But she never told me that she was scared of Fish, or that she thought he would hurt her, so we assumed that everything was okay.'\n\nSteff (left) their mother (centre) and Sarah (right) on Steff's wedding day when she married Jason. Pictured in 2007\n\nHowever, she says that Sunday November 20th 2011 will be etched in her mind forever.\n\n'I was studying for exams so I left my ringer off, only to have found many missed calls from mom. I had also just looked on Facebook and saw my mom's post dated November 18 asking if anybody had heard from Stephanie.\n\n'\u201cMom what\u2019s going on?\u201d I asked when she answered the phone. There was such panic in her voice. \u201cStephanie isn\u2019t picking-up her phone,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd Fish told me that she has left him for another man.\u201d\n\n'\u201cWell that\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d I said. \u201cFor one she wouldn\u2019t cheat on her husband and two, she would never, ever leave her son. He\u2019s lying.\u201d'\n\nWhen her mother phoned Sarah (right) to tell her that her sister Steff's (left) had been found she fell to the floor in shock. Pictured the sisters on her wedding day in 2007\n\n'I was scared, shocked and confused. Nothing added-up and my sister was missing. The police found Stephanie\u2019s jeep at the back of their property stuck in mud and again, she wouldn\u2019t just have dumped her car \u2013 that Jeep was her pride and joy!\n\n'I started to make plans to drive to Michigan but at about 4am, my phone rang again \u2013 it was mom and my grandma Mildred both on the phone and they were hysterical.\n\n'\u201cThe police have found Stephanie\u2019s body in the crawl space under the house,\u201d mom cried. \u201cShe was slightly buried in gravel and she had been shot twice in the head. She was also covered in bruises all over her body.\u201d\n\n'\u201cOh my God,\u201d was all I could say. I fell to the ground in shock \u2013 I didn\u2019t know what to say or to think \u2013 my sister was dead. It didn\u2019t seem real.'\n\nSteff (left) their mother (middle top) their grandmother (middle bottom) and Sarah before Steff's murder\n\n'My friend Tausha was staying with me to study thank goodness and because my husband Sal was in Cuba on work, my other friend Katy drove with me from Florida to Michigan.\n\n'I felt petrified to leave for Michigan because it would make my loss just a bit more real. I couldn\u2019t get my head around what was happening \u2013 my sister had been murdered.\n\n'Her body had been dragged, dumped and buried in gravel. My sweet, smart sister was the strongest person I had ever known and it was difficult to imagine my world without her in it.\n\n'Apparently Fish and Brody were taken in by the police for questioning on Sunday November 20 after Stephanie\u2019s jeep had been found.\n\nFish and Brody were taken in by the police for questioning on Sunday November 20th after Stephanie\u2019s jeep had been found\n\n'Specially trained officers spoke with Brody while he was colouring and he dropped the bombshell: \u201cDaddy put mommy in the bath tub and shot her with a gun, bang, bang!\u201d\n\n'Fish was arrested and then charged and he told them where my sister\u2019s body was \u2013 it was horrific but we were thankful that they had found her body.\n\n'I remember when I saw Stephanie for the first time at the funeral home. The first thing I noticed was her thick, blonde hair and I was hesitant, terrified and weak as I approached her.\n\n'Then I touched her arm with mine and I saw looked at her face, swollen and covered in bruises with a hole in her cheek and in the back of her head, a stitched-up eye from where a bullet exited.\n\nSarah's husband Sal (left) Brody (middle) and Sarah in 2012 as they celebrated Brody's birthday\n\n'All I wanted her to do was just to wake-up, open her eyes and hope this was not real. It was so hard to leave her behind in that room, alone.\n\n'The last time I saw Stephanie we sadly argued and to this day I still don\u2019t know what it was all about, only that somehow Fish started it about something really silly.\n\n'We were at grandma Mildred\u2019s house for the weekend \u2013 I had come to Michigan from Florida where I was studying \u2013 and it was supposed to have been family time with my mom Denise, Steph, Fish and Brody, who I adored.\n\n'Stephanie and I argued, I think it was something to do with Brody and Fish \u2013 how I wished that I hadn\u2019t done that and now there were no more chances to see my beautiful sister, It was all so unfair.\n\n'I dropped out of my associates degree in Florida and stayed in Michigan with my mom while I fought for custody of Brody. Fish\u2019s ex-Wendy and his sister Meghan both fought me for him but 10 weeks later, I turned into \u2018insta-mom\u2019 when I was awarded full custody.\n\nBrody graduating pre-kindergarten in 2012 with Sarah, his now legal guardian posing with him\n\n'Thankfully, the court process was fast. In April 2012 Jason Fish, then 35, pled no contest to second degree murder and in May 2012, on my birthday, he was sentenced to 45-67 and a half years for the November 18 murder of my sister. He will not be up for parole until 2058 \u2013 it was a fitting although bittersweet birthday gift for me knowing he will probably never get out.\n\n'Fish has never shown any remorse for murdering my sister, nor has he given an explanation. All I know is that Jason Fish was obsessed with violence and for whatever reason, Stephanie bore the brunt of his anger that weekend.\n\n'I remember it was Brody who gave us some insight into his parent\u2019s relationship. At a session with a trauma specialist, he was asked to draw out the story of Stephanie and Fish.\n\n'Fish was always \u201cbig scary angry\u201d and Stephanie was \u201csad, and very afraid\u201d \u2013 this told me that my sister dealt with so much during her time married to Brody\u2019s father, and she hid it all so very well.\n\n'Sal and I adopted Brody in January 2013 and he calls us mommy and daddy. At first, I struggled with that because Stephanie is his mom but then I realized that yes, I am stepping up for my sister and I am definitely his mom.\n\n'It\u2019s not been easy. Brody has had major issues over the years when he was defiant and argumentative a lot of the time. Since Sal and I had our kids Tommy, three and Stella, born May 2018, Brody has really settled down as the big brother in the family and he\u2019s found his place.\n\n'We talk about Stephanie all the time \u2013 if Brody, now 12, wants to I talk about her for hours. He will never have any contact with his father in prison and while he does know that his father hurt his mom, he still doesn\u2019t understand it.\n\n'But for now, we try to be the best parents to Brody and he is growing-up in a kind, loving home where he is understood and where every day he gets to live in a happier world than the one he suffered in the past.\n\n'I will miss Stephanie eternally and it\u2019s Brody who gave me the will to carry on after she died. I hope she\u2019s happy with the job I\u2019m doing with Brody but I wish more than anything things were different.", "description": "Sarah LaMantia, 35, from Maryland, reveals how her sister Steff was shot by her jealous husband Jason - who had\u00a0bragged about his famous serial killer uncle and was obsessed with violence.", "authors": ["Sharon Keeble For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/18/19796522-0-image-a-27_1571246256626.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
