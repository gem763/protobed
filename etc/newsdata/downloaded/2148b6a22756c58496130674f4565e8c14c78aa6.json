As a reminder, Hunter Biden was paid $50,000 per month to sit on the board of a Ukrainian gas company, despite having no experience in the field. He was paid while his father served during President Barack Obama's tenure in the White House. The Daily Beast was first to report:\n\n\u201cCNN is rejecting the ad, as it does not meet our advertising standards,\u201d a network spokesperson told The Daily Beast. \u201cSpecifically, in addition to disparaging CNN and its journalists, the ad makes assertions that have been proven demonstrably false by various news outlets, including CNN.\u201d \u201cCNN spends all day protecting Joe Biden in their programming, so it\u2019s not surprising that they\u2019re shielding him from truthful advertising too, and then talking to other media outlets about it,\u201d Trump 2020 communications director Tim Murtaugh responded in a statement. \u201cOur ad is entirely accurate and was reviewed by counsel, and CNN wouldn\u2019t even describe to us what they found objectionable. This isn\u2019t a cable news channel anymore, it\u2019s a Democrat public relations firm.\u201d\n\nHere's the ad in question:\n\nI AM DRAINING THE SWAMP! pic.twitter.com/U7WxKrO6Kx \u2014 Donald J.
