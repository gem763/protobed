Based on a tweet posted Friday, director James Gunn confirmed every single casting rumor you\u2019ve heard about Suicide Squad\u2019s upcoming sequel. Margot Robbie will return as Harley Quinn, Viola Davis as Squad mastermind Amanda Waller, Jai Courtney as Captain Boomerang, and Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flag. They\u2019ll officially be joined by Pete Davidson, Jon Cena, Taika Waititi, Idris Elba and Nathan Fillion.\n\nAaaaaaaand David Dastmalchian, Sean Gunn, Daniela Melchior, Joaqu\u00edn Cosio, Flula Borg, Mayling Ng, Storm Reid, Steve Agee, Alice Braga, Peter Capaldi, Juan Diego Botto, Julio Ruiz, Tinashe Kajese, Jennifer Holland and Michael Rooker. Honest to God, they\u2019re going to be just fine with numbers like these. Meanwhile, some fans took umbrage at the fact Jared Leto (and thereby Jared Leto\u2019s take on the Joker) was not among the names listed, but you never know with that guy. Not appearing in an official casting announcement is just the kind of perverse, twisted thing Jared Leto\u2019s Joke would think to do.
