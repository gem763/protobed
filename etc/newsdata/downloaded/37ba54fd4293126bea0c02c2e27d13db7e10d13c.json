Would he not rather say to him, \u2018Prepare something for me to eat. Put on your apron and wait on me while I eat and drink. You may eat and drink when I am finished\u2019? Is he grateful to that servant because he did what was commanded? So should it be with you. When you have done all you have been commanded, say, \u2018We are unprofitable servants; we have done what we were obliged to do.\u2019\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, friends in my Irish-language group noted that this week marked the anniversary of Janis Joplin\u2019s death at 27 years old. (We have lots of interesting conversations in our group, a surprising small percentage of which are about or in Irish.) As a joking tribute, I translated one of Joplin\u2019s better-known lyrics into Irish: O Thiarna, nach cheann\u00f3idh t\u00fa m\u00e9 Mercedes Benz? Readers probably don\u2019t need to know any Gaeilge to know what that says, although I don\u2019t vouch for the complete accuracy of the translation. That\u2019s the safest position when it comes to translating from or to Irish, trust me.\n\nReading today\u2019s brief Gospel passage reminds me of Joplin\u2019s song, which manages to critique consumerism, hypocrisy, selfishness, and outcome-based faith all in one unforgettable, four-stanza, a cappella performance. Both this passage and Joplin\u2019s song cuts to the heart of our life in faith by asking tough questions. How do we pray? And just as importantly, do we approach God, or demand that He approach us?\n\nThe passage starts out with the apostles asking Jesus to \u201cincrease our faith.\u201d The request sounds as though the apostles think it is Jesus\u2019 responsibility alone to increase it. Faith is indeed a gift from the Lord, but it is a gift that requires cooperation and formation on the part of the recipient. The apostles have already been given faith, plus they have Christ among them as a teacher. It is difficult to imagine how the Father could be more generous or provide them with more assistance to have them work to increase their faith.\n\nThus we have Jesus\u2019 response to the apostles, and to all those who expect salvation to be handed to them. It is not enough, Jesus teaches, to just do what you\u2019re told. One does not get an invitation to attend the banquet of eternal life merely by doing \u201cwhat we were obliged to do.\u201d It takes more than that to embrace salvation; it takes a genuine effort to form one\u2019s self to the will of the Lord, rather than ask the Lord to form Himself to ours.\n\nThis is what faith is \u2014 trusting in God beyond ourselves. We only see our own agendas, desires, hurts, and ambitions, not the Lord\u2019s plans for all. There\u2019s nothing wrong with Mercedes Benz cars, color TVs, and nights on the town per se, but those aren\u2019t the point of life. There\u2019s nothing much good about violence, ruin, and misery either, about which we hear in our first reading from Habakkuk today. Those are the circumstances of a fallen world, but as the prophet teaches, we must have faith that the Lord has our best interests at heart in the end as He opens the paths for us to reach Him:\n\nThen the LORD answered me and said: Write down the vision clearly upon the tablets, so that one can read it readily. For the vision still has its time, presses on to fulfillment, and will not disappoint; if it delays, wait for it, it will surely come, it will not be late. The rash one has no integrity; but the just one, because of his faith, shall live.\n\nNow, that\u2019s not an easy lesson to hear, let alone to follow. We are used to an action/reaction paradigm in which we see immediate benefit from correct choices and immediate detriment from bad choices. This is what confuses Habakkuk in the beginning of that first reading, when the prophet laments the consequences of the fallen world. \u201cDestruction and violence are before me; there is strife, and clamorous discord,\u201d he proclaims. We look at this and wonder what the point is of forming ourselves to the Lord, and even more so when we don\u2019t get the Mercedes Benz.\n\nThat misses the point, of course; the point of prayer and of faith is not to see what the Lord will give us in material wealth, or even spiritual health when we do not work to make ourselves spiritually healthy. The transitory circumstances of our lives should not affect our faith in the Lord, but should push us even more to form ourselves to Him. The Lord wants us to persevere to come to Him for salvation, prepared for eternal life rather than reacting to temporal circumstances. All of this will pass, just as surely as it ever has; all that will be left is the Lord and the status of our formation to Him.\n\nThat is how we should pray, and the outcome for which we should work. As St. Paul reminded Timothy in our second reading:\n\nGod did not give us a spirit of cowardice but rather of power and love and self-control. So do not be ashamed of your testimony to our Lord, nor of me, a prisoner for his sake; but bear your share of hardship for the gospel with the strength that comes from God.\n\nGod didn\u2019t give us a Mercedes Benz, either. But the good news is that we don\u2019t need it to travel to the Lord.\n\nThe front-page image is a detail from \u201cThe Communion of the Apostles,\u201d late 19th century, by James Tissot.
