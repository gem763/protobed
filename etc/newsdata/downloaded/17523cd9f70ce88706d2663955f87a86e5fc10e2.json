It\u2019s not going to stop overnight and we just have to keep on drumming it into people that it\u2019s not acceptable.\n\n\u201cObviously it (Bulgaria) was a difficult experience. What we wanted to do was just play our football, to win the game. That\u2019s what we did. When stuff like that happens you have to try and block it out even though it is so blatant.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\u201cWe just wanted to go out there, play our game and win the game. The manager spoke to us after and said there was help there if needed. It\u2019s just one of those things that happened.\u201d\n\nTomori also emphasised the importance of Chelsea not losing in Ajax because their Group is on a knife edge but insists he will embrace the pressure.\n\nHe added: \u201cFor sure, we are a young team and we always talk about playing in the Champions League. These are the kind of games we have to be playing in. High pressure games.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited and we\u2019re relishing the opportunity and hopefully tomorrow we can go out and put in a good performance to put ourselves in a good position for the next round of group games.\u201d\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nMeanwhile, the Chelsea Pride fan group have called for long-standing fan Dave Johnstone to stand down from his position as co-chair of the Chelsea Supporters\u2019 Trust group after homophobic comments emerged on social media.\n\nJohnstone, who has edited a fanzine and is well known by the club\u2019s players and staff, insists the comments have been taken out of context. Chelsea insist that the Trust is an independent fans\u2019 group.", "description": "Chelsea defender Fikayo Tomori was part of the England squad which suffered racist abuse in Bulgaria last week", "authors": ["John Cross", "Image", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20701228.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Champions-League-Chelsea-Press-Conference.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
