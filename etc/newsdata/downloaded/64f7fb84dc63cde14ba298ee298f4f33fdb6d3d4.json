DFL is a derogatory term for someone who has moved down from London to the South Downs market town.\n\nGill said the attacker struck his kitchen window at 1.20am but he could not see who it was when he went into the dark street.\n\nTory MPs beware: if you whip up an angry mob, they may end up angry with you | Marina Hyde Read more\n\n\u201cThe brick was on the worktop and scrawled on it was the word \u2018traitor\u2019 on one side and on the other \u2018stop this brick\u2019,\u201d he said. While his son was very upset, he said he was not intimidated.\n\n\u201cWe are heading towards an environment where this is the norm,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s being built up with this language about surrender. [In parliament on Wednesday] Boris Johnson looked like a school bully, goading. It\u2019s disgusting. The timing is relevant because I have had the poster up since May.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Sussex police said: \u201cThe three incidents are being treated as politically motivated and are believed to be linked.\u201d\n\nLewes voted 52% to remain in the 2016 EU referendum, but re-elected a pro-Brexit Conservative MP, Maria Caulfield, in 2017.\n\nPam Thurschwell, 53, a Jewish resident, said: \u201cWhat goes on on the streets and what goes on in parliament are not separate. We have a divided country and this is the fallout. I feel like we are in some version of Germany. This is not about my Jewishness, it\u2019s happening to everyone in this country and it is chilling. There is a problem in No 10 and everybody needs to calm down.\u201d\n\n\u201cLewes is known for being a creative and open market town,\u201d said Oli Henman, the Liberal Democrat parliamentary candidate for Lewes. \u201cBut some people have been left behind and have been deliberately targeted by the Brexit messaging and have gone along with the notion of blaming outsiders. Boris Johnson\u2019s recent language has served to reduce trust in our democracy and intensify divisions, creating an uncivil atmosphere which emboldens extremist views.\u201d\n\nHours before the attacks, Caulfield said her car tyres had been damaged with nails and screws.\n\nMaria Caulfield MP (@mariacaulfield) Last week I had my car tyres damaged with nails and screws for the second time. No one cares because I\u2019m a leaver and apparently deserve it. Abuse of MPs and death threats were happening long before yesterday\n\nIn May, another Lewes resident, Ian McCrae, had a \u201cI\u2019m in\u201d campaign poster in his window and saw his house daubed with graffiti, which read: \u201cMacron, trator [sic], traitor\u201d. Another house displaying Stop Brexit posters had its windows put in.\n\nLewes bonfire society agrees to stop blacking up in annual parade Read more\n\nMick Symes, a senior figure in Lewes Borough Bonfire Society, which itself has been embroiled in rows about blackface, sought to calm tensions on Friday. He wrote on Facebook: \u201cWhatever the political views of the residents of Lewes Sussex, there is total unity in condemnation of such offensive and unacceptable actions. Anyone who has to stoop to this or throw bricks through windows that display a political opinion, has nothing meaningful to say. Whoever you are you need help and urgently. You will be caught and you will be vilified by the entire town.\u201d", "description": "Incidents in East Sussex town included smashing of anti-Brexit campaigner\u2019s window and antisemitic graffiti", "authors": ["Robert Booth", "Rachel Shabi", "Faiza Shaheen"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de9dde6baef32404fcae2d8002ad99450e93d2d9/0_366_3796_2277/master/3796.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9f4abf3e193f3a1f41466af213f4cdc2", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
