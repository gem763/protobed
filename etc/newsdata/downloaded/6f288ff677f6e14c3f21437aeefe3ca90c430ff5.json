He has been a prominent supporter of a second Brexit referendum and called for a public vote before any general election \u2013 in direct contradiction of Labour\u2019s policy.\n\nFollowing the \u200battempt to abolish his position, Watson warned there was a \u201cbattle for the future of the Labour Party\u201d underway and urged delegates to \u201cresist the destructive, corrosive impulse of factionalism\u201d.\n\nJon Lansman\n\nThe veteran left-winger who helped run Tony Benn\u2019s unsuccessful deputy leadership bid in the 1980s is a close ally of the Labour leadership and helped found the pro-Jeremy Corbyn organisation Momentum. He brought the motion on Friday to Labour\u2019s NEC to remove the deputy leadership post and faced heavy criticism from MPs.\n\nJeremy Corbyn\n\nThe Labour leader was not present during the NEC vote and has since attempted to distance himself from the move to abolish the deputy leadership position.\n\nAsked about the move on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show, Corbyn chose his words carefully. \u201cI knew there were discussions going on about the role of deputy leader,\u201d he said. \u201cI did not know that that particular motion was going to be put at that time.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThere was a move that didn\u2019t happen, that didn\u2019t work and I intervened to make sure we have an open, democratic discussion about the structure of our party and that is where we\u2019re at.\u201d\n\nKarie Murphy\n\nThe former Scottish Labour activist is the gatekeeper of Corbyn\u2019s office at Westminster and his chief-of-staff. She was briefed to have worked with Lansman to bring the motion to a vote at the NEC on Friday.\n\nLen McCluskey\n\nFingers were also pointed at the Unite union boss Len McCluskey \u2013 a close ally of Corbyn \u2013 who has a fractious relationship with Watson. But McCluskey dismissed reports he was involved in the audacious bid to abolish the deputy leader position, describing it as \u201cfake news\u201d.\n\n\u201cI had nothing to do with it,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew nothing about it.
