Trump said he would make the announcement shortly.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Rick and I have been talking for six months. In fact, I thought he might go a bit sooner. But he's got some very big plans. He's going to be very successful,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump spoke fondly of Perry during the event, introducing the former Texas governor as a \"very good friend of mine,\" adding \"I'm going to miss you so much.\"\n\nWho's next?: \"We have his successor, we'll announce it pretty soon,\" Trump added.\n\n\"We'll be announcing the replacement, and he -- I think it's a he in this particular case -- I think he'll do a fantastic job,\" Trump continued. \"We worked on that together.

Multiple witnesses, including top State Department officials who ignored White House directives not to testify, have raised concerns about what they described as a shadow foreign policy conducted outside the normal diplomatic channels.\n\nPerry recently told Fox News he was not sure if he would comply with a congressional subpoena for records related to the Ukraine controversy. The deadline for submitting those documents is Friday.\n\nMore on Perry's exit here.\n\nIt's Thursday!

President Trump ultimately intervened and the Fish and Wildlife Service shifted import decisions to a \"case by case\" basis.\n\nThe Humane Society, the Center for Biological Diversity and the Natural Resources Defense Council were among the organizations that filed a lawsuit in August 2018, arguing the council was illegal because it was disproportionately filled with pro-hunting advisers. The groups said federal law requires all government advisory panels have a balanced mix of participants. The Trump administration moved to dismiss the suit, but a federal court overruled them in September.\n\nBernhardt told the committee Thursday that \"as we get to December\" he would be meeting with lawyers to decide the next best steps for the future of the advisory board, adding he hadn't \"yet decided what that pathway will be.\"\n\nThe council's charter is set to expire in December. A spokesperson for the Interior Department said Bernhardt will make his decision before then.\n\nRead more here.\n\nSHOOT YOUR SHOT: Senate Democrats forced a floor vote Thursday to block the implementation of a Trump administration environmental rule that aims to weaken regulations on power plant emissions.\n\nThe vote, which failed 41 to 53, was largely seen as a protest of the Trump administration's rollbacks on several environmental protections and climate change mitigation efforts, and offers a roadmap of actions Democrats might take if they win back the Senate in 2020.\n\n\"There may be no more worthy issues than protecting our environment,\" Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer Charles (Chuck) Ellis SchumerPelosi fires back after Trump 'meltdown': 'We have to pray for his health' 5 big wins in US-China trade pact Trump defends 'crime buster' Giuliani amid reported probe MORE (D-N.Y.) said on the Senate floor Thursday morning.\n\n\"Time is running out for the U.S. to meet the existential threat posed by climate change and that's why this rule is such a grave, grave mistake.\"\n\nDemocrats were able to bring the vote to the floor through the Congressional Review Act (CRA), a seldom-used legal maneuver that requires the signature of just 30 senators. The CRA allows Congress to review and overturn rules implemented by the executive branch within 60 days after they have been finalized. The so-called disapproval resolution needs only a majority vote to pass.\n\nThursday's vote was meant to express disapproval of the EPA's Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule and would have required at least four GOP defections to succeed.\n\nSen.

We have to get stakeholders at the table,\" he said Thursday.\n\n\"Folks in Alabama are concerned as well [about climate change], we just have to do it in the right way.\"\n\nRead more here.\n\nOUTSIDE THE BELTWAY:\n\nNestl\u00e9 to refresh bottled-water business as sales turn flat, The Wall Street Journal reports.\n\nBank regulators present a dire warning of financial risks from climate change, The New York Times reports.\n\nQatar is air-conditioning the outdoors because of climate change, GQ Magazine reports.\n\nICYMI: Stories from Thursday...\n\n-Trump confirms Perry to step down as Energy secretary\n\n-Future of controversial international hunting council up in the air\n\n-Democrats vow to push for repeal of other Trump rules after loss on power plant rollback\n\n-EPA official delayed recusal on key health study for ex-employer: report\n\n-White House: Climate change won't be on agenda when Trump hosts G-7\n\n-Senate Dems lose forced vote against EPA power plant rule\n\n-Climate change protesters snarl London transit services, clash with commuters", "description": "HE'S OUT OF THERE: Energy Secretary Rick Perry, whose dealings with Ukraine have become a focus of the House impeachment inquiry into President Trump, will step down from his Cabinet post at the end of the year, Trump said Thursda", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/perryrick_011917vsj10.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
