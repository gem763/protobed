The science-fiction inspired electric pickup truck had been expected to arrive this summer, or October at the latest, based on previous statements made by the notoriously optimistic Musk.\n\nBeyond an early concept image of a pickup shown at the unveiling of the Tesla Semi in 2017 and an image tweeted in May, little is known about the Tesla pickup truck. Musk described it as follows in a Recode interview with Kara Swisher last year:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gonna be like a really futuristic-like cyberpunk, \u201cBlade Runner\u201d pickup truck. It\u2019s gonna be awesome, it\u2019s gonna be amazing. This will be heart-stopping. It stops my heart. It\u2019s like, oh, it\u2019s great.\u201d\n\n\u201dIt\u2019s gonna have a lot of titanium,\u201d Musk added later.\n\nAbout a minute in, we flashed a teaser pic of Tesla cyberpunk truck pic.twitter.com/hLsGsdyuGA \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 16, 2019\n\nMusk already said that he doesn\u2019t care if anyone buys the Tesla passion project, conceding that he\u2019d build a more conventional pickup in the future if it doesn\u2019t sell.\n\nThe Tesla pickup will face stiff competition whenever it does launch. Ford\u2019s been teasing its all-electric F-150 for a while, choosing to focus on how similar it is to Ford\u2019s best selling pickups while preaching the \u201cFord tough\u201d mantra. The electric F-150 could hit dealerships as early as 2021. Buyers looking for something a bit more futuristic \u2014 but available in 2020 \u2014 might be tempted by the $69,000 R1T from US-based automotive startup Rivian. Ford is also partnering with VW on a medium-sized e-pickup that could arrive by 2022. In April, GM committed to building a full-sized electric pickup, with plans to launch it \u201cwhen competitively appropriate.\u201d\n\nWhile you wait, there\u2019s always the Simone Giertz Model 3 conversion if you\u2019re handy with a blowtorch and absolutely must have a Tesla pickup truck right now.", "description": "The science-fiction inspired electric pickup truck had been expected to arrive this summer, or October at the latest, based on previous statements made by the notoriously optimistic Musk.", "authors": ["Thomas Ricker", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SU-ysQBhkiliDQ27jJIGeUWvI6Y=/0x71:1130x663/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13375075/tesla-pickup-concept.0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
