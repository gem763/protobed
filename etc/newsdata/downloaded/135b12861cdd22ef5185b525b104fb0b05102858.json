Before Congress imposed the cap, taxpayers could write off an unlimited amount of those taxes on their federal returns.\n\nThe federal government had asked the Oetken to dismiss the suit, arguing that the court lacked jurisdiction and that the states had failed to make a valid legal claim.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS Morning Tax Sign up for our tax policy newsletter and stay informed \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

Andrew Cuomo, in a statement, said his state is \"evaluating all options including appeal.\"\n\n\"There is no doubt in my mind that President Trump's unfair tax policy targets New York and other blue states by funding tax cuts for corporations and the rich on the backs of New Yorkers,\" Cuomo said. \"New York is already the largest 'donor state' in the nation \u2014 paying the federal government $36 billion more than we get back every year. The SALT cap takes this gross imbalance and supercharges it, costing New Yorkers another $15 billion each year.\"\n\nOetken acknowledged the states\u2019 argument that their residents would face higher federal tax bills as a result of the cap, that property values could decline and that the states may have to take steps to lessen those problems.\n\nBut he said they \u201chave failed to show that the financial burden their taxpayers will experience as a result of the SALT cap is any more severe than the sort of burden that might accompany any other statewide economic disappointment.\u201d\n\nOetken also agreed that the cap will affect some taxpayers and some states more than others. But he said the cap doesn\u2019t prevent the states from making their own decisions about their taxes, so he had \u201cno basis for concluding that the SALT cap is unconstitutionally coercive.\u201d\n\nDemocrats in Congress have been working on legislation to undo the cap, at least temporarily. But it is unlikely to make it through the Republican-controlled Senate.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/fc/06/95a443fa4a66ba2f9fdb7d5e0f49/190930-treasury-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
