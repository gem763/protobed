He also helped mediate a maritime territory dispute between Kenya and Somalia and has been a key part of efforts to bring together the leaders of Sudan and South Sudan for talks.\n\nDomestically, the prime minister has introduced a series of sweeping political and economic adjustments, including granting amnesty to thousands of political prisoners, discontinuing media censorship and dismissing several high-profile figures suspected to be guilty of corruption.\n\nAl Jazeera's Robyn Kriel reports from Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa.", "description": "Abiy Ahmed gets the award amid cautions over 'far from done' reforms and unfinished diplomatic efforts.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://aljazeera.com/mritems/images/2019/10/12/665003303001_6094302512001_6094300757001-th.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
