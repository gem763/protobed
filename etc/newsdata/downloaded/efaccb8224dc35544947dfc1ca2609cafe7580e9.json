The family sought $250 million in damages.\n\nAD\n\nSandmann was on a school trip with classmates from Covington Catholic High School in Kentucky when the students encountered Phillips on the memorial\u2019s steps. Sandmann and some of his classmates were wearing red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats as they chanted school cheers and Phillips, beating a small drum, approached them.\n\nAD\n\nVideos and news accounts, including in The Post, sparked a heated national debate over what happened next. Phillips claimed Sandmann, who stood in Phillips\u2019 path, had blocked Phillips\u2019 progress. Sandmann later denied doing so, saying he had acted respectfully and had no intention of impeding Phillips.\n\nBertelsman had thrown out the Sandmanns\u2019 claims three months ago, ruling that none of the 33 statements they\u2019d sued over were defamatory and that the majority constituted protected opinion.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe court accepts Sandmann\u2019s statement that, when he was standing motionless in the confrontation with Phillips, his intent was to calm the situation and not impede or block anyone,\u201d the judge wrote in July.\n\n\u201cHowever, Phillips did not see it that way. He concluded that he was being \u2018blocked\u2019 and not allowed to \u2018retreat.\u2019 He passed these conclusions on to The Post. They may have been erroneous, but . . . they are opinion protected by the First Amendment. And The Post is not liable for publishing these opinions.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut the judge reconsidered on Monday, saying he would permit discovery to proceed on three statements contained in Post articles, specifically that Sandmann had \u201cblocked\u201d Phillips as he ascended the memorial\u2019s stairs and \u201cwould not allow him to retreat.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBertelsman didn\u2019t explain why he reconsidered and found these statements to be potentially defamatory now.\n\n\u201cSuffice to say that the Court has given this matter careful review and concludes that \u2018justice requires\u2019 that discovery be had regarding these statements and their context,\u201d he wrote in his five-page order.\n\nThe Sandmanns\u2019 original legal complaint cast The Post\u2019s coverage of the incident in political terms. It claimed that The Post \u201cignored basic journalist standards because it wanted to advance its well-known and easily documented, biased agenda against President Donald J. Trump by impugning individuals perceived to be supporters of the President.\u201d The Post denied any such motivation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump himself cheered the suit in February, tweeting, \u201cGo get them Nick. Fake News!\u201d\n\nThe Sandmanns have also sued CNN and NBC over their coverage of the story; both news organizations have filed motions to dismiss, which are pending.\n\nL. Lin Wood, the Sandmann family\u2019s lead attorney, said in an interview he was \u201cextremely pleased\u201d by the judge\u2019s reversal of his earlier order. \u201cWe look forward to engaging in full discovery to develop the factual record in this case, which we believe will ultimately lead to The Post being held accountable for its accusatory coverage of Nicholas Sandmann,\u201d he said.\n\nThe ruling, he said, bodes well for similar defamation lawsuits the Sandmanns have filed against CNN and NBC for their coverage of the Lincoln Memorial incident.\n\nA Post representative declined to comment.\n\nAD", "description": "After rejecting suit in July, jurist reconsiders but narrows scope of potentially defamatory material", "authors": ["Paul Farhi", "Media Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Xh9QTakXts-qQ-55DHWAJimDAu0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FKUYDKVP4II6TFARUYEPTUGC2M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
