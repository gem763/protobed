The Outlook is Stable. Key Rating Drivers IDRS, SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR LBP's IDRs are equalised with those of the sovereign, reflecting our expectations of a high probability of extraordinary state support for the bank in times of need. This drives the bank's Support Rating of '2' and Support Rating Floor of 'BBB'. The ratings take into account the bank's policy role, 100% state ownership and high systemic importance, which is indicated by its market share of about 11%-13% of system assets and deposits and status as the largest recipient of government deposits. The ratings also consider the state's ability to provide support, reflected in the 'BBB' sovereign rating. The bank is mandated to promote rural development in the Philippines, and also plays a role in various government financial programmes as needed. The board is appointed by the Philippine president annually, with four cabinet secretaries as ex officio members including the Philippine secretary of finance as chairperson. VIABILITY RATING LBP's Viability Rating considers the impact of state ownership and control on the bank's risk appetite, as well as the risks associated with its high concentration of large borrowers and niche policy-oriented portfolio, which may render it more vulnerable to impairment shocks. This is balanced against its satisfactory standalone credit profile, reflecting its generally stable funding and liquidity profile, moderate operating performance and adequate capital buffers. These stem from the state's requirement that LBP remains financially viable even as it fulfills its policy mandate. Around 92% of gross loans were extended to policy priority sectors as of end-2018. Loans are, for the most part, extended on a commercial basis, which has allowed the bank to maintain satisfactory profitability over the years despite its heavy policy focus. Average operating profit/risk-weighted assets of around 2.4% over 2015-2018 compares well against privately owned peers, notwithstanding the bank's more limited revenue diversification and more concentrated loan portfolio, which could lead to greater earnings volatility. LBP's Fitch Core Capital ratio of 14.6% and regulatory common equity Tier 1 ratio of 11.9% at end-2018 formed an adequate buffer for the bank to expand and guard against impairment shocks. LBP has been granted dividend exemptions, ordinary capital infusions and regulatory relief by the state in recent years, which have helped it retain capital for further growth. LBP's funding and liquidity profile is generally healthy. Deposits accounted for the bulk (about 98%) of funding, and a majority were government deposits thanks to its state ownership. The balance sheet is liquid, reflected in the low loan/deposit ratio of 47% at end-2018 and liquidity coverage ratio of 210% at end-June 2019. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS, SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR The ratings would be sensitive to any perceived shift in the sovereign's ability or propensity to support the bank. This may occur with sovereign rating action. Negative action could also arise if the state were to significantly reduce its ownership in LBP, or if the bank's policy role were to be curtailed - which we do not expect in the near-to-medium term. VIABILITY RATING There is little scope for a Viability Rating upgrade unless LBP's policy role and government involvement were to shrink significantly. Significant asset quality deterioration or unrestrained credit growth that materially weakens its buffers would be negative for its standalone credit profile, though this risk is mitigated by the bank's acceptable risk standards and the requirement for LBP to remain self-sustaining financially. ESG Considerations Unless otherwise disclosed in this section, the highest level of ESG credit relevance is a score of 3 - ESG issues are credit neutral or have only a minimal credit impact on the entity, either due to their nature or the way in which they are being managed by the entity. LBP has an ESG Relevance Score of 4 for Governance Structure. This reflects our view of a moderate risk of government influence that negatively affects its standalone credit profile, in light of its full state ownership and state-appointed board.

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.

A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security.

Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent).
