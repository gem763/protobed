(bloom.bg/2GegZKQ)\n\nYoudao\u2019s net revenue rose 67.7% to RMB548.5 million ($79.9 million) for the six months ended June 30, but its losses doubled to RMB167.9 million during the same period.\n\nFounded in 2006, Youdao provides online dictionaries, online classrooms and language courses, with 100 million monthly average users in China in the first half of 2019.\n\nEarlier in the day, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro rebuffed reports that the Trump administration was considering delisting Chinese firms from U.S. stock exchanges, boosting shares of U.S.-listed Chinese firms.\n\nNetEase shares were up nearly 2% at $265.54 in afternoon trading.", "description": "Youdao Inc, an e-learning unit of Chinese internet technology company NetEase Inc , filed for an initial public offering with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
