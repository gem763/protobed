NBC News was unable to independently verify the claim.\n\nMany of the group's fighters captured in northern Syria are in prisons guarded by Kurdish-led forces, while their families are in SDF-guarded camps.\n\nThe SDF have been a crucial U.S. ally in the fight against the Islamic State group, but now feel abandoned by America and have turned to Syrian President Bashar Assad and Russia's President Vladimir Putin to help deter a Turkish invasion.\n\nGen. Mazloum Kobani, commander of the SDF, said last week that the approximately 12,000 suspected terrorists in detention centers are now a \"second priority\" for his forces. Of the 12,000, some 2,000 are foreign fighters while the others are Iraqis and Syrians, Pentagon officials say.\n\nCurrent and former intelligence officials have told NBC Newsthat a sustained Turkish military operation against Kurdish forces in Syria would vastly increase the threat to Americans from the Islamic State militant group, which remains intent on attacking the West.\n\nSyrian refugees fleeing the Turkish incursion in Northern Syria wait to receive aid from the UNHCR and other International NGOs as more than 200 people arrive at the facility on Thursday in Dohuk, Iraq. Byron Smith\n\nIn one ISIS jail, which houses some 5,000 inmates, the warden told NBC News that if the conflict deteriorates the SDF guards would have no choice but to leave and head for the front lines.\n\n\"If there was an attack on the prison, we'd lock all the doors and go to the areas that they are in to fight and protect northern Syria,\" said Sarhat Amudi, referring to Turkish forces.\n\nErin McLaughlin and Mac William Bishop reported from Ceylanpinar, Turkey; Saphora Smith reported from London and Marc Smith reported from northern Syria.", "description": "It is unclear in the chaotic, fast-moving conflict how many other ISIS fighters or members of their families may have escaped.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/4240610/1000x563_nbc-191017-sdf-mc-1457_6075db0049cd333fc1590cd8a1bb8c50.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
