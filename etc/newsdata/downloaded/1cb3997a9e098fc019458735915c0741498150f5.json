Yesterday the Times published a story about the book including some new tidbits about attorney Lisa Bloom who represented Harvey Weinstein for a time. Apparently, Bloom was making good money trashing Weinstein\u2019s accusers:\n\nAllred\u2019s daughter, the lawyer Lisa Bloom, a prominent victims\u2019 rights attorney, was working behind the scenes with Mr. Weinstein \u2014 at a rate of $895 an hour \u2014 to quash the journalists\u2019 investigation and thwart his accusers. In a confidential memo to Mr. Weinstein that Ms. Bloom wrote in December 2016, which is reproduced in \u201cShe Said,\u201d she offered to help him damage the reputation of one of his accusers, Rose McGowan, and portrayed her background as a victims\u2019s rights advocate as an asset. \u201cI feel equipped to help you against the Roses of the world, because I have represented so many of them,\u201d Ms. Bloom wrote, before laying out a multistep playbook for how to intimidate accusers or paint them as liars. One of Ms. Bloom\u2019s suggested tactics for undermining Ms. McGowan: \u201cWe can place an article re her becoming increasingly unglued, so that when someone Googles her this is what pops up and she\u2019s discredited.\u201d Ms. Bloom accompanied Mr. Weinstein on a surprise visit to the Times the day before the initial article was published, to present the journalists with information intended to portray several accusers \u2014 including Ashley Judd, the first actress to go on the record \u2014 as unreliable and mentally unstable.\n\nLisa Bloom resigned from her position as Weinstein\u2019s adviser in October 2017. But the NY Times reported that just before she left her position she was urging Harvey to release photos of various accusers looking \u201cchummy\u201d with him as a way to discredit their stories:\n\nAs the board convened an emergency phone meeting on Thursday evening to address the allegations, published in an investigation by The Times, Ms. Bloom sent an email to board members attacking the article. She outlined a plan that involved \u201cmore and different reporting,\u201d including \u201cphotos of several of the accusers in very friendly poses with Harvey after his alleged misconduct.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering why Lisa Bloom, daughter of Gloria Allred and champion of victim\u2019s rights, was so eager to badmouth Weinstein\u2019s accusers, recall the two had a business relationship. Weinstein\u2019s company had optioned Bloom\u2019s book about Trayvon Martin. The deal resulted in the limited series titled \u201cRest in Power: The Trayvon Martin Story\u201d which was released last year. Here\u2019s Bloom celebrating the deal in 2017:\n\nBIG ANNOUNCEMENT: My book SUSPICION NATION is being made into a miniseries, produced by Harvey Weinstein and Jay Z! https://t.co/Z4pu7y0TfX \u2014 Lisa Bloom (@LisaBloom) April 7, 2017\n\nJust speculating now, but I don\u2019t think Bloom was so eager to discredit Weinstein\u2019s accusers just for the $895 an hour she was earning. Sure, that\u2019s a lot of money, but there were probably other places she could have gone to make similar money. I suspect it was more about her pipeline to Hollywood. If she were to vigorously defend Weinstein, he could potentially offer her more opportunities in tinsel town. In other words, I think Bloom had the same motive as all the other people who covered for Harvey over the years: She hoped he\u2019d use his Hollywood clout on her behalf.", "description": "\"I feel equipped to help you against the Roses of the world...\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Lisa-Bloom.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
