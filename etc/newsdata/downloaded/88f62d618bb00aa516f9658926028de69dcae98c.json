The healthcare companies reported strong quarterly results and raised their full-year profit forecasts.\n\nThe earnings reports will indicate the fallout from a prolonged U.S.-China trade war on U.S. companies. The tit-for-tat tariff moves have already hit domestic manufacturing, dented business sentiment and rankled financial markets.\n\nS&P 500 companies were set to report their weakest quarterly performance in about three years for the September quarter, with industrial companies among those most at risk from the trade dispute.\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced a partial trade deal with China on Friday, but concerns linger as no agreement has been signed yet and most tariffs on Chinese imports remain in effect.\n\nThe S&P 500 and Jones indexes, which gained nearly 2% last month, are off about 0.4% in October. The benchmark index is now more than 2% away from its record high after coming within striking distance in September.\n\nAt 7:00 a.m. ET, were up 102 points, or 0.38%. S&P 500 e-minis were up 10 points, or 0.34% and were up 24.25 points, or 0.31%.\n\nOther companies reporting results this week include Netflix Inc (O: ), Abbott Laboratories (N: ) and Union Pacific (N: ).\n\nShares of BlackRock Inc (N: ), the world's biggest asset manager, rose slightly after its quarterly profit beat analysts' estimates.\n\nHome-furnishing retailer Bed Bath & Beyond Inc (O: ) was up 4% after Keybanc upgraded the stock to \"overweight\".\n\nShares of mobile game developer Glu Mobile (O: ) jumped 9% as it is set to replace SolarEdge Technologies (O: ) in the S&P SmallCap 600.\n\nOn a sour note, U.S. advertising company Omnicom Group Inc (N: ) dropped 0.9% after falling short of estimates for quarterly revenue.", "description": "Futures rise as third-quarter earnings start on strong note", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9E0YR_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
