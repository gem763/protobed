Like\u2026 you\u2019re mine. You\u2019re my lunch.\n\n\u2018I hit him three times in the nose, he let me go. Come back again, try and attack me. When he snapped at me, I grabbed him, held him at the jaw with two hands and I was getting weak so I thought the only way to get his attention, I had to hit him again.\u2019 Elston Lami Lami being treated by medics (Picture: CareFlight) An Australian saltwater (Picture: AAP) Thankfully, his cousin was there to yell and distract the crocodile, as well as two dogs who barked at the reptile. He escaped with just two bites \u2013 but he still had to walk half an hour on his wounded leg back to his car. \u2018Whatever pain I was going through, I didn\u2019t want to show it to them boys, because I was the older one there,\u2019 told the station. At the car, he took a few paracetamol tablets and bandaged himself up before heading to Minjilang Community Health Centre. He was then airlifted to Royal Darwin Hospital by Careflight, and will need to stay in hospital for several days before he can go home. Got a story for Metro.co.uk?
