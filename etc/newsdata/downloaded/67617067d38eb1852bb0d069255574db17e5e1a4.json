I go in there every day to do shopping for my mum because she can\u2019t get about very well.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like the way I\u2019ve been treated - I feel like I am being bullied.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Ms Bryan entered the shop to buy cigarette papers for her sister.\n\nShe asked for a packet of Zig-Zag papers and was surprised when the employee asked her for proof of ID, HullLive reports.\n\n\u201cI said 'aw shut up d**khead', as a joke. I thought he was laughing with me and then he said, \u2018no I\u2019m being serious\u2019,\" Ms Bryan claims.\n\n(Image: Peter Harbour)\n\n\u201cI said \u2018how dare you ID me?\u2019.\n\n\u201cI had a panic attack, I felt like everyone was staring at me.\u201d\n\nFollowing a confrontation, a security guard took the woman out of the shop and calmed her down.\n\nWhen she went into the shop again the next day, members of staff informed her she had been banned from the store for three years.\n\nShe arranged to meet the manager at 5pm the following Friday.\n\n(Image: Peter Harbour)\n\nShe said: \u201cHe was rude and didn\u2019t listen to what I had to say and said the reason I was banned was because I had been racist.\"\n\nMs Bryan denies the accusation, adding: \u201cI\u2019m not a racist, I had an ex-boyfriend who was black.\u201d\n\nShe said she went into the shop with her friend Roxanne Marshall on Thursday after an employee on the door told her she was allowed to.\n\nHowever, she claims she was confronted again by other members of staff.\n\n(Image: GOOGLE)\n\nMs Marshall said: \u201cShe was told she could come in. She only had a stew pack and some sausages.\n\n\u201cAs I was walking up I could see two staff verbally abusing her. They were right in her face. I said there is no need for that it\u2019s bullying. They told her you\u2019re never coming in here again.\u201d\n\nAn Asda spokesman said: \u201cWhile we would never discuss individual circumstances, we take any concerns of this nature seriously and will not tolerate any form of abuse or discrimination towards our customers or colleagues.\u201d", "description": "Rakel Bryan entered the store in Beverley Road, Hull, to buy cigarette papers for her sister but got in a row after being asked for ID", "authors": ["Barnabas Stephenson", "Chiara Fiorillo", "Image", "Peter Harbour", "Google"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20652310.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PHP_HMB_181019_asda_011.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
