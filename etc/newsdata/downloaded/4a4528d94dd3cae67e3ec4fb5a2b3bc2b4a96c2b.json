The Astros lead the best-of-seven set 3-2 and will also lean on their bullpen, saving Cole to pitch a potential Game 7 on full rest.\n\nHanging in the balance: a World Series date with the NL champion Washington Nationals.\n\n\u201cWe obviously feel good about the bullpen days,\u201d Britton said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of success doing it.\u201d\n\nYankees opener extraordinaire Chad Green is likely to get the ball first, although manager Aaron Boone said he hadn\u2019t decided for sure. The rest of New York\u2019s core relief quintet - Chapman, Britton, Adam Ottavino and Tommy Kahnle - will surely follow. Boone said Luis Severino would start a potential Game 7.\n\nBoone has been occasionally symphonic orchestrating matchups for those pitchers, as in Game 2 of this series. After starter James Paxton stumbled through 2 1/3 innings, the bullpen held Houston to two hits and one run over the next seven innings. Starter-turned-reliever J.A. Happ finally cracked in the 11th inning, allowing a game-ending homer to Carlos Correa.\n\nNew York\u2019s relievers own a 2.27 ERA this postseason, helped by three scoreless innings to close out Game 5. Britton retired five straight on 18 pitches, and Chapman threw nine pitches in a perfect ninth.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll just do our best to piece it together,\u201d Boone said.\n\nBoone has managed workloads for all those relievers carefully this season. None has pitched three consecutive days in 2019. That figures to change this weekend if New York manages to advance. When Paxton covered six innings Friday, it meant Boone never had to warm up Green or Ottavino.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just ready for whatever,\u201d Chapman said.\n\n\u201cAt this stage, I\u2019m going to do whatever it takes to win,\u201d Britton echoed.\n\nThe Astros will take a different tact in their first game this series without Cole, Justin Verlander or Zack Greinke on the mound.\n\nSteady-handed rookie Jos\u00e9 Urquidy will likely backbone Houston\u2019s pitching plans. Hardly a prized jewel in Houston\u2019s farm system entering the year, the 24-year-old from Mexico hadn\u2019t pitched above Class A before this season, yet he shot through Double-A and Triple-A to crack the postseason roster. He could cover multiple innings in relief, or be utilized as a short-term starter.\n\nBehind him, Roberto Osuna, Will Harris and Ryan Pressly form an imposing trio of their own.\n\nPerhaps the biggest challenge for both teams: neither Boone nor Astros manager AJ Hinch has said which pitcher will go first.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d like to know the night before,\u201d Yankees slugger Aaron Judge said. \u201cBut if we find out in the morning, we\u2019ll do our homework and get ready.\u201d\n\nThe Yankees relief unit has been far from perfect this October. For the first time this postseason, Green and Kahnle each proved hittable this week - Green allowed a three-run shot to Correa in Game 4, and Kahnle ended a run of 15 consecutive batters retired by allowing a hit and a walk while getting one out in Game 5.\n\nOttavino is the biggest wild card. After posting a 1.90 ERA in the regular season, the right-hander has failed to retire a batter in four of his seven appearances in these playoffs. He opened the month as Boone\u2019s primary weapon against other team\u2019s best right-handed hitters. In a must-win Game 5, he never even got loose.\n\n\u201cWe all have confidence in him,\u201d Kahnle said. \u201cI know he has confidence in himself. I\u2019ve played with him for a long time. I\u2019ve been around him. He\u2019ll bounce back.\u201d\n\nUrquidy showed off sharp command and a fading changeup while going 2-1 with a 3.95 ERA in nine games - seven starts - during the regular season. In his only postseason appearance, the right-hander pitched 1 2/3 scoreless innings in Game 4 of the AL Division Series against Tampa Bay, working around three hits, a walk and a hit batter.\n\nJosh James and Brad Peacock could also cover multiple innings.\n\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s ready,\u201d Astros star slugger Alex Bregman said.\n\nHouston doesn\u2019t have the same depth as New York, but Osuna, Pressly and Harris are formidable options. Osuna and Harris have been nearly perfect this postseason, and Pressly seems to have shaken off rust following a late-season knee injury. He struck out two to strand the bases loaded during Game 4.\n\nHinch\u2019s plan for them?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it on the plane ride home,\u201d he said.\n\nHe\u2019s more certain about his lineup. In particular, slumping slugger Yordan \u00c1lvarez won\u2019t be benched, even thoug the rookie is 1 for 19 in the series with 10 strikeouts.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be there,\u201d Hinch said. \u201cHe\u2019ll DH and bat seventh.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Jake Seiner: https://twitter.com/Jake_Seiner\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Gerrit Cole may get a chance to punch the Houston Astros' ticket to the World Series.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jake Seiner"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/08/alds_yankees_twins_baseball_92044_c0-173-4146-2591_s1200x700.jpg?8ee15b72f51779b7647fd3c5a8cc06bc3817b587", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
