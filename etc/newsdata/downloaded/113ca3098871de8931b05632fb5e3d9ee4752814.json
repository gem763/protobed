Both went after her wealth tax plan, and tried to appeal to more moderate voters.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWashington politicians \u2026 [offer] the most elegant policy prescriptions, and nothing changes,\u201d Buttigieg said, a comment directed at Warren.\n\nKlobuchar chimed in with a more pointed attack, suggesting that Warren\u2019s characterization of her competitors\u2019 plans was unfair.\n\n\u201cI want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth, because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires. We just have different approaches, your idea is not the only idea,\u201d Klobuchar said.\n\nO\u2019Rourke joined in too, calling the Massachusetts Democrat\u2019s wealth tax plan \u201cpunitive.\u201d\n\nWarren quickly fired back. \u201cI\u2019m really shocked at the notion that anyone thinks I\u2019m punitive,\u201d she said.\n\nAD\n\nAfter the moderators tossed a question to Booker, the New Jersey Democrat took a moment to call on his competitors to tone down the intra-party attacks.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou know, we\u2019ve got one shot to make Donald Trump a one-term president, and how we talk about each other in this debate really matters,\u201d Booker said, drawing applause from the crowd.\n\nBillionaires\u2019 place in America is discussed\n\nAt one point, Sanders was asked whether his goal was to \u201ctax billionaires out of existence.\u201d The Vermont senator launched into a lengthy speech about income inequality in the United States, lamenting the staggering number of homeless, uninsured, underinsured and debt-burdened Americans.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThen you also have three people owning more wealth than the bottom half of American society. That is a moral and economic outrage,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cAnd the truth is, we cannot afford to continue this level of income and wealth inequality, and we cannot afford a billionaire class.\u201d\n\nSteyer, the only billionaire on the debate stage, agreed that Sanders was right to go after the wealthy.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere have been 40 years where corporations have bought this government, and those 40 years have meant a 40-year attack on the rights of working people and specifically on organized labor. And the results are as shameful,\u201d Steyer said. \u201cAs Senator Sanders says, both in terms of assets and in terms of income, it\u2019s absolutely wrong, it's absolutely undemocratic and unfair.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSteyer then advocated for a wealth tax, ending Trump\u2019s tax cuts and increasing the minimum wage.\n\nWarren takes on Yang on universal basic income\n\nWarren found herself on defense for much of the first half-hour of the debate. But as the end of the first hour neared, she played offense against Yang, taking on the entrepreneur over his signature issue, universal basic income, which would guarantee every American $1,000 a month, no matter their employment status.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI think the thing closest to universal basic income is Social Security,\u201d Warren said, arguing that her proposal for strengthening Social Security would do more to protect vulnerable Americans than Yang\u2019s plan.\n\nAD\n\nShe added that she wants to \u201csee the data.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have the data,\u201d Yang quickly shot back.\n\nHarris brings up abortion\n\nDuring the back and forth on Medicare-for-all, Harris noted that women\u2019s reproductive rights did not come up in any of the previous debates, even though, she said, Republican state legislatures are trying to dismantle those rights.\n\n\u201cThis is the sixth debate we have had in this presidential cycle and not nearly one word, with all of these discussions about healthcare, on women's access to reproductive healthcare, which is under full on attack in America today,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s outrageous.\u201d\n\nHarris continued, \u201cPeople need to keep their hands off of women\u2019s bodies and let women make the decisions about their own lives.\u201d\n\nMedicare-for-all: Who would pay?\n\nIn the first policy debate of the evening, Warren and Buttigieg sparred over whether middle-class taxes would go up under Medicare-for-all.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI have made clear what my principles are here: Costs will go up for the wealthy and for corporations and for hard-working middle-class families, costs will go down,\u201d Warren said.\n\nButtigieg, who has previously accused Warren of being \u201cevasive\u201d on that question, said she was doing so again on the debate stage.\n\n\u201cA yes or no question that didn\u2019t get a yes or no answer,\u201d Buttigieg charged, before touting his own plan, \u201cMedicare for All Who Want It,\u201d which institutes a public option but allows private insurance companies to remain.\n\nSanders cut in, noting that he was the person \u201cwho wrote the damn bill.\u201d\n\nIf the proposal is passed, taxes are going to go up significantly \u2013 for the wealthiest Americans, Sanders said.\n\nAD\n\nWarren faced more flak from another opponent onstage: Klobuchar, who argued Warren was \u201cmaking Republican talking points right now in this room.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nKlobuchar also prompted applause from the crowd \u2013 a rarity so far this evening \u2013 when she raised the issue of the opioid epidemic.\n\nSanders and Biden, who have long disagreed over health-care policy, engaged in one of their sharpest exchanges on the topic in any debate.\n\nBiden suggested Warren and Sanders needed to be clearer about the high costs of their plan, and he sought to steal some of Buttigieg\u2019s thunder by saying that the mayor\u2019s approach is effectively one he has spearheaded \u2014 expanding Obamacare.\n\nAD\n\nSanders snapped back, arguing that those who are defending the current system are advocating for a problematic approach in which many Americans are suffering. He said he gets \"a little tired, I must say, of people defending a system which is dysfunctional, which is cruel.\u201d\n\nBiden addresses questions on Ukraine\n\nBiden said he did nothing wrong when he worked on Ukrainian policy as vice president while his son was serving on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMy son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government rooting out corruption in in Ukraine. And that's what we should be focusing on,\u201d Biden said.\n\nBiden then pivoted to talking about Trump\u2019s corruption, saying a statement his son put out today \u201cspeaks for itself.\u201d\n\nPressed to answer whether it was a mistake for his son to take the position, Biden dodged the question.\n\n\u201cI never discussed a single thing with my son about anything having to do with Ukraine,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWe\u2019ve always kept everything separate even when my son was the attorney general of the state of Delaware, we never discussed it so there\u2019d be no potential conflict. My son made a judgment. I\u2019m proud of the judgment he made. I\u2019m proud of what he had to say.\u201d\n\nIt was unclear what judgment Biden was referring to, but he seemed to be talking about his son\u2019s public statement where he said it was a mistake for him to take the job.\n\nYang wants to talk about economic problems\n\nWhile many of the candidates spent their first few minutes talking about President Trump and the impeachment inquiry, entrepreneur Andrew Yang took a different approach, encouraging Democrats to focus on the economic problems that paved the way for Trump\u2019s win in 2016.\n\nAD\n\n\"When we talk about him, we are losing,\" Yang said of Trump. He noted that the debate was unfolding in Ohio, a state Trump won. \"Why did Donald Trump win your state by eight points?\" he asked, before pointing out the manufacturing job losses that have occurred in the state.\n\n\u201cThese are the problems that got Donald Trump elected,\u201d Yang said.\n\nSteyer makes debate-stage debut\n\nIn his first debate appearance, Steyer noted that he began his \u201cNeed to Impeach\u201d campaign two years ago, long before the other Democrats onstage embraced the idea.\n\nEven as he sought to distinguish himself from the others onstage, Steyer also praised them, saying that every Democratic candidate was \u201cmore decent and patriotic than the criminal in the White House.\u201d\n\nButtigieg, meanwhile, cast himself as a uniter who can bring the country together after Trump has left the White House. \u201cOne way or another, this presidency is going to come to an end,\u201d Buttigieg said, asking listeners what it\u2019s going to feel like the first day the sun comes up after Trump is no longer president. \u201cReally think about where we\u2019ll be \u2013 vulnerable, even more torn apart by politics than we are right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m running to be the president who can turn the page and unify a dangerously polarized country,\u201d he added.\n\nCandidates talk about impeachment support\n\nIn his first comments, Biden said Trump\u2019s decision to stonewall every congressional investigation led him to support the House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry. Biden drew a contrast between Trump and the impeachment of President Clinton. At that time, Biden said lawmakers needed to be mindful of the American people\u2019s vote.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s gone so far to say since this latest event \u2026 I will not cooperate,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThey have no choice but to move.\u201d\n\nBiden, who has found himself at the center of the impeachment inquiry, said nothing more about the specifics of the House investigation or his role in it.\n\nHarris echoed her competitors, expressing her support of the impeachment inquiry and adding that she didn\u2019t think the impeachment process would take very long.\n\n\u201cBecause as a former prosecutor, I know a confession when I see it,\u201d Harris said.\n\nStriking a more cautious tone, Booker said he understood \u201cthe outrage that we all feel,\u201d but said it was important to conduct the impeachment process in an \u201chonorable\u201d way that did not further divide the country.\n\nBoth Klobuchar and Castro brushed off concerns impeachment would be a \u201cdistraction,\u201d saying American lawmakers and voters were capable of doing two things at once.\n\n\u201cWhen [Trump] made that call to the head of Ukraine, he\u2019s digging up dirt on an opponent,\u201d Klobuchar said. \u201cThat\u2019s illegal conduct; that\u2019s what he was doing.\u201d\n\nSanders goes after Trump and Republicans\n\nSanders, who has been off the campaign trail for two weeks after suffering a heart attack, also went after President Trump and Senate Republicans. \u201cMitch McConnell has got to do the right thing and allow a free and fair trial in the Senate,\u201d said Sanders, speaking about the topic of impeachment.\n\nWhile his voice was a bit scratchy as he spoke, Sanders sounded much clearer than he did in the last debate, when he was noticeably hoarse. He is positioned toward the middle of the stage, to the left of Biden. Sanders stood patiently with his hands in front of him as Biden delivered his first remarks of the debate.\n\nDebate starts with discussion of impeachment\n\nThe moderators wasted no time tackling the issue of the impeachment inquiry into President Trump. Warren got the first question, on why she believes Congress should hold impeachment proceedings rather than leaving the issue of Trump\u2019s fitness for office up to the voters to decide next November.\n\nWarren\u2019s response: \u201cBecause sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics, and I think that\u2019s the case with this impeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\nSanders, too, defended his call for impeaching Trump, adding that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) \u201chas got to do the right thing and allow a free and fair trial in the Senate.\u201d\n\nBiden \u2013 who only recently came out in favor of impeachment \u2013 called Trump the most corrupt president in history. He highlighted the White House\u2019s efforts to stonewall the impeachment inquiry. \u201cThey have no choice but to move,\u201d he said of House Democrats.\n\nThe debate\n\nTo qualify, candidates had to hit 2 percent in at least four polls approved by the Democratic National Committee and receive contributions from at least 130,000 individual donors.
