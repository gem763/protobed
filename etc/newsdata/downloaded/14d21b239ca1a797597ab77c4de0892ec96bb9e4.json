Just last year, Russia and China joined in the Vostok military exercise with over 300,000 troops in Siberia training jointly near the Chinese border.\n\nThe exercises are the clearest evidence to date of how Russian-Chinese relations have grown increasingly close since the Sino-Soviet split in 1961, when Moscow and Beijing were competing for control of the communist world. Having significantly expanded their economic, military and diplomatic ties, both countries see value in an alliance against their common enemy \u2014 the United States.\n\nRussia and China are seeking to conflate an unreal and exaggerated Western military threat with what really threatens the regimes of President Vladimir Putin and Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping: the values and principles, including democracy, freedom and liberty, enshrined in the Constitution and Bill of Rights.\n\nAfter declaring a \u201cconstructive partnership\u201d in 1992, and a \u201cstrategic partnership\u201d in 1996, Russia and China signed a treaty of \u201cfriendship and cooperation\u201d in 2001. The two countries created the Shanghai Cooperation Organization that year specifically to counter the U.S. in Central Asia.\n\nChina is now suffering from its trade war with the Trump administration. American and European sanctions on Moscow for its seizure of Crimea have taken their toll on Russia\u2019s economy as well. China and Russia are naturally growing their bilateral economic relationship as a counterbalance.\n\nChina is a major purchaser of Russian military equipment, which has been critical to modernizing the PLA. China also relies on Russia\u2019s vast oil and natural gas reserves. Trade between the two countries is projected to rise to $200 billion by 2020.\n\nThe U.S. 2018 National Defense Strategy concluded that China and Russia, as \u201crevisionist powers,\u201d are seeking to shape a world \u201cconsistent with their authoritarian mode.\u201d The two countries, the document argues, represent the preeminent threat to U.S. national security today.\n\nBeijing\u2019s military aggression in the South China Sea infringes on the freedom of navigation in the region as well as the rights of Vietnam, Taiwan and the Philippines. The Xi government has also mounted extensive espionage operations, allegedly hacking the Office of Personnel Management to steal U.S. government employee data. According to FBI Director Christopher A. Wray, \u201cfrom a counter-intelligence perspective, China represents the broadest and most challenging threat we face as a country.\u201d\n\nCounterfeit Chinese products steal U.S. trade secrets and intellectual property, Chinese market-access laws force U.S. companies to share valuable technology, and Mr. Xi\u2019s \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d financing program serves as a cover for a debt trap strategy allowing China to increase its economic throw-weight, military power and political influence from Asia to Africa.\n\nU.S. relations with Russia are similarly at a nadir due to Mr. Putin\u2019s aggressive and dangerous foreign policy. In the past decade, Russia invaded Georgia; violated Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity; downed a civilian airliner; was a co-conspirator in Syria\u2019s and Iran\u2019s attacks on civilians in Syria; poisoned a former Russian military intelligence officer living in Britain with a nerve agent; and interfered in elections in the U.S. and Europe.\n\nBoth regimes are seeking to control their people\u2019s online access, China through its \u201cGreat Firewall\u201d and Russia not far behind in seeking to impose sovereignty in its cyberspace. We are witnessing the rise of the Sino-Russian authoritarian internet, the antithesis of an open and free cyberspace which serves as a force multiplier for commerce and freedom of expression.\n\nThere are still some bilateral friction points, including China\u2019s expansion in Central Asia and Russia\u2019s warm relations with Beijing\u2019s regional rivals, including India. But there is no opportunity for the U.S. to drive a wedge between them as President Nixon skillfully did in the early 1970s.\n\n\u2022 Daniel N.
