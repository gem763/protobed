If this is an attempt to do that then it will fail\", the report quoted another cabinet minister as saying.\n\nThe report comes as the European Union accused Britain of playing a \"stupid blame game\" over Brexit after a Downing Street source told Reuters a deal was essentially impossible because German Chancellor Angela Merkel had made unacceptable demands.\n\nWith just over three weeks before the United Kingdom is due to leave the European bloc, the future of Brexit remains deeply uncertain as both London and Brussels position themselves to avoid blame for a delay or a disorderly no-deal Brexit.
