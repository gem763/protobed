The banks are still struggling to meet the $2 trillion valuation the company is seeking, according to the person.\n\nThe sudden delay disrupts the carefully choreographed plan to launch the share sale on Oct. 20, followed a week later by intense promotion during the country\u2019s big investment forum -- dubbed Davos in the Desert -- and ending with an IPO in late November. Now, a listing is unlikely before December or perhaps January.\n\nLast year, Aramco delayed the IPO after more than two years of preparations as international investors balked at the $2 trillion valuation Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had put on the company.\n\nThis time Saudi Arabia opted for an easier route, deciding to start with a local listing only in Riyadh -- ditching plans for a sale in London or New York -- and enlisting local banks and wealthy families to support the IPO.\n\nThe Saudi government had seemed determined to press on with an accelerated schedule even in the face of potential headwinds that include weak oil prices, a slowing world economy and last month\u2019s attack on the company\u2019s biggest processing plant.\n\nWhile details of the proposed offer haven\u2019t been made public, people involved in the transaction said earlier this month that about 2% of Aramco might be sold, raising $40 billion and easily exceeding the $25 billion raised in 2014 by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (NYSE: ) Group Holding Ltd.\n\nEver since the Crown Prince first mooted the the IPO of the kingdom\u2019s most prized assets in early 2016, Aramco\u2019s valuation has been contentious. Many analysts have said that $2 trillion is too much compared with similar publicly traded companies.\n\nAramco may well be the world\u2019s most valuable company, but based on the dividend yield received by investors in Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: )., the largest U.S. oil company, its valuation would be closer to $1.5 trillion.\n\nThe Sept. 14 attack on its oil facilities disrupted output and sent shock waves through energy markets, triggering the biggest one-day jump in prices on record and stoking security concerns. Investors are already demanding a premium to hold the country\u2019s debt, downgraded this month by Fitch Ratings Ltd.\n\nWhile advisers had been working on an intention to announce float for Oct. 20, executives hadn\u2019t given a firm timeline in public. Aramco Chief Executive Officer Amin Nasser said last month that the IPO would happen \u201cvery soon.\u201d\n\nThe IPO promises to be a fees bonanza for the more than two dozen advisers working on the share sale, with Aramco set to pay them $350 million to $450 million, people familiar with the matter said Wednesday.\n\nThe delay to the IPO\u2019s launch was reported by the Financial Times earlier.\n\n(Adds possible new timeline in third paragraph.)", "description": "Saudi Aramco\u00a0to Delay Launch of Its Initial Public Offering", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic691232285e8ee0b112f2488e1612b88a.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
