Clinton was speaking at an event in Washington, DC. (Sept. 27) AP, AP\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Richard Nixon nearly got impeached. Bill Clinton did. And Donald Trump could be next.\n\nA common thread running through all three imperiled presidencies?\n\nHillary Clinton.\n\nIn the 243-year history of the republic, just four U.S. presidents have faced impeachment inquiries. In a bizarre plot twist that reads like bad fiction, Clinton \u2013 a former first lady, senator, secretary of State and almost-president \u2013 is connected to three of them.\n\n\u201cYou cannot make my life up. Really,\u201d Clinton joked recently with television host Stephen Colbert about her strange ties to the impeachment cases against the 37th, 42nd and 45th presidents.\n\nClinton was still known as Hillary Rodham when, fresh out of Yale Law School, she was hired by the House Judiciary Committee to work on the impeachment case against Nixon during the Watergate scandal. The memo they produced is an official government document and is still relevant today in large part because it helps define what is considered an impeachable offense.\n\nTwo decades later, Clinton was America\u2019s first lady, literally standing by her man, President Bill Clinton, in the White House Rose Garden, nodding her head in agreement as he decried \u201cthe poisonous venom of excessive partisanship\u201d following his impeachment in 1998.\n\nTwo decades after that, Hillary Clinton would run for president herself and win the popular vote but lose the Electoral College \u2013 and the presidency \u2013 to Trump, who is now facing an impeachment inquiry amid accusations that he pressured a foreign power to investigate a political adversary, former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nImpeaching Trump: Republicans condemn impeachment proceedings in resolution\n\nHillary Clinton listens during a lecture on foreign policy at Rackham Auditorium, Thursday, Oct. 10, 2019 in Ann Arbor, Mich. (Photo: Jacob Hamilton, AP)\n\nClinton\u2019s office declined to comment for this article.\n\nBut Frank Bowman, a law professor at the University of Missouri and the author of a book on presidential impeachment, described Clinton\u2019s connection to impeachment proceedings against three presidents as \u201can odd coincidence\u201d and \u201ca testament to Hillary Clinton\u2019s longevity as part of the national political life.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a part of (the impeachment story),\u201d Bowman said, \u201cbut that\u2019s because she has been a part of the national story for so long.\u201d\n\n'Impeachment ... is a very big thing'\n\nBefore Watergate in the early 1970s \u2013 a scandal that would eventually end Nixon's presidency \u2013 no American president had faced impeachment since Andrew Johnson a century earlier.\n\nAmid Watergate, with impeachment no longer a constitutional relic but a real possibility, the House Judiciary Committee tapped Clinton and a bipartisan team of young staffers to research the history of impeachment and explore possible grounds for impeaching Nixon.\n\n\u201cThe staff and members of the House understood that considering the impeachment of a president is a very big thing, and they wanted to make sure they understood the history and the law,\u201d said Michael Gerhardt, a University of North Carolina law professor and expert on impeachment.\n\nClinton and others on the bipartisan team produced a 64-page memo detailing the origins of impeachment dating to the British Parliament more than 400 years ago and the constitutional grounds that would be needed to impeach an American president.\n\nAmong their conclusions: Criminal conduct is not needed to satisfy the definition of \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d one of the thresholds the U.S. Constitution spells out for impeachment of a public officeholder.\n\nThe 1974 memo \u201cis a tremendous piece of work,\u201d Bowman said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much contribution Secretary Clinton had to that work, but given its length, I think it really covers the ground nicely. And I very much agree with almost all of its conclusions, particularly its conclusion about the kinds of things that are impeachable.\u201d\n\nThe memo, an official government document, served as something akin to a road map for lawmakers as they embarked on the impeachment of Nixon. Over the course of four days in late July 1974, the House Judiciary Committee debated five articles of impeachment against Nixon and eventually approved three, accusing him of obstruction of justice, abuse of power and contempt of Congress.\n\nA week later, Nixon resigned before the full House voted on the articles of impeachment.\n\nRichard Nixon says goodbye with a victorious salute to his staff members outside the White House as he boards a helicopter after resigning the presidency on Aug. 9, 1974. Nixon was the first president in American history to resign the nation's highest office. His resignation came after approval of an impeachment article against him by the House Judiciary Committee for withholding evidence from Congress. He stepped down as the 37th president with a 2,026-day term, urging Americans to rally behind Gerald R. Ford. President Ford fully pardoned Nixon one month later.

Bob Barr, a Georgia Republican who was one of the most vocal proponents of impeaching Bill Clinton, even used the memo to taunt the president\u2019s wife.\n\nIn a Wall Street Journal op-ed addressed to \u201cDear Mrs. Clinton,\u201d Barr wrote that when he first raised the notion of impeaching her husband, \u201clittle did I realize your scholarly work 23 years ago would provide clear historical and legal basis and precedent for my proposition.\u201d\n\n\u201cI presume \u2013 but I must ask whether \u2013 you stand by your research and analysis today,\u201d Barr wrote before concluding with a caustic zinger: \u201cThank you, Mrs. Clinton, for giving Congress a road map for beginning our inquiry.\u201d\n\nOn Dec. 19, 1998, Bill Clinton became the second American president to be impeached when the House, voting mostly along party lines, approved two articles of impeachment accusing him of perjury to a grand jury and obstruction of justice. The Senate acquitted him of both charges the following January.\n\nMea culpa: After slamming Trump for 'lynching' tweet, Biden apologizes for using the term\n\nFirst lady Hillary Clinton looks on as President Bill Clinton makes a statement at the White House on Dec. 19, 1998, following his impeachment by the House. (Photo: Susan Walsh, AP)\n\nHillary Clinton would go on to be elected U.S. senator from New York, serve as secretary of State under Barack Obama and lose her own bid for the presidency to Trump, who is now the subject of an impeachment inquiry led by House Democrats.\n\nAnd once again, Clinton figures into the impeachment discussions.\n\n'Break glass for emergency' moment\n\nDrawing on her own experience, Clinton has said in recent interviews that House Democrats had no choice but to open an impeachment inquiry against Trump following a whistleblower\u2019s claims that Trump pressured Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden and Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, who served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company.\n\nClinton \u201chas incredible insight to the impeachment process both personally and professionally,\u201d said author Amie Parnes, who has written a pair of books on Clinton\u2019s two unsuccessful campaigns for president.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s seen what goes into an (impeachment) inquiry and also on the flip side, in her husband\u2019s case, how it can weigh on the president facing impeachment and, even in her case, how it impacts the president\u2019s family,\u201d Parnes said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s why you\u2019ve seen her really wrestle with the implications of impeachment even against someone like her former opponent President Trump.\"\n\nClinton vs. Trump: Calling Trump a 'corrupt human tornado,' Hillary Clinton backs impeachment\n\nHillary Clinton and Donald Trump leave the stage after the first presidential debate at Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y., on Sept. 26, 2016. (Photo: Timothy A. Clary, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nA couple of months ago, Parnes said, Clinton talked about how impeachment shouldn\u2019t be used for \u201ctrivial political\u201d purposes.\n\n\u201cBut I think, as with many Democrats, her views solidified with the whistleblower on the Ukraine call,\u201d Parnes said. \u201cI think for her this was a 'break glass for emergency' moment, even if some say she\u2019s almost too close to it.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s impeachment memo has held up well over the years and could again serve as an important resource for lawmakers as they contemplate whether to file formal impeachment charges against Trump, Gerhardt said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they are going to have to go back and reinvent the wheel,\u201d he said. \u201cThis (memo) is sort of a good foundation, and my guess is the staffers have read it and it will be helpful to the current members.\u201d\n\nThe prospect that Clinton\u2019s memo could help bring down the man who dashed her own presidential ambitions is \u201cthe ultimate irony for Secretary Clinton,\u201d Parnes said, \u201cand in some ways, the ultimate vindication for her.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf she only knew then what she knows now.\"\n\nPerilous times for Trump:By 45%-38%, Americans support impeachment over Ukraine allegations, poll finds\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/26/impeachment-hillary-clinton-memo-nixon-trump/4082889002/", "description": "Hillary Clinton wrote the book, or at least a memo, on impeachment.
