(He\u2019s) kind of like a Dutch kickboxer style, but good everywhere. It\u2019s almost like I fought him before in Masvidal \u2013 very similar styles. Good everywhere, good wrestling, good jiu-jitsu, but with guys like that, you\u2019ve got to be ready everywhere. But I feel that he\u2019s going to want to keep this fight standing, so I don\u2019t mind that at all.\u201d\n\nDespite losing three of his past four, Thompson is not deterred. He failed to capture the welterweight title on two occasions against then-champion Tyron Woodley, first going to a majority draw, then losing a majority decision in the rematch. He rebounded with a win over Masvidal, but has dropped his past two with a narrow decision loss to Darren Till, then his first career knockout loss at the hands of Anthony Pettis.\n\nThey are all unfortunate circumstances for \u201cWonderboy,\u201d who still has his eyes set on the title. And taking on a hungry competitor like Luque is the exact kind of motivation he needs to get back to the top.\n\n\u201cFor me, I want to be the best fighter in the world,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cThat title is still right in the forefront of my brain. I know I can win, I know I can fight for the title again here soon, and with a good win over Vicente Luque, I could be there very soon.\u201d\n\nLuque has boasted an array of finishes on his resume, both by knockout and submission, and despite engaging in a few recent standup wars, Thompson thinks Luque will eventually try and drag things to the ground.\n\nAnd he\u2019ll be ready for it.\n\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s going to be a standup war,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cOf course, there\u2019s always some part of me thinking at some point in time, he\u2019s going to be wanting to shoot for my legs \u2013 at least try and get me up on the fence to try and tire my arms out like you\u2019ve seen other fighters do in the past. So I\u2019m ready for whatever. I think he\u2019s going to want to try and make a statement, try and knock me out, work his way up the ladder, keep the fighting standing \u2013 so I\u2019m excited for that.\u201d", "description": "Stephen Thompson says he sees similarities in the game of UFC 244 opponent Vicente Luque and former foe Jorge Masvidal.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "John Morgan", "Simon Head", "Nolan King", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Matt Erickson", "George Garcia", "Dan Tom", "Mike Bohn", "Abbey Subhan"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/stephen-thompson-jorge-masvidal-ufc-217-1.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
