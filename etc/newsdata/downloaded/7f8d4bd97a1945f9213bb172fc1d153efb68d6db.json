By one estimate, the hit to the automaker could reach $100 million per day.\n\nFifty-five factories and parts warehouses are at a standstill after the walkout by about 48,000 United Auto Workers members. It's the union's first strike against the No. 1 U.S. automaker in over a decade, with auto workers joining the walkout over issues including job security, pay and medical coverage.\n\nAt 11:59, UAW-GM workers began their strike. https://t.co/UljiErd7yN \u2014 UAW (@UAW) September 16, 2019\n\nThe strike's financial impact could be high, with Citigroup estimating GM could lose as much as $100 million in operating income for each day of the strike, according to The Wall Street Journal. Workers left factories and formed picket lines shortly after midnight Monday in the dispute over a new four-year contract. The union's top negotiator said in a letter to the company that the strike could have been averted had the company made its latest offer sooner.\n\nThe letter dated Sunday suggests that the company and union are not as far apart as the rhetoric leading up to the strike had indicated. Negotiations continued Monday in Detroit after breaking off during the weekend.\n\nBut union spokesman Brian Rothenberg said the two sides have come to terms on only 2% of the contract.\n\n\"We've got 98% to go,\" he said Monday.\n\nFederal mediation?\n\nAsked about the possibility of federal mediation, President Donald Trump, said it's possible if the company and union want it.\n\n\"Hopefully they'll be able to work out the GM strike quickly,\" Trump said before leaving the White House for New Mexico. \"Hopefully, they're going to work it out quickly and solidly.\"\n\nWall Street did not like seeing the union picketers. GM shares closed Monday down 4.2 percent to $37.21.\n\nPicket line worries\n\nOn the picket line Monday at GM's transmission plant in Toledo, Ohio, workers who said they have been with the company for more than 30 years were concerned for younger colleagues who are making less money under GM's two-tier wage scale and have fewer benefits.\n\nPaul Kane, from South Lyon, Michigan, a 42-year GM employee, said much of what the union is fighting for will not affect him.\n\n\"It's not right when you're working next to someone, doing the same job and they're making a lot more money,\" he said. \"They should be the making the same as me. They've got families to support.\"\n\nKane said GM workers gave up pay raises and made other concessions to keep GM afloat during its 2009 trip through bankruptcy protection.\n\n\"Now it's their turn to pay us back,\" he said. \"That was the promise they gave.\"\n\n\"Disappointed\"\n\nUAW Vice President Terry Dittes told GM that the company's latest offer might have made it possible to reach an agreement if it had come earlier.\n\n\"We are disappointed that the company waited until just two hours before the contract expired to make what we regard as its first serious offer,\" Dittes wrote in the letter to Scott Sandefur, GM's vice president of labor relations.\n\nThere are many important items left in the talks, including wage increases, pay for new hires, job security, profit sharing and treatment of temporary workers, Dittes wrote.\n\n\"We are willing to meet as frequently, and for as long as it takes, to reach an agreement that treats our members fairly,\" the letter said.\n\nGM: $7 billion offer\n\nGM issued a statement saying it wants to reach a deal that builds a strong future for workers and the business.\n\nThe automaker said Sunday that it offered pay raises and $7 billion worth of U.S. factory investments resulting in 5,400 new positions, a minority of which would be filled by existing employees. GM would not give a precise number. The company also said it offered higher profit sharing, \"nationally leading\" health benefits and an $8,000 payment to each worker upon ratification.\n\nThe offer we presented to the UAW prioritizes employees, communities and builds a stronger future for all. It includes improved wages and health care benefits, over $7B in U.S. investments and 5,400 jobs. Let's come together and secure our shared future: https://t.co/1QVtUokpis pic.twitter.com/Iss4S38Ozs \u2014 General Motors (@GM) September 15, 2019\n\nBefore the talks broke off, GM offered new products to replace work at two of four U.S. factories that it intends to close.\n\nThe company pledged to build a new all-electric pickup truck at a factory in Detroit, according to a person who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. The person was not authorized to disclose details of the negotiations.\n\nLordstown, Ohio\n\nThe automaker also offered to open an electric vehicle battery plant in Lordstown, Ohio, where it has a huge factory that has already stopped making cars and will be closed. The new factory would be in addition to a proposal to make electric vehicles for a company called Workhorse, the person said.\n\nIt's unclear how many workers the two plants would employ. The closures, especially of the Ohio plant, have become issues in the 2020 presidential campaign. President Donald Trump has consistently criticized the company and demanded that Lordstown be reopened.\n\nKristin Dziczek, vice president of labor and industry for the Center for Automotive Research, an industry think tank, said the letter and resumption of contract talks are encouraging signs. \"It makes me think that both sides are probably closer than it might have seemed before,\" she said.\n\nBut both Dziczek and Art Wheaton, an auto industry expert at the Worker Institute at Cornell University, say GM left out key details when it made part of its offer public, and working out those details could make the strike last longer.\n\n\"I think GM kind of sabotaged some of the negotiations by going immediately to the public,\" Wheaton said. \"It really distorts the offer.\"\n\nThe strike shut down 33 manufacturing plants in nine states across the U.S., as well as 22 parts-distribution warehouses. It's the first national strike by the union since a two-day walkout in 2007 that had little impact on the company.\n\nWorkers at Fiat Chrysler and Ford continued working under contract extensions. Any agreement reached with GM will serve as a template for talks with the other two companies.", "description": "More than 50 factories and warehouses are at a standstill after 48,000 United Auto Workers members went on strike", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/17/a92159c0-6f49-4585-9b23-e7046f675fe5/thumbnail/1200x630/04a80a3294406036e741b677d2bbe1ac/rtx737ey.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
