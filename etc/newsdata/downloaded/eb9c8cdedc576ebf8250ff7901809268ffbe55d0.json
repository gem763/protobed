It's the Lakers and it's the Clippers. And if there is a buyout at some point -- if Memphis can't trade him -- that's where that will come down to, those two teams.\"\n\nKeep in mind that Iguodala's former agent -- Rob Pelinka -- is the Lakers general manager.\n\nWe shall see.\n\nFollow @DrewShiller on Twitter and Instagram\n\nStory continues\n\nNBA players convinced Andre Iguodala going to Lakers, ESPN reporter says originally appeared on NBC Sports Bay Area", "description": "Keep in mind that the 2015 NBA Finals MVP's former agent -- Rob Pelinka -- is the Lakers' general manager ...", "authors": ["Drew Shiller"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/5_.L8uUkmxGq6phLpQD66w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/HMvCIireHobtwJh26lseDg--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/csnbayarea.com/a43e30e55c528fc09c4250287debd478", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
