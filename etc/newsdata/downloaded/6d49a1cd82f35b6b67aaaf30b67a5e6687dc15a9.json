By the time voting ended Friday afternoon, several union locals had ended up opposing the proposal, arguing that it didn\u2019t satisfy the aims of the strike, but support was broad enough across the country to push the deal through.\n\nThe contract covers nearly 50,000 workers, the bulk of them in the Midwest. The union did not release a final vote tally, but said members would start returning to work for their regularly scheduled shifts.\n\nTerry Dittes, the UAW vice president who led negotiations for the union, said members \u201chave spoken.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are all so incredibly proud of UAW-GM members who captured the hearts and minds of a nation,\u201d Dittes said.\n\nThe union announced that it would next bargain a new contract with Ford, followed by Fiat Chrysler, rounding out Detroit\u2019s Big Three.\n\nMary Barra, GM\u2019s chief executive, called it \u201ca contract that recognizes our employees for the important contributions they make to the overall success of the company.\u201d\n\nSOPA Images via Getty Images United Auto Workers members picket outside the Bedford Casting Operations plant in Bedford, Indiana, on Oct. 18, 2019.\n\nThe four-year deal with GM offers workers 3% raises in the first and third years of the contract; they would receive lump-sum payments worth 4% of workers\u2019 salaries in the other two years. The contract maintains the employee-friendly status quo on health insurance, and makes progress on giving temporary workers a pathway to permanent employment.\n\nThe deal also chips away at the contentious \u201ctwo-tier\u201d system in which newer hires work on a lower pay scale than legacy employees \u2015 a concession the union made in 2007 as GM neared bankruptcy. Now, those second-tier workers, known as \u201cin progression,\u201d can reach the top pay of roughly $32 per hour within four years, as opposed to eight years under the previous contract.\n\nBut the agreement still maintains schisms within the workforce. Workers employed at four parts plants under the GM subsidiary GMHC will continue to work on a lower pay tier and need eight years of service before reaching the top pay. Many newer workers at distribution warehouses would continue to earn less than assembly employees, maxing out around $25 per hour.\n\nMany workers in those facilities opposed the contract, saying it would cement their second-class status and sow division within the union\u2019s ranks. Automotive News reported that at two parts plants in New York, 81% of production workers and 62% of skilled trade workers gave the proposal a thumbs-down.\n\nBeth Baryo, a GM warehouse employee in Michigan, told HuffPost she was a \u201cvery strong no\u201d vote on the contract. Baryo will eventually reach the higher rate of $32 per hour, so the tier system doesn\u2019t hurt her as much. But she believes the different levels ultimately weaken the union and pit employees against one another. She also worries the new agreement still gives GM too much leeway to exploit temporary workers.\n\n\u201cThe minute I saw there were still tiers involved, regardless of whatever the benefits were, it was immediately a \u2018no\u2019 for me,\u201d Baryo said. \u201cI didn\u2019t need to know any more.\u201d\n\nLast year, GM announced plans to idle four plants, making job losses a major concern for UAW members. GM has made a promise to build electric trucks at one of those facilities, the Detroit-Hamtramck plant in Michigan, but the remaining three still have no plans for new production, including the Lordstown plant in Ohio.\n\nBill Pugliano via Getty Images Officials of UAW Local 160 check their phones to get updates on the UAW-GM contract ratification vote count on Oct. 25, 2019 in Warren, Michigan.\n\nNot surprisingly, the Lordstown local voted heavily against the contract, with many workers bitter at the plant being shut down. Fifty-three production workers there voted in favor, versus 399 against. But the contract fared much better in other locals with more job security, including Flint, Michigan, where pickups are built. There, 2,281 production workers voted in favor, versus 1,496 against, according to a running tally kept by Automotive News.\n\nThe strike ultimately lasted 40 days, making it the longest U.S. auto strike in a more than 20 years. GM employees went on strike in 2007 for just two days; a GM strike in 1998 lasted 54 days.\n\nAs HuffPost reported in July, there was a very strong chance UAW members would go on strike this year as they fought for stronger contracts. The union gave up significant concessions more than a decade ago when the auto industry foundered. Now that automakers have recovered \u2015 and GM in particular, which had roughly $11 billion in profits last year \u2015 workers are intent on making up ground.\n\nThe tentative agreement with GM came with an enticing carrot: a ratification bonus of up to $11,000, to be paid out once the contract is final. Many workers who just gave up more than a month\u2019s worth of wages would have had a hard time saying no to that lump sum.\n\nIn the case of legacy employees and skilled trade workers, who are eligible for the full $11,000, the ratification bonus more than makes up for the wages they lost due to the strike, according to an analysis from Michigan-based Anderson Economic Group. Temporary workers and in-progression workers get a bonus of $4,500, which covers most but not all of the wages they sacrificed.\n\nThe group estimates that, in total, GM lost more than $1.75 billion in profits due to stalled production, and that workers gave up roughly $1 billion in wages over the course of the work stoppage. The UAW paid out $250 in weekly strike pay \u2015 later raised to $275 \u2015 which amounts to a fraction of a GM worker\u2019s typical earnings.\n\nSeveral workers had told HuffPost in the middle of the strike that they were starting to feel the pinch. Joel Inocencio, who works at a parts distribution center in Pennsylvania, said earlier this month that he was going to speak with his mortgage lender about possibly getting a reprieve due to the strike.\n\n\u201cBut all of this \u2015 it pays off, just hanging in there,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a few weeks of sacrifice.\u201d", "description": "The work stoppage lasted 40 days and was the longest the auto industry had seen in two decades.", "authors": ["Labor Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db34f17210000df2c34b15d.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
