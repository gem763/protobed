Halligan now serves as executive director of the Idaho Trails Association, a nonprofit that helps with trail preservation and advocacy. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t see any indication that there\u2019s going to be an increase.\u201d\n\nAdjusting for inflation, Idaho\u2019s portion of that funding has fallen 14% over the past 15 years, officials said, and the agency\u2019s overall budget will again see cuts in 2020.\n\nAccording to Forest Service figures, Idaho had $5.6 million in 2011 to spend on trail maintenance in its seven national forests. In fiscal year 2019, it had $4.2 million - roughly $43,000 more than in 2018. (Andy Brunelle, a coordinator for the Forest Service, said though the maintenance budget is where the bulk of funding comes from, there are other sources of funds for maintaining trails.)\n\nThough Congress last year approved fire disaster funds that will take some of the strain of fighting wildfires off of the Forest Service, that doesn\u2019t go into effect until 2020. For now, the agency\u2019s wildlife fire management budget is about $2.4 billion, nearly half of the total Forest Service budget.\n\nIt\u2019s becoming more difficult to maintain the level of work from decades past. In 2011, a combination of contract workers, volunteers and Forest Service crews maintained more than 8,000 miles of the 23,000 miles of Forest Service trails in Idaho. In 2017, that number had only dropped to 7,900 miles of trail maintained, but the following year, 600 fewer miles were maintained. (Brunelle said trail maintenance data from the 1990s and early 2000s was not readily available for all the National Forests across Idaho.)\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to catch up and improve it like it was in the \u201890s,\u201d Halligan said. \u201cWe\u2019ll always be playing catch-up.\u201d\n\nThe squeeze on funds means fewer seasonal trail crews, like the ones McCarthy worked on for several years, and tougher decisions for forest managers about which projects to tackle.\n\n\u201cThe type of work we have to do doesn\u2019t change but the priority does,\u201d said Amy Baumer, spokeswoman for the Salmon-Challis National Forest.\n\nHeavily used trails take precedence, and more difficult tasks like rebuilding washed out routes or removing fallen trees is prioritized over removing overgrown brush.\n\nAccording to maintenance logs for the Middle Fork Ranger District of the Salmon-Challis, some trails haven\u2019t been maintained since the early 2000s. Baumer said this year crews repaired a landslide in the Loon Creek Corridor, making the trail passable for the first time in 15 years.\n\n\u201c(Crews) have to look at what the need is,\u201d Baumer said. \u201cThere are definitely trails that don\u2019t get maintained as often, (and when crews work on them) they\u2019ll have trouble finding the thread.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy, who earlier this year released a book on the early Idaho Forest Service leaders that helped shape the trail system, has a list of trails in the Frank Church - River of No Return Wilderness and Selway-Bitterroot that he\u2019s worried about: Crane Meadows, Sulfer Creek, Honeymoon Lake, Mountain Meadows. Some have hundreds of fallen logs blocking access, while others have \u201cghost ranger stations,\u201d shuttered relics where crews once stayed and worked.\n\n___\n\nIDAHO VOLUNTEERS CLEAR TRAILS\n\nOver the last decade, the mileage of maintained Forest Service trails has started to shift, and the source of that maintenance is shifting, too.\n\nIn 2011, volunteers accounted for about one-third of trail miles maintained, while contract employees contributed 14% and Forest Service crews handled half of the projects. Last year, volunteers maintained 49% of the miles maintained, contract workers tackled 6% and Forest Service crews maintained 44%.\n\n\u201cWe started hiring fewer crews and relying on volunteers more to help,\u201d Halligan said. \u201cEarly on, it was hit and miss with volunteers. We\u2019d go out to check on (their work) and it wasn\u2019t cleared to standard.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve increased volunteer hours every year,\u201d said Sally Ferguson, executive director of the Selway-Bitterroot Frank Church Foundation, which helps clear trails and offer wilderness training and internship opportunities. \u201cAs the Forest Service continues to lose funding and people retire out, they\u2019re not able to replace them. That\u2019s where the Selway-Bitterroot Foundation comes in.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the foundation, national forests partner with a wide variety of other groups. Baumer said the Salmon-Challis alone works with Americorps, the Idaho Conservation Corps, Idaho Trails Association, Back Country Horsemen of Idaho, 2L Trails and the local snowmobile association.\n\nBut volunteer help comes with its own set of problems. Sometimes, volunteers lack the experience or skills designated crews would have. Many volunteer projects through groups like the Idaho Trails Association are weekend trips, meaning workers don\u2019t have the time to get deep in the wilderness.\n\n___\n\nSELWAY-BITTERROOT FRANK CHURCH FOUNDATION\n\n\u201cThe decline in funding made this shift away from crews that were highly trained,\u201d Halligan said. \u201cIt slowly chiseled away at our abilities to clear trails.\u201d\n\nLast year, the Selway-Bitterroot Foundation contributed more than 14,000 volunteer hours toward trail maintenance.\n\n\u201cWe match dollar for dollar what the Forest Service gives us - in volunteer hours and in actual cash,\u201d Ferguson said.\n\nThree years ago, ITA completed 15 projects in a season. In 2018, the group completed 33 projects. By the end of 2019, Halligan guessed, the group will finish about 40.\n\n\u201cWhen we originally started doing these projects, the idea was we\u2019d come on a few projects and get them up to Forest Service standards,\u201d Halligan said. \u201cNow we\u2019re turning down way more projects than we should. If we could get the volunteers, we\u2019d be out on a project every weekend.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to do (the work) with volunteers, but volunteers can only do so much,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s a job someone should be paid for.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFUNDING FOR SOME IDAHO TRAILS ON THE RISE\n\nNot all of Idaho\u2019s trail maintenance funding is on the decline, though.\n\nTom Helmer, the nonmotorized trails coordinator with the Idaho Department of Parks and Recreation, said IDPR\u2019s budget for trail maintenance has actually grown slightly in recent years.\n\nHelmer said funding comes from the federal Recreational Trails Program, which takes a portion from fuel taxes through the Federal Highway Trust Fund. Part of the program\u2019s distribution model looks at estimated recreational fuel use in each state, meaning as Idaho\u2019s population has grown, so has its portion of Recreational Trails Program funding.\n\nWhen the program was first implemented in the early 1990s, Idaho received about $950,000 per year through the fund. Now, Helmer said, Idaho\u2019s share is nearly $1.7 million.\n\nThere is a catch: A certain portion of that funding has to go toward motorized trails, which already have a designated maintenance model.\n\n\u201cThe motorized trail program has been funded through off-road vehicle registration fees,\u201d Helmer said. \u201cMy goal is to develop a similar program for nonmotorized trails.\u201d\n\nHelmer has high hopes that he can work with other agencies to try to offset some of the Forest Service\u2019s funding losses.\n\n\u201cWe are working on some additional ways of funding trails,\u201d he said, though it\u2019s still in early stages.\n\nFor now, wilderness advocates like Halligan, Ferguson and McCarthy continue to try to fill the widening funding gaps and rally support.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Idaho Statesman, http://www.idahostatesman.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "When John McCarthy joined a seasonal Forest Service trail crew in the late 1970s, some of the trails forged through the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness in 1964 already were fading.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Nicole Blanchard"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
