He is pictured above at a film premiere in London earlier this year\n\nAnd he warned Netflix productions set in Britain could end up being \u2018slightly sanitised, cleaned up and commercialised\u2019 and not properly reflecting life in the UK.\n\nOne of Netflix\u2019s hit UK shows is The Crown, which chronicles the life of Queen Elizabeth II from the 1940s to modern times.\n\nCurtis, 62, told the Cheltenham Literature Festival: \u2018I tried to write a movie set in America, the first film I wrote, but I realised that I didn\u2019t know what people had in their fridge, what music they were listening to, how they got to school.\u2019\n\nHugh Grant and Andie MacDowell are pictured above in Four Weddings And A Funeral. The film has been criticised for presenting Britain as populated by awkward, upper-middle-class people living in trendily-dishevelled homes\n\nSpeaking about his films, he said the \u2018reason they are so British is because I\u2019m writing about the things I know about\u2019.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s why I\u2019m so nervous about Netflix buying up all the talent and everything because I worry that things are going to get bent away from what we know into a sort of slightly sanitised, cleaned up and commercialised version of what we view as that experience,\u2019 he added.\n\nHowever, critics of the screenwriter\u2019s work might level these precise charges back at him, for presenting a posh, picture-postcard view of Britain, especially London.\n\nWhen his film Notting Hill came out in 1999, it baffled the area\u2019s residents for presenting the community as a well-to-do \u2018sea of whiteness\u2019 in what is actually one of the most ethnically diverse boroughs in Britain.\n\nSimilarly, Four Weddings And A Funeral has been criticised for presenting Britain as populated by awkward, upper-middle-class people living in trendily-dishevelled homes and Love Actually has been panned for depicting a \u2018Christmas card\u2019 view of the capital.", "description": "Film director Richard Curtis has claimed attempts by US streaming service Netflix to make more productions set in Britain could distort the presentation of the country on film.", "authors": ["Richard Marsden For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/00/19670672-0-image-a-87_1571010064478.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
