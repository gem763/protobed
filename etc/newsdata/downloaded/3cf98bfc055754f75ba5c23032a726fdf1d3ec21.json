After winning the election, the country\u2019s first black president appointed Hillary Clinton his secretary of state. Speaking on Wednesday night, Obama said he looked to her to carry on his legacy.\n\n\u201cBlack, white, Latino, Asians, native Americans, young, old, gay, straight\u2026 men, women, both with disability pledging allegiance under the same proud flag to this big bold country that we love. That\u2019s what I see, that\u2019s the America that I know. And there is only one candidate in this race who believes in that future, has devoted her life to that future, a mother and a grandmother who would do anything to make our children thrive. A leader with real plans to break down barriers and blast through glass ceilings and widen the circle of opportunity to every single American. The next president of the United States: Hillary Clinton,\u201d Obama told the party\u2019s supporters.\n\nThe president also described Clinton as being uniquely qualified for the White House.\n\n\u201cNo matter how much people try to knock her down, she never, ever quits. That\u2019s the Hillary I know. That\u2019s the Hillary I\u2019ve come to admire. And that\u2019s why I can say with confidence there has never been a man or a woman \u2013 not me, not Bill \u2013 nobody more qualified than Hillary Clinton to serve as President of the United States of America,\u201d Obama went on.\n\nRepublicans have painted Clinton as a Washington insider who would represent a \u201cthird term\u201d for what they view as failed policies under Obama, who was elected to a second term in 2012.\n\nThe president set out an alternative portrayal of the United States as it is today, as he saw it, compared to the image struck by Donald Trump at last week\u2019s Republican convention.\n\nCiting \u201cAmerican values\u201d, Barack Obama said he was more optimistic about the country\u2019s future than ever before.\n\n\u201cAmerica has changed over the years. But these values my grandparents taught me \u2013 they haven\u2019t gone anywhere. They\u2019re as strong as ever; still cherished by people of every party, every race, every faith (\u2026) That\u2019s why anyone who threatens our values, whether fascists or communists or jihadists or homegrown demagogues, will always fail in the end,\u201d he said to applause and cheers from the audience.\n\nEarlier US Senator Tim Kaine who said Trump was \u201ca one-man wrecking crew\u201d, accepted the nomination to become Clinton\u2019s running mate.\n\nThe convention now awaits Clinton\u2019s formal acceptance of the Democratic party\u2019s nomination to run for president which takes place on the fourth and final day in Philadelphia.\n\nDemocrats have buttressed Clinton with a star gathering of current and past party notables at this week\u2019s convention.\n\nBy contrast, many prominent Republicans were absent from the party convention that nominated Trump for the White House last week.\n\nBut Trump got a boost in opinion polls from his convention. He had a two-point lead over Clinton in a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Tuesday, the first time he has been ahead since early May.", "description": "President Barack Obama, the star turn on the third day of the US Democratic Party\u2019s national convention, slammed Republican candidate Donald Trump\u2019s vision of the United States as being under siege fr", "authors": ["Barack Obama"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/339847/1000x563_339847.jpg", "published_at": "2016-07-28"}
