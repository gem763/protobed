Although Pep Guardiola had been so reassuringly calm at the height of a nerve-shredding title race with Liverpool, that instantly changed the week of the Champions League quarter-final against Tottenham Hotspur. There was now a tension. Guardiola seemed gripped by it, agitated.\n\nSome at City believe it influenced his more surprising tactical decisions around that tie, particularly the conservative make-up of the first-leg midfield. Guardiola had after all been dwelling on this. He\u2019d spent the previous summer obsessing about the reasons City had collapsed against Liverpool in the 2017-18 Champions League, trying to hardwire a solution into his team. He was that obsessed with the competition. One high-level source says it had become a \u201cfixation\u201d. It didn\u2019t fix things. It may even have had the opposite effect. City went out to a weaker team, by the tightest of margins, and it has all fed into a deeper tension underlying this season.\n\nIt may even form this whole Champions League season\u2019s defining theme. Can Guardiola finally claim that first ever European Cup for City, and a first for himself outside Barcelona?\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nWorse, it may be a tension only heightened in the first month of the campaign, despite the ease of City\u2019s group. That is because, off the pitch, there remains the real possibility the club could get a Champions League suspension - potentially up to three seasons - if found guilty of lying about violations of Financial Fair Play regulations.\n\nIf that is the case, some other possibilities will come all too close to reality. That the best team on the planet for the past two years won\u2019t actually prove they are the best in Europe. That Guardiola will again leave another club that has afforded him every advantage without the one trophy he was supposedly signed to bring. That he will become known as the manager who couldn\u2019t win it without Leo Messi. That he will never get the third European Cup that would really reflect his place in football history.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The Champions League could go very, very badly for Chelsea. AFP/Getty Images 20/33 14. Ajax Last year's semi-finalists, although they were made to sweat in qualifying this time around, and have lost star players Frenkie de Jong and Matthijs de Ligt. AFP/Getty Images 21/33 13. Napoli Dark horses part one. Kostas Manolas and Kalidou Koulibaly might be the best centre-half pairing in the competition, and they have plenty of attacking resources from which to draw.

AFP/Getty Images 30/33 4. Juventus The Ronaldo project worked, to some extent, in year one, and Juventus are making the right moves to improve the team around him and properly contend in the Champions League this year. Matthijs De Ligt's development will be fun to watch, though Maurizio Sarri's rigidity may hinder the Italians. AFP/Getty Images 31/33 3. Liverpool Right in the mix, again. Jurgen Klopp's side are possibly due a slightly less successful campaign, though, and an injury drastically alters the appearance of such a settled lineup in key areas. Getty Images 32/33 2. Barcelona Lionel Messi wants another Champions League. That should be reason enough to rank Barcelona this highly, even after their recent misfires. Antoine Griezmann has arrived, Neymar may be on his way, Frenkie De Jong is the best young player in Europe - this might just be the Catalans' year. Getty Images 33/33 1.

Manchester City Pep Guardiola's City tenure will not feel fully complete without taking them to the top of the Champions League mountain, and they are shaping as favourites, with squad depth, consistency and an ability to rip teams apart in four or five different ways. Getty Images\n\nIn the present, in public, the City boss has naturally attempted to strike a different tone.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be the same guy if I don\u2019t win it,\u201d Guardiola said on the day of this season\u2019s draw. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to change my life.\u201d\n\nBut it may change his legacy.\n\nThose who know Guardiola say he is all too aware of this. They say he really does have a singular fixation with the Champions League, because of everything it represents.\n\nThis is after all a man who has immersed himself in the lore of the competition, and spent hours with colleagues and rival managers discussing its history and greatest teams. This is a man who describes his first European Cup victory, and only one as a player, in 1992, as his \u201cgreatest memory\u201d. Winning it as a manager, however, gave him \u201cthe greatest satisfaction\u201d.\n\nThis is a man who couldn\u2019t sleep the night before that 2009 victory in Rome. By the end of the next night, walking onto that Olympic Stadium pitch to savour the moment, he turned to his long-time colleague Manel Estiarte. \u201cWe are the European champions! It feels like we\u2019ve just written our names in history.\u201d\n\nThis is what he is all too invested in.\n\nAnd this is what a similar Champions League obsessive in Sir Alex Ferguson recognised as long ago as 2012, when Guardiola had won two in four years. Writing in Guillem Balague\u2019s biography of the Catalan, \u2018Another Way of Winning\u2019, the great Scot said: \u201cIf I had arrived in time to advise him, I would have told Pep not to worry about it: a failure to win the Champions League is not an indictment of his manager abilities or of his team.\u201d\n\nFor Ferguson to say this is all the more pointed, given he speaks from the same excruciating experience, and may well represent Guardiola\u2019s future. Long recognised as one of the greatest ever, Ferguson never won more than two. It long pained him.\n\nGuardiola may even suffer from the same ironic flaws as Ferguson. The very brilliance that ensures he utterly dominates domestically may actually under-cut him on the continent, because his sides are built for the longer run. The attempt to then adapt that for sudden-death knock-out then leads him to second-guess himself; to create unnecessary problems.\n\nIt is almost a self-defeating brilliance; an obsessiveness about the profession that at once makes his career but breaks him on such nights.\n\nIt is also difficult not to feel this is deepened by his history with Barcelona, and not just because of the great 2008-11 side against which everything else in his career is judged.\n\nGuardiola was always the ultimate Barca supporter, his basic football obsessiveness naturally lending itself to an obsessiveness about his club, that was only amplified by his sense of Catalan identity. Guardiola the player would often go around schools encouraging pupils to read the region\u2019s poetry. Guardiola the pedant would spend the night before the 1992 Champions League final arguing with Julio Salinas about the exact number of steps at Wembley, the older teammate enjoying just winding up that very sense of obsessiveness.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m telling you!\u201d Guardiola shouted, until Andoni Zubizarreta told him to shut up.\n\nHe just consumed it all. And yet, through it all, there was always the knowledge that the sport\u2019s most special prize belonged to Real Madrid more than anyone else. They\u2019d won the European Cup more than anyone else. That\u2019s who it was most identified with. The worst part for the young Guardiola was the knowledge that, while the European Cup was a permanent testament to Madrid\u2019s greatness, it was a persistent reminder of Barca\u2019s capacity for calamity.\n\nThey found so many ways to flounder.\n\nOne of the most infamous actually followed one of the most famous photos of Guardiola. It was after the stirring 3-0 semi-final against Gothenburg in the 1985-86 semi-finals, when the then 15-year-old ballboy was pictured trying to embrace Victor Munoz, the scorer of the decisive kick in the penalty shoot-out. It seemed, after 31 years, it was finally to happen. They\u2019d just delivered the kind of victory that suggests destiny. They were then set to play in Seville, against Steaua Bucharest, who couldn\u2019t bring any fans from communist Romania.\n\nAnd still they lost, on penalties.\n\nTo the teenage Guardiola, and so many other Barca fans, the club seemed cursed in the competition. Director Joan Gaspart described it as \u201ca terrible trauma\u201d.\n\nThe neurosis about the competition only deepened\u2026 but release was not far. It came just six years later, with Guardiola in the centre.\n\nAfter Johan Cruyff\u2019s \u2018Dream Team\u2019 beat Sampdoria 1-0 in the 1992 final, their 22-year-old midfielder was the one to present that grandiose trophy to the Barcelona crowd from the Generalitat Palace.\n\nGuardiola did so with a prepared phrase, that intentionally echoed the words of former Catalan president Josep Tarradellas, and similarly represented the end of a long wait for nationalist outpouring.\n\n\u201cCitizens of Catalonia, here I am,\u201d proclaimed Tarradellas, on his return from exile after the death of General Franco.\n\n\u201cCitizens of Catalonia,\u201d Guardiola began, \u201chere it is.\u201d\n\nThat is what it represented: validation, vindication, release and the ultimate recognition.\n\nBarcelona, with everything the club themselves represented beyond football, were a European superpower.\n\nThere is thereby more wrapped up in that great trophy for Guardiola than most.\n\nLoading....\n\nIt was also why making Barcelona the European superpower between 2008 and 2011 wore more heavily on him than most.\n\nThis was \u201cthe dream\u201d, he\u2019d tell his staff. It just required so much conscious mental effort. He would agonise for hours about European games. This was his most intense love, obsession and ambition all combined, to the point it brought him close to combustion. He eventually had to just walk away, rather than risk dropping off.\n\nThe seemingly constant political storm at the club hardly helped, because it created problems way beyond his control.\n\nAnd this is part of the problem for him with the Champions League, and how it plays on his neurosis with it.\n\nThe fundamental of Guardiola\u2019s entire football philosophy, after all, is control. Of possession, of space, of flow, of games.\n\nAll of that in itself is a logical extension of Guardiola\u2019s micromanagement, of his will to predict every possible way a game can pan out.\n\nJust think of some of his signature performances in the competition, particularly the peak that Barcelona\u2019s 2011 final against Manchester United represented. Guardiola\u2019s side were in total command. They would play to such a relentlessly oppressive level the opposition just could not cope.\n\nThis very ideal, properly executed, is a virtual guarantee of victory over the course of a league season. It just doesn\u2019t allow enough errors. It is what Guardiola so works for all season\u2026 but then so second-guesses on single nights.\n\nThe problem with the Champions League is that just one error is enough to explode all of that, to send an entire season spinning out of control. Single ties that mean so much can swing so much, on single incidents beyond anyone's control. It is the \u201cglorious contradiction\u201d at the core of the competition: set up to decide the greatest, but in no way designed to confirm the greatest. There's too much blind chance involved.\n\nThis was something well articulated by Bayern Munich chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, when trying to explain away Guardiola\u2019s first Champions League elimination with the club, and worst overall: the 4-0 humiliation to Madrid in 2013-14.\n\n\u201cWith the quality of football nowadays, all it takes is one bad day and you\u2019re out of the Champions League. That\u2019s what has happened here. In the league you could lose a game 4-0, but if you\u2019re in good shape you can then go on to win the next 10 games. In the Champions League, it\u2019s much more cut-throat.\u201d\n\nIt feels like a contradiction Guardiola still hasn\u2019t completely got his head around.\n\nIt is why, since Barcelona, he has so often stressed to his players the \u201cfine line between success and failure\u201d. It is why, in stark contrast to a results absolutist like Jose Mourinho, Guardiola has reframed what success means to him. Staying in contention in the major competitions until the end of a season is all he feels you can guarantee. \u201cWe have done what we had to do.\u201d\n\nThereafter, instant intangibles - an impossible clearance, an incorrect offside, a volcano erupting, a missed penalty - have a decisive influence.\n\nThose are the limits of control.\n\n\u201cChelsea didn\u2019t win the European Cup because [John] Terry slipped when taking a penalty,\u201d Guardiola says in bemusement in Balague\u2019s book. \u201cHe slipped! I\u2019ve given the players that example a thousand times.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s also repeatedly told them how the knock-outs are \u201cdangerous\u201d, how, \u201cfuck, you can\u2019t afford to give away even five minutes in the Champions League!\u201d\n\nAnd yet his teams, even at their best, have repeatedly done this. They\u2019ve just gone missing. It happened against Inter in 2010, Madrid in 2014, Barcelona in 2015 and Liverpool in 2018. It was as if they were stunned that things suddenly went out of control, so temporarily lost it altogether.\n\nIt is also the curiosity with Guardiola sides in the Champions League.\n\nThey have either gone out by the slimmest of margins, or the largest. Never in between.\n\nLittle wonder it further wracks Guardiola\u2019s mind.\n\nLess wonder his entire approach to the competition now feels an attempt to find a compromise, to try to contain the uncontrollable.\n\nThere is now a genuine argument that only feeds the neurosis about it, however, and leads to those decisions that actually constrain his team\u2019s best qualities. There\u2019s a danger it makes it all a self-fulfilling prophecy, ensuring the destiny of perhaps the greatest manager ever is not, in fact, to have the best record in the greatest club competition.\n\nIt is to remain frustratingly unfulfilled, to be the manager who couldn\u2019t win it without Messi.\n\nThere is evidence this is something else that has played on his mind. At one City function, a senior club figure was asked whether Guardiola had ever requested the signing of Messi. \u201cIt\u2019s a controversial topic for Pep,\u201d the official smiled, revealing it was something Guardiola had vocally mulled over. He ultimately wants to do it without Messi, though, to prove he can.\n\nIt is of course not a surprise that the two produced the greatest team ever. Messi is so good, and has - yes - such ball control, he erodes the uncontrollable in such ties.\n\n\u201cMessi is the one who makes the difference,\u201d Guardiola once said.\n\nHe now has to find that way to make the difference himself in the Champions League, to reclaim control of his legacy.\n\nHe could maybe do with listening to one figure from 27 years ago.\n\n\u201cIn cup finals it is fear, or holding something back in reserve, which can defeat you. The worst that can happen in a match like this is that nobody wants to have a shot, score the goals or assume responsibility for winning because nerves dominate their choices. We need to be brave. I\u2019ve no doubt that a couple of hours before the match I\u2019ll have butterflies in my stomach, but we have to show what we are made of, how good we are.\u201d\n\nThose were the words of a 21-year-old Guardiola, on the eve of his first Champions League win.\n\nThe current Guardiola could do with listening. It might, however, be something he can\u2019t control about himself.", "description": "The Manchester City players were very quickly struck by the difference.
