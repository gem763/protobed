The app will help confirm the patient's symptoms and, if necessary, call an ambulance. The app will simultaneously send alerts to the patient's family.\n\nZhang Wei, corporate vice president and head of medicine at Boehringer Ingelheim Greater China, explained that the identification will be mainly based on facial scans and data collected by monitoring machines on the patient's body.\n\nAfter participating in professional rehabilitation, the complete care and prevention package suggested patients wear monitoring devices to prevent a secondary stroke, as the recurrence rate of stroke within one year is as high as 17 percent.\n\n\"We are not only a research-driven pharmaceutical company, but also one that aims to provide new healthcare models and solutions,\" said Felix Gutsche, Chairman and CEO of Boehringer Ingelheim Greater China.\n\n\"We hope to join hands with more partners to help stroke patients overcome difficulties and challenges they meet at every stage, and jointly embrace health challenges in China's ageing society,\" he said.\n\nMedical experts said that more than 2,000 stroke treatment centers, where patients have access to green channels to receive CT scans and other physical examinations or medical treatment within three hours, have been built within hospitals around the country.", "description": "German pharmaceutical company Boehringer Ingelheim, a major player in the development of production of drugs for the treatment of strokes, will unveil a monitoring app for the disease allowing potential patients to track their conditions for prevention and rehabilitationduring the second China International Import Expo in Shanghai in November.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/08/5d9c6093a310cf3e97a021f2.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
