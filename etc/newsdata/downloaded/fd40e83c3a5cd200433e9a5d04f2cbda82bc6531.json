In the year to July, property prices rose by 0.7 per cent, down from a 1.4 per cent rise in the year to June.\n\nThis is the lowest annual rate since September 2012, when it was 0.4 per cent. Over the past three years, there has been a general slowdown in UK house price growth, driven mainly by a slowdown in the south and east of England.\n\nThe lowest annual growth was in the North East, where prices fell by 2.9 per cent over the year to July. This was followed by the South East, where prices fell by 2 per cent over the year.", "description": "With would-be sellers nervous about taking the plunge and putting their home up for sale, the number of properties on estate agents' books remains close to a record low.", "authors": ["Jane Denton For Thisismoney", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
