It promised to employ hundreds more in the coming weeks.\n\nMr Batt said Barrhead Travel supported the move made by Hays Travel.\n\nHe added: \u2018It\u2019s a very bold move and we think that\u2019s very good for the industry and, most importantly, it\u2019s good for customers and great for the staff.\n\n\u2018We were very saddened to see those doors close and the staff lose their jobs. Now, hopefully, between Hays Travel and people like ourselves and the rest of the travel agency community, we\u2019re hoping that all those jobs will get replaced.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a great business to be in. You go to work every day dealing with people\u2019s dreams.\u2019\n\nThomas Cook collapsed two weeks ago with the loss of 21,000 Cook staff globally\n\nMr Batt said this was an opportunity to expand the scope of Barrhead Travel, as Thomas Cook closures had left gaps in the high street. He added: \u2018Where their stores are, that market is now underserved. There\u2019s a lot of people who enjoy using a travel agency. They don\u2019t want to book vacations online; they don\u2019t want to book complicated itineraries online.\u2019\n\nJacqueline Dobson, president of Barrhead Travel, said the company had received messages of thanks from former Thomas Cook employees. She added: \u2018The staff are very relieved and very grateful that we\u2019re giving them this opportunity to be re-employed again. They\u2019re absolutely delighted.\n\n\u2018We are looking forward to opening more Barrhead stores and helping our colleagues across the industry get back to serving their loyal clients.\n\nSunderland based Hays Travel has also stepped in and said it could save up to 2,500 Thomas Cook jobs after buying the collapsed firm\u2019s 555 stores. John Hays, Founder and Managing director, and Irene Hays, Chair of Hays Travel Group, pictured at their HQ in Sunderland\n\n\u2018The high street travel agency is very much alive in the UK and is pivotal in today\u2019s holiday booking journey.\u2019\n\nUnite Assistant General Secretary Diana Holland said: \u2018Given the latest developments, it is clear that the Government\u2019s assessment that providing any financial assistance would risk \u201cthrowing good money after bad\u201d has been proven to be entirely false. The Government should look again at the UK Thomas Cook airline and call a halt to the insolvency process.\n\n\u2018This would then allow there to be a proper and thorough examination of what action can be taken to find employment opportunities for Thomas Cook\u2019s airline staff.\u2019\n\nManuel Cortes, general secretary of the Transport Salaried Staffs\u2019 Association, which represents Thomas Cook workers, said he hoped to arrange a meeting with Barrhead Travel to discuss \u2018positive working arrangements\u2019 across all stores.\n\nHe added: \u2018Our union will be keen to know more about the offer to our members \u2013 as job security will be foremost in their minds.\u2019\n\nAbout 21,000 Thomas Cook staff globally lost their jobs when the company went under, including 9,000 in the UK.", "description": "Barrhead Travel revealed it was already recruiting dozens of staff left jobless when its rival collapsed two weeks ago.
