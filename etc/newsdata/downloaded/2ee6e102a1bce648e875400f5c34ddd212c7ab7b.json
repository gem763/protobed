'It was the worst time of my life and I was absolutely terrified,' she says.\n\nIt was in April this year when little Alba, who was about to turn one, contracted measles.\n\nToo young to be vaccinated, the youngster was hospitalised after her temperature soared to 42c. Her eyes were swollen shut and doctors were worried that Alba could lose her sight. She couldn't eat or drink and had so much trouble breathing that she had to be put on oxygen.\n\nIt was a terrifying time for Jilly, 35, a full-time mother and husband Richard, 35, a product manager who live in Surbiton, Surrey, with their daughter, now 18 months. The couple have no idea where she caught the virus, but Alba first showed signs of the illness in the days leading up to her birthday on April 1.\n\nIt was in April this year when little Alba, who was about to turn one, contracted measles\n\n'She had no appetite, a high temperature, puffy eyes and a very delicate rash on the back of her head and I was back and forth to the doctors who kept saying it was viral and nothing to worry about,' says Jilly.\n\n'She'd been a healthy baby before that but about four days after her birthday, I was getting increasingly concerned. I took a picture of her rash and sent it to my granny, a 93-year-old former teacher, and she rang me straight away and said: \"She's got measles.\" But when I took Alba back to the GP, the doctor said I shouldn't worry.'\n\nHowever the next day, the couple took their little girl to Chelsea And Westminster hospital.\n\n'She hadn't eaten or drunk anything and we were getting really concerned,' says Jilly. 'That's where they diagnosed measles. At first, I was relieved. I thought it could have been meningitis and when I heard the word 'measles', I assumed it was the sort of illness children recovered from all the time. But the doctor said: \"I don't think you realise, it's incredibly serious.\" '\n\nThe couple have no idea where she caught the virus, but Alba first showed signs of the illness in the days leading up to her birthday on April 1\n\nThe next eight days saw Alba undergo several tests, including a spinal tap and an MRI scan, and she given strong doses of antibiotics.\n\n'Her little body was shutting down and the doctors wanted to make sure there were no secondary infections,' Jilly recalls. 'The doctors and nurses were incredible. They kept us calm and it was only afterwards, when we were discharged, that they admitted how very worried they'd been.'\n\nIn fact, the doctors urged the couple to share pictures of their daughter on social media to encourage people to be vaccinated.\n\n'They said: \"We're seeing more and more cases of measles, so it would be good if you could share these images online and educate them about what could happen.\" And I was more than happy to do that.'\n\nIt was a terrifying time for Jilly Moss (pictured), 35, a full-time mother and husband Richard, 35, a product manager who live in Surbiton, Surrey\n\nBut when Jilly shared a post on Facebook showing pictures of Alba covered in measles and encouraging people to vaccinate their children, she was shocked by the backlash.\n\n'I've never witnessed hatred like it from mothers to another mother,' she says. 'They were blaming me, saying that it was my fault she'd got measles because I hadn't kept her at home all year.\n\n'They said I had been feeding Alba poison because I'd been formula-feeding her \u2014 in fact, I'd been breastfeeding \u2014 and at one point, they suggested that none of it was real. They said Richard worked for a big pharmaceutical company, that I was an actress and Alba was a doll.\n\n'They'd send me information containing absolute rubbish \u2014 saying there were 'dead baby cells' in the MMR vaccine and things like that. What boggles my brain is that most of the anti-vaxxers are from my generation, people who have been vaccinated themselves, so they are protected but won't protect their own children. They believe there's a link with autism, even though the doctor who started the MMR scare [Andrew Wakefield] has been totally discredited and lost his licence.'\n\nAlba is still undergoing tests to see if the illness has affected her in the long term.\n\n'She's not out of the woods and only a couple of weeks ago had to be rushed into hospital with a convulsion which may or may not be related,' says Jilly.\n\n'She's been having vacant episodes and there was talk about possible epilepsy. We're waiting to see a neurologist to see if any damage has been done but we just don't know.\n\n'I will never understand people who won't trust doctors when it comes to vaccines. If their child wasn't breathing, they'd take it straight to the hospital to be treated by doctors, not stick it in a darkened room and give it vitamins.\n\n'If anyone is concerned or worried about what's in the vaccine or about side-effects, they should speak to their doctor and get advice. The last thing they should do is go on the internet and read what the anti-vaxxers are saying.\n\n'I wouldn't want to wish what we've been through on anyone.'\n\nMy child was close to death \u2013 because I DIDN\u2019T give her jab\n\nIn January 2017, Debbie Roscoe's daughter, Ellie, was just hours from dying after she contracted measles.\n\nDebbie, 57, a charity campaigner from Harborne, Birmingham, had chosen not to give Ellie, now 25, the second MMR jab as a toddler after reading news stories linking the vaccinations to autism.\n\nHere Debbie and Ellie share their story to warn other parents just how serious the consequences of not vaccinating your child can be . . .\n\nDebbie says: When all the scare stories, saying MMR jabs could cause autism, broke in 1998, Ellie \u2013 then aged four \u2014 had just been scheduled to have hers.\n\nIn January 2017, Debbie Roscoe's daughter, Ellie, was just hours from dying after she contracted measles\n\nI have a close friend who has two daughters with severe autism, and I knew how challenging it can be; I thought that even if Ellie did catch measles, mumps or rubella, they couldn't be anywhere near as bad.\n\nSo, though she'd had the first of the two jabs when she was younger, I decided she shouldn't have her second.\n\nNineteen years later at the start of 2017, aged 23, Ellie developed a severe hacking cough and rash, so I took her to our family GP, who diagnosed chicken pox. But the rash got worse and her temperature kept rising, so we went to see another GP, who gave the same diagnosis.\n\nSomething just didn't seem right, and that evening, I called my mum for advice. She told me I should wait until the morning \u2014 we'd seen two doctors who had the same opinion and I was probably just being over-anxious.\n\nI dialled the NHS 111 line, but was told to wait and see if things deteriorated. However, all my instincts were telling me that this was serious.\n\nAfter calling 999, I was told we'd have to wait up to four hours for an ambulance, as I'd already had two doctors tell me that it was chickenpox. By then, Ellie was hallucinating and coughing uncontrollably, so I decided to drive her to Heartlands Hospital, in Bordesley Green, Birmingham, myself.\n\nAt the hospital, a nurse took one look and I could immediately tell how serious it was by his face. A consultant came straight away and sent Ellie for blood tests and chest X-rays.\n\nEllie developed a severe hacking cough and rash, so I took her to our family GP\n\nAt first, they thought Ellie might have meningitis, so when I was told it was measles I breathed a sigh of relief because I had no idea how serious it could be.\n\nThen the consultant told me Ellie's life was in the balance, and if I'd waited until the morning to bring her in, she would likely have died.\n\nPut into isolation, placed on oxygen and given anti-viral drugs, Ellie slowly recovered. But sitting by her bedside, seeing measles completely envelope my gorgeous daughter, I felt so angry and also guilty.\n\nIf I'd been better informed in 1998, I would 100 per cent have made Ellie have that second jab.\n\nShe was discharged five days later, but she's never really been the same since. At the start of this year, she was diagnosed with lupus, an autoimmune disease that develops after a virus and which causes the body's immune system to attack your vital organs, bones and skin. She will have to take medications to combat the disease \u2014 which is believed to have been triggered by her measles \u2014 for the rest of her life.\n\nWhile I still believe that getting your child vaccinated should be the choice of every parent, that decision needs to be informed by the real facts, not scare-mongering.\n\nJust look at the photograph of Ellie when she was hours from death and you'll see the reality of what can happen if your child doesn't get vaccinated. It seems like a no-brainer to me.\n\nIf it wasn't for the amazing medical staff at Heartlands, their quick response, amazing professionalism and continuing care, Ellie wouldn't be here.\n\nSince her illness I've decided to create something positive out of such a horrific situation, and set up a charity called Arrive Alive to help raise money for Community First Responders, medically-trained volunteers deployed via a 999 call, who can deliver life-saving treatment during those vital minutes before an ambulance can arrive. I almost lost my beautiful daughter \u2014 now I want to make sure that no one else loses their child.\n\nEllie says: Before I got measles, I didn't really understand the importance of vaccinations. But going through what I did, and almost dying in the process, has shown me how vital they are.\n\nI'm not angry with my mum for making the decision she did, and she shouldn't feel guilty \u2014 she used the information available at the time to do what she thought was best for me.\n\nBut I'm livid with the anti-vaxxers who are trying to persuade parents to not vaccinate their children when they don't understand what they're saying.\n\nIf I'd died, Mum would've been racked with the most crushing guilt for the rest of her life, and all because of some flawed science scaring people into not protecting their children.\n\nWe want to share our story so that more parents know how deadly measles can be. While nobody can definitively say my lupus was caused by my measles, it's what all the evidence points towards.\n\nThanks to the disease, my life is on hold \u2014 I can't do any of the normal things a 25-year-old can do, such as going out to bars or clubs, playing sport, focusing on building a career or even going shopping.\n\nThe medications I'm on now to suppress my immune system and stop it from attacking me are one step down from chemotherapy in terms of strength and severity. I can't go out in the sun or cold, I can't be exposed to people with bugs, I'm so tired all the time, and my joints constantly ache.\n\nThere will always be potential side-effects from any medication or vaccine, but I just hope my story \u2014 and those of dozens like me \u2014 will encourage more parents to get their children fully vaccinated.\n\nTo help Arrive Alive save more lives, visit arrivealiveresponse.co.uk", "description": "Jilly Moss, 35, who lives in Surbiton, Surrey, will never forget the night she thought that her baby daughter Alba (pictured) was going to die.
