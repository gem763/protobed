That last criticism centered on a question from an audience member who took direct aim at the 2020 presidential candidate\u2019s pledge to refuse money from the fossil fuel industry, by confronting Biden about the fundraiser the candidate has scheduled for the very next night at the home of a natural gas executive.\n\n.@JoeBiden\u2018s answer on fracking was a rambling incoherent mess. Honestly, the more he talks, the more it is clear he is declining cognitively rapidly. It\u2019s irresponsible of the Democratic Party and media to pretend these are \u201cgaffes.\u201d He is not well #ClimateTownHall \u2014 Jordan (@JordanChariton) September 5, 2019\n\nThat audience question just nailed Biden \u2014 he\u2019s going to a high-dollar fundraiser with hedge fund & FF executives tomorrow night. And his response is not that convincing, honestly. \u2014 David Roberts (@drvox) September 5, 2019\n\nJoe Biden is really struggs to func at this climate town hall \u2014 Annie Shields (@anastasiakeeley) September 5, 2019\n\nSome context for just one of the reasons why Biden is hedging on every question.#ClimateTownHall https://t.co/puk5CpJAc0 \u2014 Maya Schenwar (@MayaSchenwar) September 5, 2019\n\nA question now from a fellow Pennsylvanian about the threat of fracked natural gas and what his policies will be. @JoeBiden\u2018s response seems pretty diffuse and noncommittal. Says he\u2019ll stop new drilling but not call for a ban, and impose safety standards.#CNNClimateTownHall \u2014 Michael E.

And I don\u2019t just mean this is America, I mean this is and you see what I mean. And on the flipside, it\u2019s like my gruncle my grunc my uncle said to me. He said look Joe. Anyway.
