He said investors need to be wary of the cloud stocks now that they have fallen out of fashion and should only consider the best in the group and only after they have fallen a little more.\n\nIn this daily bar chart of UBER, below, we can see that prices have suffered a decline the past four months but things are starting to show some bullish promise. Yes, prices are still below the declining 50-day simple moving average line but they are above the bottoming 20-day moving average line. (Because we only have a few months of data we shortened our moving averages to 20-days and 50-days from 50-days and 200-days.)\n\nThe daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line shows a decline the past four months as sellers of UBER were more aggressive with heavier trading volume seen on days when the stock closed lower.\n\nIn the lower panel is the 12-day price momentum study which shows that downside momentum or acceleration slowed from August to October even as prices made a lower low. This is a classic bullish divergence as prices go lower but the indicator does not follow with the same pattern. This is a \"heads up\" that investors have become scale down buyers into the weakness. This is why the pace of the decline slows.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of UBER, below, we can see a potential upside price target of $35. A rally to $35 means that UBER could break above its September highs and that would be a positive.\n\nBottom line strategy: The end of a lock up means there can be selling but it does not have to happen and buyers might actually be aggressive enough to absorb the supply. Keeping that in mind we want to start to approach UBER from the long side if you can afford to risk a close below $28 or a new low close.", "description": "Let's check out UBER this morning to see if we want to take a ride on the long side....UBER", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Uber Technologies Could Soon Make A Decent Looking Bottom", "Let'S Check Out Uber This Morning To See If We Want To Take A Ride On The Long Side.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "James", "Rev Shark", "Bret Jensen", "Bob Lang", "Carolyn Boroden", "Doug Kass"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/daa2386a-c881-11e7-8e75-fd32cfd8fc30.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
