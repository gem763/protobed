So far in 2019, there is a Grand Canyon of separation between the contenders and everybody else.\n\nSure, there will be upsets - or what we conclude are upsets until we learn more about the 32 teams. No, the Dolphins aren\u2019t likely to pull off one of those anytime soon, and the NFL\u2019s bottom teams won\u2019t have their players filling fantasy rosters.\n\nWhat\u2019s depressing is that apparently the clubs who can\u2019t find their way into the victory column, or who luckily have because they faced another helpless team, are so far removed from the top that they might as well be playing in Conference USA.\n\nHow wide is this gulf? Enough that there already are a half-dozen teams whose only remaining goal should be displaying some improvement as we head into winter.\n\nIn Miami, that would constitute not getting blown out; the Dolphins have been outscored 133-16, an historically inept pace. In New Jersey, it would involve the Jets\u2019 Sam Darnold returning from a bout with mononucleosis and taking the kind of step highly touted second-year quarterbacks should achieve.\n\nIn Cincinnati , it\u2019s a matter of figuring out how to run the ball and stop the opposition from doing so. In Arizona, adapting to new coach Kliff Kingsbury\u2019s offensive schemes and keeping Kyler Murray healthy and on an upward progression.\n\nFor the Redskins, the objective soon will be developing first-round QB Dwayne Haskins, a dicey proposition as coach Jay Gruden also seeks to hold onto a job that is slipping away with each poor on-field showing.\n\nAnd in Oakland, it just might be not turning off the folks in the Nevada desert who next year will claim the Raiders as their own.\n\nDoes anyone really think any of those clubs can stage the kind of turnaround that the Colts (1-5 to a wild-card playoff win) did in 2018?\n\nEven some teams a mere game out of their division lead - Tampa Bay, Atlanta, the Giants - have shown more inclination to be cellar dwellers than title chasers.\n\nThe two teams seemingly with at least a decent chance of stopping the freefall are Denver and Pittsburgh.\n\nIt\u2019s surprising that the Broncos are 0-3; they were 1 second from beating Chicago, which might have received a break with the clock to grab that Week 2 win. Has Denver\u2019s defense really taken a Mile High holiday with no sacks and no turnovers yet? Is the offense in neutral for good?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re young and we\u2019ve got some young guys,\u201d says veteran receiver Emmanuel Sanders. \u201cI look at (tight end) Noah Fant, a young guy. I look at (offensive lineman) Dalton (Risner). I still look at (tackle Garett) Bolles, he\u2019s young. The year we went to the Super Bowl, we had veteran guys even on the special teams. We had older guys on the special teams. We\u2019re young.\n\n\u201cI understand that sometimes it can get frustrating because you want to win, but at the same time you\u2019ve got to understand these guys are young and they\u2019ve got to grow to be professionals. You don\u2019t step into the NFL and say, \u2018Oh yeah, that guy\u2019s a pro.\u2019 Some people it takes three or four years for them to even get in the groove of it. You\u2019ve got to understand, you guys are just thinking about football, but these guys are balancing stuff off the field to try to just get a rhythm of just being a true pro.\u201d\n\nPittsburgh would seem to have enough true pros, plus a Super Bowl-winning coach in Mike Tomlin, to find the formula to be competitive and victorious. Sure, Ben Roethlisberger (elbow surgery) is done for the season and the other two main weapons when the Steelers had their own triple threat on offense - RB Le\u2019Veon Bell and WR Antonio Brown (anybody heard from him this week?) - also are gone. But unlike so many of the other stragglers at the bottom of the standings, there is plenty of talent in Pittsburgh to get things righted.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not into the keep it together discussions,\u201d Tomlin says. \u201cThat\u2019s not how we\u2019re built. We have a game next week. We\u2019ll be ready.\u201d\n\nNow, should they fall to the winless Bengals \u2026\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "You can take that \"any given Sunday\" bromide and toss it out with some of Case Keenum's interceptions.
