(Gif: NASA/InSight)\n\nAfter being stuck for months, the InSight lander\u2019s heat probe has managed to dig down a few centimetres into the Martian dirt. It\u2019s a positive sign that the probe didn\u2019t hit a rock as engineers originally feared and that a newly devised strategy to remedy the situation is actually working.\n\nIn this latest test, the heat probe managed to progress about 3 centimetres. That\u2019s not a huge distance by any measure, but it\u2019s a massive leap for the InSight team, which has been grappling with this thorny problem since late February.\n\nBuilt by the German Aerospace Centre (DLR), the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package (HP3) is designed to measure the heat emanating from beneath the Martian surface. The probe component of HP3, dubbed the \u201cmole,\u201d was expected to descend down to a depth of around 5 metres, but it didn\u2019t get any further than 35 centimetres before it simply stopped.\n\nFears quickly emerged that the mole had struck a rock. If true, that would\u2019ve signified the end of the HP3 mission, as the probe cannot be pulled out and relocated.\n\nThis past winter, however, new evidence emerged suggesting the mole hadn\u2019t struck a rock but rather some dense material. Invigorated with hope, the InSight team devised a new strategy in an attempt to restore friction between the mole and the ground material \u2014 a requirement for the probe\u2019s forward motion (otherwise the mole just bounces around in place like a pogo stick). To get the needed friction, the team used the InSight lander\u2019s robotic claw to pin the mole against the wall of the shallow hole.\n\nExcitingly, this strategy appears to be working, according to a tweet put out by the German Aerospace Agency.\n\n\u201cGood news from #Mars! Confirmed!,\u201d exclaimed the agency in the tweet. \u201cAfter 3 cm progress, it appears the @DLR_de \u2018Mole\u2019 on @NASAInSight was not stopped in its tracks by a rock under the Martian surface but had in fact lost friction.\u201d\n\nGood news from #Mars!

It actually looks really great, even if it\u2019s small process.\n\nA tweet from the NASA InSight account echoed the pronouncement: \u201cWith an assist from my robotic arm, the mole is digging again! We are just starting this new campaign, and are hopeful we can continue to dig.\u201d\n\nNot much more is known beyond these tweets, but an astute commenter asked if the attached cable, which is spinning along with the mole, might pose a problem as the probe gets deeper.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve noted the spin,\u201d replied DLR. \u201cIt\u2019s roughly 10\u00b0 per 2cm. In the testbed we\u2019ve seen a rotation by 270\u00b0 for 5m. We\u2019re watching the present situation w/ care being confident that the rotation will be reduced once tether is in ground. It\u2019s expected to act as a \u2018fin\u2019 slowing the rotation down.\u201d\n\nSo, that\u2019s a big \u201cphew.\u201d The heat probe is a key component of InSight\u2019s mission to study the interior of Mars, and it would have been extremely disappointing if it had failed altogether. Hopefully these precious few centimetres of progress represent a sign of success to come.", "description": "After being stuck for months, the InSight lander\u2019s heat probe has managed to dig down a few centimetres into the Martian dirt.
