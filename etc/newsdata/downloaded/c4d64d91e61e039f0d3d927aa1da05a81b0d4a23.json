Today, there are many shows that have banked on these teenage experiences and churned out stories that not only hit close to home but also feel super relatable.\n\nWhile all of us love to binge-watch new shows, here are some teenage romance stories that deserve to be watched again:\n\n1. Remix:\n\nThis is one show that most of us 90\u2019s kids grew up watching. This show revolved around the lives of four school kids - Yuvraj, Anvesha, Ranveer, and Tia. It has been 13 years since the show was premiered on Star One (now a defunct channel) but it's still etched so fresh in our memories. In the show, we saw the cast struggle with one-sided love, fragile relationships and first love.\n\n2. Flames:\n\nThe second season of this iconic web series is back with our favourite digital sweethearts Ritvik Sahore (essaying the role of Rajat) and Taniya Maniktala (playing Ishita) in the lead. Chapter 2 in their journey on MX Exclusive - Flames Season 2, A TVF Original. Season 1 ended on the duo becoming a couple, leaving audiences curious to know how life would change for this duo! But, the second term sees their equation explode with combustible love while they try to balance friendship, their personal goals and the high and lows of being in a relationship.\n\nBetween textbooks and rickshaw rides \u2013 Rajat and Ishita turned into a quintessential high school romance. But has this love story crumbled already?\n\nDon't forget the stream the show on MX Player, NOW!\n\n3. Gilmore Girls:\n\nIf there is one show that should be considered a classic, it is Gilmore Girls. The teenage romance part of the show comes from Rory\u2019s perspective as we see her navigate through two major relationships and heartbreaks while balancing her academics at the same time. The show is a timeless representation of all the emotions that accompany love.\n\n4. College Romance:\n\nCollege Romance by The Timeliners is a fun-filled humorous yet dramatic story of 3 friends who fall in love with people very different from them. The series will take you on a gripping journey of their respective relationships with lots of laughter, drama, and love. This is a show that people in their late teens will relate to more,\n\n5.One Tree Hill:\n\nThis is another show that we 90\u2019s kids grew up on. The initial 4 seasons of the show navigate teenage romances down to its core with the lead cast of Luca, Nathan, Booke, Haley and Peyton. The group tries to juggle basketball, heartbreak, relationships and being single all within the space of a high-school.", "description": "Most of us have grown up idealising Bollywood romances and when we entered high-school the world of romance and crushes grew further as we experienced our first relationships.
