But Ireland has been a key player because of the border issue.\n\nJohnson and Varadkar met at Thornton Manor, a venue more commonly used for luxury weddings than discussing international divorce terms.\n\nTheir talks \"concentrated on the challenges of customs and consent\", their joint statement said.\n\nAfter British MPs rejected the previous \"backstop\" plan to keep the border open, Johnson presented a new proposal last week -- but it received a cold reception in Brussels.\n\nHe proposes Northern Ireland stay aligned to the EU's single market but remain in a separate UK-wide customs territory, envisaging customs but no regulatory checks on the frontier.\n\nNorthern Ireland's opt-in to the plan would be open to four-yearly review by the province's devolved assembly and executive.\n\nBut Brussels is adamant it will not agree to any plan that undermines the single market -- which allows free movement of goods across Europe -- or risks exacerbating tensions on the island of Ireland.\n\nA free-flowing border is considered vital to maintaining peace in Northern Ireland, which was plagued by three decades of violence over British rule, which was largely brought to an end with the 1998 Good Friday peace accords.\n\n- British responsibility -\n\nThursday's talks came after recriminations flew over who was to blame for the impasse, which runs the risk of huge economic disruption on both sides of the Channel if Britain crashes out.\n\nBritain's economy shrank in August, official data showed Thursday, but analysts say a better-than-expected July is expected to help it avoid recession.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron voiced frustration with the issue that has dominated in the bloc since 2016.\n\n\"Brexit is a British domestic crisis, not a European one,\" he said, adding that it was important now to finalise talks and see if there was \"something that I hope could fly\".\n\nBut he added: \"At the very end this is a British responsibility\" on whether it leaves the EU with or without a deal or even cancels the Brexit process outright.\n\nGuy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's Brexit coordinator, meanwhile said Britain's proposals were \"not serious\" and were aimed at starting a \"blame game\".\n\n\"The real traitor is he or she who risks bringing disaster upon his country and it's citizens, pushing the UK out of the EU,\" the former Belgian premier tweeted.\n\nburs-ar/phz/pvh", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar said Thursday they could see a \"pathway\" to reaching a Brexit deal after meeting for last-ditch talks, but remained cautious with just days left to strike an agreement.
