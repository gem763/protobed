Over the next few years, this resolution requires the permanent termination of UN restrictions on Iran\u2019s arms trade, ballistic-missile development, uranium enrichment and plutonium-related work. These are the infamous \u201csunset clauses\u201d built into the deal that lift all the UN\u2019s nuclear and even non-nuclear restrictions on Iran.\n\nIn other words, without action, UNSCR 2231 will soon bulldoze what few speed bumps remain at the international level to slow down the full development and deployment of Iran\u2019s nuclear program and aggression. That was the price Iran demanded when the Obama-Iran nuclear deal was signed \u2014 and the Obama administration was all too willing to comply.\n\nThere is, however, a way to reverse course, prevent international pressure from evaporating forever and restore the restrictions lifted by the deal: the so-called snapback mechanism, which allows any of the original parties of the deal, in effect, to reverse the resolution.", "description": "", "authors": ["Ted Cruz", "Nypost.Com Time-For-Trump-To-Trigger-The-Un-Snapback-On-Iran"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
