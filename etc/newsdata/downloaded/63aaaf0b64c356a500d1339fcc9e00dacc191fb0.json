September was a record month for the Garden State and it shows no signs of slowing down, providing a welcome boost to the state\u2019s budget.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nFootball, both college and the NFL, boosted New Jersey\u2019s gaming industry\u2019s bottom line, with the state registering $445 million in total sports wagering in September. This is tops for a single month for the state, who implemented legalized sports gambling in June 2018 and has seen steady growth since.\n\nLast September's sports wagering handle for New Jersey was $183.9 million.\n\n\u201cWhile operators continue to face strong competition for gaming and leisure customers, the increase in total gaming revenue shows the industry has grown for the betterment of both Atlantic City and New Jersey as a whole,\u201d James Plousis, chairman of the New jersey Casino Control Commission, said.\n\nNew Jersey was the second state to legalize sports betting in June 2018 after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that struck down the federal Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act, known as PASPA, that limited sports betting to Nevada for the last 25 years, according to the USA Today Network.\n\nN.J. Casinos: Sports betting by the numbers Caesars was down 15.7% to $19.3 million Tropicana was down 12.9% to $28.9 million Bally\u2019s was down 10.8% to $15.3 million Resorts was down 5.3% to $15 million Harrah\u2019s was down 2.7% to $26.6 million Borgata was down 2.5% to $65.8 million. The Ocean Casino resort was up 46.9% to $24.2 million Hard Rock was up 20% to $31.8 million Golden Nugget was up 12.7% to $32.3 million.

The expectations have, so far, proved to be true. Within 10 months of legalized sports betting, $2.3 billion in wagers had been made, according to the Associated Press. The rapid growth of sports betting led Gov. Phil Murphy to declare that the Garden State would overtake Nevada in sports betting revenue by 2020.\n\nEncouraging for the state is that $38 million of that total came from sports books in the casinos at Atlantic City and New Jersey\u2019s two racetracks. Both industries had struggled for years but have received a boost over the past year with an influx of sports wagering money flowing in.\n\nOcean, the former Revel casino, had its second-best month in the property\u2019s history, with gambling revenue up 38%, said Michael Donovan, Ocean\u2019s senior vice president and chief marketing officer. He said the casino will report third-quarter property records for both revenues and profits when those figures are released later this year.\n\nRummy Pandit, director of the Lloyd D. Levenson Institute of Gaming, Hospitality & Tourism at Stockton University, just outside Atlantic City, said the city\u2019s revenues \u201ccontinue to show strength, resilience and growth.\u201d\n\nOver the first nine months of this year, sports betting has generated $190.6 million in revenue for the casinos and tracks, compared with just over $40 million in the same period last year, when sports betting was still in its infancy in New Jersey.\n\nIncluding Monmouth Park and the Meadowlands Racetrack, the state\u2019s various outlets won $303 million in September off gaming including sports gambling.\n\nAnd coming off the summer months, the presence of sports gambling helped ease the casinos post-Labor Day.\n\nEven as several casinos posted losses, Atlantic City still saw a \u201c4.1% increase\u201d in revenue from year over last, due to the increased activity at sportsbooks as well as online sports wagering.\n\nSince legalizing sports wagering, New Jersey has reaped the benefits of the state\u2019s appetite for the activity. From June 2018 through this past August, New Jersey has seen a taxable revenue of over $32 million come into their treasury.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nIn June 2018, the state\u2019s total sports gambling handle was $16 million, followed by a climb to $40.6 million the next month.
