USA TODAY\n\nNickelback is getting a boost.\n\nLess than a week after Twitter, citing copyright concerns, removed a video posted by President Donald Trump attacking former Vice President Joe Biden with an edited clip from a Nickelback music video, the Canadian rock band has seen a major spike in online music streams.\n\nThe song \"Photograph,\" featured in Trump's tweet, saw a nearly 40% surge with over 771,000 song listens and music video views between Oct. 2 and Oct. 3, according to Neilsen music data. (Trump tweeted the video at 5 p.m. ET on Oct. 2.) Nielsen analyzes streaming data from services like Spotify, Apple Music and YouTube.\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to representatives for Nickelback for comment.\n\nDigital download sales of the song also rose 569% on Oct. 2 and 3, though that the high percentage only translates into about 1,000 downloads.\n\nJohn Oliver eviscerates Trump over Ukraine saga, mocks Nickelback Twitter flub\n\nOriginally released as a single in September 2005, \"Photograph\" peaked at No. 2 on Billboard's Hot 100 singles list in November 2005.\n\nThe president's now-removed video echoed Trump's unsubstantiated allegations that Biden improperly used his influence in office to benefit his son Hunter. It opened with Biden telling reporters in Iowa, \"I've never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings,\" before cutting to the \"Photograph\" music video clip of Nickelback lead singer Chad Kroeger holding aloft a framed photograph of Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, on an apparent golf outing with two men, one of whom is labeled a \"Ukraine gas exec\" in a video caption.\n\n\"LOOK AT THIS PHOTOGRAPH!\" Trump captioned the tweet, referencing the song's opening line.\n\nContributing: William Cummings, USA TODAY\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2019/10/08/trump-nickelback-tweet-streaming-surge-photograph-song/3906138002/", "description": "Less than a week after Twitter removed President Donald Trump's tweet with a clip from a Nickelback music video, the band is seeing a streaming spike.", "authors": ["Hannah Yasharoff", "Published A.M.
