Rather than inoculate the juice with yeast and bacteria for primary alcoholic and malolactic fermentation, and then add more yeast for the secondary fermentation in the bottle \u2013 common techniques for most sparkling winemakers \u2013 Henskens allowed wild microbes on the fruit and in the winery to do the work themselves.\n\nA consultant told us: For goodness sake, don\u2019t use your own names as the brand name. Particularly not yours, Frieda. \u2014 Frieda Henskens\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s risky,\u201d she says. \u201cBut as long as you\u2019re using sound grapes and nothing goes stinky and the lees aren\u2019t stinky, there\u2019s no reason why it can\u2019t work. One of the most important winemakers to me when I visited Champagne while doing my master\u2019s degree in 2011 was Eric Rodez. He told me, \u2018Every vintage, do crazy things ... carefully.\u2019 I guess that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nDespite trialling adventurous techniques such as wild fermentation, Henskens and Rankin aim to make top-quality, exclusive sparkling wines \u2013 which is precisely what some \u201cexperts\u201d told them not to do.\n\n\u201cWhen we were planning to launch our wines, we talked to a consultant,\u201d says Henskens. \u201cHe told us to drop our price and increase our volume. And he said, \u2018For goodness\u2019 sake, don\u2019t use your own names as the brand name. Particularly not yours, Frieda\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe Effervescence Tasmania festival runs from November 9-17. Rob Burnett\n\nHenskens laughs. Her name comes from her Dutch father, whose roots were in the southern Netherlands, where some sparkling wines are made. So of course she and Rankin put their names on the label.\n\nThey have no intention of increasing volumes, either. They have capped annual production of their Vintage Brut at just 2500 bottles, and have stuck to the plan of charging about $100 a bottle for their wines. (Henskens and Rankin both have day jobs \u2013 she works for another winery, he\u2019s at the Australian Bureau of Statistics, allowing them to not compromise on their brand).\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re selling a luxury product,\u201d says Henskens. \u201cI have no interest in making $35 to $40 sparkling wine. There are already plenty of people doing a good job of that in Tasmania: Brut Elite from Arras, the Pepik that Jeremy Dineen makes at Josef Chromy, among others. The world doesn\u2019t need another one of those.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat the world does need, though, is more small batches of really special, unashamedly top-shelf sparkling wines like those of Henskens Rankin.\n\nNEED TO KNOW\n\nOn Saturday, November 16, Henskens and Rankin will be pouring their wines alongside other top Tasmanian sparkling producers at the Grand Tasting at Josef Chromy Wines near Launceston. The event is part of the sixth annual Effervescence Tasmania festival, taking place at venues across the island state from November 9 to 17. Long winery lunches, vineyard dinners, cellar door tastings, marquee masterclasses and a Bubbles Bar: it\u2019s the ultimate festival for fizz fans.

Delicious. $95\n\nSuperlative bubbles from Henskens Rankin: Vintage Brut, Brute Ros\u00e9, and Triple Wild Blanc de Blancs.\n\n2013 Henskens Rankin Brut Ros\u00e9 [Tasmania]\n\nThis wonderful sparkling ros\u00e9 will get its first public outing at Effervescence Tasmania next month, when it will be poured for festival-goers. Like the Vintage Brut, it\u2019s pure and precise, but it also has subtle creamy texture and a lovely rose-hip tang thanks to the wild primary fermentation in older barrels. $100\n\n2014 Henskens Rankin Triple Wild Blanc de Blancs [Tasmania]\n\nIt\u2019s extremely unusual to find a sparkling wine that has undergone wild primary, secondary and malolactic fermentation, and in extremely limited production: just 200 bottles made. Extremely good, too: candied lemon peel chardonnay fruit flavours, textural and rich, then bone-dry, almost Vegemite-yeasty intensity to the finish. $110\n\nhenskensrankin.com", "description": "They haven\u2019t given up their day jobs, yet.
