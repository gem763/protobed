It would abolish private and employer-based health coverage and replace it with a new, government-run health program.\n\nIts sponsors claim this would reduce administrative costs and produce huge savings. \u201cPrivate insurance companies in this country spend between 12 and 18 percent on administration costs,\u201d says Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. \u201cThe cost of administering the Medicare program\u2026 is 2 percent. We can save approximately $500 billion a year just in administration costs.\u201d\n\nNot so fast. Most independent analysts are reluctant to embrace such bold claims. Glenn Kessler, a fact-checker for The Washington Post warned backers of Medicare for All to be \u201ccautious\u201d in relying on \u201cthe administrative cost saving\u201d as a talking point, and Politifact rated Senator Sanders\u2019 statement as \u201chalf true.\u201d\n\nComparisons between public and private sector administrative costs are tricky. Medicare and private insurance cover radically different populations: Medicare beneficiaries are generally older and sicker than those enrolled in private plans.\n\nBecause Medicare beneficiaries\u2019 utilize medical services at dramatically higher levels, the program\u2019s administrative costs naturally account for a lower percentage of total program spending. However, as Dr. Robert Book, a senior fellow at George Mason University, argues, measuring administrative cost per beneficiary, rather than as a percentage of total spending, shows that Medicare\u2019s administrative cost has been historically higher than private insurance.\n\nMedicare is no model of administrative simplicity. The program is governed by tens of thousands of pages of rules, regulations, guidelines and related paperwork. Its structure, organization, payment and pricing and related rules\u2014including coding, documentation and reporting requirements\u2014are mind-numbingly detailed.\n\nThis morass of bureaucratic complexity imposes high, albeit often hidden, costs, including administrative demands on harried doctors and other medical professionals who must daily comply with the program\u2019s overbearing rules and paperwork under the penalty of law.\n\nThese transactional costs\u2014the mandatory reporting and the time, energy and effort required to satisfy these bureaucratic requirements\u2014are very real. Writing for the Journal of the American Medical Association, researchers report that, for American doctors, \u201c\u2026the time spent on administrative issues related to reporting clinical or quality data to government or other agencies is a major problem.\u201d\n\nYear in and year out, congressional micromanagement adds further to this complexity, as politically powerful interest groups lobby intensely for additions, subtractions, or self-serving modifications of Medicare law and regulation. Like a busy spider, Washington relentlessly multiplies the restrictive strands of its vast web of regulatory control.\n\nMedicare\u2019s bureaucratic structure and regulatory functioning imposes mostly hidden costs on American health care system. They are every bit as real as the overhead costs of private health insurance; they just don\u2019t show up on Medicare\u2019s books.\n\nYet all of this bureaucracy does not render Medicare immune to waste, fraud and abuse, or \u201cimproper payments\u201d to providers.\n\nIn Fiscal Year 2017, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported that improper Medicare payments totaled $52 billion, only $1.4 billion of which was recovered. Last fiscal year 2018, GAO estimated that Medicare racked up another $48.5 billion in improper payments.\n\nMeanwhile, doctors and patients struggle with Medicare\u2019s cumbersome appeals process for months, even years, to get reimbursed for legitimate billings. Once again, these costs of Medicare\u2019s administrative failures are real, but such losses are not counted as administrative costs.\n\nThe congressional champions of \u201cMedicare for All\u201d make another big mistake. They assume \u201cbig\u201d administrative savings from legislation creating, from scratch, an entirely new federal infrastructure, heavily armed with an even greater arsenal of regulatory powers of unprecedented size and scope. Abolishing all private coverage as well as public programs, like Medicare, and starting over, as prescribed under both the House and Senate Medicare for All bills, would be a huge, complicated and costly undertaking.\n\nChampions of government-controlled health care fixate on private health plans\u2019 administrative costs while studiously ignoring the stupendous amount of waste and inefficiency generated by existing government-controlled health programs.\n\nHarvard University Professor Regina Herzlinger says it best. \u201cThe assertion that governmental control of the health sector would lower administrative expenses ignores all other aspects of the health care system, such as quality, convenience and innovation. It assumes that our sole interest is minimizing administrative expenses. But our interests are much more complex: we want excellent, high quality, convenient, consumer-responsive care, delivered at a reasonable price.\u201d\n\nThe fulfillment of these diverse personal needs is what \u201cMedicare for All\u201d will not, and cannot, deliver.", "description": "\u201cMedicare for All\u201d legislation pending in Congress would give Washington\u00a0total control\u00a0over American health care.
