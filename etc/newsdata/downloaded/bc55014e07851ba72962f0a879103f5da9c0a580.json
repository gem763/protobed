The series of talks were hosted by Amanda Parris and Johanna Schneller of The Filmmakers, covering topics from directing to production design\n\nKelley Dixon \u2014 an editor who spent years working on Breaking Bad and its spinoff Better Call Saul \u2014 sat on the picture editors panel and spoke candidly about her craft and the experience of editing her first feature film The Goldfinch, which had its premiere at TIFF before opening in theatres this past weekend.\n\nHere's what Dixon had to say.\n\nPainting with 'everyone else's art'\n\nBreaking Bad and Better Call Saul editor Kelley Dixon discusses the art of editing and working with John Crowley on The Goldfinch.

By the time Dixon starts her process, the filming is complete. Most of the team has already done their jobs and she is very respectful of this aspect.\n\n\"I'm here to help my director make the movie he wants to make. He is not here to make the movie I want him to make.\"\n\nWorking with John Crowley, director of The Goldfinch\n\nJohn Crowley speaks onstage during the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival Tribute Gala at The Fairmont Royal York Hotel in Toronto. (Getty Images for TIFF)\n\nWhile working on The Goldfinch, Dixon said she spent most of her days with director John Crowley engrossed in \"two or three hours of conversation\" before cutting scenes. \"He is so on top of the narrative and this is a very very dense narrative.\"\n\nThe Goldfinch follows 13-year-old Theo Decker, who survives a bombing that kills his mother, through to an adulthood of addiction, grief and the criminal underworld of art forgery.\n\nBut making the film came with its challenges and Dixon and Crowley didn't always see eye to eye.\n\nTo resolve matters and to make sure both herself and the director were aligned, Dixon would ask pointed questions like: \"What do you think the main character feels at this point?\" or \"Where do you think his head is at?\"\n\nThis allowed for critical conversation where Dixon could present her experience of the scenes, so her and Crowley could finally come together. \"We would really talk it through,\" she said.\n\nLook out for more highlights from our TIFF panel discussions coming later this week.", "description": "During a picture editing panel at TIFF, Dixon talked about her work on the Donna Tartt adaptation.", "authors": ["Cbc Arts"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5283216.1568650517!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/kelley-dixon.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
