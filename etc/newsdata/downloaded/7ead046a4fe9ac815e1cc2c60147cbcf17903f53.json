Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has been in contact with radical leftist and failed gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum (D), sparking rumors that the presidential hopeful is considering him as a potential running mate.\n\nWarren has been in contact with Gillum \u2014 the radical leftist who lost Florida\u2019s gubernatorial race to Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) last fall \u2014 according to the Daily Beast:\n\nAnd for several candidates, including at least one in the top tier, former Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum is on speed dial. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), in particular, has been in contact with Gillum over the past several months, multiple knowledgeable sources told The Daily Beast.\n\nWhile the Warren campaign says that the vice presidential rumors are \u201cbaseless and not at all true,\u201d sources who spoke to the Daily Beast said that their relationship is reminiscent of the search process a candidate typically goes through in order to find the right running mate:\n\nOne source briefed on the communications said the two Democrats have been in contact over the course of the campaign and that there is a \u201cstrong impression\u201d that Gillum is a possible vice presidential contender for Warren, who has risen in recent months to become a frontrunner in the 2020 primary, the source said. \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to win Florida, I would be courting Andrew and that\u2019s what\u2019s happening,\u201d a second source familiar with the conversations said.\n\nGillum rose to the national spotlight after challenging DeSantis in Florida\u2019s close gubernatorial race last year, earning the support of celebrities like pop sensation Rihanna and rap star Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs. Despite a strong backing from Hollywood, Gillum lost. DeSantis narrowly squeaked out a win in the Sunshine State, besting Gillum by less than half a percentage point, or less than 325,000 votes.\n\nGillum largely campaigned on many of the far-left\u2019s go-to narratives, such as Medicare for All, gun control, and increased taxation \u2014 three issues that particularly resonate with Warren.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported in July, Gillum is utilizing his private non-profit in an effort to register 1 million voters and ultimately flip Florida blue. His use of the private non-proft is of interest, as Gillum previously decried the use of \u201cdark money\u201d in politics. By using his private non-profit for such an effort, he can \u201ccan disclose much less financial data, including the sources of donations\u201d:\n\nGillum\u2019s use of the nonprofit, calling itself Forward Florida Action, is notable given the Florida politician\u2019s warning last February about the influence of \u201cdark money\u201d in his own race for governor, referring to entities that obscure their donors. Gillum is deploying his nonprofit for the voter registration drive instead of utilizing his political committee, Forward Florida. \u2026 The change came after the Tampa Bay Timesreported in May that the FBI had subpoenaed records related to his 2018 gubernatorial campaign. This after Gillum\u2019s time as Tallahassee mayor was tied to an FBI probe into city hall corruption, a federal investigation that involved undercover FBI agents going on trips with Gillum.\n\nLike Warren, Gillum has called for Trump\u2019s impeachment and has remained a voice for the far-left flank of the Democrat Party.\n\nGillum subtly addressed the reports of his conversations with Warren in a tweet on Thursday.\n\n\u201cMany of my friends running to beat @realDonaldTrump call me often \u2014 about one thing: how to win Florida,\u201d he wrote, plugging his voter registration drive:", "description": "Sen.
