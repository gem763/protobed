The bet included Dustin Martin (left) winning the Norm Smith Medal and Jeremy Cameron (right) the Coleman Medal\n\nMr Clemente claimed he had contacted BetEasy twice to confirm his bet was valid before he placed it.\n\n'Twice they said 'yes, 100 per cent. So I phoned my best friend and said 'This is great value. Get on,' he told the publication.\n\nMaking matters worse for Mr Clemente, his friend was paid out his full prize money of $5005 on a $101 bet using the same betting agency.\n\n'The only thing I can think of is that his payout would have been more. It\u2019s exactly the same bet, made on the same day and the odds are exactly the same,' he said.\n\nMr Clemente is now reportedly considering legal action.\n\nDaily Mail Australia contacted BetEasy whose spokesman declined to comment.\n\nAccording to the terms and conditions set out by BetEasy they 'reserve the right to void and refund a bet if legs are related in a multi bet\u2019.\n\nThe same terms and conditions state the maximum payout for a multi bet on a racing, a sporting event or a combination of both is $250,000.\n\nAfter all three bets came through at the close of the AFL Grand Final (above), the punter stood to win $10,112 from his $204.06 bet with BetEasy", "description": "Melbourne man Adrian Clemente had placed a multi-leg bet on Richmond to win the AFL Grand Final, Dustin Martin to win the Norm Smith Medal and Jeremy Cameron to win the Coleman Medal.", "authors": ["Adam Mccleery For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/00/19969400-0-image-a-11_1571612416891.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
