(CannabCo), a Canadian company located in Brampton, Ontario , is pleased to announce its intent to expand on production and product offerings resulting from the overwhelming interest received on deployment of the PURECANN\u2122 technology. Less than a month ago, CannabCo announced PURECANN, the technology responsible for the production of Odourless Cannabis\u2122, a global cannabis first, and since that time, PURECANN has seemingly created a new market segment in the industry.\n\nOriginally developed for the medical market and dubbed \"PURECANN\", the technology was designed to eliminate much of the harshness of smoking cannabis by consumers without losing any of its properties. \"Since the time of the announcement, the response has been overwhelming\", said President & CEO Mark Pellicane , \"Within hours of the announcement we were inundated with public inquiries.\"\n\nNumerous products exist to control cannabis odour both during the production process and aftermarket. \"No one thought to eliminate the odour at the source, the product itself,\" said Pellicane, \"we did this with the deployment of PURECANN.\"\n\nCannabCo has since been featured in multiple live interviews, and press coverage ranging from cannabis specific publications to seemingly unrelated market segments such as publications for the cottage industry. \"Everyone wants to know the impact of this technology on different market segments both social, and business related,\" said Pellicane, \"in virtually all cases, the underlying theme was the positive aspect of the elimination of the cannabis smell associated with people using the product.\" Pellicane further goes on to state that the company has created an entirely new market segment addressing what some consider a fundamental issue surrounding cannabis users, the odour.\n\n\"There is no question that there exists a huge demand for odourless products beyond the standard combustion of dry bud,\" said Mark Novak , COO of CannabCo, \"We are currently exploring numerous products both consumable, and non-consumable which will be produced from the manufacturing facility using PURECANN as the base technology.\"\n\nCannabCo is currently raising capital through an in-house non-brokered private placement. The company is constructing its pilot facility in Brampton, Ontario , and has received a Confirmation of Readiness notification from Health Canada for their pending cannabis license.\n\nCannabCo further intends to pursue a Canadian public listing targeting Q1-Q2 of 2020 and management has retained legal securities council to this effect. The company is currently using MNP for audit purposes.\n\nAbout PURECANN\n\nPURECANN is a technology under the exclusive right to use by CannabCo for the production of Odourless Cannabis\u2122. The process is EU GMP compliant and is designed to produce cannabis product with the following characteristics:\n\nVirtually undetectable odour of dry product during storage\n\nGreatly reduced cannabis odor (virtually undetectable) during combustion\n\nReduces harshness resulting in a very smooth smoke on combustion\n\nMay be used to produce a \"connoisseur\" product for a unique market segment\n\nLess residual heavy feeling \"day after effect\" associated with smoking cannabis\n\n\n\n\n\nUpon receiving its license from Health Canada, CannabCo will have exclusive rights to deploy the technology for use in its Canadian production.\n\nAbout CannabCo Pharmaceutical Corp.\n\nCannabCo Pharmaceutical Corp. is a Canadian based full service cannabis company with operations in Brampton, Ontario . The company has received its \"Confirmation of Readiness\" from Health Canada to become a licensed producer and is currently building out its pilot facility in the Brampton Area .
