for a third time in as many appearances after controlling the opening third of the 61-lap race from pole position.\n\nBut the race turned on its head when Ferrari stopped Vettel for tyres first. Leclerc came in a lap later, but Vettel had taken advantage of his new rubber to leapfrog his team-mate.\n\nNaturally, the move by Ferrari angered Leclerc. \"To be completely honest with you I don't understand the undercut,\" he moaned over the radio. \"We will discuss after the race,\" Leclerc added.\n\nOver at Mercedes, the world champions decided to keep Hamilton on track as their rivals changed tyres, but the 34-year-old was rapidly losing time on worn rubber.\n\nHamilton was soon in no-man's land, and when he did eventually stop, six laps later than Leclerc and seven laps later than Vettel, the Briton re-joined the race behind both Ferrari cars and Verstappen, too. Indeed, Hamilton only stayed ahead of Bottas for fourth position after Mercedes ordered the Finn to slow down.", "description": "Sebastian Vettel ended his 22-race losing streak by controversially beating Ferrari teammate Charles Leclerc to victory at the Singapore Grand Prix.
