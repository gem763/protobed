Border Patrol agents cared for the small child until officials with Health and Human Services\u2019 Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) arrived.\n\nEarly last week, HSI agents identified a child being smuggled with two adults falsely claiming to be the child\u2019s parents, according to Del Rio Sector Border Patrol officials. The two adults crossed the border with the small child and claimed to be a family unit. HSI agents conducted an investigation which concluded the adults had no familial relation to the child.\n\n\u201cHSI\u2019s message is clear \u2013 our priority is to protect the children,\u201d Shane Folden, Special Agent in Charge, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) San Antonio said in a written statement. \u201cHSI will continue to partner with the Border Patrol to identify and dismantle the criminal organizations using fraud to smuggle children.\u201d\n\nBorder Patrol agents took care of the child for three shifts until ORR officials arrived. The agents provided care and comfort for the migrant child for nearly 24 hours, officials stated.\n\nOfficials did not report how the foreign couple came into possession of the child. ICE officials previously told Breitbart Texas that smugglers will often rent or buy children from parents to move their human cargo more easily into the U.S. In some cases, children are kidnapped. Officials have also observed children being \u201crecycled\u201d through the smuggling process.\n\n\u201cOf all the people that smugglers exploit, children are the most vulnerable,\u201d Del Rio Sector Chief Patrol Agent Raul L. Ortiz added. \u201cThanks to the cooperative efforts between HSI and Border Patrol, this child was removed from a dangerous situation and properly cared for.\u201d\n\nOfficials have not yet identified the true parents of the migrant child. Officials arrested the couple who attempted to smuggle the child pending federal charges related to smuggling and immigration violations.", "description": "U.S. Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) agents identified a migrant child being smuggled in what they call a fraudulent family unit.", "authors": ["Bob Price"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/06/migrant-girl-CBP-truck-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
