Emma was having an affair with Jerry (Charlie Cox), who is married to the unseen Judith. And now Emma is having an affair with Casey, also unseen, a writer for whom Jerry is an agent and whom Robert publishes.\n\nJust as Lionel Stander\u2019s Max said at the beginning of every episode of Hart To Hart, \u201cAnd when they met, it was moiiider.\u201d\n\nBetrayal, which Harold Pinter wrote in 1978, begins at the end; it is one of those stories\u2014like Stephen Sondheim\u2019s Merrily We Roll Along, which will soon become a film to be shot over a 20-year period by Richard Linklater\u2014where reverse chronology is used to reveal characters and their pasts.\n\nEverything in Jamie Lloyd\u2019s hit London-transfer production at the Bernard B. Jacobs Theatre, which opened tonight (to December 8) unpeels\u2014motivations, lies, moments of revelation, passion, antipathy, lust, love, guilt, and how this trio got where they are.\n\nBy the end, which is the beginning, we have come an imperfect circle. And there is always the missing, unseen Judith, whose absence\u2014to me at least\u2014signals this is more a play about men and their relationships, than the women in their lives.\n\nIts source is a real-life scandal involving Pinter himself, who for many years had a love affair with Joan Bakewell, a British TV personality once known as \u201cthe thinking man\u2019s crumpet,\u201d on the sexist basis that she was best-known for covering high-minded topics on television while being attractive. (As the years went by, \u201cthe thinking woman\u2019s crumpet\u201d was coined for men of a similar ilk.)\n\nAt the time of their affair, both Pinter and Bakewell were married to other people (it was confirmed later by both parties), and while Pinter was writing the play he was having an affair with Antonia Fraser, who later became his wife. Really, it was a very high-class literati version of The Young and The Restless.\n\n\u201c You remember the form. I ask about your husband, you ask about my wife \u201d\n\nHere, the end is 1977, and Emma and Jerry are meeting up, nervously, two years after their affair of seven years ended. Emma reveals she has told Robert about their affair (little knowing Robert has known for years). It\u2019s all very polite, with an undercurrent of exhaustion: so much has happened by now, and they are two people who know each other too well for the pleasantries they cannot go beyond. As Jerry says: \u201cYou remember the form. I ask about your husband, you ask about my wife.\u201d\n\nBut there are landmines still, such as the age of Emma\u2019s 5-year-old son, Ned, the timing of whose conception caused panic at the time (as we discover later in the play). And Jerry is terrified at Robert knowing everything (even though he has for some time).\n\nThe play is full of these landmines, and slippages in what people know, and what other people think they know. The play\u2019s expansive speeches are few; mostly this is fast, glancing verbal tennis, digs, jabs, snarks, jokes, discoveries, and loaded silences. The tall Hiddleston looms over both Ashton and Cox; he has both a menace and a befuddled grace.\n\nWhen Robert discovers the truth about the affair, it seems as if he may commit acts of violence; first against his wife and then against his best friend. But he holds her tight, and then subjects Jerry to a fraught lunch, scything at the food on his plate\u2014prosciutto, melon, fried scampi and spinach, and a swimming pool-quantity of white wine\u2014in a fury which Jerry thinks is just about a frustrating boat trip.\n\nThat moment comes in a part of Betrayal where, though the play is going backwards (here to 1973), it also goes forward in two follow-up scenes that year. So, we first see Robert discover the affair, and then two further scenes unfold with Emma and Jerry in the flat they maintain for their afternoon hook-ups; and then that weird lunch between the two men, with Robert knowing everything and Jerry not knowing he knows.\n\nPinter\u2014and the brilliant trio of actors here\u2014treat this uneasy dance as a particularly British game, where everyone is terrifically polite and sporting when they should be shouting, screaming and throwing suitcases out of windows. Instead, here a life-changing revelation is followed by a clipped inquiry into favorite books and summer holiday destinations.\n\n\u201c I mean a game of squash isn\u2019t simply a game of squash, it\u2019s rather more than that \u201d\n\nThere are real feelings and real peril here, but the men are more concerned about not playing squash, ever. Why can\u2019t they? The men are competing, for what? Emma? (No, Jerry is mortified at damaging his friend\u2019s marriage.) Literary glory, or at least cold, hard profit through Casey? To impress the other? To ace the other? Maybe all of that.\n\n\u201c I mean a game of squash isn\u2019t simply a game of squash, it\u2019s rather more than that,\u201d says Robert. \u201cYou see, first there\u2019s the game. And then there\u2019s the shower. And then there\u2019s the pint. And then there\u2019s lunch. After all, you\u2019ve been at it. You\u2019ve had your battle. What you want is your pint and your lunch. You really don\u2019t want a woman buying you lunch.\u201d\n\nAshton is excellent as Emma\u2014not willing to be either man\u2019s easy adjunct, while questioning both relationships and their practiced duplicities\u2014but Pinter does not seem as confident exploring why she does what she does, or what she feels, as he does toying with the boundaries and frailties of Jerry and Robert. The relationship-in-peril is Hiddleston and Cox\u2019s. The squash game is their own long-deferred marital bed.\n\nThanks to Soutra Gilmour\u2019s stunningly spartan scenic design and Jon Clark\u2019s lighting there is a beautiful play of shadows on the walls of the characters, and because those shadows of bodies have their own physicality and relationship to one another, the emotional dance gains another perspective and depth.\n\nThe \u201cbetrayal\u201d is not just between husbands and wives, but between the two male best friends\u2014and Hiddleston and Cox bring a gruff, uneasy humor and a real sense of pain to the recognition of lifelong loyalties being sullied. There is a strong hint, not overplayed, of an actual attraction between these two supposedly straight men; could the real betrayal be that they are not together?\n\nThat could be over-reach, but there is certainly a beautiful, open elegance to Lloyd\u2019s production that echoes its three supremely fine performances and a reading of the text that pinpoints all of Pinter\u2019s wit, wordplay, and mordancy, while leaving a lovely breadth of interpretation open to the audience. We hear of the past joy of a child being thrown in the air; later in the play we see it.\n\nThere are spinning turntables, which send characters backwards in time. Apart from the odd chair, there is no real furniture. If one of the actors isn\u2019t in a scene, they stay on stage. They don\u2019t do anything as cheesy as react to things they cannot hear, but their expressions and sense of distance add to the scene. Eddie Arnold as an Italian waiter has the toughest job on stage\u2014to bring some simple levity to the brooding drama. And he does it adeptly, looking askance, as we do, at the men he is serving.\n\nFinally, we go back to 1968, to Jerry and Emma\u2019s first kiss, to Robert not knowing anything, yet all three of them yoked together. Their arms knotted around each other\u2019s shoulders, one senses\u2014hopelessly\u2014they will never be separated. Right at the end\u2014really, right at the beginning\u2014this doesn\u2019t look like friendship or love, but a bruising, suffocating scrum.", "description": "Tom Hiddleston, Zawe Ashton, and Charlie Cox excel in the brilliant Broadway revival of Harold Pinter\u2019s play, which tells the story of an affair revealingly in reverse.", "authors": ["Tim Teeman", "Senior Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567731409/190905-Teeman-Betrayal-tease_eujovk", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
