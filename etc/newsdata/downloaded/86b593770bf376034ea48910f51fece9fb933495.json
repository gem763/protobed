If Klopp was in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's position, the German maintains he would use such a slight on his squad to his own advantage.\n\nJurgen Klopp believes recent criticism of Manchester United has bordered on insulting\n\nLiverpool's manager, who has Alisson Becker for the first time since the opening day of the season, spoke at great length about United's qualities and is adamant they are in a false position. Klopp is paying no attention to the table and is conscious of the threat his side will face.\n\n'I saw all these things and it looks like they want to help Manchester United,' said Klopp. 'All these articles look like they have been written by Man Utd supporters. So yes, that's it. We'll live with it. In the dressing room, that's the one advantage they have at the moment - and playing at home.\n\n'It's like we would have said it: \"Here's the combined team!\" But we had nothing to do it and that's how it has been built up. It's not the first time in my life that things like this have happened to me or my team. I said people are trying to create it as a banana skin.\n\n'They are trying to make it as if we are the team and they are nobody. I saw the combined line-up and it's really funny... 11 Liverpool players and no Man Utd players! That is the situation everyone creates.'\n\nIf Klopp was in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's position, the German says he would use such a slight\n\nKlopp added: 'We have to make sure we are the better side. That's what you try to do. This week I had a little look at newspapers because I expected things like that but then I was still surprised it was that massive difference. We need to respect them to face the difficulties in the game.'\n\nThe trip to Old Trafford starts a period in which Liverpool will play a minimum of 18 matches in all competitions before December 31 and Klopp has ridiculed the idea that his side have been given extra assistance in their quest to become champions by TV broadcasters.\n\n'We have a game more in December than City - how can we have an advantage?' said Klopp. 'If you ask me about December, where can we fit in an extra game? It's not possible, but we did it somehow because we have to, because we go to Qatar and play in the FIFA Club World Cup.\n\n'I am completely on City's side that these games where they have 46 hours between, they should not happen. It's like when we played Sunderland, it's just not okay. That was in 2016, and three years later we are still speaking about it and nothing has changed. We still have it.'", "description": "DOMINIC KING: Jurgen Klopp believes criticism of Manchester United has bordered on insulting and says they have been given every motivation to end Liverpool's unblemished start.", "authors": ["Dominic King For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/21/19902550-0-image-a-24_1571430672326.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
