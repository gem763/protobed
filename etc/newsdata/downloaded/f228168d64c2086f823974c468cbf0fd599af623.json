He spoke great English and didn\u2019t look more than 30 years old.\n\nAs we approached a massive, eleven-story, Soviet building we passed stretches of barbed wire with old tires and various construction materials piled up behind them. I saw a poster that read: \u201cThe Mexican\u2019s League\u201d in orange letters. This was his barricade.\n\nOn March 3, a couple hundred pro-Russian demonstrators stormed the Donetsk regional government building after clashing with police who were guarding the main entrance. They successfully entered through a side door, and in the end made it to the second floor where the parliament sits. Unrest continued to spiral in Ukraine and the following month separatists declared a \u201cPeople\u2019s Republic of Donetsk\u201d.\n\nThe confrontation began because the local population, made up mainly of Russian-speakers, seek less influence from Kiev over their region. Kiev and the West have accused Russia of being behind the upheaval, Moscow denies it. Now, two months after the initial attacks, demonstrators are inside the regional government buildings and masked men stand at the barricades.\n\nWolf waved to a man posted behind the tires, and he opened up a small, improvised door for us on the north barricade. Stacked boards, beaten-up chairs and bricks lay all around us. The whole place reeked of soot and burning metal which seemed to have been used to keep men on the barricade warm.\n\nA few of the masked men waved to Wolf and me. It was a bit intimidating. We passed through a glass door, then entered a big marble hallway with a high ceiling. It was filled with stale air and an unusual silence.\n\nAbout 15 people looked in my direction as we entered. Some were just sitting, others sat behind computers that they themselves must have brought. Others walked around or just drank tea. At the end of the hallway stood the only one who wasn\u2019t wearing a mask. He had a green military jumpsuit unbuttoned to the chest, beneath which protruded a blue-and-white striped shirt. His hair was tied in a ponytail and he had a smile on his face.\n\n\u201cHello, I am the Mexican, you are welcome among us!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you don\u2019t wear a mask. And why do they call you the Mexican?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cI spent some time living in Portugal, but people here didn\u2019t understand that well where I was, and as such, I became the Mexican,\u201d he smiled. \u201cAnd as far as the mask is concerned, I haven\u2019t got anything to fear.\u201d\n\nWolf had explained to him earlier that I was a photojournalist and that I had asked to take a series of portraits of people who man the barricades. The Mexican seemed to have nothing against it.\n\n\u201cHow would you like to take our pictures?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t know. I thought I\u2019d look at the space first and check out some fitting background\u2026\u201d I hadn\u2019t finished my sentence when I saw a massive chair underneath a neon light.\n\n\u201cHere, we could sit over here, one by one. I think that would look nice.\u201d\n\nI picked my lens, adjusted the light, and people began to pose in shifts. Each subject was relaxed, and struck whatever pose suited him. That suited me too.\n\nWhile I was taking pictures I spoke with the Mexican, and Wolf continued to translate.\n\n\u201cYou are asking what we want and what we are fighting for? To live like the rest of the normal world and for our basic human rights.\n\n\u201cHere, these people you are photographing, among them is a history teacher, one has a PhD in electrical engineering, a third works in an international company, and we have blacksmiths, miners, economists\u2026 Normal people who woke up and began to rebel.\u201d\n\n\u201cAgainst what?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cAgainst the imposition of other people\u2019s will, against the growing fascism in the West of the country, and we are fighting for\u2026\u201d\n\nHere Wolf chimed in himself: \u201cWe are fighting for democracy, despite the fact that that is a word we don\u2019t like because it is so much used by the demonstrators in Kiev, on Maidan. But yes, for democracy, for a referendum.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd how will you vote in the referendum?\u201d I asked again.\n\n\u201cEveryone will vote however they want, some for federalisation, some for a republic, some for joining Russia, but the point is that we have the right to decide for ourselves,\u201d added the Mexican.\n\nI just had a few more people to photograph, and then I would be finished. A man with a dog sat down and the shot I got of him was one of my favourites. The big black dog looked dangerous, and he stared straight into the camera. Later I petted him and he turned into a sweet animal who only wanted a cuddle.\n\nWe continued speaking and I was interested in what they would do if the police or army attacked them in an attempt to re-take the building. They told me they were unarmed and that if the riot police attacked, they would fight til the end. But if the military came with weapons, they would probably withdraw.\n\nI photographed the last of the group, and then I began to show them the pictures on my camera display. They laughed and joked with one another in Russian.\n\nLater, they asked with interest how people in Europe see the situation in Ukraine and whether or not they know what is really happening. They wanted to know if anyone supports them, and what will happen in the end. They seemed a bit scared.\n\nI didn\u2019t have a good answer to their last question.", "description": "Towns and cities across Ukraine's industrial east have fallen to pro-Russian separatists over the past month in an armed uprising that Ukraine says is orchestrated by Russia - a charge Moscow denies.", "authors": ["Marko Djurica"], "top_image": "https://photos.wi.gcs.trstatic.net/WBTnOVC7qqta06gXHeKsQ2ogp7RX6TJRCWWTcY09wvMr309AlUyCpiKHRqu7EUkox9gbrXO31IDfLC4ZEPiaxH-hoB7N7ggiQs5i36VB4ubCBZceYLGI5zko3vhPCU1V", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
