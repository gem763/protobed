And as a retiree, the eight-times Grand Slam champion would rather not try himself.\n\nTennis - Australian Open - Fourth Round - Melbourne Park, Melbourne, Australia, January 20, 2019. Andre Agassi, coach of Bulgaria's Grigor Dimitrov, watches Dimitrov's match against Frances Tiafoe of the U.S. REUTERS/Edgar Su\n\nReflecting on his career on Saturday, at the Longines Global Champions Tour in New York, Agassi said the game today had simply changed too much for him to find an analog among the sport\u2019s current top performers.\n\n\u201cThe truth is, some of them do what I did \u2013 but they do other things too,\u201d said Agassi, pointing to reigning Wimbledon champ Novak Djokovic as someone \u201cwho can take the ball early and redirect pace or control points from the middle of the court,\u201d but also brings an added defensive edge.\n\n\u201cThese guys, they can do everything I did on a return, except they have even a little more coverage.\n\n\u201cWhen I was really at my best, it was a risk to play aggressive ... (today) people play aggressive.\u201d\n\nHaving shifted his post-tennis career toward business and philanthropy, Agassi appeared on Saturday as the appointed \u201cambassador of elegance\u201d for the luxury watch-maker Longines, the title partner of the competition, with which he has formed a kind of symbiotic relationship.\n\nMost notably the former world No. 1, who described his exit from tennis as \u201clike Christmas,\u201d said the partnership helps him pursue the cause of youth education.\n\n\u201cIt seems to push my buttons,\u201d said Agassi, talking with passion about the latest advancements in technology for childhood literacy.\n\nBut he acknowledged moving from the pro sport isn\u2019t quite so simple for everyone.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if you can prepare somebody for it because it all depends on what it\u2019s meant to them and how much of their identity is tied up in it,\u201d said Agassi. \u201cWhen you do something for the first third of your life and then you have two thirds of your life to go, it can be a tough transition.\u201d\n\nHe heaped praise on Russia\u2019s Daniil Medvedev, this year\u2019s U.S. Open villain turned unlikely hero who gave eventual champ Rafa Nadal a run for his money in a five-set final thriller.\n\n\u201cA guy like that stays healthy, he\u2019s probably the best 6\u20196\u201d mover we\u2019ve ever seen in tennis,\u201d Agassi said of the 23-year-old. \u201cHe knows when to press, when to put a little urgency into your game and he knows when to sort of let you implode.\n\n\u201cHis tennis IQ is really high, his offensive skill set is there, his defensive skill set is there. So he\u2019s got everyone\u2019s attention.\u201d", "description": "As a tennis player, Andre Agassi defied comparison.
