Although the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee paid a foreigner to pay other foreigners to investigate the Trump campaign (the Steele Dossier), although four Democrat senators actually did threaten to withhold U.S. aid if Ukraine refused to dig up dirt on Trump, all of a sudden Chuck Todd doesn\u2019t like the idea of foreigners investigating Americans. And to prove it, he figuratively ripped off his clothes, lit his hair on fire, and ran screaming around the room about the death of democracy:\n\nI don\u2019t say this lightly. Let\u2019s be frank: a national nightmare is upon us. The basic rules of our democracy are under attack from the president. We begin tonight with a series of admissions by the president that all but ensure his impeachment in the House of Representatives. It\u2019s a moment of truth for Republicans, and they have been largely silent on what we have seen from the president. Today, he publicly called on two foreign governments to interfere in the presidential election by investigating his chief 2020 political rival. \u2026 This is arguably a national emergency. The Founding Fathers would consider it a national emergency if the president publicly lobbied multiple foreign governments to interfere in the next election.\n\nYou can pile every Bette Davis movie on top of every Joan Crawford movie and not come up with that much melodrama.\n\nBut just when you thought Todd could not lose any more of his composure, he then goes on the air to brag about how he has decided to suppress the news, how he has decided to hide news from his viewers, as though such a thing is a virtue.\n\nWatch the whole smug thing; it\u2019s unbelievable:\n\nWATCH: The president held a campaign rally last night and attacked Hunter Biden. We cannot in good conscience show it to you @chucktodd: \u201cPolitics ain\u2019t beanbag, but it isn\u2019t supposed to be this either. We all need to play a role in not rewarding this kind of politics\u201d pic.twitter.com/ERPk4SJ0Yf \u2014 Meet the Press (@MeetThePress) October 11, 2019\n\n\u201cSo we are going further than we\u2019ve ever gone before to say we aren\u2019t going to play the sound,\u201d Todd smugly confesses, adding:\n\nWe aren\u2019t going to repeat the president\u2019s vicious attacks on Hunter Biden. The President of the United States stood in front of a crowd of supporters and character assassinated a man who \u2014 whatever you might think of his decisions \u2014 is not a public figure, he isn\u2019t running for office, and he\u2019s not a campaign surrogate. He\u2019s not even on the campaign trail, and he isn\u2019t in any way asking for this attention, obviously.\n\nIs that not the biggest load of bullshit ever, and I do mean ever\u2026\n\nSo all of a sudden, if you are \u201conly\u201d a businessman who flew around the world on the vice president\u2019s airplane to cut sweet, foreign business deals for yourself, you are an untouchable private citizen the media won\u2019t ever report on? No matter how shady the deals? No matter how much the vice president\u2019s influence was involved, you are off-limits to media reporting?\n\nReally, Chuck?\n\nReally, that\u2019s the New Standard, those are the New Rules \u2014 that it is now off-limits to report on any businessman who profits from political relationships\u2026?\n\nMy God, what a liar.\n\nSo what we have here is a purported NEWSman admitting he is hiding NEWS from the public, and not just any NEWS, but words spoken by the most consequential figure in the world: the President of the United States.\n\nHere\u2019s the bottom line\u2026 Chuck Todd is so insecure, he attacks the president, but he won\u2019t let us hear what he is attacking the president for.\n\nThis is not the behavior of a NEWSman; it is the behavior of a propagandist, a corporate-funded fascist.\n\nThe job of a NEWSman is to REPORT the NEWS, is to gather and disseminate the NEWS. Certainly, Todd can choose what NEWS he thinks is important, what NEWS he believes is relevant, and choose not to share the NEWS he finds irrelevant and unimportant, but that is not what he did here.\n\nObviously, Todd believes what Trump said about the crooked Biden family is relevant, so relevant he not only chose to hide it; he perverted every known journalistic ethic and guideline to brag about what a virtuous NEWSman he is for hiding NEWS.\n\nIf this is what Todd admits to hiding, imagine what he doesn\u2019t admit to hiding\u2026\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.
