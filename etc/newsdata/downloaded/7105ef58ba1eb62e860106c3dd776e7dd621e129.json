It will encrypt and funnel all Firefox website connections through a collection of remote proxy servers, safeguarding the user's traffic from third-party interception and anonymizing the user's true location.\n\nThe proxy servers at the base of Firefox's new VPN service will be provided by Cloudflare. \"Their strong privacy controls limit what data they collect and how long they keep it,\" Mozilla said.\n\nOnce installed, the extension will add a toggle on the Firefox toolbar for enabling or disabling the VPN feature.\n\nImage: Mozilla\n\nAnnounced back in June\n\nWhile in beta, access to the Firefox Private Network will be free for all testers. The service is expected to become Mozilla's first commercial offering, said Mozilla CEO Chris Beard back in June.\n\nMozilla has been looking in recent years at different methods of diversifying its revenue stream, which primarily consists of the organization's Google search deal.\n\nAs part of the efforts to expand its revenues, Mozilla ran a limited partnership last year with ProtonVPN, a provider of VPN software.\n\nSelected Firefox users were able to purchase a ProtonVPN version for $10/month, under its normal market price at the time. The experiment ran only a few months, and Mozilla received a part of the revenue from the ProtonVPN subscriptions.", "description": "New Firefox VPN extension expected to become Mozilla's first commercial service.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/10/ecc11c36-164c-4e01-8c78-f753c01bb420/thumbnail/770x578/fbd63ef92e6946f4b8284d2ede04a8b6/firefox-vpn.png", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
