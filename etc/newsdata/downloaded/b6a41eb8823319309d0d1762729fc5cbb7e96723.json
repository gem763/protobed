President Trump invited the Taliban to Camp David, for the purpose of consummating the negotiations that had been going on between the two parties (us and the Taliban). He rescinded the invitation at the last minute, however. Reason: The Taliban killed an American, along with eleven others, in one of their bombings. Yet, as Ryan Crocker points out, they had been killing Americans all along \u2014 all through the negotiations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPersonally, I was revolted by the thought of the Taliban at Camp David. All that blood on their hands, including a lot of American blood. But then I thought, \u201cWell, Arafat was at Camp David. Maybe I am being too pure.\u201d Crocker, too, was revolted. And there is a big difference, he says, between Arafat and the PLO, on one hand, and the Taliban on the other. We required Arafat to renounce terrorism and recognize the right of Israel to exist, without qualification. (His sincerity is another question.) From the Taliban, we did not even demand a cease-fire.\n\nRyan Crocker was our man in the Middle East \u2014 one of our main people \u2014 for many years. He is now a diplomat-in-residence at Princeton University. He served as ambassador to Lebanon, Kuwait, Syria, Pakistan, Iraq, and Afghanistan. Garden spots were not for him: no Luxembourg, no Barbados. Three of his ambassadorships were under Republican presidents, and three under Democratic ones.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow did he get mixed up with the Middle East (broadly defined)?\n\nHis father was a career Air Force officer. The family lived in several countries, including Turkey, where Crocker graduated from high school. Between his junior and senior years of college, he \u201chad a chance to hitchhike from Amsterdam to Calcutta,\u201d as he says. That was in 1970. \u201cIt took the whole summer and it nearly killed me,\u201d but it was a wonderful experience. He found the Middle Eastern lands the most alluring. And when he joined the Foreign Service, that\u2019s where he wanted to go.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn January 2009, in the last days of his presidency, George W. Bush hung the Presidential Medal of Freedom around Crocker\u2019s neck. Bush quoted General David Petraeus, who had said, \u201cIt was a great honor for me to be his military wingman\u201d \u2014 meaning Crocker\u2019s. In 2012, after Crocker had stepped down as ambassador to Afghanistan, the U.S. Marine Corps made him an honorary Marine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCrocker is deeply worried about a U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan and the return of the Taliban to power. This is putting it mildly.\n\nHe takes me back to 2001 \u2014 to 9/11 itself. Al-Qaeda had gathered under the wing of the Taliban, who were the Afghan government. Eventually, al-Qaeda attacked us, spectacularly, on that September day. We did not invade Afghanistan automatically. We gave the government, the Taliban, a choice: hand over al-Qaeda and we will leave you alone; otherwise, we will invade and overthrow you. The Taliban chose the latter course. Rather than surrender al-Qaeda, Crocker says, the Taliban chose defeat and exile. That tells you something about the degree of attachment between the two groups.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecently, the Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, commented on loyalty oaths between the Taliban and al-Qaeda. These groups have pledged allegiance to each other.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the table with the United States, Taliban leaders have said they will not afford a haven to terrorists. Sure, says Crocker: They want us to leave and will say anything to get us out \u2014 because they know that once we leave, we\u2019re not coming back.\n\nI tell him something I heard from a Trump official: \u201cAs the president says, al-Qaeda and the rest don\u2019t have to be in Afghanistan, under the Taliban, to operate against us. They can be anywhere \u2014 like a house in Yemen.\u201d Crocker responds, \u201cThere is a difference between al-Qaeda finding some little corner of Yemen where things might be quiet enough that they don\u2019t have to switch beds every night, and having a country controlled by a government that embraces you.\u201d\n\nWe have been in Afghanistan since 2001. Eighteen years. This is our longest war by far. How much longer can the American people be expected to stick with it? Crocker says, in essence, that the American interest is not determined by a calendar. Would that it were that easy. The American interest does not have an expiration date.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen he left Afghanistan as ambassador in 2012, he says, we had about 100,000 troops in the country. Today, that number is 14,000 \u2014 and things are holding steady in Afghanistan. \u201cWe are still taking casualties, and every one is one too many, but those casualties are nowhere near what they were before.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople point out that the Taliban already holds big chunks of the country \u2014 this percentage or that percentage. Yes, says Crocker, but you have to consider: The Taliban does not hold a single provincial capital. Not one. \u201cSo, what are they holding? Open desert? That really doesn\u2019t count.\u201d Also, what they hold by night, they may not hold by day.\n\n\u201cThe fight is being carried out by the Afghans now,\u201d says Crocker \u2014 by the country\u2019s military \u2014 \u201cand they are doing it with real determination. They suffer some horrific losses, but they stay in the field, and one reason for that is, we\u2019re there too: not on the front lines but as advisers. We\u2019ve got their backs.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter rescinding the invitation to Camp David, President Trump called off talks between the U.S. and the Taliban altogether. Of course, they might resume at any time. These talks have always disgusted Crocker. For one thing, we cut the Afghan government out of the process, because the Taliban called the government our stooge. Our cutting them out gives the appearance of confirming the charge. President Ghani had 20 minutes to look at the draft agreement between us and the Taliban \u2014 an agreement that would determine his country\u2019s fate.\n\nAll of this reminds Crocker, and not a few others, of the Paris peace talks during the Vietnam War. We were acknowledging defeat, merely negotiating the terms of our surrender \u2014 and leaving our allies in the lurch.\n\nWhat do we owe our allies? Anything? This is a hotly controversial issue. U.S. security \u2014 the hard American interest \u2014 is paramount, as Crocker says. But he is also worried about \u201ca betrayal of our values.\u201d When he arrived in Kabul in January 2002, to open our embassy there \u2014 he was serving as charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires \u2014 there were about 900,000 Afghan kids in school. Not one of them was a girl. Not a single one. Today, there are about 9 million students, and more than a third of them are girls. Women participate in business, in the military, and elsewhere. A quarter of the parliament is composed of women.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve worked very hard to give girls and women opportunities in Afghanistan,\u201d says Crocker. \u201cImplicit in it is: You women step forward, we Americans have your back.\u201d Now, \u201cwhat do you think is going to happen to them if we walk out and the Taliban walks back in? The Taliban hasn\u2019t gotten any kinder or gentler during their years in exile.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, I interviewed Laila Haidari, a businesswoman and civil-society leader in Afghanistan. (She runs drug-rehabilitation programs, for which there is a great need.) She stressed over and over that if the Taliban return, people like her are finished. Absolutely finished. Out of any public role, of course, but maybe dead, too.\n\nOnline, there are comments \u2014 reader comments \u2014 underneath the article I wrote about Haidari. The first of them is directed to the woman herself. \u201cSucks to be you,\u201d says the reader. \u201cAnd don\u2019t blame the USA for anything.\u201d (She does not, and never has.) \u201cAfghanistan was a hell hole when Alexander blew through there 2500 years ago. Fix you[r] own problems.\u201d\n\nThis is a widespread sentiment \u2014 understandable, too \u2014 though most would probably not express it so obnoxiously. Yet even if you believe we have no obligation whatsoever to the Afghan people, remember: It sucked to be us on 9/11, and we should be wary of letting our guard down, and having to repeat the work we have done at such pain and cost over these nearly 20 years.\n\nRyan Crocker talks about the importance of staying power. Our foes have gotten used to waiting us out; our friends, or potential friends, are wary of our commitment. \u201cThe impression has grown,\u201d says Crocker, \u201cthat the Americans will come, the Americans will kick butts around the block a few times, and then the Americans will get tired of it all and the Americans will go home.\u201d It would be better if friend and foe alike knew that we would remain as long as necessary \u2014 as long as necessary for our interest.\n\nIn Afghanistan, says Crocker, we are spending less and less in blood and treasure. Fewer troops \u2014 almost a tenth the number we had when he was ambassador. Fewer casualties. A relatively manageable situation on the ground. \u201cWhile our involvement is still expensive,\u201d says Crocker, \u201cI think it\u2019s a pretty good insurance policy against another 9/11.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA lot of us are thinking about Vietnam, as I\u2019ve mentioned \u2014 Afghanistan has been smelling more and more like Vietnam. But we don\u2019t have to go that far back: What about Iraq? In an op-ed column for the Washington Post \u2014 published at the beginning of this year \u2014 Crocker wrote, \u201cPresident Barack Obama proved in Iraq that the United States cannot end a war by withdrawing its forces \u2014 the battle space is simply left to our adversaries.\u201d We departed in 2011; ISIS arose, and we had to return. \u201cIn Afghanistan,\u201d Crocker continued, \u201cPresident Trump has a choice. He can follow Obama\u2019s example and leave the country to the Taliban, or he can make clear that the United States has interests, values, and allies, and will stand behind them.\u201d\n\nI have no answers concerning the Afghan War. I don\u2019t envy those \u2014 starting with the president \u2014 who have to decide. Maybe our withdrawal from Afghanistan would \u2014 will, I should probably say \u2014 leave us no less safe. But Ryan Crocker has made me think hard. To be honest, I had sort of given up on the Afghan War. Eighteen years, you know? And if you can\u2019t get it done in that time (whatever \u201cit\u201d is) . . . But Crocker has reminded me of some basics, and I suspect \u2014 fear \u2014 he is right.", "description": "A conversation with former ambassador Ryan Crocker.", "authors": ["Jay Nordlinger", "Ramesh Ponnuru", "Robert Verbruggen", "Katherine Timpf", "Douglas Murray", "John Mccormack", "William Voegeli", "Rachel Lu", "Robert D.
