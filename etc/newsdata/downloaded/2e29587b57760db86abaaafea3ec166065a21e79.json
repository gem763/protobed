(Picture: Getty)\n\nUS President Donald Trump had awarded hosting of the next G7 summit to one of his own Florida golf clubs, the White House said on Thursday, sparking accusations of corruption from the lawmakers and activists (Picture: AFP)\n\nClaims by the President that he would host the G7 summit at cost, although he refused to disclose the financial details, were also dismissed with opponents pointing out the free PR it would generate for the course.\n\nNoah Bookbinder, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said the reversal \u2018is a bow to reality, but does not change how astonishing it was that a president ever thought this was appropriate, or that it was something he could get away with\u2019.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden also condemned the selection of Doral saying: \u2018Hosting the G7 at Trump\u2019s hotel? A president should never be able to use the office for personal gain.\u2019\n\nThe president then displayed his anger at having to make the climbdown and tweeted: \u2018Based on both Media & Democrat Crazed and Irrational Hostility, we will no longer consider Trump National Doral, Miami, as the Host Site for the G-7 in 2020.\u2019\n\nHe added that his administration \u2018will begin the search for another site, including the possibility of Camp David, immediately.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
