Maxine Waters and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, for example, have been vocal opponents of Trump's troop withdrawal, after supporting Obama's efforts almost exactly eight years later.\n\nERDOGAN THREW TRUMP'S 'DON'T BE A FOOL' LETTER IN THE TRASH, SOURCES CLAIM\n\n\u201cAs the war in Iraq draws to a close, it is my hope that this conflict will serve as a solemn reminder of the costs of war,\u201d Waters said in a statement issued Oct. 21, 2011. \u201cWe must carefully reexamine our approach to national security and how we view the United States' role in promoting international peace and security. If we are to remain leaders in the world, we must always use our best judgment to determine when and how we engage other nations and other actors \u2013 particularly if we are considering the use of military force.\u201d\n\nWaters\u2019 approach to the United States\u2019 role in world affairs is similar to Trump\u2019s recent warnings against \u201cfighting other people\u2019s wars.\u201d\n\nCut to Oct. 7, 2019, and Waters blasted Trump for leaving Kurdish forces to fend for themselves against Turkish attacks.\n\n\u201cIf the United States abandons the Kurds, these courageous allies will never trust us again,\u201d Waters said in a statement, adding that \u201cTrump\u2019s betrayal of the Kurds is a gift to Russia, Iran and ISIS.\u201d\n\nThat same day, Pelosi came out against Trump, warning that leaving northern Syria could lead to an ISIS resurgence.\n\nDEMS STORM OUT OF SYRIA MEETING WITH TRUMP: 'WE HAVE TO PRAY FOR HIS HEALTH'\n\n\u201cThis reckless, misguided decision undermines the efforts by our brave servicemembers and our allies to end ISIS\u2019s tyranny,\u201d she said.\n\nBut while Republicans had similar concerns about withdrawing from Iraq in 2011, Pelosi praised Obama \u201cfor a promise made and a promise kept, honoring the U.S.-Iraq Security Agreement and the wishes of the American people to bring all our troops home by the end this year.\u201d\n\nPelosi stormed out of a meeting with Trump Wednesday after what she said was a \"meltdown\" by the president.\n\nOne of the Democratic frontrunners for the 2020 presidential nomination, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., was also critical of Trump, despite being historically anti-war.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t turn your back on an ally that lost 11,000 troops fighting against terrorism through a tweet and a discussion with Erdogan,\u201d Sanders told ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos. This criticism came despite Sanders acknowledgment that \u201cI am a strong opponent of endless wars.\u201d\n\nThat position was made evident in 2011 when Sanders backed Obama\u2019s Iraq withdrawal.\n\n\u201cI applaud the president's decision and have been advocating that position for quite a while,\u201d adding, \u201cNow is the time to bring our troops home, lower our military budget, and use those funds to create jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure and lowering our national debt.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Trump vented about Democratic criticism. \"I am the only person who can fight for the safety of our troops & bring them home from the ridiculous & costly Endless Wars, and be scorned. Democrats always liked that position, until I took it,\" he said.\n\nRepublicans have been equally critical of Trump, with 129 GOP members voting for a resolution in opposition to the withdrawal, joining a unanimous Democratic contingent. Sen. Lindsey Graham has been particularly vocal, leading Trump to accuse the senator of wanting to \u201cstay in the Middle East for the next 1,000 years.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nGraham, however, was no supporter of Obama, and lumped Trump and his predecessor together in making what he believes to be critical foreign policy errors.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is being told EXACTLY what President Obama was told before he withdrew from Iraq,\u201d Graham tweeted Wednesday. \u201cHe appears to be hell-bent on making the same mistakes in Syria as President Obama made in Iraq.\u201d", "description": "President Trump has met resistance from both parties after his decision to withdraw troops from northern Syria, but some of the rhetoric coming from Democrats is almost the opposite of what came from party members when President Barack Obama pulled forces out of Iraq.", "authors": ["Ronn Blitzer"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/ap18199567956852.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
