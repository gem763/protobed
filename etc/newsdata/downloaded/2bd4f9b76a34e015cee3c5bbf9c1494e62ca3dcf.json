That was some 40% of the day\u2019s trading volume in September e-minis\u2014making it a trade that could not easily be ignored. By then, President Trump was already in Osaka, Japan\u201414 hours ahead of Chicago\u2014and on his way to a roughly hour-long meeting with China\u2019s President Xi Jinping as part of the G20 summit. On Saturday in Osaka, after the market had closed in Chicago, Trump emerged from his meeting with Xi and announced that the intermittent trade talks were \u201cback on track.\u201d The following week was a good one in the stock market, thanks to the Trump announcement. On Thursday, June 27, the S&P 500 index stood at about 2915; a week or so later, it was just below 3000, a gain of 84 points, or $4,200 per e-mini contract. Whoever bought the 420,000 e-minis on June 28 had made a handsome profit of nearly $1.8 billion.\n\nTraders in the Chicago pits have been watching these kinds of wagers with an increasing mixture of shock and awe since the start of the Trump presidency. They are used to rapid fluctuations in the S&P 500 index; volatility is common, of course. But the precision and timing of these trades, and the vast amount of money being made as a result of them, make the traders wonder if all this is on the level. Are the people behind these trades incredibly lucky, or do they have access to information that other people don\u2019t have about, say, Trump\u2019s or Beijing\u2019s latest thinking on the trade war or any other of a number of ways that Trump is able to move the markets through his tweeting or slips of the tongue? Essentially, do they have inside information?\u2026\n\nThere is no way for another trader, let alone an outsider such as me, to know who is making these trades. But regulators know or can find out. One longtime CME trader who has been watching with disgust says he\u2019s never seen anything quite like these trades, not at least since al-Qaida cashed in before initiating the September 11 attacks. \u201cThere is definite hanky-panky going on, to the world\u2019s financial markets\u2019 detriment,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is abysmal.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["William Cohan", "Vanityfair.Com News The-Mystery-Of-The-Trump-Chaos-Trades"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
