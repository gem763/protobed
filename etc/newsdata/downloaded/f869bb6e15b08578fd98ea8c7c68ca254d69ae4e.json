GM spokesman Tony Cervone said the automaker \"couldn't agree more\" with Trump's call.\n\nA strike will very quickly shut down GM's operations across North America and could hurt the broader U.S. economy. Prolonged industrial action would also cause hardship for GM hourly workers on greatly reduced strike pay.\n\nGM's workers last went out on a brief two-day strike in 2007 during contract talks. A more painful strike occurred in Flint, Michigan, in 1998, lasting 54 days and costing the No. 1 U.S. automaker more than $2 billion.\n\nNo further talks were scheduled before the strike is set to begin, a union spokesman and GM said.\n\nTalks are set to resume on Monday at 10 a.m. EDT (1400 GMT).\n\nThe union has been fighting to stop GM from closing auto assembly plants in Ohio and Michigan, and arguing workers deserve higher pay after years of record profits for GM in North America.\n\nGM argues the plant shutdowns are necessary responses to market shifts, and that UAW wages and benefits are expensive compared with competing non-union auto plants in southern U.S. states. In its statement, the automaker said its offer to the union included solutions for the Michigan and Ohio assembly plants currently lacking products.\n\nA person familiar with GM's offer said that could include producing a future electric vehicle in Detroit.\n\nIt could also include turning a plant in Lordstown, Ohio, into an electric vehicle battery plant or going through with the proposed sale of the plant to a group affiliated with electric vehicle start-up Workhorse Group Inc.\n\nA new battery plant could give some UAW workers at Lordstown the chance to remain with GM.\n\nThe closure of Lordstown drew widespread criticism, including from Trump, who met with GM Chief Executive Mary Barra on Sept. 5. Ohio is crucial to Trump's re-election bid in 2020.\n\nBut several Democratic presidential candidates said they backed the UAW, including Senators Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris, former Vice President Joe Biden and Representative Tim Ryan.\n\nSanders noted GM received a U.S.-taxpayer funded $50 billion bailout a decade ago. \"Our message to General Motors is a simple one: End the greed, sit down with the UAW and work out an agreement that treats your workers with the respect and the dignity they deserve,\" Sanders said in a statement.\n\nBiden said on Twitter he backed the UAW's demand for \"fair wages and benefits for their members. America's workers deserve better.\"\n\nThe union has framed the plant closures as a betrayal of workers who made concessions in 2009 to help GM through its government-led bankruptcy.\n\n\"General Motors needs to understand that we stood up for GM when they needed us,\" Ted Krumm, head of the union's bargaining committee in talks with GM, said at the Sunday news conference. These are profitable times ... and we deserve a fair contract.\"\n\nThe UAW says significant differences remain between both sides over wages, health care benefits, temporary employees, job security and profit sharing.\n\nThe strike will test both the union and GM at a time when the U.S. auto industry is facing slowing sales and rising costs for launching electric vehicles and curbing emissions.\n\nKristin Dziczek, vice president of industry, labor and economics at the Ann Arbor, Michigan-based Center for Automotive Research (CAR), said the strike at GM's U.S. facilities will also shut its plants in Canada and Mexico as the automaker's supply chain is so integrated.\n\nStory continues", "description": "DETROIT/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers (UAW) went on strike at General Motors just after midnight Sunday and about 48,000 hourly workers at its facilities are headed for the picket lines in the morning, union officials said early Monday.
