He will take a plane -- Air Force Two -- for a 1 hour 5 minute flight, Shannon to Dublin. \u2014 Derek Wallbank (@dwallbank) September 3, 2019\n\nPence\u2019s stay made for a bizarre two-fer Trump golf course phenomenon on Monday. While the president was playing at his Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia (and monitoring the progress of Hurricane Dorian, White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham claimed), Pence was at Doonbeg in County Clare.\n\nBoth Trump and Pence are at Trump properties at this moment on Labor Day.

His grandfather Richard Michael Cawley emigrated from County Sligo to Chicago in the 1920s. Cawley\u2019s Irish-American wife hailed from Doonbeg, according to the Irish Times.\n\nThough Doonbeg appears to be an inefficient and expensive location for Pence\u2019s work during his visit, the golf club stay serves the president well. Not only is federal money spent at Doonbeg, it gives the business a high-profile advertorial platform to attract customers.\n\nCritics on Twitter were teed off about the situation.\n\nThe grift continues. A bloody disgrace and paid by taxpayers. \u2014 Kieran Hannon (@kieranhannon) September 3, 2019\n\nThe VP is staying a 3 hour drive from Irish capital, necessitating costly helicopters, all so that his visit to Ireland can put cash in the boss\u2019s pocket.
