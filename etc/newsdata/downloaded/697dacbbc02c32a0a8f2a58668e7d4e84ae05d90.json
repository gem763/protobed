Remember those who risked their lives.\u201d\n\nThe Legion has also rejected claims it is political.\n\nIn the same video, Ms Mfon says: \"You don't have to agree with the politicians, you don't have to like their decisions.\"\n\nShe adds: \"This is more than some war in your history textbook.\"\n\nLast year, left-wing writer Aaron Bastani caused a backlash after he said the UK should \"close down the Royal British Legion\".\n\nIn one video, Bastani told his viewers: \"The poppy appeal is grotesque, I think it has a kind of triumphalist militarism... it's just like racist, right? It's white supremacist.\"\n\nCatherine Davies, head of remembrance at the Royal British Legion, said: \"The two-minute silence unites us all and is as relevant today as it was 100 years ago.\n\n\"Through our social channels we are reaching out to the general public, but we especially hope young people will get involved, as in order to uphold the memories of those who have gone before it's vital we pass on the torch of remembrance to the new generations.\"\n\nThe Twitter poppy emoji will appear when users tweet hashtags such as TwoMinuteSilence, LestWeForget and SaluteOurForces.\n\nThe first two-minute silence took place on November 11, 1919.\n\nSir Percy Fitzpatrick, a South African politician and author, suggested that the silence should be observed on Armistice Day in memory of the dead.\n\nKing George V asked the public to reflect for \"a brief space of two minutes\".\n\nThe Royal British Legion is the nation's biggest armed forces charity, providing care and support to personnel and their families as well as managing the annual poppy appeal.", "description": "A new social media-focused campaign is designed to encourage younger people to remember Britain's war dead", "authors": ["Gus Carter", "Image", "Getty Images Istockphoto", "Getty Images Europe"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article13567161.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_2017-Scottish-Poppy-Appeal.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
