That\u2019s what I\u2019m really disappointed about. I\u2019m not disappointed in what the referee\u2019s ruling was, I\u2019m not disappointed in how Rhys was tackling, I\u2019m disappointed in myself that I cost the team those points.\u201d\n\nHe added that he respected Poite\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cI understand the call but it\u2019s a tough one. I have been running like that for my entire career,\u201d Kerevi said.\n\n\u201cEspecially when you slow it down (on video), it gives a different picture rather than seeing it in normal pace. I\u2019m just getting back into my stride as I\u2019m going for the bump, I\u2019m just continuing my run. I\u2019m not trying to go towards his neck or anything. It\u2019s a tough one but I understand the ref\u2019s call and I understand what (pressure) they\u2019re under.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just trying to do what\u2019s best for the team and obviously trying to get over the ad line (gainline) and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s me changing the way I run. I have to get a clearer ruling on how we are meant to run. That\u2019s what players want, is the consistency.\u201d\n\nKerevi said he was kidding about thinking of switching to rugby league, but at the same time, \u201cI just don\u2019t want our sport to be soft. I understand it\u2019s all about safety. I understand that. But it\u2019s a collision sport.\u201d\n\nWhen the collision was reviewed, Kerevi and the Wallabies thought it was about Patchell tackling too high.\n\n\u201cWhen I realized they were looking at me it kind of shocked me, the first time I am getting looked at for running the ball,\u201d Kerevi said.\n\n\u201cHoops (Hooper) was kind of asking questions as to how I was meant to run next. He (Poite) said I can lead with the arms but I can\u2019t go for his neck. But if you slow it down (on video) it looks like that but the way I felt was as I was trying to bump him off and he was going backwards I just continued my stride, so I was just moving forward. That\u2019s why I guess it makes you look bad.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way I would lead with my arms straight to his face. I know the rules. I don\u2019t like to think of myself as a grub (dirty player) or anything like that.\u201d\n\nAustralia plays Uruguay on Saturday in Oita.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Samu Kerevi was more disappointed to cost Australia three points against Wales in the Rugby World Cup than being penalized for a legitimate charge.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Foster Niumata"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
