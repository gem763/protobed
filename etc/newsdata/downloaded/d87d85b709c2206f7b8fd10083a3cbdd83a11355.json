But there\u2019s a way to get them out.\n\nGood bowlers are able to work them out, not go away from the plan, keep digging away.\n\n\u2018But what happens is that people get bored and they try to find the magic solution and that magic solution allows that batsman to get free.\n\n\u2018But if you keep them where they don\u2019t like to be for long enough, you\u2019ll get a result. It\u2019s the same in rugby.\u2019\n\nThe All Blacks haven't suffered defeat in a World Cup match since France beat them in 2007\n\nThe All Blacks haven\u2019t lost a World Cup match since France shocked them in a quarter-final in Cardiff in 2007.\n\nJones said: \u2018We have a challenge this week because we are playing the greatest team that has ever been in sport. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a team that comes close to them for sustainability.\n\n'Since the last World Cup, I think they\u2019ve won nearly 90 per cent of their Tests. Name me another team in the world that plays at the absolute top level that wins 90 per cent of their games.\n\n\u2018I just admire them. To do what they do from a small country is incredible. It\u2019s an example of what you can do. People are raving about Japan at the moment and it\u2019s fantastic, but you look at what New Zealand have done with four million people. They produce this rugby team that has a 90 per cent winning record. You have to admire them.\n\nJones believes that Ireland were the latest team to fall under the All Black's spell on Saturday\n\n\u2018But then the challenge is to beat them. You always want to play the best and they are the best. If you want to be the best in the world, you have to beat the best. For the players and coaches, this is the best week of their lives and you have to enjoy it and work to get better.\u2019\n\nJones suggested that Ireland became the latest team to fall under the All Blacks\u2019 spell before their quarter-final had even begun.\n\n\u2018I think what happens is you become part of the show,\u2019 he said. \u2018I thought that happened a bit on Sunday. Ireland really got stuck in when the game was lost. You have to go hard from the start. That\u2019s going to be important for us.\u2019\n\nAnd Jones was not indulging in euphoria. \u2018All we\u2019ve earned on Saturday is another week in the competition,\u2019 said Jones. \u2018There\u2019s nothing to celebrate.\u2019", "description": "CHRIS FOY IN OITA: Eddie Jones set the scene for an epic World Cup semi-final by saying that the All Blacks are the greatest sporting team in history - and England can beat them.", "authors": ["Chris Foy For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/22/19966380-0-image-a-95_1571605686974.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
