In our election manifesto, people were promised a deal.\u201d\n\nSo far, cabinet ministers Jeremy Hunt, Michael Gove, Sajid Javid and Matt Hancock have thrown their hats into the ring to replace Ms May, while up-and-comers such as Brexit minister James Cleverly are trying their luck.\n\nOutside candidate Rory Stewart, the international development secretary, has won praise after he set off around the country to meet the public, armed with a selfie stick.\n\nHis hopes were bolstered by an endorsement by justice secretary David Gauke, who said Mr Stewart was a \u201cstrong contender\u201d.\n\nMr Gauke also said he could not serve in a cabinet that was pursuing a no-deal Brexit but acknowledged it was important to keep the idea on the table.\n\nFormer cabinet minister Andrea Leadsom said she would take the UK out of the EU by the end of October in a \u201cmanaged exit\u201d \u2013 and ruled out renegotiating Ms May\u2019s deal.\n\nMs Leadsom, whose resignation triggered Ms May\u2019s departure, said the prime minister\u2019s deal was \u201cdead\u201d as the EU would not reopen it and MPs have rejected it.\n\nMr Javid, the home secretary, said he wanted to leave the EU on 31 October as planned but he did not explicitly rule out a delay to Brexit.\n\nHe told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show: \u201cI want to leave with a deal but if I have to choose between no deal and no Brexit, I would pick no deal.\u201d\n\nPressed on the matter, he said: \u201cThat\u2019s not something I would do, but we are a parliamentary democracy and what we\u2019ve seen in the last few months is parliament has taken on some extraordinary powers to initiate its own legislation so if it\u2019s statute, if it\u2019s the law, I would not break the law if I was prime minister, of course I would observe the law.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, warned candidates against supporting a no-deal exit as they had a \u201cbrief opportunity to reset the political agenda\u201d.\n\nMs Rudd is regarded as a possible kingmaker in the upcoming contest, as she heads up a 60-strong caucus of moderate Tories.", "description": "Former minister Sam Gyimah has\u00a0become the first Tory leadership hopeful to\u00a0back a new referendum as the number of candidates to succeed Theresa May swelled to\u00a013.
