A petite lemon arbor. A stained glass coat-of-arms decorating the edge of a towering window pane.\n\nThese are just a few of the eye-catching details hidden throughout Croydon House, a classic English country home tucked away behind towering trees on nearly two acres of land in Montecito, California.\n\n\"It is like living in a fantastic museum that saved all the time and history inside its walls,\" said listing agent Barry Fields of Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2013Sunset Strip Brokerage.\n\nCompleted in 1929, the 90-year-old residence\u2019s classic charm is on full display with an exterior defined by dramatic gables, leaded windows and an imposing wood door featuring an intricately carved geometric pattern.\n\nMore: L.A. Megamansion Relisted for $110 Million After $25 Million Price Cut\n\n\"Everywhere you turn there is just something interesting to look at,\" Mr. Fields said about the interior.\n\nEntering the home\u2019s central foyer, homeowners and guests are greeted with glistening dark wood floors, a metal lighting fixture, and a staircase with a striking balustrade that sweeps into the entryway. As they wander throughout the residence, homeowners find stone-carved fireplaces comfortably sitting alongside colorful walls and vibrantly patterned wallpaper. Keen-eyed guests may even spot a secret passageway, concealed behind a wall panel, that leads to another end of the home.\n\nOutside, Mr. Fields noted homeowners would find \"stone covered pea gravel with olive trees that create [an] outdoor living room\" with a view revealing the \"majesty\" of the property.\n\nStats\n\nResting on approximately 1.8 acres of land, the 6,661-square-foot home has four bedrooms and seven bathrooms.\n\nThough he said it would be a \"shame\" to split up the landscaped grounds, Mr. Fields added that a second residence can be built on the land. \\\n\nMore: Kirsten Dunst Sells Longtime Lakefront Home in Los Angeles\n\nAmenities\n\nAmong the amenities are an outdoor swimming pool, a private spa and a wine cellar with capacity for over 10,000 bottles.\n\nNeighborhood Notes\n\nThe residence is located in the Lower Village of Montecito, California.
