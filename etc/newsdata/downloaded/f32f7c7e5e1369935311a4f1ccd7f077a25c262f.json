There's no rhyme or reason to it,\" Ahmad said.\n\nThe plaintiffs are 126 women and children from 59 families, mostly from the impoverished and violent Central American countries of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, who were rejected in the early stages of the asylum process while staying at the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas.\n\nThe suit was filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C.\n\nTrump's virtual asylum ban at the southern border denies migrants if they did not first seek safe haven in another country that they traveled through on the way to the United States, such as Mexico or Guatemala.\n\nOther lawsuits previously filed challenge the rule itself, and lower courts had agreed to block implementation immediately. But in a big victory for Trump, the Supreme Court last Wednesday allowed the rule to take effect immediately while the trial is heard.\n\nAs a result, immigration judges can reject asylum claims, regardless of their merits, if the applicant did not first seek asylum in another country.\n\nThe Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Trump administration has called the surge of Central American immigration a crisis and says most migrants falsify asylum claims as a ruse to gain entry to the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Daniel Trotta; Editing by Dan Grebler)", "description": "The lawsuit, filed late on Monday, was the first to challenge President Donald Trump over asylum since the U.S. Supreme Court decided last week that an anti-asylum rule will be allowed to take effect while a separate lawsuit on its underlying legality is heard.
