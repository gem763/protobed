Under EU regulations introduced earlier this year to curb overfishing, boats are no longer allowed to discard any undersized fish they catch.\n\nInstead, the smaller fish \u2013 which cannot be sold for human consumption \u2013 must be taken back to land, to count towards their overall quota.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nData showed that more than 2,600 tonnes of unwanted cod, haddock, whiting and saithe were estimated to have been caught in scampi fisheries in the first three months of this year. This will result in the waste of around 10,500 tonnes of dead fish by the end of 2019, according to the FOI request by marine campaigning group Open Seas.\n\nThe landing data shows virtually none of this bycatch is declared in port \u2013 which means a large portion of it must be illegally thrown out of the boat.\n\nThis means fishermen are not discouraged from fishing in shallow coastal waters where juvenile fish live, so fragile populations of fish like North Sea cod are not given chance to recover.\n\nPhil Taylor, head of policy for Open Seas, says: \u201cThere is now overwhelming evidence that the shocking practice of fish discarding is continuing illegally in our coastal seas. The problem is clear-cut for scampi trawlers which often use small meshed nets that catch of large volumes of unwanted, young fish, often less than 20cm in length.\n\n\u201cThis evidence sadly reveals these are being routinely chucked back into the sea dead, in spite of the law.\n\n\u201cThis is driving overfishing of fish stocks in these areas that are already on their knees,\u201d said Mr Taylor, who also received footage from an anonymous source showing dead fish being dumped back into the sea.\n\nThe footage is likely to include juvenile cod and whiting, according to Open Seas. These two species of fish are particularly vulnerable to overfishing having collapsed in this area in the 2000s and never properly recovered.\n\nMr Taylor says: \u201cThis is a desperate situation. We can\u2019t continue ignoring such short-termism that is undermining the environmental health of our seas and even the future of the trawling sector itself.\n\n\u201cScampi from places like this is being sold as \u2018responsibly sourced\u2019 by the seafood industry that seem to be turning a blind eye to this destruction. We challenge both Scottish ministers and the scampi sector to take urgent action to end this damage.\u201d\n\nEnvironmental groups have long pushed for the fishing industry to adopt practices that reduce bycatch.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

His public petition attracted 870,000 signatures.\n\nIf fishermen do discard their fish illegally, government agency Marine Scotland has the power to issue penalty points that could mean the offender\u2019s fishing licences is suspended for up to one year. No one has been prosecuted yet.\n\nA spokesperson from the government says: \u201cWe support the landing obligation where good valuable fish are not thrown back dead and will enforce any breaches we encounter.\n\n\u201cAny issues of compliance with the landing obligation should not be viewed in isolation, this is a EU wide problem, in very complex mixed fisheries. For example in Scottish waters there can be up to 12 different non Scottish nationalities of vessels present at any one time.\n\n\u201cHowever, we believe it is vital that we put in place an appropriate response to landing obligations in order to protect stock and to secure the long term sustainability of our fleet.\n\n\u201cWe would encourage anyone who has evidence of suspected infringements of the law to provide it to us. We will investigate to the extent that the evidence allows.\u201d\n\nReports of suspicious activity can be made anonymously on the helpline 0131 271 9700.", "description": "Several thousand tonnes of dead fish have been illegally discarded by trawlers in the North Sea and west coast of Scotland this year, a Freedom of Information request has revealed.\u00a0 Small, juvenile fish often end up getting caught in scampi fisheries because their mesh nets are so small.
