Lo renaissance. Last week, Lopez trotted out at Milan Fashion Week in her iconic green Versace dress, the same one that inspired the creation of the Google Image search function in 2001. Nearly 20 years later, the flowy garment still managed to set the Internet on fire, albeit now through social media platforms that didn\u2019t exist when Lopez first donned the gown.\n\nShe\u2019s also getting serious Oscar buzz for her critically acclaimed role as Ramona in \u201cHustlers,\u201d which shows off her still-strong acting and dancing chops.\n\nThe Academy Awards ceremony takes place Feb. 9. If nominated for an Oscar, Lopez will have just a few days between dancing her heart out at the Super Bowl in Miami and hitting the red carpet in Los Angeles.\n\nMeanwhile, Shakira has been touring internationally in support of her mostly Spanish-language 2017 album, \u201cEl Dorado,\u201d which won her a Latin Grammy.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEverything you forgot about Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake\u2019s 2004 Super Bowl controversy\n\nLopez recently addressed rumors that she\u2019d perform at the halftime show. Ryan Seacrest pressed her on the question weeks ago, telling her that performing at the event would be \u201ca great thing to say \u2018yes\u2019 to in theory.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn theory, yes,\u201d she replied. \u201cIt\u2019s something that we\u2019ve talked about for many years, and, you know, it would be nice. It would be nice. I can\u2019t say I wouldn\u2019t love it.\u201d\n\nThe Super Bowl halftime show remains one of the last bastions of television monoculture, with more than 100 million viewers usually tuning in to watch the game. As such, the performance is a high-wire act for musicians. As Washington Post pop music critic Chris Richards wrote after Maroon 5\u2019s widely panned 2019 headlining performance, \u201cthere are only two ways to survive a Super Bowl halftime show in this day and age: Be unforgettable, or be entirely forgettable.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe\u2019ve seen both types at halftimes past. Unforgettables understand the magnitude of the event \u2014 they know that they\u2019re performing for the biggest audience of their life \u2014 and they treat it as the momentous privilege that it is. Forgettables might grasp the stakes, too, but they\u2019re ultimately counting on half the Super Bowl viewership to stumble off into the kitchen to throw another plate of nachos in the microwave. Unforgettables want to make history. Forgettables don\u2019t want to embarrass themselves. Unforgettables cannonball into the deep end. Forgettables swan-dive like experts, barely making a sploosh.\n\nAlthough neither Lopez nor Shakira has had recent hits in the United States, the halftime show has done well when playing up the nostalgia factor, such as with 2015\u2019s Missy Elliott retrospective.\n\nBut even taking the gig has become fraught in recent years, in light of former San Francisco 49ers player Colin Kaepernick\u2019s protests against police brutality. Rihanna was among the high-profile artists who reportedly turned down the NFL last year.\n\n\u201cI said \u2018no\u2019 to the Super Bowl,\u201d Jay-Z rapped as recently as 2018. \u201cYou need me; I don\u2019t need you.\u201d\n\nA year later, he teamed up with the NFL. While the partnership includes expanding the league\u2019s social justice initiative, Inspire Change, the business pairing was controversial among many of the rapper\u2019s fans, as well as the league\u2019s critics and supporters of Kaepernick.\n\nNFL safety Eric Reid, a close friend of Kaepernick\u2019s, tweeted that \u201cit looks like [Jay-Z\u2019s] goal was to make millions and millions of dollars by assisting the NFL in burying Colin\u2019s career.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAdam Levine exposed his nipples during the Super Bowl halftime show, so let\u2019s talk about Janet Jackson\n\nMaroon 5 and the Super Bowl halftime show that erased itself\n\nAD", "description": "It's the first halftime show co-produced by Jay-Z and Roc Nation.", "authors": ["Elahe Izadi", "Pop Culture Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/kvt-DQ9kc9pQGmShBNiME2wxmCE=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/77YNMYXASYI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
