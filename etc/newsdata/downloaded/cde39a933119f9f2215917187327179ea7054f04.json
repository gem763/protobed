England\u2019s defence coach John Mitchell described Saturday\u2019s final as a showdown between the world\u2019s two most powerful teams and Vunipola is relishing the challenge.\n\nAfter South Africa\u2019s attritional victory over Wales in Sunday\u2019s semi-final, the second row Lood de Jager said, \u201cthe only way we know is fighting fire with fire\u201d. England on the other hand, were dominant in the way they dismantled the All Blacks to reach the final.\n\nCheslin Kolbe back in contention for South Africa in World Cup final Read more\n\n\u201cIt is a similar threat to New Zealand and as you saw on Sunday they are very big people but then again we have a few big blokes on our team,\u201d said Vunipola. \u201cThey have already come out and said they want to fight fire with fire and I guess we return it by saying: \u2018bring it on\u2019. It is a final and one of those things you have to front up to and one of their biggest assets and something we have been working on. Like Eddie has mentioned they have many different threats and one is their forward pack.\u201d\n\nEngland have received rave reviews for their defensive effort throughout the tournament and in particular against the All Blacks. Sam Underhill finished the match with 16 tackles including two thunderous hits on Kieran Read and Jordie Barrett. \u201cIt\u2019s something that you probably can\u2019t measure, but I think the best way to explain it is that it\u2019s quite contagious,\u201d added Vunipola. \u201cIt shows everyone it can be done, so everyone else tries to follow in the slipstreams of Underhill, [Tom] Curry and Maro [Itoje]. It\u2019s very easy when you see it. A lot of people talk about it and it\u2019s easy to sit here and say we want to be brutal, but you have to back those words up and those guys are probably the best at leading that area.\u201d\n\nVunipola has played against South Africa four times in his career, winning once and losing on three occasions. Two of those defeats came on last summer\u2019s tour of South Africa, the second of which saw Vunipola refracture his right arm. In those two Tests, Vunipola believes he was outshone by his opposite number Duane Vermeulen, who was among the standout performers in both matches, but England\u2019s No 8 plans to ensure that does not happen again.\n\n\u201cWhen coaches throw words like [brutality] at you, you have to back it up,\u201d said Vunipola. \u201cWe have been challenged again to bring the same intensity this weekend, like I said, they have some big players on their team. None more so probably than their second rowers and Duane, those guys are great players and it is a challenge for us up front to give [our backs] that time and space with the ball to do what they do.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve played against them a few times and [Duane] has got up the last few times so personally I\u2019m going to try my best to win that little battle so to speak and hopefully that will help the team. He just played better. It\u2019s something I think about in terms of trying to help my team as much as possible. I guess he comes into that equation because he\u2019s such a big player for them. I played against him last summer and he was monumental in terms of getting them those two victories. Not just myself, but we\u2019ve got to try and negate the influence of him and everyone else around him.\u201d", "description": "Billy Vunipola has responded to South Africa\u2019s promise of all-out aggression in Saturday\u2019s World Cup final by declaring \u2018bring it on\u2019", "authors": ["Gerard Meagher"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20446a37c351a85fffc41076eb3c47bd44c7053f/0_230_5415_3249/master/5415.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0935e5223be9195770a9f58388caa268", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
