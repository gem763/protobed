China maintains strict quotas on the number of foreign films per year that are allowed to show on Chinese screens.\n\nChina ranks as the world\u2019s second-largest movie market, and Hollywood studios clamor to get their biggest titles on Beijing\u2019s approval list.\n\nBut The Hollywood Reporter revealed late Friday that Tarantino has no plans to touch the scene in question, which portrays Bruce Lee as an arrogant and self-aggrandizing performer who is defeated in a fight with low-ranking stuntman Cliff Booth, played by Brad Pitt. The Reporter cited an anonymous source close to the situation.\n\nTarantino is one of the rare filmmakers in Hollywood who retains final cut privileges over his movies.\n\nThe absence of a China release will likely hurt the movie\u2019s global box office haul. Both Pitt and co-star Leonardo DiCaprio are popular draws among Chinese moviegoers. Once Upon a Time was originally slated to be released in China this month through the distributor Bona Film Group.\n\nTarantino has publicly defended the way he portrayed Bruce Lee, saying that the martial arts fighter could be boastful in real life. \u201cI heard him say things like that \u2014 to that effect,\u201d the director told journalists when promoting the movie overseas earlier this year. \u201cCould Cliff beat up Bruce Lee? Brad would not be able to beat up Bruce Lee, but Cliff maybe could.\u201d\n\nOnce Upon a Time has so far grossed more than $366 million worldwide, and has been lavishly praised by critics. The movie is expected to figure prominently at the Academy Awards next year.\n\nFollow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg. Have a tip?
