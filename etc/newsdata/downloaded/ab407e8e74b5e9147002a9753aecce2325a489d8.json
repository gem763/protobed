In the show, Siff plays a performance coach working at a hedge fund who is caught between her boss and her husband, a US attorney.\n\nOn Friday, US District Judge George Daniels ruled in Showtime's favor, canceling Shull's lawsuit because the court found the show and the book \"do not seem to resemble each other in the least,\" Daniels wrote in his decision, which was published by THR.\n\nDaniels wrote that the court found no similarities between Shull and \"Billions\" character Wendy Rhoades, other than the fact that both women work as in-house performance coaches at hedge funds. But that alone is not enough to justify claims of copyright, according to the decision.\n\n\"An in-house psychiatrist may not be a 'stock character,'\" Daniels wrote, \"but the idea of an in-house psychiatrist, even in the context of a hedge fund, is certainly not one that was borne of Shull's own thinking.\"\n\nSiff spoke to Business Insider last year about various inspirations for her character, citing life coach Tony Robbins as well as Ari Kiev, who was the in-house psychiatrist at SAC Capital before he died in 2009.\n\nWhile the court dismissed the suit against Showtime, it denied the network's request to be compensated for attorney fees and costs, according to the decision.", "description": "Performance coach Denise Shull claimed in court that a 'Billions' character was based on her book, but a judge found few connections.", "authors": ["Alyssa Meyers"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5b1e74551ae6621a008b4c17?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
