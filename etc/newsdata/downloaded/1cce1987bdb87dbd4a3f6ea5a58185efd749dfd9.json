Morey issued subsequent tweets to try and stop the bleeding while Rockets star James Harden apologized for the tweet.\n\nHONG KONG FLAG FLIES DURING TNT COVERAGE OF LAKERS-CLIPPERS NBA SEASON OPENER\n\nBut to no avail.\n\nChina began to crackdown on the NBA almost immediately as Chinese sportswear brands either suspended or severed ties with the Rockets. The Communist government also blacked out broadcasts of the league\u2019s preseason games in the country and canceled NBA Cares events and media availabilities ahead of the exhibition games between the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets.\n\nNBA Commissioner Adam Silver stood in support of Morey\u2019s right to free speech but said he regretted the outcome. And while players remained silent while on mainland China, the league\u2019s most vocal critics of President Trump, his administration and societal issues also mostly chose to stay quiet, opting to either \u201clearn more\u201d about the situation -- or take more shots at the White House.\n\nADAM SILVER WARNED OF 'RETRIBUTION' FOR ALLEGEDLY LYING ABOUT CHINA REQUESTING HE FIRE ROCKETS GM\n\nAs the Lakers returned home, James took the lead on the matter and said Morey was \u201cmisinformed\u201d about Hong Kong and later doubled down on the controversial pronouncement and said he wasn\u2019t going to talk about the matter anymore because he was too focused on the problems in the U.S.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not here to judge how the league handled the situation,\" James said last week. \"I just think that, when you\u2019re misinformed or you\u2019re not educated about something \u2013 and I\u2019m just talking about the tweet itself \u2013 you never know the ramifications that can happen. We all see what that did, not only did for our league but for all of us in America, for people in China as well. Sometimes you have to think through the things that you say that may cause harm not only for yourself but for the majority of people. I think that\u2019s just a prime example of that.\"\n\nThe next day he lamented that \"we're not all politicians.\"\n\n\u201cI also don\u2019t think every issue should be everybody\u2019s problem as well. When things come up, there\u2019s multiple things that we haven\u2019t talked about that have happened in our own country that we don\u2019t bring up. There\u2019s things that happen in my own community in trying to help my kids graduate high school and go off to college. That\u2019s been my main concern the last couple of years with my school,\u201d he told the Los Angeles Times.\n\nSilver said last week that the Chinese government urged him to remove Morey from his position as the team\u2019s general manager and boasted that he resisted the request -- another statement which China noticed.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nWhile the Chinese government denied ever making the request, state media vowed \u201cretribution\u201d for Silver\u2019s alleged lies. State TV blacked out some of the NBA\u2019s regular-season games and the country\u2019s top streaming company, Tencent, only showed the Lakers\u2019 first game against the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nFox News\u2019 John Roberts contributed to this report.", "description": "Vice President Mike Pence blasted the NBA for acting like a \u201cwholly owned subsidiary\u201d of China during a news conference Thursday, further lambasting the league for its reaction to a general manager's tweet supporting pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is A Sports Reporter For Foxnews.Com", "Foxbusiness.Com.
