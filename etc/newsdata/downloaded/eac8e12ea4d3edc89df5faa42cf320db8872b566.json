Summer glaciers in Austria, France and Italy closed to skiers early, while snow and ice was melting even at 4,800m at the top of Mt Blanc \u2013 Europe\u2019s highest mountain.\n\nMake no mistake, ski resorts are afraid for their futures. Nothing puts this more into focus than the French resort of Tignes\u2019 current work to build an indoor snow slope at 2,300m above sea level \u2013 just so they can guarantee year-round skiing.\n\nThe ICE train connects Brussels with Cologne Credit: Deutsche Bahn AG/Uwe Miethe\n\nNot that any of this is breaking news; keen skiers and snowboarders will have seen numerous headlines each winter about the impacts of global warming in the mountains.\n\nFor me, it all started back in 2003, when, unlikely as it may sound, American politician and environmentalist Al Gore, the Greta Thunberg of his day, promoted his eco-film \u2018An Inconvenient Truth\u2019.\n\nIt had a tremendous impact on me and led me to change my family\u2019s investments, our electricity supplier, and even to become one of the first Britons to own an electric car.\n\nBut recently my daughter forced me to question what more I can do. We sat down as a family and decided we would stop taking long-haul holidays and that we would opt to travel by train for short-haul breaks instead of flying.\n\nIt also inspired me to start Ski Flight Free: a campaign to encourage skiers to travel to the Alps without setting foot on a plane.\n\nA recent survey by Swiss bank UBS suggested that attitudes towards the environmental impacts of flying are changing fast. More than a fifth (21 per cent) of the 6,000 people surveyed in the UK, US, Germany and France said that they had cut back on the number of flights they had taken in the previous year.\n\nFor that we can thank \u2018flygskam\u2019 \u2013 a Swedish word that translates best as \u2018flight shame\u2019.\n\nAviation\u2019s carbon footprint has grown by 20 per cent in Europe since 2005 and it\u2019s increasing at an average of four per cent annually.\n\nTravelling by train is a popular choice with families Credit: Picasa\n\nThe aviation sector accounted for around seven per cent of the UK\u2019s total emissions in 2017 and is projected to be the single biggest source of emissions in the UK by 2050.\n\nIt\u2019s the well-educated middle classes that are responsible for that growth and who are feeling the \u2018flight shame\u2019 of their inequitable carbon footprint.\n\nThe good news is that there are alternatives for most ski holidays in Europe: travelling by train.\n\nI have travelled to Chamonix, Val d'Is\u00e8re and M\u00e9ribel by train, but my favourite journey is always to St Anton. London to Paris by Eurostar, then a TGV to Zurich. The arrival is timed to fit perfectly with the train to Austria and this final connection takes you along the shores of the stunning Lake Constance before entering the Tirolean Alps.\n\nIt is possible to travel direct from London to the French Alps by Eurostar during winter weekends, or travel via Paris, connecting to a TGV to open up many more destinations.\n\nUndeniably travelling by train does take longer, depending how far from London you live, and it certainly won\u2019t be suitable for some, but compared with air travel, it\u2019s not only more carbon efficient, but it\u2019s so much more civilised as well.\n\nYou can work, sleep, enjoy incredible views, get up and stretch your legs. You can even talk to your friends and family.\n\nCheck in and security takes minutes, not hours, and your luggage is unlikely to get lost, nor will you get stuck on a runway.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to give up flying, but maybe just try travelling by train at least once this winter. You\u2019ll reduce your emissions, cut back your \u2018flight shame\u2019 and enjoy a much more relaxed start to your ski holiday.\n\nIt's possible to access across Europe, including Switzerland, by train Credit: tommy.picone/ph.tommy.picone\n\nFind out more about Iain Martin\u2019s Ski Flight Free Campaign at skiflightfree.org.
