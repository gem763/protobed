(AP) - Commercial flights may be returning to a crucial airport in the Four Corners.\n\nThe Farmington Daily Times reports officials said Tuesday commercial flights will likely return to the Four Corners Regional Airport by next summer.\n\nThe announcement comes after construction began at the airport in September to upgrade a runway. The upgrades will permit the airport to move from a BII classification to a CII classification, which allows for larger planes to land and depart.\n\nFarmington City Manager Rob Mayes says the upgrades benefit communities around Farmington and Durango, Colorado.\n\nThe airport has not hosted commercial flights since Great Lakes Aviation left in fall 2017. Prior to Great Lakes Aviation leaving, the airline had flights from Farmington to Denver and Los Angeles.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Daily Times, http://www.daily-times.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Commercial flights may be returning to a crucial airport in the Four Corners.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
