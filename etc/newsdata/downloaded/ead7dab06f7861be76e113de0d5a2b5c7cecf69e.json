Still, the Broncos told them he\u2019s \u201cnot available\u201d right now.\n\nHowever, Patriots insider Phil Perry of NBC Sports said it\u2019s time for Elway to consider his position after the Broncos (2-5) dropped an embarrassing 30-6 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs on Thursday Night Football, with Fox Sports commentator Troy Aikman describing Denver\u2019s offense as \"about as bad an offense as I've seen.\u201d\n\nPatriots insider says Broncos should start selling\n\nIn his column on NBC Sports website, Perry said that the Broncos should start selling after they dropped to 2-5.\n\nPerry said with the Broncos\u2019 latest loss, the possibility of Denver trading Sanders to the Patriots became more realistic. Patriots head coach Bill Belichick has had interest in Sanders before, signing him to a restricted free agent offer sheet in 2013 that the Broncos matched. Now, Belichick has a chance to bring in a veteran wide receiver who could provide immediate help for veteran quarterback Tom Brady.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the latest news!

NFL New England Patriots\n\nIn his past three games, the 42-year-old Brady threw just three touchdown passes with three interceptions after tossing seven scoring strikes without a pick in his first three outings. Perry said the 32-year-old Sanders could provide immediate impact for the Patriots with his ability to play both inside and out. Sanders would also provide a big lift to the Patriots\u2019 wide receiver corps that has been badly hit by various injuries. During Thursday\u2019s practice, Josh Gordon was out while Phillip Dorsett and Julian Edelman were both limited by hamstring and chest issues.\n\nSanders unhappy with Broncos\u2019 latest loss\n\nFollowing their loss to the Chiefs, Sanders expressed disappointment, saying he was aware of the problem, but he won\u2019t say it. \"You know. You know the answers. You watched the same game I watched,\u201d said Sanders, who finished with five catches for 60 yards against the Chiefs, bringing his season total to 30 catches for 367 yards and two touchdowns. As of now, Sanders is hoping to find a \u201csilver lining somewhere\u201d following their latest loss.\n\n\u201cBut at the end of the day, you gotta remain positive. It's the NFL. It's not easy to win,\u201d said Sanders. The Patriots could entice the Broncos to ship Sanders to Foxborough with a third-round pick, but they must make additional moves to create salary-cap room for the veteran wide receiver\u2019s cap hit.", "description": "The Broncos (2-5) suffered an embarrassing 30-6 defeat at the hands of the Chiefs.", "authors": ["Zeegee Cecilio", "Ken Kluska", "Read More On The Same Topic Zeegee Cecilio", "Julian Edelman Claims Patriots Need Rob Gronkowski", "Tight Ends Out Ahead Of Jets Clash", "Stephen A.
