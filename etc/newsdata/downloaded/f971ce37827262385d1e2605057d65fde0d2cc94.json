They wanted to make sure people knew the image, which featured the Daily Wire's watermark, was not a real photograph but was \"doctored.\"\n\nFine, just the president of the United States disseminating a doctored image created by a right-wing propaganda site. pic.twitter.com/Ky26zdDaXe \u2014 S.V.

The dog is not here at the @WhiteHouse -- yet. \u2014 Steve Herman (@W7VOA) October 30, 2019\n\nIt's just misleading. Obviously it is doctored but to be tweeted out like that without context makes people believe it's real, and from the other responses, people do actually think that. \u2014 Valerie Schremp Hahn ??

This is how you change a culture: lots of misinformation spread by a leader with a cult following and mainstreaming of rightist ideas and images.
