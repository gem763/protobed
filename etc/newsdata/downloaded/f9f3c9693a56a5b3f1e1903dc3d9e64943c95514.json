The workers will continue to get paid, said Mr. Flores.\n\nGeneral Motors had already scheduled production at the plant to close at end of the year, as part of an attempt by the company to cut costs.\n\nJerry Dias, president of the Unifor union that represents most of the GM workers in Canada, said he expects another 700 to be furloughed in Ontario next week as engines and transmission production slated for U.S. plants are idled. He said he has been in discussion with the UAW in the U.S. and said members remain \u201cmad as hell\u201d at GM. Talks with the company remained at \u201cpreliminary stages,\u201d he said.\n\nGM, which also produces engines and SUVs in Canada, employs approximately 7,000 workers in Canada, said the GM spokesman. The other workers remain on the job, and the spokesman declined to say whether their lines could also be idled if the walkout drags on.\n\nThe UAW\u2019s strike is one of the largest private-sector walkouts in the U.S. in years. Analysts estimate it is costing GM $50 million to $100 million a day in lost profits.\n\nThe strike also presents a challenge for the auto industry\u2019s parts suppliers, many of which are Canadian companies. There are 150 Canadian supplies plants in the U.S., employing 43,000 workers, said Flavio Volpe, president of the Automotive Parts Manufacturers\u2019 Association, a trade group that represents 300 companies.\n\nThough business from other carmakers continues to come in for those suppliers, the longer the strike drags on, the harder it will be for those suppliers to keep business going as usual, said Mr. Volpe. \u201cCanadian companies have no interest in seeing American shutdowns,\u201d he said. \u201cOur hope is they figure it out over the weekend.\u201d\n\nAurora, Ontario-based Magna International Inc., one of North America\u2019s largest auto suppliers, declined to offer specifics on how the strike is affecting its operations. \u201cLike the entire supply base, we are in wait-and-see mode,\u201d said a company spokeswoman in an emailed statement. \u201cWe are encouraged to see both sides get back to the negotiating table, working towards an agreement. Until then, we are continuing to monitor the situation as Magna supplies GM on a number of programs globally. We remain hopeful for a quick resolution.\u201d\n\nWrite to Vipal Monga at vipal.monga@wsj.com", "description": "General Motors has furloughed roughly 2,000 hourly workers at a plant in Oshawa, Ontario, near Toronto, as the impact of a strike by the United Auto Workers in the U.S. ripples north.", "authors": ["Vipal Monga"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109385/social", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
