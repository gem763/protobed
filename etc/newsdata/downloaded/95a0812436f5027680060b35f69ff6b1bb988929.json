Along with that comes the controversial tomahawk chop and \"war chant\" from the fans.\n\nIt's become part of Braves culture, beginning during their divisional dynasty in the 1990s.\n\nMany think that \"The Chop\" is an insensitive gesture to native groups, including St. Louis Cardinals rookie pitcher Ryan Helsley, who is a member of the Cherokee Nation.\n\nHelsley speaks the Cherokee language and has a long family history with deep roots in the heart of the Cherokee Nation.\n\nAnd in Game 1 in Atlanta, he witnessed \"The Chop\" first-hand when he took the mound in the eighth inning.\n\nRyan Helsley made his major league debut on April 16 with the Cardinals. (Photo: Jeff Curry, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nWhen asked what he thought of the gesture, Helsley called it \"disappointing\" and \"disrespectful.\"\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a misrepresentation of the Cherokee people or Native Americans in general,\u201d Helsley said told the St. Louis Dispatch before Game 2. \u201cJust depicts them in this kind of caveman-type people way who aren\u2019t intellectual. They are a lot of more than that. It\u2019s not me being offended by the whole mascot thing. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s about the misconception of us, the Native Americans, and it devalues us and how we\u2019re perceived in that way, or used as mascots. The Redskins and stuff like that.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the disappointing part,\u201d he said. \u201cThat stuff like this still goes on. It\u2019s just disrespectful, I think.\u201d\n\nHelsley, born and raised in Tahlequah, Oklahoma, admitted he did not watch many Braves games growing up, but was aware of what the fans do during the game.", "description": "Cardinals reliever Ryan Helsley, a member of the Cherokee nation, says Atlanta's tomahawk chop is  'disrespectful' to Native Americans.", "authors": ["Scott Boeck", "Published P.M.
