Lives were destroyed, reputations ruined, careers disrupted and, in some cases, ended. But there's nothing to see here, move along now.\n\nAll the senior coppers who were up to their neck in this disgusting miscarriage of 'justice' have not only been exonerated, they've been promoted or allowed to retire on full, gold-plated pensions.\n\nLabour's disreputable deputy leader Tom Watson (pictured) looks like walking away scot-free and even has the gall to present himself as a 'victim'\n\nTrebles all round!\n\nThe bombastic, over-promoted provincial Plod, Bernard Hyphen-Howe, Met Commissioner at the time and the man ultimately responsible, has been rewarded with a peerage.\n\nLabour's disreputable deputy leader Tom Watson looks like walking away scot-free and even has the gall to present himself as a 'victim'. Watson's fawning apologists, not just in Westminster but in the media, should be ashamed of themselves.\n\nWhen I read the impeccably independent findings of the former High Court judge Sir Richard Henriques, I simply shrugged and thought:\n\nTell us something we don't know.\n\nHe could have been reading out loud from my spoof column a couple of weeks ago, which had the BBC's Line Of Duty team investigating Scotland Yard. Mother of God!\n\nThe script will have been familiar to anyone who has followed in the Mail Stephen Wright's brilliant, forensic investigations of this scandal dating back several years.\n\nPolice routinely abused their powers, misled judges to obtain search warrants and dragged the names of distinguished public figures through the sewer.\n\nNobody at the Yard emerges with any credit from this ghastly episode \u2014 not least the sainted Cressida, Dick of Dock Green, who has done a passable impersonation of her political sponsor Mother Theresa and spent the duration hiding behind the sofa, just as May did during the Brexit referendum.\n\nShamefully, when she subsequently admitted that officers were wrong to say publicly that the false allegations made by the fantasist known as Nick were 'credible and true', she made no effort to correct that statement. It was allowed to remain on file for another nine months, by which time the damage had been done.\n\nUnderstandably, much of the recent media criticism of the police has concentrated on the appalling treatment of war hero Lord Bramall and ex-Home Secretary Leon Brittan.\n\nSome of us have longer memories. Where were the 'distinguished' newspaper commentators when the Old Bill were persecuting a random assortment of disc jockeys and TV presenters in the wake of the failure to bring Jimmy Savile to justice?\n\nWhere were they when a young couple living in the same building as equally innocent ex-Tory MP Harvey Proctor (pictured) were threatened with having their baby taken into care?\n\nWhere was the outrage when popular newspaper journalists simply doing their job were being treated like terrorists by coppers investigating 'misconduct in public office'?\n\nWhere were they when a young couple living in the same building as equally innocent ex-Tory MP Harvey Proctor were threatened with having their baby taken into care? This was Soviet era Stasi-style treatment straight from the chilling movie about Communist East Berlin, The Lives Of Others.\n\nThe monstrous treatment meted out to the Brittan and Bramall families was also visited upon blameless entertainers including Jimmy Tarbuck, Jim Davidson and Paul Gambaccini, to name but three.\n\nIt took me about ten minutes and a couple of phone calls to confirm that Tarby and Davidson couldn't possibly be guilty of the 'historic' crimes of which they were accused.\n\nBut Plod couldn't even be bothered to check out the facts and kept them dangling in a hell on earth for months on end.\n\nHyphen-Howe was getting measured for ermine, his reward for doing the bidding of his political paymasters.\n\nThe monstrous treatment meted out to the Brittan and Bramall (pictured) families was also visited upon blameless entertainers including Jimmy Tarbuck, Jim Davidson and Paul Gambaccini, to name but three\n\nDick of Dock Green was keeping her head down at the Foreign Office, waiting for Bernardo to swan off to the Lords before assuming her rightful position as First Lady of the Met.\n\nThe appalling Deputy Assistant Assistant Deputy And One For Yourself Or Whatever Ridiculous Title He Had At The Time Steve Plodhouse was polishing his buttons in anticipation of a lucrative new gig running 'Britain's FBI'. We're not talking J. Edgar Hoover here, are we?\n\nDick's successor as head of the witch-hunt, 'Fat Pat' Gallan, was allowed to slink away with a full pension before the solids hit the air conditioning.\n\nThe fact of the matter is \u2014 and I mean no disrespect to the proper coppers trying to keep us safe every day \u2014 Scotland Yard is no longer fit for purpose. I've long since given up on the Mind How You Go files, as the conduct of those who run our police forces is simply beyond parody.\n\nOnly yesterday we learned that, in concert with London's two-bob spiv of a mayor, that preening self-publicist Sadiq Khan, the Met has blown the thick end of two million smackeroonies on an investigation into internet trolls \u2014 resulting in just half a dozen convictions.\n\nJust as well there's no knife crime in London, eh?\n\nFor years, the Yard has been making wrongful arrests, illegally ransacking homes, terrifying innocent men, women and children, in pursuit of alleged 'misconduct in public office' and 'historic sex crimes' based on nothing more than the crazed imaginings of a known fantasist.\n\nYet no one at the top of the Yard, or anywhere else, is being brought to book. Which brings me to Tommy Watson, the wicked, politically motivated orchestrator of so much misery over the past few years. At one stage, the Yard seemed to be taking their marching orders directly from him.\n\nPrior to writing this column, I checked the cuttings library. It was back in November 2012 \u2014 seven years ago \u2014 that I first dubbed him The Nonce Finder General. On that same page, I wrote about Barack Obama's second election victory. That's how long ago it was.\n\nWatson abused Parliamentary privilege to falsely accuse leading Conservatives of being child molesters, and worse. His wild, unsubstantiated allegations emboldened soppy Speaker's wife Sally Bercow to identify the blameless Lord McAlpine as one of the guilty men.\n\nI have maintained all along that, at the very least, Watson should be collared by the highest authority for his role in perpetuating injustice and placed in the public dock. The lies and filth he peddled, along with his tame fantasist paedophile and a Left-wing 'news agency' intent on smearing Tories, continue to reverberate.\n\nHis recent, self-pitying pretence, claiming to be a 'victim' of all this, is vomit-inducing. From where I'm sitting, Watson \u2014 to adapt an outrageous jibe he directed at Leon Brittan \u2014 is as close to evil as any politician can get.\n\nCome to that, half the top brass at Scotland Yard over the past few years should be in the dock alongside him.\n\nMeanwhile, Jimmy Savile . . . well, you know the rest.", "description": "RICHARD LITTLEJOHN: The damning catalogue of police failures in the Paedos In High Places scandal will come as no surprise to readers of this newspaper - or this column in particular.", "authors": ["Richard Littlejohn For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/00/19419126-0-image-a-99_1570492307068.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
