Investigators and emergency fire personnel responded to Lienzo Charro del Ca\u00f1\u00f3n del Padre Street and located a torched panel truck and a badly burned presumed murder victim. At approximately 4am, emergency personnel responded to a house fire in colonia Ca\u00f1\u00f3n del Padre. Four burned murder victims were found inside the smoldering residence. Investigative personnel assigned to the state attorney general\u2019s office located several 9 mm shell casings at the scene.\n\nThe next discovery occurred at approximately 10am in colonia Matamoros. A victim was found inside an abandoned structure. Unknown suspects torched the building before escaping.\n\nAs of Wednesday, the total number of homicides registered in Tijuana stood at 1,790 for 2019. Eighty-one of those happened in October.\n\nThe record-breaking cartel violence continues despite the federal government\u2019s surge of military and police assets to the region since the end of 2018. The bloodshed is generally related to turf wars involving C\u00e1rtel Tijuana Nueva Generaci\u00f3n (CTNG), aligned with El C\u00e1rtel de Jalisco Nueva Generaci\u00f3n, against the Sinaloa Cartel. In some areas, rival factions within the Sinaloa Cartel are fighting for control of the lucrative street-level markets and smuggling routes into the United States. Those involved in the killings are primarily low-level dealers, lookouts, customers, and enforcers. Many of the street-level dealers are targets of rip-crews looking for cash and drugs.\n\nRobert Arce is a retired Phoenix Police detective with extensive experience working Mexican organized crime and street gangs.
