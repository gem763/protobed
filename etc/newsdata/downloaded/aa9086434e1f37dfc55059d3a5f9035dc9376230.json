The 30-second clip, titled \u201cBiden Corruption,\u201d is running on several national cable networks and online. To run the ad, the president\u2019s 2020 campaign spent $8 million, while the Republican National Committee (RNC) chipped in $2 million.\n\n\u201cJoe Biden promised Ukraine $1 billion if they fired the prosecutor investigating his son\u2019s company,\u201d the ad\u2019s narrator states. \u201cBut when President Trump asks Ukraine to investigate corruption, the Democrats want to impeach him.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd their media lapdogs fall in line,\u201d the ad continues, featuring clips of CNN figures such as Chris \u201cFredo\u201d Cuomo, Jim Acosta, and MSNBC host Rachel Maddow.\n\nIn a statement to the Daily Beast, CNN claimed it rejected the ad because \u201cit does not meet our advertising standards.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpecifically, in addition to disparaging CNN and its journalists, the ad makes assertions that have been proven demonstrably false by various news outlets, including CNN,\u201d the statement added.\n\nTim Murtaugh, Trump 2020 campaign\u2019s communications director, responded to the move by accusing CNN of \u201cspend[ing] all day protecting Joe Biden in their programming.\u201d\n\n\u201c[I]t\u2019s not surprising that they\u2019re shielding him from truthful advertising too, and then talking to other media outlets about it,\u201d he told the Daily Beast of the former vice president. \u201cOur ad is entirely accurate and was reviewed by counsel, and CNN wouldn\u2019t even describe to us what they found objectionable. This isn\u2019t a cable news channel anymore, it\u2019s a Democrat public relations firm.\u201d\n\nIn May 2017, CNN declined to air a Trump campaign ad due to a graphic branding the corporate media as \u201cfake news.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is absolutely shameful to see the media blocking the positive message that President Trump is trying to share with the country. It\u2019s clear that CNN is trying to silence our voice and censor our free speech because it doesn\u2019t fit their narrative,\u201d Michael Glassner, then-executive director of the campaign committee, said at the time.", "description": "CNN has refused to air an ad by Trump's 2020 campaign highlighting Biden's heavily scrutinized dealings with Ukraine, according to a report.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Biden-Ukraine-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
