The estimate includes losses from aggregate excess of loss reinsurance treaties that were also impacted by losses from other 2018 catastrophe and weather-related events. The company's loss estimate is consistent with industry insured losses of up to $20 billion.\n\nAXIS said that its preliminary pre-tax loss estimate for hurricane Michael is currently at the upper end of the previously disclosed range of $100 million to $120 million. The firm noted that due to the nature of this event, the actual net ultimate amount of losses for hurricane Michael may be materially different from this current estimate.", "description": "AXIS Capital Holdings has estimated that its pre-tax loss from California wildfires could be between $125 million and $150 million.", "authors": ["Newton Media"], "top_image": "https://www.bermudareinsurancemagazine.com/images/meta-logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
