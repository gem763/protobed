He said he would find the truth with a series of actions. He would probe whether or not top DOD officials plotted a bureaucratic coup. He said he would subpoena Andrew McCabe as well as Rod Rosenstein if necessary. So far, Graham\u2019s tenure has been defined by total inaction.\u201d\n\nThe Fox host then brought on Paul to offer his thoughts.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t call committee hearings and drag these people in. Senator Graham has the power,\u201d Paul said. \u201cHe is the chairman of a powerful committee, the Judiciary Committee. Yes, I\u2019ve encouraged them publicly and privately to do this . . . everything the Democrats have accused President Trump of doing, you know, investigating a political rival with a foreign country, all those same questions should be asked of the Democrats: did they do that to Trump?\u201d\n\nThe segment concluded with Carlson and Paul discussing why Republicans have yet to act, suggesting that despite Graham\u2019s claims, an unelected bureaucracy that remains hostile to Trump still holds influence over investigations.\n\n\u201cThe deep state has an enormous amount of power to look at individuals, and so when Senator Graham and I have fought these fights in the past, I have always fought for having warrants where a real judge in public has to present probable cause,\u201d Paul said. \u201cLindsay has always fought for allowing these to be done secretly . . . there might be a philosophical difference, that he wants them to maintain their power, he wants to maintain the intelligence community\u2019s enormous grip on things\u201d\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "Fox News pundit Tucker Carlson hosted Senator Rand Paul (R., Ky.) on his show Monday night to discuss Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham\u2019s (R., S.C.) handling of the ongoing investigation into the origins of the Russia Investigation.In a segment titled \u201cLindsey Graham Keeps Making Empty", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5iX.EjO5FuUxTiKJ687Ikg--~B/aD01OTc7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/683ce3cfaddaa3968dfe9e8d0113f244", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
