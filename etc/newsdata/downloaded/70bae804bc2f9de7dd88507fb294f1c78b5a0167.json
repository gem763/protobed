But this year seems to be a little different, if the rumors are to be believed.\n\nCheck out the rumors and murmurs we\u2019ve seen surrounding the OnePlus 7T phones:\n\nLike the OnePlus 7 series, there will be two models in the OnePlus 7T series, and they\u2019ll be announced on September 26.\n\nsource OnePlus\n\nNot only do the rumors say there will be a OnePlus 7T and OnePlus 7T Pro, but OnePlus itself confirmed in a tweet that the late 2019 lineup will be a \u201cseries,\u201d which suggests more than one model.\n\nThe big question is whether OnePlus will make both or just a single model available in the US. For the 7 series, OnePlus only made the \u201cPro\u201d model available. It\u2019s unclear whether the company will do the same thing with the 7T series. One rumor says that the OnePlus 7T Pro won\u2019t be released in the US, and only the OnePlus 7T will make it here.\n\nThe base OnePlus 7T model is getting a refresh in design, specs, and features.\n\nThe OnePlus 7 from earlier this year was largely a refresh of the OnePlus 6T with updated specs.\n\nThe OnePlus 7T, however, looks like it\u2019s getting a refreshed rear camera system with three lenses and a circular design.\n\nThe three camera lenses in the OnePlus 7T are rumored to include a regular 48-megapixel camera, a 16-megapixel ultra-wide lens, and a 12-megapixel 2X zoom lens.\n\nIt\u2019s also said to to come with the latest specs, including the Snapdragon 855 Plus chip from Qualcomm, which is a slightly more powerful version of the regular Snapdragon 855 chip in most of 2019\u2019s Android flagship phones.\n\nIt\u2019s also getting one of the most successful features from the OnePlus 7 Pro: the 90Hz smooth and fast display that makes normal smartphone displays look antiquated.\n\nOP7T:\n\n6.55inch 90Hz 2440\u00d71080 20:9\n\nFlat Display\n\n3800mAh Warp Charge 30T (yeah \"T\")\n\nSnapdragon 855+\n\n8/128GB base\n\n48MP+16MP(UW)+12MP[2x Zoom](TP)\n\n(960FPS 720p 10sec\n\nNightscape 2)\n\nAndroid 10 Picture via. @OnLeaks x @Pricebaba pic.twitter.com/mYyhk3mL0M \u2014 Max J.

Here\u2019s how it compares to the more affordable OnePlus 6T.\n\nThe OnePlus 7T Pro is also said to come with the Snapdragon 855 Plus chip, which should lend it a little extra horsepower over the OnePlus 7 Pro.\n\nOP7TPro / OP7TPro ML.

OnePlus phones released later in the year are typically released in October or November, so the same will likely be true about the 7T series.\n\nsource OnePlus\n\nOnePlus has built its reputation on making phones that comfortably compete with those from Samsung and Apple while demanding several hundreds of dollars less. It would be a surprising move if OnePlus brings the price tag of its OnePlus 7T phone closer to the $1,000 price tag.\n\nOnePlus also has some fresh and serious competition on its hands with the latest $700 iPhone 11, and it would be shocking if a OnePlus phone costs more than a brand-new iPhone.\n\nOnePlus phones released later in the year are usually released in October or November, and we\u2019re expecting an similar window for the OnePlus 7T phones.", "description": "Business Insider - One of the best smartphone makers in the world, OnePlus, just confirmed that it's announcing its new OnePlus 7T smartphones on September 26..
