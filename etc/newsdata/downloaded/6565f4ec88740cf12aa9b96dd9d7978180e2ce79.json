So naturally, the UK press either ignored it, or tried to cover it up with the proverbial wet blanket.\n\nGordon MacMillan, whose editorial responsibilities at Twitter extend to Europe, Africa and the Middle East, is also a member of the 77th Brigade with the rank of captain or maybe higher, Middle East Eye reported on Monday.\n\nThe unit was established in 2015 to wage \u201cnon-lethal\u201d propaganda war on Her Majesty\u2019s enemies, giving the British military \u201cthe capability to compete in the war of narratives at the tactical level,\u201d according to Chief of the Defence Staff General Nick Carter.\n\nAlso on rt.com Twitter editorial executive is British Army \u2018psyops\u2019 soldier \u2013 report\n\nMacMillan may not be a very good psy-warrior, considering that he basically outed himself by mentioning his involvement with the 77th on LinkedIn, but the fact itself should have been newsworthy.\n\n\u201cIf British mainstream media is genuinely interested in conducting public interest journalism, this will lead every newspaper tomorrow and every news bulletin tonight,\u201d Irish journalist Bryan MacDonald tweeted on Monday.\n\nNot surprisingly, that did not happen. Only a handful of outlets have touched the story so far \u2013 Financial Times, The Independent and Vice News, in addition to RT and Sputnik.\n\nMoreover, both the Independent and FT left out some key facts from their reporting, such as the role of the 77th Brigade, or Twitter\u2019s regular purges of \u201cstate-backed accounts,\u201d or MacMillan\u2019s interactions with the unit and promotion of its activities, noted Sputnik\u2019s Kit Klarenberg.\n\n\u201cThere's also no mention of MacMillan's extremely negative postings about Jeremy Corbyn and Labour \u2013 two targets of Integrity Initiative, with which 77th Brigade has a 'close, informal relationship'. Or the Institute for Statecraft's role in creating the unit. Of course,\u201d Klarenberg tweeted, calling it an attempt to control the narrative.\n\nNothing to see here, move on to the sport section.\n\nSomething similar happened in November 2018, when the Integrity Initiative and Institute for Statecraft were exposed as shadowy outfits conducting influence operations on social media on behalf of the UK government, targeting Russia even as London accused Moscow of doing just that. Again, the mainstream media either ignored the story, or reported it in such a fashion to tell the audience there was nothing to see there.\n\nAlso on rt.com Integrity Initiative is the biggest story of 2018 \u2013 but not because of anything it did\n\nThis becomes even more frightening when one considers that the Initiative and the Institute \u2013 as well as MacMillan \u2013 also engaged in domestic psy-ops, targeting the opposition Labour Party and its leader Jeremy Corbyn. It\u2019s one thing to argue that info-warriors are a necessary evil to defend poor, innocent Britain from the big bad Russian bear \u2013 but partisan politics? Is nothing sacred?\n\nSurely @LabourDCMS & @CommonsCMS will be investigating this without delay?\n\n\n\nThe public deserve to know if British Military Intelligence has been abusing power again.\n\n\n\nHas data been harvested? MoD refusing comment@johnmcdonnellMP, @labourlewis, @DawnButlerBrent, @EmmaLewellBuckhttps://t.co/lU4yvbNukE \u2014 Alex Tiffin (@RespectIsVital) September 30, 2019\n\nOf all the Western outlets, only Vice News dared to ask the obvious question: what does MacMillan\u2019s \u201cside job\u201d say about Twitter\u2019s commitment to uncovering and stopping \u201cdisinformation campaigns\u201d by governments \u2013 or does that only apply to certain governments, whose names don\u2019t begin with \u201cUnited\u201d?\n\n\u201cIf Twitter is only tackling disinfo campaigns of enemies of the UK and US governments, but not the UK and US governments themselves, then their work basically serves as a tool to these governments, rather than actually improving Twitter for everyone,\u201d security researcher Mustafa al Bassam told Vice.\n\nTwitter has only said they \u201cactively encourage all our employees to pursue external interests.\u201d As for London, a spokesperson for the British Army would not comment on specific activities of individual reservists, but told RT that \u201cThere is no relationship or agreement between 77th Brigade and Twitter, other than using it as a social media platform.\u201d\n\nWhether you believe these answers or not, the fact remains that almost none of the fearless truth-seekers and self-appointed guardians of democracy that dies in darkness has bothered to actually ask the questions.\n\nNebojsa Malic, senior writer at RT", "description": "The discovery that a senior Twitter executive is also a British Army psy-ops warrior qualifies as a bombshell in every way.
