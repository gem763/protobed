We are making a statement to the world that beautiful wild animals like bears and tigers have no place on trapeze wires or jumping through flames.\u201d\n\nThe ban excludes fur worn for religious or tribal purposes, and used fur. It also does not apply to leather, cowhides, stuffed animals and the full skin of deer, sheep and goats, according to the SF Chronicle.\n\nUnder the new law, violators could face up to $500 (\u00a3400) fines, with fines up to $1,000 for repeat violations. Fines can apply to each product sold.\n\nKitty Block, the chief executive and president of the Humane Society of the United States said in a statement: \u201cThe signing of AB44 underscores the point that today\u2019s consumers simply don\u2019t want wild animals to suffer extreme pain and fear for the sake of fashion.\u201d\n\nHowever, a spokesperson for the Fur Information Council said the group sees the law as an attack on choice.\n\nIn a statement, the spokesperson said the new law is part of a \u201cradical vegan agenda using fur as the first step to other bans on what we wear and eat\u201d.\n\nThe ban comes after numerous fashion designers have announced they would stop working with animal fur, including Versace, Gucci and Giorgio Armani.\n\nAlso on Saturday, Mr Newsom signed a law that bans the trophy hunting, trapping or killing of bobcats, adding them to the list of protected species in the state.\n\nRead more\n\nEvery fashion brand that has banned fur: From Chanel to Burberry", "description": "California has become the first US state to ban the sale and manufacture of new fur products.On Saturday, California\u2019s governor Gavin Newsom signed a bill into law to prohibit residents from making or selling items such as clothing, shoes or handbags made of fur.", "authors": ["Chelsea Ritschel"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/fAawIKglzB044FSsG5YWlQ--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/b745760098f3210ffa02a792bb26647f", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
