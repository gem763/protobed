On Tuesday, Andr\u00e9s and his team flew by helicopter to the Abaco Islands, where they aim to deliver thousands of meals in the days to come.\n\nAlthough he became famous for his avant-garde cooking, Andr\u00e9s is now making his name in disaster relief. Since its founding in 2010, World Central Kitchen has served meals in the wake of natural disasters around the world. \"60 Minutes\" was with the organization in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria devastated the island in 2017.\n\n\"The problem was the urgency of now,\" Andr\u00e9s told Anderson Cooper in 2017. \"It's a very simple thing when you're a cook. When you're hungry, you gather the food, you gather your helpers, you begin cooking, and then you start feeding people.\"\n\nAndr\u00e9s and his team of volunteers made more than 100,000 meals a day in Puerto Rico. In the Bahamas, Andr\u00e9s told \"60 Minutes\" Overtime that current relief efforts are aided by the fact that the islands are smaller. In Puerto Rico, the damage was widespread, and much of it occurred inland, which was more difficult to access.", "description": "\"60 Minutes\" got a look at how the chef and an army of volunteers serve hurricane victims after Maria devastated Puerto Rico in 2017", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/11/26/0bf046b6-afdf-459b-a0f2-58b79bf990dc/thumbnail/1200x630/157b48faad29ce1d159a9112517dd5b9/prmain.jpg"}
