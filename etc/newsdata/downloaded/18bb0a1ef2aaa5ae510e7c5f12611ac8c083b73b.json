The guest of honor, the late Atlantic book critic Christopher Hitchens, tugged liberally on his drink and gave a speech about how the holiday season was oppressive (\u201clike living in fucking North Korea\u201d). Then near the height of his powers as an anti-theist pamphleteer, Hitchens led the crowd in a tuneless rendition of Tom Lehrer\u2019s \u201cA Christmas Carol,\u201d before slipping away and leaving the guests to the open bar and the mistletoe. Among those guests was a figure from my past. I had not seen Richard Spencer in more than 10 years. He was not yet known as our generation\u2019s most prominent white supremacist. I remembered him as my eighth-grade-chemistry lab partner and high-school classmate. We spotted each other and walked closer, circling uncertainly for a few seconds, before he spoke my name and confirmed that a wormhole had indeed opened from late-1990s North Dallas.\n\nSpencer must have sensed my surprise (I would have sooner expected to see our gym teacher at a Washington magazine party). He told me he had blossomed intellectually since high school. Then he asked me what I thought of Hitchens\u2019s fulminations against God. I had no interesting opinion on the subject. But Spencer did. Was Hitchens\u2019s critique of Christianity, he said, not as wan and naive as Christianity itself? Christianity had bound together the civilizations of Europe, and now Hitchens wanted to replace it with\u2014well, what exactly? American neoliberal internationalism? Why should anyone care if Christianity was irrational and illiberal, when rationality and liberalism had never been its purpose? Hitchens had missed the point. Spencer longed for something as robust and binding as Christianity had once been in the West. Spencer wasn\u2019t exactly defending Christianity; he said that he, like Hitchens, was an atheist. But he longed for something as robust and binding as Christianity had once been in the West, before churches surrendered their power to folk-singing liberals and televangelists. I think Spencer knew he had me at a loss, because he curled out a smile and let his point hang in the air. I was flummoxed by his argument, a more thoughtful Nietzschean critique than I was prepared to take on\u2014and by the unnerving fact that the kid who\u2019d once cribbed my chemistry notes now had something to say.\n\nSpencer invited me to join a discussion group he was organizing, the Robert Taft Club. I was wary when he evaded my questions about the politics of his club. He seemed reluctant to reveal too much, too soon. I made a point to lose his business card (he was the literary editor of The American Conservative, it said) and forget about him, as I had 10 years before. For most of the 25 years we have known each other, my attitude toward Spencer was indifference. He arrived at St. Mark\u2019s School of Texas, our Dallas all-male prep school, in eighth grade. We shared a home-room adviser and both took Latin, which he pronounced, with a verbal tic that persists today, as if the middle consonant were a d, as in the name Aladdin. Spencer passed his classes but didn\u2019t excel. He played baseball and football, but you wouldn\u2019t have gone to games to see him play. I remember little to admire and little to despise\u2014other than, perhaps, the featureless mediocrity he represented to my ambitious teenage self. When I graduated, in 1997, having won admission to the Ivy League and achieved escape velocity from the Dallas suburbs, it was the mediocrity of Richard Spencer that I was insufferably proud to have left behind. But after the Christmas party, my indifference slowly gave way to a surreal curiosity, on its way to loathing. I monitored his activities, distantly. Spencer\u2019s writing kept appearing, advancing ever more extreme opinions in ever more obscure journals. In 2008, he began popularizing the term alt-right. On Facebook, he posted images of himself with John Derbyshire\u2014a polymathic, often charming writer who was fired from National Review in 2012 for racism\u2014and Richard Lynn, an English psychologist who has argued that East Asians are slightly smarter than whites, who are in turn much smarter than blacks. Spencer hosted Ron Paul, then not yet widely known to have published antiblack screeds in the 1980s and \u201990s, at his discussion club.\n\nIn 2011, he moved from Washington to Whitefish, Montana, where his mother owns a vacation home and a commercial building. (She is the heiress to cotton farms in Louisiana, and his father is a respected Dallas ophthalmologist.) There he edited and published a new online magazine, Alternative Right, and soon took over the National Policy Institute. Founded in 2005 by William Regnery II, of the conservative Regnery publishing family, NPI is a white-identity think tank with little money and virtually no staff. During the next five years, Spencer merged its mission with his own. It remained essentially a one-man operation\u2014the Whitefish house owned by Spencer\u2019s mother is listed in official filings as NPI\u2019s principal office, and its 2015 IRS filing shows that Spencer drew just $13,275 in salary and was the only paid employee. Still, under Spencer\u2019s direction, NPI put on two conferences and published two books that year. Alternative Right showed signs of erudition. It was not the product of the same Spencer I had known in high school, who\u2019d managed to misquote Shakespeare (\u201cA poor player who struts and frets his hour upon the stage, then heard no more\u201d) and misspell the name of a SportsCenter anchor (\u201cCraige Killborne\u201d) on his yearbook page. The magazine\u2019s racism and sexism were expressed with good grammar and a coherent view of the world. That view, now well known as the platform of the alt-right, can be summarized as white European cultural and racial supremacy, with a deep contempt for democracy. An active comment section revealed the site\u2019s id: Many of the commenters\u2019 profile photos featured the double-rune insignia of the SS. When Donald Trump began adopting alt-right themes during his presidential campaign, Spencer threw him his support. On August 25, 2016, in a scripted campaign speech, Hillary Clinton said that the Trump campaign didn\u2019t represent \u201cRepublicanism as we have known it.\u201d Controlling his campaign, she said, was \u201can emerging racist ideology known as the alt-right.\u201d With one major-party presidential nominee using his nomenclature, and the other accused of supporting his ideas, Spencer got famous, and he moved into an apartment in Northern Virginia. (He continues to live part-time in Whitefish.)\n\nA number of mortified St. Mark\u2019s alumni conspired to speak out against him. Eight from our class of 69, myself among them, wrote an anti-Spencer statement on a crowdsourced fund-raising website, supporting resettlement of refugees in Dallas\u2014a cause we chose because we knew it would irritate him. By December, after videographers from The Atlantic filmed Spencer receiving Nazi salutes and saying \u201cHail Trump! Hail our people! Hail victory!,\u201d the school community had kicked in more than $60,000. (The school itself denounced the ideas espoused by Spencer\u2014now its most prominent alumnus since Owen Wilson and his brother Luke\u2014though it didn\u2019t name him outright.) Spencer mocked us on his blog, saying that the \u201cBrooks Brothers Brigade\u201d had turned on one of its own. He scoffed at our having chosen refugees\u2014nonwhite and non-Christian\u2014as the recipients of our largesse. We had reacted, he wrote, by deciding \u201cto commit civilizational suicide even harder than before \u2026 If this episode doesn\u2019t express the end stage of wasp decline, I don\u2019t know what does.\u201d His fans concurred. \u201cI suppose from a Darwinian point of view we have to accept that most Whites are no longer fit for survival,\u201d reads the post\u2019s second-most-popular comment. \u201cWe need a Western Purge, a Noah\u2019s Ark moment where the traitors came [sic] be thrown to the niggers to be raped and murdered.\u201d Video: Rebranding White Nationalism When I asked Spencer to meet me in January, before Trump\u2019s inauguration, he showed better manners than his fans. (He denies that he advocates violence.) The front door of his apartment in Alexandria, just outside Washington, is not clearly marked, and even though he had given me the address, I wouldn\u2019t have found it had a bespectacled young man not intercepted me outside, while I was rummaging around trash cans looking for a house number. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d he asked. He had brown hair and a geeky affect.\n\nI wasn\u2019t sure how to reveal to a stranger that I had come to meet Richard Spencer. \u201cI am supposed to meet someone,\u201d I said, so vaguely that I must have sounded like I was en route to a drug deal or an orgy. \u201cDo you have edgy political beliefs?\u201d he asked, looking at me askance. (Yet another bland code word: edgy, discussion club, policy institute, even alt-right itself.) \u201cNo,\u201d I said, \u201cbut I\u2019m here to meet someone who does.\u201d He motioned me upstairs, to a newly renovated yuppie apartment where a television news crew was striking its equipment. The reporter, an Asian woman, stood in the corner and did not introduce herself, uneasy, perhaps, at the thought of exchanging pleasantries with a Spencer associate now that the cameras were off and she wasn\u2019t professionally required to do so. Spencer walked over, carrying a freshly pressed espresso, and said hello. He dresses nattily and today wore a patterned shirt, a wool vest, and a sport coat. He looked like the scion of a Montana banking family, dressed up and ready to film a commercial in a log cabin, assuring local ranchers that their deposits would be safe with him. Only the Reich-evoking fascist-chic (\u201cfashy\u201d) haircut would have been out of place. Once the crew was gone, he and the young man I\u2019d met outside (a \u201cminion,\u201d he called himself) ate lunch with me at a nearby Thai restaurant. The meal was interrupted once, by a young black woman who asked whether he was Richard Spencer, the famous racist. \u201cYes?,\u201d Spencer said, cowering half-playfully. She declared that he \u201cdoesn\u2019t look as mean in person\u201d before walking off. (Because so many of his critics liken him to a Nazi, Spencer often gets this sort of compliment, for the simple courtesy of not mauling Jews or screaming in German in public.) Spencer asked me to leave his minion\u2019s identity out of the story\u2014\u201cI have a \u2018normie\u2019 [conventional] job,\u201d the minion explained, \u201cand I don\u2019t want to get punished for this\u201d\u2014but otherwise kept the conversation on the record.\n\nSpencer began by complimenting my reporting for this magazine on the Islamic State. \u201cYour articles on isis have been popular on the alt-right,\u201d he told me. I winced: Anti-Muslim bigots liked that I had described isis as an Islamic movement, linked to traditions within Islam. \u201cIs that because you hate Muslims?,\u201d I asked. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause isis is an identity movement. Because they have ideas, and because you wrote about their ideas. Also, they are a grassroots movement. They\u2019ve built themselves up fast, from nothing.\u201d I told him I was a leader of the Brooks Brothers Brigade and had contributed to our class\u2019s effort to disown him. \u201cIt was hurtful,\u201d he admitted, to find himself officially reviled by our school\u2019s community. \u201cThey should be proud to have a graduate who is changing the world.\u201d He said that singling him out among alumni, for nothing more than political thoughtcrime, was unfair. He proposed other alumni who deserved condemnation. \u201cI met a St. Mark\u2019s guy who had been a bundler [fund-raiser] for George W. Bush,\u201d Spencer told me. Spencer said that he\u2019d sensed condescension from the man, and had chewed his tongue raw to keep from upbraiding him. \u201cYou led to the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans, and millions in Iraq! Who are you to talk?\u201d\n\nIn his view, the Bush administration had manipulated the country into war. \u201cSpreading democracy\u201d and \u201cfreedom\u201d are, Spencer said, false ideals, distracting Americans from what really matters\u2014namely, a consciousness of their identity as whites with a shared Christian heritage. Spencer fantasized about the reversal of fortune that might come if the fund-raiser\u2019s enemies should gain more power. \u201cIf the alt-right triumphs, we\u2019re going to probably throw you in jail. We\u2019ll hold you guys accountable.\u201d Other targets among the alumni community included Kurt Eichenwald, class of 1979, a Newsweek journalist who had written critically about Trump and the alt-right during the 2016 campaign. Eichenwald suffers from epilepsy, and in December, a Twitter user calling himself @jew_goldstein tweeted a strobe-light gif to him that triggered a series of seizures, leading to temporary partial paralysis on his left side. Spencer blanked on Eichenwald\u2019s name, and both he and the minion laughed as they tried to recall it. \u201cWhat is that guy\u2019s name? The one whom we almost killed?\u201d \u201cNo, no,\u201d the minion corrected him, with the precision of in-house counsel. \u201cWe did not send that.\u201d Spencer revised his statement. \u201cWe collectively almost killed him. Some alt-right shitlord\u201d\u2014alt-right-speak for \u201conline activist\u201d\u2014\u201csent him a meme.\u201d Two months later, @jew_goldstein was revealed as John Rivello, 29, of Maryland, and charged with cyberstalking and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. According to the federal criminal complaint, Rivello wrote, in private messages, \u201cI hope this sends him into a seizure\u201d and \u201cLet\u2019s see if he dies.\u201d Spencer retweeted an appeal to crowdfund Rivello\u2019s defense \u201cagainst lying #fakenews Kurt Kikenwald.\u201d (Eichenwald is Episcopalian.)\n\nSpencer worried about political correctness at our alma mater today. \u201cWhat if there\u2019s some kid at St. Mark\u2019s who is an alt-right shitlord, who has an anonymous Twitter account, posting videos, following me, retweeting me?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to him if he gets discovered?\u201d He looked troubled. \u201cIf you had been overtly racist, the way you are now, back when we were students,\u201d I told him, \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019d have been expelled or sent to the school psychologist.\u201d He said I might be right. In December, the hipster-Marxist magazine Jacobin published an online essay, \u201cThe Elite Roots of Richard Spencer\u2019s Racism,\u201d that sought to understand his white supremacy. \u201cHe represents a common and longstanding (if overlooked) phenomenon: the well-educated and financially comfortable bigot,\u201d the author, Michael Phillips, wrote. \u201cHis blend of racism and elitism represents only an extreme version of a worldview that has long prevailed among the affluent in Spencer\u2019s hometown.\u201d Phillips knows Dallas, but he has Spencer exactly wrong. Still, for purposes of comparison, it\u2019s helpful to describe a worldview that flourished when Spencer and I were growing up there. Sometimes called \u201cgood-ol\u2019-boy conservatism,\u201d it reached its apotheosis in the candidacy of Clayton Williams for governor in 1990. Williams, now 85, campaigned with a cowboy hat seemingly stitched to his skull. An oil-and-gas mogul, he stood for backslapping redneck values\u2014limited government, satisfaction with the social status quo of 1957 or so, and Texas pride. Williams\u2019s campaign tanked in part because he joked openly, in front of reporters, that rainy weather is like rape\u2014sometimes you just have to \u201crelax and enjoy it.\u201d (How tender were our sensibilities then, that an election could turn on such a quip.) Many good ol\u2019 boys were racist. But they knew that it was distasteful to talk about race too much, and they knew that the correct answer, when asked about it in public, was to deny that it mattered or that it should matter. Williams lost the election to Ann Richards but won the straw poll in my sixth-grade class at St. Mark\u2019s.\n\nAt lunch, Spencer and I tried to think back to the distant land of 1990s Dallas, for memories of our shared education on race. Our class was mostly white, with a few Asians and Hispanics and a lone black student. I was one of a very small number of students of mixed race (half-Asian, half-white, in my case). Our school had hired multicultural facilitators to lead workshops on prejudice, we recalled, so at some official level we had been taught the racial dogma of \u201990s liberalism. I wondered whether Spencer had reacted rebelliously, becoming racist out of irritation at the clich\u00e9s of the era. But he remembered these sessions less clearly than I did and seemed, if anything, less annoyed by their memory than I was. (I had found the facilitators condescending.) Spencer was, however, also less sensitive to the actual racism common at St. Mark\u2019s and other elite institutions in Dallas back then. He could not recall in any detail the occasional prejudice, racial lampooning, or social segregation that students of color remember vividly. In 11th grade, a history teacher performed an outrageous Mickey Rooney\u2013esque pantomime of the Japanese, to teach us about Pearl Harbor. After a black alumnus, the brother of our black classmate, was randomly murdered while home from Morehouse College, the campus did not convulse with mourning, as it surely would have for a white student. Instead, the reaction was muted, as if the community was unsure what grief about a black student should look like. \u201cI just don\u2019t remember that much from that period of my life,\u201d Spencer told me while we ate.\n\nOf the two of us, Spencer had been closer to John Lewis, our only black classmate. According to Lewis, he and Spencer had been friends. Now Lewis, a businessman in California, is estranged from St. Mark\u2019s because of the school\u2019s slowness to ostracize Spencer from the alumni community. \u201cMy upbringing did not really inform who I am,\u201d Spencer said with a shrug. Then he reconsidered. \u201cI think in a lot of ways I reacted against Dallas. It\u2019s a class- and money-conscious place\u2014whoever has the biggest car or the biggest house or the biggest fake boobs,\u201d he told me. \u201cThere\u2019s no actual community or high culture or sense of greatness, outside of having a McMansion.\u201d He emphasized culture in a way that evoked a full-bodied, Germanic sense of Kultur. In fact, Spencer has joked that he would like to be the Kulturminister of a white \u201cethno-state.\u201d He imagines himself having a heroic role in the grand cycle of history. \u201cI want to live dangerously,\u201d he said. \u201cMost people aspire to mediocrity, and that\u2019s fine. Not everyone can be controversial. Not everyone can be recognized by a random person in a restaurant.\u201d In the fall of 1997, he struck out from Dallas to find his cultural fortunes at Colgate University, in upstate New York. His time there produced even more profound amnesia, and he doesn\u2019t say much about it, except that he starred in a production of Oscar Wilde\u2019s The Importance of Being Earnest. It is not a play especially beloved in Texas bro culture, and classmates who saw Spencer in that period report that he took on a Wildean air, dressing foppishly and affecting accents. (On Facebook last year, one of the card-carrying bros of our class called Spencer \u201cHomo Himmler,\u201d although he quickly apologized for the derogatory use of homo. Spencer denies the \u201cstupid rumor,\u201d widely whispered among our classmates, that he is gay. He is married to a Russian Canadian woman, Nina Kouprianova, who lives with their toddler daughter in Montana.) That Spencer may have experimented with his identity as a young man is hardly surprising or incriminating\u2014he was, after all, still in his teens, and entitled to try on personae.\n\nHe lasted just one academic year at Colgate before transferring to the University of Virginia, where he majored in music history and English. He developed intellectually after a swift kick in the cortex from Richard Wagner and, ultimately, Friedrich Nietzsche, the 19th-century German philosopher whose skepticism of democracy and egalitarianism later made him beloved by the Nazis. \u201cYou could say I was red-pilled by Nietzsche,\u201d Spencer told me. To \u201cred-pill,\u201d in alt-right slang, is to enter a vertiginous spiral of awakening and reassessment. The term comes from The Matrix, in which Keanu Reeves\u2019s character discovers, after swallowing a red pill, that his universe is counterfeit, his fellow humans are enslaved to false dreams, and he himself is destined to free them. The false dreams from which Spencer found himself freed were the dreams of the good ol\u2019 boy, who goes to church on Sunday and does things as his granddaddy did before him. Spencer started off with Nietzsche\u2019s On the Genealogy of Morals, a systematic dismantling of the moral and religious truths of European civilization. Nietzsche saw Christianity as a slave religion, a consolation to the weak. Spencer says that the general effect, an inversion of his moral universe, was \u201cshattering.\u201d\n\nThe influence of Nietzsche may explain why Spencer\u2019s conservatism is not, in good-ol\u2019-boy fashion, merely an attempt to revive a bygone way of life. \u201cSome people in the alt-right are kind of like, \u2018Women go back to the kitchen, gays go back in the closet\u2019\u2014like everything was great in the \u201950s. I don\u2019t believe that at all.\u201d The concerns of conservative Christians don\u2019t interest him. He doesn\u2019t mind gay marriage, and he favors legal access to abortion\u2014partly to reduce the number of blacks and Hispanics. \u201cSmart people are not using abortion as birth control \u2026 It is the unintelligent and blacks and Hispanics who use abortion as birth control,\u201d he said recently on AltRight.com\u2019s YouTube channel. \u201cThis can be something that can be a great boon for our people, our race.\u201d Spencer graduated from UVA in 2001, then proceeded to the University of Chicago for a master\u2019s degree in humanities. He said he studied there with the philosopher Robert Pippin, who \u201cinfluenced me a great deal.\u201d \u201cIt was there I started questioning the fundamental nature of democracy,\u201d Spencer said. (Pippin doesn\u2019t remember him. \u201cI regard his rhetoric and activities as loathsome and despicable,\u201d Pippin wrote to me. \u201cI revere the founding principles of liberal democracy, and want no association with the man.\u201d) At a party during his year at Chicago, he confessed his political leanings to the Marxist philosopher Gopal Balakrishnan, then a professor at the school. Spencer recalls that Balakrishnan gave a professional diagnosis on the spot: \u201cYou\u2019re a fascist.\u201d\n\nAmericans dismayed by their country\u2019s direction have sought exile and renewal in Europe many times: Think of John Reed\u2019s migration to Bolshevik Russia in 1917, or Ezra Pound\u2019s flight from America\u2019s \u201cbotched civilization\u201d to Mussolini\u2019s Italy. In the early 2000s, Europe far surpassed America in right-wing innovation, and when Spencer arrived in Germany in 2002, he landed on a continent pregnant with multiple nationalist, anti-immigrant groups: Vlaams Belang in Belgium, the National Front in France, J\u00f6rg Haider\u2019s parties in Austria. He spent parts of the next few years studying German on the banks of the Chiemsee, a lake southeast of Munich; working as a gofer at the Bavarian State Opera; and reading widely in German literature and history. Among the German ideas he adopted was a concept of race different from the one he and I had been taught in our multicultural workshops in the \u201990s. In the modern era, American discussion of race has limited itself, by convention, to a few canonical categories: black, white, Asian, American Indian, Hispanic. \u201cRace isn\u2019t just color,\u201d Spencer told an audience in December. \u201cColor is, in a way, a minor aspect of race.\u201d For Spencer, race is more akin to the German Volksgeist, literally \u201cthe spirit of a people.\u201d Volksgeist is associated, historically, with Johann Gottfried von Herder (1744\u20131803), and Germans became enchanted with it during the 19th century. Some would say the Second World War was the culmination of German devotion to their own Volksgeist. Herder\u2019s followers proposed that each people has an essence that distinguishes it from others. Germans are not French; French are not Zulus; Zulus are not Koreans. The idea was adopted by the black American scholar W. E. B. Du Bois (1868\u20131963), who traveled to Germany at the same age as Spencer and drank his philosophy of race from the same Teutonic fountains: The history of the world is the history, not of individuals, but of groups, not of nations, but of races, and he who ignores or seeks to override the race idea in human history ignores and overrides the central thought of all history. What, then, is a race? It is a vast family of human beings, generally of common blood and language, always of common history, traditions and impulses, who are both voluntarily and involuntarily striving together for the accomplishment of certain more or less vividly conceived ideals of life. Spencer told me the Volksgeist he advocated was that of white Christendom, a group with indistinct geographical borders, but roughly including European peoples, from Iberia to the Caucasus, who were Christian as of a few hundred years ago. I proposed that this understanding of \u201cwhite European culture\u201d seemed arbitrary. It ignored the divisions that European identity movements found crucial. He suggested that any concept of identity could be knocked down if overanalyzed, and overanalysis would only lead to inaction. \u201cI could just sit here masturbating in my own filth,\u201d he said, probably rhetorically.\n\nThe importance of identity creation for Spencer cannot be overstated. It is why every black-on-white rape must be portrayed as the ravishing of all white womanhood, and every Syrian orphan who moves into an American city as the general of a colonizing army. I asked whether I, as someone who is half-Chinese but had a classical Western education, would fit within his group, and he hedged, impishly. \u201cI\u2019m a generous guy,\u201d he told me. \u201cIf you truly identify with our people, I would not have any problem with that.\u201d But there were genetic deal breakers. \u201cA full-blooded African, no matter how wonderful he might be\u2014I\u2019m not sure that would really work.\u201d The other German forerunner Spencer claims is Carl Schmitt (1888\u20131985), who was, for a time, the court political philosopher of the Third Reich. Schmitt\u2019s work has enjoyed a renaissance recently, and even liberals have found it useful, in part as a worthy oppositional philosophy that has forced them to improve their own. Spencer is hardly Schmitt\u2019s heir. But his reading of Schmitt is fair and reasonably nuanced. \u201cThere\u2019s this notion of parliament as an \u2018endless debate,\u2019 \u201d Spencer explained over lunch. Liberalism accepts that disagreement is part of the political process, and that people who disagree profoundly can live together. But eventually, Schmitt argued, the parliamentary debate does end, and someone gets his way while someone else does not. The state\u2019s job is to provide not the coffeehouse for the debate, but the threat of a beating to compel the loser to accept the result. \u201cPolitics is inherently brutal,\u201d Spencer told me. \u201cIt\u2019s nonconsensual by its very nature. The state is crystallized violence.\u201d\n\nTo this already dangerous political philosophy Schmitt eventually added a further provocation. Given that debate, procedure, and politics all end in the same place\u2014crystallized violence\u2014what or whom should the violence serve? The answer, he said, is some group of close affinity. And the groups with the most full-bodied affinity, a common mythology and experience, are races. \u201cThe idea of the ethnic identity will pervade and dominate all our public law,\u201d Schmitt wrote in 1933, and he was just getting started. Within a few years, he was defending the nearly complete annihilation of law and politics as the F\u00fchrer\u2019s prerogative as champion of the German race. In times of emergency, Schmitt argued, the leader can declare the law null (he called this a \u201cstate of exception\u201d) and use force at will to serve the state. The upshot of this philosophy is, in Spencer\u2019s interpretation, to devalue the homespun truths that have united America\u2019s political parties for decades. Good ol\u2019 boys, neoconservatives, and liberals all honor democracy, freedom, markets, human rights, and various other abstractions. To Spencer, these are idols, and their twilight is upon us. \u201cObviously, German National Socialism is not something that has any direct relationship with what I\u2019m doing right now,\u201d Spencer told me. That was horseshit, but I let him continue. Nazis were violent, he said, and \u201cthat is not something that I would have anything to do with. I\u2019ve never advocated that or ever glorified that. I am a dissident intellectual. I am not in charge of the police force or the Army. I\u2019m not ordering the roundup of anyone and throwing them into camps.\u201d\n\nThere is the small matter of his aesthetic, starting with the famous fashy haircut. One might, with exceptional charity, attribute the haircut to a trollish desire to get his enemies worked up. But hair aside, his appropriation of Nazi tropes is relentless. In his notorious speech that ended in a roomful of fascist salutes, for instance, he referred to the mainstream media as the \u201cL\u00fcgenpresse\u201d (\u201clying press\u201d), a Nazi-era smear against anti-Hitler media, even if Spencer flubbed the pronunciation. Spencer sees American values as something not to restore, but to replace. His \u201cHail Trump\u201d speech describes a diseased country. More to the point, Spencer\u2019s ideas themselves are Nazi to the core, and he knows it, even if many of his followers do not. Hitler, too, viewed politics as a struggle and disdained those who imagined it instead as cooperative. For his own race he envisioned a special destiny, like that of an apex predator, expanding its territory until it occupied the land nature intended for it. Here is Spencer, in that same \u201cHail Trump\u201d speech, on the destiny of whites: To be white is to be a striver, a crusader, an explorer and a conqueror. We build, we produce, we go upward \u2026 For us, it is conquer or die. This is a unique burden for the white man, that our fate is entirely in our hands. And it is appropriate because within us, within the very blood in our veins as children of the sun, lies the potential for greatness. That is the great struggle we are called to. We are not meant to live in shame and weakness and disgrace. We were not meant to beg for moral validation from some of the most despicable creatures to ever populate the planet. We were meant to overcome\u2014overcome all of it. Because that is natural and normal for us. Because for us, as Europeans, it is only normal again when we are great again. Thwarting the competition among races, Hitler proposed in Mein Kampf, was a cavalcade of abstractions: justice, human rights, democracy, communism, capitalism. Spencer mocks these same abstractions as shibboleths of the modern age. Members of the mainstream right, he said in a December 2016 speech, \u201ctalk about global capitalism, and free markets, and the Constitution, and vague Christian values of some sort. But they never ask that question of Who are we? They never ask that question of identity.\u201d His \u201cHail Trump\u201d speech describes the concepts that are now designated \u201cproblematic\u201d and associated with whiteness\u2014power, strength, beauty, agency, accomplishment. Whites do and other groups don\u2019t \u2026 We don\u2019t exploit other groups. We don\u2019t gain anything from their presence. They need us, and not the other way around. These are among the most orthodox Nazi statements ever uttered by an American public figure.\n\nSpencer wears a permanent naughty grin, as if he is getting away with something. In a sense, he is: There are vanishingly few true Nazis in this country, and few people believe everything Spencer believes. And yet he has become a beacon to those resentful of the direction of American society and of their own lives. That grin is the grin of a man who cannot believe his luck at being a fascist just at fascism\u2019s moment of American ascent. The American right has had extreme fringes for some time, operating on low radio frequencies and languishing in obscurity. Perhaps the best known of these was the John Birch Society, founded in 1958 as a dying wheeze of McCarthyism. But the Birchers existed to vanquish communism. Individual members were racist, but the society\u2019s leaders tolerated blacks and Jews willing to rail against the Reds. (George Schuyler, a former official of the NAACP, was a member.) The Birchers were twisted patriots, and in their patriotism they resemble mainstream conservatives (think Clayton Williams, but also George W. Bush) much more closely than they resemble Spencer. Spencer emerges from a darker tradition, one that sees American values as something not to restore, but to replace. His \u201cHail Trump\u201d speech, even more than Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d inaugural address, described a diseased America, its culture mired in \u201cfilth\u201d and its cities \u201crotted.\u201d He nodded to the Founding Fathers and the disapproval they would cast on modern America\u2014but only to note that their ideals clash with present-day liberalism, and not to suggest that their ideals are his own.\n\nNo census of the alt-right exists. The movement, such as it is, may have come together and found public expression in part because of the internet, where its followers can amass and reinforce one another\u2019s pathologies. But clearly a few of its claims have acquired special salience, all at once. The world may be no more complicated now than it was in the past, but exposure to more aspects of it has proved disorienting to many Americans. Far-off wars and economies determine, or seem to determine, the fates of more and more people. Government has grown so complicated and abstract that people have come to doubt its abstractions altogether, and swap them for the comforting, visceral truths of power and identity. Meanwhile, religion has faded. Hitchens would have said that\u2019s for the best. But at the Christmas party, Spencer was right about religion\u2019s power. It exerted a binding force and sense of purpose on its followers, and in its absence, the alt-right is delighted to supply values and idols all its own. Related Story The American Climbing the Ranks of ISIS It is impossible to hear Spencer or Trump speak about the \u201cfilth\u201d and \u201ccarnage\u201d of America without sensing that many of their followers consider the whole American project discredited. Spencer\u2019s is only one philosophy offering itself as an alternative. As we talked, I was frequently reminded of John Georgelas, the 33-year-old Dallasite who is now the Islamic State\u2019s highest-ranking American. (I profiled Georgelas in the March 2017 issue of this magazine.) Both men are the only sons of wealthy north-Dallas physicians. They both bloomed late, intellectually and politically, and overcompensated by immersing themselves in books and ideas with gusto uncommon among their bourgeois demographic. Both admired Ron Paul, and both saw their home country as a broken land\u2014and themselves as its savior.\n\nThey are also both young. Trump\u2019s supporters skew old, but the alt-right\u2019s warriors are Spencer\u2019s age (he is 39) or younger. Millennials are rapidly untethering themselves from American values that until recently have been described as bedrock. The political scientists Yascha Mounk and Roberto Stefan Foa have noted that belief in the essential importance of living in a democracy has dropped off dramatically among the young, and support for \u201cArmy rule\u201d has increased to one in six Americans. A generation ago it was one in 16. Perhaps some of this disregard for the cornerstones of modern Western government can be written off as (very late) adolescent posturing. Spencer himself is aware of the hipness gap that yawns between the alt-right and liberalism, to the former\u2019s advantage. The young are suckers for rebellion, and Spencer\u2019s is a rebel movement. Some will age out of rebellion, but others will, like malevolent Peter Pans, refuse to grow out of the fascism of their youth. Spencer expects many of his critics to fall in line once victory comes. \u201cPeople are herdlike,\u201d he told me. \u201cThere\u2019s a story about a Bolshevik agitator who was always getting harassed and beaten up by a policeman in Moscow. Ten years later, the Bolshevik was in power, and the same man came into his office and literally clicked his heels: \u2018Onwards with the revolution, sir!\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe ambition is evident but the path to victory unclear. Spencer\u2019s revolutionaries seem, at present, to consist largely of anonymous online activists. The alt-right has masterfully inflated itself by fielding zombie armies of Twitter accounts\u2014just like isis does\u2014and trolling journalists and others capable of amplifying its collective voice. The closest connection between Spencer and the White House is Stephen Miller, a senior policy adviser to President Trump. In an interview with The Daily Beast, Spencer called himself a \u201cmentor\u201d to Miller. He told me that the two of them worked and socialized with each other as members of Duke University\u2019s conservative union, while Miller was an undergraduate and Spencer a graduate student in intellectual history. (After receiving his master\u2019s from the University of Chicago, Spencer studied for a doctorate at Duke, though he never earned his degree.) But Miller denies any close association between them, and he told The Washington Post that he \u201ccondemn[s]\u201d Spencer\u2019s \u201crancid ideology.\u201d", "description": "Richard Spencer is a troll and an icon for white supremacists.
