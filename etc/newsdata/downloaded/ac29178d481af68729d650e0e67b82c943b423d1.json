Please. Philip.'\n\nSontag, a native New Yorker who died in 2004 at the age of 71, made her mark as one of the most influential American essayists and critics of the past century. After her divorce from Rieff, Sontag began a long-time relationship with photographer Annie Leibovitz, which lasted from the late 1980s till her death.\n\nFunny, sarcastic and knowledgeable, Sontag's work touched upon a wide range of topics, including radical politics. She also authored several novels.\n\nMoser suggests that she also helped pen Rieff's book on Freud, heralded upon its publication and considered a classic to this day.\n\nRieff, who passed away in 2006 at age 83, is better known as Sontag's 'one-time partner than as an intellectual in his own right,' says Gutkin.\n\nThe evidence presented in Benjamin Moser's 'Sontag: Her Life and Work,'includes a damning book inscription Rieff (pictured above, right) wrote, saying 'Susan, Love of my life, mother of my son, co-author of this book: forgive me. Please. Philip'\n\nBenjamin Moser (pictured above) in his biography produces a letter from Sontag to her younger sister which details 'a highly questionable arrangement,' before she married Rieff\n\n'The two met when Sontag was a 17-year-old student and Rieff a 28-year-old sociology instructor at the University of Chicago after a very brief courtship; had a son, the journalist David Rieff; and parted ways (bitterly, by all accounts) after eight years of marriage,' Gutkin writes in his essay.\n\nGutkin notes that Rieff's 'scholarly reputation' rests on the book, which was based on a doctoral dissertation and written while married to to Sontag, and another tome, 'The Triumph of the Therapeutic: Uses of Faith After Freud, published in 1966.\n\nHowever, Moser's biography produces a letter from Sontag to her younger sister which details 'a highly questionable arrangement,' before she married Rieff.\n\n'I will take over most of the book-reviewing that Rieff does for various popular, scholarly journals,' she wrote, promising that she would write the reviews to save him the trouble of reading the books, that he could make corrections to what she had written and submit the writings under his own name.'\n\nA year before The Mind of the Moralist went to press, religion scholar Jacob Taubes wrote to Sontag asking, 'Did you, by the way, relinquish all rights on the Freud? It would be a crime.'\n\nRieff's book inscription emerged later in the 1990s.\n\n'Although Moser acknowledges that, 'at least initially,' Sontag must have worked 'in collaboration' with Rieff, he is so confident that she should be considered its true author that, in his discussion of the book itself, he attributes all of its ideas, and all of the passages he cites, to Sontag,' reports Gutkin.\n\nMoser's assertions about Sontag being the true author appeared to be widely accepted after the biography was released in September. One critic, however, was not so convinced.\n\nBiographer Benjamin Moser in his book, 'Sontag: Her Life and Work,' says Rieff's 'Frued: The Mind of a Moralist,' 'just sounds like Sontag'\n\n'Moser in no way substantiates his claim,' wrote the New Yorker's Janet Malcolm. 'He simply believes that a pretentious creep like Rieff could not have written it\u2026 By Moser's lights, every writer who has been heavily edited can no longer claim to be the author of his work.'\n\nGutkin agrees that Moser was hard on Rieff, 'which leads him to underestimate Rieff as a thinker.'\n\n'The Mind of the Moralist, Moser writes, 'is so excellent in so many ways \u2026 that it is hard to imagine it could be the product of a mind that later produced such meager fruits.'\n\nMoser adds, 'Mind of the Moralist 'just sounds like Sontag.'\n\nGutkin notes one consolation: 'Rieff is at least as well remembered today for his second book, The Triumph of the Therapeutic, as for his first.'", "description": "Susan Sontag's ex-husband, sociologist Philip Rieff, is accused of stealing credit from her for his book, 'Freud: the Mind of the Moralist,' according to a new biography about the famed American critic.", "authors": ["Ralph R.
