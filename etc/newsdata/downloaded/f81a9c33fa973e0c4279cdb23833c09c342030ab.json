He looks into the things deeply which makes him comprehensive. I have played a lot of cricket with him and also against him during franchise cricket. I believe that anyone who performs up to the mark, gets his place,\u201d Mir said.\n\nBeing a leg-spinner, taking place in the national side is not easy following the current tough competition while having the likes of Shadab Khan and Yasir Shah but Mir is focused on what is his strength keeps on putting his influence whenever gets a chance.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t consider anything over my performance. My job is to perform and rest left on the selectors and team management,\u201d Mir added.\n\nTalking about his experience while being a part of the most followed franchise of the Pakistan Super League (PSL), Karachi Kings, he said that it was the biggest opportunity for him to represent Kings in the PSL throughout.\n\n\u201cObviously, Kings\u2019 popularity is notable and I have been a part of this franchise since the first season. I was leading wicket-taker spinner in the second edition so overall a memorable experience with them,\u201d he highlighted.\n\nMir also shared his experience of witnessing the mesmerizing crowd of Karachi during the last eight matches of the fourth edition of the PSL. \u201cKarachi was amazing. It was a special feeling while observing immense passion and love in the stadium,\u201d the domestic performer said.\n\nMoreover, the young cricketer put weight on the importance of participating in foreign leagues. \u201cWhen you come across different cricketers while playing franchise cricket, it gives immense confidence, motivation and learning experiences,\u201d shares Mir.\n\nAustralian leggie Fawad Ahmed and Pakistan-born South African cricketer Imran Tahir are the biggest inspiration for the rising spinner. \u201cI have met Fawad a couple of times and I found him with a very helping hand. Immi Bhai is also one of the biggest motivators of mine as every time I meet him he share his experience with me and try to correct me on my mistakes. In PSL, he used to give me tips about how to bowl a perfect googly and flipper as we all know his expertise in that department,\u201d he concluded.\n\nIt must be noted here that Mir has 16 wickets in 12 first-class matches, 35 wickets in 29 List-A matches and 46 wickets in 50 T20s. Apart from this, he has played several cricket leagues around the world.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Young leg-spin sensation Usama Mir believes in his abilities and eyes the national team's head coach-cum-chief selector Misbah-ul-Haq's attention with consistent performance.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arysports.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Usam.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
