REUTERS/Sarah Silbiger/File Photo\n\nThe nine justices are considering an appeal by the board after a lower court ruled that the 2016 appointments of its seven members violated the U.S. Constitution\u2019s so-called appointments clause because they were not confirmed by the Senate.\n\nThe legal challenge to the board\u2019s composition was brought in 2017 by Puerto Rico creditors including Aurelius Investment, LLC, a hedge fund that holds Puerto Rico bonds, and Uni\u00f3n de Trabajadores de la Industria El\u00e9ctrica y Riego, Inc, a labor group that represents workers at Puerto Rico\u2019s government-owned electricity utility.\n\nBondholders face losses as a result of debt restructuring while the labor group has said the board\u2019s proposed restructuring of the utility\u2019s debt would lead to its members having worse working conditions.\n\nThe U.S. Congress created the board in 2016 to address Puerto Rico\u2019s fiscal crisis.\n\nSeveral of the nine justices appeared concerned about the potential broad ramifications of a victory for the challengers in part because of the effect it could have on other appointees in U.S. territories and the District of Columbia. Justice Brett Kavanaugh described it as a \u201cserious concern.\u201d\n\nThe Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said in its February ruling that board members are federal officers who exercise the power of the U.S. government and therefore must be confirmed by the Senate. The board and its allies have argued that Congress can create positions in federal territories that require Senate approval or can chose not to if the officials predominantly work on local issues.\n\nThey have argued that a ruling invalidating the appointments would raise questions about the lawfulness of Congress allowing people to vote for elected officials in territories such as Puerto Rico as well as the District of Columbia.\n\n\u2018EXCESSIVELY CYNICAL\u2019\n\nDeputy Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall, arguing for President Donald Trump\u2019s administration in support of the board, said that a ruling for the challengers would \u201ccondemn in its entirety\u201d efforts by Congress to give territories and the District of Columbia local control.\n\nThe challengers have said that is not the case but their lawyer, Theodore Olson, faced skeptical questions on that point from the justices.\n\nOlson faced a stinging question from Justice Samuel Alito, who wondered if it was \u201cexcessively cynical\u201d to ask if the creditors had a financial interest in the outcome of the case.\n\n\u201cI mean, you don\u2019t have to answer this if you don\u2019t want to, but there\u2019s no money issue involved here?\u201d Alito asked sarcastically.\n\nThe ruling ultimately is likely to hinge on whether the justices think that the board primarily has control over local issues or is exercising federal power. Several seemed to indicate that they saw the board as being more an instrument of the territorial government, which would favor those defending the current appointments.\n\n\u201cIts focus is on Puerto Rico,\u201d Chief Justice John Roberts said of the board.\n\nJustice Stephen Breyer echoed that sentiment.\n\n\u201cLook at all the powers that the board has. Aren\u2019t they powers that the Puerto Rican government could exercise?\u201d Breyer asked.\n\nThe justice who appeared most sympathetic to the challengers was Sonia Sotomayor, whose parents were from Puerto Rico. She sharply question the board\u2019s lawyer, Donald Verrilli, over the lack of control Puerto Rico has over the panel, which was designed to be independent from the Caribbean island territory\u2019s government.\n\n\u201cIt seems to me that your very argument that it\u2019s independent is suggesting it can\u2019t belong to the territory and that there\u2019s a serious problem that the federal government is creating an entity that no one can control,\u201d Sotomayor said.\n\nA ruling is due by the end of June.\n\nThe White House on June 18 officially sent nominations for the board\u2019s current members to the Senate, which has yet to act. Although the members\u2019 terms ended in August, they continue to serve until they are replaced.\n\nFILE PHOTO: People arrive to attend a meeting of the Financial Oversight and Management board for Puerto Rico, a year after Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico in San Juan, Puerto Rico, September 18, 2018.
