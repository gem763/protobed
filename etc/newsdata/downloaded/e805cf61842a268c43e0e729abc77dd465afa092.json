So grateful for all of you.\"\n\nFans and friends on social media sent well wishes like, \"Praying for a quick recovery and restoration. Blessings and much love\" and \"May your recovery be swift and may you be restored 100%.\"\n\nMathison told \"GMA\" that after years of pain and knowing something was wrong, he made the doctors prescribe him an MRI. He now urges everyone to take control of their health.\n\nAfter he found out about the tumor that had been growing a minimum of 10 years, he called his wife first.\n\n\"First thing out of her mouth, which is amazing to me is, 'We got this, we're going to beat it,'\" he said.\n\nAmazingly enough, the tumor hadn't spread and Mathison believes it's because of his clean lifestyle.\n\n\"I don't drink, eat incredibly healthy, I eat a very low sugar, low carbohydrate diet typically,\" he explained. \"Things that likely in our best guess have have helped it from spreading, and growing even quicker.\"", "description": "After revealing this week that a tumor had been growing in his kidney for more than a decade, actor and host Cameron Mathison is optimistic after surgery.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/cameron-mathison-gty-ps-190913_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
