The pace has slowed from around 13% in late 2017 and early 2018, suggesting the trade war is having an impact on tourism.\n\n\"The slowdown highlights some downside risks to Australia's services sector, including tertiary education, due to ongoing trade tensions with the U.S. and the weakest economic growth rate in almost three decades,\" CommSec senior economist Ryan Felsman said.\n\nThe deceleration was being offset by a record number of Canadian and American visitors, the data showed, largely helped by a weaker Australian dollar.\n\nThe dollar is hovering near a decade low against the greenback.\n\nOver the past year, a record 497,700 Canadian tourists and 189,900 Americans visited Australia. The number of Indian visitors also surged to all-time highs in the year to July.\n\nThe monthly ABS series is an indicator of the health of Australia's tourism sector. The data underlines that steps taken by Tourism Australia to attract high-value travelers from other Asian countries, including India, are bearing fruit.\n\nTourism and education are Australia's third largest exports after iron ore and coal.\n\n\"Spending by international tourists is the lifeblood of many Aussie cities and towns,\" Felsman added.\n\n\"The near-record inflow of long-term arrivals/permanent residents to Australia will continue to support broader economic activity and spending, especially the housing market with its recovery.\"", "description": "Chinese tourists to Australia slow but record Americans head Down Under", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXNPEF8A0G8_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
