Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) after former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton accused her, without evidence, of being a Russian asset.\n\n\u201cTulsi Gabbard has put her life on the line to defend this country. People can disagree on issues, but it is outrageous for anyone to suggest that Tulsi is a foreign asset,\u201d Sanders tweeted Monday evening.\n\nTulsi Gabbard has put her life on the line to defend this country. People can disagree on issues, but it is outrageous for anyone to suggest that Tulsi is a foreign asset. \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) October 21, 2019\n\nSanders joins 2020 Democrats Andrew Yang and Marianne Williamson in expressing support for Gabbard in response to Clinton contending in a Friday interview that the congresswoman is \u201cthe favorite of the Russians,\u201d who was being \u201cgroomed\u201d by the Kremlin as a potential third-party candidate.\n\nAppearing on a podcast hosted by David Plouffe, President Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign manager, the failed presidential candidate claimed:\n\n[Russia] has a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting [Gabbard] so far. That\u2019s assuming Jill Stein will give it up, which she might not because she is also a Russian asset. They know they can\u2019t win without a third-party candidate, and so I do not know who it\u2019s going to be, but I can guarantee you they will have a vigorous third-party challenge in the key states that they most need it.\n\nShortly later, Gabbard \u2014 a combat military veteran and Army National Guard Major \u2014 hit back at Clinton in a series of tweets, slamming her as the \u201cqueen of warmongers\u201d and accusing her of being behind a New York Times hit piece published ahead of last Tuesday Democrat presidential debate in Westerville, Ohio:\n\n\u2026 concerted campaign to destroy my reputation.

It\u2019s now clear that this primary is between you and me. Don\u2019t cowardly hide behind your proxies. Join the race directly. \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) October 18, 2019\n\nGabbard doubled down against Clinton in a video shared to Twitter on Sunday, warning that \u201cif you stand up against Hillary and the party power brokers, if you stand up to the rich and powerful elite and the war machine, they will destroy you and discredit your message.\u201d\n\nHillary & her gang of rich, powerful elite are going after me to send a msg to YOU: \u201cShut up, toe the line, or be destroyed.\u201d But we, the people, will NOT be silenced.
