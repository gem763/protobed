Turns out part of the solution was sitting in the ground and under ocean floors all the while: crude oil.\n\nOil from off the U.K.\u2019s coast, which requires blending -- but no refining -- before being used as a ship fuel, is now being marketed as just that. Similar crudes from places like West Africa and Australia can also be used with little modification. Suitable supplies are ideally low in sulfur and not too flammable.\n\nUsing crude to power vessels isn\u2019t entirely new. Back in the 1980s, oil tanker owners would illicitly run pipes from their vessels\u2019 cargo tanks to their engines, according to Per Mansson, a retired merchant seaman and shipbroker. Provided the engineers on the ships were experienced and knew how to deal with the combustibility of the crude -- known as its flash point -- it was a safe operation, he said.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening now is different. Certain crudes can go -- almost directly -- into vessels\u2019 fuel tanks with very little adjustment. It all depends on a few key parameters, including sulfur content and density of the oil, and how flammable or combustible it is. Rather than going to a refinery, such grades can simply be blended with other products to make something suitable for powering ships.\n\nThe U.K. grade that fits the bill is called Kraken \u2014 pumped from a field in the North Sea operated by EnQuest Plc. Its sulfur content is a little over the 0.5% required under new ship fuel rules, and it will only ignite at a high temperature, making it potentially good for ship fuel.\n\nPositive Feedback\n\n\u201cA cargo has already been sold to a ship owner and thus we remain very optimistic regarding Kraken\u2019s utility in this market,\u201d says Russell Wall, a commercial and marketing manager at EnQuest. \u201cWe have received positive market feedback.\u201d\n\nThat shipment was bought by Euronav NV, which plans to use the crude as part of a mix to produce fuel that complies with next year\u2019s rules. The barrels are part of a massive 420,000 ton cargo being hauled to the Singapore area by one of the biggest oil tankers on the planet, the Oceania.\n\nTraders looking for suitable crudes from which to make ship fuels will typically prefer those that are dense, low in sulfur, and have a high flash-point, said Cosmo Kedros, a senior trading specialist at Vortexa, a shipping analytics firm.\n\n\u201cShipowners are highly motivated by price and not messing up their engines,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they have the infrastructure and the capital to blend their own bunkers -- whether with heavy crudes or not -- they should consider doing it.\u201d\n\nHeavy Sweets\n\nHotbeds of so-called heavy-sweet crudes -- which represent a small portion of the market -- include West Africa, Australia and Brazil. Australian grades have traded more than $10 a barrel above Brent this year, around a fourfold increase versus two years ago.\n\nDifferent types of crudes will be blended in particular ways to meet the marine fuel specification. Kraken, for instance, contains slightly too much sulfur. The Republic of the Congo\u2019s Yombo, on the other hand, is low enough in sulfur but is very viscous, or thick.\n\nOther crudes simply need to be \"topped,\" one of the simplest refining processes where the raw oil is heated until the lighter components are burned off. What remains, with its higher flash point, can in some cases then be used to make ship-fuel.\n\nThere are other challenges, too. Anybody looking to buy crude for blending into a marine fuel will have to compete with a normal refinery that wants to turn that oil into other products like gasoline and diesel. With no certainty on the future price of shipping fuel -- or other products for that matter -- it\u2019s hard to say which will be more profitable in 2020 and so to what extent crudes will be used as vessel fuel ingredients.\n\nAs the world\u2019s shippers gear up for IMO 2020 -- the name of the regulations forcing reduced sulfur emissions -- an armada of supertankers being used to store oil has built up off the coast of Singapore, according to Vortexa. Though the ships are filled with a mix of products, they do hold some crude, showing that it may well have a future as a ship fuel. The giant Oceania will also soon join their ranks.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- For almost three years, the oil industry has been puzzling over how to supply merchant ships with fuel that will meet tough new environmental standards.
