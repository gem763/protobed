Bankers and equity investors are notoriously sensitive about the weighted cost of capital involved in renewable energy. Suffice to say the numbers have stacked up when 50 to 70 per cent of the funding has come from the debt markets.\n\nInvestor enthusiasm for renewables has been helped by a number of factors, some of which were described by Energy Security Board chair Kerry Schott at the Summit. She highlighted the economies of scale achieved in solar panel production because of China\u2019s strong demand for solar PV systems.\n\nThe optimists who believed Calabria and his peers and AGL and EnergyAustralia would provide the solution ... are likely to be disappointed.\n\nOrigin Energy chief executive Frank Calabria told the Summit why there was a lack of enthusiasm for investment in dispatchable power. He said the industry \u201cstill desperately needs a strong market signal to ensure the transition in our energy system happens without creating price or reliability shocks, which ultimately hurt customers\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhat do I mean by that? It\u2019s remarkably consistent with the speakers before me. What the energy system needs is more dispatchable generation \u2013 the right type of generation that operates alongside renewable energy to provide reliable, affordable and lower emissions power.\n\n\u201cWhat there hasn\u2019t been is a signal strong enough to invest into dispatchable generation. It needs to be flexible, which is why you\u2019re seeing the current focus on gas and hydro.\u201d\n\nOptimistic hopes\n\nCalabria\u2019s comments are significant because the handful of optimists out there thinking about a market-based solution to dispatchable power had pinned their hopes on the large integrated energy companies such as Origin providing the capital investment wanted by Taylor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe optimists who believed Calabria and his peers at AGL and EnergyAustralia \u2013 Brett Redman and Catherine Tanna respectively \u2013 would provide the solution by using their balance sheets to finance pumped hydro generation and gas-fired plants are likely to be disappointed.\n\nTaylor\u2019s response to the dispatchable energy problem has been to establish the Underwriting New Generation Investments (UNGI) program, which will provide financial support to firm generation capacity.\n\nThe first stage of this four-year program has seen 12 projects put on a shortlist. These include six renewable pumped hydro projects, five gas projects and one coal upgrade project. Critics say it will be at least three years before these are up and running, which raises the question of what will happen in the interim.\n\nTaylor said UNGI is \u201cbuilding a reserve, with the added objective of increasing competition\u2019\u2019.\n\nThe UNGI program involves support from the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. That itself tells you these are not market-based solutions to the dispatchable energy problem. Nor does the UNGI program deal with the larger problem of the manifest weaknesses in the network.\n\nAs Schott pointed out during her speech to the Summit, the wires that connect the National Electricity Market are too skinny to cope with the two way traffic generated by the expansion in large scale commercial solar and rooftop solar.\n\nUrgent attention\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExperienced project financiers will tell you that the economics of stand-alone dispatchable energy projects do not work under the current combination of federal policy settings, energy market rules and investor risk appetite.\n\nPotential investors in a stand-alone gas peaking unit would demand long-term contracts with customers to make it work. Long-life assets like these need long-life contracts or banks won\u2019t touch them.\n\nThe clear constraint on investment is the ability for investors to forecast long-term variables such as future energy prices and grid capacity.\n\nSchott said National Energy Market rules needed change in order to incentivise investment in firming capacity. She also called for urgent attention on the need for rules to change quickly.\n\nThe market was moving too fast for the systems and processes which were put in place during another era, she said.\n\nShe said one way to encourage the construction of dispatchable power, which can be called upon when renewable energy is not available, is to pay participants to be in the capacity market. But that is not possible under current rules.\n\nProviders of dispatchable power would be paid to have their power made available to the network when the wind is not blowing and there is no sunshine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTaylor said dispatchable capacity is short in South Australia and Victoria, and there were real risks of this happening in NSW.\n\n\u201cIn electricity markets, the cap price signals a need for capacity,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the market is relatively immature and illiquid. The signals simply aren\u2019t strong enough.\u201d\n\nTaylor says that once the Retailer Reliability Obligation is triggered in individual markets, it is likely to strengthen incentives.\n\nSchott said she was surprised the RRO was not triggered during recent interventions in the market by the Australian Energy Market Operator.\n\nIf market-based solutions can be found for the dispatchable energy problem there should be no shortage of superannuation savings ready to invest.\n\nMacquarie says Australian super funds had net inflows of $35.4 billion in fiscal 2019 and have a total pool of nearly $3 trillion in asset ownership.\n\nWith super funds investing more directly in assets and the funds increasingly putting a climate change filter on investment decisions, there is likely to be strong demand for further investment in pumped hydro generation.\n\nAustralia is not alone in needing increased generation capacity. About $US13trillion ($A20 trillion) in investment is expected in new generation capacity globally between 2019 and 2050, according to Macquarie.", "description": "Market-based solutions to funding dispatchable energy to provide the capacity the grid needs are a long way off, say financiers and equity investors.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7936%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_140/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/064976a7ee2e30e8d7e3df74a1327e75d91b2fd3", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
