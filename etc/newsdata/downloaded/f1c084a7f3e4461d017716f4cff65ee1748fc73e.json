(AP Photo/Matt Rourke)\n\nJoe Biden has a go-to line when asked about what he wants to do about climate change as president. It's for voters to look back at what he has already done.\n\nThroughout the 2020 campaign, the former vice president has cast himself as an ardent environmentalist, repeatedly pointing to his long history in government as evidence that he takes seriously the issue of warming temperatures.\n\nBut that record may not be enough for climate activists pushing the Democratic Party even further to the left on climate change. They say the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has gotten so dire that the old Obama administration policies are insufficient for addressing an urgent generational crisis.\n\nThat dynamic was on display Sunday evening when a volunteer for the youth climate group Sunrise Movement confronted Biden in North Carolina about why he decided to no longer oppose the creation of an outside group capable of taking unlimited donations in support of his candidacy. The decision to open the door to super PAC money has exposed Biden to criticism he will be beholden to wealthy donors.\n\n\u201cSince you're now taking super PAC money, how can we trust that you're not fighting for the people profiting off climate change?\u201d activist Lily Levin asked.\n\n\u201cLook at my record, child,\u201d Biden responded. \"Look at my record.\"\n\nThe Sunrise Movement, which has pushed the sweeping Green New Deal climate plan, later admonished Biden for responding to the 18-year-old activist with \u201cfrustrated condescension.\u201d \"It's one thing to say 'look at my record,' ' said Stephen O'Hanlon, a co-founder and spokesman for the Sunrise Movement. \"But we need a president who is putting out a bold vision for this crisis.\"\n\nBiden did embrace the idea of a Green New Deal, which calls for rapidly reducing the nation's contributions to climate change, when he released his climate plan in June.\n\nLily asked @JoeBiden how young people can trust he'll fight for us when he's opened the door SuperPACs, which would allow any amount of dark fossil fuel money to support his campaign.\n\n\n\nHis response: \u201cLook at my record, child.\" \ud83d\ude44 pic.twitter.com/NmpX2B1jUq \u2014 Sunrise Movement \ud83c\udf05 (@sunrisemvmt) October 28, 2019\n\nThis isn't the first time Biden, a veteran Delaware senator before serving two terms as President's Obama's No. 2, has asked voters to check his record. The Democrat has repeatedly pointed out he was talking about climate change before many of his fellow senators.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m one of the first guys to introduce a climate change bill, way, way back in '87,\u201d Biden said in Iowa in May. \u201cI said back in 1987, I said we have an existential threat,\u201d he told a crowd in New Hampshire that same month.\n\nBiden indeed was among the first senators to introduce climate change legislation. In 1986, he introduced a bill directing the president to form a task force on climate change. The legislation was eventually enacted through a 1987 funding bill. Fact-checkers at PolitiFact and the New York Times both rated Biden's claim favorably.\n\nDuring his 36-year career in the Senate, Biden had an overall score of 83 percent from the League of Conversation Voters, which rates legislators on how they vote on various environmental issues, including climate change.\n\nTiernan Sittenfeld, LCV's senior vice president for government affairs, said that many of the votes that counted against Biden's score reflect his occasional absence from the Senate \u2014 either during his previous runs for president in 1988 or 2008 or during his hospitalization for an aneurysm and other issues also in 1988.\n\n\u201cThat tends to lower your score because you miss votes,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen serving as the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee through most of the 2000s, Biden criticized the George W. Bush administration for abandoning an international climate treaty called the Kyoto Protocol. He and then-Sen. Richard Lugar (Ind.), the panel's top Republican, pushed for and passed a resolution asking Bush to go back to the negotiating table.\n\n\"We won't talk about renegotiating that treaty... That sends a message to the rest of the world that, 'Hang on, folks, we consume most of the resources. We're going to continue to pollute. We don't care what you do on your own,' \" Biden told CNN's Wolf Blitzer in 2001.\n\nReengaging the rest of the world on reducing greenhouse gas is one of the planks of Biden's $1.7 trillion climate plan in the 2020 race. Biden calls for rejoining the Paris climate accord and legally committing the country to achieving net-zero emissions by at least 2050, though like many other Democrats he isn't precise how that to accomplish that goal.\n\nBut as Obama's vice president, that administration struggled to create rules designed to curb emissoins at home. Democrats' efforts to pass a cap-and-trade bill, which would have cut emissions economy-wide, failed in 2010, while the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan targeting releases from coal-fire power plants was helded up by the courts.\n\nAt times, Biden has taken environmental positions dramatically different from Obama \u2014 most notably in calling for an end of new oil and natural gas leases on public lands.\n\nYet at other times he has not gone as far as either Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) or Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), his two main rivals for the 2020 Democratic nomination, in trying to wean Americans from the use of fossil fuels. Both Sanders and Warrens have made banning both fracking and the export of fossil fuels part of their climate platforms, while Biden has not.\n\nSunrise's O'Hanlon said the 1986 bill was an important stance \"at that time\" but added that Biden's 2020 climate plan is \"much less ambitious than his rivals'.\"\n\nYou are reading The Energy 202, our must-read tipsheet on energy and the environment.

The Getty Fire in Los Angeles had burned through 618 acres and was 5 percent contained as of Monday evening; there were about 1,100 regional firefighters battling the blaze that had destroyed eight homes and damaged six others, The Post\u2019s Derek Hawkins, Andrew Freedman and Marisa Iati report. The Kincade Fire had burned through more than 74,300 acres in Sonoma County and officials had contained just 15 percent as of Monday night, The Post\u2019s Hawkins, Freedman and Kim Bellware report. Officials say at least 123 structures, including 57 homes, have been destroyed, and about 90,000 structures are still threatened.\n\nWhat\u2019s driving the high winds fueling worsening wildfires: \u201cThey\u2019re hurricane-like winds that transform California\u2019s coastal hills into a hellscape when they catch a spark. And this fall, they\u2019ve been launching a nightmarish onslaught of fires in both northern and southern California,\u201d The Post\u2019s Jason Samenow and Freedman write.

Deputy Chief FOIA Officer Rachel Spector said the latest rules are just part of a plan to increase efficiency. \u201cThe near-tripling in Interior's FOIA backlog reflects, in part, a jump in the number of requests from reporters, advocates and others.
