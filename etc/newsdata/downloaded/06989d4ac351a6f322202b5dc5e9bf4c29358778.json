The bout was subsequently ruled a no contest.\n\nShortly after receiving a call from Mohegan Sun commission chief Michael Mazzulli, Ferguson spoke to MMA Junkie about the issue. He disagreed with the call.\n\n\u201cI thought the fight was fair, and everything went the right way,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cI didn\u2019t see anything wrong with it. \u2026 It was out of my control, so it\u2019s in God\u2019s hands now. I don\u2019t really want to think about it. I don\u2019t even care.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udea8 BABY SLICE BACK \ud83d\udea8@kimboslicejr returns to the cage with the 1st round KO to kick off the #Bellator232 main card. pic.twitter.com/mUl5bwCHE3 \u2014 DAZN USA (@DAZN_USA) October 27, 2019\n\n\u201cBaby Slice\u201d also cited Bellator color commentator John McCarthy\u2019s analysis on the broadcast. The former referee did not believe the shots were illegal. After watching the replay, Ferguson agreed.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t throwing downward elbows,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cEverything was angled to the side. The first one landed to the side of the head, which he dropped from that one. Then as I was throwing the second one, he was already going down. That one kind of landed on the back, but it was still top of the head.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when I heard the referee say, \u2018Watch those shots.\u2019 So I switched it. Then, I landed another one, and it landed on the side of the ear. Then, I switched to hammerfists. So I don\u2019t know, that\u2019s their call. It is what it is.\u201d\n\nDespite having a win revoked, Ferguson said he isn\u2019t fazed. In his mind, he went out there, performed to the best of his ability, and dominated his opponent.\n\n\u201cI still went out there and did my thing,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cI did what I was supposed to do. That was their decision. It was out of my control. I did my job. Even (Mazzulli) said he thought everything was legal, except one of them. He said if they just land one that\u2019s not, they could overturn it.\u201d\n\nOne thing is certain in Ferguson\u2019s mind. He has no interest in a rematch against Campbell. \u201cBaby Slice\u201d believes the Texan wanted out of the fight. Ferguson doesn\u2019t want to run the risk of running into another incident in a rematch.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s just those guys being a sore loser, that\u2019s all,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cIt\u2019s just them being sore losers. \u2026 I wouldn\u2019t rematch him just because of the way about it. So nah, he\u2019ll never get a rematch from me.\u201d", "description": "Kevin Ferguson Jr.'s victory didn't stand upon further review, and \"Baby Slice\" share his thoughts on that.", "authors": ["Nolan King", "Blue Corner", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Mike Bohn", "Farah Hannoun", "Matt Erickson"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/kevin-ferguson-jr.-bellator-232-elbows-from-cage.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
