The D.C. barber had moved to North Carolina for her husband\u2019s job and so successfully remodeled their kitchen that she won a contest in This Old House. Encouraged by the story\u2019s editor to pursue her contracting dreams, she enrolled in a local building program. \u201cI was so nervous on the first day of class,\u201d she recalls, \u201cbut six of the 12 students were women \u2014 I was blown away. I remember an instant feeling of confidence that we had a place here.\u201d\n\nShe posted on Facebook about the number of women in the class, adding, as a joke, #MoveOverBob. \u201cEvery woman I knew fell in love with it,\u201d says Cacace, 32, explaining that the hashtag was inspired by cartoon character Bob the Builder and isn\u2019t about replacing men but simply asking them to make a little room. (In the interest of gender equality, Bob\u2019s creators have since given his sidekick Wendy a promotion to electrical engineer and business partner.) That hashtag would grow into a Facebook page, a website and an Instagram handle featuring photos of women doing demo, laying tile and wielding sledgehammers.\n\n(Double-exposure photo of builder Angela Cacace by Madeline Gray)\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a demand in the field, and women want to fill the void. Normalizing it seemed like a fun thing to do,\u201d Cacace says. \u201cYoung people need resources at their fingertips, and #MoveOverBob has been a great way to find other women. It can get lonely being a woman in construction.\u201d\n\nIn those first years, \u201cI was doing a lot of free work \u2026 while keeping my barbering job,\u201d she recalls. \u201cEven though I\u2019d taken the classes, I lacked the confidence in pursuing paid work. That was the attitude of a lot of the women in the class. The guys were there to get into the workforce, and the women were there to learn with no expectation of actually getting a job when we were done.\u201d\n\nIt took two phone calls, Cacace says, one from a male classmate and friend and the other from her teacher, \u201cboth telling me that they believed in my abilities and I needed to stop working for free, quit barbering and get to work in construction,\u201d she says, before she made contracting her full-time focus. \u201cI still find myself doing work for free \u2014 part of that comes from my customer service background of always wanting to go the extra mile \u2014 but, unfortunately, the other part of it is a lack of confidence in my place in the industry. Like, to make up for being a woman I have to give a little more.\u201d\n\nAngela Cacace: Before she launched her company, A. Marie Design Build, in 2017, Cacace balanced free contracting work with her barbering job. (Madeline Gray for The Washington Post)\n\nAnd even though she\u2019s owned her own company, A. Marie Design Build, for a couple of years now (she launched it in 2017), she still faces pro departments at big-box stores trying to direct her to customer service before she can even tell them she has a pro account. \u201cIt can be deflating to be excited about starting the workday, pulling up with my truck to pick up lumber for a job and then having to deal with condescension. But I\u2019ve gotten better about shrugging it off.\u201d\n\nInspiring women to connect has helped her, too. About a year after launching her firm, Cacace became a mother. \u201cI\u2019d have to leave the job site to find a random parking lot and sit in my truck, covered in dust, and pump. It was pretty awkward,\u201d she says, laughing at the ridiculousness of it all. \u201cBut I remember looking at my phone, seeing women using #MoveOverBob and thinking, Yay!\u201d In that moment, Cacace realized she had created a place where her equally isolated colleagues could connect. \u201cThey were telling each other not to be discouraged, and even asking each other for work clothing recommendations. It was awesome.\u201d\n\nWomen still make up only about 9 percent of the construction industry, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, so the isolation is real. It\u2019s a vulnerability that has also led to intimidation and harassment, even assault. But a new wave of female contractors is creating a community for themselves to fight the loneliness that comes along with being a small minority in the field. They are also hoping to inspire women coming up behind them, to build a support system they don\u2019t feel they had. \u201cThere\u2019s an older generation of kick-ass women,\u201d says Cacace, \u201cbut there\u2019s a generation gap in construction because of a lack of encouragement.\u201d\n\nRachel Street: She began fixing up houses to sell and now has two TV shows. (Daniel Seung Lee for The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cThrough social media I can connect with other women doing the same things; we can exchange ideas and vent about difficult moments,\u201d says Rachel Street, 35, of the Street Group, who started renovating homes in Philadelphia after sinus surgeries brought her back from Italy and a burgeoning opera career. \u201cI fixed up my first house, and people started asking me to do theirs,\u201d she explains. She got her contracting and real estate licenses and started fixing houses to sell. She also got a reputation for cleaning up other contractors\u2019 shoddy work and became an in-demand choice for female and LGBTQ clients who felt safer in her company. \u201cI lean into communities of people who feel that hiring a contractor is stressful,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s different when I come in the door.\u201d\n\nBut the job wasn\u2019t always easy. \u201cI was really self-conscious about being a contractor at first,\u201d she says, recalling changing out of her work clothes before leaving a job site. \u201cPeople look at you differently when you\u2019re covered in dirt. And I felt nervous entering supply houses in South Philly. It\u2019s generations of men-run businesses, and some were pretty rough, pretty disrespectful. It was discouraging.\u201d Now though, \u201cI\u2019ve got credibility and those same guys are my best buddies. They even load the truck for me.\u201d\n\nHer work and Instagram presence soon got the attention of a television producer who contacted her about creating a show. The result was DIY Network\u2019s \u201cPhilly Revival\u201d (she also has a new HGTV show, \u201cPhilly Street Flippin\u2019 \u201d), and it had unexpected reverberations. \u201cI\u2019ve been contacted by women starting in construction. They really feel empowered by seeing the show. It\u2019s all about authenticity and showing as much as possible in the episodes. I\u2019m really there doing it,\u201d Street says. \u201cIt\u2019s important to show women being physical. The more people see female faces, the more normal it becomes.\u201d\n\nThe changes aren\u2019t lost on Sarah Tull, who, as president of the D.C. chapter of the National Association of Women in Construction, has an up-close view of the business. \u201cThe industry has become much more open to women, and I\u2019m seeing more on building sites, in meetings and in the trades,\u201d she says. And it\u2019s a trend reflected in the association\u2019s numbers: 4,845 members across the United States, with 119 regional chapters and six new locations in development. The D.C. chapter alone has grown more than 200 percent in the past four years.\n\nThe association provides a community, or \u201ca safe place,\u201d as Tull, 42, puts it, in a more traditional, face-to-face format, but its leaders hope to begin boosting their online presence. (Staffed primarily by volunteers, most of whom are working mothers, the group has a labor shortage of its own.) Its annual event, Women in Construction Week, is now better known by the hashtag #WICWeek. In the past two years, #WICWeek posts on Instagram have gone from 147 to 1,662.\n\nFemale architects, too, are championing the arrival of more women in the field, especially general contractors. \u201cThe most difficult issue to overcome is people\u2019s misconceptions that women\u2019s work is of less value,\u201d says New York architect Anik Pearson, 47, who has witnessed female contractors repeatedly offer lower quotes than their male competitors. \u201cI want women to prove the misconceptions wrong. And I want clients to pay them a fair price for their work,\u201d she says.\n\nJean Brownhill: The former architect founded Sweeten, a service that matches clients and contractors, and launched an initiative to help female contractors network and gain greater visibility. (Jonathan Hanson for The Washington Post)\n\nFormer architect Jean Brownhill, 42, founder of New York City client-contractor matchmaking service Sweeten, hopes to see the same. Just this summer, she launched the Sweeten Accelerator for Women initiative to provide her roster of female general contractors with greater visibility via its own website, as well as mentorship and educational opportunities. \u201cThere\u2019s a demand for them, and the digital platform we\u2019re building can help distribute work equally,\u201d says Brownhill, adding that the narrative around what a general contractor is needs to change. \u201cA contractor isn\u2019t just a big guy swinging a hammer. The job is more about organization, logistics and the deployment of resources. It\u2019s a great career path for women who want to start families or who have an interest in interior design.\u201d\n\nDenise Hernandez hadn\u2019t considered construction as a career until her father asked her and her siblings whether they would like to take the reins of the family business, Hernandez Cos. in Phoenix, upon his retirement. The company began with her father selling plumbing parts out of his truck in the 1970s, something she helped with during childhood summers. With her now at the helm of its financial side, the firm is 60-employees strong and holds commercial contracts with major clients, including the city of Phoenix, Bank of America, PepsiCo and Sky Harbor International Airport. \u201cIn my role, I get to see both sides of the company, financial and operational,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019d love to see more women in all the trades, absolutely, but also in the offices and on the project management side, like me.\u201d\n\nLately, she, too, has been seeing more women joining the field. \u201cMore and more women are graduating from Arizona State University\u2019s construction program. They\u2019re doing a really good job at presenting construction as an opportunity,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lack of knowledge that it\u2019s even possible for a woman to be a contractor.\u201d Hernandez, 51, is convinced that \u201cnetworking is the number one thing young women should do. Build relationships so you\u2019re not afraid to ask for help.\u201d\n\nDenise Hernandez: She oversees the financial side of her family\u2019s construction business. (Dominic Valente for The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cMy entire office is women who have found me on Instagram or my blog, or by hearing me speak,\u201d says Joan Barton, 51, of Dirty Girl Construction in Los Angeles, adding that even more women have been calling in the past year. \u201cConstruction is intense, but women are really amazing business people. We\u2019re multitaskers, we\u2019re artistic and we can spin our talents into things. There are a million moving parts to building a home, and everything has to be in rhythm.\u201d A former composer, Barton got into the construction business by going to work for a contractor friend when the music industry went digital. \u201cI wrote music for TV commercials. I worked 10 years to get there. Then it crashed. They didn\u2019t need orchestras anymore and I didn\u2019t want to sell out.\u201d\n\nMany of the women calling her have gone through career shifts, too, coming from backgrounds in interior design and architecture but also film, fashion and sculpture. \u201cUsually something I\u2019ve written resonates with them, whether that be my history, my honesty or my perspective,\u201d says Barton, adding that she wants to use her online presence to \u201cconnect and elevate people, and to demystify the process of coming into your own.\u201d\n\nRuth Black of Ruins to Renovation (RTR) Design Build in Los Angeles also found construction as a second career. After a writers\u2019 strike ground film projects to a halt, Black, now 54, fell back on her talent for fixing up houses, something she learned from her parents. \u201cWomen contractors have to be willing to make their own way and to change the trajectory of what men have defined. I\u2019m older, remember; I missed the whole tech thing. I literally just learned there were stories on Instagram and how to make one!\u201d she says. \u201cI wish so much there had been this road map out there for me when I started, to even know that a career like this is possible.\u201d\n\nTo combat her feelings of isolation, Black has embraced a wider community by listening to podcasts such as \u201cOn Being,\u201d \u201cWith Friends Like These\u201d and \u201cThe Tim Ferriss Show\u201d as she travels between job sites, often sitting in L.A. traffic. \u201cRole models are everywhere,\u201d she says. \u201cWe just need to open our eyes.\u201d\n\nCacace is proud of the work she\u2019s done organizing and connecting women to elevate their ranks in the construction industry. But she and other women in the trades say what\u2019s really needed is for trade-skill classes to be returned to schools. After all, the world needs plumbers just as much as it needs doctors. \u201cWe have a culture of college degrees, but it\u2019s just leading to debt. Meanwhile, people in the trades are doing okay. I have to turn work down now,\u201d Cacace says.\n\n\u201cTrades have been pushed to the sides or are seen as lesser options, but right out of school you can start making upwards of $60,000,\u201d echoes Street.\n\n\u201cGet home economics back into schools,\u201d Barton says. \u201cLet\u2019s give kids the skills they need for basic household management: how to fix a drain, how to balance accounts, how to afford their lives. Put tools in their hands and get them outside.\u201d\n\nFor the time being, these women are doing what they can at the grass-roots level.\n\nJoan Barton: \u201cConstruction is intense, but women are really amazing business people,\u201d says the founder of Dirty Girl Construction in Los Angeles. (Oriana Koren for The Washington Post)\n\nBarton is starting \u201cWomen on Women,\u201d workshops for women in construction and other atypical vocations. (\u201cIt\u2019s a chance to tell our secrets, to pass on our knowledge,\u201d she says.)\n\nHernandez is on the board of her local Habitat for Humanity.\n\nCacace, an avid carpenter, hopes to convert her home workshop into a place where she can teach introductory wood shop classes.\n\nBlack is involved with youth-focused organizations P.S. Arts and Covenant House, which respectively provide arts education and shelter services, and gives teenagers job site experience. (\u201cThe kids who don\u2019t sit still, who maybe don\u2019t learn the way our education system teaches.\u201d)\n\nStreet recently worked with trade-skill program Generation T to help kids build doghouses for Boston-area shelters. \u201cThey learned how to cut wood and use a nail gun. It was really interesting to see girls shying away at first but then gaining confidence.\u201d\n\nAnd after reading an American Institute of Architects survey that reported young female architects abandoned their careers in part because of a lack of role models, Pearson, too, is ringing the bell for mentorship with a new seminar series, \u201cWomen Entering the Profession of Architecture,\u201d that connects emerging and experienced practitioners.\n\nIn the face of all the IRL community-building, a hashtag might seem like such a small thing. For Cacace, it was just the start. \u201cI hope young women will find #MoveOverBob and think, \u2018Maybe I\u2019ll do that!\u2019 \u201d she says. \u201cI just want to let people know we\u2019re out here doing it and enjoying it, and that men are supporting us. I\u2019ve been as surprised by men\u2019s willingness to make room for me as they\u2019ve been surprised to see me arrive on a job site. But it\u2019s becoming less of a surprise now. Normalization is power.\u201d\n\nMaile Pingel is a design historian and writer in Los Angeles.", "description": "A minority in their field, women in construction are establishing a support system they don\u2019t feel they had.", "authors": ["Maile Pingel"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/magazine/wp-content/uploads/sites/69/2019/09/construction_share.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
