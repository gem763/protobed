Kay Ivey told reporters Tuesday that she will not resign after audio from the late 1960s surfaced of her then-fianc\u00e9 describing her performing a skit in blackface while attending college.\n\n\u201cHeavens no, I\u2019m not going to resign,\u201d the Republican governor said. \u201cIt\u2019s something that happened 52 years ago and I\u2019m not that person.\u201d\n\nIvey was forced to issue an apology last week when the audio from a 1967 radio interview came out in which her then-fianc\u00e9, Ben LaRavia, playfully recalled her blackface performance at Auburn University. In the interview, LaRavia said Ivey wore \u201cblue coveralls\u201d and \u201cblack paint all over her face.\u201d\n\nLaRavia also said Ivey\u2019s role in the Baptist Student Union minstrel show didn\u2019t require much verbal talent, adding that \u201cit did require a lot of physical acting such as crawling around on the floor looking for cigar butts.\u201d Ivey can also be heard in the clip, acknowledging her role in the skit and laughing as she continues telling stories.\n\nAllegations of Ivey\u2019s connection to minstrel shows arose in February when The Auburn Plainsman revealed a photo of Ivey\u2019s sorority sisters wearing blackface for a rush event at a time when she was a senior and served as vice president of the college\u2019s student government. At first, Ivey and her spokespeople tried to distance the governor from the picture, saying only that she didn\u2019t appear in it and didn\u2019t remember the incident in question.\n\nBut the governor\u2019s office changed course when university officials discovered the audio clip while working to preserve old university records, according to AP.\n\nIvey\u2019s office shared the clip along with her apology last Thursday. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, the governor said she didn\u2019t remember the skit mentioned in the radio interview, but acknowledged that she \u201cshouldn\u2019t have done that.\u201d\n\nThe announcement that she won\u2019t resign comes after some state lawmakers and the Alabama NAACP called on her to do so.\n\nOver the past year, public officials in other states have been caught in similar controversies involving their past use of blackface.\n\nEarlier this year, Virginia\u2019s Democratic governor, Ralph Northam, and the state\u2019s Democratic attorney general, Mark Herring, each apologized for having worn blackface in the past. Neither man left office. But in January, Florida\u2019s Republican secretary of state, Michael Ertel, resigned after photos surfaced of him wearing blackface as part of a Hurricane Katrina victim costume for a Halloween party.", "description": "GOP Gov.
