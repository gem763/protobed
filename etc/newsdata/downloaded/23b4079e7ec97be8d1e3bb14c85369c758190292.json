In simultaneously relieving the considerable stress building around Newcastle\u2019s manager and increasing the pressure mounting on Solskj\u00e6r, Longstaff minor lifted his team out of the relegation zone and left the visitors hovering only two points above the bottom three.\n\nManchester United\u2019s manager watched in dismay as his side \u2013 without an away win since March \u2013 exhibited an almost painful lack of invention, improvisation and incision in the course of another horribly ponderous, at times almost slow motion performance, in the north-east rain.\n\nNewcastle 1-0 Manchester United: Premier League \u2013 live reaction Read more\n\nLast Sunday night Newcastle had flown back to Tyneside in silence after a 5-0 thrashing at Leicester but a week on it was Manchester United\u2019s turn to endure what must have been an excruciatingly uncomfortable plane ride home.\n\nAt a time when his tenure is being compared unfavourably with that of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s it is hard to envisage Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s Old Trafford reign extending beyond the short term.\n\nNot that Bruce had much sympathy as he celebrated his first managerial victory against the club where he once proved a bedrock of Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s defence. Presiding over his 400th Premier League game as a manager he was not too proud to deploy a gameplan bearing a few of Rafael Ben\u00edtez\u2019s fingerprints.\n\nUnder Ben\u00edtez last season Newcastle thrived in an immaculately drilled 3-4-3 formation and, with Bruce\u2019s attempts to modify that configuration having produced a series of disappointing results, culminating with that Leicester thrashing, he reverted, reluctantly, to the Spaniard\u2019s blueprint.\n\nNewcastle immediately looked radically improved with the excellent Allan Saint-Maximin\u2019s left-sided advances repeatedly ruffling their guests and Matty Longstaff, looking very much at home.\n\nOnly the woodwork came between the latter and a first-half goal after he collected Jetro Willems\u2019 short pass, took a steadying touch with his left foot and then unleashed a sublime right footed 20-yard half volley which ricocheted back off the crossbar.\n\nNot to be upstaged by his younger brother, Sean Longstaff \u2013 apparently targeted by Manchester United last summer \u2013 whipped in a corner for Fabian Sch\u00e4r to head narrowly off target.\n\nManchester United had still to register a shot on target but that finally changed in the 42nd minute when Andreas Pereira directed a long-range effort straight at Martin Dubravka in the Newcastle goal. With Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s players retaining quite a bit of possession yet doing precious little with it, Newcastle\u2019s counterattacking tactics afforded them a much more menacing look. Even so, Bruce\u2019s defence very nearly paid the price for losing concentration at a set piece.\n\nMaybe Manchester United\u2019s recent incompetence at dead balls had lulled them into a false sense of security but the marking was inexcusably slapdash as Harry Maguire all too easily lost Sch\u00e4r before connecting with Ashley Young\u2019s excellent corner. Positioned around four yards out Maguire seemed certain to score but instead somehow headed wide.\n\nIf that represented a reprieve for Bruce, Solskj\u00e6r seemed to be ageing by the minute as Saint-Maximin enjoyed the freedom of St James\u2019 and looked mighty relieved as Miguel Almir\u00f3n \u2013 still goalless in a Newcastle shirt \u2013 seamlessly controlled a dropping ball and appeared odds on to test David de Gea only to hesitate at the vital moment and permit the visiting defence to regroup.\n\nBruce cursed beneath his breath but Marcus Rashford made a much more minimal impact than the Paraguayan, barely touching the ball in a first half when Manchester United\u2019s \u00a3250,000-a-week striker invariably found himself isolated in attack.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A disconsolate Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r waves to Manchester United\u2019s travelling fans after their 1-0 defeat at Newcastle.

By now Rashford had been relocated to his left-wing comfort zone but Carroll had no qualms about assuming the classic No 9 role from where he revelled in discomfiting Maguire and company.\n\nSignificantly Bruce\u2019s self-styled \u201cdivine ponytail\u201d offered important, opponent disrupting, nuisance value at a pivotal juncture in which the power balance seemed to finally be tilting towards an almost imperceptibly improved Manchester United.\n\nNo matter that the closest Carroll came to actually scoring featured a header which whizzed wide his distracting presence served to galvanise teammates and, shortly afterwards, the capricious breeze tugging at the corner flags proved an ill wind for Solskj\u00e6r\n\nLongstaff\u2019s goal was coming and it proved a thing of beauty both individually and collectively with Saint Maximin and Willems deploying speed, skill and sheer cunning to take out an assortment of visiting markers before Willems cut-back for the debutant to shoot crisply and cleanly beyond De Gea before promptly bursting into tears. The blend of unbridled joy and sheer relief etched across Bruce\u2019s face confirmed that a week really can be a very long time in football while Manchester United fans felt like crying themselves.\n\nWhen Manchester United had an even worse start to the season ... in 1989 Read more", "description": "Matty Longstaff, 19, scored a brilliant late winner from 22 yards on his Premier League debut, as Newcastle beat Manchester United 1-0", "authors": ["Louise Taylor"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/542ff04b74141944aac9813d05c34f6cd535db9c/0_122_4553_2732/master/4553.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0d0e03d3f2d5038ea972ff5791be2e51", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
