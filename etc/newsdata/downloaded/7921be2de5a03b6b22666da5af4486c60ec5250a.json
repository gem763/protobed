He is putting together a tour schedule right now. He wants to start the tour as soon as possible.'\n\n'He is in [a] much better place mentally than he was during his last tour,' the source continued.\n\nThe father-of-four canceled his Saint Pablo tour back in 2016 just before he was hospitalized for exhaustion.\n\nSunday service: The Kardashian and Jenner family joined together for the musical event\n\nBut while Kanye may be ready to hit the road, his famous reality star wife may have a few objections.\n\n'Kim supports a tour, but still has concerns,' the source revealed.

She wants him to focus on his well-being and mental health too.'\n\nCurrently, West is out promoting the album and held his Sunday Service in Los Angeles where the Kardashian clan made an appearance as well as Kendall Jenner and Kris Jenner.\n\n'I've spread a lot of things,' he said during an interview with Zane Lowe on Beats. 'There was a time I was letting you know what high fashion had done for me, I was letting you know what the Hennessy had done for me, but now I'm letting you know what Jesus has done for me, and in that I'm no longer a slave, I'm a son now, a son of God. I'm free.'", "description": "Kanye West just released his latest album Jesus Is King on Friday.
