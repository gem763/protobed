He will be processed by police after which he has the right to bail and defend himself in court.\u201d\n\nManning said that police had made contact with O\u2019Neill at the hotel where he was staying and asked him to accompany them to a police station to be processed but the former prime minister had not complied with the request.\n\n\u201cAs we speak he has refused to cooperate with police thus far,\u201d said Manning.\n\nThe warrant was confirmed to the Guardian by Bryan Kramer, PNG\u2019s police minister and a key anti-corruption campaigner, who told the Guardian earlier this year that he expected O\u2019Neill would not finish serving his term as an MP, but would be \u201carrested and prosecuted\u201d.\n\nSpeaking to the Guardian on Tuesday, after news of the arrest warrant was reported, Kramer said O\u2019Neill was refusing to cooperate with police.\n\n\u201cIt is disturbing to hear a former prime minister avoiding arrest by hiding out in a hotel room and refusing to cooperate with police in complying with the court-ordered warrant of arrest.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Neill came to power in 2011.\n\nHe stepped down as leader of the country in May after months of political turmoil, and the parliament voted overwhelmingly to replace him with James Marape.\n\nMore to come\u2026", "description": "Charges allege O\u2019Neill, who was replaced in May, took part in \u2018official corruption\u2019", "authors": ["Kate Lyons"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5353bd796dbccecb516e06e581d15d648a4674b9/0_389_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f011304049995f1f83f53b6d5d784ca9", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
