I don\u2019t know what it is yet. I\u2019m studying the typical stuff \u2014 Math, English, History... I don\u2019t know what I have to do but I know it\u2019s something.\u201d\n\nGauff shot to fame this year when she became the youngest player to qualify for the Wimbledon main draw in the Open era and reached the fourth round, beating veteran Venus Williams along the way.\n\nThe American was fortunate to advance to the second round of the Linz Open after getting a lucky loser draw less than an hour before Tuesday\u2019s match was set to begin.\n\nGauff will become the only player under the age of 18 in the top 100 when the rankings are updated on Monday. She is also in the doubles semi-finals in Linz, partnered with 17-year-old compatriot Caty McNally.", "description": "American teenager Coco Gauff stunned top seed Kiki Bertens to advance to her maiden WTA semi-final with a 7-6(1) 6-4 victory at the Linz Open in Austria on Friday, then went back to her hotel to do her schoolwork.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439801026&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A1WO-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
