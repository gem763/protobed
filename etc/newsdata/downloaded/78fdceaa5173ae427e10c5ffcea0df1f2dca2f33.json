Gerald Connolly of Virginia and Jamie Raskin of Maryland wrote on Wednesday as leaders of subcommittees on civil rights and civil liberties and on government investigations to implore the Trump administration to investigate allegations of financial fraud at the NRA.\n\n\u201cPublic reporting of self-dealing, private inurement of earnings, and possible financial fraud on the part of the NRA and its senior leadership represent serious allegations that demand an independent allegation by the IRS,\u201d Mr. Connolly and Mr. Raskin wrote to IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig.\n\nThe House Democrats pointed to news reports and NRA tax filings to suggest that nearly a quarter of the NRA\u2019s 76-member board had received payments from a 501(c)(4) organization the board members had oversight over, which the Democrats note is prohibited by the Internal Revenue Code.\n\n\u201cThe IRC expressly prohibits excess benefit transactions (transactions exceeding fair market value) between social welfare organizations and disqualified persons, such as board members,\u201d Mr. Connolly and Mr. Raskin wrote to the Justice Department. \u201cIf these transactions exceeded fair market value and were not reported by the organization or the involved board members on an IRS Form 4720, they appear to threaten the tax-exempt status of the NRA.\u201d\n\nThe request for a criminal investigation is the latest headache for the NRA, which has faced mounting legal woes for several months. District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine launched an investigation of the NRA in July, soon after New York attorney general Letitia James began investigating the gun-rights group.\n\nLawyers for the NRA did not immediately provide comment on the Democrats\u2019 letters Wednesday.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
