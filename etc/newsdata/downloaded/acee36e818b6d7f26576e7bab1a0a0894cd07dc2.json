The former spring out of their seat upon arrival at their destination, fresh-faced, clear-eyed and ready to throw themselves into the ways of a new country and culture.\n\nThe latter drag themselves sluggishly down the aisle, struggling to perform even the simplest of tasks, such as using the passport machine at security or articulating whether they\u2019re here for \u201cbusiness or pleasure\u201d.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIf you happen to be one of these unfortunate souls, the start of any long-haul trip can quickly unravel as, both sleep-deprived and jet lagged, you\u2019re barely able to function for at least 72 hours. But fear not \u2013 there are ways and means of securing a bit more shuteye. Here are our top tips for dropping off on board.\n\nGrab a row\n\nWe all know the holy grail of sleep is managing to lie prostrate to create the illusion of being in a bed. Obviously you can guarantee this by stumping up for business class, but if you\u2019re consigned to economy, give yourself a fighting chance by choosing a middle seat when booking. Couples and families are unlikely to go either side of you, preferring to stick together, and if it\u2019s not a full flight you\u2019ll have a greater chance of getting a row to yourself. Pick one towards the middle or back of the plane, rather than at the more popular front end of the cabin.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

If so, ask a member of cabin crew as soon as possible if it\u2019s OK for you to switch and bag yourself some extra leg room.\n\nTop tip: once you\u2019re lying comfortably, make sure you put on your seat belt so it\u2019s visible over the blanket. There\u2019s nothing worse than being woken up by a flight attendant during turbulence to check you\u2019re belted up.\n\nStick to your routine\n\nIt might seem silly, but preparing for \u201cbed\u201d the way you would at home means you\u2019re more psychologically ready for sleep. Changing into pyjamas, brushing your teeth and removing your make-up/washing your face can all get you in the right mindset. If you normally always read before bed, do it now too \u2013 signal to your brain that the \u201cbeing awake\u201d portion of the day is officially over.\n\nGet the right sleeping mask\n\nThere are sleeping masks and there are sleeping masks. As fetching as a faux-satin number with fun patterns might be, this is a practical item with only one real purpose \u2013 to block out the light so you can drift off. Plump instead for a functional black mask, with a soft lining and raised edges to create a truly dark interior.\n\nPut in plugs\n\nJust like a sleeping mask, the right ear plugs can be a game changer; for many people it\u2019s the constant noise of the engine that makes it so hard to sleep on planes. It\u2019s worth trying out a few different kinds beforehand to see whether you prefer the mouldable wax or foam variety \u2013 everyone\u2019s ears are different, after all.\n\nTake your own pillow\n\nIn the event that you have to sleep sitting up, one of those nerdy looking horse shoe-shaped neck cushions is actually very helpful \u2013 a lot more comfortable than trying to fashion the flat-as-a-pancake pillow provided into something remotely sleepworthy.\n\nSwitch off\n\nOverstimulation is the enemy of sleep. As much fun as it is to catch up on all the films you missed at the cinema or play a game on your phone, using devices just before bed means your brain is all lit up like a Christmas tree. Plan when you ideally want to hit the hay and half an hour beforehand shut down the electronics \u2013 instead, do a bit of reading or, better yet, indulge in a 20-minute meditation to really calm the neurons.\n\nEmbrace booze\n\nIf you drink, having a glass of red wine, whisky, or whatever your chosen tipple may be in the hour before sleep can have a soporific effect. However, don\u2019t overdo it \u2013 alcohol can feel like it affects you more at altitude and if you slip over into drunken territory, it won\u2019t lead to the best night\u2019s sleep. Plus having a hangover on a plane is far from ideal\u2026\n\nScent yourself\n\nThe power of smell is more potent than you think. Using hand cream or essential oils which have sleep-inducing properties can help you relax and unwind. Scents that have a strong link with aiding sleep include lavender, vetiver, chamomile, ylang ylang, bergamot and sandalwood. Rub some on the back of your neck and dab a touch on your pulse points for some inner calm.\n\nDrug up\n\nWhile we don\u2019t recommend trying to get class As through security, there are legal, over-the-counter sleep medications which can be helpful. Nytol, Kalms and valerian root extract pills are a gentle way of nudging you off to the land of nod. And if you happen to be passing through the US or Canada, pick up some melatonin from the pharmacy (they don\u2019t sell it in the UK). This hormone is naturally occurring in the body, its main job being to regulate night and day cycles \u2013 darkness causes the body to produce more melatonin, which signals the body to prepare for sleep. It shouldn\u2019t be overused, but pop one on a flight and prepare to drift off effortlessly; then pop another the first night of your trip to help beat jet lag.\n\nNo pressure\n\nIt\u2019s easier said than done, but stressing about not being able to sleep is a sure-fire way of not being able to sleep. Try not to put too much pressure on yourself \u2013 instead just see it as a chance to rest your eyes for a bit. Get comfortable and relaxed, and remind yourself that it\u2019s not the end of the world if you fail to get some shuteye. If you do, it\u2019s a bonus. If you don\u2019t\u2026 well, just hope they\u2019ll accept your answer of \u201cbleisure\u201d as you stumble through security.", "description": "There are two types of people in this world \u2013 those who can sleep on flights, and those who can\u2019t.
