U.S. crude has traded\n\nsimilarly and is heading for its first loss in three weeks.\n\nGloom over the economic impact of the trade dispute between\n\nWashington and Beijing has left investors shrugging off a strong\n\ncommitment from Organization of the Petroleum Exporting\n\nCountries (OPEC) producers to trim output.\n\n\"Again it is a battle between the forces of OPEC and those\n\nof slowing global growth and thus demand,\" said Greg McKenna,\n\nstrategist at McKenna Macro.\n\nThe weak confidence in the markets was reflected by\n\neconomists in a Reuters poll who predicted the U.S.-China trade\n\nspat will worsen or at best stay the same over the coming year.\n\nNearly 80% of more than 60 economists said U.S.-China trade\n\nrelations would either worsen or stay the same by the end of\n\nnext year. The median probability of a U.S. recession in the\n\nnext two years held at a high of 45%, and the chance of one in\n\nthe next 12 months held at 30%.\n\nStill, President Donald Trump said on Thursday he would not\n\nrule out an interim deal with China on trade, though he prefers\n\na comprehensive agreement.\n\nAsian stocks advanced on Friday on the signs of progress in\n\nU.S.-China trade talks, while aggressive stimulus from the\n\nEuropean Central Bank also helped counter worries about a global\n\neconomic slowdown. MKTS/GLOB\n\nIn oil markets, however, concern over whether Trump can\n\nachieve progress on the trade dispute has overshadowed OPEC's\n\nThursday agreement to trim output by asking members Iraq and\n\nNigeria to bring their production back in line with targets.\n\nOPEC is striving to prevent a glut amid soaring U.S.\n\nproduction and a slowing global economy.\n\nOPEC+ has over-complied on average with its agreed cut of\n\n1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) as Iranian and Venezuelan\n\nexports collapsed due to sanctions.\n\n\"With OPEC's production curbs and ongoing constraints on\n\nsanctioned countries, we see the market tightening in Q4 2019.\n\nThis should help stabilise prices,\" ANZ Research said in a note.\n\n\"However, trade tensions and reduced risk of tougher\n\nsanctions on Iran and Venezuela will limit the upside,\" it said.\n\nThose trade tensions are hitting the shipping sector as the\n\nflow of goods and commodities slows, the International Energy\n\nAgency said on Thursday.\n\nThat will lead to weaker growth than previously expected in\n\noil demand from the shipping sector next year despite a shift to\n\ncleaner fuel, the agency said.\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: IEA marine fuel demand https://tmsnrt.rs/2AePjSE\n\nCHART: U.S. oil neutral in $54.64-$55.61 range L3N2640IL\n\nCHART: Brent oil neutral in $59.83-$60.76 range L3N26409G\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n\n", "description": "UPDATE 2-Oil slips on global demand fears despite U.S.-China trade talk hopes", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/indicatornews_2_800x533_L_1412601599.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
