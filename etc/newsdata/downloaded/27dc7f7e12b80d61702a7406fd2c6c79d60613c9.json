He added that neither the president nor his aides raised the issue of an investigation of Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nGiuliani confirmed to the Journal a telephone conversation with Perry that occurred shortly after the inauguration of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Perry told the Journal that he called Giuliani for a clearer picture of Trump\u2019s concerns on Ukraine.\n\nOn Tuesday, a senior State Department official told House impeachment investigators that the White House had designated a three-person team -- Perry, then-Special Envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker, and Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland -- to bypass formal U.S.-Ukraine policy. Sondland is scheduled to testify in the impeachment inquiry on Thursday.\n\nTrial Could End By Holidays, Senator Says (6:01 p.m.)\n\nRepublican senators discussed the possibility of finishing an impeachment trial before the holidays if the House impeaches Trump before Thanksgiving, GOP Senator Kevin Cramer told reporters Wednesday.\n\nCramer said Majority Leader Mitch McConnell briefed Republican senators behind closed doors on procedures for a trial, which McConnell told reporters would be held six days a week.\n\nMcConnell said the trial would begin after noon each day, and senators wouldn\u2019t be allowed to speak during the proceedings. Cramer said the Senate could agree to other rules as they did on a bipartisan basis for President Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment -- an uncertainty in today\u2019s polarized Senate.\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told reporters McConnell should reach out to Democrats on how to handle a trial.\n\nSeparately, Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham -- who served as a House manager of the Clinton impeachment -- met privately with House Republicans to discuss impeachment history and issues.\n\n\u201cThe House Republicans have been closed out,\u201d he said to reporters.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve actually been through this process,\u201d Graham said, adding that the House GOP should get a chance to call witnesses and subpoena documents. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not happening in the House. So, I think that\u2019s a big mistake.\u201d\n\n\u201cStick to your guns and insist on a fair process,\u201d he said was his advice to House Republicans.\n\nEx-Pompeo Aide Says State Didn\u2019t Back Staff (5:26 p.m.)\n\nMcKinley, a former senior adviser to Pompeo, told House committees he resigned last week in part because of the State Department\u2019s failure \u201cto offer support to foreign service employees caught up in the impeachment inquiry on Ukraine,\u201d according to excerpts released by a former colleague familiar with the testimony.\n\nThe excerpt didn\u2019t say which officials he was referencing. But lawmakers who attended the closed-door meeting said he expressed his full support for former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch and thought her removal was unjustified.\n\nMcKinley said he also quit because of \u201cwhat appears to be the utilization of our ambassadors overseas to advance domestic political objectives,\u201d according to the excerpt.\n\n\u201cI was disturbed by the implication that foreign governments were being approached to procure negative information on political opponents,\u201d he said, according to the excerpt. \u201cI could no longer look the other way as colleagues are denied the professional support and respect they deserve from us all.\u201d\n\nEx-Pompeo Aide Backs Ousted Envoy in Inquiry (2:09 p.m.)\n\nA former senior adviser to Pompeo told House impeachment investigators he thought the removal of former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch was unjustified, said Republican and Democratic lawmakers attending the closed-door questioning.\n\nMichael McKinley, who resigned last week, expressed his full support for Yovanovitch, who was abruptly recalled to Washington in May by Trump, the lawmakers said. They wouldn\u2019t immediately say whether he tried to save her job, or whether he said his decision to leave the department was related to that.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Michael McKinley, a senior adviser to Secretary of State Michael Pompeo until resigning the post last week, testified Wednesday before three committees leading the House impeachment investigation against President Donald Trump.Here are the latest developments:Perry Says Trump Asked Him", "authors": ["Billy House", "Steven T.
