Banks and other institutions may also avoid dealings with him entirely.\n\nThe sanction is considered severe \u2013 in keeping with the \"utmost gravity\" of King's actions \u2013 and has reportedly only been used three other times in the 50-year history of the panel.\n\nIn a 25-page ruling a committee of the panel said King had shown himself to be \"someone who is unlikely to comply with\" the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers, which governs financial firms in such business dealings.\n\nThe finding stemmed from \u2013 originally \u2013 King's actions when he acquired Rangers in 2015. King, the panel said, had acted in concert with three others, a group know as the Three Bears, to secure 30% of the voting rights in Rangers. At that point, it held, he was obliged to make a mandatory offer to buy out other shareholders at 20 pence a share. He failed to do so, even after being ordered to, and the takeover panel eventually instituted contempt proceedings against him.\n\nKing eventually made such a buy-out offer \u2013 on 25 January 2019 \u2013 by way of South African company Laird Investments, controlled by a family trust.\n\nThe takeover panel's executive was extremely unimpressed by King's conduct during the saga, and its Hearings Committee agreed to a sufficient extent to blackball him.\n\nKing did not appeal the finding.\n\nIn a notice posted on the Rangers website, King said he had not been able to comply with the offer order because of \"my need to comply with the exchange control regulations of South Africa\".\n\nThe situation around the club takeover \"meant that because of the requirements on me as a South African citizen I was faced with a choice of non-compliance with the Code or non-compliance with the laws of the country that I live in.\"\n\nHis investment in Rangers, King stressed, had been motivated entirely by his love of the club.\n\nBut his involvement in the club could now be under threat. Rangers, BBC Sport reported, is now obliged to inform the Scottish football association of the Takeover Panel ruling. That in turn will trigger a discussion on whether he still qualifies as \"fit and proper\" to chair Rangers.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "A \"cold-shoulder\" sanction from a panel that administers a City of London code of conduct could cause King further trouble, starting with an investigation into whether he is fit and proper to run a football club.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/3496/dfa90129be1b4f7baa84c024dd9632d9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
