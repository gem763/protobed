Roy Cooper's veto of the state budget with a 55-9 vote, while colleagues were absent from the floor during a 9/11 memorial ceremony.\n\nTo override the governor's veto, the Republicans needed to secure a three-fifths majority vote among those present. Local news outlets reported that Republicans in the state had been trying for months to override Cooper's veto and seized an opportunity on a morning typically set aside to honor the 2,977 people killed in the 9/11 attacks 18 years ago.\n\nIt remains unclear where Democrats were during the vote and how many were attending commemoration ceremonies in districts around the state; The News & Observer reported that only one Democrat did so. Cooper also said he was at a memorial event but didn't know whether other members were present.\n\nRead more: Republican Dan Bishop wins special election in North Carolina in a narrow victory against Democrat Dan McCready\n\nDemocrats also said they were tricked by Republicans into believing there would be no vote in their absence. House Minority Leader Darren Jackson said at a press conference that the House rules committee chairman told him the chamber would hold no recorded votes on the floor until 1 p.m.\n\n'You are making a mockery of this process'\n\nCooper told reporters in a press conference Wednesday that Republicans' move was an \"assault on our democracy.\"\n\n\"There is no question about it,\" he said.\n\nHe said voters should be \"outraged that this Republican leadership would orchestrate such deception, such trickery in order to get their way.\"\n\nRead more: Trump held a rally in North Carolina ahead of a close congressional special election.

In a video, Rep. Deb Butler, a Democrat who was present for the vote, could be heard condemning the Republican House Speaker Tim Moore.\n\n\"How dare you do this, Mr. Speaker,\" Butler said. \"Mr. Speaker, you are making a mockery of this process. You are deceiving all of North Carolina. Your leadership is an embarrassment to the history of this great state.\"\n\nButler later told reporters she was threatened with arrest, though the House's sergeant at arms denied that, the NBC affiliate WRAL reported.", "description": "Democrats said they were tricked into thinking there would be no vote in their absence.
