How to tell the difference", "language": "en", "text": "Dear Dr. Manny,\n\nMy kids keep getting sore throats in the winter. I can\u2019t help but wonder. How do I know whether they have strep throat? When do I need to get them tested?\n\nThanks for your question.\n\nNot all sore throats are the same. Some of them are related to allergies, some of them are from colds, and some of them are caused by the streptococcus bacteria.\n\nNORTH CAROLINA SEES FIRST FLU-RELATED DEATH OF 2019-20 SEASON: HEALTH OFFICIALS\n\nYou can\u2019t verify for sure whether you or your child has strep throat without going to a doctor.\n\nA sore throat that stems from a cold usually comes with a slew of respiratory ailments. Runny noses, coughing, sneezing, and watery eyes are all signs of a cold, not strep throat.\n\nStrep comes suddenly. Its symptoms include a sore throat, red tonsils, white spots on the tonsils, pain when swallowing, fever, swollen neck glands, loss of appetite, headaches, and abdominal pain.\n\nIf you have any of these symptoms, check with a doctor, who can do a simple swab to verify. It's important that you treat strep with antibiotics.\n\nStrep is common in all ages, but it happens more in children than adults. It can also be worse in children.\n\nSome kids are more prone to get strep more than others because they have a genetic weakness to Strep A, the bacteria which causes the infection. Typically, those children also developed tonsillitis.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSoothing a strep throat involves lots of rest and fluids. Gargling salt water will help bring the inflammation down somewhat. Eat soft, easy-to-swallow foods like mashed potatoes and applesauce. Use a humidifier.\n\nPrevention of strep throat can be as easy as washing your hands before you eat. Another useful prevention method involves cleaning the house frequently, especially the bathroom\n\nDo you have a health question for Dr. Manny?
