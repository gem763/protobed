Absolute love and respect for his captain.\"\n\nXhaka was subbed off by Unai Emery in the second half of the draw with Crystal Palace at the Emirates this weekend.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nWhen his number was called an ironic cheer from fans went around the stadium, but this quickly turned to booing as Xhaka slowly walked off the pitch.\n\nReacting negatively to the bad reception, the Switzerland international cupped his ears and was then seeing mouthing the words \"f*** off\".\n\nFinally, Xhaka removed his shirt and stormed off down the tunnel.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nTorreira, who was warming up on the touchline at the time, was visible saddened by the episode and had to be consoled by Hector Bellerin.\n\nEmery was asked about the captain's conduct following the fixture, and admitted Xhaka was in the wrong and that he will be spoken to.\n\n(Image: Visionhaus)\n\nHe said: \"He was wrong. We need to stay calm, speak to him internally about that. We are working with the club and the players to play under pressure.\n\n\"We are going to speak with him because the reaction was wrong. We are here because we have supporters. We work for them and need to have respect for them when they are applauding us and criticising us.\"", "description": "Arsenal midfielder Lucas Torreira was saddened to see his team-mate being booed off the pitch on Sunday", "authors": ["Jake Polden", "Image", "Getty Images", "Visionhaus"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20738146.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Arsenal-FC-v-Crystal-Palace-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
