He has admitted that as well,\u201d said Lampard.\n\n\u201cHe hasn\u2019t committed a crime other than eating chips in the back of a cab which is probably a bit out of order for the cabby. He hasn\u2019t broken a club code being out 48 hours before a game.\n\n\u201cThis morning he admitted to making a mistake. I will take that one at face value and we move on. On a professional level, these are little things that shouldn\u2019t happen. From my point of view as well, I like Ross. I have had absolutely no problem with him since he has been here. He works hard and wants to do well for this club.\u201d\n\nLampard has accepted Barkley's apology Credit: Darren Walsh/Chelsea FC via Getty Images\n\nLampard has used the Barkley incident as a timely warning to his developing squad over their responsibilities in public.\n\nChelsea\u2019s squad this season includes a number of the club\u2019s academy players and Lampard believes scrutiny on the modern player is now more intense than ever before.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cUnfortunately for them, they live in an era where there are many benefits to them in terms of their careers, but there\u2019s many difficulties that come with that,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cPeople have to pick up their phone at first glance and try and video people in any moment they think might be interesting to possibly sell or pass on.\n\n\u201cWhat the lads need to do is for their own benefit and behave in a certain way. Then secondly, be aware of the pitfalls. I made mistakes as a player, but I\u2019ve got confidence in them that they are professional lads who want to do the best for this club. They must take on their responsibilities off the pitch.\u201d\n\nChelsea face Lille on Wednesday night in search of their first points of the campaign, after the home defeat by Valencia last month.\n\nLampard knows the margin for error is already small against the northern French club, with a double-header against last season\u2019s semi-finalists Ajax coming up next.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the be all and end all, as there are four more games after this. We have to see it in the big picture, but as we sit here now with no points from the first game, it\u2019s a game we have to be very ready for and try and pick up something,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe players will be very aware of that. We can hopefully bring the confidence of the last two results we\u2019ve had, two really solid wins, into Wednesday night. We have to trust that if we play at our best then we\u2019ll get the result we want.\u201d\n\nN\u2019Golo Kante will be assessed ahead of the game after missing Saturday\u2019s 2-0 win over Brighton with a hamstring injury, but Lampard admitted he is \u201cpositive\u201d over the France midfielder starting the game.\n\nLille lost their opening game 3-0 to Ajax and have not won a European game at Stade Pierre-Mauroy since 2012.", "description": "Frank Lampard revealed \u201cnaive\u201d Ross Barkley has apologised after the Chelsea midfielder was involved in an incident late on Sunday night in Liverpool.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/O3IMXtSvJnGG9HWUyeEjUg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MDEuMDY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/PpIpwAeTpMB0qwUWew8.Qg--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjQ5OTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/4b7b8bae7dca3c1a426fd49522fe7942", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
