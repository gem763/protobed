It is shocking that it has taken so long for that information to be published.\u201d\n\nA government source insisted that the Yellowhammer exercise had always been designed to establish the worst outcomes which the authorities should be preparing for, and it would be a \u201cgross misrepresentation\u201d to portray it as a forecast of what would actually happen.\n\nSome versions of the documents drawn up by civil servants used the phrase \u201cbase scenario\u201d to describe \u201coverarching conditions upon which specific reasonable worst-case scenarios are then built\u201d, said the source.\n\nShadow chancellor John McDonnell repeated his call for parliament to be recalled immediately in the wake of the Yellowhammer release.\n\n\u201cThe serious consequences of a no-deal Brexit have been exposed by the Yellowhammer documents,\u201d he said. \u201cParliament should be sitting now.\u201d\n\nMr Johnson sought to play down the significance of the paper, saying that ministers had been \u201cmassively accelerating\u201d their no-deal preparations since he entered No 10 in July.\n\n\u201cIf we have to come out on 31 October with no deal we will be ready and the ports will be ready and the farming communities will be ready, and all the industries that matter will be ready for a no-deal Brexit,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re looking at here is just the sensible preparations \u2013 the worst-case scenario \u2013 that you\u2019d expect any government to do.\u201d\n\nBut former attorney general Dominic Grieve said it was \u201cunprecedented\u201d for a government deliberately to inflict on voters the level of disruption set out in the paper.\n\nMr Grieve, who was thrown out of the Conservative parliamentary party for voting against no deal last week, said: \u201cI am pleased they are taking contingency plans, but it is still the most extraordinary document.\n\n\u201cEven if we are ready for a no-deal Brexit, this is highly disruptive and costly. And I think the issue here is that the public should have a proper understanding of the sort of level of disruption that no-deal is going to cause.\u201d", "description": "Boris Johnson has been accused of downplaying the dangers of a no-deal Brexit, as rows erupted over a government paper warning of delays, disruption and disorder if the UK crashes out of the EU on 31 October.", "authors": ["Andrew Woodcock"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/12/14/front-boris-johnson-13-september-2019.jpg"}
