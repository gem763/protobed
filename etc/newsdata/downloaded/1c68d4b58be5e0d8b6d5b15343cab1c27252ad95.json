To others she is a yoga teacher who has inspired thousands.\n\n\"To us, she is Ali, wonderful mother of two, loving partner and daughter. We desperately hope that we , her friends and loved ones, can raise the funds she needs for a potentially life saving treatment. Time is of the essence.\"\n\n(Image: jez.hughes.399/facebook)\n\n(Image: ITV/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nTo date, the page had raised \u00a364,860.\n\nLeah described Jez as her \"rock\".\n\nShe said: \"My husband is like my rock.\n\n\"He is by my side a lot of the time. He has been a great sounding board.\n\n\"I think we support each other as well. My family do OK. I\u2019m not positive all the time, but I am optimistic.\"\n\nIn April this year, Leah announced she had started a new treatment in a bid to slow the progress of her cancer.\n\n(Image: Leah Bracknell/Instagram)\n\nBack in February, she wrote on her Something Beginning With C blog that she was \"fed up\" of being sick and dependent on husband Jez.\n\n\"Living with stage four cancer is not black and white, we cannot always be the noble and exceptional patient nor are we always self-pitying and woe-is-me,\" she wrote after weeks of being admitted to hospital for various infections.\n\n\"It took longer than I would have liked to get my strength back, something which frustrates me like mad. Life is short and precious and I want to be up and running ASAP, not hobbling around all weak and feeble.\"\n\nLeah said she was sick of seeing \"worry, fear, exhaustion and helplessness\" in her partner's eyes when she \"used to see partnership and mutuality\".\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nLeah's tragic passing was confirmed by her manager this afternoon.\n\nThe statement said: \"It is with the deepest sadness that Leah Bracknell's family confirm that Leah passed away in September, three years after her diagnosis with stage 4 lung cancer.\n\n\"They would like to thank all the public for their support and generosity which contributed to the extension and quality of her life over the past three years. Leah continued to embrace life and faced her illness with positivity. Many aspects of her journey can be found on her blog.\n\n\"Leah was best known and much loved as Zoe Tate in Emmerdale. She also had roles in Judge John Deed, A Touch of Frost, The Royal Today and DCI Banks to name just a few, as well as numerous appearances on stage and in pantomime. As well as acting, Leah was also an accomplished yoga teacher and shamanic healer.\n\n\"Leah had an energy and enthusiasm for life, a kind heart and much love to give to those around her.\n\n\"Her family have asked for privacy at this very sad time.\"", "description": "The former Emmerdale star's devoted partner was by her side every step of the way throughout her brave fight", "authors": ["Vicki Newman", "Image", "Leah'S Cancer Fund", "Facebook", "Itv Rex Shutterstock", "Leah Bracknell Instagram", "Ken Mckay Itv Rex Shutterstock"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article18992905.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Leah-Bracknell-with-her-partner-Jez-Hughes.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
