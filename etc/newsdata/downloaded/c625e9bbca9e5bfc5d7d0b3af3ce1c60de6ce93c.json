Slice each half into chunks and place in a 20 x 5cm round pie dish. Toss with some lemon juice.\n\nTo make the topping, lightly crush the ginger biscuits with a rolling pin or the base of a glass jar. In a bowl, mix the biscuit crumbs with the oats and brown sugar. Dice the butter, and add to the mixture. Gently rub the butter into the dry ingredients with your fingertips. Butter chunks, once rubbed in, should be about the size of half a pea.\n\nSpread the crisp topping onto the plums evenly. Place in the pre-heated oven. Check frequently and if the topping starts to brown too much, cover lightly with tin foil. In total, bake for about 20-25 minutes. The plums should be releasing juices and tender enough to be pieced easily with a knife.\n\nServe warm with a dollop of creme fraiche, ice cream or yoghurt, if desired.\n\n@juliapleonard\u200b", "description": "Early autumn is a bumper time for plums.
