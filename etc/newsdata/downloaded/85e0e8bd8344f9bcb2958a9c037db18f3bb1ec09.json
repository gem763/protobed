I\u2019m picking the team that lost the coin toss and never touched the ball in overtime of January\u2019s AFC Championship Game versus the team that got jobbed on the pass-interference non-call in the NFC Championship Game. Let\u2019s call the 54th Super Bowl the Fairness Super Bowl.\n\nIt\u2019s a rarity though, seeing the losers of the two title games one year make the big game the next year. Only twice in 53 Super Bowls have the two championship-game losers (or AFL and NFL title games a half-century ago) met the following year in the Super Bowl. But I saw both teams in August, and there\u2019s not a lot to dislike about either team. Both are better than they were last January, and neither seems to carry the weight of painful losses into this season. \u201cNo hangover here,\u201d Saints defensive end Cameron Jordan told me. \u201cNobody here feels stuff like that.\u201d\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nMy AFC picks and playoff seeds:\n\n1.
