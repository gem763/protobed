It's natural during a breakup to reflect on what might have been, as Iger did in his new autobiography, dreaming of an alternate universe in which Steve Jobs was still alive and the two rivals were one company.\n\nBut alas, Disney and Apple are enemy combatants ramping up for World War Streaming. Interestingly, they are both very much in sync on one philosophy: The future of streaming video is one in which advertising is unwelcome.\n\nIndeed, when Disney Plus rolls out in just a few months with loads of dazzling intellectual property, there won't be a Kraft or a GM to be found. Similarly, to the surprise of no one, Apple TV Plus will not carry any 30-second breaks. Apple has never been shy about sharing its feelings \u2014 or even hostility \u2014 toward the ad business. Jobs famously once said \"Mobile ads suck\" before eventually trying to peddle iAds for a million bucks apiece.\n\nHe eventually gave up, and the little advertising Apple runs on Apple News is outsourced. Instead, the iPhone maker is doing everything it can to cripple cookies and digital ad targeting by making privacy a staple of its products (indirectly shaming everyone else in Silicon Valley for not acting the same way).\n\nIt's Disney's ad-free position that feels more noteworthy, given that this is a company that has long relied on courting big brands to ABC and ESPN. Basically with Disney Plus, the company is continuing to reinforce to millions of consumers \u2014 already addicted to the Netflix experience \u2014 that as long as you pay, you don't have to have \"The Mandalorian\" rudely interrupted by Pepsi. The message is that television isn't about advertising anymore. (Ironically, that message was reinforced by Disney Plus and other streaming services advertising so heavily during the Emmys on Sunday night \u2014 a night when broadcast TV felt nonexistent).\n\nWhat does this tell us about the future of connected TV advertising \u2014 the one sector everyone in the ad business is so excited about?\n\nOf course, Apple and Disney's position stands in stark contrast to NBCUniversal's coming Peacock service, which will be ad supported (though NBC executives promised a \"lighter ad load\").\n\nYou have to say something like that in 2019; otherwise, you scare consumers away. You can argue that NBCU's position will give it an advantage compared with higher-priced competitors \u2014 except you have to have a cable subscription to access Peacock, unless you're a cord-cutter who wants to pay for mostly NBCU's library.\n\n\"Who is this for?\" a media executive I spoke with this week asked. \"If you have cable, why not just watch NBC?\"\n\nIt's a fair question. NBCU is bringing out some big names, including a Sam Esmail reboot of \"Battlestar Galactica\" as well as \"Saved by the Bell.\" Look, I'm as excited as anybody to see Zack Morris as the governor of California (almost as excited as Jesse was that one time). But I was also pumped to watch the new \"90210,\" which may be the worst thing I've ever watched on television (and I watched every episode of \"Prison Break\").\n\nBut I digress. The thing is that by next year, Peacock will stand out, for better or worse, because you have to endure ads at a time when people's tolerance is tanking.\n\nWhen I worked at Business Insider full time, I was surrounded by younger people who came of age in a streaming world. I remember a colleague talking about watching a finale of \"The Bachelorette\" and another said to her: \"I can't believe you watch something live! With all the ads. That would drive me crazy!\"\n\nTo be sure, at least 65% of Business Insider's workforce is around the age of 26, lives in Bushwick, and is still borrowing their parents' Netflix account. So it may not be representative of the rest of the US. But I get it.\n\nMy wife and I will often jump from binging Netflix or HBO to watch something on Hulu with ads, like, say, \"The Handmaid's Tale,\" and we whine about how the ad experience sucks. And it's probably the best there is.\n\nI know what you're going to say: Disney now controls Hulu! They are all in.\n\nSure, except that Hulu pulls in about $1.5 billion in advertising. On its own that's a great number, but it's not replacing the $70 billion TV ad business anytime soon. Part of the reason its business isn't bigger is that it can't run that many ads or people will scream.\n\nThat's the big question \u2014 as linear TV continues to shrink, where does that money go? You can't squeeze that all into a limited pool of ad-supported streaming platforms. Especially not when you have the biggest spenders in tech and Hollywood reminding you every day how \u2014 as one executive put it \u2014 linear TV is \"just a bad product.\"\n\nIt's a good bet that execs at Apple are fine with that assessment (Jobs surely would be). It's a bit more surprising that Disney and Iger want to send that message so forcefully.
