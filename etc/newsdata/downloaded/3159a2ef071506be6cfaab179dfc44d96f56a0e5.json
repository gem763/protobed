In that way, playing on a short week was a benefit for the Los Angeles quarterback.\n\nAnd if Greg Zuerlein\u2019s 44-yard field goal attempt in the closing seconds hooks just slightly to the left, the narrative around Goff and his team is likely far different.\n\nAs it stands, the Rams have lost two straight after falling 30-29 to the Seattle Seahawks on Thursday night. But it was Goff who put the Rams in position to have a chance at getting out of Seattle with an unlikely victory, and not just because of what he did in the final 90 seconds.\n\nGoff finished 29 of 49 for 395 yards and one touchdown against the Seahawks just days after throwing for a career-high 517 yards and tying an NFL record with 45 completions in a loss to Tampa Bay. He was maligned after the loss to Tampa Bay for his three interceptions and one fumble lost to go along with all the yards thrown.\n\nThere weren\u2019t any fumbles this time. The only interception bounced off the hands of his intended target. And Goff changed the momentum of the game with a key touchdown drive late in the first half. He wasn\u2019t perfect and was ultimately outplayed by Seattle\u2019s Russell Wilson. But it was more reminiscent of what Goff did a year ago.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t all come down to that kick, there are a lot of plays that we could have done better. \u2026 There\u2019s a million things that could have gone differently to change that game, you learn from them and you move forward,\u201d Goff said.\n\nGoff helped change the course of the game on the final drive of the first half after Seattle\u2019s Jason Myers missed a 48-yard field goal attempt. Goff hit four straight passes, capitalized on a roughing-the-passer call, and capped the drive with a 9-yard TD toss to Cooper Kupp. Suddenly a game Los Angeles felt Seattle controlled was only a 14-13 lead at halftime.\n\nGoff continued to roll into the second half. He led touchdown drives on two of three possessions in the third quarter, and Zuerlein\u2019s 36-yard field goal with 9:19 left gave the Rams a 29-24 lead.\n\n\u201cWe were ready to go on offense most of the second half,\u201d Goff said. \u201cWe had some things that didn\u2019t go our way, where we didn\u2019t finish drives, but we were moving the ball really well. Knew what they were doing defensively, had some pretty good plays for it.\u201d\n\nGoff\u2019s lone mistake came with 2:28 left when his pass for Gerald Everett deflected into the hands of Seattle safety Tedric Thompson. The Rams defense held and Goff got one more chance, taking possession at his own 7 with 1:38 remaining.\n\nHe was nearly flawless. Goff hit five of his first six passes, the big blow being a 28-yard completion to Everett to the Seattle 30. The Rams stalled and had to settle for Zuerlein\u2019s attempt that stayed out to the right and never hooked to the middle of the uprights.\n\n\u201cHe just missed it. We have a lot of confidence in Greg. It\u2019s one kick,\u201d Rams coach Sean McVay said. \u201cHe\u2019s made a lot of big kicks for us. He\u2019s going to continue to make a lot of big kicks for us.\u201d\n\nGoff was 27 of 42 for 371 yards over the final three quarters. He isn\u2019t worried about where the Rams go from here. They\u2019ll have another big divisional matchup next week against San Francisco.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been 3-2 before, that was two years ago, if I remember correctly. The Patriots were 3-2 last year and they won the Super Bowl. So there\u2019s a lot of game left,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a good group of people in there. We\u2019re going to bounce back, we\u2019re fine. Obviously you don\u2019t want to lose two in a row at any point, but we have another big divisional one next week so we have no time to waste.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Jared Goff didn\u2019t have long to let the mistakes of last week linger.
