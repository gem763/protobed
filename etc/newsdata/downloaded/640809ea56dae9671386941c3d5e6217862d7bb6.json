Sehgal calls the book a novel \u201cwith a clarity and transparency of purpose and method, a refusal of narrative tricksiness.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss our profile of Patchett, in which she describes the process of writing \u201cThe Dutch House.\u201d \u201cIt was horrible to write,\u201d she told our reporter, cheerfully. \u201cIt was like Thelma and Louise going over a cliff. I made so many errors in judgment.\u201d\n\nIn other news\n\nCongratulations to the authors whose work was longlisted for the National Book Award, including Colson Whitehead, Patrick Radden Keefe and Julia Phillips. The shortlist of finalists in each category are scheduled to be announced on Oct. 8, and the winners on Nov. 20 at an awards ceremony in New York City.", "description": "Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019s debut novel, a landmark biography of Susan Sontag, Ann Patchett and more.", "authors": ["Joumana Khatib"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/22/books/review/22Cover-FURIES/22Cover-FURIES-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
