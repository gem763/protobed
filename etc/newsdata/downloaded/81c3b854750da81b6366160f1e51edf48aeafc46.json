While Daley dished more big strikes than he received, Awad (23-13 MMA, 11-10 BMMA) found a home for a handful of big strikes throughout the fight.\n\nDaley\u2019s back elbows, hooks, and straights galore set the tempo for the rest of the fight. After a decisive first round, Daley saw an opening to finish the fight in the second round and capitalized on it.\n\nDaley threw a right outside leg kick followed by a huge looping left hook. Overextending, Awad ate a massive punch from Daley, which sent him crashing to the canvas. A few follow-up shots was all it took for referee Kevin MacDonald to waive off the contest.\n\nAwad was not Daley\u2019s original opponent. Sabah Homasi was forced to withdraw from the fight against \u201cSemtex\u201d due to injury. Awad, who last fought on Oct. 4, moved up a weight class to take the fight on less than a week\u2019s notice.\n\nWith the loss, Awad has now lost four straight fights. Daley has now won back-to-back fights since being eliminated from the Bellator welterweight grand prix by rival Michael Page.\n\nThe welterweight bout was the Bellator 232 co-main event at Mohegan Sun Arena. The main card streamed on DAZN following prelims on MMA Junkie.\n\nUp-to-the-minute Bellator 232 results include:", "description": "For the first time since 2017, Paul Daley picked up a finish win when he knocked out Saad Awad at 1:30 of the second round at Bellator 232.", "authors": ["Nolan King", "Dave Doyle", "The Blue Corner", "Mike Bohn", "Farah Hannoun", "Matt Erickson", "Mma Junkie Staff"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/bellator222_paul_daley_vs_erick_silva_3.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
