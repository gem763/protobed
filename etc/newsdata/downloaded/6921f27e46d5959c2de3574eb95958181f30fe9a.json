Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) and the rest of their caucus confront a strategic imbalance. They can\u2019t forget the long game, but they must stay focused on facts, witnesses and evidence. The president and his Republican defenders in Congress can play political games to their heart\u2019s content. Democrats can\u2019t afford to appear to be anything but judicious, careful and deliberate, lest they play into Trump\u2019s hands by looking, well, \u201cpolitical.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd while the dance in Washington continues, the party\u2019s nomination race is entering the stage that will accentuate divisions. Trump will exploit every crack in Democratic solidarity.\n\nAttacks on Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) will escalate, because current trends are in her favor. All her rivals have an interest in reversing them.\n\nFormer vice president Joe Biden will be fighting on two fronts as he addresses perceptions that his candidacy is fading. He must stop Warren\u2019s momentum and prevent another center-left candidate \u2014 South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg especially, but also, perhaps, Sens. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) or Kamala D. Harris (Calif.) \u2014 from biting into the support he has maintained.\n\nAD\n\nAnd public speculation by Democratic strategists that the party needs to find a brand-new candidate weakens everyone now running, which is also to Trump\u2019s advantage.\n\nAD\n\nThe situation Democrats face is therefore more treacherous than they might want to believe, given that a flailing Trump seems to be losing the messaging war on impeachment rather badly. Yes, the public seems ready to throw Trump out of office. But will Democrats make that easy or hard?\n\nA report released last week by the Center for American Progress sheds important light on the party\u2019s choices. One of its key findings will cheer Trump\u2019s foes: If every demographic group votes as it did in 2016, Trump will lose the popular vote by an even greater margin than he did last time and fall short in the three states that put him over the top: Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\nAD\n\nWhy? Because, write Ruy Teixeira and John Halpin, the study\u2019s authors, \u201cthe nonwhite share of the eligible electorate will increase by 2 percentage points, almost entirely from increases in the shares of Hispanics, Asians, and voters of other races. That will be balanced by a commensurate decrease in the share of white noncollege eligible voters.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut Democrats should not think that victory is already in the bank. The electoral college decides who is president, and Teixeira and Halpin note that these demographic shifts alone would produce only very narrow margins in the three key states. If Democrats fail to convert some of Trump\u2019s voters or increase turnout among the faithful, the party\u2019s candidate would still be at risk.\n\n\u201cWhoever the Democratic nominee is,\u201d Teixeira said in an interview, \u201che or she must do two things above all: reach out to the white working class and increase black turnout.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThis is exactly why many Democrats once saw Biden as their savior, since he combines a white working-class appeal with a strong draw on the loyalty of African Americans. Biden\u2019s problem is that many Democrats have begun to wonder if the candidate they are seeing on the trail is the same person they imagined when he first announced his bid.\n\nAD\n\nBiden needs to restore their confidence even as his rivals try to convince primary voters that they are more likely to achieve Teixeira\u2019s twin goals than the former vice president.\n\nAs for Trump, Teixeira sees his most promising path to reelection as \u201cincreasing his share of the white \u00adworking-class vote and also increasing turnout in this group,\u201d while holding down his losses among the white \u00adcollege-educated.\n\nAD\n\nSo if Trump\u2019s approach to impeachment seems undisciplined, its main purpose is to incite rage, energy and thus turnout among those who put him in the White House in the first place \u2014 Republican base voters plus white working-class swing voters. \u201cIs his strategy working?\u201d Teixeira asked. \u201cProbably not. But there may be method in his madness.\u201d\n\nWhich is why Trump\u2019s madness will continue. Democrats cannot afford to assume that this alone will doom him.\n\nAD\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "His reelection will hinge on the electoral college.", "authors": ["E.J.
