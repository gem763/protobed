Absolutely. No question about that. But that's it. And that's why we held up the money.\"\n\nMulvaney's statement was the first public acknowledgment from an administration official that Trump held up Ukraine's security assistance in part for political gain.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nMick Mulvaney, President Donald Trump's acting chief of staff, confirmed that part of the reason Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine was that he wanted the Ukrainian government to investigate a conspiracy theory related to the 2016 election.\n\nMulvaney acknowledged the quid pro quo during a press conference Thursday in which he explained the factors that contributed to Trump's decision to withhold aid.\n\nMulvaney said Trump told him that he believed Ukraine was a \"corrupt place\" and that he didn't want to \"send them a bunch of money.\" He also said the president was concerned that other European countries weren't doing their fair share to contribute to Ukraine's defense.\n\nMulvaney added: \"Did he also mention to me in the past the corruption related to the DNC server? Absolutely. No question about that. But that's it. And that's why we held up the money.\"\n\nABC News' Jonathan Karl immediately followed up and asked Mulvaney to confirm that \"the demand for an investigation into the Democrats was part of the reason that he ordered to withhold funding to Ukraine.\"\n\nMulvaney replied affirmatively, saying that \"the look back to what happened in 2016 certainly was part of the thing that he was worried about in corruption with that nation.\"\n\nMulvaney's mention of a \"DNC server\" points to a debunked conspiracy theory about the origins of the FBI's Russia investigation.\n\nThe theory claims that the Democratic National Committee hid an incriminating server from the FBI while the bureau was investigating Russia's hack during the summer of 2016, one that contains information about who was really responsible for the breach.\n\nThe DNC turned over all its data to the FBI after it learned it had been hacked. That information, moreover, wasn't stored on a single, physical server, but rather on a network of computer systems.", "description": "This is the first statement from an administration official confirming that Trump held up Ukraine's military aid in part for political gain.", "authors": ["Sonam Sheth"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d3783ff454a3918663e8433?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
