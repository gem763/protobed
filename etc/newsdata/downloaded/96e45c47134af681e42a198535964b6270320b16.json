The agency said another tornado in the suburb of Rowlett was EF1, with maximum wind speeds of 160km/h (100 mph).\n\nAt a nearby shopping centre, the fronts and roofs of stores were ripped away. Ruptured pipes were still spewing water Monday morning, drenching the piles of mangled drywall, insulation and steel framing inside the brick building.\n\nThe tornado that caused widespread damage in north Dallas passed close to the home of former President George W Bush and former first lady Laura Bush but caused no damage. Bush spokesman Freddy Ford said in a statement that \"the Bushes are safe and praying for their neighbors around DFW who weren't as fortunate\".\n\nTornadoes are not common in October, and cities are rarely hit because they do not have a big footprint in the tornado belt, according to tornado scientist Harold Brooks of the National Severe Storms Laboratory.\n\nIt's like \"randomly throwing darts,\" Brooks said.\n\nA study by Brooks last year found that only one-third of the most violent tornadoes hit communities of more than 5,000 people.\n\nThe storm system disrupted flights in the Dallas area, northwestern Arkansas and at Memphis International Airport in Tennessee, where windows were broken.\n\nThe Storm Prediction Center said severe thunderstorms could continue through Monday night along the Gulf Coast from southeastern Louisiana to the Florida Panhandle, with damaging winds and a couple of tornadoes possible.", "description": "Powerful storm causes property damage in Dallas, Texas, and kills 4 people in Arkansas and Oklahoma.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/22/f7f63332dd6c43e59c0beb47b5ba1f5e_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
