I was shivering, it was freezing cold, I think hypothermia would have set in if I was left there any longer.\n\nMedics advised not to move him (Picture: SWNS)\n\n\u2018When the ambulance arrived, I felt like I was on my last breath.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe pensioner, who is diabetic, believes high blood sugar levels caused him to lose balance and fall as he exited the bus around 5pm on October 1.\n\nA woman spotted he had fallen and alerted the bus driver, who then pulled over next to him to protect him from the wind while he waited for an ambulance.\n\nTerence said there was \u2018blood everywhere\u2019, adding that kind strangers placed their coats on him to keep him warm.\n\nHe continued: \u2018I would have been dead if people hadn\u2019t come out and put those coats on me. It shouldn\u2019t have taken that long for ambulance to come out.\n\nHe felt like he was on his \u2018last breath\u2019 (Picture: SWNS)\n\n\u2018Once it had been dispatched, it was here in minutes. They should have sent one out earlier.\u2019\n\nTerence\u2019s daughter Paula had been travelling home to Bolton when she received a call from a passerby using her dad\u2019s phone.\n\nBut by the time she got there, emergency services had still not been dispatched to the scene and she was told on the phone paramedics in the area were \u2018very busy\u2019.\n\nPaula said: \u2018He\u2019s a pensioner, he\u2019s a vulnerable person, it\u2019s shocking they didn\u2019t consider him a priority.\n\n\u2018My dad was on the concrete ground, freezing cold with some blankets from a shop over the road. There was blood everywhere and he was freezing.\n\nThe great-grandfather was kept in hospital for a week (Picture: SWNS)\n\n\u2018I know hospitals are stupidly busy, but they could have got an ambulance there and he should have been prioritised.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe added: \u2018I was worried the worst would happened. I thought I was going to lose my dad. If I hadn\u2019t told them he wasn\u2019t breathing properly, they wouldn\u2019t have come.\u2019\n\nAlmost 800 Isis supporters escape Syrian camp after Turkish military attack\n\nAfter two hours, Terence began to feel a \u2018large ball\u2019 in the back of his throat which caused him breathing difficulties.\n\nWhen Paula told the operator this, an ambulance was finally dispatched and arrived at the scene eight minutes after her call.\n\nHe was taken to hospital, where he stayed for almost a week before being released on Monday, October 7.\n\nHe has since been discharged (Picture: SWNS)\n\nA spokesman for the North West Ambulance Service said Terence\u2019s fall had been classed as a category three response, which means paramedics will aim to arrive within two hours.\n\nThey continued: \u2018Following further calls regarding a change to the patient\u2019s condition, the call was upgraded to a category one at 6.59pm and we arrived on scene at 7.07pm.\n\n\u2018We always try to get to patients as quickly as we can but we have to prioritise those in an immediately life-threatening condition in order to get them the help they need as soon as possible.\n\n\u2018We are sorry for any distress caused and would encourage the patient or a family member to contact us directly so we can discuss this with them in more detail. We sincerely hope he is recovering well.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk? Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
