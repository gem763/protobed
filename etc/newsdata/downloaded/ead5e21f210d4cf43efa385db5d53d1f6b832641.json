Here\u2019s how to break the cycle.", "language": "en", "text": "It\u2019s all going along well enough, or so it seems. But my tension is rising, even if I\u2019m not aware of it. Eventually, something gives. I spill the milk or drop my phone or step on a Lego or the girls start bickering; whatever it is, something sends me over the edge and I explode. I lose it at my kids, and the evening starts to unravel.\n\nSome version of this happens to many parents on a regular basis. In fact, these episodes are so common that many of us have come to think of them as an unavoidable part of daily life with kids. If we do happen to stop and wonder what happened, we often assume it\u2019s because we had a rough day at work or the kids were tired or getting sick. While these things may be true, they\u2019re not the whole story.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe truth is that multitasking is making us lose our tempers with our children. This is a major bummer for those of us who want to believe we\u2019re being all efficient and awesome when we try to tackle more than one project or task at once. But multitasking increases our stress in a number of ways:\n\n\u00b7 It makes us more distracted and less attentive, increasing the likelihood that we\u2019ll screw something up.\n\n\u00b7 It increases our anxiety and dampens our creativity, which means we worry more than we need to and have a harder time thinking up effective solutions and responses when problems arise.\n\n\u00b7 It makes it more likely we\u2019ll miss important information and cues. If we had just noticed that the kids were getting hungry or overtired, we could have given them a snack or a nap before they freaked out.\n\nAD\n\n\u00b7 It makes us less efficient because we\u2019re only half-doing whatever it is we think we\u2019re doing, which means it will take twice as long to finish it, or it won\u2019t be done correctly.\n\nAD\n\nMultitasking is pervasive. How many times have you read a job description stating \u201cability to multitask required\u201d? But it\u2019s also how our minds work. Our brains weren\u2019t made to focus on just one thing at a time; they evolved to think, to scan, react, notice, wonder, plan, regret and imagine, regardless of whether all of that thinking is actually helpful. And multitasking tricks us into believing we\u2019re on top of everything, when in fact it actually increases our stress.\n\nI made my smartphone less useful, and it made me a better parent\n\nMost of us have years of practice trying to do multiple things at once, and the more we practice something \u2014 anything \u2014 the better we get at it, even if it\u2019s not something we actually want to get \u201cbetter\u201d at. So we are stuck in a habitual behavior that can cause parental meltdowns.\n\nAD\n\nFortunately, there is another way. We can choose to single-task, or focus on just one thing at a time. In the event that you just read that sentence and rolled your eyes so hard they almost fell out of your head, please bear with me. I\u2019m a working parent, too, and I get it. We\u2019re all crazy busy, and it often feels like if we\u2019re not doing as many things as possible as often as possible, everything will fall apart.\n\nAD\n\nI\u2019m not saying parents should set a goal of never doing more than one thing at a time. That\u2019s neither necessary nor possible. I just want people to start noticing how multitasking may be connected to their temper, and to see single-tasking as a powerful strategy for calming down when they\u2019re about to lose it.\n\nThis isn\u2019t easy; multitasking is a tough habit to break. However, the more we practice single-tasking, the easier it becomes. Here are a few steps to get you started:\n\nAD\n\nNotice when you\u2019re multitasking. You\u2019ll be amazed at how often you\u2019ve got multiple balls in the air without even realizing it.\n\nRemember that you can always choose to do just one thing at a time. If this feels like an impossible choice because you absolutely can\u2019t set down any of those balls, consider what will happen if you drop any of them. Consciously choosing to focus on just one thing at a time will help you get through your day more effectively and efficiently.\n\nAD\n\nDecide if now is the time to single-task. If you\u2019re not sure, ask yourself the following questions: Are you already tense, stressed, anxious or tired? Are there any significant ramifications if you mess something up? Are you with your kids? If the answer to any of these questions is \u201cyes,\u201d then it\u2019s probably a good time to slow down and focus on whatever is right in front of you.\n\nAD\n\nCarry on, either way. Multitask if you can. Empty the dishwasher while you listen to your favorite podcast. Fold laundry while you help your son with his homework. But if you\u2019re tempted to tap out a work email while managing a sibling conflict, or make dinner while you over-analyze a weird comment from a friend and the kids are buzzing around demanding attention, well, try not to do that. Instead, put away your computer or smartphone and make a plan to resume your overthinking after the kids are in bed. You\u2019ll be far more likely to help your children, and less likely to lose your cool with them.\n\nThe first step to all of this, of course, is to believe that multitasking isn\u2019t helpful, and that it\u2019s making you less patient and more reactive. And that\u2019s not going to happen until you intentionally try single-tasking. I know that in our house, evenings go more smoothly if I put my phone away, turn off the news and tell the girls that I can pay attention to them once I\u2019m done cooking. Sometimes I have to repeat that a few times before it sticks, but eventually they listen. Once dinner is on the table, I can help with homework and admire Lego creations without getting frustrated.\n\nAD\n\nGetting my body and brain on the same page, and doing just one thing at a time, decreases my stress because I\u2019m no longer worried about which ball I might drop. I can slow down and think about what might be going on with my kids, and what we all need at any given moment. And then I\u2019m much more likely to respond to my children thoughtfully, rather than exploding at them reactively.\n\nAD\n\nCarla Naumburg is a clinical social worker, author, and speaker, and the author of \u201cHow to Stop Losing Your Sh*t with Your Kids.\u201d Find her on Twitter @SWMama.\n\nFollow On Parenting on Facebook for more essays, news and updates, and join our discussion group here to talk about parenting and work.
