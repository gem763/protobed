In a short but jam-packed 90 minutes, the film gives a broad but effective overview of the history of one of the industry\u2019s most vital, yet misunderstood art forms, with a variety of participants from all ages and groups.\n\nThere\u2019s a very good chance it will inspire a whole new generation to pursue a career in sound design, or at least to upgrade their home theater system.\n\n\u201cMaking Waves\u201d has a lot of ground to cover, and Costin \u2014 a sound editor on hit films like \u201cArmageddon,\u201d \u201cCrimson Tide\u201d and \u201cHocus Pocus,\u201d now making her directorial debut \u2014 wisely doesn\u2019t try to tackle it all at once. The first half of the documentary covers the history of sound design from the silent era to the present day, with extra emphasis on the designers and films that altered the art form and industry. The second half explores, in broad strokes, each layer of contemporary sound design, from production sound to foley to ambience to music and mixing, and everything in between.\n\nAlso Read: Marvel's Victoria Alonso to Be Honored With Motion Picture Sound Editors' Filmmaker Award\n\nThere\u2019s surprisingly much to be said about the silent era, with the film\u2019s many experts revealing that sound recording was invented before moving pictures, and that many silent films were played with live musical accompaniment and sometimes live sound effects. If there\u2019s a great pity in \u201cMaking Waves,\u201d it\u2019s that in celebrating one aspect of the cinematic medium it treats the entire silent era like a mere stepping stone to the invention of synchronized sound. Obviously Costin\u2019s film has its focus, but in this case, at least, it feels legitimately one-sided.\n\n\u201cMaking Waves\u201d also breezes past many earlier landmarks in cinematic sound, giving fair credit to \u201cThe Jazz Singer\u201d and \u201cKing Kong\u201d for their invaluable contributions to the medium. But there aren\u2019t many contributors to those films alive today to talk to, of course, so perhaps it\u2019s natural they get slightly less screen time than the more contemporary examples.\n\nEventually \u201cMaking Waves\u201d settles in and focuses on three iconic and groundbreaking sound designers, and details their careers and their innovations with in-depth interviews and examples. Walter Murch (\u201cApocalypse Now\u201d), Ben Burtt (\u201cStar Wars\u201d) and Gary Rydstrom (\u201cJurassic Park\u201d) soak up quite a bit of credit in the historical section of the documentary, but Costin makes a fine case for their accolades.\n\nAlso Read: Motion Picture Sound Editors Give Top Awards to 'A Quiet Place,' 'Bohemian Rhapsody,' 'Spider-Man'\n\nThe film clearly contextualizes the state of sound design in the industry before these key figures took big risks on innovative films, and reminds us just how crazy their now ubiquitous ideas \u2014 like recording and mixing new sound effects for every single scene, rather than relying on a library of studio tapes \u2014 really were. And what\u2019s more, by repeatedly revisiting clips from earlier films and contrasting them with more complicated soundscapes, \u201cMaking Waves\u201d makes the whole history of the medium accessible, even to audience members who go into the theater knowing little or nothing about it.\n\n\u201cMaking Waves\u201d treats Murch, Burtt and Rydstrom \u2014 all of whom contribute their expertise and anecdotes to the production \u2014 like rebel rock stars, which they are. They\u2019re just really nerdy, laid-back rebel rock stars, who really love making movies. You kinda gotta love them.\n\nThe second half of the documentary bites off a little more than it can chew by focusing entirely on the various elements of modern sound design individually. There just isn\u2019t enough time in the film to go into complicated depth about the nuances of foley or ambient sound or musical composition or mixing, and so on. But Costin wisely finds very specific examples to illustrate each element of the medium, sometimes from unexpected sources.\n\nAlso Read: How the 'Roma' Sound Team Immerses the Audience in the Story\n\nSo much of \u201cMaking Waves\u201d is dedicated to big scale productions like \u201cStar Wars\u201d that it\u2019s a relief whenever the film emphasizes instead on the incredible complexity involved in recording a film like \u201cOrdinary People.\u201d Costin\u2019s film presents the original audio tracks, which even in a scene of two people talking in a psychiatrist\u2019s office is a distracting low-key cacophony of ambient distractions.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Midge Costin\u2019s inspiring and educational documentary \u201cMaking Waves: The Art of Cinematic Sound\u201d seems destined to wind up in the curriculum of film schools across the country.
