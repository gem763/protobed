In short order, the Washington Mystics found themselves behind 18 points.\n\nBut the Mystics have talked about remaining calm in the most stress-inducing moments of their WNBA playoff run. That\u2019s exactly what they did \u2014 until the bitter end.\n\nConnecticut beat the Mystics 90-86 in Game 4 of the WNBA Finals on Tuesday, tying the series 2-2 to push it to one winner-take-all contest. Game 5 will be played in the District Thursday at 8 p.m.\n\nWashington erased a 16-point halftime deficit in 10 minutes to head into the third quarter tied at 68. The two sides traded shots and leads throughout the fourth until a Shekinna Stricklen 3-pointer put the Sun ahead 87-84. The Mystics\u2019 final play fell apart with a poor miss by Natasha Cloud that Connecticut rebounded.\n\nAll five Sun starters scored in double figures. Center Jonquel Jones did what she wanted in the paint, finishing with 18 points and 13 rebounds.\n\nElena Delle Donne returned to regular usage after playing in brief spurts with frequent subs in Game 3 as she coped with a herniated disk, but she only posted 11 points and five boards.\n\nEmma Meesseman, who entered Tuesday as the leading scorer in the WNBA playoffs with 140 points, went 0-for-5 shooting in the first half but came back to score 12 in the second half.\n\nWashington forced its way back in in the second half. Ariel Atkins and Kristi Toliver combined for three straight 3-pointers to get the Mystics within one point. The two sides traded baskets for a few minutes, and an Aerial Powers driving layup eventually tied it at 68.\n\nBoth teams are seeking their first WNBA title. The Mystics have not won a championship in their 22-year history.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
