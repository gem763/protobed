You felt you had to show faith in him.'\n\nHis parents spoke to him about aerosol misuse, Ms Blake said.\n\nThe inquest at Carrow House, Norwich, heard the boy died of misadventure\n\nJack's mother found him unresponsive in his bedroom on June 13 2019 and found an aerosol can on his bed.\n\nDespite the efforts of paramedics he died at his home in, Hockwold, Norfolk.\n\nA post-mortem examination recorded his medical cause of death as aerosol inhalation.\n\nMs Blake said that the pathologist did not find any volatile gases in Jack's lungs but that they 'just dissipate because of the way the body reacts after death'.\n\nShe said that breathing in the gases from aerosols can 'jolt' the heart, and that the damage caused is to the heart rather than the lungs.\n\n'I think it's more likely than not he used the aerosol and unexpectedly died,' said Ms Blake, adding that there was no evidence that Jack intended to harm himself.\n\n'They say people get a high from it,' she said.\n\n'I don't know. It used to be glue sniffing in my day.\n\n'It's the thing in aerosols that makes the gas spray that does the damage.'\n\nShe concluded that he died by misadventure, where a deliberate action has an unintended consequence.\n\nAddressing his parents who attended Thursday's hearing, she said: 'He would have gone into cardiac arrest and he wouldn't have known anything.\n\n'I'm very sorry for your loss.\n\n'You don't expect to bury your children.'\n\nMrs Waple told the coroner: 'He was very adventurous and would do things like he had learnt off the internet like making a cake in a cup, and making his own ice cubes which are still in the freezer in plastic bags with kiwi fruit in.'\n\nHis father Robert Waple, who works as a chef, said that Jack 'loved experimenting with things'.\n\nHe said Jack was prone to nosebleeds and Ms Blake said this could explain blood found on Jack, as the post-mortem examination recorded no signs of haemorrhaging or external damage.", "description": "Jack Waple's mother found him unresponsive in his bedroom on June 13, 2019 and found an aerosol can on his bed.
