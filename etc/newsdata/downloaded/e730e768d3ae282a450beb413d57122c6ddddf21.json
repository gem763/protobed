I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any more than just a niggle but we\u2019ll need to wait for tomorrow to confirm.\u201d\n\nLionel Messi\u2019s enduring luminous talent marks him out as The Best Read more\n\nAntoine Griezmann and Arthur got the first-half goals at the Camp Nou as Barcelona moved to within a point of the top trio Granada, Athletic Bilbao and Real Madrid. The former Arsenal midfielder Santi Cazorla pulled a goal back for Villarreal just before half-time.\n\nBarcelona claimed the lead after 10 minutes as Griezmann applied a deft flick to Messi\u2019s near-post corner to guide the ball over the Villarreal goalkeeper, Sergio Asenjo, and into the net.\n\nThe home side doubled their lead five minutes later as the midfielder Arthur beat Asenjo once more with a shot from 25 yards that flew into the top corner. The Brazilian was given space as the Villarreal defenders stood off him and he took his chance with a fine finish.\n\nCazorla reduced the deficit a minute before the break with a fine long-range effort of his own that eluded Marc-Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen in the Bar\u00e7a goal.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Barcelona\u2019s Antoine Griezmann opens the scoring against Villarreal.

Shortly after the 16-year-old fired just wide as Barcelona hunted a third goal.\n\nGerard Piqu\u00e9 saw his late free-kick from the edge of the area kept out by Asenjo and Griezmann also shot over the bar late on but Barcelona had already done enough to secure the victory.\n\nValverde added: \u201cWe are playing well at home but I think with the injury to Leo everyone was stopped in their tracks a little bit. I think we\u2019re very much on the right track at home, though.\u201d", "description": "Lionel Messi was replaced at half-time as a precaution, said his coach, Ernesto Valverde, after watching Barcelona win 2-1 at home to Villarreal", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8786e1f604bb5f7a11804204a3c8c7ebb320df5c/0_86_1228_737/master/1228.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d5cf719be547ed8c72cd29f2484e22aa", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
