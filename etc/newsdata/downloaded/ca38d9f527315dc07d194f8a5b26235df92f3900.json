China plans to increase the purchase of US agricultural products based on the two sides' preliminary agreement, officials said.", "description": "Economic cooperation between China and the United States is expected to strengthen and help contain prolonged trade tension as cooperation is in line with the interests of both sides and China keeps advancing high-level opening-up efforts, experts said.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/28/5db64056a310cf3e97a327f7.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
