In most cases, food or snacks such as fruit, health bars, and sandwiches can stay inside your carry-on bag.\u201d\n\nHowever, the administration added that if an item prevents agents from seeing into the bag clearly during the screening process, passengers may be asked to remove it.\n\nThe website continued:\n\nIn addition to screening personal electronic devices separately, including laptops, tablets, e-readers and handheld game consoles, TSA officers may instruct travelers to separate other items from carry-on bags such as foods, powders, and any materials that can clutter bags and obstruct clear images on the X-ray machine. We recommend keeping your bag organized to help ease the screening process as it takes time for TSA officers to make sure a jam-packed, cluttered, overstuffed bag is safe.\n\nMei\u2019s tweet went viral after she posted it last week, and the video has since received more than 1.6 million views.\n\nOn Sunday, Mei wrote on Twitter that she was on her way to Korea to visit friends who told her the chips are hard to come by in their country.\n\n\u201cFor everyone who\u2019s asking why i had so many bags of Hot Cheetos, apparently it\u2019s hard to get in korea so my friends always ask me to bring it for them LOL,\u201d she concluded.", "description": "A woman was recently flagged by a Transportation Security Administration (TSA) agent for transporting Flamin' Hot Cheetos through an airport.", "authors": ["Amy Furr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/11/tsa.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
