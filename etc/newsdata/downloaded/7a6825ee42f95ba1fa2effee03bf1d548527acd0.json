One of the other women asked if it was the Afrikaans Protestant Church (APK).\n\nThe women then responded: \"Die kerk sonder k***s (The church without k***s).\"\n\nProvincial DA leaders opened a case of crimen injuria against her last week.\n\nFF Plus MP Wouter Wessels said the party was informed about the DA's plans to lay a charge against Maritz.\n\n\n\n\"The incident reportedly took place about five years ago when the member in question, Ms Marcelle Maritz, was still a DA councillor,\" he said in a statement, which the DA has since denied.\n\n\"Ms Maritz denies having used the word and therefore, the leadership of the FF Plus will conduct an internal investigation into the matter to get to the truth.\n\n\"The FF Plus is strongly opposed to any form of racism from any side of society and will take strict action if needs be.\"", "description": "The South African Human Rights Commission is taking Limpopo FF Plus leader Marcelle Maritz to the Equality Court for allegedly using the k-word in an incident captured on video.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9403/f7d9de42bb574820ae5af9e782ab92b1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
