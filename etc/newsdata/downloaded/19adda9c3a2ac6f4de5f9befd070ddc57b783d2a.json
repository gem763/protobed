The companionship\u2019s good for the soul, and the incentive to exercise is a help.\n\nIt\u2019s well known, too, that dogs are good for depression, but I must say that they don\u2019t work for me. I love dogs, but have never owned one; I prefer to borrow them. My friends\u2019 cockapoo is one I\u2019m very close to. He\u2019s called Hugo, which was the breeder\u2019s choice, not theirs. The problem with walking a dog called Hugo in any park near where I live, is that when you call him, half the boys within earshot come running towards you. Apart from that, Hugo gives great value at times when walking is the best therapy.\n\nIn the house, though, it\u2019s different. Here things get very stressful. The relentless adoration I get from Hugo is too much to bear. I don\u2019t have the self-esteem to feel worthy of the love. Wherever I go, whatever I do, I can feel his eyes gleaming in admiration of me.\n\nEverybody should have a dog \u2013 they remind us we are lucky to be alive | Arwa Mahdawi Read more\n\nAt times this can feel almost hostile. \u201cHugo,\u201d I implore, \u201cI am not the man you seem to think I am. I\u2019m finding your adulation quite distressing.\u201d Not being fluent in psychobabble, Hugo takes no notice at all and looks serenely on.\n\nEventually, I have to put him in another room to give myself a break. But then I feel bad about that. The guilt nags away and soon enough I have to retrieve him. I open the door and there he is, his ardour for me undimmed by this cruel banishment. And so it goes on. Eventually, I can take no more and I walk him home.", "description": "Those recovering from heart attacks and strokes apparently do better if they have a dog in the house.
