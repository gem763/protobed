He fanned Bryce Harper three times on his way to a career-best 251 strikeouts this season.\n\nStrasburg set a career high for wins this year and had a 3.32 ERA. Both Strasburg and fellow ace Max Scherzer would have at least regular rest for the NL wild-card game against either Milwaukee or St. Louis on Tuesday.\n\nManager Dave Martinez said he wouldn\u2019t name his starter for the wild-card until Saturday, which leaves open the option that Strasburg could appear in relief.\n\n\u201cYeah, I mean I\u2019m just here to help the ballclub in any way possible,\u201d Strasburg said when asked if he could appear as a reliever in the postseason. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take all 25 of us.\u201d\n\nAfter Harper said the heckling from Nationals fans went over the line Wednesday night, he drew a mix of boos and cheers his first time up. The former Washington star was then booed in the rest of his at-bats.\n\n\u201cI think today against Harp, but really against anyone, (Strasburg)\u2019s got all plus pitches that he can strike people out with,\u201d Nationals catcher Yan Gomes said.\n\n\u201cToday just happened that everything was working, we were able to set up Harp the way we wanted to and finish him off.\u201d\n\nMichael A. Taylor hit his first homer in over a year for the Nationals, who completed the first five-game sweep in franchise history. Washington went 14-5 against Philadelphia this season, including the final nine at home after dropping the first meeting on April 2.\n\nC\u00e9sar Hern\u00e1ndez hit his 13th homer and Andrew Knapp also connected as the Phillies lost their sixth straight and fell below .500 for the first time this season at 79-80.\n\nTaylor hit a solo homer in the second off Jason Vargas (7-9) to give the Nationals a 2-0 lead. It was his first home run since Aug. 9, 2018. Taylor later added a double and a single for his first three-hit performance of the season.\n\nThe Nationals scored three more in the fifth on a bases-loaded walk, a wild pitch and a passed ball to increase their lead to 5-1. Daniel Hudson earned his eighth save overall and sixth for Washington with a scoreless ninth.\n\nFRUSTRATED PHILLIES\n\nWhen asked if he understood how restless the Philadelphia fan base was becoming with possibly a seventh straight losing season in the works, Phillies manager Gabe Kapler answered \u201cabsolutely.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can fully understand disappointment right now. Everybody in that room is disappointed. I\u2019m extremely frustrated and disappointed myself. We\u2019re all feeling this together.\u201d\n\nNOLA OUT\n\nKapler has shut down ace Aaron Nola ahead of what would have been his last scheduled start of the season on Sunday against Miami. Nola will finish the season 12-7 with a 3.87 ERA in 202 1/3 innings pitched. It\u2019s the second straight season he\u2019s pitched more than 200 innings.\n\nFIRST PITCH\n\nAccompanied onto the field by Juan Soto, Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor threw out the first pitch to Martinez.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nPhillies: SS Jean Segura left in the fifth inning with a right ankle sprain and was replaced by Sean Rodr\u00edguez\n\nNationals: C Kurt Suzuki (right elbow) worked out again on Thursday throwing the ball and could catch as soon as Friday. \u201cHe\u2019s about 90 to 95 percent,\u201d manager Dave Martinez said. \u201cIf he feels good it\u2019s possible that he might play five, six innings tomorrow just to get him back out there and get him in that baseball routine again.\u201d Suzuki entered Thursday as a pinch-hitter in the seventh inning and flied out. He last started a game on Sept. 5.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPhillies: RHP Vince Velasquez (7-8, 4.76 ERA) makes his final start of the season as Philadelphia hosts Miami. Velasquez is 4-3 with a 4.06 ERA in 14 careers starts against the Marlins.\n\nNationals: RHP Austin Voth (1-1, 3.35 ERA) takes the mound at home against AL playoff-contending Cleveland in the final series of the regular season.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Washington Nationals' ace Stephen Strasburg turned in another vintage outing in what has been one the finest seasons of his career.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/26/phillies_nationals_baseball_62998_c0-96-2284-1427_s1770x1032.jpg?5d7bc980ff8d119a487f4ae0e15b5f65c9e85001", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
