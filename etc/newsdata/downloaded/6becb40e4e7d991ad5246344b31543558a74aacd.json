The winner was: \u201cSomeone else.\u201d This shadowy figure, who garnered nineteen per cent of the vote\u2014almost twice that of the next nearest contender\u2014was easily recognizable: he has the tall, lanky profile of former congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke, of El Paso. About half of those polled said that O\u2019Rourke should drop his Presidential bid and take on the Republican senator John Cornyn, whose approval rating is in the thirties. (Even Ted Cruz, whom O\u2019Rourke almost defeated last year, does better than that.) \u201cBeto, if you\u2019re listening: Come home,\u201d the Houston Chronicle said in an editorial after the poll was released. \u201cTexas needs you.\u201d He heard, but said that he would not run for the Senate \u201cin any scenario.\u201d\n\nFor many Democrats, that was a disappointing reply. Even if Donald Trump is defeated, the Democrats will need to pick up three Senate seats in order to gain control of the chamber and have a reasonable chance of turning their ambitious plans into legislative reality. If Trump wins, the crucial net gain will be four. (The Vice-President gets to break any tie; there would be an added complication should either Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders beat Trump\u2014the Republican governor of the winner\u2019s state would name an interim senator until a special election could be held.)\n\nThe urgency cannot be overstated. Supreme Court Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer are both in their eighties; whether Trump has an unimpeded choice to replace one or both of them, potentially remaking the Court in his Constitution-defying image, could come down to a couple of seats. It\u2019s not going to be so easy to get them. Republicans have to defend twenty-three of the thirty-five Senate seats on the ballot next year, but most of them are in deep-red states.\n\nThere are openings for the Democrats. One has already been taken: two weeks ago, in Colorado, the former governor John Hickenlooper abandoned his Presidential campaign, and he will now run against Senator Cory Gardner, instantly turning what had been a likely Republican win into a possible Democratic one. In Georgia, an increasingly purple state, there are now two Republican seats up for grabs. David Perdue, who is a cousin of Sonny Perdue, Trump\u2019s Secretary of Agriculture, is running for re\u00eblection, and Johnny Isakson announced last week that he would step down at the end of this year for health reasons. There is a Democrat who could be a formidable contender for either seat: Stacey Abrams, the former minority leader of the Georgia House of Representatives, who narrowly lost a highly contested governor\u2019s race last year. Abrams has said that she is not interested, even though, as in Texas, no other candidate commands the field. She intends to stay focussed on her voting-rights work, but she did say that she would \u201cbe honored\u201d to be considered as the Democrats\u2019 Vice-Presidential candidate.\n\nIn Arizona, Mark Kelly, a former Navy combat pilot and astronaut, is running against Senator Martha McSally, who lost last year to the Democrat Kyrsten Sinema but was appointed by the Republican governor to fill John McCain\u2019s seat after his death. Kelly is the husband of the former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who was seriously wounded eight years ago in a mass shooting at an event with her constituents in Tucson, which left six people dead. Since then, Giffords and Kelly have become tireless advocates for gun control. He is a well-known figure with a strong message in a state that seems ready to hear it.\n\nBut the Democrats have their own vulnerabilities. Doug Jones won in a special election in Alabama last year against Judge Roy Moore, a far-right extremist who was accused of sexual misconduct with teen-age girls. (Moore has denied the allegations.) Jones must now defend that seat in a state where Trump\u2019s approval rating is above sixty per cent. Unless Moore gets the Republican nomination again\u2014and he\u2019s trying\u2014Jones may have a short Senate career. In Michigan, the junior Democratic senator, Gary Peters, is facing a strong challenger in John James, an Iraq War veteran and a businessman, who, if elected, would be one of only two African-American Republicans in the Senate. In these states\u2014and in others that may be in play, such as Iowa, Maine, and North Carolina\u2014the essential message is the same: the candidates matter.\n\nThere is no imperative, at this point, for every low-polling Presidential contender to drop out of the race. Andrew Yang, for example, is using his candidacy to spur a conversation about universal basic income. And he is from New York, which has no Senate race next year. But, if there\u2019s a chance to take a seat, why not try? Governor Steve Bullock, of Montana, has been asked that question many times, because he could have a Hickenlooper-like effect on the Senate race in his home state. His answers boil down to this: the Senate is a miserable place, ill-suited for anyone who wants to \u201cget things done.\u201d The chamber has done much to earn that reputation, particularly under Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Yet the present morass only underscores how important it is to elect better senators. (The Senate is also a place where Montana, with a population of one million, has the same representation as California, with forty million\u2014something that might at least inspire Bullock.)\n\nEven O\u2019Rourke, for whom, just last year, being a senator was something of a dream job, said that running for the same office now \u201cwould not be good enough for El Paso and it would not be good enough for this country.\u201d He made that comment soon after a mass shooting in El Paso, in which the gunman targeted what he called a \u201cHispanic invasion.\u201d On a human level, it\u2019s understandable that O\u2019Rourke would want to directly take on Trump and his bigotry; on a political level, though, the logic is less clear. When Senator Kirsten Gillibrand left the Presidential race, last week, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s important to know when it\u2019s not your time, and to know how you can best serve your community and country.\u201d\n\nThere are many fronts on which the battle against Trumpism can be fought. More broadly, too much is lost if legislative politics, as practiced in Washington, is simply scorned. The Senate can be a safety net for our democracy, and, at the moment, it needs saving. Someone has to do it. \u2666", "description": "Control of the Senate will be crucial for Democrats in order for them to turn their ambitious plans into legislative reality whether Trump wins or loses, Amy Davidson Sorkin writes.", "authors": ["Amy Davidson Sorkin", "Dan Piepenbring", "Michael Schulman", "Hua Hsu", "Anna Shechtman", "James B.
