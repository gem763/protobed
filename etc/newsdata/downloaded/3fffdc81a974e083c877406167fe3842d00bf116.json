But Transnet has increased the number of carriages, which will hike the manganese volume from 19 656 tons to 23 625 tons per train.\n\nIt is designed to travel 861 km between Sishen in the Northern Cape and Saldanha in the Western Cape.\n\nTransnet considered increasing the manganese\u2019s rail capacity by upgrading the railway feeder lines and build new rolling stock, but then the project team explored new technology to increase the train's length instead. This will save Transnet a lot of money.\n\n\"Applying distributed power technology to increase the train length to 375 wagons will reduce capital requirements by over 90% of the initial estimate,\" Freight Rail General Manager for the iron ore and manganese business unit, Russell Baatjies, said in a statement.\n\nIt takes some eight minutes for the train to pass you by, from start to end, Engineering News reported.\n\nTransnet Freight Rail general manager, Brian Monakali, hailed the extended trains as a breakthrough for the heavy-haul railway industry in South Africa and other economies.\n\n\n\n\"Rio Tinto, Australia, recently started with the implementation of driverless trains in their Iron Ore railway system. Transnet has now successfully operationalised the 375-wagon train.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "It is designed to travel 861 km between Sishen in the Northern Cape and Saldanha in the Western Cape.", "authors": ["Khulekani Magubane"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2336/6a2d02202cae412381cde688ed167e60.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
