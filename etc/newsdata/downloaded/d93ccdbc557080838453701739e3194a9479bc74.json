Medical reports are that they are both physically unhurt,\" the organisation said in a statement.\n\nThe women were abducted on June 4 in Kumasi, Ghana's second largest city, located some 200km northwest of Accra.\n\nThey had been travelling in an Uber with a third Canadian woman.\n\nWhen they reached their destination, the pair got out of the taxi first and were kidnapped. The third woman then went to alert the police with the Uber driver.\n\nSecurity concerns\n\nOppong Nkrumah earlier sought to give security assurances.\n\n\"Citizens and travellers are once again assured that Ghana remains safe,\" he said.\n\nLast year, three Ghanaian women were kidnapped in the southern port of Takoradi.\n\nIn April this year, an Indian man was reportedly abducted, also in Kumasi, by an armed gang demanding a cash ransom. He was swiftly rescued by police. The Estonian consul was also briefly abducted in April, but released soon after.\n\nLocal media quoted President Nana Akufo-Addo this year as warning that action must be taken to ensure that kidnapping \"doesn't become a feature of our society\".\n\n\"Our brothers and sisters in Nigeria have known it,\" Akufo-Addo said.\n\n\"But we have not known it in this country, and we need to do something about it, to make sure that it doesn't become a feature of our society.\"\n\nPolice on Tuesday briefly detained Samuel Ofosu-Ampofo, the chairman of the largest opposition party, in connection with a spate of kidnappings.\n\nHe was later released but ordered to report back to the Criminal Investigations Department on Thursday, according to a post on the official police Twitter account.\n\nTourist hub\n\nGhana, a nation of some 30 million people, has long been seen as a bastion of stability in a region struggling to contain multiple groups of Islamist fighters.\n\nTourism accounts for around five percent of Ghana's GDP.\n\nThe country hosts more than 1.3 million visitors a year, pitching the image of a friendly destination with palm-fringed beaches.\n\nMany visitors, especially from North America, also come to see grim reminders of the slave trade.\n\nKumasi, the historic capital of the Ashanti kingdom, is a favourite destination.\n\nBritain's heir to the throne, Prince Charles, visited the Manhiyia royal place last November with his wife Camilla", "description": "Two young Canadian women freed from their kidnap ordeal by Ghanaian security forces were unharmed, the government says, after the development volunteers were snatched at a golf club in the city of Kumasi last week.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7977/3238d29eec0b458d86ff67bb3e67606c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-13"}
