Period. Consumers should have the flexibility to choose new online platforms without artificial barriers to entry. This bill creates long-overdue requirements that will boost competition and give consumers the power to move their data from one service to another,\u201d Hawley said in the statement.\n\n\"The tremendous dominance of a handful of large platforms also has major downsides \u2013 including few options for consumers who want to use social media to connect with friends, store their photos or just watch cat videos, but who face a marketplace with just a few major players and little in the way of real competition,\u201d said Warner.\n\nIn the statement, Blumenthal directly called out Google and Facebook.\n\n\u201cThe exclusive dominance of Facebook and Google have crowded out the meaningful competition that is needed to protect online privacy and promote technological innovation,\" he said. \"The bipartisan ACCESS Act would empower consumers to finally stand up to Big Tech and move their data to services that respect their rights.\"\n\nFacebook Vice President of U.S. Public Policy Kevin Martin expressed support for allowing users to move data in a statement to The Hill.\n\n\u201cWe believe people should be able to move their data from one service or app to another. We look forward to continuing our work with Sen. Warner and his colleagues, the Data Transfer Project and others on this important principle,\u201d Martin said.\n\nA company spokesperson also pointed out that CEO Mark Zuckerberg Mark Elliot ZuckerbergOn The Money: Trump dismisses 'phony Emoluments Clause' after Doral criticism | Senate Dems signal support for domestic spending package | House panel to consider vaping tax Hillicon Valley: Facebook removes Russian, Iranian accounts trying to interfere in 2020 | Zuckerberg on public relations blitz | Uncertainty over Huawei ban one month out Facebook to label content from state-run media MORE expressed support for data portability in a March Washington Post op-ed.\n\n\"If you share data with one service, you should be able to move it to another.
