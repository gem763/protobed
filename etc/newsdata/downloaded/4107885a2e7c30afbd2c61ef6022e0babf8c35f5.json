Company marketing is checked to prevent unsubstantiated or misleading environmental claims, known as greenwash.\n\n\u201cAny company director who thinks they can take a \u2018business as usual\u2019 approach to the marketplace is living in a fantasy land... you have to get creative around sustainability,\u201d says Baggs.\n\nWays to cut carbon emissions and restore ecosystems include buying green power, changing manufacturing processes, adjusting supply chains, using photovoltaic (PV) solar panels and supporting not-for-profit organisations such as Rainforest Alliance.\n\nThe world cannot avoid using resources. Batteries, PVs and electric vehicles still require mining.\n\nBut some brands already lead the way on sustainable thinking.\n\nSydney-based furniture, design and lifestyle company Koskela makes all its products in Australia \u2013 and to last. It also supports indigenous artists and artisans to earn a better living.\n\nThe ethos of founders Russel Koskela and Sasha Titchkosky \u2013 careful sourcing of materials, great design, high-quality craftsmanship, innovation, upcycling, repurposing and minimal environmental footprint \u2013 led to Certified B Corporation sustainability status in 2017.\n\nSwedish luxury carmaker Volvo is no newbie to sustainable design. In 1976, the company introduced the first three-way catalytic convertor to significantly reduce harmful exhaust pollutants \u2013 still used in almost every modern petrol car today.\n\nWe all know about Tesla. But in 2017, Volvo became the first traditional carmaker to commit to electrifying its entire range. Every new Volvo released from 2019 onwards will feature at least one electric motor, whether it\u2019s a mild hybrid (electric-motor-assisted petrol or diesel engine), a plug-in hybrid or fully electric vehicle.\n\nBy 2025, the Swedish company is targeting carbon-neutral manufacturing and wants 25 per cent of plastics in every new Volvo made from recycled materials. By then, it also expects half its car sales to be electric vehicles.\n\nElectric car manufacturing is one way car brands are driving sustainability. Supplied\n\nJulie Hutchinson, Marketing Director at Volvo Car Australia, said: \u201cIt\u2019s where we see the future moving, where we see our role in society, and how we can contribute to a better environment and minimise the impact we have.\u201d\n\nOther innovations being nurtured include a mobile phone-style subscription model for car buying, and the 360 Concept \u2013 a driverless car that acknowledges time as a precious resource for everyone. Free of traditional controls such as a steering wheel, it allows people to relax, meet or even sleep on the move.\n\n\u201cVolvo\u2019s vision is to give people one week back a year through saving time during the daily commute during rush hour, through autonomous-drive alternatives... to improve the quality of people\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\nThe retail world is also showing signs of going greener, pushed by regulation and consumer pressure.\n\nIn 2016, discount store chain Kmart launched its \u2018Better Together\u2019 sustainability plan to reduce store energy use, cut waste, and improve employment equality, diversity and working conditions.\n\nIts Ethical Sourcing Code commits suppliers and their factories to stricter workplace health, safety, security, pay and training standards.\n\nOutdoor-gear brand Patagonia makes clothes that last. Its Worn Wear initiative allows customers to swap their old gear for credit towards new purchases. The used gear is patched up, cleaned and sold on.\n\nThese brands and innovative individuals understand that sustainability covers environmental, economic and social impact. They are raising the \u2018profit with a purpose\u2019 bar and challenging the status quo.\n\nThe buzzwords of sustainability have long been organic, eco-friendly, recycling and renewables. Expect the new conversations to include words such as data, metrics, systems thinking, innovation, behavioural psychology and restoration.\n\nKatie Patrick concludes: \u201cThe whole \u2018Saving the World\u2019 thing is actually doable. If everybody wanted to make it happen, we could make it happen.\u201d\n\nOmtanke isn\u2019t just a word. It\u2019s a lens through which you can view the world, and see things differently. It\u2019s a new perspective. A considerate, more caring one. Omtanke shines a brighter light on the things that really matter, and that helps us focus on making those things better.
