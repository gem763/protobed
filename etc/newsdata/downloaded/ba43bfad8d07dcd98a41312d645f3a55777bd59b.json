This morning a CNN commentator said on national television that I\u2019m an asset of Russia. Completely despicable.\u201d\n\nPete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, and a veteran of the war in Afghanistan, told Ms Gabbard she was \u201cdead wrong\u201d.\n\nHe said the \u201cslaughter\u201d in Syria was not a consequence of the American presence there but a result of abandoning allies. He said Mr Trump\u2019s actions were taking away the \"honour\" of US troops and that they \"betrayed\" American credibility. He suggested that a small number of specialised troops in Syria was the only thing preventing a genocide.\n\nOther candidates on the debate stage took turns to slam Mr Trump for abandoning America\u2019s allies and damaging US credibility across the world, in the eyes of friends and foes.\n\nElizabeth Warren said she believed the US had to get out of the Middle East and should not have troops there, but needed to do it the right way by negotiating a solution. \u201cThis president created a bigger than ever humanitarian crisis,\u201d said the Massachusetts senator.\n\nVermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who has long criticised and voted against military interventions in the Middle East, said Turkey was not a US ally when it invaded another country and engaged in \u201cmass slaughter\u201d. He said Mr Trump's actions would result in no country trusting the word of the United States or believe \u201cthis pathological liar\u201d, referring to the president.\n\nKamala Harris, a senator from California, said Mr Trump had given thousands of Isis prisoners a \"get out of jail card\u201d and suggested that the winners of the latest move are Russia, Bashar al-Assad, Iran and Isis.\n\nFormer vice-president Joe Biden called Mr Trump\u2019s move \u201cthe most shameful thing\u201d that any president had done in modern history and said US commanders across the board were ashamed.\n\nIn response to Ms Gabbard, he said that the US policy in Syria was not about regime change, but making sure the regime did not \u201cwipe people out\u201d in the border area.\n\nMr Biden said that if Isis prisoners escaped, they would go back to Europe, adding that some could make it to the US.\n\nBeto O'Rourke, a former congressman from Texas, picked up on that point saying the United States may have to send \u201canother generation of American soldiers\u201d back to fight Isis. He also suggested the US should invest more in diplomacy and the state department, to be able to rely more on the experience of diplomats rather than on soldiers aged 18 or 19.\n\nJulian Castro, former secretary of housing and urban development under Barack Obama, said Mr Trump \u201ccages kids on the border\u201d and \u201clets ISIS prisoners run free\u201d.", "description": "Tulsi Gabbard and Pete Buttigieg \u2013 the two military veterans among Democratic candidates for the 2020 nomination \u2013 clashed at the latest debate over Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw American troops from northern Syria.", "authors": ["Negar Mortazavi"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/16/02/democratic-debate-democrats-westerville-ohio-2020-tulsi-gabbard.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
