But not everyone was convinced.\n\nSeparate footage has led some users to question whether the unidentified object is actually a living creature at all.\n\nImage copyright The Paper Image caption Millions have watched footage of the item, but some think it might be a piece of simple rubbish\n\nPopular news website The Paper shared separate footage of something long and black moving in the water that appeared to be less animated.\n\nIt asked if the whole thing was simply \"a rumour\" - and interviewed a biologist, Ding Li, who said that the object was neither a fish nor a snake, but simply \"a floating object\".\n\nA picture has since gone viral showing a long piece of black cloth washed up on some rocks, fuelling discussion this might have been the mysterious object.\n\nImage copyright The Paper Image caption The appearance of some cloth washed up on some rocks has got users asking if they were mistaken\n\nBoth have led to jokes about whether the local government was trying to attract tourism to the area, given the millions of dollars involved in building and maintaining the Three Gorges Dam.\n\nOthers have made jokes about the quality of the footage, despite the rapid development in China of high quality smartphones.\n\nSome joked that the user obviously didn't have a Huawei phone. Another said: \"Monsters always appear only when there are few pixels.\"\n\nSo what does live in the Yangtze?\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Giant Chinese salamanders live in the Yangtze river. They can grow to 1.8 metres in length\n\nThe Yangtze River is the longest river in Asia, and at 3,900 miles in length (6,300km), is the third longest in the world.\n\nBut pollution has severely affected the river in recent years, meaning that its ecosystem has become narrower, rather than wider.\n\nThe largest creature thought to exist in the waters at present is the Chinese giant salamander, which can reach some 1.8m in length.\n\nThis species is critically endangered, largely as a result of pollution.\n\nImage copyright Zhang Peng/Getty Images Image caption The Three Gorges Dam is the world's latest hydroelectric dam\n\nChina's other 'Nessies'\n\nChina is no stranger to conspiracy theories about mythical creatures lurking in the deep.\n\nSince 1987, questions have been asked about whether a \"Lake Monster\" exists in the Kanas Lake in north-western Xinjiang, following numerous reports of sightings.\n\nHowever, specialists believe that this is a giant taimen, a species of salmon that can grow to 180cm long, the official China Daily said.\n\nMore recently, in August 2017, footage went viral showing an unusual water creature seemingly raising its head in the waters of Luoping County in Southwest Yunnan province.\n\nOfficials, however, dismissed the \"monster\" as either an alligator, or a piece of floating rubbish.\n\nBBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.
