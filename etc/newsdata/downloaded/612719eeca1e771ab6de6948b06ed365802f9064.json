The framers \u2013 the 55 state delegates to the Constitutional Convention who authored the Constitution \u2013 had just completed fighting the Revolutionary War, which had ended six years earlier.\n\nWhile Americans universally revere the American Revolution today, that was not the case at the time it was fought. Professor Bernard Bailyn of Harvard, whose 75 years of professional study of the colonial mindset is without peer, has argued that in the 1780s about one-third of the colonists supported the revolution, while around the same number favored staying in the British Empire, and about the same number were indifferent.\n\nBy 1787, according to Bailyn, there were substantial groups of wealthy persons in America who retained their loyalty to the British king, and there were government officials here who had originally obtained their jobs by royal appointment.\n\nBailyn has documented fatal violence occurring on American soil between Americans loyal to the king and Americans loyal to the principles of the Declaration of Independence after the British surrender in 1781 and even after the signing of the Treaty of Paris in 1783.\n\nCan the president lawfully enforce only the clauses of the Constitution with which he agrees and ignore those with which he disagrees? In a word: No.\n\nAll of this was known to the framers, who feared the resurgence of British influence in the American government. Their fears centered around the corruption induced by titles of nobility \u2013 which in those days were often accompanied by lands and income \u2013 and gifts of money or real estate.\n\nIn order to allay those fears and assure Americans that officials in the new federal government would be immune from foreign seduction, the framers included the Emoluments Clause in the Constitution.\n\nThat clause prohibits all federal officials from receiving titles of nobility and any gift, income or fee \"of any kind whatever\" from a foreign government.\n\nThe Constitution is known for phrases of generality and elasticity, the meanings of which are often capable of reinterpretation by modern standards. This is not so for the Emoluments Clause. It originally presented and continues to present an absolute prohibition of the receipt of anything of value by a federal government officeholder from a foreign government.\n\nLast week, Mick Mulvaney, the president's acting chief of staff, announced a novel interpretation of this clause contending that it only prohibited \"profits\" to federal officeholders from foreign governments.\n\nBy that interpretation, Mulvaney announced, Trump was able to offer a resort in South Florida owned substantially by a family corporation he controls as the host of his next meeting of G-7 \u2013 a group that includes heads of government from six foreign countries \u2013 so long as the resort did not earn a profit from the gathering.\n\nAfter a weekend of torrential criticism, Trump announced that he had changed his mind and said he would not host the G-7 meeting at the Miami area resort. Yet, in the process of doing so, he characterized the Emoluments Clause as \"phony.\"\n\nWho knows what he meant by phony? The clause is in the Constitution and it means what it says. Yet, whatever Trump meant by phony, it constituted at least a disparagement of the Constitution he has sworn to uphold and at worst a threat to ignore clauses he can disparage.\n\nThis is most unusual and potentially dangerous, and it raises the question: Can the president lawfully enforce only the clauses of the Constitution with which he agrees and ignore those with which he disagrees? In a word: No.\n\nThe doctrine of the separation of powers \u2013 which is the backbone of the Constitution \u2013 states that Congress writes the laws, the president enforces them, and the courts interpret them. It also offers that the governmental roles of the three branches cannot be intermingled or traded without doing violence to the personal liberties that the separation was intended to secure.\n\nIf the president could pick and choose which laws to enforce and which parts of the Constitution to ignore, he effectively would be deciding what the laws mean \u2013 a judicial function \u2013 and which laws have vitality and which do not \u2013 a congressional function.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTrump has become known for forceful and often tasteless banter. He publicly calls people crude names, uses foul language and sends dog whistles of lawless behavior to much of his base. All that is a question of free speech, personal taste and political risk.\n\nBut threats to ignore parts of the Constitution are not matters of speech, taste or risk. They reveal character traits that question Trump's fitness for office.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO", "description": "Donald Trump took the presidential oath of office promising that he would faithfully execute his obligation to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution.
