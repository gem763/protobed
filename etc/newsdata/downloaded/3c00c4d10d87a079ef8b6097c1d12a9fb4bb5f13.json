This week, she's fifth.\n\n\"A month ago, if someone was calling and offering her a million dollars it would have been so important,\" Kaplan said.\n\nIn fact, earlier this year, Andreescu signed a sponsorship deal worth about $50,000 with Copper Branch, a plant-based eatery chain with more than 50 locations mostly across Ontario and Quebec.\n\nEatery eyes contract extension with Andreescu\n\nBut with her U.S. Open victory in hand, her financial situation allows her to take her time and determine what brands the young star wants to associate herself with.\n\nWatch highlights from Bianca Andreescu's U.S. Open victory:\n\nBianca Andreescu becomes the first Canadian in history to win a Grand Slam singles title with her straight-set victory over Serena Williams. 1:45\n\nAndrew Infantino, marketing director at Copper Branch, says the chain signed her after searching for an up-and-coming athlete from Ontario and believed a tennis player would be a good fit considering their season would be coming up in the summer.\n\nThe Copper Branch contract ends in early 2020, but the eatery hopes to extend it or sign a new one.\n\nUntil it runs out, Copper Branch plans to continue using her image on menu boards and its website, but also wants to ramp up the connection between Andreescu and the chain.\n\nIt may place lifesize cutouts of the tennis star in its stores and may add an Andreescu-themed menu item, Infantino said.\n\nKaplan said the Mississauga, Ont., teen seems to embody the Canadian identity well and that's one of the things fans and brands likely love about her.\n\nSome noted her quintessentially Canadian response to winning the final match when Andreescu apologized to the stadium crowd for beating Williams.\n\nInternational interest likely\n\nKaplan said she will likely consider what brands best represent her image, adding Tim Hortons and Canadian Tire spring to mind as natural fits. Canada's major grocers and even some of the country's banks may vie for a piece of Andreescu, he said.\n\nIn some categories, Andreescu won't have the option to choose a homegrown brand, he said, and will affiliate with an international brand.\n\nStill, Kaplan hopes she maintains relationships with her initial sponsors following her rise to fame and grandfathers in companies like Copper Branch, which endorsed her at the beginning.\n\nCopper Branch, naturally, echoed that sentiment.\n\nInfantino is sure Andreescu will ask for more money at the renegotiating table and he's not certain if the company will be able to afford her going forward.\n\n\"But we're also hoping that since we were one of the first, potentially we could get maybe an offer that's similar to what we have,\" he said.\n\n\"But I guess that we'll have to see.\"", "description": "Canadian tennis sensation Bianca Andreescu won $3.85 million US for beating Serena Williams in the women's final at the U.S. Open on Saturday, but it's likely that paycheque is only the beginning of million-dollar payouts from future sponsorship deals.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5276513.1568055428!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/andreescu-bianca-us-open-trophy-190907-1180.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
