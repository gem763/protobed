Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told MPs.\n\nHe said the government was considering taking Northern Rail - one of the country\u2019s biggest rail operators - out of private ownership and placing it in the hands of a state-owned operator.\n\nGiving evidence to the Commons\u2019 Transport Select Committee, he said the level of performance on the Northern network \u201ccannot continue\u201d.\n\nLast night Labour \u2019s shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said:\u201d Northern Rail\u2019s incompetent operator should have been stripped of its contract years ago over its abysmal performance record. The government\u2019s refusal to do so has meant massive inconvenience for rail passengers and damage to the region\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201cThe service should be taken into public ownership at the soonest opportunity, but so should the rest of the railway. A railway is an interconnected system that will work best when it is integrated under public ownership, as Labour will do.\u201c\n\nThe Department for Transport confirmed it was \u201cdeveloping contingency plans\u201d for replacing the franchise with a new short-term management contract with Northern or the OLR.\n\nIt said it has the \u201cright to terminate\u201d Northern\u2019s existing deal if it finds it is \u201cin default of its current contract and that default was material and not capable of remedy\u201d.\n\nMr Shapps told the committee he looked up \u201con time\u201d statistics showing the percentage of scheduled stops at stations which trains are making within a minute of the timetable.\n\n(Image: Evening Gazette)\n\nHe said: \u201cNorthern\u2019s current performance sits at 57%, literally just better than a one in two chance of a train arriving on time.\n\n\u201cThat has actually fallen in the last six months from 61% in March, while the UK average sits at 65.1%.\n\n\u201cNearly two-thirds of all trains arrive on time but if you\u2019re on Northern it\u2019s not much over half. That is a big gap.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve started to take action.\u201d\n\nNorthern has previously admitted it will continue to use outdated Pacer trains next year, despite a pledge to replace them by the end of 2019.\n\nMr Shapps described the trains as a \u201csymbol of the old railway continuing\u201d, adding: \u201cThat is very frustrating and it all plays into the overall concern I have about the set up.\u201d\n\nGerman-based Arriva holds the franchise, which is due to run until March 2025, but the operator has been under fire in recent years due to widespread disruption.\n\nThe chaotic introduction of new timetables in May 2018 saw up to 310 trains a day cancelled.\n\nAndy Burnham and Steve Rotheram, the mayors of Greater Manchester and the Liverpool City Region, have repeatedly called for Northern to be stripped of its franchise.\n\n(Image: Reuters)\n\nIn May, the pair issued a joint statement claiming the firm had \u201cconsistently failed\u201d to deliver its legally binding requirements.\n\nThe Department for Transport\u2019s OLR began running East Coast Main Line services in June last year under the London North Eastern Railway brand.\n\nThis followed the failure of the Virgin Trains East Coast (VTEC) franchise.\n\nDavid Brown, managing director at Northern, said the firm had faced several challenges in the past couple of years, outside the direct control of Northern.\n\nThe biggest problems have been the continuing late delivery of major infrastructure upgrades, including the North West electrification, which is more than two years late.\n\nMr Brown added: \u201cArriva and Northern remain fully committed to delivering the transformation of the North\u2019s railways and improving customers\u2019 experience. We are delivering the biggest transformation of local rail for a generation.\u201d", "description": "Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has taken the first step in returning the routes to government control", "authors": ["Mark Ellis", "Image", "Pa", "Evening Gazette", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article12652384.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Rail-timetable-changes1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
