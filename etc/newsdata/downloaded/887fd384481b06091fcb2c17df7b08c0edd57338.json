Tom Seaver. Don Drysdale.\n\nPlus the guys he saw in person as a kid \u2014 Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling \u2014 when they dominated in October.\n\nNow in the midst of perhaps the most remarkable run in baseball history, it's his turn, starting Game 1 of the World Series.\n\nTime to deliver\n\n\"The people you keep referring to,\" Cole said Monday, \"got the job done. So I'm trying to deliver on that front.\"\n\nBecause as we all know, heading into Tuesday night's opener between his Houston Astros and the Washington Nationals, this is when reputations are built \u2014 or wrecked.\n\nMadison Bumgarner, Orel Hershiser and Pedro Martinez excelled in their first Series starts. So did Clayton Kershaw, although his ledger is more checkered.\n\nCole enters this matchup against fellow ace Max Scherzer at 19-0 in his last 25 starts, including three wins in the playoffs. No pitcher has ever won 20 in a row in a single season.\n\n'Storybook endings'\n\n\"I mean, I've been in the situation, faced really good pitchers here in the National League over the years; Kershaw, [Jacob] deGrom, those guys. You just know you've got to come out there, you're going to be throwing up zeros. And you've got to try to match the intensity from your opponent,\" Scherzer said.\n\n\"And Cole's had a terrific year. So obviously it's going to one heck of a challenge.\"\n\nWATCH | Altuve's walk-off sends Astros to World Series:\n\nJose Altuve belted a series-winning, walk-off home run in the 9th inning to give the Houston Astros a 6-4 victory over the New York Yankees in Game 6 of the ALCS. 2:13\n\nCole led the majors in strikeouts, topped the AL in ERA and finished second in the big leagues to teammate Justin Verlander in wins.\n\n\"When you dream as a little kid, you dream about storybook endings and storybook players and scenarios like that,\" Cole said.\n\nIn the old days of baseball \u2014 like, three or four years ago \u2014 this is about the time someone would step up and say, well, he's due for a loss.\n\nBut really, is he?\n\nSome kind of monster\n\nFusing his talent with the Astros' fortified analytics approach, Cole has found what works best for him. Among the results with his four-seamer, curve and slider: Nearly 17 per cent of his pitches result in a swing-and-miss, the highest rate of anyone since such data has been tracked in the last 18 years.\n\nAsked recently whether he'd ever seen someone on this kind of run, Verlander answered, \"Never.\"\n\nAll this, along with the prospect of earning well over a $200 million US contract in free agency after the World Series ends.\n\nYet if any of this is going to Cole's head, by the way, it hasn't been apparent.\n\nOn Monday at Minute Maid Park, when the 29-year-old right-hander walked into a small interview room to do a news conference, Astros manager AJ Hinch was finishing up at the podium.\n\nWithout fanfare, Cole simply sat down on the well-worn carpet and bided his time for a couple minutes, silently picking at his fingernails.", "description": "Gerrit Cole rattles off the names of the pitching greats with ease, featuring the same command he shows with his vaunted four-seam fastball.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5329554.1571698872!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/cole-scherzer-102019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
