He can\u2019t get out of bed and can be in huge pain sometimes.\n\n\u2018It can be very upsetting when he gets in a low mood because it\u2019s very hard for him to think positively.\n\nThe gaping hole in his back could easily have fit a fist in it, says mum Michelle (Picture: Michelle Ruffold/Caters News)\n\n\u2018He\u2019s a social butterfly and an outgoing boy. He should be out playing with his mates not lying in bed all day.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChae, from Eastbourne, East Sussex, said: \u2018I\u2019m in pain all the time and I\u2019m fed up with it all.\n\n\u2018I just want to get on with my life.\u2019\n\nMichele said: \u2018The wound is getting bigger by the day, it\u2019s rotting him away very gradually.\n\n\u2018We need this surgery otherwise it will get worse, it\u2019ll allow him to start healing again.\n\nFive people stabbed in Manchester shopping centre as man, 40, arrested\n\n\u2018We haven\u2019t been able to sit around the table and eat for two years.\n\n\u2018We can\u2019t go out, we can\u2019t do anything as a family, we haven\u2019t been able to go on holiday.\n\n\u2018You have to keep your spirits up and stay positive and just keep upbeat.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s in pain every day, he has to take cocktails of adult painkillers, they make him quite drowsy and not himself.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s just heartbreaking to see.\u2019\n\nYou can help the family raise money for Chae\u2019s surgery on GoFundMe.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
