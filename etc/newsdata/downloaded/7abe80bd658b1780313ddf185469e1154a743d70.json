It owns about 200 data centers spanning roughly 10 million square feet of space. Business customers own the racks and servers inside the data centers and they pay Equinix per square foot. Equinix provides the space and uses cooling techniques to make sure the infrastructure doesn\u2019t overheat, which requires a lot of energy.\n\nEquinix said that last year, renewable energy covered more than 90% of its needs, up from about 30% in 2014, helped by contracts that enable it to buy large amounts of renewable energy. Some of its sources include wind farms in Oklahoma and Texas and certified green power from suppliers in Europe.\n\nThe company is considering ways to cut down on energy usage at its data centers, such as by using energy-efficient lighting systems and tapping artificial intelligence to identify opportunities for energy savings.\n\nThe company has spent $100 million in energy efficiency upgrades and retrofits to its data centers since 2011. It said its investments since that year have helped avoid 330,000 metric tons of carbon emissions that would have otherwise been produced if Equinix tapped traditional sources of electricity. That\u2019s equivalent to the emissions from 77,000 cars on the road for one year, the company said.\n\nEquinix\u2019s energy-efficiency efforts also have accelerated in recent years in part because of investors such as BlackRock Inc., which are demanding sustainability strategies, Mr. Meyers said.\n\nBlackRock declined to comment, but the firm lists environmental issues as a key principle that can lead to long-term value creation, according to its January corporate governance guidelines.\n\nInformation-technology leaders of businesses ranging from crafts marketplace Etsy Inc. to software maker Atlassian Corp. have chosen to play a bigger role in reducing the energy consumption of the hardware and software at the core of their companies.\n\nChanging demographics have also helped push Equinix to think about sustainability, Mr. Meyers said.\n\n\u201cWhen we try to attract new talent, they often want to talk to us about what we\u2019re doing in those areas,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to work for a company they feel is ideally doing good things for the planet, certainly not doing it harm.\u201d\n\nMillennials, the generation born roughly between 1981 and 1996, will represent the largest group of workers at Equinix within the next few quarters, he said. The company employs about 10,000 people, including contractors.\n\nEquinix joins organizations that have been touting their sustainability efforts in recent months with the goal of attracting environmentally conscious customers. IT-services and document-storage company Iron Mountain Inc., for example, is selling data-center customers on solar, wind and other renewable-energy sources by extolling benefits including lower electricity bills.\n\nSustainability initiatives make Equinix more attractive to customers, Mr. Meyers said. \u201cThere are definitely a number of customers that say, unless you can give us a [sustainability] commitment\u2026we\u2019ll rank you relative to your peers in a less favorable way,\u201d he said.\n\nWrite to Sara Castellanos at sara.castellanos@wsj.com", "description": "Renewable energy is top of mind for Charles Meyers, chief executive of data-center landlord Equinix, he said, in part because environmental sustainability helps attract customers and talent.", "authors": ["Sara Castellanos", "Sara.Castellanos Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-104477/social", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
