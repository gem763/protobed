Then came the arrests which reinforced Biden\u2019s Giuliani strategy.\n\n\u201cThey just got arrested at the airport, with one-way tickets out of the country,\u201d Biden told donors Thursday night. \u201cThey\u2019ve been indicted. They\u2019ve been indicted.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s newfound focus on Giuliani is an outgrowth of the vice president\u2019s ramped-up approach toward Trump. Biden directly called for his impeachment this week for the first time, and aggressively attacked the president on what his campaign believes are major vulnerabilities: corruption and dishonesty.\n\n\u201cRudy is in so many ways a perfect messenger for exactly what this administration stands for, and that's why voters reject it,\u201d Biden deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield said, underscoring the campaign\u2019s eagerness to use Giuliani as a White House poster boy.\n\nBedingfield also delighted in Trump\u2019s attempt to put distance between himself and Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman after their indictments \u2014 a problem since the president and his son and namesake had been separately photographed with the two Soviet-born Florida business men. Before they were arrested Wednesday night at Dulles International Airport, Giuliani was supposed to meet the men in Vienna.\n\n\u201cGiuliani's cronies \u2014 who Trump pretends not to know even though he\u2019s pictured with them multiple times giving the thumbs up, no less \u2014 have been arrested trying to flee the country, one day before Rudy was scheduled to join them in Vienna and hours after dining with him at the Trump Hotel,\u201d Bedingfield noted.\n\nPolls show Giuliani is deeply unpopular and likely a liability for Trump when it comes to public opinion \u2014 a fact noted both by Biden advisers as well as by members of Trump\u2019s inner circle, one of whom described the indictments and Giuliani\u2019s previous and widely panned performances on cable news as a \u201cdisaster.\u201d\n\nOnly 31 percent of voters have a favorable impression of Giuliani while 53 percent view him unfavorably, giving the former mayor a negative net favorability rating of -22, according to a Fox News poll released this week but taken before the indictments of his associates. Trump\u2019s net favorability rating is also negative, -13, while Biden\u2019s is positive at +6 in the poll.\n\nUnderpinning Rudy\u2019s poor standing with voters: a relatively high number of Republicans view him unfavorably (29 percent) while independents give him a negative net rating of -41 and Democrats of -58. Giuliani only polls better with Democrats when compared to Trump in the Fox poll.\n\n\u201cThe president would be better served if Rudy wasn\u2019t on television,\u201d said a top Trump advisor, echoing three other similar sources. \u201cThe president would be better off if Rudy was not the face of this. No one really likes him but somehow we\u2019re stuck with him.\u201d\n\nGiuliani did not return calls and messages for comment.\n\nA former Giuliani adviser, Rick Wilson, said the former mayor and federal prosecutor \u201clost his way\u201d as he became a lobbyist and insider. He had his own deals overseas and got so entangled in them, Wilson said , that he was like Trump\u2019s now-convicted former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, who had so many interests in Russia and Ukraine that \u201che became like an Eastern European warlord.\u201d\n\nGiuliani, Wilson said, was transmogrifying into an object of ridicule akin to a Looney Tunes cartoon character known for failed schemes that perpetually backfire on him.\n\n\u201cRudy has become the Wile E. Coyote of this scandal,\u201d said Wilson, who advised Giuliani as New York mayor, potential U.S. Senate candidate in 2000 and then presidential candidate in 2008.\n\n\u201cRudy\u2019s out there running off of cliffs, smacking into road signs and watching his own schemes just blow up on him to defend Trump,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cAnd if defending Trump is like catching the Road Runner, Giuliani is going to do that everyday and fail, no matter how absurd the situation is that he finds himself in.\u201d\n\nThe animus between Biden and Giuliani traces back decades, famously surfacing in their respective failed bids for the presidency in 2008, when Biden went on to join Barack Obama\u2019s successful ticket and served as vice president until 2017.\n\nAt the time they were running, Biden accused Giuliani \u2014 who had earned high marks for managing New York City after 9/11 that he was nicknamed \u201cAmerica\u2019s mayor\u201d \u2014 of cynically using the tragedy for political gain years later.\n\n\u201cThere's only three things he [needs] to make ... a sentence: a noun and a verb and 9/11,\u201d Biden joked , calling Giuliani \u201cprobably the most underqualified man since George Bush to seek the presidency.\u201d\n\nGiuliani biographer Andrew Kirtzman said the 9/11 jibe would have stung the former New York mayor.\n\n\"His 9/11 halo was everything to Giuliani \u2014 his experience that day changed him and became intrinsic to who he was. He had to have been deeply angered by what Biden said,\" Kirtzman said.\n\nEarlier this year, Giuliani fired back at Biden over the 1994 crime bill that had become something of a political liability for the Democrat in the primary. Both Biden and Giuliani had worked for its passage.\n\n\u201cThe 1994 Crime Bill passed by Pres. Clinton and Speaker Gingrich, with Biden & Schumer as the leaders in Senate and House, helped me and the NYPD reduce murder from @ 1,900 a year to @ 500 and then under Mayor Bloomberg to @ 350. That\u2019s over 20,000 lives saved,\u201d Giuliani tweeted on May 15, before Trump\u2019s latest attacks on the law.\n\nReferring to pressure on Biden to disavow the bill, Giuliani added: \u201cJoe don\u2019t cave.\u201d\n\nBiden isn\u2019t the only Democratic presidential candidate to zero in on Giuliani: Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar called on Attorney General Bob Barr and the Federal Election Commission to investigate Giuliani for potential campaign finance violations.\n\nMore than a year after Trump took office \u2014 and after the president\u2019s personal attorney was convicted in a separate federal campaign finance scheme involving hush-money payoffs to a porn star \u2014 Giuliani began working as Trump\u2019s personal lawyer in Ukraine.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/5b/48/9e2282cc4bdc8f056865e09c54f9/artboard-1.png\"\n\nSince then, Giuliani has been the prime force driving Trump to focus on attacking Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, over a lucrative consulting contract for a Ukrainian natural gas company, Burisma, when his father served as vice president.\n\nA Ukrainian prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, had been investigating Burisma, and Joe Biden successfully pushed for his ouster; Giuliani and Trump have characterized the situation as a quid pro quo.\n\nBut the prosecutor\u2019s investigation into Burisma had stalled long before, numerous Ukrainian officials say, and Shokin\u2019s ouster was due to standing U.S. policy and international pressure to get rid of him because of perceptions he was corrupt and ineffective.\n\nIn TV appearances, Giuliani has waved around an affidavit signed by the disgraced former prosecutor who swears he was dismissed because of the Burisma investigation. Unmentioned by Giuliani: the affidavit is filed on behalf of a Ukrainian gas magnate, Dmitry Firtash, who is employing two Trump loyalist attorneys to fight extradition to the U.S. in another corruption scheme.\n\nAn ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Firtash lives in Vienna, where Giuliani\u2019s now-indicted associates, Parnas and Fruman, were headed on one-way tickets.\n\nBoth Giuliani and Trump have pressed Ukrainian officials behind the scenes to reopen the investigation into the Bidens. During a phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president in July, Trump asked for an investigation into Biden as the United States withheld financial aid \u2014 a move that led to the impeachment inquiry in the House.\n\nAt first, Giuliani denied on television that he ever pressed Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. But he reversed himself in the same Sept. 19 interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo, admitting that, yes, he did push for the investigation.\n\nThe Biden campaign reacted to Giuliani\u2019s double-talk by calling on cable news to ban him, asserting that he\u2019s a fount of disinformation.\n\nAt the same time Giuliani had been trying to gin up an investigation of Hunter Biden and the natural gas company he worked for, a group of businessmen and GOP donors name-dropping Giuliani and Trump were reportedly working in Ukraine to get a piece of lucrative natural gas contracts steered to Trump allies. Giuliani\u2019s entanglements have become so suspect that conservative columnists have also fretted that he\u2019s \u201ctaking Trump for a ride.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, when Biden first called clearly for Trump\u2019s impeachment, the candidate singled out Giuliani himself, mocking his ethics.\n\nNew York Playbook Our must-read briefing informing the daily conversation among knowledgeable New Yorkers.

The abuse of power is the defining characteristic of the Trump presidency.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, Giuliani\u2019s name was brought up again, this time with House impeachment managers, who took testimony from U.S. diplomat, Marie Yovanovitch. She had been ousted from her job in Ukraine after Giuliani became a point man in spreading unfounded smears in right-wing media against her.\n\n\u201cI do not know Mr. Giuliani's motives for attacking me,\u201d she said in a written statement. \u201cBut individuals who have been named in the press as contacts of Mr. Giuliani may well have believed that their personal financial ambitions were stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine.\"\n\nMeanwhile, other Republicans, such as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, ducked for cover and had to return what they believed had been tainted political contributions from Parnas and Fruman.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign reacted with a fundraising pitch to donors.\n\n\u201cThe tide is turning,\u201d the campaign wrote. \u201cThese Trump allies who helped Rudy Giuliani try to smear Joe Biden in Ukraine will face a court of law and the Trump Administration is facing an impeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\nSally Goldenberg contributed to this report.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/8f/41/eaa45a8e4aa7819748b65d8ce6ca/191012-joe-biden-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
