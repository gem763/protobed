But market observers Wednesday pointed to optimism on the trade front, as Bloomberg reported that China was open to reaching a partial deal.\n\nLater Wednesday, investors will listen closely to any fresh signals from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell in a speech in Kansas City. The Fed will increase its purchases of short-term securities soon in an effort to avoid stress in lending markets, Mr. Powell said Tuesday.\n\nThe U.S. central bank will later Wednesday release the minutes from its September meeting, which will likely be scrutinized for any insight into the interest-rate outlook, though economic data and market events since that meeting may have changed policy makers' views.\n\n\"What the Fed minutes discuss is likely to be stale information,\" said Jordan Rochester, foreign exchange strategist at Nomura Bank. \"The data has deteriorated since they had their discussion. After the poor manufacturing figures more recently, they softened their tones.\"\n\nThe yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note was 1.563%, up from 1.532% Tuesday. Yields rise as prices fall.\n\nAmong individual companies, Johnson & Johnson shares fell 0.9% after a Philadelphia jury ordered the company to pay $8 billion in damages to a man who said that using antipsychotic drug Risperdal caused enlarged breasts.\n\nIn Japan, the benchmark Nikkei 225 index slipped 0.6% as data on machine-tool orders confirmed a bleak picture for the country's manufacturing sector.\n\nThe \"numbers remain abysmal,\" analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a note. \"The absence of any hints of a sustainable recovery suggests that industrial production in Japan, and output globally, looks set to stay subdued in year-on-year terms,\" they said.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 0.8% amid tensions over protests in the city.\n\nKaren Langley contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Anna Isaac at anna.isaac@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 09, 2019 10:16 ET (14:16 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
