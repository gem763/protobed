It first launched in 2014 and ran from Oct. 10 through Oct. 14 last year. Experts say this will be the biggest \u201cBig Billion Days\u201d ever.\n\nIn May 2018, Walmart Inc. WMT, +0.19% announced it would take a $16 billion, 77% stake in Flipkart, which calls itself the \u201cleading\u201d e-commerce marketplace in India. The company says that millions of people are already shopping and otherwise engaging with the site, though neither Walmart or Flipkart provided sales totals for the first day.\n\nIn 2018, Walmart said Flipkart sales for the entire event were up 80% from the previous year.\n\nIn preparation for this year\u2019s event and beyond, Flipkart has launched a Hindi site, delivery speed has improved, financing programs and other measures have been taken to reach customers who manage their money outside of traditional banks, and affordability across different categories, like refurbished goods, has been revamped.\n\n\u201cBy all indications this is going to be the biggest festive season that India has witnessed,\u201d said Flipkart\u2019s Chief Executive Kalyan Krishnamurthy in a statement. \u201cThere is no doubt that e-commerce has not only lifted consumer sentiment but has also driven the industry to set new benchmarks. Affordability and value driven themes clearly are the pulsating chords for India and Bharat.\u201d\n\nWatch: How to know which retailers will take the biggest hit from a trade war\n\nFlipkart expects 60% of India\u2019s population, or 840 million people, to be using the internet by 2022. Data provided by Amplify ETFs says 654 million shoppers are estimated to shop online in India this year.\n\nDeborah Weinswig, founder of Coresight Research, a global research firm specializing in retail and technology, the shopping event is one way in which Flipkart, and Walmart, aim to snap up more of that online shopping market share.\n\n\u201cFlipkart has been working to extend its reach more, for example by partnering with kiranas (small mom-and-pop stores that dominate Indian retail) to extend delivery capabilities to newer postal codes,\u201d Weinswig said. Flipkart says it has expanded operations in hundreds of new towns and cities ahead of this year\u2019s event.\n\n\u201cWalmart and Amazon are fighting to become the dominant player in India\u2019s online marketplace, working hard to outdo one another via shopping festivals such as \u2018Big Billion Days,\u2019 but these events are only skirmishes in a larger battle for both market share and mindshare among Indian consumers,\u201d she said.\n\nAmazon has its own shopping event happening in India from Sept. 29 through Oct. 4 called Great Indian Festival. The company said Amazon\u2019s India site had the single largest day for new Prime memberships on the first day.\n\nThat larger battle might not be determined for many years, says, Jonathan Treiber, CEO of RevTrax, a platform that manages special offers and discounts.\n\n\u201cThe question everyone is asking is timing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to time socioeconomic patterns and when the rise of the middle class is going to swell sufficiently to support the prior valuation.\u201d\n\nTo move things along, Treiber says Walmart could sink even more money into growing business in India, but he thinks the company is too \u201crisk averse\u201d to do so.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Why Walmart, Disney and so many other companies are paying for their employees\u2019 college education\n\n\u201cThey would be uncomfortable with the amount of money they would have to lose to gain in India, unlike Amazon, which lost a lot to gain in the U.S.,\u201d he said. \u201cWalmart\u2019s more temperate approach means Flipkart takes most of the risk.\u201d\n\nChristian Magoon, CEO of Amplify ETFs, also notes the high price Walmart paid to build its stake in Flipkart, but sees the benefit in more than just the retail arm of the business.\n\n\u201cA silver lining to that cash burn however is the PhonePe unit at Flipkart which is one of India\u2019s leading digital payment companies,\u201d he said. \u201cPhonePe is going to spin out of Flipkart shortly and estimates are that it may be worth $10 billion to $15 billion as a standalone business. This company also lends strategic value to Flipkart\u2019s pursuit of the Indian e-commerce crown since mobile payments are a fast growing category in emerging markets like India.\u201d\n\nWalmart stock has rallied 27.6% for the year to date. The Amplify Online Retail ETF IBUY, +0.71% is up 16.7%. Amazon stock has gained 15.4%. And the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.36% is up 15.6% for 2019 so far.", "description": "Flipkart\u2019s annual \u201cBig Billions Days\u201d event is expected to be the biggest ever, a positive for Walmart, which invested $16 billion in the company last year.", "authors": ["Tonya Garcia"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS329_flipka_MG_20190930150619.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
