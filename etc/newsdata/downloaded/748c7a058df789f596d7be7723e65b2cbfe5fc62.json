Tesla said earlier this month global deliveries for the quarter rose to a record 97,000 vehicles, though most of that growth came from sales of the Model 3 -- its lowest profit margin vehicle.\n\nWhile it was known that the automaker was emphasizing global expansion last quarter, the document adds clarity to the extent of the regional shift. The U.S., China, the Netherlands and Norway have long been the biggest markets for the company\u2019s all-electric cars. While sales in China -- the world\u2019s largest auto market -- rose to $699 million from $409 million, a category known as \u201cother\u201d -- which includes several countries -- grew to $1.8 billion from $784 million.\n\nTesla shares fell 3.5% to $316.22 on Tuesday. They dropped another in after-market trading, down 0.5% as of 5:12 p.m. in New York.\n\nTesla also said in the filing that it reduced costs due to manufacturing efficiencies and unspecified \u201ccommercial negotiations with suppliers.\u201d Panasonic Corp., which makes battery cells for Tesla and is the company\u2019s largest supplier, didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nAt least one analyst was unimpressed. Craig Irwin, an analyst at Roth Capital Partners, downgraded Tesla to sell from neutral over concerns that Tesla\u2019s gross margins are unsustainable. Roth has a $249 price target on the stock.\n\n\u201cThe filing from Tesla shows warranty adjustments and other one-time items are a large driver of perceived strength,\u201d wrote Roth in a note Tuesday. The company got a one-time $55 million benefit in part by reversing certain warranty provisions, he said.\n\n(Updates with closing shares in fourth paragraph)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Dana Hull in San Francisco at dhull12@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Craig Trudell at ctrudell1@bloomberg.net, Chester Dawson, Kevin Miller\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc.\u2019s surprise profit in the third quarter came despite a drop of almost 40% in revenue from the U.S. -- its largest market.The electric automaker\u2019s U.S. sales plummeted to $3.13 billion in the latest quarter, from $5.13 billion a year earlier, according to a securities filing on", "authors": ["Dana Hull"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/tXO7iBudYsUOk2YddV_CDw--~B/aD03NTA7dz0xMjk2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/12a4d523102586ae72e34d7dc56a3559", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
