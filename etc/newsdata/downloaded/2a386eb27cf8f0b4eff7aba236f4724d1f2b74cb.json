Jerrold Nadler, New York Democrat and chairman of the committee.\n\nDemocrats are also pressing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to take up House-passed legislation that would expand background checks to cover virtually all gun sales and to extend the time that federally-licensed dealers must wait to hear back from the FBI before proceeding with a sale.\n\nBut Mr. McConnell on Tuesday reiterated his recent comments that he\u2019s still waiting for specific cues from Mr. Trump on what he would be willing to sign into law, as the White House has already issued veto threats for those House-passed bills.\n\nThe Kentucky Republican said the White House\u2019s Eric Ueland briefed senators on the topic at their weekly lunch Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThey are working on coming up with a proposal that the president will sign,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cUntil that happens, all of this is theatrics.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump had expressed an interest in doing something on background checks in the wake of the shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, last month that claimed the lives of more than 30 people, but has generally been more focused on the mental health side of the debate.\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi and other advocates made their case at a Tuesday hearing held by the House\u2019s gun violence prevention task force.\n\n\u201cThousands of people, thousands of children have died since Sen. McConnell first refused to take up our bills,\u201d said Mrs. Pelosi, California Democrat. \u201cWe will fight on every front \u2014 in the courts, in the Congress, and in the court of public opinion to make sure this issue is too hot to handle for the GOP to block.\u201d\n\nBut Republicans say they\u2019re wary that any new gun controls could pave the way toward an erosion of Americans\u2019 basic Second Amendment rights.\n\n\u201cWhat I am not willing to do is support legislation that will do nothing to make us safer and simultaneously infringes on the rights and liberties guaranteed by our Constitution,\u201d said Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee.\n\nThe gunman in the Odessa, Texas, shooting last month that claimed the lives of seven people was reportedly able to purchase an AR-15-style rifle through a private sale, evading a federal background check that had disclosed a mental health issue that blocked him from getting a gun in 2014, according to The Associated Press.\n\nOther Democrats, meanwhile, are pushing to go further.\n\nFormer Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke was among the first of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates to call for a mandatory government buyback of certain kinds of semiautomatic, military-style firearms.\n\nThe gun debate was also raging outside of Washington.\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy on Tuesday signed an executive order directing state agencies to look into whether gun manufacturers that do business with the state adhere to certain requirements like preventing sales to prohibited individuals, and whether financial institutions doing business with the state follow certain gun-related safety requirements.\n\n\u201cWe want those who do business with New Jersey to share our values and be committed to ending the scourge of gun violence in our communities,\u201d Mr. Murphy said.\n\nThe National Rifle Association is currently in an ongoing legal battle with the state of New York after the gun-rights group accused state officials of discouraging banks and insurance companies from doing business with them.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
