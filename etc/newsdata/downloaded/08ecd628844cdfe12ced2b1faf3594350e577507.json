That's the Tories.\"\n\nSpeaking on Radio 4's Today programme, Cameron sought to dampen the row.\n\nHe said: \"I had conversations with private secretaries and the like, but I never asked for anything improper to be done.\"\n\n\"I don't want to say anything more about this and some people would say I've already said too much.\"", "description": "The Queen has been dragged further into UK politics after David Cameron revealed he asked her to intervene in the Scottish independence referendum.", "authors": ["Thomas Colson"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8340e92e22af057c4b56f3-960-480.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
