I crossed out black and wrote merle. Mom stopped so I took over cleaning and her color came off on my cloth. I was just amazed! I crossed of merle and wrote \u201cpolka dot?\u201d because she was patchy like a paint horse.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when I began to notice the green. I used my phone flashlight and couldn\u2019t believe it so I wrote green. A little while later when there was more sunlight on her she just flowed green.\u201d\n\nWhen interviewed by local media, Williams said that Verdant was one of nine puppies born to her Great Dane Ami. As for the standout new arrival, she said, \u201cI just love her. She\u2019s like a little shamrock puppy.\u201d\n\nVerdant\u2019s color is temporary, with Rover.com reporting that a chemical called biliverdin, which makes bile, is largely responsible. A high level of the biliverdin would have been present in the puppy\u2019s birth sac.
