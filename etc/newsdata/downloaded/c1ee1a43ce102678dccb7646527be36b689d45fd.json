The documents cited Holmes 'current financial situation' without elaborating.\n\nLawyers who have been defending Elizabeth Holmes (pictured in 2015), the founder of Theranos, from fraud charges in a civil lawsuit say she hasn't paid them for a year\n\n(Left to right) Lawyers John Dwyer, Stephen Neal and Jeffrey Lombard said in court documents that they don't expect Holmes will ever pay her bills and are asking to be able to quit her case\n\n'Given Ms. Holmes\u2019s current financial situation, Cooley has no expectation that Ms. Holmes will ever pay it for its services as her counsel,' her lawyers, Dwyer, Stephen Neal and Jeffrey Lombard wrote in the motion, according to the New York Post.\n\n'Thus, it is unfair and unreasonable to require Cooley to continue representing Ms. Holmes.'\n\nDwyer didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Friday. A message left for Holmes' attorney in a separate criminal case in San Jose, California, wasn't immediately returned.\n\nIt's unclear how much money Holmes currently owes her lawyers.\n\nHolmes, a former Stanford University student, started Theranos in Palo Alto on the promise it had developed a way to perform complex blood analysis with a finger prick. Federal authorities asserted that Theranos' technology didn't work as advertised, duping both the company's investors and customers.\n\nThe lawyers said that Holmes' (in 2015) 'current financial situation' gave them little hope that they'd ever be paid for their services. It's unclear how much she owes them\n\nHolmes (in 2019) pleaded not guilty to criminal charges of conspiracy and fraud in a case due to go to trial in August 2020.

If convicted, the pair could each face a maximum of 20 years in prison, as well as a $250,000 fine for each wire fraud and conspiracy count.\n\nA trial date hasn't been set for the civil lawsuit filed against Holmes, Theranos and Walgreens, which offered Theranos' blood-testing technology in Arizona and California. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of consumers who paid for Theranos' blood testing service.\n\nIn June, it was reported that Holmes was believed to have married Billy Evans, 27, in a private ceremony. Evans' grandparents, William and Anne Evans, started the Evans Hotel Group in 1953. It now owns three major West Coast resort properties: The Catamaran, the Baha and The Lodge at Torrey Pines.", "description": "Elizabeth Holmes, 35, who ran Theranos until its 2018 collapse, hasn't paid her Palo Alto, California, attorney John Dwyer and colleagues for the past year, according to court documents.", "authors": ["Associated Press", "Maxine Shen For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/01/19320214-0-image-a-2_1570235025187.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
