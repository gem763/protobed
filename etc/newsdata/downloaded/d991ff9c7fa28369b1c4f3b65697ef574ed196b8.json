Which is why he departed the Camp Nou \u201cdestroyed\u201d despite his team having not been destroyed at all, and that might just have hurt even more. Some days your Luuk\u2019s just not in, and Sunday was one of those days: the worrying thing is that it wasn\u2019t the only one of them.\n\nThirty-five minutes into the weekend\u2019s biggest match, the one that had seemed set to decide just how good Sevilla were, how good manager Julen Lopetegui and his new project is too, striker Luuk de Jong alone had enjoyed more chances than the entire Barcelona team. He was also losing 3-0. By the end, it was 4-0. \u201cWe\u2019re pissed off but football\u2019s like that,\u201d Nolito said.\n\n\n\nSunday\u2019s match had gone Sevilla, Sevilla, Sevilla, Sevilla, oh look Barcelona are 3-0 up, the rough notes genuinely reading: \u201c10. De Jong, good save Ter Stegen / 17. Great chance De Jong / 25. What a miss! De Jong.\u201d And then: \u201c27. Great goal Su\u00e1rez.\u201d Quickly followed by a second from Arturo Vidal and a lovely finish from Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 that ended it. Sevilla had taken the game to Barcelona and Barcelona had taken it from Sevilla: seven minutes, 54 seconds \u2013 celebrations, VAR checks and sundry faffing all included \u2013 and it was as over, three shots enough. A story in short scribbles continued \u201c58. 6-13 shots Sevilla / Chances: 3-4 / 59. Messi madness / Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 playing well / De Jong off,\u201d before ending on: \u201c4-0 Messi, he\u2019s back.\u201d\n\nSid Lowe (@sidlowe) Last night\u2019s rough notes. De Jong, De Jong, De Jong, oh wait, Bar\u00e7a are 3-0 up. De Jong again. Oh. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/EReghqRntk\n\nThere\u2019s a nice photo from after the match in which \u00c9ver Banega and Lionel Messi sit together on the stairs in the tunnel at the Camp Nou near where the chapel is, just the two of them, shirts off and handed over to each other, chatting. It\u2019s easy to imagine them dissecting the game, trying to work out what happened, although, let\u2019s face it, they probably had better things to talk about. If they were, they weren\u2019t the\n\nonly ones.\n\n\u201cThe result doesn\u2019t reflect the way the game was,\u201d said Sergio Reguil\u00f3n. \u201cThe punishment was too great: we had chances then Luis Su\u00e1rez scores an incredible goal and it ends,\u201d said Tomas Vaclik. \u201cI don\u2019t like using the word unfair, but we didn\u2019t deserve that,\u201d said Lopetegui. \u201cAlthough it was 4-0, I don\u2019t think we played badly,\u201d Nolito said. \u201cYou have so many chances and don\u2019t score, then they get three in 10 minutes. They put their first chance away and then we were going against the tide.\u201d\n\nSid Lowe (@sidlowe) Great pic https://t.co/HoTsobvelc\n\nIt just wasn\u2019t their night. Barcelona manager Ernesto Valverde agreed. \u201cIn the first half, the score is pretty big for the way the game was,\u201d he said. \u201cThey had quite a lot of chances and they let us off. We were clinical, more than them.\u201d Sevilla\u2019s sporting director Monchi said he was heading home \u201cangry, sad\u201d, but insisted: \u201cI\u2019ve been here 20 or 25 times as a player and rarely had the feeling that we did as much as we did in the opening 25 minutes tonight.\u201d\n\nThey were right, and maybe it was hard to explain. But it was also easy, maybe too easy, to explain. \u201cBarcelona have gunpowder,\u201d Sport said. And Sevilla don\u2019t. There was an inescapable truth to this result, a logic, familiarity. It was that kind of weekend, a stop me if you\u2019ve heard this one before. Messi scored a free-kick, his 43rd for Barcelona, his 15th in the last two years alone. He scored against Sevilla, making it 37 in 38 games against them. Su\u00e1rez smashed in an overhead kick, yet another volley to add to a collection that may have no equal anywhere, ever: that\u2019s his 21st since heading to Spain. Barcelona racked up the goals at the Camp Nou: five against Valencia, five against Betis, four against Sevilla. And, eight games in, the top three are those three, if not in the normal order.\n\nPremier Sports \ud83d\udcfa (@PremierSportsTV) \ud83d\udc10 #Messi career record vs Sevilla:\n\n\n\n\ud83c\udfdf 38 games\n\n\u26bd\ufe0f 37 goals\n\n\ud83c\udfaf 5 Free-Kicks\n\n\n\nOutrageous \ud83d\udd25\n\nSource: @squawkafootball\n\npic.twitter.com/xfy4y92AM3\n\nThere are doubts still, concerns about their continued inability to control games, but there is also comfort in that familiarity; in Messi completing 90 minutes and getting his first goal of the season; in Su\u00e1rez scoring out of nowhere again; in the way they ended the game, if not the way they started it. Comfort too in the success of the changes, the decisions that would have bitten Valverde if they hadn\u2019t worked: Frenkie De Jong in central midfield in place of Sergio Busquets; Vidal, always more than a mohican and tattoos that so few people can see beyond; Nelson Semedo at left back, and Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, making his first start since the opening day, instead of Antoine Griezmann. All of the front three scored. More importantly, they combined. A more natural fit for the left wing, scorer of a lovely goal, the cut-back and finish, two-footed, very much his move, Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 is erratic but he\u2019s electric too.\n\n\n\nHe is also out again, and that too is familiar for a player for whom continuity and consistency remain elusive: come back in, immediately go back out again. Usually it\u2019s due to injury, this time he added insult, getting sent off in the last minute thanks to a second yellow for protesting against a red card handed to debutant Ronald Araujo by the referee Mateu Lahoz. Asked afterwards what Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 had said, Valverde replied: \u201cIt\u2019s a mystery. You\u2019re doing well to get any phrase out of him in Spanish. It won\u2019t have been anything very long, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs it turned out, what he said was \u201cmuy malo\u2019\u2019, very bad, which the consequences might well be: it\u2019s the cl\u00e1sico in two weeks.\n\nFor Sevilla, there are doubts too, fears about the familiarity of all this. If the way it happened was different, the way it ended wasn\u2019t. As Estadio Deportivo put it, they had \u201cplayed like never before, and lost like normal\u201d. They have been beaten nine times in a row at the Camp Nou and haven\u2019t won there for 18 years. \u201cNo goals, but honour,\u201d the headline ran.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Luuk De Jong, Daniel Carrico and Diego Carlos left to rue their missed opportunities. Photograph: Bagu Blanco/BPI/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nThe problem is, that no goals may not just be down to bad luck \u2013 although there was plenty of it. This is a new Sevilla, the first of the second coming of Monchi, a team containing 13 new players after 15 departed, and it is early to judge them. There is much that is good, they were superb against Real Sociedad last week, and Monchi was entitled to insist that he could see a team that \u201cknows what it wants\u201d at the Camp Nou. Joan Jordan has impressed, Banega has found his place, freed up by Fernando, and although they let in four, Diego Carlos has had a good start. Lucas Ocampos tore into Barcelona, as he has done to others. And the full-backs, Jes\u00fas Navas and Reguil\u00f3n, are flying. But up front it\u2019s not happening. \u201cDe Jong had four chances and didn\u2019t score, Su\u00e1rez had none and did,\u201d Marca said, saying it all. Swap the strikers round and you might have swapped the scoreline around.\n\n\n\nThis is a recurring issue, so much so that it hints at a systemic one, or the kind of serendipity that can sink you. Lopetegui has been to the Camp Nou twice as a manager now, a year apart \u2013 first with Madrid and then with Sevilla. The stats show that his teams have fired off 31 shots, and faced 28. They have lost 5-1 and 4-0. None of Sevilla\u2019s centre forwards have scored in the league this season: Munir Haddadi, Javier Hern\u00e1ndez and De Jong have no league goals; Munas Dabbur, signed for \u20ac15m, has no league minutes.\n\nThey got 60 league goals between them last season, and De Jong scored over 100 at PSV, but it\u2019s different now. No one has taken more shots without scoring than De Jong, likened in El Mundo to the tortured protagonist of a Dostoyevsky novel. Even at 3-0, there was no consolation, no light. Clean through, having robbed the ball and made the opportunity himself, he took aim for the 18th time of the season, the fourth of the night.\n\nThe ball bounced back off the post and away.\n\nSign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n\nTalking points\n\n\u2022 Villarreal led Osasuna 1-0 but didn\u2019t win, losing 2-1 with the winner scored by the brilliant Chimy Avila, with his short shorts, big heart, black boots, endless tattoos and oversized lungs. Villarreal, who have more players in the Spanish squad than Barcelona, Madrid and Atl\u00e9tico combined, have now led in seven of their eight games and won only three. Meanwhile, Osasuna won again at El Sadar, the stadium where they haven\u2019t lost in 29 matches.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Osasuna\u2019s players celebrate. Photograph: Jes\u00fas Diges/EPA\n\n\u2022 Real Madrid led 3-2, but like the day against Levante, almost got caught,\n\nhanging on to beat Granada 4-2. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep doing this,\u201d Dani Carvajal said, drawing the parallel to Levante without prompting.\n\n\u2022 Atl\u00e9tico didn\u2019t concede for the fourth game running. But they didn\u2019t score either. Eight games in, it\u2019s their worst goalscoring start in the Diego Simeone era, hardly known for its all-out attacking anyway.\n\nPremier Sports \ud83d\udcfa (@PremierSportsTV) \u274c Sandro Ramirez's never-ending wait to end his goal drought continues as he blazes over the bar from the spot!\n\n\n\n\ud83d\ude48 Valladolid had a golden chance to take the lead over Atletico after VAR awarded a penalty for a foul on Thomas Partey pic.twitter.com/Kf6Ycl6Q8n\n\n\u2022 And VAR took ages. To still get it wrong. In the worst, but not the only case, at Butarque, where Legan\u00e9s have demanded their defeat by Levante get replayed after a penalty was given for a foul that, if it happened at all, happened outside the area. They claim the system failed; the Federation claims it didn\u2019t. And so the war rumbles on, this time with referees and their videos in the middle, weaponised again.\n\n\u2022 Iago Aspas is back. He scored his first of the season to beat Athletic and rescued Fran Escrib\u00e1\u2019s job. But it\u2019s hard to see Espanyol manager David Gallego making it to the next match day.\n\n\u2022 There were more protests at Mestalla, despite attempts to hide them. President Anil Murthy responded to chants for Peter Lim to leave and for him to \u201cget out\u201d \u2013 chants that called him \u201cscum\u201d \u2013 by signalling for them to fall silent and pointing at the pitch, telling them to support the team.
