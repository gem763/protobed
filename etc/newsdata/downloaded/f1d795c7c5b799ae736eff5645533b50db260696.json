It was a reminder that whenever the ANC and its partners, the Congress of South African Trade Unions and South African Communist Party, enter a room to deliberate on the country's economy, one should prepare for a disappointing outcome.\n\nThe whole world, a world that includes the ANC and its affiliates, knows how lacklustre South Africa's economy has been over the past ten years.\n\nLast week, Bloomberg reported that South Africa's economy entered the 70th month of a weakening cycle in September. Their report was based on the South African Reserve Bank's (SARB) Quarterly Bulletin released in Pretoria.\n\nFor us who follow South Africa's economy and occasionally write about it, there was nothing stunning about Bloomberg's report. South Africa\u2019s economy is under serious strain \u2013 a strain that ought to unnerve everyone in the country.\n\nEconomic growth remains very weak \u2013 projected to be less than 1% this year by the SARB. The state-owned enterprises (SOEs) are a complete financial mess and throttle our economy. Business confidence, a very critical measure of the health of the economy is in the doldrums. Even foreign investors have been ditching South Africa\u2019s assets at staggering rates this year.\n\nAttending Stellenbosch University's Bureau for Economic Research's (BER) morning briefing on the state of South Africa's economy and politics in Johannesburg this past August, I came out of the briefing disillusioned about the country's economic future. Hugo Pienaar, BER's chief economist also projected less than 1% economic growth this year \u2013 along with a contraction in private and public sector investments. This, I thought, was very bad news for South Africa.\n\nCyril Ramaphosa and his governing party are still embroiled in factional battles. The factions don't seem to be thinking the same way on how the party should move South Africa forward on reforms. At the morning briefing, Hugo said these battles were holding the potential for reform. He was right.\n\nOne option\n\nWhen Ramaphosa came to power in December 2017, some of us thought he'd be in full control of the party by now. I was among those pundits \u2013 and I was dead wrong. We are seeing no end to these factional battles \u2013 and Ramaphosa looks weak \u2013 which is worrisome.\n\nIn the midst of the unabating divisions in the party, one courageous man, heading the finance ministry, Tito Mboweni, seems to have a full understanding of the steps we should take to escape the economic mess we have gotten ourselves to.\n\nMboweni's ideas on how to revamp this economy, presented in his recent paper, titled \"Economic Transformation, Inclusive Growth and Competitiveness: Towards an Economic Strategy for South Africa\", are what will get this country back on track.\n\nOne of the most important things about the paper, is that it explicitly acknowledges the mess the country is in. It proposes fundamental pro-growth policy reforms we need to undertake to reignite economic growth and create the needed employment opportunities.\n\nWe have seen the damage our state-owned electricity generator Eskom, and other state-owned enterprises have done to our economy. The amount of debt in these SOEs is at levels that have posed serious risk to the economy. Any rational public official determined to make a difference should know that these companies need to be privatised.\n\nGovernment's limits\n\nGovernment's role is not to run businesses \u2013 it's to create an environment conducive to a thriving private sector. Out of that thriving private sector will be the creation of sustainable jobs. It is unfortunate that Mboweni seems to be the only high-profile minister aware of the limits of government's role in the economy in Ramaphosa's lousy government.\n\nHe deserves praises for standing for his ideas at the ANC\u2019s recent NEC meeting. According to News24, he was blunt on his ideas and the state of the country's economy. His courage is what most of our ministers must possess.\n\nThe NEC should have backed Mboweni's recovery plan \u2013 instead of coming up with the so-called \"package of economic interventions\". A radical pro-market shift is needed \u2013 not these destructive economic interventions that get us nowhere.\n\nAt BER's morning briefing, I learned from one of the very accomplished speakers that the role of government in the economy has been rising since the 2008 financial crisis \u2013 that it is \u2013 at this point \u2013 bigger than most of the emerging markets.\n\nWhat intrigued me is that in parallel with this upward slope of the role of government, unemployment rose and continues to rise under Ramaphosa. Mboweni's recovery plan has potential to reverse this.\n\nBut he is, sadly, alone \u2013 with very few people in the ANC supporting his approach. His president is not bold and publicly supportive of the plan. We need more voices in support of his sane ideas.\n\nPhumlani M.
