Generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, allow companies, at times, to present numbers that, while accurate, may not provide the clearest picture to investors. The trick is to learn how to recognize issues early, before they become problems for companies\u2014and stock prices\u2014down the road.\n\nA debate over corporate accounting practices has emerged with the allegations brought by forensic accountant Harry Markopolos, who says that General Electric (ticker: GE) has been misrepresenting the health of its long-term care insurance business. GE has rejected his claims as \u201cmeritless.\u201d Others have said his analysis was simplistic.\n\nAccounting expert Robert Willens has some advice for investors who want to look deep into financial statements. \u201cInvestors should pay attention to the rate at which receivables are growing vis a vis the rate at which sales are growing,\u201d he tells Barron\u2019s. \u201cAn imbalance here can signal suspect sales.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course, an investor should monitor the inventory account. Growing inventories may signal that the company is misjudging the market for its products and that an inventory write-down is imminent.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s excellent advice, but a little specific. It contains, however, exactly what investors need to know to identify potential problems. The keys are (1) be aware of trends and (2) beware of outliers.\n\nTrends\n\nLet\u2019s look at Willens\u2019s inventory example. If inventory as a percentage of sales jumps without explanation, then the trend isn\u2019t the investor\u2019s friend. It warrants further investigation, perhaps an email to investors-relations personnel.\n\nAny financial metric can form the basis of a trend. Sales and earnings growth are critical things to watch, but inventories, cash flows, and asset returns can be even more meaningful when judging the long-term health of a company.\n\nOutliers\n\nIf one company spends much less, or much more, than any of its peers, say, on selling, general and administrative costs, the fact the company is an outlier can be a sign of an unsustainable practice.\n\nIn 2018, Kraft Heinz (KHC) spent about 11% of sales on SG&A, while other packaged-food companies in the S&P 500 spent closer to 25%. Kraft may have cut expenses too far. The company wrote off $7.3 billion in assets in February, sending shares lower.\n\nAccounting is hard, especially given companies\u2019 ability to manage their reported results. There\u2019s a connection here to why stocks sometimes sell off in an extreme manner after management reports lower earnings, or sales, than Wall Street expects.\n\nIf a company can\u2019t meet its own guidance or Wall Street\u2019s estimates, the thinking goes, something really must be wrong.\n\nWrite to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.com", "description": "Looking at accounting minutiae is hard.
