The Indigenous Gunditjmara people have spent years restoring the site after it was damaged by farming and development [Tracey Shelton/Al Jazeera]\n\nArchaeologists say an eruption around 30,000 years ago sent lava flowing from the mountain through to the sea bed 50 kilometres (31 miles) away. Black volcanic rock is still visible along the coastline.\n\nRose said fires were lit above the bedrock to weaken the hardened lava so it could then be broken into the building blocks that were used to create the fish traps.\n\nThese blocks were also used to build permanent dwellings, and the foundations of more than 140 have been discovered so far - providing further evidence of the advanced trade and social systems of this centuries-old Indigenous society.\n\nOther fish traps and housing remnants have been destroyed by years of cattle-grazing and introduced species like wild boar, which often rummage around in the stone blocks.\n\nWhile many Indigenous Australians lived semi-nomadic lives, eel and fish farming - as well as kangaroos, wallabies, bird-life and a constant water supply - provided enough resources to sustain the Gunditjmara year-round.\n\nStanding in the centre of a clear semi-circle stone base, Rose explained that all the structures that have been found face northeast to block the winds. Fireplaces were built outside, in front of the doorway, in the colder months.\n\n\"Smoking trees\" also dot the area, used for smoking eel which could then be used for trade.\n\nA fire would be lit at the base of a hollow tree, while the eel was hung above it and a sheet of bark used to cover the opening.\n\nThese techniques were passed down through the traditional storytelling of the Gunditjmara people.\n\nBut that history was almost lost when white settlers began to arrive at the beginning of the 19thcentury.\n\nVolcanic rock along the coast near Port Fairy about 50 kilometres south of Budj Bim.
