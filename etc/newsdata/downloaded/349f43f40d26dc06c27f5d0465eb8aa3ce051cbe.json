I find that the guys are kind of overlooking you a little bit.\u2026 With the girls I feel like you're more accepted as you play.\"\n\nTeammate Maddi Healy agrees.

(Baseball St. John's/Twitter)\n\n\"Most of these girls play \u2026 at the provincial level,\" said Mark Healy, the Capitals coach and head of Baseball NL.\n\nHaving the girls face off against the best of the boys allows them to crank up the calibre of their performance, readying them to play at the national level, he explained.\n\nAnd although the girls can hold their own on the field, it's not always easy convincing everyone of that, he said.\n\nProved they belong\n\n\"You know, [other teams] don't really say anything derogatory or make any bad comments, but you can feel that, 'jeez, a bunch of girls playing in a boys' league? Why is that?'\"\n\nWith 600 female under-18 players registered in the province, coach Healy hopes that type of response will soon change.\n\n\"The girls have really proven they belong on the field with the boys,\" he said. \"They've proven to the naysayers they belong out there.\"\n\nRead more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador", "description": "Thankfully, the new gold medallists throw like girls.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5291351.1568994718!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/bantam-capitals.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
