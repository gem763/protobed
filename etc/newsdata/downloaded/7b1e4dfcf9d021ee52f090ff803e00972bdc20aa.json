Olivia Krok who project managed the initiative spoke to DRUM about the big transformation and how it came about. She said her goal is to make this school an example for others to work towards and to show the importance of spatial design and safe, creative spaces for effective learning.\n\nOliva said this project was a collaboration between herself, NPO Uthando and other organisations.\n\n\u201cWe hope to motivate our parents and our communities to bring and keep their children to school, especially from a young age. If we can educate our children at this age it will combat a lot of poverty and economic issues in our country. More education, less crime,\u201d she told DRUM.\n\nOlivia expressed that she lerant of the school three years back and she and her friends would visit to host Christmas parties and other fun activities for the kids. It felt that it wasn\u2019t enough and she always wanted to do more. She approached the principal and told her about the vision she had and about wanting to give back to humanity.\n\n\u201cThis is a collaborative project, Liv Curious (my company that does project and event management in social impact), together with the NPO Uthando raised funding. We hope to continue raising funds so other schools can have the opportunity to be in a safer environment, which will lead to positive learning,\u201d Oliva said.\n\nWith a 100-140 kids registered at the Masibulele Daycare Centre, Oliva\u2019s goal is to build many more schools to help educate more kids and create a better learning space for them\n\n\u201cWe are looking at more schools to help, and we\u2019d also would like for people to help us with raising funds. We want to build relationships and show parents how important education is, especially for children between the ages of 0-6 years because that\u2019s the foundation. People tend to only focus on Grade 7s but having a solid foundation for the children is more important,\u201d she added.", "description": "A Khayelitsha woman rebuilt a rainy, cold shack into a brand-new colourful double-storey daycare centre.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9493/56bb7652de5e406dafb2f52c4cd5bb5d.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
