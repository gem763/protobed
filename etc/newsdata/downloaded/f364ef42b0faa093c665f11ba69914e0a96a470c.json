And it was out there on the edges of the strike zone that the Astros won Game 4 of the World Series, whipping the Nationals, 8-1, to even the series at two games apiece.\n\n\u201cOur approach was right,\u201d Astros shortstop Carlos Correa said. \u201cThere\u2019s some pitchers out there who are legit, and he\u2019s one of them. His slider is one of best pitches we\u2019ve seen. You have to have the right approach against him. And I feel like as a team we had the right approach against Corbin.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis series is tied, and pointed toward a Max Scherzer/Gerrit Cole rematch on Sunday night and a climax in Houston next week, because the home team has yet to win a game. It\u2019s tied because, in Saturday night\u2019s Game 4, the same Nationals lineup that had strafed Cy Young candidates Cole and Justin Verlander in a pair of wins in Houston was shut down by a 24-year-old rookie pitcher, Jose Urquidy, making his eighth major league start.\n\nIt\u2019s tied because, in an Astros lineup stacked with five current or former all-stars with a total of 16 all-star appearances between them, a 35-year-old catcher with a career .234 batting average, Robinson Chirinos, took the game\u2019s biggest swing \u2014 a two-run homer off Corbin in the fourth inning to push the Astros\u2019 lead to 4-0 and start the Nationals down the path of using their lesser relievers, with predictably disastrous results.\n\nAnd it\u2019s tied because the real 2019 Astros \u2014 the ones who won 107 games over the regular season and careened into the playoffs as the overwhelming favorites \u2014 finally showed up. In surviving the Tampa Bay Rays in the Division Series and the New York Yankees in the ALCS, then dropping a pair at home to the Nationals \u2014 and amassing a run-differential of minus-eight along the way \u2014 the Astros had only hinted at their might.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is the team we\u2019ve been all year, and were finally back,\u201d Correa said. \u201cYou can keep us down for a couple of games, but not a whole series.\u201d\n\nBut mostly, it\u2019s tied because of what the Astros\u2019 collection of polished and professional hitters, masters of the quick study and the smart adjustment, did to Corbin, back when the game was still up for grabs. They made him throw it over the plate, and punished him when he did. They ambushed him for four straight singles during a two-run first inning, rarely allowing him to get into the types of two-strike counts where he could unleash his lethal slider.\n\n\u201cThey came out swinging,\u201d Corbin said. \u201cThey got on me quick, off my fastball.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nCorbin was so surprised at the Astros\u2019 tactics, he went to a different mix of pitches than usual, sprinkling in more curveballs and change-ups, pitches that he used in only 3.6 percent and 5.8 percent, respectively, of his overall pitches this season. In Game 4, he threw five curves and 10 change-ups \u2014 5.2 percent and 10.4 percent of his 96 pitches on the night.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI thought we did a great job of hitting his fastball to make him kind of go \u2026 away from his slider and make him throw change-ups and even the slow curveball,\u201d said veteran outfielder Josh Reddick. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen that many change-ups and curveballs thrown by Corbin all postseason. I think it made us feel like we got in his head a little bit, and made him switch up his game plan.\u201d\n\nBecause Corbin has spent the entirety of his big league career in the National League, the Astros had seen him only sparingly before this season. And when Corbin faced Correa during a one-inning relief appearance in the sixth inning of the Nationals\u2019 Game 1 win, he fooled him badly, getting him to chase a 3-2 back-foot slider out of the zone for strike three.\n\nAD\n\nCorbin, in fact, excels at this. Out of 76 pitchers who threw at least 2,500 pitches in 2019, Corbin\u2019s \u201cchase\u201d rate \u2014 the percentage of a pitcher\u2019s out-of-the-strike-zone pitches that hitters swing at \u2014 of 19.9 percent ranked second only to Minnesota\u2019s Kyle Gibson in the major leagues. This skill, coaxing ugly swings with pitches that look like strikes until they\u2019re not, earned him a $140 million contract from the Nationals last winter.\n\nAD\n\nBut as good as Corbin is at getting batters to chase, the Astros\u2019 hitters are nearly as good at laying off those pitches. They ranked sixth in MLB in 2019 in lowest chase rate \u2014 13.8 percent \u2014 which goes a long way toward explaining how a team that led the majors in slugging percentage (.495) could also make the most contact (80.7 percent of all swings) and strike out the fewest times (7.2 times per game). If it\u2019s a ball, the Astros, for the most part, don\u2019t swing.\n\nAlex Bregman, the Astros\u2019 brash third baseman, best personifies this ability; his chase rate of 8.5 percent this year was the second-best in the majors in 2019, behind Tommy Pham of the Rays. Bregman would single off Corbin during that first-inning ambush, ripping a first-pitch fastball to left-center, but would save his biggest damage for reliever Fernando Rodney, off whom he crushed a grand slam in the seventh.\n\nAD\n\nBut on Saturday night, Exhibit A was Correa.\n\nAD\n\nWhen Correa, in Saturday night\u2019s first inning, faced Corbin again for the first time since the strikeout in Game 1, he was ready. He worked a seven-pitch walk during the Astros\u2019 two-run inning, laying off a pair of tough sliders along the way. He drew another walk off Corbin leading off the pivotal fourth inning, spitting at another off-the-plate slider. The next batter was Chirinos, who took a first-pitch slider just off the plate, then unloaded on a 1-0 change-up down the middle of the plate.\n\n\u201cHe gets the most swings-and-misses and chases on the slider in the league,\u201d said Correa. \u201cWe worked really hard on laying off those sliders. It\u2019s his best pitch. When you don\u2019t see a pitcher throw a whole year, you don\u2019t have an idea what he\u2019s going to do. But then you face him and you know his patterns and what he likes to do. Every time [Corbin] was in trouble, he wants to go his slider. We did a good job laying off so we could get the fastball.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBefore the series began, when Nationals pitching coach Paul Menhart was asked if he thought his starters, especially Corbin, could get the disciplined Astros lineup to chase out of the zone, he answered, \u201cWithout a doubt, absolutely, if they\u2019re properly set up. They\u2019re human beings. We have guys who have the ability to make a pitch look like a strike for a very long time and then not be a strike.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe more the Astros see a pitcher, the more likely they are to crush him. This is true both over the course of a single game \u2014 they put up a .907 OPS (on-base plus slugging) against opposing starters the third time through the order, second in the majors and exactly 100 points above the league average \u2014 and a postseason series.\n\nAlready this postseason, they have pounced on Tampa Bay Rays flamethrower Tyler Glasnow and New York Yankees standout Masahiro Tanaka in each pitcher\u2019s second start against them in their respective series. The Yankees\u2019 grand plan of bullpenning their way to victory over the Astros exploded on them when Astros first baseman Yuli Gurriel, facing Yankees reliever Chad Green for the fourth time in the series, bashed a three-run homer off him in the decisive Game 6.\n\nAD\n\nFiguring out opposing pitchers: it\u2019s what the Astros do \u2014 and what they have done better than perhaps any other team in the game the past few years.\n\nAD\n\nAlong the way, the Astros, especially in their home park, have been accused of everything from stealing signs to detecting when a pitcher is tipping his pitches to illegally using cameras in the pursuit of one or both. The flip-side of the argument is that these dark arts have long traditions in the game, and if the Astros are better than everyone else at using high-tech video-study to see what \u201ctells\u201d a pitcher might have for each, good for them.\n\nAnd Max Scherzer, be forewarned: you\u2019re up next on their hit list.\n\nAD", "description": "Houston did its homework on the Nationals' left-hander, and it paid off emphatically as the Astros knotted the World Series at two games apiece.", "authors": ["Dave Sheinin", "National Baseball Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/MXSxHSE17ike6755k6FzZGAVXDo=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LUE6ABXYKEI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
