Bernard Sanders on Tuesday reminded his rivals that he remains a fundraising force in the 2020 Democratic presidential race, setting the bar by raking in more than $25 million over the third fundraising quarter of the campaign.\n\nPete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Indiana, pulled in $19 million over the last three months, while Sen. Kamala D. Harris of California raised $11.6 million and Sen. Cory A. Booker of New Jersey raised $6 million.\n\nThey all pale in comparison to President Trump, whose campaign and the Republican National Committee raised $125 million in the quarter, a presidential fundraising record.\n\nThe campaigns were the first to share their fundraising reports, which covered July 1 to Sept. 30.\n\nThe third-quarter filing deadline is Oct. 15 and the reports will provide a better sense of which of the remaining 19 contenders have staying power.\n\nThe Sanders camp said the Vermont lawmaker showed the tales of his demise have been greatly exaggerated.\n\n\u201cMedia elites and professional pundits have tried repeatedly to dismiss this campaign, and yet working-class Americans keep saying loudly and clearly that they want a political revolution,\u201d said Faiz Shakir, Mr. Sanders\u2019 campaign manager.\n\nSince entering the race, Mr. Sanders has raised more than $61 million from over 3.3 million people, according to his campaign. The average donation has been $19.\n\nMr. Buttigieg, meanwhile, has raised $51 million this year from 1.25 million donations. The average donation came in around $40, his campaign said.\n\n\u201cPeople continue to be drawn to Pete and his vision of bridging our divides and to his bold plans to move our country forward, and our campaign has grown exponentially faster than any other candidate in the 2020 field,\u201d said Mike Schmuhl, Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s campaign manager.\n\nOver the last three months, Mr. Buttigieg has expanded his campaign staff to 400 people, including 100 in Iowa, 64 in New Hampshire, 35 in Nevada and 33 in South Carolina.\n\nThe 37-year-old has had more staying power than some expected since entering the race as a two-term mayor of an Indiana city of just over 100,000 people.\n\nBut he fell short of repeating his impressive $24 million haul in the second quarter and remains stuck in a second-tier of contenders \u2014 trailing former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Mr. Sanders, who placed second in the 2016 primary race.\n\nMs. Harris said Tuesday she will enter the final months of the year with $10 million in the bank, and that her campaign is making big investments on the ground.\n\nMs. Harris\u2019 campaign announced last month it was adopting an Iowa-or-bust strategy.\n\nMr. Booker, meanwhile, posted his best quarter of the presidential race after warning supporters that he didn\u2019t see a path forward unless he could raise $1.7 million over the final 10 days of the quarter.\n\nBooker campaign manager Addisu Demissie said Mr. Booker surpassed that goal, pulling in more than $2 million, and said it shows that he is \u201con the rise.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat the last 10 days have done is put us firmly in the game,\u201d Mr. Demissie said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
