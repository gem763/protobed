But manufacturers said this would raise questions about risk and liability.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nInstead, manufacturers will have to ensure that key parts of the product can be replaced by independent professionals.\n\nIf British firms want to sell into Europe after Brexit they will have to follow the new rules, which apply from April 2021.\n\n'Massive step'\n\nIt is estimated that the new standards will ensure that appliances have a longer life. The rules also include provisions to make appliances more energy efficient.\n\nFor example, star ratings for the energy efficiency of appliances will be ratcheted up. Current regulations are seen to be outdated, with more than 55% of washing machines sold in the EU ranked A+++ on the label.\n\nThe move could directly save \u20ac20bn on energy bills per year in Europe from 2030 onwards - equivalent to 5% of EU electricity consumption.\n\nChloe Fayole of environmental group Ecos said: \u201cFrom the US to Europe, people are demanding their right to repair things they own because they\u2019re tired of products that are designed to break prematurely.\u201d\n\nLibby Peake from the UK Green alliance told BBC News: \u201cThese new standards are a massive step in the right direction and could result in nearly 50 million tonnes of CO2 emissions savings.\u201d\n\nBut Stephane Arditi of the European Environment Bureau said: \u201cWhen repair activities stay in the hands of a few firms, we\u2019re missing an opportunity to make it more affordable and readily available.\n\n\u201cSmall independent repairers can make a great contribution to the economy and our society. We need to help them do their job.\u201d\n\nFollow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin", "description": "The rules will make household appliances longer-lasting and easier to fix.", "authors": ["Roger Harrabin", "Bbc Environment Analyst"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1393E/production/_105109108_mediaitem105109107.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
