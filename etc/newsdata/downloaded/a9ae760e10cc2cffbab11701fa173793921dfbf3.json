You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nWhen M.Group, the folks behind fashionable Bali beach club Ulu Cliffhouse, open a boutique hotel next door, it was always going to be good. Just seven suites sit atop Uluwatu\u2019s high-drama cliffs, each named after one of the nearby surf breaks which the area is famed for, meaning even if you\u2019ve not the board skills to tackle Impossibles or Padang Padang, you can still say you\u2019ve been there, sort of. The vibe is laid-back hippy cool \u2013 think four poster beds, 1950\u2019s California-style furnishing and freestanding bathtubs. Guests get access to a private members\u2019 lounge as well as Ulu Cliffhouse, and its 25m infinity pool-club where the likes of Fatboy Slim, Carl Cox and Guy Gerber have performed.\n\nRooms from \u00a3200 per night based on a B&B basis, including airport transfers\n\ntheclubhouseatulu.com\n\nRio Palena Lodge, Chilean Patagonia\n\nLux-venture experts Eleven Experience touched down in South America for the first time with Rio Palena, a spectacular adventure lodge in Chilean Patagonia\u2019s Aysen. Hillside in a remote valley at the banks of the Rio Palena, it\u2019s a seven-room affair that\u2019s big on adrenaline rushes \u2013 anglers can head out on helicopter fishing trips (it\u2019s one of the best places in the world to catch wild trout), trot through the Andean countryside on horseback or hike through the mountains. Once you\u2019re done exploring, the river views can be enjoyed from bedrooms or the al fresco terrace \u2013 the spot to sip pisco sours before retreating to the lodge\u2019s wood-fired sauna and hot tubs.\n\nA four-night stay is from \u00a33,884pp including meals, a day\u2019s heli-fishing, a one-night hotel stay in Puerto Varas en route and some transfers\n\nelevenexperience.com\n\nSix Senses Gangtey, Bhutan\n\nSix Senses \u2013 known for its high-end wellness-focussed hotels \u2013 tend not to do things by halves. So rather than opening just one property in the Kingdom of Bhutan, it decided to open a circuit of five, scattered across several different, stunning locations. Six Senses Gangtey, which opens this month \u2013 and joins already open Thimphu, Paro and Punakha \u2013 is set in central Bhutan\u2019s Phobjikha Valley.\n\nGuests can book in to a clutch of suites or an elegant villa, with architecture and interiors that riff on Bhutanese design. In terms of activities, expect to meditate with local monks, enjoy hiking and mountain biking in the surrounding countryside, and birdwatch straight from the lodge\u2019s nature bridge (Phobjikha\u2019s the winter residence of the rare black-necked crane). Next year a fifth lodge, Bumthang, will open and complete the circuit.\n\nRates from around \u00a31,390 based on two sharing, on a half-board basis\n\nsixsenses.com\n\nLisbon\u2019s appeal shows no sign of slowing, and this newbie boutique hotel in the Portuguese capital has a great location between the fringe of the hip Alfama area, just outside of downtown proper. A 35-room hotel with a pretty pale blue facade, inside it\u2019s dedicated to all things local. Rooms are chic and unfussy \u2013 walls intricately tiled or hued in various shades of teal and peach, while furniture is all designed by Portuguese brands or artisans.\n\nIn the basement, arty residents and city breakers can catch an ever-changing roster of film screenings, yoga sessions and art exhibitions. Food inspiration comes from further afield, with seasonal dishes by Argentinian chef Nicola\u0301s Lo\u0301pez at the Art Deco-feel Gastro & Cocktail bar. Best of all is the al fresco terrace where DJs and other musical talent perform as the sun sets.\n\nRooms from \u00a3106\n\nesqinacosmopolitanlodge.com\n\nMaking waves on the flashpacker scene is Latin American brand Selina, which \u2013 hot on the heels of their Manchester debut \u2013 opens this month in Birmingham\u2019s Jewellery Quarter. Its 39 rooms include community rooms (shared dorms), as well as individual rooms and suites. The private rooms have a rather whimsical feel with gentle mint and coral tones and floral touches. Interior designer Lorna Keller has also woven in subtle Latin American twists, and worked with local talent on artwork. While the dorm rooms are simpler than the private options, they\u2019re a steal \u2013 with rates from \u00a315 a night. There\u2019s also a Cuban-inspired restaurant La Mariposa, a cute garden, cocktail bar and communal kitchen and lobby \u2013 ideal for co-working.\n\nCommunity rooms from \u00a315 a night\n\nselina.com\n\nAdding an extra touch of razzle dazzle to Miami\u2019s Ocean Drive is The Celino. A trio of art deco buildings, including the historic Park Central Hotel, have been transformed into a smart boutique property. Interiors channel tropical cool to the max, think palm-leaf covered wallpaper, hardwood floors, luxe Sferra bed linens and lashings of greenery.\n\nIn a rather quirky touch, conga line kits can be found in-room, as the famed dance was said to have been invented at the Park Hotel. Set to appeal to both visitors and hip Miami-ites are the glass-bottomed rooftop pool, which has killer beach views, and Dalia restaurant where guests can dine on Mediterranean seafood under paintings of oversized flamingos.\n\nRooms from \u00a3254 on a B&B basis\n\nslh.com", "description": "This month sees a hip Balinese beach club open a sister hotel, a \"poshtel\" in Birmingham and a luxe spa retreat in Bhutan open their\u00a0doors.
