As material from the rings fall into the stars, they grow bigger.\n\nSurrounding the two small disks, the researchers found a larger disk \u2014 one with a complex, pretzel-like structure of loops \u2014 with a total mass equivalent to 80 times that of our neighbourhood gas giant, Jupiter.\n\nThe researchers believe that the baby stars gather material from the bigger, pretzel-shaped disk in two stages.\n\nFirstly, twirling loops of flowing dust and gas are transferred to the smaller, individual discs, as seen the in image taken by ALMA. From here, the matter is passed on into the respective star.\n\nPrevious studies of the binary star system had only revealed its broad outer structure, rather than its inner composition. The findings help to shine light on how binary systems with similarly-sized stars form and grow from their surrounding disks of dust and gas\n\nSurrounding the two small disks, the researchers found a larger disk \u2014 one with a complex, pretzel-like structure of loops \u2014 with a total mass equivalent to 80 times that of our neighbourhood gas giant, Jupiter\n\nThe team also found that the brighter, but less-massive, of the two smaller disks \u2014 the one that is lower down in the ALMA image \u2014 is accreting material faster\n\n'We expect this two-level accretion process to drive the dynamics of the binary system during its mass accretion phase,' said Dr Alves.\n\n'While the good agreement of these observations with theory is already very promising, we will need to study more young binary systems in detail to better understand how multiple stars form.'\n\nThe pair of baby stars lie in the so-called '[BHB2007] 11 system', the newest addition to a small cluster in the Barnard 59 dark nebula in the larger cloud called the Pipe Nebula, pictured\n\nAstrochemist Felipe Alves of the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics and colleagues imaged the star system in high resolution using the so-called Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile\n\n'This is a really important result,' said paper co-author and Professor Paola Caselli, who heads up the Centre of Astrochemical Studies at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics.\n\n'We have finally imaged the complex structure of young binary stars with their feeding filaments connecting them to the disk in which they were born.'\n\n'This provides important constraints for current models of star formation.'\n\nThe full findings of the study were published in the journal Science.", "description": "Astrochemists at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics\u00a0imaged the stars in high resolution using the so-called\u00a0Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array in Chile.", "authors": ["Ian Randall For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/12/19295118-0-image-a-48_1570189257808.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
