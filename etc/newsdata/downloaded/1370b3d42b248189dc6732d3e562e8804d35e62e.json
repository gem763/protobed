Even though the two countries have backed opposite sides in the Syrian conflict, they have pooled efforts to negotiate a de-escalation zone in the Syrian province of Idlib and co-sponsor talks on forming a committee that would draft a new Syrian constitution.\n\nThe Russia-Turkey rapprochement came as Ankara\u2019s relations with Washington grew increasingly chilly and were further strained over Turkey\u2019s recent purchase of Russian air defense missiles.\n\nTurkey\u2019s offensive in Syria, which has drawn harsh criticism from the U.S. and European Union, may now push Moscow and Ankara even closer.\n\n\u201cRussia wants to benefit from that operation, and one of the gains could be the strengthening of ties with Turkey,\u201d said Kirill Semenov of the Russian International Affairs Council. \u201cThe harsh response from Washington, the EU reaction, the threat of sanctions against Turkey all play into Moscow\u2019s hands by making Moscow and Ankara even closer.\u201d\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called Putin just before unleashing airstrikes and an artillery barrage on Kurdish-controlled areas in Syria. Ankara charges that the Kurdish fighters in Syria are allied with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, which has led an insurgency against Turkey for 35 years.\n\nWhile Russia has noted the need to respect Syria\u2019s territorial integrity, it also has emphasized Turkey\u2019s right to ensure its security - a benevolent stance contrasting with the harsh Western criticism of the Turkish offensive.\n\nRussia has long urged the U.S.-allied Kurdish fighters in Syria to come back to Damascus\u2019 fold, an offer they may need to take more seriously now.\n\n\u201cWe heard that both Syrian officials and representatives of Kurdish organizations expressed interest in Russia using its good relations with all parties to the process in arranging such talks,\u201d Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told reporters on Thursday. \u201cWe will see what we can do.\u201d\n\nLavrov also pointed at another Moscow goal - brokering a dialogue between Turkey and Assad\u2019s government, something Ankara has strongly rejected in the past.\n\n\u201cIt would be good for Russia to bring Ankara and Damascus to the table and have Ankara acknowledge the legitimacy of the regime in Damascus, if not Assad himself,\u201d Semenov said.\n\nIn another power game, Russia hopes to see major gains in its long-running effort to retain leverage over its neighbor Ukraine, a former Soviet republic looking to align itself with the West. In 2014, Russia annexed Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula and threw its support behind a separatist insurgency in eastern Ukraine following the ouster of Ukraine\u2019s Moscow-friendly leader, moves that triggered bruising Western sanctions.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who was elected by a landslide in April, has vowed to end the fighting, which has killed more than 13,000. Early this month, Ukraine, Russia and the rebels signed a tentative agreement to hold local elections in the east, a deal Zelenskiy insists conforms to a 2015 peace accord that was brokered by France and Germany.\n\nThe agreement, however, has been criticized by some in Ukraine as \u201ccapitulation\u201d to Moscow. On Monday, far-right and nationalist groups are staging a major rally in Kyiv to protest Zelenskiy\u2019s peace plan.\n\nThe Ukrainian president has been drawn into the political furor in the United States, where Democrats in Congress are conducting an impeachment inquiry triggered by his telephone conversation with Trump. In the July 25 call, Trump pushed him to open a corruption investigation into Democratic rival Joe Biden and his son. In the days before the call, Trump ordered a freeze on hundreds of millions of dollars in badly needed U.S. military aid. After a congressional uproar, the aid was released in September.\n\nZelenskiy has denied being pressured by Trump, but this past week he encouraged U.S. and Ukrainian prosecutors to discuss investigating a gas company linked to Biden\u2019s son, although no one has produced evidence of criminal wrongdoing by either Biden.\n\nThe White House\u2019s publication of a rough transcript of the call was embarrassing for the 41-year-old Ukrainian president because it showed him eager to please Trump and dismissive of European partners whose support he needs to end the conflict in the east. While Zelenskiy sought to play it down, it could help Russia by eroding support for Ukraine in Germany and France.\n\n\u201cFrance and Germany have grown tired of Ukraine and are too busy with their own problems, and their only goal is to close the issue of the war in the east by any means,\u201d said Vadim Karasev, head of the Institute of Global Strategies, an independent Kyiv-based think tank. \u201cIf Russia offers a compromise, Berlin and Paris will heave a sigh of relief. By publicly kicking (German Chancellor Angela) Merkel and (French President Emmanuel) Macron, Zelenskiy untied their hands and there is no more talk about their \u2018friendly support.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn June, France helped Russia\u2019s delegation restore its credentials at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, five years after it was stripped of voting rights following the annexation of Crimea. Macron has also spoken about the prospect of Russia\u2019s eventual return to the Group of Seven, from which it was purged after annexing Crimea.\n\n\u201cRussia is the main beneficiary of that situation,\u201d Karasev said. \u201cPutin no longer has to prove that Ukraine is dangerous and toxic - Ukrainian and U.S. politicians have done the job for him. The Kremlin now just needs to wait until the Ukrainian apple falls into its lap, as the U.S., Germany and France all have got their share of toxic Ukrainian gifts and got poisoned.\u201d\n\n\u2013\n\nYuras Karmanau in Kyiv, Ukraine, and Konstantin Manenkov in Moscow contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "From Syria to Ukraine, new fault lines and tensions are offering the Kremlin fresh opportunities to expand its clout and advance its interests.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Vladimir Isachenkov"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/11/turkmenistan_russia_05819_c0-34-3238-1922_s1200x700.jpg?fe0bceeb9f4bdc08225118b3b9bad34becbf6eac", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
