We commend affected families and the Muslim community for exercising restraint in the face of this naked provocation.\n\n\"All normal human beings everywhere in the world respect the dead and allow them to rest in peace. The graves are sacred places. Violating the dignity of the departed is unacceptable and unjustifiable.\n\n\"Vandalising cemeteries is the worst form of barbarism and demonstrates the lowest level to which these faceless people have descended,\" Mabe said.\n\nThe ANC urged law enforcement agencies to leave no stone unturned in its efforts to find the perpetrators.\n\nThe head of the Muslim Judicial Council's cemetery management committee, Shaykh Riad Fataar, told the Voice of the Cape radio station that it would get to the bottom of what happened.\n\nHe added it was a difficult time for those who have buried their loved ones there and urged people not to share photos or videos showing the names on the gravestones.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "Mandla Mandela has called for the arrest of those who destroyed 80 Muslim tombstones and graves in the Mowbray Muslim cemetery in Cape Town.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/6591/07deac3ad0f24cbd935ca911e8710c09.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
