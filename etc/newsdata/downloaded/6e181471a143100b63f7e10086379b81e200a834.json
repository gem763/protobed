He\u2019s appreciated now he\u2019s retired, of course.\n\nYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve got until it\u2019s gone, and all that. We may never see the likes of Scholes again - a player with radar-like passing accuracy and a dogged tenacity to boot.\n\nThe under-appreciation of Paul Scholes remains one of the most perplexing in football\n\nYet it seems we are in danger of falling into the same trap with Harry Winks. Unassuming and quiet, the Tottenham midfielder is similar to Scholes in terms of his personal demeanour.\n\nThey\u2019re not too dissimilar on the pitch either. Winks - as he displayed against Bulgaria on Monday night - can dictate a football match much like Scholes was able to. The variation in his passing, too, carries similarities to Scholes.\n\nOf course, Winks has a mightily long way to go before he can authentically be compared to the Manchester United legend. But at 23-years-old, he has time on his side.\n\nHarry Winks has a long way to go to be seen in the same light as Scholes, but has parallels\n\nHis ability to control his team\u2019s tempo at club and international level, though, certainly bodes well. Unfortunately, a string of England managers didn\u2019t see the value of building their team around Scholes.\n\nHe was often moved around the pitch in hope of solving the Steven Gerrard/Frank Lampard conundrum, when really the team should really have been built around Scholes.\n\nWhile Zinedine Zidane, Xavi and Thierry Henry were marvelling at Scholes from afar, English football didn\u2019t know how to use him. Let\u2019s hope we\u2019re not saying the same thing about Winks 15 years down the line.\n\nHis controlled performance if Sofia, amid all the sickening racial hatred that was going on around him, displayed maturity beyond his years as he provided a technical solidity to England\u2019s midfield base that appeared lacking in last month\u2019s victory over Kosovo and last Friday\u2019s defeat to the Czech Republic.\n\nHis performance against Bulgaria should at least keep him in the England team for next month\u2019s clash against Montenegro, particularly with Jordan Henderson suspended.\n\nGareth Southgate certainly appreciates the calmness Winks brings to his team, his decision to restore the Spurs star to his midfield against the Bulgarians proving fruitful dividends as England romped home 6-0 victors.\n\nScholes was revered at Man United but was never used in the same way for the Three Lions\n\nLikewise, his international team-mates felt Winks\u2019 re-introduction into the starting XI and their convincing win and performance weren\u2019t coincidental.\n\nIn Winks we have a gem; the sort of player that\u2019s lauded on the continent but often undervalued here because of a perceived lack of physicality, although his defensive awareness and reading of the game should also be noted.\n\nEnglish football\u2019s most recent remit has been to hone players who rely on their technical craft rather than their physical attributes - much like the great Spain team that had diminutive pair Xavi and Anders Iniesta orchestrating the team from midfield.\n\nOr like Scholes did for Sir Alex Ferguson for so many years. In Winks, English football has a player who can play that role.\n\nLet\u2019s not undervalue him like we did with Scholes.", "description": "The under-appreciation of Paul Scholes remains one of the most perplexing conundrums in English football.\u00a0Now, history looks as though it could well be repeating itself with Harry Winks in the midfield.", "authors": ["Sami Mokbel For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/16/19795112-0-image-a-9_1571240401469.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
