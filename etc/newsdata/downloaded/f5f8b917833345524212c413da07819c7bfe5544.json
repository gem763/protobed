They said not only did Mr. Trump appear to break the law in his call with Ukraine, but delaying production of the complaint to Congress also broke the law.\n\nRepublicans said Democrats acted even before seeing the actual whistleblower complaint or even the transcript of the call between Mr. Trump and Ukraine\u2019s president.\n\nThe transcript was released Wednesday and undercut some of Democrats\u2019 contentions.\n\nIt showed the president did pressure Ukraine to conduct an investigation into a political opponent, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden. But Mr. Trump did not offer any quid pro quo in the conversation, undercutting the whistleblower\u2019s suggestions.\n\nMr. Maguire said he doesn\u2019t know the identity of the whistleblower, but said the allegations he or she made were based on \u201csecond-hand information.\u201d\n\nAnd he bristled at accusations that he himself broke the law by not sharing the information with Congress earlier, saying that he\u2019s had a long history of nonpartisan service in the military and the intelligence community and would not stand for being accused as a partisan hack.\n\n\u201cIn my nearly four decades of public service my integrity has never been questioned until now,\u201d Mr. Maguire told the House intelligence committee in a high-stakes hearing. \u201cI have upheld my responsibility to follow the law every step of the way in the matter that is before us today.\u201d\n\nHe also said whatever the back and forth of the last few weeks, Congress now has what it needs.\n\n\u201cIt may have taken longer than we would have liked, you would have liked, but you have the information,\u201d he said.\n\nDemocrats on Capitol Hill say Mr. Maguire was required by law to quickly share that with Congress, and they accused him of attempting to shield Mr. Trump from political danger.\n\nMr. Maguire, though, said he legally couldn\u2019t share the information with Congress because it contained material that may have been protected by executive privilege, and he had to wait on the White House to make a determination.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s declassification and production of the transcript on Wednesday settled that question.\n\nMr. Maguire also said he consulted the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel, the government\u2019s internal legal advisory branch, which ruled the president isn\u2019t part of the intelligence community and so the DNI didn\u2019t have authority over him, and he wasn\u2019t required to share the complaint.\n\nThe Justice Department said Wednesday it, not the intelligence community, was the right place to investigate the complaint \u2014 and it concluded there was no violation of campaign finance laws.\n\nThe department said that there was no clear thing of value Mr. Trump was soliciting in his conversation with the Ukrainian president, so there couldn\u2019t be a campaign finance issue.\n\nMr. Maguire refused to offer an assessment of the whistleblower complaint as he stared down a barrage of questions from Rep. Adam B. Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the committee.\n\n\u201cIt is not for me to decide,\u201d Mr. Maguire said when asked whether he thought the complaint detailed \u201cserious wrongdoing\u201d by the president.\n\nHe also defended holding the whistleblower complaint from Congress, citing a Justice Department opinion that the complaint did not rise to the level of urgent. Therefore it did not necessitate being handed over to Congress.\n\n\u201cMy job as director of intelligence is to comply with the Whistleblower Act and adhere to the meaning of \u2018urgent concern,\u2019 which is a legal definition,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
