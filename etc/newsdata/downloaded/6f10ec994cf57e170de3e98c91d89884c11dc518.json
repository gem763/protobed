That could be very negative. Do you mean we can\u2019t improve?\u201d asks Ken Burns of America\u2019s current nightmare. \u201cIt could be taken as very positive or very negative. I see them as both positive and negative. There will always be idiot bigots, and there will always be heroic people trying to stand up to them.\u201d\n\nThe remarkably prolific documentary filmmaker has been called \u201cthe foremost chronicler of the American experience,\u201d and it\u2019s hard to deny Burns the superlative. His sprawling documentaries on everything, from The Civil War to The National Parks to The Vietnam War, are not only essential viewing but taught in schools, and his latest epic, Country Music, follows in kind.\n\nOver the course of 16 hours, Country Music\u2014which is now available to stream in its entirety on PBS\u2014examines the complicated history of the music genre, from the Carter Family and Hank Williams to Dolly Parton and Johnny Cash. Along the way, it reckons with issues of class, the impact women had on country, and race.\n\nAnd Burns, who is seated across from me at our offices in New York, is always an intriguing interview subject given his vast wealth of historical knowledge. The last time we spoke was for The Central Park Five, his eye-opening film on the Central Park Five case that played a major role in landing the men a $41 million wrongful conviction settlement from the State of New York. Well, one of the villains of that story is now president, so naturally Burns had plenty to say about that, the evils of social media, and so much more.\n\nI\u2019m always curious how prolific you\u2019ve remained, because this is essentially a dozen documentaries in one.\n\nThe thing that\u2019s really important is, I don\u2019t have to do every interview if the other producers are competent in interviews, but I have two producing teams where they want me to do all the interviews, so I\u2019ll do them. These are not phoned in. I\u2019m there for every edit session, every script session, I\u2019m the one who decides what gets locked, so it\u2019s not relinquishing it, it\u2019s just I work with some talented folks, and it allows us to stagger it and use synergies of scale to get these things done.\n\nAnd the quality has remained at a very high level. Not to totally trash Alex Gibney, who\u2019s a talented guy, but it feels like he\u2019s overextended himself and the overall quality of his work has suffered as a result. In your case, the quality hasn\u2019t really diminished.\n\nI understand that. A lot of it is that we\u2019re all very greedy for creation. There\u2019s nothing better than making a film better that I know, just improving it in the script session, in the early blind assembly, in the assembly of the rough cut, in the mixing, or now when you\u2019re talking about it and evangelizing it. I\u2019m addicted to it. I mean, if I were given a thousand years to live, I would not run out of topics in American history. And I\u2019m not going to live a thousand years. I\u2019m 66 years old, and I know what I\u2019m going to be doing for the next ten years, god and funding willing. After that, I want to just keep going.\n\nWhat are you going to be working on for the next ten years, \u201cgod and funding willing?\u201d\n\nIn a few instances, I\u2019ve served as an executive producer. There\u2019s a new film coming out in September called College Behind Bars that my longtime co-director and co-producer Lynn Novick and Sarah Botstein made, and my son and daughter, Sarah Burns and David McMahon, that I made Central Park Five and Jackie Robinson with\u2014and we\u2019re also working on Muhammad Ali\u2014have a film called East Lake, which is about East Lake Meadows, the housing in Atlanta, and the whole history of housing by looking at one particular place. But I really am in the business of trying to share authorship with the people who have produced and worked with me for a long time, and it\u2019s great.\n\nI\u2019m sure you get asked this ad nauseam, but does a Trump miniseries interest you?\n\nYou know, I\u2019m in the history business. I\u2019d need 25 years distance before I do him. The thing with Country Music that I\u2019ve been realizing is, my subject is the U.S.\u2014capital \u2018U,\u2019 capital \u2018S.\u2019 I\u2019ve also been involved in the lowercase version of that, the two-letter plural pronoun \u2018us.\u2019 All the projects have reminded me that there\u2019s only \u201cus,\u201d there\u2019s no \u201cthem.\u201d We live in a binary media culture that\u2019s interested in accentuating differences between the \u201cother.\u201d Red state-blue state, young-old, gay-straight, rich-poor, male-female, north-south, whatever it is, we\u2019re always going to find some dialectic. But art isn\u2019t about that. Art is about the reconciliation of these contradictory things. So to me, there is no \u201cthem.\u201d There is no \u201cother.\u201d There\u2019s just \u201cus.\u201d The majesty and breath and even contradiction of the U.S., that\u2019s my beat.\n\nAnd I don\u2019t mean to sugarcoat stuff. I don\u2019t mean to say, \u201cOh, it\u2019s all great! Look at all the African-American influence in country music in the early days, isn\u2019t it great?\u201d No. All the indignities that have beset us with race are there in country music. But let us also say that, A.P. Carter of the original Carter Family, Hank Williams, Bill Monroe and Johnny Cash all had African-American mentors, and Jimmy Rogers, music\u2019s first superstar, was a water boy on these black railroad gangs that were laying track in Southern Mississippi. He\u2019s suffused with the blues. Even the Carter Family had a blues song. So when we think of country music, commerce and convenience suggests that we should categorize it into one thing but it\u2019s always been many things.\n\nIt\u2019s still the most overwhelmingly white genre of music, both in terms of performers and audience.\n\nYes, but the sources are the same. And let\u2019s remember that when Ray Charles got creatively control of an album for the first time he recorded, much to the surprise of his own people, Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music, and the great hit in the summer of \u201962 was \u201cI Can\u2019t Stop Loving You,\u201d and he said, \u201cYou take country music and you take black music and you have the same goddamn thing every time.\u201d And that speaks volumes. There\u2019s been DeFord Bailey, Charley Pride, and Darius Rucker, but now there\u2019s Rhiannon Giddens and other folks who are opening it up in country.\n\nAnd Lil Nas X.\n\nLil Nas X is the mic-drop moment for me. Everybody\u2019s arguing about, \u201cOh, Billboard took him off [the charts].\u201d He\u2019s the best-selling country singer of all-time, and he\u2019s a black gay rapper. What more do we have to say? Yes, it\u2019s the predominately white\u2014or the whitest\u2014and you could say that of bluegrass music and other forms.\n\nBut there have been barriers to entry for people of color in country music. When you talk about its embrace of the Confederate flag, and both fans and performers proudly waving it at shows\u2026\n\nOh, most definitely. The Ryman Auditorium used to have a thing called the \u201cConfederate Gallery,\u201d so that ought to tell people. But I got a picture of Charley Pride staring out into the Ryman audience at the Grand Ole Opry while it was there, and for the observant, that can\u2019t go unnoticed. All I\u2019m trying to say is I\u2019m not sugarcoating it, but just want people to understand that all the people we put on the Mount Rushmore of country music, they all had African-American mentors.\n\nDid you want to work on Country Music to soothe your soul, so to speak? Perhaps you saw all the chaos in the world and thought, well, this will be a good tonic?\n\nNo, I started working on this in 2010. It\u2019s just like Vietnam, where people said, \u201cOh my god, there\u2019s so much to be talked about the Trump administration,\u201d and I was like, I started that in 2006 and finished it a month before the Iowa caucus! I\u2019m a child of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll and R&B, and I wanted to dive into it. But I sold the stuff when I worked in a record store in the \u201860s in Ann Arbor, Michigan.\n\nOne of the great things about Country Music is it emphasizes the effect that women have had in shaping the history of it. It\u2019s something that really tends to go overlooked.\n\nThe original American lead guitarist is Maybelle Carter. Every guitarist in every genre owes something to Maybelle Carter and the \u201cCarter scratch.\u201d The original feminine voice of country music, which was dominant early on, was Sara Carter. And since then, there\u2019s been Maddox Brothers and Rose, there\u2019s been Kitty Wells, there\u2019s been Patsy Cline, and then you get to Loretta Lynn who\u2019s singing, \u201cDon\u2019t come home a-drinkin\u2019 with lovin\u2019 on your mind\u201d or \u201cThe Pill,\u201d well before anyone in rock or country is picking up on stuff like that. Then you haven\u2019t gotten into Dolly [Parton] yet, or Jeannie Seely, or Jean Shepard, or Reba McEntire.\n\nLoretta\u2019s politics have changed though.\n\nI don\u2019t give a shit about that. You know, what we\u2019re saying is that, if you\u2019re writing three chords and the truth, and you\u2019re speaking about universal human experiences, who cares? I mean, the implication is that a redneck doesn\u2019t feel something, and when a redneck hears, \u201cI\u2019m so lonesome I could cry,\u201d nothing gets in. Nothing could be further from the truth. There\u2019s no \u201cother.\u201d There\u2019s only \u201cus.\u201d We\u2019re 99.9% the same. We can discuss all this stuff but anytime you start making distinctions, not only are they in trouble but we\u2019re in trouble.\n\n\u201c And [Republicans have] now abandoned all the other admirable mandates, like fiscal responsibility, conservatism, a level playing field for everyone, and instead replaced it with this populist, xenophobic rant. \u201d\n\nI wanted to talk about your Central Park Five documentary. The case has been back in the news thanks both to Ava DuVernay\u2019s stunning Netflix miniseries When They See Us and Trump, who basically repeated his racist refrain about the boys (now men). It must be a bit bizarre to see all this boil to the surface seven years after your doc.\n\nWe feel pretty good. You know, we know that de Blasio came in promising to settle, and he did, and he told me that he wouldn\u2019t have settled if he hadn\u2019t seen our film. The important thing is that they were exonerated in 2002\u2014unfortunately, they\u2019d served their full terms. The second thing is that they were settled, and we were responsible for that, so that makes us happy. The rest of it is just the circus that it is: the dramatization of it, the ascension of Donald Trump, his quintupling down on their \u201cguilt.\u201d We know one thing: they didn\u2019t do the thing for which they were charged and spent an entire full term without even the benefit of parole, because once they\u2019d realized that they\u2019d been coerced into confessing, they didn\u2019t, so they served out their full sentences. It\u2019s a profile in courage. All of them had been friends with us while we worked on the film, we remain friends with them, and we\u2019ll be friend with them longer than anybody else who\u2019s at that trough.\n\nWhat did you think of When They See Us?\n\nI didn\u2019t see it. I didn\u2019t see it. I\u2019ve been working on too many films.\n\nThat case is really a good litmus test, because often when you discuss it with someone the bigotry jumps out.\n\nLet\u2019s remember what Trump did: he took out full-page ads in all the New York dailies asking for the return of the death sentence so that it could be applied to these innocent children. And he still insists that that would be the right thing to do.\n\nThis does seem to be a unique moment in American history, with Trump, because there\u2019s been this rise of populism and racism building in the Republican Party for quite some time, mostly through policy, but now it\u2019s all out in the open.\n\nThis action is not unprecedented, but having this action come from the presidency is unprecedented. This is a Republican Party founded in 1854 in a schoolhouse in Ripon, Wisconsin, which had one purpose, which was the abolition of slavery. They achieved that with their second candidate, which was Abraham Lincoln, and they\u2019ve been running away from that mandate ever since. And they\u2019ve now abandoned all the other admirable mandates, like fiscal responsibility, conservatism, a level playing field for everyone, and instead replaced it with this populist, xenophobic rant.\n\nBad-faith people on the right always use that argument that the Democrats were pro-slavery and conveniently ignore the party realignment of the \u201850s and \u201860s with the Southern strategy.\n\nThe Southern strategy that they chose liberated the Democrats from the worst thing that they ever had, which was that part of the Democratic Party was the solid South, which was essentially obstructionists\u2014the Dixiecrats\u2014and once they moved over the Republican Party, liberated the Democratic Party to be a party of civil rights\u2014I mean, it had already become the party of civil rights with LBJ doing it, and before that Truman and before that FDR, but it allowed them to be freed from the albatross of carrying with it a lot of racists. Now, the Republican Party ironically has that, and they\u2019ve abandoned all the other tenets of that, and Democrats have to go out now and say, \u201cWe\u2019re going to be fiscally responsible.\u201d The last time we balanced a budget was under Bill Clinton, and everyone\u2019s taking credit right now for this current economic prosperity but it\u2019s mostly due to Obama.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting how American history is taught in schools. I was talking with my girlfriend recently about how you\u2019d have these weird American-purity exercises as young kids, where each kid had to trace their American lineage and how far back it went. Naturally, you\u2019d have some kids in class whose relatives went all the way back to the Mayflower, and those kids were seemingly rewarded for that, and you had immigrant kids in the class who felt alienated by the exercise. This sort of American hierarchy is ingrained from very early on.\n\nIt\u2019s not a conspiracy but power structures will out. There\u2019s a dominant power structure in the United States, and it\u2019s actually gotten much better because now we\u2019re teaching kids about all kinds of histories. Kids are learning about Sojourner Truth, Harriet Tubman, Frederick Douglass, Martin Luther King, and Harvey Milk.\n\nHow maddening do you find the treatment of history in 2019? Because there are so many bad-faith people out there mangling history to accommodate their arguments. And social media seems to be making it worse.\n\nIt\u2019s not \u201csocial media,\u201d it\u2019s \u201canti-social\u201d\u2014because of the very thing you\u2019re talking about. If the Russians can influence our election with 278 million Facebook ads, how is that good? How is that \u201csocial?\u201d Social is communication between people; not lies fostered on them. It\u2019s not social. I don\u2019t do any of that shit! Why would you? Get off social media. Lose your Facebook. Stop Twitter. Don\u2019t do any of that stuff anymore. What does it do? Nothing! We have a president only because he\u2019s good at Twitter, who is a megalomaniac. Get off it! Why listen? Why pay attention? I read a couple of newspapers, only in the hard copy, and I watch some broadcast news. That\u2019s it.\n\nI\u2019d love to see a Ken Burns social media docuseries.\n\nI don\u2019t need to do it! It sucks! It\u2019s like stepping in dogshit!", "description": "The documentarian opens up to Marlow Stern about his latest opus \u201cCountry Music,\u201d Trump\u2019s unique brand of hate, and why we should all get off social media.", "authors": ["Marlow Stern", "Senior Entertainment Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570690793/190927-ken-burns-tease_niwywi", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
