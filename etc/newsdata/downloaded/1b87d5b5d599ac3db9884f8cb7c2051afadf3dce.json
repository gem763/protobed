Another died of a heart attack.\n\nHere\u2019s a bit more detail from the The Guardian:\n\nJewell was one of about 30,000 police and guards, the largest peacetime security force in US history, enlisted to protect the Atlanta Olympics. He\u2019d been hired as a temporary contractor by the security firm Anthony Davis Associates and had been on duty for nearly seven hours in Centennial Park when he spotted the unattended pack beneath a bench near the tower at 12:58am. Nine minutes later a 911 call from a nearby phone booth told dispatchers: \u201cThere is a bomb in Centennial Park. You have 30 minutes.\u201d At 1:15am, a team of security officers including Jewell began clearing the area. The contents, three pipe bombs surrounded by masonry nails, detonated roughly 10 minutes later before all spectators could be removed. Among the fallen were Alice Hawthorne, a 44-year-old cable TV company receptionist from Georgia who died of \u201cmultiple penetration injuries\u201d from the flying metal fragments, and Turkish cameraman Melih Uzunyol, 40, who died of a heart attack while rushing to film the scene.\n\nIf not for Richard, many more lives would\u2019ve been lost.\n\nFor a moment, the 33-year-old Danville, Georgia native was hailed as savior. He was all over television and in the papers.\n\nBut then, holy crap, a twist \u2014 the FBI turned to him as potential suspect:\n\n[W]hen Piedmont College president Ray Cleere phoned the FBI the following afternoon to suggest that Jewell, a former campus security guard at the school with a reputation for overzealousness, might have planted the bomb himself in order to play the hero, the FBI looked further into his background.\n\nFor three months, Richard got the 1990\u2019s version of the mob/frenzied idiocy.\n\nBack then, that was only possible via the media; trolls and social justice warriors and generally most of the dumbest things happening right now didn\u2019t yet exist.\n\nBut boy, the media hammered the guy.\n\nIt was the worst journalism has to offer. Richard seemed wholly convicted by the press, before anyone knew what was what.\n\nAt 4:50pm on Tuesday, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution published a special edition led by a 10-paragraph, 365-word story with no attribution that stated Jewell was the \u201cfocus of a federal investigation\u201d. The banner headline screamed: FBI suspects \u2018hero\u2019 guard may have planted bomb. Seven minutes later CNN broadcast the story, holding the Journal-Constitution up to the camera. At 5.11pm, the Associated Press released a wire story attributed to its own sources. Shortly after, NBC Nightly News anchor Tom Brokaw said on air: \u201cThe speculation is that the FBI is close to \u2018making the case\u2019, in their language. They probably have enough to arrest him right now, probably enough to prosecute him, but you always want to have enough to convict him as well. There are still some holes in this case.\u201d A second-day opinion piece in the Atlanta newspaper only doubled down on the scoop: \u201cLike this one, he became famous in the aftermath of murder. His name was Wayne Williams,\u201d columnist Dave Kindred wrote, referencing the serial child murderer. \u201cThis one is Richard Jewell.\u2019\u2019\n\nAnd now, the Fake News fiasco\u2019s gettin\u2019 a bit of what-for, from none other than one of Hollywood\u2019s most unwoke heavyweights: Clint Eastwood.\n\nThe trailer for the new movie\u2019s out, and it socks it to the media machine somethin\u2019 fierce.\n\nAs noted by TDW:\n\nIndeed, it is all about the narrative. At one point in the trailer, a journalist (played by Olivia Wilde) tells her newspaper editor that \u201cJewell fits the profile of a lone bomber, a frustrated white man who is a police wannabe who seeks to become a hero.\u201d She says this without a lick of evidence to support her claims. \u201cWe\u2019re running it,\u201d her editor says in reply.\n\nRemind you of maybe a few other things in the news these last couple years?\n\nThe film\u2019s based on Vanity Fair\u2019s 1997 article, \u201cAmerican Nightmare \u2014 the Ballad of Richard Jewell.\u201d\n\nEnjoy the trailer for Richard Jewell \u2014 starring Kathy Bates, Sam Rockwell, and I, Tonya\u2019s Paul Walter Hauser \u2014 above.\n\nClint sure doesn\u2019t go for cultural Marxism goofiness \u2014 see here. I\u2019d say he\u2019s gonna tell it like it is.\n\nAnd the 89-year-old \u2014 who should be an inspiration to us all \u2014 is still an amazing director.\n\nCan\u2019t wait.\n\n-ALEX\n\nRelevant RedState links in this article: here.\n\nSee 3 more pieces from me:\n\nWhoopi Goldberg Has A Surprising Message For The \u2018Will & Grace\u2019 Stars Calling For A Blacklist Of Hollywood Republicans\n\nA Hollywood Icon Makes An Astonishing Claim, And It Raises An Important Question: How Can We Return To One Nation Under God?\n\nCandace Owens Relives Last Year\u2019s Chicken And Waffles Antifa Antagonism And Pegs The Group Perfectly (Video)\n\nFind all my RedState work here.\n\nAnd please follow Alex Parker on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nThank you for reading!
