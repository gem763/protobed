The press and social media in Mexico are rife with reports of the army\u2019s disgust with Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s decision to let Mr. Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez go. But why go after him in the first place?\n\nA possible theory could be that Mr. Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez was located by the D.E.A., and their Mexican counterparts were reluctant to detain him. Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador stated months ago that he had abandoned the widely criticized United States-backed \u201ckingpin strategy\u201d of focusing on drug lords: 12 years of that strategy had only brought more violence and failed to curtail the size, power and ferocity of the cartels.\n\nThe battle of Culiac\u00e1n illustrates that the Sinaloa cartel is no weaker today than before the war on drugs began . Perhaps the Mexican authorities who received the American tip-off understood that if they didn\u2019t nab Mr. Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez , the Americans would out them as complicit \u2014 and so opted to proceed halfheartedly and disastrously. With the revised North American trade pact, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, stuck in Congress, Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s may have felt coerced to act.\n\nNormally, when the authorities go after high-value targets, they do so with overwhelming force. But just 35 troops were deployed to arrest Mr. Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez . Mexican forces were outmatched and quickly overtaken. The city was not sealed off by the government forces and there were no American Black Hawks to back them up. Only the Guzm\u00e1n forces succeeded in bringing the city to a violent halt.", "description": "After the recent spate of violence, President L\u00f3pez Obrador should advise the U.S. that the war on drugs is not the focus of his agenda.", "authors": ["Jorge G.
