At long last, the first phase of the complex \u2014 the Nickelodeon Universe theme park and an ice-skating rink \u2014 opened on Friday. Friends and family of some of the mall owners and employees were invited to experience the theme park on opening day.\n\nThough tickets to the theme park sold out well before opening day, the public was invited to explore the unfinished complex and partake in various pop-up Halloween-themed activities and enjoy an ice-skating rink in the mall.\n\nNew Jersey Transit added express bus services to transport guests to and from the mall to help alleviate traffic. The New York Waterway is also running a ferry service to American Dream from Manhattan with dedicated shuttles to help travelers complete their journey.\n\nI took the New Jersey express bus line to American Dream on opening day and found it almost entirely empty. When I got to the mall, it was devoid of the large crowds that characterized Mall of America when it first opened in 1992. Still, the theme park and ice-skating rink were in great shape.\n\n\"This is a big day for New Jersey and a whole lot of folks,\" New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said at the opening-day ceremony with representatives from Triple Five Group, which has overseen the project since 2011.\n\nHere's what it was like to go to American Dream on its opening day.", "description": "The American Dream megamall opened to the public last week.
