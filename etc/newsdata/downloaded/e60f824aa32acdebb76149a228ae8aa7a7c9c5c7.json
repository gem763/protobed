She told the Rolling Stone last year that moving to Minneapolis was \u201cone of the best decisions\u201d she\u2019s made in her life.\n\nOmar clearly isn\u2019t the only Lizzo fan in the House of Representatives. Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) can be seen dancing alongside Omar in another video from the same event.\n\n\u201cEven @AyannaPressley loves our home girl!\u201d Omar tweeted.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true we all love you @lizzo,\u201d Pressley responded.\n\nThe Congressional Black Caucus Foundation is hosting its Annual Legislative Conference, which includes numerous policy forums, in D.C., from Sept. 11 to Sept. 15.\n\nOn Tuesday, Omar, Pressley, Underwood and Hayes joined other members of the Congressional Black Caucus on Capitol Hill as it commemorated the 400th anniversary of the first-recorded forced arrival of enslaved African people in America.\n\nAs we remember and honor the 400th Anniversary of all of the enslaved Africans arrival in America, we must never forget the tragedies, successes, and contributions of all of them and all of their progeny. #400YearsLater pic.twitter.com/RlCBiYSviH \u2014 The Black Caucus (@TheBlackCaucus) September 10, 2019", "description": "The Minnesota representative was seen jamming with other elected officials at an event during Congressional Black Caucus week in Washington, D.C.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7cfd1e2300001c055397a4.jpeg?cache=trsruhr1eh&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
