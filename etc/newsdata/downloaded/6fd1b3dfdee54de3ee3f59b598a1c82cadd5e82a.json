The network has 1,766 pits, 840 kilometres of fibre cables, and 102,000 kilometres of individual fibres. The government spends approximately AU$5 million per year on new connections to the network and AU$3 million in annual uptake.\n\nThe work required to be carried out is divided into three service categories: Minor works and associated services; fibre optical splicing and testing services; and civil infrastructure, minor construction, and cabling services.\n\nSee also: Why Australia is quickly developing a technology-based human rights problem (TechRepublic)\n\nSpecifically, this includes supplying and installing new pits; installing new lead-in cables; supplying and installing sub-ducts between pits; and perform tests to verify that services are properly completed.\n\nThe tender documents outlined that tenderers can tender for one, some, or all three of the work categories, stating that tenderers must tender for all the services in a single service category and not just part of those services.\n\nIn addition to carrying out work for these service categories, the documents also noted that successful contractors will be required to carry out minor works from \"time to time\" for GNSB, including site map analysis; 24/7 emergency call out capability; site coordination and supervision capabilities; and minor infrastructure repairs.\n\nFinance said while the panel will be created for three years, there is the potential to extend it for three further periods spanning two years each.\n\n\"Any such extension will be at Finance's discretion, and will be based on available funding and satisfactory performance by the contractor/s of its obligations under its DoSO (deed of standing offer) and will be subject to written agreement between the parties,\" the Department of Finance outlined in the documents.\n\nAhead of tender closing 14 November 2019, Finance said it will carry out an industry briefing on 17 October 2019.\n\nOnce a panel is formed, service is scheduled to commence on 1 April 2020.\n\nAt one point, the Australian government had considered selling off ICON when it appointed KPMG to advise on the potential sale in 2015.\n\nEarlier this year, the Digital Transformation Agency published a discussion paper on its ideas to refresh the whole-of-government telecommunications panel, that considered the inclusion of further services, such as dark fibre, unified communications, and software-defined WAN (SDWAN).\n\nThe new telecommunications panel would consolidate the expiring mobile panel, the expired telecommunications management panel, and the current telecommunications services panel. It would also see the addition of new categories not currently under a panel arrangement.\n\nCurrently on the telecommunications service panel that was announced last December include Telstra, TPG Network, Macquarie Telecom, Verizon Australia, Nextgen Networks, and Sliced Tech.\n\nRelated coverage\n\n100 vendors make Aussie whole-of-government software panel\n\nThe panel refresh is meant to simplify how the Australian government procures tech-related products and services.\n\nCommonwealth seeks more businesses to join Digital Marketplace Panel\n\nThe DTA is updating its Digital Marketplace Panel Master Agreement and adding three new panel categories for government to procure services from.\n\nDepartment of Human Services seeks off-the-shelf 'innovation' platform\n\nTo be hosted either externally or internally.\n\nACT Health Directorate signs AU$3.2m SaaS contract with TechOne\n\nACT Health Directorate's on-premise inventory management system will be replaced with an 'end-to-end' Software-as-a-Service solution.", "description": "A request for tender has been launched to find a maximum of 12 contractors that can maintain, service, expand, and protect the agency's network and associated infrastructure.", "authors": ["Aimee Chanthadavong"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/04/09/7f0e60cc-7fb2-420d-bfb3-00421c4bd4e5/thumbnail/770x578/05c85094bd4c240545e73fd6eabb96d7/fiberistock-1063190374.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
