Draghi put the helmet on a shelf in his office.\n\nVoicing Germans' angst, Helmut Schleweis, president of Germany's powerful savings banks association, said the ECB's latest policy package \"does more harm than good\".\n\nGerman Finance Minister Olaf Scholz sought to calm savers worried ahead of Thursday's ECB meeting.\n\n\"Most contracts that customers have with their banks do not currently allow such penalty rates, so the problem is not acute,\" Scholz said. \"Banks' boards are wise enough to grasp what they would trigger with such penalty rates.\n\nBut Joachim Wuermeling, a board member of Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, struck a different tone: \"Banks could soon pass on lower interest rates to even more customers,\" Wuermeling told Focus magazine.\n\nNobody should be surprised if banks demanded higher fees and were mulling negative interest rates, Wuermeling said. \"It may be necessary from a business and banking supervisory point of view,\" he added.\n\nGermans have long looked to the Bundesbank as a pillar of stability and guarantor of a stable currency.\n\nFormed in 1957, the German central bank was a model for central bank independence in the years that followed, but its president is now just one voice on the ECB's Governing Council.\n\nNew Austrian National Bank Governor Robert Holzmann, who also sits on the ECB's policymaking Council, said the ECB's policy met \"pushback\" at a meeting this week.\n\nAsked whether the new measures were a mistake, Holzmann, who has a seat on the ECB Governing Board, told Bloomberg TV: \"I'm sure this idea crossed the mind of some people and it definitely crossed my mind.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Writing by Paul Carrel; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky)", "description": "Mass-selling German newspaper Bild on Friday accused European Central Bank President Mario Draghi of \"sucking dry\" the bank accounts of Germany's savers, a day after the ECB cut interest rates deeper into negative territory.
