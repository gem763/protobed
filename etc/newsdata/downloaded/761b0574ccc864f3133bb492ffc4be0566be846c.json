We often talk about when we report our findings, we often combine Democrats and Democratic-leaners and Republicans and Republican-leaners,\u201d Alec Tyson, a senior researcher at the Pew Research Center, told The Hill.\n\nThe decreasing number of independents comes after the 2016 general election ended up hinging on a small group of voters in a handful of battleground states like Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania that tipped the race to President Trump.\n\nHillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonTrump's economic approval takes hit in battleground states: poll This is how Democrats will ensure Trump's re-election The Hill's Morning Report - Trump takes 2020 roadshow to New Mexico MORE, the 2016 Democratic nominee, was widely seen as having lost due to Trump\u2019s presence in those three states, as well as to lower turnout from key constituencies like African Americans.\n\nThe battle in 2020 so far has been marked by rising partisan rhetoric from both sides.\n\nTrump and Republicans have branded Democrats as \u201csocialists\u201d or accused them of having radical ideas, like \u201cMedicare for All\u201d and increased gun control measures.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in the Republican interest to nationalize races,\u201d Kelly Dietrich, founder of the National Democratic Training Committee, told The Hill. \u201cThey want everyone thinking that Democrats are just way too crazy, progressive, extreme on the coast, don\u2019t care about anyone else but the liberal elite.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a strategy to pull everything down into the mud,\u201d he continued.\n\nOn the Democratic side, Biden has been the front-runner in the race according to national polls, but Warren has seen enthusiasm around her campaign rise, becoming one of the former vice president\u2019s main rivals.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMeanwhile, moderate candidates like Sen.

Both were unable to qualify for the debate stage last week and continue to poll among in single digits at most.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a handful of the underdogs who are trying to persuade independents like Sen. Bennet and Gov. Bullock,\u201d Jennifer Holdsworth, senior vice president of issues management at MWWPR Public Affairs, said.\n\nThat is not to say, however, that Democratic and Republican voters are all sharply partisan.\n\nSelf-described independents still comprise a large segment of the voters in 2018, but they tend to lean toward one party or the other.\n\nFifty-four percent of Republican-leaning independents said they voted in the 2018 midterm elections compared to 61 percent of Republican voters, according to Pew.\n\nAt the same time, 48 percent of Democratic-leaning independents said they voted in 2018, compared to 59 percent of Democrats.\n\nThirty-three percent of independents with no political leaning said they voted in the same midterm elections, according to the survey.\n\nPure independent voters, though dwindling in numbers, can more easily influence races at the congressional level, according to strategists, especially in swing districts that have a large number of less partisan voters who are swayed by local issues.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a large swath of persuadable independents that congressional candidates are still trying to appeal to. It\u2019s much less about a base vote unless you\u2019re in a primary in a very safe, blue district,\u201d said Holdsworth at MWWPR Public Affairs.\n\nApproaching these voters means focusing less on Trump, unlike the 2020 presidential race where defeating \u2014 or reelecting \u2014 the president is the primary issue.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re running as a Democrat, people know where you stand on Trump, you\u2019re not going to change their mind,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat you need to do is talk and connect with voters about the issues that matter to them,\u201d said Dietrich.", "description": "The number of pure independent voters is dwindling, leading to an increase in partisanship as both Democrats and Republicans move to rally their bases ahead of the 2020 presidential race.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/independentsillustration_thehill.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
