This is because of the recent evidence that the unusually low level of this long-term monetary indicator is starting to have a significant short-term effect.\n\nThe following chart shows that the year-over-year rate of change in U.S. True Money Supply (TMS), a.k.a. the U.S. monetary inflation rate, made a new 12-year low in August-2019. Furthermore, the latest TMS growth figure for the U.S. is very close to the 20-year low registered in September-2006.\n\nWithin three months of the TMS growth trough in September-2006 the first obvious crack appeared in the U.S. mortgage debt/securitisation bubble. The crack was a trading update issued by HSBC on 5th December 2006 that noted the increasing \u201cchallenges\u201d being faced by the Mortgage Services operations of HSBC Finance Corporation. This initial sign of weakness was followed by the appearance of a much larger crack on 7th February 2007.\n\nThat\u2019s when HSBC issued another trading update that included a profit warning due to substantially increased loan impairment charges. Within days of this February-2007 HSBC update, the shares of sub-prime lending specialists such as New Century Financial and NovaStar Financial went into freefall. This marked the beginning of the Global Financial Crisis, although the U.S. stock market didn\u2019t top out until October of 2007 and industrial commodities such as and didn\u2019t top out until mid-2008.\n\nThe above-mentioned events could be relevant to the current situation, in that the recent chaos in the U.S. short-term funding market could be the initial \u2018crack\u2019 in today\u2019s global debt edifice. While the low rate of U.S. monetary was not the proximate catalyst for the recent chaos, there is little doubt that it played a part. Temporary issues such as a corporate tax deadline and a large addition by the U.S. Treasury to its account at the Fed would not have had such a dramatic effect if the money supply had been growing at a \u2018normal\u2019 pace.\n\nGenerally, when the money supply is growing very slowly within a debt-based monetary system, a relatively small increase in the demand for cash can create the impression that there is a major cash shortage.\n\nNow, if there\u2019s one thing we can be sure of it\u2019s that the next crisis will look nothing like the last crisis. The financial markets work that way because after a crisis occurs \u2018everyone\u2019, including all policy-makers, will be on guard against a repeat performance, making a repeat performance extremely improbable. Therefore, we can be confident that even if the recent temporary seizure of the U.S. short-term funding market was a figurative shot across the bow, within the next couple of years there will NOT be a major liquidity event that looks like the 2007-2008 crisis. However, some sort of crisis, encompassing an economic recession, is probable within this 2-year period.\n\nThe nature of the next crisis will be determined by how the Fed reacts to signs of economic weakness and short-term funding issues such as the one that arose a few weeks ago. In particular, quick action by the Fed to boost the money supply would greatly reduce the probability of a deflation scare and greatly increase the risk that the next crisis will involve relatively high levels of what most people call \u201cinflation\u201d.\n\nAs an aside, there\u2019s a big difference between the Fed cutting its targeted short-term interest rates and the Fed directly boosting the money supply. For example, in reaction to signs of stress in the financial system the Fed commenced a rate-cutting program in September of 2007, but it didn\u2019t begin to directly pump money into the system until September of 2008. In effect, during the last crisis the Fed did nothing to address liquidity issues until almost two years after the appearance of the initial \u2018crack\u2019. As a consequence, the monetary inflation rate remained low and monetary conditions remained \u2018tight\u2019 until October of 2008 \u2014 12 months after the start of an equity bear market and 10 months after the start of an economic recession.\n\nEarly indications are that the Fed will be very quick to inject new money this time around, partly because 2007-2008 is still fresh in the memory. These early indications include the rapidity of the Fed\u2019s response to the effective seizure of the \u201crepo\u201d market last month and the fact that last Friday the Fed introduced a $60B/month asset monetization program. This program is QE in everything except name. In other words, the Fed already has resumed Quantitative Easing even though is growing at about 2%/year, the is at a generational low and the stock market is near an all-time high.\n\nIn summary, while it is too early to have a clear view of how the next major crisis will unfold, something along the lines of 2007-2008 can be ruled out. Also, there are tentative signs that the next crisis will coincide with or follow a period of relatively high \u201cinflation\u201d.", "description": "Stocks Analysis by Steve Saville covering: Copper Futures, Crude Oil WTI Futures.
