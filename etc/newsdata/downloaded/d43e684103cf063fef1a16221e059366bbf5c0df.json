Play was stopped and the game was called after a wait of 1 hour, 15 minutes.\n\nTim Anderson, who entered leading the majors with a .338 average, was 0 for 2 for the White Sox when it was stopped. Those at-bats were wiped out, as was Grayson Greiner\u2019s homer for Detroit and an RBI for Miguel Cabrera.\n\nThe teams will play a straight doubleheader on Saturday starting at 2:10 p.m. Detroit and Chicago meet in their season finale Sunday - with both teams far out of playoff contention, there will be no makeup added, leaving the clubs one short of the regular 162 games.\n\nThe Tigers are last in the majors with a 46-112 record. The White Sox are 70-88 and in third place in the AL Central.\n\nFriday\u2019s doubleheader was scheduled after a July 2 game in Chicago was postponed by rain.\n\nBoth managers tweaked their rotations due to dicey weather, going with Matt Hall and Carson Fulmer as openers in the first game in place of scheduled starters Tyler Alexander and Iv\u00e1n Nova.\n\nFulmer went 2 2/3 innings and allowed three runs on three hits before Jace Fry took over. Hall pitched two innings and allowed two runs on four hits before being relieved by Nick Ram\u00edrez to start the third.\n\nRyan Cordell had a two-run double for Chicago. Dawel Lugo hit a two-run double for Detroit.\n\nCHISOX LOOKING AHEAD\n\nWhite Sox GM Rick Hahn told reporters before the game he\u2019d like to add a right fielder, designated hitter and starting pitcher in the offseason. Chicago\u2019s mix of players who have played right has combined for only a .220 average, six homers and 39 RBIs. White Sox DHs were batting just .203 with 15 homers and 17 RBIs.\n\nHahn also said prospects Luis Robert and Nick Madrigal should be ready to step into roles in center field and at second base at some point in 2020.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM:\n\nWhite Sox: RHP Dylan Cease underwent an MRI on his left hamstring on Friday. The rookie was scratched as the starter at the last minute before Thursday night\u2019s gave versus Cleveland. . Rookie OF Eloy Jim\u00e9nez was the DH on Friday after missing two games with White Sox with an ear-throat infection, was out of the lineup for a second straight game. . OF Leury Garcia (sore right shoulder) also returned to the lineup in right after sitting out Thursday\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe starters for Saturday\u2019s doubleheader will be Tigers LHP Matthew Boyd (9-11, 4.57) vs. RHP Reynaldo Lopez (9-15, 5.57) in the first game. In the second game, it will be Alexander (1-4, 4.99) vs. Nova (11-12, 4.80).\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The doubleheader between the Detroit Tigers and Chicago White Sox scheduled for Friday night was rained out, and as a result the teams will play only 161 games this season.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Matt Carlson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/27/tigers_white_sox_baseball_96995_c0-193-4626-2890_s1770x1032.jpg?c8d798b608acb2adad484543b2523df9a7ecb1c1", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
