I mean, \u2018lock her up,\u2019 all the things he says, all the vicious, mean things he says, they love it. There are these people in this country. They\u2019re good Americans otherwise. They\u2019ll probably give you the shirt off their back, they\u2019ll help you if you need it, but they have this fixation. They want to return this country to the white Christian country that they believe it should be again. They don\u2019t want the diversity, and they follow him for this, but they\u2019re not the country. We are a diverse people, we are good and strong because of that, and we\u2019re going to come back to that. I assure you.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "description": "On Sunday's broadcast of CNN's \"Reliable Sources,\" former ABC \"World News' anchor Sam Donaldson accused President Donald Trump's supporters of having a \"fixation\" on returning America to a \"white Christian country.\" | Clips", "authors": ["Pam Key"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/11/SD.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
