It turns out that politics is more complicated than light entertainment.\n\nWhat he said: Just at the moment when voters are desperate for us to focus on their priorities, we are continuing to chew the supermasticated subject of Brexit, when what people want, what Leavers want, what Remainers want, what the whole world wants \u2013 is to be calmly and sensibly done with the subject, and to move on.\n\nWhat he meant: I am desperate to find a way out of the corner into which I have painted myself.

We can, we must and we will. Even though things have not been made easier by the surrender bill.\n\nWhat he meant: We can\u2019t and we won\u2019t, but in my mind it won\u2019t be my fault.\n\nWhat he said: Let\u2019s get this thing done \u2013 and then let\u2019s get ready to make our case to the country. Against the fratricidal antisemitic Marxists who were in Brighton last week.\n\nWhat he meant: I can\u2019t get this thing done, and I can\u2019t even call an election. But I\u2019ve got some really colourful language I would use if I could.\n\nWhat he said: Today in Brussels we are tabling what I believe are constructive and reasonable proposals, which provide a compromise for both sides.\n\nWhat he meant: As soon as this conference is out of the way I can compromise.\n\nWhat he said: We will under no circumstances have checks at or near the border in Northern Ireland.\n\nWhat he meant: That was what we proposed, but it went down very badly, so we\u2019re not going to call them \u201cchecks\u201d.\n\nWhat he said: If we fail to get an agreement because of what is essentially a technical discussion of the exact nature of future customs checks, when that technology is improving the whole time, then let us be in no doubt of what the alternative is ...\n\nWhat he meant: I am really worried now. The alternative is the end of my short time as prime minister.\n\nWhat he said: The alternative is no deal. That is not an outcome we want. It is not an outcome we seek at all. But let me tell you this, conference, it is an outcome for which we are ready.\n\nWhat he meant: I have to say this. I have no idea how to get round the law against a no-deal Brexit, and I know you are worried that I have no idea what I am doing. You are right to be worried. I have not a clue.\n\nWhat he said: It is only by delivering Brexit that we can address that feeling in so many parts of the country that they have been left behind, ignored, and that their towns were not only suffering from a lack of love and investment, but their views had somehow become unfashionable or unmentionable.\n\nWhat he meant: All I can offer you is some cheap recycled jokes and some Trumpian themes about how political correctness means no one can say what they think any more.\n\nWhat he said: The NHS is holy to the people of this country because of the simple beauty of its principle \u2013 that it doesn\u2019t matter who you are or where you come from, but when you are sick the whole country figuratively gathers at your bedside, and does everything it can to make you well again.\n\nWhat he meant: I shall leave my offering at the shrine of the national religion, just as all prime ministers, Labour and Conservative, have done before me since 1948.\n\nWhat he said: We are the party of the NHS precisely because we are the party of capitalism\u2026 We understand the vital symmetry at the heart of the modern British economy between a dynamic enterprise culture and great public services.\n\nWhat he meant: It\u2019s basically the trick that Tony Blair pulled off, and if it weren\u2019t for this Brexit nonsense I\u2019d be really good at it. Whose idea was this stupid Brexit anyway?\n\nWhat he said: London has overtaken New York as the number one city for investment in fintech firms, and that is before we have even delivered Crossrail \u2013 which by the way was on time and on budget when the last mayor left office.\n\nWhat he meant: I used to be mayor of London, you know. Simpler times. Lots of Remainy Labour people loved me.\n\nWhat he said: The Tokamak fusion reactor in Culham [is] on the verge of creating commercially viable miniature fusion reactors for sale around the world, delivering virtually unlimited zero-carbon power. Now I know they have been on the verge for some time \u2013 it is a pretty spacious kind of verge \u2013 but remember, all you sceptics, it was only a few years ago when people were saying that solar power would never work in cloudy old UK.\n\nWhat he meant: I am on the verge of success. All you have to do is believe.\n\nWhat he said: Let\u2019s get Brexit done, and let\u2019s finally believe in ourselves and what we can do.\n\nWhat he meant: I have nothing to offer.", "description": "What Boris Johnson said:\u00a0I should begin by paying tribute to my predecessor, Theresa\u2026 We will continue with your work of tackling domestic violence and modern slavery, and building on your legacy.\u00a0 What he really meant:\u00a0This is the duty bit.
