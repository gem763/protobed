According to a monthly survey by the National Federation of Independent Businesses, \u201ca record percentage of small business owners reported having difficulties finding qualified workers in August.\u201d It\u2019s been the top problem in the survey since January 2018. Policy makers need to listen.\n\nFifty-seven percent of last month\u2019s respondents, including 89% of those \u201chiring or trying to hire,\u201d found \u201cfew or no qualified applicants for the positions they were trying to fill.\u201d The construction industry had the highest share of owners reporting hiring difficulties at 68%; manufacturing was second at 59%. With the unemployment rate near a 50-year low and a record 157.9 million Americans employed, there are simply fewer workers available.\n\nPartly as a result, average monthly job growth as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics has slowed, from 223,000 last year to 158,000 so far this year. Some experts have seized on this decline as evidence that the longest economic recovery on record is losing steam. And it\u2019s true that a global economic slowdown, the Fed\u2019s actions on interest rates, and concerns about the trade war with China have dampened the recovery. But the tight labor market is the elephant in the room.\n\nEmployers are still hiring and the demand for employees remains high, indicating both underlying economic strength and confidence in the future. Yet a shortage of employees inevitably affects economic growth. A business won\u2019t open a new factory or restaurant if it can\u2019t staff the ones it already has. Labor shortages also can hold back capital spending. What good is a new truck if you can\u2019t find someone to drive it?\n\nWhen President Trump took office, there were 1.9 million more people unemployed than job openings. Thanks to tax cuts, regulatory rollbacks and a focus on domestic energy production, that comparison has flipped. For the past 17 consecutive months, job openings have exceeded the number of unemployed. In July, the most recent month for which we have data, job openings stood at 7.2 million\u2014nearly 1.2 million more than the number of unemployed.\n\nThis is great news for employees, as it\u2019s putting upward pressure on wages. Through August, year-over-year wage growth has met or exceeded 3% for 13 consecutive months. A worker with a 40-hour-a-week job making the average hourly wage from August 2017 (when it was $22.11) through August 2019 ($23.59) would have seen an annual salary increase from about $44,000 to $47,000.\n\nLast week the Census Bureau reported that the poverty rate fell 0.5 percentage point in 2018 to 11.8%, the lowest level since 2001. Contrary to Sen. Elizabeth Warren \u2019s insistence that the economic boom benefits only \u201ca thinner and thinner slice at the top,\u201d inequality has fallen as incomes rise. The share of income earned by the top 20% fell in 2018 more than it has in a decade, while those in the 20th to 40th percentile\u2014the second-lowest income quintile\u2014\u201cexperienced the largest increase in average household income among all quintiles\u201d at 2.5%, according to the White House Council of Economic Advisers.\n\nHeightened competition for employees is improving economic circumstances for working Americans better than any government program or mandate ever could. But for the tight labor market to persist, the economy must continue growing. Paradoxically, if economic growth is to continue driving the current demand for workers, at some point the economy will need more workers to meet that demand.\n\nThat means job training is increasingly important, particularly for discouraged workers who want to re-enter the labor force. The Trump administration has taken action such as encouraging companies to make training available, but with congressional support more can be done. Higher levels of merit-based legal immigration\u2014as opposed to immigration based on distant family connections\u2014could also relieve some of the pressure.\n\nBoth business owners and jobs data tell us the same thing: To sustain the recovery, the U.S. needs more workers.\n\nMr. Puzder is a former CEO of CKE Restaurants and author of \u201cThe Capitalist Comeback: The Trump Boom and the Left\u2019s Plot to Stop It.\u201d", "description": "A lack of qualified workers boosts wages but makes it hard for businesses to expand.", "authors": ["Andy Puzder"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-108071/social", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
