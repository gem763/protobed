The deal is a great deal.\u201d\n\nPart of the problem with the Republican\u2019s boast is that the framework of the agreement may be \u201cgreat,\u201d but not for the United States. The Wall Street Journal published an interesting report the other day, noting that it was China that \u201cemerged with wins\u201d from the trade talks.\n\nThe other part of the problem, as the Associated Press reported, is that the trade deal Trump is so excited about doesn\u2019t actually exist, at least not yet.\n\n[N]egotiators reached their tentative agreement only in principle. No documents have been signed. A final deal could still fall through, though Trump told reporters Friday he didn\u2019t think that would happen. Many of the details remained to be worked out. Some of the thorniest issues \u2013 such as U.S. allegations that China forces foreign companies to hand over trade secrets \u2013 were dealt with only partially, or not at all, and will require further talks. \u201cThe president is acting as if a lot of Chinese concessions have been nailed down, and they just haven\u2019t,\u201d said Derek Scissors, a China specialist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.\n\nA separate AP report added that despite Trump\u2019s rhetoric, \u201ccloser inspection suggests there isn\u2019t much substance\u201d to the announced agreement. Scott Kennedy, who analyzes China\u2019s economy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, added that Friday\u2019s announcement was \u201ca nothing-burger,\u201d adding, \u201cI call it the \u2018Invisible Deal.\u2019\u2026 The only thing that happened Friday was that the U.S. delayed the tariff increase.\u201d\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin conceded yesterday that the deal needs \u201ca lot of work,\u201d and Beijing hasn\u2019t even acknowledged the existence of an agreement.\n\nInstead, as CNBC reported yesterday, China is looking for \u201canother round of talks\u201d before it agrees to move forward with the agreement Trump touted late last week \u2013 which further reinforces the fact that there is no deal in place.\n\nIf you believed the American president\u2019s rhetoric on this, I have some bad news for you.", "description": "If you believed Trump's rhetoric about his \"great\" and \"big\" new trade deal with China, I have some bad news for you.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/ap_947666193006.jpg?itok=ZC7D452q", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
