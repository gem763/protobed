People hosting these experiences have to comply with Airbnb's animal welfare policy, head of Animal Experiences Mikel Freemon told Business Insider.\n\nAirbnb worked with The Dodo, a Group Nine Media brand that tells stories about animals and has shown dedication to animal welfare, to design 50 of the experiences.\n\n'It's like meeting a celebrity': The Dodo teams up with the stars of their viral videos to curate Animal Experiences\n\nThe Dodo helped Airbnb put together activities that are enjoyable for guests and humane for the animals, Dodo president YuJung Kim said.\n\nIt wasn't easy, though, since cats tend to be indoor creatures. In the case of Nala, her owner came up with the idea of having guests visit Nala's kitchen, the California factory where her cat food line called Love, Nala is made. Guests can meet Nala, watch her sample her pet food, get selfies of her and take home gift bags for their own cats.\n\nPenni Dog, the pitbull who stars in The Dodo series \"Pittie Nation\" and has over 47,000 followers on Instagram, presented the opposite problem: A former rescue dog, she prefers outdoor activities like rock climbing and ziplining, so the solution was to offer Airbnb guests a hike to one of her favorite hot springs in Nevada.\n\n\"When her human dad adopted her she was very scared,\" Kim said. \"She had been through a lot and was generally very introverted and very skittish, so as a way of making her feel more confident they started going on hikes together.\"\n\nOther Dodo-designed Animal Experiences for Airbnb are a picnic with pig and dog duo Pickles and Dill who have 100,000 Instagram followers; a safari with cow Brianna who once survived a fall from a transport truck while pregnant; and a day filled with nine rescue dogs inspired by The Dodo series \"Ruff Life with Lee Asher.\"\n\nThe animal experiences cost guests an extra $50 to $150 per person. The companies share revenue from the trips.", "description": "Airbnb worked with The Dodo, a Group Nine Media brand, to combine travel and adventures with animals that have become social stars.", "authors": ["Alyssa Meyers"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db709d5dee0195d50748cb6?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
