The theme this year is \u201cAfrica in motion\u201d.\n\nAlso on the agenda is the growth of the digital revolution sweeping through the continent, including tech start-ups and the role these start-ups play in helping to solve problems in the economies across the continent.\n\nIn his weekly Monday newsletter, Ramaphosa said that the summit was \u201cimportant for the work we are doing to improve the lives of our people\u201d.\n\n\u201cTo attract investment, we need to make it easier to do business in South Africa. In a competitive global environment, investors are looking for countries that can provide stable and sustained returns, while minimising the risks and cost,\u201d Ramaphosa said.\n\nAmong some of the leaders and executives who are attending the summit are the vice-president of Ghana Mahamudu Bawumia, chief executive of Transnet International Holdings Petrus Fusi, chief economist at Africa Standard Chartered Bank Razia Khan and chairperson of Remgro Limited Johann Rupert.\n\nRamaphosa took heed of the opportunities that are presented through the use of technology and said that some of the innovations currently under way in South Africa include the ability for visitors to the country to apply for an e-visa online.\n\n\u201cI recently signed a law to establish an electronic deeds registration system that will improve turnaround times, enhance accuracy and make information more readily available.\u201d\n\nRamaphosa also addressed the struggles that are faced by entrepreneurs when it comes to securing funding, and said in his newsletter that entrepreneurs \u201cfind it difficult to and costly to meet the regulatory requirements for starting and running a business.\u201d\n\nSome of the interventions which have been introduced by government to make it easier for entrepreneurs to conduct business, Ramaphosa said, includes \u201cmaking it easier to start a business, register a property, deal with construction permits, pay taxes and trade across borders.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are working with business to ensure that the conditions attached to licences are not too onerous or costly. We have prioritised immigration reform to attract more skilled workers and to grow tourism,\u201d Ramaphosa said.\n\nNext month, South Africa will host the second South Africa Investment Conference as part of Ramaphosa\u2019s drive to attract R1.2 trillion in new investment over the next five years.\n\nAt last year\u2019s conference, about R300 billion in committed investments was raised, \u201cbut we know that we need far-reaching reforms to achieve our target,\u201d Ramaphosa said.", "description": "President Cyril Ramaphosa is in London for the annual Financial Times Africa Summit.", "authors": ["Staff Reporter"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7928/84ecc6cc4eca47d0a9437834d13f5db0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
