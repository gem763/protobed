ESPN first reported Brees' updated status for Sunday.\n\nTeddy Bridgewater has started the past five games, all victories.\n\nBrees injured his thumb in the first half of New Orleans' Week 2 loss to the Rams in Los Angeles when his hand jammed against the extended arm of defensive lineman Aaron Donald on the follow-through of a throw.\n\nSurgery on Brees' ulnar collateral ligament was performed in Los Angeles on Sept. 18 and he began throwing a regulation NFL football about two weeks ago.\n\nBrees is the NFL's all-time leader in yards passing with 74,845 and completions with 6,621. He had passed for 408 yards and two TDs in about five quarters of play this season before his injury.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
