Co-payments are gone. Deductibles are gone. All out-of-pocket expenses are gone. We\u2019re going to do better than the Canadians do, and that is what they have managed to do. At the end of the day, the overwhelming majority of people will save money on their healthcare bills. But I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up.
