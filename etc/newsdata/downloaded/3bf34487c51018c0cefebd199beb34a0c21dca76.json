You may think I\u2019m being hyperbolic when I call it \u201cmagnificent,\u201d but I assure you, all other praise falls short. When you combine duck fat with butter and whip the heck out of it, you get a creamy, glossy spread that is best described as \u201cduck frosting.\u201d\n\nWhat is duck frosting good on? Cornbread muffins, corn that is not in muffins, and popcorn. It\u2019s also delicious on foods that aren\u2019t corn, like all bread. You can fry eggs in it, spread it on waffles, or swirl it into pasta. You can mash it into potatoes. Have I dipped saltines in it? Yes. Did I really enjoy the experience? Also yes.\n\nAs I mentioned up top, a lot of whipping is required. You\u2019ll also want to make sure both of your fats are completely at room temperature, otherwise you\u2019ll get little bits of butter suspended in duck fat, which will feel greasy \u2014 not luxurious \u2014 in your mouth. To make duck frosting, you will need:\n\n2 sticks room temperature high-quality salted butter (if you only have unsalted, add 1/2 a teaspoon of salt)\n\n1/3 cup room temperature rendered duck fat (You can buy this from your butcher or render it yourself.)\n\nCut the butter into 16 cubes (eight from each stick) and chuck \u2018em in the bowl of your stand mixer, along with the duck fat. Using the whisk attachment, beat the fats on high, scraping down the sides as needed, until the butter lightens in colour and you have a fluffy, smooth, glossy spread. Smear it artistically on a plate, garnish with a few thyme leaves, and enjoy your favourite carbohydrate.", "description": "Duck fat and butter are my two favourite fats, so it\u2019s mighty perplexing to me that \u2014 until today \u2014 I had never combined them into one magnificent spread.
