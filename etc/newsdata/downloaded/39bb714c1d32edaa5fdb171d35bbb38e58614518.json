However, on the Pixel 4 for some strange reason the 90Hz refresh rate is only applicable during high-brightness modes. It doesn't work if the brightness is lowered below 75%, which is shocking. While Google has stated that this will be fixed in future updates, it is sad to see that this half-baked feature slipped through Google's quality check.\n\nOutdated hardware\n\nPixel 4 is rocking Qualcomm's Snapdragon 855 octa-core processor paired with 6GB of RAM. While the processor is no slouch, we already have phones rocking Snapdragon 855 Plus which is faster and newer in comparison. Also, 6GB RAM on a phone is so 2016. I wouldn't be surprised if this phone will face a similar fate as all Pixel devices have in the past.\n\nDon't Miss 4.5 K SHARES 647 SHARES 17.4 K SHARES 123 SHARES\n\nGoogle\n\nInsecure face unlock\n\nThe face unlock on the Pixel 4 was supposed to be its strongest feature with Project Soli, and while it does make it the fastest face-unlock feature, it also makes it the most insecure. The face unlock can be fooled by a twin or a looklike (even Google admits this). Moreover, one can even unlock the phone with the eyes are closed, which is just bad.\n\nIncomplete camera arsenal\n\nPixel surprised people with a dual-camera setup at the back, however, this surprise was shortlived when many found that it was a telephoto shooter instead of the much-loved ultrawide. Moreover, the device clearly lacks 4K 60fps video capture, something its competition truly flaunts. And this year's iPhone 11 Pro has truly nailed its camera with not just an additional ultra-wide sensor but also 4K 60fps video capture, making the camera arsenal on the Pixel 4 unequipped for the battle.\n\nGoogle\n\nNo unlimited storage at original quality\n\nOne of the coolest reasons to pick a Pixel, apart from the amazing camera hardware was the fact that it offered unlimited storage of photos and videos on Google Photos on the best quality -- something that would otherwise be chargeable for other Android users. However, Google stops this trend with the Pixel 4's, and only uploading images in high-quality like other droids, whereas iPhones still get original quality uploads on Google Photos with its HEIC image format.\n\nAbysmal battery\n\nPixel 4 comes loaded with a 2800mAh battery whereas the Pixel 4XL gets a slightly better 3700mAh battery. Both the phones have 90Hz high-refresh-rate display. As per reviews by global publications, Pixel 4XL manages to survive the day, however, the 2800mAh on the Pixel 4 barely manages to do so.\n\nGimmicky radar feature that doesn't work perfectly\n\nIt's also sad that one of the most touted Pixel 4 features -- it's radar based gesture recognition tech -- happens to be the only reason the phone isn't launching in India, as we previously reported. And adding insult to injury, the feature doesn't seem to work 100% most of the times, which is a shame.\n\nObviously, the script for Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL has gone horribly wrong for Google, and in a year where Apple seriously made the iPhone worthy again (with the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max), Google will have to wait another year to seriously compete with Apple in the flagship smartphone race again.", "description": "Pixel 4 (and Pixel 4XL) was unveiled to the world last week, on October 15th and while the leaks gave us so much about the device before the unveiling, we still were looking forward to the launch, only to be disappointed. And this trend continued throughout the week as shortcomings for the device were discovered by people over the time they got to use it.", "authors": ["Monit Khanna"], "top_image": "https://media.indiatimes.in/media/facebook/2019/Oct/google_1571988687_800x420.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
