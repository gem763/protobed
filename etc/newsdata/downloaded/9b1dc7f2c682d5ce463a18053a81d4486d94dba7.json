Personal-finance site GoBankingRates released an analysis on Thursday of cities where the average Social Security check (roughly $1,350 a month) would easily cover the median rent in town (see the full list of 25 cities, all with rents under $1,000 a month, below).\n\nTo create this list, GoBankingRates analyzed the median rents from January through May of this year for single-family residences in the 300 largest cities in terms of population in the U.S. MarketWatch highlights four compelling cities on this list that you may want to consider.\n\nFor the foodie: Memphis, Tenn.\n\nThis charming southern town has far more to offer than Graceland (though Elvis\u2019s former home is spectacular) \u2014 including top-notch food and entertainment. Food & Wine magazine recently wrote of Memphis: \u201cFrom the indie music scene to the makers and artisans, the craft brewing community and the food culture here will render obsolete whatever you thought you knew about the place.\u201d And Southern Living magazine praised the food scene, too, noting that it offers \u201cribs so good they don\u2019t need any sauce.\u201d Rent, on average, is about $893.\n\nFor those looking for a college town: South Bend, Ind.\n\nThe fourth biggest city in Indiana, home to the University of Notre Dame, has also been in the news of late as the dominion of Mayor Pete Buttigieg, the Democratic presidential hopeful. With more than 300,000 residents in the South Bend\u2013Mishawaka metro area, plenty is on offer for retirees to see and do. There are two major performance centers \u2014 the Morris Performing Arts Center and Notre Dame\u2019s DeBartolo Performing Arts Center \u2014 and you can drive to the shores of Lake Michigan in about an hour. Even better, the median rent is only about $768, so you\u2019ll have a chunk of change left over to enjoy traveling and more.\n\nFor the history buff: Springfield, Ill.\n\nThe capital of Illinois is ideal for history buffs, as it was once the home to Abraham Lincoln and now offers a plethora of Lincoln-related attractions and activities. These include the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Museum and the History Comes Alive festival in the summer, which lets you step \u201cback in time to the Springfield that Abraham Lincoln knew before he became president.\u201d You can also explore Route 66 and the Frank Lloyd Wright\u2013designed Dana-Thomas House. Median rent in Springfield is roughly $870 a month.\n\nFor the outdoorsy retiree: Columbus, Ga.\n\nThis riverfront town \u2014 it\u2019s on the Chattahoochee River bordering Alabama \u2014 offers lots for an outdoorsy retiree to do, including the largest urban whitewater course in the world. Birding, biking and kayaking are big here. Plus, along the waterfront, you\u2019ll find shops, restaurants, entertainment options including free concerts, and a farmers and makers market. The median rent here is about $840 a month.\n\nThe 25 cities where your Security Security check will easily cover rent\n\n\n\n25. Augusta, Ga.: 2019 median monthly rentt of $923\n\n24.
