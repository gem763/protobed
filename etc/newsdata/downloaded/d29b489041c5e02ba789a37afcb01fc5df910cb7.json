Up to 24 Vietnamese families have since reported missing relatives whom they fear to be among the dead.\n\nVietnamese authorities have taken hair and other forensic samples from families who have reported missing people to assist the identification efforts.\n\nBritish police said they have removed all the bodies from the truck and are awaiting autopsies. Identifying the victims is expected to be difficult and officials said very few documents were found with the bodies.\n\nBritish Ambassador Gareth Ward said he met with Vietnamese officials on Monday to discuss cooperation in the identification process.\n\nWard said in a statement that he told Vietnam\u2019s Ministry of Public Security that Britain still has not confirmed the victims\u2019 identities or nationalities.\n\nSmugglers normally take the passports of their passengers to obscure their identities, stripping them of their names and giving them new documents when they arrive at their destinations.\n\nFamilies in central Vietnam continue to cling to hope that their missing loved ones are not among the victims.\n\nIn Diem Thinh village in Nghe An province, Hoang Thi Ai cried Monday as she received relatives and neighbors coming to her house to check on the latest news on her missing 18-year-old son, Hoang Van Tiep, who the family fears may be among the victims.\n\nTiep worked as a restaurant dishwasher in France for two years before deciding to go to England for a better-paying job at a nail salon, Ai said.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said China has asked British authorities to provide more information on the identity of the victims in what British officials have called one of the country\u2019s deadliest cases of human smuggling.\n\nGeng also said Monday that reports that the victims had Chinese passports was \u201cspeculation.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s Assistant Foreign Minister Chen Xiaodong said the case shows that illegal immigration is a global issue.\n\n\u201cIt needs to be jointly dealt with and properly resolved by all parties concerned so that we can prevent a tragedy like this from repeating in the future,\u201d Chen said at a news conference in Beijing.\n\nBritish authorities charged the 25-year-old truck driver with 39 counts of manslaughter and conspiracy to traffic people. He was expected in court Monday. Three other people have been arrested in connection to the case.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Yanan Wang in Beijing contributed to this report.", "description": "DIEM THINH, Vietnam (AP) \u2014 Vietnam's government said Monday that it has received from British authorities documents on four of the people found dead in", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/28/70d741_vietnam-43025-vietnam-missing-hoang-thi-ai-holds-up-her-phone-showing-photo-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
