Elton told NPR he admired her stance after she was called out for being chummy with former President George W. Bush. In fact, he went even further and found something positive to say about President Trump:\n\n\u201cI admire Ellen for standing up and saying what she said,\u201d said John, in response to recent criticisms of Ellen DeGeneres, who sat with former president George Bush at a football game and later commented that she has friend who don\u2019t necessarily share the same beliefs as she has. \u201cGeorge Bush has made a lot of mistakes. I made a lot of mistakes. Ellen DeGeneres has made a lot of mistakes,\u201d said John. \u201cPeople need to come together [\u2026] They need to respect people\u2019s view on life. Except when it\u2019s heresy, and I don\u2019t think George Bush is that kind of guy.\u201d And while he shied away from diving too deeply into his opinions on American politics (claiming that England has enough problems of its own at the moment), he noted that President Trump has kept PEPFAR \u2014 the President George W. Bush-era emergency plan for AIDS relief \u2014 \u201cso that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d\n\nIn case you missed the backstory, last week people on the left freaked out over the shocking news that Ellen DeGeneres sat next to former President George W. Bush at a football game. After being condemned for looking to chummy with the ex-president, DeGeneres responded on her show with a plea for civility.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all different and I think that we\u2019ve forgotten that that\u2019s okay that we\u2019re all different\u2026 but just because I don\u2019t agree with someone on everything doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m not going to be friends with them,\u201d DeGeneres said. She added, \u201cWhen I say, \u2018Be kind to one another,\u2019 I don\u2019t mean only the people that think the same way that you do. I mean be kind to everyone. Doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nFrom what I saw online, there was a mostly positive response from right and left, though of course there were exceptions among far-left actors:\n\n\u201cBut missing the point entirely, DeGeneres framed the issue as simply a matter of her hanging out with someone with different opinions, not a man repeatedly accused of being a war criminal.\u201d https://t.co/OCyYEfNRQl \u2014 Susan Sarandon (@SusanSarandon) October 8, 2019\n\nSorry, until George W. Bush is brought to justice for the crimes of the Iraq War, (including American-lead torture, Iraqi deaths & displacement, and the deep scars\u2014emotional & otherwise\u2014inflicted on our military that served his folly), we can\u2019t even begin to talk about kindness. https://t.co/dpMwfck6su \u2014 Mark Ruffalo (@MarkRuffalo) October 9, 2019\n\nVox noted there were also quite a few rebuttals of Ellen from progressive news sites:\n\n\u201cBeing nice to Bush means in turn disrespecting those whose lives were destroyed by his disastrous administration,\u201d wrote Naomi LaChance at Splinter News. \u201cYou literally cannot be kind to everyone. You have to choose a side! Ellen certainly has.\u201d \u201cDeGeneres betrays her political significance as an openly gay entertainer and a prominent LGBTQ advocate through her friendship with Bush,\u201d wrote Justin Charity at the Ringer. \u201cWhen one person has historically believed other people should not have the same basic rights as another, it\u2019s hard to treat these differences as benign\u2014especially when that person once exercised their power to help make their beliefs a reality,\u201d wrote Laura Bradley at Vanity Fair.\n\nNaturally, Vox concludes Ellen might be wrong:\n\nThe debate over Ellen\u2019s niceness as an entertainer and celebrity is a close cousin to the \u201ccivility\u201d debate that periodically roils the political world: the question of whether it is politically more effective for the left to \u201cbe civil\u201d to members of the Trump administration, or whether publicly confronting some of those members \u2014 like Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who was denied service at a restaurant in an act of political protest in 2018 \u2014 might perhaps be the morally correct and politically viable way to go. And while calls for civility remain prevalent, it\u2019s no longer considered inarguably correct that civility always wins.\n\nPersonally, I think civility is usually the best course and I don\u2019t think we should decide people can\u2019t be our friends because they have different political views. That said, there are definitely moments when it\u2019s tempting to put together a long string of four-letter words and let someone have it. But it\u2019s best to resist that urge.\n\nAs for Elton John, I suspect he\u2019ll get some backlash for this but what does he care. He\u2019s 72, he\u2019s very rich, world-famous, and his music still plays on the radio every day around the world. There\u2019s not much the woke scolds can do to him at this point.", "description": "\"They need to respect people's view on life.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Elton-John.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
