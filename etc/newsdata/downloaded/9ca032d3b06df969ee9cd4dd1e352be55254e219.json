Any restaurant that was closed was red.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re across any area that\u2019s got Waffle Houses after a big storm they\u2019re generally going to be the first ones open and the last ones to close,\u201d Fugate said.\n\nWaffle House has about 340 locations in Florida, with the heaviest concentration in the Orlando, Daytona and Jacksonville areas. The restaurant chain says it expects locations throughout the state to be impacted in one way or another.\n\n\u201cRight now we\u2019ve activated our storm center so we are mainly tracking the storm and positioning some resources, but still it\u2019s kind of early because I don\u2019t think anyone has a good grasp on where the storm is going to go,\u201d said Pat Warner, director of PR and External Affairs at Waffle House.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in contact with our Federal, State and local partners and when the evacuations are in effect that\u2019s when we will shut them down,\u201d Warner said.\n\nFugate has a tip for anyone in Dorian\u2019s path.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to leave your area, make sure you have a destination and a place to go before you leave,\u201d he said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to a hotel or a motel, make sure you have a reservation or you may end up driving a lot further than you anticipated because things will fill up quickly as people start evacuating.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Jonathan Garber"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/02/0/0/waffle-house.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
