Property prices in this oil town are soaring and restaurants are struggling to find staff who can afford to live there.\n\nThe bonus for realtors is a booming market where oil money is priming the pump for house and ranch sales and creating a new market for $1 million-plus pads that are being snapped up by oil industry executives.\n\n\u201cSix years ago, we didn't have a million-dollar home in Midland\u2014now we have maybe 13 of them listed for sale,\u201d said Skeet Doss, the owner of The Doss Team.\n\nTexan towns like Midland and nearby Odessa are located in the heart of the Permian Basin, an area of 86,000 square miles extending from western Texas into southeastern New Mexico. The Permian has upended the global energy market by flooding the world with shale oil over the last decade and forcing the OPEC oil cartel to cut its own production in an attempt to support the price of the precious commodity.\n\nThe U.S. Energy Information Administration has forecast that oil output in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico will hit an all-time high in September.\n\nFor Midlanders, the shale oil boom is both a blessing and a curse, providing almost full employment for those who can afford to live there, but draining schools, hospitals and other vital services of staff. Residents there have either left service jobs to work in oil and gas or have moved out of the area because they could no longer afford to live there. Yet such severe shortages have not dented demand for luxury homes because this is oil country and it is where the work is from roughneck to executive.\n\nMore: The Smarter Way to Clean Your Home\n\n\u201cIf you go out to eat, you often see that half the tables have been blocked off because they don\u2019t have anyone to wait on them,\u201d Mr. Doss said, adding that schools and hospitals have also been impacted as well as other sectors.\n\n\u201cHousebuilders have told us they\u2019ve gone out to check on their workers to find them gone because the oil guys have come in and hired them all,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe do not have a broad spectrum of industries in Midland, Texas. We have one industry and it is called oil.\u201d\n\nThe 2019 Global Energy Talent Index also highlights the looming talent crisis in the Permian.\n\n\u201cRapid growth and increased competition has created a massive talent shortfall,\u201d said the report. \u201cCompanies are struggling to fill their workforce needs. Even higher salaries aren\u2019t attracting the professionals needed.\u201d\n\nThe Texas Workforce Commission did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nDespite skills shortages in the service and public sector, demand for luxury homes is strong, according to Mr. Doss.\n\n\u201cOil owners and professionals of all areas have seen the ups and downs of the oil field,\u201d he said. \u201cPrices are still quite attractive even in the upper tier compared to other cities. The availability of private clubs and fabulous private schools make these properties even more attractive to people who can afford them.\u201d\n\nRegeneration\n\nMidland has seen the highs and lows of the energy industry. While the oil has always been there, the fracking technology to extract it is relatively new\u2014allowing exploration companies to tap the reserves trapped in layers of shale previously deemed unreachable or commercially unviable.\n\nToday, energy industry executives are flooding into the town, many of them working on vital new pipelines that will allow the region\u2019s vast reserves to be pumped to refineries and ports much quicker than ever before.\n\nIn the old town center, many buildings stood derelict for decades after the collapse of oil prices in the early 1980s. Today, however, oil is still the lifeblood of the Texan economy. Now many of Midland\u2019s old buildings are being demolished to make way for luxurious homes targeted for the titans of the shale era.\n\nThe oil boom is underpinning the performance of the property market throughout swathes of the Lone Star State.\n\nTwo of the top five-best performing property locations in the U.S. are in the oil- producing regions of Texas, according to a report published in July from SmartAsset, a financial advice website. Midland was No. 2 after Boulder, Colorado, while Austin came in at No. 3. Houston, meanwhile, the capital of the U.S. energy industry, ranked ninth.\n\nMore: Munich Ranks as Most Overvalued Global Market, at Risk of Bubble\n\nSmartAsset determined these rankings by comparing home value data for every quarter from the first quarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of 2018. House prices in Texas, as a whole, grew about 2.9% in the second quarter compared to a year earlier, according to data from the Texas Association of Realtors. Midland prices were up 5.1%, while in Odessa, just 20 miles away, prices rose 14% over the same period.\n\nRustic Charm\n\nMany of the luxury properties listed for sale in the Permian boom towns are a combination of the palatial and the agricultural\u2014with luxurious d\u00e9cor and creature comforts inside and more practical barns, stables and garages outside.\n\nSome of these are marketed by Trower Realtors, which is run by one of the longest-serving realtors in Texas, 83-year-old Virgil Trower.\n\nHe said that while many of the big earners in the oil and gas industry still prefer the major cities of Houston and Dallas, demand is also strong in Odessa, with many choosing to build from scratch.\n\n\u201cThey want to build it like they want it,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the new style is outdoor kitchens and swimming pools with waterfalls and big metal shops where they can put all their four wheelers and RVs. That\u2019s a big trend right now.\u201d\n\nThe influx of executives is also helping to drive ranch sales.\n\n\u201cI just listed one north of Odessa. It\u2019s 35 acres. It\u2019s got a pine fence all the way around it and the house is something like 14,000 square feet with an 8,000-square-foot barn, seven horse stalls and paved roads all the way through it. It\u2019s just beautiful. They want $2.5 million for it,\u201d Mr. Trower said.\n\nMore: A Guide to the Season\u2019s New Developments\n\nHe got his broker\u2019s license in 1971, and has been selling homes in Odessa all the way back to the oil crisis of the early part of that decade through the boom years that followed in the late 1970s to the crash of the late 1990s and the pre-financial crisis peak of $130-a-barrel oil in the summer of 2008.\n\nWith oil currently trading at below $55 as of Oct. 1 and with a bearish outlook, that has not stopped the march of major shale oil production companies, spreading out from Midland and Odessa to other emerging towns such as Monahans and nearby Pecos, a town where the population has doubled in the last two years, according to Mr. Trower.\n\nOil Wealth Spreads Among Cities\n\nThe new Permian oil wealth is not just benefiting high-end property sales in the big oil towns, but it is also trickling down to the holiday home market in other parts of Texas and New Mexico, such as the picturesque village of Ruidoso in the Sierra Blanca mountain range some 280 miles away from Midland, where there isn\u2019t a drill rig to be seen among the pine forests and trout streams.\n\n\u201cBuyers from the oil towns\u2014Midland, Odessa, Carlsbad, Dallas, Amarillo\u2014all look in that area for second homes to escape from the summer heat and to enjoy winter skiing,\u201d said Sandy Messer, an El-Paso-based broker.\n\nMany of the premium homes on the market here have been built in the last six years, coinciding with the shale oil boom years. There is no shortage of space, with the new-build homes typically sitting on large plots with Spanish architectural influences such as stone walls and terracotta roof tiling.\n\nColdwell Banker is marketing a seven-bedroom home on Warwick Drive with 6,500 square feet of living space and sitting on 6.4 acres for $1.4 million. With views over the mountains and surrounding forests, it is a world away from the plains of west Texas.\n\nVolatility\n\nToday, the Permian Basin has become the key battleground for global energy dominance as shale oil producers pump more while OPEC, dominated by the Persian Gulf oil exporters, pumps less, in an effort to support the price of the precious commodity that their economies rely on.\n\nTo be sure, the prosperity of Permian is not guaranteed, even if it feels that way in these rapidly expanding boom towns. In recent months, the share price of some producers have tumbled amid pressure from investors to reduce spending and produce better returns.\n\nFrom Penta A Lamborghini Veneno Sells for Record US$8.27 Million\n\nAt the same time, weakening global demand could send oil prices tumbling below the figure shale oil operators need to break even\u2014with rapidly growing production from the Permian contributing to the oversupply.\n\nIn the meantime, luxury and industry will co-exist in symbiotic harmony here.\n\nLocal real estate brokers are defiantly proud of the area\u2019s heritage and character\u2014even if it sometimes comes with the smell of gas as well as the sight of it being burned off at the wellhead.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like if you're living on the coast, you see boats and ships\u2014here you see oil wells,\u201d Mr. Doss said. \u201cNobody cares too much about that\u2014it\u2019s what we do.\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Sean Cronin"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-112613?size=1.4988290398126465&width=1280", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
