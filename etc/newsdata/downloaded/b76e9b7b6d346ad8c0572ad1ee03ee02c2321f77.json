I say it again: if you try to frame our operation there as an invasion, our task is simple: we will open the doors and send 3.6 million migrants to you,' Erdogan said in a speech to parliament in Ankara on Thursday\n\nKurds said they were resisting the assault. At least 23 fighters with the SDF and six fighters with a Turkish-backed Syrian rebel group had been killed, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the war.\n\nNATO member Turkey says the operation is necessary for border security against the YPG militia, which it designates a terrorist group because of ties to militants who have waged a decades-old insurgency in southeast Turkey in which more than 40,000 people have been killed.\n\nAnkara has also said it intends to create a 'safe zone' for the return of millions of refugees to Syria.\n\nThe SDF have been the main allies of U.S. forces on the ground in the battle against Islamic State since 2014. They have been holding thousands of captured IS fighters in prisons and tens of thousands of their relatives in detention.\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian called for an emergency meeting of the coalition of more than 30 countries created to fight Islamic State.\n\nSDF forces were still in control of all prisons with Islamic State captives, a senior U.S. State Department official said in a briefing with reporters on Thursday.\n\nThe United States has received a high-level commitment from Turkey on taking responsibility for Islamic State captives but had not yet had detailed discussions, the official said.\n\nU.S. lawmakers have said Trump gave Erdogan the green light to go into Syria but the official disputed that. 'We gave them a very clear red light, I've been involved in those red lights and I know the president did that on Sunday,' the official said.\n\nThe SDF said Turkish air strikes and shelling had killed nine civilians.

A Syrian rebel forces spokesman said the towns were surrounded after fighters seized the villages around them.\n\nTrump has faced rare criticism from senior figures in his Republican Party who accuse him of deserting U.S. allies.\n\nU.S. Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican who usually backs Trump, has been one of the most outspoken critics of the U.S. troop withdrawal.

Turkish officials said the Kurdish militia has fired dozens of mortars into Turkish border towns the past two days, including Akcakale.\n\nTurkish officials said a nine-month-old and a civil servant were killed by mortars striking towns inside Turkey.\n\nOn the Syrian side, seven civilians and eight Kurdish fighters have been killed since the operation began, according to activists in Syria.\n\nThis morning Turkey-backed Syrian rebel fighters were cheered as they rolled towards the border in armoured vehicles, heading for battlefronts where Kurdish fighters have dug in.\n\nThe Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) - formerly a key US ally in the fight against ISIS - said Turkish warplanes had caused 'huge panic' when they attacked the Kurdish-held territory, and claimed the bombardments had killed and wounded civilians.\n\nSDF spokesman Mustafa Bali said on Twitter: 'Turkish warplanes have started to carry out air strikes on civilian areas.'\n\nPictures and video footage from the ground appeared to show civilians desperately fleeing the area as clouds of smoke rose from the positions targeted by Turkish jets.\n\nThere were signs of terror in the streets of Ras al-Ayn- one of the Syrian towns under attack with residential areas close to the border.\n\nNear the town of Qamishli, plumes of smoke rose from an area close to the border after activists reported explosions nearby.\n\nBali reported this morning that the SDF had repelled Turkish forces ground attacks.

Turkey views the 30million or so Kurds living inside its borders and in neighbouring Syria and Iraq as a potential threat to its unity\n\nThe Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor that has activists throughout the country, said Turkish troops tried to push ahead on several fronts under the cover of airstrikes and artillery shelling but made no tangible progress.\n\nThe Observatory said that since Turkey began its operation, seven civilians have been killed.\n\nCNN Turk broadcast video showing a crane overnight removing a concrete block from the border wall and commandos moving in single-file alongside the barrier.\n\nIn the Turkish border town of Akcakale, around 30 vehicles carrying Syrian rebels, many pick-up trucks mounted with anti-aircraft machines drove along the main road along the Turkish side of the border from Syria's Tel Abyad.\n\nThey were accompanied by some 10 Turkish military armoured vehicles. It was not clear where they were heading.

I have to say if the Turkish plan involves the creation of a so-called safe zone, don't expect the European Union to pay for any of it.' NATO NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Wednesday Turkey had 'legitimate security concerns' and had informed NATO about its attack against Kurdish fighters in Syria. 'I count on Turkey to act with restraint and ensure that any action it may take in northern Syria is proportionate and measured,' he said after meeting Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. 'It is important to avoid actions that may further destabilise the region, escalate tensions and cause more human suffering.' Israel Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned Turkey's actions and warned of an 'ethnic cleansing' against the Kurds. He said Israel is prepared to extend humanitarian assistance to the 'gallant Kurdish people.' Germany German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said Turkey's operation would lead to further destabilisation of the region and could strengthen Islamic State. He urged Turkey to end the operation. France France's European affairs minister Amelie de Montchalin said France and Britain would call a U.N. Security Council meeting over the Turkish offensive. France, Germany and Britain are finalising a joint statement condemning the advance. Italy Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said the operation risked destabilising the region and harming civilians. Denmark Danish Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod tweeted: 'Deeply concerned about Turkish military operation in Syria. In my view, this is a regrettable and wrong decision, which can have serious consequences for civilians and the fight against ISIL (Islamic State).' Russia Russian President Vladimir Putin urged his Turkish counterpart President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to 'think carefully' before taking any action. Erdogan for his part told Putin that the offensive 'will contribute to Syria's peace and stability and ease the path to a political solution'. Netherlands 'I call on Turkey not to follow the path it has chosen,' Dutch foreign minister Stef Blok said. 'No one can benefit from the potentially terrible humanitarian consequences. The operation can trigger new refugee flows and harm the fight against IS and stability in the region.' UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said he had 'serious concerns' about Turkey's military action. He said: 'This risks destabilising the region, exacerbating humanitarian suffering, and undermining the progress made against Daesh which should be our collective focus.' Iran Iran on Thursday called for an 'immediate halt' to the Turkish Syria offensive. India India's foreign ministry issued a press release Thursday saying it is 'deeply concerned at the unilateral military offensive by Turkey in north-east Syria.' It cautioned that Turkey's actions can undermine stability in the region and the fight against terrorism. Its action also has the potential for causing humanitarian and civilian distress.\n\nThe Turkish border town of Akcakale was quiet for much of the morning after sporadic gunfire and the sound of tank movement were heard in the early hours, Reuters journalists said. Explosions just over the border had rocked the town of Tel Abyad earlier in the night, they said.\n\nTurkey regards the Kurdish militia as a terrorist group because of its links to Kurdish PKK militants waging a decades-old insurgency in southeast Turkey.\n\nTroops have entered Syria at four points, two of them close to Tel Abyad and two close to Ras al Ain further east, according to Turkish media reports. Air strikes killed at least five civilians and three SDF fighters, while dozens of civilians were wounded, the SDF said. Thousands of people fled Ras al Ain towards Hasaka province, held by the SDF.\n\nSDF spokesman Mustafa Bali said the group's fighters had repelled a ground attack by Turkish troops in Tel Abyad.\n\nTanks and troops had been massing on the border since Trump announced that American troops would step aside.\n\nHours after the assault was launched, President Trump tweeted that US troops should 'never have been' in the Middle East in the first place.\n\nIn Damascus, Syria's deputy foreign minister Faisal Mekdad warned that the Assad government 'will defend all Syrian territory and will not accept any occupation of any land or iota of the Syrian soil'.\n\nEarlier, Turkish television reports said Turkish jets had bombed Syrian Kurdish positions across the border from Turkey.\n\nIn the face of the onslaught, Kurdish authorities announced a general mobilisation, urging all civilians to 'head to the border with Turkey... to resist during this delicate historical moment'.\n\nKurdish leaders said they would hold their erstwhile US ally and the whole international community responsible for any 'humanitarian catastrophe'.\n\nIn Ras al-Ain, Kurdish-led security forces set up checkpoints and stockpiled tyres to set alight to blur the vision of Turkish military pilots.\n\nRas al-Ain was one of the places from which US troops withdrew on Monday.\n\n'We will not leave this land,' said Kaws Seem, a 32-year-old Ras al-Ain resident. 'War has been chasing us for years, and everyday Erdogan threatens us with a new attack,' he added.\n\nIt was expected that Ras al-Ain and Tal Abad would be the focus of the first assaults.\n\nKurdish forces have dug trenches and tunnels in both areas, covering streets with metal canopies to block the cameras of Turkish drones.\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said on Wednesday he had 'serious concerns' about Turkey's military action.\n\nHe said: 'This risks destabilising the region, exacerbating humanitarian suffering, and undermining the progress made against Daesh which should be our collective focus.\n\n'Turkey has shown considerable generosity in hosting so many Syrian refugees.\n\n'But we will not support plans for returns until the conditions are in place for a voluntary and safe return home.'\n\nPrior to the invasion Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh, two of the four British ISIS soldiers known as the 'Beatles' were taken into US custody.\n\nThere were fears the men would escape from Syrian jail after a Turkish invasion.\n\nThey beheaded seven American, British and Japanese journalists and aid workers and a group of Syrian soldiers, boasting of the butchery in videos released to the world.\n\nErdogan tweeted Wednesday that his armed forces along with the Syrian National Army had launched 'Operation Peace Spring' to 'prevent the creation of a terror corridor' along the Turkish border.\n\nA photo from Syria's Tell Abyad region shows a Turkey-backed Syrian National Army soldier going through a tunnel believed to have been used by the YPG or ISIS\n\nSmoke rises from Tel Arkam village in the Ras al Ain countryside on Thursday as Turkey continues its offensive into the border territory\n\nAn armoured vehicle of the Syrian National Army kicks up dust as it heads south to reinforce foot soldiers\n\nTurkish Armed Forces' military vehicles moving, at Syrian border in Akcakale district of Turkey's Sanliurfa province on Thursday\n\nSmoke rises from the Syrian village of Tel Arkam on Thursday as fresh barrages rain down on the northern border Thursday\n\nMembers of Turkey-backed Syrian National Army wave as they are on the way to northern Syria for a military operation in Kurdish areas, near the Syrian border, in Akcakale\n\nSyrian National Army members toll towards the border on Thursday as they join their comrades in the Turkish army as part of the operation\n\nSmoke rises after howitzers of Turkish Armed Forces batter targets this morning in Tell Abyad as part of Turkey's Operation Peace Spring\n\nTurkish soldiers stand guard near the Turkey Syrian border on Thursday as their comrades flood into the neighbouring country Thursday\n\nTurkish armoured vehicles escort members of the Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army as they enter Syria Thursday\n\nMembers of the Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army roll towards the northern border of their homeland, with a machine gun mounted on the back of their truck\n\nTurkish armoured vehicles escort members of the Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army on Thursday as forces are mustered at the border\n\nA military lorry carrying two tanks rolls towards the Syrian border in Hatay province, Turkey, on Thursday as the ground assault takes shape\n\nMembers of Syrian National Army and Turkish Armed Forces move from Akcakale district of Sanliurfa to enter the territory east of the Euphrates River in northern Syria on Thursday\n\nHe added the aim to is to eliminate threats from the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia and the Islamic State militants, and enable the return of Syrian refugees in Turkey after the formation of a 'safe zone' in the area.\n\nThe Turkish president wrote on Twitter: 'Our mission is to prevent the creation of a terror corridor across our southern border, and to bring peace to the area.
