(Aaron P. Bernstein/Reuters)\n\nSenate majority leader Mitch McConnell said Thursday that he would like to see \u201csomething stronger\u201d than the bipartisan resolution the House passed on Wednesday condemning President Trump\u2019s decision to pull U.S. troops out of northern Syria.\n\n\u201cI believe it\u2019s important that we make a strong, forward-looking strategic statement. For that reason my preference would be for something even stronger than the resolution that the House passed yesterday, which has some serious weaknesses,\u201d McConnell said in a Senate floor speech.\n\nThe resolution overwhelmingly passed the House in a 354 to 60 vote, with 129 Republicans voting in favor. It states that Congress \u201copposes the decision to end certain United States efforts to prevent Turkish military operations against Syrian Kurdish forces in Northeast Syria\u201d and demands the White House present a plan to support Kurdish fighters and prevent ISIS from regaining a foothold in the area.\n\nTrump announced last week that he would withdraw American troops stationed in the north part of Syria, saying he did not want the U.S. to \u201cpolice\u201d the area any longer. The decision was condemned by many in Trump\u2019s party, including some of his closest allies, who anticipated that a U.S. troop withdrawal would clear the way for the invasion of the region subsequently launched by Turkey and leave the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, who have fought alongside by U.S troops in an alliance against ISIS, open to attack.\n\nHowever, while McConnell said he was \u201cencouraged\u201d by the resolution, he complained that it is \u201cnarrowly drafted,\u201d and does not address several crucial issues such as the Sunni Arab and Christian communities in Syria.\n\n\u201cIt is curiously silent on the issue of whether to actually sustain a U.S. military presence in Syria, perhaps to spare Democrats from having to go on record on this question,\u201d McConnell remarked. \u201cMany of us will have much more to say on the subject very soon,\u201d he added.", "description": "Mitch McConnell said he would like more than the bipartisan\u00a0resolution condemning President Trump's decision to pull U.S. troops out of northern Syria.", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle", "Jim Geraghty", "Kevin D.
