The poll found that 18 percent were unsure of whether the tours should be brought back.\n\nThe national survey of 1000 likely voters was conducted on March 14. It has a margin of error of +/- 3 percentage points.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe White House has been on the defensive since announcing tours would be canceled because of the $85 billion in automatic spending cuts known as the sequester.\n\nIt\u2019s the most high-profile stumble by the White House in the messaging war over the sequester, as congressional Republicans have repeatedly criticized the decision as a stunt to hurt Congress, where lawmakers have long arranged White House tours for their constituents. One Republican raised the issue during President Obama\u2019s meeting with the conference this week, provoking the only tense moment of an otherwise polite back and forth.\n\nThe White House has taken responsibility for the decision but has suggested it was ultimately made by the Secret Service, which spends about $74,000 a week for the tours. White House officials have said that the Secret Service made the decision in order to maintain its core mission and to avoid furloughs and other cutbacks stemming from the cuts.\n\n\u201cWe had to cancel the tours. It's our job to cancel the tours,\u201d White House press secretary Jay Carney said at a briefing with reporters on Wednesday. \"[The Secret Service] cannot cancel them ... this is not a tour of the Secret Service building. It's a tour of the White House and the grounds, and we run the tours and the invitations and that process.\u201d\n\nBut Carney went on to blame Republicans for triggering the sequester.\n\n\"Let\u2019s go back to the fact that none of this was necessary,\u201d he said. \u201cThese choices are all bad. ... I think we\u2019re now seeing that there are unhappy results of sequester. It may be a home run in some folks\u2019 eyes, a victory for the Tea Party for some. But it\u2019s bad for America.\"\n\nEven before he heard from lawmakers, Obama, sensing the public outcry over the move, said in an interview with ABC News this week that the White House is looking into ways of continuing with some tours for students.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m asking ... is, are there ways, for example, for us to accommodate school groups who may have traveled here with some bake sales,\u201d Obama said. \u201cCan we make sure that kids, potentially, can still come to tour?\u201d\n\nSo far, it's unclear when the tours will resume.\n\nClick here to view data from The Hill Poll.\n\nThis report was updated at 5:42 p.m.", "description": "Fifty-four percent in the poll said that the White House should continue the tours of the mansion.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "published_at": "2013-03-15"}
