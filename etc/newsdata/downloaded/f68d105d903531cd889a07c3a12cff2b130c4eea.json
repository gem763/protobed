The endangered Pumas await in the serious phase of the pool stage when England will face heightened pressure. They breezed through stage one by seeing off Tonga and the USA without incurring any casualties. In fact, remarkably, the England squad are in a better state of health now than when they arrived in Japan.\n\nInstead of incurring damage while easing past those Tier 2 opponents with only four recovery days in between, they have been boosted by the recovery of Mako Vunipola, Jack Nowell and Henry Slade \u2014 who are now poised to make impacts off the bench.\n\nEngland breezed through stage one of their World Cup campaign by beating Tonga and USA\n\nEngland are boosted by the recovery of Mako Vunipola, Jack Nowell (above) and Henry Slade\n\nAll 31 players are available for selection, a rare and welcome luxury. So the Sweet Chariot is reinforced and rolling towards the quarter-finals. Win on Saturday morning and Jones's men will have qualified with a game to spare \u2014 the pool finale against France in Yokohama next Saturday.\n\nThese two clashes were seen as the first means of assessing England's title credentials. When the draw was made way back in May 2017, this was perceived to be the proverbial 'pool of death', with three leading nations forced to scrap for the top two places.\n\nFrom now on, all England's opponents will, theoretically at least, have pedigree and pose a threat. Jones was asked on Friday if his squad are ready to prove they have acquired sufficient big-game temperament and nous to cope with the magnitude of weekly grand occasions.\n\nEngland's opponents from now on have pedigree and will pose a threat to Eddie Jones's side\n\nHe replied: 'It's like a tea bag, isn't it? You don't know how good it is until you put it in hot water.'\n\nWhen England take the plunge on Saturday, their head coach certainly believes they are good enough to cope. Correction, he evidently believes they are good enough to dominate what is sure to be a high-impact contest. He was full of bullish talk on Friday, saying: 'Physically, we are in the best position we have been in.\n\n'We were absolutely flying in training this morning. The players are looking fit, fast, brutal and ready to go.\n\n'When you play Argentina, it's a test of manhood, so you have to take them on up front \u2014 scrum, maul, ruck attack, ruck defence. That's where it will be won.'\n\nThe collisions won't be for the faint-hearted. Argentina know after their opening defeat by France that if they lose again they are out. So these Pumas will give body and soul to the cause.\n\nArgentina will pose a strong threat as they need a win after their opening game loss to France\n\nBut England are equally primed for what Argentina hooker Agustin Creevy said would be a 'war' on the field. The favourites have used the Puma captain's well-intended remark about English rugby sometimes being 'boring' as a tool to get them in the mood for a fire-and-brimstone duel.\n\nOwen Farrell and Co are determined to prove they trump the South Americans for force as well as finesse. Galvanised by a perceived slight, they are capable of seizing control of the set-piece battle against a country still trying to rebuild their lost reputation for scrummaging.\n\nEngland will also hope once again to deploy their rolling maul as a potent try-scoring asset, just as they did against the USA in Kobe nine days ago.\n\nJones refused to describe his team as favourites on Friday, insisting that was for the media to decide. Well, the decision was already made. They are clear favourites, so much so that it would be a seismic shock if they lose to opponents who last beat them a decade ago.\n\nOwen Farrell (above) and George Ford will look to unlock Argentina defence with their finesse\n\nThere may have been much derision aimed at the world rankings of late, but England are third, the Pumas are 10th and that seems a fair reflection of this match-up.\n\nArgentina had lost 10 Tests in a row before they recorded an unconvincing victory over Tonga last weekend, despite failing to score a point in the second half. While their Jaguares reached the Super Rugby final this year, the national team have been in decline since the last World Cup.\n\nThey reached the semi-finals in 2015, as they did in 2007 when current head coach Mario Ledesma was the hooker in a magnificent team. He has a major rebuilding project on his hands now and this is surely too soon for him to be burdened by unrealistic expectations.\n\nArgentina fought back and could have beaten France, perhaps they should have beaten them. But they fell agonisingly short and now they are staring at a pool-stage exit.\n\nThe scenario is prompting varied reactions within their squad. Fly-half Benjamin Urdapilleta, a shock inclusion ahead of the more established Nicolas Sanchez, said: 'We are confident. I don't want to use the word lose, but this is a crucial game with lots of pressure. We should use this as motivation.'\n\nIn contrast, full-back Emiliano Boffelli added: 'I feel no pressure about this game. We want to show what Argentina rugby is about.'\n\nThey can be expected to put up a fight. Anything less would be a betrayal of their proud rugby heritage. But England have such a vast array of firepower. They have ball-carrying, super-skilful front-rowers, athletic and imposing locks, a young and dynamic back-row and an experienced, familiar and balanced creative hub behind the scrum \u2014 Ben Youngs, George Ford and Farrell.\n\nManu Tuilagi's resurgence has been a timely boost and there is express pace and guile out wide.\n\nJones knows he is unleashing a team awash with potency and class. No wonder he is bullish.\n\nIt is near enough the same side who put 57 points on Ireland last month.\n\nEngland will do well to repeat that but they are capable of emphatically dispatching the Pumas from this tournament and igniting their campaign in style.", "description": "CHRIS FOY IN TOKYO: Stage two of England's global mission begins on Saturday morning with what Eddie Jones calls a 'test of manhood' against Argentina.", "authors": ["Chris Foy For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/00/19319582-0-image-a-10_1570232562351.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
