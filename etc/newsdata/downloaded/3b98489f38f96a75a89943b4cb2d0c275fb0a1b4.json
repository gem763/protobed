Join our free text group, Talking Tech", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE\n\nWho's up for Talking Tech, via text message?\n\nYou've listened to the podcast, watched me in online videos, read the weekly newsletter, contributed to our discussions on Facebook and Twitter. Now, I propose arriving directly to your phone as well, via text message, with a new twist: a daily Talking Tech text blast.\n\nAre you concerned about the ever-increasing prices of smartphones, want to get the scoop on what the next Samsung Galaxy or Apple iPhone will be like? Thoughts on Facebook and privacy, the latest data breach, or would just love to get my take on what kind of camera to buy, or the latest smartphone photography trick?\n\nI'm here to help.\n\nOr maybe you want to go off the reservation and just want to reach out to me with a stump request. You know I love to play classic TV theme songs on the guitar. So hit me up with a request, and I'll text you a link, if I can play it. (And I'm pretty sure I can.)\n\nUSA TODAY's Jefferson Graham (Photo: Stephan Cooper)\n\nRather than downloading apps, dodging bots or having to wade through your friends\u2019 curated version of their best selves, what if you could just text back and forth with me on nerdy things, observations and inside intel?\n\nOver the next 90 days, we\u2019re testing group text chats between me and some of our most engaged fans and readers (that could be you).\n\nIn this group text chat, you\u2019ll get inside access to the topics I cover, but also a chance to exchange ideas and talk about the latest tech issues.\n\nWhat will we talk about?\n\nYou know what I\u2019m about, and that\u2019s everything. You\u2019ll get my signature musings, sure, but you\u2019ll also get inside intel ahead of me publishing it in a story (and long before your friend circle gets word of it).\n\nKnow this: This will not be a one-way conversation. If you follow me on social media, you can bet that I'll be seeking your input on stories. And of course, I would love your feedback on the latest posts, podcasts, newsletters, videos and such.\n\nIs this really free? What\u2019s the catch?\n\nNo catch \u2013 it's a test. We\u2019re hoping readers like you will like this service enough to o\ufb00er another way to back quality local news and sports. The only thing we ask in exchange: Just please \ufb01ll out a few surveys about the test over the next few months so we know if you like what we're doing and what would make it better.\n\nQuestions:\n\nWill other people see my number?\n\nNo. When you respond to the group text thread, it just goes to me. I might respond to you individually, or I may quote part of your message back to the group thread, but that\u2019ll come from my number, not yours. Nobody else on the group chat will ever see your contact information.\n\nWhat are you going to do with my number?\n\nJunk texts are the absolute worst, and tricking people into sharing phone numbers is a terrible business model. It's simple: We\u2019ll never give or sell your number to a third party. We won't abuse it internally. When you opt in, you\u2019ll only get a couple messages from us per day around this group chat test. You can opt out at any time. At the end of this test, we'll send you one last follow-up note to let you know if we're moving forward with it. No ongoing texts, no purchases, no credit cards needed.\n\nTo opt into the group chat, enter your number below, con\ufb01rm it on your phone, and we're connected. Help us test out new ways of connecting with readers, and, hopefully, we'll have some fun along the way.\n\nWho's ready for Talking Tech, on text?\n\nSign up\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/08/05/talking-tech-jefferson-graham-direct-your-phone-via-text-msg/1903141001/", "description": "Sign up for new 90-day free group chat texting  experiment.
