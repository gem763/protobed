This is a happy milestone for many reasons.\n\nFor the beautiful little boy was adopted by Li-Da just before his first birthday, seven months ago.\n\nAnd now he is the same age as Li-Da was the first time Prue saw her, fell in love with her and decided to adopt her.\n\nPrue says: \u201cEvery parent feels proud when they see their children\u2019s achievements. Maybe even more when they\u2019re adopted because as well as pride, there was something extra: wonder.\n\n\"Wonder at seeing her attributes that weren\u2019t from me or my husband.\n\n\u201cLi-Da has enhanced our life in so many ways. Now she has adopted a child because she felt her own adoption was so successful and that\u2019s just another way she makes me feel proud.\u201d\n\nIt is clear from looking around Prue\u2019s sprawling Cotswolds manor house that family is her first priority, even though she feels she is an \u201cunreliable granny\u201d, saying: \u201cI\u2019m never here to babysit as I can\u2019t resist working.\u201d\n\n(Image: Adam Gerrard / Daily Mirror)\n\nIn her kitchen, the toys of her seven grandkids \u2013 including second husband John\u2019s \u2013 dot shelves stacked with cookbooks, one of which is by Great British Bake Off co-judge Paul Hollywood.\n\nFamily snaps are on every table and wall in the grand sitting room. And on the lake in her garden is a swan-shaped pedalo just waiting for the grandkids.\n\nSettling on a deep window seat, Prue, 79, tells how she found the little orphan from Cambodia\u2019s killing fields who would become her daughter.\n\nIt is a tale Li-Da has heard many times but it \u00adresonates more than ever now she can truly empathise as an adoptive mum.\n\nIt begins when Prue\u2019s natural son, Daniel, with late husband Rayne Kruger, was a year old. Prue first knew Rayne as the husband of her mother\u2019s best friend.\n\nThey had a 13-year affair and married in 1974. Rayne, a writer, died in 2002.\n\nPrue says: \u201cRayne married a 40-year-old war widow who had three children when he was 24, so he felt he had already brought up children.\n\n\"But I wanted a child and when Daniel was born, Rayne fell in love with him. I was desperate for another and Rayne said there were enough children in the world who needed families, so suggested we adopt. A friend told us she\u2019d heard of a baby perhaps we could have.\u201d\n\nLi-Da was six months old when an American pilot rescued her from Phnom Penh, three days before the city fell to the Khmer Rouge. Orphanage staff said her mum died in a rocket attack and her dad was a soldier who vanished.\n\n(Image: Prue Leith)\n\nAn American couple called Burstein had wanted to adopt her but it was called off when Mrs Burstein died. Hearing of the little girl who had been orphaned twice made Prue fly to Paris, where she was with a foster mother.\n\n\u201cBefore I met Li-Da, I tormented myself with the thought I could never love anyone as much as Daniel. But as soon as I met her, those thoughts vanished.\n\n\"The first time I saw Li-Da, she was asleep in her overcoat in a playpen. She\u2019d been crying and her face was sweating and squashed against the bars.\n\n\"I certainly never thought she\u2019d be pretty. She was so feeble \u2013 I fell in love with her instantly.\u201d\n\nPrue was so overwhelmed with emotion that the star, known for her direct speaking, turned in to a blabbering wreck.\n\n\u201cI tried to be terribly grown up and calm when I called Rayne. So I said, \u2018Her head\u2019s a bit too small and she has very strong eyebrows, which she\u2019ll have to pluck when she grows up\u2019.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018What are you on about? It\u2019s obvious you\u2019re crazy about this baby. I\u2019ll be on the next plane.\u2019 He knew I was trying to say, \u2018We\u2019ve got to have her!\u2019\u201d\n\nLi-Da\u2019s foster carer warned Prue the baby hated men. But as soon as Rayne arrived to meet Li-Da, she walked straight into his arms. \u201cOf course, he fell in love with her too,\u201d says Prue.\n\n(Image: Prue Leith)\n\nHer next worry was Daniel might not take kindly to being usurped by a girl who could run faster to her arms.\n\n\u201cDaniel was a lazy baby who hadn\u2019t crawled yet. He was a fat little thing.\n\n\u201cBut as soon as he saw Li-Da run to me, he had competition, forgot about trying to walk and got up and ran.\n\n\"From the beginning, they adored each other. They had a special baby language only they understood and Daniel could make Li-Da laugh until she rocked and fell backwards.\n\n\u201cThey are different in every way: Li-Da is philosophical, organised, sensible and Daniel is chaotic but very clever. They\u2019d never have chosen each other as friends but are devoted to each other.\u201d\n\nThe problem of taking Li-Da to England from France, where adoption was not legal for anyone under 40, was solved when Prue burst into tears at the British consul.\n\nHasty calls were made to the Home Office and a visa issued.\n\nLi-Da is left with endless unanswered questions about her birth parents and rescue.\n\n(Image: Channel 4)\n\nBut, despite psychologists telling Prue she would probably go off the rails as a teen due to her traumatic start, she never did.\n\nLi-Da says: \u201cI did that classic thing adopted children do of always being good because they\u2019re so grateful.\u201d\n\nWhile Li-Da always intended to follow her\u2019s mum\u2019s \u00adexample by adopting a child, the process was bumpier and longer for her.\n\nShe says: \u201cI had such a happy childhood I wanted to follow my mum and dad\u2019s model. I knew I would love an adopted child because of the love I have for my mum, and she\u2019s not blood.\n\n\u201cBut when I met my husband Matt, he wanted to have our own child. Two weeks after we decided to try, I was diagnosed with breast cancer.\u201d\n\nLi-Da froze her eggs before radiotherapy and chemo. She emerged cancer-free but then endured IVF and a miscarriage, which left her emotionally and physically wrung-out.\n\nLi-Da and Matt, both filmmakers, became more determined to adopt.\n\nBut the process, which they entered here and in America, had just as many tense waits and letdowns as fertility treatment and took four years.\n\nIn the end, she used adoption agency IAC to match her with her son. She had wanted to adopt a baby from Cambodia but was told she would have to stay there for two years.\n\n\u201cAdoption of two children fell through before we were given our son,\u201d says Li-Da.\n\n\u201cEach time we were devastated \u2013 so much so Matt said he wasn\u2019t sure if we could carry on. We\u2019re so glad we did. As soon as we met our son, the love we felt was immediate.\u201d\n\n(Image: Google)\n\nPrue and Li-Da wanted to share their story to mark National Adoption Week. Prue, who married second hubby John Playfair in 2016, says: \u201cLi-Da enriched my life amazingly.\n\n\u201cShe was a lovely child, an amazing woman \u2013 so kind and generous with an instinct to do good. There\u2019s not a mean bone in her body, she\u2019s not self seeking, not an egotist \u2013 not all the things her mother is.\n\n\u201cAnd John thinks she\u2019s the nicest person he knows. Now she has brought a gorgeous little boy into our lives and I feel so lucky.\n\n\"Seeing her very natural bond with him has again been a wonder. Without doubt, adopting Li-Da was the best decision of my life.\u201d\n\n* The Daily Mirror is supporting National Adoption Week.
