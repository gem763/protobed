He said such a delay would be \u201cpointless.\u201d\n\nJohnson said chances for a deal with the European Union were rising, \u201cbecause they can see we are actually determined to strengthen our position by getting ready to come out.\u201d\n\nThe delay bill, due to be voted on by Parliament on Tuesday, would push any exit past the current deadline of Oct. 31. U.K. media report that more than 15 members of Johnson\u2019s own Conservative Party are likely to vote for the legislation.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want an election, you don\u2019t want an election,\u201d he added amid heightened expectations that a general election may be announced within days.\n\nThe British pound GBPUSD, -0.0166% came under renewed pressure on Monday, falling to as low as $1.2036 from $1.2161.
