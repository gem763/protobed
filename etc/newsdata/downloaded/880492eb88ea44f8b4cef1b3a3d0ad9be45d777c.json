Their aim is to complete the journey in 75 days, in an attempt to shatter the existing record of 102 days set in 2013 by Reza Pakravan and Steven Pawley.\n\nTheir route takes them through Norway and Russia to Iran, and then through Egypt, Sudan and the wilds of eastern and southern Africa, ending in Cape Town. They expect to pass through 15 countries. They are now in Kenya, and well on target to take the record despite encountering civil unrest and food poisoning along the way.\n\nLogistics, however, are among the biggest challenges.\n\n\u201cIt was a logistical nightmare, and it took us months to get all of the visas. We had to make a last-minute route change as we couldn\u2019t get an Iraq visa,\u201d Deichmann said.\n\nDeichmann is no stranger to long-distance record breaking, having set both Pan-America and Eurasia traverse records in recent years.\n\n\u201cFrom a physical perspective the Pan-America Solo was harder,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, in Africa anything can happen and the conditions are extremely challenging.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also the first time he\u2019s attempted a record ride with another cyclist.\n\n\u201cWorking as a duo is challenging, as we have different riding rhythms, and there are more mechanical and illness issues too, which means you spend less time on the bike,\u201d Deichmann said. \u201cOn the other hand, it\u2019s also good company, and motivating \u2013 and at the moment we\u2019re ahead of our 75-day schedule.\u201d\n\nThe company and moral support of another rider could prove crucial through the African sector of the ride, and will be something of a new experience for Hympendahl.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s done a lot of ultra racing in the last 10 years, but this is his first very big expedition.\u201d Deichmann said of his partner.\n\nWith many years of ultra riding experiences already logged, pacing and integrating riding with things like finding shelter, food, and updating social media have become second nature for the full-time adventurer.\n\n\u201cI always cycle in terms of hours; around 10-11 a day,\u201d Deichmann said. \u201cWe take breakfast at the sleeping spot and then ride for two hours. Here we snack and then ride three hours to lunch. From there we ride five hours and stop for the evening. We then eat as much as possible, take care of social media and emails, and finally sleep six hours.\u201d\n\nFrom the chills of the Arctic Circle to overnight in a prison cell in Cairo (with the doors unlocked), it\u2019s been a varied ride so far. The trucks and hostile weather in Russia were horrific, something he also experienced during his Eurasia record ride.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the most dangerous place I\u2019ve ever cycled,\u201d Deichmann said. \u201cThere is no place on the road for cyclists, and the trucks pass very fast and much too close.\u201d\n\nIran was a new experience for Deichmann, and, after Russia, it came as a sweet surprise.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of my favourite countries. The desert landscape is stunning, and the people were incredibly friendly. The variation is very big between the small villages and the cities; in the villages it\u2019s very conservative, while big cities are just like anywhere else in the world.\u201d\n\nThe pair were delayed on the border as they entered Kenya, wasting precious minutes as the officer had his breakfast. But the food in Kenya has given Deichmann a boost, and they charge forward towards Nairobi.", "description": "Jonas Deichmann and Philipp Hympendahl are in Kenya, on target to break the 75-day record", "authors": ["Steve Thomas"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/29/95e6f38e-f9fd-11e9-acf9-cafedce87d15_image_hires_140809.jpg?itok=KAsRqVCz&v=1572329296", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
