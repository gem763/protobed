Lawmakers on the committee, led by Waters, have called for Zuckerberg to pause the Libra project until the companies involved can address the outstanding regulatory concerns around the coin.\n\n\u201cWe've faced a lot of issues over the past few years,\u201d Zuckerberg conceded. \u201cI'm sure there are a lot of people who wish it was anyone but Facebook who is helping to put this forward.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut there\u2019s a reason we care about this,\u201d he continued. \u201cFacebook is about putting power in peoples' hands.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg offered a staunch defense of the controversial cryptocurrency project, which has faced skepticism and pushback from regulators around the world since Facebook announced its plans over the summer. He said the cryptocurrency project could help bring financial services into the hands of billions of people worldwide.\n\nWhile he reminded lawmakers that he cannot speak for the broader Libra Association, the 21-member entity tasked with overseeing the cryptocurrency\u2019s launch, lawmakers insisted the cryptocurrency is inextricably tied to Zuckerberg and Facebook.\n\n\u201cLibra is Facebook, and Facebook is you,\u201d said Rep. Ayanna Pressley Ayanna PressleyAOC: Trump comparing impeachment inquiry to a lynching is 'atrocious' These 3 women are defining the race to unseat Trump Ocasio-Cortez mourns Cummings: 'A devastating loss for our country' MORE (D-Mass.). \u201cYou\u2019ve proven we cannot trust you with our emails, with our phone numbers, so why should we trust you with our hard-earned money?\u201d\n\nLibra\u2019s complex structure and massive scale will likely be subject to a vast array of banking, securities, money laundering and illicit finance laws enforced by close to a dozen agencies and departments.\n\nEven the most industry-friendly lawmakers and regulators have expressed alarm about the potential financial impact of a project already primed with 2 billion potential customers.\n\n\u201cI think we should advance. I think we should seek innovation. I'm not opposed to some of the things that you're trying to do,\u201d said Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.).\n\n\u201cI'm gravely, gravely concerned about the implications they may have, the operation of it, but I think we need to give it due consideration,\u201d Loudermilk continued, adding Libra doesn\u2019t \u201cfit in a box.\u201d\n\nAs a payments system, Libra would be forced to monitor transactions to make sure they don\u2019t run afoul of illicit finance laws enforced by the Treasury Department.\n\nWhile Libra does not intend to be a bank, it could still draw scrutiny from several federal bank watchdogs. Because Libra uses a cryptocurrency, that also brings the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission into the fold.\n\nAnd Libra\u2019s broader impact on the global financial system will involve the Federal Reserve, whose chairman, Jerome Powell, urged Libra to hit the breaks or risk serious regulatory backlash.\n\n\u201cYou're creating a whole new currency that could potentially be anonymous and could hide all types of criminal activity,\u201d said Rep. Carolyn Maloney Carolyn Bosher MaloneyHouse passes bill taking aim at anonymous shell companies An unintended burden on small businesses House Republicans 'demand the release of the rules' on impeachment MORE (D-N.Y.), who called Libra \u201ca huge concern to all Americans and national security.\"\n\nThe Libra project is still in its very early stages. Facebook released a white paper laying out its vision over the summer, and the 21 initial members of the Libra Association signed on to its charter just last week. Throughout the day, Zuckerberg emphasized there are still many unresolved questions around what the coin could look like by the time it is launched.\n\n\u201cI actually don\u2019t know if Libra is going to work,\u201d Zuckerberg said.\n\nRight now, the executive said, the founding companies behind the coin are \u201cmaking sure we can architect a system that works and gets the appropriate regulatory approvals.\u201d\n\nHe repeatedly committed that Facebook, currently the Libra coin\u2019s only financial backer, would not support launching the project until U.S. regulators have gotten behind it. He added that Facebook would leave the project entirely if the association tries to launch the cryptocurrency without the go-ahead from concerned regulators.\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s appearance before the House panel came more than a year since he testified about the Cambridge Analytica scandal in a series of widely publicized congressional hearings. His return before Congress comes amid a broader Washington backlash as lawmakers and 2020 Democrats have ratcheted up scrutiny of Big Tech over issues including user privacy, market dominance and election interference.\n\nThe past year has seen a swirl of new controversies, scandals and investigations erupt around Facebook. Just after the company settled for a record-shattering $5 billion fine with the Federal Trade Commission over charges of privacy violations, the company revealed it is facing a separate antitrust investigation from that agency. Meanwhile, the Department of Justice and a team of bipartisan House lawmakers are also probing whether Facebook uses its market dominance in digital advertising and social media to quash competitors and take advantage of users.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we can trust you,\u201d said Rep. Jes\u00fas Garc\u00eda (D-Ill.), who has introduced a bill that would quash the Libra project. \u201cFacebook has acquired too much power, it has become too big, and we should seriously consider breaking it up.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the hearing, Waters and the top Republican on the committee said there are still a litany of outstanding concerns around the cryptocurrency effort.\n\n\u201cWe still don\u2019t have a deeper understanding of how Libra will work, how it will further financial inclusion ... or how it may expand access to financial services for Americans that need it most,\u201d ranking member Patrick McHenry Patrick Timothy McHenryHouse passes bill taking aim at anonymous shell companies Waters clashes with Trump officials over 'disastrous' housing plans House committee pressing Zuckerberg to testify on digital currency Libra MORE (R-N.C.) said.\n\nAfter the hearing, Waters told reporters that she was not satisfied yet, though she was pleased that Zuckerberg came to testify.", "description": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday fielded sharp criticism and tough questions about nearly all aspects of his company's business practices at a hearing about Facebook\u2019s new cryptocurrency project Libra.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/zuckerbergmark_102319as2_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
