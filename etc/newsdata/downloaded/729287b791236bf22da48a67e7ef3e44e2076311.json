She pointed out that Scheer supported removing the traditional definition of marriage from the party's official policy book in 2016.\n\n\"Other people are going to try and talk about the personal aspect of it, and really what matters is knowing that, at the end of the day, that no Conservative government is going to open any of these issues up,\" Raitt told Chris Hall, host of The House.\n\n\"More importantly, we will oppose it and we'll make sure that it doesn't come into law.\"\n\nConservative Deputy Leader Lisa Raitt tells CBC Radio's The House that an Andrew Scheer government would oppose any moves to re-open the abortion debate. (David Kawai/The Canadian Press)\n\nScheer faced a barrage of questions about his social policy positions at a news conference Thursday, his first public event since Liberals began raising questions about his commitment to LGBT and women's rights. He accused Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of dredging up divisive social issues to distract voters from a litany of Liberal scandals.\n\nLiberal tweets\n\nLast week, Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale tweeted a video of a 14-year-old speech by Scheer in the House of Commons opposing same-sex marriage.\n\nOn Thursday, Tourism Minister M\u00e9lanie Joly tweeted out a short video clip of a media interview with Scott Hayward, founder of the anti-abortion group RightNow. In it, Hayward recounts an interview during the leadership campaign in which Scheer affirmed the right of backbench and cabinet members to raise issues related to abortion.\n\nOutgoing Conservative MP Brad Trost, an anti-abortion advocate who was also a leadership contender in 2017, said Scheer used \"mixed messaging\" during the leadership race in order to draw support from both social conservatives and more liberal-minded members of the party.\n\n\"Putting together that coalition was not the easiest thing, but they managed it. I guess, congratulations for their political skill. On the other hand, it left them with a bit of a contradiction,\" he said.\n\nTrost said he expects the political damage may not be severe in the end, but it could derail Scheer's election campaign if he doesn't clarify his positions adequately.\n\n\"It has for the last week. And I've got to admit, watching the Conservative communication experts \u2014 and I use that term loosely \u2014 fumble the issue ... if they keep handling all the issues like this, yeah, it will overshadow,\" he said. \"That's more of a statement on the skill of Andrew's team rather than a statement about the strength of the issue.\"\n\nMany politicians draw a line between their personal beliefs and their political positions.\n\nAn article circulating on Twitter shows that in late 2011, Trudeau told The Canadian Press that he saw no contradiction between defending the rights of gays and lesbians and the tenets of Catholicism, and noted that while he is personally very opposed to abortion, he still believes that no one can tell a woman what she should do with her body.\n\nIn 2006, Green Party Leader Elizabeth May generated some controversy by saying she is against abortion and that she didn't think a woman has a \"frivolous right to choose.\"", "description": "Conservative Party Deputy Leader Lisa Raitt says any attempt\u00a0by backbench MPs\u00a0to re-open the abortion debate would be shut down by a Conservative government \u2014 a position a\u00a0national anti-abortion group says it finds \"deeply\" troubling.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5253305.1566638698!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/snc-lavalin-trudeau-20190819.jpg"}
