That makes it \u201cthe world\u2019s first sovereign gold digital token,\u201d it said.\n\nOther mints have shied away from the largely unregulated world of cryptocurrencies. Reuters reported last year that Britain\u2019s Royal Mint had frozen plans for a digital gold token after the UK government vetoed a plan to have the tokens trade on a cryptocurrency exchange.", "description": "Fintech firm InfiniGold said on Thursday it would launch a digital token backed by gold stored in the vaults of Australia's Perth Mint, one of the world's largest precious metals refiners.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
