Brown admitted Monday that this came at a price.\n\n\"Day one I got backlash,\" Brown said backstage discussing his support for Spicer. \"I started this show with people telling me, 'You\u2019re horrible, you\u2019re crazy, you\u2019re stupid.' Because I showed someone \u2014 who has a different political view than mine\u2014 kindness.\"\n\nWith support from Trump: Sean Spicer, 17 pounds leaner, survives on 'Dancing With the Stars'\n\nWhat happened on the show: 'Dancing With the Stars' recap gives all the drama\n\nKaramo Brown and his partner Jenna Johnson are carried off the floor after being eliminated on \"Dancing With the Stars.\" (Photo: Eric McCandless, ABC)\n\nBrown said he had an overall educational mission coming on the popular reality competition.\n\n\"My goal coming into this was to introduce myself to people who have never seen 'Queer Eye,' to let them know who I am,\u201d he said. \"And also, my goal has always been to show how, if you can show kindness and lead with love, things can change.\"\n\nHe believes he saw this with Spicer, who was his trailer neighbor on the Los Angeles television lot. He saw a lot of Spicer and spoke to him about their viewpoints.\n\n\u201cI have literally every day been planting seeds in his heart,\" Brown said. \"It was like, 'You know when you made this comment, this hurt me as a man. When you made this comment, it hurt me as a person of color. When you made this comment, it hurt me as a gay man.' And literally, I could see each week those seeds being planted (and) blossoming.\"\n\nSean Spicer finds out he made it through another week of the dance competition. SEAN SPICER (Photo: Eric McCandless, ABC)\n\nBrown believes that's why Spicer reacted like he did Monday. It was mission accomplished. He touched Spicer's heart.\n\n\"He got emotional because he\u2019s realizing that I\u2019m not someone you should be attacking in the media,\" Brown said \"I\u2019m a human being. And if I can touch his heart, I\u2019m about to go through and make a tour of Washington! I still want Trump out of office. But that was the goal.\"\n\nThe everyman-dancer Spicer made it through Monday's elimination easily despite earning the lowest judges' scores \u2014 with supreme fan support predominantly from supporters of President Trump. Brown does not think Spicer will make it all the way to hoisting the Mirror Ball Trophy. \"But I\u2019m proud of him. I really am proud of him, because he\u2019s had fun every week and I think he\u2019s exceptional,\" said Brown.\n\nHe believes the unlikely friendship, and the conversations, will last.\n\n\"Sean is literally someone who I would\u2019ve never thought I could be friends with, and I\u2019m going to walk away from here calling him a friend,\" he said. \"I\u2019m going to continue the conversation that we\u2019ve had.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/10/30/dancing-stars-why-sean-spicer-so-sad-karamo-brown/2504764001/", "description": "Karamo Brown believes he touched Sean Spicer's heart during their time on \"Dancing With the Stars.\" That's why Spicer was so sad to see him voted off.", "authors": ["Bryan Alexander", "Published A.M.
