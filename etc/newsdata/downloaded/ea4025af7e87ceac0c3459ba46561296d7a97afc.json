PG&E, California's largest utility, filed for bankruptcy protection in January because it said it could not afford an estimated $30 billion in damages.\n\nIs the PG&E bankruptcy a wake-up call for other companies on climate change?\n\n\"Today's settlement is another step in doing what's right for the communities, businesses, and individuals affected by the devastating wildfires,\" PG&E CEO Bill Johnson said in a statement.\n\nPG&E Corp. on Monday released a plan to offer nearly $18 billion to wildfire victims, insurance companies and cities and public entities in California that battled wildfires sparked by its electrical equipment.\n\nThe San Francisco-based company is under deadline pressure to emerge from bankruptcy by June 2020 in order to participate in a state wildfire fund to help California's major utilities pay out future claims as climate change makes wildfires across the U.S. West more frequent and more destructive", "description": "The deal covers just half of the $20 billion insurance companies wanted, and needs to be approved by a bankruptcy court", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/22/09b08b4b-1836-437a-b1da-3ec7a507f70c/thumbnail/1200x630/dc5ed920bfbbb4917420d763611e73f7/gettyimages-1064170276.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
