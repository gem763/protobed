Is the US safer?\n\nThe war in Afghanistan started 18 years ago to fight terrorism after 9/11. Is the US safer? originally appeared on abcnews.go.com\n\nThe world was dramatically different 18 years ago when the war in Afghanistan started.\n\nThousands of families were grappling with the deaths of their loved ones in the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and Shanksville, Pennsylvania on Sept. 11 and the American public was coming to terms with the reality of an enemy unlike any the nation had faced before -- a shadowy network of terrorists that orchestrated the worst attack on American soil since Pearl Harbor.\n\nLess than a month after the attacks, on Oct. 7, 2001, the course of U.S. military operations changed for years to come when Operation Enduring Freedom officially launched, with then-President George W. Bush announcing the action during an address from the White House Treaty Room.\n\nBush said that the operation involved \"strikes against al Qaeda terrorist training camps and military installations of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan,\" and the \"carefully targeted actions are designed to disrupt the use of Afghanistan as a terrorist base of operations, and to attack the military capability of the Taliban regime.\"\n\nPHOTO: President Bush poses for a photo in the Treaty Room of the White House in Washington, Oct. 7, 2001, after announcing airstrikes on on Afghanistan.

Since then, the terrorism threat landscape has evolved, with ISIS and homegrown extremists emerging as dangers.\n\nSecurity experts appear to agree that original goal of Operation Enduring Freedom seems to have been accomplished, but the question of whether or not America is safer today remains up for debate.\n\n\"We\u2019re safer from an al Qaeda attack, a 9/11-style attack absolutely,\" said retired Col. Christopher Kolenda, who commanded troops in Afghanistan in 2007 and 2008 and also engaged the Taliban in high-level diplomacy on behalf of the secretary of defense.\n\n\"There\u2019s no longer a safe haven in Afghanistan,\" Kolenda said, noting that al Qaeda \"has been decimated and is on the run and is no longer capable of a 9/11-style attack.\"\n\n(MORE: 17th service member killed in Afghanistan this year, 1st since peace talks collapse)\n\nVanda Felbab-Brown, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, who studies Afghanistan and terrorism, echoed that sentiment, saying \"the fact that the Taliban provided safe haven to al Qaeda in which al Qaeda could recruit, organize, plan, train, made al Qaeda very potent, and that is gone now.\"\n\n\"In Afghanistan, the Taliban is currently not a threat to the United States, to the U.S. homeland. It clearly battles [the] U.S. military in Afghanistan but is not motivated to conduct attacks against the U.S. homeland and does not attempt to do so,\" Felbab-Brown said of the current state of the threat from Afghanistan.\n\nPHOTO: US Soldiers from the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force Pendleton camp bound for Helmand, Afghanistan board their flight at the Manas Transit Center, March 6, 2010. (Vyacheslav Oseledko/AFP/Getty Images, FILE) More\n\nJust last month, the Taliban killed an American, one of among 12 people killed in a bomb blast in Kabul. More than a dozen U.S. servicemembers have been killed in the country so far this year -- the highest number since 2014.\n\nAl Qaeda appears to be trying to establish a presence in several countries, \"strengthening the network\u2019s global command structure and continuing to encourage attacks against the West, including the United States,\" according to the 2019 Worldwide Threat Assessment from former Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats.\n\nKolenda noted that \"al Qaeda is still unable to reestablish a presence in Afghanistan,\" but added that \"the real question becomes \u2018Is the current level of investment in troops and treasure necessary to prevent to a large-scale terror safe haven for al Qaeda or Islamic State, or are there other options\u2019\" on how to achieve that goal.", "description": "The world was dramatically different 18 years ago when the war in Afghanistan started.
