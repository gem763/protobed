Photo: The Morning Toast/YouTube\n\nThere\u2019s a lot going on with Kanye West this week. He\u2019s allegedly releasing a new album, Jesus Is King, on October 25. (Don\u2019t hold your breath, it\u2019s already been delayed for months.) And he just announced he\u2019s got another album, confusingly named Jesus Is Born, slated for December. And also, uh, well, he allegedly had Claudia and Jackie Oshry, influencers better known as Girl With No Job and Jackie O, debut a cover of a song off Jesus Is King during their daily YouTube morning show, The Morning Toast. (Verizon\u2019s Oath canceled the sisters\u2019 show, The Morning Breath, in 2018 for anti-Muslim tweets. In September, Claudia made headlines for refusing to apologize for suggesting shootings are less likely to happen in nicer movie theaters.)\n\nOn Thursday morning\u2019s show, Claudia read an email she claimed to have received from a woman who works for West. \u201cWe love your singing and we\u2019d love to hear your version of a song off the new Kanye album before it comes out to the public slated for Friday. Please see sheet music attached and post a YouTube video if you\u2019re up for it,\u201d Oshry read aloud. \u201cNot only did I get recognized by Kanye West and his team, they said they liked my voice and then I got his new song. It\u2019s very real. It\u2019s very legit.\u201d The sisters, including Snitch a.k.a. Margo Oshry snapping along, then proceed to perform \u201cClosed on Sunday,\u201d first debuted at one of those Jesus Is King listening party false-starts last month. I could detail further but you should probably just watch it around the 2:50 mark.\n\nI have \u2026 so many questions?", "description": "Claudia Oshry, an influencer better known as Girl With No Job, performed \u201cClosed on Sunday,\u201d a track of Kanye West\u2019s forthcoming album, \u201cJesus Is King.\u201d Oshry performed it on her YouTube show, The Morning Toast, with her sisters, Jackie and Margo.", "authors": ["Madison Malone Kircher"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/24/24-morning-toast-kanye-west.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
