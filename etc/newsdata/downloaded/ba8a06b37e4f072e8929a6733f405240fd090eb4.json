Evans during the Battle off Semar of 1944. \u201cI intend to go in harm\u2019s way, and anyone who doesn\u2019t want to go along had better get off right now. Now that I have a fighting ship, I will never retreat from an enemy force.\u201d\n\nEvans was given a ship. A model that would play a large role in naval warfare during World War II. The Battle off Semar was one of many fierce fights where the destroyer ripped through the waters, placing crewmembers in odds against submarines, transports, and other major threats.\n\nTom Hanks\u2019s movie, Greyhound, was originally supposed to be coming out March 22, but was recently pushed back to Spring 2020. Anyone who wants to know more about the destroyer ships and their legacy during both world wars should read Clint Johnson\u2019s book, Tin Cans & Greyhounds.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been a civil war historian for years and I wanted to do something new,\u201d Johnson said in an interview with Townhall.\n\nHe found inspiration reading about two destroyers, both named the USS Jacob Jones. One served in World War I and the other in World War II. Both were attacked by torpedoes and sunk, losing many of their crew members.\n\nJohnson found the stories fascinating but realized that there weren\u2019t many works telling a comprehensive history of destroyer ships.\n\n\u201cDestroyers are probably the most versatile of all the warships in World War I and World War II,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cTin cans\u201d and \u201cGreyhounds\u201d were both nicknames for the destroyer. The \u201ctin can\u201d nickname references the ships\u2019 thin hulls.\n\n\u201cTheir hull is only a half inch thick. That was all that was keeping the crew from the ocean,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nWhile this made the ships less secure for the crew inside, they also made the ships travel fast, like a greyhound.\n\nIn his book, Johnson covers the early history of the destroyer and how it was invented. He then covers various battles the destroyers were used in World War I and II.\n\nOne of the more interesting stories, Johnson mentioned, was the story of the USS Buckley. During World War II, the ship patrolled the waters of the South Atlantic. On May 6, 1944, the Buckley engaged in combat with a German U-boat.\n\nThe crew took the enemy by surprise as it rammed the destroyer into the U-boat. The battle soon turned into hand-to-hand combat. The Americans used everything they had to fight the Germans; even coffee mugs were used in the fierce conflict.\n\nJohnson said that the only injury that was inflicted on an American in that battle was a bruised hand, after the crew member bashed an enemy soldier with it.\n\nThis and many other battles are reflected in the book, which serves as Johnson\u2019s push to try to give destroyers and their crew members the recognition they deserve.\n\n\u201cI make a point in the book that there are only four destroyers in museums across the United States,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI am puzzled by it too, but the Navy and the federal government are just focused on what\u2019s happening right now, and not so much on preservation.\u201d\n\nIn fact, most of the destroyers that helped win the world wars were eventually cut down for scrap and repurposed, leaving behind a historical legacy.\n\n\u201cIt is upsetting,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s upsetting to me.\u201d\n\nJohnson also expressed concerns with the historical accuracy of the upcoming Tom Hanks movie.\n\n\u201cHis Greyhound is supposed to be called USS Greyhound,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not how they were named.\u201d\n\nJohnson said that destroyers were named after real-life American naval heroes. The author believes that if the movie sticks with the name they have, it will upset a lot of Navy members. And after all, those are the people that not only manned the destroyers, but all the other ships that tread the vast waters to defend our nation.\n\n\u201cThey knew that they had to be very good at their jobs and to avoid their enemies,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nTin Cans & Greyhounds is available on Amazon and wherever books are sold.\n\nWhen you make a purchase, Townhall Media receives a revenue share from qualifying purchases as an Amazon Associate.", "description": "The Battle off Semar was one of many fierce fights where the destroyer ripped through the waters, placing crewmembers in odds against submarines, transports, and other major threats....09/02/2019 3:11:21AM EST.", "authors": ["Ian", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/42/b557c7b5-5cd6-41cb-884a-633969436eb4.png"}
