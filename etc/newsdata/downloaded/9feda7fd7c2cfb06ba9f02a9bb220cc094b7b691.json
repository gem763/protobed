Brexit \u2018do or die\u2019 pledge at heart of Queen\u2019s Speech", "language": "en", "text": "The Queen re-opens Parliament after a three-day suspension (Picture: AFP)\n\nThe 65th Queen\u2019s Speech has re-opened Parliament setting out Boris Johnson\u2019s post-Brexit agenda, leaving just a few days for MPs to rush through a bill to secure a deal before the end of the month.\n\nWritten for the Queen by ministers, the ceremony marked the opening of a new parliamentary session, following two controversial prorogations called by the PM.\n\nThe 93-year-old monarch was accompanied through the House of Lords by her eldest son, Prince Charles, following Prince Philip\u2019s decision to step back from public life at the age of 98.\n\nMr Johnson set out his domestic agenda in the speech \u2013 following a three day suspension of Parliament \u2013 which opened by insisting the \u2018government\u2019s priority has always been\u2019 to make sure the UK leaves the EU this year.\n\nDuring the speech, the Queen spoke of the importance of \u2018protecting the integrity of democracy and the electoral system\u2019, after outlining new policies which will prevent people from voting unless they carry photographic ID at polling stations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe speech also focused on cracking down on violent and foreign criminals, reforming adult social care and investing more money in the NHS.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nThe Queen delivered the speech which included 26

\u2018restore confidence\u2019 in the UK justice system, after announcing the package of 26 bills, including seven relating to crime and justice.\n\nThese include legislation to keep serious criminals in prison for longer, impose tougher sentences on foreign offenders who return to the UK, and provide better protection for victims of domestic abuse.\n\nHer Majesty said: \u2018New sentencing laws will see that the most serious offenders spend longer in custody to reflect better the severity of their crimes.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Sentencing Bill will change the automatic release point from halfway to two thirds for adult offenders serving sentences of four years or more for serious violence or sexual offences.\n\nThe Government will also bring back the Domestic Abuse Bill which fell as a result of Mr Johnson\u2019s unlawful suspension of Parliament last month.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Brexit featured heavily in the Speech, with less than two weeks until the UK\u2019s departure on October 31.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nQueen Elizabeth II travels in a carriage to Parliament

main opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn (Picture: AFP)\n\nHer Majesty went on to say that a Brexit deal will be formed on \u2018free trade and friendly cooperation\u2019, adding that a new bill will be introduced ending free movement.\n\nUnder the legislation, EU citizens moving to Britain after January 2021 will lose their automatic right to settle in Britain and will be treated in the same way as citizens from non-EU nations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe government says the new points-based system will select immigrants based on their skills and their potential contribution to the U.K.\n\nUnder the proposals, all 3.4 million EU citizens living in the U.K. now can stay.\n\nThe plans depend on Britain leaving the EU with a withdrawal agreement \u2013 something that remains uncertain.\n\nThe Queen added that following Brexit, ministers will focus on industries such as fisheries, agriculture, and trade, \u2018seizing the opportunities that arise from leaving the European Union\u2019.\n\nCarriages are seen carrying The Mace and The Crown before Queen Elizabeth II rides the Diamond Jubilee Coach along The Mall (Picture: Peter Macdiarmid/LNP)\n\nThe State Opening is a

(Picture: AFP)\n\nPlans were also laid out to increase the national living wage to \u00a310.50 an hour to \u2018make work fairer\u2019 for British citizens, added Her Majesty.\n\nThe Queen also announced plans for investing in the NHS and strengthening environmental protections, as London enters its second week of Extinction Rebellion takeovers.\n\n\u2018For the first time, environmental principles will be enshrined in law,\u2019 continued the Queen.\n\nMeasures will be introduced to improve air and water quality, reduce plastic, and restore habitats \u2018so plants and wildlife can thrive\u2019, added Her Majesty.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II reads the Queen\u2019s Speech on the The Sovereign\u2019s Throne in the House of Lords (Picture: AFP)\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson and Leader

for a two-year Parliamentary session to have more time to prepare the country for Brexit and secure a deal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Johnson will meet with EU officials in Brussels this week to finalise a Brexit deal ahead of the UK\u2019s planned departure on October 31.\n\nSpeaker John Bercow has since led MPs back into the Commons chamber, and the sitting is suspended until 2.30pm.\n\nMPs are expected to start debating the speech within the next few hours, after Mr Johnson pitches his new policies to the House of Commons.\n\nThe debate, known as the \u2018Humble Address\u2019, could last for around five days, with the likes of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn having an opportunity to have his say on the agenda.\n\nVeteran Labour MP Dennis Skinner was one MP who refused to attend the Queen\u2019s Speech after he delivered a traditional heckle in the Commons.\n\nCamilla, Duchess of Cornwall arrives (Picture: AFP)\n\nYeoman warders take part in the traditional Ceremonial search

affectionately as the Beast of Bolsover \u2013 is renowned for making quips during the State Opening of Parliament and it has become part of the pomp and circumstance of the event.\n\nHe appeared to mutter \u2018I\u2019m not going\u2019, after Black Rod requested MPs\u2019 attendance in the House of Lords to hear the Queen\u2019s Speech, prompting laughter from both sides of the House of Commons.\n\nAs the Queen ended her speech, Labour MP Jim McMahon tweeted: \u2018Really admire The Queen. Not sure I could have read that without swearing out loud.\u2019\n\nAhead of the speech, Chancellor Sajid Javid announced he is planning to hold a Budget just six days after the UK\u2019s scheduled Brexit date.\n\nMr Javid tweeted: \u2018On 6th November I\u2019ll deliver Britain\u2019s first Budget after Brexit and set out our plan to shape the economy and deliver our infrastructure revolution.\u2019\n\nWith no Commons majority, it is questionable how much of the proposed legislation in the Queen\u2019s Speech ministers can get through Parliament before a general election.\n\nCaption: Carrie Symonds, the partner of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, waiting for State Opening of Parliament to begin (Picture: PA)\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nMembers of the Household Cavalry prepare to form a guard of honour on the royal staircase (Picture: AFP)\n\nThe Royal Gallery in the Houses of Parliament (Picture: Pete Maclaine/i-Images)\n\nWhat is the Queen's Speech? The Queen\u2019s Speech, which usually takes place annually, allows the government to set out their political agenda for the next Parliamentary session. During the speech, the Queen announces laws the government wants Parliament to approve, which is televised from the House of Commons. The queen has performed this duty more than 60 times during her 67-year reign. Watch the Queen\u2019s Speech live here: Lady Usher of the Black Rod (Picture: AFP) It is part of the State Opening of Parliamentary ceremony, which starts with the Queen travelling in horse-drawn carriage \u2013 the Diamond Jubilee Coach \u2013 from Buckingham Palace to Westminster. Before departing for the occasion, Queen Elizabeth II would have received the speech, written by ministers, from the throne of the House of Lords. Before she arrived, the priceless Imperial State Crown and other regalia used in the ceremony was brought to Parliament in a separate heavily-guarded carriage. The crown includes 2,868 diamonds, including the Second Star of Africa diamond, and many other gems. The Queen\u2019s, Imperial State Crown is carried into the Palace of Westminster for the State Opening of Parliament (Picture: AFP) The crown was made for King George VI\u2019s coronation in 1937, based on a crown designed for Queen Victoria in 1838. As the Queen made her way over, MPs were called to the House of Commons by Black Road \u2013 a House of Lords official. Black Rod has the doors shut in their face and knocks three times before entering the Commons, in a bid to symbolise the chamber\u2019s independence from monarchy.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
