Some say the ivy-covered halls are a dangerous place indeed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve created a monster and it\u2019s turning around to consume us. When you teach bad ideas, you get bad culture, bad community, bad government and bad kids. When you teach good ideas, you get good kids.\u201d Everett Piper, former president of American University, tells Fox News.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been teaching ideological foreclosure. We\u2019ve been teaching political correctness rather than common sense, natural law, self-evident truths and those big laws which actually lend themselves of freedom,\u201d he continues.\n\nMr. Piper is hoping for the best as many colleges and universities continue to foster alarming academic culture which has eroded basic American values. He suggests that the nation is at a tipping point.\n\n\u201cCrisis always participates change. This crisis of lack of academic freedom and thought control could lead us to a correction. And the correction would be recognizing that you go to school to learn what\u2019s good, what\u2019s beautiful and what\u2019s true. You don\u2019t go to college or university to be indoctrinated. You should be there for a thoughtful debate, not to have your thoughts controlled,\u201d Mr. Piper explains.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ideological fascism,\u201d he says.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama also has a cultural concern.\n\n\u201cThis idea of purity and you\u2019re never compromised and you\u2019re politically woke and all that stuff \u2014 you should get over that quickly,\u201d Mr. Obama told a youthful audience in Chicago not 48 hours ago.\n\n\u201cI get a sense sometimes now among certain young people, and this is accelerated by social media. There is this sense sometimes of the way of me making change is to be as judgmental as possible about other people and that\u2019s enough. That\u2019s not activism. That\u2019s not bringing about change. If all you\u2019re doing is casting stones, you\u2019re probably not going to get that far. That\u2019s easy to do,\u201d he advised.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation, however, is fighting back with the recent launch of the new Edwin J. Feulner Institute, named after the organization\u2019s founder and charged with restoring confidence in America\u2019s founding values and principles.\n\n\u201cAmerica is exceptional and America is great, and it is our duty to make sure that future generations know these truths and know why they are the truth,\u201d says Heritage Foundation President Kay Coles James. \u201cMany people today just don\u2019t understand the uniqueness of this country and why what the founders created was so special. They don\u2019t understand that it\u2019s our founding principles that created the strongest, most free, most prosperous nation in the history of the world. Without this basic understanding, without this basic appreciation for our country, they have no idea why it\u2019s worth preserving.\u201d\n\nDISAPPOINTING, CONFUSING, SKEWED, ETCETERA\n\nImpeachment news coverage by any other name would smell, well, not very good.\n\nA brand new Politico/Morning Consult poll asked voters to describe their reactions to \u201ccurrent media coverage of the impeachment process.\u201d The pollster came up with a cross section of emotional judgment calls on press efforts.\n\nDid respondents find the coverage negative, positive, boring, interesting, frustrating, encouraging, disappointing, confusing, exciting, skewed, fair or trustworthy?\n\nNo, really. There were a dozen questions in the poll asking voters to respond to those adjectives. Hint: Majorities said the coverage was skewed, confusing and disappointing, only 27% deemed it exciting and 28% felt encouraged.\n\nYes, well. Message to the press: Biased reporting does not happen in a vacuum. Americans are smarter than that. See more numbers in the Poll du Jour at column\u2019s end.\n\n\u2018PANDERING TO THE KOOKS\u2019\n\nOK, so we\u2019ve got dicey media coverage, partisan potshots and confusion during the impeachment \u201cinquiry,\u201d which could mutate into an impeachment process any minute now.\n\n\u201cOne way or another, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will go down in history. Let\u2019s hope she doesn\u2019t take America with her. The speaker\u2019s decision to go all in on impeachment is fraught with danger and could have fateful consequences far beyond Donald Trump\u2019s presidency,\u201d writes New York Post columnist Michael Goodwin, who calls the effort a \u201chistoric mistake\u201d and a \u201cmeritless, reckless assault on democracy.\u201d\n\nHe also says Mrs. Pelosi is out to appease the radicals in her own party.\n\n\u201cShe is ready to throw America into chaos simply as a political favor to the Democrats\u2019 wing-nuts so they won\u2019t run primaries against her leadership team and committee heads. Pelosi isn\u2019t leading, she\u2019s following,\u201d the columnist says. \u201cPelosi\u2019s pandering to the kooks mocks the gravity of the impeachment provision and makes rank partisanship her sole agenda. Instead of working with the Senate and White House on legislation that might move the nation forward, she chooses to take it backward and risks igniting a violent spasm of tribalism.\u201d\n\nThe rush to impeachment will likely fail, Mr. Goodwin predicts, noting that there will also be an \u201cX factor\u201d at work here \u2014 evidence that some forces were actually spying on the Trump presidential campaign in 2016.\n\n\u201cImagine the impact of that on the 2020 race,\u201d he says. \u201cGood luck with that burden.\u201d\n\nAPPLYING THE LIPSTICK\n\nRepublicans say the impeachment plans of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff have gone awry.\n\n\u201cPelosi\u2019s backtracking proves that she and Adam Schiff know that their unfair and secretive impeachment process has been politically devastating and now they\u2019re trying to put lipstick on their political vendetta pig,\u201d advises Steve Guest, rapid response director for the Republican National Committee.\n\nPOLL DU JOUR\n\n\u2022 63% of U.S. voters say media coverage of the impeachment process is \u201cfrustrating\u201d; 80% of Republicans, 62% of independents and 52% of Democrats agree.\n\n\u2022 55% of voters overall say the coverage is \u201cdisappointing\u201d; 75% of Republicans, 55% of independents and 37% of Democrats agree.\n\n\u2022 52% overall say the coverage is \u201cskewed\u201d; 71% of Republicans, 52% of independents and 33% of Democrats agree.\n\n\u2022 35% overall say the coverage is \u201cfair\u201d; 9% of Republicans, 29% of independents and 64% of Democrats agree.\n\n\u2022 45% overall say the coverage if \u201cboring\u201d; 60% of Republicans, 46% of independents and 29% of Democrats agree.\n\n\u2022 32% overall say it is \u201ctrustworthy\u201d; 11% of Republicans, 24% of independents and 59% of Democrats agree.\n\nSource: A Politico/Morning Consult poll of 1,997 registered U.S. voters conducted Oct. 25-28.\n\n\u2022 Kindly follow Jennifer Harper on Twitter @HarperBulletin.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
