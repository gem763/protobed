Under Johnson\u2019s deal, Northern Ireland would stick to some of the EU\u2019s -- and therefore the Irish Republic\u2019s -- food standards and customs rules, meaning there would be checks on goods traveling from the rest of the U.K. to the province. Moreover, the DUP alone won\u2019t have the power to veto the rules coming into force.\n\n\u201cWith our ten votes being so critical in Parliament, there is a great responsibility to make sure we support the right decisions for Northern Ireland but have the boldness and strength to stand up and say no when we need to,\u201d Foster said. \u201cOn Brexit, we will not give support to the Government when we believe they are fundamentally wrong.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Johnson said he will seek an election on Dec. 12. But to hold it, he needs the support of two-thirds of members of Parliament, and the opposition Labour party has said it will block it.\n\n\u201cThere is much talk about the holding of a general election,\u201d Foster said. \u201cThis party is ready for any general election that may come.\u201d\n\nIllustrating the party\u2019s anger toward the Conservative government, it refused a request by Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay to address the conference.\n\n\u201cGiven his recent inability to recall what he actually negotiated, we politely declined,\u201d Nigel Dodds, the party\u2019s deputy leader, said in a speech.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Dara Doyle in Dublin at ddoyle1@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Chad Thomas at cthomas16@bloomberg.net\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Sign up to our\u00a0Brexit\u00a0Bulletin, follow us @Brexit\u00a0and\u00a0subscribe to our podcast.Democratic Unionist Party Leader Arlene Foster threatened to frustrate Boris Johnson\u2019s efforts to push his Brexit deal through, warning the U.K. leader that her party would continue to oppose the accord in Parliament", "authors": ["Dara Doyle"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
