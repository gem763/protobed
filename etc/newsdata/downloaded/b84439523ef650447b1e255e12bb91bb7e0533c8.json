But with Ashley Giles, the director of England cricket, set to reveal his centrally contracted players for 2019-20 this Friday \u2013 and Rashid expected to feature only among the white\u2011ball cricketers \u2013 he faces another crossroads.\n\nRashid, whose last Test came in Barbados at the start of the year, told the Guardian: \u201cI would love to [get another Test deal] but I don\u2019t know what their vision is for me. I thought I did OK in the games I played but we got smashed by West Indies in the first Test in January and I haven\u2019t played since.\n\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t get one, I need to decide what to do next. Is it focusing on white-ball cricket again? With the injury, I do need to think about my longevity. Whatever happens, I\u2019ll always be thankful to Ed Smith [the national selector] and Joe Root [the Test captain] and the coaches for giving me the chance.\u201d\n\nRashid\u2019s injury is more serious than some have made out. When he tried to return in the T20 Blast in August, the pain-masking injections from the World Cup had worn off. With an impingement in the joint and ligament damage, two months of rest was prescribed in order to be ready for the winter tours.\n\nIn contrast to the joyous scenes after the World Cup when, as a key member of Eoin Morgan\u2019s one-day side, he received a hero\u2019s welcome in his home city of Bradford, the reaction to his injury on social media was mixed.\n\nThere were claims from supporters that Rashid had \u201cno interest\u201d in the club, he was \u201clazy\u201d, had a \u201cchronic attitude problem\u201d and it was time to \u201cget rid\u201d. The club stating that he \u201cdeclared himself unfit\u201d before the full diagnosis did not help.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Adil Rashid celebrates after taking the wicket of Kusal Mendis in the Sri Lanka Test series. Photograph: Dinuka Liyanawatte/Reuters\n\n\u201cI was upset about that,\u201d Rashid said. \u201cThe way it was phrased meant some people could perceive it as me not wanting to play for the club. But that\u2019s not true. I was really looking forward to the T20s.\n\n\u201cI could barely lift my arm \u2013 it was that bad. The bone was rubbing in the socket and there are [ligament] tears in there too. The England doctors confirmed the injury. And I couldn\u2019t have any more injections. I have just got to do it the hard way, which is two months of rest.\u201d\n\nBen Stokes attacks 'despicable' Sun story about family tragedy Read more\n\nThere is history behind the scepticism, stemming back to the County Championship decider against Middlesex at Lord\u2019s in 2016 and a defeat that denied Yorkshire three titles in a row. It is hard not to wonder whether, like recent events, the way this played out publicly was slightly unfair on the leg-spinner.\n\nRashid was one of three England players who was down to rest before an epic tour to Bangladesh and India that departed the following week. Yet unlike Root, centrally contracted, and Jonny Bairstow, about to start one himself, he did not have England to absorb the blame for him.\n\nIt was also the biggest opportunity of his Test career \u2013 seven near\u2011guaranteed matches on the spin-friendly tracks of the subcontinent \u2013 but when the club asked him to reconsider, a family illness was also unfolding in the buildup to his departure overseas and he felt unable to change tack.\n\nThe Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\n\nRashid explained: \u201cThat decision was bigger than cricket \u2013 it was life or death. My grandma was on her death bed and I was going away on tour the next week. Looking back, I\u2019m still happy I made that decision. All the decisions I make with Yorkshire and my career, I never regret.\n\n\u201cFor Yorkshire fans who still don\u2019t accept that, that\u2019s their problem. There are some for me, some against. Sometimes it can be upsetting and I think: \u2018Why am I singled out?\u2019 You have doubts in your head about the reasons.\n\nAshes 2019: stellar images from an unforgettable summer Read more\n\n\u201cBut myself and Yorkshire, we\u2019re on good terms at the moment. You can have a bit of bad engagement or disagreements over time but as long as you get back on the same page, that\u2019s all that matters. I enjoy playing for Yorkshire and see myself representing Yorkshire in future.\u201d\n\nYorkshire have told the Guardian they feel the same. Despite the outside noise, Rashid is highly regarded at the club \u2013 one senior club official described him as \u201clow maintenance\u201d \u2013 and they hope to sign him up for the Headingley 100\u2011ball team, too.\n\nThe only question now is which formats he plays. Were he to sign a new white-ball-only deal, it would rule him out of England\u2019s Test tour to Sri Lanka next March after last year\u2019s call-up forced a change to the selection policy that sees players only eligible for formats they are contracted for domestically.\n\nEither way, Yorkshire are relaxed and have plans to honour their most prominent academy graduate from the British Asian community by naming some element of the new \u00a35m cricket centre at Bradford Park Avenue after him. In the city with the largest proportion of British Pakistanis (20.3%) in England, it would be fitting gesture.", "description": "The Yorkshire and England leg-spinner is at a crossroads and tells Ali Martin he is considering a return to white-ball specialism", "authors": ["Ali Martin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/960e4106ea65db70231a275e234ba0904b5015d9/0_226_4194_2516/master/4194.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6179dba03d0b2fa0ef12da50dcbd0d51", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
