Though battered, spent and robbed of their veneer of invincibility, the Astros, with a 6-1 victory, survived.\n\nThey celebrated the final out Thursday night with a tasteful scrum near the mound, with Cole at one point breaking out of the pack to doff his cap to the crowd, which produced a mighty roar in response.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Astros and Yankees have been circling each other seemingly all season, all of it pointing toward the October matchup that seemed predestined that will begin with Game 1 on Saturday night. The Yankees held the AL\u2019s best record July 1. The Astros held it Aug. 1, the Yankees again Sept. 1, and finally, the Astros again Sept. 29, the season\u2019s final day \u2014 a distinction that earned them home-field advantage.\n\nSomewhere, the Yankees, having swept the Minnesota Twins out of the playoffs, were watching this Division Series play out, with the Rays and Astros pushing each other to a decisive Game 5, and smiling a satisfied smile.\n\nNo matter their opponent in the ALCS, the Yankees would benefit from facing an opponent that had been forced to max out their resources just to survive the Division Series \u2014 and that was especially so of the Astros, who are more oriented around starting pitching. Now, with twin aces Justin Verlander and Cole having started Games 4 and 5, the Astros will turn to Zack Greinke \u2014 no slouch himself, but not Verlander, and not Cole \u2014 in Game 1, followed by the twin aces in Games 2 and 3.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Yankees will throw lefty James Paxton and right-handers Luis Severino and Masahiro Tanaka in the first three games, perhaps in that order.\n\nThe Astros, winners of a major league leading 107 games, hadn\u2019t expected to be pushed this close to the brink so soon in the fall. But here they were, facing a winner-take-all contest in their home building against a low-budget Rays team that may have been full of anonymous names, but was every bit the championship-caliber competitor their 96 wins suggested they were.\n\nAlready this month, the Rays had stared down three elimination games and won them all, by an aggregate score of 19-5. That includes consecutive wins at home in Games 3 and 4 of this series against former Cy Young Award winners Greinke and Verlander, the latter of whom pitched on three days\u2019 rest.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThose failures were made more palatable for the Astros by the presence of a fully rested Cole, standing by for Thursday night\u2019s start. A leading Cy Young candidate and an overpowering winner in Game 2, he would have gotten the ball Thursday night even if the Astros could have taken any pitcher from any roster for the assignment.\n\nCole\u2019s mission was made easier by the four runs the Astros put up in the bottom of the first against rocket-armed Rays right-hander Tyler Glasnow, the big blow a two-run double by Alex Bregman. A four-run lead for Cole is a pretty safe cushion, as it meant the Rays would need at least five runs to beat him \u2014 the same number of earned runs he allowed in the entire month of September, in six starts spanning 42 innings.\n\nBut as the innings wore on and the Astros\u2019 lead grew no larger \u2014 the Rays cycling through a total of nine pitchers in the game \u2014 Cole\u2019s pitch count was at almost as important as the zeros he kept putting up on the scoreboard. That\u2019s because Astros Manager A.J. Hinch would have loved to ride him until deep in the game, thus avoiding a heavy lift for a bullpen that has stood as the Astros\u2019 weak link in this series.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA big moment came in the top of the seventh, when Cole, with a runner on first and his pitch count climbing toward 100, induced a double-play grounder from Avisail Garcia, sparing him perhaps another half-dozen pitches.\n\nThe sellout crowd of 43,418 rose and cheered as Cole emerged from the Astros\u2019 dugout to pitch the eighth, with top reliever Will Harris warming in the bullpen. Cole set the Rays down in order, notching his 10th strikeout of the night along the way \u2014 his 11th straight start of double-digit K\u2019s.\n\nSolo homers by Michael Brantley and Jose Altuve in the eighth expanded the Astros\u2019 lead to 6-1 and afforded Hinch the luxury of ending Cole\u2019s night at eight innings and 107 pitches. After closer Roberto Osuna completed a 1-2-3 ninth inning, the Astros had survived the Rays.\n\nThey would face the Yankees in less than 48 hours, but they would not have their firewall in place again \u2014 the great Cole \u2014 until a few days after that.\n\nAD", "description": "Right-hander is sublime with eight innings of two-hit ball as Houston advances to American League Championship Series showdown with Yankees.", "authors": ["Dave Sheinin", "National Baseball Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/j_eshsti_tK0vnkm_sl4PkIs6mg=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/W6GGMBHL2QI6TEYGI7FQGJH5IQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
