This new opt-in feature was promised back in August after reports that audio from Siri requests were being reviewed by contractors and that the audio could contain sensitive or personal information.\n\nApple had previously halted the grading process entirely while it updated the process by which it used the audio clips to \u201cimprove Siri.\u201d\n\nThe new process will include an explicit opt-in for those users who want to have clips of commands transmitted to Apple to help improve how well Siri understands commands.\n\nThe update is out in beta for iPadOS 13.2, iOS 13.2, Apple tvOS 13.2, WatchOS 6.1 and MacOS 10.15.1.\n\nSome particulars of the new policy include:\n\nAn explicit opt-in.\n\nOnly Apple employees will be reviewing audio clips, not contractors.\n\nComputer generated transcripts are continuing to be used. These are in text form with no audio. They have been disassociated from identifying information by use of a random identifier.\n\nThese text transcripts, which Apple says include a small subset of requests may be reviewed by employees or contractors.\n\nAny user can opt-out at any time at Settings > Privacy > Analytics and Improvements, turn off \u201cImprove Siri and Dictation.\u201d\n\nApple is also launching a new Delete Siri and Dictation History feature. Users can go to Settings>Siri and Search>Siri History to delete all data Apple has on their Siri requests. If Siri data is deleted within 24 hours of making a request, the audio and transcripts will not be made available to grading.\n\nThe new policies can be found at Settings>Privacy>Analytics and Improvements>About Siri in the iOS 13.2 beta. A key section details how these segments are used:\n\nIf one of your Siri or Dictation interactions is selected for review, the request, as well as the response Siri provided, will be analyzed to determine accuracy and to generally improve Siri, Dictation, and natural language processing functionality in Apple products and services. Depending on the context of your request, Apple employees may review Siri Data directly relevant to the request, in order to grade the effectiveness of Siri\u2019s response. Only Apple employees, subject to strict confidentiality obligations, are able to access audio interactions with Siri and Dictation.\n\nThere seems to be a solid set of updates here for Siri protections and user concerns. The continued use of text transcripts that may be reviewed by contractors is one sticky point \u2014 but the fact that they are text, anonymized and separated from any background audio may appease some critics.\n\nThese were logical and necessary steps to make this process more clear to users \u2014 and to get an explicit opt-in for people who are fine with it happening.\n\nThe next logical update, in my opinion, would be a way for users to be able to see and hear the text and audio that Apple captures from their Siri requests. If you could see, say, your last 100 requests in text or by clip \u2014 the same information that may be reviewed by Apple employees or contractors, I think it would go a long way to dispelling the concerns that people have about this process.\n\nThis would fit with Apple\u2019s stated policy of transparency when it comes to user privacy on their platforms. Being able to see the same things other people are seeing about your personal data \u2014 even if they are anonymized \u2014 just seems fair.", "description": "Apple is rolling out a new opt-in notice for Siri audio sample review with the beta of iOS 13.2.
