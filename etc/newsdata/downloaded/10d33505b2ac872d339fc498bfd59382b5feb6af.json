And the video games industry takes the health and wellbeing of all players seriously, especially children.\n\n\"We encourage safe and sensible playing practices - such as encouraging regular breaks, offering robust parental controls to limit play time and recommending games as part of a balanced lifestyle - to ensure a healthy approach to play.\n\n\"But as with other activities and experiences people find enjoyable in life, we are aware that some individuals may play games to excess.\n\n\"The industry encourages those individuals to ask for help, both inside game communities and outside, to re-establish a healthy relationship with play. We look forward to continuing to work with the relevant authorities to further support player safety.\"\n\nThe Telegraph is campaigning for a statutory duty of care on gaming and social media firms to protect children from online harms.", "description": "The head of the health service has accused internet firms of \"cashing in\" on addiction, as he announced NHS plans to treat children with disorders caused by gaming and social media.", "authors": ["Laura Donnelly", "Health Editor", "William Hague", "Judith Woods"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/06/05/TELEMMGLPICT000162522988-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqlz5OdA_D3VmrC4drz6CMya9AwgQD4Npf3GkFJvgcOWM.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
