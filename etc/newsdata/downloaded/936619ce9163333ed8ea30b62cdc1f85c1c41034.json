The UK\u2019s ATM network, even ATMs inside or outside a Post Office branch, are run by different operators to the government-owned Post Office, which means they will be unaffected by the change.\n\nHowever, in some cases these ATMs may not be free-to-use, meaning customers who use them to take out cash will be charged for the privilege.\n\nOne in 10 free cash machines closed or started charging customers between January 2018 and May 2019, according to consumer group Which?.\n\nCan people still deposit cash?\n\nYes. Barclays said customers will still be able to deposit cheques and cash, and check balances, they just won't be able to withdraw funds.\n\nWhy are Barclays making these changes?\n\nBarclays said in its announcement that: 'As the bank focuses its investment into free-to use ATMs and cash-back at businesses as the most efficient way for cash withdrawals, it is also reducing related reliance on the Post Office.'\n\nThe news came alongside an announcement that the bank plans to introduce a cashback scheme from next year involving small businesses, and has pledged not to close branches in remote areas or where it is the last bank in town for the next two years.\n\nHowever, there is also the possibility that Barclays made the decision because it was worried about the bottom line.\n\nThis is because banks have to pay the Post Office a fee for each transaction they do, which is much higher than that they have to pay cash machine operators.\n\nEvery time a customer uses an ATM to withdraw money, the interchange fee is around 20p, while the arrangement banks have with the Post Office is nearer 95p.\n\nThat's quite a big difference when you consider 1.2million cash withdrawals are made this way a month by Barclays customers, according to Natalie Ceeney, the chair of the Access to Cash Review.\n\nThere has also been increasing concern that the taxpayer-owned Post Office is becoming a proxy bank, with big banks closing branches and directing customers to use Post Office branches instead.\n\nIn May a report from the Treasury Select Committee said taxpayers should not be subsidising banks' lack of branches at a loss, and proposed banks fund local 'banking hubs' in Post Office branches instead.\n\nWill other banks follow suit?\n\nNot in the foreseeable future.\n\nThis morning it was announced 28 banks, including the UK\u2019s other biggest high street names plus challenger banks Metro and Starling, have agreed a new three-year arrangement which will allow customers to access cash and cheque banking services at Post Office branches.\n\nThe Post Office's director of banking services Martin Kearsley said: 'We have been working with the banks to ensure we have the right service levels across our network to meet their customers' needs and to ensure our branches receive a fair remuneration for providing these vital services.\n\n'We're delighted to have signed this agreement with almost every UK bank, ensuring that their customers, no matter what their personal circumstances or location may be, can have convenient and secure access to everyday banking services such as cash withdrawals and deposits.'", "description": "Barclays announced on Monday that its customers would no longer be able to withdraw money over the counter using their debit cards or from savings accounts at any of Britain's Post Office branches.", "authors": ["George Nixon For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
