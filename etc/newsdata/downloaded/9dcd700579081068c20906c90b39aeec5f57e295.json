We were driving to hardware store Bunnings daily to get extra nails and screws!\"\n\nAbout two months into their friendship Nev decided to confess his feelings for Rachael while having coffee together in a local cafe.\n\n\"I\u2019ve got a mate who has feelings for someone much younger than him,\u2019 he said. \"He doesn\u2019t know if he should tell them..\"\n\n(Image: Medavia)\n\nRachael said: \"Neither of us had been in love before, but there was no mistaking our connection.\n\n\"Within a few days I\u2019d asked Nev to move in with me and Mum.\"\n\nShe added: \"Nev was worried, but he needn\u2019t have been, as Mum gave him a big hug.\n\n\"Nev and Mum got on like a house on fire \u2013 she particularly loved that my boyfriend was a whiz in the kitchen.\n\nRachael says their relationship became the talk of their small town - with a cruel rumour claiming she was a golddigger.\n\n\"Our family and friends were happy for us, and we were ecstatic - that\u2019s all that mattered\".\n\n(Image: Medavia)\n\n\"Every day with Nev was an adventure. We both loved fishing and swimming. And sometimes, when it rained, Nev would grab my hand and we\u2019d run outside and dance!\"\n\nLast November, Nev decided to pop the question after four years together.\n\n\"With Nev now 73, we want to say \u2018I do\u2019 as soon as we can. We\u2019ve been asking people to generously donate a venue, flowers, anything, to help us get our special day.\n\n\"Sadly, at Nev\u2019s age, we won\u2019t get a lifetime together.\n\n(Image: Medavia)\n\n\"Still, we\u2019d rather quality than quantity.\n\n\"If I fell pregnant, we\u2019d be ecstatic, but I know it\u2019s unlikely \u2013 and I\u2019ve made my peace with it. Nev\u2019s worth it.\n\n\"Our time together is precious and we won\u2019t waste a single second worrying what anyone thinks.\"", "description": "Rachael Roberts, 33, met partner Nev McDermott, 73, at a bus stop near her home in Anna Bay, New South Wales, Australia, four years ago", "authors": ["Beth Young", "Image", "Medavia"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20536565.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-THP_CHP_081019Slug_10485JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
