The company plans to link that data to customers\u2019 accounts and payment information, according to the report. It plan to start rolling out the technology to its Whole Foods store by early next next year, where new scanners would be able to identify customers by their hands and authorize their purchases, the Post reported.\n\nAmazon spokeswoman Amanda Felix declined to comment on the report.\n\nThe system will rely on depth scanning and computer vision technologies, according to the report. Amazon is pursuing it, because it promises to significantly speed up customer check-outs. Traditional credit card payment systems take about three to four seconds to process, but Amazon\u2019s hand-scanning system can process a payment in less than 300 milliseconds, the Post reported, citing an unnamed \u201cperson familiar with the project.\u201d\n\nRead this: Amazon\u2019s next-day shipping plan could boost sales by up to $24 billion\n\nTech companies have been developing and deploying sensors that can detect individuals by certain characteristics unique to them or their bodies for years now. In some cases, that information is already used to authorize payments.\n\nFor example, older versions of Apple\u2019s iPhones and iPads, for example, include fingerprint sensors, while newer ones include a sophisticated facial recognition system, and both systems can be used to approve payments. Other so-called biometric systems can recognize people by their irises or by their voices.\n\nSuch systems can be more secure and easier to use than passwords, because people don\u2019t have to remember them. However security experts worry that a compromise of such data can be far more dangerous than having passwords stolen. That\u2019s because unlike a password, a person\u2019s face or hand generally can\u2019t be changed.\n\nGot a tip about Amazon or another tech company?
