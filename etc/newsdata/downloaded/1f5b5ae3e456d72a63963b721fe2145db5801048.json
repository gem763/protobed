It says that \u201cduring the City Council hearings on the Ordinance, City officials made disparaging statements targeting groups that are predominantly minority and more likely to live in majority-minority areas.\u201d\n\nA council member allegedly said that while \u201cnot all people in Section 8 are bad people,\u201d Hesperia had \u201cissues with a lot of the Section 8 housing\u201d and the ordinance would \u201cstraighten things out,\u201d according to HUD. Low-income tenants can rent from private landlords with housing vouchers under HUD\u2019s Section 8 program.\n\n\u201cHUD is committed to ensuring that people can live where they choose free from discrimination,\u201d Carson said in an e-mail. \u201cWe are not going to allow minorities to be denied a place to call home simply because of how they appear. HUD will hold local communities accountable if they allow or create loopholes that evade our country\u2019s fair housing laws.\u201d\n\nHesperia officials and the San Bernardino County Sheriff\u2019s Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nCarson has come under fire in the past for his handling of fair housing issues. Civil rights groups unsuccessfully sued him last year over his decision to delay implementation of an Obama-era anti-discrimination rule, which Carson had previously likened to \u201csocial engineering\u201d in a 2015 op-ed.\n\nHUD also proposed a rule in August that would make it more difficult to bring discrimination claims under the Fair Housing Act by requiring plaintiffs to clear a higher bar to prove unintentional discrimination known as disparate impact.\n\nCritics have also noted that Carson uses the secretary-initiated complaint tool to crack down on discrimination more rarely than his predecessors. He initiated his first complaint in August 2018 \u2014 almost a year and a half after he assumed his post \u2014 a move that led to HUD charging Facebook with housing discrimination over its advertising practices in March.\n\nYet this isn\u2019t the first time Carson has gone after California government officials for discrimination. The department in July threatened to withhold $80 million in federal funding from Los Angeles over the city\u2019s alleged discrimination against people with disabilities. HUD and L.A. reached a deal in August to improve disability access in city housing.\n\nHesperia\u2019s crime-free ordinance, meanwhile, has already been challenged in court.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of Southern California filed suit against the city and San Bernardino County Sheriff John McMahon in 2016. The group alleged that \u201crather than participate in statewide efforts to safely reintegrate individuals with criminal records into the community, defendants have enacted and enforced municipal ordinances designed to exclude such individuals from housing in the city.\u201d\n\nA year later, the Hesperia City Council amended its \u201cCrime Free Rental Housing Program\u201d to make the program voluntary, the Victorville, Calif., Daily Press reported. Hesperia agreed to pay nearly half a million dollars to settle the ACLU suit in April 2018.\n\nHUD\u2019s charge, which seeks damages and \u201cthe maximum civil penalty,\u201d will be heard by a U.S. administrative law judge.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/17/0d/2d06138f4537af45914e53a2e11d/19912-ben-carson-gty-772.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
