Biles hit a clean routine and scored 15.066 points, distancing defending champion Liu Tingting of China by .633 of a point.\n\nAnother Chinese, Li Shijia, took bronze, three tenths ahead of American Kara Eaker in fourth.\n\nBiles, now a record-extending 18-time world champion, later competes in the floor exercise final, looking to tie the record for most world titles (five) on one apparatus (Yuri Chechi, rings, and Svetlana Khorkina, uneven bars).\n\nBut Biles stands alone in total medals, passing 1990s Belarusian Vitaly Scherbo on Sunday. Biles did it more efficiently than Scherbo, competing one fewer year and with fewer medal chances (women compete on four apparatuses; men six).\n\nShe was uncharacteristically exuberant upon seeing her beam score, leaping out of her chair. Perhaps that should have been unexpected. Biles grabbed the beam to keep her balance in her last two global finals in Rio and at the 2018 World Championships, taking bronze each time.\n\nShe said on Saturday that if she could only have one medal from the apparatus finals at the Tokyo Olympics, it would be on beam.\n\nAlso Sunday, Russians Nikita Nagornyy and Artur Dalaloyan went one-two on vault, just as they did in Friday\u2019s all-around. Nagornyy earned his third gold of the meet.\n\nOlympicTalk is on Apple News.
