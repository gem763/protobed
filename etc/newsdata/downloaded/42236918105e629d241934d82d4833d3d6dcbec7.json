The world is on fire.\"\n\nTRUMP'S DORAL RESORT TO HOST NEXT G-7 SUMMIT, AS WHITE HOUSE DEFENDS CHOICE\n\n\"It is beyond my imagination why this administration thought ... to do it at all, given the criticism that the president will receive for using one of his own properties for an event like this,\" Stirewalt added.\n\n\"That\u2019s an unnecessary problem [for Trump] to create for himself.\"\n\nDuring a rare and contentious White House press briefing, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney tried to assuage concerns about \"emoluments violations\" by telling the media that Trump will not make any money off the event. He said the golf club will be providing the location and services at cost.\n\nTRUMP CELEBRATES 'GREAT DAY FOR CIVILIZATION' AS PENCE, POMPEO SECURE SYRIA CEASE-FIRE AGREEMENT\n\nEarlier Thursday, Trump declared a \"great day for civilization\" after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Vice President Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo helped forge a cease-fire agreement amid violence between Turkish forces and the Kurds in northern Syria.\n\nStirewalt said he saw the meeting itself as \"progress.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Given the reporting that we have read ... after all we'd heard from Erdogan -- for him to take the meeting is probably progress,\" he said, adding that it remains to be seen whether long-term peace will come to the region.\n\n\"It's probably progress in the direction of 'how do we put Humpty Dumpty back together here a little bit', and move in that direction,\" Stirewalt remarked.\n\nFox News' Andrew O'Reilly contributed to this report.", "description": "Fox News digital politics editor Chris Stirewalt panned the White House's announcement that\u00a0President Trump will host next year's\u00a0G-7 Summit at his Trump National Doral Miami resort.", "authors": ["Charles Creitz"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/Stirewalt-trump.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
