Martha McSally Walks Careful Line on Guns Ahead of 2020", "language": "en", "text": "GOODYEAR, Ariz.\u2014To open a meeting of local Republicans here last week, Butch Kuentzler had this message: \u201cRed flag\u201d laws, which allow families and law enforcement to remove guns from people deemed dangerous, are unconstitutional.\n\nThose laws are at the center of the current gun-policy debate, whose complicated politics are expected to dominate the legislative agenda when Congress returns to Washington next week from a recess scarred by a string of mass shootings.\n\nRed flag measures have been buoyed by scattered Republican support, but some Democrats have dismissed them as insufficient on their own, and conservatives remain skeptical of them. That leaves some Republicans\u2014including Arizona Sen. Martha McSally, who faces a tough election in 2020 and has said she is open to reviewing such measures\u2014hemmed in between core gun-rights supporters and a growing suburban population backing gun control.\n\nWith a Republican challenger in the race, Ms. McSally will likely have to address the issue during the primary season, even as her campaign plans to stay away from it in the general election.\n\nRelated Video Seven people died and many more were injured in the West Texas cities of Midland and Odessa after a shooter began randomly firing at people Saturday.

Gabrielle Giffords, barely survived a 2011 assassination attempt. In his campaign, he is broadening the range of issues he discusses, emphasizing his background as an astronaut.\n\nGOP Sen.

But Mr. McCarthy\u2019s candidacy could make it a key issue in the GOP primary.\n\nMr. McCarthy\u2019s upstart campaign could pose a familiar challenge to Ms. McSally, whose bruising primary last year weakened her before her loss to Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D., Ariz.). Just over a month later, Ms. McSally was named by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey to serve the next two years of the late GOP Sen. John McCain\u2019s term.\n\nMr. McCarthy last week canceled a meeting with Mr. Ducey, pointing to the governor\u2019s revival of a statewide red flag proposal that had stalled following opposition from GOP legislators and pro-gun groups.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS How do you think the gun-control debate will affect the Senate GOP primary and general election in Arizona? Join the conversation below.\n\nTop GOP officials, including Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, called Mr. McCarthy to discourage him from running, and President Trump tweeted his endorsement of Ms. McSally in June.\n\nBonnie Jansson, a 72-year-old who enjoys target practice with her purple .22 Ruger, said that while she is a committed Republican, Ms. McSally could lose her vote if she supported red flag legislation. \u201cPeople need to get educated and not just think with their emotions,\u201d she said.\n\nMs. McSally will need to woo more than just traditional GOP voters like Ms. Jansson in 2020. An August poll of 600 likely Arizona voters by Phoenix-based data firm OH Predictive Insights showed that 54% believed Arizona gun laws weren\u2019t strict enough, while 37% said they should be kept where they are.\n\nSupport in rapidly growing Maricopa County, which spans Phoenix and its suburbs, will be central to winning Arizona. Ms. McSally lost the historically Republican area to Ms. Sinema in 2018. Since the shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, Ms. McSally has focused on a bill that would make domestic terrorism\u2014a classification that is sometimes applied to such assaults\u2014a federal crime, though some suburban voters want to see more done.\n\nLaura Huber, 55, a registered nurse from Peoria, Ariz., lists gun control\u2014including expanding background checks\u2014as one of her top political issues. A Democrat who became more politically involved after Mr. Trump\u2019s election, Ms. Huber said a gun had recently been found in a student\u2019s locker at a local high school.\n\n\u201cYou know, you think it\u2019ll never happen, and everyone says that, until it does,\u201d she said. \u201cI know at this point if I go to Harkins or go to Target, if I get shot, people will say, \u2018Oh, isn\u2019t that terrible?\u2019 And that will be it.\u201d\n\nDemocrat Mark Kelly, pictured with his wife, former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, launched his bid for the Senate earlier this year in Phoenix.

As a Senate candidate in Arizona, he is taking a measured approach to the issue.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a gun owner. I\u2019m a supporter of the Second Amendment. But we need some stronger federal gun laws,\u201d Mr. Kelly said at an elementary school in Prescott, Ariz. \u201cThere are other issues that affect Arizona and that Washington has failed the people of Arizona on.\u201d\n\nAndy Barr, a Democratic strategist who has worked for a number of Arizona Democrats, advises candidates he works for to take a similar tack. \u201cThe phrase that I never want any of my candidates using is \u2018gun control,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cThere are a lot of people in Arizona who buy into the old Western myth of people walking around with a pistol in their holster. That\u2019s not going to change anytime soon.\u201d\n\nJennifer Longdon, who was paralyzed roughly 15 years ago when she was randomly shot in the back while driving, said Mr. Kelly\u2019s public persona is inextricably intertwined with gun control.\n\n\u201cMark Kelly cannot walk into a room without his stance on gun-violence policy going with him, whether he voices it in that space or not,\u201d said Ms. Longdon, now a Democratic state representative in Arizona. \u201cSo we\u2019re leading with gun violence simply by living our lives.\u201d\n\nWrite to Andrew Duehren at andrew.duehren@wsj.com", "description": "Arizona GOP Sen.
