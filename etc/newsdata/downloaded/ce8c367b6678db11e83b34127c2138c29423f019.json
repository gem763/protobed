Wait till you see the rest of it. (Image: Legion M/Screen Media)\n\nEverything about Alien is iconic. That goes for the alien itself; the movie\u2019s scares, like the chest-burster; the lead performance by Sigourney Weaver; and even its simplistic poster and tagline: \u201cIn space no one can hear you scream.\u201d It\u2019s all so well known that it\u2019s not an easy task to try and be in the same league, let alone match it.\n\nHowever, that was the task posed to the team behind the new documentary Memory: The Origins of Alien. After premiering at Sundance earlier this year, the doc was picked up by Screen Media and the fan-owned entertainment company Legion M.\n\nThose fans helped decided on the film\u2019s theatrical poster, which we're excited to debut below.\n\nThe poster for Memory: The Origins of Alien. (Image: Legion M/Screen Media)\n\nAs you can see the poster, designed by Gravillis, takes the legendary visage of the Xenomorph, designed by H.R. Giger, and surrounds it with notes and sketches, just like Ridley Scott may have made when he was directing the 1979 classic. It\u2019s a strong representation of the documentary, which promises to dive deep into the making of Alien with tons of new footage and behind the scenes information.\n\nDirected by Alexandre O. Philippe, Memory: The Origins of Alien will be playing Fantastic Fest in Texas next week, and will open in select theatres in the U.S. and hit VOD on October 5.\n\nEditor's Note: It's currently unclear whether the VOD will be available for our Australian audience.", "description": "Everything about Alien is iconic.
