With 29 unanswered points to Wales\u2019 name, their World Cup opener against Georgia threatened to be a walkover.\n\nBut, then, something curious happened: the Georgians stirred into life. Who knows what was said down deep in the bowels of the City of Toyota Stadium, but after the restart the flow of the game changed. Suddenly there was resistance, there was spirit, there was a refusal to roll over and submit to Wales\u2019 free-flowing, penetrative style of rugby.\n\nThe hits came thick and fast. Justin Tipuric, no shrinking violet, was picked up and thrown backwards, a paper bag caught in the wind. Alun Wyn Jones, a mountain of a man, was placed on his backside in the centre of the park. Even George North was not immune to the new-found ferocity of the Georgians. He found himself subject to a well-executed tackle from Georgia\u2019s 9, Vasil Lobzhanidze, who shunted the Welsh wing a good few yards backwards upon the point of collision.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Yes, Wales added 14 more points to their own scoreline before the game was up, but the manner in which their opponents, ranked 13th in the world, were allowed back into this match didn\u2019t go unnoticed by Warren Gatland.\n\n\u201cIt was a good first half but we were a bit messy in the second and the ball was a bit slippery,\u201d he said afterwards. \u201dGeorgia came pretty hard at us in the second half and defended a bit better. To concede those two tries was disappointing.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Rugby World Cup most iconic pictures Show all 36 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

The fluidity and clinical edge of the Welsh backline was, at times, world class, coming into play for a number of the side\u2019s tries. The first, after just two minutes, was a glowing example of this, Jonathan Davies driving hard and true through a gaping hole in the Georgian defence after a fine pass from Gareth Davies.\n\nSo too the fourth. It was a stunning display of attacking flair that involved a No 9 wrap-around, some hard running from Jonathan Davies and a well-taken pick-up by Liam Williams. This was Wales at their absorbing best as they carved upon the hapless Georgian defence, pulling it apart from top to tail like a cheese string.\n\nBut once Georgia found their feet, it was a different game. The high line enforced by the men in purple began to draw mistakes from their opponents, with balls dropped and momentum-changing tackles made in the heart of midfield.\n\nThe Welsh set-piece, in particular, found itself buckling under periods of sustained pressure. The threat posed by the Georgian scrummagers was known beforehand \u2013 but that mattered for little as Mikheil Nariashvili and Beka Gigashvili reaped havoc in the front line.\n\nGeorgia\u2019s second try of the match came as a result of their efforts, the two men boring in against their opponents to force the penalty, which was quickly followed by a tap-and-go, three phrases of play and, finally, the touch down by Levan Chilachava.\n\nWales were similarly targeted at the line-out. Georgia\u2019s first try came as a result of back-to-back throw-ins, with Gatland\u2019s men unable to stave off the rolling mass of purple shirts flooding forward against their white line. It was Shalva Mamukashvili who drew blood, crashing over on 44 minutes to set up a more testing second half.\n\nWales came through the challenge, as was to be expected, but against the likes of South Africa, New Zealand and Australia, they\u2019ll be aware that these vulnerabilities will pose a serious threat to their hopes of success here in Japan. Only once they iron out their flaws will the Welsh be able to stand their own against the game\u2019s very best.", "description": "As the two teams trotted into the changing rooms at half time, the scoreboard made for a worrying read for those clad in purple. With 29 unanswered points to Wales\u2019 name, their World Cup opener against\u00a0Georgia threatened to be a walkover.", "authors": ["Samuel Lovett"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/23/14/Warren-Gatland.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
