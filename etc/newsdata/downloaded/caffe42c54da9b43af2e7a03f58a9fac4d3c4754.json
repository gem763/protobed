Like most leftists who disrespect the Second Amendment, he also promotes hollowing out the First Amendment as well.\"\n\nBUTTIGIEG DEFENDS RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS, HITS BETO FOR THREATENING TO RESCIND THEIR TAX-EMEPT STATUS\n\nO'Rourke was also criticized for his First Amendment views by fellow candidate Pete Buttigieg on Sunday during an interview with \"State of the Union.\" Buttigieg said O'Rourke's remarks were tantamount to going to war with churches and religious institutions.\n\n\"The idea that you are going to strip churches of their tax-exempt status if they haven\u2019t found their way toward blessing same-sex marriage, I\u2019m not sure [O'Rourke] understood the implications of what he was saying,\" he said.\n\n\"That means going to war, not only with churches, but I would think with mosques and a lot of organizations that may not have the same view of various religious principles that I do.\"\n\nCortes also highlighted the tenor of the live audience at the forum and said they are representative of the radical left's inability to compromise.\n\nHe wrote, \"As for the audience at the CNN forum, their behavior also showcased an important reality. The 'woke' leftist mob cannot be placated with anything short of total submission to their agenda.\"\n\nDEMOCRATS USING INTEL COMMITTEE TO KEEP IMPEACHMENT FACTS HIDDEN FROM THE PUBLIC, SAYS WSJ'S KIM STRASSEL\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Numerous program interruptions and agitations from audience members encapsulated the true extremism of the social justice warrior movement,\" Cortes added.\n\n\"For these militants, legal gay marriage is hardly enough. After all, Donald Trump was the first candidate ever elevated to the presidency who supported same-sex marriage, and yet he is still persistently pilloried by these fanatics.\"", "description": "CNN's LGBTQ forum revealed the fringe elements of the Democratic\u00a0party on Friday and showcased the\u00a0\"radical leftist mob\" that makes up its\u00a0constituency, network contributor Steve Cortes wrote in a Monday op-ed.", "authors": ["Nick Givas", "Nick Givas Is A Reporter With Fox News.
