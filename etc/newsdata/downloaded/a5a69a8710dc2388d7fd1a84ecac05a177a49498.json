Is that near Buckingham Palace/the Scottish Highlands/the obscure village in Devon I once visited when I was five and now expect you to know about because to me England is the size of Greenwich Village?\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nSo far, so normal. Then comes the inevitable: \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know London. Because I\u2019m Irish, so.\u201d\n\nThe first time this happened to me, I genuinely thought there must be an east coast American dialect that sounded almost identical to the one spoken in some small part of the Republican of Ireland. In fact, I even thought that the second time it happened. The fifth time, however, you start to smell a rat. You do the same thing they did to you: \u201cBut whereabouts in Ireland?\u201d you say, after which they might wave a hand nervously and reply, \u201cOh, you know. The south.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Cork, is it? Or Kilkenny?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you know\u2026\u201d They\u2019ll smile again and say, \u201cMy family is from round Dublin.\u201d Because, I mean, it\u2019s always Dublin, isn\u2019t it?\n\nThe trick is not to stop your line of questioning there, otherwise you might naively walk away thinking that you\u2019ve met someone whose mother hails from Limerick and met her husband at Trinity College before immigrating to New York. \u201cWhich family member?\u201d you\u2019ll have to ask, and eventually they\u2019ll tell you the truth: \u201cFifteen generations back, we saw we had a cousin whose surname was O\u2019Malley and we presume they probably came from that part of the world.\u201d\n\nA lot of people will happily claim they\u2019re Swedish, Swiss or Italian \u2026 there are entire traditions based around these identities which have little or nothing to do with the actual traditions of the original country\n\nThis interrogation method is absolutely not a way to make friends. But it is one which will save you a lot of time asking your friend from yoga whether her mum is \u201cmaking the trip over from Dublin this year for Christmas\u201d when actually their more-American-than-apple-pie mother, who has never even so much as thought about owning a passport, will be hosting Christmas dinner at the same brownstone in Brooklyn she was born in 55 years ago\n\nIt doesn\u2019t just happen with Irish heritage: a lot of people will happily claim they\u2019re Swedish, Swiss or Italian as well (oddly, I\u2019ve never found someone claim they\u2019re English \u2014 or Spanish.) Additionally, there are entire traditions based around these identities which have little or nothing to do with the actual traditions of the original country.\n\nFor instance: \u201cgravy Sundays\u201d, a weekend ritual enjoyed by Italian American families, where everyone comes together to eat meatball marinara and refers to the tomato sauce as \u201cgravy\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s an old Italian thing,\u201d one of my Italian American friends told me, the, when confronted with the truth \u2014 that no Italian born and bred in Italy would know what the hell you were talking about if you said you wanted some of their best gravy spaghetti \u2014 merely shrugged and said, \u201cItalian American, then. Anyway, we don\u2019t know if my family is actually Italian. We\u2019re just a mixture and we liked that one best.\u201d\n\nTo someone who grew up in Europe, this habit of wearing picking and choosing different national identities looks completely bizarre \u2014 why can nobody inside the United States of America call themselves American when asked? Considering the country\u2019s huge commitment to patriotism, it seems like a strange act of cognitive dissonance.\n\nBut you have to remember that the US of A is a very young country, where people will still point to a building and tell you, in a hushed and reverent tone, \u201cThat building is from way back in the 1940s. Can you believe it?\u201d You can choose to be petulant and to insist that someone who has never travelled outside of New York City doesn\u2019t really count as \u201cauthentically Swedish\u201d, of course. Or you can just smile, nod and take the high road by writing an article in a national newspaper about how they don\u2019t understand their own heritage.", "description": "In America, you have this exact conversation a lot: \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d someone who clearly grew up in the States will ask you, when they hear you order a coffee or a bagel or a slice of pizza the size of your head at some opportune moment. \u201cOh, I\u2019m from England,\u201d you\u2019ll say, shrugging as if I\u2019m some sort of personal defect you couldn\u2019t quite shake, because that\u2019s what", "authors": ["Holly Baxter"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/08/13/british-flag-new-york-081019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
