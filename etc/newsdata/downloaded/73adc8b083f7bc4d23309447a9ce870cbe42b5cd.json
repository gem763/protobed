But a refueling deal with the US government is keeping the airport afloat, to the tune of $17.3 million since August of 2016. And Trump's resort has reportedly made nearly $200,000 from overnight stays by Air Force crews since he took office, renewing concerns among lawmakers.\n\nThe refueling deal was signed under President Barack Obama, but it came into significant use under Trump, with the number of stopovers at Prestwick growing from 156 in 2016, to 259 just through August of this year.\n\nTwo hundred and twenty of the stopovers have required overnight stays, The New York Times reports, citing the Department of Defense, up from 75 in 2016. Employees at Prestwick book hotel rooms for the military crews that arrive in C-130 Hercules transport aircraft, but they don't all go to Trump Turnberry \u2014 there are budget options right beside the airport \u2014 \"Turnberry is generally booked only if other hotels are unavailable or if customers specifically request it,\" Michael Matheson, the Scottish transport minister, told Scottish Parliament earlier this week.\n\nRead more: The Air Force says its crew stayed at Trump's luxury resort because it was the 'closest available and least expensive' option\n\nBut, according to Turnberry staffers who requested anonymity, a surprising number of military personnel do. According to Politico, the Air Force has spent nearly $200,000 on approximately three dozen stays at Trump's resort since August 2017, just months after he took office. In a letter to Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, Chairman of the House Oversight Committee Elijah Cummings and Rep. Jamie Raskin, who are both Maryland Democrats, expressed concern that the sum paid for \"hundreds of nights of rooms \u2014 all after the President was sworn into office.\"\n\nThe House Oversight Committee has been investigating the stays since April amid concerns that they violate the domestic emoluments clause, which bars the president from earning any money from the federal government besides a salary.\n\nTrump has denied any involvement in the military crews at his resort, tweeting, \"They have good taste!\"\n\nWhile military personnel get a discounted rate at the Trump resort \u2014 as little as $130 per night, compared to about $380 per night\u2014 they must abide by the Defense Travel System, which gives personnel a $166 per diem for accommodations. It's unclear how many military personnel have stayed at Trump Turnberry, but The New York Times found that the State Department had paid the resort \u2014 which lost $4.2 million in 2017 \u2014 at least $64,000 over the past two years, some of which may have been refunded.\n\nThe Air Force has launched an investigation into the way airmen select lodging in the wake of the scandal, which found that Trump Turnberry has also hosted 40 US Air Force crews since 2015, although it's unknown how many total military members stayed there, or how many crews have lodged there since Trump came into office in 2017, Politico reports.\n\nAir Force secretary nominee Barbara Barrett told the Senate Armed Services Committee that she would \"take a look at\" service members staying at Trump properties, but didn't outright say she would prohibit the practice, Politico reported.", "description": "259 military crews refueled at Scotland's Prestwick Airport in 2019, the closest one to Trump's struggling resort. 40 Air Force crews lodged there.", "authors": ["Ellen Ioanes"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d7ab28f2e22af04cf30bf24?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
