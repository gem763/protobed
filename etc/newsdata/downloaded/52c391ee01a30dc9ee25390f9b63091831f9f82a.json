The match ended in the early hours with the Scot in tears after a marathon victory.\n\nThis time Murray broke straightaway, and although he was broken back for 2-2 he quickly repeated it, standing in aggressively to receive and attacking his opponent's second serve.\n\nHe was cruising to victory at 5-3 in the second before playing his worst game of the match to be pulled back, and then had a match point at 7-6 in the tiebreak against an opponent who had suddenly become inspired.\n\nMurray, for whom the Antwerp event is his fourth straight tournament, showed the greater experience in the end by breaking at 4-4, serving it out at the second attempt.\n\nMurray will now meet 21-year-old Frenchman Ugo Humbert, ranked 70, who upset fifth seed Guido Pella in three sets.", "description": "MIKE DICKSON IN ANTWERP: The 32 year-old Scot will play his first semi-final since the 2017 French Open after overcoming Romania's Marius Copil 6-3 6-7 6-4 in two hours and 35 minutes.", "authors": ["Mike Dickson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/23/19905396-0-image-a-30_1571436168589.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
