For Hillary Clinton in 2016, it was her \u201cdamn emails.\u201d Remembering those failed Democratic presidential campaigns, Joe Biden is determined not to get \u201cUkrained\u201d in 2020.\n\nSince a whistleblower report last week revealed that President Donald Trump asked Ukrainian officials to investigate Biden, the former vice president has struck an aggressive tone.\n\nHe has told supporters that he would beat Trump \u201clike a drum\u201d in a general election and that the Republican president is scared of that possibility. Biden has demanded that reporters \u201cask the right questions\u201d and accused Trump of trying to \u201chijack\u201d the campaign with unfounded assertions that Biden and his son Hunter had corrupt dealings in Ukrainian business and politics.\n\nBiden has built his campaign around the idea that he can return Washington to a more stable pre-Trump era. But Biden\u2019s ability to win will turn on his ability to navigate the turbulent, no-holds-barred vortex that Trump has imposed on American politics with his Twitter megaphone, deep well of campaign cash and phalanx of surrogates.\n\nAnd while many Democratic strategists and Biden supporters give him plaudits for pushback, there remain some worries about how the storyline might affect Biden\u2019s tenuous front-runner status.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a no-win situation,\u201d said Karen Finney, an adviser to Clinton in 2016, when the former secretary of state was besieged with media scrutiny and Trump criticism over her use of a private email server when she ran the State Department.\n\nFinney credited the Biden campaign for \u201cworking the refs\u201d by sending detailed memos to the media explaining the timeline of Hunter Biden\u2019s service on a Ukrainian energy company board and Joe Biden\u2019s involvement in Ukraine as vice president and for pressuring television executives not to give a platform to Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal attorney.\n\nGiuliani has alleged that Biden, while vice president, tried to quash a Ukrainian investigation of the company that paid Hunter Biden as a board member. The top Ukrainian prosecutor said earlier this year that his team found no wrongdoing, and there\u2019s no evidence that U.S. law enforcement has gotten involved.\n\nTrump, nonetheless, raised his theory in a July telephone conversation with the new Ukrainian president, asking Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Bidens anew. That move, now the center of a formal whistleblower complaint and the House impeachment inquiry, could be found to violate U.S. law making it a crime to solicit or accept foreign contributions in an American election.\n\n\u201cThis is about Donald Trump, not Joe Biden,\u201d said Barry Goodman, a Michigan attorney and major Biden donor.\n\nBut a media cacophony can smother any argument, Finney said, pointing back to Clinton and to Kerry\u2019s 2004 campaign. Kerry, a Vietnam War veteran who\u2019d earned a Silver Star, Bronze Star and three Purple Hearts for his service, was criticized in the summer of 2004 by a group of Vietnam veterans who \u2013 contrary to military records \u2013 questioned the service accounts that resulted in his recognition. Kerry was later admonished for not aggressively counterattacking the \u201cSwift Boat Veterans for Truth,\u201d despite his campaign releasing his military records.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a tough situation,\u201d Finney said, putting the onus on the media \u201cto not get sucked in.\u201d\n\nGoodman, the Biden donor, said he\u2019s pleased with the campaign\u2019s strategy. But he said there are other ways to stay on offense \u2013 and not necessarily against Trump. Biden must also push back against Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, his chief progressive rivals for the Democratic nomination.\n\n\u201cMany Democrats are scared \u2026 of \u2018Medicare for All\u2019 and losing their private health insurance,\u201d Goodman said, referring to single-payer health insurance proposals from Sanders and Warren. Goodman noted an ongoing United Auto Workers strike in Michigan. \u201cThose people are striking to keep the health care they have,\u201d he said, recommending that Biden go to Michigan and turn the issue around on his primary rivals.\n\nInterviews with Democratic voters in early primary states make clear Biden\u2019s challenge.\n\n\u201cI think that a certain amount of dirt will stick to him, even if it shouldn\u2019t,\u201d said Lee Williams, 69, of Fort Mill, South Carolina. A retired Navy officer, Williams backs Warren, even though he says his politics align with the more centrist Biden. \u201cThe fact is,\u201d Williams says, \u201cthat truth doesn\u2019t matter to Trump, so on the campaign trail, all you will hear is Biden, corruption, Ukraine.\u201d\n\nIn New Hampshire, Ellen Bowles, a 71-year-old retired middle school teacher, said she is uncomfortable with people using their influence even if there\u2019s no wrongdoing. Biden had been her second choice among Democrats behind Warren, but that\u2019s no longer the case.\n\n\u201cI think (Biden\u2018s) going to have to talk a lot more about what his son was doing in Ukraine,\u201d Bowles said. \u201cI just feel that he\u2019s going to get tainted by that somehow.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "John Kerry got \"Swift Boated\" in 2004.
