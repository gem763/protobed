Not only that, but 247,000 more teaching jobs should have been created to keep up with growing student enrollment as the population increases.\n\nThis has resulted in a shortfall of 307,000 teaching jobs \u2014 meaning there are over 300,000 educators currently needed right now.\n\nThe data sheds light on an ongoing national teacher shortage. Back in 2008, teaching jobs increased at the same pace as student enrollment. Since the Great Recession, or after 60,000 jobs were lost, job creation in education never kept pace with the growing student enrollment.\n\nRead more: Teachers in the US are spending $500 of their own money on school supplies like crayons and chalk, and now they're turning to a viral hashtag to ask strangers for help\n\nOther data centers have similarly staggering estimates of the teacher shortage crisis. The independent research group Learning Policy Institute estimated a 112,000 teacher shortage in 2018.\n\nThe study uses data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics analyzed by the liberal think-tank Economic Policy Institute. Educator jobs include mostly K-12 public school teachers, but also administrators, guidance counselors, and paraeducator.\n\nAmerica's teachers say they're underpaid and overworked \u2014 and they're fighting back.\n\nElise Gould, senior economist at EPI and author of the report, attributed the shortfall to dwindling wages and decreased funding for public education.\n\nTeachers are paid an average of $60,000, though the rate varies depending on which state they work or the type of school. For context, that's the average salary of a personal trainer or event planner, as Business Insider's Melanie Weir points out.\n\n\"I think that when we think about any jobs that you want to fill, I think you need to pay more to get the qualified teachers that you want,\" Elise Gould, senior economist at EPI and author of the report, told Business Insider. \"That means dedicating more money into school budgets to make sure students are getting the teachers that they need.\"\n\nBut the barrier to entry for teachers is pricey, as all states require they have at least a bachelor's degree. While the cost of college soars (as does student loan debt), school teachers earn nearly 21% less on average than other professions that require a college degree. Thirty years ago, the pay gap was just 2% less.\n\nMany teachers work multiple jobs to make ends meet, according to the Pew Research Center. Over two dozen teacher revealed to Business Insider that they spend as much as $1,000 of their own money on school supplies that should be provided by administration.\n\nGovernment public school funding has also declined: 29 states provided overall less state funding for students in 2015 than they did in 2008, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nSome states have responded to the shortage by hiring more substitute teachers, but these positions require much less training than full-time educators. Some states just require they be over 18 with a high school degree. Other schools are turning to international teachers to fill the gaps, CNN reported.\n\nTeachers had gotten so fed up with the low wages and insufficient funding that they went on a nationwide strike in 2018, resulting in some wage growth and increased funding for individual states. Yet the gains may not be enough \u2014 talks loom of a potential strike in Chicago and Colorado as early as next week, the CBS and the Colorado Sun reported.\n\nIf you are a teacher with a story to tell, email aakhtar@businessinsider.com.\n\nThe 15 worst US states to be a teacher\n\nPublic-school teachers reveal the 7 hardest things about their job\n\n11 shocking things about being a teacher that you'd never thought to ask\n\n31 teachers across the US reveal their exact salary, and how much of it goes to paying for school supplies like chalk and pencils\n\nTeachers reveal the 7 things they wish they could tell parents \u2014 but can't", "description": "Teachers have gone on strike in years past calling for higher wages and more funding \u2014 and new strikes may be on the horizon next week.", "authors": ["Allana Akhtar"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d6e80b62e22af19ae334aa8?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
