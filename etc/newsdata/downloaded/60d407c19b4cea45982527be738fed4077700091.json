Every country has problems. But from what I see, I believe they are trying to make a change.\u201d\n\nBut the decision ultimately came down to money.\n\nJoshua earned $25 million for the first fight, compared with $7 million for Ruiz. Hearn said both fighters will earn significantly more for the rematch, but declined to offer specifics.\n\nWhen pressed again for details, Hearn smiled. \u201cA lot,\u201d he said.\n\nGolf\u2019s European Tour, auto racing\u2019s Formula E and World Wrestling Entertainment have all held major events in Saudi Arabia in the past year. Saudi organizers recently announced plans to stage the world\u2019s richest horse race\u2014with a prize purse of $20 million\u2014in February and have had discussions with Formula One officials about a race in 2021.\n\nJoshua says he has heard the concerns from fans at home in London and on social media. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing that we are talking about it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are making progress.\u201d\n\nAlthough Ruiz now holds three major heavyweight belts (WBA, IBF and WBO), he had little leverage in negotiations, since the contract he signed for the first bout contained a rematch clause that allowed Joshua and Hearn to dictate terms.\n\n\u201cWhen he signed the contract, he was the happiest man in the world. And when he won the fight, he thought it was a bad deal,\u201d Hearn said.\n\nRuiz said he would have preferred to have the rematch in the U.S., and didn\u2019t want to fight Joshua in the United Kingdom, so that made Saudi Arabia a palatable neutral site.\n\n\u201cAt first, I was a little iffy [about going to Saudi Arabia], but as soon as I got there, it was different. It was beautiful out there. Beautiful people,\u201d Ruiz said.\n\nWrite to Jim Chairusmi at jim.chairusmi@wsj.com", "description": "Anthony Joshua and Andy Ruiz will battle for the heavyweight title in Saudi Arabia on Dec. 7.", "authors": ["Jim Chairusmi", "Jim.Chairusmi Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-104549/social", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
