But they warned that regulatory hurdles still threaten any deal.\n\nExchange concerns\n\nHKEX HKXCF LSE chairman Don Robert said the exchange was \"surprised and disappointed\" thatpublished its \"unsolicited proposal within two days of our receiving it.\"\n\nThe unexpected bid was published Wednesday, suggesting that LSE received the offer on Monday.\n\nThe transaction posed serious risks and lacked value for shareholders, Robert said in a letter addressed to the chairperson and CEO of HKEX.\n\nHKEX's relationship with the Hong Kong government would \"complicate matters,\" making it \"highly uncertain\" that necessary approvals would be obtained, Robert said.\n\nThe Hong Kong government directly appoints half of the HKEX board, according to its website. And the chairman's appointment must be approved by Hong Kong's chief executive, Carrie Lam.\n\nRobert also raised concerns about continued social unrest in Hong Kong, saying the \"ongoing situation\" in the territory adds to uncertainty.\n\nFor shareholders, the proposition was unattractive given that they would be paid mostly in HKEX shares, Robert said.\n\n\"We see the value of your share consideration as inherently uncertain,\" said Robert. \"Furthermore, we question the sustainability of HKEX's position as a strategic gateway in the longer term.\"\n\nThe proposal would be a \"backward step\" for LSE strategically, given the high geographic concentration of HKEX's portfolio.\n\n\"We do not believe HKEX provides us with the best long-term positioning in Asia or the best listing/trading platform for China,\" he said, noting that LSE values its current partnership with the Shanghai Stock Exchange.\n\nEven if the proposal were deliverable, it fell \"substantially short\" of an appropriate valuation for a takeover of LSE, \"especially when compared to the significant value we expect to create through our planned acquisition of Refinitiv,\" Robert said.\n\nHKEX's offer was conditional on LSE terminating its proposed acquisition of Refinitiv, announced only last month. That \u00a322 billion ($27 billion) deal is aimed at transforming the LSE into a global markets and information juggernaut to rival Michael Bloomberg's financial data empire.\n\nLSE's forceful rejection was aimed at discouraging HKEX from pursuing the deal any further, rather than dissuading a third party from getting involved, Chris Turner, an analyst at Berenberg told CNN Business.\n\nBerenberg has previously highlighted CME and Intercontinental Exchange, which owns the New York Stock Exchange, as other potential suitors. ICE had previously mulled a bid for LSE in 2016.\n\nPamela Boykoff contributed reporting.", "description": "The London Stock Exchange has roundly rejected Hong Kong's $37 billion takeover bid.", "authors": ["Hanna Ziady", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190911095700-01-lse-0829-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
