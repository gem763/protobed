The Apple TV app is now available on three different models of Fire TV devices \u2014 the Fire TV Stick 4K, the Fire TV Stick (2nd Gen), and the Fire TV Basic Edition \u2014 with support for more models coming soon.\n\nThe app will allow you to watch shows from Apple\u2019s streaming service, Apple TV Plus, which will launch on November 1st. But it also has perks for non-subscribers: it\u2019ll let you stream any movies or TV shows you\u2019ve purchased through iTunes in the past, too. You can also watch new purchases and rentals through the app, but you\u2019ll have to make those purchases through another device with iTunes on it. You can\u2019t do it straight from the TV.\n\nApple previously announced that the Fire TV would be one of several third-party platforms where its app would launch. It\u2019s already available on Samsung TVs, and Apple said support is coming for LG, Sony, and Vizio TVs, too. Support for Roku devices arrived earlier this month.\n\nWhile Apple is usually content to only serve customers who are willing to buy the company\u2019s own hardware devices, things have been a little different when it comes to Apple TV Plus. Apple knows it needs to reach a large audience in order to make the $5-per-month subscription service into a worthwhile business, so it\u2019s suddenly ready to extend access to iTunes purchases to wherever people watch TV. If the shows are hard to watch, people will be more inclined to choose other services.\n\nThe streaming service will launch next Friday with nine original shows, most of which will premiere with their first three episodes, with new ones arriving weekly.", "description": "The Apple TV app is now available on three different models of Fire TV devices \u2014 the Fire TV Stick 4K, the Fire TV Stick (2nd Gen), and the Fire TV Basic Edition \u2014 with support for more models coming soon.", "authors": ["Jacob Kastrenakes", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Yk6KfNEscCTc-KmLwI8m4QobuP8=/0x38:1920x1043/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19315352/1_1Y9_eeKTgzpQGpoJ8v6_Tg.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
