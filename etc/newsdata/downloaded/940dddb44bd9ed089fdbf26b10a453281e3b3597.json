He also posted on Twitter that Patriots owner Robert Kraft, who pleaded not guilty earlier this year to soliciting prostitution, \"got caught in the parlor AB speculations fired different strokes different folks clearly.\"\n\nBrown recently deleted all of the tweets regarding Roethlisberger, Sharpe, and Kraft.\n\nHis tweet regarding Roethlisberger said, \"Steelers QB investigated in Sexual Assault\" while writing above the photo, \"4 games for Big Ben crazy world I'm done with it.\" The NFL suspended Roethlisberger for four games in 2010 after he was accused of sexual assault earlier that year. The district attorney said Roethlisberger would not face criminal charges.\n\nBrown also posted a screenshot of an article mentioning previous sexual assault allegations involving Sharpe while writing a caption above the photo, \"Shannon Sharp the funny guy on tv still after this.\"\n\nSharpe responded on Twitter by saying \"CLOWNTONIO 6ix9ine out here dry snitching on everyone.\"\n\nIf that wasn't enough, Brown went after the Patriots owner's involvement in a Florida massage parlor by saying \"Kraft got caught in the parlor AB speculations fired different strokes different folks clearly.\"\n\nTwo women have come forward with allegations of sexual misconduct against him. His former trainer Britney Taylor filed a civil suit in South Florida federal court over allegations of sexual assault. A second woman, a painter, told Sports Illustrated that Brown exposed himself to her while she was working on a mural at his home in Pittsburgh two years ago. Her legal team informed the NFL of \"intimidating\" text messages sent to the woman from Brown which seemed to expedite his release from the Patriots, according to SI.com.\n\nAfter his release, Brown's agent, Drew Rosenhaus, tweeted that his client \"is healthy and is looking forward to his next opportunity in the NFL. He wants to play the game he loves and he hopes to play for another team soon.\"\n\nNow it's not clear if Brown will ever want to play again.\n\nPATRIOTS RELEASE ANTONIO BROWN AFTER CLAIMS OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT, INTIMIDATION OF ACCUSER\n\nIn his Twitter tirade on Sunday, Brown was reportedly upset about losing the $29.125 million in guaranteed money from the Oakland Raiders and $9 million signing bonus from the Patriots, which have been rescinded by both teams.\n\nHe lost the Raiders guaranteed money after the team fined him for conduct detrimental to the team before his release on Sept. 7. ESPN reports the Patriots released Brown before his signing bonus was set to kick in based on a representation warranty clause that requires a player to disclose situations that could prevent continued availability.\n\nBrown is expected to file a grievance against the Patriots, and the NFL players association will represent him, according to ESPN's Chris Mortensen.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBrown went from being arguably the best receiver in the NFL to not wanting to play the sport anymore in just a few months.\n\nFox News' Ryan Gaydos and Samuel Chamberlain contributed to this story.", "description": "Antonio Brown says he will not be\u00a0playing in the NFL,\u00a0making the announcement via Twitter just two days after the New England Patriots released the maligned wide receiver.", "authors": ["David Aaro", "David Aaro Is A Freelance Reporter At Fox News Digital Based In New York City."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/Antonio-Brown-AP-THUMB.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
