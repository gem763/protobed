I think it's unlikely, I really really do.\"\n\n(Image: JESSICA TAYLOR/UK PARLIAMENT/HANDOUT/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nBaroness Chakrabarti added: \"What we need to concentrate on is getting no deal ruled out... and then to head for a general election\n\n\"I just think we\u2019re getting into a level of fantasy around these various permutations of unity governments. It\u2019s just not realistic.\"\n\nThe plan to install Speaker Bercow as a caretaker PM was briefed by unknown MPs today to the Sunday Times.\n\nOpposition MPs are seeking to install a temporary unity government if Boris Johnson - who has a majority below minus 40 - loses a vote of no-confidence in his government.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nUnder the law, if the government loses a confidence vote, another group of MPs can take power within 14 days if they command a majority in the Commons.\n\nIf there's no rival group, a general election is triggered.\n\nHaving a temporary Prime Minister would prevent Boris Johnson forcing an election immediately and using the power vacuum to ram through a no-deal Brexit.\n\nBut opposition MPs are split over who that unity figure should be. Labour insist it must be Jeremy Corbyn - but the Lib Dems insist he is not the right candidate to unify the Commons.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nJohn McDonnell yesterday said he would accept no one but Jeremy Corbyn as a caretaker Prime Minister.\n\nAsked if he'd accept an alternative Mr McDonnell told La Repubblica: \"There's no way we would accept that.\n\n\"The just normal process is that the major party takes over. And I would expect that as well. And the majority of the opposition parties accept that.\n\n\"The SNP , the Greens, the Change UK have accepted that. The Liberal Democrats for their own purposes are holding out at the moment. I don't think that will last very long\u201d.\n\n(Image: Dan Kitwood)\n\nA source close to the Shadow Chancellor confirmed his view had not changed since the Bercow plan came forward.\n\nAn election now cannot be held before October 31 under the current law - because it needs a 25 working day countdown.\n\nLabour is demanding an election but only once it is certain Brexit will be delayed beyond October 31 to stop no-deal.\n\nBaroness Chakrabarti said once that has been complied with, there should be a general election \"certainly this side of Christmas\".", "description": "The Speaker was mooted as the possible head of a 'government of national unity' - but Labour gave the idea short shrift", "authors": ["Dan Bloom", "Image", "Jessica Taylor Uk Parliament Handout Epa-Efe Rex", "Pa", "Dan Kitwood"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20329540.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_House-of-Commons-debates-London-United-Kingdom-25-Sep-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
