Four years ago he won an accommodation to wear his turban and a beard while patrolling.\n\nFriends said Dhaliwal, 42, was an example of how love-inspired service to others can tear down walls of distrust and misunderstanding.\n\n\"He was just a gem of a person. He was a beautiful soul,\" Simran Jeet Singh, a senior religion fellow at the New York-based Sikh Coalition, said Saturday. \"Everyone who knew him admired him greatly.\"\n\nLaw enforcement officers escort the body of Deputy Sandeep Dhaliwal, who was shot and killed after a traffic stop in Cypress earlier in the day, to the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences on Friday, Sept. 27, 2019, in Houston. Jon Shapley/Houston Chronicle via Associated Press\n\nRobert Solis, who has an extensive criminal history, has been charged with capital murder in Dhaliwal's killing. Solis, 47, was denied bond at a hearing early Saturday.\n\nAuthorities haven't speculated as to Solis' motive or suggested that it was a hate crime. Solis was wanted on a warrant for violating parole, and authorities said Saturday that they had received \"credible information\" that he might have a mental illness or intellectual disability and ordered an evaluation.\n\nThe killing came at a time when the US has seen a string a mass shootings, including several recent ones in the Texas cities of El Paso, Odessa and Midland, stoking the debate over the nation's gun laws.\n\nThe country also is riven over President Donald Trump's push for restrictions on immigration and efforts to build a wall on the southern border with Mexico.\n\n'A man in a turban and beard is just as much American as you'\n\nSome friends of Dhaliwal said his life showed how the presence of multiple cultures and faiths can enrich the country.\n\n\"It's such a powerful message to send to the community that a man in a turban and beard is just as much American as you,\" said Simran Jeet Singh.\n\nEven so, Dhaliwal's primary motivation was the ability to live his faith, said his friend Manpreet Kaur Singh, an attorney and Sikh Coalition board member who is not related to Simran Jeet Singh. Sikh men often take Singh as a last name, while women take the last name Kaur, rather than using surnames that would identify them by caste. Manpreet Kaur Singh has both her mother's and father's last names.\n\n\"When you wear your articles of faith, you're telling the world 'I stand up for injustice, for people and for the greater good,'\" she said.\n\nMourners gather outside Memorial Hermann Hospital in Houston after Harris County Sheriff's Deputy Sandeep Dhaliwal was transported to the medical examiners office after he was shot and killed in the line of duty on Friday, Sept. 27, 2019. Brett Coomer/Houston Chronicle via Associated Press\n\nSikhism, a monotheistic faith, was founded more than 500 years ago in the Indian region of Punjab and has roughly 27 million followers worldwide, most of them in India.\n\nThere are more than 500,000 Sikhs in the US Male followers often cover their heads with turbans, which are considered sacred, and refrain from shaving their beards.\n\nSome were targets of anti-Islam violence following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, even though Sikhism is unrelated to Islam.\n\nAbout 7,000 to 10,000 live in the Gulf Coast Region of the US, according to the Houston Chronicle. More than a half-dozen Sikh temples can be found in the region.\n\nDhaliwal's 'passion for public service was obvious to us all'\n\nDhaliwal was a member of the Sikh National Center in Houston, said its chair, Hardam Azad.\n\nAzad said Dhaliwal often would speak with young people at the center, showing his sheriff's badge. A widely-shared video of Dhaliwal posted on the Facebook page of the Harris County Sheriff's Office showed him laughing as he allowed a boy to handcuff him and then unlock the handcuffs with the key.\n\n\"Ever since 9/11 happened, a lot of hate crimes have occurred against the Sikhs,\" Azad said. \"The way to counter that was exactly the kind of service Sandeep Dhaliwal provided to the larger community.\"\n\nPrior to Dhaliwal's hiring, Azad said the center had been in conversations with then-Sheriff Adrian Garcia to bring a Sikh onto the force.\n\nDhaliwal stepped up, he added.\n\n\"His passion for public service was obvious to us all,\" Azad said. \"There are some people who live angry lives. He was anything but angry.\"\n\nIn this Aug. 29, 2015, photo, Harris County Sheriffs deputy Sandeep Dhaliwal gets a blue ribbon pinned to him during a vigil at the Chevron station in Houston, where Harris County deputy Darren Goforth was shot and killed previous night while he was refueling his vehicle. Dhaliwal was shot and killed while making a traffic stop Friday, Sept. 27, 2019, near Houston. Karen Warren/Houston Chronicle via Associated Press\n\nDhaliwal's father was a police officer in India before moving his family to the United States. The deputy said in a 2015 interview that \"serving in the police force is natural\" to Sikhs who value service.\n\n\"Sikhs have been in this country for more than 100 years (but) we've been absent from the national conversation,\" Simran Jeet Singh said. \"One of the values of serving in uniform gives us a sense as a community that we are being seen and are being understood.\"\n\nWhen Hurricane Harvey ravaged Houston, Dhaliwal joined others in the Sikh community to help feed those left homeless. Then when Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico, he traveled there to help.\n\n\"There are just those people who come out passionate in the world, and you don't know what drives them,\" said Manpreet Kaur Singh. \"He wanted to make sure he helped people. I had no idea what made him sacrifice his time.\"\n\nShe said Dhaliwal didn't fear being targeted because of his appearance, but he did help ensure that Sikh places of worship were protected on Sundays by off-duty officers.\n\nShe also said Dhaliwal was deeply affected by the 2015 killing of another deputy, Darren Goforth, who was gunned down at a gas station while fueling his car. Dhaliwal \"really jumped in and helped with the vigil, helped put together the memorial,\" she said.\n\nDhaliwal is survived by a wife and three children, as well as his father and sisters, Manpreet Kaur Singh said. His mother died last year.\n\nShe said she has a picture of him taken the day the policy change allowed him to wear his turban.\n\n\"He was so excited. I never had the foresight to see the possibility of him dying in the line of duty,\" she said.\n\n___\n\nWilliams reported from Detroit and Webber from Chicago.
