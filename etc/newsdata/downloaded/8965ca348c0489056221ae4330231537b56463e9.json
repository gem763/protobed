The research linked drinking two glasses of soda a day, made with either sugar or artificial sweeteners, to a higher risk of death.\n\nThe researchers reported that drinking artificially sweetened soft drinks was associated with deaths from circulatory diseases like heart attacks, and sugar-sweetened soft drinks were associated with deaths from digestive diseases, which include liver and stomach problems.\n\n\"Artificially sweetened soft drinks have few or no calories; however, their long-term physiological and health implications are largely unknown,\" the study authors wrote.\n\nThe study's authors called for public health campaigns telling people to limit their consumption of soft drinks.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nThe study comes after many major soda brands have expanded their offerings for health-conscious consumers. For example, Pepsi launched Bubly sparkling water, which has flavor with no artificial sweeteners and no calories, in February 2018.\n\n\"Today, more than half of all beverages purchased contain no sugar. No one should overconsume sugar, and we stand by the safety and quality of our products,\" Dermody said.\n\nThe study's participants came from Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. None of them reported cancer, heart disease, stroke or diabetes when they were recruited between 1992 and 2000. But 41,693 of the more than 450,000 original recruits people have died since the study began.", "description": "Soft drinks made with sugar or artificial sweeteners are just as bad for your helath, according to a recent study.", "authors": ["Evie Fordham"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/02/0/0/soda-closeup_large-070818acb0f4b510VgnVCM200000d6c1a8c0____.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
