Any damage to the skin, either chemical or physical, or even hormones or any other changes in the body can provoke skin cancer,\u201d Ekaterina revealed.\n\nThe Russian blogger started a fundraiser and managed to collect almost R7 million to cover part of operations to be performed in Israel.\n\nShe added the Israeli doctors they contacted said they wouldn\u2019t be able to the whole birthmark, but they could do enough to eliminate the risk of cancer and give him a chance at a normal life.\n\nBut it isn\u2019t an easy process and could take up to seven years to complete the treatment, according to Ekaterina.\n\nThe Russian blogger has received widespread support from her 862 000 Instagram followers, including from Ukrainian TV presenter and singer Regina Todorenko, who wrote, \u201cIt\u2019ll work out! I believe in it!\u201d\n\n(IMAGES: MEDIADRUMWORLD/MAGAZINEFEATURES.CO.ZA)", "description": "The blogger shared the sad reason she never posted pictures of her son after he was born.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9520/c5ae658b560244e4a0629d9b57a30230.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
