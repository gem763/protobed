Browsing Maps in incognito mode will also mean that your activity \"won't be used to personalize your Maps experience,\" Google said in a blog post announcing the updates.\n\nIncognito mode can be accessed by selecting it from the menu on your profile photo \"and you can turn it off at any time to return to a personalized experience with restaurant recommendations, information about your commute, and other features tailored to you,\" the company said.\n\nIt will roll out on Android devices in October. Google did not specify when it would be available for Apple iOS devices, saying only that it was coming soon.\n\nYouTube users can now choose to auto-delete their browsing and viewing history after a certain amount of time that they choose.\n\nFinally, the company announced new security features on its voice Assistant, such as simpler commands to ask the Assistant to delete recent activity.\n\nNow with the commands \u201cHey Google, delete the last thing I said to you\u201d and \u201cHey Google, delete everything I said to you last week,\" the voice-controlled device will automatically delete that data. If you ask it to delete over a week's worth of data from your account, it will pull up the page in your account settings where you are able to do this.\n\nIn January, Google was slapped with more than $56 million in fines under new European privacy rules after an investigation by a watchdog group into complaints filed against Google last year revealed that users were \"not sufficiently informed\" about its data consent policies.", "description": "After courting controversy for its data collection policies, Google announced some small updates to privacy tools in Maps and YouTube.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Business/google-gty-er-191002_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
