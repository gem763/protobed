GE Is One of Them.", "language": "en", "text": "Text size\n\nOil companies are not the only ones that benefit from higher oil prices. Industrial stocks, for the most part, prefer higher oil prices, too.\n\nThese are the companies that sell values, pumps, and trucks to the energy explorers, processors, and distributors. Some 10% to 20% of sales for U.S. industrial companies derives from such energy-end market exposure. Several have low, or no, direct exposure like auto parts companies.\n\nOthers, however, have high energy exposure making them \u201coily\u201d industrials. As energy prices rise, investors may want to revisit the valuations of some these oily stocks.\n\nPrices soared after attacks in Saudi Arabia\u2014the largest oil producer in OPEC\u2014knocked out more than 5 million barrels a day of crude oil production, or about 5% of global output. But over the past year, benchmark crude oil prices have fallen about 25%.\n\nPump, valve and seal maker Flowserve (FLS) is one of the oiliest industrial stocks, generating up to 40% of sales from energy-linked end markets. Shares have fallen 10% over the past year to $49.47 and have fallen from more than $70 from 2014 when oil prices were more than $100 per barrel. Flowserve stock is up 2% to $49.53 on Monday.\n\nCompressor maker Gardner Denver Holdings (GDI) generates about 30% of sales from energy end markets. Its stock has gone the opposite way of Flowserve, rising more than 10% over the past year. It announced plans to merge with Ingersoll-Rand\u2019s (IR) industrial business in April, boosting investor sentiment. Gardner Denver Holdings stock has risen 2% to $31.84 on Monday.\n\nValve maker Circor (CIR) generates about half its sales from energy end markets. Its shares are down about 20% over the past year, but the stock has been volatile recently because the company faced an unsolicited offer from Crane (CR), which offered to pay $48 for Circor. Circor stock has advanced 1.8% to $37.67 on Monday.\n\nAnd General Electric (GE) is still an oily industrial, at least until GE sells its remaining 40% stake in Baker Hughes (BHGE). GE is selling the position to raise cash and pay down debt and announced plans to sell about 20% of its stake in a secondary stock offering last week. GE share are up 0.7% top $9.41 in Monday trading. Its stake in Baker Hughes is wroth more too, after that company\u2019s stock rose 4.9% to $23.82.\n\nOf course, there are other industrial stocks that are positively with energy prices. But there isn\u2019t any guarantee that energy prices will stay elevated for long. President Trump tweeted his intention to release oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve shortly after the Saudi attack to tamp down oil price volatility.\n\nAnd higher energy prices can hurt economic growth, which isn\u2019t good for any sector of the economy. Still, some industrial shares, like the oil services sector, have performed poor relative to the market and higher oil prices could be a catalyst to close that performance gap.\n\nThe industrial components of the S&P 500 were down 0.1% in Monday trading, a little better than the 0.5% decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The VanEck Vectors Oil Services ETF (OIH), on the other hand, was up 8.6%. The Oil Services ETF, however, is down more than 50% over the past year, far worse than industrial stocks.\n\nWrite to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.com", "description": "Flowserve, Gardner Denver, Circor, and even GE stand to benefit from a sustained rise in oil prices.", "authors": ["Al Root"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-107388/social", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
