The UN will not publicly identify those countries, but sources told AFP the main culprits are the US, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico and Iran.\n\nIn all, 64 countries owe money to the UN. Also on the list of budget delinquents are Venezuela, North Korea, South Korea, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Israel and Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe last country to have paid up is war-wracked Syria, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said on Tuesday at his daily press conference.\n\nIn a letter sent on Monday to the 37,000 employees at the UN secretariat, which was obtained by AFP, Mr Guterres said the UN had a deficit of US$230 million as at the end of September.\n\nOn Tuesday, he indicated that if the world body had not taken the initiative to cut spending since the start of the year, the hole would have been even bigger in October - possibly US$600 million - and could have affected last month's General Assembly attended by world leaders.\n\nTravel cuts\n\nIn his statement on Tuesday, Mr Guterres thanked the 129 member states who have paid up \"and urged those who have not paid to do so urgently and in full\".\n\nTo limit expenditures from now until year's end, the UN chief has raised the possibility of postponing conferences and meetings, limiting all but essential official travel, and reducing services.\n\nA UN official speaking on condition of anonymity said Mr Guterres had raised the budget issues with member states as early as this past spring, asking them to pay up, but they refused.\n\nNot including what it pays for peacekeeping operations, the UN's operating budget for 2018-2019 is close to US$5.4 billion, with the United States contributing 22 per cent.\n\nThe portion still owed? Nearly US$1.4 billion.\n\nWashington is also the largest contributor to the UN peacekeeping tab.\n\nUS President Donald Trump's administration has taken a hard line on UN funding, cutting contributions and pushing for cost-saving reforms.\n\nAFP", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [UNITED NATIONS, US] The United Nations (UN) has an overall annual operating budget of several billion dollars, covering everything from humanitarian work to disarmament, but right now, it's just trying to make sure its employees get paid after this month. .
