However, WHO said the information from the ministry did not include a potential differential diagnosis regarding the cause of the illness.\n\nIn a press conference on September 14, Ummy Mwalimu, the Tanzanian minister of health, said there are no confirmed cases of Ebola in the country, but added they had built isolation centers in Mwanza, Dar es Salaam and Moshi.\n\n\"These centers are not only meant for Ebola virus disease, but also highly infectious diseases. We are preparing for any possible case as well as educating the public on the symptoms of Ebola and how the disease is spread, especially in communities living along the borders,\" she said.\n\nHowever WHO said that on September 19, it was unofficially informed that a contact of the initially presumptive case of Ebola virus disease had been reported to be sick and hospitalized. Tanzanian authorities again refuted claims of any confirmed or suspected case of Ebola in the country.\n\nDespite several requests, WHO said that to date, it has not received further details regarding any of the cases from the Tanzanian authorities, including clinical data, results of the investigations, possible contacts and potential laboratory tests performed for differential diagnosis of the patients.\n\nNevertheless, in preparation for the vaccination of frontline health workers in case of an Ebola outbreak in Tanzania, WHO said a vaccination protocol has received provisional approval from the national authorities.\n\nThe agency also shipped 1,000 personal protective equipment sets and additional logistics equipment, among other supplies.\n\nEast and central African countries have been on high alert for possible spillovers of Ebola from the Democratic Republic of Congo, where it has killed 2,108 people. So far, 3,034 cases have been confirmed and 111 cases are probable.\n\nOf the total confirmed and probable cases, 56 percent - or 1,760 - are female, 29 percent or 898 are children aged less than 18 years, and 5 percent or 159 are health workers.\n\nAccording to WHO, the estimated funding requirement for all partners for the period July to December 2019 is $287 million, including $120-$140 million for the agency.\n\nAs of September 19, close to $60 million had been received by WHO, with further funds committed or pledged.\n\nWHO is appealing for further financing to fund the response through to December 2019, saying the available funds will close the financial gap only until the end of October.", "description": "The World Health Organization has expressed concerns over the failure of Tanzanian authorities to supply further information on the death of an individual from a suspected Ebola virus in the Capital Dar es Salaam earlier this month.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201909/26/5d8c6b3ea310cf3e979e2c58.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
