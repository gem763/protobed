(AP) - Mississippi State has three straight losses and little margin for error in its postseason hopes as it prepares to play back-to-back road games with Texas A&M; and Arkansas.\n\nThe Bulldogs (3-4, 1-3 SEC) also are dealing with injuries that will force them to count on big performances from key freshman defenders as they continue their chase for a bowl bid.\n\nIn a 36-13 loss to No. 2 LSU last week, freshman Martin Emerson earned his first career start at cornerback. Emerson was filling in for senior Maurice Smitherman, who suffered a season-ending injury last week. Backup cornerback Tyler Williams has missed the last three games due to a lower-body injury.\n\nEmerson hasn\u2019t been the lone freshman getting defensive reps of late. Cornerback Jarrian Jones is a top reserve at cornerback while defensive tackle Nathan Pickering has received significant reps this month.\n\n\u201cFor (Emerson) to start as a true freshman against those kind of receivers (at LSU), those guys are representative of the young guys in this program,\u201d Mississippi State coach Joe Moorhead said. \u201cJarrian, Emerson and Nathan Pickering and (freshman safety) Collin Duncan and others have a lot of young talent, and it bodes well for the future.\u201d\n\nThe Bulldogs are also dealing with the loss of a couple of starters due to suspensions. Junior linebacker Willie Gay and senior defensive tackle Lee Autry must sit out eight games this season and sat out last week\u2019s game against LSU. Neither is expected to play Saturday at Texas A&M; (4-3, 2-2).\n\nTexas A&M; coach Jimbo Fisher remains impressed with Mississippi State\u2019s defense and singled out junior cornerback Cameron Dantzler.\n\n\u201cDantzler is one of the best corners we\u2019ll play all year long - athletic,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cThe other young corners are playing very well for them. Safeties, they get involved. Tons of pressures, tons of blitzes, different looks, different things up front. (It) will be very challenging.\u201d\n\nSince giving up 56 points and 578 yards in a blowout loss to No. 9 Auburn three weeks ago, Mississippi State has displayed small improvements on defense. In their last two league matchups, the Bulldogs have allowed 385 yards per game.\n\nWith five regular-season games left, Mississippi State needs three more victories to reach bowl eligibility. Three of those games will be at home inside Davis Wade Stadium, but that includes a date with top-ranked Alabama in November.\n\n\u201cI think Texas A&M; is big because it\u2019s the next one,\u201d Moorhead said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to have the mindset of us fighting, scratching and clawing. We\u2019ve got to concentrate on what\u2019s five feet in front of our face. We talked with the captains and leadership committee about our routine on the road, just trying to tweak that and making sure that\u2019s correct.\u201d\n\nMississippi State has earned bowl bids each of the last nine seasons, with eight of them coming under former coach Dan Mullen. In Moorhead\u2019s debut season at Mississippi State last year, the Bulldogs went 8-5 with an Outback Bowl loss to Iowa.\n\nMoorhead wants his players to focus on the task at hand and not look too far down the road.\n\n\u201cI think the practices have been good and they\u2019ve been energized,\u201d Moorhead said. \u201cWith our approach, I don\u2019t want them thinking about a bowl game or six wins or whatever. I want them thinking about the next win and to keep focusing on the process and the consistency of our habits and approach.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s urgency in that we\u2019ve got to get to four, five, six, seven wins and on down the line. We got to get that No. 4 win, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on.\u201d\n\nMississippi State needs to start better. The Bulldogs have been outscored 44-27 in the first quarter. In SEC road games, the Bulldogs have been outscored 28-6 in the first quarter.\n\n\u201cTo get a good start, we\u2019ve got to limit the amount of penalties we have,\u201d Mississippi State tailback Kylin Hill said. \u201cI\u2019m expecting a packed crowd and they are a good team. We just have to stay focused and eliminate the penalties. I won\u2019t say we feel a sense of urgency because guys are still going hard and nobody has given up. We are still pushing.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Mississippi State has three straight losses and little margin for error in its postseason hopes as it prepares to play back-to-back road games with Texas A&M and Arkansas.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Paul Jones"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/24/lsu_mississippi_st_football_72741_c0-137-3300-2062_s1200x700.jpg?b8d17fcc5445bc61e64899c581368704c503e168", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
