The Thai rice soup - more like the Chiu Chow version of congee, with the rice grains distinct, instead of the Cantonese style where the rice is simmered so long it dissolves into the broth - was hot, flavourful and soothing to the stomach, just what you need on a long flight. And it's easy to make at home.\n\nIf you don\u2019t eat pork, substitute minced chicken (in which case, the dish is called khao tom gai sap). Ideally, it would be skinless dark meat chicken (thigh or leg) but that is hard to find. Use breast if only that is available.", "description": "Who knew an in-flight meal could be this good?\n\u00a0\nI never thought that a dish I was served on a plane would be so delicious that I'd want to make it at home,\u2026", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_cooking/public/d8/images/2019/09/09/scmp_11jul19_fe_foodshoot22.jpg?itok=dSM7iuLy", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
