Some listed things they\u2019d rather do than \u201dfollow along to KEEP AMERICA GREAT!\u201d Others called her out for the vice president\u2019s longtime hostility toward gay rights and reproductive health, among other issues:\n\nWhat beautiful animals.\n\n\n\nIf one were, let\u2019s say gay, how would Mike feel? \u2014 andy lassner (@andylassner) September 22, 2019\n\nPlease tell this story. pic.twitter.com/QGdibegMX6 \u2014 Devin Nunes\u2019 cow \ud83d\udc2e (@DevinCow) September 22, 2019\n\nOh Karen... carrying water for the thrice married philandering porn star-paying money laundering election-cheating racist in the White House who cages children for fun.

What would you do if your husband was screwing a porn actor while you were pregnant? If you've come to terms with it, I'd be interested in how you processed dealing with a serial liar. \u2014 John Sipher (@john_sipher) September 22, 2019\n\nImagine thinking you were a normal second lady when you support and enable the most criminal administration ever. \u2014 Molly Jong-Fast (@MollyJongFast) September 22, 2019\n\nThis is a fantastic book about Marlon Bundo. He\u2019s a gay bunny. This book is a sweet way to teach children about same sex marriage. Thank you, Marlon Bundo!
