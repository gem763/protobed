Respondents reported different types of discrimination in the workplace. About 45% said they've seen or experienced ageism; 42% said they've seen or experienced racism; 42% reported witnessing or experiencing discrimination based on gender; and 33% cited discrimination based on sexual preferences.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, workers age 34 and younger reported experiencing ageism more often than workers 55 or older did. Younger workers also reported racism and gender bias more often than older workers.\n\nAgeism in the workplace: What older workers can do to stay employed\n\nHelp wanted: Corporate diversity and inclusion specialists\n\nThere's potential for those numbers to fall in coming years. Glassdoor said hiring for diversity and inclusion specialists at U.S. companies has jumped 30% in the last year, based on a review of jobs posted on the site. As of August, the firm had more than 1,000 postings for diversity and inclusion jobs globally, 810 of them U.S.-based.\n\nThe openings signal that companies are serious about hiring more staff focused on preventing discrimination,said Daniel Zhao, senior economist at Glassdoor. \"Many of these open roles range from middle management all the way up to the C-suite and focus on building or strengthening workplace diversity programs.\"\n\nZhao said many inclusion officers come from a human resources background, and they made a deliberate decision to focus on diversity in the workplace \"because they are passionate about ensuring employees of all backgrounds feel welcomed and heard.\"\n\nGlassdoor data show that employers with offices in Boston, New York City, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., are leading the nation in the number of diversity and inclusion job openings.\n\nThe benefits all students gain from an LGBT-inclusive sex education curriculum\n\nDiversity officers are a good start, but companies must continue investing time and resources into making workplaces feel welcoming, according to Glassdoor. More than half of the survey respondents said their company should do more to increase inclusion efforts.\n\n\"It's critical for employers to actively listen to how their employees feel about what it's like to work at their company,\" Cortez said. \"More importantly, employers must be willing and ready to take action to foster a workplace environment in which all people feel they belong.\"\n\nGlassdoor conducted a similar survey for workers in the U.K., France and Germany. Those results found that 55% of U.K. workers seen or experienced discrimination compared to 43% in France and 37% in Germany. The percentage increase of diversity officer openings were higher in Europe, but the U.S. had a higher number of available jobs.", "description": "Most employees have seen or experienced ageism, racism, gender discrimination or sexual identity bias, survey finds", "authors": ["Khristopher J.
