Over the past 18 months we\u2019ve won the Six Nations and been away on a couple of these camps and it has all brought us into one huge team.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s been great for Wales and hopefully it\u2019s going to put us in really good stead.\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve beaten France seven out of the last eight times. This is the biggest one. It\u2019s going to be a tough one.\u2019\n\nWilliams' only loss with Wales to France came in the 100-minute Six Nations match in 2017\n\nWilliams has only suffered defeat by Les Bleus in the notorious 100-minute match of 2017. Wales with Williams have won all five other Tests against France. But he is still wary.\n\n\u2018France have been playing really well,\u2019 he said. \u2018They have got some old heads in their team and they have a lot of experience.\u2019\n\nAs does Williams, who has now won 61 caps. He cites his move to Saracens as a key factor in his development and maturity after six seasons at the Scarlets.\n\n\u2018Leaving Wales to go and play up in London was great,\u2019 he said. \u2018That\u2019s taught me a lot about myself on and off the pitch. Hopefully it shows.\u2019\n\nWilliams is glad that his friend Dan Biggar \u2014 who is back in full training \u2014 has recovered from his second concussion of the tournament, having accidentally knocked him out jumping for a high ball against Fiji.\n\n\u2018The ball was in the middle of the two of us and he is not one to back out, so I went up for it and unfortunately caught him on the way down \u2014 well, in the air and on the way down!\n\n\u2018He said after the World Cup it\u2019s his turn to knock me out!\u2019 Williams joked, explaining that Biggar \u2018owes him one\u2019 after he also cut the fly-half\u2019s chin in a training collision before the Georgia game.\n\nWilliams was involved in a collision with Dan Biggar that left the fly-half with concussion\n\nLike most of the Wales team, Williams seems relaxed and confident heading into the knockout stages, thanks to coach Warren Gatland\u2019s influence.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s upstairs having a laugh and a joke now,\u2019 Williams said of the boss.\n\n\u2018He doesn\u2019t really switch much. He\u2019s just himself and gives us a lot of energy.\n\n\u2018We\u2019ll have a laugh and a joke, but when it comes down to working, we\u2019ll work.\u2019\n\nAnd it is all working wonderfully well for Wales\u2019s golden boy.", "description": "WILL KELLEHER IN BEPPU: Liam Williams has the Midas touch in 2019 - and his only goal now with Wales is to end a perfect year by lifting the World Cup.", "authors": ["Will Kelleher For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/20/19755748-0-image-a-34_1571167698588.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
