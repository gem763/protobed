The genie cannot simply be put back in the bottle as Remainers, including those who backed yesterday\u2019s successful Letwin amendment, would like to believe.\n\nThere is an obligation on our politicians to complete our withdrawal by October 31, and that includes politicians from all parties.\n\nFor while much criticism has been aimed at Tory hardliners and Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionists for blocking deals that would allow our exit from Europe, Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs are just as culpable. Where are Labour\u2019s moderates in this? Crushed? Cowed?\n\nLabour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn speaks during a rally in Liverpool yesterday\n\nAs members of a party controlled by the hard Left, they seem to have allowed themselves to be mesmerised by one issue: staying in the EU.\n\nTo do this, they have been ready to overthrow the referendum result, even though 148 Labour constituencies and an estimated five million Labour supporters voted Leave. What must their constituents think watching their MPs line up yesterday to further frustrate our exit from the bloc?\n\nTake Plymouth, where I was born. I represented the city for Labour and then for the SDP, for longer than any other Plymouth MP. Its people voted 60-40 to leave in 2016, and the Brexit Party cleaned up in the 2019 European parliamentary elections in the city. There can be no doubt where they stand.\n\nSo if Labour continues to support membership of the EU at the next General Election, they can expect to lose many more such cities.\n\nThese Remain-supporting Labour MPs seem to forget that they were all elected on a manifesto in the 2017 General Election that said: \u2018Labour accepts the referendum result.\u2019\n\nTheir stance since then \u2013 along with others \u2013 has done grave damage to the reputation of the House of Commons, and to their party.\n\nThis is all compounded by the fact that Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour reminds voters too closely of the Labour Party of the 1980s.\n\nIn 1981, as part of the Gang of Four, I helped found the new SDP political party. At its root was the takeover of Labour by the hard Left under the leadership of Michael Foot. Making a speech in Grimsby before the 1983 General Election, I compared the manifestos of Labour and the Communist Party, and concluded that, on balance, the Communist one was more moderate.\n\nNow, under Corbyn and John McDonnell, the hard Left has been brought back to life.\n\nLike all true Marxists, McDonnell believes that the end justifies the means. He sees that the route to power is by becoming more pro-EU, and using this issue to persuade a motley crew of Remainers to delay an Election.\n\nUnder Corbyn and John McDonnell (pictured in Westminster yesterday), the hard Left has been brought back to life\n\nMeanwhile, the Liberal Democrats are totally committed to revoking the Article 50 negotiation in its entirety. They have disowned the referendum result and cynically forgotten the unequivocal words of the late Paddy Ashdown on TV as the results came through that, as democrats, they would fully accept the verdict of the people.\n\nThe former leader of the party said: \u2018Those who asked for this, and I was the first leader ever to ask for a referendum in 1989-90, have said so because they believe in the act of democracy.\n\n\u2018I will forgive no one who does not accept the sovereign voice of the British people once it has spoken, whether it\u2019s by one per cent or 20 per cent. It\u2019s our duty to serve the public and make sure our country does the best it can with the decision people have given us\u2026 When democracy speaks, we obey.\u2019\n\nWhat a terrible shame that Jo Swinson has refused to heed such words.\n\nBritish politics is under great strain. The public\u2019s patience has worn thin with Parliament\u2019s inability to come to a decision and honour a democratic ballot.\n\nIndeed, across the country, ordinary, hard-working people see prosperous Londoners stopping the will of the referendum majority by any means, fair or foul.\n\nWe have seen great polarisation in our country during these past three years.\n\nOnly by leaving now can we begin to heal those rifts.\n\nThe British people are not violent. If our exit were to be frustrated further, we would not see an outbreak of riots and so forth, as many warn.\n\nIt would, however, further break down the trust in fair play that underpins our democracy.\n\nWhile Labour and the Liberal Democrats may remain convinced that the result would be reversed in a second referendum, that would, in reality, be unlikely.\n\nIndeed, a ComRes poll a few days ago showed that 54 per cent of the country favour honouring the initial referendum result.\n\nTherefore, we must now have an Election. The country is crying out for the opportunity to vote for a new, decisive Parliament, to retrieve people\u2019s faith in our system that today appears so hideously broken.\n\nLORD OWEN is the former Labour foreign secretary and co-founder of the SDP", "description": "These Remain-supporting Labour MPs seem to forget that they were all elected on a manifesto in the 2017 General Election that said: 'Labour accepts the referendum result', writes LORD OWEN.", "authors": ["Lord Owen For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/22/19938240-0-image-a-21_1571521009821.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
