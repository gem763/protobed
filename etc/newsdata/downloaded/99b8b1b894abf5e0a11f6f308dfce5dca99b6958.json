Ukraine requested the weapons early this past summer. The U.S. sold Ukraine over 200 missiles and 37 launchers in 2018.\n\nThis sale is separate from the $250 million of congressionally authorized military aid to Ukraine that was held up by the Trump administration for months until after President Donald Trump\u2019s heavily scrutinized July 25 call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that\u2019s at the center of a Democratic impeachment inquiry in the House.\n\nDefense Department officials said $214 million of that aid has been obligated to buy equipment for Ukraine but the Pentagon Comptroller\u2019s office declined to give a list of equipment bought. The potential equipment includes .50-caliber sniper rifles capable of disabling armored vehicles, night vision goggles, shoulder-fired grenade launchers and additional radar to pinpoint Russian artillery, according to documents.\n\nThe Javelin is the U.S. Army and Marine Corps\u2019 premier anti-tank weapon that allows a soldier or Marine to fire and move quickly because the missile guides itself to the target. Assuming the U.S. Congress gives formal approval within 30 days, the new Javelin sale would be paid for with Ukrainian funds.\n\nThe officials said there\u2019s no evidence the proposed Javelin sale was held up by the administration after the Ukrainian request, which appeared to be going through the normal channels. Ukraine has sought to bolster its capabilities since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and backed forces in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe weapons system took a star turn during the July 25 call when Zelenskiy told Trump that \u201cwe are ready to continue to cooperate for the next steps, specifically we are almost ready to buy more Javelins.\u201d The president, according to a partial transcript released by the White House last week, then replied: \u201cI would like you to do us a favor though.\u201d\n\n(Updates to add potential additional new gear for Ukraine in fourth paragraph)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Tony Capaccio in Washington at acapaccio@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Bill Faries at wfaries@bloomberg.net, Justin Blum\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The State Department approved and Congress has informally signed off on a $39 million sale of additional Javelin anti-tank weapons to Ukraine, according to three officials familiar with the decision.The sale of 150 anti-tank missiles and two additional missile launchers could be announced", "authors": ["Tony Capaccio"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ROF4kJq8ppIUCxIW28fAxA--~B/aD0xMjUxO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/c62a9d68f5e98b289166b60556bbad4f"}
