That decision is one of the topics discussed on this week\u2019s The Tennis Podcast.\n\nWhy did it take so long for the ATP to decide what to do? Is it a bad look that the decision has come after the Laver Cup and after Kyrgios has announced that he is pulling out of the Asian swing with injury? Has Kyrgios shown any contrition for his actions? What\u2019s the likelihood of Kyrgios being able to comply with the probation terms? And in what way will this make umpires\u2019 jobs even more difficult when officiating Kyrgios\u2019 matches?", "description": "Almost 50 days after Nick Kyrgios verbally abused umpire Fergus Murphy in Cincinnati, the ATP finally concluded its investigation into the incident, handing him six months of probation where a violation of the terms will trigger a fine and 16-week suspension.", "authors": ["Telegraph Sport", "Simon Briggs"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/tennis/2019/10/01/TELEMMGLPICT000210819820-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
