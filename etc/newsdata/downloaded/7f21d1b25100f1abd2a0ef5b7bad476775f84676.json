Waititi, who directed the movie, also stars as Jojo\u2019s imaginary friend, the one and only Adolf Hitler. If that\u2019s a lot for your mind to take in, consider Waititi\u2019s tweet from last summer where he said, \u201cWhat better way to insult Hitler than having him portrayed by a Polynesian Jew?\u201d An excellent question! The official trailer for Jojo Rabbit debuted today, and you can see Rebel Wilson as a proud Nazi child instructor, Sam Rockwell as a Nazi shooting guns, and, of course, Waititi\u2019s f\u00fchrer running and dancing and dispensing advice to young Jojo. The Hitler lambasting will begin at the Toronto International Film Festival.\n\nRelated", "description": "Scarlett Johansson, Sam Rockwell, Rebel Wilson, and Taika Waititi star in the trailer for \u201cJojo Rabbit,\u201d a satire directed by Waititi that he has called his \u201canti-fuckface satire.\u201d", "authors": ["Jordan Crucchiola"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/03/03-jojo-rabbit.w1200.h630.jpg"}
