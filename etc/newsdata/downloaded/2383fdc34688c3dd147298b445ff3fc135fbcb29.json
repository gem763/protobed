He is lured upstairs by the sound of a voice to find a bath full of dirty, bloodied water.\n\nHe looks down as hands suddenly reach up to grab him but the realtor manages to escape.\n\nSpooked by the experience he calls Detective Muldoon, played by Andrea Riseborough, and says, shakily, 'Something happened to me at 44 Rayburn Drive.'\n\nShe begins an investigation, taping off the house, and questioning one cop, who reveals, 'Someone was murdered at that house.'\n\nScary scene: He leans down to look at the murky, bloodied water as two hands suddenly reach up to grab him\n\nToilet terror: A shocked Spencer manages to escape and goes home\n\nWhen Muldoon asks, 'Why do you never go into that house?' he replies, 'Something never felt right about it.'\n\nMeanwhile a long dead body is found in a car in the woods as another detective says, 'Looks like we've got another one.'\n\n'Do you think that the body we found is related?' she asks.\n\nOn the phone: The rattled realtor calls Detective Muldoon, played by Andrea Riseborough, to report the incident\n\nConcerned cop: Muldoon looks worried as she receives the call\n\nAnd even though everyone in the audience knows it's a bad idea, Muldoon goes back to the house to check inside, calling, 'Police Department' as she enters.\n\nFingers grasp the side of the bath and something begins to climb out.\n\nCut to a shaken Muldoon back at her house musing, 'I think someone followed me home.'\n\nNot good: Meanwhile a long dead body is found in a car in the woods as another detective says, enigmatically, 'Looks like we've got another one'\n\nWet and wild: Hands begin to creep out of the bloodied bath\n\nTerror ride: The suspense is ramped up as a head appears\n\nPanicked, she wakes up her son who asks, 'Mommy what's wrong?' and catches a glimpse of dark blood disappearing as she says, 'We need to leave, right now.'\n\nCut to a slew of deeply disturbing images including Muldoon screaming and falling down a staircase, Spencer being chased by something and ending with him in the shower in what looks like a take from the classic Psycho scene.\n\nBut it's not a hand holding a knife that wreaks the terror, it's actually far worse as a bloodied and dirty hand grabs his head as he washes his hair.\n\nWorried mom: Muldoon realizes something has followed her home from the mansion rushes to grab her son and leave\n\nTaking the fall: One scary flash shows a woman tumbling down the well of a staircase\n\nSpooked: Demi\u00e1n Bichir, whose character has yet to be revealed, drives away as a woman with blook pouring out of her mouth tries to stop him\n\nIf audiences still aren't clued up, the words, 'When someone dies in the grip of rage a curse is born.
