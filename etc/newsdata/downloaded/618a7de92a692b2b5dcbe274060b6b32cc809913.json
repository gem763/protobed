He said: \"Failure to reach agreement by 2020 would greatly increase the risk that countries will act unilaterally, with negative consequences on an already fragile global economy.\"\n\n'Increasing complexity'\n\nThe proposed measures have been criticised by campaigners.\n\nAlex Cobham, chief executive of the Tax Justice Network said :\"The OECDs proposals bring more complexity for tax abusers to hide behind, fail to meaningfully curb corporate tax abuse and will shrink the tax revenues of lower-income, non-OECD member countries that currently suffer losses most intensely from corporate tax abuse.\"\n\nThe OECD proposals would need to be agreed by governments to come into force.
