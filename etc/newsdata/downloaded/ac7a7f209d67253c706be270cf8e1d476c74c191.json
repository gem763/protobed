Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, widely known as AOC.\n\nIn a newly released interview, Yahoo Finance\u2019s Editor-in-Chief Andy Serwer asked Levchin for his thoughts on U.S. politicians like AOC who are looking to reduce wealth inequality by, for example, raising taxes on the wealthy.\n\n\u201cIn general, what has struck me as amusing \u2014 and to some extent, tragic \u2014 is that there's not a whole lot of people that are pounding the table for some form of socialism that lived in a socialist setting,\u201d Levchin told Serwer.\n\n\u201cHaving ... spent my first 16 years in a socialist country, from personal experience, redistribution does not work, because people doing the redistribution somehow always get a lot more,\u201d he added.\n\nMax Levchin speaks to Yahoo Finance's Andy Serwer. More\n\nLevchin, who was also an early investor in Yelp (YELP), made the comments during a conversation that airs in an episode of Yahoo Finance\u2019s \u201cInfluencers with Andy Serwer,\u201d a weekly interview series with leaders in business, politics, and entertainment.\n\n\u2018Let\u2019s just give the government all the power\u2019\n\nThe 44-year-old computer scientist\u2019s comments regarding \u201cpeople pounding the table for some sort of socialism\u201d apparently refer, at least in part, to AOC\u2019s sort of socialism \u2014 the democratic kind.\n\nAnd what is democratic socialism exactly? As Maria Svart, national director of the Democratic Socialists of America, told The New York Times last year, \u201cOur ultimate goal really is for working people to run our society and run our workplaces and our economies.\u201d\n\nHowever, as The Times\u2019s Maggie Astor noted, the definition of democratic socialism varies widely. For her part, AOC has said it \u201cdoes not mean government owns everything.\u201d\n\nMax Levchin near his office in San Francisco, Calif., on Thursday, March 14, 2013.

Levchin was born in Kiev, Ukraine, in 1975, when it was still part of the Soviet Union, which centered around state ownership of resources.\n\nFifteen years later, \u201cthere were tanks on the streets, because we couldn't \u2014 couldn't contain the populace from tearing the country apart,\u201d he told Yahoo Finance.\n\nThe Soviet Union had promised low unemployment and equality, but its efforts resulted in shortages of consumer goods, unending bureaucracy, and squalor, according to a 1991 New York Times article on the death of the Soviet Union.\n\nLevchin, who\u2019s Jewish, came to the U.S. that year as a refugee, and his family found \u201csafety & opportunity,\u201d he noted in a 2017 tweet in support of immigrants.\n\nHe went on to earn a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and in addition to PayPal, he was also involved in the creation of Slide.com, HVF, and Affirm.\n\nIn a more recent tweet, in 2019, Levchin noted the dangers of the economic system where he grew up.", "description": "PayPal co-founder Max Levchin has said he tries stay away from politics, but the Ukranian-born serial entrepreneur does make at least one exception.
