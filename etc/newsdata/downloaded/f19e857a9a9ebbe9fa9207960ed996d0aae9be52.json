In one chat, an FBI agent with the Kansas Joint Terrorism Task Force wrote that Smith discussed using a \u201clarge vehicle bomb\u201d against an unspecified major news network\u2019s headquarters and assassinating Democratic presidential hopeful Beto O\u2019Rourke.\n\nSmith allegedly told an associate he had \u201ca few\u201d political figures as targets in mind, including unnamed officials in Congress, the federal government, and \u201ca liberal Texas mayor.\u201d Smith also talked about \u201ckilling members of the far left group, antifa, as well as destroying nearby cell towers or local news station [sic],\u201d according to a criminal complaint.\n\nIn a statement to ABC News, which first reported the arrest, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign said it was grateful for law enforcement efforts and was in \u201cdirect contact with the FBI\u201d about the case, which is being taken \u201cvery seriously.\u201d\n\nBefore he joined the U.S. Army, Smith allegedly told a friend who had fought with an extremist right-wing militia in Ukraine that \u201cto fight is what I want to do\u201d and that he was interested in joining the Azov Battalion, another right-wing extremist militia in Ukraine.\n\nAzov, which conducts vigilante patrols in Ukraine and adopts Nazi iconography and ideology, has attacked LGBTQ Ukrainains, members of the Roma ethnic minority, and others. In recent years, Azov has sought to cultivate and recruit neo-Nazis and right wing extremists in the U.S. and Europe.\n\nHe faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.", "description": "Jarrett William Smith, who was arrested Sept. 21, also allegedly talked about traveling to Ukraine to join a right-wing extremist militia.", "authors": ["Adam Rawnsley"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569264301/GettyImages-72108178_shbrv8", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
