As of Tuesday morning, the entry point for their preferred trade was the most attractive in 18 years, they added.\n\n\u201cAt today\u2019s levels, we like calendar risk reversals for equity replacement to position for a breakout higher in U.S. equities while reducing exposure to moderate drawdowns,\u201d they wrote. \u201cIt is clearly the preferred trade when the S&P is flat to mildly lower.\u201d\n\nU.S. stocks sold off and volatility rose Tuesday as the Democrat-controlled House opened a formal impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump. While the move added to a raft of investor concerns including trade tensions and disappointing economic data, by some measures implied volatility is above its realized counterpart.\n\nThe Bank of America team suggests investors look at selling three-month puts to buy a one-month call, and recommended closing the trade when the shorter-dated option expires. That fits with their bullish view on risk assets amid a myriad of headwinds and risks, they said.\n\n\u201cOur house view remains bullish risk assets, but an abundance of headwinds and risks are challenging a stronger move higher in U.S. equities,\u201d they said. \u201cHave your equity cake without \u2018eating it\u2019 if risks materialize.\u201d\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Joanna Ossinger in Singapore at jossinger@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Christopher Anstey at canstey@bloomberg.net, Cormac Mullen, Ravil Shirodkar\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- For U.S. equity investors wary of a sell-off but loath to miss out on a stocks rally, Bank of America Merrill Lynch is pitching an options strategy known as a calendar risk reversal.Relatively muted swings and a wide price gap between bullish and bearish options bets means it is attractive", "authors": ["Joanna Ossinger"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/88ANFKfV4vmHXVWk3tDwJg--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/e86e245aeaafbe5f169d10418eb849e0", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
