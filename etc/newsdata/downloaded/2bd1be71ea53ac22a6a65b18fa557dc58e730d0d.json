It was the player whose record he broke.\n\nAnthony Davis had a huge night against the Grizzlies and set a Lakers record in the process. (Richard Mackson/Reuters)\n\nThe previous record holder wasn\u2019t Jerry West or Wilt Chamberlain, Magic Johnson or Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. It wasn\u2019t Kobe Bryant.\n\nWait \u2014 Dwight Howard had the record?\n\nIt was Dwight Howard \u2014 the guy who\u2019s banging in the post off the bench now so Davis can play power forward.\n\nHoward didn\u2019t set the record with the Lakers this year, of course. He did so in his previous tenure with the Lakers in 2013 when he hit 25 free throws in a game against the Orlando Magic.\n\nHow did Dwight Howard \u2014 a career 56.6 percent free-throw shooter \u2014 manage to hold a free throw record on a franchise drowning in Hall of Fame scorers? Hack-a-Howard.\n\nThe Magic sent Howard to the line 39 times that night because of his well-documented free-throw deficiencies. He came through at a 64.1 percent clip.\n\nDavis\u2019 heroics highlight 22-0 Lakers run\n\nDavis is most certainly not a notoriously bad free throw shooter.\n\nStory continues\n\nHe set the record Tuesday because when he\u2019s at his best, he\u2019s an unstoppable offensive force. He was at his best against the Grizzlies, logging his fourth career 40-20 night in 31 minutes, 12 minutes fewer than required for any of his previous 40-20 outings, according to basketball reference data mined by The Athletic\u2019s Sam Amick.\n\nFirst time since Shaq\n\nIn fact, according to the Lakers, he hit the 40-20 mark in the fewest minutes in the shot-clock era that started in 1954. It also marked the first 40-20 game by a Laker since Shaquille O\u2019Neal did so in 2003.\n\nHe received a standing ovation from the Staples Center crowd as he earned two more free throws to end the third quarter on a 22-0 Lakers run that put the game out of reach and an end to his night.\n\nAnthony Davis through three quarters:\n\n\n\n40 PTS\n\n20 REB\n\n26-27 FT\n\n2 BLK\n\n\n\nDeserved this standing ovation \ud83d\udde3 pic.twitter.com/29vlUenwvx \u2014 Bleacher Report (@BleacherReport) October 30, 2019\n\nWhen the Lakers traded for Davis, this is the kind of performance fans were salivating for.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for the home crowd to savor a chance to celebrate their new superstar.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "You read that right.
