Ultimately, the most important thing is how I perform in the ring.\u201d\n\nThe 26-year-old is confident that his training team and experience will help him to come out on top.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to destroy Logan in the ring, I\u2019m going to using boxing technique, boxing IQ, I will show everyone I\u2019ve been putting in the work.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not here for a paycheque, I\u2019ve got money, for me it\u2019s all about trying to be better for myself, trying to improve and show people I can do what people think I can\u2019t do.\n\n\u201cNo one would have thought I could be a pro boxer, so many people are writing me off already against Logan. I\u2019ve always wanted to prove people wrong and this is another example.\u201d", "description": "KSI\u00a0has responded to criticism of his upcoming fight with rival YouTuber Logan Paul.
