The biggest misconception is that arthritis is for old people, but this is far from the truth. Adapting to a chronic condition can feel both daunting and unfair. There are more than 100 types of arthritis and related conditions.\n\nThe word arthritis means inflammation in the joint (arth means joint and itis means inflammation). If you have arthritis, it\u2019s best to take steps to protect your joints from ongoing pain and permanent damage caused by uncontrolled inflammation.\n\nWomen\u2019s Health spoke to rheumatologist and specialist physician Dr Rehana Bhorat. According to Dr Bhorat, there are different types of joint disease, but arthritis can broadly be classified into two main groups: degenerative and inflammatory arthritis.\n\nThe most common type of arthritis\u2026\n\n\u201cThe most common joints involved in osteoarthritis include the knees, hips, hands and spine. The pattern of which joints involved is also often determined by genetics. Because we can\u2019t grow cartilage, there are no specific treatments to prevent cartilage loss in osteoarthritis,\u201d says Dr Bhorat.Degenerative arthritis is called osteoarthritis. \u201cOsteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis and occurs because of \u2018wear and tear\u2019 of the cartilage in the joint. Although the development of osteoarthritis is genetically determined, the risk increases as we get older,\u201d she says. Osteoarthritis can be caused or worsened by trauma to the joint, such as a car accident, sporting injury or with repetitive strain on the joint (think: high-impact sports or certain occupations).

Dr Bhorat says gout is inflammatory arthritis, but it doesn\u2019t occur in pre-menopausal women. \u201cThis means that one\u2019s own immune system starts to attack the joints. Because the inflammation starts in the lining of the joint (synovium), if treated early one will prevent joint damage and cartilage loss,\u201d says Dr Bhorat. The cause of autoimmune diseases is genetics \u2014 autoimmune diseases tend to cluster in families. But even though one may have autoimmune genetics, an environmental trigger is still needed to \u2018switch\u2019 the autoimmune disease on. \u201cWe don\u2019t understand the triggers of autoimmunity well, but we do know that cigarette smoking is a trigger for rheumatoid arthritis,\u201d she says. Other theories are that infections, hormones and stress can trigger autoimmune disease. Autoimmune arthritis is more common in women than in men.\n\nThe symptoms?\n\nSymptoms of inflammation in the joint are:\n\nProlonged early morning stiffness.\n\nSwelling.\n\nPain at night in the joints.\n\nAccording to Dr Bhorat, the prototype of autoimmune inflammatory arthritis is rheumatoid arthritis. This affects mainly the small joints in the hands and feet, but virtually all joints bar the lower back can be affected.\n\nREAD MORE: What Happens To Your Bones If You Cut Dairy Out Of Your Diet?\n\nTreatment options\n\nDr Bhorat says pain medication and keeping supporting structures around the joint (muscles, ligaments and tendons) strong are critical. This helps to stabilise the joint, preventing further wear and tear. If severe, joint surgery or joint replacement may be necessary.\n\n\u201cThere are many effective treatments for rheumatoid arthritis which, if started early, can prevent joint damage. These treatments include Disease Modifying Anti Rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs) and the newer but very effective Biologics. If rheumatoid arthritis isn\u2019t treated early and aggressively it can cause joint destruction, but this is entirely preventable with available treatments today,\u201d says Dr Bhorat.\n\nThis article was originally published on www.womenshealthsa.co.za\n\nImage credit: iStock", "description": "The biggest misconception is that arthritis is for old people.", "authors": ["Ondela Mlandu"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/6673/36e77c51332e425ca48923bc053d8c72.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
