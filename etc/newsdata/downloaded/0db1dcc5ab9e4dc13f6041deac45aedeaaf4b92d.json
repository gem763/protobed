It only happens in places where there's a large continental shelf and shallow flat land.\n\nMr Fan's team found 14,077 stormquakes between September 2006 and February 2015 in the Gulf of Mexico and off Florida, New England, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, Labrador and British Columbia.\n\nA special type of military sensor is needed to spot them, Mr Fan said.\n\nWater covering N.C. 12 near Hatteras Village, North Carolina, U.S., on Saturday, Aug. 27, 2011, as Hurricane Irene made landfall on the North Carolina coast\n\nHurricane Ike in 2008 and Hurricane Irene in 2011 set off lots of stormquakes, the study said.\n\nThe shaking is a type that creates a wave that seismologists don't normally look for when monitoring earthquakes, so that's why these have gone unnoticed until now, Mr Fan said.\n\nOcean-generated seismic waves show up on U.S. Geological Survey instruments, 'but in our mission of looking for earthquakes these waves are considered background noise,' USGS seismologist Paul Earle said.\n\nStormquakes were discovered by accident as Mr Fan and his team attempted to monitor low frequency earth quakes.", "description": "Scientists have discovered a mash-up of two feared disasters - hurricanes and earthquakes - and they're calling them 'stormquakes'.
