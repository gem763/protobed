December silver SIZ19, +4.77% jumped 86.2 cents, or 4.8%, to $18.711 an ounce.\n\nPrices for both gold and silver marked the highest most-active contract settlements in more than two weeks, according to FactSet data.\n\nGold had gained ground after data Monday indicated manufacturing activity in the eurozone contracted more sharply in September, posting its worst reading in nearly seven years. The flash eurozone manufacturing purchasing managers index fell to an 83-month low of 45.6 in September, down from 47 in August. Economists polled by FactSet had forecast a 47.3 reading \u2014 a figure of less than 50 indicates activity declined.\n\n\u201cVery disappointing PMI numbers\u201d early Monday renewed recession fears in Europe, Hatzigiannis said.\n\nAmong individual country readings, Germany\u2019s manufacturing PMI reading fell to its lowest in more than a decade.\n\n\u201cGold moved higher on the weaker German PMI print as the dreary survey raises the likelihood of an even more dovish central bank policy shift as the slowdown in the global manufacturing sectors is thought to sit atop the Fed\u2019s \u2018wall of worry,\u2019 said Stephen Innes, market analyst at AxiTrader, in a note.\n\nTrade concerns also remain a factor. The cancellation of visits to farms in Montana and Nebraska by Chinese officials rattled stocks and stirred support for haven assets on Friday, as did remarks by Trump, who said he wanted a fully fledged deal with China rather than a limited agreement that addresses particular grievances. But officials said talks would continue in October, as planned, helping to soothe worries, analysts said.\n\nIn other metals trade, December copper HGZ19, +0.29% tacked on 0.2% at $2.6115 a pound.\n\nOctober platinum PLV19, +1.76% rose 1.2% to $953.90 an ounce, while December palladium PAZ19, +0.10% edged up 0.04% to $1,625.60 an ounce\u2014eking out another record settlement on Comex.\n\n\u201cThe bulls continue to control the palladium market with yet another new all-time high trade,\u201d said analysts at Zaner Metals, in a daily note. Still, \u201cwe do suspect the [platinum group metals] markets are limited by a recent South African union vote to impose a limit on wildcat strikes, as that keeps the threat against supply from strikes in check.\u201d", "description": "Gold prices rise Monday to settle at their highest in over two weeks, getting a boost from a round of downbeat data out of the eurozone that underlined...", "authors": ["Myra P.
