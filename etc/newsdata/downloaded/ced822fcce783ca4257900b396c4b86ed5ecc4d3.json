Irizarry said last year that she holds the officer responsible for not acting during the confrontation.\n\n\"I am severely disappointed I will never get to hear from this man, this officer, as to why my safety, no why my life, had so little value for him,\" Irizarry said at the time.\n\n\"I want the ex-officer to be really be held accountable, whatever that looks like,\" she added. \"Of all the people who have apologized to me, he hasn't apologized to me.\"", "description": "A Chicago man who was caught in a viral video berating a woman for wearin", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/puerto_rico.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
