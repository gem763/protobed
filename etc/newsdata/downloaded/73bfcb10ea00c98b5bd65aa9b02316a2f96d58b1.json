Katie Hill Admits \u2018Inappropriate\u2019 Relationship With Staffer, Ethics Committee Launches Probe", "language": "en", "text": "California 25th District Democratic candidate Katie Hill (Campaign image via Facebook)\n\nRepresentative Katie Hill (D., Calif.) admitted Wednesday evening that she engaged in an \u201cinappropriate\u201d relationship with one of her campaign staffers and apologized for her actions.\n\n\u201cDuring the final tumultuous years of my abusive marriage, I became involved in a relationship with someone on my campaign,\u201d the California congresswoman said in a statement. \u201cI know that even a consensual relationship with a subordinate is inappropriate, but I still allowed it to happen despite my better judgment. For that I apologize. I wish nothing but the best for her and hope everyone respects her privacy in this difficult time.\u201d\n\nThe alleged relationship with the unnamed female campaign staffer, which occurred while Hill was campaigning in last year\u2019s midterm elections, was exposed by the blog RedState, which published a redacted topless photo of Hill and the woman, as a \u201cthrouple\u201d with Hill\u2019s husband.\n\n\u201cI am going through a divorce from an abusive husband who seems determined to try to humiliate me,\u201d Hill said after the photo was published. \u201cI am disgusted that my opponents would seek to exploit such a private matter for political gain. This coordinated effort to try to destroy me and the people close to me is despicable and will not succeed. I, like many women who have faced attacks like this before, am stronger than those who want me to be afraid.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Hill has denied a separate alleged relationship with her legislative director Graham Kelly but promised to cooperate with the House Committee on Ethics, which announced Wednesday that it will open an investigation into that matter, as the alleged relationships potentially violated House rules.\n\n\u201cAllegations that I have been involved in a relationship with Mr. Kelly are absolutely false,\u201d Hill said in a Tuesday statement.\n\nHill said she has notified Capitol Hill police about the publication by \u201cRepublican operatives\u201d of the compromising photos of her and the campaign staffer and said she will not comment further on the matter.\n\nHill is openly bisexual and is the vice chairwoman of the House Oversight Committee.", "description": "\"I am disgusted that my opponents would seek to exploit such a private matter for political gain,\" said Hill.", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle", "Ilya Shapiro", "Tobias Hoonhout", "Kevin D.
