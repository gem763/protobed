A league spokesman told McMenamin that the teams are free to hold their own media availabilities but are unlikely to do so considering that the NBA discussed the media lockdown with the players\u2019 association before announcing it.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe NBA has spent the week trying to contain a controversy that started last Friday when Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey tweeted out his support of protesters in Hong Kong, drawing condemnation in mainland China and leading several Chinese companies to cut ties with the Rockets. The NBA appeared deferential to China in its first statement on the matter Monday, then gave a statement of support to its players\u2019 and executives\u2019 right to free speech on Tuesday.\n\nFriday\u2019s media shutdown was emblematic of how the NBA is striving to maintain the precarious balance between its relationship with China \u2014 with which the league has had a long, financially lucrative relationship \u2014 and its players\u2019 right to speak freely. On Thursday, CNN reporter Christina Macfarlane was shut down at a news conference in Tokyo when she tried to ask the Rockets\u2019 James Harden and Russell Westbrook about this week\u2019s events, with a team official telling her to ask \u201cbasketball questions only.\u201d\n\nThe league later apologized and said Macfarlane should have been allowed to ask her question.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the biggest story of the week so I felt the question needed to be asked,\u201d Macfarlane told The Post. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to have to defend my question and I didn\u2019t expect the reaction to be so forceful. I said to the Rockets person that this wasn\u2019t a good look for the NBA.\u201d\n\nHarden, a popular player in China, was one of the last NBA players to comment on the issue Monday, saying \u201cwe apologize\u201d for Morey\u2019s tweet and \u201cwe love China.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The league will attempt to ride out the storm in China quietly.", "authors": ["Matt Bonesteel", "Reporter For The Early Lead"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/jcv2_Qg_GOuRDAkQLbdTiw81Hhg=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/63PJXSHL5EI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
