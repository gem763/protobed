Byron Bay now welcomes 2.1 million visitors a year, leaving a definite mark on a town with approximately 9000 permanent residents.\n\nOf those Byron locals surveyed, 77 per cent said the phenomenon was responsible for a reduced availability of affordable housing for residents and 61 per cent said it increased property prices. Byron Bay now has the highest median house price in Australia at $1.3 million according to realestate.com.au compared with Sydney at just over $900,000.\n\nA national phenomenon\n\nAustralia-wide Airbnb listings are booming, particularly in coastal destinations. In April 2016 there were 58,210 listings on the portal, by December 2017 that had jumped to 130,665 and had reached 160,479 by the end of last year.\n\nDr Muschter said the current survey would hopefully give other local governments insight on how their communities are faring.\n\nMORE: What \u2018pent-up demand\u2019 is doing to your property\n\nInside Justin Bieber\u2019s epic $13m Beverly Hills mansion\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had many people in my circle of friends and acquaintances who have had to leave Byron. I also work at the Community Centre in Byron Bay and I see people on low incomes aren\u2019t able to come and volunteer anymore because they\u2019ve had to leave town. Some say they can\u2019t even afford to travel into town to work or volunteer,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cGiving more opportunities for tourists to stay in town is, on one hand a good thing, but it does affect rental affordability (or not even just affordable rentals, often there just isn\u2019t anything available to rent). So as a result you have a huge sense of insecurity among renters nowadays.\u201d\n\nDr Tania von der Heidt, senior lecturer in marketing at Southern Cross\u2019 School of Business and Tourism, said the current survey is an extension of the Byron Bay research.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to capture the wider community views across those 12 councils and that way we can compare how residents feel across those different areas. The survey is meant to be a balanced one, we\u2019re not here to point the finger at Airbnb or meet an agenda, it\u2019s simply about collecting community views on the impact of short-term holiday letting,\u201d she said.\n\nThe global crackdown\n\nLocal governments and councils across the world are reacting to the sharp rise in short-term rentals with some cities drastically reducing how often homeowners can \u201chost\u201d entire properties. In Los Angeles and Paris hosts are only allowed to place their properties on a short-term site for a maximum of 120 days a year, in Amsterdam it\u2019s only 30 days and in New York City the minimum stay is 30 days at a time. Even the birthplace of Airbnb, San Francisco, has a 90-day limit.\n\nA vast majority of international cities also require owners to register and report guests as well as pay a fee to their local council. Most of these restrictions only apply to whole properties that could otherwise be rented out full-time and don\u2019t concern spare rooms or granny flats.\n\nAustralian rule-makers, however, have been slow to manage the negative side-effects of short-term leasing with only the NSW State Government passing legislation that will impact the trend.\n\nNew planning laws will allow short-term holiday letting under certain conditions. If the host is present, a home can be let short-term all year long. If the host is not present, the property can only be let for up to 180 days a year in greater Sydney. Councils outside of Sydney will have the power to limit letting \u2014 but no less than 180 days per year \u2014 with the exception of Byron Shire where 90 days can be enforced.\n\n\u201cOne of the major reasons why we were keen to conduct this research in other coastal areas is because the government has a one-size-fits-all approach. They\u2019re intending to have this legislation for short-term holiday letting which will apply to all of NSW. But obviously what\u2019s a big issue in places like Byron, might not be a problem in other areas where they\u2019re probably quite keen to increase their visitor numbers,\u201d Dr Muschter said.\n\n\u201cMaybe with our findings, we can encourage the government to introduce a flexible legislation which allows councils to come up with their own solutions,\u201d she added.\n\nCity versus country\n\nDr Laura Crommelin, research lecturer at the University of NSW\u2019s City Futures Research Centre has looked into the impact short-term letting has had on major metropolitan property markets and said small towns could also be greatly affected.\n\n\u201cIn general, the smaller the city or town, the more quickly something like short-term letting can have an impact. The thing for Sydney and Melbourne is that, on one hand, you actually have a lot more Airbnb, but they\u2019re much bigger markets so the capacity to absorb and cope with change is greater,\u201d she explained.\n\nDr Crommelin\u2019s research with the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute showed that while existing homeowners owners are benefiting from the rise of these platforms, prospective homeowners were finding entering the market more difficult as the possibility of short-term letting earnings could be translated into higher purchase prices. Her work also outlined that for tenants, there were few benefits as the rise in short-term letting is likely to cause greater uncertainty for prospective tenants seeking long-term rentals.\n\n\u201cIn terms of negative impact, what we found in the big cities was that it\u2019s very varied. You start seeing quite significant percentages of properties being used in this way in areas that are the most appealing,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIn Sydney it\u2019s areas close to the coast or the CBD; it\u2019s places with good connections to public transport with good services. The impact is that then pushes people out of those rental markets and into other parts of the city where it\u2019s not so easy for them to get to work, and there aren\u2019t as many jobs nearby. Overall, cities have the capacity to absorb it, but the shifts in those submarkets, like with smaller cities, is significant.\u201d", "description": "Short-term rental portals such as Airbnb, have radically changed the property market, often with adverse effects for the average Australian.
