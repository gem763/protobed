She raised the rifle, held it against her sari and took aim across the fields. All for dramatic effect. The gun wasn\u2019t actually loaded, she told us as she brought it down. The rifle was used in the past to scare away wild elephants, but it hadn\u2019t been deployed for years \u2013 with increasing traffic there were now very few animal incursions, she explained. Besides, she added, the gun was a treasured object. She held it out for us to try.\n\nThat was an enormous honour. The rifle once belonged to Jim Corbett, hunter of man-eating tigers, pioneering conservationist and author of compelling jungle tales.\n\nThe British-Irish naturalist was born in India, became an administrator for the Indian railways and between 1907 and 1938 shot around 33 big cats that had variously killed some 1,200 people. For this, and for his immense knowledge of jungle life, he became near legendary. India\u2019s oldest national park, established in 1936, was partly of his making and was renamed in tribute to him shortly after his death in 1955 \u2013 remarkably, given current post-imperialist thinking, it remains the Jim Corbett National Park today. Reflecting Corbett\u2019s acclaim beyond India, there\u2019s even a species of south-east Asian tiger named after him: panthera tigris corbetti.", "description": "", "authors": ["Harriet O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/Travel/2019/October/jim-corbett-xlarge.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
