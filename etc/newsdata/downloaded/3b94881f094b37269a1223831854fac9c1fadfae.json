Some speculated that the tech giant would make its offering more competitive with its peers around $9.99.\n\nAmid a debate on whether viewers would embrace yet another online content service, both Netflix and Disney saw their stocks tumble. The latter\u2019s upcoming streaming platform is priced at $6.99, while Netflix\u2019s runs from $8.99 up to $15.99.\n\nNetflix ended the session down over 2% around $288, while Disney also shed more than 2% to $136. Meanwhile, streaming content provider Roku (ROKU) swooned by around 11% on the TV+ news.\n\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives called the platform\u2019s pricing \u201ca major shot across the bow\u201d at competitors, including Netflix and Disney.\n\nWall Street \u201cwas anticipating a $7.99-$9.99 price point as clearly Cupertino is looking for market share coming out of the gates with these surprising price points that we loudly applaud,\u201d he added.\n\nGiven the relatively slim number of shows on Apple TV+, some analysts say its immediate effect on the streaming market is likely to be limited.\n\nThe platform \u201cis an interesting start and could turn into an attractive service that combines proprietary content and third-party aggregation, but at this point the limited amount of content available will likely mute user engagement,\u201d analysts at Piper Jaffray wrote on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe do not expect [TV+ and Arcade] to be materially additive to Apple estimates for at least the next couple of years, however, they do re-emphasize that the company is very focused on enhancing services and growing services revenue per user,\u201d the note said.\n\nThe broader market ended little changed, with losses contained by a report that China was considering a deal to purchase more American goods ahead of the next round of trade meetings between U.S. and Chinese negotiators.\n\nRead more\n\nApple announces new 7th generation iPad\n\nApple TV+ finally gets its price: $4.99 per month\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews, LinkedIn,YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "The shares of Netflix and Disney fell on Tuesday, as streaming rival Apple announced its long-awaited Apple Plus subscription would cost $4.99", "authors": ["Javier E.
