Speaking to ITV News, the \u201cLate Night\u201d actress acknowledged that her critics may have a point, but defended herself by saying she doesn\u2019t fly as much as she used to.\n\n\u201cI may well be hypocritical by flying but I\u2019m conscious of flying so I fly much less, but sometimes I have to when I\u2019m working. But I\u2019ll continue to find ways to get to places without flying,\u201d she said.\n\nEMMA THOMPSON SAYS SHE WON'T WORK WITH EX-PIXAR EXECUTIVE JOHN LASSETER, WITHDRAWS FROM MOVIE\n\nThompson continued: \u201cThe message from Extinction Rebellion wasn\u2019t that no one can fly, it was that for decades now we have been asking for clean energy and this has been ignored.\u201d\n\nThe actress\u2019 latest comments echo those she made to the BBC when asked about her flying habits at the protest in April.\n\nEMMA THOMPSON ASKED PRINCE WILLIAM IF SHE COULD KISS HIM DURING HER DAMEHOOD CEREMONY\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, sometimes I have to fly but I don\u2019t fly nearly as much as I did because of my carbon footprint, and I plant a lot of trees,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s always turned back on the individual. \u2018You\u2019re the one who flies, you\u2019re the one who\u2019s using it, you\u2019re the one who wants it.\u2019 The fact of the matter is, everyone has been asking for clean energy for decades. This question and this demand has been made for decades and it has been ignored for decades. So where is the hypocrisy? If I could fly cleanly, I would.\u201d\n\nThompson told ITV News that the only shame she feels for her climate change activism comes from seeing the young members of Extinction Rebellion do so much more.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cThey [Extinction Rebellion members] are willing to put themselves in danger, to get a criminal record, to upset their parents at a time when they should be enjoying their time at school or uni,\u201d she said. \u201cTo meet them, they made me feel so ashamed that we have let them down to such a degree that they were willing to turn their back on their own futures, everything we have been taught, jobs, families... they can't think like that.\u201d", "description": "Actress Emma Thompson said that she may have been\u00a0\u201chypocritical\u201d when she flew thousands of miles to attend an event to protest environmental issues.", "authors": ["Tyler Mccarthy"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/EmmaThompson1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
