It is sad and really heart-breaking because things should not be the way they are.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one can romanticize migration with all its dangers, but it is the ultimate manifestation of our state of despair,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOur very corrupt leaders must outsource the duties of feeding, employment and looking after their citizens to other nations,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is their selfish and divisive leadership styles that have made it impossible for even the most resource-endowed nations like Nigeria, South Africa, Democratic Republic of Congo and others to grow.\u201d\n\nBishop Mark Seitz of El Paso, on the contrary, sees border walls as evil symbols of exclusion and racism, suggesting that porous borders are the humane choice.\n\nThe wall \u201cis not just a tool of national security,\u201d Seitz claimed in a recent pastoral letter. \u201cMore than that, the wall is a symbol of exclusion, especially when allied to an overt politics of xenophobia. It is an open wound through the middle of our sister cities of El Paso and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe wall deepens racially charged perceptions of how we understand the border as well as Mexicans and migrants,\u201d he said. \u201cIt extends racist talk of an \u2018invasion\u2019. It perpetuates the racist myth that the area south of the border is dangerous and foreign and that we are merely passive observers in the growth of narco-violence and the trafficking of human beings and drugs.\u201d\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome", "description": "A Nigerian bishop said Wednesday that he is in favor of border walls because they protect citizens and allow for controlled migration.", "authors": ["Thomas D.
