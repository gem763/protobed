With a direct Eurostar service from London, a slew of new openings \u2013 trendy restaurants, cool hotels, up-and-coming breweries \u2013 and the news that it will host Eurovision 2020, the Netherlands\u2019 plucky second city should definitely be on the shortlist for your next short break.\n\nHere are the best 10 ways to while away a trip.\n\nArchitecture by bike\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nAmsterdam doesn\u2019t have a monopoly on bicycle culture \u2013 the rest of the Netherlands is bike mad too, Rotterdam included. And one of the best ways to see the city\u2019s diverse architecture, from 1970s classics (Piet Blom\u2019s distinctive yellow cube house) to modern-day masterpieces (the sharp-angled Centraal Station, opened in 2014), is from the saddle.\n\nHop on two wheels and explore by renting a bike, or book onto an architecture bike tour with UrbanGuides \u2013 \u20ac25 (\u00a322) for 2.5 hours.\n\nCraft brewery crawl\n\nForget the traditional pub crawl \u2013 Rotterdam has enough exciting craft brewers producing creative, small-batch beers to ensure you can go a whole trip without touching a drop of Heineken. Kaapse Brouwers, which is at the forefront of the Netherlands\u2019 burgeoning craft brewing scene, can be found at Kaapse Maria, its low-key bar-cum-restaurant, and Fenix Food Factory, a cooperative of entrepreneurs all operating out of an old port warehouse that has rejuvenated the area of Katendrecht to the south. Move from there to up-and-coming brewery/bar Thoms, the second brewery in the Netherlands to serve its beer unpasteurised and unfiltered onsite.\n\nGrab a fork\n\nIt\u2019s an exciting time in Rotterdam\u2019s restaurant scene, with plenty of new openings and innovative dining options. For a tour and a meal combined, climb aboard Rottertram \u2013 a vintage tram recently converted into a gourmet restaurant that goes around the city while a four course dinner is served. Op het Dak, meanwhile, is a caf\u00e9 overlooking the Netherlands\u2019 first urban rooftop farm, which uses the garden\u2019s fresh vegetables and herbs in its healthy dishes.\n\nFor fancier fare try De Jong, an insouciant yet welcoming restaurant housed under one of the repurposed railway arches as part of the trendy Hofbogen development. Head chef Jim de Jong\u2019s championing of local, fresh produce means menus change frequently \u2013 and each is a surprise. Diners pick whether they\u2019d like four, five or six courses, share any dietary requirements and then await their fate.\n\nGo back in time\n\nRotterdam was famously bombed in the Second World War. It used to look not unlike Amsterdam, but Hitler put paid to that, and futuristic architecture sprang up where traditional Dutch buildings once stood. But you can still get a window into the past and get your fix of quaint canalside views by heading over to Delfshaven in the west of the city \u2013 it has pretty gabled buildings, a canal and even a windmill, all just a tramride away from the city centre.\n\nQuirky museums\n\nThe city\u2019s superior sense of humour is evidenced by its museums: the Natural History Museum Rotterdam has a permanent exhibition called Dead Animal Tales, which chronicles unusual ways creatures kicked the bucket, including a hedgehog perfectly preserved with its head stuck in a McFlurry container. There\u2019s even a plaque to commemorate when a duck flew into the building and died, before it was subject to the, ahem, sexual advances of another male duck. It was allegedly the first time an act of homosexual necrophilia was witnessed in the species.\n\nArt fix\n\nGalleries abound in Rotterdam, but a trip to Kunsthal is a must \u2013 not least because the building itself is an architectural gem. Its bold design raised the profile of architect Rem Koolhaas, founding partner of Dutch architecture firm OMA, when the building was first opened in 1992. Box-shaped and industrial, it leads visitors through seven exhibition spaces via a sloping, spiralling floor. Entry to the gallery is \u20ac14.\n\nWater taxi\n\nRotterdam is all about water \u2013 it's Europe\u2019s largest port, doncha know. Take advantage of this by travelling in style and catching a water taxi to get around. These black and yellow boats clip along at 50kph and stop at 50 different locations along the port. Passengers can book online or by phone; a short boat trip for two costs about \u20ac12.\n\nTo market, to market\n\nThe city is home to multiple food markets, each with its own unique flavour (pun intended). Markthal is undoubtedly the most eye-catching, housed in a giant, glass-fronted horseshoe with an oversized artwork of technicolour flora and fauna adorning the ceiling. Hundreds of stalls, restaurants and shops are crammed inside, from sit-down places, to grab and go.\n\nThe newest concept on the block is Foodhallen on the ground floor of the Room Mate Bruno hotel on Wilhelminakade. It\u2019s Rotterdam\u2019s very own answer to Lisbon\u2019s popular Time Out market: a cool industrial space with communal seating in the middle and outposts of some of the city\u2019s best-loved restaurants lining the edges for pick\u2019n\u2019mix street food.\n\nFinally, Fenix Food Factory could have been plucked straight out of east London, with bare bulbs strung across concrete walls and mismatching squashy chairs strewn between stalls selling everything from colourful Moroccan spices to exotically flavoured stroopwafels\n\nGo \u2019seiling\n\nNot sailing, but abseiling. Rotterdam\u2019s Euromast offers daredevils the opportunity to jump off and dangle 100m down to the bottom. If you're game, it's \u20ac57.50pp.\n\nFloating garden\n\nMost cities can boast a decent green space, but how many can say they have a floating park? Rotterdam\u2019s Recycled Park is a revolutionary concept, which uses plastic rubbish and debris collected from the Nieuwe Maas River to create a 140m-squared stretch of octagonal structures that float attractively in the water to the east of Wilhelminapier.\n\nAs well as looking good, the islands act as a habitat for minibeasts such as snails, flatworms, larva, beetles and fish.\n\nTravel essentials\n\nGetting there\n\nEurostar operates two services from London St Pancras to Rotterdam a day, with a journey time of just under three and a half hours; from \u00a335 one-way.\n\nStaying there\n\nRoom Mate Bruno has doubles from \u20ac90, room only.\n\nMore information\n\nen.rotterdam.info\u200b", "description": "Rotterdam is having a well-deserved moment.", "authors": ["Helen Coffey"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/11/01/17/ppawpd.jpg"}
