We understand what it means to live at the tip of Africa. But it is a country with a hell of a lot of pride in their national identity.\n\n\"I suppose the history and what \u201995 meant for the country created a new opportunity for people in South Africa.\n\n\"The Springbok is the tool people use as a symbol of hope, a symbol of opportunity. It shows, if you look at the stories of the players in the team, what can be achieved with hard work. I suppose it is wrapped up in the psychology of a lot of people.\n\n\"South Africans love the game. We grow up with it in the schools, young boys play it, and it is a highly supported activity back home.\n\n\"From a young age, you get indoctrinated into the game, and there is no better symbol. When you see a player become a Springbok, they change, and they pass it on to the country.\n\n\"There is a real connection between the Springbok player, and what it means to be a Springbok, and the supporter back home.\"\n\nKick-off on Saturday is at 11:00 (SA time).", "description": "The Springboks know that when they take to the field in Saturday's Rugby World Cup final against England, it will be about more than just rugby.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9376/8da66f11f8894faf99194a16c4a40772.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
