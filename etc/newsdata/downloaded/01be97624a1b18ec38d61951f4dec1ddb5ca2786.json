The main charges include rebellion and sedition.\n\nActivists from the Catalan National Assembly (ANC) and Omnium Cultural, the two biggest grassroots pro-independence groups, have called for rallies across the region when the verdicts are announced.\n\nThere have also been calls for a general strike.\n\nFernando Sanchez, who leads the main anti-separatist group, Sociedad Civil Catalana, told journalists: \u201cWe want to make an appeal for calm and for responsibility.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m scared that there will be violence,\u201d said another demonstrator, a 62-year-old Manuel Rueda.\n\n\u201cAll we want, is to start to live again as we did 10 years ago, without separatist or Spanish flags everywhere, when everybody lived together peacefully,\u201d he added.\n\nIn the Spanish capital Madrid, King Felipe VI attended the traditional military parade, accompanied by Pedro Sanchez, prime minister of the outgoing socialist government, just weeks ahead of fresh parliamentary elections.\n\nThe leaders of all the main opposition parties also attended the Madrid event ahead of the November 10 elections, as did the presidents of all the Spanish regions \u2014 with the exceptions of those from Catalonia and the Basque Country.\n\nFor years now neither region, both of which have strong separatists movements, has attended the event.\n\nMadrid\u2019s military parade, which is broadcast live on television, did not pass off without a hitch.\n\nA Spanish paratrooper who was meant to land in front of the king missed his mark, getting stuck a few feet in the air when his parachute caught on a lamp-post.\n\nAs he waited for help getting free, the king and other members of the royal family applauded him as a sign of support.\n\nThe paratrooper concerned, who had already carried out more than 600 parachute jumps, was unhurt.", "description": "Barcelona (AFP) \u2013 Thousands of people opposed to Catalan independence marched in the region\u2019s capital Saturday, Spain\u2019s national day,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/12/b7a266_today-as-yesterday-catalans-spaniards-saturday-on-spain-national-day-thousands-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
