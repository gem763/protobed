That\u2019s the position Hollyoaks stalwarts Darren and Nancy Osborne (Ashley Taylor Dawson and Jessica Fox) found themselves in before they managed to get out alive.\n\nAnd it\u2019s sure to have huge consequences for Mandy Richardson, who may not be able to come back from this fresh level of betrayal in the ever messy love web of the Hollyoaks Originals. We caught up with Sarah Jayne Dunn, who plays her, to get the lowdown on what comes next.\n\nShe explained to Metro.co.uk: \u2018Now, Darren and Mandy know baby DJ is Luke\u2019s so we play out the aftermath of that \u2013 can they move forward from this; can Darren carry on with DJ knowing that he is Luke\u2019s? It\u2019s a huge emotional rollercoaster for them all. And Ollie is in the mix too \u2013 the fact he kept that big secret is massive and so much has been stirred up from this. There is also the jeopardy of Mandy almost losing Darren in the tunnels so with that on top of the emotion, there is a lot to be processed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018She wants to be with Darren \u2013 she has made it clear that\u2019s where her heart is. Even when they weren\u2019t sure if the baby was Darren or Luke\u2019s, she was quite adamant that she wanted them to be a family. When he disappeared, she was terrified she lost him. And then, he reappears and she has not a clue about what has gone on down there! Naughty Darren! She just wants them to be happy and to repair everything but there\u2019s so much more to it now. So it\u2019s huge.\n\n(Picture: Lime Pictures)\n\n\u2018I think she is always going to have insecurities with Nancy. They were best friends and Mandy betrayed her by getting with her husband and that relationship was ruined. But because they have such a strong history together and have children together, there will always be this insecurity. If she found out what had happened, it would be tough to come back from. It would be tough to trust them again \u2013 Darren did this in the first place with Nancy and has now cheated on Mandy with Nancy again! It\u2019s a whole can of worms \u2013 it\u2019s going to be huge when it comes out!\u2019\n\nOf course, fans have come to expect nothing but chaos between this selection of characters and Sarah heaps praise on the many available storylines that writers can get out of these characters with so much history together.\n\nShe enthused: \u2018I really like how the characters are so intertwined \u2013 I mean it\u2019s so incestuous! Mandy and Luke, Mandy and Darren, Darren and Nancy \u2013 and now Luke and Cindy! And Mandy and Tony too! I just love it. It does make for really fun storytelling \u2013 it\u2019s not one dimensional, there are so many elements to all of these revelations. I hope it\u2019s fun for the viewers to watch how it impacts all these characters.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut where does Mandy\u2019s heart really lie? Will she always class Luke Morgan (Gary Lucy) as her true soulmate or is Darren the one for her? or could there even be a piece of her that still pines for Tony Hutchinson (Nick Pickard)?\n\nSarah responded: \u2018Oh goodness, I don\u2019t know! I love the relationship with Mandy and Darren. I love that they have gone there \u2013 they have this history and were kind of childhood sweethearts. It\u2019s really worked so far \u2013 before all of this, they were in a really good place. Their bubble is bursting and everything is crumbling but if DJ had been Darren\u2019s and none of this happened, they could have had their happy ending but that\u2019s not how soaps go is it?\n\n\u2018I think she will always have feelings for Luke \u2013 whether they could ever be a couple again, I don\u2019t know. They are not good for each other; would they ever go there again? As for Tony \u2013 they always will have a lot of love for each other but I don\u2019t think they\u2019d ever go there again. Besides, Tony and Diane are such a good couple \u2013 I champion them all the way!\u2019\n\nWith another stunt week done and dusted, it\u2019s onto the aftermath and certain drama for Mandy, Luke and Darren. But Sarah has loved being involved in the high octane scenes and marvels that the show can still find unique ways to bring about October carnage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe grinned: \u2018It was great \u2013 it took a few weeks to film, I haven\u2019t done one for a few years. I got to do a bit of stunt woman action so that was fun. It was something different, wasn\u2019t it? I don\u2019t know how they keep coming up with ideas for it every year, it\u2019s mad. I thought it was great, I loved it. It\u2019s nice to have so many of us involved; there are so many storylines intertwined.\u2019\n\nAnd with Hollyoaks going from strength to strength, winning awards and critical acclaim left, right and centre, Sarah couldn\u2019t be prouder of the show. And she is overjoyed to be with the cast and crew as preparations for the 25th anniversary next year get underway.\n\nShe shared: \u2018It\u2019s such a testament to everyone who works on it. We have so many older and new cast who are all great \u2013 the show always has fresh talent at the forefront while always having that core unit of cast and crew who have been there from day one and share that passion. If you\u2019d told me when I started 23 years ago that I\u2019d be here for the 25th anniversary I wouldn\u2019t have believed you. Not because I didn\u2019t have faith for the show but for me personally, I never thought I\u2019d have the privilege of being part of something so special for so long.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s come on leaps and bounds and I do think we are at the strongest it\u2019s ever been. I love that the show explores such strong storylines that other shows aren\u2019t brave enough to do \u2013 I do feel we always go there first and that\u2019s a testament to Bryan and everyone involved. It\u2019s incredible and I can\u2019t wait to celebrate it next year. 25 years \u2013 that\u2019s mad!\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Darren has made a serious mistake.", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/HO-EP-5288-DARREN-NANCY-MANDY-01-9b3d-e1571227185564_1572448649.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
