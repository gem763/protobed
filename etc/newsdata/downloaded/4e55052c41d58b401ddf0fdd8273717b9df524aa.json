That was certainly the case in the third quarter. All but four of the leading candidates spent more money than they raised, creating a \u201cburn rate\u201d of more than 100 percent. The only exceptions were Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) (75 percent) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) (84 percent), South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg (95 percent) and Andrew Yang (43 percent).\n\nAD\n\n(Side note: It seems the guy who wants to give away free money isn\u2019t exactly doing that with his campaign.)\n\nThe highest burn rate from a non-self-funder belonged to Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who raised $4.8 million and spent $7.8 million for a burn rate of 162 percent. That\u2019s important because the Minnesota Democrat is still struggling to make the fifth debate. Having dropped so much cash in the third quarter and not making too much headway in the polls isn\u2019t great, which may explain her more combative debate performance Tuesday.\n\nAD\n\nSpeaking of trouble: Juli\u00e1n Castro\n\nMaking the next debate requires getting to 3 percent in four qualifying national or early-state polls, or getting to 5 percent in two early-state polls. Klobuchar at least has $3.6 million in the bank and one 3 percent poll. The situation for Juli\u00e1n Castro, though, appears more dire.\n\nAD\n\nHe raised less than all but two of the 12 candidates on the debate stage Tuesday ($3.5 million), and he has by far the lowest cash on hand ($672,000). With no qualifying polls thus far, a middling performance Tuesday and with very little in the bank to try to improve his lot, it\u2019s difficult to see how he makes that next debate.\n\nBooker\u2019s gambit pays off\n\nWith 10 days left in the quarter, news leaked out that Sen. Cory Booker was telling supporters he needed to raise at least $1.7 million down the stretch to stay in the campaign. He got it, and it\u2019s about the only thing separating him from his own pretty dire financial situation.\n\nAD\n\nThe New Jersey Democrat has $4.2 million cash on hand thanks to the late $2 million infusion he got. That\u2019s way behind the top five candidates, and it\u2019s also behind Yang ($6.4 million). The good news for Booker is he\u2019s already in the next debate. Now he needs to show some momentum so that he doesn\u2019t have to resort to such gimmicks to raise money.\n\nAD\n\nSteyer\u2019s $47 million self-funding explosion\n\nKlobuchar\u2019s and Castro\u2019s struggle to make the next debate has to be all the more difficult to swallow given the one newcomer in Tuesday\u2019s debate \u2014 billionaire Tom Steyer \u2014 has already qualified for it. Steyer is one of just seven candidates who are set for the fifth debate at this point.\n\nAD\n\nHow has he done it? By absolutely flooding early states with his own money and getting the polls he needs in them. Steyer spent an astounding $47 million in the third quarter, almost all of it from his own pocket and more than doubling what every other candidate spent. Sanders was next in line at $21.3 million.\n\nSanders wins again, right when he needed to show staying power\n\nSanders hasn\u2019t exactly kept pace with Warren in national polls, and some of his early-state poll numbers have waned, but he remains the fundraising champion. For the third time in three quarters, he beat everyone else.\n\nAD\n\nFor the second quarter in a row, Sanders pulled in a little over $25 million and narrowly outpaced the second-place candidate. In the second quarter, the runner-up was Buttigieg ($24.9 million), and in the third it was Warren ($24.7 million).\n\nSanders also has the most cash on hand, at $33.7 million \u2014 a number buoyed by $12.7 million in transfers from his old campaign committee. That suggests, despite the health problems he faced in the past few weeks and the lack of early traction, he can be in this thing for the long haul if he really wants to.\n\nAD", "description": "The candidates just filed their third-quarter reports.
