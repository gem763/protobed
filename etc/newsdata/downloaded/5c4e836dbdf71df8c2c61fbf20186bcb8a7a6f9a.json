I'm not sure'\n\nLabour's Harriet Harman, the longest serving female MP said: 'There needs to be a strong Speaker in the chair to address all the challenges there are at the moment'\n\nA probe into drug use in Westminster in 2013 found evidence of cocaine use inside toilets at the Houses of Parliament, including some just yards from MPs' offices.\n\nTraces of the class A drug were found in nine toilets throughout the Palace Of Westminster.\n\nThe powder was detected in toilets used by guests at Parliament's bars, as well as cubicles a few yards away from MPs' offices - areas where members of the public are restricted from going.\n\nSeveral MPs have been suffered high profile and often tragic drink problems, including the late Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy.\n\nSir Lindsay is one of nine candidates looking to replace Mr Bercow as Speaker when he steps down at the end of the month following a decade in the chair.\n\nMr Bercow, who will also step down as an MP, will take the chair for a final time on October 31 and the election of the next Speaker will take place on November 4.\n\nThe other candidates to replace him are fellow deputy speakers Dame Eleanor Laing and Dame Rosie Winterton, Mother of the House Harriet Harman, Labour MPs Chris Bryant and Meg Hillier, and Conservative MPs Sir Henry Bellingham, Shailesh Vara and Sir Edward Leigh.\n\nWhen questioned on the same issue, Sir Edward said: 'There is a drink problem, though much less so than in the past.'\n\nMr Bercow, who has infuriated Brexiteers over his interventionist policy over Brexit, and been at the heart of a bullying controversy, is to step down at the end of the month\n\nDame Eleanor Laing is the MP for Epping and a former Tory shadow minister\n\nSir Henry disagreed, saying: 'I don't believe there is a drink problem as such. People just need to show judgement, they need to be mature, and honestly some of my colleagues just need to grow up.'\n\nDame Rosie added: 'Does Parliament have a greater drink problem than the world outside? I'm not sure.'\n\nMs Harman reminded her opposition that they face a 'Speaker election like no other' at a 'critical and challenging time for Parliament'.\n\nLabour former minister Chris Bryant said he hated the 'chaos in the chamber'\n\nVeteran select committee chief Meg Hillier (left) and Tory Shailesh Varma (right)\n\nShe added: 'There needs to be a strong Speaker in the chair to address all the challenges there are at the moment.\n\n'And I've been amazed that actually in the street people are talking about the Speaker election coming up.'\n\nShe said in particular many women recognise that Parliament is 'no longer an old boys club', adding: 'That would be fully represented by having a woman in the chair.'\n\nSir Lindsay said his constituents are telling him 'it's time we have a northerner in that seat'.\n\nMr Vara said he would like to be the first non-white Speaker.\n\nHe told journalists: 'Of 157 Speakers we've had so far, there have been none that have been non-white.\n\n'I'd like to think that if I were to become Speaker, that I would send a powerful message to every single child in this country, black, white, brown, boy, girl.\n\n'The message would be very simple, they could say if that bloke Vara can make it, then so can I.'", "description": "Sir Lindsay Hoyle said that the issue needed to be 'addressed' as he and eight other MPs vying to replace John Bercow addressed reporters in Westminster today.", "authors": ["David Wilcock", "Whitehall Correspondent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/15/19496188-0-image-a-77_1570632025763.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
