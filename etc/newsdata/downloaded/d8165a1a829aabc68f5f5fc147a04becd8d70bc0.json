By last Sunday, he could get out of bed and walk to the hospital coffee shop with his wife where they met with friends. He was discharged this past Wednesday (16 October).\n\n\u201cEver since JC opened his eyes that day and woke up, God has been so good to us. I\u2019m surprised by his remarkable progress every day. The same day [he woke up], the ventilator was removed. And then he started walking again . . . Ever since that day, he\u2019s been wanting to go home, go back to work, see his friends,\u201d Claudia says.\n\nClaudia and their daughter, Alliana (14 months), had been travelling with JC when an unidentified man threw a concrete block onto their vehicle from a bridge. It happened on 20 September while the family were travelling on the R566 near Rustenburg. The man then tried to rob them.\n\nClaudia and Alliana weren\u2019t injured but JC\u2019s face was badly damaged. His jaw was broken and nearly all his teeth were knocked out. He\u2019s since had three surgeries to repair his jaw and cheekbones.\n\nThe family had been on their way to visit Claudia\u2019s mother in the Free State.\n\n\u201cThis type of thing really wakes you up. It makes you realise you need to live each day as if it\u2019s your last. I know it\u2019s a clich\u00e9, but that\u2019s how I\u2019m living my life now.\n\n\u201cThe past month\u2019s events have just been overwhelming. My brother took a video of the helicopter taking JC to hospital and I\u2019m watching it over and over. To think how seriously JC was injured and that our daughter and I walked away from that wreck unharmed.\u201d\n\nClaudia has reached out on Facebook to thank everyone for their support. She\u2019s especially grateful to her brother, Henry Vorster (34), who drove to the scene in the middle of the night from Krugersdorp to help them.\n\nJC will be staying with Henry and his family for now to be near the hospital for his follow-up check-ups. He\u2019ll be going home to Rustenburg on Friday.\n\n\u201cI know our little girl is going to be ecstatic to have her daddy back home. I know that little face is going to be beaming,\u201d Claudia says.\n\nAbout the attacker who still hasn\u2019t been identified, she just wonders how anyone could have so much hate in their hearts.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m still full of joy. I still have faith. During the week, I spoke to someone who\u2019s not faithful who asked me why all these things are happening in our country? But I think God\u2019s telling us to have faith \u2013 He won\u2019t come until everyone believes.\u201d", "description": "It\u2019s been less than a month since JC Roos (26), from Rustenburg in North West, was hit in the head by a concrete brick thrown through his bakkie\u2019s windscreen, and he\u2019s now been discharged from hospital.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9492/b6dd7cee40e044ff993d30e1b56c1dd3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
