Oh dear. This really is TV for mouth breathers,\" added another.\n\nA third said: \"Moira, the little mermaid. She can certainly hold her breath for a long time whereas in real life she\u2019d be dead.\"\n\n\"Has Moira got gills or something? Think she just broke a world record,\" said a fourth.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nThe petrol canister had been leaking and a huge explosion ripped through the boat when it collided with the flame from the cooker.\n\nWhen Cain and Moira came out of the water they were surrounded by bits of the demolished boat floating around them.\n\nMoira started screaming for Nate but there was no response or sign of her younger lover anywhere.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nWanting to swim away, Cain said: \"Nobody has survived that. Even if he\u2019s got off that boat...he\u2019s dead.\"\n\nThe pair started swimming back to shore but Maura suddenly spotted Nate floating on a bit of debris.\n\nHowever, Cain wanted to leave his newly discovered son to die in the open water.\n\nHorrified Moira said: \"Cain, please. If he is your son you\u2019ve got to help him. You can\u2019t leave him there just to die.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nCain eventually relented and swam over to injured Nate and told him to open his eyes.\n\nGiving his son a worrying warning, Cain said: \"You\u2019re not going to die...today.\"\n\nCain dragged Nate to shore and into the arms of Moira, then decided to leave the pair to fend for themselves.\n\nMoira shouted at Cain to stay but he got in the car and drove off - leaving them alone on the lakeside with no way of getting to safety.\n\n*Emmerdale airs weekdays on ITV at 7pm with an extra episode on Thursdays at 8pm", "description": "Just as Cain Dingle saved his cheating wife Moira from drowning a fireball ripped the boat apart with Nate still on board", "authors": ["Kyle O'Sullivan", "Image", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20709308.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Emmerdale-explosion.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
