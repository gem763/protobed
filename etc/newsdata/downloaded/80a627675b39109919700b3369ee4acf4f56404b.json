She said prosecutors would discuss with the defense team whether there was any basis to invoke executive privilege.\n\n\u201cWe are attuned to those concerns,\u201d Ms. Donaleski said.\n\nThe prosecutors in the case, from the office of the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York along with the F.B.I., have conducted searches of email and social media accounts, electronic devices and several unidentified premises, she said. They have also subpoenaed records for more than 50 bank accounts.\n\nAnother lawyer for Mr. Parnas, Joseph A. Bondy, stood before a bank of microphones after the hearing and spoke to a crowd of reporters outside the stately pillared courthouse. Reading from a handwritten statement, he said, \u201cWe look forward to defending Mr. Parnas in the court , based on the evidence and not a smear campaign driven by self-serving and misleading leaks, apparently from the highest levels of our government.\u201d He did not respond when asked to identify who was doing the leaking.\n\nMr. Parnas then stepped to the microphones and, also reading from a handwritten statement, said, \u201cMany false things have been said about me and my family in the press and media recently.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI look forward to defending myself vigorously in court, and I am certain that in time, the truth will be revealed and I will be vindicated. In the end, I put my faith in God.\u201d", "description": "The connection was made as two associates of Rudolph W.
