So, if each share is worth $1,671.56 according to pre-market trading on Friday, that would give Bezos's Amazon stock a value of around $96 billion.\n\nPrior to Thursday's Amazon stock price tumble, Bezos's stock had been valued at around $102 billion, which suggests Bezos's overall net worth (which stood at $111 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index as of Thursday) has fallen by around $6 billion, to $105 billion.\n\nBill Gates could retake the crown of world's richest person on Friday. Eric Vidal/Reuters\n\nThe upshot is that if Amazon's stock price tumble holds to the market close on Friday \u2013 and provided nothing wild suddenly happens to Microsoft's own share price \u2013 Bezos will lose his crown of world's richest man to Bill Gates, who has a net worth of $107 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nBezos has held the title of world's richest person uncontested since October 2017, when his net worth overtook that of Gates.", "description": "Amazon's stock price took a tumble on Thursday, with Jeff Bezos's net worth likely to dip below Bill Gates's net worth as a result.", "authors": ["Charlie Wood"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db2c904dee0196455024855?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
