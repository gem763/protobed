His journal, which will be in three parts, began yesterday, here.\n\nFabiana Rosales does not join us in person, but she joins us by video hook-up, for a press conference. She looks impossibly young \u2014 like a college student. Yet she has considerable responsibility on her shoulders, and she plays an important role.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a sense, she is First Lady of Venezuela \u2014 because her husband, the opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3, is recognized as the legitimate president by many, including the U.S. government. Fabiana (as it seems natural to call her) is 27 years old, and she handles herself with poise and grace.\n\nShe details the horrors besetting her country, horrors that are well-known: the starvation, the desperation, and so on. The news has just been reported that five children have died in a particular hospital, owing to lack of care.\n\nI ask Fabiana what her mood is. How her spirits are. She has faith in God, she says, but she is rocked by news such as the death of those children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepeatedly, she speaks of the \u201cusurpation\u201d of power in Venezuela. By this she means that President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro rules illegitimately, unconstitutionally. She says that she and her movement have a single agenda item, a single demand, really: the departure of Maduro from Miraflores Palace.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2022 Addressing the Freedom Forum at large \u2014 activists, dissidents, people in and out of prison \u2014 Zeid Raad al-Hussein says, \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been in a room with so many troublemakers \u2014 the world\u2019s troublemakers. You naughty, naughty people.\u201d\n\nZeid (as all call him) is a royal, a Jordanian prince. Much of his life, he has given to human rights. He was high commissioner for human rights at the United Nations. Before that, he was Jordan\u2019s ambassador to the U.N., and to the United States. He began his diplomatic career by working for the U.N. in the former Yugoslavia. These days, he teaches at the Penn law school.\n\nI\u2019ve done a podcast with Zeid, here. We cover the waterfront, or a long stretch of it. Tell you this: He acts like a prince. Whatever his birth \u2014 royal, common, high, low \u2014 his comportment is princely, which is nice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2022 Ji Seong-ho is one of my favorite people. A lot of others feel the same way about him. He is a phenomenally brave North Korean defector, or escapee. He lost an arm and a leg. (I am speaking literally.) His grandmother died of starvation. His father was tortured to death. Seong-ho, it seems to me, is always cheerful. I have seen him many times over the past several years, and his countenance is always cheerful. Indeed, he expresses an ebullience.\n\nI ask him how he\u2019s doing, body and soul. Okay, he says. If he were suffering \u2014 I\u2019m not sure he would let it show.\n\n\u2022 Thae Yong-ho is also a defector \u2014 a different kind of defector. He was a high-ranking diplomat for North Korea, and jumped ship. This was an extraordinarily brave, extraordinarily risky act. (It remains risky, in that Thae is an obvious target for Kim Jong-un\u2019s regime. I don\u2019t mean a rhetorical target.)\n\nI have done a Q&A with Thae, here. And I will write a proper piece about him soon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet me give you one tidbit. Speaking on the stage of the Freedom Forum, Thae says that, in North Korea, you were allowed to read Dickens: Oliver Twist. Why? Because it showed England, and the West, in a dismal light.\n\nA few weeks back, I talked with Vladimir Bukovsky, the great Russian dissident. I asked him how he had learned English. He learned in the Gulag, mainly. He taught himself English, with the aid of books in a prison library or two. (For the relevant installment of my series on Bukovsky, go here.)\n\nThe libraries had Dickens and Dreiser \u2014 because of the picture they drew of the capitalist West.\n\nAs in the Soviet Union, so in North Korea. An interesting tidbit, I think. (Wonder what Dickens would say!)\n\n\u2022 Thae has an interlocutor onstage: Robert Kelly, the American scholar of the Koreas. He is a professor at Pusan National University, in South Korea. I have done a Q&A with him, too. It will be available in the next few days. Kelly is a very sharp, very helpful scholar.\n\nHe is also world famous. How\u2019s that? He\u2019s the \u201cBBC Dad\u201d \u2014 the man whose kids and wife came delightfully into the room, as he was being interviewed. (Remember?) A classic, ever-gladdening moment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2022 In past Oslo journals, I have spoken of Viktor Yushchenko and his noble bearing. He was president of Ukraine from 2005 to 2010. You recall that Russian intelligence tried to kill him through poisoning. They did not succeed, though they disfigured his face.\n\nAnyway, you have never seen such dignity, or I haven\u2019t. I see Yushchenko again in Oslo. In his life, he has exemplified the British motto \u201cKeep calm and carry on.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Timothy Snyder is a historian of Eastern Europe, the Holocaust, etc. He is a professor at Yale. He is steeped in the 20th century, with its twin horrors of Nazism and Communism. I have done an expansive Q&A with him here.\n\nI would like to report a little of what he says on the stage of the Freedom Forum. He speaks of \u201clessons from history.\u201d And he has a series of points that begin \u201cWe know from the 20th century \u2026\u201d Let me paraphrase a few of them, please:\n\nWe know from the 20th century that it\u2019s very important not to obey in advance \u2014 that, in the beginning at least, it\u2019s not so much that dictators take power as that they receive it, from people who are willing to normalize along with them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe know from the 20th century that language matters \u2014 that leaders prepare us for regime changes by working the language, and that we must be careful ourselves to speak precisely and honestly.\n\nWe know from the 20th century to be wary of states of emergency. Authoritarians prepare the way for their rule by saying, \u201cThis is just for now, because of exceptional circumstances.\u201d But that turns out to be forever.\n\nWe know from the 20th century \u2014 and, of course, all others \u2014 that truth matters. People who take your freedom away, first take the idea of truth away. In the 20th century, the idea of truth was taken away and replaced by myths. Today, it is likelier to be replaced by total cynicism. \u201cNothing matters, nothing is true\u201d \u2014 the spirit of \u201cwhatever.\u201d\n\nAs Snyder speaks, I am reminded of an article that Sir Roger Scruton published two years ago on the \u201cpost-truth age\u201d: here. The Internet, he said, is a \u201cgreat seething cauldron of opinions, most of them anonymous, in which every kind of malice and fantasy swamps the still small voice of humanity and truth.\u201d\n\n\u2022 At the Oslo Freedom Forum, there are always Communists out front, for a bit, protesting. Want to see this year\u2019s crop? (Same as the other years, probably.)\n\nWhen people try to protest in the countries these guys like \u2014 Cuba, Venezuela, etc. \u2014 horrific things happen to those people. I wonder whether our guys realize that, and, if so, what they think about it. (\u201cFreedom for me, but not for thee.\u201d)\n\n\u2022 Near the theater where the Forum\u2019s main activities are taking place, there is a Mulligan\u2019s Irish Pub. Is there a city in the world that doesn\u2019t have a Mulligan\u2019s Irish Pub? If so, that problem should be rectified, ASAP.\n\n\u2022 Every year, I come to Oslo, and every year, this kid is upset. He never calms down. When I mentioned this on Twitter, a reader said, \u201cIf you had to spend the Norwegian winter outdoors naked, you\u2019d be upset too.\u201d A fair point.\n\n\u2022 I meet a woman \u2014 a Norwegian woman \u2014 named Nina. \u201cLike Grieg\u2019s wife,\u201d I say. \u201cYes!\u201d she says. \u201cIn fact, when my father called my grandmother \u2014 my mom\u2019s mother \u2014 to tell her about me, she did not like the name Nina very much. She said that it did not sound very Norwegian. But when my dad reminded her it was Mrs. Grieg\u2019s name, she felt a lot better about it.\u201d\n\nHeh. Good move.\n\n\u2022 There is a guest here, a speaker, from Somalia. Her name is Fartuun Adan. With her husband, Elman Ali Ahmed, she worked for peace and human rights. In the early 1990s, when threats against the couple intensified, they agreed that Fartuun would flee with their children to Canada while Elman stayed behind to continue the work. In 1996, he was assassinated (by warlords).\n\nAmazingly, Fartuun returned to the country ten years later, to run a foundation named after her husband. She helps people, of various sorts, in various ways. For instance, she helps rape victims, of whom there a many. A great many. Like Congo, Somalia has a \u201crape culture.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a mom,\u201d Fartuun tells us. \u201cI have girls.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe has received recognition in several quarters, including the U.S. State Department, which named her an International Woman of Courage.\n\nThe things people go through. The good they do regardless, or because of.\n\nThanks for joining me, dear readers, and I\u2019ll see you next time for our third and final part.", "description": "On a Venezuelan first lady, North Korean defectors, and more.", "authors": ["Jay Nordlinger", "Mairead Mcardle", "Jonah Goldberg", "David French", "Matthew Continetti", "Brian Stewart", "Jack Crowe", "Tobias Hoonhout", "Kyle Smith", "Read More"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/fabiana-rosales-2.jpg?fit=1200%2C700&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-06-07"}
