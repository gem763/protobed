That gives her return in Maleficent: Mistress of Evil some real heft. It\u2019s delightful to have her back in a leading role; though Jolie\u2019s stardom has often been defined by the tabloid dramas that surround her, she\u2019s an actor who can turn the thinnest scripts into something compelling (think Salt or Wanted). Whenever she\u2019s present in Mistress of Evil, boasting jutting cheekbones and fang-like pearly whites, it\u2019s impossible to look away.\n\nUnfortunately, Jolie isn\u2019t a constant presence in this new film, since there are so many pressing matters to attend to in the neighboring kingdoms of the Moors (the fairy realm governed by Maleficent and Princess Aurora) and Ulstead, a militaristic land that\u2019s the home of Phillip (Harris Dickinson), Aurora\u2019s Prince Charming. As Aurora and Phillip plan their wedding, the much-feared Maleficent is invited to Ulstead to meet his parents and broker diplomatic relations. The only problem is that Phillip\u2019s mother, Queen Ingrith (Michelle Pfeiffer), is a snooty human supremacist who sees Maleficent and her magical subjects as a plague to be eradicated.\n\nIf this all sounds complicated, well, I\u2019m not even describing half of the manic side-plots that populate the script, credited to Linda Woolverton, Noah Harpster, and Micah Fitzerman-Blue. There are living mushrooms, a goblin-like mad scientist named Lickspittle (Warwick Davis) who\u2019s working on weapons of death, and a group of horn-sporting, self-dubbed \u201cdark fey\u201d warriors who resemble Maleficent and live in a giant cocoon. Would it be too much to compare the two leaders of this warrior community, played by Chiwetel Ejiofor and Ed Skrein, to Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X, respectively? Probably, but that\u2019s the comparison the film is trying to set up.\n\nAll of these competing elements lead to conflict as Ingrith tries to simultaneously drive a wedge between her son and future daughter-in-law and wipe out Maleficent and her fairy populace. At one point, it\u2019s suggested that Ingrith\u2019s hatred is driven by an extreme flower allergy, which seems an odd justification for a set piece in which Ingrith locks adorable forest creatures in a church and tries to gas them to death. This is a movie chock-full of heady imagery that it can\u2019t get a handle on, and so the allegories at work don\u2019t quite connect.\n\nThe first act of Mistress of Evil is lots of fun\u2014essentially a magical Meet the Parents. The second act is filled with action sequences that take place in near-total darkness, likely a cost-saving visual-effects measure that robs whole scenes of their tension. But the film\u2019s final showdown, a pitched war in which Jolie and Pfeiffer lock horns on the battlefield, is a blast. Mistress of Evil never manages to justify the return of all these characters, but in delving deeper into its fantasy world, it at least avoids the cardinal sin of being forgettable.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.
