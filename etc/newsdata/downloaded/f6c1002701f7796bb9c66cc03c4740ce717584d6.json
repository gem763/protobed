Brussels is pushing for tariffs of around $10 billion on American goods in parallel process to be decided by the WTO early next year.\n\nOn Tuesday, the head of Irish budget airlines group Ryanair (RYA.I) urged the United States and EU to pull back from the brink of a tariff war and said neither side\u2019s aviation industry would survive a long dispute.\n\nBut Peter Harrell, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Center for a New American Security, saw no immediate peace deal.\n\n\u201cMy sense is that there will be a settlement only after both sides have imposed tariffs on each other,\u201d he said.\n\nFRAGILE MARKETS\n\nWhile the level of tariffs amounts to less than three days worth of annual trade between Europe and the United States, importers led by U.S. airlines that buy Airbus jets have urged Washington to be selective when choosing industries to hit in order to avoid causing collateral damage to the U.S. economy.\n\nThe WTO award in the dispute could fuel rising trade tensions, diplomats say.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A logo is pictured outside the World Trade Organization (WTO) headquarters next to a red traffic light in Geneva, Switzerland, October 2, 2018.

The EU has in turn retaliated.\n\nThe Trump administration has concluded tariffs were effective in bringing China to the negotiating table over trade, and in convincing Japan to open its agricultural market to U.S. products. Washington is unlikely to skip the opportunity to implement tariffs in the case over aircraft subsidies, according to current and former U.S. officials.\n\nAirbus has said this would lead to a \u201close-lose\u201d trade war and has published a video stressing its contribution to the U.S. industry through local assembly plants and 4,000 direct jobs, headlined \u201cTogether, let\u2019s keep American aerospace great\u201d.", "description": "The United States won approval on Wednesday to impose tariffs on$7.5 billion worth of European goods over illegal EU subsidies handed to Airbus, threatening to trigger a tit-for-tat transatlantic trade war as the global economy falters.", "authors": ["Philip Blenkinsop", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436274677&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF910SL"}
