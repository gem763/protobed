Here Are 5 Trendy Denim Styles to Wear Now", "language": "en", "published_at": "2019-09-03", "text": "Are you feeling jean fatigue, even though you have approximately a dozen pairs of skinnies, mom jeans and kick flares in your wardrobe? Uh, same. And that\u2019s partially due to the fact that those styles are on their way out and being replaced by some more modern silhouettes. So, if you\u2019re in the market to upgrade your go-to jeans, check out these five styles that will be trending throughout 2019.\n\n\n\nRELATED: Square-Toe Shoes Are Back\u2014but We Promise They\u2019re Better Than They Sound\n\nView photos\n\nLong Hems\n\nBad news for short girls but great news for the leggy ones among us: Hemlines are going long. That is, cropped denim is so last season and heel-grazing blues are stepping in as the must-wear trend. Grab your favorite pair of heels, make sure your tailor is on speed dial and let those hems go.\n\nGet the look: Good American ($179); AG ($178); Goldsign ($275); Trave ($268); Dries Van Noten ($320)\n\nView photos\n\nWide-Leg\n\nIt\u2019s time to give your thighs (and calves, for that matter) a lot of breathing room. Wide silhouettes are slowly infiltrating stores\u2014for good reason. Unlike a flare, the width of these jeans is almost the same from hip to heel, in a way that flatters almost every body type. Keep in mind that these jeans shouldn\u2019t look sloppy, so make sure they still fit snugly at the waist! This will help make sure you don\u2019t get lost in all that billowy fabric.\n\nGet the look: ASOS Curve ($56); Topshop ($90); Habitual ($228); Citizens of Humanity ($240); Ksubi ($260)", "description": "Are you feeling jean fatigue, even though you have approximately a dozen pairs of skinnies, mom jeans and kick flares in your wardrobe?
