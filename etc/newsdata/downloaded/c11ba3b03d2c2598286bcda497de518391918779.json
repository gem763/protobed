(Stephanie Jenzer/CBC)\n\n\"I love her insight into the world, the way she can see people and women.\"\n\nFor Annamika Singh, a publishing professional who was also in line, the excitement reminds her \"of when I was a kid and Harry Potter was coming out.\"\n\n\"It's nice that an author can generate this kind of attention again. Because I feel like with movies and shows and documentaries, anything very visual, that generates lots of attention, lots of audiences,\" she said.\n\n\"I'm just very happy so many people are going to show up and pretty much all around the world people are going to be counting down to get their hands on a copy.\"\n\nAnnamika Singh says excitement around The Testaments reminds her of the buzz for the Harry Potter books. (Stephanie Jenzer/CBC)\n\nAtwood's 1985 novel \u2014 about women forced into sexual slavery by the theocratic state of Gilead \u2014 recently found new resonance due to both the rise of political extremism in the West and the Emmy-winning TV series starring Elisabeth Moss.\n\nFor decades, Atwood was not interested in penning a sequel.\n\nThen, \"history changed,\" she told CBC's The Current.\n\n\"Instead of going away from Gilead, we turned around and started coming back towards Gilead,\" she told interim host Laura Lynch.\n\nThe Testaments is set 15 years after the events of The Handmaid's Tale, about women forced into sexual slavery by the theocratic state of Gilead. (Stephanie Jenzer/CBC)\n\nThe new novel, which has largely been kept under wraps, is told by three narrators connected to Handmaid's narrator, Offred.\n\nAtwood said she focused on exploring what happened to Offred's two daughters: the one who was taken before Gilead was created, whose name was never revealed in the book, and the other she was pregnant with in its last chapter. The third narrator in The Testaments, Atwood said, is Aunt Lydia, who in the original helped indoctrinate other women with the beliefs of Gilead society.\n\nFollowing the launch, Atwood is scheduled to appear at a live Q&A event on Tuesday at the National Theatre in London. It will be beamed around the globe, including to more than 100 cinemas across Canada.\n\nAtwood is also set to take the novel on a worldwide tour this month \u2014 which will include nine Canadian stops.", "description": "Margaret Atwood was in London late Monday night, joined by hundreds of fans waiting for the midnight release of her new novel, The Testaments, the highly anticipated sequel to The Handmaid's Tale.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5277095.1568075162!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/britain-women-atwood.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
