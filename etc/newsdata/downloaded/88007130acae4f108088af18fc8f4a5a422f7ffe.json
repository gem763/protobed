Pyatt to back off an investigation involving that firm, Burisma Holdings, and its founder. According to interview notes, Shokin claimed Pyatt -- currently the ambassador to Greece -- told him to handle that investigation \u201cwith white gloves.\u201d\n\nEX-UKRAINIAN PROSECUTOR SAID HE WAS TOLD TO BACK OFF PROBE OF BIDEN-LINKED FIRM, FILES SHOW\n\nShokin said his \u201cinvestigations stopped out of fear of the United States.\u201d\n\nIn that interview, Shokin also claimed that former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko told him he should not investigate Burisma, \u201cas it was not in the interest of Joe and/or Hunter Biden.\u201d Shokin claimed Poroshenko told him that due to his investigation, Joe Biden held \u201cup to one billion dollars in U.S. aid to Ukraine.\u201d Poroshenko eventually removed Shokin.\n\nBiden's campaign and congressional Democrats reject these allegations, maintaining that Biden was only involved due to corruption concerns surrounding Shokin and casting Giuliani's claims as \"debunked conspiracy theories.\"\n\nThe interview notes, though, align with a European court affidavit from Shokin, which was published by The Hill last week. The affidavit came as part of an Austrian extradition case involving another wealthy Ukrainian businessman, Dmitry Firtash.\n\nThe sworn affidavit states that Poroshenko asked him to resign \u201cdue to pressure from the U.S. Presidential administration, in particular from Joe Biden.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn several occasions, President Poroshenko asked me to have a look at the criminal case against Burisma and consider the possibility of winding down the investigative actions in respect of this company,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut I refused to close this investigation.\u201d\n\nShokin went on to state he was \u201cforced to leave office, under direct and intense pressure from Joe Biden and the US administration.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn my conversations with Poroshenko at the time, he was emphatic that I should cease my investigations regarding Burisma,\u201d he stated. \u201cWhen I did not, he said that the US (via Biden) were refusing to release the USD$ 1 billion promised to Ukraine. He said that he had no choice, therefore, but to ask me to resign.\u201d\n\nDespite his claims, Shokin, on both sides of the Atlantic, had been widely accused of corruption.\n\n\u201cHis reputation for investigating corruption in Ukraine\u2014whether it had to do with Hunter Biden\u2019s firm or the broader plague of deep, embedded and systematic corruption in Ukraine\u2014he didn\u2019t have a shining reputation,\u201d John Hannah, former national security adviser to former Vice President Dick Cheney, told Fox News' \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom\u201d Thursday. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t simply opposed by the U.S. administration at that time ... but by the entire trans-Atlantic alliance in Europe.\u201d\n\nHannah added that if Shokin has \u201creal evidence\u201d that \u201cintense pressure was brought on him to go easy on Hunter Biden,\u201d he should come forward. \u201cBut knowing this guy\u2019s reputation, I\u2019m a little skeptical of the charges he\u2019s making at this point in time, but we need to get the facts, obviously,\u201d Hannah said.\n\nPoroshenko has also told reporters that Biden never asked him to open or close any cases.\n\nYet Fox News has obtained notes from another interview Giuliani conducted\u2014with Yuriy Lutsenko, the former Ukrainian prosecutor who replaced Shokin and eventually closed the Burisma probe.\n\nAccording to the notes of the interview, conducted in New York City in January 2019, Lutsenko said he \u201cbelieves Mr. Viktor Shokin ... is honest.\u201d\n\nLutsenko, in the interview notes, did not weigh in on why the investigation into Burisma was closed or Biden\u2019s involvement -- but did say he \u201cbelieves Hunter Biden receives millions of dollars in compensation from Burisma.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear how much money Hunter Biden made while serving on the board of the firm, but reports have estimated he made up to $50,000 per month. With reports indicating he served for about five years, he could have made millions at that rate.\n\nAllies of Biden have maintained that his intervention prompting the firing of Shokin had nothing to do with his son, but rather was tied to the corruption concerns.\n\nDEMOCRATS SET SIGHTS ON BARR IN EVER-EXPANDING INVESTIGATION\n\nBut the new material is being touted by Trump allies, as they try to turn the tables on Democrats investigating him for trying to pressure Ukraine into investigating the family.\n\nTrump even doubled down on those calls, telling reporters Thursday: \u201cI would think that if they were honest about it, they would start a major investigation into the Bidens.\u201d\n\nIn a statement to Fox News on Wednesday, Giuliani said the interviews were conducted before Biden announced his presidential run and the allegations were brought to him.\n\n\u201cI explored them as part of my duty as an attorney to show that the crimes committed, were not by my client, but by Democrats. I was not seeking to investigate Joe Biden. I was not investigating Joe Biden,\u201d Giuliani said.\n\nThe notes from Giuliani\u2019s interviews were shared with Fox News by sources familiar with the \u201curgent\u201d briefing held by State Department Inspector General Steve Linick on Wednesday with aides from top congressional committees. A State Department spokesman confirmed that Linick shared \u201crelevant\u201d files with Congress.\n\nLinick told aides in the meeting that he received the files in the spring but did not know the sender. Fox News has learned that the original sender was, in fact, Giuliani. Linick forwarded the files to the FBI for further investigation in June, but last week, was given permission by the FBI to share the files with Congress and said they were relevant to congressional interviews being conducted, according to sources.\n\nBut Democrats are casting the documents as a disinformation campaign to distract from Trump controversies.\n\n\u201cThe documents provided by the inspector general included a package of disinformation, debunked conspiracy theories, and baseless allegations in an envelope marked \u2018White House\u2019 and containing folders labeled \u2018Trump Hotel,\u2019\u201d House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel and Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThese documents also reinforce concern that the president and his allies sought to use the machinery of the State Department to further the president\u2019s personal political interests.\u201d\n\nThe new documents surfaced amid the uproar surrounding Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he sought an investigation into the Bidens\u2019 Ukraine dealings. That phone call sparked an impeachment inquiry in the House of Representatives and has the Trump administration facing a new round of subpoenas. The inquiry was touched off by a still-anonymous whistleblower's complaint.\n\nDemocrats have claimed that the call revealed a quid pro quo, saying Trump tied his request to investigate the Bidens to military aid. Trump reportedly ordered his staff to freeze nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine a few days before the phone call with Zelensky, a detail that fueled impeachment calls. However, the call transcript did not show Trump explicitly mentioning the aid as a bargaining chip, and Trump has denied doing so.", "description": "A batch of newly released documents, including court filings\u00a0as well as notes from interviews conducted by\u00a0Rudy Giuliani, have put the spotlight back on Biden family dealings in Ukraine\u2014even as\u00a0House Democrats'\u00a0impeachment probe\u00a0zeroes in on\u00a0President Trump\u2019s push to convince Kiev to investigate them.", "authors": ["Brooke Singman", "Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News.
