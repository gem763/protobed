Lehtikuva/Martti Kainulainen via REUTERS\n\nResponding to voters\u2019 concerns about climate change, Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s ruling coalition has promised to present plans on Friday to make the economy greener and put it on track to meet European Union emissions targets by 2030.\n\nScholz said the government would finance the measures with existing funds and new revenue streams expected to be generated under the climate plans rather than abandon the balanced budget policy and go on a fiscal splurge.\n\n\u201cFor me, we have sufficient options for action that we should first exhaust before such a discussion makes sense,\u201d Scholz told a news conference with other senior figures from his Social Democrats (SPD), junior partner in Merkel\u2019s coalition.\n\nHis remarks show how strong resistance remains within the coalition to abandoning the balanced budget despite pressure at home and abroad to support Europe\u2019s largest economy, on the brink of recession, by borrowing to boost public investment.\n\nThe climate package is expected to include measures including extending grants for electric car buyers, expanding a network of charging stations, raising road taxes for polluting vehicles and improving heating systems for buildings.\n\nThe coalition partners are divided on how to finance Germany\u2019s march toward a green future, with Merkel\u2019s conservatives cast as more eager to ensure that the burden of financing the measures does not hurt German industry. The SPD wants to protect low earners.\n\nFUNDING OPTIONS\n\nAnother Social Democrat, budget policy expert Johannes Kahrs, earlier said the climate package would cost the government 4-5 billion euros per year initially. There was money in an energy and climate fund that could be used.\n\n\u201cI think we can rearrange funds in the remainder of the budget so that we think we can start this without new taxes,\u201d Kahrs said.\n\nIncome would also come from whatever the coalition parties compromise on, be it an emissions certificate trading system or a CO2 tax.\n\n\u201cThis must be integrated into this budget and then consolidated step-by-step, because you have to reconfigure the whole industrial landscape, the whole country, that could also be a big job driver and economic package,\u201d Kahrs said.\n\nHe said the state should help so that people on small and medium incomes or commuters would not face additional burdens but should instead get subsidies to buy new cars or switch their heating systems.\n\nSources said last week that a windfall of 5 billion euros or more this year from lower borrowing costs could help finance the climate package.\n\nThe climate protection measures the government wants to unveil on Friday will cost at least 40 billion euros until 2023, a person briefed on the talks told Reuters on Saturday.\n\nScholz said he wanted to increase taxes on domestic flights in a bid to tackle CO2 emissions, telling Bild in a video interview on the newspaper\u2019s website: \u201cWe have the ticket tax and we want to increase it for domestic flights.\u201d", "description": "The German government has other potential options for funding a planned climate package before it need consider sacrificing its \"black zero\" balanced-budget policy, Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said on Monday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430436733&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F0SR", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
