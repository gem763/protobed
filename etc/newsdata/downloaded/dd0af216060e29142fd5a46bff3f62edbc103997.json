He was arrested on allegations of \"attempting to purchase and transfer advanced American military radar equipment via Dubai to Iran\".\n\nThe reports said Dehbashi had been working on a \"skin cancer detection device\" at the time of his arrest and that he had dismissed the charges as \"a misunderstanding\" and \"unfair\".\n\nIn Australia, Ms King and Mr Firkin said they were \"extremely happy and relieved to be safely back in Australia with those we love\".\n\n\"While the past few months have been very difficult, we know it has also been tough for those back home who have been worried for us,\" they said in a statement released through Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.\n\n\"We are grateful for the efforts of the Australian Government in helping secure our release, and we thank our family and friends for their love and support.\n\n\"While we understand the intense public interest, we do not wish to comment further at this time and request the media let us and our families get back to our normal lives.\n\n\"We know there are others who remain in detention in Iran, including a fellow Australian, and believe intense media coverage may not be helpful for efforts to bring them home.\"\n\nMs King was camping with Mr Firkin near a military site in Jajrood near Tehran when the pair were arrested by the Revolutionary Guard on August 9 for reportedly flying a drone without a licence.\n\nThe couple, who live in Perth, Western Australia, had been travelling across Asia for months, chronicling their journey regularly on YouTube and Instagram.", "description": "Jolie King, a British Australian travel blogger who was imprisoned in Iran\u00a0with her fianc\u00e9, has been released from prison.
