USA TODAY\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2013 A wildfire whipped by the treacherous Santa Ana winds jumped two freeways northwest of Los Angeles overnight Friday, consuming 4,700 acres, damaging at least 25 homes and forcing the evacuation of more than 100,000 people, authorities said.\n\n\"This is a very dynamic fire,\" Los Angeles Fire chief Ralph Terrazas told reporters Friday, warning that the fire \u2014 dubbed the Saddleridge fire \u2014 was devouring 800 acres an hour. The blaze erupted late Thursday along the northern tier of the San Fernando Valley.\n\nTerrazas said the fire, as of Friday morning, was \"zero\" contained. The most immediate task, he said, was to use helicopters and \"super scooper,\" water-carrying, fixed-wing aircraft to establish some fire lines and stop it from spreading.\n\nAuthorities on Friday reported two people have died: A man in his 50s went into cardiac arrest and died near the Saddleridge fire.\n\nOne person was killed was killed in Riverside County, east of Los Angeles, in the Sandalwood fire that earlier swept through a hilltop mobile home park, destroying 74 structures and damaging 16 others in Calimesa.\n\nThe chief said some 1,000 area firefighters battling the Saddleridge fire had been ordered to stay on the scene during the ordeal, instead of returning home at night.\n\n\"Nobody is going home right away,\" he said. \"This event is going to take a few days.\"\n\nLos Angeles police chief Michel Moore said the evacuation orders covered 23,000 residences, or around 100,000 people.\n\nHe urged residences to evacuate the areas immediately when ordered. The chief said people \"fighting the fire with garden hoses\" only endanger themselves and first responders who are trying to clear the area.\n\nPower outages: PG&E apologizes for not being 'adequately prepared'\n\nHe said one person, a man in his 50s who had been speaking with first responders at the time, had died of a cardiac arrest since the fire broke out.\n\nAuthorities said the Saddleridge blaze started as a brush fire in Sylmar, the northernmost neighborhood of Los Angeles, and quickly spread, driven by the hot, dry Santa Ana winds that sweep down from the deserts and across coastal Southern California.\n\nSeveral homes were set ablaze in Granada Hills, and the Los Angeles fire department said an \"unknown number\" of homes were at risk.\n\nIn the Santa Susana Mountains near Porter Ranch, a Los Angeles neighborhood, the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility was evacuated and surrounded by firefighters and engines from both LA county and city departments fighting fires \"in and around\" the facility, a SoCal Gas update said.\n\nA red flag warning was in effect in Southern California through Saturday evening, with winds expected to reach as high as 60 mph and some gusts hitting 70 mph in the mountains. Red flag warnings are issued when warm temperatures, very low humidities, and stronger winds are expected to combine to produce an increased risk of fire danger.\n\nThe fire forced the closing of numerous roadways, including the 210 Freeway and the 5 Freeway, causing a massive traffic jam.\n\nHundreds of truckers were waylaid by the chaos, unable to get past highway patrol checkpoints on some of the region's busiest interstates.\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s packages are going to be late,\" said Dee Carter, of Aurora, Colorado, who was hauling Amazon deliveries from a warehouse in Fontana, California, to Sacramento.\n\nCarter, whose big rig was parked by the side of the 118 Freeway, was trying without luck to reroute his way around the closures. Then suddenly, as he was settling down to make steak and eggs in his sleeper cab for breakfast, the freeway reopened.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Newsom: 'Greed' and 'mismangement' led to widespread power cuts\n\nFor Eyad Jarjour, it was not the first time that a wildfire had crept within feet of the hillside home on Jolette Avenue near the Porter Ranch area of Los Angeles where he has lived for 14 years.\n\nBut this time it burned two of his neighbor\u2019s homes to the ground only feet away on the quiet cul-de-sac and crept into his backyard. He said he escaped with his family, Including two elderly inlaws, at the first hint his home was in danger, about 9:30 p. m. PST Thursday. When he returned at 3 a.m., his neighbors\u2019 houses were in flames.\n\n\u201cIt took us about 10 minutes to evacuate,\u201c Jarjour said. But it hurts. \u201cThese neighbors are our family... It\u2019s a cul-de-sac. We know each other. We care about each other.\u201c\n\nHe said he got out with just a few necessities, important papers and bills, based on past evacuation experience.\n\nHe left again and was relieved when he returned at 10 a.m. Friday morning to discover his house of been saved. The air was still thick with smoke and ash, fire crews at the ready. But the danger had appeared to have passed.\n\nHe inspected the remains of one of the houses that had burned to the ground. Water squirted from a broken pipe and flames from an open gas line were still visible. A burned out 1960s classic muscle car was parked next to the house.\n\nTragic as it was, the wildfire was not unexpected by Jarjour.\n\n\u201cWe expect this to happen because we live in a fire hazard area,\u201c he said.\n\nAnother family on Jolette Avenue did not wait to get out when they saw flames. A house had caught fire at the end of the street.\n\n\u201cI saw the house burning and I said \u2018Oh my God,\u2019\u201d recalled Rose Long as she surveyed the damage Friday. Their house had been saved.\n\nThere wasn\u2019t much time to get out. \u201cIt was going so fast,\u201d said her son George Long.\n\nIn Calimesa, the Sandalwood fire erupted when the driver of a commercial trash truck dumped a smoldering load to prevent the vehicle from catching fire.\n\nDry grass quickly ignited and winds gusting to 50 mph blew the fire into the Villa Calimesa Mobile Home Park about 75 miles east of downtown Los Angeles. The park has 110 home sites and was built in 1958, according to its website. Fire officials were investigating what caused the trash in the truck to catch fire in Calimesa.\n\nThe Pacific Gas and Electric Co. utility said more than 300,000 Northern California businesses and residences were still in the dark Friday, even though power had been restored to 426,000. The company had switched off electricity in vulnerable areas to prevent its equipment from sparking wildfires during dry, windy weather.\n\nGabrielle Paluch and the Associated Press contributed reporting.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/11/california-saddleridge-fire-spreading-evacuations-power-outages/3941274002/", "description": "The Saddleridge fire, which began in Sylmar, is moving quickly thanks to Santa Ana winds, burning homes and forcing evacuations in California near LA", "authors": ["Doug Stanglin", "Chris Woodyard", "Grace Hauck", "Published A.M.
