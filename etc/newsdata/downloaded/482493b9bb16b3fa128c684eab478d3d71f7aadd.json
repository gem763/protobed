Eddie Jones took England on tour to Italy in July and August to have a dry run for the big show in Japan and the red rose also played short turnaround fixtures to replicate what they would face in the real thing. Planning doesn\u2019t often get the headlines but it is crucial to deliver the foundations of the performances you want and with seven games for the final four in various destinations at various times of the day, you need to have done more than just your due diligence.\n\nNow we are beginning to get to the pointy end of group exits and the knockouts, comfort gained from confidence that the route planned is the right one is crucial. It\u2019s an area of high performance I love.\n\nYou rarely hear coaches after a great victory talking poetically about how they managed their weekly schedule but they, along with the ever expanding backroom staff, will have spent an inordinate amount of time on the detail. It\u2019s an expanding field within elite sport and while we often read how British Cycling and other Olympic sports have used this side of medal hunting, in rugby it\u2019s become a fast accelerating tool to maximise.\n\nBarrett brothers make history as merciless All Blacks crush Canada Read more\n\nYou need to get big and mini peaks right both for teams and players. The change in the Premiership \u2013 with play offs replacing first past the post \u2013 began to embed this deeper in the English game. Peaking all the time isn\u2019t possible but at the right time \u2013 that\u2019s the art with the science.\n\nSports medicine and science departments are all common in the top teams and even 10 years ago, that wasn\u2019t the case. Normally a keen physio with an eye on technology or a conditioner ahead of the curve covered it but now it is deep and detailed.\n\nBig-ticket understanding of flights, accommodation and recovery facilities as well as tournament venues will all have been recced and on the docket in detail. Underneath that the jet lag protocols will be in place and by now, normal circadian service should have been resumed.\n\nTravel within a country, especially in Japan, needs to be orchestrated perfectly. Leave training a few minutes later than you wanted in the floating world of Tokyo and you could easily double your travel time, causing a domino effect for the rest of your day. A game week needs to have the right balance of exertion and workload for everyone to match the goals for a particular game.\n\nWithin all that are the smaller parts of planning around the types of meals and nutrition to help aid sleep, energy and recovery, the balance between coach and player-led meetings and time together and time off as well as the local nuances that could significantly knock you off the road you have planned to travel.\n\nResearch and then application of humidity strategy will have been actioned. Sweat can be analysed as well as players regularly given osmolarity testing and weighing in and out to make sure they are hydrated. Saline drips would give all players the best chance of getting their essential minerals back and hydration up but that would be breaking Wada rules, so a slower method is needed to get the players back to their best.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest South Africa\u2019s flanker Siya Kolisi (bottom) during a training session at Omaezaki Nexta Field in Shizuoka.

Interestingly, and as an aside I genuinely wonder how much of that is the use of brand new match balls. Unused balls will have a waxy layer and most ground staff around the world know that, so normally those balls are thrown in the washing machine and then kicked and passed around a bit before they reach the match. In planning, you always assume nothing but I do wonder if this simple practice has slipped the net thus far.\n\nA phrase coined first by a 19th-century Prussian military commander \u2013 \u201cno plan survives first contact with the enemy\u201d \u2013 is true to the extent that a planning structure that can bend in the breeze has to be in place but not to the point that you level it all after an unexpected loss or a performance that dipped to depths you didn\u2019t see coming. Unless the major supporting beams of your planning are wrong or even not present then the mantra \u201cplan your work and work your plan\u201d still needs to be applied.\n\nOf course teams along their road to winning have had some pot holes to navigate around in those stratagems. The All Blacks\u2019 2011 fly-half decimation \u2013 where injury took their first three and led to their fourth choice being brought in and kicking the winning penalty in the final \u2013 was just one example. It provided threats to their goals but their overarching plans were in place and they stuck to their frameworks and protocols.\n\nIf Rassie Erasmus\u2019s Springboks, Michael Cheika\u2019s Australia or Joe Schmidt\u2019s Ireland lift the Webb Ellis Cup then they will do what no other team has done in Rugby World Cup history by winning without a 100% tournament record. In fact in all the other major team sports of football, cricket, hockey, baseball and basketball in both men and women\u2019s \u2013 men\u2019s rugby stands alone as the only World Cup where every champion has had a 100% winning record.\n\nOften teams throw the baby out with the bath water after a debilitating loss but for Australia, South Africa or Ireland, if they are to buck that unbeaten trend, then they need to sway but not snap the blueprints they have put in place.", "description": "For South Africa, Australia and Ireland it is a case of tweaking blueprints having already scrutinised every tournament detail", "authors": ["Ben Ryan"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e37963faafe693bd6fbf63ab7d985c12542f2dc9/0_167_5204_3122/master/5204.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=01863f21fad8a89135b8f886adc1fbfc"}
