Diligence team members from these parties are expected to visit the company's sites over the coming days and weeks.'\n\nPrevious reports have suggested that investment vehicle Ataer, which is controlled by Turkey's military pension fund, is concerned at the lack of progress to push through price cuts with suppliers.\n\nBut the Official Receiver insisted: 'Ataer remain very much interested in acquiring the business and we remain in detailed discussions with them to conclude a sale.'\n\nThe news is expected to cause concern among British Steel's 5,000 staff, including 4,000 at its plant in Scunthorpe, and a further 700 on Teesside in north-east England.\n\nThe company is also indirectly responsible for 20,000 workers in the supply chain and produces around 2.5 million tonnes of steel a year.\n\nThe Unite union called on Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom to guarantee the Government's continued support for British Steel and honour previous commitments on research and investment necessary to facilitate the smooth sale of the steelmaker.\n\nAssistant general secretary for manufacturing Steve Turner said: 'I have written to the Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom requesting an urgent meeting.\n\n'It is vital that the Government continues to stand behind British Steel until the sale process is finalised to maintain customer, supplier and workforce confidence in a company which can have bright future.\n\n'This includes honouring commitments on research and investment which assist the smooth sale process of British Steel and a recognition that the success of the steelmaker is central to any future UK industrial strategy.'\n\nAtaer, which invests funds for the Turkish Armed Forces Assistance Fund - or Oyak - already owns nearly 50% of Turkey's biggest steel producer, Erdemir.\n\nHowever, there has been criticism that the company is too close to the Turkish government and lacks accountability.\n\nBritish Steel was put into compulsory liquidation in May after talks between previous owner Greybull and the Government collapsed, leading the business to be run by the Official Receiver.\n\nPrevious reports had suggested that Oyak wants to buy British Steel as the first step to buying up steel assets across the world.", "description": "The Government's Official Receiver has spent almost two months talking with the Turkish military pension fund in an effort to save British Steel and the jobs of 5,000 people in Scunthorpe and Teesside.", "authors": ["Darren Boyle For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/17/20092712-0-image-a-4_1571849270289.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
