For AC Milan and Inter they reach about 34 million,\u201d said Scaroni.\n\n\u201cThis difference risks being the reason the clubs don\u2019t put in the showing they ought to in Europe,\u201d he added.\n\nAC Milan won the last of their European titles in 2007 \u2014 three years before Inter won their third and most recent crown.\n\nIf the stadium deal does not come off then \u201cthere is a plan B, still with Inter,\u201d said Scaroni without elaborating.\n\nHe did note that the search was under way to increase sponsorship but \u201cif we are losing games then it\u2019s more difficult.\u201d\n\nUnlike the club\u2019s late 1980s zenith when the likes of Dutch trio Marco Van Basten, Ruud Gulllit and Frank Rijkaard were in their pomp, this season the Milanese are mired in mid table.\n\n\u201cThere is a clear and audacious vision on the part of Elliott, which is to return Milan to the top table of Italian and world football without it taking 10 or 15 years,\u201d club chief executive Ivan Gazidis said.\n\nAside from a new stadium the club intends to \u201cinvest in young footballers to turn them into top drawer players,\u201d he added.\n\nAfter their poor start this season in Serie A Milan earlier this month sacked Marco Giampaolo as coach and brought in Stefano Pioli as their ninth coach of the decade.\n\nBut the move is yet to provide a bounce, with Piolo\u2019s side earning just one point to date in his two games in charge, losing 2-1 to Roma on Sunday to stand 12th, seven points off a Champions League place. Inter are looking to claim a berth as they lie second, a point behind leaders Juventus.", "description": "Milan (AFP) \u2013 Italian giants AC Milan, struggling to recapture the glory days of seven European Cups and of their heyday under media magnate Silvio", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/28/ac36c6_hit-by-record-losses-ac-milan-appointed-stefano-pioli-as-head-coach-earlier-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
