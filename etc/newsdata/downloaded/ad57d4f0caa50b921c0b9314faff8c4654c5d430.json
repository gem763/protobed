Also, if someone comes across as slightly one-dimensional like Jay, it\u2019s more of a sign they\u2019re a catfish. Although Jay\u2019s mum floored me.\u2019\n\nThe pair agree to \u2018put their heads together\u2019 to try to suss out their fellow contestants.\n\n\u2018I trust Ella\u2019s judgment,\u2019 Woody says to himself out loud.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m f*****g down,\u2019 Ella says to herself.\n\nSunday night\u2019s episode promises to be a big one, with the latest ratings coming out for each contestant.\n\nThe Circle also shared a preview clip of Jack and Beth meeting for the first time, as Jack realises Beth has been using someone else\u2019s photos.\n\nDAILY DROP!
