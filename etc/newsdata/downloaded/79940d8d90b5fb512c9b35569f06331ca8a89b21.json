Thousands of jihadists are being held in the country and there are fears of riots or attacks\n\n'U.S. intelligence reports claimed ISIS still had up to 18,000 fighters in Iraq and Syria at the time of Baghdadi's death.'\n\nThe operation against Baghdadi has already prompted fears of revenge attacks by followers of the terrorist leader.\n\nA military operation led by Kurdish fighters in the Syrian Democratic Forces reduced Baghdadi's so-called 'caliphate' to nothing earlier this year.\n\nHowever, Baghdadi was widely seen as a figurehead rather than a day-to-day leader and his followers are still capable of mounting attacks.\n\nSmall units of fighters have since gone underground and continued to carry out guerrilla-style attacks in the region.\n\nSecurity has been tightened at ISIS prisons in northern Syria where Kurdish guards were said to be on 'high alert'.\n\nBaghdadi had urged his followers to break ISIS fanatics out of prison in the last weeks of his life.\n\nThere are also fears that 'sleeper cells' around the world will carry out reprisals, and Britain and France have both stepped up security.\n\nDetained: ISIS prisoners sit on the floor at a camp in northern Syria on Saturday - some of the tens of thousands of detainees being held by Kurdish fighters\n\nMore than 10,000 ISIS prisoners are being held in Syria while another camp is home to some 70,000 people, mainly relatives of the extremists.\n\nSecurity fears were already heightened after Turkey's invasion of northern Syria caused chaos in the region.\n\nKurdish guards were summoned away from the camps to fend off the Turkish attack and a U.S. official said as many as 100 ISIS prisoners had already escaped.\n\nHowever, Trump quickly insisted that some of the escaped prisoners had already been recaptured.\n\nA former U.S. diplomat appointed by Barack Obama warned that Trump's vivid description of Baghdadi's death could lead to reprisals.\n\nDana Shell Smith, the former U.S. ambassador to Qatar, said the President's tale of dogs chasing the ISIS leader to his death was 'gruesome, vivid and probably exaggerated'.\n\nAccusing Trump of 'delighting in death like the terrorists do,' she warned that his 'horrifying' tone would damage America's relationships in the region.", "description": "The Counter Extremism Project said the jihadists had been posting 'regular propaganda' after ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (pictured) died in a U.S. special forces raid in Syria.", "authors": ["Tim Stickings For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/14/20380158-0-image-a-28_1572446880552.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
