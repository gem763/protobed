This is an unusually high number for our county in this period of time,\" the office said in a statement Sunday. \"At this time we know fentanyl can be mixed in to cocaine and methamphetamine. These can be deadly combinations for those who are using.\"\n\nJoshua Lott/Reuters\n\nLast month, the office issued an alert saying six county residents had died from overdoses in less than 24 hours. That news came just weeks after the office announced that nine people had suffered fatal overdoses in a two-day period in July.\n\nOhio has been one of the hardest-hit states by the nation's growing opioid and fentanyl epidemics.\n\nThe state saw an increase of more than a 500 fentanyl encounters -- police samples testing positive for the drug -- from 2014 to 2015, the latest data available from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Only three other states -- Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and New Hampshire -- saw similar increases.\n\nIn its statement on Sunday, the Franklin County Coroner's Office said residents with family or friends that might be at risk for overdoses should have Naloxone, the emergency overdose reversal drug, on hand as a precaution.\n\nIn addition, the office urged at-risk residents to purchase fentanyl testing strips to look for fentanyl in substances before using them.\n\n\"I urge friends and family of those who use to make sure you are armed with Naloxone,\" the statement said. \"Those who use should also test before using with fentanyl testing strips.\"", "description": "Ohio has been one of the hardest-hit areas in the growing fentanyl, opioid epidemic.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/fentanyl_file_photo_190929_hpMain_20190929-220850_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
