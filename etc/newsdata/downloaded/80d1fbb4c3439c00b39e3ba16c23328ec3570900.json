Details remain scant, and the plan would still need to be approved by President Donald Trump. The Dow had been up well over 100 points when the news broke.\n\n\u201cThis story pretty came out of nowhere and the timing is terrible,\u201d writes Oanda\u2019s Edward Moya. \u201cUS equities sold off strongly and safe-havens soared as much of Europe has already started their weekends.\u201d\n\nThe report must come for a shock to investors hoping that the U.S. and China were close to reaching a trade truce. It has also caused Chinese stocks to fall, as the iShares China Large-Cap ETF (FXI) has slipped 1.1% to $39.47. Alibaba (BABA) has dropped 4.5% to $167.05.\n\nMore to come.\n\nMarkets Now is a quick take on what\u2019s happening with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and other major market indexes.
