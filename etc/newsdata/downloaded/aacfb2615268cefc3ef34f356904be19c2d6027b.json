the company former vice president Joe Biden's son Hunter joined back in 2014\n\nOne text exchange that has attracted particular attention involves one diplomat, William \"Bill\" Taylor, telling Sondland that he thought it was \"crazy\" to withhold military aid from Ukraine \"for help with a political campaign.\"\n\nSondland said in response that Trump had been clear about his intentions and that there was no quid pro quo.\n\nNow, Sondland is prepared to tell lawmakers that Trump told him by phone before he sent the text that there was no quid pro quo and that he was simply parroting those reassurances to Taylor, according to a person familiar with his account.\n\nHe is expected to say that though he did understand there to be a quid pro quo involving a White House visit, he did not associate Burisma with the Biden family and believed that an anti-corruption public statement was a goal widely shared across the administration.\n\nSondland will be testifying three days after Fiona Hill, a former White House aide, said that his actions so unnerved Bolton that Bolton said he was not part of \"whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up\" - a reference to White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney.\n\nBut Sondland is prepared to say that neither Hill nor Bolton personally raised concerns about the Ukraine work directly with him, according to the person familiar with his account.\n\nHouse lawmakers have been hearing over the last two weeks from other diplomats and administration officials, including from the State Department.\n\nThe most recent was Michael McKinley, a career service officer and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's de facto chief of staff, who testified that the Trump administration's politicization of foreign policy contributed to his resignation.", "description": "Gordon Sondland is scheduled to be interviewed\u00a0on Thursday behind closed doors by House lawmakers as part of an impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Associated Press", "Emily Crane For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/06/19819810-0-FILE_In_this_July_10_2018_file_photo_President_Donald_Trump_is_j-a-7_1571291304077.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
