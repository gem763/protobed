When you think of hybrids, you think environmentally friendly, right? But Lamborghini is taking a different approach, using hybrid technology to boost performance without taking fuel efficiency into consideration. Which raises the question: Should automakers use hybrid systems to increase speed rather than reduce pollution?\n\nHybrids have grown in popularity since they were first introduced 20 years ago. Now, almost every automaker offers a hybrid option, and most hybrids can double the gas mileage of a standard car. But Lamborghini\u2019s foray into electrification, the Si\u00e1n FKP 37, doesn\u2019t save fuel. The Si\u00e1n is a blend of the Terzo Millennio concept and the iconic Countach. Instead of fuel efficiency, Lamborghini is focusing on performance. And perform it does. It\u2019s the fastest Lamborghini ever, with a top speed of over 217 mph, and goes 0 to 62 in just under 2.8 seconds, just two-tenths of a second shy of Tesla\u2019s Model S. There\u2019s no doubt that Lamborghini saw what electric motors could do and wanted to try something different for itself. The Si\u00e1n\u2019s engineering is ingenious. Instead of a battery pack, Lamborghini opted for a supercapacitor, which is lighter, fire-resistant, more powerful, and fully charges in a fraction of the time of a battery pack. The only downfall is the lack of range, which limits the Si\u00e1n\u2019s fully electric drive mode to parking and reversing. But the supercapacitor is the secret to making it the fastest-accelerating Lamborghini ever, virtually eliminating lag between gear changes, providing instant torque via the electric motors, and fully recharging during the regenerative braking process to repeat its performance around the track. But Lamborghini\u2019s chief technology officer says the supercapacitor is not too hot for emissions.\n\nMeanwhile, Lamborghini\u2019s sister company, Porsche, produced the 918 Spyder, a super-hybrid that boasts a top speed of 211 mph and makes the 0-to-62 run quicker than the Si\u00e1n, at 2.6 seconds. But even more impressively, it achieves a miles-per-gallon rating of 22, and a 67 mpg of gasoline equivalent while running on the hybrid drivetrain. And it came out in 2013. The Porsche accelerates faster, has a comparable top speed, and still manages to be more fuel-efficient than the Lamborghini Si\u00e1n. The point is, you don\u2019t have to sacrifice efficiency for performance. So, are hybrids and electric cars the answer to our climate-change problems? Probably not. But they could have a big role to play. The EPA says that up to 75% of carbon monoxide emissions in US cities come from motor vehicles. So, yes, automakers do have a big role to play.\n\nThere could be some positive steps in the company\u2019s future. Lamborghini states that they plan to use battery packs instead of supercapacitors in their next hybrid, which should produce better gas mileage. But the problem is, for right now, Lamborghini\u2019s one and only hybrid doesn\u2019t do much for fuel efficiency.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
