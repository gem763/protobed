Kohler Barnard is paying for her defence out of her own money.\n\nNel told Thulare on Friday that he had two witnesses willing to give evidence - Grant Caswell and Kabelo Mohlohlo - who were among those at the workshop.\n\nHe felt that others might be too afraid to give evidence, fearing repercussions.\n\nThulare ordered that beside Steenhuisen, Caswell, Mohlohlo and fellow MP Zakhele Mbhele, who also attended the workshop, would also be subpoenaed so that he can get to the bottom of the matter.\n\nREAD: 'Xenophobic, racist and sexist': Case against DA MP Kohler Barnard goes to Equality Court\n\nMbhele has already submitted an affidavit on the matter, the court heard.\n\nNel's founding affidavit alleges that Kohler Barnard's comments are discriminatory and bigoted.\n\nHe paraphrased her as saying:-\n\n\"Farm murders have decreased since the removal of then president Robert Mugabe, as Zimbabweans have returned home\";\n\n- \"Women have themselves to blame and are 'stupid for being scammed as they enter into relationships with Nigerian men who sleep with them and solicit money under false pretences; and\";\n\n- \"Black children are killing 'whiteys' with stones thrown at vehicles from bridges, 'never mind the fact that coloured or Indian people are also being killed'; also, the respondent (Kohler Barnard) questioned why these 'kids' were not in school.\"\n\nIn his affidavit he submitted: \"It is my contention that the utterances listed above amount to unfair discrimination on the grounds of ethnicity, gender and race, and betrayed a bigoted attitude towards Zimbabweans, women and people of colour.\"\n\nHe also felt that her statements were not based on fact.\n\nKohler Barnard's advocate Michael Tsele told the court that: \"On any conceivable interpretation of those words, they do not amount to an offence.\"\n\nNo evidence was led on Friday, but instead, Thulare will examine the context to the words at an inquiry between June 10 and 14, and decide if they were discriminatory.\n\nIn papers filed at the court, Kohler Barnard went through each accusation point by point to provide context.\n\nShe submitted that her utterances did not make her guilty of discrimination in terms of the Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act (Pepuda) and the Constitution.\n\nShe said that comments she made at the workshop were based on her doing her job and keeping abreast with crime trends through constant interaction with residents from different suburbs, crime statistics and reading widely. They were not her personal opinion.\n\nNel had failed to show that people were discriminated against, or that she had incited hatred or advocated war, she submitted in the papers.\n\nShe added that it was not against the law to call somebody \"stupid\" or \"naive\".", "description": "DA Chief Whip John Steenhuisen will be subpoenaed to make a statement for an Equality Court inquiry regarding a complaint alleging racism, xenophobia and sexism against fellow MP Dianne Kohler Barnard.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8681/08ed28e43d974e95a165cde7e5ab4900.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-03"}
