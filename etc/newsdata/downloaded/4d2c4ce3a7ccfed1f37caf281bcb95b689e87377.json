The new rules add a 1.4 percent tax on college investment income for any school with at least 500 tuition-paying students and at least $500,000 in assets per student.\n\nFor Harvard, the university with the largest endowment in the U.S., that will add up to about $49.8 million in new taxes this year, school officials said in their annual financial report.\n\n\u201cViewed in the context of maintaining affordability, less money is now available for [Harvard] to maintain financial aid,\u201d the report states.\n\nHarvard\u2019s endowment saw a 6.5 percent return last year and was valued at $40.9 billion at the end of its last fiscal year in June, according to the report. The endowment provided $1.9 billion to the university this year, 35 percent of its total revenue, according to the report.\n\nLawrence S. Bacow, president of Harvard, wrote in the report that the university's financial resources are strong but the school\u2019s leaders must be ready for challenges and a changing economic climate.\n\n\u201cUncertainty in federal research funding and the damaging tax on college and university endowments in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act also have the potential to hinder Harvard\u2019s ability to grow investments in financial aid, teaching and research across campus,\u201d Bacow wrote.\n\nPublic schools, small schools and schools with thinner wallets won\u2019t have to pay the new endowment tax. But Harvard won\u2019t be the only university hit by the new tax. IRS officials have estimated 40 institutions will be affected.\n\nA Princeton spokesperson said the university is still working to understand the effect of this tax on endowments. Other private universities backed by large endowments contacted by FOX Business didn\u2019t immediately share their estimates for how the new rules will hit their tax bill.\n\nSo which other schools are likely to get pinched by the new endowment tax? The National Center for Educational Statistics maintains a list of U.S. degree-granting post-secondary institutions with the largest endowments.\n\nAs of 2017 \u2014 the most recent year with data available \u2014 these were the 10 private universities with the largest endowments, according to the NCES:\n\n10. Duke University: $7.9 billion\n\n9. Northwestern University: $8 billion\n\n8. University of Notre Dame: $9.7 billion\n\n7. Columbia University\n\n6. University of Pennsylvania: $12.2 billion\n\n5. Massachusetts Institute of Technology: $14.8 billion\n\n4. Princeton University: $23.4 billion\n\n3. Stanford University: $24.8 billion\n\n2. Yale University: $27.2 billion\n\n1. Harvard University: $37.1 billion\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "Some private colleges will have to pay new taxes on their investment income.", "authors": ["James Leggate"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/02/0/0/85de9b86-harvard.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
