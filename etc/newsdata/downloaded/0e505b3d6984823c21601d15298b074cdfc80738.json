If I [blanked you], I didn't realise. There's no way I'm not waving to Beau Ryan!'\n\nAngie went on to explain her state of mind on the day in question\n\n'I was having such a sad sack day because I had to fly to three different states. I remember seeing you... I reckon I waved and you reckon I didn't,' she explained.\n\nBeau, who hosts Channel 10's upcoming show, The Amazing Race Australia, then graciously accepted Angie's apology.\n\nSetting the record straight: The Bachelorette's Angie Kent (pictured) has apologised for snubbing Beau Ryan at a Channel 10 event earlier this month, saying she only ignored him because of her 'mad' travel schedule\n\nThe saga began after Angie apparently 'snubbed' Beau at Channel 10's Upfronts.\n\n'I walk out [of the makeup room] and Angie Kent walks past,' the retired Cronulla Sharks player explained on The Kyle and Jackie O Show last week.\n\n'I've got to be honest, I've never really watched Bachelor or Bachelorette, I watched the Honey Badger for a bit, but I locked into The Bachelorette [this year]. I like her... I've met her at least twice... I'm a fan of her,' he added.\n\nToo famous to say hello? Angie apparently 'snubbed' fellow Channel 10 star Beau (right) at the network's Upfronts presentation in Sydney on October 10\n\n'She walked past with her entourage, as you do when you're on The Bachelor and Bachelorette, you get an entourage out of nowhere, you know what I mean?\n\n'I've come out and I've literally said, \"Hey, Ange!\", and raised up my hand above my face for a wave. As she's walking past, she locks eyes with me for at least two seconds, maybe three seconds, and then straightens her head and walks away.'\n\nRadio host Jackie 'O' Henderson then asked: 'No hello? No acknowledgement?'\n\nSnubbed! The 34-year-old former NRL player, who hosts the upcoming series of The Amazing Race, claimed Angie (pictured) had completely blanked him at the Channel 10 Upfronts\n\nBeau replied: 'She looks at me, saw me, definitely saw me. I turned around to the makeup girl and she said, \"What happened then?\" I was like, \"Did you see that?\" She did. I had no idea what happened. She brushed me!'\n\nAfter recalling the embarrassing incident, Jackie and her co-host Kyle Sandilands began debating who was more famous: Beau or Angie.\n\nKIIS FM's newsreader Brooklyn Ross then came to Beau's defence, saying: 'Beau is like fifty times more famous than Angie!'", "description": "The Bachelorette's Angie Kent has settled her feud with  Beau Ryan, after she snubbed the former NRL player at a Channel 10 event earlier this month.", "authors": ["Shannon Shipley", "Jo Scrimshire For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/01/20062458-0-image-a-4_1571789839627.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
