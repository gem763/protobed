Springer thought it was a home run and watched it go, but it only turned out to be a two-bagger. The outfielder would be left on base and fail to score.\n\nHOUSTON ASTROS' AJ HINCH 'VERY DISAPPOINTED' OVER REPORT OF EXEC'S ALLEGED ROBERTO OSUNA COMMENTS\n\nAlthough Springer was 2-for-3 with a home run and two RBI in the 5-4 loss, he was still facing questions over whether he should have run the ball out in the eighth inning against Hudson in an effort to possibly turn the double into a triple.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to necessarily run as fast as I can because, for some reason, if [Kyle Tucker] tags or whatever the case and I run by him, it\u2019s not good. I was watching the outfielder,\u201d Springer said, according to the Houston Chronicle. \u201cIf I had gone to third, I\u2019m out. I'm out for sure.\u201d\n\nNATIONALS TOP COLE, ASTROS 5-4 IN WORLD SERIES OPENER\n\nAstros manager A.J. Hinch was also asked about the play, according to USA Today.\n\n\u201cI'll have to take a look at it,\u201d Hinch said. \u201cI didn't see that. There was a lot going on in that play.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nThe Nationals own a 1-0 lead in the series.", "description": "Houston Astros star George Springer was feeling the heat Tuesday night after receiving criticism for not hustling during the first game of the World Series against the Washington Nationals.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is A Sports Reporter For Foxnews.Com", "Foxbusiness.Com.
