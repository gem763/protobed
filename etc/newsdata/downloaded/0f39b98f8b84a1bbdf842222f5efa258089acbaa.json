The number of class actions underway compares to just 18 class actions filed in 2012-2013. Many companies now have specialist class action units.\n\nAustralia is still well behind the home of class actions in the US. But the direction is clear. Australia\u2019s continuous disclosure obligations are proving fertile territory for the growing number of proceedings based on losses due to share price drops \u2013 on the grounds the reasons should have been made public earlier.\n\nMany boards are also concerned about the burgeoning area of environmental, social and governance issues \u2013 such as adequate preparation for climate change. M &A that doesn\u2019t go well will become an obvious target. And a more litigious approach by the regulators means class actions will inevitably accompany any of their wins in court.\n\nWestpac is appealing the use of common order funds in class action lawsuits. SMH\n\nA class action against Westpac over responsible lending laws is now likely to be put on hold until after the results of an ASIC appeal over its recent Federal Court loss, for example. If the appeal succeeds, other banks can expect to be targeted.\n\nYet a key reason for the growth in class actions is because so few make it to trial \u2013 less than 10 per cent. Most cases are settled instead and then approved by a judge.\n\nEven if businesses believe they have a strong defence, they also believe it\u2019s not worth the risk of going to court. They not only face legal fees, share price declines due to uncertainty and the protracted distraction of directors and employees, the prospect of losing and facing a huge and uncertain payout is worse.\n\nEven a modest amount of financial compensation for each member of a class can add up if the numbers of individuals are large. Quantifying that loss via a \u201ccompromise\u201d deal is seen as safer, especially for insurers who can in turn lift their premiums for corporate customers, with insurance costs now soaring.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn average the litigation funders take about 30 per cent of the payout, the plaintiff lawyers recoup all their costs plus a handy margin while the \u201cclass\u201d members receive \u201ccompensation\u201d. In many cases, the money available to claimants comes to only a little over half of that awarded in the settlement.\n\nBut most would have not considered seeking any money without a class action on their behalf \u2013 often without their knowledge, let alone agreement. Class actions here operate on an opt-out basis, greatly multiplying the overall cost to companies as well as returns to funders.\n\nUnder \u201ccommon fund orders\u201d, the amount shared by all individuals is reduced by the litigation costs whether or not they signed up to proceedings. The use of these common fund orders is now being appealed in the High Court.\n\nBut class action funding has become a high return asset class for sophisticated investors, with Australia seen as a particularly lucrative market. According to Herbert Smith Freehills, Australia is the \u201csecond most attractive class action jurisdiction globally\u201d.\n\nA review of trends by King & Wood Mallesons found 22 class action settlements were approved by the court last year for an estimated total of over $500M, with 10 more settlements pending approval.\n\n\u201cIs this higher level of class action activity the \u2018new normal\u2019?\" the review asks, citing the \u201cgreater certainty and returns for litigation funders\u201d due to common fund orders as well as a general increase in the supply of litigation funding.\n\nBusiness leaders are blunter. \u201cAustralia has become the \u2018Treasure Island\u2019 of class actions,\u201d says one.\n\nThe increase in litigation funders doing business in Australia \u2013 now about 25 - is adding to competition on fees while the courts are taking much greater interest in what is charged and in consolidating similar class actions into one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the tendency to settle undermines one of the purposes of class actions, namely deterrence, because there is no finding of wrongdoing. It also removes the potential liability of the litigation funder to pay the legal costs of the targeted company should it lose.\n\nProfessor Michael Legg from UNSW, an expert on class actions, acknowledges their benefits but maintains the biggest problem is the size of legal fees and litigation funders fees.\n\n\u201cWhat sort of access to justice is it if 40 or 50 per cent goes in transaction costs?\u201d he says.\n\nStuart Clark, former president of the Law Council of Australia, says class actions are a valuable tool when used appropriately.\n\n\u201cBut the link with litigation funding means it has been corrupted or prostituted into a business model which was never intended and with rates of return that are unconscionable,\u201d he says.", "description": "Litigation funders, many of them international,  are able to earn huge fees for reasonably low risk through class action lawsuits.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2607%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/255f2a47ce13ffb0e22c92ea8595051f4468ccd9", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
