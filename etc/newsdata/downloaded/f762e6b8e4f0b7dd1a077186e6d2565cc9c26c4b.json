She is legally blind and notes that getting around in busy cities such as Tokyo can be a challenge.\n\nThese new map features help to combat these struggles.\n\n\"With this feature, I can navigate the streets of Tokyo with more comfort and confidence. As I take my journey, Google Maps proactively lets me know that I\u2019m on the correct route, the distance until my next turn and the direction I\u2019m walking in. As I approach large intersections, I get a heads-up to cross with added caution. And if I accidentally leave my route, I\u2019ll get a spoken notification that I'm being re-routed. Frequent updates like these not only help a visually impaired person get from A to B, they can also give us more confidence and reassurance when we travel alone. With detailed voice guidance in Google Maps, my journey fades into the background and I can focus more on what I\u2019ll do at my final destination. This may not sound extraordinary to those with sight, but for people who are blind or have low vision, this can help us explore new and unfamiliar places.\"\n\nYou can learn more about the features in this video:\n\nFor those of you in the U.S. and Japan, Detailed Voice Guidance rolls out from today on Android and iOS.\n\nYou can toggle the feature on by going to the settings in Google Maps, selecting 'Navigation' and selecting 'Detailed Voice Guidance.'\n\n[Google Blog]", "description": "This week Google announced that Maps will now be offering improved walking directions for the vision impaired.
