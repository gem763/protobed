A cinch. Easy-peasy. One of those nonchalant, stroll-in-the-park victories we\u2019ve come to expect from the England rugby team.\n\nFour more days. That is how long this House will now sit, barring any mischief in the Lords today.\n\nThen we shall be done with the most sclerotic, catarrh-ridden Parliament in living memory.\n\nThe match has been struck, the blue touch paper finally lit. Hallelujah!\n\nAs for the debate, Boris Johnson was chipper, twisting and jabbing those podgy Cumberland sausage fingers across the despatch box, writes HENRY DEEDES\n\nThe afternoon\u2019s debate ended up being wasted hot air. Any dramatic tension was pretty much lost by mid-morning when Jeremy Corbyn suddenly decided Labour would back the Bill.\n\nWith the Lib Dems and Scottish Nationalists prepared to support the Government, he bowed to the inevitable in front of TV cameras, surrounded by some of his shadow cabinet. What a lot of grey-haired men in one place. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the party\u2019s business spokesman, must have been the only one too young for free bus travel.\n\nThe Bill encountered the usual Parliamentary chicanery early on. Speaker Bercow allowed an amendment from Stella Creasy (Lab, Walthamstow) which allowed various goal-post shifting, such as an attempt to give EU nationals a vote. How they love their petty games, these Remainers. Eventually, only a debate on changing the election day was permitted.\n\nBercow is meant to retire tomorrow. Hang out the bunting! But not too fast. Imagine his delight when Maria Miller (Con, Basingstoke) urged him to stay on until Parliament is dissolved next week.\n\nJeremy Corbyn was ratty. Unsurprising, considering the dramatic flip-flop he\u2019d been forced to perform, writes HENRY DEEDES\n\n\u2018I will do my duty and, if the House asks me to do as people have requested, of course I take that extremely seriously,\u2019 the Speaker informed the Chamber, glazing himself in honey.\n\nAs for the debate, Boris Johnson was chipper, twisting and jabbing those podgy Cumberland sausage fingers across the despatch box, buoyed perhaps that an election was finally in sight. He continued to goad Corbyn for having tried to avoid the electorate for so long.\n\n\u2018Dogs bark. Cows moo. Oppositions are meant to vote for an election,\u2019 he cried.\n\nAndy McDonald (Lab, Middlesbrough) suggested the PM had forgotten to rewrite his speech now that Labour had agreed to an election. Boris was undeterred.\n\n\u2018Maybe it\u2019s because he\u2019s been following the precepts of his intellectual mentor Fidel Castro whose adoring crowds used to serenade him, Mr Speaker, with the cry of Revoluciones, Si! Elecciones, No!\u2019\n\nCorbyn was ratty. Unsurprising, considering the dramatic flip-flop he\u2019d been forced to perform.\n\nSpeaker Bercow (pictured) allowed an amendment from Stella Creasy (Lab, Walthamstow) which allowed various goal-post shifting\n\nHis mood wasn\u2019t improved by repeated attempts from Sir Hugo Swire (Con, East Devon) to intervene during his speech, snarling: \u2018I\u2019ve told him four times, I\u2019m not going to give way.\u2019\n\nWhen the Labour leader pledged to get Brexit \u2018sorted\u2019, Boris\u2019s eyeballs spun faster than Catherine wheels. \u2018Sorted?!\u2019 the PM screamed, incredulously slouched in his seat. \u2018Sorrrrtedddd?!\u2019\n\nSuch hypocrisy from a man who\u2019s spent the past three years frustrating Brexit at every turn. Johnson ended on a rallying cry. \u2018Whatever date the House decides for the election, I am ready for it. We are ready for it!\u2019 Reaction from the Labour benches as he sat down? Tepid.\n\nAndy McDonald (Lab, Middlesbrough) suggested the PM had forgotten to rewrite his speech now that Labour had agreed to an election\n\nThe other Opposition parties pursued their own narrow agendas. The SNP\u2019s Ian Blackford\u2019s rant about independence received applause from his own MPs, though they may secretly have been welcoming its relative brevity, for once, more than its content.\n\nBy contrast, Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson launched into an anti-Brexit tirade which went on so long that the moustaches on the Democratic Unionist benches next to her were starting to perm.\n\nStrangely aggressive figure is Swinson. Glad I never encountered her on a hockey pitch.\n\nBehind the Speaker\u2019s chair, Remainer Dominic Grieve (Ind, Beaconsfield) tugged his chin and looked glum. Philip Hammond and Chris Leslie (Change UK, Nottingham East) held an impromptu confab. Decisions, decisions.\n\nWhat fate now awaits these ardent Brexit spoilers? We shall see in six weeks\u2019 time.\n\nSix very, very long weeks.", "description": "HENRY DEEDES: And so, despite all Labour's pathetic huffing and puffing and the hoo-ha of their blocking tactics the previous day, the Government's early election bill sailed through.", "authors": ["Henry Deedes For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/22/20350520-0-image-a-62_1572387866424.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
