Twitter Users React To Snake-Filled Moat Report", "language": "en", "text": "President Donald Trump\u2019s latest scandal has Twitter users wondering if he\u2019s been channeling a certain \u201cAustin Powers\u201d supervillain.\n\nThe president privately discussed a number of extreme measures to prevent migrants from crossing the border, including shooting people in the legs to slow them down, and building an electrified wall with spikes on top and fortified with a moat stocked with snakes or alligators, according to a report Tuesday in The New York Times. Aides reportedly sought cost estimates for these schemes.\n\nThe report was based on interviews with more than a dozen White House and administration officials directly involved with the president this past March, during a week in which he\u2019d ordered advisers to completely close down the entire U.S. border with Mexico \u2015 and tweeted that he was planning to do so \u201cnext week.\u201d\n\nWithin hours of the report\u2019s publication, \u201cDr. Evil\u201d was trending on Twitter, as many users pointed out a resemblance between Trump\u2019s request and the villain\u2019s iconic demand for \u201csharks with frickin\u2019 laser beams attached to their heads\u201d in the 1997 \u201cAustin Powers: International Man of Mystery\u201d film:\n\nCheck out Twitter\u2019s thoughts on Trump\u2019s moat below:\n\nWe've grown so accustomed to this madness that entering the Dr. Evil \u201csharks with friggin' laser beams\u201d stage of this presidency doesn\u2019t even seem like a big deal. https://t.co/LDQh5dfCtV \u2014 Adam Best (@adamcbest) October 1, 2019\n\nWatch Don Lemon's Exasperated Reaction to Trump's Reported Snakes-in-a-Border-Moat Idea: 'Did Dr. Evil Come Up With That?' https://t.co/JkuazRBCKO \u2014 Mediaite (@Mediaite) October 2, 2019\n\nlike wtf is the 25th amendment for if not to remove a potus when they propose a moat full of wild animals to secure the border \u2014 Andrew Lawrence (@ndrew_lawrence) October 2, 2019\n\n*Snake Filled Moat\" is my Metallica cover band. \u2014 Rick Wilson (@TheRickWilson) October 1, 2019\n\nHalf of the country supports Dr. Evil and I still can\u2019t wrap my head around that. https://t.co/k0unfo5C7i \u2014 swarthy genderfluid child (@dorkoramadesign) October 2, 2019\n\nThis is indistinguishable from Dr. Evil\u2019s demand for sharks with laser beams on their foreheads. https://t.co/CfjfKPPVUy \u2014 Josh Barro (@jbarro) October 1, 2019\n\n\u201cGet back in the moat!!\u201d pic.twitter.com/poauSu0rEH \u2014 Acyn Torabi (@Acyn) October 1, 2019\n\nSources have sent us actual blueprints that were drawn up. As you can see, it will be a toss up on which occurs first, the leg shot or the alligator bite? If the guards aim is good enough it is possible the leg shot may happen while the intruder falls into the moat. #DHS pic.twitter.com/cAeHYyL9CL \u2014 Southside Paducah News Team (@RonBeeton) October 2, 2019\n\nThey are going to have to surround Trump\u2019s grave with a moat filled with alligators and snakes to stop people from pissing on it \u2014 Roland Scahill (@rolandscahill) October 2, 2019\n\nThey actually priced out a moat filled with snakes.\n\n\n\nNo, seriously.\n\n\n\nTHEY ACTUALLY PULLED TOGETHER ESTIMATES ON A MEDIEVAL SNAKE MOAT. https://t.co/aD8EInoabJ \u2014 The Hoarse Whisperer (@HoarseWisperer) October 2, 2019", "description": "Reports that Trump suggested a snake or alligator-filled border moat reminded people of the iconic villain's request for \"sharks with frickin' laser beams.\"", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d93f3712100002e00f93e14.jpeg?cache=3zbtkfu0qv&ops=1778_1000"}
