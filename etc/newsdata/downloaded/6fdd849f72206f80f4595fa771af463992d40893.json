Schiff is stirring his pot o\u2019 impeachment soup.\n\nWashington Post fake conservative Jennifer Rubin\u2019s Oct. 23rd column was titled, \u201cSo much for \u2018due process\u2019: Republican mob crashes secure hearing room.\u201d\n\nYes, they did, last Wednesday, showing that some of the Trump backbone has been transplanted.\n\nMr. Schiff, a California Democrat who chairs the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, had been conducting star chamber hearings on Ukraine in a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF).\n\nHe seems to think he\u2019s starring in an episode of \u201c24.\u201d Remember, though, that along with hero Jack Bauer, the Fox series featured lots of weasels.\n\nAlthough some Republicans have been able to cross-examine witnesses, Mr. Schiff has been leaking only nuggets damaging to the president. It\u2019s part of a pattern.\n\nOn Sept. 26 he summarized a transcript of President Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky this way: \u201cIt reads like a classic organized crime shakedown. \u2026 I\u2019m going to say this only seven times so you better listen good. I want you to make up dirt on my political opponent, understand. Lots of it.\u201d\n\nThe transcript shows none of this. Schiff made it up. Even the liberal FactCheck.org said his account was \u201cnot accurate.\u201d Later in the same hearing, Schiff joked that it was just a parody.\n\nThe GOP legislators\u2019 \u201cinvasion\u201d of the SCIF is reminiscent of the forceful Republican response in the 2000 presidential election in Florida.\n\nHad people sat on their hands, Al Gore would have become our 43rd president instead of George W. Bush. In short order, we probably would have been riding unicycles or skateboards over to the nearest vegan McDonald\u2019s while Al kept an eye on us from Air Force One.\n\nMr. Gore had first conceded on Election Night, but then rescinded it, claiming a Florida recount was needed. Over the next month, as the nation watched spellbound, lawyers for both sides maneuvered.\n\nBy November 10th election officials calculated that Mr. Bush had about a 400-vote lead out of almost 6 million cast. When it\u2019s that close, Florida requires a full machine recount in all 67 counties.\n\nThe Florida Supreme Court ordered a manual recount in four Democrat-heavy counties: Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach and Volusia and the drama escalated. Attorneys for Bush tried to stop the recount, arguing that it violated equal protection, since the other 63 Florida counties, including Republican-heavy ones, would not get the same scrutiny.\n\nOn December 12 \u2013 more than a month after the election \u2013 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled, 5-4, that the manual recount in the four counties violated the principle that \u201call votes must be treated equally.\u201d George W. Bush was declared the winner \u2013 by 537 votes.\n\nPhilip Hughes, who served in the Reagan administration in several posts, was called to Florida to help prevent ballot tampering.\n\n\u201cMy first task was to organize shifts of local volunteers to watch the warehouse [in Fort Lauderdale] overnight \u2013 to note any unusual or suspicious activity,\u201d he was quoted in a lengthy article for the Association for Diplomatic Studies & Training.\n\nUnions had bused in volunteers by the dozens, leaving some sorting tables without a Republican counterpart, he said. After frantic calls, more Republican watchers were found.\n\nMr. Hughes said that he sat one day in the Broward County counting room next to a woman who represented the Democrats. On a later day, she came in posing as a Republican, and fled after he spotted her. \u201cLater that afternoon, the [GOP] team fingered another such culprit \u2013 this time a guy \u2013 pulling the same stunt,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the most populous county, Miami-Dade, Democrats refused to let Republican observers in at all.\n\nThat\u2019s when the \u201cBrooks Brothers Riot\u201d took place. Over Thanksgiving weekend, a group of young, well-dressed GOP recount volunteers stormed the Miami-Dade center, pounding on the locked doors and yelling \u2018Let us in! Let us in!\u2019\n\nOfficials had squirreled away the disputed ballots into back rooms with no observers present. If they had \u201cfound\u201d enough Gore votes, it might have turned the tide the way the \u201cfound\u201d votes in multiple recounts in 2008 gave Al Franken a Minnesota U.S. Senate seat by 312 votes. But cameras were rolling in Miami, the doors opened, and the count resumed with both parties\u2019 volunteers.\n\nMany Democrats still claim the election was \u201cstolen,\u201d but a study by the Miami Herald and USA Today reported that Mr. Bush would have widened his victory to a 1,665-vote margin if the recount ordered by the Florida Supreme Court had continued.\n\nLikewise, a media consortium that included The New York Times, Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, CNN and AP also concluded that Mr. Bush won.\n\nSo, good for the GOP observers who hung in there in 2000, and good for the congressmen this past week who exposed Mr. Schiff\u2019s shifty \u201cdue process.\u201d\n\nPerhaps we might even see actual transcripts someday. Given the gravity of the situation, that doesn\u2019t seem too much to ask.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s worth being called a \u201cmob.\u201d\n\nRobert Knight is a Townhall contributor.", "description": "This past week the Democrat media went ballistic over Republican .10/29/2019 2:08:19AM EST.", "authors": ["Robert Knight", "Beth Baumann", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/269/3bbe62de-7a45-453d-844e-7d8a20ffc26b.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
