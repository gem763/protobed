"Amazon in prime spot at Queen's after parking their tanks on BBC's lawn", "language": "en", "text": "Amazon have parked their tanks on the BBC's lawn at the Fever-Tree Championships by paying close to \u00a3100,000 to secure the bigger, better studio on the main court at Queen's.\n\nThe internet giant has shown all the action on its Amazon Prime platform as part of a new five-year deal with the men's tour.\n\nThe Beeb, however, decided a re-run of Dragon's Den on BBC2 on Sunday night was more important than the conclusion of Andy Murray and Feliciano Lopez's doubles triumph, which was shifted to BBC4.\n\nAmazon have parked their tanks on the BBC's lawn at the Fever-Tree Championships\n\nThis after showing Murray's comeback on BBC2 earlier in the week had produced some very healthy ratings.\n\nAn offstage drama during Wimbledon, meanwhile, is likely to be the increasingly rancorous contest to become the next president of the International Tennis Federation.\n\nIrishman Dave Miley, standing as one of three reform candidates against American incumbent David Haggerty, has written to the ITF's ethics commission after he was barred this month from the annual meeting of African tennis nations, which Haggerty was allowed to address.\n\nMiley, who travelled to Madagascar but was not allowed into the conference, will officially launch his manifesto during the Championships.\n\nSenior figures at Wimbledon and in British tennis are among those becoming increasingly concerned by the conduct of Haggerty's re-election campaign.\n\nAmazon paid close to \u00a3100,000 to secure the bigger, better studio on the main court\n\nGUEST CALLUM OUT OF WEDDING PICTURE\n\nCallum Hudson-Odoi had to watch his step at Antonio Rudiger's wedding recently \u2014 and not just because he is recovering from an Achilles injury.\n\nThe celebration was attended by some of Rudiger's international team-mates, including Bayern Munich players, as well as his friends from Chelsea.\n\nThe German club are keen to sign Hudson-Odoi and made a string of bids in January, the highest hitting \u00a335million.\n\nSo, the 18-year-old was warned to make sure no awkward pictures emerged of him socialising with what could easily have been interpreted as his 'future team-mates'.\n\n\n\nCallum Hudson-Odoi had to be careful while celebrating at Antonio Rudiger's wedding\n\nSHOCK FAVOURITE TO TAKE OVER PLUM SUNDAY RADIO SLOT\n\nSteve Crossman has emerged as a surprise contender to take over BBC Radio 5 Live's prime Sunday afternoon slot when live Premier League football returns.\n\nJonathan Overend's five-year spell at the helm officially finished with India's World Cup clash against Pakistan on June 16, but the former tennis correspondent has been sidelined at times over the past 12 months with Mark Pougatch being used for some of the biggest matches.\n\nPougatch, who also presents ITV's football coverage, would have been an obvious fit to take over permanently, particularly given the station will broadcast live Premier League matches at 2pm and 4.30pm on Sundays next season.\n\nBut Middlesbrough-born World Service man Crossman, who reported from the England camp for 5 Live at last summer's World Cup, appears to be the favourite.\n\nThe station is also set to persist with The Squad at noon on Sundays, much to the dismay of many 5 Live insiders given it is largely lots of people talking over one another.\n\ntalkSPORT, meanwhile, will focus on promoting their three live Premier League matches on a Saturday, calling it Game Day.\n\nJonathan Overend's big five-year spell at the helm officially finished on June 16\n\nIt seems the unlikely pairing of Serena Willams and Mike Tyson, who both happened to be staying at the England women's team hotel in Antibes last week, did not embrace the spirit of the Women's World Cup.\n\nNeither were impressed \u2014 to put it mildly \u2014 by polite requests from England players for selfies.\n\nSocial media has played a key part in promoting the Lionesses during the tournament and content has been interesting, fun and original.\n\nBut players' sponsors were told last week there is a 'freeze' on all interviews until the team returns home from France.\n\nSerena Williams and Mike Tyson weren't impressed by requests from England stars for selfies\n\nGARY TELLS COACHES: DON'T MAKE SAME MISTAKES I DID\n\nGary Neville has been using his four-month spell at Valencia as a case study of how not to manage when urging young coaches to trust their gut on tactics.\n\nThe former England assistant coach told the Soccer Science Conference at Manchester's Hotel Football \u2014 which Neville part-owns: 'Have your idea and stick to it and when you lose matches reiterate that idea to the players.\n\n'I started 4-3-3 at Valencia, but ended up playing four different systems. I was jumping around like you wouldn't believe.\n\n'The players probably thought, \"He hasn't got a clue\". It only dawned on me when it was too late.'\n\nFormer Valencia manager Gary Neville has told young coaches to have an idea and 'stick to it'\n\nStevenage will hold a presentation on Wednesday to entice fans to buy a stake in the League Two club and bankroll a promotion bid.\n\nChairman Phil Wallace aims to raise \u00a31.2million by the end of July by offering 12 per cent equity in the club, with shares priced at \u00a325 each and a minimum investment of \u00a31,000.\n\nThe cash is pledged to be committed to player recruitment and wages. Investors will have a say in 'key issues' and receive a 25 per cent dividend if the club are promoted to League One and another 75 per cent if they reach the Championship.\n\nNuno Espirito Santo is not jumping for joy at the prospect of Wolves' pre-season trip to China\n\nWolves manager Nuno Espirito Santo is not exactly jumping for joy at the prospect of their long pre-season trip to China for the Premier League Asia Trophy.\n\nTheir Europa League campaign starts on July 25 \u2014 just five days after the club's final match in Shanghai.\n\nWolves' owners, Fosun International, are based in Shanghai and the jaunt is seen as prestigious for a club with ambitions to grow. Fortunately, Wolves' first Europa League tie against Crusaders or B36 Torshavn is at home.\n\nContributors: Adrian Kajumba, Dominic King, Ian Herbert, Mike Dickson and Jack Gaughan", "description": "SPORTS AGENDA - EDITED BY LAURA WILLIAMSON: Amazon have parked their tanks on the BBC's lawn at Queen's by paying close to \u00a3100,000 to secure the bigger, better studio.", "authors": ["Laura Williamson For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/06/23/21/15156804-0-image-a-31_1561320281733.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-23"}
