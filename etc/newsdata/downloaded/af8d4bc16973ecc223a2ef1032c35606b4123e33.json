President Trump\u2019s lawyer, Charles Harder, posted the 15-second clip online and submitted it in court documents as part of discovery in the case. Harder said in those documents that the recording proved Johnson\u2019s suit was \u201cunmeritorious and frivolous,\u201d calling the exchange \u201can innocent moment between a dedicated campaign staffer and the candidate for whom she was working.\u201d\n\nJohnson, who has said she previously met Trump twice before, can be heard saying in the video: \u201cWe\u2019re going to get you in the White House; I'll see you in February.\u201d\n\nIn the same court filings, Trump\u2019s attorneys also included a brief, personal declaration from the president saying he did not remember ever meeting Johnson. \u201cI do not know plaintiff Alva Johnson or recall having any interactions with her,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Johnson\u2019s lawyer, Hassan Zavareei, said on Wednesday in a statement to The Daily Beast that the video \u201cshows Trump grabbing Alva by the shoulders, pulling her into him, and kissing her in front of numerous co-workers and others\u201d and that it proved Johnson was \u201ctelling the truth about what her employer did to her.\u201d\n\nZavareei called Trump \u201cthe most powerful sexual predator on the face of the Earth,\u201d in light of the more than a dozen other women who have come forward with allegations of misconduct against Trump, including attempted rape, groping, and forcible kisses.\n\nThough Johnson doesn\u2019t appear shaken in the video, she has repeatedly said that she did not fully appreciate the interaction until she heard the now-infamous audio recording from the Access Hollywood tape in October 2016, when Trump bragged that he used his fame to forcibly kiss and grab women \u201cby the pussy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know I\u2019m automatically attracted to beautiful [women]\u2014I just start kissing them,\u201d said Trump, in the 2005 footage. \u201cIt\u2019s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don\u2019t even wait.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce the Access Hollywood tape came out, I knew that it wasn\u2019t just something that he did 15 years ago, that it was still his behavior, that he thinks he can violate your personal space, that he can kiss women without permission,\u201d Johnson recalled on Wednesday.\n\nAfter she filed the lawsuit, Johnson said she had to make \u201ca big adjustment\u201d to the onslaught of \u201cnasty comments and having your entire life under a microscope.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think people forget that I was at work. It\u2019s absurd to think that it was mutual,\u201d she continued. \u201cHe\u2019s a big guy. You should keep your hands to yourself, you should keep your lips to yourself.\u201d\n\nGoing public with her allegations \u201cwas very scary because a lot of his supporters are fanatics,\u201dJohnson said. \u201cBut I\u2019m proud of myself for standing up\u2014not only for myself\u2014but for other women.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve become kind of desensitized to his racism, to the misogyny,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cThat\u2019s a part of his MO. We are overwhelmed with the amount of absurd things that happen.\u201d\n\nJohnson said she was surprised that so many people sided with Trump after the video surfaced.\n\n\u201cHe has proven to be great at propaganda,\u201d she said. \u201cThey do a great job of changing the narrative, even when we see things with our own eyes.\u201d\n\nJohnson said that her case didn\u2019t get a \u201cfair shake\u201d from U.S. District Judge William Jung, who dismissed the suit on June 14 but allowed her to redraft her complaint if she still wished to pursue legal action against Trump.\n\n\u201cAs currently stated, the complaint presents a political lawsuit, not a tort and wages lawsuit,\u201d Jung wrote. \u201cIf [Johnson] wishes to make a political statement or bring a claim for political purposes, this is not the forum.\u201d\n\nJung\u2014a Trump appointee who was first nominated by Obama\u2014wrote that Johnson\u2019s case would have its \u201cfair day in court\u201d if she made the appropriate changes. He also allowed discovery to continue, which is why Trump\u2019s attorneys shared the video of the encounter in July.\n\nBut Johnson said she feels the fight is over.\n\n\u201cI am very proud that I fought,\u201d she said. \u201cI will continue to remain an outspoken advocate for women and for the injustices against women.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do still believe in humanity.\u201d", "description": "The former Trump campaign staffer first filed her case in February, claiming that Trump grabbed her and leaned in to kiss her at a Tampa rally in August 2016.", "authors": ["Olivia Messer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567636982/190904-messer-johnson-trump-suit-tease_s3iuvw"}
