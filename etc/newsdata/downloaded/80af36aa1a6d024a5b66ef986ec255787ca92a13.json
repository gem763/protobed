It prevented parliament from carrying out its constitutional role for five out of the possible eight weeks between the end of the summer recess and exit day on 31 October.\u201d\n\nShe said the effect of the decision \u201cupon the fundamentals of our democracy was extreme\u201d.\n\nDowning Street said the prime minister would not resign in the wake of the ruling.\n\nResponding to the news, the prime minister told reporters in New York: \u201cWe respect the judiciary in our country, we respect the court.\n\n\u201cI disagree profoundly with what they had to say. I think it was entirely right to go ahead with a plan for a Queen\u2019s Speech.\n\n\u201cFrankly we need to get on with Brexit. Whether they voted to Leave or Remain they want to get this thing done by 31 October and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.\u201d\n\nThe ruling triggered a wave of outrage, with immediate calls for Mr Johnson\u2019s resignation.\n\nSNP MP Joanna Cherry, who led the legal challenge in the Scottish courts, said it was \u201ca huge victory for the rule of law and for democracy\u201d and called on Mr Johnson to quit.\n\nShe said: \u201cThere is nothing to stop us members of parliament, such as myself and my colleagues, from resuming immediately the important job of scrutinising this minority Tory government as we hurtle towards Brexit.\u201d\n\nMr Corbyn reacted immediately to the ruling from the podium at his party\u2019s conference, saying it revealed Mr Johnson\u2019s \u201ccontempt for democracy\u201d and his \u201cabuse of power\u201d.\n\n\u201cI invite Boris Johnson in the historic words to consider his position and become the shortest-serving prime minister there\u2019s ever been,\u201d he said.\n\nLiberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson said: \u201cThe court have found what we all knew all along \u2013 Boris Johnson has again proven he is not fit to be prime minister.\n\n\u201cThis shutdown was an unlawful act designed to stop parliament doing its job and holding the government to account.\u201d\n\nEx-Tory prime minister Sir John Major, who supported the legal case brought by Gina Miller, said Mr Johnson should make an \u201cunreserved apology\u201d.\n\n\u201cI hope this ruling from the Supreme Court will deter any future prime minister from attempting to shut down parliament, with the effect of stifling proper scrutiny and debate, when its sitting is so plainly in the national interest,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Farage, the Brexit Party leader, led calls for the sacking of Mr Cummings, who is widely regarded as the brains behind the prorogation plan.\n\nFormer cabinet minister David Gauke, who lost the Tory whip after rebelling over Brexit, said: \u201cI think he needs a change of strategy and I think he needs a change of strategist.\u201d", "description": "Boris Johnson\u2019s historic defeat at the hands of the Supreme Court justices has been described as a \u201chuge victory for the rule of law and for democracy\u201d.
