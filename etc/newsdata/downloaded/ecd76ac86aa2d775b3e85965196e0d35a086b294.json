Statement was dominated by the same story that has overlayed every piece of economic news and activity since the decision by the British people to vote Leave back in June.\n\nNamely, exactly how good or bad will our exit from the European Union finally prove to be?\n\nWill our impending independence make us a soaring economic powerhouse or will we find ourselves in uncertain and choppy waters in which growing our economy becomes a trickier task than we\u2019d hoped?\n\nDuring the referendum, all sorts of extravagant, elaborate and precise claims were made by both sides about the merits of remaining or leaving.\n\nCertainly, some of the more apocalyptic predictions about the UK tipping into recession the moment we dared to choose to exit the EU have not come to pass.\n\nPro-Brexit demonstrators protest outside the Houses of Parliament on November 23, 2016\n\nArticle 50 WILL trigger economic pain and uncertainty, writes pro-leave advocate Mark Littlewood, as he calls for end to 'Brexit blame game'\n\nBut there is a real danger that the victorious Brexiteers are now dismissing any sort of honest, but downbeat, forecast as part of a conspiracy to talk down Britain and seek to halt the triggering of Article 50.\n\nSo it was that last week, projections by Robert Chote of the Office for Budget Responsibility and Paul Johnson of the Institute for Fiscal Studies were portrayed in some quarters as agents of a continuity Remain campaign.\n\nTheir warnings that economic growth might be a little less than they\u2019d previously speculated were rubbished as propaganda and biased doom mongering.\n\nIn fact, both Mr Chote and Mr Johnson are attempting to give a genuinely independent assessment of how the British economy will fare in the coming years.\n\nMost economists, themselves included, know this can be something of a fool\u2019s errand.\n\nThere are so many imponderables and so many unknowns that the margin for error in any such forecast is very considerable.\n\nBut in the same way that football pundits or racing tipsters often try to give their honest views of a likely sporting outcome, so the Chotes and Johnsons of the world try to crunch numbers in order to give their best, but admittedly imperfect, view of what UK growth, spending and debt might look like.\n\nThey may end up being wrong, but they are assuredly independent, well informed and well intentioned experts who are in a good position to give some sort of outline sketch of our immediate economic future.\n\nThe fact they have suggested that the Brexit process might see economic growth being a tad less impressive in the next couple of years is a reasoned and reasonable conclusion to reach.\n\nIt is not part of some Establishment plot to seek to undo the decision made by the British people in the referendum.\n\nPublic finance watchdog chief Robert Chote who has insisted that his Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) resisted attempts from Treasury officials to change the wording of reports\n\nThere is good reason to believe they might well be right.\n\nIt is also concerning that government debt will increase by around \u00a3120bn due partly to these more sluggish growth figures.\n\nBusinesses loathe uncertainty, and the failure of the May Government to even begin to signal what post-Brexit Britain might look like makes it extraordinarily difficult for companies to make any meaningful long-term investment decisions.\n\nThis lack of clarity is likely to persist for a while longer.\n\nThe protracted negotiation about how we divorce ourselves from the EU is not even going to begin for another four or five months.\n\nAny suggestion that the next couple of years might be economically difficult should not be rubbished as prejudiced doom mongering by whinging Remainers.\n\nIn fact, those of us who backed Brexit would be much better advised to accept that there might be some short term pain, but that this is a price worth paying for re-establishing ourselves as an independent, sovereign nation with the ability to determine our own destiny over the longer term.\n\nLeave voters across the country seem willing to pay this price, even if some pro-Brexit politicians are determined to deny that there might be any short-term cost at all.\n\nThe electorate clearly understood there would be some risks associated with a decision to exit the EU, but a majority decided it was a price well worth paying.\n\nVoters Leave supporters wait for London Mayor Boris Johnson to address campaigners during a rally for the Vote Leave campaign on April 15, 2016 in Manchester, England\n\nJust as an individual who moves house or changes jobs knows they are facing some immediate dislocating effects and costs, they are willing to bear these in the hope that things will work out better for them over the longer run.\n\nSo, we all need to be a little less hysterical about the possibility that the British economy might grow at around about 1.5 per cent next year, rather than the 2 per cent or so that was previously anticipated in the spring.\n\nThe downgrade is not enormous and it is not claimed to be a certainty.\n\nBut if you want to fundamentally change the direction and future positioning of an entire country, you can\u2019t expect this to happen on a cost-free basis.\n\nOptimistic Brexiteers should embrace this modest, immediate economic pain as being natural, normal and unsurprising \u2013 not try to pretend that there will be no downsides to leaving the EU whatsoever.\n\nThe electorate is smart enough to realise that what really matters is how we make Brexit work for us in the years and decades to come and not to worry unduly about a bit of market volatility and a few postponed investment decisions over the next 12 months.\n\nAnd it is here that we should be focusing our criticism on the Government itself, not on independent forecasters who are providing their best guesses in a turbulent and uncertain world.\n\nThe May administration claims it is refusing to reveal its hand for fear this might prejudice its upcoming negotiations with the European Union.\n\nBlaming independent forecasters for simply pointing these out is not remotely helpful or even fair, says Mark Littlewood\n\nBut this is a pretty feeble and unconvincing stance.\n\nAt the last General Election, the Tories made it publicly plain what sort of demands David Cameron would make as he tried, and failed, to renegotiate our EU membership.\n\nThe suspicion now must be not that Theresa May is wishing to hold her cards close to her chest but that she and her fellow Ministers can\u2019t even agree on what sort of hand they hold.\n\nLike many millions of others, I voted to Leave on June 23.\n\nI did so with my eyes open and in the certain knowledge that there would be some economic pain and some uncertainties in doing so.\n\nBlaming independent forecasters for simply pointing these out is not remotely helpful or even fair.\n\nLet\u2019s admit that we have chosen to follow the riskier, but braver, path and demand that our Government navigates a sensible route to the sunlit uplands.", "description": "Last
