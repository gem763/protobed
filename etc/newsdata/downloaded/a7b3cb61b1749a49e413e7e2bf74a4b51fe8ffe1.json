They know that\u2019s ridiculous: as USA Today noted yesterday, 47 Republican members on the relevant committees leading the investigation \u201chave access to the closed-door depositions.\u201d\n\nIn fact, many of the members who barged into a secure congressional hearing room this week, disrupting the process as a press stunt, were fully permitted to be there. They didn\u2019t need to storm the gates; they already had an invitation. It was a pointless made-for-the-cameras circus.\n\nBut on the show last night, Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N.Y.), a member of the House Intelligence Committee, raised a related point I hadn\u2019t heard before.\n\nMALONEY: It\u2019s not enough that [dozens of House Republicans on the relevant committees] have every right to be there for every deposition, that their lawyers get equal time, that their members get equal time. And, of course, the funny part is, is very few of them have taken advantage of that because apparently they don\u2019t want to do the actual work. MADDOW: Republican members haven\u2019t been sitting in on the depositions even when they\u2019re allowed to? MALONEY: Very few.\n\nHmm. Is that so.\n\nAs a rule, we know very few details about the behind-closed-door testimony from recent weeks. There are exceptions when witnesses release opening statements to the public, offering us important insights, and we occasionally hear broad-brush reactions from members who reflect on their general impressions of some depositions.\n\nBut Sean Patrick Maloney hinted at something different, without divulging any secretive details. By the New York Democrat\u2019s account, dozens of Republicans have the right to be there for witness depositions, but they\u2019re choosing not to fully engage in the process \u2013 not because there\u2019s a rigged process blocking them, but because some GOP lawmakers apparently don\u2019t feel like doing \u201cthe actual work.\u201d\n\nI haven\u2019t seen Maloney\u2019s account confirmed by others, but if he\u2019s right, it raises a provocative dynamic: congressional Republicans could spend less time whining about the process and more time working as part of the process. They simply have to make a decision to play the role of serious and constructive lawmakers.", "description": "Dozens of House Republicans have the ability to fully participate in the impeachment inquiry.
