He has become one of the most vocal supporters of Trump\u2019s aggressive approach to immigration.\n\n\u201cOur nation has the most generous legal immigration system in the world and we must zealously safeguard its promise for those who lawfully come here,\u201d Cuccinelli said at the time of his appointment in June.\n\nMorgan is the acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, another DHS agency, and a former Obama administration official who stepped down as Border Patrol chief at the beginning of Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nA federal statute governing agency succession dictates that to temporarily fill Cabinet-level vacancies, the president can only appoint officials who are either next in line for the post, hold a Senate-confirmed position or have served for at least 90 days under the previous secretary. Both Cuccinelli and Morgan are serving in their posts in acting capacities, and neither worked under the previous Senate-confirmed secretary \u2015 that is, Kirstjen Nielsen.\n\nTrump announced on Oct. 11 that acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan was stepping down to \u201cspend more time with his family and go into the private sector.\u201d\n\nThough never formally nominated for the post, McAleenan took over the department this past spring after Nielsen was forced out for reportedly refusing to reinstate Trump\u2019s policy of separating migrant children from their families at the border.\n\nTrump and his allies apparently also thought McAleenan was not doing enough to champion the president\u2019s immigration policies. McAleenan said earlier this month that he was struggling to control the department.\n\n\u201cWhat I don\u2019t have control over is the tone, the message, the public face and approach of the department in an increasingly polarized time,\u201d McAleenan told The Washington Post. \u201cThat\u2019s uncomfortable, as the accountable senior figure.\u201d\n\nThe Post described McAleenan as increasingly isolated and overshadowed by other Trump appointees more \u201ceffusive\u201d in their praise of the president.\n\nTrump has gone through four Homeland Security secretaries \u2015 two Senate-confirmed and two acting \u2015 in less than three years.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nTrump Gives Hard-Liner Ken Cuccinelli Top Immigration Job Despite Bipartisan Opposition\n\nActing Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan Is Out After Just 6 Months\n\nLove HuffPost?
