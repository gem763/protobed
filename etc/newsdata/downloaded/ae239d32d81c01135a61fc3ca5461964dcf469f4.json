But in mentioning the whistleblower\u2019s safety, Pelosi telegraphed the possibility of a charge of obstruction or witness tampering.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very worried about the security of the whistleblower,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m very ashamed of the president\u2019s words, threatening whistleblowers or anyone who gives that information.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor 25 years, I\u2019ve been in intelligence,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cI was there to write the rules for whistleblowers and to protect them. Intelligence depends on whistleblowers being protected. So the president doing what he\u2019s doing is undermining our national security as well as endangering people who speak truth to power.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/19/86/b91e4daa4674a702787f2187323a/190925-pelosi-gty-773.jpg"}
