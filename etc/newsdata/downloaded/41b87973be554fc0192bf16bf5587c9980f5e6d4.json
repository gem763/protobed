The Bulgairan manager has no luxuries at all, or anything even approaching an elite-level player.\n\nBalakov is probably still the most famous figure in the squad, and he wouldn\u2019t have even have had to be one of the stars of their exhilarating USA 94 campaign for that to be the case. There were the size of the clubs he played for, like so many of that squad. Balakov spent the majority of his career at Sporting Lisbon and Stuttgart.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThere\u2019s barely anyone close to that in his own squad for this match. Many football fans would struggle to pick out where their clubs are on a map, let alone pick out the actual players themselves.\n\nOf the 14 from this 22-man squad who don\u2019t still play in Bulgaria, the highest level is probably captain Ivelin Popov at Rostov or Nikolay Dimitrov in the Russian Premier League, and then Bozhidar Kraev at Gil Vicente in the Portuguese Primeira Liga. After that you\u2019ve got players at Sturm Graz in Austria, Fehervar in Hungary, Kasimpasa in the Turkish Super Lig, Slovan Bratislava, Qarabag, Ararat-Armenia and Chemnitzer FC in the German third tier.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

He hopes for his first cap.\n\nIt is a long way from the Dimitar Berbatov team in the 5-0 hammering to Sweden in Euro 2004, Bulgaria\u2019s sole qualification this millennium, let alone the glories of the 1990s.\n\nIt is also why this match at Wembley is almost certain to be another procession in this group for England, with 3-0 a conservative prediction.\n\nAll of the various themes that usually come up in advance of such games \u2013 like the make-up of Southgate\u2019s midfield, whether certain players will kick on \u2013 are almost irrelevant to how this match itself will pan out. They are only relevant in the longer term for England, with Bulgaria \u2013 a country responsible for one of the great teams and one of the great players in Hristo Stoichkov \u2013 an almost instantly forgettable barrier on a wider journey.\n\nMuch of this is a connected contrast to how countries like England \u2013 and Spain, Germany and France \u2013 have effectively mega-industrialised talent production, to a point no one else can match. It has led to a situation that David Goldblatt describes in his perceptive new book, \u2018The Age of Football\u2019, where so much of the game\u2019s ultra wealth is concentrated in a core group of western European countries. It is difficult enough for nations like Argentina to adapt to this. It is almost impossible for eastern European nations like Bulgaria \u2013 and Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Romania \u2013 who have a whole other set of historic problems. The destruction of Soviet-legacy infrastructures opened up the clubs and the federations to corruption and this contraction.\n\nNorthern Ireland manager Michael O\u2019Neill spoke about this perceptively in the Irish Times in October, specifically opening with Bulgaria.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re suffering because of the power of the Premier League, no doubt about that,\u201d O\u2019Neill said. \u201cBut, you know, it\u2019s not just an Irish problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt international level Bulgarian football is awful\u2026 Look at Romania, the same, or similar. Poland have bucked the trend a bit, they\u2019ve players at Monaco, Bayern Munich. Do you know who\u2019s the top player from the Czech Republic any more? Actually, it\u2019s [Vladimir] Darida, who plays in the Bundesliga. But it\u2019s another country affected.\u201d\n\nCould you have named the top player in Bulgaria before this piece? Are you all that energised by Saturday?\n\nIt is just another international fixture that illustrates the health of English football right now, as well as the problems that exist beyond the western European game. It all means England should have no such problems in this fixture.", "description": "It is both an indication of the invigorating new strength of the England\u00a0national team and a disconcerting reality that Bulgaria, and nations of a similar ilk,\u00a0are facing.", "authors": ["Miguel Delaney"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/05/17/england-bulgaria.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
