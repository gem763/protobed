I was like, \u2018You\u2019re kidding me. He coded? And now he\u2019s had this massive heart attack?\u2019 I couldn\u2019t believe it. I\u2019m still in shock,\u201d his wife Hollie McVey said, according to WXIX.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been really hard,\u201d she added. \u201cWe have two little girls, and they keep asking me if Dad\u2019s going to die.\u201d\n\nMr. McVey was reportedly attacked with a knife while driving for Uber on Sept. 29 after getting into an argument with a passenger after reaching his destination. Mr. McVey allegedly drove back to the pick-up point and was able to flag down a security guard, who radioed police.\n\nPolice said when they arrived, the suspect was swinging his knife at Mr. McVey, according to The Sacramento Bee. The suspect was arrested and \u2014 shortly after escaping the assault \u2014 Mr. McVey suffered a heart attack.\n\nThe Bee reported the suspect, Cedric Jeter, is being held in the Sacramento County jail on charges of assault with a deadly weapon, making criminal threats and resisting arrest.\n\nHis bond is set at $250,000, and his bail hearing is set for Tuesday.\n\nMs. McVey \u2014 who has opened a GoFundMe to help with medical expenses \u2014 slammed Uber for not helping more to support their drivers.\n\n\u201cIf they can\u2019t do anything to keep them safe, at least if something does happen, they need to have some financial protection for them,\u201d she said.\n\nUber has \u201creached out to offer support and sends its thoughts to Joseph McVey and his family,\u201d according to WXIX.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
