(\u201cHalo\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (NEO: HALO, OTCQX: AGEEF, Germany: A9KN) is pleased to announce it has entered into a definitive agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) to acquire all of the common shares of Cannpos Services Corp. (\u201cCannpos\u201d) for (i) CAD $4.69 million in Halo common shares at a deemed price of CAD $0.26 per share; and (ii) 1,250,000 performance warrants, subject to vesting and exercise restrictions, to purchase 1,250,000 Halo common shares (the \u201cAcquisition\u201c).\n\nCannpos is a software company that is developing an application to alleviate customer flow constraints currently experienced by dispensaries. Subject to state and local regulations, once fully functional, the application will enable customers to electronically interact with dispensaries, thereby reducing wait times and improving customer experience. Dispensaries will also be able to use the application to display in-store specials, advertise specific products, and track customers\u2019 purchasing patterns. The application\u2019s tracking capabilities will enable dispensaries and Halo to gather business intelligence on end customers, in compliance with privacy laws. The application is being designed to be used on a smart phone or tablet and is expected to be available on the Apple and Android app stores once complete and tested. Halo intends to rebrand the application as \u201cDispensaryTrack\u201d and offer it to its retail partners for an ongoing monthly service fee.\n\n\u201cSecuring shelf space is highly competitive and being able to add to Halo\u2019s value proposition will lead to a stronger bottom line in the long term,\u201d said Kiran Sidhu, CEO and Co-Founder of Halo. \u201cThe Company believes that DispensaryTrack will provide its sales force with a unique selling proposition to key dispensary clients, which in turn should foster longer term relationships\u201d.\n\nThe Acquisition is expected to be completed through a three-cornered amalgamation whereby Halo will acquire 100% of Cannpos\u2019 outstanding common shares from its shareholders in exchange for 18,035,714 Halo common shares and 1,250,000 performance warrants. The performance warrants will only vest and become exercisable when the application has been custom designed to meet Halo\u2019s specifications within one year after closing of the Acquisition. The Agreement requires the existing developers to work with the Company to develop the application and provide for a smooth transition. The common shares issued by Halo in conjunction with the Acquisition will be subject to certain sale restrictions.\n\nConcurrent Non-Brokered Private Placement\n\nAs a condition to closing of the Acquisition, Halo is pleased to announce a concurrent non-brokered private placement of Halo common shares at a price of CAD $0.31 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of up to CAD $3 million (\u201cConcurrent Financing\u201d). Any securities issued in connection with the Concurrent Financing will be subject to a four month and one day statutory hold period pursuant to applicable securities laws.\n\nHalo intends to use the proceeds of the Concurrent Financing to complete the development and deployment of DispensaryTrack and continue its expansion efforts in California, including the increase of its direct sales force and product offerings and the growth of its manufacturing capacity in Cathedral City.\n\nBoth the Acquisition and Concurrent Financing are expected to close on or before October 15, 2019 and are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary conditions, including the receipt of all applicable regulatory and stock exchange approvals.\n\nABOUT HALO\n\nHalo is a cannabis extraction company that develops and manufactures quality cannabis oils and concentrates, which are the fastest growing segments in the cannabis industry.
