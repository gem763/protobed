But it\u2019s many thousands of miles away.\u201d\n\nTrump blasted the leaders of Germany, France, and the United Kingdom for refusing to take back their ISIS terrorists, declaring that he will not allow the American taxpayer to subsidize the cost of detaining terrorists who did not come from the U.S. He said:\n\nThe European nations have been a tremendous disappointment because I personally called \u2026 \u2018Take your ISIS fighters\u2019 and they didn\u2019t want them. They said we don\u2019t want them. They came from France, they came from Germany, they came from the U.K. They came from a lot of countries. And I actually said to them \u2018If you don\u2019t take them, I\u2019m going to drop them right on your border and you can have fun capturing them again.\u2019 [Emphasis added] The United States taxpayer is not going to pay for the next 50 years \u2026 we\u2019re not going to pay tens of billions of dollars because we were good enough to capture people that want to go back to Germany, France, the U.K., and other parts of Europe. And they can walk back. They can\u2019t walk to our country. [Emphasis added]\n\nIndeed, Trump\u2019s travel ban has been the most successful legal immigration reform that the president has enacted into law. Through the refugee resettlement program \u2014 which Trump has cut down to the lowest admission rate in history \u2014 less than 7,000 refugees from Chad, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria, and Yemen have been admitted to the U.S. since Trump was inaugurated.\n\nSpecifically, the U.S. has admitted only one refugee from Libya, 10 refugees from Chad, 1,335 refugees from Iran, more than 2,800 refugees from Iraq, 21 refugees from Yemen, and nearly 2,600 refugees from Syria since January 20, 2017.\n\nThe vast majority of these refugees \u2014 5,345 of the 6,830 admissions \u2014 were brought to the U.S. in 2017 when Trump\u2019s travel ban was being challenged in court. In 2018, less than 250 refugees from travel ban countries were admitted along with less than 1,300 admitted this year.\n\nCompare these figures to former President Obama\u2019s refugee admissions from travel ban countries between January 2014 and October 2016, when almost 64,000 refugees were brought to the U.S. Across the last three years of the Obama administration, more than 15,600 refugees arrived to the U.S. from Syria \u2014 more than double the total number of refugees admitted from travel ban countries in Trump\u2019s first three years in office.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.
