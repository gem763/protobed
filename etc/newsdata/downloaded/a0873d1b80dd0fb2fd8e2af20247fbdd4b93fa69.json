But this is Trump we\u2019re talking about. From the beginning, it was rather unclear exactly what circumstances would qualify as \u201cvictory\u201d in the trade conflict. The president has railed against lost U.S. jobs in manufacturing and tradable sectors, as well as our massive trade deficit with China. But the actual concrete demands that have emerged from Trump\u2019s trade war relate to questions of intellectual property, China\u2019s aforementioned technology transfer policies, and the general openness of China\u2019s domestic market to foreign \u2014 i.e. American \u2014 businesses and investors. These are demands that, if met, would have considerable impact on U.S. corporate profits and payouts to wealthy American shareholders, but they would do little-to-nothing for blue collar jobs or wages.\n\nThe one big exception to this is the question of currency values: specifically, that China\u2019s currency perpetually undercuts America\u2019s on global exchange markets. Trump\u2019s brought the issue up, but it\u2019s flitted in and out of negotiations like a ghost. To the degree it sticks, it seems intended to protect the effectiveness of Trump\u2019s tariffs, rather than as a goal in itself.\n\nHowever, if we assume that, for Trump, perpetual trade war is a goal in and of itself, all of this makes a lot more sense.", "description": "", "authors": ["Jeff Spross", "Theweek.Com Articles Does-Trump-Want-Trade-War-End"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
