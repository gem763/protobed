I\u2019m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories to help you over the line and into the weekend.\n\nJohn Bercow has promised that he will be prepared to rip up the parliamentary rulebook to stop any illegal attempt by Boris Johnson to take the UK out of the EU without a deal on 31 October. The Commons Speaker, who announced that he is standing down next month, has been a thorn in the side of hardline Conservative MPs throughout the Brexit process. Delivering the Bingham lecture in London last night, Bercow said he would permit \u201cadditional procedural creativity\u201d if necessary to allow parliament to block the prime minister from ignoring the law. He warned: \u201cThe only form of Brexit that we have, whenever that might be, will be a Brexit that the House of Commons has explicitly endorsed.\u201d Bercow also said that the Brexit imbroglio had exposed weaknesses in the political system and he was now persuaded that a royal commission was needed to examine whether a written constitution was needed.\n\nThe Speaker\u2019s intervention came as Johnson was forced to deny accusations that he misled the Queen over the reasons for proroguing parliament this week and as MPs condemned the government\u2019s \u201cGet ready for Brexit\u201d ad campaign as \u201cmisleading\u201d. And in case you need to remind yourself of how we got here, Jon Henley traces the long road to the crisis of the past 10 days.\n\nDemocrats clash \u2013 Joe Biden has clashed on the issue of healthcare with Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, his leading rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination, in the latest debate between the candidates. Biden, who was vice-president under Barack Obama for eight years, defended the administration\u2019s Obamacare scheme and challenged his rivals to spell out how they pay for their plans to provide healthcare for all and eliminate private insurance. Questions about gun violence, immigration and trade also revealed a difference of opinion and strong criticism of president Donald Trump. Richard Wolffe reckons Biden was the best \u2013 and worst \u2013 on the stage in Houston, while Tom McCarthy says the former vice-president fumbled his facts. You can read exactly how it all unfolded on our live blog here.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Elizabeth Warren makes a point to Joe Biden during the debate at Texas Southern University in Houston.

Around 95,600 people, mainly drug users, are thought to have the disease but are unaware of the condition because they have not been diagnosed, Public Health England warns today. Steve Mowle, of the Royal College of GPs, said the figures were \u201cextremely concerning\u201d and called the situation a \u201csignificant public health risk\u201d. Nine in 10 people infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) inject recreational drugs such as heroin or have done so. The virus is spread among drug users by sharing contaminated needles.\n\nKnife killing \u2013 A man has died and another has been taken to hospital after a double stabbing in Camden High Street in north-west London. Police said they were called to the area, which has many pubs and clubs, shortly after 11pm last night. They found a man suffering from a stab wound but he was pronounced dead at the scene. Another man in his 20s was found nearby with a knife wound and was taken to hospital. It is the latest in a series of knife killings to blight the capital this year.\n\nTunnel vision \u2013 It is rated one of the most endangered Victorian buildings in Britain. But campaigners fear that an abandoned railway tunnel hundreds of feet under the Pennines could be lost to the nation if Department of Transport officials get their way and are allowed to fill it with concrete. Heritage groups instead want to restore the 1.4-mile tunnel, which was built to link Halifax and Keighley in 1878, and turn it into a cycle path as Yorkshire seeks to secure its place as \u201cthe beating heart of British cycling\u201d.\n\nMail models \u2013 A study of French postmen\u2019s testicles and a nappy-changing machine were among the winners of this year\u2019s Ig Nobel awards, the alternative science prizes that aim to \u201cfirst make people laugh, and then make them think\u201d. Roger Mieusset, a fertility specialist at the University of Toulouse, found the way to renown by strapping thermometers to the testicles of postmen in order to determine if one sac is warmer than the other. It turns out the left is warmer, but only when a man is clothed. (Who knew?) Britain\u2019s frontrunner was Francis McGlone, a researcher at Liverpool John Moores University, who won for mapping which parts of the body are most pleasurable to scratch.\n\nToday in Focus podcast\n\nTom Phillips, our Latin America correspondent, describes his recent Amazon trip and examines the impact of the new era of wrecking ushered in by Brazil\u2019s president, Jair Bolsonaro.

Photograph: Melinda Sue Gordon/AP\n\nIf you\u2019re stuck for something to talk about with friends, family or colleagues this weekend you could do worse than summon up our list of the top 100 films of the century so far. Compiled lovingly by our film team, it counts down through the gamut of gangsters, lovers, aliens and animes to arrive at No 1, which goes to \u2026 There Will Be Blood. Our lead critic Peter Bradshaw explains why Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s \u201cstrange masterpiece\u201d is top of the pile but I won\u2019t spoil the rest of the countdown for you. We\u2019ve also asked some leading directors to pick their favourites.\n\nSport\n\nJos Buttler put confusing thoughts of fatigue to one side and decided to have some fun before the counterattacking half-century that has kept England\u2019s heads above water in the final Ashes Test. Mitchell Marsh, the Australia all-rounder, is always a controversial pick but he swung the ball more than any bowler in the series to grab four England wickets on day one at the Oval. Kyle Sinckler has insisted he is relishing the prospect of playing two matches in five days at the start of England\u2019s Rugby World Cup campaign, claiming he is well prepared to do so. Europe\u2019s Suzann Pettersen says she is \u201cfine\u201d but will miss the first morning of the Solheim Cup due to illness. Anthony Joshua\u2019s trainer Rob McCracken will not face any disciplinary action for saying he allowed his heavyweight to keep fighting while concussed, after receiving the full backing of the British Boxing Board of Control. Clinical first-half finishing from Kim Little and Vivianne Miedema ensured Arsenal will host the second leg with a surely unassailable four-goal lead over Fiorentina on their Champions League return. And former New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski, who announced his retirement in March, has said he absorbed about 20 concussions in a lifetime on the gridiron.\n\nBusiness\n\nThe European Central Bank\u2019s decision to relaunch quantitative easing to boost the ailing eurozone economy has helped to lift stocks in Asia overnight. Mario Draghi, in one of his last acts as ECB president, announced an interest rate cut and plans to inject \u20ac20bn a month into the financial markets. But he also warned countries with stronger balance sheets to increase spending in order to take some of the strain off the central bank. Either way, investors liked the extra stimulus and shares pushed higher on the main Asian indices. The FTSE100 is seen rising 0.3% at the open this morning while sterling is flat at $1.233 and \u20ac1.114.\n\nThe papers\n\nThe Times is optimistic about a new Brexit plan: \u201cDUP opens door to new Brexit deal for Johnson\u201d, whereas the Guardian has: \u201cBercow: I\u2019ll stop Johnson breaking the law on Brexit\u201d. The Telegraph leads on Corbyn\u2019s plans to charge VAT on private school fees: \u201cCorbyn tax raid on private schools\u201d and the Express has: \u201cBoris: Labour will \u2018clobber\u2019 you with tax hikes\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: The Guardian\n\nThe i says \u201cNHS hit with \u00a3600m interest bill \u2013 by Whitehall\u201d and the Sun reports on the BA pilot strike: \u201cBritish scareways\u201d.

The Mirror features a picture of its US editor standing in the midst of burning trees in the Amazon, wearing a full suit, tie and what appears to be a flower in his lapel: \u201cOur world... choking to death\u201d.\n\nSign up\n\nThe Guardian morning briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes bright and early every weekday.
