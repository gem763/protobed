Whitmer\u2019s office said immediately after the ruling and said they would have more of a response shortly. Michigan announced its ban on flavored vaping products on Sept. 4 - the first in the nation to do so - and it went into effect two weeks later.\n\nThe emergency rules issued by Gov. Whitmer prohibit the sale of flavored nicotine vaping products, including to adults, and the misleading marketing of e-cigarettes. The ban was in response to Chief Medical Executive Joneigh Khaldun declaring a public health emergency over the increase in youth e-cigarette use.\n\nThe six-month ban was implemented on Sept.18, and businesses had 14 days to comply with it or they would be subject to potential jailing and a $200 fine.\n\nGov. Whitmer has accused companies of using candy flavors and deceptive advertising to \"hook children on nicotine.\"\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reported a 78 percent increase from 2017 to 2018 among high school students now vaping.
