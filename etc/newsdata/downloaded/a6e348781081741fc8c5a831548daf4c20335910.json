Generally, if the vehicle is stationary and is likely to remain so for more than a couple of minutes, you should apply the parking brake and switch off the engine to reduce emissions and noise pollution. However it is permissible to leave the engine running if the vehicle is stationary in traffic or for diagnosing faults.\n\nCouncils have the power to fine people but only a handful do so (Picture: PA)\n\nRAC head of roads policy Nicholas Lyes said: \u2018Councils already have the powers to deal with this problem, but few are currently doing so.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Many of the drivers we questioned would like to see some firm action taken against offenders. This is no doubt needed to bring about a change in behaviour.\n\n\u2018You could liken the current situation with engine idling to that of taking your own carrier bags to the supermarket: everyone knew it was the right thing to do, but few of us did it until a compulsory charge was introduced.\n\n\u2018While the law is already in place for idling, enforcement is limited if not non-existent.\u2019\n\nIn June, the Department for Transport announced it intends to launch a public consultation looking at increasing fines for idling drivers.\n\nLocal Government Association transport spokesman David Renard said: \u2018Although fines to drivers who leave their engines idling are issued as a last resort, the legislation to enable this is hard to enforce in practice.\n\n\u2018Councils have prioritised changing behaviour by educating motorists, which is often more effective than issuing fines.\n\n\u2018As part of their review of air quality legislation, the Government should look again at whether these powers are working how they intended and whether they could be made simpler to use while still being fair to the motorist.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
