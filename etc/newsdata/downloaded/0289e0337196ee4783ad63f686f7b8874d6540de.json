While Gawker itself ceased to exist, its constellation of related sites including Kotaku, Deadspin, Jezebel, Gizmodo, and others survived. These sites were sold back in April to a private equity firm called Great Hills Media. Great Hills also purchased the Onion and formed G/O Media.\n\nThings must not be going very well at the former Gawker sites because recently several of them re-introduced autoplay ads with sound, something which hasn\u2019t been seen much on the internet for nearly a decade. That led to three of the sites, Deadspin, Kotaku, and Jezebel, publishing identical stories Monday afternoon titled \u201cA note to our readers\u201d about the auto-sound ads:\n\n\u201cEditorial staffers at all levels of this company have made our concerns known in various conversations with members of G/O Media\u2019s senior leadership team,\u201d the blog read. \u201cWe think it would be good for them to hear from you as well, so we invite you to submit feedback about our site\u2019s current user experience \u2026 Please keep your comments respectful.\u201d Within a few hours, management at G/O Media, which is owned by the private equity firm Great Hill Partners, unilaterally deleted these blog posts soliciting feedback.\n\nThe employees\u2019 union noted the deletion, posted a copy of the original note to readers.\n\nWe\u2019re re-posting the statement as a screenshot here as we gather more information. We thank you, our readers and supporters, for standing with us through this process.

Vice reports there were around 1,300 responses in a few hours. But by this morning the email address had been shut down.\n\nour bosses heard from so many of you that they\u2019ve disabled forwarding for this email address. direct action works, and they\u2019re scared of it. we\u2019ve spent the morning planning next steps. stay tuned, and thank you for standing with us. https://t.co/5iYobWJRqC \u2014 GMG Union (@gmgunion) October 29, 2019\n\nAt least one former employee encouraged people to start emailing the CEO directly:\n\nIf you have questions about why G/O Media's CEO is scared of reader feedback, or his understanding of the company's union contract, or why he seems to hate the sites he bought, a good place to ask would be [email protected] https://t.co/fa2b7dXpqz \u2014 Megan Greenwell (@megreenwell) October 29, 2019\n\nWhile all of this was happening, the owners had also issued an ultimatum to Deadspin\u2019s employees Monday telling them to stick to sports:\n\nIn a Monday memo to staff, G/O Media editorial director Paul Maidment told the employees of the site\u2014which primarily covers sports, but also frequently writes about media, politics, and culture\u2014to abstain from stories that do not have an explicit link to sports. \u201cTo create as much great sports journalism as we can requires a 100% focus of our resources on sports. And it will be the sole focus,\u201d Maidment said. \u201cDeadspin will write only about sports and that which is relevant to sports in some way.\u201d\n\nBut Deadspin employees decided to do their own thing. In fact, on Tuesday they made their entire homepage a collection of non-sports stories, including \u201cThree Good Dogs I Met.\u201d Some of the stories on the homepage today were months old, like this one about the Covington students:\n\nThis is in response to the Deadspin management edict to stick to sports. The editors made the whole front page nothing but non-sports stories. So as they're packing up their desks, at least they can congratulate themselves on sticking it to The Man. pic.twitter.com/rT4yHUPqRz \u2014 \ud83d\udc7bGrim Creature\ud83c\udf83 (@jtLOL) October 29, 2019\n\nA short time after this effort to disregard the owner\u2019s wishes, a Deputy Editor at the site announced he had been fired:\n\nHi! I\u2019ve just been fired from Deadspin for not sticking to sports. \u2014 Barry Petchesky (@barry) October 29, 2019\n\nThe union responded on Twitter promising \u201cThis will not stand.\u201d\n\nEarlier today, @JimSpanfeller, CEO of G/O Media, fired our colleague and longtime Deadspin Deputy Editor Barry Petchesky. This will not stand. We will have updates soon. \u2014 GMG Union (@gmgunion) October 29, 2019\n\nSo, to sum all of this up, readers and employees are unhappy with the company\u2019s choice of annoying ads and encouraged readers to complain about it. The company deleted those posts and warned writers at Deadspin to stick to sports. But Deadspin decided to give the owners a big middle finger by making today\u2019s home page completely non-sports. The company responded by firing a deputy editor and the union is now vowing that his firing will not stand. Generally speaking, it sounds like the site and its owners are at war. It also sounds like the owners are a little desperate to raise ad revenue, even at the cost of potentially annoying readers with auto-play ads with sound.\n\nGawker media\u2019s whole ethos seems to be about saying whatever the hell you want (which is one major reason Gawker is no more). It\u2019s hard to imagine they\u2019ll get on board with whatever edicts the owners start issuing. My recommendation to everyone watching this play out: Buy popcorn in bulk.", "description": "Stick to sports.", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Deadspin.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
