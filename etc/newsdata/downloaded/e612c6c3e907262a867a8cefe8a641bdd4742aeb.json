In late September, you\u2019ll remember, Tucker Carlson mocked Smith for standing up for his friend and colleague Judge Andrew Napolitano after the judge was called a \u201cfool\u201d by one of Carlson\u2019s guests. The network\u2019s lack of a vocal defense for Smith following the incident bothered him and the whole episode factored into his decision to leave, a person familiar with the matter told me.\n\nBUT: Contrary to rampant speculation, Smith was never given an \u201cultimatum\u201d to stop criticizing Carlson. Instead, I\u2019m told that Smith was reminded about the Fox\u2019s old adage regarding \u201cnot shooting inside the tent.\u201d Bottom line: \u201cIt is clear where the 2nd floor\u2019s allegiance lies,\u201d the person said, meaning that Fox execs care more about appeasing Carlson than Smith.\n\n\u2013> FWIW, Fox strongly denies that he was given a reminder. \u201cAt no time did anyone \u2014 including anyone in management or a third party \u2014 speak to Shepard Smith regarding that matter,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cAnything to the contrary is entirely false and wildly inaccurate.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Mailchi.Mp Cnn"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
