(Screenshot: Forza Horizon 4,Photo: Andrew P Collins)\n\nForza Horizon 4 is one of the best driving experiences you can have without getting off your couch. But it, like most video games, requires two hands to play. Luckily for those who are not so-equipped \u2014 like me, unfortunately, at the moment \u2014 Microsoft makes a special controller that can be configured for just about anybody and any body.\n\nThe Xbox Adaptive Controller is a remarkably versatile device. Centralised by a platform-like hub with two big buttons and a directional pad; it\u2019s also bristling with ports that can accept a bunch of different input devices. Joysticks, buttons, pedals, even mouth controls, and other very specific clickers can all be easily plugged in and mapped to Xbox controller button functions.\n\nPhoto: Andrew P Collins\n\nThe hub itself is wireless, just like a regular Xbox One controller, so you can use it from a couch or a wheelchair or wherever and sit far from the TV while keeping the wired controller accessories within reach.\n\nErgo: \u201c...a gamer can game with one hand and one foot, or one hand and their shoulder, or even one foot and their chin,\u201d as Microsoft Product Marketing guy James Shields explains in a surprisingly emotional promotional clip.\n\nAfter a bad off-road wipeout in real life relegated me to my apartment and rendered my left hand useless for many months of the past year, my colleagues were kind enough to send me one of these controllers.\n\nHere\u2019s how I dialled it in for driving around digital Scotland in Forza Horizon 4.\n\nPhysical Setup\n\nPhoto: Andrew P Collins\n\nMy gaming posture puts my arse on the couch, Adaptive Controller on the floor, and nunchuck accessory in my right hand while my left rests or runs occupational therapy exercises. (It\u2019s called multi-tasking.)\n\nHere\u2019s an important and odd aspect though: the nunchuck is actually plugged into the left port, but I turn the whole Adaptive Controller around so it\u2019s physically on the right. This is partially so the brake and throttle are where they\u2019d be on a car, but also so I can use the clicker buttons on the nunchuck to activate the left bumper button, which you need to enter races in-game in Horizon 4.\n\nI click the big buttons with my feet, using the left for brake and right for gas, and use my right thumb to steer. That\u2019s all I really interact with during gameplay.\n\nPhoto: Andrew P Collins\n\nThe Adaptive Controller also has a start button to pause, a select button to bring up the map, and a directional pad I use for changing the music, pulling the handbrake (extra realism since I have to reach down for it!) and cycling through menus. To get to any of those, I have to bend and stretch, but it\u2019s alright because they\u2019re not needed often.\n\nWith this configuration, I can be pretty competitive and usually win races with opponents set to the \u201cinexperienced\u201d difficulty. Though I have won on more challenging settings, I\u2019ve been playing racing games since the original NES was barely obsolete and I\u2019m confident in assessing that hand-and-foot gaming is a lot harder than using a traditional game controller. Point is: prepare for a steep learning curve if you\u2019re moving from a regular clicker to a unique special-needs setup like this.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m grateful that this option exists at all. But the Adaptive Controller doesn\u2019t come out of its box ready to play like this. You need to configure both the game and the controller itself to work for you.\n\nIn-Game Setup\n\nIn Forza Horizon 4 you can\u2019t map specific buttons to functions individually, but you can cycle through quite a few controller presets.\n\nFor use with the Adaptive Controller and nunchuck, particularly in the way I described above, I run with Default Layout 9:\n\nBasically, you need the A and B buttons for throttle and brake, LB for selecting things, RB for moving through menus, D-pad right for changing the radio station (they\u2019re all so good, you don\u2019t want to skip this) and D-pad down for e-brake for sweet, sweet snow drifts.\n\nDon\u2019t forget, if you turn the whole controller around as I do, the directional buttons will be reversed from the user\u2019s perspective. The stick for steering will not be backward, of course, as that\u2019d be impossible to drive with.\n\nThat\u2019s kind of the minimum controls you can get away with accessing to have a good time in Horizon 4.\n\nI haven\u2019t messed with the advanced adjustments yet, but you can if you want to fine-tune your controller\u2019s responsiveness.\n\nIn the difficulty settings, I left the mistake-erasing \u201crewind\u201d off originally but it does make races a lot easier to win. Otherwise, I\u2019ve found that the combination of traction control on but stability control off lets you have fun and slide around, but also makes it slightly easier to accelerate in snow and mud in, say, a 900 horsepower Lamborghini. Which is a thing that happens in this game.\n\nSoftware Setup\n\nThe Adaptive Controller has its own mapping program you can open like any other app from the Xbox home menu. I have mine programmed thusly:\n\nFor my configuration, to use in conjunction with Forza Horizon 4\u2019s Default Layout 9, and the controller backward, the important parts are to map: D-pad down to X, D-pad left to RB, D-pad up to Y, and I actually haven\u2019t messed with D-pad right but maybe there\u2019s another function you might want to add there.\n\nIf you were hoping to drive a manual-shift car, sorry, I haven\u2019t been able to crack that one for myself or my fellow one-handers. The in-game messaging is inaccessible too, so, if you\u2019ve messaged me and been mad I haven\u2019t replied, don\u2019t take it personally. I just can\u2019t reach the chat button.\n\nAlso, I have not successfully been able to do much in photo mode without a standard controller yet.\n\nBut pay special attention to which \u201cslot\u201d you save your setup to. If you save your mapping to slot 1, you have to physically set the controller to match slot 1 also. It\u2019s a little button on the controller with a corresponding light, but it\u2019s easy to forget about. That had me pretty frustrated for a good 20 minutes before I realised what the light on the controller was.\n\nHowever, in case that doesn\u2019t work for you, I also reached out to Microsoft and Turn 10 Studios, and they got back to me with their official recommendation for how to game this game with an Adaptive Controller:\n\nPlug the PDP One-Handed Joystick into the left stick port of the Xbox Adaptive Controller. The Joystick will be left stick.\n\nIn the Xbox Accessories App, create a custom remapping profile (recommend calling it something like \u201cForza Horizon 4 - 1 handed\u201d)\n\nIn that profile, remap X1 to LT and X2 to RT. This remaps the little joystick button to brake, bigger joystick button to accelerate.\n\nLeave the buttons on the Xbox Adaptive Controller \u2014 A, B, View, Menu \u2013 as they are. This allows you to rest your hand on the XAC and/or hit these buttons with your right hand as you hold the joystick in that same hand.\n\nPlug a standalone button into Y. It\u2019s a dramatic way to hit reverse while holding the PDP One-Handed Joystick, or you could put it under your foot.\n\nIf you want X or bumpers map to D-Pad Up, Down, Left.\n\nI\u2019ll point out that the \u201cofficial\u201d remap there requires another external button in addition to the controller and nunchuck. But, the team also forwarded how to play the game one-handed without buying any extra accessories at all:\n\n\u201cYou can also play \u2018Forza Motorsport 4\u2019 with one hand using a traditional Xbox Wireless Controller, using presets available in the game\u2019s \u201cController Options\u201d menu \u2013 these presets put essential controls (steering, gas and brake) all on the left side, or the right side depending on a player\u2019s preference.\u201d\n\nThe fact that this Adaptive Controller exists is a real boon for the gaming community, and I\u2019m excited to say that it\u2019s really brought me very genuine joy in a dark time of my life.\n\nIf you or somebody you know is physically barred from gaming, or driving, and hasn\u2019t heard about this I hope this blog gets them into Forza Horizon 4. If you\u2019re already using a setup like this and have tips for us one-handed video game drivers, I hope you\u2019ll share them in the comments.\n\nI\u2019m not sure where the best deal for the Xbox Adaptive Controller is, but here\u2019s the main listing in the Microsoft store, where you can also find a big quiver of accessories for it.", "description": "Forza Horizon 4 is one of the best driving experiences you can have without getting off your couch.
