Bugatti confirmed it only drove in one direction\n\nBugatti's record has now been cast into doubt, despite it being verified by the T\u00dcV, Germany\u2019s Technical Inspection Association, at the time\n\nThe car maker said this was a safety call, as decades of vehicles careering around the test track in a clockwise direction has modified the tarmac.\n\nIt said a run in the opposite direction would go against the grain of the surface, which could cause the tyres to overheat.\n\nWith very little in terms of run-off areas - and banked curves at the end of the straights - the hypercar brand says it was restricted by the limits of its own test facility.\n\nWhat that means, for the time being, is that Koenigsegg is still recognised by Guinness as holding the record road car speed of 277.87mph, set in an Agera RS in 2017.\n\nThe car maker said it couldn't use the VW test track in both directions due to safety concerns, as decades of vehicles careering around the test track in a clockwise direction has modified the tarmac\n\nA run in the opposite direction would go against the grain of the surface, which could cause the tyres to overheat, Bugatti said\n\nThe Guinness Book of World Records still lists the Koenigsegg Agera RS as the fastest road car on the planet, with a speed of 277.87mph set in 2017 over two runs in Nevada\n\nThat said, questions can also be raised about the authenticity of all speed records set by car makers, given that they can choose the location where the attempts are made.\n\nFor instance, Koenigsegg achieved its near-278mph run in Nevada at a higher altitude, meaning the air was thinner and therefore creates less drag.\n\nVW Group\u2019s 13-mile test track is just 50 metres above sea level. According to Bugatti's number crunching, the Chiron would have gone 15.5mph faster if the attempt took place at Nevada's altitude, meaning a speed of 320mph.\n\nOthers had questioned the legitimacy of Bugatti's claimed road car speed record as the vehicle used wasn't actually available to buy. However, Bugatti has confirmed a limited run of 'long-tail' models\n\nAndy Wallace set Bugatti's record speed of 304.77mph. Wallace is the firm's official test driver and also an accomplished racer who won the Le Mans 24 Hours in 1988\n\nVarious performance modifications were made to the Chiron for the speed run, including an extended exhaust system\n\nJust 30 versions of the record-breaking Bugatti Chiron Supersport 300+ will be made... and cost \u00a34.2m\n\nAs well as issues with the number of runs, Bugatti's speed record was also being questioned by many who have pointed out that the Chiron used was not a production model.\n\nHowever, Bugatti has since revealed that it will make 30 examples under the name Chiron Supersport 300+, with each one costing a cool \u00a34.2million after tax.\n\nIt will use the same eight-litre, quad-turbo W16 engine - producing a staggering 1,578bhp - and seven-speed dual-clutch gearbox and four-wheel drive system.\n\nThe limited edition car will also have the extended carbon bodywork and exhaust system.\n\nThis is the Bugatti Chiron Supersport 300+. It's a \u00a34.2million version of the standard hypercar with the extended carbon bodywork and upgraded exhaust system from the record-smashing example\n\nJust 30 examples will be made, Bugatti has confirmed. However, they won't be a direct like-for-like with the record-setting vehicle\n\nThe interior will be more lavish and have a passenger seat and the option for no roll cage. It also loses the laser-guide ride-height system and will have an electronic speed limiter\n\nWhat won't be retained from the adapted Chiron used for the record-breaking run is the laser-guided ride-adjusting system, which helped keep the car as low to the ground as possible during the high-speed attempt.\n\nThere will also be no roll cage in the production car, and Bugatti has handily provided a passenger seat for the road-going model, too.\n\nThe car maker also confirmed that the 30 examples will be fitted with an electronic speed limiter, just in case any of the brave buyers decide to test its triple-ton credentials.", "description": "Bugatti's problem is that the 304.77mph speed measured at the Volkswagen Group's test circuit at Ehra-Lessien in Germany on 2 August was only set driving in one direction and not two.", "authors": ["Rob Hull For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
