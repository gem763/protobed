The contracts do not necessarily predict moves after the opening bell.\n\nEarly signs suggested that there was a \"material\" effect on oil supply as a result of the attack and \"initial hopes of restoring production levels quickly have been put in doubt,\" said Yerlan Syzdykov, the head of emerging markets at Amundi, in a note. \"It seems that we could only count on a limited restoration within the next few weeks and full restoration could take up to several months.\"\n\nThe Stoxx Europe 600 slipped 0.2% in midday trade after a downbeat session in Asia.\n\nIn China, the Shanghai Composite dropped 1.7% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 1.2% as the People's Bank of China remained restrained in its response to a recent spate of weak economic data.\n\nThe central bank on Tuesday disappointed economists who had hoped it would move to effectively lower interest rates, though it did take steps to inject 200 billion yuan ($28.3 billion) into the banking system.\n\n\"Because there was an injection of cash people were looking at the PBOC closely. There was some surprise that there wasn't a cut now. In recent history, they tend to keep pace with the Fed, but they could still do that in the coming days,\" said Freya Beamish, chief Asia economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.\n\nChina's central bank officials will be more focused on trade talks with the U.S. in October than on a cut in rates, Ms. Beamish said.\n\nDespite the gloom, Japan's Nikkei edged up 0.1% as President Trump moved ahead with a trade pact with the country on areas such as digital technology and agriculture. The step should see some tariffs on Japanese imports to the U.S. lowered.\n\nEurope, however, was braced for fresh tariffs from Washington, over a long-running battle over aircraft maker subsidies.\n\nGold, the traditional haven, was down 0.4% after climbing Monday amid the rising geopolitical tensions.\n\nThe Federal Reserve later Tuesday will release August's industrial production figures, an important measure of how U.S. manufacturing has held up amid a slowdown in global trade. Factory output fell 0.4% in July from the previous month.\n\nMarket expectations were set for another quarter percentage point interest-rate cut from the Fed on Wednesday, but there will also be scrutiny of how recent developments with Saudi Arabia, and on trade with China, might influence future policy. Mr. Trump on Monday called for a rate cut after the attacks in Saudi Arabia.\n\nIn currencies, the British pound may face another day of volatility as the U.K's Supreme Court examines the legal basis for Prime Minister Boris Johnson's decision to suspend Parliament amid Brexit tensions. The pound was recently down 0.3% against the U.S. dollar.\n\nThe U.S. 10-year Treasury yield fell to 1.834%, from 1.843% Monday. Bond yields fall as prices rise.\n\nWrite to Anna Isaac at anna.isaac@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 17, 2019 06:35 ET (10:35 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
