As a result, oil prices have jumped.\n\nIt sounds scary for oil and stock investors, but for the time being, the chart tells a different story. All investors, not just oil investors, ought to pay attention to this chart.\n\nChart\n\nPlease click here for an annotated chart of oil futures CLV19, -1.53%.\n\nNote the following:\n\n\u2022 From the chart, note the down-sloping trendline.\n\n\u2022 Oil gapped open.\n\n\u2022 Oil has, as of this writing, broken above the trendline.\n\n\u2022 Note from the chart that oil has not touched the resistance level.\n\n\u2022 Even before the attack on Saudi oil fields, oil was tracing higher lows, as shown on the chart.\n\nAsk Arora: Nigam Arora answers your questions about investing in stocks, ETFs, bonds, gold and silver, oil and currencies. Have a question? Send it to Nigam Arora.\n\nWhat does it all mean?\n\nThe fact that oil did not break above the resistance shown on the chart indicates the following:\n\n\u2022 President Trump would cushion the oil price increase by releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, if needed.\n\n\u2022 Other countries also have oil reserves that may be used to cushion a price rise.\n\n\u2022 Saudi Arabia has a substantial stockpile of oil that it can use to keep the market supplied with oil.\n\n\u2022 Other OPEC countries and Russia can pump more oil.\n\n\u2022 It is relatively easy to increase production of oil in the United States.\n\n\u2022 In spite of sanctions against Iranian oil, Asian countries may end up buying more of it.\n\n\u2022 The world economy is slowing. The latest data from China shows that industrial production is at its lowest point in 17 years.\n\n\u2022 A slowing world economy uses less oil.\n\n\u2022 Since the U.S. is self-sufficient in energy, there should not be much impact on the U.S. economy.\n\n\u2022 Saudi Arabia is claiming that it will bring back about one-third of the production rather quickly.\n\nConcerns\n\nThe situation should calm down without much of an impact on investors, unless scenarios similar to the following occur:\n\n\u2022 Similar attacks on oil production not only in Saudi Arabia, but elsewhere in the Middle East, happen again and again.\n\n\u2022 The U.S., along with its allies, attacks Iranian oil fields and installations.\n\n\u2022 Iran attempts and succeeds in closing the Strait of Hormuz. The Strait of Hormuz is a choke point in oil shipments.\n\nInvesting and trading\n\nThe following are of interest to investors and traders:\n\n\u2022 Oil ETFs exhibit tracking errors. Having said that, ETF USO, +12.15% is of significant interest. For very short-term trades, leveraged ETFs such as UWT, +34.39%, DWT, -39.75%, OILU, +34.54% and OILD, -39.67% are of interest.\n\n\u2022 Regarding oil equities, ETFs XLE, +3.36%, XOP, +10.80% and OIH, +8.59% are of interest.\n\n\u2022 Among large-cap oil stocks, Exxon Mobil XOM, +1.50%, Chevron CVX, +2.16% and Royal Dutch Shell RDS.B, +1.99% are of interest.\n\n\u2022 Traders looking for larger movements may look at Comstock Resources CRK, +5.77%, Denbury Resources DNR, +27.87% and Whiting Petroleum WLL, +48.94%.\n\n\u2022 Of significant interest are oil-service stocks such as Halliburton HAL, +10.95% and Schlumberger SLB, +5.30%.\n\n\u2022 Cruise lines such as Carnival CCL, -3.22% and Royal Caribbean Cruises RCL, -0.78% may be negatively affected.\n\n\u2022 Airlines such as United Airlines UAL, -2.84%, Delta Air Lines DAL, -1.57% and American Airlines AAL, -7.28% may also suffer in the short term.\n\n\u2022 Refiners such as Valero Energy VLO, -3.67% may benefit.\n\n\u2022 India and China may be adversely affected because they are crude importers. Indian ETFs of interest are EPI, -2.52% and INDA, -2.38%. Chinese ETFs of interest are ASHR, -1.45% and FXI, -1.05%.\n\n\u2022 Russian ETF RSX, +1.82% may benefit.\n\nHistorically, such incidents tend to de-escalate and early moves in stocks and ETFs reverse in due course. This represents mostly trading opportunities and not necessarily long-term investing opportunities.\n\nDisclosure: Subscribers to The Arora Report may have positions in the securities mentioned in this article or may take positions at any time.
