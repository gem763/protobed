There were 4,473 total lynchings in the country between 1882-1968, the majority of those victims being black people, according to the NAACP.\n\nMr Trump\u2019s use of the term caused immediate backlash on Capitol Hill.\n\nJames Clyburn, a South Carolina Democrat and the House Majority Whip, said that \u2013 as a black man living in the south, where lynchings have been a historic issue \u2013 he was personally offended by the president\u2019s remarks.\n\n\u201cThat is one word no president ought to apply to himself,\u201d Mr Clyburn said in an interview with CNN.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if we\u2019ve seen anything quite like this,\u201d he added. \u201cAndrew Jackson would never describe what was happening to him this way.\u201d\n\nSo some day, if a Democrat becomes President and the Republicans win the House, even by a tiny margin, they can impeach the President, without due process or fairness or any legal rights. All Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here \u2013 a lynching. But we will WIN! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 22, 2019\n\nOthers decried Mr Trump\u2019s statement as a \u201cgross misappropriation\u201d of the term.\n\nKristen Clarke, the president of the national Lawyer\u2019s Committee for Civil Rights under Law, described lynchings in a tweet responding to Mr Trump as \u201ccrimes against humanity and an ugly part of our nation\u2019s history of racial violence and brutality.\u201d\n\nThe controversial tweet came as House investigators met with key subjects in the impeachment inquiry launched over an alleged abuse of power involving the president\u2019s dealings with Ukraine.\n\nNumerous diplomats have testified behind closed doors on Capitol Hill in recent days over their reported concerns about Mr Trump\u2019s requests for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to launch an investigation into one of his 2020 political rivals, Joe Biden.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry was launched late last month after a member of the US intelligence community filed a whistleblower complaint alleging the Trump administration had withheld military financial aid to Ukraine ahead of the president\u2019s phone call with Mr Zelensky, in which he urged the Ukrainian president to probe the former vice president and his son, Hunter Biden, who worked on the board of a Ukrainian energy firm while his father served in the White House. There has been no evidence of illegal wrongdoing on either part of the Bidens.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, William Taylor was scheduled to speak with Congress about text messages the retired career civil servant wrote when he ran the US Embassy in Ukraine under Mr Trump, in which he wrote to other officials: \u201cI think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d", "description": "Donald Trump has compared the impeachment process against him to being lynched in an incendiary tweet that sparked swift outcry on Tuesday morning.\u201cSo some day, if a Democrat becomes President and the Republicans win the House, even by a tiny margin, they can impeach the President, without due process", "authors": ["Chris Riotta"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/xJREgRzeF7ifbcddDbPmaQ--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/dc7b1b7b15ffb87777b1e8f4fd475099", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
