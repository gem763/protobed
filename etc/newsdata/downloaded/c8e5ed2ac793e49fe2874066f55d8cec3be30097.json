After only three days, there was nothing left of the massive body, and the many crocodiles had also disappeared. This photo originates from the Luangwa River, a tributary of the Zambesi River. The title results from my attempt to count the crocodiles in this section of the picture. I did not come up with an exact number, but in any case there are more than 100 individuals.\n\nPhotograph: Ignacio Medem Seghers/2019 GDT European wildlife photographer of the year", "description": "The Society of German Nature Photographers has chosen its winners and runners-up", "authors": ["Photograph", "Eduardo Blanco Mendizabal Gdt European Wildlife Photographer Of The Year", "Dr Siegmar Bergfeld Gdt European Wildlife Photographer Of The Year", "Espen Bergersen Gdt European Wildlife Photographer Of The Year", "Ingo Arndt Gdt European Wildlife Photographer Of The Year", "Ann Toon Gdt European Wildlife Photographer Of The Year", "Marco Gaiotti Gdt European Wildlife Photographer Of The Year", "Ignacio Medem Seghers Gdt European Wildlife Photographer Of The Year", "Svetlana Ivanenko Gdt European Wildlife Photographer Of The Year", "Dorin Bofan Gdt European Wildlife Photographer Of The Year"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4bb19ca0cd1d10a4f3448cbfabd9027871c7b48b/0_117_2897_1739/master/2897.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ac3b15e17f9d04d6d96fee1acdc792b2", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
