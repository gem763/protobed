And the uncomfortable answer is it feels grisly, grounded and, actually, kind of great. Of all the philosophical questions around the subject Naughty Dog are hoping their game will provoke, perhaps why something so plainly wrong can feel so paradoxically right is the most pertinent one of all.\n\nOstensibly combat in The Last of Us 2 is more of the same from the first game but it\u2019s at once entirely familiar and completely different. Stepping into Ellie\u2019s sneakers as she searches a suburb of Seattle for her friend Tommy, who has been captured by local militia group the Washington Liberation Front, offers more than a mere costume change. She\u2019s lithe and lively, able to squeeze through small gaps in the brickwork, drop down to a prone position in the long grass, dodge melee attacks and, crucially, able to jump. The introduction of verticality in particular proves transformative, taking encounters to new levels in all senses of the word.\n\nThe game\u2019s creative director, Neil Druckmann, explains that changing the player character to Ellie forced Naughty Dog to rethink their combat mechanics from the ground up.", "description": "Much has been written about the violence in The Last of Us Part 2, about how it looks and how it sounds, but only now do we know how it feels.", "authors": ["Dan Silver", "Tom Hoggins"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/gaming/2019/09/26/TLOUPII_DEMO_SCREEN_04-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqNJjoeBT78QIaYdkJdEY4CnGTJFJS74MYhNY6w3GNbO8.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
