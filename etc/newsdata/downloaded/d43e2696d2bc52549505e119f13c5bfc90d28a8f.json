Sonic the Hedgehog.\n\nOne of the instruments onboard was developed in Japan by Tohoku University, who wanted Sonic as the mascot for one of the mission\u2019s principal tests \u2014 a Radio & Plasma Wave Investigation, or RPWI \u2014 and got Sega\u2019s blessing.\n\nI\u2019m going to assume that this test involves some kind of probe that wiggles, otherwise that logo is going to take some explaining.\n\nThe Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer, or JUICE, is scheduled to arrive at Jupiter in 2029, where it will perform tests on three of the planet\u2019s moons \u2014 Ganymede, Callisto and Europa \u2014 to see if any of them are habitable, since they\u2019re believed to each contain large bodies of water.\n\nOnce JUICE is out of fuel, it\u2019s designed to \u201cdeorbit\u201d and crash into the surface of Ganymede in 2034.", "description": "In June 2022, a rocket will launch carrying the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer, a spacecraft made by the European Space Agency and Airbus.
