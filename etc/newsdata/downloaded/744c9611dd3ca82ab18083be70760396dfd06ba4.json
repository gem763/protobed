One by one, Sophie McCann lists the degradations of life for refugees detained on Lesbos, the Greek island on the frontline of a new surge of asylum seekers desperate to reach Europe.\n\nMcCann, a British advocacy manager with M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, like other aid workers, is now raising the alarm: at least 24,000 men, women and children trapped in vastly overcrowded Aegean island camps are being subjected to conditions so harrowing they bear all the hallmarks of humanitarian catastrophe. Four years after the greatest migration crisis in modern times, there are fears history is repeating itself.\n\n\u201cThe level of human suffering is just indescribable,\u201d says McCann, adding that incidents of self-harm, even among toddlers, have risen sharply. \u201cI struggle to find the right words because none can convey the sheer misery and inhumanity of a situation that in Europe is frankly unbelievable.\u201d\n\nGreece sets out emergency plans to tackle surge of migrant arrivals Read more\n\nThe drama unfolding on Europe\u2019s south-eastern periphery follows the abrupt rise in numbers making the dangerous sea crossing from Turkey.\n\nWith a brazenness unseen since the EU struck a controversial accord with Ankara to stem flows in 2016, smugglers are again landing boatloads of would-be asylum seekers on the beaches of Lesbos, Samos, Kos, Leros and Chios.\n\nIn July and August more than 13,000 people landed on Greek shores, more than half of all sea arrivals to the country in 2019. With the uptick continuing into September, the surge has sparked fears that Europe is on the verge of a new refugee crisis \u2013 despite numbers still being a fraction of those in 2016 when as many as 2,000 people a day were reportedly disembarking from boats.\n\nAt least a third of the newcomers are unaccompanied minors, according to the UN refugee agency. \u201cIt has happened so quickly, aid organisations feel overwhelmed,\u201d said Sofia Malmqvist at the Athens branch of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.\n\n\u201cThe situation is particularly acute on the islands. We are deeply concerned. There are a lot of children. What we are seeing is authorities [pursuing] short-term solutions such as moving some to the mainland and into tents, but what is going to happen in the winter?\u201d\n\nThe influx comes amid mounting anti-refugee sentiment in Turkey on the back of the country\u2019s economic woes and growing unemployment. In recent weeks the president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, has repeatedly warned that his government will be forced to \u201copen the gates\u201d if the EU fails to deliver \u20ac6bn in promised funds \u2013 remuneration set out in the landmark accord \u2013 and Ankara is prevented from moving ahead with plans to create a safe zone in northern Syria where refugees could be relocated.\n\nTurkey currently hosts close to 4 million displaced Syrians with the prospect of that number escalating if yet more flee across the border from Idlib, the rebel stronghold that has become the focus of a renewed offensive by the regime of Bashar al-Assad and Damascus\u2019 backers in Moscow.\n\nAs a result of the summer rise, Greece has overtaken Italy and Spain as the European Union\u2019s busiest entry point for illegal migration.\n\nIn Athens, NGOs attribute the increase to the Turkish coastguard deliberately relaxing patrols. EU diplomats speak of Erdo\u011fan\u2019s ability to hold the bloc to ransom by \u201copening and closing the faucet\u201d.\n\nAmid fears of a populist backlash, Germany, which took in more Syrian refugees than any other EU member state in 2015, has announced it is watching the illegal sea crossings with mounting concern.\n\nLike Greece\u2019s new centre-right government, Berlin sees a solution in greater numbers of asylum seekers being sent back to Turkey. The latest arrivals topped the agenda when Greece\u2019s foreign minister, Nikos Dendias, held talks in Berlin on Monday in which it was stressed it was vital that Ankara stick with the pact it has agreed with the EU.\n\nIn almost four years since the EU-Turkey accord was reached, barely 1,000 have been returned \u2013 a reflection of the human rights concerns voiced by Athens\u2019 former leftist administration in deporting migrants back to Turkey. Under the agreement refugees have to process asylum claims on \u201centry point\u201d islands before being allowed to move on.\n\nIn recent weeks Greek authorities have stepped up emergency evacuations, transferring some 1,800 people deemed to be vulnerable to camps on the mainland.\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d says McCann, \u201cthese cycles of emergency decongestion won\u2019t solve the underlining problems. This is a policy-driven crisis where the EU has sought to contain and externalise the problem [of migration] to the Greek isles. The EU-Turkey deal was supposed to be a \u2018temporary and extraordinary measure\u2019 to reduce flows and open safe legal alternatives to smugglers. Instead it has created camps where people are robbed of their dignity and forced to live in horrendous conditions.\u201d\n\nShe said that in July and August, 73 children were referred to MSF\u2019s paediatric mental health teams in Lesbos: three had attempted to kill themselves and 17 had self-harmed.\n\nOn all Aegean islands most affected by the influx, infrastructure is now at breaking point.\n\n'We have found hell': drawings reveal children's trauma at Lesbos camp | Lorenzo Tondo Read more\n\nMoria, the main reception centre in Lesbos, was so overcrowded last week there was no space to \u201ceven install more chemical toilets\u201d, the camp\u2019s exasperated governor, Yannis Balbakakis, lamented after unexpectedly announcing he was resigning from the post.\n\nThe camp is currently home to 10,400 people although it was designed to host 3,000.\n\nThe reception centre in Samos is even worse, \u201crunning seven times above capacity\u201d, noted Stella Nanou, the UN refugee agency\u2019s spokeswoman in Athens.\n\n\u201cThe increase in recent sea arrivals has put additional strain on already overcrowded facilities on the islands where conditions remain dire,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWith very few other official or legal pathways out of Greece the continued arrival of asylum seekers would entail the need for an ever-expanding reception capacity which is simply unsustainable. A longer-term plan is needed from the Greek authorities, with the support of the EU to define a [burden sharing] strategy to accommodate asylum seekers and refugees.\u201d", "description": "At least 24,000 people are trapped in vastly overcrowded Aegean island camps in squalid conditions", "authors": ["Helena Smith"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5906671007e7d9efe7992ec4e88b1435c5a53804/0_361_5412_3247/master/5412.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=96094fcae17066af08a0ac365d5c0b2a", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
