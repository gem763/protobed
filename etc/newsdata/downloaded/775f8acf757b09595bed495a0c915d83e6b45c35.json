At the same time, he was a bully -- as former Miramax president Mark Gill puts it, \"An overlord who lived by the most vicious methods possible in order to instill fear.\"\n\nAs awful as those qualities sound, the film suggests the volcanic temper and ashtray-throwing outbursts actually might have helped obscure what subordinates recognized about behavior he sought to keep hidden. As Miramax employees note, Weinstein was a mass of contradictions -- someone who could turn on the charm to woo Hollywood talent, awards voters and the media.\n\nPerhaps foremost, \"Untouchable\" provides the historical foundation to understand not only how Weinstein could have gotten away with what he allegedly did for so long, but how the entertainment industry's culture and unequal power structure silenced those who might speak out. (Weinstein and his attorneys have denied \"any allegations of non-consensual sex\" and he pleaded not guilty this week to new charges of predatory sexual assault in Manhattan criminal court.)\n\nFrom that perspective, \"Untouchable\" extends beyond the particulars of Weinstein's story to broader consideration of the environment that allowed abuses to go unchecked.\n\nRead More", "description": "'Untouchable' review: BBC documentary digs into roots of Harvey Weinstein story, airing in the U.S. on Hulu.", "authors": ["Brian Lowry"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190827084638-untouchable-harvey-weinstein-super-tease.jpg"}
