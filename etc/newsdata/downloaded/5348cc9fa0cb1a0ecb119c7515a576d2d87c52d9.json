The benchmark maturity staged its biggest weekly climb since July 12.\n\nThe 2-year note rate TMUBMUSD02Y, +1.33% dropped 1.6 basis points to 1.528%, paring its weeklong rise to 2 basis points. The 30-year bond yield TMUBMUSD30Y, -1.04% fell 3.9 basis points to 2.021%, paring its weeklong rise to 5.3 basis points.\n\nBond prices move in the opposite direction of yields.\n\nWhat\u2019s driving Treasurys?\n\nBond yields came off their intraday highs after a weaker-than-expected jobs report undercut the solid economic data from private-sector employers and the services industry on Thursday, which had assuaged some fears that the U.S. economy was on the brink of slipping into a recession.\n\nThe U.S. economy added 130,000 jobs in August, down from 164,000 in the previous month. Analysts polled by MarketWatch had forecast the U.S. to gain 170,000 jobs.\n\nStill, economists pointed to other positives in the employment report. Average hourly earnings rose 0.4%, exceeding the consensus estimate for an 0.3% increase. Average hours worked each week rose by 0.1 to 34.4 hours.\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, speaking at a conference in Zurich, said the U.S. economy was in a good place, appearing to push back against traders hopes for a rate cut yet this month. He pointed to the August jobs report to underline the central bank\u2019s forecasts for a continued economic expansion.\n\nStill, market expectations are for the U.S. central bank to cut rates by a quarter of a percentage point at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting on Sept. 18.\n\nEarlier in the week, senior Fed officials debated the need for an extended easing cycle given the U.S. economy\u2019s resilience in the face of uncertainty of the trade war. A media blackout period, before the central bank\u2019s decision, starts next week for Fed officials.\n\nRead: Powell will get the last word on interest rates after Friday\u2019s job report\n\nWhat did market participants\u2019 say?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still a decent number. The jobs gains are in line with the view that the U.S. economy is moving to a 2% growth rate from a 3% growth rate,\u201d said Lindsay Bernum, global macro analyst at Smith Capital Investors, in an interview with MarketWatch.\n\nShe said there were plenty of sources of economic optimism within the nonfarm-payrolls report, including the rising wage increases and the rise in average hours worked.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re this far into an expansionary period, you can see that we have a lot more mini cycles now. The moves are more extreme, and the day to day volatility goes up,\u201d said Bernum.\n\n\u201cThe headlines jobs number missed, but most people\u2019s interpretations of the report is mostly positive. The participation rate continued to improve. It shows we\u2019re still continuing to draw people into the labor market,\u201d Peter Cramer, senior portfolio manager at SLC Management, told MarketWatch.\n\nWhat else is on investors\u2019 radar?\n\nIn Asia, the People\u2019s Bank of China announced it would cut the level that banks are required to hold as bank reserves in proportion to deposits by half a percentage point in a bid to boost lending.\n\nBank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda said long-end rates had fallen too far. His remarks sparked selling Japanese government bonds with extended maturities.\n\nThe 30-year Japanese government bond yield TMBMKJP-30Y, +50.96% climbed 7.3 basis points to 0.209%.", "description": "Treasury yields end higher for the week, despite a drop on Friday after the August nonfarm-payrolls report showed the U.S. economy gaining fewer jobs than...", "authors": ["Sunny Oh"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
