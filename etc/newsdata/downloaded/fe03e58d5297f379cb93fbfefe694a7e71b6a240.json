REUTERS/Feisal Omar\n\nNAIROBI (Reuters) - Somalia\u2019s economy is forecast to grow 2.9% this year from 2.8% last year, but security risks and vulnerability to climate shocks could cloud the outlook, the International Monetary Fund said.\n\nThe Horn of Africa country has experienced conflict since 1991, when clan warlords overthrew President Siad Barre and then turned on each other. Over the past decade it has been hit by famine and sporadic terror attacks by al Qaeda-linked militant group al Shabaab.\n\n\u201cEconomic growth is projected to remain broadly stable at 2.9% in 2019.
