I just come across as robotic. This is one of the things that\u2026 I\u2019m growing up, I need to get better at, in running this company.\u201d Zuckerberg added that he has been in the public eye since he was 19 years old and has learned that people say \u201clots of false things about you.\u201d\n\nDuring the interview, Zuckerberg discussed Facebook\u2019s impact on the 2016 election stating: \u201cWe were looking for more traditional threats like hacking, but we weren\u2019t looking for these kinds of co-ordinated information campaigns that now we\u2019re aware of.\u201d\n\nDiscussing Facebook\u2019s decision to allow political ads on its platform that may contain misinformation, Holt asked Zuckerberg if he was giving politicians a \u201cgreen light\u201d to lie. Zuckerberg responded: \u201cNo. Look \u2013 I believe that it is important for people to be able to hear and see what politicians are saying; that speech will be heavily scrutinized by other journalists; by other people.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg added: \u201cI believe that it\u2019s important to give people a voice, and I think ads can be an important part of a voice, especially if you\u2019re a challenger candidate, or a local candidate who might not otherwise be convened by the media. Removing political ads favors incumbents and whoever the media chooses to cover.\u201d\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
