On the trading floor, we used to say that a stock can get too expensive to buy, but never too cheap to sell.\n\nBe that as it may, a short trade is terrifying when it goes against you. That\u2019s especially true in a classic short squeeze, when everyone who has bet against the stock is trying to buy it back at the same time. That can cause the stock to quickly shoot up in price\u2014beyond what fundamentals would suggest. Theoretically, a short seller\u2019s losses are potentially infinite. A stock that investors own can only go to zero.\n\nWe bring this up because a lot of great short trades suddenly don\u2019t look so great right now. This past week\u2019s reversal of some of the market\u2019s most popular themes saw many of the biggest losers become big winners. And many of them were also popular shorts. Newell Brands (ticker: NWL), a popular stock to bet against with 10.5% of its float shorted, was down 7.2% in 2019 before gaining 7.1% this past week.\n\nAnd though some of the moves have been large, they could get even larger, writes J.P. Morgan strategist Shawn Quigg, if short sellers need to buy back their borrowed shares to cover mounting losses.\n\n\u201cWe find this rotation particularly pronounced in those heavily shorted value stocks where performance anxiety may now be driving forced short covering,\u201d Quigg explains. He recommends buying call options on United Airlines Holdings (UAL), CenturyLink (CTL), and Newell Brands to play the potential short squeeze.\n\nWe feel more comfortable when these trades match our fundamental views, and that happens to be the case with United. Its stock has been range bound for much of the past year, as investors fretted about its ability to weather the impact of higher oil prices and potentially slowing growth. More recently, United has had to deal with the side effects from the grounding of Boeing \u2019s (BA) 737 MAX jet\u2014and worries about overcapacity once the airplane flies again.\n\nBernstein analyst David Vernon argues that the market is \u201ctoo negative\u201d about the 737 and is missing potential catalysts for United stock. Those include continued expansion of \u201cpremium plus\u201d seating on its airplanes, better credit-card economics, and the company\u2019s spring investor day.\n\nMore than that, United stock is just too cheap, Vernon says. The company has a market value of about $23.6 billion after rising 5.9%, to $91.35, this past week, yet the company\u2019s assets are worth $25.7 billion once net debt is subtracted, the biggest discount among the four major carriers. \u201cUnited stands out as an overly discounted carrier, given its improved ability to generate a return closer to industry leaders,\u201d Vernon writes. His has a $107 price target on United stock, implying a 17% gain.\n\nThat\u2019s one heck of short squeeze.\n\nWrite to Ben Levisohn at Ben.Levisohn@barrons.com", "description": "With the market\u2019s sudden lurch toward value stocks, some big names with lots of short interest could see a nice bump.
