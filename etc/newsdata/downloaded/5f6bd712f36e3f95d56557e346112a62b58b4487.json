USA TODAY\n\nDon't let the fancy attire and the Gilded Age setting fool you, there is nasty business afoot in \"The Current War.\"\n\nIt's a power struggle, both literal and societal, with Benedict Cumberbatch as inventor Thomas Edison on one side, Michael Shannon as industrialist George Westinghouse on the other, Nicholas Hoult as eccentric visionary Nikola Tesla in the middle and the future of electricity in America hanging in the balance.\n\nThe film (in theaters Friday) is a tale of innovation advanced via moral compromise. There are dead animals, corporate espionage, even the invention of the electric chair all deployed in the battle to determine whether Edison's direct current or Westinghouse's alternating current would light up the nation.\n\nHoliday movie preview: 15 movies you absolutely must see this holiday season, from 'Star Wars' to 'Frozen 2'\n\n\"The Imitation Game\" star Benedict Cumberbatch returns to period drama with \"The Current War,\" playing celebrity inventor Thomas Edison. (Photo: 101 STUDIOS)\n\nIt's a story rife with tragedy and squandered potential.\n\n\"What could have been if (Edison) and Westinghouse and Tesla had all combined forces?\" Cumberbatch asks. \"It would have been a different world.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe create the war,\" Shannon adds. \"It\u2019s not inevitable. It\u2019s our creation and it\u2019s not necessary. ... You can make a lot more progress by cooperating and being unified. But human beings have a remarkable propensity to make everything extraordinarily more difficult than it needs to be. It seems to be our calling card.\u201d\n\nReview: Benedict Cumberbatch's long-shelved Thomas Edison movie is as dull as it sounds\n\nOnscreen rivals Michael Shannon (as George Westinghouse) and Benedict Cumberbatch (playing Thomas Edison) attend the New York premiere of \"The Current War: Director's Cut\" on Oct. 21, 2019. (Photo: Roy Rochlin, Getty Images)\n\nThere's a moral to be learned from the Edison vs. Westinghouse battle, Cumberbatch notes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll probably just be demolished on Twitter for saying it, but the tech giants of now, instead of combating, imagine what the combined resources of all of them would be if they tackled a single issue, head-on through their combined resources,\" he says. \"I mean, that could be really game-changing.\u201d\n\n\"The Current War\" initially played the Toronto International Film Festival in 2017. It's arriving in theaters this fall in its director's cut format, which includes several new scenes but shorter than the previous version. The film also boasts new visual effects and a new score.\n\nDirector Alfonso Gomez\u2010Rejon, a two-time Emmy nominee who had previously helmed 2015's \"Me and Earl and the Dying Girl,\" brings the 1800s saga to life with a bracingly modern sensibility and lightning bolt energy.\n\n\u201cThis was a movie about the future, it\u2019s not about the past,\" says Gomez-Rejon. \"It was a time that itself was rich with new ideas, innovations, and these were the great disruptors, right? So why make a film that\u2019s a stodgy, static, old-fashioned period piece when I want to give a sense of what that time might have felt like? It is a contemporary movie. It\u2019s a very relevant movie today.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2019/10/25/benedict-cumberbatch-michael-shannon-clash-in-the-current-war/4091671002/", "description": "Benedict Cumberbatch and Michael Shannon take on Thomas Edison, George Westinghouse and one epic electrical battle in 'The Current War.'", "authors": ["Alex Biese", "Published A.M.
