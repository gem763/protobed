The Ivorian had made a slow start since joining from Lille in the summer and is yet to score from open play, but it felt like an arrival for the club-record signing.\n\nMiracle of Burnley: inside the Premier League\u2019s most unlikely success story Read more\n\n\u201cOf course [I knew it would be harder],\u201d P\u00e9p\u00e9 said of his first few months in north London. \u201cIt is a league totally different to Ligue 1, with a different intensity. For me, I had to adapt quickly because expectations were high. Unfortunately that is not what I did at the beginning but the players have supported [me]. I keep working hard to perform well and adapt to the Premier League.\u201d\n\nHe admitted scoring goals \u201cis good for the confidence\u201d and reiterated that Unai Emery, who has been acutely aware of the need to get P\u00e9p\u00e9 up to speed, has always backed him. \u201cEven if I hadn\u2019t been decisive for a while, I always had the manager\u2019s trust. It is always important to have the manager\u2019s faith.\u201d\n\nP\u00e9p\u00e9 spent much of the summer with Ivory Coast, whose Africa Cup of Nations campaign extended to mid-July. One reason for the slow start after his \u00a372m transfer is likely to be the truncated preparation he had for Arsenal\u2019s season.\n\n\u201cI am not at my best physically because I didn\u2019t have a proper pre-season like the others,\u201d he said. \u201cI was at the Africa Cup of Nations. I started little by little and the manager knew about it. I am trying to work hard to be stronger physically to perform well.\u201d The key to a successful integration, he believes, is \u201cto have good people around you\u201d, especially with his English skills remaining a work in progress.\n\n\u201cI have my family here with me so I could be good mentally, especially when things are not going well,\u201d he said through an interpreter. \u201cI rely a lot on them. For me, it was always going to be difficult to come here in the unknown, with a different language. So have my family with me is important.\u201d", "description": "Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9 accepts he has had difficulties adapting to life at Arsenal but hopes his goals against Vit\u00f3ria will give him the confidence to thrive", "authors": ["Nick Ames"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff0319d8e3216ad346bc1a4cc1205dedf9287347/197_91_3692_2216/master/3692.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7609c5fd931878f430ee47efa6e3032b", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
