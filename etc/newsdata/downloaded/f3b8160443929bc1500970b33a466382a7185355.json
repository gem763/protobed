This was a desperately disjointed performance from Wales.\n\nThey won with a bonus-point, and will now face France in the quarter-finals next Sunday in Oita, as Nicky Smith, Josh Adams, Tomos Williams and Gareth Davies scored to add to a penalty try and eight points from Leigh Halfpenny, who did well, but largely Wales were poor.\n\nLots of that was because Uruguay forced them into errors. Los Teros terrorised Wales at the breakdown, defended admirably and took a try from German Kessler as they ended their best ever World Cup well.\n\nJosh Adams scored his team's second try as Wales beat Uruguay in Kumamoto\n\nThe hope is that they are handed more big matches before the French World Cup of 2023 - and then we might see more shocks like their Fiji win.\n\nWales move on, but whether large numbers of this team will play again at the tournament remains to be seen.\n\nScrappy, sloppy and seriously slapdash, Wales\u2019 first half was really poor against the pumped up Uruguayans.\n\nLos Teros only trailed by one point at the break as the Welsh could not find ways of breaking them down.\n\nGatland\u2019s guys did have three tries disallowed - when Aaron Shingler was in touch and when Hadleigh Parkes passed forward to Hallam Amos - but they also lacked a clinical touch despite enjoying 72 per cent of the first-half possession.\n\nHallam Amos scored two tries, both of which were disallowed for forward passes\n\nUruguay who finish bottom of Pool D produced a competitive display against the leaders\n\nAaron Wainwright dropped over the line, Rhys Patchell dropped easy passes and Owen Watkin and Dillon Lewis threw balls to no one in the first half.\n\nSmith did score his first Test try in his 34th international, though, bashing over from close range.\n\nHowever Uruguay kept close with a strong defence and two penalties from fly-half Felipe Berchesi.\n\nThey were so happy that Wales kicked out to end the half that captain Juan Gaminara yelled in celebration right in Aled Davies\u2019 face - and when he ran down the tunnel still screaming his delight Ross Moriarty gave him a little shove that sent him slipping over.\n\nTomos Williams went over under pressure to score Wales' third try of the game\n\nGareth Davies scored the game's final try to put the finishing touches on a 35-13 victory\n\nThat then saw a number of players pile in to stop a ruckus in the tunnel, which thankfully was avoided.\n\nAfter the break Wales were similarly slow to get going. Leigh Halfpenny missed a routine shot at goal by hitting the right post and the dropped passes kept on coming. Humidity and a slippery ball is no longer an excuse out here in Japan - the temperature in Kumamoto for the match was a much-cooler 21 degrees centigrade with a light breeze too; perfect conditions for rugby.\n\nAt last Wales had a second try as their pressure told. With almost the entire back-line up against two blue-shirted defenders on the left by the line Patchell floated a pass over to Josh Adams and he scored his fifth of the tournament.\n\nAmos was destined not to join him on the scoring sheet - Parkes once again threw a forward pass to him when he was in, so his second try was disallowed rightly by referee Angus Gardner.\n\nUruguay players and staff embraced at the end of the game after their best ever World Cup\n\nIt was yet another clanger - and Parkes followed it up by shelling a catch from the next attack. He and Patchell were not having fine nights.\n\nA wholly frustrating night was at least made slightly better when Wales were awarded a penalty try. Santiago Civetta - the openside flanker - had been sin-binned for conceding Uruguay\u2019s 11th penalty of the evening, so Wales kicked the corner and drove a maul to the line. It was cynically taken down so Gardner awarded the penalty try.\n\nIt would not deter the Uruguayans, though. Back they came - despite having 14 men - and scored through their hooker after multiple phases, German Kessler going over like a Sherman tank.\n\nWales coach Warren Gatland was not happy with the amount of turnovers Wales gave away\n\nTheir celebrations were short-lived as Wales broke at the other end through Halfpenny, then Patchell carried on before Tomos Williams darted in for the bonus-point try.\n\nAmos completely summed up the night by having a third try chalked off - but this one was all his fault. Rhys Carre made a brilliant break, put Amos away on the left but the wing dropped the ball over the line while trying to finish acrobatically one handed.\n\nIt took one of the established men to round it off - Gareth Davies taking a quick tapped penalty and jinking in on a 50-metre mazy run in the 84th minute to put a gloss on the scoreboard.\n\nHe is certain to face France - he will not be joined by many others from this side.", "description": "Wales finished Pool D on top after victory over Uruguay.
