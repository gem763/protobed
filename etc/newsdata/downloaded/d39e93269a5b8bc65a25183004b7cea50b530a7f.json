She was speaking in a debate about misogyny and describing the type of abuse she regularly receives on social media.\u201d", "description": "Boris Johnson, taking his first session of questions from MPs amid Brexit chaos today, swore as he took aim at the opposition\u2019s economic policy.", "authors": ["Chris Harris"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/13/08/84/1000x563_cmsv2_a7bcc11b-a2bf-5e8d-b50a-b1189a6f94f9-4130884.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
