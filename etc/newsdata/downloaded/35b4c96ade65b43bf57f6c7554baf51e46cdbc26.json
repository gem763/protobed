Ends Strike, Approves New Contract with General Motors", "language": "en", "text": "U.A.W. members strike in Hamtramck, Mich., September 22, 2019. (Rebecca Cook/Reuters)\n\nThe United Auto Workers union on Friday approved a new contract with General Motors, ending a nearly six-week-long strike that had seen 49,000 workers walk off the job and forced GM factories to sit idle while thousands of other employees were prevented from coming to work.\n\nThe new contract is \u201ca rich contract for workers,\u201d economist Patrick Anderson told the New York Times. \u201cThe health care coverage would be the envy of nearly every worker in America.\u201d\n\nThe agreement provides a smoother path for temporary employees to attain permanent positions, and allows all full-time hourly workers to achieve a $32 per hour wage after four years. U.A.W. workers also receive an $11,000 bonus as part of the deal.\n\nA GM factory in Lordstown, Ohio that halted production in March will be closed permanently under the agreement. The factory had briefly become an issue in the Democratic primary, when Beto O\u2019Rourke mentioned it during the fourth primary debate.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve met with these members of the U.A.W. who are striking outside of facilities in Cincinnati, in Lordstown, Ohio, which has just been decimated by GM and their maleficence, paying effectively zero in taxes last year,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said at the time. \u201cThey want fairness in how we treat workers in this country, and they\u2019re not getting it.\u201d\n\nThe closing of the Lordstown factory caused some workers to vote against the new contract.\n\n\u201cWe did everything that GM ever asked of us at times of concessions,\u201d said Bill Goodchild, a member of the Lordstown branch of the U.A.W. which overwhelmingly rejected the agreement. \u201cWe feel we deserve a product.\u201d\n\nOne Detroit factory scheduled to close in January will remain open as part of the agreement, which stipulates that GM will invest $3 billion to upgrade the facility.", "description": "The United Auto Workers union on Friday approved a new contract with General Motors, ending a nearly six-week-long strike that had seen 49,000 workers walk off the job and forced GM factories to sit idle while thousands of other employees were prevented from coming to work.", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "Ilya Shapiro", "Mairead Mcardle", "Kevin D.
