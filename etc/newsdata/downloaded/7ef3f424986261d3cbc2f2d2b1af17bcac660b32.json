It is still up five percent compared to the dollar this month as risks of a no-deal Brexit have tumbled.\n\nJohnson's spokesman said the government would push ahead with Brexit if legislators did not agree to an election. Opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn says he will only support an election if a no-deal Brexit is taken off the table.\n\nMeanwhile, sterling's upside should be limited.\n\nThu Lan Nguyen, FX strategist at Germany's Commerzbank, noted the risk of \"running round in circles\".\n\n\"We will see more volatility if we have more elections in December,\" she said. \"As soon as the date's set and decided I would expect implied volatility in the one- to two-month horizon to rise again.\"\n\nSterling-dollar implied volatility - expectations of future price swings - on a one-month maturity were down to 9.15 percent on Friday, the lowest in five weeks.\n\nBut the three-month contract inched to a four-day high at 10.2 percent, as election jitters and fears of prolonged Brexit uncertainty crept in.", "description": "EU ambassadors agreed in principle to a delay, but will not decide the length of the extension until Monday or Tuesday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/9/3/35525c01fe87488495844314f35240d4_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
