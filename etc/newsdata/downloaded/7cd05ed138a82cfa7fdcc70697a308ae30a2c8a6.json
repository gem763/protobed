For most startups and privately-held companies, liquidity is often an issue for stockholders, as no market exists for selling shares and/or transfer restrictions can prevent their sale. Secondary stock transactions, however, are a way to work around this problem.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick look at how they work and what to keep in mind, especially if you\u2019re going through the process for the first time. (If you\u2019re not familiar, secondaries are transactions in which an existing stockholder sells their stock for cash to third parties or back to the company itself before the company undergoes an exit; traditionally, an exit refers to an M&A or an IPO.)\n\nOffering secondary transactions to founders is a tool VCs have been using to win deals. For example, if a VC promises that the founders will receive $1,000,000 in cash through a secondary sale from a $15,000,000 venture financing round, the founders will likely prefer that VC\u2019s term sheet to a term sheet from a VC that does not offer that deal.\n\nWhy would a founder consider a secondary sale of their equity?", "description": "The increase in activity in the pre-IPO secondary market means that founders, early employees, and investors are receiving liquidity much sooner in a company\u2019s lifecycle than ever before...", "authors": ["Ryan Conner"], "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-14-at-12.44.31-PM.png?w=562", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
