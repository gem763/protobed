He started out insisting that people were misstating what he had said, but Mr. Wallace was having none of it. \u201cYou were asked specifically by Jonathan Karl [of ABC News], Was investigating Democrats one of the conditions for holding up the aid \u2014 was that part of the quid pro quo? And you said, \u2018It happens all the time.\u2019\u201d This sent Mr. Mulvaney spinning even more furiously, to which Mr. Wallace responded, \u201cI hate to go through this, but you said what you said.\u201d Mr. Mulvaney could protest all he wanted. Mr. Wallace had video receipts.\n\nThe acting chief wasn\u2019t much better at trying to explain why Mr. Trump thought it a good idea to hold the Group of 7 gathering at one of his company\u2019s resorts. \u201cAt the end of the day, he still considers himself to be in the hospitality business,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney said.\n\nReviews of Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s Sunday gig were not kind, even among the president\u2019s friends and advisers \u2014 one of whom characterized it to Politico as \u201ca self-immolation.\u201d For weeks, word around Washington has been that Mr. Mulvaney has lost favor at the White House. The past few days have kicked speculation into high gear about how much longer he can hang on.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to mock Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s missteps. He has emerged as one of Mr. Trump\u2019s top go-to guys for carrying out questionable orders, such as taking the practical steps necessary to withhold Ukraine\u2019s aid money or shove aside career diplomats in favor of political lackeys.\n\nBut, in Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s defense, he should never have been put in this position. The guy who\u2019s doing the dirty work should not also be the guy expected to go out and defend it to a roomful of journalists. That\u2019s what a press secretary is for \u2014 preferably a professional steeped in the dark art of ensorcelling the Fourth Estate.\n\nSeriously, does anyone think Sarah Huckabee Sanders, in her turn as Mr. Trump\u2019s chief spinner, would have been goaded into admitting a presidential quid pro quo and then admonish everyone for being na\u00efve about that sort of thing? Of course not. She was too adept at dodging, deflecting and flat-out lying to blurt out such an inconvenient truth. If nothing else, she would have pleaded ignorance of the details \u2014 which would have been a tougher sell for Mr. Mulvaney given his role as a recurring character in the Ukraine shenanigans.\n\nHere we see a concrete downside to the White House\u2019s slapdash approach to staffing, its disdain for professionalism and this president\u2019s conviction that, because he\u2019s such a communications whiz, he doesn\u2019t need a message team backing him up.", "description": "The White House chief of staff, still \u201cacting\u201d after all these months, should never have been cast in the role of spin doctor.", "authors": ["Michelle Cottle"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/21/opinion/21mulvaney/21mulvaney-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
