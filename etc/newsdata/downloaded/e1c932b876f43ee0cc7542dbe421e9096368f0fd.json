Independent findings from the Copernicus Climate Change Service (a European climate agency), Japan Meteorological Agency, and Berkeley Earth all show that last month was the warmest on Earth since record-keeping began.\n\nCredit: NOAA.\n\nAccording to data from Berkeley Earth, for instance, last month was 2.2 degrees Fahrenheit (1.22 degrees Celsius) above pre-industrial levels, just shy of the Paris Agreement\u2019s aspirational target of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a statement following the release of the Copernicus data, U.N. Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said, \u201cWe have always lived through hot summers. But this is not the summer of our youth. This is not your grandfather\u2019s summer.\u201d\n\nIf this year\u2019s unprecedented heat continues, it will likely result in 2015-2019 being the hottest five years on record. The previous hottest month ever recorded was July 2016 \u2014 and nine of the 10 hottest Julys ever have all happened since 2005.\n\n\u201cJuly has re-written climate history, with dozens of new temperature records at local, national and global level,\u201d Petteri Taalas, secretary general of the World Meteorological Organization, said in a statement earlier this month.\n\nAn annotated map of the world showing notable climate events that occurred around the world in July 2019. For details, see the short bulleted list below in our story (NOAA)\n\nIndeed, the summer of 2019 will be remembered for Arctic fires, melting Antarctic sea ice, and dangerous heat waves across several continents.\n\nIceland, for instance, officially lost its first glacier to climate change. Scientists will be installing a plaque this month to commemorate the sombre milestone. It reads: \u201cIn the next 200 years all our glaciers are expected to follow the same path. This monument is to acknowledge that we know what is happening and what needs to be done. Only you know if we did it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd over the course of July, Greenland\u2019s ice sheet melted dramatically \u2014 197 billion tons of water from the glaciers flowed into the North Atlantic. This is enough to raise global sea levels by 0.02 inches (0.5 millimeters).\n\nThese events follow last year\u2019s summer which was similarly filled with rare but devastating late-season hurricanes and historic, deadly wildfires \u2014 all trends scientists say can be expected in a warming world.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-480589822.jpg?w=1024&h=660&crop=1"}
