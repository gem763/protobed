Netflix just released the first trailer for a brand-new comedy special from superstar ventriloquist and frequent comic on Forbes\u2019 annual \u201cHighest Earning Stand-up Comedians\u201d list, Jeff Dunham. Titled Beside Himself, the special marks Dunham\u2019s second for Netflix (the first, Relative Disaster, debuted in 2017), was filmed at the American Airlines Center in Dunham\u2019s hometown of Dallas, and features the comedian alongside his usual gang of puppet sidekicks, plus a newcomer named Larry, described as \u201cthe high strung, chain-smoking, on-again, off-again personal advisor to the President.\u201d The press release for the special continues the recent trend of Netflix using the issue of political correctness to tease comedy specials, describing Beside Himself as Dunham covering \u201cparenting and pink eye, all the while skewering political correctness as only he can.\u201d Dunham seems to take on a slightly different angle in the trailer, saying (well, the puppet saying) at one point, \u201cJust because you\u2019re famous does not mean you\u2019re smart. No one effin\u2019 cares.\u201d We\u2019ll know for sure when Beside Himself heads to Netflix on Tuesday, September 24.\n\nRelated", "description": "Netflix released the first trailer for ventriloquist Jeff Dunham\u2019s new comedy special today.
