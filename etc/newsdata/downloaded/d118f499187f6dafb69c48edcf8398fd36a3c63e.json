Trump Misnames His Defense Secretary in Tweet", "language": "en", "text": "The larger problem, of course, is that Mr. Trump made a series of false or unsupported statements about a chaotic situation that has unfolded since he stood by as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey advanced his forces into the area. In recent days, the vice president traveled to Turkey to negotiate a brief cease-fire \u2014 a nominal sacrifice from Mr. Erdogan that the White House has tried to frame as a win.\n\nThe quote Mr. Trump attributed to Mr. Esper could have come from a private conversation between them. But it appeared that it might have been a recounting \u2014 if not an entirely faithful one \u2014 of public comments made by Mr. Esper, who made an unannounced visit to meet with American troops in Afghanistan this weekend and delivered his own assessment of what was happening in Syria.\n\n\u201cI think overall the cease-fire generally seems to be holding,\u201d Mr. Esper said, according to a Reuters correspondent traveling with him. \u201cWe see a stabilization of the lines, if you will, on the ground, and we do get reports of intermittent fires, this and that, that doesn\u2019t surprise me necessarily.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the tweet, Mr. Trump added two confusing elements of his own. The first was that United States had \u201csecured the oil,\u201d a claim he has repeatedly made in recent days without any explanation. The White House did not clarify what he meant by those remarks, and Mr. Trump has ignored the question when asked about it by reporters. Last year, there were about 2.5 billion barrels of oil in the fields in northern Syria, according to industry estimates.\n\nThe president also said that the United States was \u201cbringing soldiers home,\u201d which is also not correct, at least not in the short term: Mr. Esper has confirmed that the troops leaving Syria are heading to Iraq, to continue operations against the Islamic State.", "description": "Even for a president who often lards his online missives with typos, caps-lock abuses and errant exclamation points, Sunday\u2019s Twitter missive on Syria contained an outsize number of errors.", "authors": ["Katie Rogers"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/20/us/20dc-esperanto/20dc-esperanto-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
