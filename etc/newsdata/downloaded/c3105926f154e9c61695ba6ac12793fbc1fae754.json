It was the bears that took the reins in the following hours.\n\nThe ratio reversed and moved quite sharply lower, invalidating the earlier small breakout above the 50% Fibonacci retracement. Additionally, the sellers formed a bearish formation on the above chart \u2013 the dark cloud cover pattern.\n\nWhat do we know about this candlestick formation?\n\nIt usually appears at the end of the upward trend and precedes its reversal. Its first part is formed by a white candle. Then a black candle must appear on the market to complete the formation. What\u2019s important, is that this candle should open above the close of the first candle, pointing to further buying pressure. And that\u2019s exactly what has happened yesterday.\n\nAfter that, the value/price of a given asset usually moves even higher, but the immediately following decline must be strong enough for the black candle to close below the midpoint of the white candlestick\u2019s body. Such a shift from buying to selling suggests that reversal and further deterioration could be just around the corner.\n\nTaking a closer look at the above chart, we see that yesterday\u2019s close was below the above-mentioned level, which increases the probability of lower values of the oil-to-gold ratio in the very near future. This is especially so when we factor in the current situation in the CCI and the sell signal generated by the Stochastic Oscillator.\n\nThat\u2019s all very nice but what does it mean for the price of black gold?\n\nThe correlation between the ratio and the price of the commodity is very strong (0.97), meaning that lower values of the ratio are highly likely to also translate into further deterioration in crude oil.\n\nAnd that further deterioration in the ratio, what would it mean for gold?\n\nThe correlation between the oil-to-gold ratio and the price of yellow metal decreased significantly in the previous weeks, which means that forecasting the direction of the yellow metal based on this relationship is not a good idea.
