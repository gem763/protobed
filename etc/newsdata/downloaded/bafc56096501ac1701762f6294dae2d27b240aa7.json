The benchmark closed 0.5 per cent lower on Thursday.\n\nAustralian stocks are particularly sensitive to developments on the Sino-US trade front, since China is Australia's largest trading partner.\n\nThe Chinese commerce ministry said Beijing and Washington are still discussing details of upcoming trade talks in October, and making preparations to ensure \"positive progress\" is made during the negotiations.\n\nsentifi.com Market voices on:\n\nUS President Donald Trump had stoked trade hopes on Wednesday when he told reporters the two sides were having \"good conversations\" and that an agreement \"could happen sooner than you think\".\n\nThe United States and China are preparing for another round of high-level trade talks in early October in Washington to try to find a way out of their nearly 15-month trade war.\n\n\"Markets are cautiously optimistic ... there are some signs the trade resolution could be certainly moving in the right direction,\" said James Tao, market analyst, CommSec.\n\n\"There's no major indication that we are necessarily going to reach a deal or be closer to a deal, but that's just the market's interpretation of what we've seen from both sides,\" Mr Tao added.\n\nThe Australian technology and utility sub-indexes advanced more than 1 per cent each.
