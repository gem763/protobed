Adam Schiff, the Democratic chair of the House intelligence committee, thinks so.\n\nSchiff said the way Trump leaned on Ukraine, seeking dirt on political rival Joe Biden was a \u201cclassic, mafia-like shakedown\u201d. Many others have made the same comparison.\n\nStrong, smart teen girls have had enough.

The real estate developer and former reality star has talked about it himself \u2013 on late-night TV.\n\nIn 2013, three years before Trump\u2019s presidential victory, David Letterman asked him about it bluntly on his CBS talkshow.\n\n\u201cHave you ever knowingly done business with organized crime?\u201d the host asked.\n\nTrump grimaced, then said: \u201cI\u2019ve really tried to stay away from them as much as possible.\n\n\u201cYou know, growing up in New York and doing business in New York, I would say there might have been one of those characters along the way, but generally speaking I like to stay away from that group.\u201d\n\nThen he added: \u201cI have met on occasion a few of those people. They happen to be very nice people.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s characterization of New York crime families as \u201cvery nice people\u201d might surprise those at the receiving end of Gambino racketeering, Lucchese loan sharking or Bonanno fraud. Not to mention the murders.\n\nBut then Trump has a habit of seeing the good in those generally deemed beyond the pale. His remark about the mafia echoes his comment after the neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia in August 2017 in which a counter-protester was killed.\n\nThen, Trump said there were \u201cvery fine people on both sides\u201d.\n\nThe mafia simile is not a purely stylistic matter for Trump, whose conversation with the Ukrainian president on 25 July reads in parts like a Martin Scorsese screenplay.\n\n\u201cI would like you to do us a favor,\u201d the US president said, encouraging Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate Biden and saying of his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani: \u201cI will get him to call you along with the attorney general.\u201d\n\nAs Trump suggested in his Letterman interview, he has in reality crossed paths with the New York mob. For example, the late Roy Cohn, a predecessor to Giuliani as Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, had among his other clients the boss of the Genovese crime family, \u201cFat Tony\u201d Salerno, and John Gotti of the Gambinos.\n\nTrump Tower, the president\u2019s New York bunker and home on Fifth Avenue, was built in the early 1980s largely out of ready-mix concrete which at the time was controlled by Salerno and other mob leaders.\n\nWayne Barrett, the late Village Voice reporter who was the authority on Trump\u2019s dealings, observed in his book Trump: The Deals and the Downfall that Trump\u2019s life \u201cintertwines with the underworld\u201d.\n\nHaving praised the crime families as \u201cvery nice people\u201d, Trump gave Letterman a piece of advice drawn from his own extensive experience.\n\n\u201cYou just don\u2019t want to owe them money,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t owe them money.\u201d", "description": "Trump, who praised the mob in 2013 on David Letterman, has a habit of seeing the good in those deemed beyond the pale", "authors": ["Ed Pilkington"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6882bdb5199412e7c950255b79191cd6f710f7d1/0_89_2487_1491/master/2487.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6068496f66bdfad4a0c76b4b525a0996"}
