Serrano\u2019s (D-NY) seat for the 15th district of New York in 2020.\n\nBlake\u2019s profile on the DNC website stated:\n\nNew York State Assembly Member Michael Blake was born in The Bronx, NY to Jamaican Immigrants. He is in his third term, representing the 79th District. In the NY State Assembly, Blake is the chairperson of the subcommittee on Mitchell-Lama and member of the following committees: Banks, Correction, Election Law, Governmental Operations, Housing, Veterans\u2019 Affairs, Black, Puerto Rican & Asian Legislative Caucus and Puerto Rican/Hispanic Task Force.\n\nIn 2018, Blake reportedly owed New York $13,000 in taxes, and later that year he was told he owed an additional $8,166.07.\n\n\u201cHe said he is paying down the state and federal taxes in installment plans,\u201d the Post article noted.\n\nHowever, records showed he also failed to report that he received somewhere between $20,000 and $50,000 while doing consulting work for debt collection firm Linebarger Goggan Blair & Sampson in 2013.\n\n\u201cLinebarger is one of the nation\u2019s largest government debt collectors and reportedly one of the most ruthless \u2013 helping inspire federal legislation to combat deceptive tactics used by the industry,\u201d the New York Daily News reported.\n\nOn July 3, Blake said Americans deserved to know what President Trump was allegedly hiding from them when it came to his tax returns.\n\nI commend the House Ways and Means Committee for filing a lawsuit in federal court to obtain President Trump\u2019s tax returns. We demand transparency and know that Congress must conduct oversight. We know that Pres. Trump lied about his business dealings in Russia (1/2) \u2014 Michael Blake (@MrMikeBlake) July 3, 2019\n\nIn a subsequent tweet, he wrote, \u201cWhen elected to Congress, I will fight to protect the institutions of gov\u2019t, and ensure there is not one set of rules for the President and another set for us.\u201d", "description": "The vice chair of the Democrat National Committee (DNC) reportedly owes about $25,000 in back taxes to the state of New York.", "authors": ["Amy Furr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1176572016-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
