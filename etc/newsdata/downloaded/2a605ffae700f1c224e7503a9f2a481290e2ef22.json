And then it grew into something much bigger.\n\nOn August 7, Sharyn Friedman, 57, packed her bags and drove 350 miles west, from her home in Buffalo Grove, Illinois, to Clarion, Iowa, a town so small\u2014\u201citty-bitty,\u201d she remarked to me later\u2014that it had only one grocery store. She was heading there to visit Christine Farrell-Espe, one of her closest friends and someone whom Friedman had never met in person. The two women had been speaking to each other almost daily until then, moving from direct messages to texts to calls to videochats. Farrell-Espe, 54, lives 2,000 miles away, in Southern California, but a visit to her mother-in-law in Iowa brought her into a manageable visiting radius for the plane-shy Friedman. And so, that day\u2014a warm Wednesday, with highs in the upper 80s\u2014Friedman drove for five hours, eager to make it to Farrell-Espe before the eighth. Because the eighth, for both of them, was a bad date: It\u2019s the date of their husbands\u2019 deaths. Farrell-Espe lost hers on March 8, 2017. Mitch had texted her that morning to wish her a happy International Women\u2019s Day, promising to bring dinner home, but collapsed at work of a heart attack\u2014the \u201cwidowmaker,\u201d as it\u2019s known. Friedman\u2019s husband, Steve, died exactly one month later: He\u2019d called to check on her the afternoon of April 8, and had a fatal heart attack sometime afterward, at home.\n\nFriedman and Farrell-Espe, two women in their 50s, widowed a month apart for the same reason, became each other\u2019s confidante in their worst times. Their friendship blossomed in a remarkable way: through, of all things, a TV show that aired on, of all places, Facebook Watch. The women initially met online in a popular grief group on Facebook called Option B. But when Sorry for Your Loss, a drama starring Elizabeth Olsen as a young widow, debuted in the fall of 2018 on the streaming arm of the social-media giant, Friedman and Farrell-Espe became fans and active members of the series\u2019 official Facebook group. The private forum was created to be a dedicated space for viewers to talk about the show, but it\u2019s nothing like a typical fan community. The group\u2019s discussions largely revolve around remembrances of loved ones, as opposed to \u201cshipping\u201d or theorizing about future plot points. The show\u2019s administrators rarely chime in, but the members interact constantly, filling the page with raw accounts of how they\u2019re feeling, along with heartfelt messages of support and photos of the deceased. In short, the drama\u2019s official fan club\u2014Facebook creates one for every Facebook Watch series, though viewers don\u2019t have to join\u2014has transformed into an intimate, deeply personal grief group. The group also bonds over its love of Sorry for Your Loss, which returns for its second season today. The show, which drew critical acclaim for its poignant and humane observations of grief, is a major reason members like Farrell-Espe and Friedman became\u2014and remain\u2014inseparable.\n\nRead: \u2018What Sorry for Your Loss\u2019 understands about grief \u201cIt almost feels like someone\u2019s been watching me. I can\u2019t explain it. [The show] feels so close to home,\u201d Farrell-Espe told me over the phone. As she watched Sorry for Your Loss, she\u2019d check in with Friedman: \u201cI would go, \u2018What\u2019d you feel about this?\u2019 or \u2018Oh my God, I\u2019m sobbing, I just watched Episode 3,\u2019 and then we got closer and closer.\u201d \u201cEverything I\u2019ve seen is, like, real,\u201d Friedman explained when we spoke a few hours later. \u201cI thought, Who the hell wrote this show, and how did she get it right?\u201d Six days after Friedman drove to meet Farrell-Espe, I arrived on the Los Angeles set of Sorry for Your Loss during the last week of shooting for the second season. There I found the person who could answer Friedman\u2019s question\u2014Kit Steinkellner, a playwright and the series\u2019 creator\u2014curled up in a room near the stages where the cast was filming the finale. Steinkellner had conceived of the show after waking up one night to find her husband missing. Though he turned out to be okay, Steinkellner had imagined the worst and couldn\u2019t shake her worry afterward, so she channeled her anxiety into a story about a woman named Leigh (Olsen), who grapples with life after the sudden death of her husband, Matt (Mamoudou Athie). In the first season, Leigh moves home to live with her mother, Amy (Janet McTeer), and sister, Jules (Star Wars\u2019 Kelly Marie Tran), but despite their support, her anger threatens to upend the family\u2019s delicate balance. She embarks on a journey of small, hopeful victories\u2014such as attending her grief-counseling group without losing her temper, stepping back inside the house she\u2019d shared with Matt, and celebrating her birthday without him.\n\nFor three years, the project hopscotched from network to network. \u201cWhen I first started trying to make this show, I heard so many executives and producers say, \u2018Well, we\u2019re just afraid this is going to be depressing or bleak, and people aren\u2019t going to want to see that,\u2019\u201d Steinkellner told me. In January 2018, Facebook Watch picked up Sorry for Your Loss\u2014and now the series is about to launch its second season. Steinkellner likes the word launch; in her mind, she thinks of Leigh\u2019s story as a spaceship that crash-landed on an alien planet. If Season 1 was about Leigh just trying to survive after the crash, Season 2 finds her attempting to piece together her vehicle so she can depart the planet entirely. That\u2019s easier said than done when it comes to actual emotions. On set, I watched as Olsen\u2019s Leigh veered from maniacal laughter to crippling sorrow to quiet placidity in the span of a single scene from the season finale, as she debated her next steps with Tran\u2019s Jules. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m just waiting around for the next bad thing to happen to me,\u201d she moaned, hands over her face. Afterward, Olsen reflected on the turbulent scene, hinting that in the second season, Leigh is itching for escape. \u201cShe needs to get out, and I feel like that\u2019s what really happens in this finale,\u201d she told me. \u201cWe\u2019re shaking the Etch A Sketch. There\u2019s still residue, but there\u2019s going to be a new architecture that\u2019s going to be taking up the space.\u201d\n\nBut going back to Friedman\u2019s question: How did this show get grief right? Even Steinkellner isn\u2019t completely sure. Again, she speaks in metaphor: Plenty of shows, she says, are snow globes, where \u201cit\u2019s happy and warm and comfortable and safe. And of course I want to feel those things [while] watching this show even, but I want to feel all the things,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to see my pain and my confusion and my feeling so weak and figuring out how to be strong. I want to see that in a show \u2026 When you put it on-screen, all of a sudden people pop out of the woodwork and say, \u2018I needed this. I want this.\u2019\u201d Nearly 20,000 people have joined the official Facebook group, with many of them sharing their own stories\u2014a fact Steinkellner is still wrapping her head around. \u201cIt\u2019s overwhelming,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful to be a part of something that\u2019s meaningful for people, but it\u2019s a little hard to hold it all in your brain. When you\u2019re just trying your best to make art good, to make a story feel true and right, and then it ends up actually being important to people?\u201d She shook her head, remembering a comment from a viewer who discovered the existence of grief groups by watching Leigh attend one on the show: The commenter now participates in a group and shared that \u201cit\u2019s been helping.\u201d \u201cI mean, that just \u2026!\u201d Steinkellner trailed off, unable to find the right word. Olsen, too, has seen some of the intimate conversations bubbling up around Sorry for Your Loss. A producer sends her screenshots, because she doesn\u2019t have a Facebook account. She doesn\u2019t much like \u201ccrowds\u201d online, she told me apologetically, but has been impressed by what she\u2019s read.\n\nThe strategy\u2019s paid off so far, especially for reality series: Red Table Talk, the roundtable show spearheaded by the actor Jada Pinkett Smith, saw its official group balloon so quickly (it counts almost 600,000 members), administrators created a series of subgroups organized by region to keep up. Returning the Favor, a reality series about \u201cdo-gooders\u201d from the television personality Mike Rowe, yielded a group called Returning the Favor Effect, in which its more than 164,000 members nominate do-gooders from their own communities. The Sorry for Your Loss group seems paltry in comparison, but the conversation within the group is incredibly active and affecting. \u201cIf you give people a prompt, then they\u2019ll open up,\u201d Van Veen said, adding that he noticed the depth of discussion as soon as the series\u2019 first trailer dropped. \u201cUnderneath you could see this process start, of people sharing their stories, connecting with each other, and getting support from strangers \u2026 Clearly there [was] a need for a larger discussion forum in the form of a group.\u201d Indeed, Facebook has become a popular platform for emotional-support groups, but some of the most prolific ones have run into serious trouble. In November 2017, a group for people dealing with addiction was revealed to have been run by the marketer of a rehab center, who used the group to fish for potential clients. In July 2018, a group for sexual-assault survivors with thousands of members was suddenly changed into a forum for erotica, leading to harassment. (In terms of Sorry for Your Loss, Van Veen pointed out that human moderators \u201clook at every comment and post and make sure it\u2019s a safe space, which is crucial.\u201d)\n\nOn top of that, discussing something as personal as grief requires more vulnerability on Facebook than it might elsewhere on the internet. A user can\u2019t post anonymously on Facebook; there are no usernames in groups. Though every group is \u201cprivate\u201d\u2014searchable, but with content and membership viewable only to members\u2014joining one is relatively easy: For Sorry for Your Loss, the prospective member has to answer three questions pertaining to the series and its themes, and then wait for moderators to approve the request. Carol Conrad Schwachenwald, a 71-year-old widow in Indiana, was one of the first to join the group after her son, who works on the show\u2019s post-production team at Facebook, introduced her to the series. Her husband, David, had died of a tumor on his spinal cord in August 2018, two months before the show premiered, and she felt uneasy about posting. \u201cAt first, I was a bit reticent,\u201d she explained to me when we spoke in September. \u201cI can be a pretty private person. And these are complete strangers.\u201d Farrell-Espe, too, spent a full year lurking in the group, interacting through comments and reactions. \u201cI tend to be a stalker,\u201d she said. \u201cI am kind of just out there looking at other people\u2019s stories. It makes me feel less alone.\u201d Unlike other emotional-support groups, though, the Sorry for Your Loss community was created in conjunction with an official television production\u2014and in that sense, members I spoke with say they feel safe, even if they\u2019re talking about deeply personal issues in a group meant for discussing and promoting a TV series. \u201c[The show] gave us that peace where we already felt that \u2018belonging\u2019 to something, because the show actually makes you feel understood,\u201d Farrell-Espe said. \u201cThere\u2019s something about that that made us all come together.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why Friedman, for one, didn\u2019t hesitate to share her story when she joined. \u201cImmediately,\u201d she replied when I asked how soon she felt comfortable talking about Steve to a group of strangers. Yes, she knows it\u2019s Facebook, and yes, she\u2019s aware of the headlines, but \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Don\u2019t even go there,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t look at the evil; look at the good.\u201d Shortly after we spoke, Farrell-Espe finally shared her first post: a touching tribute to Mitch, accompanied by a photo from their wedding day. Members flooded the post with heart emojis and messages of support\u2014messages that blanket the discussion page overall. \u201cCan I just be real here?\u201d a new member wrote in mid-September ahead of a lengthy post about her fury over losing her husband. \u201cI mean nobody really knows me here right?\u201d \u201cThis is probably the best place ever to be angry and vent,\u201d a veteran member responded. \u201cWe all need to.\u201d Most of the group\u2019s participants are women, but not every member is a widow. Barbara Crocker Chalmers, 51, lost her mother in 2015, an experience that hit her hard. She joined the group in December 2018 after bingeing the show in two days. Being in the group has helped her put her grief into perspective, she said. \u201cWhen [I read that] a young woman has lost her husband, and they\u2019ve only been married five years, or [about] a woman who lost her child, I think, Oh, what I\u2019m going through is not as bad. I should be grateful I had all these years with my mom,\u201d she told me. \u201cThere\u2019s a comparative aspect to it [that] I feel, and yet we\u2019ve all gone through loss, so I think everyone\u2019s understanding when I say, \u2018I\u2019m really struggling this week, and the memories are too much to bear.\u2019 Even that\u2019s enough for people to say, \u2018I\u2019m with you.\u2019\u201d\n\nFriedman often leaves thoughtful comments like that. \u201cTake your time,\u201d she responded to a member who said she had a story to share about her late father but didn\u2019t feel ready yet. \u201cWe aren\u2019t going anywhere.\u201d With me, Friedman is just as open. She explained her lingering sadness about the day of Steve\u2019s death: how her daughter had found him and tried to perform CPR, even though he was already gone. \u201cIf I could change anything about that day except for the outcome,\u201d she said, \u201cthe only thing I would change would be the fact that I found him instead of her.\u201d I suddenly wished we weren\u2019t speaking over the phone, but instead online, where perhaps I could take a little more time to react. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say,\u201d I told her. \u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d she replied generously. \u201cNobody does.\u201d It\u2019s true: Nobody knows how to talk about grief, and though I\u2019d had the urge to put a screen between Friedman and me, being online doesn\u2019t make it any easier. Despite how much people already share on social media, opening up about loss remains tricky. Will a post about someone who\u2019s gone come off as exploitative or appreciative when it pops up in a friend\u2019s News Feed? Is it better not to post at all? What\u2019s the best way to react: with a direct message? A comment? An emoji? Four years ago, I\u2019d gone down the rabbit hole on the subject for The Atlantic, when my News Feed began surfacing a page memorializing a stranger, thanks to a quirk in the site\u2019s algorithm. I chalked it up to Facebook being a massive business with inevitable blind spots, but it was eerie: Here was the digital memorial for a woman I didn\u2019t know, nestled among mundane status updates. It made the whole idea of posting about death and grief seem trivial, just a series of 1s and 0s programmed to spread terrible news.", "description": "Sorry for Your Loss, which returns for a second season this week, started as a candid drama about losing a loved one.
