A paper about quantum computing by a Google researcher making a startling claim appeared on a Nasa website \u2013 and then disappeared shortly afterwards. Conspiracy theorists immediately suspected that something sinister involving the National Security Agency was afoot. Spiritualists thought that it confirmed what they\u2019ve always suspected about quantum phenomena. (It was, as one wag put it to me, a clear case of \u201cSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s Paper\u201d.) Adherents of the cock-up theory of history (this columnist included) concluded that someone had just pushed the \u201cpublish\u201d button prematurely, a suspicion apparently confirmed later by stories that the paper was intended for a major scientific journal before being published on the web.\n\nWhy was the elusive paper\u2019s claim startling? It was because \u2013 according to the Financial Times \u2013 it asserted that a quantum computer built by Google could perform a calculation \u201cin three minutes and 20 seconds that would take today\u2019s most advanced classical computer \u2026 approximately 10,000 years\u201d. As someone once said of the book of Genesis, this would be \u201cimportant if true\u201d. A more mischievous thought was: how would the researchers check that the quantum machine\u2019s calculation was correct?\n\nA quantum computer is one that harnesses phenomena from quantum physics, the study of the behaviour of subatomic particles, which is one of the most arcane specialisms known to humankind. We all inhabit \u2013 and intuitively understand \u2013 a world governed by Newtonian physics \u2013 which explains the behaviour of tangible things such as billiard balls, planets and falling apples. But it turns out that Newton\u2019s laws don\u2019t apply to subatomic particles; quantum theory evolved to explain what goes on in that strange space. The polite term for what goes on there is \u201ccounter-intuitive\u201d. The less polite term is \u201cweird\u201d. In certain situations, for example, quantum theory says that one subatomic particle\u2019s behaviour is bound up with that of another, even if the second one is on the other side of the galaxy. This is known as \u201centanglement\u201d. Another principle is that a particle can be in two different states at the same time \u2013 as with Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s imaginary cat, who was both alive and dead at the same time. This is known in the jargon as \u201csuperposition\u201d.\n\nSuperposition is at the heart of quantum computing. Ordinary computers work with bits that can be either on or off \u2013 coded as zero or one. But quantum computers work with qubits, which can have a value of 0, 1 or both! Thus two qubits can represent four states simultaneously (00, 01, 10, 11) \u2013 which apparently means that 100 qubits can represent 1.3 quadrillion quadrillion states. This means that a quantum computer would be much faster and efficient at some kinds of computation than would be a classic computer, which has to chunter along with bits that are only on or off \u2013 and it explains why the mysterious Google machine might represent a working model of \u201cquantum supremacy\u201d in action.\n\nWhy might this be important? Because the security of our networked world depends on public-key cryptography \u2013 the encryption that protects communications, bank accounts and other sensitive data. At the core of this approach is the fact that factoring very large numbers takes a long time. In 2016, for example, it took several hundred computers two years to crack a message encrypted with a key that was 768 bits long. The same process for material encrypted with a 1,024-bit key would take 1,000 times longer, and cracking anything encrypted with the current highest standard 4,096-bit key would possibly outlast the presence of life on earth. So our security depends on the speed of computers.\n\nIn principle, industrial-scale quantum computers could make a mockery of all this \u2013 but that\u2019s in theory. In practice, quantum supremacy is still a long way off, as Scott Aaronson, a leading academic in the field, points out in a post on his blog. There are, he says, two big obstacles. The first is that a quantum machine capable of tackling current encryption methods would need several thousand logical qubits: \u201cWith known error-correction methods, that could easily translate into millions of physical qubits, and those probably of a higher quality than any that exist today. I don\u2019t think anyone is close to that, and we have no idea how long it will take\u201d.\n\nThe second caveat is that quantum machines would be able to crack some codes but not all possible codes. The public-key codes that would be vulnerable happen to be the ones we use to secure online transactions and to protect data. But private-key encryption will probably still be invulnerable. And researchers have been working on new types of public-key crypto that no one knows how to break \u2013 even in principle \u2013 after two decades of trying.\n\nWhen the Google paper does emerge, it will be interesting for all kinds of reasons \u2013 not least as evidence that the researchers have actually built a working 53-qubit machine. But as a harbinger of crypto-apocalypse it\u2019s likely to be a disappointment. At best, it\u2019ll be a proof of concept; at worst, it\u2019ll be the canary in the crypto-mine.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nOffice politics\n\nScott Galloway has written a hilarious and scathing account on his blog of the fiasco of WeWork\u2019s botched IPO.\n\nImage problem\n\nKate Crawford and Trevor Paglen have done a sobering expos\u00e9 of the hidden politics and biases of the huge image databases used to train machine-learning systems.\n\nPaper chase\n\nThere\u2019s a lovely examination on the Gradient website by Michael Fire of how the publish-or-perish imperative in academia is affecting scholarly publication as metrics are gamed.
