And we applaud you for having these town hall meetings because our last congressman refused to have them.\u201d Many of the people in the tightly packed crowd last week clapped and cheered at this assessment. Sherrill let the ovation subside. \u201cI sense a but coming,\u201d she said with a smile.\n\nCongresswoman Mikie Sherrill greets a full crowd before beginning \"Monday with Mikie\" at Kinnelon Town Hall in Kinnelon, New Jersey. | Sarah Blesener for Politico Magazine\n\nShe was right. But the but was less a question and more a warning. Schraft invoked the name of an ill-fated congressman from this area who won in 1972, defended Richard Nixon in 1973 and lost in 1974. \u201cAnd President Trump, I believe, and a lot of people believe, is 10 times worse than President Nixon,\u201d Schraft told Sherrill. \u201cThat\u2019s why we really would like you to support\u2014like many other members of Congress\u2014an impeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThis drew another roar of approval, and again Sherrill let the noise die down. And in this moment of relative quiet, in this overwhelmingly Republican borough in New Jersey\u2019s 11th Congressional District, a district that hadn\u2019t voted for a Democrat in 3\u00bd decades before it voted for Sherrill last year, the low, firm voice of a woman floated from the rear of the room.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t do it, Sherrill.\u201d\n\nAudience members wait to have their questions answered at \"Monday with Mikie.\" | Sarah Blesener for Politico Magazine\n\nThis is the political fault line that has emerged for centrists like Sherrill. All August, as lawmakers spent time at home during the late-summer recess, and as Trump\u2019s often erratic behavior only intensified, moderate Democrats heard from their more liberal constituents increasingly insistent calls to impeach. As a majority of House Democrats have said do it, Sherrill steadfastly has said wait\u2014not yet. The past month\u2019s storyline has revolved around the question of whether Sherrill and her ilk can withstand the pressure.\n\nAbout this story This is the second installment of a series on the first term of Democratic Representative Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey. The first installment appeared in February.\n\nSherrill and fellow district-flippers, more than Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez or any of the other headline-generating members of \u201cthe Squad,\u201d allowed Democrats to wrest back control of the House, and Sherrill won not only with a perfectly suited biography\u2014Navy helicopter pilot, former federal prosecutor, mother of four\u2014but by laser-focusing on less sexy topics that nonetheless foster more bipartisan agreement\u2014taxes, health care, infrastructure. This deliberate approach facilitated a deft and necessary balancing act in which Sherrill appealed to an ardent base of Democrats activated by the stunning election of Trump, of course, but also to a wide enough array of more quietly unsettled independents and Republicans. Voters to her right were just as responsible for her victory as those to her left, and they will have a similar say over whether she keeps her seat.\n\nTo this point in her term, signs are strong that she can and will: Nobody is filed to run against her\u2014not a GOP hopeful, not a primary challenger. Prognosticators look at her district that Republicans held for 34 years and now rate it \u201clikely Democratic\u201d or no longer even up for grabs. \u201cSherrill,\u201d according to Kyle Kondik of Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball at the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, \u201cis not really vulnerable.\u201d\n\nEight months into her congressional tenure, Sherrill looked at Schraft and spoke into the microphone, conspicuously on brand as a parent, as an attorney, as a soldier-turned-legislator.\n\nShe acknowledged people\u2019s anger and anxieties. She said she shares them. Then she pivoted to the crux of her wait-and-see stance: \u201cWe now have about 29 investigations going\u201d\u2014that\u2019s across the board\u2014\u201cand when you are conducting an investigation, you get as much information as possible. We are still getting information.\u201d\n\nAnd she continued toward her conclusion. Work on so many other pressing issues, and on other committees\u2014the House Armed Services Committee, for instance\u2014needed to go on as well. \u201cBecause Congress doesn\u2019t just have an oversight responsibility,\u201d she said. \u201cIt has a responsibility to be responsive to the people. \u2026 That\u2019s why I\u2019ve taken the position I have.\u201d\n\nThis cautious case for patience elicited not boos, or even grumbling or groans, but another wave of applause.\n\nAfter the town hall, I caught up with Schraft, the social studies teacher, and his wife.\n\nHe was disappointed. \u201cShe\u2019s ducking the issue,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019re going to support her, anyway, right?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cWell, we\u2019ll vote for her,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s something I\u2019ve heard over and over from voters like Schraft in this district. They\u2019re varying degrees of frustrated with Sherrill on this front\u2014but almost certainly not so much so they\u2019ll make her pay with their votes. There\u2019s just too much at stake.\n\nCongresswoman Mikie Sherrill answers questions with a packed house. | Sarah Blesener for Politico Magazine\n\nThe next afternoon, riding in the back of a staffer\u2019s car from a meeting with employees at the office of BASF in Florham Park to a tour of the small airport in Morristown with business leaders and mayors (one Democrat, two Republicans), Sherrill told me about her prisoner-of-war training on the top of a mountain in Maine when the overnight temperature dipped to 65 degrees below zero. The 40 or so men she was with huddled to conserve body heat. She was the only woman. She got frostbite. That felt dangerous. She told me about being blindfolded and strapped into a helicopter that was flipped upside down in a giant tank of water. She had to swim her way out. That felt dangerous.\n\n\u201cI guess I\u2019m not feeling that pressure,\u201d she said.\n\nIf she perceives danger, she suggested, it is not in her district, with which she feels \u201cfairly well aligned,\u201d but in the wider political terrain. She was a key part of the way Democrats got their main toehold against Trump last year, and to lose that next year, she said, to give up any ground in this fraught fight, would be disastrous.\n\n\u201cIf this president wins reelection, we need to have the House of Representatives. I think he\u2019s been very bad for this country. And I think the only backstop right now is the House. And so I don\u2019t take that responsibility lightly.\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\nImpeachment buzz built slowly in northern New Jersey. As recently as late May, when I attended Sherrill\u2019s town hall in Bloomfield, a much more liberal part of the district, the subject barely came up. The first time I heard it mentioned that evening was as the meeting was ending and one of Sherrill\u2019s most recognizable constituents asked her about it. Jack Gavin, a 59-year-old IT professional, is tall\u2014\u201c5-foot-17,\u201d he once told me\u2014and wore a tan mesh vest and a bushy white beard and often hands out pocket-sized editions of the Constitution. His blue Subaru Forester is covered in bumper stickers, including one that says \"MAKE THE BAD MAN GO AWAY,\" and has a license plate that says, \"FACTS.\"\n\nOn this particular Sunday in a middle school auditorium, special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s redacted report had been out for a month. Based on his reading, Republican Representative Justin Amash of Michigan, then a Republican, had concluded Trump\u2019s actions met the \u201cthreshold for impeachment.\u201d Gavin asked Sherrill what her holdup was. \u201cWhat will it take?\u201d he said. She wanted, she told him, to hear from Mueller\u2014that wouldn\u2019t happen for another two months\u2014and she wanted, too, to be able to read \u201cthe full, unredacted report.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re in a good spot right now,\u201d Sherrill told Gavin. \u201cI think what we\u2019re doing right now is what we need to be doing.\u201d\n\nBy August, though, more and more progressives in the 11th saw this stance as unacceptably circumspect.\n\n\u201cWe are writing as your constituents with growing fervor and alarm over the lack of urgency,\u201d Laura Valente and three other Nutley residents wrote in a letter to Sherrill dated August 1. It called Sherrill\u2019s statement after Mueller\u2019s testimony \u201ctepid.\u201d It quoted Harvard Law professor Laurence Tribe: \u201cTo wait for the results of the multiple investigations underway is to risk tying our nation\u2019s fate to the whims of an authoritarian leader.\u201d It beseeched Sherrill \u201cto do what ONLY you can do for us\u201d\u2014\u201cbold, decisive support for impeachment proceedings.\u201d It was signed by 128 other like-minded voters in the district. It was an apt kick-start to the month.\n\nThe next week, in Sherrill\u2019s district headquarters in Parsippany, the often calleed the \u201cCrossroads of North Jersey,\u201d Valente and the other letter-writers met with her for half an hour.\n\n\u201cI told her that growing up, being a student of history, I always imagined that I would have the courage to have hidden Anne Frank or to have marched across the Edmund Pettus Bridge,\u201d Valente told me, \u201cand that this moment in time in the history of our nation once again calls for that level of courage.\u201d\n\nSherrill responded, Valente recalled, with her belief that probable acquittal in the Senate would embolden Trump and amount to implicit and precedent-setting approval of his conduct. She would change her mind, Valente heard Sherrill say, if and when the majority of Americans supported impeachment, which continues to not be the case.\n\nAfter Sherrill expressed similar sentiments in the middle of the month on \u201cThe Daily,\u201d the popular New York Times podcast, a man from Parsippany admonished her in a letter to the editor in a local publication. \u201cYou once held the controls of a U.S. Navy Helicopter where at any time your commanding officer could have sent you into harm\u2019s way, risking your life, your future, and basically all that you have right now\u2014all for the sake of your country,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe need at least some of that same courage right now. Rep. Sherrill, stand in the way of autocracy and stand up for the rule of law when you return to Washington.\u201d\n\nThe scene was set for what happened three days later at Sherrill\u2019s town hall in Verona. Valente was there. She kept holding her hand up but wasn\u2019t called on.\n\nToward the end of the evening, she turned to people around her, she told me.\n\n\u201cIf I start chanting, \u2018Impeach now,\u2019 will you follow me?\u201d\n\nTheir chanting lasted approximately 10 seconds\u2014watch it starting with about 10 minutes to go here\u2014and they held signs saying the same thing. Sherrill stood still, smiling, her hands calmly clasped. She heard them, of course\u2014\u201cabout four people in a 150-person town hall,\u201d she told me later\u2014but it\u2019s not all she heard. \u201cOther people said, \u2018Quiet down, you\u2019re wasting time,\u2019\u201d she said with a laugh, \u201cso it wasn\u2019t like the whole room adopted this like, oh, you know, pitchforks mentality.\u201d\n\nStill, with the topic in the air, a different woman asked Sherrill to explain her position, again, and she did, again.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t make a strong enough case to the American people, and right now I don\u2019t think we can do that without more, the president will be acquitted,\u201d she said, \u201cand we will now have two branches of our government that have said that his behavior is acceptable and that is how we want our president to act. So we have to be incredibly thoughtful.\u201d She said a \u201cbright line\u201d for her would be if Trump and his administration flout final decisions from courts. Until then, though, she reiterated her conviction in the prudence of restraint. \u201cI think,\u201d she said, \u201cwe are building a very strong investigation, and I think we\u2019re doing the right thing.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve been to four of her town halls this year. Each time I\u2019m reminded that the sorts of issues Sherrill ran on in 2018 are the sorts of issues that matter the most to the most people here still. In spite of the recent, attention-getting uptick in clamor for impeachment, the vast share of what she hears at these public forums has been about gun control and climate change and prescription drug prices and wearying commute times on deteriorating bridges, tunnels and roads, and property taxes, and the funding of elections, and the exasperating numbers of robocalls\u2014a range of issues that gets next to no time on cable news but makes up the humdrum backbone of any functioning\u2014or nonfunctioning\u2014public sector. In my estimation, for whatever that\u2019s worth, Sherrill has been a pretty quick study, getting more comfortable with each appearance at saying what she wants to say and how she wants to say it.\n\nAnd in Kinnelon, from my seat in the front row, I watched her give her answer to Schraft\u2019s question about impeachment and found it clinical to the point of almost practiced. It was different, though, when she was asked about gun control. Sherrill is as constitutionally measured as she is politically moderate, but she got unusually emotional. She didn\u2019t cry, a la Andrew Yang, but there was a discernible anger and a thickness in her voice. She emphasized the bipartisan bill she co-sponsored calling for universal background checks during gun purchases and decried a recalcitrant Republican Senate. She cited a USA Today op-ed she recently wrote with Democratic Representative Jason Crow of Colorado. She lauded New Zealand\u2019s fast actions after a single mass shooting. And she related a story of a kindergartner who was scared to change schools because she didn\u2019t know \u201cwhich closet to hide in\u201d in her new school. \u201cHow is this OK?\u201d she said sharply to the crowd. \u201cHow are we living and normalizing this level of violence in our communities? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s acceptable, and I\u2019m fighting very hard to end it.\u201d\n\nVeterans line the front row of the Kinnelon Town Hall as \"Monday with Mikie\" kicks off. | Sarah Blesener for Politico Magazine\n\nOver the course of the hourlong affair, she did what she almost always does. She started with the reciting of the Pledge of Allegiance. She honored local veterans. She said the word \u201cbipartisan\u201d with practically comedic frequency, and people noticed it and said they liked it. The most boisterous cheer of the night, by far, was for a seventh-grader who asked what could be done to make politicians from different parties get along and work together. The Republican mayor of the borough declared himself \u201cstarstruck\u201d by Sherrill.\n\nI looked at the man on the other side of the room in the blue blazer standing against the wall with his arms crossed studying Sherrill and the dynamics of the room and couldn\u2019t help but wonder what he was thinking.\n\n\n\n***\n\nKeith Dakin, a Republican, is thinking about running against Sherrill. Late the next night, I met him at the bar of the Parsippany Sheraton, which looks like a castle and hosted Sherrill\u2019s victory party last November and sits across the street from her headquarters now. Dakin, 53, is a fit, divorced father of two middle school-aged sons who works in the irrigation business and has never run for any office of any kind. He and I talked for 2\u00bd hours until the bartender turned the lights on bright. Shrunk to size, the theory of the case for his notional bid is that Sherrill is not far enough to the left to be a Democrat.\n\nCongresswoman Mikie Sherrill attends a meeting with St. Clare\u2019s Opioid Response Team. | Sarah Blesener for Politico Magazine\n\nSherrill, for example, is leery of \"Medicare for All,\" instead advocating for more incremental improvements to the health care system as constituted. So is Dakin. \u201cI don\u2019t differ all that much,\u201d he said.\n\nHe\u2019s also for universal background checks during gun sales and commonsense gun control. \u201cRight,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a moderate Republican.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are a two-party system,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that Mikie Sherrill aligns solely with either one of them.\u201d Perhaps he detected on my face my confusion. \u201cWhat she\u2019s doing is\u2014you can call it brilliant by moving and appealing to Republican voters,\u201d he said, \u201cbut they\u2019re Republican voters, right?\u201d\n\nHe told me about a conversation he had had with three voters after the Kinnelon town hall. \u201cTwo women walked up to me,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018What\u2019s your name?\u2019 \u2018Keith Dakin\u2014hoping to run for Congress.\u2019 And the third walked up to me and said, \u2018I\u2019m from Kinnelon borough, and I\u2019ve been a registered Republican now for 40 years, and if you can\u2019t take a position on gun rights and health care right now, you don\u2019t have a chance, because we\u2019re going with her.\u2019\u201d\n\nI asked what he said in response.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t really get the opportunity. She kind of walked away from me,\u201d Dakin said.\n\n\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll lose,\u201d he granted.\n\n\u201cIf she switched parties, I\u2019d get out of the race right now\u2014before I even get in it,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a leftist Democrat,\u201d he said at the tail end of our time together, \u201cyou\u2019re not with Sherrill.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not so sure.\n\nAt a town hall last week at the Cedar Crest retirement home in Pompton Plains, Nat Arkin, 93, asked the first question. \u201cThe Mueller report was released four months ago,\u201d he said. \u201cI know you\u2019re opposed to impeachment now, and I\u2019d like to know: If not now, when?\u201d Sherrill answered the way she answers. \u201cI wasn\u2019t fully satisfied,\u201d Arkin told me later. In Sherrill\u2019s last campaign, working through the home\u2019s Democratic club, Arkin gave money to her, phone-banked for her and wrote letters to the editor supporting her. And he voted for her. And he\u2019ll vote for her again. \u201cThere\u2019s no way in hell I would vote for a Republican at this time in my life, with what\u2019s going on in the country,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen I talked to Valente, the woman who wrote Sherrill the letter and met with her in her office and stoked the chants at the Verona town hall and hollered that focusing on anything other than impeachment at this point is akin to mowing the lawn while the house is on fire, I asked if she still would still vote for Sherrill next year. \u201cWell, yeah,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s the full blue no matter who mentality right now because of the existential threat.\u201d\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Gavin. When I first met him in January, he handed me buttons he plucked from the pockets of his vest\u2014FACTS MATTER, BE THE CHANGE, etc ... \u2014but he also sounded a pragmatic note. \u201cShe has to work within the district,\u201d he said. \u201cShe can\u2019t\u2014what\u2019s the word I\u2019m looking for?\u2014she can\u2019t disenchant her supporters. On either end. But the people on her left are, in my opinion, so grateful to have this tremendous improvement. We never expect it to be perfect. I never expect to agree with her 100 percent.\u201d\n\nCongresswoman Mikie Sherrill receives a tour of St. Clare's Hospital. | Sarah Blesener for Politico Magazine\n\nI usually see him on my trips to Sherrill\u2019s district. I didn\u2019t see him last week. I gave him a call.\n\n\u201cI cut her some slack,\u201d Gavin told me. \u201cOn impeachment \u2026 less so.\u201d\n\nHe wishes she would join the list of House Democrats calling to\u2014as that bumper sticker of his puts it\u2014\"MAKE THE BAD MAN GO AWAY.\" If somebody challenged her in a primary, he said, he\u2019d give that person a look. For now, though, would he vote again for Sherrill?\n\nGavin hesitated not at all.\n\n\u201cI would go for her rather than any Republican I can conceive of,\u201d he said. \u201cAbraham Lincoln is dead.\u201d\n\nThis article tagged under: New Jersey\n\nElections\n\nImpeachment", "description": "Impeachment chatter hasn\u2019t budged the New Jersey moderate.
