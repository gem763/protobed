I'm trying to create the drive to fund other people in the future that are also black and female.\"\n\nShe said she needed R60 000 to complete her private pilot's licence, and then another R250 000 for her commercial pilot's licence.\n\n\"It's really expensive. Very few South Africans in general, regardless of colour, will be able to afford something like that. That's why I'm trying to start the drive to get more youth involved.\"\n\nTshepang also has to pay for accommodation close to Wonderboom so that her training is not disrupted if there is a protest that blocks the journey from Atteridgeville, Tshwane.\n\n\"She is so passionate. You should see her eyes when she talks about aviation, she just changes,\" said Doris.\n\nShe is offering her baked goods to individuals who want something to nibble on at home, or companies who want to treat their staff, or present them as gifts.\n\nFor now, Doris will deliver within a reasonable driving distance of Atteridgeville, as the small profits will be eaten up by petrol if she goes further.\n\n(Supplied)\n\nHowever, people from further afield, like Cape Town, are paying for a tub of biscuits without expecting anything in return. They just want Tshepang to reach her goal.\n\nShe has set up a Twitter account, @AviCareer, for people who want to interact with flight students or learn more about aviation as a career, and has started a hashtag #EveryBarHasAStory, while Doris can be reached on her Facebook page.", "description": "An Atteridgeville woman has turned to baking biscuits to raise the money needed to get her niece through flight school to achieve her dream of becoming a pilot.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9465/1d58c69529da4c1d8482209ba061c766.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
