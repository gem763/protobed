Now the pressure is on for Dasilva to keep the momentum going. That\u2019s no easy feat when you have shareholders with different priorities.\n\n\u201cOur Canadian investors would like to see profitability sooner and the American investors would like to see growth, more growth,\u201d the 43-year-old chief executive officer said in an interview at his office.\n\nThe company, whose point of sale software helps small businesses manage things like inventory and online transactions, is addressing \u201cboth sides of the coin,\u201d he said. Spotting when data trends in the wrong direction is part of the strategy.\n\nInvestors are banking on Lightspeed\u2019s ability to sign up thousands of new clients among retailers and restaurants, a market the company says is worth US$113 billion. The stock has doubled since the March IPO, propelling the company\u2019s enterprise value as a share of projected sales \u2014 a closely watched ratio in the industry \u2014 above that of peers including payment-based Square Inc. and web development platform Wix.com.\n\nThe road has gotten bumpier of late. Shares have lost about a third of their value since reaching a record on Aug. 9, partly due to investors\u2019 shift from growth to value stocks this month. They also fell in August, when Dasilva, pension fund Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec, and venture capital firm Inovia Capital jointly trimmed their stakes after IPO-related restrictions lifted.\n\nThe top shareholders say they\u2019re in for the long run, supporting Dasilva as he tries to emulate the success of Shopify Inc., the US$36 billion e-commerce juggernaut and Canada\u2019s tech pride. The two companies once had a partnership and now offer some competing services, though transactions at Lightspeed\u2019s clients tend to be bigger.\n\nLightspeed\u2019s market value of $2.7 billion is still less than a one-tenth the size of Shopify, as is its revenue.\n\n\u201cA lot of large institutions missed Shopify, so they see Lightspeed as the second entrant into the marketplace,\u201d said Thomas Birch, who oversees private equity venture capital funds and technology investments in Quebec for the Caisse, which owns about 31 per cent. \u201cThey\u2019re prepared to potentially pay a premium today because they know that Lightspeed is going to grow incessantly over the next five years.\u201d\n\nThe company, which derives most of its revenue from clients\u2019 monthly payments for its cloud-based technology, is predicting sales will jump as much as 48 per cent this fiscal year. That\u2019s up from 36 per cent last year, as it expands its foothold overseas and adds payment processing to its offerings.\n\nDasilva has no official target date for turning a profit, though he\u2019s made progress on the growth front. The company bought two smaller rivals this year, bringing acquisitions to seven since its 2005 inception and gaining customers in Europe and the golf course industry.\n\nAbout half of its global workforce of 800 people works at the castle-like headquarters, where exposed brick and giant wooden beams frame artwork, sleek chairs and counters. Dasilva took art history and religious studies in college after dropping out as a computer science major.\n\nWith Lightspeed\u2019s roughly US$190 million in cash on hand at the end of last quarter, the Vancouver native is eyeing more acquisitions. He\u2019s also boosting spending on marketing and ads to get the attention of entrepreneurs in the early stages of setting up a business.\n\nHe can draw from an experienced board, including Chairman Patrick Pichette, a general partner at Inovia, who oversaw dozens of acquisitions as Google\u2019s former chief financial officer.\n\nThere\u2019s room to grow. Lightspeed has about 0.1 per cent of the addressable market of 47 million small and medium businesses and restaurants worldwide.\n\nRetail Changes\n\nThe retail industry is moving away from stationary checkout terminals and on-location servers to modern point of sale systems like Lightspeed\u2019s that are cheaper, web-based, and can be used on mobile devices. They can also offer tools and data and integrate online sales. The industry is growing at twice the pace of the legacy system and will surpass it in size by 2027-28, according to U.S. research firm Global Market Insights.\n\nEtiket, a beauty store and spa in Montreal which also sells niche fragrances and skin care products online, signed up for Lightspeed\u2019s accounting, e-commerce and analytics on top of the basic point of sale package. It may add payments next, when the service becomes available in Canada.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s integrated and that\u2019s one less problem,\u201d Etiket co-owner Simon Tooley said. The trade off is you have \u201call your eggs in one basket\u201d if something goes wrong, he said.\n\nPayments Push\n\nPayments is new territory for Lightspeed and investors are watching how fast businesses embrace the service, which collects a percentage of every transaction. In the U.S., where Lightspeed introduced the option about eight months ago, almost half of new retail clients subscribed in the most recent quarter.\n\nNow the company needs to show it can deploy the service worldwide and weather competition from deep-pocketed payment processors, according to a note by Raymond James analyst Steven Li.\n\n\u201cGoing public was about building reputation and visibility, and having the capacity to grow\u2013not about just giving liquidity to investors,\u201d Inovia co-founder Chris Arsenault said. \u201cCanada is very young in terms of building huge companies in our own backyard. We\u2019ve lagged and now we\u2019re just starting to catch up.\u201d\n\nDasilva, the son of Ugandan immigrants of Goan descent, provides another inspiration for Canada\u2019s entrepreneurs, following Ottawa-based Shopify\u2019s 1,750 per cent growth since its 2015 trading debut.\n\nOne of the few openly gay CEOs in Canada, Dasilva is also an atypical figure in tech who set up a cultural centre in Montreal and recently released a book infused with spirituality.\n\n\u201cThey blazed the trail; we have as well,\u201d Dasilva said of Shopify. \u201cI talk to more tech companies in Canada that are thinking bigger as a result.\u201d\n\nBloomberg.com", "description": "Top shareholders say they're in for the long run, supporting CEO Dax Dasilva as he tries to emulate the success of Shopify", "authors": ["Sandrine Rastello", "Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/dax-dasilva.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
