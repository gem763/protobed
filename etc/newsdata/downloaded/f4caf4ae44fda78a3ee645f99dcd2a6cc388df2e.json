Today, the blurting out of national scandals expanded a few thousand miles eastward, when the president encouraged China to investigate former vice-president Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cChina should start an investigation into the Bidens because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened in Ukraine,\u201d Trump said on the south lawn, without giving any context for what he was talking about. (The president appears to be referring to allegations revolving around an official White House trip in 2013 which Hunter Biden tagged along on; shortly after the visit, a private-equity fund that the younger Biden sat on the board of received an infusion of Chinese capital, though Biden reportedly has not received any money from the fund related to his board seat.)\n\nAccording to a report from CNN, this eruption from the president wasn\u2019t spontaneous: In a phone call with President Xi from June 18, Trump brought up Biden and Elizabeth Warren, and mentioned that he wouldn\u2019t comment on the protests in Hong Kong as China and the U.S. pursued an end to the trade war. The record of the call was then dumped in the top-secret server that the Ukraine call was stored in \u2014 the one that the whistle-blower revealed in his complaint that also contains conversations with Vladimir Putin and Mohammed bin Salman. (Earlier in the week, the White House had not denied that Trump raised Biden in the conversation with Xi.)\n\nAs if a second open solicitation of foreign aid in an election wasn\u2019t enough for a Thursday morning, according to CNN, a Trump ally confirmed the seriousness of the president\u2019s request: \u201cOne Trump ally outside the White House described receiving a message from Chinese government officials asking if Trump was serious when he suggested China open an investigation into Biden. The response: investigating corruption is an easy way to earn goodwill with Trump.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to overstate how shortsighted the president\u2019s actions were on the south lawn \u2014 canvassing a second head of state for election aide while facing an impeachment inquiry for the first effort. But more staggering is the fact that his allies are right there with him, confirming his worst impulses. When in Mar-a-Lago\u2026\n\nThe administration in Beijing is certainly playing their hand a little closer to the chest: a Chinese diplomat who spoke with CNN said that Trump\u2019s request was \u201cquite chaotic\u201d and that \u201cwe do not want to get in the middle of the US politics.\u201d Meanwhile, the president was back on Twitter Thursday night, affirming his self-perceived right to do whatever he wants:\n\nAs the President of the United States, I have an absolute right, perhaps even a duty, to investigate, or have investigated, CORRUPTION, and that would include asking, or suggesting, other Countries to help us out! \u2014 Donald J.
