But the issue is more complex than one might think; the courts have ruled on both sides.\n\nWhen I appeared on a panel before the Inns of Court in Houston, Texas, on the topic \u201cFree Speech on Campus,\u201d the matter of hate and racist speech came up and whether the Constitution protects it.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt does and does not. One panelist, a lawyer and regent at a flagship university in Texas, said that if an African-American student offended someone with racist language, he or she \u201cwould be history,\u201d expelled before \u201cthe end of the day.\u201d\n\nBut if public schools take government money, they must comply with the First Amendment.\n\nThe second panelist, an African-American law student, said, \u201cI know the n______ word is protected.\u201d She said the word.\n\nI had to deal with this issue as a trustee at a college in Texas. Two African-American employees got into a heated argument, with one losing her temper and referring to the other with a racist epithet. The target asked the administration to fire the offender, and it did.\n\nWhen I asked the administration whether the First Amendment protected the offender\u2019s epithet, the response was that another ruling by the Supreme Court supported the firing. In 2006 the court ruled in Garcetti v. Ceballos that the administration can to some extent control the speech of employees to maintain an effective public workplace.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSuppose, as an illustration, a professor is hired to teach freshman composition but decides instead to teach, say, poetry, arguing that the Constitution protects his academic freedom and right to free speech in the classroom.\n\nThe school can fire him for this free speech. The Garcetti ruling states, \u201cWe hold that when public employees make statements pursuant to their official duties, the employees are not speaking as citizens for First Amendment purposes, and the Constitution does not insulate their communications from employer discipline.\u201d Anderson was on an on-the-job public employee when he spoke the offensive word.\n\nStill, I think firing the guard for accurately quoting a student does not pass the smell test. Court history generally argues for freedom of even hate and racist speech. Said the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, \u201cIf you stop speech that hurts other peoples\u2019 feelings, the First Amendment will become a dead letter.\u201d And when Justice Samuel Alito Samuel AlitoSupreme Court abortion case poses major test for Trump picks Supreme Court to hear Louisiana abortion case Overnight Defense: Esper sworn in as Pentagon chief | Confirmed in 90-8 vote | Takes helm as Trump juggles foreign policy challenges | Senators meet with woman accusing defense nominee of sexual assault MORE was an appellate judge, he opined, \u201cThere is no categorical \u2018harassment exception\u2019 in the First Amendment\u2019s free speech.\u201d\n\nMany in the scholarly world have also argued for constitutional protection of hate speech. For example, John Banzhaf, a professor at George Washington University Law School, observed, \u201cThere is no hate speech exception of the U.S. Constitution.\u201d And Eugene Volokh, who teaches free-speech law at UCLA School of Law, asserts, \u201cThere is no First Amendment exception for racist speech, or exclusionary speech, or ... for speech by university students that \u2018created a hostile educational environment for others.\u2019\u201d\n\nIf the KKK can march down streets in Jewish neighborhoods in Skokie, Ill., security guard Marlon Anderson can quote a kid for using a racial slur and tell him not to use it again in the school.\n\nRonald L.
