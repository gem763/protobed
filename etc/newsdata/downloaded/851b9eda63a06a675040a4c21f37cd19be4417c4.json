It\u2019s done in broad daylight,\u201d he complained.\n\nJammu and Kashmir leaped back to the top of the international agenda as a flashpoint between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan earlier this month, when New Delhi stripped the state of its autonomous status, restricted communications and imposed curfews.\n\nSince early August, leading international media have reported widespread arrests, supply problems at hospitals, demonstrators wounded by pellet shots and small businesses struggling to get by because of communications\u2019 blackouts in Kashmir. Khan accused the Indian security services of shooting protesters dead.\n\n\u201cWe would not accept any country telling us who to buy weapons from and who not to buy from\u201d \u2014 Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, India\u2019s external affairs minister\n\nJaishankar said internet and telephone outages were needed to stop the activation of \u201cterrorist assets\u201d and to prevent \u201cpeople who are doing violence to contact each other.\u201d When asked about medicines and small businesses, he said he thinks \u201ca lot of the reports about shortages are fictitious,\u201d but he also conceded it isn\u2019t possible to stop communications between militants without an impact on the rest of the economy.\n\n\u201cHow do I cut off communications between the terrorists and their masters on the one hand, but keep the internet open for other people? I would be delighted to know.\u201d\n\nTime to pull forces out\n\nJaishankar is confident, however, that there would be an improvement soon.\n\n\u201cI would suggest to you that in the coming days you will see an easing up progressively,\u201d he said. This should involve a reduction in the number of extra security forces [who were brought into the disputed region] and the minister insisted he wants police sent back to their original duties soon. \u201cFrankly they have other jobs and other things to do.\u201d\n\nThe former ambassador to Washington and Beijing also adamantly denied that there was a Hindu nationalist agenda in removing Kashmir\u2019s special status in order to allow more non-Muslims to buy property there and muscle aside the Muslim majority.\n\n\u201cThe kind of people who say this are people who don\u2019t know India,\u201d he said. \u201cDoes this sound like the culture of India?\u201d\n\nThe dispute over Kashmir has opened up a raw religious and demographic faultline in South Asia, with Pakistan\u2019s Khan openly accusing New Delhi of pursuing a Hindu supremacist agenda that seeks to turn India\u2019s Muslims into second-class citizens.\n\nJaishankar retorted that the new investment landscape in Kashmir would only be to the region\u2019s broader economic advantage. He said Kashmir\u2019s new status would allow the sort of big entrepreneurial investment that is more typical in other Indian states. \u201cPeople in this day and age were not willing to invest in a state with such restrictive conditions,\u201d he said, arguing that weak economic development in Kashmir has played into the hands of \u201ccross-border terrorists.\u201d\n\nThe minister also flatly dismissed any suggestion that New Delhi might strip powers from any other autonomous Indian regions, saying the situation in Jammu and Kashmir had been \u201cunique.\u201d\n\nDuring his visit to Brussels, Jaishankar met the president of the European Parliament, David Sassoli, and European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini, who urged dialogue between India and Pakistan and \"stressed the importance of steps to restore the rights and freedoms of the population in Kashmir,\" Mogherini's office said in a statement.\n\nTreading round Trump\n\nTurning to India\u2019s relations with U.S. President Donald Trump, Jaishankar broached the challenges posed by a potential tit-for-tat tariff war, India\u2019s interest in resuming purchases of Iranian oil and U.S. reservations about India\u2019s acquisition of S-400 surface-to-air missiles.\n\nDiscussing Trump\u2019s increasingly hard stance on Indian tariffs, the minister said India is in a mood to compromise. \u201cLike any relationship, there\u2019s give and take \u2026 Our expectation is that our trade ministers will sit down in the near future. I think many of these issues are eminently [open] to resolution.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, he admitted that energy-hungry India\u2019s desire to purchase Iranian oil is \u201crather complicated\u201d and that he hopes for \u201cgreater clarity.\u201d When asked whether there are really no grounds to negotiate because Washington simply has zero tolerance for Iranian oil purchases, he chose not to commit himself. \u201cOne of the nice things about an interview is that when you reach a level where you don\u2019t want to say what you don\u2019t want to, you don\u2019t say it.\u201d\n\nOn arms' purchases from Russia, however, Jaishankar took a more absolute position and argued that he is not going to be deterred from a \u201csolid, time-tested\u201d relationship with Moscow.\n\n\u201cWe would not accept any country telling us who to buy weapons from and who not to buy from,\u201d he said.", "description": "Foreign minister Jaishankar rebuffs a call for talks from Pakistan\u2019s Imran Khan.", "authors": ["Christian Oliver", "Stephen Brown", "Myra Macdonald", "Saim Saeed"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1164776906-1200x628.jpg"}
