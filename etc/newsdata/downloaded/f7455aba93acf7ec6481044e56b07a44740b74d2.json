Dave Birkett and Carlos Monarrez, Detroit Free Press\n\nMatthew Stafford held his tongue and passed on making any comments about a recent Bleacher Report parody video he said he had not seen that depicted him as the Joker.\n\nBut a day later, Kerryon Johnson was more than willing to run to his quarterback\u2019s defense Thursday.\n\nThe Detroit Lions running back took to Twitter to criticized the video shortly after it came out Tuesday.\n\nWhen he was asked about the video by reporters in the locker room, Johnson went into detail about why he didn\u2019t like the animated video.\n\n\u201cYou know, I don\u2019t watch that stuff often, but I work with Stafford every single day and I know Stafford\u2019s not going to care,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cHe probably hasn\u2019t even seen it, would be my guess. He doesn\u2019t watch any of that crap. But for me, it\u2019s one thing to attack Detroit. Don\u2019t care. But when you attack a specific person who\u2019s been in this league the better part \u2014 he\u2019s been one of the best since he came in the league. Kept his head down, all he cares about is trying to win, all he cares about is trying to be a good teammate. That\u2019s why I had an issue with it, not that anybody cares that I have an issue with it.\n\nWtf is this https://t.co/qkk4Pq0Lsa \u2014 Kerryon Johnson (@AyeyoKEJO) October 8, 2019\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not like he\u2019s out here talking trash just being a (jerk) all the time. He\u2019s out here doing his job every day. The only person they talk about in the video was him. That kind of bothered me. Like I said, I know he\u2019s not going to say anything but I have no issue saying something. I have no issue with somebody getting mad at me saying something.\u201d\n\nContact Carlos Monarrez at cmonarrez@freepress.com or follow him on Twitter @cmonarrez.", "description": "Kerryon Johnson vents about Bleacher Report's parody video of Matthew Stafford.
