REUTERS/James Lawler Duggan\n\nIn a statement issued after her meeting in Washington with Somali Prime Minister Hassan Ali Khaire, Georgieva said Somalia was committed to making further reforms despite challenging circumstances, which were aimed at paving the way for debt relief.\n\nThe African nation has about $4.7 billion in external debt, accounting for about 100% of its GDP, which the Fund has declared to be unsustainable.\n\n\u201cI assured the Prime Minister of the IMF\u2019s full support for Somalia\u2019s efforts to secure debt relief, including working with the membership of the Fund to secure the financial resources necessary to clear arrears to the IMF and cover the costs of debt relief,\u201d Georgieva said.\n\n\u201cWe exchanged views on the importance of securing debt relief under the Highly Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) initiative as soon as possible,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nSomali officials met to discuss debt relief with officials from the IMF, World Bank and other institutions on Thursday on the sidelines of the IMF and World Bank fall meetings.\n\nGeorgieva said the prime minister reiterated Somalia\u2019s strong commitment to continuing to implement reforms, and also highlighted its completion of the 9th National Development plan.\n\n\u201cMaintaining strong performance, together with support from international partners, will pave the way for Somalia to receive debt relief in the near future,\u201d Georgieva said.\n\nIMF officials this week said work on Somalia\u2019s debt relief effort is progressing well but have given no specific timetable.\n\nIn addition to specific benchmarks that must be met, additional grants are needed to address the country\u2019s debt arrears, Jihad Azour, director of the IMF\u2019s Middle East and Central Asia department, told reporters on Friday.\n\nSomali Finance Minister Abdirahman Duale Beileh said during an event at the Brookings Institution think tank this week that he expected a decision on debt relief in February 2020.\n\n\u201cWe are expecting a decision point in February next year,\u201d Beileh said. \u201cWe have challenges, but more positive than negative.\u201d\n\nStephen Schwartz, who served as U.S. ambassador to Somalia from July 2016 to October 2017, said ensuring debt relief was a top priority for the Somali government for the roughly three years it has been in office.\n\n\u201cGetting debt relief would unlock concessional lending from the international lending institutions, which would give them access to a lot of money that they could put to good use rebuilding Somalia,\u201d Schwartz said.\n\n\u201cIt would be a huge success. It would allow the government to function at a more robust level with more resources. It would be a huge vote of confidence for them and for the Somali people.\u201d", "description": "International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said on Saturday that she supports Somalia's efforts to achieve debt relief through the global lender's Highly Indebted Poor Country program.", "authors": ["Andrea Shalal", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191019&t=2&i=1442701552&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9I0F6", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
