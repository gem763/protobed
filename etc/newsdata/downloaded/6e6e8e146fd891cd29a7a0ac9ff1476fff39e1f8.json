Foley directs the Election Law program at the Ohio State University\u2019s Moritz College of Law, where he also holds the Ebersold Chair in constitutional law.\n\nAsked at the United Nations on Tuesday about the prospect of impeachment, President Donald Trump responded by accusing Democrats of trying to block him from running for reelection because they fear they cannot beat him at the polls. \u201cThey have no idea how they stop me,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only way they can try is through impeachment.\u201d\n\nThis echoes an argument that Trump\u2019s Republican allies\u2014and some Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, before this week\u2014have been making for months: America\u2019s voters should be the ones to render the verdict on Trump\u2019s fitness for office, and Congress should not deprive voters of this right through impeachment.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut this argument lumps together two distinct functions of the impeachment process: removal from office and disqualification from serving again. Under the Constitution, Congress actually could remove the president for the rest of his term while still letting him seek reelection next year. This approach would duly punish Trump for his 2020 election interference\u2014and take such interference off the table\u2014while still deferring to the will of the electorate. That, in turn, might make the idea of conviction more palatable to Senate Republicans.\n\nWait, you might ask, isn\u2019t the whole point of impeachment and conviction to prevent the wrongdoer from ever holding office again? No, in fact. Both the Constitution and the Senate\u2019s procedures treat removal and disqualification from holding future office as separate punishments upon a conviction of impeachment. Article I, section 3, clause 7 of the Constitution states: \u201cJudgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust or profit under the United States.\u201d\n\nThe Senate\u2019s practice in impeachment cases has been to hold separate votes on removal and disqualification. The removal vote is the same as the vote on whether to convict on the charges presented by the House\u2019s referral of impeachment. The Constitution\u2019s threshold for conviction and removal is \u201ctwo-thirds of the [Senators] present.\u201d But disqualification is different. The Senate has long taken the position (not without some controversy) that the vote to disqualify an official from again seeking office requires only a simple majority vote, not the higher two-thirds threshold.\n\nWith respect to the impeachment of federal judges, the Senate has imposed the distinct punishment of disqualification sparingly\u2014only three times in U.S. history. Somewhat more frequent is the fate of Federal District Judge Alcee Hastings, whom the Senate convicted in 1989 and removed from the bench without the separate punishment of disqualification. Hastings, in fact, went on to run for Congress\u2014and won.\n\nTrump\u2019s potential impeachment represents the first time since the ratification of the 22nd Amendment, which established presidential term limits, that the United States faces the prospect of removing a first-term president who is actively seeking reelection. (Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton were both in their second terms.) That means this is also the first time the Senate can consider whether to remove the president separately from disqualifying him. And it should consider this option if Congress truly cares about empowering the voters, through the mechanism of the Electoral College, to decide whether to give the incumbent a second term.\n\nNone of Trump\u2019s previous improprieties\u2014as disgraceful as they are\u2014justified preventing the voters from being the ones to remove Trump from the White House. His 2016 campaign\u2019s \u201ccollusion\u201d with Russia: not sufficiently attributable to him personally, and not involving conduct as an incumbent president. His obstructions of the Trump-Russia investigation: reprehensible, and perhaps even prosecutable after he leaves office, but not sufficient grounds for forcing him out of office before the end of his four-year term. Same point with his Stormy Daniels payments: maybe criminal, but not enough to negate the electoral will of the American people.\n\nThe phone call with the leader of Ukraine\u2014during which Trump requested an investigation into his potential 2020 opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden\u2014is different. Now, we have a first-term president who sought to use the powers of his office to tilt the electoral playing field against the opposition party\u2019s leading challenger. Trump, in other words, has attempted to distort the very remedy that Pelosi and others have been pushing for months as an alternative to impeachment: the idea that the voters, rather than Congress, should decide the president\u2019s fate in the 2020 election.\n\nRemoving Trump from office for the remainder of his term would disable him from abusing presidential power again and protect the integrity of the electoral process from inappropriate interference. At the same time, letting him run for a second term would permit the American electorate to decide whether Trump, despite his attempt to subvert the system, should have another chance. Put another way, removal without disqualification tailors the remedy to the precise problem: letting Trump run, as he did in 2016, without wielding the powers of incumbency, the right to which he has forfeited by his incapacity to simultaneously serve as president and run a fair reelection campaign.\n\nIf Democrats wish to appear principled and not partisan in proceeding with impeachment, they would be wise also to confine themselves to the single charge of the improper Ukraine phone call, rather than seeking to impeach Trump for a wider range of offenses. That way, they justly can say that they are employing impeachment for the sole purpose of protecting the 2020 election from an incumbent\u2019s wrongful efforts to subvert the electorate\u2019s freedom of choice.\n\nBoth Democrats and Republicans should be principled and patriotic when considering the grave matter of impeachment. In this hyperpolarized environment, it might be idealistic to expect Senate Republicans to elevate the integrity of elections over party loyalty. But decoupling removal from disqualification lowers the stakes and changes the constitutional calculus. As long as Trump can run again, Republicans cannot hide behind a claim that they are ones protecting voter choice by opposing impeachment. In that case, what\u2019s the patriotic position for Republicans to take?\n\nIt would seem that if Republicans care about having presidential elections be genuinely free and fair\u2014so that the voters themselves can decide what they want\u2014then patriotism in service of America\u2019s constitutional democracy leads to this conclusion: Remove Trump from office, so that he cannot abuse incumbency to subvert the electoral process, but let the American people make the judgment on whether or not he gets a second term.\n\nThis article tagged under: Opinion\n\n1600 Penn", "description": "Yes, that\u2019s possible.
