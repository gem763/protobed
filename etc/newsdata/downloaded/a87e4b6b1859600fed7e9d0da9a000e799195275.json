Now, as of Monday, the legislation has 73 cosponsors.\n\nThe bill\u2019s growing list of Republican sponsors shows the GOP has moved to defend President Donald Trump against House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\n\nWhen Biggs sponsored the bill, he said Schiff\u2019s stunt was \u201cinexcusable\u201d to \u201cmislead the American public with such a statement.\u201d\n\nHouse Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA), and House Republican Conference chairwoman Liz Cheney (R-WY) have sponsored the resolution to condemn Schiff.\n\nThe 72 Republicans who have cosponsored Biggs\u2019 resolution to condemn Schiff include:\n\nKevin McCarthy Steve Scalise Liz Cheney Tom Emmer Gary Palmer Mark Green Mark Meadows Jeff Duncan Mo Brooks Scott Perry Greg Steube Guy Reschenthaler Rick Crawford Michael Burgess, M.D. Jim Jordan Paul Gosar Bill Posey Warren Davidson Bob Gibbs Jody Hice Ralph Norman Matt Gaetz Ron Wright Louie Gohmert Lance Gooden Ralph Abraham Jim Banks Daniel Meuser Bill Flores Jim Sensenbrenner Randy Weber Tim Burchett Dan Bishop Daniel Webster Mark Walker Michael Cloud Doug Lamborn Fred Keller Elise Stefanik Brian Babin Bradley Byrne Bill Johnson Larry Bucshon Ted Budd Steve King Buddy Carter Debbie Lesko Scott DesJarlais Chuck Fleischmann Roger Marshall, M.D. Mike Rogers Drew Ferguson Steven Palazzo Bruce Westerman Mike Johnson Troy Balderson Steve Watkins Chris Stewart Greg Murphy Greg Gianforte Ben Cline Denver Riggleman Mike Kelly William Timmons Don Bacon Steve Womack Lee Zeldin James Comer Rick Allen Roger Williams John Joyce Steve Stivers Duncan\n\nMcCarthy wrote on Twitter last week:\n\nChairman Adam Schiff has been lying to the American people for years.
