Get Me Out Of Here! 2019 has been confirmed.\n\nThe brand new series will kick off on Sunday 17th November on ITV.\n\nIt will feature an as-yet unconfirmed line-up of celebrities big and small, presented by Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly.\n\nGood Morning Britain host Kate Garraway, Coronation Street's Andrew Whyment and ex-EastEnders star Jacqueline Jossa are all among the big names said to have signed up this year.\n\n(Image: GoffPhotos.com)\n\nIt comes after Autumnwatch presenter Chris Packham called on Ant and Dec to axe the Bushtucker trials this year over claims of cruelty to the animals and insects involved.\n\n\"When I see them being harmed or killed for entertainment, I wonder if we are not in the Middle Ages. It is no different from a circus, you know, and we have got rid of our circuses with wild animals,\" Chris insisted.\n\nIn 2014, he wrote an open letter to hosts Ant McPartlin and Dec Donnelly, asking them to stop \"undermining a respect for life\".\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n\"I have never met Ant and Dec but if I did, I would be chatting about it,\" he went on.\n\n\"People make a lot of money out of this but people made a lot of money out of child labour and slavery other unpleasant things and it didn't continue when they realised they were wrong.\"\n\nAn ITV spokesman said: \"I'm A Celebrity complies with all national and regional laws concerning the use of insects, animals and reptiles.\"\n\nMeanwhile, I'm A Celebrity: Extra Camp host Emily Atack has revealed she's \"worked out\" which stars will be in this year's line-up./\n\nThe former Inbetweeners star, who was in the main camp last year alongside King of the Jungle Harry Redknapp, said she's thrilled to be heading back Down Under.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"I'm so excited to go back somewhere that just changed my life,\" she told Digital Spy at this year's Pride Of Britain Awards.\n\n\"I can't wait. That place for me, I just have the best connection and I can't wait. I would have been heartbroken if I didn't have anything to do with it this year. I would have been so jealous seeing everyone go in.\n\n\"It couldn't have got better than that. I was the luckiest person in the world to have what I had. I truly hope that the people that go in this year are as happy as I was as that makes the experience.\"\n\nShe went on: \"I couldn't possibly say. I know a couple but I haven't had anything confirmed to me but I worked things out because I am clever. I can't say [who I'd like to go in] because then you'll think it's a hint.\n\n\"If it was anyone in the world, get Bradley Cooper in those little pants in the shower. Dream man.\"\n\n*I'm A Celebrity returns on Sunday November 17 at 9pm on ITV", "description": "Ant and Dec will be back next month to present the brand new I'm A Celeb series on ITV", "authors": ["Emmeline Saunders", "Image", "Goffphotos.Com", "Itv", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20260973.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_ITV-Plc.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
