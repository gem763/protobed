We have gone overdrawn into our account by \u00a3323, we don't even have a overdraft.\n\n\"We literally have been left with nothing.\"\n\n(Image: Daily Post Wales)\n\nOthers argued that people should have checked their bank accounts and budgeted properly.\n\nBut one woman said: \"I write down all my direct debits, standing orders etc but I also have grown up children who I lend money to and who pay back for catalogues etc so I tick things off as I go along.\n\n\"I was stung for \u00a3250 over about 10 transactions so no, never noticed \u00a320 or \u00a312 etc not going out.\n\n\"Luckily, we have some savings but not everyone has. Please don't judge, just be grateful it's not you.\"\n\nRhyl pensioner, Stuart Gladwell, who had \u00a3450 taken from his account this week said such shocks could be \"potentially disastrous\" to people his age.\n\n(Image: Daily Post Wales)\n\nHe emailed Aldi to say: \"I am massively disgusted with the way you have handled this matter.\n\n\"You should have stopped taking card payments as soon as you realised you had the problem.\n\n\"Tracking outstanding payments that do not appear as outstanding on one's bank account is difficult to say the least.\n\n\"I thought I owed around \u00a3270 but it turned out to be \u00a3450, a massive shock to me.\n\n\"As a 73-year-old pensioner, shocks like that are potentially disastrous.\"\n\nMr Gladwell added: \"I have been lucky that my family helped me out. Many others will not be so lucky.\n\n\"You could, and indeed should, have given much more than one days' notice of your intention to take the money and staggered the payments.\n\n(Image: Daily Post Wales)\n\n\"A not very happy customer.\"\n\nAldi responded to the pensioner to say: \"Thank you for taking the time to contact Aldi Customer Services regarding our Rhyl store.\n\n\"The transactions will be submitted on October 2 and customers will see the payments come out of their accounts from October 3.\n\n\"This may take a few days to come out of your account. Regrettably, we are unable to delay these payments.\n\n\"We sincerely apologise for any inconvenience caused.\n\n\"Once again thank you for taking the time to contact us. We value your custom and hope you will continue to shop with us.\"", "description": "One man says \u00a3450 vanished from his bank account in one go after an Aldi 'technical issue' meant payments were processed late", "authors": ["Kelly Williams", "Lucy John", "Image", "Daily Post Wales"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20466311.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_The-new-Aldi-store-at-Cei-Marina-Quay-retail-park-in-Rhyl-is-expected-to-open-soon-Image-David-Pow.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
