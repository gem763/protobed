The foundation selects the ones with the greatest need to receive donations, Nelson said.\n\nFundraising will continue through December, then the first of the trees will be planted in January, starting in warmer climates like Florida and Texas, Nelson said, and eventually reach every continent except Antarctica. Not all the trees will survive, but the Arbor Day Foundation predicts only a 3% mortality rate.\n\nThe foundation usually racks up big donations from other large organizations, but Nelson said working with the YouTube community means #TeamTrees is generating small contributions from a massive audience.\n\n\"This is by far the fastest climb to $8 million in individual, single donations that the Arbor Day Foundation has ever seen,\" Nelson said. \"Just to have it be so viral and to get so many small donations from individuals \u2026 it's just making so many people feel really good.\"\n\n'This is like the Avengers of YouTube': Hundreds of influencers have joined the movement\n\nNelson credited the success of the campaign to YouTubers, starting with Donaldson, who personally messaged content creators he knew \u2014 many from his YouTuber Battle Royale, Duchscher said \u2014 to explain the initiative and get them on board.\n\nInfluencers like Ninja,\u200b \u200b\u200bMarshmello\u200b, Jeffree Star\u200b, and \u200bJoey Graceffa\u200b have already announced their involvement with the project, and Duchscher said hundreds more will soon follow in order to keep the conversation going.\n\n\"This is like the Avengers of YouTube, if the Avengers planted trees,\" Rober said in a statement.\n\nWhile the movement started out as a \"completely random\" Reddit post, Duchscher said, #TeamTrees hopes it will continue to spark larger conversations about global issues like climate change.\n\n\"We know that planting 20 million trees isn't going to save the environment, but it's a step in the right direction,\" Duchscher said.", "description": "Jimmy Donaldson wanted to commemorate reaching 20 million subscribers on YouTube.
