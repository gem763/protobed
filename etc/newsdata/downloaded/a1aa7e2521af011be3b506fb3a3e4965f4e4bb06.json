The streaming network announced on Monday a formal green light for the fourth installment of its sci-fi smash from creators Matt and Ross Duffer. Not so coincidentally, Netflix has also signed the Duffer Brothers to a multiyear deal to make movies and TV shows. While there\u2019s no official word on when Stranger Things 4 will debut, given the production realities of the big-budget epic, the next installment will almost certainly not arrive until 2021 at the earliest. But Netflix and the Duffers are offering a clue about the new season, hinting in a renewal-announcement video that the show will be headed beyond Hawkins.\n\nMost of the 35-second clip released Monday is a slow-motion reveal of the show\u2019s logo set against audio of its iconic theme, but the last few seconds tease where the show is (literally) going: \u201cWe\u2019re Not in Hawkins Anymore.\u201d This appears to confirm what the Duffer Brothers teased after season three\u2019s release this summer. \u201cI think the biggest thing that\u2019s going to happen is it\u2019s going to open up a little bit, not necessarily in terms of scale, in terms of special effects, but open up in terms of allowing plotlines into areas outside of Hawkins,\u201d Matt Duffer told EW in July.\n\nMonday\u2019s announcement didn\u2019t label season four as the show\u2019s last chapter the way recent renewal and premiere date announcements for GLOW and BoJack Horseman have been tagged with finale language. This doesn\u2019t mean Stranger Things 4 won\u2019t mark the end, but as of now, it doesn\u2019t appear as if it\u2019s being planned as such. As for the Duffers, their new Netflix pact will let the duo expand beyond the Stranger Things universe both with projects they directly create and, potentially, by collaborating with other writers and directors. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait to see what The Duffer Brothers have in store when they step outside the world of The Upside Down,\u201d Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos said in a statement released Monday. The brothers, meanwhile, thanked Netflix execs for taking \u201ca huge chance on us and our show \u2026 We can\u2019t wait to tell many more stories together \u2014 beginning, of course, with a return trip to Hawkins!\u201d", "description": "Stranger Things 4 is officially a go at Netflix.
