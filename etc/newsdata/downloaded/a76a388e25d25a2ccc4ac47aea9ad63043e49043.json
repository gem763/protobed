And when asked if that might mean Rumpole returning as a woman, she teased: \u2018You\u2019ll have to wait and see.\u2019\n\nThe 47-year-old added in an interview with The Times: \u2018It\u2019s an onerous responsibility in a way, but it\u2019s been such fun to write. It\u2019s such a nice way of remembering our dad and realising how radical the character was.\u2019\n\nThe new take on Rumpole will be set in the modern day, and though Miss Mortimer will not be drawn on specifics, it promises a \u2018plan\u2019 for the barrister\u2019s feared wife Hilda \u2013 known in the classic TV series as \u2018she who must be obeyed\u2019 and never seen on-screen. Rumpole\u2019s timeless, cigar-loving character was played in the TV series that ran from 1978 to 1992 by Australian-born McKern, who died in 2002 aged 82.\n\nNew episodes are now being written by actress Emily Mortimer, whose father Sir John Mortimer, wrote both the scripts for the original series and the books on which they were based\n\nActress Patricia Hodge also made regular appearances as QC Phyllida Erskine-Brown.\n\nJodie Whittaker is the first actress to play Doctor Who\n\nEager for a follow-up, producers have repeatedly approached Sir John\u2019s second wife Penelope \u2013 Miss Mortimer\u2019s mother \u2013 about the rights. Oxford-educated Miss Mortimer, who played Mrs Banks in last year\u2019s blockbuster remake of Mary Poppins, had never considered getting involved in the project until her American agent suggested she consider try writing. Not wanting to take on the mammoth task alone, the mother-of-two felt it was right to do it with her sister.\n\n\u2018Rumpole\u2019s broad-minded, forgiving attitude is so refreshing when you read those stories again,\u2019 she said. \u2018I felt so proud of my dad from reading them. I just hope we don\u2019t f*** it up, obviously.\u2019\n\nThe character of the crumply old barrister was widely believed to be based in large part on Sir John Mortimer himself. The QC\u2019s distinguished legal career included such landmark cases as the notorious Oz obscenity trial in the 1971, when he successfully defended the editors of the underground magazine.\n\nHe was also celebrated for his script for the ITV adaptation of Brideshead Revisited, starring Jeremy Irons. Sir John died aged 85 in 2009. The reboot will be produced by Miss Mortimer\u2019s own company King Bee and eOne.\n\nPolly Williams, eOne\u2019s head of scripted development, let slip in March that something was in the pipeline.", "description": "Leo McKern played Rumpole of the Bailey in the classic ITV drama from the 70s.
