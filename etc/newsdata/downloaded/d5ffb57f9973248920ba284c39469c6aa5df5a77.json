Trump has also asked them to keep him posted when they will appear on television shows and conservative media, according to two people with knowledge of the conversations.\n\nAs for Giuliani, the president sees the former New York City mayor as the tip of the spear in a scorched-earth media strategy. In a conversation on Wednesday, sources say, Trump told Giuliani to keep going on the offense, and signed off on him telling the press that he was actively \u201cconsidering\u201d litigation against a number of people, first and foremost Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), chair of the House Intelligence Committee who has led a probe into the whistleblower complaint at the center of the impeachment probe now roiling the Trump administration.\n\nAnd Giuliani, for his part, is more than happy to acquiesce to the president\u2019s request.\n\nShortly after his chat with Trump, Giuliani got on the phone with Eric Bolling, a BlazeTV and Sinclair host, to ask the fellow Trump associate if he could get booked on the Sinclair broadcast America This Week.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to do the show,\u201d Giuliani said, Bolling recalled. Giuliani pitched the host on possibly breaking some news on a potential Trump lawsuit against Schiff, and cited Sinclair\u2019s wide household reach and large audience for why he wanted to do it.\n\nTo make room for Giuliani, Bolling said he had to dump a segment just hours before taping that was set to feature a liberal-versus-conservative debate on climate change.\n\nGiuliani did not respond to messages seeking comment on this story on Thursday.\n\nThe shock and awe strategy has left prominent figures in Trumpworld rather perplexed. During his recent media blitz, Giuliani has, for instance, appeared on Laura Ingraham\u2019s Fox News show to publicly implicate senior administration officials in the Ukraine-and-Biden-related scandal threatening to blow up the Trump era. On Ingraham\u2019s program last week, Giuliani turned the audience\u2019s attention to text messages he\u2019d exchanged with Kurt Volker, the U.S. special representative for Ukraine.\n\nLess than 24 hours later, Volker resigned his post.\n\nGiuliani\u2019s media crusade has angered Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who went as far as asking an aide if contacting Giuliani to request that he dial things back was a viable option, as The Daily Beast reported last week. It\u2019s unclear if Pompeo or other officials at State have discussed this with Giuliani since then.\n\n\u201cThere are people working in [Trump\u2019s West Wing] who feel that what Rudy does and how he does it is often wildly unhelpful and unwise,\u201d said a senior administration official on Thursday. \u201cBut the president loves the guy. So nobody is going to lay a hand on him as he goes on Hannity and\u2014I dunno\u2014reads out State [Department] officials\u2019 email passwords, or whatever is coming next week.\u201d\n\nStill, the collateral damage hasn\u2019t bothered President Trump, at least not enough to try to keep Giuliani away from the cameras and off of primetime.\n\nTrump\u2019s other TV-prone lawyer has taken a slightly different, yet no less aggressive, approach.\n\nSekulow\u2014who, like Giuliani, serves as a top personal attorney to the president and defended Trump during Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s two-year investigation\u2014is also involved in the planning discussions with Trump and Giuliani on a possible suit against Schiff and others, the sources noted. It is unclear, at least for now, how much farther this threat will actually go.\n\nSekulow confirmed to The Daily Beast on Thursday afternoon his role in preparing a potential lawsuit, adding that \u201call options are on the table,\u201d and that any legal action or court challenge would center on due process issues and constitutional rights of the president. He declined, however, to go into details of his private conversations with Trump.\n\nEver since returning to the White House after a swing through New York City last week, Trump and his top aides have stated that there is no need for a \u201cwar room\u201d or special effort in the West Wing to combat the Democratic Party\u2019s ongoing impeachment push. This has come to the quiet consternation of some allies of the president, who believe that Trump needs to be taking this threat to his administration and its agenda more seriously.\n\nAsked about the impeachment \u201cwar room\u201d chatter, Sekulow replied, \u201cI think of this as a skirmish.\u201d He added, \u201cThere is no need for a war room at this time.\u201d", "description": "Rudy Giuliani\u2014and to a lesser extent Jay Sekulow\u2014has been the president\u2019s first line of defense in an increasingly serious impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Asawin Suebsaeng", "White House Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570168698/191003-Swin-Rudy-tease_m0502u", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
