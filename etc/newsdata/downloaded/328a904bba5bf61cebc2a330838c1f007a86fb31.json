But Trump has been slow to cobble together a response, convinced he has no need for a separate impeachment team and confident in his own ability to counter-message Democrats, multiple sources close to the White House told CNN.\n\nSix days after Pelosi\u2019s announcement, there is now a growing concern among the President\u2019s allies that he doesn\u2019t understand the implications of what lies ahead or how quickly it\u2019s moving.\n\nTrump spent the weekend on the phone with aides and allies, railing against the whistleblower and those who provided the person with information related to his phone calls with foreign leaders, according to people familiar with the conversations\u2026\n\nA Republican congressional aide said there is a sense on Capitol Hill that things are heading in a bad direction for Trump.\n\n\u201cWe are entering a phase with a lot of unknowns.
