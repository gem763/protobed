The exchange between the pair got 'heated' and they opted to 'just be friends' after Jessie (pictured) said listening to him was like, 'nails down a chalkboard'\n\nEarlier, when Jessie asked Maurice (pictured) what he wanted out of the experience of being on Love Island, he claimed: 'I haven't been in a relationship for a while' and insisted he was looking for love\n\nShe also said she was blindsided to soon discover he was a contestant on Love Island Australia.\n\n'I'm getting so many messages from you guys asking what the hell is happening, and why are they seeing my 'boyfriend' all over the ads and everything to do with a dating show,' the Instagram model began.\n\n'If you go and have a look you should be able to see from all my socials... I have been dating a guy for the past few months now named Maurice,' she explained.\n\n'My boyfriend dumped me for Love Island Australia!'

Yes. We were together within that [six month] time frame,' she declared.\n\nShe then turned to the question of whether she knew Maurice would be on Love Island before he dumped her.\n\nIt's war! Christie savagely labelled Maurice (pictured) as 'trash' on Instagram during Monday night's premiere\n\n'I had no idea he was going on the dating show, whatsoever. But he came to me while we were together saying that [Channel Nine had] asked him to go on the [television] ad [for Love Island].'\n\nExplaining that Maurice has always had aspirations to become an actor, Christie said she didn't hesitate to encourage him to appear in the advertisement.\n\n'He's wanted to be an actor, he does a little bit of acting as a side job. When the ad was released, everyone was messaging me saying, 'Oh my god is Maurice going on Love Island?' And I was like, 'No it's just the ad he's just an actor',' she explained.\n\n'We were together within that time frame!' In the video she claimed that Maurice had lied in his official Love Island bio when he claimed he's been single for six months\n\n'About one week after he's gone on this ad, he's broken it off with me!' she exclaimed, adding that his sudden dumping was 'completely out of the blue'.\n\n'His excuse was saying that he puts work first and he can't really prioritise me,' she said.\n\nThe social media star then addressed the question of whether Maurice had applied to appear on Love Island Australia while they were still dating.\n\n'He's wanted to be an actor!' Explaining that Maurice (right) has always had aspirations to become an actor, Christie (left) said she didn't hesitate to encourage him to appear in the advertisement\n\nPointing out that the show is based in Fiji, Christie said: 'You have to apply for your visa two weeks before you travel there.'\n\n'Maurice would have had to apply for his visa, keep his passport and apparently you even have to apply for the Love Island position itself months in advance.'\n\n'So if that is all the case he would have 100 per cent have had to apply for this while we were together,' she added.\n\nChristie also accused Maurice of being fame hungry, but insisted that he's not a 'bad person'.\n\n'I know his intentions were never to hurt me': Christie also accused Maurice of being fame hungry, but insisted that he's not a 'bad person'\n\n'This guy loved fame, loved it! And as soon as he's had any chance to have more fame, to be able to put himself out there, he's just taken it,' she said.\n\n'I know his intentions were never to hurt me, hence why he's broken it off with me and then gone on this show.'\n\nMaurice features prominently on Christie's Instagram page, and is seen in various amorous poses with the blonde.\n\nThe last photo of the couple was uploaded to her page in August.", "description": "Love Island\u00a0Australia's\u00a0Maurice\u00a0Salib's ex-girlfriend Christie Swadling claimed on Tuesday that he dumped her two weeks before appearing on the show.", "authors": ["Marta Jary For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/12/19439144-0-image-a-26_1570532621445.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
