Both Kate Daly (left) and Lakaree Smith (right) almost slipped right out of their ensembles at the Dally M Medal\n\nNRLW player Ali Briggenshaw - who was woman of the match at the 2017 Women's Rugby League World Cup Final - kept things chic in a black trouser and matching jacket, but it was her partner Kate Daly's more revealing number that had cameras flashing in their direction.\n\nThe gorgeous blonde had chosen to forgo a shirt under her velvet orange suit, but the decision almost left her to suffer a wardrobe malfunction in front of fans.\n\nShe narrowly escaped flashing the paparazzi but did manage to tone down her brightly coloured suit with a black clutch and bronze makeup.\n\nMelbourne Storm's Josh Addo-Carr seemingly forgot to tell his gorgeous girlfriend Lakaree Smith that the tape she was using to prevent an accidental nip slip was showing.\n\nSadly her Hollywood Tape was on full display as they walked across the red carpet.\n\nBrittney McGlone, who attended the special night with her Penrith Panthers' playing husband James Tamou, wowed the audience in a princess-inspired lavender gown and a matching fascinator (right) while Vessa Rockliff (left) gave the crowd too much train\n\nSharks footballer Paul Gallen's wife Anne seemed to be testing out the metallic trend that stylists have been heralding as the tone to try for spring, but she didn't quite nail it in the chain mail shade\n\nBrittney McGlone, who attended the special night with her Penrith Panthers' playing husband James Tamou, wowed the audience in a princess-inspired lavender gown and a matching fascinator.\n\nThe billowing sleeves, Kim Kardashian-like patent heels and peephole neckline didn't flatter her stunning figure and the swathes of fabric detracted from Brittney's celebrity smile.\n\nManly Sea Eagles standout Daly Cherry Evans and his long-time partner Vessa Rockliff almost matched in black trousers, but his stunning girlfriend's train and chiffon top stole the show for all the wrong reasons.\n\nVessa was hidden behind the flared fabric and the lack of colour left her blending into the background.\n\nJack Wighton, of the Canberra Raiders, brought his partner Monisha Lew Fatt to the event, who wore a fuchsia ensemble with nude mesh that barely held in her assets\n\nSharks footballer Paul Gallen's wife Anne seemed to be testing out the metallic trend that stylists have been heralding as the tone to try for spring, but she didn't quite nail it in the chain mail shade.\n\nHer gown, while intricately made, was almost entirely see-through and left very little to the imagination.\n\nJack Wighton, of the Canberra Raiders, brought his partner Monisha Lew-Fatt to the event, who wore a fuchsia ensemble with nude mesh that barely held in her assets.\n\nWhile her bag was reminiscent of Paris Hilton's early noughties fashion it didn't blend well with the overall look she was sporting.\n\nThe NRL grand final will air on Sunday October 6 and see the Sydney Roosters take on the Canberra Raiders at ANZ Stadium.", "description": "The NRL's Dally M Medal 2019 went off without a hitch at Sydney's Hordern Pavilion on Wednesday night.", "authors": ["Matilda Rudd For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/02/11/19199416-0-image-a-50_1570013610967.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
