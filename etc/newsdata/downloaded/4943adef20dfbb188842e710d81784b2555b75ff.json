No wonder then that Sergei Shoigu, the Russian defense minister, once described state media as another branch of the armed forces.\n\nAnd so when Russian President Vladimir Putin declared this month that Kremlin-funded television channels should give Ukraine a break, it was seen by many as something of a stand-down in his country\u2019s conflict with Kyiv.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t paint our closest neighbor, this fraternal nation ... in an unflattering light,\u201d Putin told the Valdai discussion club, an annual gathering of Russian and Western foreign policy experts. \u201cThis is wrong.\u201d He admitted that there was \u201csomething lacking\u201d in Russian state television\u2019s coverage of Ukraine.\n\nTarget audience\n\nPutin\u2019s eyebrow-raising comments underscored a thaw in relations between the two former Soviet states since Volodymyr Zelenskiy, a 41-year-old former comedian, came to power in Ukraine in May.\n\nLast month, in a long-awaited development, the two countries exchanged dozens of prisoners, including 24 Ukrainian sailors seized by Russia during a naval clash in the Black Sea. And then, on October 1, Ukraine agreed to hold elections in its war-torn eastern regions controlled by Kremlin-backed separatists. It\u2019s a move that could bring an end to a five-year conflict that has killed more than 13,000 people and displaced another million.\n\nPutin had insisted on elections \u2014 part of a deal signed in Belarus by Russia, Ukraine, separatist representatives and the Organization for Security and Cooperation \u2014 as a condition for his participation in peace talks brokered by France and Germany. The Kremlin denies sending troops to eastern Ukraine\u2019s Donbas region, and insists that any Russians fighting on the side of separatist forces are \u201cvolunteers,\u201d despite ample evidence to the contrary.\n\nEven before Putin\u2019s remarks, Russian state television had been toning down its aggression. The term \u201cjunta\u201d had all but disappeared from broadcasts, while on September 15, in a notable departure from usual programming, there was not a single report devoted to Ukraine on either of the two main weekly news round-ups.\n\n\u201cPriorities have changed,\u201d said Denis Volkov, deputy director of the Levada Center think tank. \u201cThere is a desire to improve relations with Europe to get sanctions scrapped. And for this, there needs to be some progress on the issue of eastern Ukraine. Putin\u2019s comments were a signal more for a Western audience than a domestic audience.\u201d\n\nCounter-programming\n\nAlthough the Kremlin insists that European and U.S. sanctions imposed after Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 haven\u2019t damaged its economy, a majority of Russian business leaders think otherwise, according to a recent PwC survey. The real disposable incomes of Russians have declined every year since the sanctions were introduced.\n\n\u201cIf sanctions can be eliminated by political compromise, then Putin will go for this. Donbass is not of such great value in [and] of itself for the Kremlin,\u201d said Alexander Baunov, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Moscow Center think-tank. \u201cIt\u2019s not Crimea.\u201d\n\nThe deal agreed in Belarus is known as the Steinmeier Formula, after Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the former German foreign minister who first proposed it in 2016. Under its terms, the two \u201cpeople\u2019s republics\u201d in the Donbass region will be granted self-governing status within Ukraine after elections judged free and fair by OSCE monitors. The deal also stipulates the withdrawal of forces by both sides and that Ukraine will regain control of its border with Russia.\n\n\u201cThe Steinmeier Formula is more or less what Putin wants,\u201d said Baunov. \u201cPutin\u2019s plan from the beginning was never the annexation of the Donbass. The goal was the federalization of Ukraine, making it less centralized, to make Ukraine weaker, to force the government in Kyiv to listen more to Moscow.\u201d\n\nPutin\u2019s orders to television chiefs to tone down the rhetoric is partly a bid to prepare Russians psychologically for the reintegration \u2014 at least on paper \u2014 of the Donbass into Ukraine. \u201cThis is a signal that Ukraine is not the hell on earth that it was painted to be. After all, we can\u2019t reintegrate Donbass into Ukraine if the country is some neo-Nazi hell,\u201d said Baunov. \u201cThey are trying to show people that Ukraine is not the same as it was in the Maidan era.\u201d\n\nStay tuned\n\nEven though both Kyiv and Moscow seem determined to de-escalate, the path to a resolution of the Donbass conflict is unlikely to be smooth. Dmitry Oreshkin, an independent political analyst in Moscow, told Ukrainian media that the Steinmeier Formula was \u201cno radical breakthrough,\u201d and that the Kremlin would attempt to maintain control over the region through proxies and manipulation of elections. The deal with Russia has also sparked protests by nationalists in Kyiv.\n\nSeparatist leaders have also warned Zelenskiy that the elections will take place on their terms and vowed not to surrender control of the border with Russia. It was a message hammered home by Alexei Chesnakov, a former member of the Kremlin administration who continues to advise the Russian authorities on Ukraine.\n\n\u201cWe need to be realists,\u201d Chesnakov told Tass, the Russian state news agency. \u201cIn the final reckoning, Ukraine will have symbolic sovereignty over the Donbass. It shouldn\u2019t count on anything else.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s still plenty of room for things to go wrong. Last Thursday, Zelenskiy accused Russia of not doing enough to ensure a pullback of separatist forces from the Donbass frontline ahead of the planned peace summit. Yury Ushakov, Putin's top foreign policy adviser, blamed Ukraine. The row wasn\u2019t enough to derail the peace process, but it was an ominous start.\n\nSince Putin\u2019s comments, Russian state television has stayed on message on Ukraine, with few if any signs of the full-on Orwellian hysteria that once characterized its broadcasts. But all that could change rapidly, if the nascent peace process collapses or if Western sanctions against Moscow remain in place, said Volkov, the Levada Center analyst.\n\n\u201cA positive model of Ukraine could be more advantageous for the Kremlin than a negative one,\u201d Volkov said. \u201cBut if things don\u2019t work out, Ukraine will continue to be portrayed as an enemy. This is all very cynical.\u201d\n\nKeep watching the screens.", "description": "Russian president paving way for end to conflict with Kyiv.", "authors": ["Marc Bennetts", "Ben Schreckinger", "Paul Dallison"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1175261898-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
