The question is whether it makes a difference at the ballot box\n\nSonia Khan seemed exactly the kind of young woman likely to prosper under Boris Johnson. A passionate Brexiter who cut her political teeth campaigning for lower taxes, at 27 she was already a veteran of several Whitehall departments, including the Treasury. When he became chancellor, Sajid Javid snapped her up. Then, last week, her career ended in the most brutal of ways; escorted out of No 10 by the police, after being summarily sacked by prime ministerial adviser Dominic Cummings in a manner that her former boss Philip Hammond suggested could win her an employment tribunal case should she choose to bring one.\n\nWorse still, Khan, whose loyalties were seemingly questioned because of her contacts with old friends in the rebellious Hammond\u2019s camp, was the fourth female aide forced out by the new regime. \u201cHow someone could think that escorting a young Asian woman out with an armed police officer was good optics beggars belief,\u201d says a female former Tory staffer. She points out that the idea of what one anonymous Tory source called \u201cbig thuggy bald blokes picking on girls\u201d is a gift to opposition MPs busy painting Johnson\u2019s wider regime as aggressive, unreconstructed and full of dubious attitudes to women.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sonia Khan, who was escorted out of Downing Street by police.

The Labour frontbencher Cat Smith, who was with Corbyn, tweeted that at first she just thought there was \u201csome loud bloke who stunk of booze yelling at us\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dominic Cummings, whose sacking of Sonia Khan has caused controversy. Photograph: James Veysey/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nBut in an era where behavioural norms and political conventions are being rewritten overnight, the question is whether the charge \u2013 fair or unfair \u2013 of having a \u201cwoman problem\u201d still carries an electoral price for Tory leaders. Will it matter at the ballot boxes that Johnson scrapped an inquiry ordered by Theresa May into Mark Field, the Tory MP filmed manhandling a female protester out of a smart City dinner? Do potential Tory voters care that he compared women wearing burqas to letterboxes, or once suggested the best way to deal with a female colleague\u2019s advice was to \u201cpat her on the bottom and send her on her way\u201d?\n\nWhen David Cameron told the Labour MP Angela Eagle to \u201cCalm down, dear\u201d in the Commons, the accusations of sexism lasted for days. But have the goalposts changed, in an era now so polarised that Donald Trump can seemingly dismiss an allegation of rape \u2013 levelled in the journalist E Jean Carroll\u2019s memoirs \u2013 and watch the news cycle move on?\n\nHe may now be cast as the cartoon villain of this administration, but when Cummings began work in 2002 for the then Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith, fear was arguably the last thing he inspired in female colleagues. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t even manage his own life,\u201d says one. \u201cHe used to wash his shirts in the office and hang them up in front of his desk, so you\u2019d have to come through a line of dripping wet shirts to speak to him.\u201d It didn\u2019t last: Cummings left within months, frustrated that shadow cabinet ministers wouldn\u2019t adopt his radical ideas.\n\nIt was a different story when Michael Gove, then shadow education secretary, hired him as an adviser in 2007. After Gove moved from opposition to head up the Department for Education in 2010, Cummings was initially kept at arm\u2019s length, but shortly after he formally joined the department in 2011, allegations of him intimidating civil servants began to emerge. They were denied, but it is a pattern some see repeated now in his treatment of Khan and his reported response to fellow special advisers that if they didn\u2019t like his methods they could \u201cfuck off\u201d.\n\nYet the idea that he picks on women is, say those who have worked with him, untrue. \u201cIf he likes you and thinks you\u2019re on side, he\u2019ll work very effectively with you; if he thinks you\u2019re disloyal or useless, he can be extremely unpleasant, but he did that to men and women,\u201d says a longstanding former colleague. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a woman problem, I think it\u2019s a \u2018people he doesn\u2019t like\u2019 problem.\u201d\n\nHis pet hates include perceived stupidity, laziness, or ideas being blocked for seemingly vague reasons, which may explain No 10\u2019s sudden appetite for ripping up unwritten rules and conventions. But Cummings was close to like-minded female members of the Gove set, including the free schools champion Rachel Wolf (married to his old friend, the lobbyist James Frayne) and the adviser Elena Narozanski, now back in No 10 advising on education; he also rated civil servant Victoria Woodcock highly enough to recruit her as Vote Leave\u2019s director of operations, arguing subsequently that, without her, they might not have won.\n\n\u201cOf all the accusations you could hurl at him, being a sexist is actually the least of it,\u201d says Gisela Stuart, the former Labour MP who chaired Vote Leave. \u201cWith Dom, you deliver or you don\u2019t deliver; things are good if you do, and not good if you don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nNor has there ever been a whiff of personal sleaze around Cummings, by all accounts happily married to the journalist Mary Wakefield. The same, however, cannot be said for his boss.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tory MP Mark Field manhandled a protester at a City dinner.

Co-written by the magazine\u2019s theatre critic Toby Young, it featured not only Johnson\u2019s affair with the columnist Petronella Wyatt \u2013 which ended in him being fired from the Tory frontbench for lying about it \u2013 but the Spectator publisher Kimberly Quinn\u2019s affair with the cabinet minister David Blunkett and the then deputy editor Rod Liddle\u2019s extramarital affair with a 22-year-old receptionist.\n\nLiddle\u2019s now ex-wife, the broadcaster Rachel Royce, subsequently attacked what she called an \u201call lads together\u201d culture at the magazine; in Sonia Purnell\u2019s biography Just Boris, she describes famously riotous champagne-fuelled parties \u201cfull of young things in short dresses, high heels and lipstick and the men flirting with them and ignoring their wives. I just felt that Boris was running the whole place like a knocking shop.\u201d None of this stopped Johnson being elected mayor in 2008.\n\nHis move to London City Hall initially heralded a more statesmanlike phase (although within a year he was to begin an relationship with unpaid arts adviser Helen Macintyre). While most of his senior appointments were male, a recurring theme in his career, he did hire the highly regarded transport expert Isabel Dedring, plus a bright young Oxford graduate named Munira Mirza to cover culture (Mirza now runs his policy unit at No 10).\n\n\u201cI look at him now and he\u2019s got a bunch of lads around him,\u201d says a colleague from that era. \u201cBut it was much more balanced in those days. They weren\u2019t the kind of women who would put up with any mischief.\u201d Yet Jennette Arnold, leader of the London Assembly Labour group, publicly complained of his \u201cdisrespectful, patronising way at meetings\u201d with female assembly members, while some City Hall staff recall a boys\u2019 school culture of risque jokes and Oxbridge ties.\n\nThroughout his career, Johnson has tended to get on with a certain type of woman; robust, not overly politically correct, dismissive of liberal shibboleths. Mirza famously criticised May\u2019s audit of racial disparities in public services as self-flagellatory, and the new Downing Street recruit Chloe Westley, now heading Johnson\u2019s social media team, argued in a recent article defending the academic Jordan Peterson against charges of misogyny that young women had been \u201cmisled by feminists\u201d into thinking they faced discrimination over pay.\n\nHis inner circle in Downing Street, meanwhile, remains resolutely male compared with Cameron\u2019s or May\u2019s: this week\u2019s spending review was presented, unusually, by an all-male Treasury ministerial lineup despite concerns about the impact of excluding women from economic policy-making.\n\nAs Dr Mary Ann Stephenson, head of the Women\u2019s Budget Group, which analyses the gender impact of economic policy, points out, it has been accepted wisdom for years now that ministerial teams should be mixed in order to better reflect the reality of ordinary lives: \u201cI can\u2019t understand why this lesson needs to be relearned. I remember talking about this in the 90s.\u201d But the emerging hallmark of the Johnson regime is that no conventional wisdom should be taken for granted, perhaps particularly not in the wake of a female PM many female voters did not feel served them well.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The remain campaign fielded an all-female team \u2013 Nicola Sturgeon, Angela Eagle and Amber Rudd \u2013 to debate with Johnson on TV. Photograph: Matt Frost/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWhen the remain campaign confirmed it was fielding an all-female team of Amber Rudd, Nicola Sturgeon and Angela Eagle for a televised referendum debate against Boris Johnson, the rationale seemed obvious; they judged female voters to be his achilles heel. Rudd\u2019s jibe that Boris might be fun at a party, but wasn\u2019t the man to drive you home \u2013 seen as a deliberate dig at his private life \u2013 was deemed the zinger of the night and she was acclaimed a Tory leader-in-waiting. But three years on, she serves in Johnson\u2019s cabinet, awkwardly dodging questions about why she won\u2019t rule out a no-deal Brexit, a reminder that Johnson\u2019s supposed \u201cwoman problem\u201d is more complicated than it looks.\n\nHis net favourability rating is indeed higher among men than among women, with YouGov reporting a gap of eight points in August. But that may at least partly reflect the fact that women were more likely to vote remain in 2016, and are now more anxious about a no-deal Brexit. Dig deeper, and there is surprisingly little hard evidence that Johnson\u2019s behaviour specifically alienates female voters.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just not much evidence to suggest that women feel differently from men about him,\u201d says Deborah Mattinson, CEO of Britain Thinks, which will next week publish the findings of focus groups conducted with women in Reading and Liverpool. \u201cThe big divide is age \u2013 older people like him more than younger ones, and leavers like him more than remainers.\u201d Both sexes question his integrity, she says, but find him charismatic; focus groups generally shrug off the breakdown of his marriage to wife Marina or his new girlfriend Carrie Symonds\u2019 move into No 10. \u201cThey\u2019ll say: \u2018Look, this is 2019, people don\u2019t necessarily live happily ever.\u2019\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Johnson in 2015 when mayor of London, with Jennette Arnold and members of the British armed forces.

But it may not actively shift votes in a snap election where Brexit overshadows everything.\n\nYet if the Khan affair has any lingering significance, it is in uniting the charge \u2013 fair or unfair \u2013 of sexism, with the idea of a regime playing fast and loose with the rules, rather like a tech bro startup whose culture of being too hip for HR soon turns toxic. \u201cIt fits with the narrative that the government doesn\u2019t have to obey the law; they\u2019re going to prorogue parliament if they want, they\u2019re not sure if they\u2019re going to follow employment law, the law is for everyone else and not for them,\u201d says a female former Tory staffer. Some will always thrill to the idea that rules exist to be broken.
