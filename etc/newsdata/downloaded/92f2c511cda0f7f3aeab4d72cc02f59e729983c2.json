The results come from the European Environment Agency\u2019s Air Quality in Europe 2019 report, published on Wednesday, which collates data taken from thousands of monitoring stations in 2017.\n\n\u201cWe do not see any big improvement, or worsening, year on year,\u201d said Alberto Gonzalez Ortiz, air quality expert at the EEA, Europe\u2019s environmental watchdog. \u201cIt is PM2.5 that we should worry most about, and it is coming from domestic heating [such as wood-burning stoves], industry and transport.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, the latest year for which an accurate count can be made, there were about 412,000 deaths in Europe from PM2.5 alone, according to the EEA. From 2014 to 2017, the levels of fine particulate matter remained broadly flat, after long-term reductions in levels of the pollutant stretching back to 2000.\n\nNitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels have fallen further, but remain a serious problem. Nitrogen dioxide is an irritant gas, emitted from diesel vehicles in particular. In 2017, according to the report, about 10% of monitoring stations in Europe showed levels above safety limits. In the UK, the monitoring station at Marylebone Road continued to record the highest level of nitrogen dioxide pollution in western Europe, despite falls in the overall concentrations of the gas.\n\nJenny Bates, air pollution campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cPeople across the UK are paying a heavy price for the government\u2019s continuing failure to clean up the nation\u2019s filthy air, with tens of thousands of premature deaths every year. While half of our European neighbours manage to comply with legal limits for toxic NO2 pollution, 36 out of 43 UK air quality zones continue to suffer unlawful levels. And we\u2019re also failing World Health Organization standards for the most deadly fine particle air pollution [PM2.5] in places across the country.\u201d\n\nThe government has pledged to bring forward air quality commitments in new legislation announced in the Queen\u2019s speech on Monday. A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said more recent data than that included in the EEA report showed \u201cpositive progress\u201d, including one fewer road showing breaches in safe levels of NO2 in 2018 compared with 2017.\n\n\u201cWe are working hard to reduce transport emissions and are already investing \u00a33.5bn to clean up our air, while our Clean Air Strategy has been praised by the WHO as an \u2018example for the rest of the world to follow\u2019,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cOur environment bill will drive further improvements, increasing local powers to address key sources of air pollution and introducing a duty to set a legally-binding target to reduce fine particulate matter.\u201d\n\nCampaigners urged ministers to include legally binding targets based on WHO standards, with a duty on public bodies to take action to meet the targets, and a right to clean air enshrined in law.\n\nGreg Archer, UK director at the NGO Transport & Environment, said the bill must be strengthened: \u201cThe proposed environment bill will create an undernourished, toothless watchdog. Without ambitious targets and actions to tackle air pollution, people will continue to die unnecessarily.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cMinisters must also scrap their multi-billion pound road-building programme, and invest in cleaner alternatives such as better public transport, cycling and walking facilities. This will not only allow people to breath more easily, it will also help address the climate emergency.\u201d\n\nLevels of ammonia are also on the rise, driven by farming. Ammonia can combine with other pollutants in the air to harm human health, and is also damaging to plants and wildlife. The Guardian revealed earlier this year that 3,000 deaths a year could be avoided in the UK by halving ammonia emissions from farms.", "description": "European Environment Agency found levels of fine particulate matter stalled after decades of reductions", "authors": ["Fiona Harvey", "George Monbiot"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c9ec2c34980c96c8623ed134261c23dfcdd12a6/0_25_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5e6f985ac58c87aea21d9820d49d03b9", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
