Their low liquidity makes them unattractive to many large institutional investors, to whom Nasdaq is seeking to cater.\n\nFor example, when 111 Inc, a Chinese online pharmacy network, raised $100 million in its IPO on Nasdaq last year, shares were mainly sold to connections of the company's executives, 111 CEO Liu Junling told Reuters in an interview.\n\nDigital influencer incubator Ruhnn Holding Ltd, after-school education provider Puxin Ltd, and pet product manufacturer Dogness International Corp are other examples of Chinese companies that listed on Nasdaq in the last two years with more investors from China snapping up their shares than from the United states, according to sources close to the companies. Ruhnn, Puxin, and Dogness did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n\"One critical quality of our capital markets is that we provide non-discriminatory and fair access to all eligible companies. The statutory obligation of all U.S. equity exchanges to do so creates a vibrant market that provides diverse investment opportunities for U.S. investors,\" a Nasdaq spokeswoman said.\n\nThe Nasdaq spokeswoman declined to comment specifically on the impact of the changes in the listing rules on the U.S. IPOs of small Chinese companies.\n\nAt a time of escalating tensions between the United States and China over trade and technology, Nasdaq's curbs on small Chinese IPOs represent the latest flashpoint in the financial relationship between the world's two largest economies.\n\nU.S.-listed shares of Chinese companies fell sharply on Friday following reports that the White House was considering delisting Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges. A U.S. Treasury official said on Saturday that U.S. President Donald Trump's administration was not considering blocking Chinese companies from listing shares on U.S. stock exchanges \"at this time\".\n\nA source close to Nasdaq said the changes to its listing rules were not the result of discussions with the White House. A White House spokesman declined to comment on Nasdaq's listing rule changes.\n\nIn June, U.S. lawmakers introduced a bill, which has yet to be adopted, that would force Chinese companies listed on American stock exchanges to submit to regulatory oversight, including providing access to audits, or face delisting.\n\nNasdaq first proposed changing the listing rules in October 2018, and the changes took effect last month.\n\n\"Nasdaq's concern about low liquidity and high volatility in the marketplace brought about by such Chinese IPOs has become very obvious since mid-2018,\" said Ralph De Martino, chair of U.S. law firm Schiff Hardin LLP's Asia practice, which advises Chinese companies on their IPOs.\n\n\n\n\n\nSTRICTER RULES\n\nNasdaq's new listing rules have raised the average trading volume requirements for a stock, and call for at least 50% of a company's shareholders to invest a minimum of $2,500 each in an IPO.\n\nNasdaq also said in June that it may delay the U.S. listing of a company that does not demonstrate a strong enough nexus to the U.S. capital markets, including having no shareholders, operations, management or board members with links to the United States.\n\nSmall Chinese firms pursue these IPOs because they allow their founders and backers to cash out, rewarding them with U.S. dollars they cannot easily access because of China's capital controls. The companies also use their Nasdaq-listed status to convince lenders in China to fund them and often get subsidies from Chinese local authorities for becoming publicly traded.\n\nUnlike Nasdaq, the Chinese stock market has strict listing criteria that prevent some loss-making companies from going public. The geographically adjacent Hong Kong stock exchange is also viewed by IPO hopefuls as more strict compared to Nasdaq.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Nasdaq's attempt to limit these stock market flotations comes as a growing number of them end up raising most of the capital in their IPO from Chinese sources, rather than from U.S. investors.
