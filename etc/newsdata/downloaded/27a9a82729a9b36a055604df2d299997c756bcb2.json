REUTERS/Regis Duvignau/File Photo\n\nPARIS (Reuters) - French retailer Carrefour (CARR.PA) denied on Wednesday that it was examining a potential bid for debt-laden Casino (CASP.PA), after BFM TV reported the firm was weighing up an all-share offer for its rival.\n\n\u201cThere is no offer, or any draft of an offer, on the table,\u201d a spokeswoman for Carrefour said. Casino declined to comment.\n\nBFM reported that Carrefour had been examining a potential offer for several weeks, citing several unidentified sources.\n\nInitial talk around a bid would value Casino at 4-4.2 billion euros, or a 25% premium to its market value at the end of June, BFM said.\n\nThe two groups were already locked in a dispute amid talk last year of a Carrefour takeover bid for Casino. Casino said in September 2018 that it had rejected a tie-up approach from Carrefour, which Carrefour denied making.\n\nCasino has been struggling in a tough business climate in France, where the impact of a price war among supermarket operators has dented retailers\u2019 profit margins.\n\nCasino CEO and controlling shareholder Jean-Charles Naouri is hunting for ways to ease the company\u2019s debts, and those of parent company Rallye (GENC.PA), in part through asset sales.\n\nIn May, Rallye was placed under protection from creditors. Last week, Czech businessman Daniel Kretinsky and Slovak partner Patrik Tkac bought a 4.63% stake in Casino.", "description": "French retailer Carrefour denied on Wednesday that it was examining a potential bid for debt-laden Casino , after BFM TV reported the firm was weighing up an all-share offer for its rival.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428578236&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A0AM", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
