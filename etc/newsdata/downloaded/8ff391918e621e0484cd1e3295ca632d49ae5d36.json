Still, the result was well below the same period last year when its underlying replacement-cost profit was $3.84 billion.\n\nBP's results exceeded market expectations as a result of better-than-expected downstream and Rosneft contributions, said Bernstein analyst Oswald Clint. BP holds around a 20% stake in Russia's Rosneft.\n\nLooking ahead, the oil giant said it expects fourth-quarter production to be higher following the completion of seasonal maintenance and turnaround activities.\n\nOil companies' earnings have been hit by weaker oil and gas prices. Last week, Norway's Equinor ASA and Italy's Eni SpA announced declines in their third-quarter earnings, citing lower energy prices.\n\nBP shares closed down 3.8% in London on Tuesday.\n\nBP's production was also hobbled by maintenance activities in some of the company's highest-margin regions. Hurricane Barry in the Gulf of Mexico shut down some of its facilities for about 14 days, it said.\n\nThe company had flagged its impairment charge of $2.6 billion related to divestments earlier this month, having sold U.S. assets at lower prices than expected. In the quarter, BP sold its Alaska assets to privately held Hilcorp Energy Co. for $5.6 billion. The sale accounted for about $1 billion of the impairment charge.\n\nThe impairment also increased gearing -- the ratio of BP's market cap to debt -- to 36% including leases. It is above the company's target range of 20-30%, but BP said it should be temporary and gearing should fall to the middle of that range in 2020 as the company reduces debt.\n\nThe company said it expects to complete its $10 billion divestment program ahead of schedule -- by the end of this year instead of 2020. Divestments made this year totaled $7.2 billion by the end of the third quarter.\n\nTotal revenue for the third quarter was $62.29 billion, compared with $80.80 billion the previous year, BP said. The company reported a net loss of $749 million.\n\nUnderlying replacement-cost profit before interest and tax in the upstream business -- which produces oil and gas -- fell to $2.14 billion from $4 billion for the same period a year ago. The contribution from Rosneft Oil Co. was more resilient however, at $802 million, down from $872 million a year ago.\n\nOperating cash flow, excluding payments relating to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, was $6.5 billion, while net debt rose to $46.5 billion, BP said. The company paid roughly $400 million in connection to the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico as part of a $20 billion settlement with the U.S. government in 2015.\n\nBP maintained its quarterly dividend at 10.25 cents a share.\n\nWrite to Sarah McFarlane at sarah.mcfarlane@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 30, 2019 02:47 ET (06:47 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
