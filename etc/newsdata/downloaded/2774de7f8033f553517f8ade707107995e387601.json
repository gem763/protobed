According to the German newspaper Die Welt, some 2,000 tractors descended upon the city of Bonn, and thousands of farmers took the same path in Hanover, Munich, Berlin, and Hamburg.\n\nOrganised by a group called \u2018Land Creates Connection\u2019, the farmers demanded not only a say in the formation of agricultural and environmental policies but also respect from the public who rely on the fruits of their labour.\n\nProtestors bore signs that read: \u201cDear consumer, I am still here. Please talk to me, not about me.\u201d\n\nAnother sign read: \u201dWithout farmers, no fries.\u201d\n\nFamers of Germany feel as though they are regularly scapegoated for environmental problems, and vilified by environmentalist groups as polluters and being guilty of animal cruelty.\n\nOn the group\u2019s website, they said: \u201cThe permanent negative sentiment, the farmer bashing, leads to anger and frustration in the profession\u2026 Under such social circumstances and constantly being pilloried, often neither professionally nor proper, the farmer\u2019s profession loses its attractiveness.\u201d\n\nAnother central concern for the farmers is the burdensome regulations that have been imposed upon them without consultation. Currently at issue are regulations concerning limits on the use of insect repellent and fertilisers.\n\nIncredible Pictures: Thousands of Tractors Shut Down Highways in Farmer\u2019s Anti-Green Madness Protest https://t.co/87bv9vs5Yc \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 16, 2019\n\nMany of the farmers believe that the new regulations will benefit large farming corporations which can afford to comply with the new rules, while smaller family-run farms will collapse under the regulatory pressure.\n\nOne farmer told the Dutch broadcasting company NOS that: \u201cWe can\u2019t even implement one rule and then another measure comes.\u201d\n\nThe protests across Germany comes after thousands of farmers took to their tractors to decry the environmentalist agenda in the Netherlands earlier this month. The protests were repeated weeks later when thousands of tractors descended upon the Dutch capital city, again protesting harsh European Union laws and to challenge anti-rural sentiment among urbanites.", "description": "Thousands of farmers in their tractors took to the streets of Germany, protesting the environmentalist agenda and the hostility farmers face.", "authors": ["Kurt Zindulka"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Germany-farming-protests-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
