REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay/File Photo\n\nBONN, Germany (Reuters) - Deutsche Telekom is taking back responsibility for corporate telecoms clients from its restructured T-Systems unit, which will emerge as a slimmed-down operation focused on IT and digital services.\n\nAdel Al-Saleh, hired at the start of 2018 to turn around loss-making T-Systems, told staff on Wednesday that the business would in future be \u201can integrated end-to-end IT player and reliable enabler for our clients\u2019 digitization\u201d.\n\nAmerican Al-Saleh, who gave himself two years here to get the job done, has already acted to reduce T-Systems' German headcount by 6,000, close most local offices and hire 3,000 offshore staff to round out its software skills.\n\nThe reshuffle at Europe\u2019s largest telecoms group will leave T-Systems with top-line revenues of 4 billion euros ($4.4 billion), Al-Saleh told staff at a town hall meeting. That\u2019s down from nearly 7 billion euros last year.\n\nAround 30,000 employees will serve 1,000 clients.\n\nSeveral European telecoms have found themselves saddled with IT operations poorly placed to compete against more dynamic pure-play rivals. T-Systems has also struggled with loss-making IT outsourcing contracts struck by past management.\n\nAl-Saleh, according to notes of his remarks, said he would now negotiate with social partners on the changes, whose implementation is planned for the second quarter of 2020.\n\nNo impact on Deutsche Telekom\u2019s group financial guidance is expected. Al-Saleh has said he expects T-Systems to boost core profits this year, but only to generate a cash contribution from late 2021 or early 2022.\n\n($1 = 0.9052 euros)", "description": "Deutsche Telekom is taking back responsibility for corporate telecoms clients from its restructured T-Systems unit, which will emerge as a slimmed-down operation focused on IT and digital services.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431216315&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H0V5-OCATC", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
