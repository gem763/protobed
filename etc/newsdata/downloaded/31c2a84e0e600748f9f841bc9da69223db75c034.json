Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nJohn Sullivan, a senior State Department official and President Trump's nominee to be the next ambassador to Russia, faced questions from lawmakers Wednesday about his connection to events at the center of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nSullivan, currently the deputy secretary of state, has bipartisan support for his appointment. But the open confirmation hearing provided a window into the discussions at the State Department over dealings with Ukraine \u2014 at a time when the impeachment testimony hearings are happening behind closed doors.\n\nSullivan was the official who told then-Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch that she was being recalled from her post. The circumstances behind the recall of that long-serving diplomat are being scrutinized in the impeachment probe.\n\n\"In your view, was there any basis to recall Ambassador Yovanovitch?\" Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., asked Sullivan at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing.\n\n\"Yes, there was. The president lost confidence in her,\" Sullivan replied. He said he asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for more information on why the ambassador was being recalled, and he was again told, \"the president has lost confidence in her. Period.\"\n\nWhen Sullivan was asked if he thought she had served the State Department capably and admirably, he replied that he \"told her so\" when they met in Kyiv last year. Menendez admonished Sullivan for not pushing back harder on the decision to recall her.\n\nSullivan stated that discussions about Yovanovitch had taken place over several months. \"The secretary finally told me that there had come a point when the president lost confidence in the ambassador, and that we needed to make a change in our mission to Ukraine.\"\n\nWhen asked by Menendez if he was aware of \"individuals and forces outside the State Department, seeking to smear Ambassador Yovanovitch ... and seeking to remove her,\" he said he was, and he believed that included Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani.\n\nSullivan also added that after Pompeo asked for information on what Yovanovitch had done, a packet of information was sent from \"someone at the White House.\" Sullivan says he didn't know who created the package and that it \"didn't provide, to me, a basis for taking action against our ambassador.\"\n\nSullivan served as a lawyer prior to his appointment at the State Department. And as NPR's Michele Kelemen reported, Sullivan is \"well-respected in the building and has a personal connection to the State Department.\" His uncle was the last U.S. ambassador to Iran and was recalled by the Carter administration.\n\n\"He was undermined by the White House,\" Sullivan said. \"There were leaks about his character, his loyalty to the United States and to the administration, and as a result after 32 years of service in the Foreign Service, three-time ambassador, he resigned from the Foreign Service.\"\n\nIt's a story that appears to have some common elements with the Yovanovitch situation \u2014 and this is how Sullivan summed up the story about his uncle: \"When the president loses confidence in the ambassador, right or wrong, the ambassador needs to come home.\"\n\nSullivan vowed that he would be \"relentless\" in combating Russian interference in U.S. elections. In reference to the impeachment probe, Menendez asked him whether it was appropriate for the president to use his office to solicit investigations into a domestic political opponent.\n\n\"I don't think that would be in accord with our values,\" Sullivan responded.", "description": "John Sullivan's confirmation hearing was a window into discussions at the State Department over Ukraine relations \u2014 as impeachment testimony hearings are happening behind closed doors.", "authors": ["Merrit Kennedy"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/10/30/ap_19303579053923_wide-ec238a6e0673d614c9c4bcba21bc6e8319897d34.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
