Federal prosecutors allege that Ellison kidnapped and robbed Hernandez in July 2018; they also say Mack pushed drugs such as heroin and fentanyl.\n\nHernandez was asked whether there were beefs with other artists.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot,\u201d Hernandez said, explaining his main rivals as Trippie Redd, Cassanova, Chief Keef, and some Rap-a-Lot Records associates.\n\nHe identified Trippie Redd as a member of \u201canother set of Bloods\u201d \u2014 echoing his testimony Tuesday that he was in Five Nine Brims. Casanova was also in \u201canother\u201d Blood group, whereas Chief Keef was part of the Black Disciples.\n\nHe quipped that Rap-a-Lot is \u201cnot a f*cking gang. They\u2019re like, a wannabe mafia kinda thing.\u201d\n\nHe then described how his dispute with Trippie Redd spiraled into violence.\n\nWhile he and Trippie had been on the same label \u2014 even recording a song together that \u201cdid really well\u201d \u2014 jealousy spurred an online dispute.\n\n\u201cWas there violence?\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Longyear asked.\n\n\u201cWe attacked him at his hotel,\u201d Hernandez replied matter-of-factly of the November 2017 incident.\n\nHernandez said he was in a restaurant with former manager Kifano \u201cShotti\u201d Jordan when Trippie Redd\u2019s manager called.\n\n\u201cTrippie Redd\u2019s manager said that he wanted to squash the beef \u2026 the online verbal attacks,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cAt the time I was upset with him, I was like, \u2018Naw, I don\u2019t want to squash the beef.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018If you change your mind, here is the address of the video shoot. If you have time, stop by, we\u2019ll take a picture and let the world know you\u2019re friends again.\u2019\u201d\n\nHernandez and Jordan did go to the shoot location in Red Hook.\n\nThey spotted Trippie Redd\u2019s \u201csprinter van\u201d \u2014 a large vehicle that can hold over 12 people \u2014 and waited.\n\n\u201cWe camped out,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cWe surveillanced it.\u201d\n\nTrippie Redd eventually left the shoot and got into the van.\n\n\u201cWe followed him for about an hour and a half, two hours, on the highway,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cWe\u2019re, like, cutting between lanes.\u201d\n\nTrippie Redd\u2019s sprinter van eventually rolled up to the Gansevoort Hotel. Ellison also arrived and parked parallel to the hotel.\n\nKifano, Ellison, and others in their group went into the hotel.\n\n\u201cShotti comes out screaming, \u2018It\u2019s f*cking TreyWey. It\u2019s the f*cking mob! We got that n- - - -!\u201d Hernandez recounted. \u201cHe said that Harv punched Trippie Redd in the mouth.\u201d\n\nHernandez said he and Ellison became close after the incident.\n\nIn March 2018, Hernandez said he and other Nine Trey members headed to Radio City Music Hall to confront Trippie Redd at his show \u2014 because he didn\u2019t check in with them after arriving in New York City.\n\nOnce again, they staked out Trippie Redd\u2019s sprinter van.\n\nWhen the sprinter hit the road after a few hours, Shotti drove to the right side of the van.\n\n\u201cShotti sticks his hand out and empties his clip,\u201d Hernandez said.\n\nOne month later, Hernandez and other Nine Trey members headed to Times Square to confront Rap-a-Lot for disrespecting him at South by Southwest.\n\nHernandez\u2019s pals wound up robbing Rap-a-Lot affiliates, stealing a bookbag, a passport, and \u201csome fake jewelry.\u201d\n\nShotti got back in the car.\n\nThey didn\u2019t make it two blocks before they heard sirens.\n\n\u201cShotti starts panicking. \u2018I ain\u2019t going to jail!\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cHe throws the gun on my lap and says \u2018Bix, get the f*ck out the car!\u2019\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Bro, I\u2019m f*cking famous at this point.\u2019\u201d\n\nJordan booted him from the vehicle anyway. Hernandez tucked the gun into his hoodie and went into the subway.\n\n\u201cI saw the turnstile and I was like, Naw,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cIf I get on the train right now, someone is gonna recognize me \u2026 I\u2019ve got a loaded gun.\u201d\n\nHe left the subway station and saw another pal, Crippy, outside.\n\n\u201cWe tried to flag some cabs down, but they weren\u2019t stopping for us,\u201d Hernandez said.\n\nHernandez passed the gun to Crippy chest-to-chest.\n\n\u201cKeep your head down,\u201d Crippy told him before they got on the A train. \u201cPull the strings on your hoodie.\u201d\n\nHernandez, who might need witness protection for cooperating against Nine Trey, started naming names in his first hours of testimony Tuesday.\n\nHe said Jordan showed him the gang handshake, and when he showed jurors the Nine Trey sign he said Mack taught him how to make it. (The sign, unsurprisingly, features a thumb-and-index finger shaped like a nine digit, with the three other fingers sticking out.)\n\nHernandez said he wasn\u2019t initiated in Nine Trey but was nonetheless a member. He was supposed to keep \u201cmaking hits\u201d and bankrolling Nine Trey. In exchange, he got \u201cstreet cred.\u201d\n\nHernandez is testifying under a plea agreement he made with the Manhattan U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office; under the deal, he agreed to nine federal counts and agreed to cooperate with authorities.\n\n\u201cThe defendant\u2019s obligations under this agreement are as follows: That he shall truthfully and completely disclose all information of the activities of himself and others to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office and that he cooperate fully with law-enforcement agencies,\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Longyear explained during the plea proceeding in January 2018. \u201cIt is understood that the defendant\u2019s cooperation is likely to reveal the activities of individuals and that witness protection may be required at a later date.\u201d", "description": "Tekashi 6ix9ine continued dropping dimes against former associates Wednesday in Manhattan Federal Court, outright naming several rappers\u2019 purported gang affiliations and detailing attacks on rivals such as Trippie Redd.", "authors": ["Victoria Bekiempis"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/18/18-tekashi.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
