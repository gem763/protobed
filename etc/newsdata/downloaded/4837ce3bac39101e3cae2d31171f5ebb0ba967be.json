One such way is through the art of rangoli. Apart from being aesthetically pleasing, it is also believed to bring good luck and is a way of welcoming the goddess Laxmi. What we fail to realise is that these bright colours are loaded with chemicals such as mercury, lead and bromides and are really harmful. Doctors even warn that continuous exposure to these colours has hazardous effects. They are also harmful to the environment and should be banned altogether. Instead of buying colours laced with chemicals, opt for eco-friendly colours or simply head straight to your kitchen and make your own rangoli colours with kitchen ingredients. Spices such as turmeric and mild chilli powder both make excellent rangoli colours. Other spices such as star anise or cinnamon sticks can be used to make beautiful patterns. It doesn\u2019t just stop there. You can also design an art form out of coloured sand, shells, leaves and flowers or even rice. There\u2019s really no stopping when it comes to sourcing material for your next art piece.", "description": "Let\u2019s do our bit to ensure that our future remains well lit!
