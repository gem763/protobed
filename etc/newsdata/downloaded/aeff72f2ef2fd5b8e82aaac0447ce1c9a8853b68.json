It is The Independent\u2019s style, but I wonder if it should be. It seems designed to divide readers into those who know that it is the Irish equivalent of prime minister and those who do not (and into those who know how to pronounce it, tea-shock, and those who do not).\n\nWe do not call Simon Coveney the tanaiste, as some media outlets do, because even fewer readers know it means he is in effect deputy prime minister. Nor do we call Angela Merkel the Bundeskanzlerin \u2013 although I noticed Michael Gove did in the House of Commons last week. (Mind you, I suppose you could say it is confusing to call her \u201cchancellor\u201d for people who do not know that this is the equivalent of prime minister in Germany.)\n\nI think taoiseach is misplaced politeness. It is what you would call him if you met him, but in journalism our aim is to communicate clearly. I think we should call him \u201cthe Irish prime minister\u201d. Let me know what you think.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBouncy surprise: When a British heptathlete won a gold medal last week we said: \u201cKatarina Johnson-Thompson sprung a huge upset.\u201d Thanks to Philip Nalpanis for pointing out that should be \u201csprang\u201d. That is the usual past tense of \u201cspring\u201d in British English. \u201cSprung\u201d is the past participle, so you might say KJT \u201chad sprung\u201d a huge upset.\n\nThese declensions can seem arbitrary. Some verbs ending in -ing go -ing, -ang, -ung, such as sing, sang, sung and ring, rang, rung. But others don\u2019t have the -ang form, such as fling and flung, and cling and clung. In American English, spring is moving from the first group to the second, but long may \u201csprang\u201d be preserved over here.\n\nAnother nice mess: Another Americanism that crops up on our pages from time to time is \u201cgotten\u201d, a past participle of \u201cget\u201d. In this case, American English has preserved a word that British English has lost. Thanks to Steven Fogel for drawing attention to our report of the Austrian ski resort murders, which said that the victim and her new boyfriend had bumped into her old boyfriend \u201cand they had gotten into an argument\u201d.\n\nMuch as I like \u201cgotten\u201d and approve of reviving it in British English, it is informal over here and out of place in a straight news report.\n\nKingdom for a horse: We had a \u201creign in\u201d last week, spotted by John Schluter. It has been changed to \u201crein in\u201d, which is the original metaphor of restraining a horse. That is the thing about metaphors: many of them come from activities that were once universal but are now esoteric. Horse-based metaphors are particularly common. Jeremy Corbyn was going to say he was \u201cchamping at the bit\u201d last week. It was in the text of his speech issued to journalists in advance, but when he came to it he left the phrase out, possibly because he wasn\u2019t sure about it.\n\nAnyway, rein in means curb (which itself comes from the curved strap holding a horse\u2019s bit, from Old French courber). You can see how it sounds like a monarch exercising restraint in their reign, but that\u2019s not where it comes from.", "description": "Leo Varadkar is in the news, so we used the word \u201ctaoiseach\u201d a few times last week to describe him.
