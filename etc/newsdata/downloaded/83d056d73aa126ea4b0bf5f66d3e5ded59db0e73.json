It\u2019s not a difficult concept to grasp, be it on a personal level or on the grander stage of geopolitics. For example, in the wake of 9/11, personnel from eleven NATO allies came here and flew air defense missions to help keep America safe.\n\nMore recently, in our fight against the Islamic State (ISIS), our Kurdish allies liberated tens of thousands of square miles and millions of people from the terror group. Retired four-star Army General Joseph Votel who led U.S. Central Command during the campaign against ISIS, notes that the Kurds paid a heavy price to help us: some 11,000 casualties.\n\nThe Kurds \u201chave been exceptional partners,\u201d Votel tells the Military Times \u201cand we would have not been successful against ISIS in Syria without them.\u201d\n\nTheir reward now? President Trump, a transactional man with no concept of the word \u201cloyalty,\u201d has tossed the Kurds\u2014who have helped America for decades, including during both Persian Gulf wars\u2014under the bus. In yet another controversial call with a foreign leader, Trump told Turkey\u2019s dictatorial President Recep Erdo\u011fan that he will pull U.S. troops out of northeastern Syria, clearing the way for a Turkish invasion that threatens to slaughter the Kurds.\n\nTurkish ground forces pressed their advance against Kurdish fighters in northern Syria on Thursday, Turkey\u2019s Defense Ministry said, according to the Associated Press. The Kurds warn of a \u201chumanitarian catastrophe.\u201d God look over the innocent men, women and children who are at risk.\n\nAgain: Friends don\u2019t do this to friends. Just ask the president\u2019s best friend in the Senate, South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham: \u201cPray for our Kurdish allies who have been shamelessly abandoned by the Trump Administration. This move ensures the reemergence of ISIS.\u201d\n\nPray for our Kurdish allies who have been shamelessly abandoned by the Trump Administration. This move ensures the reemergence of ISIS. \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 9, 2019\n\nEven the bootlickers of Fox & Friends, who once thought Trump could do no wrong, have ripped him for selling out the Kurds\u2014a move which has also helped, incidentally, Iran.\n\nThis knife-in-the-back betrayal of a loyal American friend should be examined in a broader context. The primary job of any president of the United States is to keep Americans safe. But by failing to stand shoulder to shoulder with a longtime ally, Trump is telling the world that America\u2019s word is no good, and we can\u2019t be trusted. Who wants to deal with someone whose word is no good and can\u2019t be trusted? This makes the world\u2014and us\u2014less safe. \u201cThe value of an American handshake is depreciating,\u201d tweeted Brett McGurk, Trump\u2019s former envoy to the Global Coalition to Counter ISIS. \u201cTrump (earlier this week) said we could \u2018crush ISIS again\u2019 if it regenerated,\u201d McGurk wrote. \u201cWith who? What allies would sign up? Who would fight on his assurances?\u201d\n\nBy proving that he doesn\u2019t stand by loyal allies, why should South Korea trust Trump, or believe anything he has to say about fending off North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong-un\u2014who, U.S. intelligence estimates, say, continues to build nuclear weapons and test missiles? If Trump could sell out a loyal ally like the Kurds, why wouldn\u2019t he sell out the South Koreans?\n\nBy proving that he doesn\u2019t stand by loyal allies, why should the former Soviet republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania\u2014now NATO allies\u2014believe America will honor its word to help keep them from the grasping claws of Vladimir Putin? Trump, who has previously suggested pulling out of the alliance\u2014which would effectively kill it\u2014has hinted that helping others might depend on whether he alone thinks they\u2019re spending enough on defense.\n\nSidebar: NATO spending began rising in 2014, long before Trump even became a presidential candidate\u2014not that this has stopped him from doing what he does best: Taking credit for an achievement he had nothing to do with.\n\nAll of this should also be examined through the prism of Trump\u2019s growing problems here at home. The president, who once dared House Democrats to impeach him, now understands that this is likely to happen. Of course, unless twenty Senate Republicans suddenly develop a backbone and realize that country must come before party, he will be acquitted. But like the other two presidents who were impeached\u2014Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton\u2014Trump will forever be stained by this coming humiliation.\n\nHis domestic weakness may make him more desperate to show his base that he can deliver on key goals. Coming back to North Korea, nobody knows what Kim is thinking. But here are two scenarios, neither of which is good: Kim may decide that impeachment will make Trump desperate for a deal. But he could also decide that it\u2019s better to just keep on building up his nuclear program while the president is distracted.\n\nI suspect Iran\u2019s calculations may be similar. One thing is likely: Tehran will take advantage of Trump\u2019s growing weakness by further driving a wedge between the U.S. and our European allies. Again: This threatens our security.\n\nMexico will never pay for the wall of course (Trump is paying for it by siphoning billions from our military instead), and on trade he may be forced to give in to China to get some sort of deal that he can spin with his usual smoke and mirrors bluster. Chinese President Xi Jinping has thus far made a mockery of Trump\u2019s claim that \u201ctrade wars are easy to win.\u201d Just ask American farmers and our manufacturing sector, which just showed its worst reading since the devastating 2007-09 recession.\n\nThe president has shown that he\u2019s capable of selling out anyone. What might he give up, and who might he sell out next?", "description": "Friends help friends.
