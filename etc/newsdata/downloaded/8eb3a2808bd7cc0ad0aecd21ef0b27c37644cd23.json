Labour, as Corbyn wrote in the Guardian Wednesday, will attempt to stay neutral by promising to negotiate a softer Brexit deal with the EU and then putting that deal to a public vote.\n\nThe political space on both sides of the Brexit divide is being staked out by Corbyn's rivals ahead of a possible general election later this year.\n\nCorbyn will use the Labour conference, according to senior aides, to redefine the pre-election debate and get it back onto the party\u2019s preferred playing field: class, society, economics and proposals for a major redistribution of wealth, more public spending and bolder action on climate change \u2014 \u201cthe real stuff,\u201d as one Labour official put it.\n\nIt is a strategy that worked well for the party in 2017, when it defied expectations and robbed the Conservatives of their majority. But will it work again after nearly three more years of intensely divided Brexit debate?\n\n\u201cWe are now Leavers or Remainers \u2014 they are the divisions in British politics,\" Farage told a rally in Labour-voting Doncaster last week. Corbyn's job now is to prove him wrong.\n\nFarage in Blair Land\n\nAdvocating what he calls \u201ca clean break\u201d Brexit \u2014 in other words, no deal \u2014 Farage has eschewed the traditional one-off party conference in favor of a series of rallies held on weekday evenings in parts of the country that don\u2019t often fall under the political spotlight.\n\nAfter Doncaster, the Brexit Party leader headed last week to Sedgefield in northeast England, a former coal-mining area that was once the seat of former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair. There, he struck on the key message with which he thinks he can win in such areas.\n\n\u201cYou know there\u2019s something very important here,\u201d he told the crowd of 500 or so in a marquee at Sedgefield racecourse. \u201cIt\u2019s a word called \u2018trust,\u2019 and when trust breaks down people can migrate to different political parties, to different opinions, very, very quickly.\u201d\n\nA murmur of approval rippled through the marquee.\n\nBrexit Party rallies provoke passion in their attendees, and the boos for Labour are heartfelt. Years of having career politicians parachuted into safe Labour seats in the northeast of England has bred mistrust and a sense of being taken for granted. The decline of the steel industry in nearby Scunthorpe is another live nerve. Farage told the crowd that EU state-aid rules meant the U.K. was \"banned from saving British Steel.\"\n\n\u201cThey've taken you for a ride in the North East by parachuting in people like [former foreign secretary] David Miliband!\u201d he said during his speech, which was one-part political argument, one-part stand-up comedy routine. The crowd booed. \u201cI\u2019ve got worse than that. They sent [former European commissioner Peter] Mandelson to Hartlepool!\u201d\n\nPhil Wilson, the local Labour MP in Sedgefield who succeeded Blair in 2007, said he is not perturbed. In 2017, his seat, because of its pro-Brexit sentiment, was considered a potential target for Theresa May's Conservatives. But the mood is changing as the threat of a no-deal exit from the EU intensifies, he said, speaking on the phone ahead of Farage's rally.\n\nFarage has eschewed the traditional one-off party conference in favor of a series of rallies held on weekday evenings in parts of the country that don\u2019t often fall under the political spotlight.\n\nA no-deal Brexit would, over time, risk the departure of major multinational employers in the region like Nissan and Hitachi, he said, comparing the impact of such an outcome to \"the closure of the pits in the 1980s.\" Tens of thousands of jobs would be lost, he fears.\n\n\u201cThe Brexit debate has moved on now ... People were promised all kinds of things in 2016, and now three and a half years later people can see that what they were promised is not going to come to fruition,\" he said.\n\n\u201cWe have had nine years of austerity ... over \u00a36 billion taken out of the region through cuts to public services in the North East. It\u2019s not Brussels that has done that, it\u2019s governments elected by the British people in Westminster,\u201d said Wilson, in a foretaste of some of Labour\u2019s arguments if and when an election is held.\n\nLib Dem ambush\n\nBut while Farage and his targeting of Labour heartlands is eye-catching, it is far from the greatest threat facing Labour.\n\nFarage wants an electoral pact with the Tories, in which he would be given a clear run at Labour Leave seats in exchange for standing down his candidates in constituencies where Tories hold the better chance of winning.\n\nIf it came to fruition, the pact could be deadly to Labour. But so far Downing Street has shown no appetite for the pact. \u201cIf Farage is talking to anyone, it\u2019s not anyone sanctioned to be suggesting a pact,\u201d said one senior Conservative official.\n\nWhile Farage and his targeting of Labour heartlands is eye-catching, it is far from the greatest threat facing Labour.\n\nIn the absence of an agreement, polling suggests the Brexit Party will drain more Conservative votes than they do Labour ones. As long as the pro-Brexit vote remains split, Labour should be comfortably safe in seats like Sedgefield.\n\nSo for Corbyn, it\u2019s Swinson who represents the greatest danger.\n\nOn Sunday at the Lib Dem conference, the party\u2019s members endorsed her policy of revoking Article 50 and canceling Brexit without a referendum, immediately after an election. It has taken Labour three years to unequivocally pledge to put Brexit to a second referendum \u2014 and already the party has been outflanked.\n\nSwinson has relentlessly highlighted this point, hopeful that her clear- cut position will win over Labour Remainers \u2014 around two-thirds of its voters \u2014 who worry their party might end up delivering Brexit after all.\n\nIn her first conference speech as party leader, Swinson promised Tuesday that a Liberal Democrat government would stop Brexit \u201con day one,\u201d criticizing Johnson and Farage but pulling no punches about Corbyn\u2019s stance.\n\n\u201cEven now, when faced with all the clear and obvious dangers that Brexit brings, Jeremy Corbyn still insists that if Labour win a general election, they will negotiate their own Brexit deal to take us out of the EU,\u201d she told the Lib Dem faithful. \u201cNigel Farage might be Brexit by name, but it is very clear that Jeremy Corbyn is Brexit by nature.\u201d\n\nNo escape from Brexit\n\nPolling suggests Corbyn is taking a huge gamble. A snap poll for POLITICO by Hanbury Strategy earlier this month found just 8 percent of voters said their vote at the next election would be motivated by investment in public services. In contrast, 17 percent said their primary focus will be delivering Brexit on October 31 and 11 percent on revoking Article 50 and remaining in the European Union.\n\nAccording to Chris Curtis, research manager at YouGov, polling suggests Labour could lose three times as many votes to the Lib Dems as to the Brexit Party. In one poll earlier this month (a particularly dire one for Labour which had them at 23 points, behind the Conservatives at 34), 21 percent of those who voted Labour in 2017 now say they will vote Lib Dem, versus just 7 percent who would vote Brexit Party and 5 percent who would vote Conservative. Nine percent of 2017 Labour voters said they would shift to the pro-Remain Green party.\n\n\u201cIt is undeniably true that the biggest threat to the Labour Party at the moment is their Remain flank, not their Leave flank,\u201d Curtis said.\n\nAt the Labour Party conference, the message will be repeatedly made that the Conservatives and the Lib Dems together \u2014 in coalition from 2010 to 2015 \u2014 were responsible for nearly a decade of austerity policies that has led to multiple crises in British public services, from policing, to social care, to schools.\n\nThe party plans to brand its rivals as \u201canti-democratic\u201d for their stances on Brexit; the Lib Dems for wanting to reverse it without a referendum; the Tories and Brexit Party for advocating a policy\u2014no deal\u2014that has no majority support in the country or in parliament.\n\nSenior Labour officials remain confident that, like in the 2017 election, when the country does go to the ballot box, other issues will come to the fore. Then, Corbyn managed to pull off an electoral coup, denying then-Prime Minister Theresa May a majority and taking 40 percent of the vote, despite an equivocal Brexit stance.\n\nElection 2019, if and when it comes, will show whether he\u2019s right to believe that lightning can strike twice.\n\nThis article is part of POLITICO\u2019s premium Brexit service for professionals: Brexit Pro.
