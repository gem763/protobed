And that the coffee cup was a perfect symbol of how the mighty had fallen on premium cable? Kit Harington has zero idea! Because the actor, flanked by his castmates backstage at the Emmys last night, admitted he\u2019s been able to bypass the significant backlash of the show\u2019s final season by flat-out refusing to watch it until he\u2019s ready. Spiritually? Emotionally? Physically? Who knows. He\u2019s just not there yet. \u201cI still haven\u2019t seen the show, so that\u2019s how I dealt with that controversy. I haven\u2019t seen the final season, but I know what it took to shoot it and it was hard and everyone put their love and effort into it,\u201d Harington explained. \u201cControversy for us, we knew what we were doing was right story wise and we knew that it was right for the characters because we lived with them for 10 years. Controversy for us, didn\u2019t really affect us.\u201d GOT wound up winning Best Drama Series at the Emmys for its fourth time, although it fared poorly in the technical categories \u2014 congrats to Jason Bateman!", "description": "At the 2019 Emmys, Kit Harington admitted he hasn\u2019t watched the final season of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d yet because of its controversy with fans.", "authors": ["Devon Ivie"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/23/23-jon-snow-kit-harrington.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
