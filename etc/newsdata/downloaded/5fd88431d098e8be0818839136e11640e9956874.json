Email webnews@mirror.co.uk\n\nA friend claimed Robinson was innocent, telling MailOnline: \"(Mo) wouldn\u2019t have known those people were in the back.\n\n\"Apparently he\u2019d parked up at the industrial estate in Essex and had gone to fetch the paperwork from a pocket on the inside of the lorry door.\n\n\"When he opened the container up and saw all the dead bodies, he was absolutely horrified - as anyone would be - and called the ambulance service who in turn alerted the police.\"\n\nOne witness claimed the Northern Irish driver had passed out after opening the refrigerator unit and discovering the bodies, the Evening Standard reported, although that suggestion remains unverified.\n\nSources told the Telegraph it is \"very unlikely\" Robinson knew about any alleged plans to smuggle migrants into the UK.\n\nPolice were investigating a suspected Irish people-smuggling ring, the report claimed.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nNeighbours told Irish media that Robinson's parents had left their home in Laurelvale, Co Armagh, and had already travelled to England to support their son.\n\nPaul Berry, a local councillor who knows the parents, said Robinson's father found out about his son's arrest through social media.\n\nThe bodies of 31 men and eight women were discovered inside the container at an industrial estate in Grays in the early hours of Wednesday morning.\n\nIt is feared they all froze to death inside the trailer where temperatures are said to get as low as -25C.\n\nOfficers have started the grim job of removing the bodies from the lorry and the painstaking task of trying to identify them.\n\nIt is believed the stowaways had been inside for more than 12 hours by the time they were found dead.\n\nPolice probing one of the UK's biggest murder inquiries continued to question Robinson - whose girlfriend is said to be expecting twins - on Thursday.\n\nOfficers have also raided three properties in Northern Ireland.\n\nIt is believed Robinson - who called his truck the \"Polar Express\" - picked up the trailer two hours before the migrants were found dead.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nThe trailer had entered England via a freight ferry service from Zeebrugge, Belgium, into Purfleet, Essex, on the River Thames.\n\nBelgian authorities said the container arrived at Zeebrugge at 2.49pm local time on Tuesday and left the Belgian port the same afternoon.\n\nThe ferry docked in Essex just after 12.30am on Wednesday and the lorry left the port in Purfleet about 35 minutes later.\n\nThe tractor that hauled it away from the port had come from from Northern Ireland, entering the UK via Holyhead on Sunday on a ferry from Dublin, according to police.\n\nIt had \"Ireland\" emblazoned on the windscreen along with the message \"The Ultimate Dream\".\n\nOn social media, Robinson had dubbed his cab the \"Polar Express\".\n\nThe Bulgarian ministry of foreign affairs said the truck was registered in Varna in Bulgaria \"under the name of a company owned by an Irish citizen\".\n\nParamedics were alerted first after the bodies were discovered at the Waterglade Industrial Park in Grays, and Essex Police were notified just after 1.40am.\n\nPolice moved the lorry to nearby Tilbury Docks so the bodies could be recovered.\n\nBelgium's federal prosecutor's office has launched its own investigation to find out where the trailer originated and how long it had been in the country.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThe office said it is not yet clear when or where the victims entered the container.\n\nBelgian authorities believe the migrants boarded the trailer at a location away from the port in Zeebrugge.\n\nC.RO Ports, which manages the ferry terminals in Zebrugge and Purfleet said it was \"deeply saddened\" and assisting investigators.\n\nThe incident has been compared to Britain's biggest illegal immigrant tragedy in which the bodies of 58 Chinese migrants were found crammed into a tomato truck at the southern port of Dover in 2000.\n\nThe vehicle had begun its journey in Zeebrugge.\n\nWednesday's incident follows warnings from the National Crime Agency and the Border Force of the increased risk of people-smuggling via Belgium.\n\nSecurity checks for people smuggling are believed to be less stringent at both ports than at Calais and Dover.", "description": "The 25-year-old driver, named locally as Mo Robinson, raised the alarm himself after finding 39 bodies in the container in Essex, according to friends", "authors": ["Chris Kitching", "Image", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Getty Images", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20707489.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/3_THP_CHP_231019SLUG_6905JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
