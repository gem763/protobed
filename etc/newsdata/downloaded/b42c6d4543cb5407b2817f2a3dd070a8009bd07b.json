The song, simply titled 'Fendi', also features PnB Rock and Murda Beatz, and is available to stream and download from today.\n\nFor the accompanying collection campaign, Minaj was shot with models in Los Angeles by photographer Steven Klein.\n\nPhoto credit: Courtesy More\n\nMinaj's capsule collection, Fendi Prints On, features statement clothing for men, women and children inspired by her signature bold, extroverted style; think futuristic-inspired pieces, elevated sportswear and oversized outerwear, all featuring that iconic double F logo - plus plenty of pink. The singer worked closely with Silvia Venturini Fendi and the design team to create a collection which was unmistakably her, but also deeply rooted in Fendi's playful and distinctive DNA.\n\nFendi showed their latest spring/summer 2020 collection at Milan Fashion Week earlier this month. It was the first without the 54-year creative directorship of Karl Lagerfeld, who died earlier this year aged 85.\n\nPhoto credit: Victor VIRGILE - Getty Images More\n\nThe Fendi capsule collection with Minaj will launch online on 14 October and will be sold in 52 Fendi boutiques worldwide from 16 October.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "To celebrate her capsule collection with the Italian fashion house", "authors": ["Jessica Davis"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/TUxgg_gMKed0sK_9zNUlmA--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/harper_s_bazaar_111/75c6f1953a06801e8be6eadb0f2939f4", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
