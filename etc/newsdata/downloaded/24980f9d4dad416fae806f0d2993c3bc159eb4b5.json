Numerous local reporters and TV crews gathered in Sheremetyevo airport to cover her arrival, some with flowers.", "description": "Russian national Maria Butina, who was jailed in the United States in April after admitting to working as a Russian agent, arrived in Moscow on Saturday, greeted by her father and Russian journalists who handed her flowers.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191026&t=2&i=1445140715&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9P069", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
