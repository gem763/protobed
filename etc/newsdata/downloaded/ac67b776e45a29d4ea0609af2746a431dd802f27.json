Lawyers say over 2,000 people have been arrested since then. Egypt's general prosecutor claims his office has questioned no more than 1,000 people over the latest protests.\n\nStreet demonstrations have been almost completely silenced in the past years by measures imposed under President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, a former general.\n\nThe demonstrations erupted over corruption allegations earlier this month against the military and el-Sissi by an Egyptian businessman living in self-imposed exile. El-Sissi warned Friday against \"deceitful\" attempts to discredit his rule.\n\nRiot police barricaded streets and bridges leading into Tahrir Square, where hundreds of thousands gathered in 2011 to demand the ouster of longtime ruler Hosni Mubarak. Several nearby subway stations were closed for alleged maintenance.\n\nThe government effectively banned all public protests in 2013, shortly after el-Sissi led the military's overthrow of an elected but divisive Islamist president.\n\nAlleged misuse of public funds\n\nEgyptian security forces block the road leading to Cairo's Tahrir square on Friday.

Ali has renewed his call for Egyptians to take to the streets Friday.\n\nEl-Sissi arrived Friday morning in Cairo from New York, where he had been attending the UN General Assembly at the time the protests broke out.\n\n\"It is all based on lies, distortion and fabrication. You should be aware of that,\" el-Sissi said upon his arrival at Cairo airport. Hundreds of his supporters rallied to greet him, raising his picture and waving Egyptian flags.\n\nHuman Rights Watch said Friday that Egypt's authorities should respect the right of peaceful assembly by allowing protests, and should release all those arrested.\n\n\"The nationwide crackdown on protests suggests that President Abdel-Fattah El-Sissi is terrified of Egyptians' criticisms,\" said Sarah Leah Whitson, the group's Middle East and North Africa director.", "description": "Egyptian security forces completely sealed off Tahrir Square, the epicentre of the Arab Spring uprising in 2011, to prevent possible protests on Friday against the country's president.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5299510.1569588251!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/1169917979.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
