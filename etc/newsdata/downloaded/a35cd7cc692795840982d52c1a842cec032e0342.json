There wasn't much energy but breadth was good and traders were looking to add some long exposure.\n\nIt didn't last long as the ISM purchasing manager's index fell to 47.8 in September, which is the worst since the summer of 2009, and indicates economic growth of just 1.5% on an annualized basis.\n\nThe report generated an immediate negative response and raises obvious questions about how fast the economy is slowing and how much impact are the various trade wars having. The Fed is already cutting rates but are they behind the curve already? Monetary stimulus has a substantial lag effect and its influence won't hit for many months.\n\nThe market has typically done a good job of shrugging off these sorts of negatives especially when there are positive headlines on trade, but with a week-long China holiday taking place and no negotiations for a while there is unlikely to be any new trade news.\n\nI've been having a hard time finding many technical setups I like so I've been sitting in heavy cash for a while. Most of what I've seen are just oversold bounces in broken stocks that don't offer much in the way of sustained momentum. My view of the market is primarily a function of the number of good setups that I find to buy. I see very little so my view is negative.\n\nWhen I find charts and stocks I want to buy I will be more bullish but there is no choice but to wait. The indices aren't reflecting how poor this market already is but perhaps they are starting to catch up now after the ISM news.", "description": "When I find charts and stocks I want to buy I will be more bullish but there is no choice but to wait.", "authors": ["James", "Rev Shark", "Ism Index Points To Weak Economic Growth", "When I Find Charts", "Stocks I Want To Buy I Will Be More Bullish But There Is No Choice But To Wait.", "Stephen Guilfoyle", "Ed Ponsi", "Paul Price", "Chris Versace", "Doug Kass"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/a103cbf2-ad6a-11e9-bc6a-4dd762835a35.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
