Henderson hugged Davinson S\u00e1nchez and Lucas Moura. He hugged J\u00fcrgen Klopp, folding himself into that nylon\u2011suited embrace while Klopp beamed over his shoulder like a proud father.\n\nFrom there Henderson applauded every stand so enthusiastically he seemed, briefly, to consider moving on to the Tottenham end, or perhaps the TV camera crew paddling in his wake like a pair of faithful R2 units.\n\nIt was that kind of occasion. This was a game Henderson clutched to his chest from the first minute, the time of Tottenham\u2019s opening goal, and didn\u2019t let go until it had been shaped to his will, doused in his scent, and generally arm-wrestled Liverpool\u2019s way.\n\nA 2-1 win means the leaders have now equalled the best 10-game start to a Premier League season. They did so in a way that sprang, in large part, from the captain\u2019s pure, unrelenting will, a way of running, of hurling himself at the day that simply draws the rest of this team in his wake.\n\nIt has been said Alex Ferguson passed on taking Henderson to Manchester United because he believed he \u201cran from his knees\u201d. This may or may not be the case. Nobody really knows for sure. Not least because Henderson \u2013 sorry, Sir Alex \u2013 isn\u2019t actually a horse.\n\nMohamed Salah holds his nerve as Liverpool put Spurs to the sword Read more\n\nEither way Liverpool\u2019s skipper certainly runs a lot. He ran from his knees all the way to Madrid last year. He ran Liverpool back into this wild, one-sided, entirely gripping game that seemed at one stage doomed to become a ghostly Halloween reprise of that buried trauma of five years ago: Chelsea, Jos\u00e9, endless deep defence, Demba Ba and all that.\n\nBrendan Rodgers still thinks Liverpool might have won the Premier League title if they hadn\u2019t lost Henderson for that game. It would have seemed like straw-clutching back then. Not so now. This was in some ways a real-time rerun, a game that carried many of the same rhythms, but with Henderson very much present and centre stage.\n\nThis was a thrillingly heated, dizzyingly one-sided game from the moment Tottenham took that early lead, Harry Kane heading in cutely as the ball rebounded back off the bar. At times it was as though the ghost of Mourinho was out there stalking across the Anfield turf as Spurs lingered over throw-ins and stood around free-kicks breaking the play, and generally drove the Anfield crowd to distraction.\n\nIt took Liverpool 56 frantic minutes to equalise. In that time they had nine shots on target to Tottenham\u2019s one, 351 accurate passes to Spurs\u2019 80, 76% possession, five corners to zero corners. At the end of which the goal came from the player in that front six who is, on the face of it, among the least likely to score; but who seemed, nonetheless, an oddly inevitable presence.\n\nHenderson is some way short of a great footballer, or even at times a very good one. His touch can seem clunky, his passing blunt, his inability to take the ball on the half-turn, legend among long-term England watchers. But he is all the same a great Liverpool footballer, a player who on occasions like these seems to communicate something vital not just to his teammates but to the crowd.\n\nThe goal was made by a lovely looped, faded diagonal pass from Fabinho. And also by some limp defending from Danny Rose, who watched, leapt weakly, then fell over as the ball drifted over his head. Henderson had come sprinting in from the right behind Rose, reading the flight perfectly and clipping the ball without breaking stride back across Paulo Gazzaniga. As the ball hit the net he just kept on running, past the corner flag and back to his teammates.\n\nTottenham had sat deep for so long that from there the pattern of the game seemed set. Even the winning goal was the product of another piece of dreadful full-back play. This time it was from Serge Aurier, given another chance here to continue the hugely gripping, real-time art installation that is Serge Aurier Plays Right Back.\n\nAs Liverpool pressed hard Aurier seemed to have muscled Sadio Man\u00e9 away from the ball inside the area. He switched off. Man\u00e9 nipped in and took the ball. Aurier, not really seeming to look, kicked him in the back of the leg. Penalty. Mo Salah tucked away the kick.\n\nThere was no way back from there. These Liverpool players have a collective presence now, a kind of energy that comes just from seeing them together. They were led on this occasion by Henderson, the man who wasn\u2019t there five years ago, an absence that went largely unremarked in the froth over Mourinho\u2019s play\u2011acting and spoiling tactics; but who offered up his own moment of correction here.", "description": "There were hugs all round from Jordan Henderson after Liverpool midfielder\u2019s display of incessant purpose turned the match against Tottenham", "authors": ["Barney Ronay"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1221d70ec43e55569bbdc279003dbb07a66bd36b/0_13_2436_1461/master/2436.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a9cfb527d2addb14a4462a641270786f", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
