He spoke for 10 minutes without addressing the turmoil nearby and then boarded a helicopter with his running mate, Amrullah Saleh, for the brief flight back to the Afghan capital, the witness said.\n\nAt least 26 people were killed and another 42 were wounded in the suicide bombing. Many Afghans and Western officials here say the latest carnage is part of a surge of violence ahead of elections set for Sept. 28, fueled by the recent demise of yearlong U.S.-Taliban negotiations to help reach a negotiated settlement of the nearly 18-year Afghan war, America\u2019s longest. Women and children, many of them queuing to attend the rally, were among the dead and wounded, Interior Ministry spokesman Nasrat Rahimi said.\n\nLess than 90 minutes after the blast at the rally in Charikar, 40 miles north of Kabul, a blast ripped through a traffic circle in the Afghan capital, less than a half-mile from the U.S. Embassy, killing more than 22 people and wounding another 38, Mr. Rahimi said. The Taliban said it carried out the attack.\n\nTuesday\u2019s campaign-related violence in Charikar marked an inauspicious campaign foray outside the Afghan capital for Mr. Ghani, who so far has done most of his campaigning by videoconferencing. It also comes a day after he stunned potential voters by canceling his participation in a televised debate with his closest rival, Abdullah Abdullah, just minutes before its scheduled start. Mr. Abdullah, his senior partner in the national-unity government, had no governing program to discuss, the president said. Mr. Abdullah carried on alone with a moderator.\n\nMr. Ghani said the two bombings showed again that the militants \u201chave no will or desire for peace and stability in Afghanistan, and all of their actions are nothing but deception.\u201d\n\nElections will be held, the president said in a statement, with the country\u2019s security forces \u201ccommitted to providing security for the people to choose their political fate by casting their votes in a free space.\u201d\n\nThe Taliban, in their statement claiming responsibility for both attacks, said the suicide bomber in Charikar, whom it identified as Nisar Ahmad Balkhi, was targeting Afghan security forces at the campaign rally. The attacks, they said, were a response to the continued killing of civilians by Afghan security forces and their U.S. allies. The Afghan security forces and their U.S. allies have been linked to more civilian deaths this year than the Taliban, the United Nations said in a report issued in late July.\n\nThe Taliban vowed last month to disrupt the elections, calling them worthless and \u201ctheatrical.\u201d That was before President Trump scuttled a U.S.-Taliban deal to withdraw U.S. and other foreign forces from the country and broke off talks with the militants after a Taliban suicide bombing in Kabul on Sept. 5 that killed a U.S. Army sergeant and 11 others.\n\nThe suspension of the talks has fueled worries of even more pre-election violence. \u201cWe anticipate increased violence,\u201d the Associated Press quoted the top U.S. general for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Air Force Gen. Tod Wolters, as saying last week.\n\nThe U.S. has signaled its readiness to strike back. On Sept. 9, the same day last week that he declared the U.S.-Taliban negotiations in the Gulf state of Qatar \u201cdead,\u201d Mr. Trump said the U.S. had already increased its military operations in Afghanistan. \u201cWe\u2019ve hit the Taliban harder in the last four days than they\u2019ve been hit in over 10 years,\u201d he said.\n\nTuesday\u2019s bloodshed comes a day after a U.S. service member was killed in action in Afghanistan, the 17th service member to die in combat operations this year. The 2019 death toll is the highest number of losses in a year since 2014, when the U.S. announced the end of combat operations in the country.\n\nThe U.S. military didn\u2019t release the name of the soldier or the location or the circumstances of the soldier\u2019s death.\n\nWrite to Craig Nelson at craig.nelson@wsj.com", "description": "A Taliban suicide bomber aboard a motorcycle set off a blast at a security gate in Afghanistan near a campaign speech by President Ashraf Ghani, killing dozens of people.", "authors": ["Craig Nelson", "Ehsanullah Amiri", "Craig.Nelson Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107780/social", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
