Photo: Handout/Getty Images\n\nEarlier this month, Donald Trump decided to abruptly withdraw U.S. troops from northeastern Syria \u2014 and give the Turkish government tacit permission to invade the territory and lay waste to the Kurdish forces who had shed blood on America\u2019s behalf in the war against ISIS. Since then, hundreds of Kurds have lost their lives, thousands have been displaced, and more than 1,000 ISIS supporters have broken out of prison camps in the region.\n\nThe worst of the Turkish incursion may now be over. On Thursday, Vice-President Mike Pence announced that Turkey had agreed to a temporary cease-fire. Under the terms of the agreement, Turkish president Recep Erdogan\u2019s government will give the Syrian Kurds five days to flee the territory it has invaded before it will once again seek to secure the area by force. Assuming the withdrawal goes according to plan, Turkey will then make the cease-fire permanent. Erdogan\u2019s government has promised to renew its cooperation in countering ISIS in the region, including by aiding U.S. efforts to secure ISIS detainees.\n\nIn exchange for these mercies, the U.S. has committed to facilitating the Kurdish withdrawal (a.k.a. the ethnic cleansing of northeastern Syria), holding off from imposing any new economic sanctions on Turkey, and removing the sanctions it implemented last week as soon as a permanent cease-fire is established.\n\nThe president was unabashed in his enthusiasm for the settlement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great day for the United States, it\u2019s a great day for Turkey,\u201d Trump said to reporters Thursday afternoon. \u201cIt\u2019s a great day for the Kurds. It\u2019s really a great day for civilization \u2026 I just want to thank and congratulate President Erdogan. He\u2019s a friend of mine, and I\u2019m glad we didn\u2019t have a problem, because frankly he is a hell of a leader and a tough man, a strong man.\u201d\n\nReferring to Kurds living along Turkish border in Syria, Trump says of Turkey, \"they had to have it cleaned out.\" pic.twitter.com/W8J7IFctO3 \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) October 17, 2019\n\nIt is unclear whether the cease-fire will hold, or what future awaits America\u2019s erstwhile Kurdish allies (asked to shed some light on that subject Thursday, Pence replied that the cease-fire agreement \u201cends the violence \u2014 which is what President Trump sent us here to do\u201d). But even if one takes the rosiest possible view, the question remains: Why didn\u2019t the U.S. at least try to negotiate a similar agreement before it allowed Turkey to rain hell on America\u2019s allies and to create the conditions for the escape of ISIS prisoners?", "description": "Vice-President Mike Pence announced Thursday that Turkey has agreed to a temporary cease-fire in northeastern Syria.
