They said any shipment with more than five such items has been blocked.\n\nThe couriers also said they have been forbidden to shop \u201cany items that can be used by mobs,\u201d including masks and bulk orders of umbrellas or sticks.\n\nAccording to Reuters\u2019 follow-up reporting, importers in Hong Kong appeared to be unaware of these restrictions, while retailers reported sales of black clothing remain brisk. Several Chinese courier firms declined to comment when asked about the rules.\n\nThe South China Morning Post on Thursday said it obtained a July 11 notice from a Chinese courier company called PHXBUY, based in Guangdong, that said customs officials had ordered a halt of deliveries that \u201cinclude yellow helmets, yellow umbrellas, flags, flagpoles, poster banners, gloves, masks, black T-shirts, metal rods, fluorescent tubes, and bludgeon clubs.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe cannot take delivery of the above products,\u201d PHXBUY informed its clients.\n\nOn September 26, another Guangdong shipping company called EXPRESS sent its customers an even longer list of items that could not be shipped:\n\nFoodstuffs, liquid, powder, gases, counterfeit brand products, big machines, helmets, umbrellas, wrist bands, towels, safety vests, speakers, amplifiers, trestles, walkie-talkies, drones, black shirts and other clothing, goggles, metal beads, metal balls, horticulture scissors, metal chains, torches, binoculars, and remote-controlled toys.\n\nEXPRESS warned clients that any unauthorized shipment of the banned goods would be subjected to a \u201cthorough investigation,\u201d and said all shipments must include the correct names of those mailing the items plus an accurate list of everything being sent.\n\nThe SCMP contacted another courier and was told shipments of black clothing have been banned, and found at least one online retailer who said orders of black clothes sent to Hong Kong are not getting through.\n\nThe UK Daily Mail on Thursday reported \u201ca batch of black clothing from a U.S. sportswear brand was recently intercepted by Chinese officials when it was being transported from its factory in Shenzhen to Taiwan,\u201d suggesting the ban on black is spreading beyond Hong Kong.\n\nThe U.S. brand in question does not yet appear to have complained in public about the seizure of its goods. The Daily Mail described it as \u201ca famous brand being sold in 45 countries.\u201d", "description": "Communist China\u2019s efforts to weaken the Hong Kong protest movement include blocking the shipment of the black clothing favored by protesters.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1153125189-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
