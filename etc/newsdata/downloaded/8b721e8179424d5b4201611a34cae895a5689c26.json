Celebration of violence and conspiracy theories about the \u2018ethnic replacement\u2019 of whites as the majority ethnicity in various Western countries are prominent in their online circles.\u201d\n\nThe report comes less than two months after a gunman killed 22 people at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas. The suspect later admitted to having targeted Mexicans, and is believed to have acted on a white supremacist manifesto shared on 8chan minutes before his rampage began. The currently de-platformed site \u2015 which was dumped by its host, Cloudflare, following the shooting \u2015 was widely known to be a hotbed of extremism.\n\nGab \u2015 another site where white supremacy runs free \u2015 entered the news in 2018 following the Pittsburgh Tree of Life synagogue shooting. Shortly before the attack, the alleged gunman posted anti-Semitic messages on the site, accusing a Jewish charity helping refugees of bringing \u201cinvaders in that kill our people.\u201d\n\nIn a speech Friday at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C., Acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan identified white supremacist extremism as \u201cone of the most potent ideologies driving acts of targeted violence in this country.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn our modern age, the continued menace of racially-based violent extremism, particularly white supremacist extremism, is an abhorrent affront to our nation, the struggle and unity of its diverse population, and the core values of both our society and our department,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, DHS\u2019 concern over white supremacy appears to be at odds with President Donald Trump\u2019s sometimes racist rhetoric, which has notoriously targeted lawmakers of color, immigrants, a Muslim Gold Star family and President Barack Obama \u2015 to name a few examples.\n\nAccording to a CNN report published in August, DHS officials had to spend over a year convincing the White House that more attention needed to be given to domestic threats.", "description": "The agency says the internet has become a breeding ground for domestic terrorism, following hate-based mass shootings in the U.S.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d86906b2300003100d32547.jpeg?cache=71k3uunzik&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
