That came against Saudi Arabia, which was also the only team against which Italy managed to score more than one goal.\n\nHowever, little by little Mancini has instilled an attacking mentality and youthful energy into the group.\n\nItaly has won all eight of its qualifying matches in Group J, scoring 25 goals and conceding just three in the process. It also beat the United States in a friendly last year.\n\nNearly half those goals have come in the two matches against Liechtenstein and Andrea Belotti scored twice again on Tuesday, just as he did in the 6-0 victory earlier in the campaign.\n\n\u201cThis side is lucky for me,\u201d Belotti said. \u201cTwo goals like last time. I\u2019m very happy, for our performance above all. We did what the coach asked of us.\n\n\u201cYou can see that there\u2019s a more confident Italy side with desire to do what the coach wants, the group is following his ideas. We\u2019re showing some good stuff on the pitch after what happened two years ago.\u201d\n\nBelotti will be competing with Ciro Immobile for a starting spot at Euro 2020 but he claims there is no rivalry with his former Torino teammate.\n\n\u201cCiro is a great friend even off the pitch,\u201d said Belotti, who ran up and hugged Immobile (an unused substitute) after scoring. \u201cWe are also roommates.\u201d\n\nAs well as the five goals and matching the record, there were other positives to take from the game.\n\nThere were debuts for two more players as Napoli defender Giovanni Di Lorenzo and Brescia midfielder Sandro Tonali became the 19th and 20th players to make their international debut under Mancini.\n\nWhile Tonali was given only 16 minutes, Di Lorenzo played the full match and also set up Belotti\u2019s second in an impressive performance from the 26-year-old.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy for the whole team, it was important to keep this run of wins going,\u201d Di Lorenzo said. \u201cWe\u2019re a good group and there\u2019s a good atmosphere and it\u2019s easy for the new guys to fit in.\n\n\u201cI owe a lot to (Napoli coach Carlo) Ancelottti, he\u2019s put faith in me since the first game and I\u2019m also here thanks to him. Now, it\u2019s on me to keep doing well for Napoli and the Azzurri.\u201d\n\nMany young players are competing for places. Mancini made 10 changes to the team that beat Greece on Saturday, keeping only Marco Verratti.\n\nThe Paris Saint-Germain midfielder was handed the captain\u2019s armband as he was the most experienced player in the team - with just 35 caps.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re here, it\u2019s because we believe in these players,\u201d Mancini said. \u201cIn June, however, some good players will have to stay at home.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll get other chances, we\u2019ll look to improve as a team and then we\u2019ll see. It makes me happy that the guys have great relationships with one another.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "From soccer flops to the brink of making history, Italy has come a long way in the two years since its embarrassing failure to qualify for the 2018 World Cup.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Daniella Matar"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/15/liechtenstein_soccer_euro_2020_qualifier_81136_c0-187-4486-2803_s1200x700.jpg?c13ee420b44860f4c9a83c9976ec70f0b50eb9b2", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
