Republicans recently have used their power to change Senate rules, such as ending the filibuster for Supreme Court nominations. The same goes for Democrats, who earlier ended the filibuster for lower-court nominees.\n\nThose who believe that the House may produce strong grounds to impeach the president should also wish to reform the current process. Under the existing rules, individual senators cannot speak. They never question witnesses, never test documentary evidence, and never interpret the law. They never debate the meaning of \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d While silence may treat senators like jurors, it also curbs debate and diminishes political accountability. A trial provides the American people \u2014 through the lens of the Senate \u2014 the opportunity not just to see but to judge the weight of all of the factual evidence and the legal arguments against President Trump. Under current Senate rules, though, a trial amounts only to a trailer of the House impeachment hearings.\n\nThe political effects of changing the current rules are harder to assess. House Democrats are driving impeachment as quickly as possible. They fear that Trump will be reelected if they do not remove him swiftly. Representative Al Green (D., Texas) admitted, \u201cI\u2019m concerned that if we don\u2019t impeach this president, he will get reelected.\u201d But if the House rushes to judgment, Senate Republicans should have the ability to treat a House impeachment with the same seriousness simply by ignoring it. Why must Congress thrust aside measures on gun control or economic growth for a trial if the Republican Senate will acquit Trump anyway?", "description": "", "authors": ["John Yoo", "Nationalreview.Com The-Senate-Should-Change-Its-Rules-On-Impeachment"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
