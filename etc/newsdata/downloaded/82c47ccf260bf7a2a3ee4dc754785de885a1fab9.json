Exciting back Jordan Petaia makes his Wallabies debut on the wing and will provide pace and power out wide, while it is an Australian team with three distributors - Lealiafano, To'omua and Beale will look to shift the ball wide and cause damage in wider confines. A couple of changes to this Australia squad that have been announced this morning - Jack Dempsey and Lukhan Salakia-Loto swap numbers, while James O'Connor drops out of the squad, with Samu Kerevi taking the 22 jersey.
