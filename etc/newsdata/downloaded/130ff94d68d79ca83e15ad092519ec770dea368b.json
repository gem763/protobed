Towering over her on the other end was Nyla Rose, 5-foot-7 and 185 pounds.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like David versus Goliath!\u201d a man shouted from his seat.\n\nIt was a classic wrestling story line, pitting size and strength against a plucky underdog. But a nationally televised professional wrestling championship had never before seen anything quite like this.\n\nAD\n\nNyla Rose is the first openly transgender woman to be signed by a major U.S. wrestling promotion. And here in her hometown of Washington, Rose was competing in the first Women\u2019s World Championship on the debut episode of a new show, \u201cDynamite,\u201d from All Elite Wrestling, an upstart promotion that aims to compete with the WWE with a message of inclusion.\n\nWhen Rose signed with AEW earlier this year, the company and the wrestler played down her gender identity, focusing the story line on her strength in the ring, her imposing size and her Native American heritage.\n\nAs her fandom grew, so did the backlash. Angry messages from wrestling fans emerged in online chat rooms and on Twitter threads, bringing the usual outrage that comes from a transgender woman competing in female sports. Even in a sport that is scripted and performative, some still questioned whether Rose\u2019s placement in women\u2019s matches is fair.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019m actually a little concerned about how she is with the other wrestlers, because for most of her life, she was stronger proportionately by a lot. But now she\u2019s something else,\u201d said Adam Fried, a plumber from Silver Spring, one among the scores of mainly male wrestling fans who had waited in line for Wednesday night\u2019s show.\n\nJoshua Szafran, 28, a real estate agent from Baltimore who was wearing a Bluetooth in his ear and a T-shirt with the words \u201cEat Greg Eat,\u201d said he felt it was a \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d and \u201cpolarizing\u201d choice for AEW to promote Rose so soon.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I\u2019m not sure,\u201d said Szafran. \u201cIt definitely feels more like virtue-signaling than anything else. \u2026 They want to virtue-signal and say they\u2019re checking all the boxes they have to check.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut for Chris Hirsch, a 32-year-old who goes by the name \u201cFuzzy\u201d and drove 2\u00bd hours from Harrisonburg, Va., with his wife and 7-year-old daughter, it really wasn\u2019t \u201cthat big of a deal.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIf it had been a mixed martial arts fight, Hirsch said, \u201cthen I\u2019d have an issue with it. But wrestling is entertainment.\u201d\n\nHirsch said he doesn\u2019t personally know anyone who is transgender. \u201cEveryone has their own opinions on it,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s wrestling. Leave it alone.\u201d\n\nDie-hard wrestling fans like Hirsch didn\u2019t come to make a political statement. They came to see punches thrown and bodies flipped. They came to be entertained.\n\nAnd that was exactly what Rose said she had hoped for.\n\nRose knew there might be fans watching who have never known a trans person. With Rose in the ring, \u201cthey can see another way someone lives their life. Something they\u2019re not normally used to,\u201d she said in an interview Wednesday before the show. \u201cSo it eventually becomes not a big deal.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nFor Rose, fighting in such a major ring, in her hometown, is a big deal. A formally trained actress and martial artist of Oneida heritage, Rose grew up watching wrestling on TV with her grandmother in a lower-middle-class home in the Mount Pleasant neighborhood of Northwest Washington.\n\nAD\n\nShe attended T.C. Williams High School in Alexandria, where she was on the wrestling team for one week and \u201chated it.\u201d \u201cIt was not as theatrical as I hoped it would be,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought they were going to let me get a crazy costume and get some entrance music and be all flashy.\u201d She stuck with the drama club instead and eventually entered the independent wrestling scene to pursue a career that combined her love of both.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always known who I was,\u201d she said about her gender identity. But she didn\u2019t start medically transitioning until she was in her mid-20s, once she had already started wrestling at smaller independent shows.\n\nAD\n\nShe assumed the wrestling world would reject someone like her. But six years ago, she was given a chance to fight with a promotion owned by Cody Covey, Rose recalled to Sports Illustrated. She decided to tell the owner that she was transgender. \u201cHe was like, \u2018That\u2019s cool, I don\u2019t care. Can you wrestle?\u2019 \u201d After the match, Rose broke down in tears. \u201cFor him to have that vote of confidence and just not care, it was in\u00adcred\u00adibly emotionally overwhelming,\u201d she told Sports Illustrated.\n\nIn the years that followed, she continued landing spots in independent promotions on the East Coast and in Japan. In February, she signed with All Elite Wrestling.\n\nOn Wednesday night, she faced a roaring crowd in her hometown.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cNyla! Nyla! Nyla!\u201d fans shouted.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the Native Beast!\u201d a commentator said, using her wrestling moniker, a nod to her Native American heritage.\n\nA commanding figure, with tattoos of the Legend of Zelda and \u201cGeneral Tso\u2019s chicken\u201d \u2014 in Chinese characters \u2014 Rose grabbed Riho like a rag doll, flinging her around. She lifted the tiny wrestler up in the air, Riho\u2019s legs kicking around.\n\nAt one point in the match, Riho kicked Rose out of the ring and tried diving on top of her. But Rose caught her easily in her arms like a baby.\n\nLater, back in the ring, Riho tried picking up Nyla for a \u201cpower bomb\u201d but failed.\n\n\u201cHer body just collapsed,\u201d a commentator on the live broadcast said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cNo shortage of spirit, of pluck, moxy or grit from Riho, but Nyla Rose just with a distinct, overwhelming advantage,\u201d a commentator said.\n\nAD\n\nRiho had been training to be a professional wrestler her entire life. And as she drop-kicked and punched Rose, the fans around the ring got onto their feet. It was clear Riho was the \u201cbaby face\u201d of the match, the crowd favorite.\n\nAnd it was clear that, at least according to the AEW script, that Rose\u2019s size didn\u2019t matter all that much after all.\n\n\u201cThe fans are really into this one. \u2026 No matter who wins this, we have been impressed with both these ladies,\u201d a TV commentator said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a hell of a match,\u201d said another.\n\nAt the match\u2019s climax, Riho sprinted across the ring, kneeing Rose in the face, stunning her and pinning her down.\n\n\u201cOne, two, three!\u201d the crowd chanted.\n\nRiho was crowned the winner, the first AEW Women\u2019s World Champion.\n\n\u201cUn \u2014 be \u2014 lievable!\u201d the commentator on the TV shouted.\n\nAD", "description": "Nyla Rose is the first openly transgender woman to be signed by a major U.S. wrestling promotion.", "authors": ["Samantha Schmidt", "Reporter Covering Gender", "Family Issues"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/JzDvrwAQmLEOvwbeAg9VSV_ZWqA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/C5CSCHXF3YI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg"}
