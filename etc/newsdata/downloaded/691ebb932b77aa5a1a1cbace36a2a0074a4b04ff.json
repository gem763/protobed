Washington.\n\nEarlier, the US president called the protests \u201criots\u201d that were a matter for China to deal with.\n\nSunday\u2019s protest was peaceful, compared with some rallies that have

China for trial.\n\nLast week Hong Kong\u2019s government promised to withdraw the bill, but many protesters said it was too little, too late.\n\nThe demonstrations have broadened into calls for greater democracy and many protesters have pledged to continue the fight.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your
