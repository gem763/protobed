In contrast, the Netherlands, Canada and Japan have the highest proportion in defined-benefit assets, of about 95 per cent.\n\n'Great market for our superannuation expertise'\n\n\u201cThe Australian version of superannuation is one of the best in the world, and we should really be looking at it as an export item,\u201d says Phillip Kingston, founder and chief executive officer of Sargon.\n\n\u201cThe developing economies in Asia and elsewhere, which have a growing middle class where everyone is living longer, could be a great market for our superannuation expertise.\n\n\u201cOur version of superannuation is not beyond criticism or review \u2013 as we\u2019ve seen \u2013 and we can argue about whether the contribution rate be higher, or lower, and what tax settings should be applied, and so on, but at a high level, the quality of the super system is so compelling that we\u2019re starting to have conversations with other countries who don\u2019t have what we have, about how they can rapidly bridge their demographic challenges and adopt systems similar to the Australian superannuation system.\n\n''I think it\u2019s a system that is absolutely ready for export \u2013 it\u2019s an aid and development opportunity, and it\u2019s a trade opportunity.\u201d\n\nThe Australian system has to handle demographic changes, as the population bulge in Australia moves toward a massive wave of pension payment \u2013 of \u201cdecumulation\u201d \u2013 after decades of the system focusing on accumulation. In 2011, the oldest Baby Boomers \u2013 also known as \"the silver tide\" \u2013 turned 65 and reac\u200b\u200b\u200bhed retirement age.\n\nOver the next decade, the number of Australians over 65 is projected to grow from 4 million to 7 million \u2013 who will be drawing-down money from their super.\n\nNick Callil, senior consultant and head of the retirement income practice at Willis Towers Watson, says: \u201cOf the super pool, about 40 per cent of it by assets is held by the age-group 50\u201365, and about 10 per cent is post-65.\n\n''It\u2019s the \u2018wall of money,\u2019 the big tidal wave that over the next 20 years is going to flow into what we think of as retirement phase.\n\nThe big picture\n\n\u201cGenerally, from a big-picture point of view, retirement is still a vacant space, and the super funds are not really ready for the shift to decumulation. If that money leaks away from the system, if members do what they\u2019re entitled to do, which is take their money out at retirement or roll it into a self-managed superannuation fund (SMSF), that represents a huge reduction in scale \u2013 even for the big funds.\n\n''So coming up with solutions that convert assets to cash flows in an orderly way, and in which members have confidence, is not only the right thing for members but it helps the funds address that demographic problem,\u201d Callil says.\n\nThe government has recognised this, he says. \u201cOne of the first things that Treasurer (Josh) Frydenberg said after the government was returned in May was, \u2018We\u2019re doing a review of retirement incomes.\u2019 Of course, people said, \u2018Oh, not another review,\u2019 but he\u2019s actually right \u2013 the retirement phase of super has not been fully addressed yet,\u201d Callil says.\n\nAlex Dunnin, director of research and editorial at financial services research firm Rainmaker Group, says the common perception is the \u201cwave of money\u201d coming out of the system as the nation\u2019s ageing population moves into retirement will mean superannuation shrinks \u2013 but that will not be borne out.\n\n\u201cSuperannuation in Australia is just getting started \u2013 it\u2019s already approaching $3 trillion, but you have to add to that mix more than $160 billion going into it each year, which should increase at least in line with inflation,\" Dunnin says.\n\n''Then you have investment returns of about 6 per cent to 8 per cent a year, albeit offset by benefit payments. Reinforcing this, fees are reducing, so even that leakage is, in proportional terms at least, getting smaller. Sure, more people will retire along the way but when they do, increasingly they take income streams, not lump sums \u2013 meaning that there\u2019s more money staying in the superannuation pool.\u201d\n\nThen there is Australia\u2019s growing population, Dunnin says. \u201cAustralia is one of the fastest-growing populations of the advanced economies. Most of this population growth is, or will be, working-age Australians who will pay tax, have jobs and contribute to super,\" he says.\n\n''So yes, there\u2019s going to be more retirees in Australia \u2013 but while most of the money in super is owned by older people at the moment, most of the members are younger, and they\u2019re going to be in super for longer. There is so much focus on the number of retirees, we sometimes miss the forest for the trees.\u201d", "description": "The Australian system is regarded as one of the best in the world.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3427%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_366%2C$y_93/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/182ff1b7959c32db62d359a2a0f3a0ebe81c52bc", "published_at": "2019-06-26"}
