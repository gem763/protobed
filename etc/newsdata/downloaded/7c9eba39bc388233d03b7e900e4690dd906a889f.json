We could have won it as our performance was good. It would have been the ideal start. But we can build on this.\u201d\n\nFinding space in or around the box was virtually impossible for either side in the first half and the expected fireworks between two sides known for their attacking game never materialised.\n\nDortmund\u2019s Jadon Sancho was subdued while Fati showed none of the scoring form that has turned him into the latest football sensation in Spain.\n\nIt took Dortmund 25 minutes to carve out their first chance with a fine Thorgan Hazard through ball that sent Reus into the area but his Germany team mate Ter Stegen got the better of him.\n\nLuis Suarez wriggled into the box to create a rare chance and tried to surprise Roman Buerki with a clever shot from a tight angle but the Dortmund keeper did well to guard the near post and palm the Uruguayan\u2019s effort wide.\n\nDortmund, who kept a clean sheet at home through the group stage last season, were then awarded a spot kick when Sancho was brought down but Ter Stegen picked the right corner to stop Reus\u2019 penalty. He was on hand again later to block a Reus shot.\n\nMessi\u2019s introduction on the hour in the forward\u2019s first game since his pre-season injury, gave the Spaniards more pace and he made some darting runs but did not create enough for a goal.\n\n\u201cWe suffered a lot,\u201d Barca coach Ernesto Valverde told reporters. \u201cIt was something we already knew would happen. We lacked depth in the last metres and we did not have as many chances as they had. Fortunately Marc was very good.\u201d\n\nIn the group\u2019s earlier game Inter Milan were surprisingly held to a 1-1 home draw by Slavia Prague.", "description": "Borussia Dortmund hit the woodwork and had a penalty saved before drawing 0-0 with Barcelona in their Champions League Group F opener on Tuesday, with Lionel Messi making his first appearance of the season for the Spaniards.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430984361&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G1TQ", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
