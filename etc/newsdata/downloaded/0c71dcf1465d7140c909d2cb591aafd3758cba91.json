There\u2019s been no support from him at all.\u201d\n\nAcross El Paso, O\u2019Rourke is widely considered a beloved celebrity, the hometown rocker-turned-presidential-hopeful who has fought President Donald Trump\u2019s negative portrayal of his border city, heralded immigrants\u2019 rights and stood by residents after last month's deadly mass shooting at an El Paso Walmart.\n\nBeto O'Rourke visits a makeshift memorial site and hugs a family member of Margie Reckard, who was killed in a mass shooting at a Walmart on Aug 3. More\n\nBut to some here, O'Rourke is remembered as someone who sided with developers while on the City Council and was ready to displace dozens of Latino residents in the name of redevelopment \u2013 a far cry from the progressive persona he exudes on the campaign trail. Others say he has simply lost some of the sheen he radiated when he ran against Republican incumbent Sen. Ted Cruz last year.\n\nHis support of a 2006 city plan, which would have revitalized 300 acres of downtown, including the iconic Segundo Barrio area, sparked immediate resistance because of questions about how land and property would be acquired and whether current, mostly Latino residents would be displaced.\n\nO\u2019Rourke also faced criticism because his father-in-law, prominent real estate developer Bill Sanders, was a driving force of the project.\n\n\u201cHow can you go on national TV and claim to be the \u2018people\u2019s candidate\u2019 when you\u2019re trying to do away with those very immigrants you\u2019re talking about?\u201d said Gilbert Guillen, president the of the Union Plaza Property Owner\u2019s Association, which represents some of the buildings slated to be demolished.\n\nO\u2019Rourke declined to be interviewed for this article, and campaign officials did not answer specific questions. At a town hall meeting in 2017, O'Rourke defended his position and said he supported downtown residents.\n\n\"Those are my neighbors, those are my friends, those are the people that I care about,\" he said then, according to the Associated Press.\n\nO\u2019Rourke, an El Paso native, has struggled for months to stay near the top of the crowded field of Democratic presidential candidates. In recent polls, O\u2019Rourke ranks seventh among those candidates at just under 3%.\n\nHe seemed to gain some momentum Thursday during the Democratic presidential debate when he was asked about his proposal to buy back military-style weapons. \u201cHell, yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said in an impassioned response that trended on Twitter.\n\nMany El Pasoans praise the way O'Rourke kept his hometown in the spotlight and brought national attention to issues such as immigration and gun control, said Lyda Ness-Garcia, an El Paso attorney and community activist. Recent trips to a Border Patrol facility in nearby Tornillo, Texas, and to El Paso in the wake of the Walmart shooting, which killed 22 people, further bolstered his likability, she said.\n\nIn El Paso County, which is 83% Latino, O'Rourke beat out Cruz in last year's U.S. Senate race, 74%-25%.\n\n\u201cBeto is extraordinarily popular in our community,\u201d Ness-Garcia said. \u201cAny attention he\u2019s brought onto El Paso has been a positive one. For that, we\u2019re grateful.\u201d\n\nA woman walks past one of many murals in the Segundo Barrio of El Paso Sept., 12, 2019.
