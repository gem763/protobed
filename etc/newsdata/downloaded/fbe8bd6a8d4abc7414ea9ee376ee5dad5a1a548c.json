I\u2019ve spent four years at a traditional, private, Catholic boarding school in Chelmsford, and two years at university in Bristol. When comparing the two cities, Bristol seems a lot more lively and multicultural \u2013 there are museums, theatres, historic sites, shopping arcades, bars and clubs in the densely packed city centre. Chelmsford, other the other hand, had an average-sized town centre with all the necessities \u2013 nothing more, nothing less.\n\nAs a young adult who loves the city life, you might think that I probably didn\u2019t care very much for Chelmsford. In fact, life at the quiet, peaceful boarding school was a unique experience.\n\nThe stillness that I am describing doesn\u2019t just refer to the quietness in the boarding house at bedtime. I also mean the lack of intrusions and disturbances to the development of my mind.\n\nBritish news outlets are overtly sexist and racist\n\nEverything was very predictable: I learned the curriculum, I asked for help if I needed it and the teachers would happily assist, I attended open mornings as a prefect, and introduced parents to the school as an ambassador \u2013 nothing was even slightly shocking or outlandish.\n\nYet, towards the second half of my time there, when I grew to become much more racially aware, things didn\u2019t seem to quite right.\n\nAll the teachers were white, except for my Chinese teacher. There were black members of staff at the school, but they were not teachers. The racial make-up of the teachers did not reflect reality at all. The lack of representation often made me feel that I was not as important (which I know isn\u2019t true) as my white peers.\n\nStudents react as Carrie Lam visits Kowloon Mosque and apologises to Muslim community after police water cannon sprays entrance\n\nThis feeling grew stronger when my article on slavery was rejected by the school magazine because it was \u201ctoo controversial\u201d \u2013 no elaboration on what exactly was too controversial \u2013 and when my white peers would tell me that \u201cracism isn\u2019t real\u201d or \u201cyou should go back to where you\u2019re from if you don\u2019t like this country\u201d. The school even introduced a new rule which did not allow a Chinese student to sit with more than two other Chinese students during lunch \u2013 what?\n\nI wish there had been a teacher who I was comfortable enough to speak to regarding my feelings about race and diversity. Now I\u2019m at university, I realise this discomfort isn\u2019t uncommon among minority groups. Most of my black friends in Bristol feel the same \u2013 under-represented, misunderstood and regularly uncomfortable.\n\nRocking the status quo takes courage, but don\u2019t rock it for the sake of rocking it. Always pinpoint the cause of your discomfort, and if everything lines up to show that you are not at fault, there must be something wrong with the bigger picture \u2013 rock that, and progress.", "description": "It's important to have open conversations about diversity and multiculturalism from an early age.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/shutterstock_1536260435.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
