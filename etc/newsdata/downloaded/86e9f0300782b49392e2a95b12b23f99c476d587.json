There\u2019s such passion that surrounds the sport, you\u2019re not going to deprive your kid of the sport. You\u2019re going to go without a new car,\u201d he added. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen any indication of a slowdown at retail.\u201d\n\nSo the modern incarnation of the company that began life at the turn of the 20th century as Canada Cycle & Motor Co. Ltd. is recession proof. That\u2019s good news for Birch Hill Equity Partners, the Toronto-based investment firm that bought CCM from Adidas AG in 2017 for US$110 million.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund this week cut its outlook for global growth this year to three per cent, the weakest since the financial crisis, mostly because of the trade wars. David Rosenberg, chief economist at Glusken Sheff & Associates Inc., told an audience in New York this week that he put the odds of a recession in export-dependent Canada at 80 per cent.\n\nA certain amount of cushion from weaker growth doesn\u2019t mean Blackshaw is sitting pretty. He\u2019s been tasked with reviving a cherished Canadian brand that was gobbled up by Reebok International in 2004, and then ultimately spit out after Adidas purchased Reebok a year later. He must do so at a time when the rules of international business are in flux, especially when it comes to trade policy and what constitutes shareholder value. A look at CCM is a look at what economists mean when they talk about \u201cuncertainty.\u201d\n\nThe market for hockey equipment is relatively small and essentially static. According to Blackshaw, CCM, which generates revenue of about $350 million, is the fastest growing company in the industry. But you don\u2019t need McDavid\u2019s awesome speed to keep up with the competition; Blackshaw described revenue growth as a little faster than inflation. \u201cAny gain we make is going to be from stealing market share from somebody, since there\u2019s not huge organic growth,\u201d Caroline Losson, the company\u2019s chief marketing officer, said.\n\nBlackshaw and Losson have a plan to more aggressively pursue market share.\n\nTheir research found that hockey players are obsessive about what their favourite gear can do for them on the ice, but attach no greater meaning to the brand away from the rink. Maybe that\u2019s healthy. But the success of companies such as Nike Inc., Lululemon Athletica Inc., and Canada Goose Holdings Inc. suggests there\u2019s more to selling sports gear than making the best stuff. Blackshaw and Losson developed a new marketing campaign called \u201cAll Out\u201d that they hope will inspire rink rats to see CCM as more than the maker of Tacks skates and the sticks that Ovechkin used to lead the National Hockey League in goals last season.\n\nBlackshaw, an American who was hired as chief executive in January 2018, told an audience assembled by the Canadian Club of Montreal earlier this month that one challenge he faces is consolidating a bloated product list, including hundreds of models of sticks. That\u2019s the kind of thing you\u2019d expect a chief executive to confront. Blackshaw also said he worries about climate change, the cost of housing in big cities, and social inclusion. Those are political issues that old-school business theorists think should be left to the politicians. But business isn\u2019t like that anymore.\n\nYounger shoppers want the stuff they buy to stand for something, even their elbow pads. That\u2019s why you see more and more companies choosing a side, albeit tentatively. In August, CCM marked Montreal\u2019s Pride Week with a supportive note on its Facebook page. \u201cWe didn\u2019t remove the post when there were some negative comments,\u201d said Losson. \u201cWe\u2019re proud to be making that statement about the brand.\u201d\n\nMake no mistake, the profit motive exists behind all of these decisions. Climate change matters to CCM because a warmer planet means fewer outdoor rinks. Housing affordability is an existential problem because if parents are forced to settle far from where they work, then hockey isn\u2019t only competing with other sports for time, but also the daily commute. Growth in the hockey business demands moving beyond the sports core of white, straight males.\n\n\u201cIn the end, it can be additive to your brand,\u201d Blackshaw said when I asked him if taking stands on the environment and social and gender issues meant accepting narrower profit margins.\n\nMost modern executives went to school to learn how to adjust to consumer preferences. Nothing prepared them for international commerce under U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nThe United States represents about a third of CCM\u2019s sales and the Trump administration\u2019s trade war with China has cost the company about $10 million, Blackshaw said. The company designs its equipment in Montreal, manufactures the high-performance gear that the professionals use in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Que., and makes most everything else at factories in China.\n\nSo far, CCM and its Asian suppliers have absorbed the cost of the tariffs. If they persist much longer, the company will probably have to raise prices in 2020. \u201cIt\u2019s not a pleasant position to say prices will increase because we have to, but it\u2019s not because we\u2019ve added great features,\u201d Losson said.\n\nFinancial Post\n\n\u2022 Email: kcarmichael@nationalpost.com | Twitter: carmichaelkevin", "description": "Kevin Carmichael: A look at CCM, whose gear is worn by Sidney Crosby and Connor McDavid, is a look at what economists mean when they talk about 'uncertainty'", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/ccm.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
