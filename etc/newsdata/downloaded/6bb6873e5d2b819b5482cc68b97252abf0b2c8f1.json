In summary, our investment appetite is undiminished,\" he said.\n\nSee also: Mobility as a Service could convert car drivers to bus riders (TechRepublic)\n\nThe company also plans to continue to expand its global operations, particularly in the United Kingdom and Singapore.\n\nReports by the BBC indicated the electric car division employed 500 UK workers. The company said it will now find alternative roles for those affected, highlighting there's \"sufficient\" vacancies to absorb them into its Home business.\n\nEarlier this year, Dyson, one of the most prominent Brexit backers, announced the company would move its global headquarters to Singapore to better support its manufacturing operations, which primarily resides in the region.\n\nCEO Jim Rowan told UK media that the move was not motivated by Brexit or tax, but was about future-proofing the company's business. He added that there were significant revenue opportunities in Singapore and the region.\n\nRowan, as quoted in a BBC report, said: \"We have seen an acceleration of opportunities to grow the company from a revenue perspective in Asia. We have always had a revenue stream there and will be putting up our best efforts as well as keeping an eye on investments.\"\n\n\"The tax difference [between being based in Singapore and the UK] is negligible for us,\" he noted, adding that the company would be registered in Singapore.\n\nThe company also operates a Philippine Advanced Manufacturing Centre and R&D activities in China.\n\nAt the end of last year, Dyson had announced plans to build a manufacturing plant in Singapore dedicated to producing electric vehicles. It was slated to be a two-storey facility and would have been the first facility of its kind for the company.\n\nThe company reported profit climbed 33% to \u00a31.1 billion for 2018, breaking the billion dollar mark for the first time.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\nDyson to build electric vehicle plant in Singapore\n\nSlated to complete in 2020, the two-storey manufacturing facility is part of the UK company's \u00a32.5 billion (US$3,25 billion) global investment in new technology and plans to launch electric vehicles.\n\nDyson planning electric car by 2020\n\nThe company responsible for the bagless vacuum cleaner will use its expertise in solid-state battery technology and electric motors for its own electric vehicle.\n\nDyson 2018 profit breaks $1B, to move global HQ to Singapore\n\n\n\nFuelled by \"soaring demand\" across Asia, the UK consumer electronic manufacturer sees its profits climb 33 percent to cross \u00a31.1 billion (US$1.42 billion) for the first time last year and will move its global base to Singapore to better support its manufacturing operations.\n\nShell to roll out electric vehicle charging service at stations across Singapore\n\nCalled Shell Recharge, the electric-vehicle charging service currently is available at a single Shell station in the country at SG$0.55 per kWh with another nine stations to be suited up by October.", "description": "Founder James Dyson said the company will focus on manufacturing solid state batteries instead.", "authors": ["Aimee Chanthadavong"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/09/27/5066291e-974a-4bd8-a076-f064d49462f5/thumbnail/770x578/bdbdda00cad0c733958250ab15b1d4b5/dyson.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
