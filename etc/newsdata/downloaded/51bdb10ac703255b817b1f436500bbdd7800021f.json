But there is a long way to go before we can see what the final decision will be,\u201d Plevneliev, who is also a former Bulgarian President told BNR.\n\n\u201cBulgaria has prepared a wonderful proposal, which offers the utmost possible under European Union laws,\u201d Plevneliev said.\n\nThe cluster, which unites over 54 companies in the automotive sector and car part industry, has been involved in lobbing for the Bulgarian bid.\n\n\u201cWe can expand our cooperation with Volkswagen in different areas. Bulgaria is to build infrastructure for electric cars. We also have ideas how to back up the carmaker with additional infrastructure and educational measures, Plevneliev said.\n\nThe economy ministry declined to comment both on whether Sofia is improving its offer or on an eventual subsidy increase.\n\nA ministry spokesman said that until there is a final decision, Bulgaria and Turkey are both contenders for the new plant.\n\nWith a Volkswagen decision on hold, neighbouring Romania said it has initiated new talks to lobby for the investment.", "description": "Bulgaria is ready to offer more incentives to Volkswagen to build a new plant in the country after the carmaker postponed a decision on building it in Turkey amid criticism of Ankara's offensive in Syria.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441482989&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F14P", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
