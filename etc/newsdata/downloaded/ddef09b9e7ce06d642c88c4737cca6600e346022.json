Here\u2019s how to explore this jewel of West Virginia\u2019s Eastern Panhandle.\n\nA history of wellness\n\nOne of the earliest fans of the region\u2019s waters was George Washington, who took the first of many outdoor soaks in a now landmarked tub in Berkeley Springs State Park in 1748.\n\nTo follow in the first president\u2019s footsteps, visitors can dabble their toes in the shallow pools at Berkeley Springs State Park, then head over to the park\u2019s recently renovated Historic Roman bathhouse, which features nine individual baths in private rooms. At the main bathhouse, one can opt for an underwater \u201cwatsu\u201d (\u201cwater\u201d + \u201cshiatsu\u201d) massage, or a calming 20-minute soak in a private room or family-style tub.\n\nFor more chances to get rest and relaxation, tourists can pay a visit to the Ice House, a 40,000-square-foot art center and community hub. There, expect to find multiple galleries with special exhibits and a local arts co-op, as well as weekly belly dancing and yoga classes.\n\nIn October, bookworms can look forward to Berkeley Springs\u2019s Book Festival, which will feature works from regional authors. And for those seeking out something more mystical, the Festival of Light\u2014the region\u2019s largest psychic fair\u2014is a top option; it will be held on Veterans Day weekend in November and a $5 admission gives access to more than 80 readers, healers and a dozen workshops.\n\nYou can also unwind outside on the self-guided historic walking tour that begins at the Dutch Cemetery, which dates back to 1777, and passes the Wisteria Cottage, Berkeley Castle and The Country Inn (where it\u2019s worth lingering for a detoxifying Thai body wrap at the Renaissance Spa).\n\nFall colors\n\nThere\u2019s something extra magical about Berkeley Springs in autumn, a time when locals come together to celebrate seasonal attractions and activities\u2014such as the Apple Butter Festival, which is celebrating its 46th anniversary this year on October 12 and 13.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of the town\u2019s heritage,\u201d said local Lori Hansroth of the festival. She recounted how the whole community gets involved in the event, peeling, stirring and congregating around copper kettles full of apple butter, all while enjoying festival food, games, music and the popular Craft Beer Garden.\n\nFor fans of a good old autumn Bavarian bonanza, The Country Inn is hosting its annual Oktoberfest on October 5, complete with Spaten beer, games, a polka band and lots of lederhosen. And art lovers should plan a visit with the Berkeley Springs Studio Tour, held throughout Morgan County on October 19 and 20. There, guests are welcomed into the private studios of nationally and regionally known artists; Laura Smith said not to miss Frog Valley Artisans and Hsu Studios. The latter is known for its jewelry and aluminum mobiles, she said.\n\n\u201cYou can scarcely go out in public in town without someone here wearing colorful Hsu jewelry,\u201d said Jeanne Mozier, founding president of Travel Berkeley Springs.\n\nAt Cacapon Resort State Park, a 6000-acre greenspace in Berkeley Springs, there are guided tours of a blooming eight-acre wildflower meadow, weekend campfires near the nature center and Haunted Trail Days on October 19 and 26. Expect tractor rides, pumpkin carving contests, hot dogs and hot apple cider to be on the itinerary this year.\n\nRebirth of Cool\n\nThe mineral springs may be the area\u2019s dominant feature, but the 1960s-era Coolfont Resort has long been regarded as the town\u2019s other pride and joy. Proprietor Larry Omps knows people who have been going there for generations.\n\n\u201cThe idea is that this is their second home, and that\u2019s what we want,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter extensive renovations over the last year, Coolfont reopened in September, making it the perfect place to stay during an autumnal visit. Perched on 250 woodsy acres just 10 minutes from the downtown area, the updated Coolfont features an indoor heated saltwater pool and a 150-seat restaurant specializing in smoked-in-house BBQ.\n\nThe resort also opened its Treetop Lodge, which offers eight suites with balcony views of the 12-acre manmade lake located on its grounds. Across the road, the Berkeley Springs Brewery serves beers that encapsulate the best of fall flavors with the CaCapon K\u00f6lsch, Lover\u2019s Leap IPA or the Coolfont Brew amber ale.\n\nThose who come for a weekend visit at Coolfont\u2014or any of Berkeley Springs\u2019s other hotels, inns and resorts\u2014can make the most of their trip by enjoying the area\u2019s bustling food scene. In the morning, swing by the Southern Belle Truck Stop, a mainstay since 1971 known for its iconically fluffy pancakes. That\u2019s where Jenna Hansroth, owner of the Inspired Chaos gift shop (and daughter of Lori Hansroth), likes to tuck into breakfast with her D.C. friends, who come to Berkeley Springs as a respite from city life.\n\nFor lunch, head to local favorite Tari\u2019s for the creamy, flavor-packed fried green tomatoes mac and cheese, or sample some of the 60 olive oils and small plates at the new tasting gallery The Naked Olive Lounge. And if you\u2019re still hungry for more, end the day at Ravenwood Pub, another new eatery. Their star dish, the Brewers Bowl\u2014a hearty mix of mashed potatoes, ribeye steak, peppers, onions and oatmeal stout gravy\u2014is best enjoyed with a side of live rock and folk music performed by owner Regina Aamacha most days of the week.\n\nInto the woods\n\nCacapon Resort State Park\u2014pronounced Cuh-cay-pun, a Shawnee Indian name meaning \u201cmedicine waters\u201d\u2014is \u201ca little hidden gem of the Eastern Panhandle,\u201d said park superintendent Scott Fortney. \u201cIt\u2019s got something for everybody.\u201d\n\nNewly renovated vacation cabins, a golf course, horseback riding and moss-covered trails offer ample opportunity for autumnal exploring, on top of the guided tours that will be held in October. Fortney points beginner hikers to the gradual two-mile Start Me Up path that starts near the nature center and ends at Batt Shelter, while more advanced hikers will enjoy trekking the hillier five-mile Central Trail loop.\n\nAnd cyclists revel in the park\u2019s recently developed 10 miles of mountain bike trails, with another 15 miles opening within the next two years. Drive to the Cacapon Mountain Overlook for sweeping views across West Virginia and Virginia.\n\nBut no matter how you explore Cacapon and Berkeley Springs\u2019s many other back roads, make sure to be ready to snap photos\u2014the foliage in Berkeley Springs\u2019s wilderness is a sight to be seen in the autumn.\n\n\u201cFall is my favorite season in West Virginia,\u201d said Jenna Hansroth. \u201cWhen the leaves start to change color on the surrounding mountains, they cast a warm amber glow over the whole town.\u201d\n\nPlan your trip to Berkeley Springs, WV.", "description": "The fall getaway that has something for everyone (Partner Content)", "authors": ["Wp Brandstudio"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/brand-studio/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/JMM0143.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
