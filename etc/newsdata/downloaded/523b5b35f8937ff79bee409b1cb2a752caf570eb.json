'\n\nHe said the reason the lorry had been registered in Varna in Maher's wife's name was because the taxes and associated costs were cheaper than in the UK.\n\nHe said: 'Thomas has been unwell for a few years with a heart illness and he had to put his company into his wife's name and that is how her name is on the register.'\n\nHe said he had handed the registration certificate to local police and could not remember the number plate details.\n\nMr Jeliazkov said he had been asked by Bulgarian police if he knew anything about the organisation behind the trafficking and the lorry's fateful trip and declared he had no knowledge.\n\nPham Thi Tra My (left) had texted her mother whilst taking the journey to the UK.

I have known them for several years and know they have three children who they love very much. They are good people.'\n\nHe said the business was registered on the ground floor of a at a 10-storey residential block in Varna.\n\nHe added: 'My company is registered there so the fact I'm not present at the address does not mean the address is a shell company or fake address.\n\n'I knew the couple well they are my friends. Everything is legitimate. There is nothing illegal about registering a company in Bulgaria.\n\n'I am an official representative of their company and the taxes are lower here to register a truck but that's no crime and there is nothing wrong in having foreign investment in Bulgaria.\n\n'This is a smear campaign against them. The authorities abroad are investigating a serious crime.\n\n'When I spoke with them they were surprised that the media were showing an interest in them as they have had nothing to do with this lorry since they sold it.\n\n'I am going to help them by talking to the police here. I have given the registration certificate to the Ministry of Transport in Bulgaria.'\n\nThe Mahers told MailOnline they sold the lorry cab a year ago to a company in Ireland.\n\nThe refrigerated trailer in which the 39 trafficking victims died is believed to be owned by a rental firm in Dublin.\n\nMr Jelyazkov added: 'It is true that the Bulgarian lead ends with the registration plates of the truck.\n\n'After that we don't have anything to do with it and the truck has not been back to Bulgaria.\n\n'It was not loaded with those people in Bulgaria. It is a massive tragedy. Human trafficking is a very serious topic in society.\n\n'When I saw the picture of the Vietnamese girl who died, I was very upset.'\n\nHe said he did not believe Bulgarian police would be interested in him.\n\n'I have not been arrested. There is no reason for me to be arrested or charged with anything.\n\n'There has been no crime committed on the territory of Bulgaria. There are no Bulgarian citizens harmed.'\n\nThe night before his arrest, father-of-three Mr Maher, 38, said: 'We've just flown back from abroad. I have told the police we are back. I'm just about to take the kids out for a meal.'\n\nHours later they were arrested. One neighbour said: 'I looked out and saw Tom in the door way watch as a police van left.

I went to the British police as we were registered owners in Bulgaria.\n\n'I phoned them myself. They were happy we had come forward. They are well aware of who they are dealing with in southern Ireland.\n\n'It's not nice to be associated with this. We're shocked.'\n\nHe added: The police said thanks for ringing and I told them I was at home. I told the police who the previous owner was.\n\n'The police took my phone number and email address. Seeing all this wasn't nice.\n\n'I would just like the police to get on with their investigation.'\n\nHairdresser Mrs Maher said: 'My name was down as owning the lorry cab. But we sold it a year ago.
