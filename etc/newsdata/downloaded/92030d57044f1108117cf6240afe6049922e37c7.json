He could not be reached for comment.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s not clear when Mr. Bronstein acquired the property, but he reportedly spent several years and upward of \u00a330 million building the two-acre compound.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe new owner has a great opportunity to put their own personality into the property, with scope to reconfigure the house to suit their lifestyle,\u201d Mr. Draper said.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Liz Lucking"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-120445?width=1280", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
