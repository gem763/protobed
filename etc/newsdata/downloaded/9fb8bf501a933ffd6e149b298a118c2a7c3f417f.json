These worries eventually faded as the Federal Reserve soon jumped on the rat-cut bandwagon and Trump quickly reversed the tariff threat against Mexico.\n\nA trader works on the trading floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., September 3, 2019. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly More\n\nLingering stock market worries\n\nStill, some of the negatives that the market has faced since the end of May, per Stolzfus\u2019 earlier point, are quite lengthy. He points to continued tweets about trade by Trump; China\u2019s retaliation; the yield curve inversion, which started in August; recession fears and the roughly $17 trillion worth of negative-yielding government bonds across the globe.\n\n\u201cNow with the Northern Hemisphere\u2019s summer behind us, professional investors will return from the Labor Day holiday weekend to parse the details of the latest ramp up in hostilities in the trade war after the U.S. added to its tariff regime and China quickly moved to retaliate with tariffs against U.S. good,\u201d Stolzfus wrote.\n\nThe S&P 500 is up roughly 15.8% so far this year.\n\nAll Markets Summit 2019 More\n\nScott Gamm is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
