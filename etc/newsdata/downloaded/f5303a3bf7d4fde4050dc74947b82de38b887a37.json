A small group of players including captain Kieran Read will be competing at their third World Cups and a larger group will be taking part in the tournament for the second time, adding to the experience base on which their challenge is founded.\n\nWhile that gives New Zealand a sense of continuity, they will defend the Webb Ellis Trophy in changing times. Unlike in 2011 and 2015, the All Blacks will not begin this World Cup as the top-ranked team in world rugby: that distinction belongs now to Ireland who in recent weeks superseded Wales as world No.1.\n\nThe New Zealanders may remain nominal favorites but their lost ranking indicates they will face a much broader challenge for the world title this time than they did in the two preceding tournaments.\n\nIreland, Wales, England, South Africa and Australia share a sense of confidence in the strength of their claims to the World title. Hansen recognizes that but believes the All Blacks\u2019 experience in playing under pressure - often pressure generated by the expectation of their own fans - will give them a \u201csmall advantage.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis World Cup looks like it\u2019s going to be the most fiercely contested tournament yet with a number of teams turning up in Japan thinking they\u2019re going to win it,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to create some expectations on them too and, with that expectation, pressure.\n\n\u201cIt will be interesting to see who can cope with it and who can\u2019t, because the tournament will demand that they do. That\u2019s where we\u2019re going to have a small advantage. We live (under pressure) all the time. Some of these teams are going to turn up and feel that pressure. It can be overwhelming if you haven\u2019t had it before.\u201d\n\nHansen said pressure \u201conly crushes you if you allow it to.\u201d The pressure comes on most heavily after pool play when every match is played under the \u201cwin or go home\u201d intensity of knockout rugby, something most teams don\u2019t regularly experience.\n\n\u201cWe know it\u2019s going to be tough and we know we\u2019re going to have to earn the right to (win) it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, having said that, anything that\u2019s worth doing has to have those components in it.\n\n\u201cThere will be a massive amount of scrutiny, expectation and - because of that - pressure. The one thing we\u2019re looking forward to is taking that pressure head-on and enjoying everything that it brings with it.\u201d\n\nScrutiny of the All Blacks\u2019 form will be greater at this World Cup because they are not going into the tournament in as dominant a position in world rugby as in 2011 and, to a greater extent, in 2015 when they owned a deserved No. 1 ranking.\n\nThere is an impression their form has declined over the last four years and more speedily in the last two, highlighted by their tied series against the British and Irish Lions in 2017, two losses to Ireland and a recent record loss to Australia in Perth.\n\nThere has been evidence in those performances that the All Blacks are not as confident under pressure as in 2015 when they had flyhalf Dan Carter and captain Richie McCaw in command. Read is a less charismatic captain than McCaw, and Richie Mo\u2019unga and Beauden Barrett have not risen to Carter\u2019s level at flyhalf.\n\nMost teams, but most notably South Africa which beat New Zealand in 2018 and drew with them this year, have figured out how to nullify the All Blacks\u2019 attack with smothering defense. The yardstick of the All Blacks\u2019 form may come in their first match of the tournament against the Springboks on Sept. 21.\n\nThat match will likely decide the winner of a pool which also includes Italy, Canada and Namibia.\n\nOn departure for his last world tournament before he steps down as coach, Hansen offered no guarantees he will return with the trophy but promised his team will do its best.\n\n\u201cObviously there are no guarantees in sport,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when you\u2019ve got talent, a work ethic and mental fortitude you give yourself a chance.\u201d\n\n____\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "As New Zealand attempts the unprecedented feat of winning the Rugby World Cup for the third time in a row, many of the factors that underpinned its winning campaigns in 2011 and 2015 remain in place but much else has changed.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Steve Mcmorran"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/07/aptopix_new_zealand_tonga_rugby_79043_c0-120-3600-2218_s1770x1032.jpg?3d4418892aeca941ac90b2a0a958981728f26c1d", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
