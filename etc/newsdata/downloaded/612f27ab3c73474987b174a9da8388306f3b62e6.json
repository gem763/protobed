While the European Union, which Trump (and Zelenskiy) derided in the memo of their chat, provides ample support to Ukraine\u2014more than 3 billion euros since 2014\u2014the common feeling in Ukraine is that the EU is willing to bend too far to the Kremlin\u2019s terms to stop the war in Donbas, whereas the United States is willing to more aggressively back Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI think the Ukrainians are very concerned that Europe is not willing to up the pressure on Russia the way the United States has been, at least rhetorically,\u201d Olya Oliker, Europe & Central Asia Director for Crisis Group, told me. The U.S., she added, has been willing to pressure if not \u201cscare\u201d Russia in a way the EU has not. \u201cFor all of the \u2018let\u2019s be friends with Russia\u2019 talk from the White House, the U.S. has been really consistent on this,\u201d Oliker said.\n\nBut it\u2019s not necessarily easy for a foreign country to understand what exactly the United States stands for these days, or who\u2019s speaking for it. After all, it was Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, who helped install corrupt pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych, deposed in 2014 in a revolution which led directly to Russian annexation of Crimea and the conflict that roils Ukraine to this day. Jankowicz, for one, worries about the \u201cmixed signals\u201d that the U.S. is sending its allies by having official, diplomatic channels and foreign policy from the State Department along with unofficial and considerably less diplomatic channels, like using Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani as a conduit. \u201cIt impacts our credibility abroad,\u201d said Jankowicz.\n\nThe recent call memo, not to mention the entire Biden affair instigated by a commander-in-chief looking ahead to 2020, is an unintentional testament to the Trump era. A country that regards itself as the foremost exporter of liberal democracy around the world is also now a country whose leader goes around making illiberal, undemocratic requests of its apparent allies\u2014and has a pliant crew of partisans back home to defend every move.\n\n\u201cWe are friends,\u201d Zelenskiy reportedly told Trump in their July 25 phone calls. \u201cWe are great friends and you Mr. President have friends in our country.\u201d\n\nBut does Trump feel the same? Even aside from his associations with Manafort and persistent cozying up to Russia, there would be reasons to doubt that friendship. After all, it\u2019s Ukraine\u2014the only country in Europe with an active conflict on its soil and one that\u2019s seldom in western news for any positive reasons\u2014that has to have discussion right now about how to best avoid America\u2019s anger. And it\u2019s something that may not bode well for other countries around the world who, like Ukraine, feel they need the unflinching support of the United States just to survive. There\u2019s a lot at stake in Ukraine, a country that Jankowicz describes as the \u201clynchpin to the region,\u201d key to the security of eastern Europe. It\u2019s in no one\u2019s interest\u2014save perhaps the Kremlin\u2014to have the country fall further into war or chaos. And actions like Trump\u2019s, if they become a precedent or a pattern, are hardly the recipe for greater governmental legitimacy or stability in Ukraine.\n\nTrump, sitting beside Zelenskiy on Wednesday, didn\u2019t sound too interested in providing his counterpart with much support. \u201cI really hope that you and President Putin can get together and solve your problem,\u201d he told Zelenskiy. From the Ukrainian perspective, to hear the president of the United States describe your almost six-year-long war that\u2019s taken an estimated 13,000 lives as merely a \u201cproblem\u201d probably isn\u2019t something that fills you with confidence.", "description": "The United States has an interest in keeping the Eastern European state stable and its government looking legitimate. The president's phone call worked against that.", "authors": ["Michael Colborne"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/000b4afb29bac5f9043484ede39afdb022bdeebc.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
