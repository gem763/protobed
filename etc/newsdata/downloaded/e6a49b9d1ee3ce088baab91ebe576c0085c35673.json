Nationals manager Dave Martinez told reporters that Hudson\u2019s wife gave birth to a girl Friday morning.\n\nThe joyous news was met with disapproval from former Marlins president David Samson, who was fired after the new team ownership took control.\n\nUnreal that Daniel Hudson is on paternity list and missing game 1 of #NLCS . Only excuse would be a problem with the birth or health of baby or mother. If all is well, he needs to get to St. Louis. Inexcusable. Will it matter? #waittosee \u2014 David P. Samson (@DavidPSamson) October 11, 2019\n\nYou heard it here first, folks. The only way Daniel Hudson is allowed to spend the first day of his daughter\u2019s life with her is if something is medically wrong with her or his wife. Those are apparently the rules in Samson\u2019s head. Good thing the Marlins never made the playoffs after the paternity list\u2019s creation in 2011, otherwise there might have been some problems.\n\nStory continues\n\nOf course, Samson should be quite familiar about the importance of family. He became a top executive for the Montreal Expos, then the Marlins after marrying the daughter of former owner Jeff Loria.\n\nSamson would later go on to fight off a RICO lawsuit over his mismanagement of the Expos, fleece Miami taxpayers in a $1.2 billion stadium deal that later triggered an SEC investigation then taunt them over it, threaten to fire employees for letting an octopus win a mascot race and become the first person voted out on a season of \u201cSurvivor.\u201d Clearly, a man who knows what it takes to win.\n\nNats manager seems cool with Hudson meeting his daughter\n\nLess irate over Hudson missing Game 1 was Martinez, who said that Hudson should not be putting a baseball game over his family.\n\n\u201cI told him, \u2018Hey, family's always first,\u2019 \u201d Martinez said. \u201cI understand. The timing didn't work out like we thought, baby wasn't ready to come out. So we get him back when we get him back.\u201d\n\nPer MASN\u2019s Mark Zuckerman, Hudson flew from Los Angeles to Phoenix on Thursday morning, the day after the team\u2019s NLDS Game 5 win, and the birth took longer than expected. Hudson expects to be back with the team for Game 2, according to the Washington Post.\n\nDaniel Hudson is one of the few members of the Nationals bullpen trusted by manager Dave Martinez. (Photo by Harry How/Getty Images)\n\nHow will the Nationals replace Daniel Hudson?\n\nAs great as the news is for Hudson \u2014 and it is absolutely his right to take the game off for a special day with his family \u2014 he leaves a significant hole in a bullpen so thin that the Nationals turned to their rotation multiple times during the NLDS for late-innings work.\n\nNationals No. 4 starter Anibal Sanchez is slated to start for Game 1. Behind him is likely No. 5 starter Austin Voth in a piggyback role. Voth has not appeared in a game since Sept. 27.\n\nMartinez also mentioned Tanner Rainey (3.91 ERA in 2019) and Fernando Rodney (4.05 ERA) as possibilities, and you\u2019d imagine former closer Sean Doolittle, who closed out Game 5 of the NLDS, could be called as well. Wander Suero (4.54 ERA) is the designated player for Hudson to replace when he returns.\n\n\u201cWe have enough weapons in that bullpen to hold off,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cIt's one game, we'll figure it out. When the game starts we'll see where we're at and then we'll go from there.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The Nationals will be without one of their few dependable relievers to open the NLCS.", "authors": ["Jack Baer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/yOSu14edSxZ6gNnLzu4nhg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04ODkuNg--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/KCqYs7kn0xgoSlTfxgalKw--~B/aD0yOTQwO3c9NDIzMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/3f767090-ec7b-11e9-9b7b-6be6af753cc7", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
