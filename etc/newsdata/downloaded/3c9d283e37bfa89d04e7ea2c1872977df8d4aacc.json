The two crashes killed a total of 346 people.\n\nFriday's report and others also take aim at Boeing's corporate culture which some critics say emphasizes profit over safety, as some employees in safety oversight roles complained of \"undue pressure\" to accelerate the development and certification of the 737 Max while keeping costs down.\n\nIn recent weeks, some aerospace industry analysts have called for Muilenburg's ouster.\n\n\"The 737 MAX will end up years from now as a Harvard Business School case study in mismanagement, and the buck stops with the CEO,\" analyst Earnest Arvai at AirInsight wrote last week.\n\nLeeham.net analyst Bjorn Fehrm said that it is \"time to start to criticize Boeing's business culture and to look at the board and the top management.\"", "description": "With all 737 Max jets grounded, the board voted to strip CEO Dennis Muilenburg of his dual role.
