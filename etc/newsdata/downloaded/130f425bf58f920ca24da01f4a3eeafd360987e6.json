You only need to check your email address against these dumps to understand the full extent of the problem -- Have I Been Pwned being a useful tool for these scans -- and no matter how careful you may be of your own personal security, you've likely been caught in a company breach or two.\n\nAs this information has been leaked, some fraudsters will collect and correlate credentials linked to an email account, throw them into the phishing email to create an aura of validity, and hope that ensuing panic will pressure victims enough into paying a ransom, on pain of having webcam footage and browser histories leaked to their nearest and dearest.\n\nTypically, these ransom demands -- in the same way as ransomware -- are made in Bitcoin.\n\nCNET: Android exploit leaves some Pixel, Galaxy phones vulnerable to hacks\n\nVendors have wised up to these forms of scams and detection rules are being put in place to block these messages. Not to be deterred, email text is now swapped out wth images -- the exception being Bitcoin wallet plaintext addresses for easy copying -- and in some cases, .PDF attachments may contain threat messages.\n\nEmails that contain a Bitcoin wallet address are now often barred by SEGs, and so to bypass these rules, fraudsters are now turning to Litecoin (LTC).\n\n\"Previous iterations showed a gradual shift away from identifiable patterns and to alternative cryptocurrencies, in an attempt to foil SEG bitcoin-detection rules,\" Cofense says. \"The current emails appear to be crafted to contain very few searchable word patterns.\"\n\nSee also: Four major dating apps expose precise locations of 10 million users\n\nLTC is a fair substitute to BTC, as would be Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). While there are countless altcoins out there, alternatives still need to be accessible enough by an average individual to ensure the scam is successful.\n\nThis isn't the only new phishing technique the company has recently watched come into existence. In September, Cofense said that percentage-based URL encoding is now also being utilized to trick email gateways by hiding malicious payloads in encoded URL data.\n\nPrevious and related coverage\n\nHave a tip?
