It\u2019s Michael!\u201d he says, though we\u2019ve met before and he\u2019s very famous. It\u2019s early evening and we\u2019re in the lobby of Stipe\u2019s London hotel, two minutes\u2019 walk from the Extinction Rebellion protest in Trafalgar Square. All is shiny, stately and calm, though we can hear the occasional police helicopter above our heads. This pleases Stipe. He\u2019s a supporter of the protest; in fact he\u2019s just released his first solo single, Your Capricious Soul, with a pay-as-much-as-you-like price tag, all monies going to Extinction Rebellion.\n\n\u201cI mean,\u201d he says, \u201cI came into London today, and I can\u2019t think of a better excuse to be late for a meeting than a bunch of people who are literally looking at the end of us \u2013 and we\u2019re taking a bunch of species with us if we go \u2013 and trying to do something about it \u2026 Oh! Have one of these!\u201d He digs into his bag and gives me his own specially designed XR sticker.\n\nWe take the stairs to his suite \u2013 \u201cI asked for a small room,\u201d he says, laughing at himself, \u201cbut they insisted\u201d \u2013 where Stipe fiddles expertly with the coffee machine and shows me how he likes to slice a pear. \u201cYou cut it like this, and then you can stand the core up on a plate, like a column. Then you photograph it from all sides and animate the images, so it looks like the column is spinning,\u201d he says.\n\nStipe, as you can tell, is not your usual pop star. In fact, he\u2019s not really a pop star at all these days, though he\u2019s working on solo material, occasionally produces other bands, such as Fischerspooner, and is still best known as the singer in REM. Now 59, slight and neat, he has the hard-to-pin-down feel of a much younger person. There\u2019s no weight about him, no sense of him becoming settled in his ways. Instead, he reminds me of a curious faun: skittery, friendly, interested but naturally shy. He\u2019s a talker, but he\u2019s not dominant; he doesn\u2019t swamp you with big ego charisma, though he\u2019s utterly charming. How astonishing that he became so famous, I think. You wouldn\u2019t imagine he\u2019d be able to bear it, despite his ease in a suite. Instead of a lead singer, Stipe has the air of an artist, regarding the world from unusual angles.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Stipe at the launch of Our Interference Times: A Visual Record in Berlin earlier this month. Photograph: Adam Berry/Getty Images\n\nAnd actually, since REM split, in 2011, Stipe has been just this, making installations and video work, sculpture and photography. He filmed his first artistic mentor, Jeremy Ayers, dancing for seven minutes, then set it to house music composed on a Moog. He makes books and experimental sculptures in his studio in New York, where he lives with his long-term partner, Thomas (pronounced Tohma) Dozol, who\u2019s also a photographer. In fact, in the years since REM, Stipe has been quite at ease with exploring his art, with not performing. \u201cIt feels like the real me,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m working in all these different mediums and it makes sense.\u201d At one point he grew the most enormous wild man beard, though it\u2019s trimmed short today. He wears a green polo shirt, jeans, green socks and a beautiful large gold ring on his left hand.\n\nStipe is in London as part of a short promotional tour, with a double set of duties. It\u2019s the 25th anniversary of REM\u2019s Monster, and there\u2019s a special box set coming out, so he\u2019s been chatting about that to journalists, alongside REM musicians Peter Buck and Mike Mills. Separately, he\u2019s also here to discuss his new book of photographs, the second in a series made in collaboration with other people. The first, Volume 1, came out last year: it featured just 35 photographs and was made with artist/curator Jonathan Berger. The second, Our Interference Times: A Visual Record, with writer Douglas Coupland, has just been published. And it\u2019s Interference Times that we\u2019re here to contemplate. We put the book on the table, open it at page one\u2026 \u201cA window,\u201d says Stipe. \u201cIn black and white. And kind of shitty, like a shitty cellphone picture. Every image after this is colour, like boom, here we are in real life. Or fantasy life. It\u2019s basically the mind of Michael.\u201d\n\nOur Interference Times is a far weightier tome than Volume 1, and has a different tone. Volume 1 played with ideas of celebrity, intimacy and family, showcasing snaps of a young River Phoenix in the back of a car, of Kurt Cobain\u2019s hands. There were also a couple of pictures, not taken by Stipe, but owned by him, of James Dean, of Marilyn Monroe as a baby, and an outrageous Esquire dinner party at the former New York nightclub Studio 54 featuring Andy Warhol and Donald Trump. I interviewed Stipe onstage at the ICA about Volume 1 last year: we noted that few of the portraits showed people looking straight at the camera. Stipe is too offbeat, too wary for that.\n\nThe new book is less densely populated, though there are pictures of people, and those without humans show evidence of our interference with nature\u2019s design. Stipe talks about one, which seems to be there to deliberately annoy neat freaks. It\u2019s a picture of a manhole cover, a pavement and a fence. None of them fit together properly. It\u2019s maddening \u2026 though Stipe sees it differently.\n\n\u201cYou have these striations from a natural material, made into concrete,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have these stones laid out as a mosaic, a manhole cover. And then a tree that\u2019s been cut into slabs. It\u2019s man attempting to create order from chaos. A lot of the book is really about that old waltz between man and nature.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Fountain, Nimes, by Michael Stipe.\n\nActually, there are a lot of regimented grids in the book, though these are often out of whack, or they\u2019re details of something that you can\u2019t quite work out, that you think is something different. On more than one occasion, you find yourself turning your head, wondering: What IS that?, until you see. Photographs are laid out to play off each other, with one almost chatting to its facing companion. For instance, here\u2019s a photograph of a naked, painted man\u2026 \u201cI painted him,\u201d says Stipe. \u201cI took the picture from on top of a ladder, he\u2019s lying on the studio floor. I turned it upside down, so he looks like Icarus falling from the sky.\u201d Opposite this floating, delicate figure is a shot of a heavy marble statue of Hermes fastening his sandal, which Stipe saw in Versailles. The contrast between the fluidity and solidity enhances both.\n\nOften what Stipe and Coupland, who are old friends, were interested in \u2013 especially Stipe \u2013 is the interaction between our old analogue lives and our new digital ones. There are many photographs of photographs: mobile-phone snaps of a computer screen displaying an older picture created with a film camera. Stipe is fascinated with how this doesn\u2019t really work, how the different media don\u2019t talk to each other very well, even though they\u2019re essentially doing the same thing. The pixels shudder, the focus is kaput. He\u2019s interested in how the past and future are overlapping, but ineptly, inelegantly. Does this mean that the past was better? After all, this is a book he\u2019s promoting, not a computer game, and one for which he spent a lot of time getting the details right. He wanted the images to bleed right out to the edges, he wanted the pages to only be numbered once in every five. When I mention that I love how the book smells (like old books), he\u2019s really chuffed: he was careful to choose a particular ink, with a particularly pleasing aroma. \u201cI like that the book is an artefact,\u201d he says. \u201cTen years ago, I did a whole series of pieces about books, because we all thought that books were going away and we\u2019d all be looking at everything backlit from now on. But we were wrong.\u201d\n\nOne of the shots is of his lyrics to Hope, from Up, and Stipe mentions that the song is about a man trying to save his own life by turning to a seemingly ridiculous experimental medical procedure (injecting himself with alligator DNA). He connects it to this same analogue-meets-digital feeling.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Michael Stipe, Douglas Coupland and Jeff Koons ata New York art show in 2008. Photograph: Sipa Press/Rex Features\n\n\u201cThis weird 30-year period that we\u2019re in,\u201d he says. \u201cActually, I think it\u2019s going to be 40 years \u2013 until the next shoe drops, when it\u2019s like: \u2018Holy fuck, where are we?\u2019 The next shoe dropping will be something mad like a world leader announcing: \u2018Yes, in fact we are living among aliens, or they are living among us. And we\u2019ve known it for 80 years and we didn\u2019t tell you because we thought it would freak you out.\u2019 Or, the next shoe dropping is another Fukushima, but on a grander scale. Or it\u2019s that medical research advances so quickly that suddenly there\u2019s a cure for everything, but you have to be a billionaire to be able to afford it.\u201d\n\nWhat he means, I think, is that the future is amazing and terrifying, and almost upon us: how are we dealing with it? How is it changing us? He wonders about social media. He used to post pictures on Instagram, and there was a time when he\u2019d put up selfies taken with famous people, but cut the other famous person out of frame, just leaving himself, grinning like a loon. \u201cYes, cutting Salman Rushdie\u2019s face in half, or Patti Smith, or Tilda Swinton or Sofia Coppola. With me laughing or smiling in that centre. I thought it was funny.\u201d He\u2019s stopped now, moved his Instagram to private, and has no Twitter presence at all. At one point last year, his website was just a series of mad moving images, though now it\u2019s promoting Your Capricious Soul.\n\nHe\u2019s not frightened of the future; he\u2019s just interested.\n\n\u201cVisually, with digital technology we\u2019re actually coming closer to nature,\u201d he says, \u201cIf you look at anything natural under a microscope, it breaks down into fractals. And we are now looking at the world in fractals, through pixels, rather than a halftone, which is how we used to see images with print.\u201d\n\nStipe has taken thousands of photographs in his time: about 37,000, he thinks, kept in \u201ca house\u201d and in storage facilities. He\u2019s a massive hoarder (when he puts on a jumper later, he mentions that it\u2019s one that he bought in the 1990s, and found the other day when going through a storage container), and he started photography young, taking a course when he was 13, then studying photography and painting at the University of Georgia before leaving to form REM. And he often used his training and art sensibilities while in the band \u2013 directing videos, overlooking graphics and stage design. His photographs became LP covers, and he used his camera as a diary when touring. Despite all this, he says that he would have preferred to have been a fine artist, but he doesn\u2019t like his drawing line. In Our Interference Times, there\u2019s some of his drawing near the front \u2013 a profile, drawn when he was very young, some school work, a copy of some graphic writing. \u201cI liked how it looked, which is very unusual for me,\u201d he says. There\u2019s also a picture of a smashed lightbulb, representing an incident that happened when Stipe was three years old.\n\n\u201cI bit into a lightbulb because I wanted to be the filament,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd the only way that I knew to get inside was to bite through. So I did. My father and my uncle got the glass out of my mouth, they got some glue, and they put the lightbulb back together to make sure I hadn\u2019t swallowed any glass. I distinctly remember doing it. The desire to be the filament\u2026\u201d\n\nTo become the light? I say. That\u2019s an easy metaphor.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Fotoautomat, Arles: \u2018The thing about digital technology \u2013 and social media, certainly \u2013 is that it\u2019s changing the way we see ourselves\u2019 Photograph: \u00a9 Michael Stipe\n\n\u201cWell, I was a year out of scarlet fever,\u201d says Stipe. \u201cI had scarlet fever as a two-year-old and it boils your brain. You use your synapses differently. And that\u2019s become part of my mythology of myself, and I go along with it. I do think differently and I know that. I\u2019m neither synesthetic nor on the spectrum, but there are similarities. I talk differently, I know!\u201d\n\nStipe\u2019s phone buzzes: his friends, fashion designer Erdem and Erdem\u2019s sister, Sara, a documentary maker, are in the lobby. They\u2019re going for dinner, but Stipe has something he wants to say first.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m worried about people that are trying to eliminate or delete or get rid of the mistakes,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like, no, no, no wait, that\u2019s where brilliance lives. That\u2019s where instinct lives. That\u2019s where God lives. That\u2019s the spark. You know, when the book was printed, I looked at it, and I got halfway through and I was like: \u2018This is such a weird book. It\u2019s so weird.\u2019 I\u2019d thought, as I used to do with my lyric writing, I thought I was being so clear and so obvious and actually overstating my points. Overdoing it, really. But actually, the book is weird. It might take a bit of work, but I feel like if you go from beginning to end and you close the book, you might look up and see something a little bit differently than you had before.\u201d\n\nStipe puts on a beanie hat, and his 90s jumper, and we go down to the lobby. He wants to check on the Extinction Rebellion protest before dinner. Erdem is a bit worried \u2013 he doesn\u2019t like crowds, in case they turn nasty \u2013 but we all walk to Trafalgar Square, to wander between the tents and the flags, to dart through the crowd around an anarcho-rap band, the people queuing for vegan curry. It\u2019s like the Green Fields at Glastonbury. And Stipe is utterly at home, moving swiftly between everyone, always looking, never stopping. I leave him there, in the dark, completely happy.\n\nOur Interference Times: A Visual Record by Michael Stipe with Douglas Coupland is published by Damiani (\u00a345).
