To continue, the chapter needed at least two survivors to serve on the board. But with no one willing or able to take the helm, the organization decided to yield to the reality of time's passage.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way around it. We are a dying organization,\u201d Hedley said.\n\nOn Dec. 7, 1941, Japanese pilots decimated Pearl Harbor, a U.S. Navy base in Hawaii, killing around 2,400 Americans and injuring around 1,200. For the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service, it was a surprise preemptive military strike, one that drew America into World War II.\n\nThe Pearl Harbor Survivors Association formed in the mid-1950s, offering a meeting opportunity for survivors. At its peak, the organization had nearly 30,000 members across dozens of chapters, according to The Union-Tribune.\n\nSan Diego\u2019s chapter was formed in 1963, drawing many veterans because of the city\u2019s longstanding ties to the Navy. It was at one point one of the nation's largest chapters.\n\n\u201cI think we like to get together because Pearl Harbor was a one-of-a-kind experience,\u201d Bob Ruffato told The Union-Tribune. \u201cUnless you were there, it\u2019s hard to understand what it was like.\u201d\n\nPEARL HARBOR SAILORS LAID TO REST ON SAME DAY IN NJ, KANSAS 78 YEARS AFTER 1941 ATTACK\n\nSaturday\u2019s meeting took place at a church in La Mesa, about 12 miles east of San Diego, drawing a crowd of about 100 people in all. Many were relatives, friends or admirers.\n\nAfter lunch, the chapter board held \u201cits shortest meeting ever,\u201d before Hedley said a prayer and called roll, the paper reported.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cWe are done,\u201d he said after reportedly tapping a gavel on the table.", "description": "The San Diego chapter of the Pearl Harbor Survivors Association, one of the largest in the nation, held its final meeting on Saturday with only seven service members in attendance, according to a report.", "authors": ["Bradford Betz", "Bradford Betz Is An Editor For Fox News.
