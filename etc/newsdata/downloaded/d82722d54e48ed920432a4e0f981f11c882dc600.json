The draft stresses accountability for statistics fraud, in order to guarantee the accuracy of data and ensure the credibility of statistical work. The Beijing News comments:\n\nRevision of the Statistics Law this time involves many aspects and articles. It is in accordance with the new situation, and the problems and challenges faced in acquiring accurate data, as well as the development tendency toward a new economy and new technology. The draft is conducive to improving China's statistical work, in order to provide more accurate, timely and efficient information for decision-making.\n\nThe core of statistical work and statistical data is its authenticity and accuracy, and that is why the draft seeks to eliminate fraudulent statistics.\n\nLegislation is the most effective means to safeguard the authenticity and accuracy of statistical work. It is of great significance to establish legal accountability for falsifying data and introduce strict penalties for statistical fraud. According to the draft, statistics departments and officials and local Party and government organs will be held accountable for statistical fraud.\n\nTo improve the credibility of statistical work, the draft stipulates that enterprises or individuals that falsify statistics will face being recorded in a statistical credit system and face punishment for their wrongdoing.\n\nMeanwhile, the draft also enhances legislation for the stronger supervision of statistics. According to Article 43 of the draft, the National Bureau of Statistics will be responsible for the inspection and supervision of local statistics works. As is the case in other fields such as poverty alleviation work, it could consider introducing independent third-parties to help conduct the inspection and supervision work, in order to guarantee the independence and credibility of the inspection work.\n\nApplication of modern technologies is another highlight of the draft aimed at improving statistical accuracy and authenticity. According to the draft, modern information technology, such as big data, cloud computing and artificial intelligence, will be applied in statistical work. These new technologies can help improve efficiency and reduce statistical errors.\n\nIt is expected that when implemented the revised law will enhance the accuracy of the country's statistical work.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/10/5d9e78e8a310cf3e97a0618c.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
