Food, lifestyle...there are many things in common. I find myself feeling at home there too.'\n\nThe horse race, which is about to celebrate its third event at the end of October, encourages guests to dress up in formal clothing like Ascot\n\nAriadna said she was determined the event, which is set to be hosted in Mallorca for the first time next weekend, would have a 'relaxed luxury' feel to it\n\n'I have been very lucky meeting people there, everybody is very kind and makes me feel very welcome.'\n\nWhat is trotting? Trotting is a form of racing in which the jockey sits in a small cart behind the horse and must prevent the horse from breaking into a gallop. In a similar way to the British traditional horse race, bets are often taken on the winner. It has been popular in Majorca and Menorca for at least 200 years.\n\nAriadna had long been fascinated with horse racing events, like Epsom, Goodwood and Ascot, and felt inspired by Menorca's own hippodromes and unique type of horse race - trotting.\n\nAnd in May 2017, having observed the 'relaxed luxury' of the horse races from afar, she decided to take the plunge and launch her own event in Menorca.\n\nHaving spoken to the Menorcan tourist board, hotels and hippodrome to organise the event, Ariadna said she started to feel nervous.\n\n'The first year was like a big \"question mark,\" she revealed. 'Nobody had any idea about what we were trying to do.'\n\n'I had in my mind the idea of a UK Racing event very clearly but nobody was sure if people would arrive well dressed for the event.'\n\nBut Ariadna said she was shocked by the success of the event, saying: 'To my surprise people were amazing.'\n\nThe dress code for Ariadna's event is similar to Ascot's, with guests encouraged to wear hats for the race\n\nJockeys race in the Spanish tradition of 'trotting', which sees them sit in a small carriage behind the horse and be pulled along at speed\n\nAriadna told how she was astonished when the first year of the event saw 1,000 attendees (pictured, guests enjoy the sun at the 2017 race)\n\nAriadna revealed she was 'overwhelmed' by the success of Hats and Horse's first year, and was determined it should continue (pictured, left, with guests)\n\nShe revealed: 'The Mahon Hippodrome was unrecognisable for the first year, full of colour, hats and fun. We had nearly 1000 people there.'\n\nSpanish model and actress Ana Mil\u00e1n and European royals including Prince Boris of Bulgaria were among the attendees.\n\nBut she acknowledged it hadn't been easy to get locals to adapt the 'Ascot' style dress code.\n\n'In the first year, men were a little bit shy,' she said. 'But the English groups bring the full dress code which helps show the locals what to wear.'\n\nAriadna said the Hippodrome was 'unrecognisable' for the first year, with the founder suggesting it was 'full of colour, hats and fun' (pictured right, with an attendee)\n\nAriadna told how she'd been inspired to found the horse racing event after falling in love with an Englishman (pictured, with her partner David at the event)\n\nMonths later, she visited Ascot for the first time, and admitted she was completely in awe of the occasion.\n\nShe explained: 'At the races in England you can feel the incredible vibe of the excitement of the hooves thundering past, as you're dressed impeccably with a glass of Champagne in your hand. What could be better?'\n\nRecalling the event, she said the 'ambiance and dress code' had inspired her to make her own event even bigger and better the following year.\n\nShe went on: 'It is amazing to see people well dressed, excited to arrive there, going down from the car, showing off their outfit, listening to live music and having fun.'\n\nAriadna said the event 'expressed it's own personality' and blended Spanish and English customs (pictured, with her partner David, left)\n\nAriadna, pictured enjoying the first year of the event, said she hoped the event captured a similar excitement as Ascot\n\nDetermined to build on the success of the first year, she hosted the second event in May 2018 and said she 'took a risk' by moving venues.\n\n'The 2nd year was full of expectations and we took the risk of moving to another Hippodrome in Ciutadella at the other end of the island,' she explained.\n\n'We were close to 1500 for the second edition with the numbers growing steadily from the year before as more people became aware of the event.'\n\nAhead of the event's third year, which takes place in Palma de Mallorca on 26 October, Ariadna said she hoped the move in island would bring a new 'personality' to the race.\n\nAriadna went on to host the event for the second time in May 2018, having been inspired by her first trip to Ascot to make it bigger and better than before (pictured, at the second Hats and Horses event)\n\nAriadna said some men had been ' a little shy' with their fashion in the first year, but by the second year, many adapted to the English style (pictured, one gentleman and female guest in dapper outfits at the event)\n\nAlongside horse racing and relaxing in the sun, Ariadna's event sees live music entertain attendees (pictured)\n\n'The races are different in Mallorca and Menorca as they express their own personality through their own people, horses, with a special local breed and through the type of racing,' she explained.\n\n'Mallorca has a very nice hippodrome and, nearby, you are able to enjoy the best beaches in the Mediterranean, with lots of excellent services, hotels, somehow, the Mallorca environment brings the idea of sea, summer, good weather\u2026 into the event.'\n\n'The fact that you can fly to Mallorca easily, go to the centre, find the best shops and brands, local products, high quality services and offer makes the idea to spend one weekend in Mallorca very appealing.'\n\nAnd despite the tropical location, Ariadna said she was always keen to incorporate aspects of English culture into the event.\n\n'We try to do details referred to the English culture like Pimms in the aperitif for example, or the roast beef offered as part of the gastronomic delights available,' she explained.\n\n'We try to fit the local products from Mallorca in the event to have the perfect combination between residents and tourists, which is the best way to know each other.'\n\nShe added that as well as the races, the Mallorca Hippodrome were preparing exhibitions of Classic Doma, a type of coordinated display of the horse being under close control of the rider, pony races and of course trotting.\n\nAriadna said she had high hopes the event would become one of 'exceptional tradition', explaining that the move from spring to autumn allowed for an escape from the 'blustery and cold UK weather'.\n\nAs well as the traditional races (pictured), the jockeys have prepared to perform a traditional Doma\n\nThe founder said she hoped the event would allow Brits to get away from the 'blustery and cold UK weather' (pictured, one attendee enjoying the sun at last year's event)", "description": "Ariadna Vilata, 40, from the Pyrenees, revealed how her fascination with English horse racing inspired her to launch her own version Hats and Horses, which has been dubbed the Spanish Ascot.", "authors": ["Harriet Johnston For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/16/19795554-0-image-a-13_1571241596691.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
