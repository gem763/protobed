How rural Vietnamese make treacherous journey to Europe", "language": "en", "text": "HANOI (Reuters) - For Vietnamese seeking to embark on the treacherous journey to a new life in Europe, a key question can be: \u201cGrass\u201d or \u201cVIP\u201d?\n\nPeople-smugglers offer different levels of service at vastly different prices, anti-trafficking experts, migrants and their family members told Reuters.\n\n\u201cIf he took the \u2018VIP\u2019 route, there\u2019s a 1% chance he was captured. It\u2019s the safest and most expensive route,\u201d said Nguyen Dinh Gia, who fears his son Nguyen Dinh Luong was among 39 migrants found dead in a truck container near London last week. Most are believed to have been Vietnamese.\n\n\u201cIf he took the grass route, I\u2019m 100 percent sure he died,\u201d Gia said. \u201cThe vehicle in this incident ... that\u2019s the grass route.\u201d\n\nMany trafficked Vietnamese end up working in illegal cannabis farms in Britain but \u201cgrass\u201d in this case is a slang word used in Vietnam to describe something as dirt cheap.\n\nThat option, which involves travelling from the Southeast Asian country overland to Europe, means arduous months of secretive movement by car and even walking.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll often go from Vietnam into China, and then cross into Russia,\u201d said Mimi Vu, an independent anti-trafficking advocate based in Ho Chi Minh City.\n\n\u201cThis is usually done by automobile, and then they\u2019ll go from Russia into one of the neighbouring countries like Ukraine or Latvia on foot, crossing forests and mountains only at night.\u201d\n\nTaking the \u201cVIP\u201d route typically involves using fake or recycled passports to fly from Vietnam to Europe via a third country in a process that takes days instead of months, but comes at a much higher cost, she added.\n\n\u201cHe said, if I take the \u2018grass\u2019 route, it costs 3,000 pounds to go from France to Britain. But if he takes the \u2018VIP\u2019 route, it\u2019ll cost 11,000 pounds,\u201d Gia said of his 20-year-old son.\n\nSeveral migrants, their families and experts gave the 11,000 pounds ($14,000) figure as the going rate to be smuggled from Germany or France to Britain.\n\n\u201cLuong told me he chose the \u2018VIP\u2019 route, so I don\u2019t understand how he ended up on this path,\u201d Gia added.\n\nUNDERGROUND JOURNEY\n\nThat could be because there was no \u201cVIP\u201d route for Luong\u2019s sea crossing from mainland Europe into Britain.\n\nHowever Vietnamese migrants arrive in Europe, stowing away on a container truck is the only way to take that final step across the Channel, migrants and anti-trafficking experts said.\n\n\u201cParents pay for the \u2018VIP\u2019 service because they think it\u2019ll be safer but what they don\u2019t realise is that their son or daughter will end up in the same container truck as someone who paid for the cheap journey,\u201d said Vu.\n\nLuong\u2019s father said he had tried to persuade his son, whose \u201cgrass\u201d route had taken him across Asia to Russia in October 2017, then Ukraine, where he lived with other migrants in a warehouse for six months, not to press on.\n\n\u201cHe said in Britain it\u2019s more fun and that there\u2019s a community there,\u201d Nguyen Dinh Gia said.\n\nIn April 2018, Luong arrived in Germany, the premier staging ground for Vietnamese migrants in Europe.\n\n\u201cMost of the time he moved by vehicle to get there, but he also had to walk about seven hours,\u201d Gia said of Luong\u2019s trip.\n\nThe heart of Germany\u2019s Vietnamese community is the Dong Xuan Centre in east Berlin, a vast wholesale market which an investigation this year by the city\u2019s public TV station found was also a hub for people smuggling.\n\nBerlin city police confirmed the report\u2019s main findings.\n\nCovering an area the size of several soccer fields, the Centre is packed with Vietnamese nail studios, hairdressers, food halls, textile sellers and cafes.\n\nAt lunchtime on Sunday it was bustling with locals, Asians and eastern Europeans shopping or sharing a meal.\n\nThe administrative office by the Centre\u2019s entrance was closed and nobody picked up the phone at the number advertised on the door.\n\nTRANSFER CHAIN\n\nJourneys made by Vietnamese migrants are often broken up into stages, at the end of which traffickers request cash from families before they can proceed further.\n\nWhen Luong travelled to France from Germany, his father was asked to pay $18,000 in cash for the trip so far.\n\n\u201cSomeone called me and a guy showed up in a vehicle and took the money,\u201d Gia said. \u201cHe was a man, about 30 years old.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen Luong called home to say he had arrived safely, that was the signal for us to prepare money.\u201d\n\nLuong lived in France for almost 18 months, working illegally in a restaurant there.\n\nBui Thac, whose nephew Bui Phan Thang is feared among the container dead, said debt collectors in Vietnam often hide their faces when receiving cash from families.\n\n\u201cSometimes they ask to meet at a or near a bus stop to receive money,\u201d said Thac. \u201cThey have their own money transfer chain, which doesn\u2019t touch the banks.\u201d\n\nHaving paid his way to mainland Europe and, despite his father\u2019s wishes, Luong embarked on his final journey to Britain.\n\nLate on Thursday night, Gia received a call from a contact overseas with direct knowledge of the fatal container accident.\n\n\u201cI hope you understand. The vehicle was in an accident,\u201d Luong\u2019s father recalled the contact saying.\n\n\u201cEveryone died.\u201d", "description": "For Vietnamese seeking to embark on the treacherous journey to a new life in Europe, a key question can be: \"Grass\" or \"VIP\"?", "authors": ["James Pearson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
