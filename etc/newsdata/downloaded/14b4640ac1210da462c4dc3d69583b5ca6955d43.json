But she says that almost from day one of her heartbreaking diagnosis she refused to contemplate death.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nDrawing on her experience as a yoga teacher and shamanic healer, Leah used her mind as medicine.\n\n\u201cI sat myself down and thought, \u2018How do I want to live now?\u2019\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe focus is all on dying. So I thought, \u2018How can I get the most out of my life, who do I want to be?\u2019 You can still live a rich life whatever s*** is thrown at you, and I probably wouldn\u2019t have thought like that before being diagnosed.\u201d\n\nAnd Leah\u2019s optimism meant that while she had put some practical plans in place for when her time came, she always tried to keep her focus always on living.\n\n(Image: Leah's Cancer Fund)\n\n(Image: ITV/REX/Shutterstock)\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a time when they said to me again last year \u2013 go home, spend time with your family, get your affairs in order. Those are the tough times, and that\u2019s when I really strive to change my thinking.\n\n\u201cI believe in putting a positive vision of the future out there, I believe we can draw to us what we believe.\n\n\u201cIf I was to spend my time focusing on that I am not going to last until Christmas, imagining what my funeral was going to be like and who was going to read the eulogies, I believe energetically you draw that to you.\n\n\u201cI spend time imagining myself way in the future. I haven\u2019t made plans, I have certain things in order, but you have to do what\u2019s right for you.\n\n\u201cA friend of mine had made a box of life messages for when she wasn\u2019t there. But I\u2019m not like that. I believe you exist on in people\u2019s hearts.\u201d\n\n(Image: Leah Bracknell/Instagram)\n\nLeah found solace in her blog, Something Beginning With C, and was writing a book she hopes will help others in similar situations and their families.\n\nAnd far from seeing herself as a cancer victim, or battling cancer, she styled herself a \u201ccancer rebel\u201d, inspired by joining the Extinction Rebellion climate change protests in London earlier this year.\n\nLeah said: \u201cA lot of the labels around cancer are very military \u2013 you battle cancer, you keep fighting it.\n\n\"A lot of language is very negative \u2013 victim, sufferer, cancer-stricken. But that was not how I would describe myself.\n\n\u201cSo I thought, \u2018How can I reinvent that for myself?\u2019 It was a pretty brutal diagnosis I had \u2013 stage 4 and there was nothing they could do.\n\n\u201cI was looking at months. So the actor in me thought I don\u2019t like this casting, how can I cast myself in a more heroic role?\n\n\u201cThe idea of rebel had been used by Extinction Rebellion and there were people like me \u2013 grandparents, children, a diverse section of people saying, \u2018No, we don\u2019t agree with what\u2019s happening, we want to make change\u2019.\u201d\n\n(Image: Leah Bracknell/Instagram)\n\nLeah said from the start that she would go to any lengths to live and embarked on an intensive protocol using cannabis oil containing THC, inspired by evidence that it can cause cancer cell death. It also helped her with the effects of chemotherapy.\n\nShe had never been a recreational user of the drug and for her it was a big step to see cannabis as a form of medicine \u2013 but it is one she has no regrets about. In the end she made her own cannabis oil from the plant.\n\nShe said: \u201cI\u2019m running out of time, I\u2019m terminal and I\u2019m doing all I can to prolong that and I\u2019ve also broken the law. I\u2019ve made myself into a criminal because I used cannabis.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to do what I\u2019m told \u2013 and that includes dying when you say I\u2019m going to die, that includes accepting your prognosis, that includes people telling me what medicines I should or shouldn\u2019t take.\n\n\u201cThankfully I\u2019m not in any pain. I struggle with getting out of breath quite easily, that\u2019s the frustrating thing for me. In the past I would\u2019ve used the cannabis. I used it for pain relief and while having chemotherapy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m aware there needs to be more research but I\u2019m a big advocate for it being something that should be available to people. I believe it worked for me on several levels.\u201d", "description": "Emmerdale star Leah Bracknell has passed away aged just 55, but she was determined to spend her final days living a good life with the people she loved the most", "authors": ["Amanda Killelea", "Zoe Forsey", "Image", "Ken Mckay Itv Rex Shutterstock", "Itv", "Leah'S Cancer Fund", "Itv Rex Shutterstock", "Leah Bracknell Instagram"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article18301022.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/4_Lorraine-TV-show-London-UK-20-Dec-2017.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
