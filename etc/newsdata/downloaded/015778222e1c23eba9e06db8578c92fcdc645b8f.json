Chadha wanted Springsteen's blessing to make a film version of Manzoor's book, \"Greetings From Bury Park,\" which is both a memoir and a love letter to Springsteen and his music.\n\n\"I went, 'Hi Bruce, my name is Gurinder, I did 'Bend It Like Beckham.' I want to make a movie of this, please can you help us,'\" Chadha recalled in an interview with CNN. \"He sort of went, 'Sounds good.' And I thought, 'Oh my God, did that just happen?'\"\n\nThe film tells the story of Pakistani teen Javed (played by Viveik Kalra), who in 1987 becomes a devotee of Springsteen and his music while coming of age in the British town of Luton.\n\nRead More", "description": "Gurinder Chadha can thank her decision to seize the moment for her latest project, \"Blinded by the Light.\"", "authors": ["Lisa Respers France"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190807123731-01-blinded-by-the-light-movie-super-tease.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-08-14"}
