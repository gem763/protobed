In Scent Memories, the Cut asks people about the scents they associate with different times in their lives.\n\nNext up is Chlo\u00eb Sevigny, actor, model, director and designer. Sevigny recently teamed up with Alia Raza and Ezra Woods of R\u00e9gime des Fleurs to create Little Flower, her personal take on her favorite flower, the rose. With a juicy mix of peony, palo santo, pomelo, blackcurrant, and crisp black tea, it\u2019s a refreshing, non-powdery update on the traditional scent. The Cut caught up with Sevigny to talk pierogies, pranks, and popcorn.\n\nMy first scent memory is: Barbasol. My dad\u2019s shaving cream. We also used it on Halloween to create shaving cream houses. We would stick a pin in the end and burn it, and it makes this really small hole. Then we\u2019d just spray it and it would shoot really, really far. So yes: Halloween and Dad in front of the sink, for many reasons. It was also his favorite holiday.\n\nHappiness smells like: Popcorn. It\u2019s my favorite food and it also means sitting in the dark, watching a movie. I can\u2019t go into a movie theater and not buy popcorn. Especially when you go to the Four Seasons in Los Angeles and they put all kinds of wacky stuff in there. But any popcorn smells like happiness.\n\nLove smells like: Sweat, endorphins, and warm skin. Arpege, because my mother wore it. New York, because it\u2019s my home and I love it. When you get off the plane and smell the New York smell; it\u2019s very specific. Any of those locational smells smell like love. When I get off in Miami, I almost always cry because I spent so much time there as a child with my family and it\u2019s a very specific smell, so I get misty-eyed every time I arrive in Miami.\n\nHeartbreak or loss smells like: Oof. Xanax? [laughs] Salt and tears. What does a pit in the stomach smell like? Or anxiety? It\u2019s a raw, empty, and hollow smell. It also smells like money and paper \u2014 a little retail therapy.\n\n\ufeffFriendship smells like: Pierogies from Veselka. And sweaty dance floors.\n\nRegret smells like: Lilac. It\u2019s wistful, romantic and bittersweet.\n\nSuccess smells like: Blood, sweat, tears, and coffee.\n\nA pleasant surprise smells like: Lily of the Valley because they\u2019re surprisingly bright.\n\nMy home smells like: R\u00e9gime des Fleurs. I have the Swans candle, the Leis interior spray, and I wear Little Flower. And it also smells like me. Everybody\u2019s always like Oh my God your house always smells like you, so it smells like whatever I smell like, which is hopefully pleasant. Some sort of pheromone, which has worked okay for me thus far.\n\nVacation smells like: Aloe.\n\nThe worst smell is: Low tide.\n\nSunday morning smells like: Frankincense, church incense, and newspaper.\n\nMonday morning smells like: Geranium\u2060 \u2014 fresh and new; you\u2019re starting over on Mondays.\n\nIf I could have one smell on my hands forever, it would be: Rosebud salve, because I already have it on there. I always use it on my fingertips so it\u2019s already always on my hands and I actually can\u2019t live without it, so it will be forever. I always have it on. I\u2019m addicted. But I can say something more romantic \u2026\n\nWhat do you smell like? Sugar, spice, and everything nice.\n\nIf you buy something through our links, New York may earn an affiliate commission.", "description": "Chlo\u00eb Sevigny shares her favorite scents, from her dad\u2019s shaving cream to her new perfume, Chlo\u00eb Sevigny Little Flower for Regime Des Fleurs.", "authors": ["Erica Smith"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/23/23-scent-memories-lede.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
