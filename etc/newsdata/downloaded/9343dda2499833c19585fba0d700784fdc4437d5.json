Yes, it starts there. That putt she made from just outside 6 feet on the 18th green at Gleneagles was the main reason why Pettersen should be the envy of anyone who has competed as long and as well as the feisty Norwegian.\n\nNo one had ever faced a moment like this in the 15 previous editions of the Solheim Cup - the final shot on the final hole, all the other matches concluded, one putt to determine who wins, even if Pettersen didn\u2019t know the score until she was mobbed by her teammates.\n\n\u201cCan you ask for more?\u201d Pettersen said when it was over and Europe had the cup.\n\nAnd then she got a little more.\n\nShe retired.\n\nPettersen didn\u2019t tell anyone beforehand because even she didn\u2019t know. Whether it was an impulsive decision - and it sure sounded like one - is irrelevant. With one putt, she celebrated the decisive point for Europe and a career packed with 21 victories worldwide, two majors and four winning Solheim Cup teams.\n\nIn an ageless sport where no one really retires, Pettersen walked away a winner, her last shot the most important of her career.\n\n\u201cShe went out the way we all would like to,\u201d Judy Rankin said Tuesday.\n\nRankin was in Scotland as the lead analyst for Golf Channel. Her lasting impressions were the quality of the putt, which started outside the hole and broke gently to the right, and the image of Pettersen holding 1-year-old son Herman.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t get more perfect,\u201d Rankin said.\n\nRetirement is never easy in golf, and only a select few manage to pull it off.\n\nJack Nicklaus stumbled into a graceful exit in 2005. After playing his final Masters without fanfare - he finished on a Friday on No. 9 - Nicklaus was at St. Andrews on a corporate trip that spring when he mentioned he would play the British Open for the last time, and that would be his last major. The Royal Bank of Scotland produced a 5-pound note with his image. His final crossing of the Swilcan bridge was stirring. His birdie on the final hole was typical.\n\nLorena Ochoa abruptly retired in April 2010 when she was No. 1 in the world, wanting to start a family. She played twice more at her LPGA event in Mexico at the end of 2010 and the end of 2012.\n\nThey are among the exceptions.\n\nSeve Ballesteros lost his health and his magic, and 12 years after his record 50th victory on the European Tour, he tearfully announced his retirement in 2007 at a somber news conference at Carnoustie.\n\nDottie Pepper was in tears when she announced her retirement at the 2004 U.S. Women\u2019s Open after playing hurt for so long the game felt like a job.\n\n\u201cThe decision is usually made for you,\u201d Pepper said Tuesday.\n\nPettersen decided on her own.\n\n\u201cThis is a perfect closure - the end for my at least Solheim career, and a nice \u2018the end\u2019 for my professional career. It doesn\u2019t get any better,\u201d she said at the winning news conference, prompting the room to break into applause.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m closing it down tomorrow, and what more can I say? I\u2019m done.\u201d\n\nAdding to the moment was that Pettersen never imagined being at Gleneagles with her name stitched on a golf bag.\n\nCatriona Matthew, known as \u201cBeany\u201d because her brother could never pronounce her name as a boy, first picked the 38-year-old Pettersen as a vice captain. And then she approached Pettersen in the summer and suggested she practice in case she was needed to play.\n\nPettersen was a captain\u2019s pick, and a curious one at that. She had to sit out the last Solheim Cup in 2017 with a back injury. She had a baby the following year. She played four tournaments this year, making only one cut.\n\nAnd then she delivered in the biggest way.\n\nThere was an element of redemption, too. In her previous Solheim Cup, Pettersen was made to look like a villain in Germany in 2015 when Alison Lee scooped up her golf ball after missing a birdie attempt, only for Pettersen to point out it was never conceded. Europe won the hole and the match. Pettersen, while within the rules, was seen to be lacking sportsmanship. It drew even more attention when the Americans rallied from a four-point deficit on the final day to win.\n\nPettersen brought a ferocious personality to her golf, especially at the Solheim Cup. In her Solheim debut in 2002, she rallied from 5 down with five holes to play to earn a half-point against Michele Redman, and was so caught up in the moment she dropped an F-bomb on NBC. She could be hard on herself and those around her. She was at times an intimidating presence.\n\nWhen it was over, she never looked so content - with her son in her arms on the 18th green, with her hands on the Solheim Cup trophy, at home Tuesday during an appearance on Golf Channel where she ended the interview by thanking U.S. fans for endless support in \u201cmaking my career what it\u2019s been.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs much as she\u2019s had the ability to get under everyone\u2019s skin, I didn\u2019t see anyone who wasn\u2019t happy for her,\u201d Rankin said. \u201cIt was the same with everybody Sunday night. Every single person I came across was wishing it could happen that way for them.\u201d\n\nNo longer the villain, she left as a hero.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Suzann Pettersen achieved one of the rarest feats in golf.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Doug Ferguson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/15/aptopix_britain_golf_solheim_cup_19555_c0-290-4536-2934_s1770x1032.jpg?8960500e71f25ab127b5db8860659ebef85b4bb7", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
