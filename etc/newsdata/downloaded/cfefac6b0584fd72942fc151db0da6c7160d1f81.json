Donald Trump\u2019s new policy in Syria has created crisis conditions in northern Syria, and this was the president\u2019s opportunity to let congressional leaders know more about conditions on the ground, his policy, and its future.\n\nAt least, that was the idea. In practice, Trump couldn\u2019t behave like an adult long enough to lead the meeting.\n\nDemocratic leaders in Congress on Wednesday angrily walked out of a White House meeting with President Donald Trump after he had a \u201cmeltdown,\u201d according to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. [\u2026] The President started the meeting with a lengthy bombastic monologue, according to a senior Democratic aide\u2026. The meeting quickly devolved into a series of contentious exchanges centering on the president\u2019s decision earlier this month to pull troops from Syria, which paved the way for the Turkish invasion.\n\nThere is no public transcript or recording of the gathering, but by most accounts, Trump admonished former Defense Secretary James Mattis for not being as \u201ctough\u201d as him, complained that he didn\u2019t want to even have the briefing he was supposed to lead, suggested Democrats are vaguely sympathetic to ISIS because the terrorist network includes \u201ccommunists,\u201d and insulted Nancy Pelosi to her face, dismissing her as a \u201cthird-rate\u201d politician.\n\nSince the discussion obviously wasn\u2019t going to be constructive, Democrats saw no need to stick around.\n\nThe House Speaker described Trump\u2019s bizarre behavior as a \u201cvery serious meltdown,\u201d adding that Americans should \u201cpray for his health.\u201d Because the president routinely finds it necessary to respond to every slight in a I\u2019m-rubber-you\u2019re-glue sort of way, Trump published a tweet soon after accusing Pelosi of being mentally ill, adding, \u201cPray for her, she is a very sick person!\u201d Since he heard the Speaker accuse him of a \u201cmeltdown,\u201d Trump also accused Pelosi of having had a \u201cmeltdown.\u201d\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham insisted that the president was \u201cmeasured\u201d and \u201cfactual\u201d during the meeting, which people who\u2019ve never seen, heard, or read about Donald Trump might actually believe.\n\nIt\u2019s the third time this year a White House gathering has been derailed by a presidential breakdown, following a meeting in January during Trump\u2019s lengthy government shutdown and a gathering in May that was supposed to be about infrastructure.\n\nWhat strikes me as amazing, though, is the larger context of Trump\u2019s latest breakdown.\n\nIt\u2019s in the Republican\u2019s interests to behave like a president, at least when around other people. A scandal is poised to lead to his impeachment; his foreign policy is collapsing into catastrophe; and ahead of his re-election campaign, polls show an electorate ready to make a change in American leadership.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, many in the White House have gone out of their way to be nice to Pelosi in recent months because they want her help in passing NAFTA 2.0 (or USMCA, or whatever it is we\u2019re supposed to call it now). Trump, on the other hand, recently delivered speeches in which he said the House Speaker \u201chates the United States\u201d and is \u201cnot a good person\u201d \u2013 all of which led to yesterday, when he started insulting the Democratic leader to her face.\n\nCommon sense suggests Trump should want the public to have some confidence in his ability to function as a mature and capable president. But as the walls close in, he just can\u2019t seem to help himself.", "description": "It's in Trump's interests to demonstrate an ability to function as a mature and capable president right now.
