Positive data on home and auto sales suggest that domestic demand is getting the fillip of lower interest rates, helping to mitigate the risks posed by external weakness and trade uncertainty,\" Mr Marples said. \"At the same time signs of a d\u00e9tente between China and the US suggest that the worst of the trade-related uncertainty shock may finally be in the rear view mirror.\"\n\nSpot gold turned positive from negative; oil futures pared earlier losses in New York.\n\nThe Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the third time this year in a move to ensure the US economy weathers a global trade war without slipping into a recession, but signalled its rate-cut cycle might be at a pause.\n\nIn lowering its policy rate by a quarter of a percentage point to a target range of between 1.50% and 1.75%, the US central bank dropped a previous reference in its policy statement that it \"will act as appropriate\" to sustain the economic expansion - language that was considered a sign for future rate cuts.\n\n\"In short, the 'hawkish ease' anticipated by markets has been delivered, satisfying investors and, presumably, most of the FOMC members uneasy about allowing expectations for more rate cuts to build,\" Pantheon Macroeconomics' Ian Shepherdson said in a note.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn its statement, the Fed said it will \"monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook as it assesses the appropriate path\" of its target interest rate, a less decisive phrase.\n\nKansas City Fed president Esther George and Boston Fed president Eric Rosengren dissented from the decision. They have opposed all three Fed rate cuts this year as unnecessary.\n\nThe Fed's description of the US economy remained largely unchanged, with labour markets said to be \"strong,\" and economic activity \"rising at a moderate rate\".\n\nAs in its previous policy statement, the Fed said it took the action to reduce borrowing costs \"in light of the implications of global developments for the economic outlook as well as muted inflation pressures.\"\n\nLocally, BHP said its Escondida copper mine, the world's largest, was operating at a \"reduced rate\" after union workers walked off the job for part of Tuesday.\n\nThe strike was in solidarity with an anti-government protest movement across Chile, the world's biggest copper producer, that has so far had limited impact on output.\n\nChile's mining production in September fell because of a drop in copper ore levels and iron production, government data showed on Wednesday (Thursday AEDT).\n\nToday's agenda\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLocal: Building approvals September, Trade price indices Q3, Private sector credit September; NZ building permits September, ANZ business confidence October\n\nOverseas data: China manufacturing and services PMIs October; Japan industrial production September; Euro zone unemployment rate September, Q3 GDP, October CPI estimate; UK GfK consumer confidence October; US employment cost index Q3, Personal income and spending September\n\nMarket highlights\n\nASX futures were up 6 points or 0.1% to 6676 near 7.15am AEDT\n\nAUD +0.5% to 69.01 US cents\n\nOn Wall St at 4pm: Dow +0.4% S &P 500 +0.3% Nasdaq +0.3%\n\nIn New York: BHP -0.7% Rio -1.6% Atlassian +4.2%\n\nIn Europe: Stoxx 50 -0.1% FTSE +0.3% CAC +0.5% DAX -0.2%\n\nIn Frankfurt, Deutsche Bank -6.4%\n\nSpot gold -0.4% to $US1482.58 an ounce at 2.40pm New York time\n\nBrent crude -1.4% to $US60.73 a barrel\n\nUS oil -0.8% to $US55.12 a barrel\n\nIron ore +0.6% to $US87.13 a tonne\n\nDalian iron ore +0.7% to 620.5 yuan\n\nLME aluminium -0.3% to $US1760 a tonne\n\nLME copper -0.3% to $US5908 a tonne\n\n2-year yield: US 1.60% Australia 0.79%\n\n5-year yield: US 1.61% Australia 0.82%\n\n10-year yield: US 1.77% Australia 1.13% Germany -0.36%\n\n10-year US/Australia yield gap near 7.15am AEDT: 64 basis points\n\nFrom today's Financial Review\n\nCPI cools further rate cut chances: The possibility of more interest rate cuts this year has evaporated after key figures showed annual inflation grew 1.7 per cent.\n\nLessons for super funds from the man who hunted Madoff: Maths wizard Dan diBartolomeo says Australia\u2019s super funds may be underestimating the risks associated with illiquid assets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'Jihad' on banks risks a crisis: Morgan: Former Westpac boss David Morgan says the effect of regulatory scrutiny and low interest rates could cripple the banking sector.\n\nUnited States\n\nObama will kill the stock market.
