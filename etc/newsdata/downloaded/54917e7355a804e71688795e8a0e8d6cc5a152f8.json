The old stadium roared from the first whistle and while West Ham were wretched, making them the ideal opponents for a side looking to regain confidence, there was much to admire about the way Everton conducted their business.\n\nThere was energy and aggression, invention and determination and \u2014most of all \u2014 fight. Goodison hums when those elements are combined and the simple fact is that Everton would have beaten sides far more competent than West Ham in this kind of mood.\n\nEverton put on a fine performance to comfortably see off West Ham 2-0 in the Premier League\n\nAs good as it was, though, it made you wonder: why has it taken them so long to play this way? How can a group of players be capable of such wildly differing performances? And, the biggest one of all, what happens when they head south to Brighton next Saturday?\n\n'Results don't lie,' said Gylfi Sigurdsson, the substitute who completed the 2-0 win with a picture book goal. 'If you look at our performances, we can't argue. The main aim is to do the same thing next week. We really played on the front foot. We caused West Ham many problems. That is the way we should play. We have players with a lot of energy and that is the kind of performance we want to see.'\n\nThe players are not the only ones. Marco Silva, the embattled coach who has seen his employment prospects debated at every turn, rarely changes his demeanour but privately he must have pondered why Everton decided to turn it on now.\n\nA club that has spent more than \u00a3400million since the summer of 2016 should be tussling with the top six at the very minimum; their fixtures gave them ample opportunity to be in that conversation this season. It was a travesty, then, that Everton started the weekend in the bottom three.\n\nMarco Silva, who headed into the game under intense scrutiny, celebrated at Goodison Park\n\nMidfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson insists Everton don't need any more managerial upheaval\n\nSilva, to his credit, held his nerve. He made some big calls, changed five of the team that submerged so meekly at Burnley before the international break, and was rewarded in a wonderful way, with the performances of Tom Davies, Yerry Mina and Djibril Sidibe catching the eye.\n\nThe Portuguese has deserved better from majority shareholder Farhad Moshiri. If the Iranian billionaire believes Silva is the man to take Everton forward, he would do well to make a public declaration. The last thing Everton need now is more managerial upheaval.\n\n'I don't think (we need that),' said Sigurdsson, who has played for four managers in his three years on Merseyside. 'We had a similar period last season, when we lost a few games. Everything looked awful then, all of a sudden, we started keeping clean sheets and winning games.'\n\nSilva's Everton side take on Brighton away next at the Amex Stadium in the Premier League\n\nIt is not too late for Everton \u2014 far from it. They are only four points behind sixth-placed Crystal Palace and if they show the verve that enabled them to blow West Ham to smithereens, they will take care of many teams \u2014 2-0 should have been 5-0. But would you trust them? At present, the answer is no.\n\n'Always I give my best 100 per cent to Everton Football Club every day,' said Silva. 'My players know that. In my life, everything I have comes from football. Why would I be nervous? I am not.'\n\nHe might not be anxious but critics will still be sceptical. Are Everton a team that folds like a house of cards or are they potentially capable of joining the race for the top six? It is time for the questions to stop. Compelling answers are required.", "description": "How appropriate: Everton have been queried at every clumsy turn this season so it was wholly fitting, after their best performance to date, that more questions were forthcoming.", "authors": ["Dominic King For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/19/19962558-0-image-a-5_1571594487644.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
