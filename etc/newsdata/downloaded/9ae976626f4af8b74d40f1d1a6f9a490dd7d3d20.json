I didn't expect to be in this position so I'm very happy. This is one of the biggest wins that I've had after everything so I'm very proud.\"\n\nIt was their grueling French Open semifinal two years ago that exacerbated physical issues for both players. Murray spent the next 18 months trying to find a solution to his hip problems that would enable him to live without pain, while Wawrinka underwent two knee operations.\n\nResilient\n\nAfter undergoing hip resurfacing surgery, Murray returned to the court in June playing doubles \u2014 including at Wimbledon \u2014 before moving back to singles in August.\n\nThe 34-year-old Wawrinka was looking for his first ATP title since the 2017 Geneva Open.\n\nThe crucial break of serve in the first set came in the second game, with Murray saving two break points but not a third, and his Swiss opponent served it out 6-3.\n\nMurray looked in deep trouble when Wawrinka broke again in the third game of the second set, and the Scot had to save more break points to avoid losing a fourth game in a row.\n\nBut, having dug in, he got his reward as Wawrinka's serve went off the boil and his level dipped, with Murray breaking back to 3-3.\n\nAwaiting birth of third child\n\nWawrinka had two more chances at 4-4 but again Murray fought off the danger and it was Murray who then took his first set point to clinch it 6-4 and level the match.\n\nWawrinka stepped up again early in the third set and was twice a break ahead but once more Murray dug in, hitting back immediately both times.\n\nMurray saved two more break points at 4-4 to leave Wawrinka serving to stay in the match. When Wawrinka blazed a forehand well off target on the first match point, it was the former top-ranked Murray celebrating a remarkable comeback.\n\nMurray is now expected to take a break until the Davis Cup finals next month while he waits for the birth of his third child.\n\n\"I'll have three kids under four years old. I need to get on the road so we don't get out of control,\" Murray joked. \"I'm excited for the third kid. My wife's been a huge support for getting me back on the court and making me fight to keep playing.\"", "description": "Andy Murray claimed his first ATP tour title in more than 2 1/2 years at the European Open on Sunday, beating three-time Grand Slam champion Stan Wawrinka in just his sixth singles tournament since returning from hip surgery in January.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5328355.1571603561!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/murray-andy-191020-1180.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
