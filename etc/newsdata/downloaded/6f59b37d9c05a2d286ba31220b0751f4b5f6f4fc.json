Andr\u00e9 Meyer European SME Envoys Network\n\nThree days of conferences and workshops organised by the European Commission to bring together entrepreneurs, economists and policy makers.\n\nGiving SME s a say in policy-making\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s interesting for SMEs is to have a chance to directly influence politicians and others players in the way policies are implemented. Everybody has a say, everyone can contribute,\u201d the European Commission\u2019s Andr\u00e9 Meyer told Euronews.\n\nOne of the major topics was how to improve SMEs\u2019 access to public procurement. Outside of the financial sector, 99,8% of all European companies are small and medium sized enterprises, but they only get 45% of public contracts, a share Brussels would like to boost to 58%.\n\n\u201cThis is a huge market, this is more than 2 trillion euros annually that are being bid into public procurements,\u201d said Commissioner El\u017cbieta Bie\u0144kowska, in charge of Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs. \u201cSo it is important for us really to see SMEs there, in this market.\u201d\n\nBoosting access to public contracts for SME s\n\nIn order to achieve this, the European Commission launched an initiative last October to make public procurement procedures more efficient, professional and transparent.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing for us in Europe must be efficiency. Efficiency in the way we spend money, not the lowest price criteria. The European directive allows us criteria that are connected with innovation, with the environment, with energy efficiency, with the social aspects of the project. And that\u2019s where SMEs are always better because they are closer to real life,\u201d added El\u017cbieta Bie\u0144kowska.\n\nThe aim is to strengthen the single market, including in the sensitive Defence sector, while boosting investment.\n\nRewarding entreprise promotion\n\nThe annual gathering is also the opportunity to reward initiatives that successfully promote entrepreneurship in Europe. This year, the European Enterprise Promotion Awards (EEPA) Grand Jury Prize went to a Dutch project, Innofest. Director Anna van Nunen was delighted.\n\n\u201c90% of all innovations fail and it\u2019s often the case because it\u2019s not tested before it\u2019s brought to the market. That\u2019s where Innofest comes in,\u201d she told Euronews. \u201cWe work with eight well-known Dutch festivals, and we offer those festivals to entrepreneurs as a living lab for innovation testing. It\u2019s been difficult to set us up because it\u2019s entirely new. So to earn such a prize after two years of struggling and setting this up, it\u2019s just such a big support.\u201d\n\nA total of 18 projects were rewarded, including a programme to help businesses develop internationally launched by a collective from Austria \u2013 the host country of next year\u2019s SME Assembly.", "description": "Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, was also the capital of European small and medium-sized enterprises for the SME Assembly.", "authors": ["Andr\u00e9 Meyer"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/408721/1000x563_408721.jpg", "published_at": "2017-11-28"}
