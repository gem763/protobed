Imagine having a family to take care of! Is not easy being constantly with or without job. Is true it affects your mental health as an actor!!\n\n\"But hey! There was no other alternative right away, didn't know what the future will bring and I couldn't just wait without doing anything.\n\n\"There's no shame in working. I would rather feel ashamed being lazy and complain I don't have money or ask my family to provide for me.\"\n\nRuxandra went on to express solidarity with artists who are working other jobs to get by, writing: \"Well done to all of you hard working artists out there. You should be proud of yourselves.\n\n\"Thank you for inspiring me!\"\n\nOn the show, her character Alina is thought to be a modern day slave. She's also grown close to love interest Seb Franklin.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nKatie has since praised Britain's working class and said that she's always worked other jobs between acting gigs.\n\nShe told Victoria Derbyshire: \"All actors go through it over the years, I've had so many jobs in between and not just being a security guard.\"\n\nShe discussed the struggles at the start of her career, when she landed a role in the film Fish Tank.\n\n\"At 17, when I got Fish Tank,\" Katie said, \"I was doing doughnuts with my uncle at the time at festivals and things like that so I'd go on there and do the food carts.\"\n\nLater she added: \"I've been a waitress, I've worked at a credit card company, I've done admin, I've done all types of things.\"", "description": "The star said she has a side job in a cafe 'while also going up to Manchester and film' after it emerged EastEnders' Katie Jarvis works as a security guard", "authors": ["Will Twigger", "Image", "Bbc"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article18668133.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/33_07_coro_alina_seb_02.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
