Canada's Boundary Dam and the Petra Nova project in the US state of Texas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCapture and use\n\nThe International Energy Agency estimated in 2015 that 0.63 of a tonne of carbon abatement was achieved for every tonne of carbon dioxide injected for oil field enhancement, even if the oil was ultimately burned, but Baroness Brown said she had reservations about using CCS to produce another fossil fuel.\n\n''The UK government has now put a ''U'' into carbon capture, making it carbon capture use and storage, and I feel that is slightly optimistic, because in terms of the scale of CO2 that we are going to need to capture we are not going to find very many ways to use that,'' she said.\n\n''There will be some uses, putting some into greenhouses and using some in chemical reactions, but actually most of it is going to need to be stored so I think the letter 'U' in CCUS is slightly decorative.\n\n''I certainly feel that if the 'U' is enhanced oil and gas recovery that is slightly against the whole purpose of doing this carbon capture and storage in the first place.''\n\nAustralian oil and gas producer Santos is investigating whether it can improve production in its flagship Cooper Basin business by injecting carbon dioxide underground.\n\nWhile coal miners and petroleum producers continue to pump money into research and development of CCS, some environment groups are increasingly accepting that the technology may have a limited role to play.\n\nWhile it does not support government funds being devoted to CCS for coal-fired power generators, the Australian Conservation Foundation said it was open to CCS playing a bigger role for industries like cement and steel.\n\n\"For industries that do not have a choice, yes I think we should continue research and where possible trialling forms of sequestration,\" said the Foundation's climate and energy policy adviser Suzanne Harter.", "description": "A top UK government climate adviser says carbon capture storage must play a role in fighting global warming, but raised doubts about using it for oil recovery", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3754%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_811%2C$y_351/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/781c4ebd8cd12a9984d2e8745d9f5904313355b8", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
