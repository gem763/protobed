After the regionals, the Grandmasters play for a $500,000 prize pool. After winning a match in the Asia-Pacific regional, Chung streamed a post-victory interview while wearing ski goggles and a gas mask, a look often worn by protestors in Hong Kong to mitigate the effects of tear gas.\n\n\u201cLiberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time,\u201d Chung said on the stream, a phrase that\u2019s become a rallying cry for protestors in Hong Kong.\n\nThe match is still available online, but the controversial moment of political protest has been scrubbed from Twitch and YouTube. In a statement published on October 8, Activision Blizzard announced it was suspending Chung for violating official competition rules.\n\n\u201cEngaging in any act that, in Blizzard\u2019s sole discretion, brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image will result in removal from Grandmasters and reduction of the player\u2019s prize total to $0 USD, in addition to other remedies which may be provided for under the Handbook and Blizzard\u2019s Website Terms,\u201d Activision Blizzard said, citing its rules.\n\n\u201cWhile we stand by one\u2019s right to express individual thoughts and opinions, players and other participants that elect to participate in our esports competitions must abide by the official competition rules,\u201d Activision Blizzard said. Comments are disabled on the post.\n\nThe protests in Hong Kong began in June when its leadership proposed a law that would allow the extradition of criminals to mainland China. The government rescinded the proposed bill in September, but protests continue. The people in the streets are now demanding greater democracy in Hong Kong and an investigation into the violent actions of the police during the protests.\n\n\"As you know there are serious protests in my country now. My call on stream was just another form of participation of the protest that I wish to grab more attention,\u201d Chung told esports website Inven Global. \u201cI put so much effort in that social movement in the past few months, that I sometimes couldn't focus on preparing my Grandmaster match. I know what my action on stream means. It could cause me [a] lot of trouble, even my personal safety in real life. But I think it's my duty to say something about the issue.\"\n\nChung isn\u2019t the only high profile media personality to clash with China this month. Beijing banned South Park after the cartoon aired an episode critical of its censorship of art.\n\n\u201cFight for Freedom. Standing with Hong Kong,\u201d Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets NBA team, tweeted last weekend. On Monday morning, Morey had deleted the tweet and posted an apology. Tencent, a media company with the exclusive rights to stream the NBA in China and a 4.9 percent stake in Activision Blizzard, immediately suspended NBA broadcasts after Morey\u2019s initial tweet.\n\nActivision Blizzard did not immediately respond to our request for comment, and Chung declined to comment.", "description": "Chung \u201cBlitzchung\u201d Ng Wai was suspended from playing in pro tournaments and had his recent winnings rescinded after expressing support for pro-democracy protestors in Hong Kong.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d9cb78a0c335200091df0ce/lede/1570551858317-Screen-Shot-2019-10-08-at-122348-PM.png?crop=0.839xw:0.9989xh;0.086xw,0.0011xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
