But it was one particular scene which tested the erections of athletes that took things to a whole other level.\n\nDr Aaron Spitz, lead delegate of the American Urological Association conducted the study, as he said: \u2018When I think of a manly man, I think of someone who has strength, endurance, sexual prowess and fertility.\n\n\u2018In fact, what the scientific studies are showing, is that the more meat men eat, the more quickly they lose their\u2026manly manhood.\u2019\n\nThe doc explained the study (Picture: Netflix)\n\nThree collegiate athletes were measured during the night, donning a pair of rings that went on the base of the penis and the other went on the tip, tracking the strength, longevity and number of erections over two nights.\n\nFed a burrito either made up of beef, chicken or pork on the first night, the men were measured, before then eating a plant-based burrito with vegan versions of the meat for the second night.\n\nThe results\u2026well\u2026the results had them giggling.\n\nMason read his results first, with a graph showing the bigger the circumference of the circle score, the harder his erection. When comparing the two nights, he had nearly a 9% increase in the strength of his member after eating plant-based.\n\nVegan athletes showed off their strength (Picture: Netflix)\n\nThen, when it came to how many minutes a night he was having erections, we\u2019re talking a 303% increase.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was nothing on Blake, the second athlete, who saw a 477% difference in how many minutes he had an erection on a plant based diet.\n\nThe other Blake (yes, two Blakes) had a 13% change in the hardness off his erection. When it came to how many minutes, he had a 312% increase.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s, like, an hour!\u2019 second Blake giggled, as the rest of the panel descended into laughs about their improved erections after ditching meat for just a night.\n\nThey couldn\u2019t contain their giggles (Picture: the game changers)\n\nViewers had a laugh along with them, as one took to Twitter to speak about that scene in particular.\n\n\u2018The scene in #TheGameChangers, showing how those athletes had bigger/longer lasting erections from just one plant based meal killed me\u2026\u2019 they wrote.\n\n\u2018If only people with penises would realise how good a plant based diet is for you\u2026\u2019\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger also weighed in on switching to a vegetarian diet, explaining in his early days of bodybuilding he was a big meat eater.\n\n\u2018I ate a lot of meat, I ate my 10-15 eggs a day and you know had my 250g of protein a day because I weighed 250 pounds,\u2019 the Terminator star explained.\n\n\u2018But as I got older and read up on it I recognised the fact you really don\u2019t have to get your protein from meat or animals. So we started going more in the direction of a vegetarian diet.\u2019\n\nSpeaking about using the right spices in his veggie diet, Arnie added: \u2018Now I love it much more than the meat.\n\nThis guy is 60 (Picture: Netflix)\n\n\u2018The cholesterol went down\u2026it was the lowest it\u2019s been in my entire life, at almost 69.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe continued about the marketing of meat: \u2018There is no one that can relate to it better than I do, I\u2019ve been involved in that world, \u201cSteak is for man\u201d. They show these commercial, burgers, George Foreman with the grill\u2026\n\n\u2018This is great, great marketing for the meat industry. Selling that idea that real man eat meat. But you got to understand that\u2019s marketing, that\u2019s not based on reality.\u2019\n\nHe noted it\u2019s not easy to give up meat gold turkey (pun intended), and he wasn\u2019t imploring everyone to go vegan now or else\u2026like a lot of vegans do.\n\n\u2018If you go to people and say, \u201cyou must stop eating meat\u201d, they\u2019ll say \u201cf*ck you, who the f*ck are you to tell me how to eat\u201d.\n\n\u2018But if you explain it, say, \u201cHey, why don\u2019t you try once a week, chill with the meat.\u201d\u2019\n\nThe Game Changers is on Netflix now.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
