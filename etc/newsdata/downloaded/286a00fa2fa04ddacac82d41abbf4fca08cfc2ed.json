Before it was converted, the house was a granary that served the nearby Castle Inn.\n\nAnd if owners tire of the sleepiness of Hobbiton, the A479 offers easy access attractions including the Dinas Castle Tump in the Brecon Beacons National Park. Mountain walks as well as the market town charm of Talgarth are within easy reach, with Hay-on-Wye and Crickhowell also just a 20-minute drive away.\n\nThis real-world Hobbit Hole is now on the market as the owners of Castle Cottage plan to sell the property and their bespoke creation for \u00a3385,000. Looking like something straight out of Bag End, the small building was rented out as an Airbnb and offers the perfect break for anybody who's ever wondered what it would be like to live in Tolkien's Shire\n\nPictured: The interior of the Hobbit Hole, complete with a small stove. Outside the house is a seating area set within a refreshing rural landscape. Urban amenities are also close by, with Hay-on-Wye and Crickhowell a 20-minute drive away. The space is currently let as an Airbnb, but the owners are selling it, along with Castle Cottage, for \u00a3385,000\n\nPictured: The Hobbit Hole in Powys, complete with outdoor seating and a modest living space. The getaway sits behind the main property, which is a converted granary called Castle Cottage, named after the nearby public house which it used to serve before it was redeveloped to include all the necessities of modern living\n\nCastle Cottage (pictured) is now on sale for \u00a3385,000 and is just a short distance from mountain walks as well as the charming market town of Talgarth. The property boasts three double bedrooms, but there is also a study which could be converted into a fourth sleeping area if the new owners were minded to do so\n\nThis wood-fired hot tub sits next to the Hobbit Hole in Pengenffordd, Powys, offering the perfect place to unwind if a trip to the nearby Castle Inn is out of the question. The getaway sits within 2.75 acres of land, with the Lord of the Rings-style structure nestled underneath grass just like the home of Bilbo Baggins\n\nThe Hobbit Hole is built into the rural landscape, just as Peter Jackson portrayed when he brought Bag End to life with his big-budget depictions of Middle-earth in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The structure is surrounded by trees and bushes, providing the perfect shelter from the trappings of urban life and the current owners marketed the miniature structure as an Airbnb", "description": "Castle Cottage in Pengenffordd, Powys, sits within 2.75 acres of land and boasts its very own Hobbit hideout that emulates the Middle-earth home of Bilbo Baggins.", "authors": ["Sebastian Murphy-Bates For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/10/20028974-0-image-a-30_1571737555021.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
