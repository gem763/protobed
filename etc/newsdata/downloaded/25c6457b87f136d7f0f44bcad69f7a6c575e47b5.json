Joens, who didn\u2019t have an offensive board in the first game, had a WNBA Finals record nine. She also only took eight shots in the series opener, which Connecticut lost 95-86.\n\nIn Game 2, Emma Meeseman scored 22 points off the bench for Washington after spelling Delle Donne early in the first quarter and Tianna Hawkins added 16. Washington\u2019s bench outscored Connecticut\u2019s 52-9.\n\nKristi Toliver was the Mystics\u2019 only starter in double figures with 13 points. Delle Donne finished scoreless after taking just two early shots.\n\nEven so, after Connecticut put together an early run following Delle Donne\u2019s departure and led by as many as 14 points in the second quarter, the Mystics fought back from a 10-point halftime deficit to tie it briefly.\n\nAerial Powers converted a three-point play before adding a slashing layup on Toliver\u2019s feed to cut it to 71-69 late in the third following a 7-0 spurt. Toliver\u2019s runner evened it at 76-all with 8:14 left in the game.\n\nThe Sun responded with a 6-0 spurt to take the lead for good. Jones hit a putback before Williams added a pair of inside buckets, the latter after two offensive rebounds to make it 82-76.\n\nA REACH FOR THE SUN\n\nConnecticut has now won four games this postseason, one shy of the team record of five.\n\nTIP INS\n\nSun: Jones passed her Game 1 scoring total of 12 points when she hit a layup 4:25 left in the first half to reach 14. She had 18 points and 10 rebounds by halftime. \u2026 G Layshia Clarendon (right ankle) did not play after coach Curt Miller said Monday she was questionable for the game. Clarendon hasn\u2019t played in a live game since June 16.\n\nMystics: Delle Donne also missed the teams\u2019 first regular season meeting in 2019, an 84-69 Sun victory on May 25. \u2026 C LaToya Sanders picked up a technical for a defensive 3-second violation with 39 seconds left in the first half, and Hawkins committed the same offense midway through the third quarter.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe series shifts to Connecticut\u2019s Mohegan Sun Arena for Game 3 on Sunday afternoon.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Jonquel Jones scored 32 points and grabbed 18 rebounds, and the Connecticut Sun took advantage of Elena Delle Donne's early injury exit to beat the Washington Mystics 99-87 in Game 2 of the WNBA Finals on Tuesday night and even the series.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ian Quillen"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/01/sun_mystics_basketball_74433_c0-155-3712-2319_s1770x1032.jpg?c1ed8d37efd9b182faf914cb9d97ec981b81ee32", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
