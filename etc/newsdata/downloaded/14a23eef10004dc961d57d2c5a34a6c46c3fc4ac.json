This peripheral rarely drops below $90, but you can pick one up for $59.99 $66.91 right now in the graphite color. We saw this mouse slip down to $39.99 during Amazon Prime Day in July, but this is the best price we\u2019ve seen since.\n\nThis mouse has a lot in common with Logitech\u2019s newer MX Master 3, though not its USB-C charge port or $99 price. The MX Master 2S has the same estimated 70-day battery life; a 4,000 DPI sensor; it can quickly switch between up to three computers paired via Bluetooth; and it includes a USB Type-A dongle. This mouse also supports Logitech\u2019s Flow software, which allows interoperability with two machines at once so you can drag a file from one onto the other without repairing to a different computer.\n\nThere are a couple of other Logitech products included in Amazon\u2019s deal of the day, including gaming headsets, mechanical keyboards, and speaker sets. So check it out if you have a few more things on your wishlist.\n\nBest Buy is hosting a nice sale on Beats Solo 3 on-ear wireless headphones. They\u2019re $129.99 $149.99, which is around the lowest that we\u2019ve seen these sell for. Outside of the sale price, this model usually costs at least $180, and unlike most other sales on this model, Best Buy has several color options available.\n\nThese are fairly standard Bluetooth headphones, but for those entrenched in Apple\u2019s hardware, the Solo 3 feature the W1 wireless chip. As a result, these headphones can quickly pair with and switch between your iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad, and macOS computer.", "description": "Today\u2019s best deals include $40 off of the excellent Logitech MX Master 2S mouse, which is rarely discounted. Also, the Beats Solo 3 on-ear wireless headphones match the lowest price we\u2019ve seen at Best Buy.", "authors": ["Cameron Faulkner", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fnk2XSCgku-C_LoUqfLwqPWbaL4=/0x81:1600x919/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8602091/master_2s.png", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
