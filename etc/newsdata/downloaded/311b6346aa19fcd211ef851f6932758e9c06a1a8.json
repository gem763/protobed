Tech sector leads Nikkei to 10-month high, profit-taking hits Topix\n\n* Nikkei up 0.18% but broader Topix shed 0.13%\n\n* NT ratio at highest since 1992\n\n* Semiconductor-related shares jump after TSMC earnings\n\nBy Hideyuki Sano\n\nTOKYO, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Japan's Nikkei hit a 10-month high\n\non Friday after high-tech companies jumped on upbeat earnings\n\nfrom Taiwan's TSMC while the broader market ended lower,\n\nsuccumbing to profit-taking after weaker-than-expected Chinese\n\nGDP data.\n\nThe Nikkei share average rose 0.18% to 22,492.68,\n\nits highest finish since early December last year, pulling back\n\nfrom rising as much as 0.88% earlier. For the week, the Nikkei\n\nwas up 3.18%.\n\nThe broader Topix , a gauge of all firms on the main\n\nboard of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, ended 0.13% lower at\n\n1,621.99.\n\nTheir divergent performances lifted the so-called NT ratio\n\n.NTIDX , of the two indexes, to the highest since 1992.\n\nThe Nikkei was buoyed by a rise in heavyweight Fast\n\nRetailing as well as a few heavily-weighted tech\n\nshares, including Fanuc , Shin-etsu Chemical\n\nand Omron .\n\nThe tech sector led gains after Taiwan Semiconductor\n\nManufacturing Co (TSMC) - the world's top contract\n\nchipmaker - raised on Thursday its 2019 capital spending plan by\n\nup to $5 billion and forecast a nearly 10% rise in\n\nfourth-quarter revenue on strong demand for faster mobile chips\n\nand new high-end smartphones.\n\nScreen Holdings , a major chip industry supplier,\n\ngained 7.9% with trade volume reaching almost three times the\n\naverage while Sumco rose 4.3%.\n\nTri Chemical Laboratories , maker of high-purity\n\nchemicals for semiconductor manufacturing, jumped 6.8%.\n\nAmong bigger firms, Murata Manufacturing gained\n\n1.2%, and Keyence rose 1.0%.\n\nWhile the market got an early boost from relief over Britain\n\nand the European Union striking a deal on the UK's departure\n\nfrom the bloc, soft Chinese GDP triggered profit-taking.\n\nChina's third-quarter economic growth slowed more than\n\nexpected to 6.0%, its weakest pace in almost three decades.\n\nStill, overall sentiment remained positive as U.S. corporate\n\nearnings have so far mostly beat market expectations. .N\n\nThat also raised some hopes that Japanese companies'\n\nearnings outlook could bottom out soon. The Topix's forward\n\nearnings per share (EPS) has declined 9% to 122.86 since peaking\n\nin November.\n\nAt home, investor sentiment also benefited from a trade deal\n\nreached between Japan and the United States which the Japanese\n\ngovernment said would likely boost the domestic economy by about\n\n0.8%. Despite the small losses in Topix, advancers slightly\n\noutnumbered decliners by a ratio of roughly 21 to 20.\n\nDefensive shares, such as food companies, were among the\n\nworst performers as investors moved out of them to more cyclical\n\nshares.\n\nNH Foods dropped 2.4%, cosmetic firm Shiseido\n\ndeclined 3.1% and Keisei Electric Railway fell\n\n2.1%.\n\n(Editing by Jacqueline Wong)", "description": "Tech sector leads Nikkei to 10-month high, profit-taking hits Topix", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEB1Q06W_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
