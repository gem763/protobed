In T20 cricket, that is almost worse than getting out.\n\n\"I was swinging at every one of them but I was missing every one by a foot,\" he recalled. \"I don\u2019t normally get nervous but for that innings I really was. I was batting with Sourav Ganguly and Ricky Ponting was at three. There were 45,000 people in an atmosphere I\u2019ve never experienced anything like before.\"\n\nMcCullum, renowned for his ebullient approach, had been in terrible form in the nets in the lead-up to the first IPL. Sharing a dressing room with legends like Ganguly and Ponting after being sold for a life-changing \u00a3355,000 at the player auction, McCullum had to justify both his presence and his price tag at cricket\u2019s transformative new tournament. He would be playing for the Kolkata Knight Riders, one of the most glamorous teams, owned by the Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan.\n\nThere was more to the maiden IPL match, between Royal Challengers Bangalore and McCullum\u2019s KKR in the M.Chinnaswamy Stadium, than the result. Despite the millions of dollars invested and India\u2019s one billion cricket fans, until that night the IPL was just a concept.\n\nMcCullum played and missed at the first ball of the second over, too: he was now on nought off six balls. \"It was swing out or get out,\" said McCullum, who recognised that he would be more use to his team sitting back in the dug-out than staying out in the middle using up valuable balls. This enlightened approach was about to define the most critical innings of his life.\n\n\"If it\u2019s not meant to be then it\u2019s not meant to be,\" McCullum recalled thinking. \"Just keep swinging.\" That the next ball was full and in McCullum\u2019s arc was essentially irrelevant; he was attacking anyway and slogged across the line of the ball to get it over the fielder\u2019s head and score four. The crowd roared; McCullum \u2013 and the IPL \u2013 had their first boundary.\n\n\"I just kept swinging and something clicked. I don\u2019t know what it was but suddenly I calmed down a lot and then I was able to do what I did which pretty much changed my life.\"", "description": "In the first extract from their new book 'Cricket 2.", "authors": ["Tim Wigmore", "Freddie Wilde", "Michael Vaughan", "Simon Heffer"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/cricket/2019/10/08/TELEMMGLPICT000003700199-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq7iDqcdzJFDh5cmEdFCBe7mEeqNiMtKZEuz-7kFbgDc8.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
