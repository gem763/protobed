Many chanted: \u201cLiberty, Equality, Paternity\u201d, a play on the national French motto. Some shouted: \u201cEveryone needs a father.\u201d\n\nOne demonstrator in his 40s said: \u201cWe\u2019ll fight to stop children being conceived without a father, you don\u2019t make children in laboratories.\u201d\n\nMany of the protesters had also been active in the large protest movement against same-sex marriage seven years ago. In 2013, the legalisation of same-sex marriage in France was unique among its European neighbours in sparking months of large street demonstrations, which saw violent clashes between far-right groups and riot police and led to a rise in homophobic attacks.\n\nThe protesters on Sunday included pensioners and couples with young children. A handful of politicians from Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally party were present, as well as a few from the mainstream right\u2019s Les R\u00e9publicains, which is divided on the issue.\n\nThe turnout was lower than for the 2013 rallies but organisers said they were encouraged by the size of the march and planned further demonstrations.\n\n\u201cThis protest is a warning to the government,\u201d said Ludovine de la Roch\u00e8re, the head of La Manif Pour Tous group.\n\nLast month, the lower house of the French parliament approved the draft bioethics law which would allow lesbian and single women to conceive children with medical help. The bill must now be approved by the upper house, or senate, before it can be passed.\n\nCurrently in French law, only heterosexual couples who have been married or living together for more than two years have the right to access procedures such as in vitro fertilisation, artificial insemination or sperm donation. The centrist government wants to extend this right to all women by passing the new law before the summer.\n\nAn opinion poll for Ifop last month found more than 65% of French people support extending the right to IVF and assisted procreation to single women and lesbians.", "description": "Thousands march in Paris to oppose new law aimed at extending reproductive rights", "authors": ["Angelique Chrisafis"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3328a8b3673e6761b9c99519a0308ad29dd1bbc7/0_91_2723_1634/master/2723.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d80002cd04e161c43a16d540d5b5d30c", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
