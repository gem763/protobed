And life is wonderfully normal again. Yes, if only.\"\n\nHer family have asked for privacy, but said \"many aspects of Leah's journey can be found on her blog.\"\n\n'Hugely popular'\n\nITV drama boss John Whiston paid tribute to a \"much-loved\" former colleague, noting how her gay on-screen character blazed a trail.\n\n\"Everyone on Emmerdale is very sad to hear of the death of Leah Bracknell,\" he said in a statement.\n\n\"Leah was a hugely popular member of the Emmerdale cast for over 16 years.

It's living. I'm alive until the point I am not. And that to me is the key, not to surrender to something else.\"\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.
