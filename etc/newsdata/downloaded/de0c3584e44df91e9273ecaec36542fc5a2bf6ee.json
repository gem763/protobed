Almost every professional and social field has had its own \"#MeToo moment\" in the years since.\n\nThe consensus media shorthand has been to describe this rather lazily as a \"movement\" - but in McGowan's appearance on Sadia Azmat and Monty Onanuga's latest episode of No Country For Young Women, she's at pains not just to reject this label, but to explain why it's hindered what #MeToo was originally designed to do.\n\nThe hashtag, McGowan says, was simply \"shorthand for survivors and victims to talk to each other\". Her emphasis is on the women and men who had experienced sexual assault and the solidarity #MeToo was meant to offer to them, rather than \"a press-created thing to freak men out\".\n\nMore than that, though, McGowan sees #MeToo as a \"conversation\" that society needed to have. \"I wanted to force a cultural reset,\" she tells Sadia and Monty.\n\n\"Can we wake up? Can we stop hurting each other - especially women? My goal is simply to see if people can be smarter, look at each other differently - if men can see women as human, and women can see themselves as human, before they see themselves as a gender.\"", "description": "Sadia and Monty kick of Season 3 of the No Country For Young Women podcast", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p07p64yw.jpg"}
