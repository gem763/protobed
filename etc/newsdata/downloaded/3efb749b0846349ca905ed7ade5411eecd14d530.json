(Photo: CARL DE SOUZA/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nAn unprecedented number of fires are ravaging the Amazon rainforest over the last few weeks, most of which were lit by local farmers to clear areas for cattle.\n\nBrazil\u2019s National Institute for Space Research (INPE) reported that the nation has experienced more than 75,000 fires so far in 2019, with more than half of those raging in Brazil\u2019s Amazon region.\n\nExperts warn that the massive fires have the ability to severely inhibit the planet\u2019s overall health given that the Amazon spans eight countries \u2014 or about 40% of South America \u2014 and produces more than 20% of the planet\u2019s oxygen.\n\nAnd people are increasingly asking what can be done about it.\n\n\u201cThis is a red alert and we should use this time to educate the world on such an important cause,\u201d Adriane Muelbert, a Brazilian-born ecologist with UK\u2019s University of Birmingham who\u2019s studied how Amazon deforestation plays a role in climate change for the last seven years, told Yahoo Finance.\n\nFires are raging across the Amazon rainforest. (Source: AFP) More\n\n\u2018The Amazon is a very important place\u2019\n\nMuelbert added that the Amazon \u201cis a very important place for the planet and it\u2019s one of our most valuable weapons to fight climate change at the moment.\u201d Deforestation has contributed to a 17% decline in the rainforest\u2019s total area over the last 50 years, according to World Wildlife Fund.\n\nThe full extent of the damage caused by these fires cannot be calculated until after the fires are extinguished. And Muelbert noted that this is only the beginning of fire season and the situation has the potential to get much worse.\n\n\u201cThis is not a dry year and in dry years we expect fires, but rainfall has been above average this year\u201d Muelbert said, noting that she considers the fires an environmental anomaly.\n\nIn S\u00e3o Paulo, more than 1,000 miles away from the infernos, people are sharing dramatic images of thick smoke clouds and black rainwater linked to the fires.\n\n\ud83c\udf0eJust a little alert to the world: the sky randomly turned dark today in S\u00e3o Paulo, and meteorologists believe it\u2019s smoke from the fires burning *thousands* of kilometers away, in Rond\u00f4nia or Paraguay. Imagine how much has to be burning to create that much smoke(!).

Cattle ranching is responsible for 80% of the ongoing deforestation and contributes to the crisis in the Amazon rainforest. Trees are cut and the land is converted into cattle ranches that supply the world\u2019s mounting demand for beef. Eating less meat is one way to not contribute to the deforestation horrors.", "description": "An unprecedented number of fires are ravaging the Amazon rainforest over the last few weeks, most of which were lit by local farmers to clear areas for cattle.", "authors": ["Stephanie Asymkos"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/4_yz5KrhRoaxDvnDB6UPXg--~B/aD0xMTMwO3c9MTY5ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-08/75c50220-c74f-11e9-bc55-8cb85289460b", "published_at": "2019-08-25"}
