But his stonewall couldn\u2019t block everything. One particular answer he gave was very curious.\n\nThe event most at issue in Lewandowski\u2019s testimony was Trump\u2019s request that he deliver a message to then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions about how then-special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation was \u201cvery unfair\u201d to Trump. Democrats have said that could constitute obstruction of justice or signal an obstructive intent by the president. But as Mueller\u2019s report details, Lewandowski didn\u2019t actually deliver that message.\n\nSo Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) probed Lewandowski as to why. Lewandowski had said earlier in the hearing that he didn\u2019t see anything wrong with Trump\u2019s request. If that was true, why didn\u2019t he pass along the message? Johnson tried to goad Lewandowski, suggesting that he had \u201cchickened out\u201d on delivering the message because he got \u201csqueamish.\u201d\n\nLewandowski disputed that characterization. His explanation? \u201cI went on vacation.\u201d\n\nThat prompted some laughter in the hearing room. Lewandowski added that his kids were his priority.\n\nHe later said he wanted to give Sessions the message in a \u201crelaxed,\u201d face-to-face meeting, but that meeting never materialized after Sessions canceled.\n\nLet\u2019s take that at face value for a moment. Lewandowski gets a request from the president of the United States \u2014 a man whose campaign he ran for months and whose success put Lewandowski on the national map. The request is to deliver a high-profile message to the attorney general of the United States about an issue of huge importance in American politics, the special counsel\u2019s investigation.\n\nLewandowski suggests that this was something that simply got lost in the shuffle, and that he never followed up because he went on vacation and was not able to get the right kind of in-person audience with Sessions. He said he wanted to do it over dinner.\n\n\u201cI wanted to get an opportunity to speak with Jeff in a more relaxed atmosphere,\u201d Lewandowski said.\n\nBut that\u2019s really difficult to square with what\u2019s in the Mueller report. This isn\u2019t something Trump asked about just once; he asked about it on June 19, 2017, and on July 19, 2017. He also raised a concern, in that second meeting, about why the message hadn\u2019t been delivered. And Mueller expressly says Lewandowski opted not to deliver it because he was worried about it \u2014 not because he didn\u2019t get the right audience \u2014 and that he tried to pass the duty off to a Trump aide, Rick Dearborn.\n\nHere\u2019s what the Mueller report says in its sections on potential obstruction of justice by Trump (key parts bolded):\n\nOn June 19, 2017, the President met one-on-one in the Oval Office with his former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, a trusted advisor outside the government, and dictated a message for Lewandowski to deliver to Sessions. The message said that Sessions should publicly announce that, notwithstanding his recusal from the Russia investigation, the investigation was \u201cvery unfair\u201d to the President, the President had done nothing wrong, and Sessions planned to meet with the Special Counsel and \u201clet [him] move forward with investigating election meddling for future elections.\u201d Lewandowski said he understood what the President wanted Sessions to do. One month later, in another private meeting with Lewandowski on July 19, 2017, the President asked about the status of his message for Sessions to limit the Special Counsel investigation to future election interference. Lewandowski told the President that the message would be delivered soon. Hours after that meeting, the President publicly criticized Sessions in an interview with the New York Times, and then issued a series of tweets making it clear that Sessions\u2019s job was in jeopardy. Lewandowski did not want to deliver the President\u2019s message personally, so he asked senior White House official Rick Dearborn to deliver it to Sessions. Dearborn was uncomfortable with the task and did not follow through.\n\nThe Mueller report also indicates that Lewandowski \u201cstored the notes in a safe at his home, which he stated was his standard procedure with sensitive items.\u201d That also suggests he either viewed it as very important (and thus, you would think he would follow up on it) or potentially problematic.\n\nExpect this to be a significant focus of the remainder of the hearing.", "description": "At a House hearing, former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski erected a stone wall.
