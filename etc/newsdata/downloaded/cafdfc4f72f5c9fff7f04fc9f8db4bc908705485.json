We are reviewing the request and will respond appropriately,\" a senior intelligence official told CBS News. \"The ODNI and Acting DNI Maguire are committed to fully complying with the law and upholding whistleblower protections and have done so here.\"\n\nA Senate Intelligence Committee aide said that that committee was aware of the issue and \"is exploring options.\"\n\nPresident Trump named Maguire, a retired vice admiral who was serving as director of the National Counterterrorism Center, acting DNI last month after former DNI Dan Coats and Principal Deputy DNI Sue Gordon offered their resignations.\n\nGordon, a career official who would by law have assumed the acting role, included a note alongside her resignation letter indicating she was not leaving by choice. \"You should have your team,\" she wrote to the president.", "description": "Schiff is concerned that Joseph Maguire may be withholding a whistleblower disclosure involving \"serious misconduct\" by the \"President of the United States and/or other senior White House officials\"", "authors": ["Olivia Gazis"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/05/17/71844efb-6174-422b-a99f-caccdc43df23/thumbnail/1200x630/1d3f874852dc7c6a3c97ff9bee3f47c7/ap-19092567952615.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
