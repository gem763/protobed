McCoy was released by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the offseason after a nine-year stint. He quickly found a new team with the Panthers, but his home is still in Tampa. With the Panthers traveling to San Francisco ahead of Sunday\u2019s game at the 49ers, that meant McCoy would miss a big night for his son.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nBut that didn\u2019t mean McCoy\u2019s son, Marcellus Crutchfield, didn\u2019t have support at the game. McCoy posted on Instagram a video of four of his former teammates in Tampa Bay \u2014 Lavonte David, Donovan Smith, Jameis Winston and Mike Evans \u2014 at Tampa Catholic\u2019s senior night.\n\nSeveral Bucs players make an appearance at TC\u2019s Senior Night game. pic.twitter.com/zeSWA4JcXn \u2014 TC Crusader Athletics (@TCCrusader) October 25, 2019\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t understand the type of brotherhood that sports can build,\u201d McCoy wrote. \u201cIn my time in the NFL I\u2019ve grown to earn true brothers. And this is an example of that!! Anybody who knows me knows how much I love my kids so to miss @m_crutch_ Senior night really hurt me. But my brothers stepped in for me. I truly love these kats!! Family for life!! Its bigger than football!!\u201d\n\nIn the video, David emphasized the bond that the former teammates had. McCoy, 31, made six straight Pro Bowls with the Buccaneers (2012-17) and was first team All-Pro three straight seasons (2012-14).\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here supporting you, supporting Marcellus,\u201d David said. \u201cWe know you couldn\u2019t be here and I know this is a big one for you. We wanted to be here to represent for you, man, let you know that we love you. We always appreciate you, you always part of the family.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "\u201cPeople don\u2019t understand the type of brotherhood that sports can build,\" McCoy wrote on Instagram.", "authors": ["Eric He"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/RsMy1.6fGbCtC3w0ueiFzQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/VPGvCBaVdxRK0hM6hJad4A--~B/aD0yNzQ5O3c9NDEyNDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/b8bf01f0-f7f3-11e9-a57f-4756e44b9427", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
