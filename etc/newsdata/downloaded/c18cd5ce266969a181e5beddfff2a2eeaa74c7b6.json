He added later: \"The concept of investigating a political rival \u2026 that would be inconsistent with our values.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHowever you feel about whether Trump or those close to him broke any laws with regard to Ukraine \u2014 or even whether there was a quid pro quo \u2014 there is no question that Trump was soliciting a foreign investigation into a domestic political opponent.\n\nHere\u2019s what he said to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in their July 25 call, according to the rough transcript provided by the White House: \u201cThe other thing, there\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution, and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution, so if you can look into it \u2026 It sounds horrible to me.\u201d\n\nSullivan sought to draw a line between his sentiment and what transpired in Ukraine, suggesting it might be okay if such an investigation was merely a part of a broader anti-corruption push. But there is no evidence it was. Evidence has shown repeatedly that Trump and his team pushed specifically for two investigations that carry obvious political benefits and not others. There is no evidence of them pushing for other investigations.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSullivan also declined to defend two diplomats involved in managing the effort, European Union Ambassador Gordon Sondland and former special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker. Asked whether their efforts were proper, Sullivan again equivocated.\n\n\u201cWhat they were doing back then was it proper? I\u2019d have to think about that,\" he said, again returning to whether this was part of a broader anti-corruption push.\n\nSullivan was also pressed on the effort to remove now-former Ukraine ambassador Marie Yovanovitch. Yovanovitch said in her deposition this month that Sullivan told her there was such an effort and that she had done nothing wrong, even as she was being removed.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe added that there had been a concerted campaign against me, and that the department had been under pressure from the president to remove me since the Summer of 2018,\u201d she testified. \u201cHe also said that I had done nothing wrong and that this was not like other situations where he had recalled ambassadors for cause.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMenendez asked Sullivan whether he was, in fact, aware of a \u201csmear\u201d campaign against Yovanovitch.\n\n\u201cI was,\u201d Sullivan said.\n\nMenendez then asked whether he believed Giuliani had participated in the smearing.\n\n\u201cI believed he was, yes,\u201d Sullivan said.\n\nLater, under questioning by Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Sullivan expanded: \u201cI was aware that Mr. Giuliani was involved in Ukraine issues. My knowledge in particular in the April, May, June time frame focused on his campaign against our ambassador to Ukraine.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSullivan emphasized repeatedly that regardless of the effort to undermine Yovanovitch, her removal was appropriate as long as the president had lost confidence in her. \u201cThe president\u2019s confidence in his ambassador is the coin of the realm,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the fact remains that he confirmed there was a \u201ccampaign\u201d run by Giuliani to \u201csmear\u201d Yovanovitch.\n\nAD\n\nThrough a series of coincidences, Sullivan finds himself testifying in public, in contrast to witnesses in the House impeachment inquiry like Yovanovitch. That\u2019s because this was a confirmation hearing, not one explicitly focused on the Ukraine scandal.\n\nAnd he found himself in a similar position to other top Trump administration officials, who in these hearings often have to subtly distance themselves from the actions of Trump and those around him. Sullivan wasn\u2019t scorching any earth here, but he didn\u2019t try to put too much of a gloss on what happened, either.\n\nAD", "description": "It was subtle, but notable.", "authors": ["Aaron Blake", "Senior Political Reporter", "Writing For The Fix"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/aQkXF5uLApOFmBhAne3H5Q_ofN0=/1440x0/smart/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/10-30-2019/t_d2729e6c4afd478f952fef4888c4dbdc_name_191030_SullivanHearing_Reuters.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
