Chu Addresses Crazy Rich Asians Writer Leaving Sequel", "language": "en", "text": "Photo: Kevin Winter/Getty Images\n\nLast week, screenwriter Adele Lim left negotiations to join the Crazy Rich Asians sequel over an allegedly large pay disparity between her and fellow writer Peter Chiarelli. According to The Hollywood Reporter, \u201cstarting offers were $800,000 to one million for Chiarelli and $110,000-plus for Lim.\u201d The trade added that, \u201cWarners explained to Lim\u2019s reps that the quotes are industry-standard established ranges based on experience and that making an exception would set a troubling precedent in the business. The talks escalated to studio chairman Toby Emmerich, who backed his business affairs department\u2019s stance.\u201d Today, Crazy Rich director Jon M. Chu posted a note to Twitter addressing Lim\u2019s departure.\n\nFor those of you who are asking... pic.twitter.com/1SoFLrUBbF \u2014 Jon M. Chu (@jonmchu) September 9, 2019\n\nIn addition to the uncredited rewrites Chu said Chiarelli has done, his other official script credits are The Proposal and Now You See Me 2. Lim has written for a dozen TV shows starting in 2002, including Private Practice and the Lethal Weapon series. Upon leaving Crazy Rich, Lim said writers of color are viewed as \u201csoy sauce\u201d to provided accents of authenticity to scripts instead of being recognized for the totality of their creative contributions. She also said at the time, \u201cBeing evaluated that way can\u2019t help but make you feel that is how they view my contributions.\u201d", "description": "Jon M.
