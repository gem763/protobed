OLD MONEY\n\nAnna started the episode by reminding viewers her opinions are generalisations, stressing there are men in all circles of society who women should stay away from.\n\n'There are plenty of low quality men in high society. Just because a man is rich, doesn't mean you have to go for him,' she said.\n\nWhat is 'old money'? The term 'old money' refers to wealth that that has been inherited rather than earned.\n\nAdmitting that the first category may come as a surprise, Anna said women should avoid dating 'old money' if they don't come from the same social background.\n\n'Old money types often like to marry within their own circle. Parents of old money men will often be very strict with the woman the man brings into the house.\n\n'If you're just a regular girl it will be difficult to be welcomed by an old money family,' she said.\n\nShe also noted that coming from a wealthy background does not necessarily make a man generous or successful, with much of their wealth often tied up in property or investments.\n\nAnna said 'regular' girls will find it difficult to integrate into old money families if they come from different social backgrounds\n\n2. PARTY PLAYBOYS\n\nNext, Anna advised against stepping out with jet setting playboys who frequent events like Cannes Film Festival and the Monaco Grand Prix.\n\n'You're never going to be a wife to a party playboy, because they don't really settle,' she said.\n\nAnna warned that even when playboys do commit, the rate of infidelity is very high.\n\n'I'm talking about a 99 percent cheating rate,' she said.\n\n'They're all the same - don't think you will meet Mr Right at Cannes, and don't go searching for your future husband in a nightclub.\n\n'Save yourself a headache because they're not worth your time!'\n\nAnna said high calibre husbands are rarely found in nightclubs or on the upper class party circuit at events like the Monaco Grand Prix\n\n3. DIFFERENT RELIGIONS\n\nAnna began her third warning by acknowledging the controversial nature of her opinion.\n\n'Number three: men who are from a different religion - oh, that was controversial,' she said.\n\nWhile she has dated men from 'all kinds of religions' in the past and supports inter-religious marriages, Anna said it's important to choose a partner who shares similar moral values.\n\n'There are men who are less open-minded than others, more traditional than others - those are the men you should stay away from.'\n\nThings women do that turn rich men ON - Wear nail polish - Wear makeup - but never look like you're wearing 'too much' - Dress elegantly and appropriately - Behave in a feminine way Source: School of Affluence\n\nThings women do that turn rich men OFF - Ask for money - Spend too much time on the phone - Wear 'sl***y' outfits in public - Use rough or masculine language, including swear words Source: School of Affluence\n\nAnna said it's important to find a partner who shares similar moral and spiritual values as conflicting beliefs can raise problems in the long run\n\n4. NARCISSISTS\n\nNext, Anna explained how a huge number of power hungry and emotionally disconnected narcissists move in 'high society'.\n\n'Sadly, it's said that 70 percent of all narcissists are actually men - that is scary,' she said, noting women are consequently at higher risk of falling victim to emotionally damaging, narcissistic behaviour.\n\nAnna said women will always suffer with a narcissistic partner because everything is one-sided and 'all about him'.\n\nMoving in high society circles makes you more likely to mingle with narcissists, Anna warned\n\n5. WORKAHOLICS\n\nLastly, Anna cautioned against dating obsessive workaholics who have little time for anyone or anything outside their job.\n\n'He won't have much time for you, and no matter how much he's into you, work will always be number one,' she said.\n\nAccording to Anna, even the most successful workaholics are unbalanced, distracted and often stressed, character traits which are not conducive to a long term, healthy relationship.\n\n", "description": "London-based matchmaker Anna Bey, 33, teaches women how to 'bag a billionaire' on social media.
