Boroughs of Brent and Hillingdon did not provide figures\n\nUnsurprisingly, London has the most public chargers. However, the borough of Bexley currently has none that were put in place using council funding\n\nOutside London, Milton Keynes, with a population of 230,000, has the highest concentration of council-funded EV charging points, with 0.83 per 1000 population, and 192 points across the town.\n\nNottingham with 215 charging points has more than any other major UK town or city.\n\nKingston Upon Hull, Mansfield, Northampton and Swansea - all of which have populations greater than 150,000 inhabitants - currently have no public electric vehicle charging points that have been put in place by the authority.\n\nFortunately, the volume of council-installed chargers across the country should expand in the next five years.\n\nThe government recently announced a \u00a3400 million investment in electric vehicle charging infrastructure, with half funded by private sector partners.\n\nIt hopes to have 5,000 rapid charging points operational by 2024, with 3,000 of these being new installations.\n\nData was split for London and other major towns and cities. Coventry (pictured) has the fourth highest volume of council-installed public chargers per 1,000 inhabitants, the data shows\n\nAlex Buttle, director of the comparison site, said the UK government has a 'mammoth task' on its hands to create a public charging infrastructure that can cope with the growth in electric car ownership over the next 20 years as the 2040 deadline for the ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel models looms.\n\n'Although we only looked at public, not private charging points (and home charging will make up a significant number of points), there will still be a huge reliance on public charging infrastructure. And it\u2019s severely lacking at present,' he warned.\n\n'The government is trying to encourage people to switch to electric cars, but many vehicle owners are reluctant to do so until they are confident that the infrastructure is fit for purpose.\n\n'We carried out a survey of UK drivers recently and an inadequate charging infrastructure was the most common reason cited by respondents as to why they wouldn\u2019t consider switching to an electric car over the next five years.'\n\nHe added: 'Brexit is understandably at the top of the government\u2019s agenda at the moment, but it\u2019s in danger of taking its eyes off this huge infrastructure challenge, and a public that has no faith in the charging programme, is unlikely to buy into the idea of early switching.'", "description": "A review of London boroughs and 40 major towns and cities across the UK revealed which locations have the most public electric-vehicle chargers - and ones that have none at all.", "authors": ["Rob Hull For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
