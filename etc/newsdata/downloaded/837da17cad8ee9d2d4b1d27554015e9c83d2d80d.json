Saturday\u2019s strikes were carried out by aircraft equipped with a new type of engine, the Houthi rebel group said.\n\n\u201cWe assure the Saudi regime that our long hand can reach wherever we want, and whenever we want,\u201d Houthi spokesman Yahya Saree said in a statement. \u201cWe warn companies and foreigners not to be present in the facilities that were hit in the strikes because they are still within range and may be targeted at any moment.\u201d\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Sunday that there was no evidence the raids were carried out from Yemen. He blamed Iran, as did Secretary of Energy Rick Perry on Monday.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. wholeheartedly condemns Iran\u2019s attack on the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. We call on other nations to do the same,\u201d Perry said at a meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna. \u201cThis behavior is unacceptable. They must be held responsible.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump said the U.S. is \u201clocked and loaded depending on verification\u201d of the culprit. Russia called on countries not to rush to conclusions over who was responsible, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.\n\nIran denied responsibility.\n\n\u201cAccusing Iran of the attacks is in line with the U.S.\u2019s maximum-lies policy,\u201d said Abbas Mousavi, spokesman at the foreign ministry in Tehran. \u201cSuch accusations are unsurprising, unacceptable and baseless.\u201d\n\nSaudi Arabia has yet to assign blame. Its state oil company Saudi Aramco is due to give an update on Monday following the attacks on a major oil field and the world\u2019s biggest crude-processing facility at Abqaiq. Oil posted its biggest ever intraday jump to more than $71 a barrel after the attack knocked out about 5% of global supplies.\n\nOil Jumps Most on Record After Attack Cuts Saudi Arabian Supply\n\nThe Trump administration and Saudi leaders now face a difficult choice in how to respond to Iran or its proxies without triggering a broader conflict that could spiral out of control with potentially devastating consequences for global oil markets and the world economy. Neither country has tipped its hand.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no great response here,\u201d said Aaron David Miller, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \u201cThe question becomes how does the U.S. navigate between not allowing this precedent to stand on one hand, and avoiding a punitive escalation or one designed to deter future attacks without an escalation. And the answer is there is no answer.\u201d\n\nTrump officials had recently floated the idea of talks between the president and his Iranian counterpart at the United Nations General Assembly this month, after more than a year of escalating tensions between the two countries following the U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal.\n\nMousavi on Monday confirmed Rouhani would travel to New York, but said he had \u201cno plans\u201d to meet Trump. Iran has consistently said that no progress was likely in improving ties without the U.S. first removing sanctions on Iranian oil exports. The downing in June of a U.S. Navy drone by Iranian forces almost triggered a conflict.\n\nIts Lifeblood Attacked, What Are Saudi Arabia\u2019s Options\n\nThe circumstances of Saturday\u2019s attack remain unclear. Two administration officials said on Sunday that cruise missiles may have been used. The officials, who asked not to be identified discussing internal deliberations, didn\u2019t rule out the use of armed drones but said the range was beyond anything the Houthis had carried out in the past.\n\nThe U.S. government has determined there were 19 points of attack at the crude-processing facility and the Khurais oil field, all on the north or northwest-facing sides -- suggesting the weapons used came from that direction.\n\nIraq lies to the north, and the U.S. in the past has accused Iran of stashing explosives with affiliated militias in the country. Yemen is hundreds of miles to the south.\n\nSaudi Arabia entered Yemen\u2019s civil war in 2015 to push back Houthi rebels who captured the capital, Sana\u2019a. Despite devastating aerial bombardment and support for groups on the ground, it has struggled to turn the tide of the war or reinstate the internationally recognized government of Yemen President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi. The Saudi-led coalition has instead watched local allies turn their guns on each other in recent weeks while the U.S. has said it\u2019s looking to talk to the Houthis directly about ending the war.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Iranian-backed Yemeni rebels said oil installations in Saudi Arabia remain a target after drone attacks on two major sites slashed the kingdom\u2019s output by half and triggered a record surge in oil prices.The rebel group said its weapons could reach anywhere in Saudi Arabia.
