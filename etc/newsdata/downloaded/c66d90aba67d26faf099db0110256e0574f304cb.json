(AP) - Hundreds of shelter animals from coastal South Carolina have arrived in Delaware ahead of Hurricane Dorian\u2019s expected landfall.\n\nThe News Journal of Wilmington reports the animals were moved from shelters at risk of flooding. The Category 3 storm began making its way across the Carolinas Thursday and was expected to flood low-lying areas and bring enough rain to cause flash flooding concerns well inland.\n\nNearly 200 animals were airlifted off the endangered coast and picked up by Brandywine Valley SPCA early Tuesday. About 150 other animals were expected to arrive that night via land transport from Best Friends Animal Society. The animals may be up for adoption throughout New England later this week.\n\nBrandywine says the lessened South Carolina shelter populations will make space for local pets impacted by Dorian.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Hundreds of shelter animals from coastal South Carolina have arrived in Delaware ahead of Hurricane Dorian's expected landfall.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/04/tropical_weather_georgia_80331_c0-97-2333-1457_s1770x1032.jpg?fff7e0ac793adb7554da80709978c76b501424ba", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
