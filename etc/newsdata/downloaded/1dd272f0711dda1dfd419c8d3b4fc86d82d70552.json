The book will be titled \u201cHow To Avoid A Climate Disaster: The Solutions We Have And The Breakthroughs We Need\u201d.\n\nPhilanthropist Bill Gates takes the stage before addressing the Climate Action Summit in the United Nations General Assembly, at U.N. headquarters, Monday, Sept. 23, 2019. ASSOCIATED PRESS PHOTO\n\nAs per a statement issued here by Penguin Random House India, Gates seeks to share what he has learned in over a decade of studying climate change, and investing in innovations to address the problems.\n\nThe publisher added that he will set out a vision for how the world can work to build the tools it needs to get to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nDon't Miss 461 SHARES 289 SHARES\n\nIn his book, Gates explains why he cares so deeply about climate change and what makes him optimistic that the world can prevent the worst impacts of the climate crisis.\n\n\u201cClimate change is a unique global problem,\u201d said Gates. \u201cI am writing this book to help identify how we can work on a local, national, and global level to build the technologies, businesses, and industries to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.\u201d\n\nGates\u2019s interest in climate change is a natural outgrowth of the efforts by his foundation to reduce poverty and disease. Climate change, according to Gates, will have the biggest impact on the people who have done the least to cause it.\n\n\u201cTo prevent the worst effects of climate change, we have to get to net-zero emissions of greenhouse gases. This problem is urgent, and the debate is complex, but I believe we can come together to invent new carbon-zero technologies, deploy the ones we have, and ultimately avoid a climate catastrophe,\u201d he added.\n\nAs a technologist, he has seen first-hand how innovation can change the world. By investing in research, inventing new technologies, and by deploying them quickly at large scale, Gates believes climate change can be addressed in meaningful ways.", "description": "As per a statement issued here by Penguin Random House India, Gates seeks to share what he has learned in over a decade of studying climate change, and investing in innovations to address the problems.
