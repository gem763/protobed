(Carolyn Kaster/AP)\n\nHas the Supreme Court become a soft touch for the Trump administration? Or are the justices sending a message to lower courts not to become a part of the \u201cresistance\u201d to the president\u2019s legitimate powers?\n\nThe questions became relevant again Wednesday as the court allowed the administration to begin implementing a dramatic change in asylum rules that would bar requests from most Central American migrants who arrive at the southern border seeking protection in the United States.\n\nThe court gave no reason in its one-paragraph unsigned order for effectively dissolving an injunction federal courts had placed on the administration\u2019s new policy. The directive would deny in almost all cases asylum requests from those who had traveled through another country without first seeking protection there.\n\n[Supreme Court says Trump administration can begin denying asylum to migrants while legal fight continues]\n\nWednesday marked the second time since the court adjourned in late June that it approved an emergency request from the Trump administration to overrule a lower court on a border security issue. In July, the justices allowed the administration to proceed in transferring billions of dollars in Defense Department funds to border wall construction.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor, perhaps the court\u2019s most liberal member, accused the administration of bypassing the normal process and racing to the Supreme Court when it receives an unfavorable ruling in a lower court.\n\n\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor reaches out to hug a child in Decatur, Ga., this month. (John Amis/AP)\n\n\u201cHistorically, the government has made this kind of request rarely; now it does so reflexively,\u201d wrote Sotomayor, who was joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. They were the only two to state how they voted on the request.\n\nSotomayor added that the lower courts were still working their way through the legal challenges to the policy, which were filed by immigrant advocacy groups.\n\n\u201cThe court sidesteps the ordinary judicial process to allow the government to implement a rule that bypassed the ordinary rulemaking process,\u201d Sotomayor wrote. She noted that the court in December agreed with lower courts to put on hold another change to asylum law.\n\n\u201cThe court resisted the shortcut the government now invites,\u201d she added. \u201cI regret that my colleagues have not exercised the same restraint here.\u201d\n\n[Supreme Court denies Trump administration request to immediately enforce new asylum rules]\n\n\n\nJustices Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh, seen at the U.S. Capitol in December. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nIt is impossible to know what Sotomayor\u2019s colleagues thought \u2014 or even how they voted. No reasoning was provided in the short order, which is typical for the way the court handles emergency requests on what has become known as the court\u2019s \u201cshadow docket.\u201d There is a briefing on the request but no oral argument or formal opinion.\n\nFive justices are required for a majority, but the court\u2019s members do not have to state how they voted. So it is unclear, for instance, whether Sotomayor\u2019s fellow liberal justices Stephen G. Breyer and Elena Kagan were in the majority, or whether they disapproved of the action and simply declined to join Sotomayor\u2019s dissent.\n\nThe Trump administration has said that its extraordinary number of trips to the Supreme Court is the result of an unprecedented resistance from lower courts and the audacity of district court judges who issue nationwide injunctions against the president\u2019s policies.\n\nIn the case at hand, U.S. District Judge Jon S. Tigar had issued the nationwide injunction soon after the rule was challenged. A panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit limited it to states within the circuit\u2019s jurisdiction \u2014 California and Arizona \u2014 and sent the case back.\n\nTigar heard additional argument from the challengers and government and promptly reimposed the broader injunction \u2014 even though the Supreme Court was considering whether the policy should be enjoined at all.\n\n\u201cDuring the eight years of the Obama administration, 20 nationwide injunctions were issued while the Trump administration has already faced nearly 40,\u201d Attorney General William P. Barr wrote in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece last week. \u201cPartisans who cheer this trend should realize that someday the shoe will be on the other foot.\u201d\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas has called for the Supreme Court to take up the issue of whether district judges should be allowed to impose a nationwide injunction.\n\n\u201cThese injunctions are beginning to take a toll on the federal court system \u2014 preventing legal questions from percolating through the federal courts, encouraging forum shopping, and making every case a national emergency for the courts and for the executive branch,\u201d Thomas wrote in a concurring opinion when the court voted 5 to 4 to allow President Trump\u2019s ban on travel from certain mostly Muslim countries.\n\n\u201cI am skeptical that district courts have the authority to enter universal injunctions,\u201d he wrote.\n\n[Trump views the Supreme Court as an ally, sowing doubt about its independence among his critics]\n\nLiberals and Democrats note that, to use Barr\u2019s language, the shoe already has been on the other foot. A single federal judge in Texas, for instance, stopped President Barack Obama\u2019s plan to extend protected status to some undocumented immigrants whose children were U.S. citizens.\n\nSotomayor referred in her dissent to a study by University of Texas law professor Stephen Vladeck on the increasing number of emergency requests to dissolve blocks on administration policies issued by lower courts.\n\nHe noted that not all of the requests involved nationwide injunctions.\n\n\u201cI think the far better explanation is that a majority of the justices are basing their votes on what are necessarily predictive judgments as to how they\u2019ll ultimately vote on the merits,\u201d Vladeck said Thursday.\n\nThat is supposed to be only one part of the calculation in deciding whether to issue a stay, he noted.\n\n\u201cIf this is the new normal, it would at the very least behoove the justices to say so, so courts of appeals are applying the same rules as the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\n[They\u2019re not \u2018wonder twins\u2019: Gorsuch, Kavanaugh shift the Supreme Court, but their differences are striking]\n\nAlmost all of the cases involve contentious partisan controversies. That is particularly sensitive for a Supreme Court that hates to be thought of as political but in which the court\u2019s five conservatives all were nominated by Republican presidents, and its four liberals were all chosen by Democrats.\n\nTrump has intensified the perception. He routinely refers to the confirmation of his choices for the court \u2014 Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh \u2014 as necessary wins that keep the court in the hands of conservatives. He has referred to the Supreme Court as a bulwark against \u201cObama judges\u201d who mean to undermine him.\n\nLast week, he even tweeted how the court \u201cmust\u201d rule on one of the key cases of the upcoming term. The court is considering whether the administration has followed the law in trying to dismantle Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), Obama\u2019s program to protect from deportation immigrants who were brought to the United States illegally as children.\n\n\u201cDACA will be going before the Supreme Court,\u201d Trump tweeted Sept. 6. \u201cIt is a document that even President Obama didn\u2019t feel he had the legal right to sign \u2014 he signed it anyway! Rest assured that if the SC does what all say it must, based on the law, a bipartisan deal will be made to the benefit of all!\u201d", "description": "Since June, the high court has approved two emergency requests from the Trump administration to overrule lower courts on border security matters.", "authors": ["Robert Barnes", "Reporter Covering The U.S. Supreme Court", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/wLRveyLXUnx0gYlEd0Z983a8T1c=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ICF3N7WVRMI6TFQQ7NLMKURODQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
