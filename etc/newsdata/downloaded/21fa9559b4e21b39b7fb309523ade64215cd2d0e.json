Numerous women have come forward claiming the hammock-like devices caused severe pain, bleeding and infections.\n\nThe settlement, which covers 41 states and the District of Columbia, requires the company to fully disclose risks and stop making inaccurate safety claims. J&J said that the settlement doesn't include admission of any misconduct.\n\nMore than 2 million women implanted the medical devices commonly used to repair weak or damaged tissue and provide support in the event of a pelvic organ prolapse, or POP. But then patients across Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States filed tens of thousands of cases against Johnson & Jonson and other pelvic mesh device makers on the devices. By 2017, more than 700 women in Australia filed a class-action suit against Johnson & Johnson.\n\nThat same year a record jury verdict of $57 million against Johnson & Johnson was awarded to a Pennsylvania woman who was injured by the product. \"I'm in excruciating pain when I'm standing, it hurts when I'm sitting,\" Ella Ebaugh, 51, told CBS Philadelphia at the time.\n\nThis year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in April also flagged the mesh products when Boston Scientific was ordered to stop selling and distributing the mesh products. The FDA said the company had not proven the efficacy or safety of the products.\n\nThe settlement comes as J&J is swamped with thousands of other lawsuits claiming patients were harmed by products including baby powder, opioid painkillers and prescription drugs. The publicly traded consumer products and pharmaceutical giant has underperformed the S&P 500 stock index this year.\n\nAn Oklahoma judge recently determined J&J should pay nearly $500 million to help address the state's opioid crisis.", "description": "Thousands of women have come forward claiming the devices caused severe pain, bleeding and infections", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/02/fdaab633-94ba-4bbf-84e1-98c23694b87a/thumbnail/1200x630/b8fbdf9babdf8726cd3958d8e258fffc/johnson-gettyimages-1164571026.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
