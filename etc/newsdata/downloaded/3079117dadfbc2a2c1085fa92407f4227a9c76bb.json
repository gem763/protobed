The bullying of the teenager by conservative middle-aged men has taken on a grim, almost hysterical edge. And some of them are reaching deep into the misogynist\u2019s playbook to divert focus from her message.\n\nIt is not a rhetorical accident that critics of Thunberg, nearly 17, almost always call her a \u201cchild\u201d. This infantilisation is invariably accompanied by accusations of emotionality, hysteria, mental disturbance, and an inability to think for herself \u2013 stereotypically feminine labels which are traditionally used to silence women\u2019s public speech, and undermine their authority.\n\nIn Australia, Herald Sun columnist Andrew Bolt has called Thunberg \u201cfreakishly influential \u2026 with many mental disorders\u201d. Sky News commentator Chris Kenny described her as a \u201chysterical teenager\u201d who needs to be cared for.\n\nOverseas, male commentators have used similar pejorative terms \u2013 describing her as a \u201cmentally-ill Swedish child\u201d, unstable and a \u201cmillenarian weirdo\u201d. One claimed Thunberg needed a \u201cspanking\u201d; another likened her activism to \u201cmedieval witchcraft\u201d.\n\nObviously these men find Thunberg triggering. But why? At a deep level, the language of climate denialism is tied up with a form of masculine identity predicated on modern industrial capitalism \u2013 specifically, the Promethean idea of the conquest of nature by man, in a world specially made for men.\n\nBy attacking industrial capitalism, and its ethos of politics as usual, Thunberg is not only attacking the core beliefs and world view of certain sorts of men, but also their sense of masculine self-worth. Male rage is their knee-jerk response. Thunberg did not try to be \u201cnice\u201d when she confronted world leaders at the United Nations last week. She did not defer or smile. She did not attempt to make anybody feel comfortable.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

So nice to see!\u201d Happiness here aligns itself with conformity, and an unspoken idea that women and children are expected to be docile and complacent.\n\nBut in reality, Thunberg is cutting through \u2013 rather than displaying \u2013 emotionalism. What certain kinds of men do not wish to acknowledge is that asking for action on climate change is entirely rational.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Thunberg has described herself as having \u201cAsperger\u2019s\u201d, an autism spectrum disorder, and describes it as her \u201csuperpower\u201d.\n\nBut politicians and broadcasters appear to have confused the disorder with mental illness \u2013 a label used throughout history to label and potentially stigmatise \u201cdifficult\u201d women who are told they need bed rest, medication or incarceration. Even today, doctors are more likely to diagnose women than men with depression, even when they present with identical symptoms. Advocates for people with autism have pointed out the disorder is not linked to mental illness.\n\nYet Bolt wrote of Thunberg: \u201cI have never seen a girl so young and with so many mental disorders treated by so many adults as a guru\u201d.\n\n\u201cShe seems chronically attracted to apocalyptic visions, to fear,\u201d he wrote, describing her as \u201cchronically anxious and disturbed\u201d.\n\nNot-for-profit organisation Beyond Blue defines anxiety as stress or worry which occurs \u201cwithout any particular reason or cause\u201d. Therefore by diagnosing Thunberg with anxiety, men are pathologising Thunberg\u2019s concern about the environment and dismissing her fears as baseless and the result of mental illness.\n\nHistory is littered with examples of this. Former coalition minister George Brandis in 2015 famously called Labour frontbencher Penny Wong \u201cshrill\u201d and \u201chysterical\u201d after she interjected during his Senate address \u2013 implying her comments were due to feminine mental instability.\n\nSo too, Australian prime minister Scott Morrison suggested climate change fears were a type of pathology. Following Thunberg\u2019s UN speech he declared that the climate debate subjected children to \u201cneedless anxiety\u201d and suggested they needed more \u201ccontext and perspective\u201d on the issue. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to let kids be kids,\u201d he said.\n\nHere, Morrison is implying that Thunberg\u2019s anxiety is somehow contagious. This is offensive to people with anxiety disorders \u2013 and offensive to passionate and vocal women.\n\nCamilla Nelson is an associate professor in media at the University of Notre Dame Australia and Meg Vertigan is a lecturer in English and writing/academic advisor at the University of Newcastle.
