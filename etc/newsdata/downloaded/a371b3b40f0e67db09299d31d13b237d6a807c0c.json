Danske Hires Commerzbank CFO in String of Management Changes\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Danske Bank A/S (CSE: ) unveiled a number of changes to its executive team, including a new chief financial officer taken from Commerzbank AG (DE: ).\n\nChief Executive Officer Chris Vogelzang, who started at Danske in June, presented a revamped team of top managers to help steer Denmark\u2019s biggest bank through the fallout of its vast money laundering scandal. Stephan Engels will become CFO in April, replacing Christian Baltzer, who will leave the bank after less than a year, Danske said on Thursday.\n\nVogelzang said Engels, who has also held senior positions at the top of the German car industry, brings \u201cstrong execution expertise and management experience.\u201d\n\nThe re-organization follows a series of executive purges at Danske and marks the second time Vogelzang has made changes since taking the helm just a few months ago. His predecessor, Thomas Borgen, has had preliminary criminal charges brought against him because of the laundering affair. An interim CEO who ran the bank before Vogelzang joined, Jesper Nielsen, was fired not long ago for his role in a separate scandal, in which Danske overcharged retail investors.\n\nAs part of the organizational adjustments announced on Thursday, Danske said it will make its Swedish CEO, Berit Behring, the bank\u2019s head of wealth management. She will replace Jacob Aarup-Andersen, who will temporarily serve as CFO until Engels joins. After that, Aarup-Andersen will run Danske\u2019s Danish operations.\n\nDanske shares rose as much as 2.7% in Copenhagen trading, making it the best performer in the Bloomberg Europe Banks and Financial Services Index.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very obvious that Vogelzang is setting up his own team,\u201d Mads Thinggaard, an analyst at ABG Sundal Collier, said. \u201cThat\u2019s probably what is going to work best, looking at the challenges that Danske is facing.\u201d\n\nThe bank also said that Chief Operating Officer Jim Ditmore will leave with a search for a replacement under way, as will Frederik Gjessing Vinten, the bank\u2019s head of group development, whose job is being canceled.\n\nCommerzbank (DE: ) said it was sorry to see Engels leave. As Commerzbank\u2019s finance chief since 2012, he\u2019d helped shape the lender\u2019s new strategy, which included a pivot away from investment banking and toward servicing the retail clients and mid-sized corporate clients in its home market.\n\nHis departure is a setback for Commerzbank (DE: ) CEO Martin Zielke, who already had to give up most of his medium-term targets amid an economic slowdown in Europe\u2019s largest economy and the prospect of lower interest rates.\n\n\u201cI deeply regret Stephan Engels\u2019 decision, but understand his desire to embark on a new, international challenge,\u201d Zielke said in a statement.\n\nBefore Commerzbank (DE: ), he was head of finance & controlling at carmaker Mercedes-Benz and head of group controlling and reporting at Daimler AG (DE: ). Born in Hamburg, Engels studied economics at the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland.\n\n(Updates with analyst comment, share price.)", "description": "Danske Hires Commerzbank CFO in String of Management Changes", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEE8O0LN_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
