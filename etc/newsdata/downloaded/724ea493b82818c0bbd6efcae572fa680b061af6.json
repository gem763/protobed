She could not be immediately reached for comment. Rollins said the district attorney\u2019s office is in touch with You\u2019s representative, and is urging her to return voluntarily. Rollins added the office is prepared to pursue extradition if You doesn\u2019t return voluntarily.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

You, who was also a student at the university studying economics until she withdrew from classes in August, was present at the time of his death, according the prosecutors who say You was tracking Urtula\u2019s location on an iPhone, something she frequently did during their relationship. Rollins said family and friends of both You and Urtula were aware of their allegedly abusive relationship, which lasted for 18 months.\n\nIn the two months prior to Urtula\u2019s death, prosecutors say he and You exchanged more than 75,000 text messages, including 47,000 from You alone. The messages became \u201cmore frequent, and more powerful and more demeaning in the days and hours leading up to Mr. Urtula\u2019s untimely death,\u201d Rollins said.\n\nA spokesperson for Boston College says Urtula was a popular student from Cedar Grove, New Jersey, who was involved in several activities, including the college\u2019s Philippine Society.\n\nAt Monday\u2019s press conference, Rollins acknowledged the similarities between the You case and that of Michelle Carter, a Massachusetts woman who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in 2017 for encouraging her boyfriend, Conrad Roy III, to kill himself when he was 18. She was 17 at the time. A bill in Roy\u2019s name is making its way through the Massachusetts legislature that would make encouraging or assisting suicide a crime punishable with up to five years in prison.\n\n\u201cThere are similarities,\u201d Rollins said of the two cases. \u201cBoth out of our Commonwealth here, but this is a separate and distinct case and we are going to focus exclusively on Mr. Urtula and his family.\u201d\n\nIf you or someone you know may be contemplating suicide, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 or text HOME to 741741 to reach the Crisis Text Line.
