Quarterback Colt McCoy had just thrown the ball out of bounds on third down, marking yet another failed drive, another Tress Way punt.\n\nEarlier in the week, the Redskins coach named McCoy as starter. The 33-year-old, Gruden believed, knew his system best and would be able to generate much-needed offense with the league\u2019s No.1-ranked defense and defending champions on the schedule.\n\nDespite the change, Washington struggled to find any sort of a rhythm Sunday and lost 33-7 to the New England Patriots.\n\nIn what felt like a home game for the Patriots with a sea of diehard fans cheering after every score, quarterback Tom Brady and New England pulled away in the second half \u2014 scoring 21 points.\n\nThe Redskins were a mess on offense. They punted 10 times. They converted just one third down. And McCoy, who has six years of experience in Gruden\u2019s offense, threw for only 119 yards.\n\nWashington fell to 0-5, and Gruden will now see if he gets to coach another week.\n\nTo have any hope of beating the Patriots, the Redskins needed enough breaks to go their way. They got a few in the first quarter. On Washington\u2019s second drive of the afternoon, the Redskins ran an end-around to Steven Sims \u2014 who break free for a 65-yard touchdown.\n\nBut the Patriots answered right back. In just six plays, Brady carved up the Redskins\u2019 secondary \u2014 finding his tight ends for back-to-back 20-plus yard gains. He capped off the drive with a six-yard touchdown pass to Julian Edelman.\n\nOn the extra point attempt, kicker Mike Nugent, signed just days earlier, missed. Another break for Washington.\n\nThe Redskins\u2019 defense finally played up to the level coaches and players imagined before the season. Against the Patriots, the defensive line \u2014 featuring a young trio of Jonathan Allen, Daron Payne and Matt Ioannidis \u2014 wreaked havoc upfront. Brady was sacked three times in the first half and the pressure helped limit the damage when the Patriots entered the end zone.\n\nBut \u2014 shades of last season \u2014 the Redskins\u2019 offense couldn\u2019t spin the defense\u2019s momentum forward.\n\nTwice in the second quarter, Washington committed disastrous mistakes. First, McCoy hit wideout Trey Quinn on an eight-yard route, but the ball was punched out \u2014 and New England recovered on the 16-yard line.\n\nLater, with just 58 seconds left in the half, McCoy threw an interception right to Jason McCourty at the 27-yard line as Sims failed to break in on his route.\n\nThe two turnovers, however, resulted in only a Patriots field goal. Somehow, the Redskins only trailed 12-7 at halftime despite having only 128 yards, half of those coming on Sims\u2019 run.\n\nWashington\u2019s offensive ineffectiveness began to take its toll in the second half.\n\nThe Patriots used big play after big play to slice the Redskins\u2019 secondary. Tired defenders missed tackles and New England had success on the ground and through the air.\n\nNew England\u2019s first touchdown of the second half occurred shortly after exiting the locker room, capping off a seven-play drive with a 29-yard pass to running back Brandon Bolden. The Patriots scored again on a 14-yard rush from Sony Michael and on a 10-yard pass to Ryan Izzo, who was uncovered in the end zone.\n\nBrady finished with 348 yards, three touchdowns and an interception.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
