They looked at whether the deaths occurred in a hospital, home, nursing or long-term care facility, inpatient hospice, or elsewhere, such as outpatient medical facility, emergency department, or dead-on-arrival at the hospital.\n\nThe number of heart disease deaths in the hospital fell from nearly 331,000 in 2003 to nearly 235,000 in 2017. Home deaths, meanwhile, rose from almost 193,000 to over 265,000, accounting for about 31 percent of heart disease deaths in 2017.\n\n\u201cWhen I talk to my patients about what\u2019s most important to them as they begin to reach the end of life, so many of them tell me they want to spend their last moments surrounded by the familiarity of home,\u201d said study author Dr. Haider Warraich, a cardiologist at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston.\n\nPatients in underserved racial and ethnic groups were more likely to die in the hospital and less likely to die at home, according to the findings.\n\nHeart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide, but little is known about where patients die, according to the researchers.\n\n\u201cUnderstanding where patients die can help us determine how we can deliver care to them and what services they\u2019ll require in those settings,\u201d Warraich explained in a hospital news release.\n\nWhile the data show where patients died, it doesn\u2019t reveal what their last days or weeks of life were like, their wishes and whether their place of death reflected those wishes, Warraich noted.\n\n\u201cCardiology has lagged behind other specialties in focusing on end-of-life care, but we\u2019re now seeing more interest in this important area,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing that more people are dying at home than at any other location, but we need to better understand what that experience is like so that we can focus our energy on the needs of our patients,\u201d Warraich said.\n\nThe study was recently published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention outlines heart disease risk factors.\n\nCopyright 2019 HealthDay.
