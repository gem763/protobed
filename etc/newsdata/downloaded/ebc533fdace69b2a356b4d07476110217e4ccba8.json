Its website is still operational but will be also closed on April 10, 2020.\n\nIn a Reddit announcement published on the same day, TipJar\u2019s developer cited \u201cvery little activity on the bot\u201d as the main reason for the shutdown. He also urged users to withdraw their already deposited funds via TipJar\u2019s website as soon as possible, adding:\n\n\u201cThe TipJar reddit bot is being shut down immediately, so tipping other users on reddit is no longer possible. The TipJar website will be shutting down on April 10, 2020. After that point, TipJar accounts will no longer be accessible and funds cannot be transferred. If you have an existing balance in your TipJar account, you should withdraw as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nCrypto winter for smaller projects\n\nThe developer of TipJar also noted that he has \u201cbeen paying the monthly server fees for several years, and although they are pretty minimal, at this point it doesn't make much sense\u201d for him to continue funding the service that sees little interest from users.\n\nRecently, this sentiment was also echoed by the team behind altcoin trading platform Coinexchange.io. As Cointelegraph reported on Oct. 2, the exchange is closing its doors due to low trading volumes and financial difficulties.\n\nFurthermore, according to Coinexchange\u2019s official announcement, the \u201ccosts of providing the required level of security and support now outweigh\u201d its earnings.", "description": "Ethereum-powered Reddit micropayments service TipJar shuts down, its developer urges users to withdraw their funds as soon as possible", "authors": ["Liam Frost"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvNTM5NDUwNmU2NTk0YTM4Mjk2NzBkYmRmYTU3NzM1NDEuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
