But the bank also flagged a charge of $90 million to reflect a deteriorating economic outlook in the city.\n\nOn Sunday, Hong Kong\u2019s Financial Secretary warned the city was likely to end the year in recession because of the ongoing pro-democracy protests.\n\nOverall HSBC warned the second half of the year looked set to be less rosy that the first half, when the bank reported net profit rose 18.6 percent to $8.5 billion.\n\nAround midday in London, HSBC shares had lost four percent to 592.70 pence, making them the top faller on the FTSE 100 index.", "description": "Hong Kong (AFP) \u2013 HSBC is underperforming in parts of Europe and the United States, as third-quarter profits fell, the lender\u2019s interim chief", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/28/618c94_hsbc-warned-its-reporting-year-not-as-rosy-as-six-months-hsbc-profits-fall-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
