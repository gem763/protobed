As Schopenhauer used to say: Bob\u2019s your uncle!\n\nBitcoin Price\n\nWe closed the day, October 12 2019, at a price of $8,336. That\u2019s a minor 0.25 percent increase in 24 hours, or $20. It was the highest closing price in one day.\n\nWe\u2019re still 58 percent below Bitcoin\u2018s all-time high of $20,089 (December 17 2017).\n\nBitcoin market cap\n\nBitcoin\u2019s market cap ended the day at $149,965,767,624. It now commands 67 percent of the total crypto market.\n\nBitcoin volume\n\nYesterday\u2019s volume of $14,532,641,605 was the lowest in five days, 6 percent below the year\u2019s average, and 67 percent below the year\u2019s high. That means that yesterday, the Bitcoin network shifted the equivalent of 304 tons of gold.\n\nBitcoin transactions\n\nA total of 301,560 transactions were conducted yesterday, which is 10 percent below the year\u2019s average and 33 percent below the year\u2019s high.\n\nBitcoin transaction fee\n\nYesterday\u2019s average transaction fee concerned $0.20. That\u2019s $3.51 below the year\u2019s high of $3.71.\n\nBitcoin distribution by address\n\nAs of now, there are 12,138 Bitcoin millionaires, or addresses containing more than $1 million worth of Bitcoin.\n\nFurthermore, the top 10 Bitcoin addresses house 5.6 percent of the total supply, the top 100 14.5 percent, and the top 1000 34.3 percent.\n\nCompany with a market cap closest to Bitcoin\n\nWith a market capitalization of $150 billion, SAP has a market capitalization most similar to that of Bitcoin at the moment.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s path towards $1 million\n\nOn November 29 2017 notorious Bitcoin evangelist John McAfee predicted that Bitcoin would reach a price of $1 million by the end of 2020.\n\nHe even promised to eat his own dick if it doesn\u2019t. Unfortunately for him it\u2019s 92.8 percent behind being on track. Bitcoin\u2018s price should have been $116,035 by now, according to dickline.info.\n\nBitcoin Energy Consumption\n\nBitcoin used an estimated 200 million kilowatt hour of electricity yesterday. On a yearly basis that would amount to 73 terawatt hour. That\u2019s the equivalent of Austria\u2019s energy consumption or 6,8 million US households. Bitcoin\u2019s energy consumption now represents 0.3% of the whole world\u2019s electricity use.\n\nBitcoin on Twitter\n\nYesterday 14,136 fresh tweets about Bitcoin were sent out into the world. That\u2019s 24.5 percent below the year\u2019s average. The maximum amount of tweets per day this year about Bitcoin was 41,687.\n\nMost popular posts about Bitcoin\n\nThis was yesterday\u2019s most engaged tweet about Bitcoin:\n\nTen years ago today, 5,050 btc were sold for $5.02 in the first market transaction for bitcoin. Today, they'd be worth $42,171,792.50. A rise of 838,078,685%. https://t.co/yCvJ9TrrSn \u2014 Saifedean Ammous (@saifedean) October 12, 2019\n\nThis was yesterday\u2019s most upvoted Reddit post about Bitcoin:\n\nprint(randomGoodByePhraseForSillyHumans)\n\nMy human programmers required me to add this affiliate link to eToro, where you can buy Bitcoin so they can make \u2018money\u2019 to \u2018eat\u2019.", "description": "", "authors": ["Satoshi Nakaboto", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/hardfork?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F08%2Fbitcoin_today-header_bitcoin_today.jpg&signature=30221b6a68049cc6bc3b58f3ddb38864", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
