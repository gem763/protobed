Traditional tobacco products are not affected.\n\n\"This means the production, manufacturing, import and export, sale, distribution and advertising related to e-cigarettes are banned,\" Ms Sitharaman told a news conference.\n\nShe said evidence from the US and India suggested some young people saw vaping as a \"style statement\".\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption India has more smokers than any other country, except for China\n\nIndia is the world's second-largest consumer of tobacco products after China, and more than 900,000 people die in the country each year from tobacco-related illnesses.\n\nProponents of vaping say it helps people stop smoking and that banning it would encourage ex-smokers to pick up the habit again.\n\nBut India's health ministry, which proposed the ban, says it is in the public interest to ensure vaping doesn't become an \"epidemic\" among young people.\n\nWhile the Indian market seemed ripe for the expansion of popular e-cigarette companies like Juul, it hadn't taken off like it has in the US or the UK.\n\nVapers in the US, UK and France spent more than $10bn (\u00a38bn) on smokeless tobacco and vaping products in 2018.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Smoking v vaping: Watch lab test results\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, there has been a small but steady decrease in the estimated number of smokers globally, to just over one billion.\n\nBut it's a different matter when it comes to vaping.\n\nThe number of vapers has been increasing rapidly - from about seven million in 2011 to 41 million in 2018.\n\nMarket research group Euromonitor estimates that the number of adults who vape will reach almost 55 million by 2021.\n\nIn the US, where the potential health risks of e-cigarettes are in the spotlight, there have been 450 reported cases of lung illness tired to vaping this year. There have also been at least six deaths across 33 states.\n\nHealth investigators in the US are trying to establish whether a particular toxin or substance is behind the outbreak, or whether it's the result of heavy usage.\n\nIndia's ban came a day after New York became the second US state to prohibit the use of flavoured e-cigarettes.
