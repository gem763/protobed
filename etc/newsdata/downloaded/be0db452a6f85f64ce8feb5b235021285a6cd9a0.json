A year earlier, when the administration suspected that the Assad regime was contemplating the use of chemical weapons, Obama had declared: \u201cWe have been very clear to the Assad regime \u2026 that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized. That would change my calculus. That would change my equation.\u201d Despite this threat, Obama seemed to many critics to be coldly detached from the suffering of innocent Syrians. Late in the summer of 2011, he had called for Assad\u2019s departure. \u201cFor the sake of the Syrian people,\u201d Obama said, \u201cthe time has come for President Assad to step aside.\u201d But Obama initially did little to bring about Assad\u2019s end. He resisted demands to act in part because he assumed, based on the analysis of U.S. intelligence, that Assad would fall without his help. \u201cHe thought Assad would go the way Mubarak went,\u201d Dennis Ross, a former Middle East adviser to Obama, told me, referring to the quick departure of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in early 2011, a moment that represented the acme of the Arab Spring. But as Assad clung to power, Obama\u2019s resistance to direct intervention only grew. After several months of deliberation, he authorized the CIA to train and fund Syrian rebels, but he also shared the outlook of his former defense secretary, Robert Gates, who had routinely asked in meetings, \u201cShouldn\u2019t we finish up the two wars we have before we look for another?\u201d Related Story Portrait of a Presidential Mind The current U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, who is the most dispositionally interventionist among Obama\u2019s senior advisers, had argued early for arming Syria\u2019s rebels. Power, who during this period served on the National Security Council staff, is the author of a celebrated book excoriating a succession of U.S. presidents for their failures to prevent genocide. The book, A Problem From Hell, published in 2002, drew Obama to Power while he was in the U.S. Senate, though the two were not an obvious ideological match. Power is a partisan of the doctrine known as \u201cresponsibility to protect,\u201d which holds that sovereignty should not be considered inviolate when a country is slaughtering its own citizens. She lobbied him to endorse this doctrine in the speech he delivered when he accepted the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, but he declined. Obama generally does not believe a president should place American soldiers at great risk in order to prevent humanitarian disasters, unless those disasters pose a direct security threat to the United States.\n\nPower sometimes argued with Obama in front of other National Security Council officials, to the point where he could no longer conceal his frustration. \u201cSamantha, enough, I\u2019ve already read your book,\u201d he once snapped.\n\nObama, unlike liberal interventionists, is an admirer of the foreign-policy realism of President George H. W. Bush and, in particular, of Bush\u2019s national-security adviser, Brent Scowcroft (\u201cI love that guy,\u201d Obama once told me). Bush and Scowcroft removed Saddam Hussein\u2019s army from Kuwait in 1991, and they deftly managed the disintegration of the Soviet Union; Scowcroft also, on Bush\u2019s behalf, toasted the leaders of China shortly after the slaughter in Tiananmen Square. As Obama was writing his campaign manifesto, The Audacity of Hope, in 2006, Susan Rice, then an informal adviser, felt it necessary to remind him to include at least one line of praise for the foreign policy of President Bill Clinton, to partially balance the praise he showered on Bush and Scowcroft. At the outset of the Syrian uprising, in early 2011, Power argued that the rebels, drawn from the ranks of ordinary citizens, deserved America\u2019s enthusiastic support. Others noted that the rebels were farmers and doctors and carpenters, comparing these revolutionaries to the men who won America\u2019s war for independence. Related Story Obama on the World Obama flipped this plea on its head. \u201cWhen you have a professional army,\u201d he once told me, \u201cthat is well armed and sponsored by two large states\u201d\u2014Iran and Russia\u2014\u201cwho have huge stakes in this, and they are fighting against a farmer, a carpenter, an engineer who started out as protesters and suddenly now see themselves in the midst of a civil conflict \u2026\u201d He paused. \u201cThe notion that we could have\u2014in a clean way that didn\u2019t commit U.S. military forces\u2014changed the equation on the ground there was never true.\u201d The message Obama telegraphed in speeches and interviews was clear: He would not end up like the second President Bush\u2014a president who became tragically overextended in the Middle East, whose decisions filled the wards of Walter Reed with grievously wounded soldiers, who was helpless to stop the obliteration of his reputation, even when he recalibrated his policies in his second term. Obama would say privately that the first task of an American president in the post-Bush international arena was \u201cDon\u2019t do stupid shit.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s reticence frustrated Power and others on his national-security team who had a preference for action. Hillary Clinton, when she was Obama\u2019s secretary of state, argued for an early and assertive response to Assad\u2019s violence. In 2014, after she left office, Clinton told me that \u201cthe failure to help build up a credible fighting force of the people who were the originators of the protests against Assad \u2026 left a big vacuum, which the jihadists have now filled.\u201d When The Atlantic published this statement, and also published Clinton\u2019s assessment that \u201cgreat nations need organizing principles, and \u2018Don\u2019t do stupid stuff\u2019 is not an organizing principle,\u201d Obama became \u201crip-shit angry,\u201d according to one of his senior advisers. The president did not understand how \u201cDon\u2019t do stupid shit\u201d could be considered a controversial slogan. Ben Rhodes recalls that \u201cthe questions we were asking in the White House were \u2018Who exactly is in the stupid-shit caucus? Who is pro\u2013stupid shit?\u2019 \u201d The Iraq invasion, Obama believed, should have taught Democratic interventionists like Clinton, who had voted for its authorization, the dangers of doing stupid shit. (Clinton quickly apologized to Obama for her comments, and a Clinton spokesman announced that the two would \u201chug it out\u201d on Martha\u2019s Vineyard when they crossed paths there later.) Video: Obama's \u201cRed Line\u201d That Wasn't Syria, for Obama, represented a slope potentially as slippery as Iraq. In his first term, he came to believe that only a handful of threats in the Middle East conceivably warranted direct U.S. military intervention. These included the threat posed by al\u2011Qaeda; threats to the continued existence of Israel (\u201cIt would be a moral failing for me as president of the United States\u201d not to defend Israel, he once told me); and, not unrelated to Israel\u2019s security, the threat posed by a nuclear-armed Iran. The danger to the United States posed by the Assad regime did not rise to the level of these challenges.\n\nGiven Obama\u2019s reticence about intervention, the bright-red line he drew for Assad in the summer of 2012 was striking. Even his own advisers were surprised. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it was coming,\u201d his secretary of defense at the time, Leon Panetta, told me. I was told that Vice President Joe Biden repeatedly warned Obama against drawing a red line on chemical weapons, fearing that it would one day have to be enforced. A year-by-year catalogue of some of the magazine's most momentous work.\n\nRead more Kerry, in his remarks on August 30, 2013, suggested that Assad should be punished in part because the \u201ccredibility and the future interests of the United States of America and our allies\u201d were at stake. \u201cIt is directly related to our credibility and whether countries still believe the United States when it says something. They are watching to see if Syria can get away with it, because then maybe they too can put the world at greater risk.\u201d Ninety minutes later, at the White House, Obama reinforced Kerry\u2019s message in a public statement: \u201cIt\u2019s important for us to recognize that when over 1,000 people are killed, including hundreds of innocent children, through the use of a weapon that 98 or 99 percent of humanity says should not be used even in war, and there is no action, then we\u2019re sending a signal that that international norm doesn\u2019t mean much. And that is a danger to our national security.\u201d It appeared as though Obama had drawn the conclusion that damage to American credibility in one region of the world would bleed into others, and that U.S. deterrent credibility was indeed at stake in Syria. Assad, it seemed, had succeeded in pushing the president to a place he never thought he would have to go. Obama generally believes that the Washington foreign-policy establishment, which he secretly disdains, makes a fetish of \u201ccredibility\u201d\u2014particularly the sort of credibility purchased with force. The preservation of credibility, he says, led to Vietnam. Within the White House, Obama would argue that \u201cdropping bombs on someone to prove that you\u2019re willing to drop bombs on someone is just about the worst reason to use force.\u201d\n\nAmerican national-security credibility, as it is conventionally understood in the Pentagon, the State Department, and the cluster of think tanks headquartered within walking distance of the White House, is an intangible yet potent force\u2014one that, when properly nurtured, keeps America\u2019s friends feeling secure and keeps the international order stable. In White House meetings that crucial week in August, Biden, who ordinarily shared Obama\u2019s worries about American overreach, argued passionately that \u201cbig nations don\u2019t bluff.\u201d America\u2019s closest allies in Europe and across the Middle East believed Obama was threatening military action, and his own advisers did as well. At a joint press conference with Obama at the White House the previous May, David Cameron, the British prime minister, had said, \u201cSyria\u2019s history is being written in the blood of her people, and it is happening on our watch.\u201d Cameron\u2019s statement, one of his advisers told me, was meant to encourage Obama toward more-decisive action. \u201cThe prime minister was certainly under the impression that the president would enforce the red line,\u201d the adviser told me. The Saudi ambassador in Washington at the time, Adel al-Jubeir, told friends, and his superiors in Riyadh, that the president was finally ready to strike. Obama \u201cfigured out how important this is,\u201d Jubeir, who is now the Saudi foreign minister, told one interlocutor. \u201cHe will definitely strike.\u201d\n\nObama had already ordered the Pentagon to develop target lists. Five Arleigh Burke\u2013class destroyers were in the Mediterranean, ready to fire cruise missiles at regime targets. French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, the most enthusiastically pro-intervention among Europe\u2019s leaders, was preparing to strike as well. All week, White House officials had publicly built the case that Assad had committed a crime against humanity. Kerry\u2019s speech would mark the culmination of this campaign. But the president had grown queasy. In the days after the gassing of Ghouta, Obama would later tell me, he found himself recoiling from the idea of an attack unsanctioned by international law or by Congress. The American people seemed unenthusiastic about a Syria intervention; so too did one of the few foreign leaders Obama respects, Angela Merkel, the German chancellor. She told him that her country would not participate in a Syria campaign. And in a stunning development, on Thursday, August 29, the British Parliament denied David Cameron its blessing for an attack. John Kerry later told me that when he heard that, \u201cinternally, I went, Oops.\u201d Obama was also unsettled by a surprise visit early in the week from James Clapper, his director of national intelligence, who interrupted the President\u2019s Daily Brief, the threat report Obama receives each morning from Clapper\u2019s analysts, to make clear that the intelligence on Syria\u2019s use of sarin gas, while robust, was not a \u201cslam dunk.\u201d He chose the term carefully. Clapper, the chief of an intelligence community traumatized by its failures in the run-up to the Iraq War, was not going to overpromise, in the manner of the onetime CIA director George Tenet, who famously guaranteed George W. Bush a \u201cslam dunk\u201d in Iraq.\n\nWhile the Pentagon and the White House\u2019s national-security apparatuses were still moving toward war (John Kerry told me he was expecting a strike the day after his speech), the president had come to believe that he was walking into a trap\u2014one laid both by allies and by adversaries, and by conventional expectations of what an American president is supposed to do.\n\nMany of his advisers did not grasp the depth of the president\u2019s misgivings; his Cabinet and his allies were certainly unaware of them. But his doubts were growing. Late on Friday afternoon, Obama determined that he was simply not prepared to authorize a strike. He asked McDonough, his chief of staff, to take a walk with him on the South Lawn of the White House. Obama did not choose McDonough randomly: He is the Obama aide most averse to U.S. military intervention, and someone who, in the words of one of his colleagues, \u201cthinks in terms of traps.\u201d Obama, ordinarily a preternaturally confident man, was looking for validation, and trying to devise ways to explain his change of heart, both to his own aides and to the public. He and McDonough stayed outside for an hour. Obama told him he was worried that Assad would place civilians as \u201chuman shields\u201d around obvious targets. He also pointed out an underlying flaw in the proposed strike: U.S. missiles would not be fired at chemical-weapons depots, for fear of sending plumes of poison into the air. A strike would target military units that had delivered these weapons, but not the weapons themselves. Obama also shared with McDonough a long-standing resentment: He was tired of watching Washington unthinkingly drift toward war in Muslim countries. Four years earlier, the president believed, the Pentagon had \u201cjammed\u201d him on a troop surge for Afghanistan. Now, on Syria, he was beginning to feel jammed again. Related Story A Senior White House Official Defines the Trump Doctrine: \u2018We\u2019re America, Bitch\u2019 When the two men came back to the Oval Office, the president told his national-security aides that he planned to stand down. There would be no attack the next day; he wanted to refer the matter to Congress for a vote. Aides in the room were shocked. Susan Rice, now Obama\u2019s national-security adviser, argued that the damage to America\u2019s credibility would be serious and lasting. Others had difficulty fathoming how the president could reverse himself the day before a planned strike. Obama, however, was completely calm. \u201cIf you\u2019ve been around him, you know when he\u2019s ambivalent about something, when it\u2019s a 51\u201349 decision,\u201d Ben Rhodes told me. \u201cBut he was completely at ease.\u201d\n\nNot long ago, I asked Obama to describe his thinking on that day. He listed the practical worries that had preoccupied him. \u201cWe had UN inspectors on the ground who were completing their work, and we could not risk taking a shot while they were there. A second major factor was the failure of Cameron to obtain the consent of his parliament.\u201d The third, and most important, factor, he told me, was \u201cour assessment that while we could inflict some damage on Assad, we could not, through a missile strike, eliminate the chemical weapons themselves, and what I would then face was the prospect of Assad having survived the strike and claiming he had successfully defied the United States, that the United States had acted unlawfully in the absence of a UN mandate, and that that would have potentially strengthened his hand rather than weakened it.\u201d The fourth factor, he said, was of deeper philosophical importance. \u201cThis falls in the category of something that I had been brooding on for some time,\u201d he said. \u201cI had come into office with the strong belief that the scope of executive power in national-security issues is very broad, but not limitless.\u201d Obama knew his decision not to bomb Syria would likely upset America\u2019s allies. It did. The prime minister of France, Manuel Valls, told me that his government was already worried about the consequences of earlier inaction in Syria when word came of the stand-down. \u201cBy not intervening early, we have created a monster,\u201d Valls told me. \u201cWe were absolutely certain that the U.S. administration would say yes. Working with the Americans, we had already seen the targets. It was a great surprise. If we had bombed as was planned, I think things would be different today.\u201d The crown prince of Abu Dhabi, Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, who was already upset with Obama for \u201cabandoning\u201d Hosni Mubarak, the former president of Egypt, fumed to American visitors that the U.S. was led by an \u201cuntrustworthy\u201d president. The king of Jordan, Abdullah II\u2014already dismayed by what he saw as Obama\u2019s illogical desire to distance the U.S. from its traditional Sunni Arab allies and create a new alliance with Iran, Assad\u2019s Shia sponsor\u2014complained privately, \u201cI think I believe in American power more than Obama does.\u201d The Saudis, too, were infuriated. They had never trusted Obama\u2014he had, long before he became president, referred to them as a \u201cso-called ally\u201d of the U.S. \u201cIran is the new great power of the Middle East, and the U.S. is the old,\u201d Jubeir, the Saudi ambassador in Washington, told his superiors in Riyadh.\n\nObama\u2019s decision caused tremors across Washington as well. John McCain and Lindsey Graham, the two leading Republican hawks in the Senate, had met with Obama in the White House earlier in the week and had been promised an attack. They were angered by the about-face. Damage was done even inside the administration. Neither Chuck Hagel, then the secretary of defense, nor John Kerry was in the Oval Office when the president informed his team of his thinking. Kerry would not learn about the change until later that evening. \u201cI just got fucked over,\u201d he told a friend shortly after talking to the president that night. (When I asked Kerry recently about that tumultuous night, he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t stop to analyze it. I figured the president had a reason to make a decision and, honestly, I understood his notion.\u201d) The next few days were chaotic. The president asked Congress to authorize the use of force\u2014the irrepressible Kerry served as chief lobbyist\u2014and it quickly became apparent in the White House that Congress had little interest in a strike. When I spoke with Biden recently about the red-line decision, he made special note of this fact. \u201cIt matters to have Congress with you, in terms of your ability to sustain what you set out to do,\u201d he said. Obama \u201cdidn\u2019t go to Congress to get himself off the hook. He had his doubts at that point, but he knew that if he was going to do anything, he better damn well have the public with him, or it would be a very short ride.\u201d Congress\u2019s clear ambivalence convinced Biden that Obama was correct to fear the slippery slope. \u201cWhat happens when we get a plane shot down? Do we not go in and rescue?,\u201d Biden asked. \u201cYou need the support of the American people.\u201d\n\nAmid the confusion, a deus ex machina appeared in the form of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. At the G20 summit in St. Petersburg, which was held the week after the Syria reversal, Obama pulled Putin aside, he recalled to me, and told the Russian president \u201cthat if he forced Assad to get rid of the chemical weapons, that that would eliminate the need for us taking a military strike.\u201d Within weeks, Kerry, working with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, would engineer the removal of most of Syria\u2019s chemical-weapons arsenal\u2014a program whose existence Assad until then had refused to even acknowledge. The moment Obama decided not to enforce his red line and bomb Syria, he broke with what he calls, derisively, \u201cthe Washington playbook.\u201d This was his liberation day. The arrangement won the president praise from, of all people, Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, with whom he has had a consistently contentious relationship. The removal of Syria\u2019s chemical-weapons stockpiles represented \u201cthe one ray of light in a very dark region,\u201d Netanyahu told me not long after the deal was announced. John Kerry today expresses no patience for those who argue, as he himself once did, that Obama should have bombed Assad-regime sites in order to buttress America\u2019s deterrent capability. \u201cYou\u2019d still have the weapons there, and you\u2019d probably be fighting isil\u201d for control of the weapons, he said, referring to the Islamic State, the terror group also known as isis. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t make sense. But I can\u2019t deny to you that this notion about the red line being crossed and [Obama\u2019s] not doing anything gained a life of its own.\u201d\n\nObama understands that the decision he made to step back from air strikes, and to allow the violation of a red line he himself had drawn to go unpunished, will be interrogated mercilessly by historians. But today that decision is a source of deep satisfaction for him. \u201cI\u2019m very proud of this moment,\u201d he told me. \u201cThe overwhelming weight of conventional wisdom and the machinery of our national-security apparatus had gone fairly far. The perception was that my credibility was at stake, that America\u2019s credibility was at stake. And so for me to press the pause button at that moment, I knew, would cost me politically. And the fact that I was able to pull back from the immediate pressures and think through in my own mind what was in America\u2019s interest, not only with respect to Syria but also with respect to our democracy, was as tough a decision as I\u2019ve made\u2014and I believe ultimately it was the right decision to make.\u201d This was the moment the president believes he finally broke with what he calls, derisively, the \u201cWashington playbook.\u201d \u201cWhere am I controversial? When it comes to the use of military power,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is the source of the controversy. There\u2019s a playbook in Washington that presidents are supposed to follow. It\u2019s a playbook that comes out of the foreign-policy establishment. And the playbook prescribes responses to different events, and these responses tend to be militarized responses. Where America is directly threatened, the playbook works. But the playbook can also be a trap that can lead to bad decisions. In the midst of an international challenge like Syria, you get judged harshly if you don\u2019t follow the playbook, even if there are good reasons why it does not apply.\u201d\n\nI have come to believe that, in Obama\u2019s mind, August 30, 2013, was his liberation day, the day he defied not only the foreign-policy establishment and its cruise-missile playbook, but also the demands of America\u2019s frustrating, high-maintenance allies in the Middle East\u2014countries, he complains privately to friends and advisers, that seek to exploit American \u201cmuscle\u201d for their own narrow and sectarian ends. By 2013, Obama\u2019s resentments were well developed. He resented military leaders who believed they could fix any problem if the commander in chief would simply give them what they wanted, and he resented the foreign-policy think-tank complex. A widely held sentiment inside the White House is that many of the most prominent foreign-policy think tanks in Washington are doing the bidding of their Arab and pro-Israel funders. I\u2019ve heard one administration official refer to Massachusetts Avenue, the home of many of these think tanks, as \u201cArab-occupied territory.\u201d\n\nFor some foreign-policy experts, even within his own administration, Obama\u2019s about-face on enforcing the red line was a dispiriting moment in which he displayed irresolution and na\u00efvet\u00e9, and did lasting damage to America\u2019s standing in the world. \u201cOnce the commander in chief draws that red line,\u201d Leon Panetta, who served as CIA director and then as secretary of defense in Obama\u2019s first term, told me recently, \u201cthen I think the credibility of the commander in chief and this nation is at stake if he doesn\u2019t enforce it.\u201d Right after Obama\u2019s reversal, Hillary Clinton said privately, \u201cIf you say you\u2019re going to strike, you have to strike. There\u2019s no choice.\u201d\n\n\u201cAssad is effectively being rewarded for the use of chemical weapons, rather than \u2018punished\u2019 as originally planned.\u201d Shadi Hamid, a scholar at the Brookings Institution, wrote for The Atlantic at the time. \u201cHe has managed to remove the threat of U.S. military action while giving very little up in return.\u201d Even commentators who have been broadly sympathetic to Obama\u2019s policies saw this episode as calamitous. Gideon Rose, the editor of Foreign Affairs, wrote recently that Obama\u2019s handling of this crisis\u2014\u201cfirst casually announcing a major commitment, then dithering about living up to it, then frantically tossing the ball to Congress for a decision\u2014was a case study in embarrassingly amateurish improvisation.\u201d Obama\u2019s defenders, however, argue that he did no damage to U.S. credibility, citing Assad\u2019s subsequent agreement to have his chemical weapons removed. \u201cThe threat of force was credible enough for them to give up their chemical weapons,\u201d Tim Kaine, a Democratic senator from Virginia, told me. \u201cWe threatened military action and they responded. That\u2019s deterrent credibility.\u201d History may record August 30, 2013, as the day Obama prevented the U.S. from entering yet another disastrous Muslim civil war, and the day he removed the threat of a chemical attack on Israel, Turkey, or Jordan. Or it could be remembered as the day he let the Middle East slip from America\u2019s grasp, into the hands of Russia, Iran, and isis.\n\nI first spoke with obama about foreign policy when he was a U.S. senator, in 2006. At the time, I was familiar mainly with the text of a speech he had delivered four years earlier, at a Chicago antiwar rally. It was an unusual speech for an antiwar rally in that it was not antiwar; Obama, who was then an Illinois state senator, argued only against one specific and, at the time, still theoretical, war. \u201cI suffer no illusions about Saddam Hussein,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is a brutal man. A ruthless man \u2026 But I also know that Saddam poses no imminent and direct threat to the United States or to his neighbors.\u201d He added, \u201cI know that an invasion of Iraq without a clear rationale and without strong international support will only fan the flames of the Middle East, and encourage the worst, rather than best, impulses of the Arab world, and strengthen the recruitment arm of al-Qaeda.\u201d This speech had made me curious about its author. I wanted to learn how an Illinois state senator, a part-time law professor who spent his days traveling between Chicago and Springfield, had come to a more prescient understanding of the coming quagmire than the most experienced foreign-policy thinkers of his party, including such figures as Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, and John Kerry, not to mention, of course, most Republicans and many foreign-policy analysts and writers, including me. Since that first meeting in 2006, I\u2019ve interviewed Obama periodically, mainly on matters related to the Middle East. But over the past few months, I\u2019ve spent several hours talking with him about the broadest themes of his \u201clong game\u201d foreign policy, including the themes he is most eager to discuss\u2014namely, the ones that have nothing to do with the Middle East.\n\n\u201cisis is not an existential threat to the United States,\u201d he told me in one of these conversations. \u201cClimate change is a potential existential threat to the entire world if we don\u2019t do something about it.\u201d Obama explained that climate change worries him in particular because \u201cit is a political problem perfectly designed to repel government intervention. It involves every single country, and it is a comparatively slow-moving emergency, so there is always something seemingly more urgent on the agenda.\u201d At the moment, of course, the most urgent of the \u201cseemingly more urgent\u201d issues is Syria. But at any given moment, Obama\u2019s entire presidency could be upended by North Korean aggression, or an assault by Russia on a member of nato, or an isis-planned attack on U.S. soil. Few presidents have faced such diverse tests on the international stage as Obama has, and the challenge for him, as for all presidents, has been to distinguish the merely urgent from the truly important, and to focus on the important. My goal in our recent conversations was to see the world through Obama\u2019s eyes, and to understand what he believes America\u2019s role in the world should be. This article is informed by our recent series of conversations, which took place in the Oval Office; over lunch in his dining room; aboard Air Force One; and in Kuala Lumpur during his most recent visit to Asia, in November. It is also informed by my previous interviews with him and by his speeches and prolific public ruminations, as well as by conversations with his top foreign-policy and national-security advisers, foreign leaders and their ambassadors in Washington, friends of the president and others who have spoken with him about his policies and decisions, and his adversaries and critics.\n\nOver the course of our conversations, I came to see Obama as a president who has grown steadily more fatalistic about the constraints on America\u2019s ability to direct global events, even as he has, late in his presidency, accumulated a set of potentially historic foreign-policy achievements\u2014controversial, provisional achievements, to be sure, but achievements nonetheless: the opening to Cuba, the Paris climate-change accord, the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, and, of course, the Iran nuclear deal. These he accomplished despite his growing sense that larger forces\u2014the riptide of tribal feeling in a world that should have already shed its atavism; the resilience of small men who rule large countries in ways contrary to their own best interests; the persistence of fear as a governing human emotion\u2014frequently conspire against the best of America\u2019s intentions. But he also has come to learn, he told me, that very little is accomplished in international affairs without U.S. leadership.\n\nObama talked me through this apparent contradiction. \u201cI want a president who has the sense that you can\u2019t fix everything,\u201d he said. But on the other hand, \u201cif we don\u2019t set the agenda, it doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d He explained what he meant. \u201cThe fact is, there is not a summit I\u2019ve attended since I\u2019ve been president where we are not setting the agenda, where we are not responsible for the key results,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s true whether you\u2019re talking about nuclear security, whether you\u2019re talking about saving the world financial system, whether you\u2019re talking about climate.\u201d One day, over lunch in the Oval Office dining room, I asked the president how he thought his foreign policy might be understood by historians. He started by describing for me a four-box grid representing the main schools of American foreign-policy thought. One box he called isolationism, which he dismissed out of hand. \u201cThe world is ever-shrinking,\u201d he said. \u201cWithdrawal is untenable.\u201d The other boxes he labeled realism, liberal interventionism, and internationalism. \u201cI suppose you could call me a realist in believing we can\u2019t, at any given moment, relieve all the world\u2019s misery,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to choose where we can make a real impact.\u201d He also noted that he was quite obviously an internationalist, devoted as he is to strengthening multilateral organizations and international norms. I told him my impression was that the various traumas of the past seven years have, if anything, intensified his commitment to realist-driven restraint. Had nearly two full terms in the White House soured him on interventionism?\n\n\u201cFor all of our warts, the United States has clearly been a force for good in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you compare us to previous superpowers, we act less on the basis of naked self-interest, and have been interested in establishing norms that benefit everyone. If it is possible to do good at a bearable cost, to save lives, we will do it.\u201d If a crisis, or a humanitarian catastrophe, does not meet his stringent standard for what constitutes a direct national-security threat, Obama said, he doesn\u2019t believe that he should be forced into silence. He is not so much the realist, he suggested, that he won\u2019t pass judgment on other leaders. Though he has so far ruled out the use of direct American power to depose Assad, he was not wrong, he argued, to call on Assad to go. \u201cOftentimes when you get critics of our Syria policy, one of the things that they\u2019ll point out is \u2018You called for Assad to go, but you didn\u2019t force him to go. You did not invade.\u2019 And the notion is that if you weren\u2019t going to overthrow the regime, you shouldn\u2019t have said anything. That\u2019s a weird argument to me, the notion that if we use our moral authority to say \u2018This is a brutal regime, and this is not how a leader should treat his people,\u2019 once you do that, you are obliged to invade the country and install a government you prefer.\u201d \u201cI am very much the internationalist,\u201d Obama said in a later conversation. \u201cAnd I am also an idealist insofar as I believe that we should be promoting values, like democracy and human rights and norms and values, because not only do they serve our interests the more people adopt values that we share\u2014in the same way that, economically, if people adopt rule of law and property rights and so forth, that is to our advantage\u2014but because it makes the world a better place. And I\u2019m willing to say that in a very corny way, and in a way that probably Brent Scowcroft would not say.\n\n\u201cHaving said that,\u201d he continued, \u201cI also believe that the world is a tough, complicated, messy, mean place, and full of hardship and tragedy. And in order to advance both our security interests and those ideals and values that we care about, we\u2019ve got to be hardheaded at the same time as we\u2019re bighearted, and pick and choose our spots, and recognize that there are going to be times where the best that we can do is to shine a spotlight on something that\u2019s terrible, but not believe that we can automatically solve it. There are going to be times where our security interests conflict with our concerns about human rights. There are going to be times where we can do something about innocent people being killed, but there are going to be times where we can\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\n\nIf Obama ever questioned whether America really is the world\u2019s one indispensable nation, he no longer does so. But he is the rare president who seems at times to resent indispensability, rather than embrace it. \u201cFree riders aggravate me,\u201d he told me. Recently, Obama warned that Great Britain would no longer be able to claim a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with the United States if it did not commit to spending at least 2 percent of its GDP on defense. \u201cYou have to pay your fair share,\u201d Obama told David Cameron, who subsequently met the 2 percent threshold. Part of his mission as president, Obama explained, is to spur other countries to take action for themselves, rather than wait for the U.S. to lead. The defense of the liberal international order against jihadist terror, Russian adventurism, and Chinese bullying depends in part, he believes, on the willingness of other nations to share the burden with the U.S. This is why the controversy surrounding the assertion\u2014made by an anonymous administration official to The New Yorker during the Libya crisis of 2011\u2014that his policy consisted of \u201cleading from behind\u201d perturbed him. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to always be the ones who are up front,\u201d he told me. \u201cSometimes we\u2019re going to get what we want precisely because we are sharing in the agenda. The irony is that it was precisely in order to prevent the Europeans and the Arab states from holding our coats while we did all the fighting that we, by design, insisted\u201d that they lead during the mission to remove Muammar Qaddafi from power in Libya. \u201cIt was part of the anti\u2013free rider campaign.\u201d\n\nThe president also seems to believe that sharing leadership with other countries is a way to check America\u2019s more unruly impulses. \u201cOne of the reasons I am so focused on taking action multilaterally where our direct interests are not at stake is that multilateralism regulates hubris,\u201d he explained. He consistently invokes what he understands to be America\u2019s past failures overseas as a means of checking American self-righteousness. \u201cWe have history,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have history in Iran, we have history in Indonesia and Central America. So we have to be mindful of our history when we start talking about intervening, and understand the source of other people\u2019s suspicions.\u201d\n\nIn his efforts to off-load some of America\u2019s foreign-policy responsibilities to its allies, Obama appears to be a classic retrenchment president in the manner of Dwight D. Eisenhower and Richard Nixon. Retrenchment, in this context, is defined as \u201cpulling back, spending less, cutting risk, and shifting burdens to allies,\u201d Stephen Sestanovich, an expert on presidential foreign policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, explained to me. \u201cIf John McCain had been elected in 2008, you would still have seen some degree of retrenchment,\u201d Sestanovich said. \u201cIt\u2019s what the country wanted. If you come into office in the middle of a war that is not going well, you\u2019re convinced that the American people have hired you to do less.\u201d One difference between Eisenhower and Nixon, on the one hand, and Obama, on the other, Sestanovich said, is that Obama \u201cappears to have had a personal, ideological commitment to the idea that foreign policy had consumed too much of the nation\u2019s attention and resources.\u201d\n\nI asked Obama about retrenchment. \u201cAlmost every great world power has succumbed\u201d to overextension, he said. \u201cWhat I think is not smart is the idea that every time there is a problem, we send in our military to impose order. We just can\u2019t do that.\u201d But once he decides that a particular challenge represents a direct national-security threat, he has shown a willingness to act unilaterally. This is one of the larger ironies of the Obama presidency: He has relentlessly questioned the efficacy of force, but he has also become the most successful terrorist-hunter in the history of the presidency, one who will hand to his successor a set of tools an accomplished assassin would envy. \u201cHe applies different standards to direct threats to the U.S.,\u201d Ben Rhodes says. \u201cFor instance, despite his misgivings about Syria, he has not had a second thought about drones.\u201d Some critics argue he should have had a few second thoughts about what they see as the overuse of drones. But John Brennan, Obama\u2019s CIA director, told me recently that he and the president \u201chave similar views. One of them is that sometimes you have to take a life to save even more lives. We have a similar view of just-war theory. The president requires near-certainty of no collateral damage. But if he believes it is necessary to act, he doesn\u2019t hesitate.\u201d Those who speak with Obama about jihadist thought say that he possesses a no-illusions understanding of the forces that drive apocalyptic violence among radical Muslims, but he has been careful about articulating that publicly, out of concern that he will exacerbate anti-Muslim xenophobia. He has a tragic realist\u2019s understanding of sin, cowardice, and corruption, and a Hobbesian appreciation of how fear shapes human behavior. And yet he consistently, and with apparent sincerity, professes optimism that the world is bending toward justice. He is, in a way, a Hobbesian optimist. Video: Jeffrey Goldberg speaks with Ben Rhodes The contradictions do not end there. Though he has a reputation for prudence, he has also been eager to question some of the long-standing assumptions undergirding traditional U.S. foreign-policy thinking. To a remarkable degree, he is willing to question why America\u2019s enemies are its enemies, or why some of its friends are its friends. He overthrew half a century of bipartisan consensus in order to reestablish ties with Cuba. He questioned why the U.S. should avoid sending its forces into Pakistan to kill al-Qaeda leaders, and he privately questions why Pakistan, which he believes is a disastrously dysfunctional country, should be considered an ally of the U.S. at all. According to Leon Panetta, he has questioned why the U.S. should maintain Israel\u2019s so-called qualitative military edge, which grants it access to more sophisticated weapons systems than America\u2019s Arab allies receive; but he has also questioned, often harshly, the role that America\u2019s Sunni Arab allies play in fomenting anti-American terrorism. He is clearly irritated that foreign-policy orthodoxy compels him to treat Saudi Arabia as an ally. And of course he decided early on, in the face of great criticism, that he wanted to reach out to America\u2019s most ardent Middle Eastern foe, Iran. The nuclear deal he struck with Iran proves, if nothing else, that Obama is not risk-averse. He has bet global security and his own legacy that one of the world\u2019s leading state sponsors of terrorism will adhere to an agreement to curtail its nuclear program. \u201cDropping bombs on someone to prove that you\u2019re willing to drop bombs on someone is just about the worst reason to use force.\u201d It is assumed, at least among his critics, that Obama sought the Iran deal because he has a vision of a historic American-Persian rapprochement. But his desire for the nuclear agreement was born of pessimism as much as it was of optimism. \u201cThe Iran deal was never primarily about trying to open a new era of relations between the U.S. and Iran,\u201d Susan Rice told me. \u201cIt was far more pragmatic and minimalist. The aim was very simply to make a dangerous country substantially less dangerous. No one had any expectation that Iran would be a more benign actor.\u201d I once mentioned to obama a scene from The Godfather: Part III, in which Michael Corleone complains angrily about his failure to escape the grasp of organized crime. I told Obama that the Middle East is to his presidency what the Mob is to Corleone, and I started to quote the Al Pacino line: \u201cJust when I thought I was out\u2014\u201d \u201cIt pulls you back in,\u201d Obama said, completing the thought. The story of Obama\u2019s encounter with the Middle East follows an arc of disenchantment. In his first extended spree of fame, as a presidential candidate in 2008, Obama often spoke with hope about the region. In Berlin that summer, in a speech to 200,000 adoring Germans, he said, \u201cThis is the moment we must help answer the call for a new dawn in the Middle East.\u201d The next year, as president, he gave a speech in Cairo meant to reset U.S. relations with the world\u2019s Muslims. He spoke about Muslims in his own family, and his childhood years in Indonesia, and confessed America\u2019s sins even as he criticized those in the Muslim world who demonized the U.S. What drew the most attention, though, was his promise to address the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which was then thought to be the central animating concern of Arab Muslims. His sympathy for the Palestinians moved the audience, but complicated his relations with Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister\u2014especially because Obama had also decided to bypass Jerusalem on his first presidential visit to the Middle East. When I asked Obama recently what he had hoped to accomplish with his Cairo reset speech, he said that he had been trying\u2014unsuccessfully, he acknowledged\u2014to persuade Muslims to more closely examine the roots of their unhappiness. \u201cMy argument was this: Let\u2019s all stop pretending that the cause of the Middle East\u2019s problems is Israel,\u201d he told me. \u201cWe want to work to help achieve statehood and dignity for the Palestinians, but I was hoping that my speech could trigger a discussion, could create space for Muslims to address the real problems they are confronting\u2014problems of governance, and the fact that some currents of Islam have not gone through a reformation that would help people adapt their religious doctrines to modernity. My thought was, I would communicate that the U.S. is not standing in the way of this progress, that we would help, in whatever way possible, to advance the goals of a practical, successful Arab agenda that provided a better life for ordinary people.\u201d\n\nThrough the first flush of the Arab Spring, in 2011, Obama continued to speak optimistically about the Middle East\u2019s future, coming as close as he ever would to embracing the so-called freedom agenda of George W. Bush, which was characterized in part by the belief that democratic values could be implanted in the Middle East. He equated protesters in Tunisia and Tahrir Square with Rosa Parks and the \u201cpatriots of Boston.\u201d \u201cAfter decades of accepting the world as it is in the region, we have a chance to pursue the world as it should be,\u201d he said in a speech at the time. \u201cThe United States supports a set of universal rights. And these rights include free speech, the freedom of peaceful assembly, the freedom of religion, equality for men and women under the rule of law, and the right to choose your own leaders \u2026 Our support for these principles is not a secondary interest.\u201d But over the next three years, as the Arab Spring gave up its early promise, and brutality and dysfunction overwhelmed the Middle East, the president grew disillusioned. Some of his deepest disappointments concern Middle Eastern leaders themselves. Benjamin Netanyahu is in his own category: Obama has long believed that Netanyahu could bring about a two-state solution that would protect Israel\u2019s status as a Jewish-majority democracy, but is too fearful and politically paralyzed to do so. Obama has also not had much patience for Netanyahu and other Middle Eastern leaders who question his understanding of the region. In one of Netanyahu\u2019s meetings with the president, the Israeli prime minister launched into something of a lecture about the dangers of the brutal region in which he lives, and Obama felt that Netanyahu was behaving in a condescending fashion, and was also avoiding the subject at hand: peace negotiations. Finally, the president interrupted the prime minister: \u201cBibi, you have to understand something,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m the African American son of a single mother, and I live here, in this house. I live in the White House. I managed to get elected president of the United States. You think I don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re talking about, but I do.\u201d Other leaders also frustrate him immensely. Early on, Obama saw Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, the president of Turkey, as the sort of moderate Muslim leader who would bridge the divide between East and West\u2014but Obama now considers him a failure and an authoritarian, one who refuses to use his enormous army to bring stability to Syria. And on the sidelines of a nato summit in Wales in 2014, Obama pulled aside King Abdullah II of Jordan. Obama said he had heard that Abdullah had complained to friends in the U.S. Congress about his leadership, and told the king that if he had complaints, he should raise them directly. The king denied that he had spoken ill of him. In recent days, the president has taken to joking privately, \u201cAll I need in the Middle East is a few smart autocrats.\u201d Obama has always had a fondness for pragmatic, emotionally contained technocrats, telling aides, \u201cIf only everyone could be like the Scandinavians, this would all be easy.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe unraveling of the Arab Spring darkened the president\u2019s view of what the U.S. could achieve in the Middle East, and made him realize how much the chaos there was distracting from other priorities. \u201cThe president recognized during the course of the Arab Spring that the Middle East was consuming us,\u201d John Brennan, who served in Obama\u2019s first term as his chief counterterrorism adviser, told me recently. But what sealed Obama\u2019s fatalistic view was the failure of his administration\u2019s intervention in Libya, in 2011. That intervention was meant to prevent the country\u2019s then-dictator, Muammar Qaddafi, from slaughtering the people of Benghazi, as he was threatening to do. Obama did not want to join the fight; he was counseled by Joe Biden and his first-term secretary of defense Robert Gates, among others, to steer clear. But a strong faction within the national-security team\u2014Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Susan Rice, who was then the ambassador to the United Nations, along with Samantha Power, Ben Rhodes, and Antony Blinken, who was then Biden\u2019s national-security adviser\u2014lobbied hard to protect Benghazi, and prevailed. (Biden, who is acerbic about Clinton\u2019s foreign-policy judgment, has said privately, \u201cHillary just wants to be Golda Meir.\u201d) American bombs fell, the people of Benghazi were spared from what may or may not have been a massacre, and Qaddafi was captured and executed. But Obama says today of the intervention, \u201cIt didn\u2019t work.\u201d The U.S., he believes, planned the Libya operation carefully\u2014and yet the country is still a disaster. Why, given what seems to be the president\u2019s natural reticence toward getting militarily ensnarled where American national security is not directly at stake, did he accept the recommendation of his more activist advisers to intervene? \u201cThe social order in Libya has broken down,\u201d Obama said, explaining his thinking at the time. \u201cYou have massive protests against Qaddafi. You\u2019ve got tribal divisions inside of Libya. Benghazi is a focal point for the opposition regime. And Qaddafi is marching his army toward Benghazi, and he has said, \u2018We will kill them like rats.\u2019 \u201cNow, option one would be to do nothing, and there were some in my administration who said, as tragic as the Libyan situation may be, it\u2019s not our problem. The way I looked at it was that it would be our problem if, in fact, complete chaos and civil war broke out in Libya. But this is not so at the core of U.S. interests that it makes sense for us to unilaterally strike against the Qaddafi regime. At that point, you\u2019ve got Europe and a number of Gulf countries who despise Qaddafi, or are concerned on a humanitarian basis, who are calling for action. But what has been a habit over the last several decades in these circumstances is people pushing us to act but then showing an unwillingness to put any skin in the game.\u201d \u201cFree riders?,\u201d I interjected. \u201cFree riders,\u201d he said, and continued. \u201cSo what I said at that point was, we should act as part of an international coalition. But because this is not at the core of our interests, we need to get a UN mandate; we need Europeans and Gulf countries to be actively involved in the coalition; we will apply the military capabilities that are unique to us, but we expect others to carry their weight. And we worked with our defense teams to ensure that we could execute a strategy without putting boots on the ground and without a long-term military commitment in Libya. \u201cSo we actually executed this plan as well as I could have expected: We got a UN mandate, we built a coalition, it cost us $1 billion\u2014which, when it comes to military operations, is very cheap. We averted large-scale civilian casualties, we prevented what almost surely would have been a prolonged and bloody civil conflict. And despite all that, Libya is a mess.\u201d Mess is the president\u2019s diplomatic term; privately, he calls Libya a \u201cshit show,\u201d in part because it\u2019s subsequently become an isis haven\u2014one that he has already targeted with air strikes. It became a shit show, Obama believes, for reasons that had less to do with American incompetence than with the passivity of America\u2019s allies and with the obdurate power of tribalism. \u201cWhen I go back and I ask myself what went wrong,\u201d Obama said, \u201cthere\u2019s room for criticism, because I had more faith in the Europeans, given Libya\u2019s proximity, being invested in the follow-up,\u201d he said. He noted that Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, lost his job the following year. And he said that British Prime Minister David Cameron soon stopped paying attention, becoming \u201cdistracted by a range of other things.\u201d Of France, he said, \u201cSarkozy wanted to trumpet the flights he was taking in the air campaign, despite the fact that we had wiped out all the air defenses and essentially set up the entire infrastructure\u201d for the intervention. This sort of bragging was fine, Obama said, because it allowed the U.S. to \u201cpurchase France\u2019s involvement in a way that made it less expensive for us and less risky for us.\u201d In other words, giving France extra credit in exchange for less risk and cost to the United States was a useful trade-off\u2014except that \u201cfrom the perspective of a lot of the folks in the foreign-policy establishment, well, that was terrible. If we\u2019re going to do something, obviously we\u2019ve got to be up front, and nobody else is sharing in the spotlight.\u201d Obama also blamed internal Libyan dynamics. \u201cThe degree of tribal division in Libya was greater than our analysts had expected. And our ability to have any kind of structure there that we could interact with and start training and start providing resources broke down very quickly.\u201d Libya proved to him that the Middle East was best avoided. \u201cThere is no way we should commit to governing the Middle East and North Africa,\u201d he recently told a former colleague from the Senate. \u201cThat would be a basic, fundamental mistake.\u201d President Obama did not come into office preoccupied by the Middle East. He is the first child of the Pacific to become president\u2014born in Hawaii, raised there and, for four years, in Indonesia\u2014and he is fixated on turning America\u2019s attention to Asia. For Obama, Asia represents the future. Africa and Latin America, in his view, deserve far more U.S. attention than they receive. Europe, about which he is unromantic, is a source of global stability that requires, to his occasional annoyance, American hand-holding. And the Middle East is a region to be avoided\u2014one that, thanks to America\u2019s energy revolution, will soon be of negligible relevance to the U.S. economy. It is not oil but another of the Middle East\u2019s exports, terrorism, that shapes Obama\u2019s understanding of his responsibilities there. Early in 2014, Obama\u2019s intelligence advisers told him that isis was of marginal importance. According to administration officials, General Lloyd Austin, then the commander of Central Command, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East, told the White House that the Islamic State was \u201ca flash in the pan.\u201d This analysis led Obama, in an interview with The New Yorker, to describe the constellation of jihadist groups in Iraq and Syria as terrorism\u2019s \u201cjayvee team.\u201d (A spokesman for Austin told me, \u201cAt no time has General Austin ever considered isil a \u2018flash in the pan\u2019 phenomenon.\u201d) Mess is the president\u2019s diplomatic term for what U.S. intervention left behind in Libya; privately, he calls it a \u201cshit show.\u201d But by late spring of 2014, after isis took the northern-Iraq city of Mosul, he came to believe that U.S. intelligence had failed to appreciate the severity of the threat and the inadequacies of the Iraqi army, and his view shifted. After isis beheaded three American civilians in Syria, it became obvious to Obama that defeating the group was of more immediate urgency to the U.S. than overthrowing Bashar al-Assad. Advisers recall that Obama would cite a pivotal moment in The Dark Knight, the 2008 Batman movie, to help explain not only how he understood the role of isis, but how he understood the larger ecosystem in which it grew. \u201cThere\u2019s a scene in the beginning in which the gang leaders of Gotham are meeting,\u201d the president would say. \u201cThese are men who had the city divided up. They were thugs, but there was a kind of order. Everyone had his turf. And then the Joker comes in and lights the whole city on fire. isil is the Joker. It has the capacity to set the whole region on fire. That\u2019s why we have to fight it.\u201d The rise of the Islamic State deepened Obama\u2019s conviction that the Middle East could not be fixed\u2014not on his watch, and not for a generation to come. On a rainy Wednesday in mid-November, President Obama appeared on a stage at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (apec) summit in Manila with Jack Ma, the founder of the Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba, and a 31-year-old Filipina inventor named Aisa Mijeno. The ballroom was crowded with Asian CEOs, American business leaders, and government officials from across the region. Obama, who was greeted warmly, first delivered informal remarks from behind a podium, mainly about the threat of climate change. Obama made no mention of the subject preoccupying much of the rest of the world\u2014the isis attacks in Paris five days earlier, which had killed 130 people. Obama had arrived in Manila the day before from a G20 summit held in Antalya, Turkey. The Paris attacks had been a main topic of conversation in Antalya, where Obama held a particularly contentious press conference on the subject. The traveling White House press corps was unrelenting: \u201cIsn\u2019t it time for your strategy to change?\u201d one reporter asked. This was followed by \u201cCould I ask you to address your critics who say that your reluctance to enter another Middle East war, and your preference of diplomacy over using the military, makes the United States weaker and emboldens our enemies?\u201d And then came this imperishable question, from a CNN reporter: \u201cIf you\u2019ll forgive the language\u2014why can\u2019t we take out these bastards?\u201d Which was followed by \u201cDo you think you really understand this enemy well enough to defeat them and to protect the homeland?\u201d As the questions unspooled, Obama became progressively more irritated. He described his isis strategy at length, but the only time he exhibited an emotion other than disdain was when he addressed an emerging controversy about America\u2019s refugee policy. Republican governors and presidential candidates had suddenly taken to demanding that the United States block Syrian refugees from coming to America. Ted Cruz had proposed accepting only Christian Syrians. Chris Christie had said that all refugees, including \u201corphans under 5,\u201d should be banned from entry until proper vetting procedures had been put in place. This rhetoric appeared to frustrate Obama immensely. \u201cWhen I hear folks say that, well, maybe we should just admit the Christians but not the Muslims; when I hear political leaders suggesting that there would be a religious test for which person who\u2019s fleeing from a war-torn country is admitted,\u201d Obama told the assembled reporters, \u201cthat\u2019s not American. That\u2019s not who we are. We don\u2019t have religious tests to our compassion.\u201d \u201cAren\u2019t the Saudis your friends?\u201d the prime minister asked. Obama smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated.\u201d Air Force One departed Antalya and arrived 10 hours later in Manila. That\u2019s when the president\u2019s advisers came to understand, in the words of one official, that \u201ceveryone back home had lost their minds.\u201d Susan Rice, trying to comprehend the rising anxiety, searched her hotel television in vain for CNN, finding only the BBC and Fox News. She toggled between the two, looking for the mean, she told people on the trip. Later, the president would say that he had failed to fully appreciate the fear many Americans were experiencing about the possibility of a Paris-style attack in the U.S. Great distance, a frantic schedule, and the jet-lag haze that envelops a globe-spanning presidential trip were working against him. But he has never believed that terrorism poses a threat to America commensurate with the fear it generates. Even during the period in 2014 when isis was executing its American captives in Syria, his emotions were in check. Valerie Jarrett, Obama\u2019s closest adviser, told him people were worried that the group would soon take its beheading campaign to the U.S. \u201cThey\u2019re not coming here to chop our heads off,\u201d he reassured her. Obama frequently reminds his staff that terrorism takes far fewer lives in America than handguns, car accidents, and falls in bathtubs do. Several years ago, he expressed to me his admiration for Israelis\u2019 \u201cresilience\u201d in the face of constant terrorism, and it is clear that he would like to see resilience replace panic in American society. Nevertheless, his advisers are fighting a constant rearguard action to keep Obama from placing terrorism in what he considers its \u201cproper\u201d perspective, out of concern that he will seem insensitive to the fears of the American people. The frustration among Obama\u2019s advisers spills over into the Pentagon and the State Department. John Kerry, for one, seems more alarmed about isis than the president does. Recently, when I asked the secretary of state a general question\u2014is the Middle East still important to the U.S.?\u2014he answered by talking exclusively about isis. \u201cThis is a threat to everybody in the world,\u201d he said, a group \u201covertly committed to destroying people in the West and in the Middle East. Imagine what would happen if we don\u2019t stand and fight them, if we don\u2019t lead a coalition\u2014as we are doing, by the way. If we didn\u2019t do that, you could have allies and friends of ours fall. You could have a massive migration into Europe that destroys Europe, leads to the pure destruction of Europe, ends the European project, and everyone runs for cover and you\u2019ve got the 1930s all over again, with nationalism and fascism and other things breaking out. Of course we have an interest in this, a huge interest in this.\u201d When I noted to Kerry that the president\u2019s rhetoric doesn\u2019t match his, he said, \u201cPresident Obama sees all of this, but he doesn\u2019t gin it up into this kind of\u2014he thinks we are on track. He has escalated his efforts. But he\u2019s not trying to create hysteria \u2026 I think the president is always inclined to try to keep things on an appropriate equilibrium. I respect that.\u201d Obama modulates his discussion of terrorism for several reasons: He is, by nature, Spockian. And he believes that a misplaced word, or a frightened look, or an ill-considered hyperbolic claim, could tip the country into panic. The sort of panic he worries about most is the type that would manifest itself in anti-Muslim xenophobia or in a challenge to American openness and to the constitutional order. The president also gets frustrated that terrorism keeps swamping his larger agenda, particularly as it relates to rebalancing America\u2019s global priorities. For years, the \u201cpivot to Asia\u201d has been a paramount priority of his. America\u2019s economic future lies in Asia, he believes, and the challenge posed by China\u2019s rise requires constant attention. From his earliest days in office, Obama has been focused on rebuilding the sometimes-threadbare ties between the U.S. and its Asian treaty partners, and he is perpetually on the hunt for opportunities to draw other Asian nations into the U.S. orbit. His dramatic opening to Burma was one such opportunity; Vietnam and the entire constellation of Southeast Asian countries fearful of Chinese domination presented others. In Manila, at apec, Obama was determined to keep the conversation focused on this agenda, and not on what he viewed as the containable challenge presented by isis. Obama\u2019s secretary of defense, Ashton Carter, told me not long ago that Obama has maintained his focus on Asia even as Syria and other Middle Eastern conflicts continue to flare. Obama believes, Carter said, that Asia \u201cis the part of the world of greatest consequence to the American future, and that no president can take his eye off of this.\u201d He added, \u201cHe consistently asks, even in the midst of everything else that\u2019s going on, \u2018Where are we in the Asia-Pacific rebalance? Where are we in terms of resources?\u2019 He\u2019s been extremely consistent about that, even in times of Middle East tension.\u201d After Obama finished his presentation on climate change, he joined Ma and Mijeno, who had seated themselves on nearby armchairs, where Obama was preparing to interview them in the manner of a daytime talk-show host\u2014an approach that seemed to induce a momentary bout of status-inversion vertigo in an audience not accustomed to such behavior in their own leaders. Obama began by asking Ma a question about climate change. Ma, unsurprisingly, agreed with Obama that it was a very important issue. Then Obama turned to Mijeno. A laboratory operating in the hidden recesses of the West Wing could not have fashioned a person more expertly designed to appeal to Obama\u2019s wonkish enthusiasms than Mijeno, a young engineer who, with her brother, had invented a lamp that is somehow powered by salt water. \u201cJust to be clear, Aisa, so with some salt water, the device that you\u2019ve set up can provide\u2014am I right?\u2014about eight hours of lighting?,\u201d Obama asked. \u201cEight hours of lighting,\u201d she responded. Obama: \u201cAnd the lamp is $20\u2014\u201d Mijeno: \u201cAround $20.\u201d \u201cI think Aisa is a perfect example of what we\u2019re seeing in a lot of countries\u2014young entrepreneurs coming up with leapfrog technologies, in the same ways that in large portions of Asia and Africa, the old landline phones never got set up,\u201d Obama said, because those areas jumped straight to mobile phones. Obama encouraged Jack Ma to fund her work. \u201cShe\u2019s won, by the way, a lot of prizes and gotten a lot of attention, so this is not like one of those infomercials where you order it, and you can\u2019t make the thing work,\u201d he said, to laughter. The next day, aboard Air Force One en route to Kuala Lumpur, I mentioned to Obama that he seemed genuinely happy to be onstage with Ma and Mijeno, and then I pivoted away from Asia, asking him if anything about the Middle East makes him happy. \u201cRight now, I don\u2019t think that anybody can be feeling good about the situation in the Middle East,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have countries that are failing to provide prosperity and opportunity for their people. You\u2019ve got a violent, extremist ideology, or ideologies, that are turbocharged through social media. You\u2019ve got countries that have very few civic traditions, so that as autocratic regimes start fraying, the only organizing principles are sectarian.\u201d He went on, \u201cContrast that with Southeast Asia, which still has huge problems\u2014enormous poverty, corruption\u2014but is filled with striving, ambitious, energetic people who are every single day scratching and clawing to build businesses and get education and find jobs and build infrastructure. The contrast is pretty stark.\u201d In Asia, as well as in Latin America and Africa, Obama says, he sees young people yearning for self-improvement, modernity, education, and material wealth. \u201cThey are not thinking about how to kill Americans,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat they\u2019re thinking about is How do I get a better education? How do I create something of value?\u201d He then made an observation that I came to realize was representative of his bleakest, most visceral understanding of the Middle East today\u2014not the sort of understanding that a White House still oriented around themes of hope and change might choose to advertise. \u201cIf we\u2019re not talking to them,\u201d he said, referring to young Asians and Africans and Latin Americans, \u201cbecause the only thing we\u2019re doing is figuring out how to destroy or cordon off or control the malicious, nihilistic, violent parts of humanity, then we\u2019re missing the boat.\u201d Obama\u2019s critics argue that he is ineffective in cordoning off the violent nihilists of radical Islam because he doesn\u2019t understand the threat. He does resist refracting radical Islam through the \u201cclash of civilizations\u201d prism popularized by the late political scientist Samuel Huntington. But this is because, he and his advisers argue, he does not want to enlarge the ranks of the enemy. \u201cThe goal is not to force a Huntington template onto this conflict,\u201d said John Brennan, the CIA director. Both Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and David Cameron have spoken about the threat of radical Islam in more Huntingtonesque terms, and I\u2019ve heard that both men wish Obama would use more-direct language in discussing the threat. When I mentioned this to Obama he said, \u201cHollande and Cameron have used phrases, like radical Islam, that we have not used on a regular basis as our way of targeting terrorism. But I\u2019ve never had a conversation when they said, \u2018Man, how come you\u2019re not using this phrase the way you hear Republicans say it?\u2019 \u201d Obama says he has demanded that Muslim leaders do more to eliminate the threat of violent fundamentalism. \u201cIt is very clear what I mean,\u201d he told me, \u201cwhich is that there is a violent, radical, fanatical, nihilistic interpretation of Islam by a faction\u2014a tiny faction\u2014within the Muslim community that is our enemy, and that has to be defeated.\u201d He then offered a critique that sounded more in line with the rhetoric of Cameron and Hollande. \u201cThere is also the need for Islam as a whole to challenge that interpretation of Islam, to isolate it, and to undergo a vigorous discussion within their community about how Islam works as part of a peaceful, modern society,\u201d he said. But he added, \u201cI do not persuade peaceful, tolerant Muslims to engage in that debate if I\u2019m not sensitive to their concern that they are being tagged with a broad brush.\u201d\n\nIn private encounters with other world leaders, Obama has argued that there will be no comprehensive solution to Islamist terrorism until Islam reconciles itself to modernity and undergoes some of the reforms that have changed Christianity. Though he has argued, controversially, that the Middle East\u2019s conflicts \u201cdate back millennia,\u201d he also believes that the intensified Muslim fury of recent years was encouraged by countries considered friends of the U.S. In a meeting during apec with Malcolm Turnbull, the new prime minister of Australia, Obama described how he has watched Indonesia gradually move from a relaxed, syncretistic Islam to a more fundamentalist, unforgiving interpretation; large numbers of Indonesian women, he observed, have now adopted the hijab, the Muslim head covering. Why, Turnbull asked, was this happening? Because, Obama answered, the Saudis and other Gulf Arabs have funneled money, and large numbers of imams and teachers, into the country. In the 1990s, the Saudis heavily funded Wahhabist madrassas, seminaries that teach the fundamentalist version of Islam favored by the Saudi ruling family, Obama told Turnbull. Today, Islam in Indonesia is much more Arab in orientation than it was when he lived there, he said. \u201cAren\u2019t the Saudis your friends?,\u201d Turnbull asked. Obama smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated,\u201d he said. Obama\u2019s patience with Saudi Arabia has always been limited. In his first foreign-policy commentary of note, that 2002 speech at the antiwar rally in Chicago, he said, \u201cYou want a fight, President Bush? Let\u2019s fight to make sure our so-called allies in the Middle East\u2014the Saudis and the Egyptians\u2014stop oppressing their own people, and suppressing dissent, and tolerating corruption and inequality.\u201d In the White House these days, one occasionally hears Obama\u2019s National Security Council officials pointedly reminding visitors that the large majority of 9/11 hijackers were not Iranian, but Saudi\u2014and Obama himself rails against Saudi Arabia\u2019s state-sanctioned misogyny, arguing in private that \u201ca country cannot function in the modern world when it is repressing half of its population.\u201d In meetings with foreign leaders, Obama has said, \u201cYou can gauge the success of a society by how it treats its women.\u201d His frustration with the Saudis informs his analysis of Middle Eastern power politics. At one point I observed to him that he is less likely than previous presidents to axiomatically side with Saudi Arabia in its dispute with its archrival, Iran. He didn\u2019t disagree. \u201cIran, since 1979, has been an enemy of the United States, and has engaged in state-sponsored terrorism, is a genuine threat to Israel and many of our allies, and engages in all kinds of destructive behavior,\u201d the president said. \u201cAnd my view has never been that we should throw our traditional allies\u201d\u2014the Saudis\u2014\u201coverboard in favor of Iran.\u201d But he went on to say that the Saudis need to \u201cshare\u201d the Middle East with their Iranian foes. \u201cThe competition between the Saudis and the Iranians\u2014which has helped to feed proxy wars and chaos in Syria and Iraq and Yemen\u2014requires us to say to our friends as well as to the Iranians that they need to find an effective way to share the neighborhood and institute some sort of cold peace,\u201d he said. \u201cAn approach that said to our friends \u2018You are right, Iran is the source of all problems, and we will support you in dealing with Iran\u2019 would essentially mean that as these sectarian conflicts continue to rage and our Gulf partners, our traditional friends, do not have the ability to put out the flames on their own or decisively win on their own, and would mean that we have to start coming in and using our military power to settle scores. And that would be in the interest neither of the United States nor of the Middle East.\u201d One of the most destructive forces in the Middle East, Obama believes, is tribalism\u2014a force no president can neutralize. Tribalism, made manifest in the reversion to sect, creed, clan, and village by the desperate citizens of failing states, is the source of much of the Muslim Middle East\u2019s problems, and it is another source of his fatalism. Obama has deep respect for the destructive resilience of tribalism\u2014part of his memoir, Dreams From My Father, concerns the way in which tribalism in post-colonial Kenya helped ruin his father\u2019s life\u2014which goes some distance in explaining why he is so fastidious about avoiding entanglements in tribal conflicts. \u201cIt is literally in my DNA to be suspicious of tribalism,\u201d he told me. \u201cI understand the tribal impulse, and acknowledge the power of tribal division. I\u2019ve been navigating tribal divisions my whole life. In the end, it\u2019s the source of a lot of destructive acts.\u201d While flying to Kuala Lumpur with the president, I recalled a passing reference he had once made to me about the Hobbesian argument for strong government as an antidote to the unforgiving state of nature. When Obama looks at swathes of the Middle East, Hobbes\u2019s \u201cwar of all against all\u201d is what he sees. \u201cI have a recognition that us serving as the Leviathan clamps down and tames some of these impulses,\u201d Obama had said. So I tried to reopen this conversation with an unfortunately prolix question about, among other things, \u201cthe Hobbesian notion that people organize themselves into collectives to stave off their supreme fear, which is death.\u201d Ben Rhodes and Joshua Earnest, the White House spokesman, who were seated on a couch to the side of Obama\u2019s desk on Air Force One, could barely suppress their amusement at my discursiveness. I paused and said, \u201cI bet if I asked that in a press conference my colleagues would just throw me out of the room.\u201d \u201cI would be really into it,\u201d Obama said, \u201cbut everybody else would be rolling their eyes.\u201d Rhodes interjected: \u201cWhy can\u2019t we get the bastards?\u201d That question, the one put to the president by the CNN reporter at the press conference in Turkey, had become a topic of sardonic conversation during the trip. I turned to the president: \u201cWell, yeah, and also, why can\u2019t we get the bastards?\u201d He took the first question. \u201cLook, I am not of the view that human beings are inherently evil,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe that there\u2019s more good than bad in humanity. And if you look at the trajectory of history, I am optimistic. \u201cI believe that overall, humanity has become less violent, more tolerant, healthier, better fed, more empathetic, more able to manage difference. But it\u2019s hugely uneven. And what has been clear throughout the 20th and 21st centuries is that the progress we make in social order and taming our baser impulses and steadying our fears can be reversed very quickly. Social order starts breaking down if people are under profound stress. Then the default position is tribe\u2014us/them, a hostility toward the unfamiliar or the unknown.\u201d He continued, \u201cRight now, across the globe, you\u2019re seeing places that are undergoing severe stress because of globalization, because of the collision of cultures brought about by the Internet and social media, because of scarcities\u2014some of which will be attributable to climate change over the next several decades\u2014because of population growth. And in those places, the Middle East being Exhibit A, the default position for a lot of folks is to organize tightly in the tribe and to push back or strike out against those who are different. \u201cA group like isil is the distillation of every worst impulse along these lines. The notion that we are a small group that defines ourselves primarily by the degree to which we can kill others who are not like us, and attempting to impose a rigid orthodoxy that produces nothing, that celebrates nothing, that really is contrary to every bit of human progress\u2014it indicates the degree to which that kind of mentality can still take root and gain adherents in the 21st century.\u201d So your appreciation for tribalism\u2019s power makes you want to stay away?, I asked. \u201cIn other words, when people say \u2018Why don\u2019t you just go get the bastards?,\u2019 you step back?\u201d \u201cWe have to determine the best tools to roll back those kinds of attitudes,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are going to be times where either because it\u2019s not a direct threat to us or because we just don\u2019t have the tools in our toolkit to have a huge impact that, tragically, we have to refrain from jumping in with both feet.\u201d I asked Obama whether he would have sent the Marines to Rwanda in 1994 to stop the genocide as it was happening, had he been president at the time. \u201cGiven the speed with which the killing took place, and how long it takes to crank up the machinery of the U.S. government, I understand why we did not act fast enough,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, we should learn from that. I actually think that Rwanda is an interesting test case because it\u2019s possible\u2014not guaranteed, but it\u2019s possible\u2014that this was a situation where the quick application of force might have been enough.\u201d He related this to Syria: \u201cIronically, it\u2019s probably easier to make an argument that a relatively small force inserted quickly with international support would have resulted in averting genocide [more successfully in Rwanda] than in Syria right now, where the degree to which the various groups are armed and hardened fighters and are supported by a whole host of external actors with a lot of resources requires a much larger commitment of forces.\u201d Obama-administration officials argue that he has a comprehensible approach to fighting terrorism: a drone air force, Special Forces raids, a clandestine CIA-aided army of 10,000 rebels battling in Syria. So why does Obama stumble when explaining to the American people that he, too, cares about terrorism? The Turkey press conference, I told him, \u201cwas a moment for you as a politician to say, \u2018Yeah, I hate the bastards too, and by the way, I am taking out the bastards.\u2019 \u201d The easy thing to do would have been to reassure Americans in visceral terms that he will kill the people who want to kill them. Does he fear a knee-jerk reaction in the direction of another Middle East invasion? Or is he just inalterably Spockian? \u201cEvery president has strengths and weaknesses,\u201d he answered. \u201cAnd there is no doubt that there are times where I have not been attentive enough to feelings and emotions and politics in communicating what we\u2019re doing and how we\u2019re doing it.\u201d But for America to be successful in leading the world, he continued, \u201cI believe that we have to avoid being simplistic. I think we have to build resilience and make sure that our political debates are grounded in reality. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t appreciate the value of theater in political communications; it\u2019s that the habits we\u2014the media, politicians\u2014have gotten into, and how we talk about these issues, are so detached so often from what we need to be doing that for me to satisfy the cable news hype-fest would lead to us making worse and worse decisions over time.\u201d\n\nAs Air Force One began its descent toward Kuala Lumpur, the president mentioned the successful U.S.-led effort to stop the Ebola epidemic in West Africa as a positive example of steady, nonhysterical management of a terrifying crisis. \u201cDuring the couple of months in which everybody was sure Ebola was going to destroy the Earth and there was 24/7 coverage of Ebola, if I had fed the panic or in any way strayed from \u2018Here are the facts, here\u2019s what needs to be done, here\u2019s how we\u2019re handling it, the likelihood of you getting Ebola is very slim, and here\u2019s what we need to do both domestically and overseas to stamp out this epidemic,\u2019 \u201d then \u201cmaybe people would have said \u2018Obama is taking this as seriously as he needs to be.\u2019 \u201d But feeding the panic by overreacting could have shut down travel to and from three African countries that were already cripplingly poor, in ways that might have destroyed their economies\u2014which would likely have meant, among other things, a recurrence of Ebola. He added, \u201cIt would have also meant that we might have wasted a huge amount of resources in our public-health systems that need to be devoted to flu vaccinations and other things that actually kill people\u201d in large numbers in America. The plane landed. The president, leaning back in his office chair with his jacket off and his tie askew, did not seem to notice. Outside, on the tarmac, I could see that what appeared to be a large portion of the Malaysian Armed Forces had assembled to welcome him. As he continued talking, I began to worry that the waiting soldiers and dignitaries would get hot. \u201cI think we\u2019re in Malaysia,\u201d I said. \u201cIt seems to be outside this plane.\u201d He conceded that this was true, but seemed to be in no rush, so I pressed him about his public reaction to terrorism: If he showed more emotion, wouldn\u2019t that calm people down rather than rile them up? \u201cI have friends who have kids in Paris right now,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you and I and a whole bunch of people who are writing about what happened in Paris have strolled along the same streets where people were gunned down. And it\u2019s right to feel fearful. And it\u2019s important for us not to ever get complacent. There\u2019s a difference between resilience and complacency.\u201d He went on to describe another difference\u2014between making considered decisions and making rash, emotional ones. \u201cWhat it means, actually, is that you care so much that you want to get it right and you\u2019re not going to indulge in either impetuous or, in some cases, manufactured responses that make good sound bites but don\u2019t produce results. The stakes are too high to play those games.\u201d \u201cISIS is not an existential threat to the United States. Climate change is a potential existential threat to the entire world if we don\u2019t do something about it.\u201d With that, Obama stood up and said, \u201cOkay, gotta go.\u201d He headed out of his office and down the stairs, to the red carpet and the honor guard and the cluster of Malaysian officials waiting to greet him, and then to his armored limousine, flown to Kuala Lumpur ahead of him. (Early in his first term, still unaccustomed to the massive military operation it takes to move a president from one place to another, he noted ruefully to aides, \u201cI have the world\u2019s largest carbon footprint.\u201d) The president\u2019s first stop was another event designed to highlight his turn to Asia, this one a town-hall meeting with students and entrepreneurs participating in the administration\u2019s Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative. Obama entered the lecture hall at Taylor\u2019s University to huge applause. He made some opening remarks, then charmed his audience in an extended Q&A session. But those of us watching from the press section became distracted by news coming across our phones about a new jihadist attack, this one in Mali. Obama, busily mesmerizing adoring Asian entrepreneurs, had no idea. Only when he got into his limousine with Susan Rice did he get the news. Later that evening, I visited the president in his suite at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in downtown Kuala Lumpur. The streets around the hotel had been sealed. Armored vehicles ringed the building; the lobby was filled with swat teams. I took the elevator to a floor crowded with Secret Service agents, who pointed me to a staircase; the elevator to Obama\u2019s floor was disabled for security reasons. Up two flights, to a hallway with more agents. A moment\u2019s wait, and then Obama opened the door. His two-story suite was outlandish: Tara-like drapes, overstuffed couches. It was enormous and lonely and claustrophobic all at once. \u201cIt\u2019s like the Hearst Castle,\u201d I observed. \u201cWell, it\u2019s a long way from the Hampton Inn in Des Moines,\u201d Obama said. ESPN was playing in the background. When we sat down, I pointed out to the president a central challenge of his pivot to Asia. Earlier in the day, at the moment he was trying to inspire a group of gifted and eager hijab-wearing Indonesian entrepreneurs and Burmese innovators, attention was diverted by the latest Islamist terror attack. A writer at heart, he had a suggestion: \u201cIt\u2019s probably a pretty easy way to start the story,\u201d he said, referring to this article. Possibly, I said, but it\u2019s kind of a cheap trick. \u201cIt\u2019s cheap, but it works,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking to these kids, and then there\u2019s this attack going on.\u201d The split-screen quality of the day prompted a conversation about two recent meetings he\u2019d held, one that generated major international controversy and headlines, and one that did not. The one that drew so much attention, I suggested, would ultimately be judged less consequential. This was the Gulf summit in May of 2015 at Camp David, meant to mollify a crowd of visiting sheikhs and princes who feared the impending Iran deal. The other meeting took place two months later, in the Oval Office, between Obama and the general secretary of the Vietnamese Communist Party, Nguyen Phu Trong. This meeting took place only because John Kerry had pushed the White House to violate protocol, since the general secretary was not a head of state. But the goals trumped decorum: Obama wanted to lobby the Vietnamese on the Trans-Pacific Partnership\u2014his negotiators soon extracted a promise from the Vietnamese that they would legalize independent labor unions\u2014and he wanted to deepen cooperation on strategic issues. Administration officials have repeatedly hinted to me that Vietnam may one day soon host a permanent U.S. military presence, to check the ambitions of the country it now fears most, China. The U.S. Navy\u2019s return to Cam Ranh Bay would count as one of the more improbable developments in recent American history. \u201cWe just moved the Vietnamese Communist Party to recognize labor rights in a way that we could never do by bullying them or scaring them,\u201d Obama told me, calling this a key victory in his campaign to replace stick-waving with diplomatic persuasion. I noted that the 200 or so young Southeast Asians in the room earlier that day\u2014including citizens of Communist-ruled countries\u2014seemed to love America. \u201cThey do,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIn Vietnam right now, America polls at 80 percent.\u201d", "description": "The U.S. president talks through his hardest decisions about America\u2019s role in the world.", "authors": ["Jeffrey Goldberg"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/2016/03/WEL_Goldberg_Obama_OPENER/facebook.jpg?1522796014", "published_at": "2016-03-10"}
