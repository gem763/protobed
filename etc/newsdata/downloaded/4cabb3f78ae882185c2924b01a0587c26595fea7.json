But it was worth it to celebrate a strike that took Crystal Palace into fourth place in the Premier League.\n\nDespite Palace\u2019s lofty league position, manager Roy Hodgson downplayed suggestions so early in the season that they might have designs on a European place. \u201cIts nice to start reasonably well, but you know you\u2019ve got to keep up that pace and one of the things we don\u2019t have is a big squad,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if we can keep our heads above water and get to January I hope we can do something about that.\u201d\n\nWest Ham have been spoken of more widely as potential top-six material and would have gone third had they hung on to the lead given them by Sebastien Haller. \u201cYou need to play in every game,\u201d said manager Manuel Pellegrini. \u201cWe missed a good option to be third but there are plenty more games.\u201d\n\nThis one started slowly, with Palace gradually growing in confidence against a strangely passive home side. But after 28 minutes it was revealed as a cunning plan to lull the visitors into a false sense of security.\n\nA quick forward pass from Mark Noble found Andriy Yarmolenko on the right. He crossed low before Palace could react and Haller met the ball first time eight yards out only for goalkeeper Vicente Guaita to block.", "description": "Jordan Ayew needed two VAR checks to confirm his 87th-minute winner.", "authors": ["Nick Szczepanik", "Daniel Zeqiri", "Live Updates"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/05/TELEMMGLPICT000212118612-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqRmcLc_VwZsc7wOtCMsK22uWrj2JUBO5BDbLvtg0AqJE.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
