They are labelling it a \u201cterrorist attack.\n\nThe obvious worry will be that this is a reprisal by Saudi Arabia following drone and missile attacks a few weeks ago on its own oil processing facility. The truth, of course, maybe far more straightforward than that. The Iranian tanker may well have just had a mechanical mishap causing the explosion rather than the spin put by the Iranian media.\n\nThe former though would represent a very dangerous escalation in the Middle East tensions across the Straits of Hormuz and if so oil prices could be set for a strong up move. At this stage, we will have to wait for more details to emerge.\n\nCrude and WTI spot are one dollar higher at $60.15 and $54.35 a barrel respectively.\n\nOriginal Post", "description": "Commodities Analysis by MarketPulse (Jeffrey Halley) covering: Brent Oil Futures, Crude Oil WTI Futures.
