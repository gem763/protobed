Protesters set fires from cardboard boxes, building barricades with metal fencing.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t leave because there are riot police,\u201d said protesters Oscar, 20, in Causeway Bay. \u201cThey fired tear gas from the station. We are heading to North Point.\u201d\n\nNorth Point is east of Causeway Bay.\n\nThousands of protesters earlier sang the Star Spangled Banner and called on U.S. President Donald Trump to \u201cliberate\u201d the city. They waved the Stars and Stripes and placards demanding democracy.\n\n\u201cFight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong,\u201d they shouted before handing over petitions at the U.S. Consulate. \u201cResist Beijing, liberate Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper on Saturday urged China to exercise restraint in Hong Kong, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997.\n\nEsper made his call in Paris as police in Hong Kong prevented protesters from blocking access to the airport but fired tear gas for a second night running in the densely populated district of Mong Kok.\n\nLast month Trump suggested China should \u201chumanely\u201d settle the problem in Hong Kong before a trade deal is reached with Washington. Earlier Trump called the protests \u201criots\u201d that were a matter for China to deal with.\n\nThe vandalism started in the evening. Police have responded to violence over 14 weeks with water cannon, rubber bullets and tear gas.\n\nProtesters hold up five fingers and a U.S. flag during a rally to the U.S. Consulate General in Hong Kong, China September 8, 2019.

Many Hong Kong residents fear Beijing is eroding that autonomy.\n\n\u201cFOMENTING UNREST\u201d\n\nChina denies the accusation of meddling and says Hong Kong is an internal affair. It has denounced the protests, accusing the United States and Britain of fomenting unrest, and warned of the damage to the economy.\n\nHong Kong leader Carrie Lam announced concessions this week aimed at ending the protests, including formally scrapping a hugely unpopular extradition bill, which ignited the unrest in June. Many protesters said it was too little, too late.\n\nThe bill would have allowed the extradition of people to mainland China to stand trial in courts controlled by the Communist Party. Hong Kong has an independent judiciary dating back to British rule.\n\nBut the demonstrations have long since broadened into calls for democracy.\n\nU.S. legislation addressing China\u2019s actions in Hong Kong will be among the top priorities pushed by Senate Democrats when Congress returns to work after a recess next week, their leader, Senator Chuck Schumer, said on Thursday.\n\nSchumer urged Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican who sets the floor agenda, to bring up a bipartisan bill that would require an annual justification of the special treatment afforded by Washington to Hong Kong, including special trade and business privileges, under the U.S. Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992.\n\nThe legislation, called the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, would also mandate that officials in China and Hong Kong who have undermined the city\u2019s autonomy are vulnerable to sanctions.\n\nProtesters, in a petition handed to the U.S. Consulate, urged that it be passed in full.\n\nJoshua Wong, one of the leaders of the pro-democracy \u201cUmbrella\u201d movement five years ago, was re-arrested at the airport on Sunday on return from Germany and the United States for breaching bail conditions, he said.\n\nSlideshow (9 Images)\n\nHe had been charged with inciting and participating in an unauthorised assembly outside police headquarters on June 21 and released on bail.\n\n\u201cPreliminary legal advice suggested that the court had acknowledged and approved my trips to Germany and the U.S. when it granted bail on Aug. 30,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cTherefore, it is believed that there are some mistakes have been made on the bail certificate.\u201d\n\nHe said he thought he would be freed on Monday.", "description": "Hong Kong police fired tear gas to disperse protesters in the upmarket Causeway Bay shopping district on Sunday, after demonstrators had rallied at the U.S. Consulate calling for help in bringing democracy to the Chinese-ruled city.", "authors": ["Sumeet Chatterjee", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190908&t=2&i=1427567389&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF870E3", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
