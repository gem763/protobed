I\u2019m not gonna lie there were moments where you read these headlines and what I wanted to do was take the book back and hide in a cave.\u2019\n\nNadiya said her novel was for \u201914-year-old me\u2019 and also dedicated it to people \u2018who are finding their voice and who feel like they are not represented.\u2019\n\nThe 34-year-old went on: \u2018I look at this platform that I\u2019ve been given. I love cooking, I love baking, I love writing my cook books but this gives me the opportunity to say we all have a voice. Whether it\u2019s at the tip of our tongue or stuck somewhere in here, we have an opportunity to say something.\n\n\u2018I feel like if I didn\u2019t write this book and I didn\u2019t write these stories, I\u2019d be part of a bigger problem not a solution and I think it\u2019s very important to speak.\u2019\n\nNadiya hopes her book Finding My Voice will help others going through a tough time (Picture: ITV/REX)\n\nNadiya also had to endure bullying at school, and at one point she considered taking her own life as a \u2018bus ticket\u2019 away from misery.\n\nThe star attempted to overdose on tablets but was interrupted by the news that her mother was pregnant with her brother. She then decided to live on for her brother.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNadiya had kept what happened to her to herself, admitting she only recently told her sister.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve only told my sisters recently and, growing up, I had a close friend at school who I told. It turned out a very similar thing had happened to her.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s important to talk about it because it probably happens much more than we care to talk about.\u2019\n\nLorraine airs weekdays from 8.30am on ITV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
