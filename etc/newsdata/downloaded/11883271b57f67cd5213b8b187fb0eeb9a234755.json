If that happens over a period of time the bank is picking up on it.'\n\nMr Foster-Ramsay said the issue could be particularly troublesome for young people who go to the pub with their friends and repay each other with dubious payment references.\n\n'Bank statements are a legal document - you have to be semi-serious about it. As fun as it may be it's not advisable to be creative in the transfer text,' he said.\n\n40Forty Finance director Will Unkles said while creative payment references may not ultimately stop a home loan application in its tracks, it could delay the process.\n\nHe said banks often would require clients to sign a legally-binding statutory declaration explaining what the payments actually meant.\n\nThe experts' word of warning comes after Finder's insights manager Graham Cooke told Daily Mail Australia excessive spending on Uber Eats could potentially make it harder for a first-time home buyer to secure a mortgage.\n\nWhile labelling transfers 'for the pingers' or 'sex please' may seem funny at the time, the finance broker said doing so could give home lenders the wrong impression (stock image)\n\n'We do definitely expect banks to be paying more attention to the detail of people's everyday spending,' Finder's insights manager Graham Cooke said.\n\n'It's not so much that Uber Eats specifically is going to be a red flag but if you combine a lot of outgoing spending with stuff like gambling, all of them collectively, potentially, make banks slightly more cautious.\n\nWhile home loans were approved in just a fortnight back in 2017, lenders are now taking their time, pushing wait times for approval out to two months.\n\nThe federal government is also considering allowing banks to more easily access information on an individual's spending habits, after a Treasury report explored giving banks a greater ability to judge a potential borrower's credit risk.", "description": "While labelling transfers 'for the pingers' or 'sex please' may seem funny at the time, a finance broker has warned tongue-in-cheek transaction text could give lenders the wrong impression.", "authors": ["Charlie Co\u00eb", "Stephen Johnson For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/07/19285834-0-image-a-40_1570170895469.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
