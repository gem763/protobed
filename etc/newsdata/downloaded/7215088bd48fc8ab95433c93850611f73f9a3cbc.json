Conor has a win over Poirier at featherweight.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I also don\u2019t feel Poirier was the best version of himself at featherweight. I feel he\u2019s a better fighter at lightweight.\n\n\u2018Conor getting another win over Poirier at lightweight is impressive and would line him up as No.1 contender, if not a title shot.\n\n\u2018Cowboy is another good win floating around because you can validate any fighter with a win over Cowboy.\n\n\u2018Conor\u2019s been out for a while so Cowboy might be a good reintroduction to the division.\u2019\n\nAnother name mentioned for McGregor is featherweight veteran Frankie Edgar, but Hardy dismissed the prospect of that clash, saying: \u2018There\u2019s so little to be gained from beating Edgar, rather than getting a run out.\u2019\n\nGaethje would love to fight McGregor (Picture: Getty)\n\nWhile Poirier has been pushing hard for a rematch with McGregor, Gaethje recently launched a campaign to convince the UFC he is the right opponent.\n\nGaethje insists he has done everything possible to get the nod, but Hardy insisted McGregor should avoid that match-up.\n\n\u2018Gaethje is a horrible fight for anyone in this division. If I\u2019m Conor I\u2019m going for Poirier or Cowboy,\u2019 he said.\n\nPoirier was beaten by McGregor at featherweight (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t mind the Gaethje fight. I just think that\u2019s a more risky fight for Conor to take. Gaethje is a different animal since his last couple of losses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018He\u2019s picking his shots and not taking as much risks. He\u2019s got a great wrestling game too.\n\n\u2018Conor will feel more comfortable up against Poirier\u2019s wrestling as he would be against Gaethje\u2019s. Gaethje is a much riskier fight for Conor than anybody else, including Khabib.\n\n\u2018I feel he\u2019s got a good read on Khabib now so he\u2019ll have a better chance of beating Khabib than Gaethje.\u2019", "description": "Dan Hardy has urged Conor McGregor to stay away from Justin Gaethje and fight Dustin Poirier on his return to the UFC.
