Referring to the Der Spiegal magazine reports, Germany\u2019s justice minister said the Cold-War-style methods required a full inquiry. France has said, if confirmed, the news is \u201ccompletely unacceptable.\u201d\n\nDemanding answers from the US, the EU got the response that America was checking the \u201caccuracy of the information\u201d and would \u201cget back to them.\u201d\n\nEuropean Parliament President Martin Schulz said he was shocked by the news.\n\n\u201cIf it is true why does the United States treat us how they would treat a hostile power? Do democracies need to spy on each other? I will ask the US ambassador for explanations,\u201d declared Schulz.\n\nThe EU-US trade agreement, which would create the world\u2019s largest free trade area, hang in the balance. Some have called for talks to be put on ice.\n\nLuxembourg\u2019s Foreign Minister, Jean Asselborn said:\n\n\u201cIt is absolutely unacceptable that fundamental liberties are affected and therefore I believe we immediately need to establish trust at the highest level of European Union and United States.\u201d\n\nAmerica has previously defended the National Security Agency\u2019s actions as essential in the fight against terrorism. Some in the EU feel that spying on political institutions crosses the line.", "description": "European countries are lining up to condemn allegations of US spying on the EU.
