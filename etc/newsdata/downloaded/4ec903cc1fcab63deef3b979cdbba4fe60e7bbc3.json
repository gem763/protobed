Unlike Bitcoin though, I believe that this market is going to continue to find plenty of upward pressure but a pullback is desperately needed. Simply put, markets cannot go in one direction forever. Yes, the next several days could see this market make a serious attempt to break above the $20.00 level, but at this point it\u2019s much more prudent to look for some type of value in this market.\n\nSILVER Video 05.09.19\n\nAfter all, there is a gap down at the $17.50 level that would make a perfect buying opportunity if we go back down there to fill it. Typically we will fill gaps in the futures market, so I think it\u2019s only a matter time before we get some type of significant rollover. I also recognize that the $18.50 level could create a bit of a bounce but as for Silver right now, you are either long of this market or you are on the sidelines. Anything else would be reckless at this juncture. If you are long of this market, then there\u2019s no reason to get out, because quite frankly the market can become over exuberant for some time, but you may wish to take some of your profits at these lofty levels. Clearly, if you have been buying silver on the way up and are still involved, you cannot take a loss at this point.\n\nPlease let us know what you think in the comments below\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n\nMore From FXEMPIRE:", "description": "Silver markets initially rallied during the trading session on Wednesday but continue to find it a bit difficult to go higher from here.
