And then Nats Manager Dave Martinez got ejected during the seventh-inning stretch for continuing his debate with the umpires.\n\nWe should have seen it coming: Right as the game was starting, The Post\u2019s Thomas Boswell \u2014 who has seen some stuff in his decades as a baseball scribe \u2014 reminded us of all the wild, wacky things that have happened during World Series Game 6s.\n\nHistorically, Game Six has produced some of the greatest World Series games ever played. '11 (St. L 10, Tex 9, 11 IP. '02 Angel comeback. '91: Kirby Puckett Game. '86: Bill Buckner. '85: Ump Don Denkinger. '77: Reggie 3 HR. '75: Fisk. On and on. \"Play ball.\" \u2014 Thomas Boswell (@ThomasBoswellWP) October 30, 2019\n\nRearranging the order a bit, let\u2019s run down Boz\u2019s list, shall we?\n\n1986: Bill Buckner\n\nAfter a 10-pitch at-bat that already saw the Mets tie the score on a Bob Stanley wild pitch, Mookie Wilson\u2019s dribbler in the bottom of the 10th somehow found daylight between Bill Buckner\u2019s glove and the dirt, allowing Ray Knight to score and giving New York an improbable win. The Mets won Game 7, too. And the Red Sox\u2019 October woes would continue for nearly another two decades.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n1985: Don Denkinger\u2019s bad call\n\nOne year earlier, the Cardinals were three outs away from their 10th World Series title before Denkinger\u2019s clearly incorrect call at first led to a cascade of misfortune for the Redbirds. After Jorge Orta \u201cbeat\u201d the throw to first, Jack Clark dropped a pop fly in foul territory, Steve Balboni singled, Darrell Porter allowed a passed ball and Dane Iorg\u2019s single provided the winning runs in a 2-1 Royals win. The next night, the Cardinals would come completely unraveled with Denkinger working home plate: He ejected Manager Whitey Herzog and pitcher Joaquin Andujar, though it hardly mattered in a game St. Louis lost, 11-0.\n\n1977: Three pitches, three home runs\n\nAD\n\nReggie Jackson\u2019s first at-bat in 1977 Game 6 against the Dodgers ended in a four-pitch walk. He would see three pitches total over his next three trips to the plate, each of them resulting in a home run and earning him the eventual nickname \u201cMr. October.\u201d (He also had homered on the first pitch of his final at-bat in Game 5, meaning he hit a home run on four consecutive strikes pitched to him.) The Yankees won the series in six games.\n\nAD\n\n1975: Carlton Fisk waves it fair\n\nFisk hand-waved the ball into the Fenway Park foul pole in the 12th inning against the Reds, a pantomime memorably captured by a camera NBC had installed inside the Green Monster in left field. (Whether cameraman Lou Gerard stayed on Fisk instead of following the ball because he was frozen in fear of a Fenway Park rat remains a matter of debate.) The Red Sox, though, would go on to lose Game 7.\n\nAD\n\n1991: Kirby Puckett and \u2018we\u2019ll see you tomorrow night\u2019\n\nBefore leading off the 11th inning against the Braves, Puckett told teammate Chili Davis that he planned to bunt his way on base, to which Davis replied: \u201cBunt? Bunt my you know what. Get up there, get a good change-up, a hanging change-up and hit it out. Let\u2019s go home.\u201d And on a night in which Puckett also finished a double shy of the cycle and drove in three runs, he did as his teammate asked, prompting CBS announcer Joe Buck\u2019s memorable call of \u201cand we\u2019ll see you tomorrow night.\u201d The Twins one again in Game 7, again in extra innings.\n\nAD\n\n2011: Cardinals come back again and again and again and again and again\n\nAD\n\nThe Cardinals erased a Rangers lead in the first inning, and in the third inning, and in the sixth inning. Then, trailing by two in the bottom of the ninth and down to their final strike, the Cardinals\u2019 David Freese tripled to send the game into extra innings. Naturally, Texas scored two in the top of the 10th and again was one strike away from its first World Series title, but naturally, the Cardinals again tied the score on Lance Berkman\u2019s single. Freese would then end it in the 11th with a solo homer, and the Cardinals would win it all the next night. It was the first time in World Series history that a team came back from two different two-run deficits in the ninth inning or later in the same game.\n\n2002: Angels\u2019 historic comeback\n\nAD\n\nDown 5-0, the Angels got three back on a Scott Spiezio home run in the bottom of the seventh and then manufactured three more in the bottom of the eighth, the last two off Giants closer Robb Nen, who had the most saves in all of baseball from 2000 to 2002. The five-run comeback was the largest in a World Series elimination game, and the Angels would cruise to their first World Series title the next night.\n\nAD\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Game 7 gets all the love, but Game 6 is where it's at.", "authors": ["Matt Bonesteel", "Reporter For The Early Lead"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/AlxR1YYNGqx5_0J5BaC8P2b2AWQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/S2RB5VH2YAI6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
