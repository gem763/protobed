For many swimmers, the view is that it is long overdue.\n\nTaking the form of a fast-paced, team-competition over short-course metres, the league, bankrolled by billionaire businessman Konstantin Grigorishin, offers them the chance to compete regularly outside of the Olympic Games, as well as receive healthy financial incentives and year-round recognition.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a great opportunity for the next generation of swimmers, both financially and competitively - it provides racing opportunities that are not otherwise there,\u201d says Coughlin.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"I think a lot of people have thought about it and have attempted to try it previously. The ISL and Konstantin, they are really the first ones to make it a reality. It\u2019s really exciting.\"\n\nFour mixed gender teams apiece from the US and Europe will meet in a series of competitions across the two continents, culminating in a grand final in Las Vegas in December for the top four clubs to accumulate the most points. ISL organisers claim 75 per cent of swimmers taking part are Olympians and world record holders, with Adam Peaty, Ben Proud and Hannah Miley among those flying the flag for Britain and 13-time world champion Caeleb Dressel, South Africa\u2019s four-time Olympic medallist Chad le Clos and five-time Olympic champion Katie Ledecky just some of the other global names.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really incredible how nearly every great swimmer in the world has signed up to the do it. It\u2019s amazing that in an Olympic year, all these people are supporting it,\" she continues.\n\n\"There is a hunger to watch people compete outside of the Olympics. I\u2019ve seen that. I\u2019ve seen how spectators really get into it. It doesn\u2019t matter that it\u2019s not the Olympic Games, you get to see the best in the world race at a great event.\"\n\nCoughlin is not the only swimmer to have been tempted back into competitive action, for example France\u2019s London 2012 50m freestyle champion Florent Manaudou announced he was ending his two-year hiatus and joined the ISL\u2019s Energy Standard team.\n\nCoughlin is attached to American side DC Trident, although she had a little more to consider when contemplating a return, most notably the fact she had become a mother to daughter Zennie last October.\n\nShe had purposely never announced she was \u2018retired\u2019 from the sport but priorities had changed since last racing in the 2016 US Olympic trials, motherhood included but also other career interests such as a cookbook and winery. So when former teammate Kaitlin Sandeno, general manager of DC Trident, got in contact earlier this year, an immediate green light was not forthcoming.\n\n\u201cShe asked if I would be interested in the ISL, I said no, I haven\u2019t been swimming much and I really didn\u2019t have much interest,\u201d she explains.\n\n\u201cAnd she was like \u2018its only for 50m and it would be short course\u2019. That was enough to plant the seed in my brain and about three days later I accepted it.\n\n\u201cI thought it would be a really good motivator to get back into shape after having a baby. I\u2019m the sort of person who needs to be held accountable and I need something hanging over my head to be motivated.\n\n\u201cI miss having a purpose when I go to the gym and when I swim in the pool. I miss having something to train for.\"\n\nUnderstandably for someone who was a little over five months into motherhood when the ISL call came in, getting race ready took time and patience.\n\nCoughlin, who is the joint most decorated female American Olympic swimmer ever, ran and hiked throughout her pregnancy and discovered her stroke rate and strength was in relative shape upon her return to the pool - although some things took a little longer to regain.\n\nCoughlin after winning the women's 100m backstroke final at the 2004 Olympics Credit: AFP\n\n\"After having the baby, the hardest part was my abs going back together. A lot of people don\u2019t realise but when you have a baby, your abs completely split down the middle,\" she says.\n\n\"I didn\u2019t even do underwater dolphin kicks until late in the summer. I didn\u2019t want to damage my body. It\u2019s been really fun. But it\u2019s been challenging. Before swimming was the number one priority and now it\u2019s kind of on the back burner.\u201d\n\nThe latest fine-tuning has involved reacquainting herself with going off starting blocks and she believes she will be feeling a combination of nerves and excitement when she makes her return over the coming days.\n\nWith 12 Olympic medals, the most by any American woman in sport, and 20 World Championships medals, the most ever by a female swimmer, she will certainly not be able to slip quietly back into the water, however low her performance expectations are.\n\nOne of the aims of the ISL is to take swimming to an even wider audience and create more household names within the sport - broadcast deals in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Latin America and Europe helping to project that target.\n\nWith a total of 60 medals in major international competition, Coughlin was rightly a star in her own right at her peak. But does she believe her achievements garnered enough recognition at the time, especially when compared to the relative increased attention towards sportswomen since she left the sport?\n\n\"I definitely think so (in answer to recognition)\" she says before elaborating further: \"I had wonderful companies that I worked with and sponsors and USA Swimming supported me and the media supported me. I got a lot of great support.\n\n\"It was just the fact that the greatest Olympian of all time, Michael Phelps, happened to be swimming next to me at the same. The greatest swimmer in history, the greatest Olympian in history, was my teammate for all those years. He obviously got very deserved attention that was well earned.\n\n\"I personally would never have been able to handle the amount of attention that he received.\"", "description": "If\u00a0there is an element of the unknown this weekend for Natalie Coughlin when she races competitively in a pool for the first time in over three years, then of one thing the 12-time Olympic medallist - to women's swimming in the 2000s what Michael Phelps was to men's - is more than certain about", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/JBYHeuTAvsiDJ68YZHzcKA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/u3pDHjhdM8JIB31lyRzXbA--~B/aD0xMTEzO3c9MTc4MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/9b8c93120918a55eb60246f03b1f11e7", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
