Her book, Rectify: The Power of Restorative Justice After Wrongful Conviction, was published in October.\n\nLast September, the country was torn apart by decades-old allegations of sexual assault against Brett Kavanaugh as he headed into his Supreme Court confirmation hearing. Now, the recent frenzy around the possible impeachment of Donald Trump and the whistleblower report that started it has prompted the same kinds of questions. Which stories and which storytellers should we believe in our hyper-partisan era?\n\nTwo recent books have taken us right back to where we were a year ago. The Education of Brett Kavanaugh, by New York Times reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, was published earlier this month to great anticipation. It promised to excavate what last year\u2019s allegations of Kavanaugh\u2019s sexual misconduct in high school and college\u2014followed by a contentious Supreme Court confirmation hearing\u2014could not. Pogrebin and Kelly said their mission was to give context for who Justice Kavanaugh is \u201cas a person,\u201d and dig into \u201cthe man who is portrayed in these starkly polarized ways.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe co-author of another book on Kavanaugh, Fox News commentator Mollie Z. Hemingway, immediately went to war on Twitter over Pogrebin and Kelly\u2019s characterizations of Kavanaugh.\n\nJustice on Trial, Hemingway\u2019s book, co-authored with attorney Carrie Severino, was published earlier this year. It, too, rakes over the September 2018 confirmation hearings that transfixed and splintered the country. It\u2019s a different kind of book: The authors are much closer to the world of conservative activism than a news outlet like the New York Times, and the authors make no secret of their right-of-center bona fides. Still, they spoke with more than 100 people, including President Donald Trump, several Supreme Court justices, numerous senators and high-level government officials, and family and close friends of Kavanaugh.\n\nBoth books purport to be deep dives into the murk, and promise new revelations and evidence-backed conclusions in the longstanding debate over whether Kavanaugh sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford in high school and exposed himself to Deborah Ramirez in college.\n\nAs a criminal defense lawyer, law professor and a woman who grew up in the 1980s and 90s, I am in many respects the target audience. In high school and college, I had to fend off aggressive unwanted sexual advances from male classmates. As an attorney, I have also defended young men accused of sexual assault who refused favorable pleas or other settlements because they insisted that they were innocent and wanted their names cleared. I watched every minute of the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings. I cried afterwards, in rage and despair at the way that Dr. Ford had been treated, at Kavanaugh\u2019s belligerent, conspiracy theory-riven response to her wrenching testimony and at the process itself, which was so thoroughly partisan, undignified and inept as to obscure the truth rather than bring it to light. I walked away believing what I thought already: that Kavanaugh did not belong on the Supreme Court. But now, my objections weren\u2019t about his ideology; they were about his lack of judicial temperament and what I believed to be credible allegations of sexual assault.\n\nOne year later, I decided to test myself and my biases. I read both books determined to keep an open mind. My goal was to keep my lawyer\u2019s hat on: skeptical and exacting as I assessed the strengths and weaknesses of the case. I thought seeing the story from two different sides would offer a fuller picture of Kavanaugh and help me come to a determination of whom to believe. I didn\u2019t get that. What I got instead was an understanding of how Kavanaugh has become two different people for two different groups in America, and how the truth, about Kavanaugh and so much else, has become almost entirely subjective in our current political era.\n\nThe pictures that emerge of young Kavanaugh are built from the same set of facts about his life, but with emphases and exaggerations that create two different portraits, like two different composite sketches drawn from the same description of features. Where one pair of authors saw a teenager with a problematic drinking habit verging on alcoholism, another saw a normal adolescent boy with a robust social life that usually included drinking beer, as it does for most American teenagers and college students. One book portrays him as a wholesome, academically gifted teenager who \u201cwas preoccupied with colleges, basketball camp, going to the beach with friends, and visiting his \u2018Gramy\u2019 in Connecticut.\u201d The other admits that he excelled at sports and had sterling grades, but questions whether his wealthy, entitled, all-boys school \u201cbecame a breeding ground in the early 1980s for a casual brand of misogyny\u201d in which he willingly participated.\n\nReading both books in the same week felt like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again, and I started to despair that in an era when old acquaintances and hazy memories are a Google search away for any interested party to look up, that wealth of information served only to provide more fodder for questionable theories that lead to convenient conclusions. Each book reminded me of just how malleable the truth can be.\n\n***\n\nPogrebin and Kelly promise an objective and dispassionate investigation into Ford and Ramirez\u2019s allegations. But that promise is difficult to accept: Kelly went to an elite all-girls\u2019 private school \u201cin the same network\u201d as Georgetown Prep, where Kavanaugh was a student when the alleged assault against Ford took place. Pogrebin states that she \u201cwas in Kavanaugh\u2019s class at Yale, just a few doors away from him in the freshman dorm\u201d\u2014the year that Ramirez claims Kavanaugh pushed his penis in her face during a party. Pogebrin was friendly with some of the key players; presumably, she formed opinions about them over the years .\n\nWhile the authors tell the story as an \u201con the one hand, on the other hand\u201d narrative, their intimacy with some of the people involved can be disconcerting. Take, for example, their examination of text messages exchanged last year between Yalies Kathleen Charlton and David Todd about their classmate Kavanaugh. The reader is told that Charlton interpreted Todd\u2019s texts and comments to her in a phone call to mean that Kavanaugh had pressured him \u201cnot to speak ill of Brett\u2019s history\u201d when New Yorker reporters came calling about Ramirez during the confirmation process. But the texts themselves don\u2019t actually say that, and Todd\u2019s version of events is not included because he declined to speak to Pogrebin and Kelly. What the authors do disclose is that Charlton was Pogrebin\u2019s Yale roommate. Kavanaugh doesn\u2019t come off well in this anecdote, but the story we\u2019re getting is, at best very incomplete and, at worst, coming from a biased source\u2014the one more willing to speak to the New York Times reporters. (Kavanaugh himself declined to speak with the authors, who recently told a Washington audience that he was willing to do so only if they wrote in the book that they hadn\u2019t spoken with him.)\n\nPogrebin and Kelly are sympathetic to Ramirez, describing her as a fish out of water at Yale, where her strict Catholicism, middle-class background and ethnic heritage made her an easy target for male classmates who wanted to get her drunk and humiliate her. Whether Kavanaugh was one of those classmates is a key question: Did he, as she says, shove his penis in her face when they were both drunk at a keg party during their freshman year? The question is difficult to resolve because there is no eyewitness corroboration provided in the book, only classmates who say that other classmates\u2014who were not themselves present\u2014told them about it afterwards. There are a number of these accounts\u2014stories of the event from people who were not there but who heard about it from someone else\u2014which vary in their level of detail and specificity, but nonetheless form the basis for the authors\u2019 conclusion that Kavanaugh \u201cmistreated\u201d Ramirez.\n\nPogrebin and Kelly\u2019s characterizations of other players, particularly those who declined to speak with them for the book, is troubling. They describe how Ramirez reached out to a number of friends in the fall of 2018, including Karen Yarasavage, who included Ramirez as a bridesmaid at her wedding and made her the godmother of one of her daughters, to see if they could back up her account. The authors note that Ramirez declined to share the names of Yarasavage and others with the New Yorker to protect their privacy. Then they write: \u201cThat loyalty wasn\u2019t reciprocated by Yarasavage\u2014or a number of others.\u201d What follows immediately afterward is a description of Yarasavage\u2019s signing of a statement to the New Yorker along with five classmates, including two of the three witnesses that Ramirez had said were present during Kavanaugh\u2019s assault. The statement read, in part: \u201cWe can say with confidence that if the incident that Debbie alleges ever occurred, we would have seen or heard about it\u2014and we did not.\u201d Why this public statement is \u201cdisloyal\u201d is not explained. Did the authors believe Ramirez\u2019s friends and classmates should have remained silent about what they knew and believed to be true because they were contradicting her? Nor is the statement reconciled with the authors\u2019 conclusion that the alleged incident was \u201cthe talk of campus.\u201d\n\nThe fact that Pogrebin and Kelly didn\u2019t interview Kavanaugh leaves them to speculate about his feelings and motivations. And speculate they do, to a discomfiting degree. After a detailed description of his alleged penis thrust, they write, \u201cIndeed, to Kavanaugh himself, it may well have been just a little harmless, drunken fun. But to Ramirez, it was devasting, affirming \u2026 that she wasn\u2019t smart enough, pretty enough, rich enough, savvy enough, tough enough to belong there.\u201d (When a similarly worded tweet, reportedly authored by Pogrebin went out on the Times opinion section\u2019s Twitter account to promote an excerpt of the book, uproar ensued, and the Times quickly deleted it, apologizing for the \u201cclearly inappropriate and offensive\u201d content.)\n\nAnother breach of readers\u2019 trust occurred after the Times ran the excerpt in the Sunday Review section on September 14. The excerpt included a purported scoop: According to Yale classmate Max Stier, Kavanaugh had also \u201cpushed his penis into the hand\u201d of yet another female student. Left out of the story, though, was a salient fact: The alleged second victim, who declined to speak to authors, had no memory of the incident, according to her friends. That information turned the scoop into a dud. Questioned publicly about this omission, Pogrebin and Kelly insisted it was unintentional. They also pointed out, rightly, that they did include the information in the book. But the way the authors chose to speak publicly about it is troubling. Before the error was revealed and corrected, radio host Terry Gross had asked Pogrebin and Kelly on NPR\u2019s Fresh Air whether \u201cany other women had come forward,\u201d and they responded by repeating the Stier story and once again leaving out that the alleged victim would not corroborate it.\n\nIn addition to these missteps, the authors also lack access to key sources beyond Ford, Ramirez and Ford\u2019s friend Leland Keyser, who initially said she believed Ford but told the authors when they interviewed her that, \u201cI just really don\u2019t have confidence in the story\u201d and \u201cit just doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d These shortcomings, in addition to the authors\u2019 failure to uncover any new substantive information, undermines confidence in their ultimate conclusions \u201cthat Ford and Ramirez were mistreated by Kavanaugh as a teenager, and that Kavanaugh over the next thirty-five years became a better person.\u201d On this latter point, they cite the numerous men and women across the ideological spectrum who have come forward to support him and praise his decency and integrity.\n\nWhat we do know is this: Ford and Ramirez\u2019s accusations remain resonant and raw, but also incomplete and uncorroborated by the people they say were there. Kavanaugh\u2019s supporters, including many women, remain unwavering in their praise for his good character over the past 30 years; his detractors remain steadfast in their assertions that he was a boorish drunk who was eminently capable of the misdeeds attributed to him. No other accusers\u2014in this book or anywhere else\u2014have come forward.\n\nOf course, people are a confounding mess of contradictions. It is possible to be badly behaved when drunk and not commit sexual assault. It is possible to be badly behaved when drunk, commit sexual assault and not remember due to alcohol blackout. It is possible to be badly behaved when drunk, commit sexual assault, remember it and lie about it. Nor is the absence of information necessarily evidence. There are many reasons women don\u2019t come forward, perhaps including, in this case, having seen what happened to Ford and Ramirez. But, in the absence of any substantial new information, Pogrebin and Kelly are asking us to take their word for it on their crucial takeaways in sorting through these irreconcilable possibilities.\n\n***\n\nIf you\u2019re predisposed to believe a pair of seasoned New York Times reporters\u2014and I admit I am\u2014that probably also means you\u2019re on the liberal end of the spectrum. The Times, of course, does not consider itself a liberal institution per se, but it has the largest liberal readership of any major newspaper (and Trump\u2019s regular attacks probably aren\u2019t helping its credibility among conservatives).\n\nAnd then there is the wide swath of America more likely to believe Mollie Hemingway and Carrie Severino, who promise in Justice on Trial\u2019s Note to Readers \u201cto produce an objective account that reflects respect for the rule of law and the presumption of innocence.\u201d If Pogrebin and Kelly are compromised in their objectivity, Hemingway and Severino are thoroughly, and by their own admission, in the tank for Kavanaugh. Hemingway, a regular Fox News contributor, has been described by Mediaite writer Colby Hall as \u201ca consistent defender of all things related to President Donald Trump and a frequent critic of those who trespass against him.\u201d Indeed, the book describes Trump\u2019s alleged collusion with Russia as a \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d that \u201cwas eventually debunked with the release of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report.\u201d Many readers might take issue with that interpretation of events. More recently, Hemingway has called the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry over the whistleblower complaint the \u201clatest error filled coup attempt.\u201d\n\nMore problematically, Severino is the chief counsel and policy director for the Judicial Crisis Network, the dark money group that spent $22 million to ensure Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation to the court, $17 million of which came from a single unknown individual. The animating purpose of JCN, in the authors\u2019 own words, is \u201csupporting conservative judicial nominations.\u201d And blocking moderate or liberal ones, too: The group spent $7 million in a successful effort to stop Merrick Garland\u2019s Supreme Court nomination from moving forward during the Obama administration. Severino is also a former law clerk to Justice Clarence Thomas, which might explain why she and Hemingway devote so much of their book to relitigating his 1991 confirmation battle following Anita Hill\u2019s allegations of sexual harassment; repeatedly, the authors proclaim Thomas\u2019 innocence and denounce Hill\u2019s claims as \u201cscurrilous allegations,\u201d made \u201cwithout evidence.\u201d\n\nNo surprise that the authors similarly denounce the allegations against Kavanaugh and the media\u2019s coverage of them as a \u201csmear campaign.\u201d Unlike Pogrebin and Kelly, Hemingway and Severino are unequivocal in their language and conclusions: Ford is a fabulist, and Ramirez is an easily manipulated dupe whose story \u201cnever held together to begin with.\u201d They emphasize Ford\u2019s gaps in memory and lack of corroboration. They follow up with their own smear campaign, writing that \u201c[r]eports poured in\u201d about Ford\u2019s teenage \u201cinteractions with boys and men,\u201d which the media chose to ignore. According to the authors, \u201cmany high school acquaintances of Ford\u2019s revealed unflattering details about her behavior in high school\u2014some of them truly salacious.\u201d The authors provide no details of this purported pile of tales, which they insinuate are related to sexual promiscuity.\n\n(Disclosure: The authors are also critical of my sister, New York Times Magazine staff writer Emily Bazelon, and me. They fault Emily\u2014referred to in their notes as \u201cElizabeth\u201d\u2014for her Times byline in a story about a bar fight Kavanaugh was involved in college, after she had previously expressed negative views about him; they fault me for my Times op-ed deriding Senate Republicans for outsourcing the questioning of Ford to a female prosecutor, questioning my premise that it was \u201cunprecedented,\u201d sexist or otherwise problematic.)\n\nAs to Kavanaugh, they write that his innocence should have been a foregone and obvious conclusion. On September 26, the day before Ford and Kavanaugh testified, the authors report that \u201cthe conversation among senators and staff had shifted from the possibility that Kavanaugh had attempted to rape multiple women to Kavanaugh\u2019s having drunk more beer than most people realized\u201d\u2014in other words, that they had decided there was nothing to the rape allegations. Given the limited scope of the inquiry conducted by Senate staff\u2014they spoke to neither Ford nor Ramirez\u2014and the number of unanswered questions at that stage in the process, it seems doubtful that the majority of these politicians viewed the issue in these stark and simplistic terms. Certainly, the key swing voters did not: Then-Senator Jeff Flake called for an FBI investigation after the hearings, and Senators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski were undecided until October 5, the day before they cast their votes.\n\nThis side-by-side portrayal of Ford and Kavanaugh in Justice on Trial reduces both to caricatures.\n\nAgain, a reader\u2019s willingness to believe this account comes down to whether or not she trusts such statements, which are delivered in this book with little or no sourcing. Pogrebin and Kelly, I should note, are generally more transparent in directing the reader to where their information comes from and acknowledging when key players\u2014and there are many of them\u2014refused their interview requests. (They are not, however, transparent about which players Pogrebin was friends with at Yale other than conceding that one source was her roommate.)\n\nHemingway and Severino do make important points. In particular, they note that the presumption of innocence has fallen by the wayside in the post-#MeToo era, with demands by some activists that every accusation be accepted as true on its face. They quote, chillingly, from an anecdote about a politician on trial before the Emperor Julian in 4th-century Rome. When the man won his case simply by proclaiming his innocence and underscoring the absence of evidence, his accuser responded, \u201cIf it is sufficient to deny, what will become of the guilty?\u201d Replied the Emperor, \u201cIf it suffices to accuse, what will become of the innocent?\u201d\n\nIn this era of so-called cancel culture and ruined lives in the face of unprovable allegations, we should remember that story and the principles it stands for\u2014principles that undergird our entire system of justice. But Hemingway and Severino are not the best choice of messengers.\n\nWith many unanswered questions and hazy memories, who is the perfect messenger to tell this full story? For each of these books, it seems that the most convincing account might come from the storyteller with whom you agree from the outset, not whoever has the strongest and most complete set of facts. We know this, of course, but we might not understand the degree to which these divisions often result in flawed, less-than-rigorous reporting that convinces no one. Even with my own ideological affiliation\u2014a progressive Democrat who believed Ford\u2019s testimony and walked away convinced Kavanaugh was lying in at least some aspects of his testimony\u2014I wasn\u2019t convinced by Pogrebin and Kelly. And while it is true that I was less disposed to believe Hemingway and Severino, their book was so one-sided that it read more like a legal brief written by two very competent and fiercely committed advocates.\n\nI wanted to believe that it was possible to have a probing exploration of a devastating debacle that would leave me more enlightened and satisfied. Instead, I got a master class in just how deeply one\u2019s background and ideology can shape a version of events\u2014that over the course of months-long reporting, even when done in good faith, the facts find a way only to marshal themselves around the hypothesis it seems likely the authors had to begin with. What I have come to view as the outcome-driven reporting in these books only deepens the polarization that tore us all apart one year ago, forcing those same splinters more thoroughly below the surface to embed and fester.", "description": "Reading both books in the same week felt like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again.", "authors": ["Andrew Desiderio", "Lara Bazelon"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/f2/23/12c9f39347b7a55ebced774c2751/190927-bazelon-kavanaugh-ap.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
