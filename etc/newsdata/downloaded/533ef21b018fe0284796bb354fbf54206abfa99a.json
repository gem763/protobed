If this sounds familiar, prep something the night before so you can eat on the go.\n\nCook simple meals from scratch in the microwave , so there\u2019s no need to rely on ready meals.\n\nStock up on seasonings. Herbs and spices are a cheap way to add flavour to meals without resorting to more fat.\n\nUse a non-stick pan \u2013 you\u2019ll need less oil for cooking and it\u2019ll be easier to wash up.\n\nAdd a splash of water rather than more oil to stir-fries once the veggies have cooked a little.\n\nMake your own pasta sauces \u2013 they\u2019ll contain less salt and sugar than shop-bought.\n\nKeep fruit and nuts to hand so you can avoid impluse-buying snacks and 'hanger'.\n\nIf you eat too much saturated fat, swap yoghurt and cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche for low-fat, no-added-sugar versions.
