The credit rating agency cited Ford's \"considerable operating and market challenges.\" Moody's said Ford's restructuring plans are \"expected to extend for several years with $11 billion in charges, and a cash cost of approximately $7 billion.\" Ford, however, \"does have a sound balance sheet and liquidity position from which to operate,\" said Bruce Clark, senior vice president with Moody's.\n\nShares of Mosaic rose 1% after the fertilizer company announced a buyback of up to $250 million.
