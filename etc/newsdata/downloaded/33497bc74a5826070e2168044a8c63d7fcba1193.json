We explain why this is the case. Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\nThere's no wiggle room for McConnell on a Trump impeachment trial, and he seems to know it. Plus it's the least destructive path for him politically.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell once boasted about keeping a Supreme Court seat vacant for more than a year. He said that blocking Judge Merrick Garland\u2019s nomination from even getting a vote was \u201cthe most consequential decision I\u2019ve made in my entire public career.\u201d\n\nMcConnell also calls himself the \u201cgrim reaper\u201d of the raft of legislation passed by the Democratic-led House of Representatives. In the legislative graveyard of his Republican-controlled Senate, McConnell has buried House-passed bills to prevent gun violence, lower prescription drug prices, prevent violence against women and many others.\n\nAs President Donald Trump faces scrutiny in Congress for allegedly attempting to pressure the Ukrainian government for political dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden in exchange for military aid, it's natural to wonder whether McConnell would try to bury impeachment, too.\n\nNo wiggle room for McConnell\n\nSome argue he could simply ignore impeachment, but McConnell himself said Monday that he \u201cwould have no choice but to take it up.\u201d He was notably vague on what exactly that would mean, adding that \u201chow long you're on it is a whole different matter.\u201d But months ago, he said the Senate \"immediately goes into a trial\" if the House approves articles of impeachment.\n\nLet\u2019s be absolutely clear, neither the Constitution nor Senate rules give McConnell any wiggle room to try to \u201cGarland\u201d his way out of this critical process of constitutional accountability.\n\nSenate Majority Leader and President Donald Trump on March 26, 2019.

Sixteen of those impeached individuals received a full Senate trial, while the other three resigned before the Senate trial concluded. Never in that entire time has the Senate understood its power to try impeachments as discretionary. Never.\n\nImpeachment trials are not optional\n\nThink about why that is. Our Constitution does not work \u2014 it simply falls apart \u2014 if this critical power of Congress to check and balance the other branches is discretionary. Acquittal is obviously an option: Seven impeached officials have been, including Presidents Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton.\n\nDereliction of duty, however, is not an option. One half of Congress indicting a sitting president for committing treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors, only to meet silence from the other half \u2014 no trial, no review of the evidence, no vote \u2014 leaves a cloud of illegitimacy hanging not only over the nation\u2019s chief executive, but also over our nation\u2019s founding charter.\n\nLegal jeopardy: Why Trump is increasingly desperate to avoid an impeachment conviction and win in 2020\n\nAs if the text and structure of the Constitution, plus hundreds of years of unbroken historical tradition, weren\u2019t enough, Senate rules require Sen. McConnell to stand aside and allow the prescribed impeachment process in the Senate to commence. The Rules of Procedure and Practice in the Senate When Sitting on Impeachment Trials are explicit and clear about this. The House sends impeachment managers to the Senate, along with the articles. Chief Justice John Roberts would be sworn in to preside, and in turn he would swear in all 100 senators. The process would be underway.\n\nThere is no discretion in the Senate rules, no menu of options for the majority leader to choose from. Now, if McConnell wanted to change the rules, then he\u2019d better buckle up. Any motion he could make to change the rules is likely debatable, requiring 67 votes to pass, which he doesn\u2019t have. Winning would mean not only shielding Trump from an impeachment trial, but also possibly nuking the filibuster for everything else in the Senate(it's now only eliminated for court and executive branch nominations).\n\nThis isn't like blocking Merrick Garland\n\nSuch a vote would be the equivalent of a vote on impeachment anyway. Choosing this bizarre and destructive route doesn\u2019t make sense for someone as calculating as McConnell, especially with the possibility that one of a strong field of Democratic presidential candidates could be driving the national agenda in 2021.\n\nStill, for the sake of argument, let\u2019s nod to the darkest corner of McConnell\u2019s proven cynicism. Could he disregard the Constitution and Senate rules altogether? Could he engage in an act of blatantly anti-constitutional, nihilistic obstruction and refuse to allow any impeachment proceeding whatsoever \u2014 even if, say, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi herself walked the articles of impeachment across the Capitol and banged on the doors of the Senate?\n\nWe already know enough: Donald Trump's call with Ukrainian president drips with impeachable crimes\n\nSure, McConnell could do that. But doing so would mean wrecking the Senate by violating one of its written rules, maybe for the first time in his career. McConnell faced no explicit contrary instruction when he blocked President Barack Obama's Garland nomination to the Supreme Court. This is different, and the majority leader seems to recognize that.\n\nAt the end of the day, both houses of Congress are faced with Benjamin Franklin\u2019s timeless, bracing challenge \u2014 \u201ca republic, if you can keep it.\u201d With the Constitution, the Senate rules, Mitch McConnell\u2019s own self-interest and the raised voices of We the People, we can bear witness to a full Senate trial of President Trump should the House vote to impeach him, and indeed keep our republic for many generations to come.\n\nElizabeth Wydra is president of the Constitutional Accountability Center.
