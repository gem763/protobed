Matt Gaetz (R-FL) and endorsed by House GOP leadership\u2014derailed the closed-door deposition of Laura Cooper, a Pentagon official with jurisdiction over Ukraine policy, before it even started. And it left Democrats indignant that their colleagues had violated long standing rules about interviewing witnesses in classified settings.\n\nCell phones, for example, are not allowed in Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities (also known as SCIFs). But the Republican members who barged into those facilities had taken their phones with them inside the room. Lawmakers and aides said that, as of noon on Wednesday, the SCIF was being swept for electronic surveillance devices because the Republicans brought in their phones, delaying the start of Cooper\u2019s deposition. Democrats were also contemplating whether to bring in the U.S. Capitol Police in order to drag out the protesting members.\n\nThe standoff began shortly after a press conference in the morning, in which GOP members denounced what they called Democrats' \"sham\" impeachment process\u2014a complaint that they\u2019ve made central to their impeachment pushback.\n\nIn a scheme that drew parallels to the infamous Brooks Brother riots that upended the 2000 Florida recount, Gaetz led about 25 House Republican lawmakers into the secure basement SCIF, where bipartisan members of the three committees leading the impeachment inquiry\u2014and only members of those three committees\u2014are allowed to go during the impeachment investigation.\n\nAccording to Democratic lawmakers in the room, the Republicans blew past police officers to enter the room and began shouting once they got there, loudly denouncing the process and impeachment in general.\n\nClose to two hours after they first went in, a core group of Republicans remained there, according to a tweet from Rep. Andy Biggs (R-AZ). The number two House Republican, Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA), was with them. Three hours into the standoff, the Republican crew remained\u2014and they had ordered pizza from We The Pizza, a Capital Hill joint.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re a bunch of brave freedom fighters having pizza in a secure conference room,\u201d complained Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-NJ).\n\nAt one point, a GOP member appeared to broadcast his thoughts from the SCIF via Twitter.\n\nA House aide on the Intelligence committee decried the events as a \"stunt, in service of the President\u2019s demand that they 'fight harder' to obstruct a legitimate impeachment inquiry.\" The aide said that the House Parliamentarian had ruled that these members are in violation of House deposition rules.\n\nGaetz said that the idea to storm the SCIF was not Trump's. But in recent days, allies of the president have grown more notably agitated that congressional Republicans were not doing enough to effectively counter program the impeachment proceedings.\n\nThe White House, likewise, did not comment. Several outlets, however, reported that President Trump was aware of that the members were going to stage their protest. And several of the protesting members did visit the White House the day before to discuss impeachment proceedings.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy\u2019s (R-CA) office confirmed that they were given a heads up and a a spokesman offered a statement in support of the SCIF storming.\n\n\u201cEach member of Congress represents nearly 710,000 Americans,\u201d said Matt Sparks. \u201cIt is their duty and responsibility to see and understand all of the documents that Democrats are referring to in their attempt to remove a duly elected President from office. The current structure is unprecedented, unfair, and undemocratic. Our members are demanding fairness.\u201d\n\nAccording to Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL), Cooper had not yet begun her testimony when the Republicans came in. \u201cLiterally, some of them were just screaming about the president and what we\u2019re doing to him,\u201d she told reporters.\n\nA spokesperson for the House Intelligence Committee declined to comment on what exactly is happening in the SCIF. But a prior Gaetz ploy to enter the secure facility during an impeachment hearing ended with him being kicked out after a House parliamentarian ruled that he had no standing to be there.\n\nHouse Republicans have held\u2014and even supported\u2014the use of closed door hearings for past congressional investigations, including the select committee that they spearheaded to investigate the 2011 consulate attack in Benghazi. That larger inconsistency and the timing on Wednesday\u2019s gambit struck some Democrats as telling about the direction that the impeachment proceeding is heading.\n\n\u201cWhen you don't have the law or the facts, you attack and disrupt the process,\u201d said Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA). \u201cAnd you may wonder why is it happening now? Because Bill Taylor gave a devastating opening statement yesterday. They're freaked out. They're trying to stop this investigation.\u201d", "description": "House GOP leadership and, reportedly, the White House itself were aware of the efforts to disrupt the impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Sam Brodey", "Sam Stein", "Congressional Reporter", "Politics Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571847493/191023-getz-tease_ihmgbb", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
