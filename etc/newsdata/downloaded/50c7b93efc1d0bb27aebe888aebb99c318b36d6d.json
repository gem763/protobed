Then he asked: \u2018What are you doing for the rest of the day?\u2019\n\nBowers, 23 at the time, said he spent the afternoon with the man, who turned out to be Walter Pidgeon, an Oscar-nominated actor. Pidgeon was married, but he spread the word about the obliging Bowers.\n\nSleazy does it: Scotty Bowers with actresses Valerie Vernon (left) and Constance Dowling (right) in the Fifties\n\nOther closeted gay and bisexual actors \u2014 and, according to Bowers, Hollywood was heaving with them \u2014 were soon stopping by for trysts. But he didn\u2019t stop there: Bowers was also able to provide girls for heterosexual stars.\n\nBefore long, he had set up a network of prostitutes. The petrol station was handily near the big studios and he invited clients to use a trailer parked near by.\n\nBowers went on to work as a handyman and as a barman at private parties, but he continued to provide the same service.\n\nThe \u2018male madame to the stars\u2019 has just died, aged 96, in his Los Angeles home, having revealed a lifetime of jaw-dropping debauchery unmatched even in Tinseltown.\n\nThe self-described Hollywood \u2018fixer\u2019 said he arranged and even took part in sexual liaisons involving Laurence Olivier, Katharine Hepburn, Vivien Leigh, Spencer Tracy and Errol Flynn.\n\nOther stars associated with him included Charles Laughton, Rita Hayworth, Mae West, James Dean and Rock Hudson.\n\nIn a 2012 memoir, Full Service, Bowers described his threesomes with actresses Lana Turner and Ava Gardner, and with Cary Grant and another man, as well as actor Randolph Scott and his lover.\n\nSecret trysts: Bowers claimed Katharine Hepburn (pictured) was gay\n\n\u2018The three of us got into a lot of sexual mischief together,\u2019 he wrote of the two matinee idols.\n\nOrgies with the insatiable Cole Porter, giving Vivien Leigh \u2018orgasm after orgasm\u2019, supplying Katharine Hepburn with scores of female lovers \u2014 the inexhaustible Bowers claimed to have done it all.\n\nAlthough he claimed he \u2018preferred the sexual company of women\u2019, he wasn\u2019t picky. He said he\u2019d shared a bed at various times with Vincent Price, Bette Davis, Tyrone Power, Noel Coward and Tennessee Williams.\n\nBowers may have been discreet when his famous clients were alive, but he didn\u2019t hold back once they were gone.\n\nOlivier \u2018secretly harboured a liking for boys\u2019, Bowers claimed, while James Dean was a \u2018prissy little queen\u2019.\n\nThe British writer W. Somerset Maugham liked to watch others having sex \u2018from an armchair, fully dressed in jacket and tie\u2019.\n\nElegant Cecil Beaton would \u2018carefully draw back the bedsheets then neatly and tightly fold the overhang under the mattress, tuck in all loose ends, then straighten out any creases\u2019 before having sex, Bowers said.\n\nHe said Roy Scherer \u2014 later known as Rock Hudson \u2014 worked for him at the petrol station, but also became his lover.\n\nLA\u2019s army of impecunious barmen and waitresses, many of them aspiring actors, meant he had little problem finding willing sex workers.\n\n\u2018I was setting up an average of 15 to 20 tricks a day,\u2019 Bowers claimed in his memoir. \u2018This was a 24/7 operation, extending over 30 to 40 years.\n\n\u2018As for tricks I performed personally, I was often seeing two or three people a day.\u2019\n\nIn detailing homosexual liaisons with the likes of the closeted Rock Hudson, Anthony Perkins and the British film-maker Tony Richardson (the secretly bisexual late husband of Vanessa Redgrave), Bowers may not have surprised Hollywood insiders.\n\nShockingly, however, he \u2018outed\u2019 stars everyone assumed were straight. Spencer Tracy\u2019s famous 26-year romance with Katharine Hepburn was a sham, said Bowers, as both were gay.\n\nAway from the cameras, he claimed, Hepburn dressed as a man and once asked him: \u2018Do you think you could find a nice, young, dark-haired girl for me?\u2019\n\nHe says he found her 150 women over the decades.\n\nHe set up women for Bob Hope, Fifties star William Holden and Desi Arnaz, the Cuban-American actor husband of Lucille Ball. When Ball found out, she punched Bowers in the face at a party, he said.\n\nAlthough Bowers\u2019s services were an open secret in Hollywood, they could be career-killing for the stars, who in those days were bound by studio \u2018morality clauses\u2019.\n\n\u2018There was a big level of secrecy,\u2019 said Bowers, who memorised his clients\u2019 phone numbers rather than risk writing them down.\n\nA question mark still hangs over some of his more shocking claims \u2014 biographers of Spencer Tracy, for instance, never dug up any sexual unorthodoxy.\n\nHowever, others have been able to corroborate some of his assertions (such as Hepburn\u2019s lesbian love life), while a 2018 documentary found Hollywood insiders and former prostitutes who confirmed he certainly had run a male escort service for stars and studio executives.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean, however, that he never gilded the lily.\n\nHe certainly had his detractors \u2014 some dismissed him as a pimp, although he thought of himself as a \u2018gentleman hustler\u2019 and never charged for his services.\n\nBorn George Bowers in 1923 on a farm in Illinois, he was raised by his mother in Chicago after his parents divorced during the Depression. He got the nickname Scotty from a Scottish terrier he liked to take for walks as a boy.\n\nHis licentiousness was rooted in his disturbed childhood. Bowers revealed, apparently with no regret, that he was sexually abused as a child by a male neighbour and willingly sold himself to gay priests in Chicago as a boy.\n\nHe served as a Marine Corps paratrooper in the Pacific during World War II, later moving to California for the sunshine.\n\nHe had a 63-year relationship with a woman, Betty Keller, and married a singer, Lois Broad, in 1984, but she died last year.\n\nHis career as a lover and procurer ended in the mid-Eighties, rendered almost impossible by the Aids epidemic. In later life he became an icon for the gay community, with fans \u2014 among them Stephen Fry \u2014 praising him for connecting lonely gay men in Hollywood.\n\nBowers encouraged this rose-tinted view, insisting he only ever accepted a $20 \u2018tip\u2019 and simply wanted to make people happy.\n\nBowers was horrified when Tennessee Williams turned his life into a short story, complaining: \u2018He made me sound like a mad queen flying over Hollywood Boulevard on a broomstick, directing all the queens in town. It was way over the top.\u2019\n\nComing from Scotty Bowers, that\u2019s saying something.", "description": "Scotty Bowers said his first encounter with Hollywood's secret, seedier side came while he was working as a petrol station attendant one day in 1946.", "authors": ["Tom Leonard For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/21/19965592-0-image-a-13_1571603472987.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
