The couple was seen on Instagram earlier this month\n\nMeghan, who left the Bravo series after its 12th season, added: 'I think that's almost a date for us because we have to talk about us; we have to communicate about things that don't involve' separate issues. She noted that Jim 'going to therapy is huge' for her because she thinks 'a lot of men don't like that.'\n\nJim, who played in the outfield for the Los Angeles Angels and St. Louis Cardinals, confessed to engaging 'in an inappropriate conversation' with a woman other than Meghan to US in June amid 'a lapse in judgment' on his part, adding that 'at no time was there any type of relationship or physical contact.'\n\nMeghan, a St. Louis native, said she and Jim are 'just still working it day-by-day' as they look to square things up in their relationship, in addition to addressing their son Hart's ongoing treatment after he was diagnosed with brain damage.\n\n'I think after such a breach of trust, it's so hard to rebuild from there, especially [with] so many distractions, like our son's health problems and two other little babies, as well,' she said. 'And so to focus on the two of us as a couple, is really hard.'\n\nRebuilding: Meghan, a St. Louis native, said she and Jim are 'just still working it day-by-day' as they look to square things up in their relationship. The family was pictured last month\n\nAdorable: Meghan shares three children with Jim, 49: daughter Aspen, two, and one-year-old twin sons Hayes and Hart.

'I think people can change - and people screw up and people can change.'\n\nMeghan said she owes it to her children to give their father a chance at redemption after his indiscretion (which occurred amid her pregnancy with the twins in the spring of 2018).\n\n'I'm in no way taking responsibility from him or accountability - and if we were just dating, he would be long gone,' she said. 'But we built a life together and there are so many lives that would be affected.\n\n'I'm hurt right now and our life is massively affected, but if we were to split just because of his indiscretion then there's multiple other people who are affected, as well.'", "description": "The St. Louis native said she and Jim are 'just still working it day-by-day' as they look to square things up in their relationship.", "authors": ["Adam S.
