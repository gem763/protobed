But not all such policies were explicitly written down and tracked, giving many female teachers little legal recourse.\n\nCBS News quoted a retired teacher from Ms. Warren\u2019s school, Trudy Randall, who suggested Ms. Warren would have been unwelcome at the school given her pregnancy.\n\n\u201cThe rule was at five months you had to leave when you were pregnant. Now, if you didn\u2019t tell anybody you were pregnant, and they didn\u2019t know, you could fudge it and try to stay on a little bit longer,\u201d Ms. Randall was quoted as saying. \u201cBut they kind of wanted you out if you were pregnant.\u201d\n\nAt issue are the circumstances that brought to an end Ms. Warren\u2019s brief career as a special needs teacher at an elementary school in Riverdale, N.J., where she worked from 1970 to 1971, when she was just out of college. On the campaign trail, Ms. Warren\u2019s personal story is a central part of her stump speech, beginning with her upbringing in Oklahoma and, eventually, her experience as a teacher. As Ms. Warren tells it, she had wanted to be a teacher since she was in second grade.\n\n\u201cI loved that work, and I would probably still be doing that work today, but my story has some more turns,\u201d she told a crowd in Nevada last week. \u201cBy the end of the first year, I was visibly pregnant, and the principal did what principals did in those days: wished me luck and hired someone else for the job.\u201d\n\nShe included a similar account in her 2014 memoir. In some retellings earlier this year , she said the principal \u201cshowed me the door.\u201d\n\nIn a post on Twitter last week, Meagan Day, a writer for the socialist magazine Jacobin , drew attention to an interview Ms. Warren gave in 2007 in which she discussed the end of her career as a public-school teacher and did not describe being forced out because she was pregnant. Ms. Warren recalled going back to school because she lacked the education courses she needed.", "description": "Ms. Warren said she had grown more comfortable talking about her experience over the years, explaining why her description of the 1971 episode in her stump speeches differs from how she discussed it in the past.", "authors": ["Thomas Kaplan"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/08/us/politics/08warren/08warren-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
