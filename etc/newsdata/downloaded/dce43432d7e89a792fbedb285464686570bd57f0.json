Above, diners are seen taking hits from their joints with their meals\n\nWeed sommeliers, called 'Flower Hosts' serve marijuana enthusiasts joints paired with dishes prepared by a Le Cordon Bleu-trained chef\n\nHollywood-funded: Comedian Chris Rock, Miley Cyrus, DJ Mark Ronson and Sarah Silverman are among celebrity investors\n\nCompany founders Sean Black and David Elias beat more than 300 other businesses to secure one of just eight licenses offered by the city allowing brick and mortar firms to sell marijuana in West Hollywood.\n\n'For us the biggest thing is to be approachable, especially for people who aren't experienced in cannabis,' said Kevin Brady, the company's operations director.\n\n'We're employing this idea of a 'budtender', like a restaurant would have a wine sommelier, but a little bit less pretentious.\n\n'When a guest sits at a table, the budtender has a conversation with them, understands their experience with cannabis, and guides them to what they're looking for.\n\n'You have the option of buying joints, rolling your own joints, and renting bongs or pipes, all the way up to dab rigs and vapes, all with the idea of education, with someone who can walk you through those experiences.'\n\nAlongside a menu of stoner-friendly food like burgers and mac n cheese, the restaurant has a weed menu 'like a wine list', with information on seasonal varieties of marijuana and the local farms where the flowers are grown.\n\nDiners were seen taking hits from skull-shaped bongs and vaporizers, filling the room with smoke from their pre-rolled joints and munching on cannabis-infused 'edibles'\n\nCustomers have the option of buying joints, rolling their own joints, and renting bongs or pipes\n\nNikki Gronau (pictured) said that as a social media influencer for the cannabis industry, she'd been looking forward to visiting the restaurant since she first heard of it about a year ago.

Cannabis-infused chocolate squares, gummies and mints are also available to get patrons high.\n\nServers at the cafe said patrons are allowed to bring their own cannabis, for a $20 'tokage' fee \u2013 similar to a restaurant's corkage.\n\nTo preserve the restaurant's 'bright open and airy concept', and to avoid pungent smoke billowing into neighbors' yards, Lowell Farms uses specialized $200,000 industrial extractor fans favored by casinos, cigar lounges and chemical laboratories to suck away the floral fumes its patrons will generate.\n\nPorn actress Adira Allure, 24, told DailyMailTV said it was 'awesome' to be able to order food while smoking weed\n\nNo expense has been spared for the decoration either, with the restaurant's outdoor area featuring two 60-year-old olive trees imported from Italy.\n\nActress and model Adira Allure, 24, told DailyMailTV she was delighted to find a spot in her neighborhood where she could eat and smoke freely.\n\n'I've smoked weed for a long time. I've smoked in many clubs and stuff already, but it was really awesome to order fresh food with it, I've never had that experience,' she said.\n\n'The vibe was very relaxed - but also very crowded and intense at the same time. I can see people who haven't smoked before coming here and trying something, getting too high, and it being quite intense.\n\n'I think immediately more places like this are going to start popping up.'\n\nAdaeze Njaka, 31, who came for opening night with her four friends, said the restaurant felt different to a normal bar.\n\n'You can tell, there's no alcohol sold here but people are still having fun, the feel loose and everyone's smiling,' she said.\n\n'Cannabis makes you social, it makes you feel free. It lowers your inhibitions, but not so much as alcohol where you make enemies as opposed to friends. Even in the five minutes we've been here we've barely been able to eat because we've been chatting to people. Everyone is in such a good mood.'\n\nThe restaurant aims to employ the idea of a 'budtender' - similar to a wine sommelier - but 'less pretentious'.

I also got these spicy, deep-fried mac n cheese balls, so good.'\n\nA security guard outside the cafe, one of six standing watch on opening night, told DailyMailTV it was the quietest restaurant or bar job he'd ever had.\n\nTo preserve the restaurant's 'bright open and airy concept', and to avoid pungent smoke billowing into neighbors' yards, Lowell Farms uses specialized $200,000 industrial extractor fans to suck away the floral fumes\n\nThe establishment's chef, Andrea Drummer, was trained at the prestigious culinary school Le Cordon Bleu Los Angeles, and has since become an expert in cannabis-infused cuisine\n\n'At bars people drink alcohol and then get aggressive, they're louder, they get into fights,' said the guard, who asked not to be named. 'Here, it's very mellow. Nobody's causing any trouble. It's probably the marijuana.'\n\nThe establishment's chef, Andrea Drummer, was trained at the prestigious culinary school Le Cordon Bleu Los Angeles, and has since become an expert in cannabis-infused cuisine.\n\nChef Drummer has cooked for celebrities including artists Miguel and Wiz Khalifa, and comedian Chelsea Handler, and appeared on Netflix shows Chelsea Does and Cooking on High.\n\nLowell Farms said the restaurant, which seats 220 people, is fully booked for the next 30 days, and on its opening night lines outside stretched for three hours.\n\nSelling and using cannabis for recreation remains illegal under US federal law, but has been legal in California since 2016 making it one of the 11 states in the country to permit its use.", "description": "DailyMailTV visited Lowell Farms Cannabis Cafe  - the first restaurant in the United States to sell marijuana and backed by celebrities - on its opening night in Los Angeles on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Josh Boswell In Los Angeles", "For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/03/13/19250296-0-image-a-2_1570105332437.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
