Tommy did lose his temper several times during the process and I did calm him down a lot, and that wasn\u2019t shown either.\u2019\n\nThe episode ended with a surprise visit from Lord Sugar to the candidates\u2019 London pad, explaining that they would be off to Oxford in the next episode for the classic shopping task.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Apprentice airs Wednesdays at 9pm on BBC One.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
