Beijing has denied eroding Hong Kong's freedoms and Xi has vowed to crush any attempt to split China.\n\nThe unrest was sparked by a bill that would have allowed extradition to mainland China for trial in Communist Party-controlled courts. It has since widened into a pro-democracy movement.\n\nPolice also detonated what was believed to be an explosive found on Lai Chi Kok road in Prince Edward on Sunday.", "description": "Hong Kong police fired tear gas at protesters throwing petrol bombs on Sunday (October 20) as thousands staged an illegal march through the Kowloon district that will test the strength of the pro-democracy campaign after four months of unrest.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/24/67/98/1000x563_cmsv2_15a260b0-f359-5e08-a82b-96fd64b47125-4246798.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
