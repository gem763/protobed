Things may have changed in the decade since, but at the time, once you got through the gate with a pass, you were in and had access everywhere. No one bothered you. So after the meeting that brought me there, I would spend countless hours soaking these places in, which gave me the thrill of touring countless movie and TV sets at my leisure.\n\nThe most striking thing about walking through the set of a television show you\u2019re familiar with, is how fake everything looks. In real life, these sets are artificial, flat, lacking in texture and the sense that real people exist in that world.\n\nThe same is true of most location shoots. A movie might be shooting in a real place, but when you are there it looks lifeless and dull. For instance, I\u2019ve been to Monument Valley, and it is spectacular to look at, but it looks three times more spectacular in those John Ford movies.\n\nThis is the magic of film \u2014 and I mean film-film, the stock, the celluloid that captures the images. There is just something about film stock that transforms the everyday and/or counterfeit into something special.\n\nNot to go on too long, but if you\u2019re looking for an example\u2026 To try and save money, CBS forced Rod Serling to use video instead of film during the second season of his iconic Twilight Zone series. All things being the same, the difference between those episodes shot on video \u2014 including the classic Christmas episode \u201cNight of the Meek\u201d with Art Carney \u2014 and those captured on film, is all the difference; the difference between a school play and a professional production. In fact, the difference was so striking, CBS thankfully reversed its decision after six episodes.\n\nWhich brings me to my point\u2026\n\nKnowing all of this, why is director Ang Lee dedicated to making digital movies look like digital movies?\n\nLee actually thinks it\u2019s silly to push digital technology toward looking more and more like film. Everyone else wants digital to look like film. Lee wants digital to look like digital, which looks fake, which is one of Gemini Man\u2019s many, many problems.\n\nI\u2019ll get to the script in a bit, but Gemini Man is Lee\u2019s second movie shot with the super high frame-rate of 120 frames per second (fps) in 3D (his first was the flop Billy Lynn\u2019s Long Halftime Walk). Most movies are shot at 24 fps and have been for a century. What the 120 fps accomplishes is CLARITY, but it is an artificial CLARITY, like looking through a window at the real world where everything is flat and empty, no matter how full the scenery might be.\n\nFilm stock (and the digital technology that apes film) adds depth, and because everything cannot be in focus, you know what to look at. Lee\u2019s 120 fps puts EVERYTHING in focus, so you end up looking at the shingles on a roof when you should be looking at the assassin running across the roof.\n\nWhereas film is immersive, Lee\u2019s 120 fps makes you feel like you\u2019re an outsider watching the action through a pane of glass. There\u2019s a counterfeit emptiness to every shot, especially the daylight scenes, which are so brightly lit, so flat, so lacking in texture and shadow, you get the sense you\u2019re in an operating room not a spy thriller.\n\nAnd that\u2019s a another problem, a problem that might explain why I just spent 500 words talking about the cinematography\u2026 Except for an early action scene involving a motorcycle chase \u2014 that feels more relentless than anything we\u2019ve seen from the Terminator franchise in 15 years, Gemini Man does not thrill at all.\n\nIf you are determined to see a movie where a movie star fights himself, let me recommend 1991\u2019s Double Impact; the tagline is \u201cDouble the Van Dammage!\u201d and does not disappoint. Hey, it is what it aims to be, which cannot be said for Gemini Man.\n\nThe Great Will Smith plays Henry Brogan, a 51-year-old American sniper and patriot who has 72 kills under his belt. Having done his duty for God and country, he\u2019s ready to retire; and as soon as he explains why with this thudding dialogue \u2014 \u201cDeep down, it\u2019s like my soul is hurting. I just want some peace\u201d \u2014 you know the movie is in trouble.\n\nNaturally, retirement lasts less than 24 hours. A black box organization within his own wants him dead. The chase is on. The twist is that Henry is stalked by his own clone: a CGI\u2019d version of Smith in his early 20s.\n\nLee is eager to delve into some big themes: The emotional toll of life as the world\u2019s top assassin \u2014 even if you are killing terrorists to save lives; what it means to age out of your profession; what if you could guide your younger self to avoid the same mistakes, especially the self-loathing\u2026?\n\nUnfortunately, these interesting ideas are cut down in a hackneyed story loaded with clich\u00e9s wrapped in the kind of uninspired plot you expect from a Steven Seagal direct-to-video entry.\n\nEven Smith\u2019s natural charisma has been fed through a de-flavorizer powered by tired tropes and banal dialogue.\n\nAs far as the CGI\u2019d Fresh Prince, sometimes it works, sometimes you feel like you\u2019re watching a video game version of Big Willie.\n\nClive Owen plays the villain, a demented patriot behind the cloning program. But he\u2019s really just a third-rate Bond villain without charm or humanity \u2026 or a change of clothes. He\u2019s either seething or plotting or manipulating. Seriously, it\u2019s ridiculous.\n\nAnd like most movies today, despite the presence of Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Gemini Man is as sexless as Mr. Rogers Neighborhood. As if this movie isn\u2019t frustrating enough, we don\u2019t even get a decent look at her during a strip search. What the hell, Hollywood?\n\nWhen you learn that Gemini Man cost $140 million, it only adds to the disappointment and begs a question\u2026 You have $140 million and you\u2019re still doing product placement? Coca Cola! Budweiser! Tostitos! It\u2019s everywhere! And at a 120 fps, it is especially glaring and shameless.\n\nNot for a moment did I believe the relationships \u2014 not the father-son relationship between Clive Owen and the Fresh Prince, not the relationships between Henry and his eccentric war-cronies, not the relationship between Henry and Winstead\u2019s character, and certainly not the ridiculous closing scene. No spark. No chemistry. No humanity.\n\nAng Lee is a great director but like another great director, Bob Zemeckis, his misguided love of technology is creating expensive visual gimmicks instead of cinema.\n\nP.S. Since I was already at the movies, I decided to see Joker again. My opinion of it only rose the second time.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.
