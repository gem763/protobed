First came Cher, then came Beyonc\u00e9. Now, in 2019, a new enigma is riding on their coattails. His name is Derek, and he likes boys, movies and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet.\n\nWhile his TC stanning obviously spills out into his real life, most of Derek's admiration for the star exists online, where he tweets frequent insights into Chalabae\u2019s movements from his account @timotheechalamt. Since he launched his account back in late 2012, he\u2019s amassed nearly 15,000 followers -- though most of them signed on to become part of Derek\u2019s inner psyche around the time Chalamet broke out in Call Me By Your Name.\n\nFor anyone who hasn\u2019t smashed the follow button yet, here\u2019s Derek\u2019s deal. He loves Timothee Chalamet and all of his affiliate stars, and so any time new (or old) images of TC pop up on his feed, he sends them out to his followers with profound cries of \u201cHIS SERVE\u201d, \u201cPERIOD!\u201d, \u201cOPRAH GIF\u201d or, our new personal favourite, \u201cSee when you do legendtry\u2026\u201d. He\u2019s also made it his mission to tweet Timmy good morning and good night -- every single day of the year.\n\nHis love for the star has just earned him a namecheck in New York Magazine. So just how did his Chalamet stanning start? Does Timmy know about his account? And why is his reaction to any new developments in the actor\u2019s life so brief -- and yet so satisfying? To find out more, we slid into Derek\u2019s Twitter DMs so he could tell us the story himself.\n\nThis article originally appeared on i-D UK.", "description": "He wishes the movie star a good morning -- every single day.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5da995ecfbf646000a376699/lede/1571396368963-1542201475505-stan-language-timothee-harry.jpeg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
