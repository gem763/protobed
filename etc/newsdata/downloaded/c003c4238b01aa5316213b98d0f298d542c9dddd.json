Why would they do it? What do they have to gain? Making life easier for third party publishers is the only answer I can see but, I mean, somehow they\u2019ve managed to survive for the last for four generations so what suddenly changed? Office politics I guess, like GC said, but I thought Sony were smarter than that.\n\nAt the end of the day I don\u2019t care how Sony run their business as long as they put out great games and a good console, but surely they\u2019ve seen how well this generation has gone and would just want to keep things rolling in the same fashion. A lot of their best games, like Horizon Zero Dawn and Astro Bot, are not made in America and I\u2019m now worried whether their sequels are going to get a lot of back seat driving from American execs that don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing.\n\nIt would be ironic if at the same time this all happened Microsoft sorted themselves and did the opposite. I still can\u2019t believe in all this setting up of first party studios they haven\u2019t bought a Japanese or European studio. It was obvious in the original Xbox generation they should\u2019ve done that and they still haven\u2019t. I just don\u2019t understand these companies sometimes, it always seems like lions led by donkeys when it comes to games publishers.\n\nPlanstall\n\nGC: It is one of the most bizarrely self-destructive things we\u2019ve ever seen a company do. Sony have 24 years of proof that their current system works and can use Microsoft as proof that the alternative is far less effective.", "description": "The Friday Inbox tries to understand the reasoning behind the Sony redundancies, as one reader tries to work out Bluepoint\u2019s next game.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/nintendo_switch_neon_blue_red_1920.0-909f_1570749082.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
