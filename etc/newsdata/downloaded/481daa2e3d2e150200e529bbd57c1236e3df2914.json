We got climbers,\u201d Mr Trump said next to a recently completed part of the border in Otay Mesa, California last month.\n\n\u201cWe had 20 mountain climbers. That\u2019s all they do \u2013 they love to climb mountains. They can have it. Me, I don\u2019t want to climb mountains. But they are very good, and some of them were champions. And we gave them different prototypes of walls, and this was the one that was hardest to climb.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

I doubt if they exist. More importantly, to declare something to be impossible to climb to a bonafide rock climber is to issue a challenge.\n\n\u201cSo, I decided to build an exact replica and hold a competition. Although I\u2019m 75 years old, I am still an active rock climber and hold certification by American Mountain Guide Association as a Single Pitch Instructor. It helped that I\u2019m also a retired engineer.\u201d\n\nThe competition comes after Mr Trump fired off a misspelled response to reports he wanted a moat filled with alligators and snakes at the border.", "description": "Professional rock climbers are set to challenge\u00a0Donald Trump\u2019s assertion his border wall was trialled by 20 mountaineers and is \u201cimpossible to climb\u201d.", "authors": ["Maya Oppenheim"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/02/23/trump-border-fence.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
