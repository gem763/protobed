However, Elgort seems to mean it in a platonic way:\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t need to be sexual. I could be done sexually with my girlfriend. I think we\u2019ve been pretty clear that I want to feel free to fall in love with people and that [option] should be open, but sexually it can be closed off.\u201d\n\nElgort used his affection for his guy friends as an example: \u201cI\u2019m in love with a bunch of my male friends who I\u2019m not interested in having sex with, so why can\u2019t I put the desire to have sex with women aside and let myself have love with women?\u201d\n\nHe then talked about his relationship with Shailene Woodley, his co-star from The Fault In Our Stars and The Divergent movies. \u201cI love Shailene Woodley and we never had anything sexual and that was great,\u201d Elgort said. \u201cThere will probably be some sort of chemical thing at some point that you can\u2019t help, but you just have to be disciplined and not be a f******. We\u2019re primitive beings.\u201d Either this is a long-winded and confusing way of saying he just wants more friends, or Elgort has some particular ideas about being in an open relationship (???).\n\nHe also commented on that infamous series of shirtless thirst trap photos he posted back in May. \u201cI was hanging out and somehow \u2014 and this is almost embarrassing to admit \u2014 I just did a photoshoot with myself. I took a bunch of photos of myself and decided to post them because it was honest. I\u2019m obsessed with the idea of not wearing a mask,\u201d he said. Good for you, Ansel Elgort, good for you.\n\nStay in touch.
