PRECIOUS-Gold inches up as anxious investors await Sino-U.S. talks\n\n* Gold hits $1,516.77/oz, highest since Oct 3\n\n* Spot gold neutral in $1,488-$1,514/oz range -technicals\n\n\n\n(Updates prices)\n\nBy Eileen Soreng\n\nOct 10 (Reuters) - Gold edged tentatively higher on Thursday\n\nahead of U.S.-China trade talks set to begin in Washington later\n\nin the day, amid mixed signals over the prospects for the\n\nnegotiations.\n\nSpot gold was up 0.1% at $1,506.96 per ounce, as of\n\n1204 GMT, having hit a one-week peak of $1,516.77 early in the\n\nsession. U.S. gold futures GCcv1 were down 0.1% at $1,512.10.\n\n\"The market is extremely nervous. Everybody is really\n\npositive towards the price of gold, but everybody is waiting for\n\nsome sort of assurance or confirmation on the trade talks,\" said\n\nAfshin Nabavi, senior vice president at precious metals trader\n\nMKS SA.\n\nMarkets have been on edge for weeks over the U.S.-China\n\ntrade tensions and recent data has pointed to further weakening\n\nin global growth.\n\nThe South China Morning Post newspaper reported the Chinese\n\ndelegation was planning to leave Washington after just a day of\n\nminister-level meetings, a day earlier than\n\nexpected.\n\nHowever reports suggesting a possible reprieve on U.S.\n\nrestrictions on Chinese technology giant Huawei helped\n\nsentiment. If negotiations break down again, by Dec. 15 nearly all\n\nChinese goods imports into the United States -- more than $500\n\nbillion -- could be subject to punitive tariffs. \"Investors are gravitating to risk aversion until there can\n\nbe sustained clarity when it comes to U.S.-China trade\n\ntensions... Hence we are seeing elevated prices for gold,\" said\n\nHan Tan, market analyst at FXTM.\n\n\"If there is significantly positive development, then gold\n\ncould easily break below $1,500.\"\n\nGold prices have risen about 20% since hitting this year's\n\nlow of $1,265.85 in May mainly on the back of trade tensions and\n\ngloomy economic growth outlook.\n\nGold is often used by investors as a hedge against political\n\nand financial uncertainty.\n\nMeanwhile, the dollar weakened broadly against its rivals as\n\nit was on track for its biggest daily drop in five weeks,\n\nfurther supporting the greenback-denominated gold, while\n\nEuropean shares inched down in early trade. USD/ Spot gold looks neutral in a range of $1,488-$1,514 per\n\nounce, Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao said. Among other precious metals, silver rose 0.3% to\n\n$17.74 per ounce.\n\nPalladium XPD= was up 0.4% at $1,688.55, while platinum\n\nXPT= eased 0.3% to $889.12 an ounce.\n\n\n\n", "description": "PRECIOUS-Gold inches up as anxious investors await Sino-U.S. talks", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEB730HT_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
