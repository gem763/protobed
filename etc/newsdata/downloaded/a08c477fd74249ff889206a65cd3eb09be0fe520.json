REUTERS/ Hannah McKay/File Photo\n\nThe decision by high-profile British fund manager Neil Woodford to suspend his flagship equities fund has thrown a spotlight on such funds that offer daily redemptions.\n\nThe Woodford fund was unable to meet heavy demand from investors wanting their cash back even though it advertised itself as offering daily redemptions.\n\nAlex Brazier, the BoE\u2019s executive director for financial stability, said investors had long favored putting money into funds that offer daily redemptions.\n\nThis has made it harder for funds in infrastructure and other \u201cilliquid\u201d or long-term assets to compete as they are unable to offer such speedy redemptions, Brazier said.\n\n\u201cSo the unlevel playing field could have been a barrier to greater investment in patient forms of capital, a central tenet of the government\u2019s framework for raising productivity,\u201d Brazier said in a speech in Edinburgh.\n\nFor a \u201cfair and transparent fight\u201d between types of funds, the risk of suspension or dilution would be properly factored into the pricing and redemption terms of open-ended funds, Brazier said.\n\nThis could make funds that invest for the long term look relatively more attractive, Brazier said.\n\nFollowing the Woodford suspension, the Bank of England, said it was looking how redemption terms in open-ended funds can better match the amount of time it takes to sell assets to raise cash.\n\n\u201cPretending such investments are liquid when they are not creates dangers,\u201d Brazier said.\n\nAs the BoE review continues, \u201cwe intend to have in mind not just how reform could promote financial stability, but also how it can promote the supply of productive finance too,\u201d Brazier said.\n\nHe reiterated the BoE\u2019s stance that the core of Britain\u2019s banking system could still continue to serve the economy, whatever form Brexit takes on Oct. 31. Markets are increasingly betting on a \u201cno-deal\u201d Brexit, given no divorce settlement has been agreed with the European Union.\n\nSome backers of Brexit see Britain\u2019s departure from the EU as an opportunity to revisit financial rules that are currently written in Brussels.\n\nBrazier said the way the EU bakes detailed rules into primary legislation meant they are \u201cinflexible\u201d, but there is no need to weaken their substance.\n\n\u201cLooking ahead, we\u2019ll need a level of resilience in our system in future that\u2019s at least as great as currently planned,\u201d Brazier said.", "description": "More realistic curbs on investors wanting to pull cash from funds could make investing in infrastructure more attractive and bolster economic growth, a senior Bank of England (BoE) official said on Monday.", "authors": ["Huw Jones", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190902&t=2&i=1425465228&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF811G6"}
