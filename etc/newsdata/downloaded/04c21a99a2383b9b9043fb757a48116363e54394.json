Conway: Unfit for office\n\nWhen asked about his discussions with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, for example, he denied that he had tried to muscle Zelensky into investigating Joe Biden and his family. Then he admitted it. \u201cThe conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place, was largely the fact that we don\u2019t want our people, like Vice President Biden and his son, creating to the corruption [sic] already in the Ukraine.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s White House released a summary\u2014it would be too much to call it a transcript\u2014of his conversation with Zelensky, which did not help, since it confirmed that Trump had pressured Zelensky, even to the point of linking his request to military aid for Ukraine. (And remember, this is what the White House thought was the best version.) When a reporter later asked point-blank what Trump thought the Ukrainians should do, Trump said plainly, \u201cThey should investigate the Bidens.\u201d\n\nTrump could argue that the record is incomplete, or that he was misunderstood. He could argue, as he initially tried to do, that he can\u2019t be impeached for a single phone call.\n\nEven granting that dubious claim, however, it\u2019s a matter of public record that there\u2019s nothing singular about his obsession with the Bidens. (As Ian Fleming wrote in Goldfinger, once is happenstance, twice is coincidence, three times is enemy action.) On the South Lawn last week, Trump said, \u201cChina should start an investigation into the Bidens.\u201d This is not a difficult sentence to parse. The president of the United States asked an authoritarian power to investigate his political opponent. This one statement alone is impeachable.\n\nTrump and nuance are complete strangers to each other, but that didn\u2019t stop the president\u2019s enablers from claiming that Trump was kidding, that he had to be kidding, because obviously, any president with a lick of sense wouldn\u2019t incriminate himself. Trump\u2019s courtiers argued, in effect, that it would indeed be a gross abuse of power for the president to ask China to investigate Biden, and therefore the president could not possibly have been asking China to investigate Biden. QED.\n\nAdam Serwer: The mad king\u2019s enablers\n\nBut what about witness intimidation, or violations of federal law that\u2019s meant to protect whistle-blowers? How about inciting violence against the constitutional order of the United States itself? Only a fool would admit to such offenses, or even hint at thinking about committing them. And yet Trump has admitted to all of these things.\n\nThe logical conclusion is not that Trump is innocent, but that Trump is a fool.\n\n\u2026.In addition, I want to meet not only my accuser, who presented SECOND & THIRD HAND INFORMATION, but also the person who illegally gave this information, which was largely incorrect, to the \u201cWhistleblower.\u201d Was this person SPYING on the U.S. President? Big Consequences! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 29, 2019\n\nHere is Trump trying to out the whistle-blower while accusing anyone who provided material about the whistle-blower\u2019s complaint of \u201cspying\u201d on him, and warning of \u201cconsequences.\u201d", "description": "Trump\u2019s admissions on social media alone provide enough material for Congress to remove him.", "authors": ["Tom Nichols", "Tom Nichols Is The Author Of"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/RTX6EXQV/facebook.jpg?1570731493", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
