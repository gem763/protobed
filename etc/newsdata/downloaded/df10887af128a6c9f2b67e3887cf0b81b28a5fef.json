Much of this information has major privacy implications.\u201d\n\nAlan Wolk, co-founder and lead analyst at the consultancy TVrev, said he expects streaming ads to be less intrusive than those which follow users around the internet.\n\n\u201cThe TV industry has learned from digital that people find that kind of advertising creepy,\u201d he said.\n\nWolk said streaming services are aiming for fewer ads compared with broadcast television that will be \u201cless painful\u201d for viewers because they are more relevant.\n\nAn apartment dweller, for example, might not be interested in a lawn care ad and a 24-year-old may be turned off by messages for retirement. And advertisers will pay more if they know their messages are being delivered to people interested in their products.\n\n\u201cThe ultimate goal is to be able to get fewer, better targeted ads that brands will pay more money for and consumers are happy to watch,\u201d Wolk said.\n\n\u2013 Limits of targeting \u2013\n\nTargeting for television has limits, however. It is never really clear which member of a family is watching a specific show, or whether it is seen live or recorded.\n\nCharles Taylor, a marketing professor at Villanova University, said addressable TV advertising is on the rise, but that platforms are likely to be sensitive to consumer privacy concerns, and aware of new laws including a strict statute in California.\n\nThe California law, he said, \u201cwon\u2019t allow marketers to build data management platforms where they are merging data form various sources.\u201d\n\nAs a result, Taylor said the targeting is likely to be \u201cbehavioral,\u201d or based largely on viewing habits, without the detailed profiles that Facebook and Google use.\n\n\u201cAlmost nobody would want health information shared; on the other hand most people don\u2019t mind more targeted ads based on their real preferences,\u201d Taylor said.\n\n\u2013 2020 political ads \u2013\n\nAddressable TV advertising also opens up a new channel for political ads, potentially impacting spending in the 2020 US election campaign.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any doubt this will play a role\u201d in the election campaign, Taylor said.\n\n\u201cThe databases out there are pretty effective at knowing someone\u2019s political affiliation and a well-built data management platform should be able to give you a good idea of which voters might potentially be swayed.\u201d\n\nMark Jablonowski, managing partner at the digital ad consultancy DSPolitical, said these new platforms may not be able to get the kinds of details of internet services, but that they may still be useful for candidates.\n\n\u201cFor now the platforms are well suited to geographical targeting \u2014 which can be quite powerful in politics,\u201d Jablonowski said.\n\n\u201cCandidates running in 2020 would be smart to include these platforms in their media mix because, at the end of the day, political advertising is all about getting in front of voters wherever and whenever possible.\u201d", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 In the new world of streaming television, advertising is not going away, but is evolving to become more like marketing on the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/27/3dfa7e_rise-new-streaming-tv-services-marketers-are-use-targeted-ads-in-manner-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
