The company is making the preparations it requires to address very strong demand, it says, and so it\u2019s looking down the road at how large the network of small satellites potentially has to grow in order to serve all potential customers reliably.\n\nIn May 2019, SpaceX sent up its first 60 operational satellites after launching a couple of prototypes last year. The satellites will work in tandem with ground stations that receive and convert the signal, which will be roughly the size of a pizza box, based on previously comments made by Musk.", "description": "SpaceX CEO Elon Musk used an internet connection provided by his company\u2019s Starlink constellation of broadband satellites early on Tuesday AM.
