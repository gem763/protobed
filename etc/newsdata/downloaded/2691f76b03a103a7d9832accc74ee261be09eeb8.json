Bush Takes Aim at President Trump: \u2018He\u2019s Not a Victim\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "Failed Trump challenger Jeb Bush on Tuesday decided to wade into political waters and comment on President Trump\u2019s latest remark describing the Democrat-led impeachment effort as a political \u201clynching,\u201d stating that the president is \u201cnot a victim.\u201d\n\nThe former Florida governor \u2014 who failed to defeat then-candidate Donald Trump during the contentious Republican primary race in 2015-2016 and earned the nickname \u201cLow Energy Jeb\u201d \u2014 weighed in on Trump\u2019s tweet on Tuesday and declared that Trump is \u201cnot a victim.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe President is not a victim. He should be the most powerful person on the planet. To equate his plight to lynching is grotesque,\u201d Bush wrote in response to Trump\u2019s tweet:\n\nThe President is not a victim. He should be the most powerful person on the planet. To equate his plight to lynching is grotesque. https://t.co/ZECeswGlWx \u2014 Jeb Bush (@JebBush) October 22, 2019\n\nDespite Bush\u2019s claim, the president has been subjected to a swath of never-ending investigations spurred by Democrats and the \u201cDeep State,\u201d as reports over the past year have shown. The Trump-Russia investigation, for instance, appeared to be a part of a greater contingency plan or \u201cinsurance policy\u201d of the Deep State, as indicated by texts between former FBI employees Lisa Page and Peter Strzok.\n\n\u201cI want to believe the path you threw out for consideration in [Deputy Director Andrew McCabe\u2019s] office\u2014that there\u2019s no way [Trump] gets elected\u2014but I\u2019m afraid we can\u2019t take that risk. It\u2019s like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before you\u2019re 40\u2026\u201d Strzok wrote in a message reportedly referencing the push for the Russia probe.\n\nIn another text from August 2016, Page wrote, \u201c[Trump\u2019s] not ever going to become president, right? Right!?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. No he won\u2019t. We\u2019ll stop it,\u201d Strzok wrote.\n\nMany Democrats were banking on the Mueller report, hoping it would serve as a catalyst for the president\u2019s impeachment. However, it concluded there was no evidence of collusion or conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\nTrump\u2019s opponents quickly found another basis for the inquiry, but a faulty one based on a complaint from a so-called \u201cwhistleblower\u201d regarding Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky. The White House released a transcript of the call, which did not show Trump \u201cshaking down\u201d the Ukrainian government or \u201cpressuring\u201d officials to interfere in the 2020 elections by investigating former Vice President Joe Biden (D).\n\nTrump\u2019s secondary query \u2014 the first was a reference to CrowdStrike \u2014 involved Biden\u2019s role in the firing of a prosecutor investigating Burisma Holdings, where his son Hunter Biden was making tens of thousands per month. Joe Biden bragged about getting the prosecutor fired after threatening to withhold $1 billion in aid.\n\nBush has been a sharp critic of Trump and said in March that a Republican should challenge Trump in 2020.\n\n\u201cI think someone should run just because Republicans ought to be given a choice\u2026\u201d Bush told David Axelrod.\n\nTrump technically has three Republican primary challengers \u2014 former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, former Rep. Joe Walsh, and former South Carolina Rep. and Gov. Mark Sanford. Only one person showed up to Sanford\u2019s official campaign launch last week, according to reports.", "description": "Jeb Bush decided to wade into political waters and comment on President Trump's latest remark,\u00a0stating that the president is \"not a victim.\"", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Jeb-Bush-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
