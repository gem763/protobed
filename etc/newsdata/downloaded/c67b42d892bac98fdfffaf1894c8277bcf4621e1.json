Two batters later, Anthony Rendon made the Houston Astros pay for the umpires\u2019 mistake.\n\nRendon blasted a two-run home run to extend the Washington Nationals\u2019 lead to three runs shortly after the officiating crew working Game 6 of the World Series upheld their call that Turner interfered with Houston first baseman Yuli Gurriel as he lunged to touch first.\n\nThe call against Turner pleased the home crowd at Minute Maid Park, and virtually no one else, as social media exploded and Dave Martinez was ejected for arguing with the umpires. Rendon\u2019s two-run shot could have plated three runners instead, adding to Washington\u2019s lead \u2014 but at the end of the night, it didn\u2019t impact the final result.\n\nWith a 7-2 victory over the Houston Astros at Minute Maid Park, the Nationals pushed the World Series to a Game 7 to be contested Wednesday night.\n\nStephen Strasburg earned the win five hits, two earned runs and seven strikeouts over 8 1/3 innings pitched. He became the first pitcher ever to finish an MLB postseason 5-0.\n\nStrasburg\u2019s excellent outing started off ominously. Entering the bottom of the first with a 1-0 Nationals lead, he gave up a booming double to George Springer on his first pitch, let Springer take third on a wild pitch on his second offering and soon watched him come home on a Jos\u00e9 Altuve sacrifice fly.\n\nTwo batters later, Alex Bregman barrelled a fastball over the middle of the plate to the short left-field porch for a solo home run, putting Houston ahead 2-1.\n\nThe Nationals worked Verlander\u2019s pitch count up over the next few innings, including one sequence in which he spent seven pitches walking Eaton and 10 to walk Rendon, who hit four fouls on two-strike counts to extend the at-bat.\n\nIt led to Washington\u2019s breakthrough in their third time through the batting order. Eaton tied the game with a solo shot in the fifth, and two batters later, Soto crushed a home run 413 feet. After Bregman carried his bat all the way to first base during his round-tripper, Soto mimicked the exact same move, dropping his bat at the feet of first-base coach Tim Bogar.\n\nThat would not be the only emotional and tense moment of the game. In the seventh, Turner thought he had a single and an extra base on an error that would have pushed Yan Gomes to third. But Turner\u2019s body pushed Gurriel\u2019s glove off as he extended to catch an off-target throw from pitcher Brad Peacock.\n\nThe officials spent more than four minutes reviewing the play before coming to the same conclusion, upsetting the Nationals, who argued that Turner never strayed from the basepath or did anything intentional to disrupt Gurriel.\n\nAfter the inning \u2014 in which Rendon\u2019s home run gave Washington its biggest lead of the night \u2014 Martinez came out to continue to argue with home plate umpire Sam Holbrook about the Turner call. He fought two of his coaches who were trying to restrain him and was eventually ejected.\n\nBut the Nationals were able to lock down the win from there. Strasburg mowed down the next six batters he faced, while the offense battered the Astros\u2018 bullpen. Rendon hit a two-run double in the ninth for insurance.\n\nGame 7 will pit Max Scherzer against Zack Greinke. Scherzer is recovering from neck spasms that forced him to miss his start in Game 5. Yet several hours after throwing pitches on level ground in the outfield, Scherzer briefly warmed up in the bullpen during the seventh inning as if he could have entered in relief.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
