Also read Simon Lambert's column on exit fees and how he got a \u00a3750 bill.\n\nWhy does an Isa or investing platform matter?\n\nThe right Isa wrapper or investing account has the power to boost your investments, helping you to build a portfolio and limiting how your hard-won returns are eaten into by fees.\n\nDIY investing platforms act as a place to buy, sell and hold all your investments and a tax-efficient wrapper around them if you choose to invest in an Isa.\n\nWhen weighing up the right one for you, it's important to to look at the service that it offers, along with administration charges and dealing fees, plus any other extra costs.\n\nWe highlight Isa and non-Isa charges, but don't forget that investing in an Isa makes sense, as it should protect your hopefully growing investments from as much tax as possible.\n\nWe've busted the charges of what we consider some of the best (and cheapest) DIY investing platforms, including different fees for buying shares, funds, investment trusts and ETFs. We would advise doing your own research and considering the points below before you choose.\n\nFlat fee vs percentage charge DIY investing platform prices can be chiefly be split into two camps. Some charge a flat administration charge, while others charge a percentage of investors' holdings. The former tend to always charge for buying and selling investment funds, while the latter may bundle this cost in and offer free fund dealing. All charge for buying and selling shares, investment trusts and other products that are not funds, but the dealing fees vary from as low as \u00a35 to about \u00a312. If you are a buy and hold investor putting away a large sum of money then you may benefit from a flat fee rather than percentage-based charging, which can mount up to a hefty amount. But if you plan on buying and selling regularly watch our for dealing charges, as these can also add up substantially and easily erode the gain from a flat fee. Lower charges for regular monthly investing can substantially cut costs.\n\nHow we choose the best DIY investing platforms\n\nWe have focused on two vital aspects, cost and quality. This is not a collection of all of the absolute cheapest platforms, these are some we think stand out and that also compete keenly on price.\n\nAll discount initial fund charges down to zero in most cases. Some funds can still carry an initial charge though - platforms should provide you with a list to check.\n\n\n\nWe have picked DIY Isa platforms to suit different investors and focus on those that offer a choice of investments - not just funds. Each one will be better for some investors than others and you should choose depending on your needs. Remember there are plenty of others available too.\n\nThis list is in no particular order.\n\nHargreaves Lansdown is the big gun of DIY investing. The website is packed with information from its advisers and analysts, the shares and fund data is comprehensive and there is a very handy app.\n\nInvestors pay a 0.45 per cent fee on their total fund investments up to \u00a3250,000; 0.25 per cent to \u00a31m, 0.1 per cent to \u00a32m and nothing above that. Shares and investment trusts also incur a 0.45 per cent charge on the entire holding, capped at \u00a345.\n\nHargreaves has negotiated some reduced annual management charges from fund managers.\n\nFund dealing is free. Share, investment trust, corporate bond and ETF dealing costs \u00a311.95 per trade. If you trade more than 10 times per month share-dealing costs step down. Regular monthly share and some investment trust investing is \u00a31.50, dividend reinvesting is 1 per cent, with a \u00a31 minimum charge and \u00a310 maximum.\n\nHargreaves has its very influential Wealth 150, a range of Master Portfolios, and its Portfolio+ service to make investing progressively easier and more hands off\n\nHargreaves Lansdown recently announced it would remove exit fees and cut a number of its costs.\n\nStandard non-Isa dealing: Hargreaves' non-Isa Vantage account carries the same charges except for removing the fee for holding shares and trusts.\n\nWho is it good for? Those looking for an advice-rich service that is price-competitive but not the cheapest around. It does come with lots of bells and whistles, including a very good app and portfolios for easy investing .\n\nOur tests found Hargreaves platform easy and intuitive to use and its newly revised app is good.\n\nIt offers a proven popular service weighted towards funds but with access to investment trusts, ETFs, shares and the corporate bond market under one roof. [ More details on Hargeaves Lansdown ]\n\nInteractive Investor\n\nInteractive Investor introduced new monthly fee plans in June 2019, ranging from \u00a39.99 to \u00a319.99 per month.\n\nThis charging replaced its old \u00a322.50 quarterly fee\n\nThere are three plans that can be chosen according to your investment style: Investor, charging \u00a39.99 a month, Funds Fan charging \u00a313.99 a month, and Super Investor charging \u00a319.99 a month.\n\nWith each plan you get \u00a37.99 of trading credit per month, with different charges to buy or sell applying. The trading credit lasts for 90 days.\n\nIn the Investor plan, trades in UK shares, funds and investment trusts and US shares are charged at \u00a37.99 each.\n\nFor funds fan investors, the same costs apply but trades in funds and investment trusts are charged at \u00a33.99 each.\n\nIn the Super Investor plan, trades in UK shares and funds and investment trusts are \u00a33.99 each and \u00a34.99 for US shares.\n\nTrading in other international shares is \u00a319.99 for the Investor and Funds Fan plans and \u00a39.99 for the Super Investor plan. Dividend reinvestment and regular investment is just 99p for all plans.\n\nSipp investors pay an extra \u00a310 per month on all plans.\n\nWho is it good for? The great advantage of Interactive Investor has been that you could get your costs back in free trades, previously the charge was \u00a322.50 per quarter, or \u00a390 per year, and you could get up to \u00a390 back in credit to spend on buying and selling. Under this system it cost \u00a310 to buy or sell shares, funds or trusts and regular investing and dividend reinvestment was \u00a31.\n\nChoose the standard option under the new charging structure and you will pay \u00a3119.88 per year and get back \u00a395.88 in trading credits \u2013 and you must spend them within 90 days.\n\nOn the plus side, the cost of buying and selling UK investments has been reduced to \u00a37.99 or less.\n\nIn This is Money\u2019s view, Interactive Investor\u2019s new charging plan is too complicated and not as good as it once was in terms of getting your money back in free trades. However, it still remains a top contender among investing platforms. Service is good and the fees are keen.\n\nInteractive Investor is a good option for those with larger portfolios who would find percentage-based charges elsewhere mounting up. Someone with \u00a3100,000 in funds at Interactive Investor would pay \u00a3119.88 per year, or just \u00a324 if they used all their trading credit. At Hargreaves Lansdown, with a 0.45 per cent annual fee, they would pay \u00a3450. [More details on Interactive Investor]\n\nFive things to consider when picking an investing platform 1. Cheapest is not always best: You need to think about a combination of price and service - it is worth paying for quality but make sure you are actually getting that. 2. What will you invest in: Different dealing fees for shares, investment trusts and funds mean you need to think about how you will invest and tailor your choice accordingly. 3. Tools and information: What level of useful portfolio building tools and information does a platform offer? 4. Overall charges: Don't just look at the admin fee or dealing charges. You need to combine both to get a true cost, along with costs such as dividend reinvestment and regular dealing charges. A low admin fee might look good but if you are an active investor who buys and sells a lot, then dealing charges will soon rack up and send costs soaring. 5. Extra fees: Check for regular monthly investing discounts, dividend reinvestment fees, transfer charges and other elements\n\nFidelity\n\nFidelity is one of the big investing names and has a platform packed with useful information, guides, market commentary and videos.\n\nShare dealing has now been reintroduced to the platform with a flat \u00a310 fee and this charge also applies to investment trusts and ETFs.\n\nHolding investment funds carries a 0.35 per cent charge up to \u00a3250,000 and 0.20 per cent above that and 0 per cent above \u00a31million.\n\nHowever, if you are investing small amounts the charging structure is slightly different. Fidelity charges a flat \u00a345 on amounts up to \u00a37,500 before the 0.35 per cent rate kicks in.\n\nThere are no fund dealing charges for buying and selling.\n\nWho is it good for? Fidelity offers very useful service. It is one of the big guns, has model portfolios, tools to help you decide how to invest and a wealth of information on offer.\n\nOur tests found the main site easy to read and navigate, but the investment platform itself a bit more fiddly to use.\n\nWith the ability to buy funds and shares in the same Isa returning, a drawback for many DIY investors has been removed.[More details on Fidelity]\n\nAJ Bell Youinvest has a 0.25 per cent annual administration charge. However, for non-fund holdings in Isas, such as investment trusts, shares and ETFs, this is capped at \u00a37.50 per quarter. In a Sipp the cap is \u00a325 per quarter.\n\nFor fund holdings it steps down to 0.1 per cent from \u00a3250,000 to \u00a31million, 0.05 per cent to \u00a32million and then nothing above that.\n\nFund dealing costs \u00a31.50. Share, ETF and investment trust dealing is \u00a39.95 - or \u00a34.95 if you have traded ten times in the previous month.\n\nRegular investing costs \u00a31.50 into funds, FTSE 350 shares and a limited range of investment trusts.\n\nWho is it good for? Youinvest scores with a low percentage admin charge that is also capped for shares, trusts and ETFs. It does have fund dealing charges, but at just \u00a31.50 these are competitive than before.\n\nThere is cost effective regular monthly investing in funds, shares and selected investment trusts. There is no cheap dividend reinvestment. [More details on Youinvest]\n\nAlliance Trust investors pay \u00a310 per month, which works out at \u00a3120 per year.\n\nInvestors get four online trades per year included. It charges a flat \u00a39.99 per trade for buying funds, shares, ETFs and investment trusts. However, doing this as regular monthly online direct debit investing slashes the charge to \u00a31.50 per deal, while dividend reinvestment costs \u00a35.\n\nIt offers access to the full run of investment trusts, shares, ETFs and direct bonds available. Investors using it can access research and tools from Morningstar with their portfolio.\n\nStandard non-Isa dealing: Charges are the same for standard share dealing, including the administration fee.\n\nWho is it good for? Buy-and-hold investors with large sums invested could do well here as there is a flat fee rather than a percentage charge, however, they need to weigh up the dealing costs, as Alliance Trust charges \u00a39.99 to buy and sell funds.\n\nInvestors can buy trusts, shares, corporate bonds and ETFs and it is good for monthly regular investors in these too, although dividend reinvestment is pricey. [More details on Alliance Trust Savings].\n\nThe Share Centre - Self-Select Isa\n\nThe Share Centre offers investors a full DIY choice in its Self Select Stocks and Shares Isa. It allows investors to hold funds, investment trusts, shares, ETFs and corporate bonds, but charges a monthly fee of \u00a34.80 so \u00a357.60 per year. This will rise to \u00a35 per month or \u00a360 per year from 6 July.\n\nFund, share, ETF, investment trust and corporate bond dealing costs 1 per cent with a \u00a37.50 minimum charge. Alternatively, if you pay \u00a324 a quarter, there is a flat \u00a37.50 buying and selling charge with its trader option.\n\nOnly one live Isa at a time Remember, you can only pay new money into one Isa wrapper each year, but you can keep an old tax year's Isa wrapper open (with no new payments into it) and open a new tax year one, or transfer all your holdings onto the same platform. Beware exit charges typically apply.\n\nRegular monthly investing in funds shares, ETFs, trusts and bonds costs 0.5 per cent (minimum \u00a31).\n\nThe Share Centre offers cost-effective share dividend reinvestment into individual stocks, trusts and ETFs at 0.5 per cent (min \u00a31).\n\nStandard non-Isa dealing: The full DIY Self Select dealing account outside of an Isa carries a \u00a31.80 per month admin fee so \u00a321.60 per year and the same trading fees. This rises to \u00a32 per month on 6 July.\n\nWho is it good for? The Share Centre's flat administration fee makes it a good option for those with more than modest sums - anyone with with just over \u00a312,500 invested will pay less annually here than at Hargreaves Lansdown. That needs to be weighed up against fund dealing charges, however, these could soon rack up if you do much buying and selling.\n\nFor those with large sums invested it could prove good value compared to percentage-based charges even when dealing fees are taken into account, be warned though trading larger sums gets expensive with that 1 per cent charge.\n\nIt's good for stock pickers who reinvest dividend shares, trusts or ETFs and investors looking for a variety of investments, with some good analysis, tips and advice.

This is a low-cost way to build an ETF and share portfolio as long as you are unlikely to want to buy funds.\n\nIf you make three trades a quarter or hold more than \u00a315,000 in the Smart Portfolio service, IG doesn't charge any administration fees or charges to hold an Isa.\n\nShare-dealing is reasonable value at \u00a38.

Active fund investors get a good deal at Charles Stanley with a low annual fee and no buying or selling charges. This is also a decent Sipp option for those with more than \u00a330,000, who can then avoid the extra fee for pensions.\n\nThose buying and holding investment trusts and shares can also do well if they trade each month and lose the platform fee, but that needs to be weighed up against \u00a311.50 dealing charges adding up and the lack of a cut-price regular monthly investing option.
