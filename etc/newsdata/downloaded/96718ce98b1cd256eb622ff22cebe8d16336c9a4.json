For an abrupt shift, it has been a long time coming: Trump\u2019s Syria troop cut in December 2018 was a preview of his intent, which he reiterated this week: \"I campaigned on the fact that I was going to bring our soldiers home.\"\n\nAs to abandoning the Syrian Kurds, the U.S. intention for the region\u2019s Kurds was plain in 2017 when Washington advised the Iraqi Kurds to cancel an independence referendum but stay in Iraq's federal system. Likewise, the Syrian Kurds were encouraged to open negotiations with the Assad regime to secure limited local autonomy, and it sure must be working as the SDF sells the Assad regime oil and natural gas, violating the sanctions on Syria in the process, but getting $378 million a year in oil revenue alone. And these are the \u201cgood guys\u201d\u2026\n\nErdogan is also not a good guy, but Turkey is a NATO ally with more invested in the Syria fight than the U.S., and Turkey\u2019s desire to secure its border and remove the 3.5 million Syrian refugees is totally reasonable as far as Trump is concerned. Erdogan won\u2019t be running Turkey forever, but any successor will be no less equable about U.S. reluctance to endorse its operations against the PKK and to secure its border.\n\nWhat Trump likely wants to do is clear the decks to focus on his highest priorities, the Democrats\u2019 impeachment plans, and his re-election. To that end, he tweeted, \u201cTurkey, Europe, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Russia and the Kurds will now have to figure the situation out\u201d.\n\nThe \u201csituation\u201d includes the Al-Hol refugee camp of 70,000 displaced people, about 30,000 of whom are Islamic State family members; and the SDF camps that hold about 10,000 fighters, many of them foreigners. To underline the President\u2019s tweet, the White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham noted, \u201cTurkey will now be responsible for all ISIS fighters in the area captured over the past two years in the wake of the defeat of the territorial 'Caliphate' by the United States.\"\n\n\u201cThe defeat of the territorial 'Caliphate' was why U.S. troops engaged the Islamic State. Now that the caliphate is no more, the presence of the remaining ISIS sympathizers and family members is properly the concern of the local forces, augmented by U.S. aviation assets if needed.\n\nTurkey, Europe, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Russia, and the Kurds will have to sort as they fight, and the battlefield will be more than the usual chaos with several armies, Russian mercenaries, Iranian-sponsored militias, refugees, and displaced persons moving in every direction amid ruined infrastructure. All in all, it\u2019s a scene Trump thinks the U.S. is wise to avoid.\n\nThe SDF decried Trump\u2019s decision as a \u201cstab in the back\u201d. The Russian response was more muted: a call for the preservation of Syria\u2019s territorial integrity and that all foreign military forces 'with illegal presence' should leave Syria, Moscow is aware that unfortunately its wish was granted: U.S. troops are no longer around.\n\nThe battlefield will be busy but there will be a lot of standing around: the Russians will wait for an opportunity to grab the oil fields to pay for their mercenaries; the Syrians will let the Turks kill Kurdish and SDF fighters to save them the trouble of doing it later; and the Iranians, as always, will fight to the last Arab.\n\nAnd Erdogan will be under the gun: he will meet Trump in Washington, D.C. in November and will have to show results to avoid consequences like Senator Lindsey Graham\u2019s suggestion that Turkey be sanctioned and suspended from NATO.\n\nThe NatSec guys and the media freaked out over the pullback, calling it things like \"a significant shift in U.S. policy\", but it's Trump\u2019s original policy: don't get drawn into someone else\u2019s fights in a region that spawns nothing but grief. In December 2018, the policy took the shape of a troop pullout. This time it was taking advantage of an opportunity not to be the human shields for the SDF and the YPG.\n\nAnd many commentators have neglected to make the distinction between an ally, Turkey, and clients, the SDF and the Kurdish militias: with allies, you have obligations, with clients you have transactions.\n\nSo, while the U.S. may no longer be able to act as an interlocutor between the Kurds and whomever, untoward events, and they will occur, won\u2019t be America\u2019s problem. Trump won ugly in 2016, and he sometimes gets in his own way, but, as Ted Rall observes, though Democrats and legacy Republican leaders attack his foreign policy, voters \u201cmostly approve of his moves to de-escalate tensions overseas and reduce foreign entanglements\u201d.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about the Erdogan, the Islamic State, or the refugees, it\u2019s about a president trying to prioritize and to harness with Damon Linker calls America\u2019s \u201ccontrol freak tendencies\u201d. Let's hope that he succeeds.\n\nJames Durso (@james_durso) is the Managing Director of Corsair LLC.
