Preorders are beginning today, and the actual phones ship in just over a week. So let\u2019s assume your heart is set on a new Pixel phone, and you\u2019re not willing to wait for the reviews. Should you upgrade based on specs alone? And if so, to which?\n\nThe choice isn\u2019t quite as easy as \u201cbig\u201d or \u201csmall\u201d because Google\u2019s new phones are expensive, at $799 and up \u2014 and because the excellent Pixel 3 and Pixel 3A are still sticking around for hundreds of dollars cheaper.\n\nHere\u2019s the full lineup as of today:\n\nPixel 4 : $799 for 64GB, $899 for 128GB\n\n: $799 for 64GB, $899 for 128GB Pixel 4 XL: $899 for 64GB, $999 for 128GB\n\n$899 for 64GB, $999 for 128GB Pixel 3: $499 for 64GB, $599 for 128GB\n\n$499 for 64GB, $599 for 128GB Pixel 3 XL: $599 for 64GB\n\n$599 for 64GB Pixel 3A: $399 for 64GB\n\n$399 for 64GB Pixel 3A XL: $479 for 64GB\n\nIf your budget tops out at $500 or so, we\u2019ve already covered the tradeoffs between the Pixel 3A and Pixel 3, including water resistance, wireless charging, a higher quality screen, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. We\u2019ve also already compared the Pixel 4 to other flagship phones.\n\nSo let\u2019s tackle this another way. What does the Pixel 4 offer (on paper) compared to any previous Pixel? What, if anything, do you give up? Scroll down to the phone you own and see \u2014 and if you don\u2019t see enough differences to satisfy your upgrade itch, you\u2019ll know it\u2019s OK to wait.\n\nPixel 3 and 3 XL\n\nIf you bought a flagship Pixel 3 just last year, it may be tough to justify another purchase so soon \u2014 but the Pixel 4 certainly has plenty of new toys for early adopters, including a bona fide miniature radar for air gestures, a genuine Face ID competitor for unlocking your phone without a fingerprint, a faster screen than ever before, and the second rear camera (with a telephoto lens) that Google always insisted it never needed.\n\nWhat you get with Pixel 4\n\nA second 16MP camera with a telephoto lens\n\nGoogle\u2019s seemingly speedy Face Unlock\n\n90Hz \u201cSmooth Display\u201d with Ambient EQ automatic color temperature\n\nBuilt-in Soli radar sensor for air gestures in apps\n\nSlightly faster processor\n\n2GB of additional memory\n\nDual exposure controls for the camera\n\nSlightly wider f/1.7 aperture on main camera (vs. f/1.8)\n\nSlightly larger screen on the standard Pixel 4 (5.7 inch vs. 5.5 inch)\n\nLarger battery on the Pixel 4 XL (3700mAh vs. 3430mAh)\n\nNew \u201climited edition\u201d orange color option\n\nThe new no-notch design with prominent metal band and camera square\n\nWhat\u2019s the same\n\nGoogle\u2019s excellent 12-megapixel camera (assuming nothing\u2019s changed) with Night Sight\n\nScreen size on the XL (6.3 inches)\n\nHDR support\n\n64 and 128GB storage options\n\nDual stereo speakers\n\n18W fast charging\n\nWireless charging\n\nWater resistance\n\nSqueezable sides to summon the Google Assistant\n\nAndroid 10\n\n4G LTE support on all major US carriers\n\nWhat you lose\n\nFingerprint reader\n\nUnlimited Google Photos uploads at original quality\n\nThe second portrait selfie camera\n\nA tiny bit of space in your pocket (both phones are a tenth of an inch taller and slightly thicker)\n\nBoth phones are half an ounce heavier\n\nThe ability to brag that you only need a single camera instead of a square\n\nThe notched screen on the Pixel 3 XL\n\nPixel 3A and 3A XL\n\nUpgrading from the Pixel 3A and 3A XL is a more intriguing proposition. It came out just five months ago, but perhaps you were tempted by Google\u2019s offer of getting one of Android\u2019s best cameras for $399, liked what you saw, and see your Pixel 3A as a potential hand-me-down? Or perhaps you\u2019re considering the 3A now, and want to see if the Pixel 4 is really worth double the money before you plunk cash down.\n\nWhat you get with Pixel 4\n\nA second 16MP camera with a telephoto lens\n\nGoogle\u2019s seemingly speedy Face Unlock\n\n90Hz \u201cSmooth Display\u201d with Ambient EQ automatic color temperature\n\nBuilt-in Soli radar sensor for air gestures in apps\n\nNotably faster processor (Snapdragon 855 vs Snapdragon 670)\n\nIP68 dust and water resistance\n\nWireless charging\n\nAluminum and glass body (instead of plastic)\n\nPremium OLED screen with HDR support\n\n2GB of additional memory\n\nDual exposure controls for the camera\n\nSlightly wider f/1.7 aperture on main camera (vs. f/1.8)\n\nLarger screen on the Pixel 4 XL (6.3-inch vs. 6.0-inch)\n\nOh-so-slightly larger screen on the standard Pixel 4 (5.6 inch vs. 5.5 inch)\n\nA bit of extra space in your pocket with standard Pixel 4 (two-tenths of an inch shorter and one-tenth narrower)\n\n128GB storage option\n\nNew \u201climited edition\u201d orange color option\n\nThe new design with prominent metal band and camera square\n\nWhat\u2019s the same\n\nGoogle\u2019s excellent 12-megapixel camera (assuming nothing\u2019s changed) with Night Sight\n\nDual stereo speakers\n\n18W fast charging\n\nSqueezable sides to summon the Google Assistant\n\nAndroid 10\n\n4G LTE support on all major US carriers\n\nWhat you lose\n\n3.5mm headphone jack\n\nFingerprint reader\n\nPixel 4 is half an ounce heavier, Pixel 4 XL an ounce heavier than their 3A-gen counterparts\n\nPixel 4 XL is very slightly thicker\n\nBlue color option\n\nThe ability to brag that you only need a single camera instead of a square\n\nPixel 2 and 2 XL\n\nNow we\u2019re in two-year upgrade territory, and the upgrades are more obvious \u2014 with the Pixel 2 and 2 XL, you no longer already possess one of Android\u2019s best cameras nor a recent processor, there\u2019s no headphone jack to tie you down, and the battery on your aging phone is probably feeling a little low. There\u2019s also no simple way to buy the Pixel 2 or Pixel 2 XL new. So let\u2019s talk upgrades, shall we?\n\nWhat you get with Pixel 4\n\nAn upgraded 12MP main camera (assuming nothing\u2019s changed since Pixel 3)\n\nSlightly wider f/1.7 aperture on main camera (vs. f/1.8)\n\nA second 16MP camera with a telephoto lens\n\nGoogle\u2019s seemingly speedy Face Unlock\n\n90Hz \u201cSmooth Display\u201d with Ambient EQ automatic color temperature\n\nBuilt-in Soli radar sensor for air gestures in apps\n\nNotably faster processor (Snapdragon 855 vs Snapdragon 835)\n\nMuch larger 5.7-inch screen for Pixel (vs 5.0-inch)\n\nLarger 6.3-inch screen for Pixel XL (vs. 6.0-inch)\n\nSlightly larger batteries (3700mAh vs. 3520mAh for XL, 2800mAh vs 2700mAh for Pixel)\n\nBetter IP68 dust and water resistance (vs IP67)\n\nWireless charging\n\nPremium OLED screen with HDR support\n\n2GB of additional memory\n\nDual exposure controls for the camera\n\nNew \u201climited edition\u201d orange color option\n\nThe new design with prominent metal band, camera square and full glass back\n\nWhat\u2019s the same\n\nGoogle\u2019s excellent 12-megapixel camera (assuming nothing\u2019s changed) with Night Sight\n\nDual stereo speakers\n\n18W fast charging\n\nSqueezable sides to summon the Google Assistant\n\nAndroid 10\n\n4G LTE support on all major US carriers\n\nWhat you lose\n\nFingerprint reader\n\nA tiny bit of space in your pocket (both phones are a tenth of an inch taller and slightly thicker this gen)\n\nBoth phones are 0.8 oz heavier than their Pixel 2-gen counterparts\n\nBlue color option\n\nThe possibility of dropping your phone on a mostly-metal back instead of guaranteed glass\n\nPixel and Pixel XL\n\nIf you\u2019re still holding onto the three-year-old Pixel or Pixel XL, you\u2019re probably starting to miss out. Yes, you\u2019ve still got a headphone jack, you got the Night Sight camera upgrade, and you\u2019ve probably upgraded to Android 10 by now \u2014 but hardware has marched forward, particularly that camera, and it may be time you did as well.\n\nWhat you get with Pixel 4\n\nAn notably upgraded 12MP main camera with optical image stabilization\n\nWider f/1.7 aperture on main camera (vs. f/2.0)\n\nA second 16MP camera with a telephoto lens\n\nGoogle\u2019s seemingly speedy Face Unlock\n\n90Hz \u201cSmooth Display\u201d with Ambient EQ automatic color temperature\n\nBuilt-in Soli radar sensor for air gestures in apps\n\nMuch faster processor (Snapdragon 855 vs Snapdragon 821)\n\nMuch larger screens (5.7-inch vs. 5.0 inch for regular, 6.3-inch vs. 5.5-inch for XL)\n\nSlightly larger 3700mAh battery on Pixel 4 XL (vs. 3450mAh)\n\nMuch better IP68 dust and water resistance (vs. IP53)\n\nWireless charging\n\nDual stereo speakers (up from just one)\n\nPremium OLED screen with HDR support\n\n2GB of additional memory\n\nDouble the base storage at 64GB\n\nDual exposure controls for the camera\n\nSqueezeable sides to summon the Google Assistant\n\nPixel Visual Core and hardware security module\n\nNew \u201climited edition\u201d orange color option\n\nThe new design with camera square and full glass back\n\nWhat\u2019s the same\n\n18W fast charging\n\nNight Sight camera mode\n\nBattery size (on regular Pixel)\n\nAndroid 10\n\n4G LTE support on all major US carriers\n\nWhat you lose\n\nFingerprint reader\n\n3.5mm headphone jack\n\nA tiny bit of space in your pocket (Pixel 4 is a tenth of an inch taller, Pixel 4 XL is two-tenths)\n\nBoth phones are about 0.8 oz heavier than their Pixel 2-gen counterparts\n\nBlue color option\n\nThe possibility of dropping your phone on a mostly-metal back instead of guaranteed glass", "description": "You might be wondering if the new Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL are enough of an upgrade to justify trading in your existing Pixel phone, or whether you should pick a Pixel 3 or Pixel 3A.
