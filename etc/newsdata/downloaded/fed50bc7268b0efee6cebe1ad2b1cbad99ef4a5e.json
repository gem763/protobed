Cloverdale Mayor Melanie Bagby told Yahoo Finance\u2019s On the Move she doesn\u2019t blame PG&E. \u201cI think that after the initial wave and shock of anger are over, people are really going to need to look at who the regulators were who allowed PG&E to make a lot of bad decisions by not upgrading their infrastructure,\u201d said Bagby, adding that the California Public Utilities Commission should be held accountable because it allowed PG&E to fall behind on necessary power line maintenance.\n\n\u201cThey know that the decisions that were made in the PG&E boardroom to pay out dividends to their investors, instead of investing in their infrastructure, that\u2019s where the blame really lies and of course it lies with the regulators,\u201d Bagby said.\n\nThe \u2018new normal\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\n#PSPS UPDATE: At first light PG&E crews continued inspection and restoration efforts. PG&E has 6,300+ personnel and 44 helicopters engaged in and supporting inspections. https://t.co/X1ClEBDDlC pic.twitter.com/PtuE24LKgX \u2014 PG&E (@PGE4Me) October 11, 2019\n\nWhile PG&E said it had restored power to half its customers Friday, the utility suffered a setback earlier this week in its effort to emerge from bankruptcy. U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Dennis Montali ruled PG&E bondholders can start selling their corporate reorganization plans in direct competition with PG&E which until now had exclusive rights to outline its reorganization.\n\nBagby said none of that addresses what she calls the \u201cnew normal,\u201d which Bagby said threatens the local economy and is unacceptable. \u201cWe can\u2019t take a hit to our economy, who is going to want to invest in businesses here when we know that the power could be undependable,\u201d she asked. \u201cWe\u2019re having a situation with our tourism industry. This is our high season. This is the time when people come to experience crush and harvest at our wineries.\u201d\n\nCloverdale is located north of San Francisco in California\u2019s popular Sonoma County wine country. The city has an entire industry around wine country weddings, Bagby points out. But with intermittent electricity, Bagby said the area is being dealt a double blow.\n\nBagby, who is part of Sonoma Clean Power, an organization dedicated to generating \u201cclean\u201d power to fight climate change, said the time has come to decentralize the electric grid and invest in backup technology. But none of that can happen fast enough to keep the lights on as PG&E plans future blackouts to prevent wildfires and attempts to rebuild its transmission infrastructure.\n\nBagby warned her neighbors and millions of others that they should get ready for several more modern day versions of the dark ages. \u201cI think that after this event, people are going to start realizing that they really need to prepare for five to seven days, and perhaps longer, without power,\u201d she said.\n\nAdam Shapiro is co-anchor of Yahoo Finance On the Move.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "The mayor of Cloverdale California says plenty of people blame troubled utility PG&E for recent blackouts but they should blame the California Public Utilities Commission.", "authors": ["Adam Shapiro"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/DeSTBnZqeUG.peAiuQORPg--~B/aD0yMDAwO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/eced38f0-ec4c-11e9-8f8f-03bfb02fa965", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
