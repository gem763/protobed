Afterward, Cutelaba claimed Saint Preux ducked him for that night, instead opting to fight someone else.\n\nAccording to Saint Preux, though, that wasn\u2019t what went down.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know how to pronounce his name, he was saying, for some reason he was saying that I was ducking him, for the card in Denmark, and that didn\u2019t happen and what not,\u201d Saint Preux told MMA Junkie.\n\nSaint Preux earned a second-round submission win over Michal Oleksiejczuk at UFC on ESPN+ 18, snapping a two-fight losing skid. He remarkably was able to notch yet another patented Von Flue choke, his fourth in the UFC.\n\nCutelaba, meanwhile, rebounded from a loss to Glover Teixeira in emphatic fashion, running through Khalil Rountree for a TKO in the first round.\n\nNow Saint Preux, who\u2019s looking for a quick turnaround, has called Cutelaba out for a fight before the end of the year, and wants on the UFC on ESPN+ 23 card in South Korea on Dec. 21.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take him up on his offer,\u201d Saint Preux said. \u201cSouth Korea card, Dec. 21, I\u2019ll definitely do that one so if he want to fight in 2019, just let him know I\u2019m here.\u201d\n\nFor Saint Preux, who\u2019s been in there with the who\u2019s who of the 205-pound division, including light heavyweight champion Jon Jones, Cutelaba\u2019s frame and power doesn\u2019t intimidate him.\n\nIn fact, he says Cutelaba has never faced anyone as big as him.\n\n\u201cHe can call himself \u2018The Hulk\u2019 or what not, but to be honest if you look at him and myself next to each other, who looks like \u2018The Hulk?'\u201d Saint Preux said. \u201cSo it\u2019s all good. I mean it\u2019s different when you get in there, it\u2019s different. I don\u2019t think he ever got in there with somebody that\u2019s my height, my strength, my size, too.\u201d\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, Cutelaba continues to push for it, as well:", "description": "Ovince Saint Preux wants to face Ion Cutelaba next at UFC on ESPN+ 23 in South Korea.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "Mike Bohn", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Simon Head", "Nolan King"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/ovince-saint-preux-michal-oleksiejczuk-ufc-copenhagen-10.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
