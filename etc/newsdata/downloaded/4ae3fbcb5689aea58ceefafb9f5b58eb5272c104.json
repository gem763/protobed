We were not aware of his prior remarks that have surfaced over the past few days. The language he used is offensive, hurtful and unacceptable. We are sorry that we did not see these clips earlier, and that our vetting process was not up to our standard.\u201d\n\nIn the 2018 clip from \u201cMatt and Shane\u2019s Secret Podcast,\u201d uncovered Thursday by freelance comedy writer Seth Simons, Gillis and co-host Matt McCusker repeatedly mock people of Chinese descent, denigrating their accents and calling Chinatown \u201cfucking nuts\u201d and \u201cfull fucking China.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet the fucking chinks live there,\u201d Gillis says in the clip.\n\nHe goes on to say that \u201can Asian trying to learn English\u201d bothers him more than \u201cany other minority playing music in a restaurant loud on their phone.\u201d\n\nLater, he describes his racist jokes as \u201cnice racism, good racism.\u201d\n\nThe original video has since been deleted.\n\nJeff Kravitz via Getty Images Shane Gillis performs onstage at the 2019 Clusterfest in San Francisco.\n\nVulture reported Thursday night that on another episode of the podcast, Gillis and McCusker created a \u201chierarchy of stand-up comedy\u201d based on race, gender and sexual orientation. They also used homophobic and misogynist slurs to mock comedians who have spoken openly about their mental health struggles, including Chris Gethard and Judd Apatow \u2014 calling them \u201cwhite faggot comics\u201d and \u201cfucking gayer than ISIS.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like pussy white comedians,\u201d McCusker says in the clip. \u201cI hate the celebration of some dude just being a total pussy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel you, dude,\u201d Gillis says. \u201cI really don\u2019t like the celebration of a guy being like, \u2018So, I\u2019m depressed.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe revelations about Gillis were particularly galling given that among the show\u2019s other new cast members announced Thursday was \u201cSNL\u201d writer Bowen Yang \u2014 the show\u2019s first Chinese American cast member and one of only a handful of Asian and LGBTQ stars in the history of the long-running late night show, which has repeatedly struggled with diversity and inclusion.\n\nOn Thursday night, Gillis issued a nonapology \u201cto anyone who\u2019s actually offended.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy to apologize to anyone who\u2019s actually offended by anything I\u2019ve said,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cMy intention is never to hurt anyone but I am trying to be the best comedian I can be and sometimes that requires risks.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a comedian who was funny enough to get 'SNL.' That can\u2019t be taken away. \u2026 I was always a \u2018Mad TV\u2019 guy anyway.\u201d Shane Gillis, referring to another sketch show\n\nGillis\u2019 history of offensive comments raises questions about the show\u2019s vetting process.\n\nComedians in Philadelphia, where Gillis worked for several years, repeatedly raised red flags about him and were surprised to learn Thursday that \u201cSNL\u201d cast him, according to Vulture.\n\nKate Banford, co-owner of Good Good Comedy Theatre, told Vulture that the venue \u201cstopped working with him within the past few years because of racist, homophobic, and sexist things he\u2019s said on and offstage.\u201d\n\nGillis responded to his firing by continuing to defend himself and saying that remaining on the show \u201cwould be too much of a distraction.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a comedian who was funny enough to get SNL. That can\u2019t be taken away,\u201d he said Monday in a statement. \u201cOf course I wanted an opportunity to prove myself at SNL, but I understand it would be too much of a distraction. I respect the decision they made. I\u2019m honestly grateful for the opportunity. I was always a mad tv guy anyway.\u201d\n\nThis article has been updated with Gillis\u2019 statement.", "description": "Shane Gillis directed the slurs at people of Chinese descent and mocked comedians who have spoken about mental health.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7b860b240000d326795c87.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
