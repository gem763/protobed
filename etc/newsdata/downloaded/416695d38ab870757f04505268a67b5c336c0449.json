(WRK) shares and lock in a 5% dividend yield, asserts Ian Wyatt, growth and income expert and editor of High Yield Wealth.\n\nWestRock is a dividend grower; that high yield is only the start. It is also the largest pulp and packaging company in the country. Size is an advantage in a business with high fixed costs like paper-and-pulp production.\n\nAfter Rock-Tenn and MeadWestvaco combined in 2015 to form WestRock, $1 billion of annual expenses have been purged from the business.\n\nMore from Ian Wyatt: Illumina: Shining a Light on Gene Sequencing\n\nThe more efficient you run, the more customers you attract. WestRock sold $16.3 billion of its paper and packaging products in fiscal-year 2018 (which ended in September). Annual revenue has grown by $6 billion annually since the merger.\n\nWestRock shares are down 43% compared with the price a year ago. Global growth worries and consumer spending trends weigh on paper-company shares (and the market as a whole).\n\nThe near-term industry outlook is weak, but WestRock\u2019s business is strong. Cash flow is worth highlighting. It is the key metric in the paper-products industry. WestRock\u2019s free-cash-flow yield exceeds 10%. The yield provides ample support for the current dividend and future increases.\n\nAnalysts give considerable weight to the EV/EBITDA multiple. WestRock\u2019s EV (equity value plus debt less cash on hand) is $18.7 billion. EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) was $2.95 billion for the trailing 12 months.\n\nWestRock is valued at 6.3 times EBITDA, which isn\u2019t much. The shares trade at a discount to its three-year EV/EBITDA multiple of 7.0. The shares trade at a wide discount to the peer-group multiple of 8.6.\n\nSee also: Small Cap Exposure with Global X Russell 2000 Cover Call ETF\n\nManagement guided for EBITDA to post between $880 million and $925 million for the fourth quarter. This compares favorably with EBITDA of $858 million in the third quarter and $802 million in the year-ago quarter.\n\nWestRock CFO Ward Dickson chimed in with his bullish perspective. \u201cTo be clear, we will generate a lot of free cash flow in this business,\u201d said Dickson. \u201cWe will invest over $1 billion in these projects. And they are going to generate approximately $240 million worth of incremental EBITDA that will flow through to both earnings and cash flow generation for us.\u201d\n\nDickson added, \u201cWe do believe that the dividend yield and the free cash flow yield of WestRock is one of the compelling points of our valuation.\u201d We concur. WestRock trades at dirt-cheap multiples compared with its historical multiples and those of its peer group.\n\nMore From MoneyShow.com:", "description": "You can still buy WestRock Co.
