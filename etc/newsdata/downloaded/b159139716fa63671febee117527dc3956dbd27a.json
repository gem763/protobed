Nevertheless, anti-Trump folks of all political persuations love tossing them around as a way of signaling their \u201cvirtue\u201d to the rest of us.\n\n\u201cMuh principles!\u201d bleats the #NeverTrump \u201cRepublican,\u201d as if they are some sort of special light shining in a Trumpian-world-gone-mad.\n\n\u201cMuh values!\u201d screeches the open-borders leftist politician, as if letting the entire Third World come to America is the definition of \u201cloving thy neighbor.\u201d\n\n\u201cMuh morality!\u201d shrieks all of them, yet the \u201cNew Morality\u201d they espouse has nothing to do with the God of the Bible (its original author) and everything to do with achieving power for the left.\n\nIn an age where real virtue is a rarity, yet our leftist would-be rulers love signaling, nay proclaiming theirs from the rooftops, one might be forgiven for being even temporarily fooled by it all. Maybe Nancy Pelosi really IS a good person when she lectures us about border walls being \u201cimmoral.\u201d Maybe Saint Pete really does have the hot new take on \u201cvalues.\u201d Maybe the likes of Joe Walsh, Bill Kristol, George Will, and John Pavlovitz - randomly selected Trump haters all - really DO put the \u201cprinciples\u201d they supposedly have first, and that\u2019s why they oppose the president at seemingly every turn.\n\nEspecially given a leftist-controlled mainstream press all-too-willing to portray the president as a monster and his policies as monstrous, you may be forgiven for thinking all of those things. But the reality, however, is actually the exact opposite of what they would have you believe. In fact, it is Trump\u2019s supporters who truly have every inch of the moral high ground. In fact, it is Trump\u2019s policies that are the very definition of objective principles, morals, and values, even if his presentation at times gives his haters ammunition by seeming to belie that fact.\n\nConsider the three \u201cunalienable rights\u201d the Declaration of Independence acknowledges as having come to humans unconditionally from their Creator - life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness:\n\nLife\n\nIt\u2019s a pretty good place to start, especially considering we\u2019re dealing with a literal death cult that relishes the notion of killing as many unborn babies as possible. Start there, and any attempts they make to portray themselves as \u201cgood people\u201d fall flat, but there\u2019s oh so much more. Consider communism, you know, the ideology whose adherents gleefully murdered over 100 million people over the last century. Ever hear these would-be paragons of morality condemning communism these days? No? Could that be because they want to give it another try but don\u2019t want to be so obvious about it? Could it be because the socialism they espouse is but a mere step away from the totalitarian kind of communism that slays millions in the name of \u201cequality\u201d?\n\nEvery time these jackals politicize mass shootings to call for more gun control, remember that they really don\u2019t care about any of the lives such legislation would save, especially considering they know full well the legislation they espouse wouldn\u2019t actually save any lives. In their unquenchable thirst for control, leftists would happily take away the right to defend oneself against rogue criminals or rogue governments. They cry alligator tears at the deaths of gun victims while ignoring those who successfully defend themselves with guns or the unarmed who die from a senseless home invasion.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s their relentless calls for unlimited immigration from the Third World, ignoring the plight of the American middle and lower classes, despite the fact that Third Worlders would be better served by helping them there instead of bringing them here. It\u2019s all for power, of course, because they know these folks tend to lean left, but they pretend it\u2019s about \u201cmorality.\u201d\n\nLiberty & the Pursuit of Happiness\n\nWhether it\u2019s the liberty to defend yourself, make your own decisions, run your business as you see fit, or even keep most of your own earnings, it\u2019s no secret that leftists want to take it all away (except for certain, leftist-approved \u201cliberties\u201d like \u201cchanging\u201d sexes and murdering unborn babies, of course). In other words, the liberty issue is a slam dunk for a belief system that generally believes the fundamental concept of individual liberties. Want to keep a rogue government from running roughshod over and even murdering millions of its own citizens? Allow citizens to own guns. And if you have a problem with this, dear Leftist, what are you afraid of?\n\nThe liberty to pursue happiness according to one\u2019s own bent, so long as it doesn\u2019t infringe on the rights of others, is ingrained in our nation\u2019s founding documents, and yet leftists would take all that away if they could.\n\nBottom line: Those who refuse to support President Trump based on optics alone are completely missing the big picture. Whether you consider some of his tweets and comments \u201cpresidential\u201d or not, the policies Trump espouses and helps to implement through executive orders, signed legislation, and appointing judges result in by far the greatest good for the greatest number of people, full stop.\n\nNo, there\u2019s no reason why we should ever cede one inch of moral high ground to godless leftists, ever.", "description": "Despite the fact that roughly three out of four evangelical .09/02/2019 2:58:26AM EST.", "authors": ["Scott Morefield", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/228/84724932-8ba7-493c-bced-9ce63aa2e19c.png"}
