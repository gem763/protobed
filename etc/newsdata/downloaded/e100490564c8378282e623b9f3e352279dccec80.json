But how they talk to their children about the all of their choices \u2014 Ivy League, state university, community college, trade school, coding boot camp or even no postsecondary education at all (gap year or straight to work) \u2014 can determine whether these 18-year-olds ultimately succeed or fail.\n\nAnd failure is costly. At least 40% of students don\u2019t graduate from four-year schools within six years, and those who don\u2019t graduate and took on debt are three times more likely than those who graduated to default on their loans.\n\nAfter collecting and analyzing more than 200 personal stories and surveys of more than 1,000 students who have chosen different paths for higher education, we developed a set of guidelines for parents \u2014 and mistakes they sometimes make. Here are six common ones to avoid:\n\n1. Paying too close attention to the college rankings lists\n\nStudents already feel enough pressure around the college-choosing process. Using the various rankings of best colleges to create a list of which colleges your child should visit or apply to only amps it up. What\u2019s more, the rankings don\u2019t correspond to what your child is trying to accomplish. Quality and value aren\u2019t absolute, as they can only be measured in relation to why someone is choosing something, the outcome they desire and their circumstance that defines what is a good or bad choice.\n\nBlindly following the rankings can cause your child to pursue a host of choices that might look good to society at large, but will be a bad fit for your child\u2019s specific circumstance.\n\n2. Using your criteria to select college options, not your child\u2019s\n\nA close cousin of using the rankings to form your child\u2019s college list is using your own criteria. It is your child who will be going to school, not you. If you pick your child\u2019s school or major and it doesn\u2019t match her ability or interest, you\u2019re setting her up for a bad experience. Instead, help your child define what is important and what is a nonstarter \u2014 for her.\n\n3. Forcing your child to go to college\n\nNot everyone is ready for college right away. In our research, we learned that when students attended school just to appease a parent, the outcomes were bad \u2014 74% of the students we interviewed dropped out or transferred.\n\nHere\u2019s the bottom line: Do not force someone to go to college for its own sake without their having a sense of excitement, passion or purpose.\n\nIn a similar vein, some students are ready for college, but if they don\u2019t get into their top choice or \u201cdream\u201d schools, parents often encourage (aka force) them to apply to a bunch of schools that don\u2019t excite them and are not in line with their passions and abilities (see above).\n\nInstead, parents can help them broaden their options for what they could do next, including options like a college alternative program or a discovery gap year filled with jobs, internships and apprenticeships, community service and short courses at a coding bootcamp, online program or community college.\n\n4. Requiring that your child stay at (or close to) home\n\nThe flip side of forcing your child to go to college is forcing your child to stay at home.\n\nMany students feel the need to get away from their hometown or family when they graduate high school. But their parents don\u2019t allow them the option. They force them to apply only to local schools or sometimes don\u2019t even allow them to go to college at all.\n\nIf you see that your child needs to \u201cget away\u201d but cost is a countervailing consideration, use sites like Edmit and TuitionFit to see what you might be able to afford \u2014 or get creative and offer your child the ability to attend locally with the promise that you won\u2019t snoop, interfere or visit uninvited.\n\nJossey-Bass\n\n5. Encouraging your child to bite off more than she can chew\n\nIf your child does need to get away (in other words, that is her primary goal for going to college), make sure that, in so doing, she doesn\u2019t bite off more than she can chew.\n\nWhatever your child does next should probably be short and low-cost because right now she isn\u2019t choosing college for the experience she will have there, or to necessarily pursue a career. If after she\u2019s gotten away, she finds herself trapped at a school that doesn\u2019t correspond with what she wants to do next \u2014 as often happens in this circumstance \u2014 trouble abounds.\n\nCombining our advice in mistakes 3 and 4, allow her to get away, but don\u2019t force her to go to college.\n\n6. Making the decision for your child\n\nAs your child struggles to improve her life, don\u2019t help her \u201cavoid\u201d that struggle until she has wrestled with the full dimension of it. Depriving your child of the opportunity to do things for herself, wrestle with her own problems and learn from her mistakes takes away an opportunity to grow, learn and innovate in her life. Instead, coach your child through the decisions and make the trade-offs that your child will face explicit\u2014and let her choose.\n\nChoosing whether and where to go to college is a challenging process. Encouraging your child to make her choice based on your own or society\u2019s assumptions about the ideal college experience or career choice can set her up for failure. Make sure your child chooses the right college, at the right time, for her own unique circumstance.\n\nNow read: This college professor spills 6 secrets that every freshman should know\n\nMichael B.
