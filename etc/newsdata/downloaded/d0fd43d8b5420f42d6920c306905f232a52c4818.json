Subsequent changes in holdings or intentions must be reported in amended filings. This material has been extracted from filings released by the SEC from Aug. 29 through Sept. 4, 2019. Source: InsiderScore.com\n\nLumber Liquidators (LL)\n\nF9 Investment revealed on Sept. 3 that it possessed 2,212,367 shares of the hardwood-flooring retailer, equal to 7.7% of the outstanding stock, inclusive of 500,000 shares underlying exercisable options. That stake includes 1,346,240 common shares purchased from Aug. 7 to Aug. 16 at an average price of $7.88 apiece.\n\nF9 is a registered investment advisor founded and managed by Thomas Sullivan, CEO of privately held Cabinets to Go, who desires to engage Lumber Liquidators to \u201cdiscuss strategic alternatives.\u201d Specifically, F9 is interested in two objectives: either the sale of Lumber Liquidators where F9 may participate as a buyer or investor, or the potential merger with Cabinets to Go.\n\nF9 also cited that it may reach out to other stockholders and interested parties and enter nondisclosure agreements or financial arrangements as needed as it relates to the above, though no specific plan or proposal has been adopted by F9.\n\n\n\nTailored Brands (TLRD)\n\nScion Asset Management disclosed a 5.1% interest in the apparel retailer, equal to 2,600,000 shares, on Aug. 30. That figure includes 750,000 purchased during the period of July 2 through Aug. 27 at per share prices of $4.30 to $5.94.\n\nScion had addressed Tailored Brands\u2019 board by letter on three separate occasions in August, stating and reiterating that the best route to enhance shareholder value is to cease paying out a stock dividend and instead repurchase stock. Tailored Brand\u2019s common stock on the open market. Scion believes that such a move is a \u201cmore efficient manner to reward long-term shareholders when [Tailored Brands\u2019] share price is heavily discounted,\u201d largely traceable to what Scion believes was the misallocation of capital to fund Tailored Brands\u2019 $1.8 billion acquisition of Jos. A. Banks in 2014 that has long constrained Tailored\u2019s finances.\n\nThe final letter, dated Aug. 30, concerned speculation that Sycamore Partners had approached Tailored Brands with an acquisition offer that valued each\n\nTailored Brands share at $10, a figure that Scion contends undervalues the retailer and \u201cwill not be acceptable to shareholders.\u201d\n\nScion again urged Tailored Brands\u2019 board and management that a stock buyback would be the best move going forward, and if Tailored Brands is \u201cconsidering asset sales,\u201d it should focus on the domestic business and look to sell its Canada operations, using those potential proceeds to help initiate or accelerate the suggested repurchase authorization.\n\nOriginal Filings\n\nBraemar Hotels & Resorts (BHR)\n\nAL Shams Investments disclosed on Aug. 29 an initial position of 3,075,194 shares of the hotel and resort operator, equal to nearly 9.3% of the outstanding stock.\n\nThe stake includes 775,194 shares purchased from June 25 to Aug. 19 at a price range of $8.78 to $9.94 apiece.

The higher stake resulted from the purchase of 452,000 shares from Aug. 21 through Aug. 28 at per share prices of $7.07 to $7.95 and gives Standard General a 20% interest in the stock.\n\nDecreases in Holdings\n\nCampbell Soup (CPB)\n\nThird Point reported on Sept. 4 a lowered position of 17,290,000 shares of the food-and-beverage maker.

While the founders have done an excellent job of building this business, the company is in a transition period where its hyper-growth period has slowed and the margins have not yet caught up, resulting in poor stock performance. There are two paths to value. First, there is an opportunity to improve margins. Technology companies like this generally have a rule of 40\u2014where a combination of growth and operating margins should equal or exceed 40%. At 13% growth and 0% margins, Box has room for improvement. Second, this company could be a valuable strategic asset for large tech companies such as IBM , Salesforce, and Microsoft. Founder-led companies like this are often activist targets because the visionaries who created the company may not be the best people to operate it when it gets to 2,000 employees. Based on a recent shareholder vote, many shareholders would welcome change.\n\n-Kenneth Squire\n\nThe 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund run by an affiliate of the author and not connected to Barron\u2019s, has a long position in Box.
