But like many of you i get on a flight and attract them like a magnet does iron filings. There i am mumbling softly, don\u2019t stop, don\u2019t stop, please don\u2019t stop, keep walking to every mother with a babe in arms but just before the \u2018boarding complete\u2019 announcement comes this one straggler mumsie with baby in tow and she slows down right next to me and says, is this 21B and woe is me, yes, it is.\n\nBut babies you can still take because the parents are already frazzled and it\u2019s only a question of time before one starts howling and dominoes all the others to join in the orchestra and so what if it is five in the morning they compete with Placido Domingo and then some. Babies are still babies, it is the pre-teens and nasty 8 year olds that get your murderous gene awake and kicking. First, they run up and down the aisle aimlessly and drive everyone crazy. Then they pat you on the back of your head with the occasional slap for good measure or as it has occurred, pull at your hair. And once or twice you grin and bear it, till the pats turn to little whacks and they persevere in their assaults with the tenacity of a housefly.\n\nThere is also some chemistry that makes parents of such kids impervious to their inflight nuisance value. You try to tell the parents to please control your kids and all you get is an indulgent smile with perhaps some indepth data about how Bittu beta is very nhutkhut (naughty). This information is imparted to you with a pride you do not share. Some of us are braver and now you take the law into your own hands and since ma and pa are obviously Bittu bhakts you tell the kid to back off and sit down. This blows apart the parental benevolence and they now stare daggers drawn at you and listlessly tell Bittu to sit down, bad and unreasonable man is getting angry.\n\nUnreasonable man once tripped such a pest while the child was on his 17th lap of the aisle and he went sprawling and began to scream and mum and dad complained to the purser who punished me by making me change my seat and on the way said, thanks so much.", "description": "If there was an airline that had a separate cabin for kids and mums with babies i would take it. i have nothing against babies having been one myself.
