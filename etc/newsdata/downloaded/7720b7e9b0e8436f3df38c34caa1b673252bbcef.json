In the chart we see a pre-crisis link between inflation and growth \u2013 GDP peaks are followed by inflation peaks. The central bank balance sheet sat at around 11 per cent of GDP and had no evident role in this. Since then, the ECB balance sheet has been raised in three stages to 40 per cent of Europe\u2019s GDP \u2013 the third phase being the largest. However, even this unprecedented dose of the medicine was not enough to avoid inflation falling below the 2 per cent target. The recovery was weak, and now GDP growth is fading once more.\n\nSo, QE doesn\u2019t work very well. Nor should we expect it to. After all, the interbank market is a \u2018between-the-banks\u2019 kind of thing. It has no direct links with real savers and investors.\n\nSince the exchange rate is the relative price of two monies, QE might work as a devaluation tool (though this motivation is always denied). Mario Draghi was beaten to it by the US and Japan. AP\n\nSo, how did the benefits and costs of \u2018dosing up\u2019 on QE compare?\n\nDid Draghi save the euro? Well sort of. It\u2019s still there with all its basic problems. Germany doesn\u2019t want to expand fiscal policy and issue deficit bonds. It runs budget surpluses. Its current account surplus and capital inflows from other European countries (that want to hold safe German assets) is not matched by any equal German demand to acquire foreign assets. With no exchange rates to adjust supply and demand, the gap is plugged by Germany via official financing between central banks.\n\nThis has resulted in the Bundesbank acquiring claims on other euro central banks to the tune of \u20ac900 billion (and rising). It earns nothing or even negative returns on these balances. It also risks not getting its money back were some members to leave the euro one day. This state-of-affairs is one of the main sources of tension inside the ECB Governing Council.\n\nThe policy also entrenches the euro as the main cause of Europe\u2019s woes. The euro forces competitive adjustment through labour markets, and there is no fiscal union to facilitate cross-country compensation for losing households in the south.\n\nDid the ECB manage to improve the euro\u2019s competitiveness? Central bank liabilities are \u2018money\u2019 (currency and the reserve accounts of banks). Since the exchange rate is the relative price of two monies, QE might work as a devaluation tool (though this motivation is always denied). The trouble for Draghi was that the US and (especially) Japan beat him to it. With everyone doing the same thing, the ECB policy only managed to keep the real value of the euro stable. In 2019 it is where it was when Draghi took office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it\u2019s worse than that. QE has the unintended consequence of under-pricing of risk \u2013the very cause of the last crisis. QE lowers the risk premium on securities in the economy. If one reduces private holdings of securities in favour of safe cash, then bond risk premiums fall. Combined with low short-term interest rates, yield curves can invert. Long-term rates can become negative. Imagine! Paying the government for the privilege of lending to it.\n\nSome central banks think all this is a good thing for real investment and growth. No, it isn\u2019t. Investors are forced into equities and high-credit-risk assets driving down yields there too. This is secondary market price action. As I have explained before in these pages, this raises no new capital for investment. Only IPOs and primary bond markets can do that.\n\nQE pushes up asset prices, encourages leverage, destroys the interbank market and takes pressure off governments to act on fiscal policy. Draghi\u2019s last speech passes this last important task to his successor. Madame Lagarde must understand some of the lessons of the Draghi years.\n\nAustralia\u2019s exchange rate works just fine and we never had Europe\u2019s banking disaster. As our growth fades too (for different reasons) the last thing we should be doing is combining Germany\u2019s fiscal thinking (surpluses) with the ECB\u2019s QE philosophy.\n\nWe must hope that our politicians are thoughtfully pondering some of the lessons of the Draghi years.", "description": "QE did not really work and is full of unintended consequences.
