After that, the makeup of the court felt off, Ginsburg told a crowd in North Little Rock, Ark.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cThere was something wrong with the picture,\u201d she continued. \u201cThe public would see these eight rather well-fed men coming on the bench ...\u201d\n\nGinsburg was cut off by loud laughter and applause that lasted several seconds before she could speak again: \u201cand then there was this rather small woman.\u201d\n\nAt an event Tuesday night hosted by the Clinton Foundation and Clinton School of Public Service, Ginsburg recalled sometimes feeling overlooked \u2014 from her time as a law faculty member to her time as the sole female justice.\n\nShe would make a comment. No reaction. Then one of her male colleagues would say the same thing, Ginsburg said, and people would respond, \u201cThat\u2019s a good idea. Let\u2019s discuss it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don't expect very much from women, so you kind of tune out when she speaks. But you listen when a man speaks,\u201d she said. \u201cNow that I have two sisters in law, it doesn't happen.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

They were the opposite of \u201cshrinking violets,\u201d Ginsburg said, and some of the challenges she and O\u2019Connor experienced began to ease. That made her optimistic for the future, she added.\n\nGinsburg was one of nine women in her class at Harvard Law School, co-founded the Women\u2019s Rights Project of the American Civil Liberties Union in 1971 and argued several gender discrimination cases, one of which was the focus of the biographical legal drama \u201cOn the Basis of Sex.\u201d\n\nThe justice spent the night sharing anecdotes of her historic career. She talked about her camaraderie with O\u2019Connor and her decades-long friendship with late Justice Antonin Scalia.\n\nShe touched on her first meeting with former President Bill Clinton, who introduced her at the Tuesday event: \u201cI've had the experience with some men that they have certain discomfort talking to a woman. That was not that way with President Clinton.\u201d\n\nAnd she again reaffirmed her health after finishing radiation therapy less than two weeks ago for pancreatic cancer. Ginsburg, who has battled various illnesses over the years, said following a standing ovation: \u201cI am feeling very good tonight.\u201d", "description": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg looks back on years of working with \u201ceight rather well-fed men.\u201d", "authors": ["Rishika Dugyala"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/f5/44/4b34ddf4461da0d4bd31a58a6525/20190903-rbg-sits-ap-773.jpg"}
