Bitfinex claimed that Crypto Capital spread the firm\u2019s funds across multiple bank accounts in several countries, making it difficult to access.\n\nBitfinex explained that the Panama-based payments processor processed funds for and on behalf of Bitfinex for years and that Bitfinex was relying upon its representations, including those by executive Oz Yosef, which eventually turned out to be misleading. The exchange claimed:\n\n\u201cAmong those misrepresentations, Crypto Capital regularly referred to its integrity, banking expertise, robust compliance programme and financial licences. This was designed to assure us that Crypto Capital was capable of handling Bitfinex's transactions.\u201d\n\nBitfinex previously claimed that any allegation that Crypto Capital laundered illicit funds upon request of Bitfinex or its customers is \u201ccategorically false.\u201d\n\nPresident of Crypto Capital arrested in Poland\n\nIvan Manuel Molina Lee, the president of Crypto Capital, was arrested by Polish authorities on Oct. 24 on suspicion of money laundering and being involved in an international drug cartel. Lee was detained on a European Arrest Warrant issued by the prosecutor's office in Wroc\u0142aw. His arrest is reportedly connected to $350 million that was previously seized by the Polish Ministry of Justice.", "description": "Crypto Capital executive Oz Yosef, who is allegedly involved in Bitfinex\u2019s $850 million loss, has been indicted on three criminal counts", "authors": ["Joeri Cant"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy9kYzY1MTE1ZWI2NTk5ZDI0Njk1YjA2NGFhZjhiNGIxZi5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
