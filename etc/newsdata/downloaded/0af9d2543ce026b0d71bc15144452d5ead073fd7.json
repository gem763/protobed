GQ Awards 2018: Best-dressed celebrities 1/25 Rosie Huntington-Whiteley Vintage Versace never looked so good. The British model-turned-lingerie designer proved that a bondage-style neckline needn't be anything other than classy when worn in the right way. Paired with a Bardot-style hairdo, Huntington-Whiteley looked like the ultimate Hollywood heroine. Rex Features 2/25 Jeff Goldblum and Emilie Livingston Goldblum's effervescent charm is apparent even in his outfit choices, which are typically as buoyant as the man himself. This look is no different, which comes complete with a brassy golden blazer and zebra-print loafers, for good measure. Emilie Livingston's multi-coloured slip dress offsets the subtle quirks of her husband's idiosyncratic ensemble. Rex Features 3/25 Tom Hiddleston Velvet may be a frequently-worn fabric at fancy events, but Hiddleston elevates the material with his brooding stare and tousled hair, which channels a pleasing 'I just returned from my gap year and wound up on a red carpet' vibe. Rex Features 4/25 Kate Beckinsale The Amazonian beauty of Beckinsale is undeniable, as this look proves. What this Julien Macdonald gown lacks in fabric, it makes up for in pure, unbridled sass. Who else could pull off the garish prints and daring cutaways without looking like a Coachella clich\u00e9 gone awry? Few people spring to mind. Rex Features 5/25 Naomi Campbell Versace, Versace, Versace. If anyone can pull off the space-age patterns on this dress with nothing but knee-high boots to lower the 'look at me' tone, it's Campbell, who took home the award for fashion icon on the night, obviously. Rex Features 6/25 Gemma Chan When it comes to red carpet dressing, few carry the infallible charm of Chan, whose elfin-like features and lithe frame are perfectly suited to this burgundy ensemble by Jason Wu. Rex Features 7/25 Chrissy Teigen and John Legend Hollywood's dynamic duo radiated in tandem on the red carpet, with Teigen going full-blown sparkle in a silver tassel gown by Labourjoisie while her chart-topping musician husband opted for a blue velvet tuxedo by Hugo Boss. Rex Features 8/25 Professor Green Once reserved for army pants and military garb, camouflage is back on trend for the impending autumn/winter season - and Professor Green knows what's up. The British rapper donned an all-camo suit for the ceremony, worn over a classic black tee and a simple silver chain necklace. Rex Features 9/25 Dua Lipa The British singer was the ultimate Saint Laurent muse in this leopard one-shouldered mini dress. Picking up the award for best solo artist, the 23-year-old is clearly making waves for both her musical and sartorial prowess. Rex Features 10/25 Chris Hemsworth The Australian actor championed a James Bond-style aesthetic in this simple, but effective, black tuxedo, paired with a classic white collared shirt. Rex Features 11/25 Kylie Minogue Looking like a water nymph born of Aphrodite, the iconic singer turned heads on the red carpet in a slick metallic gown by Versace that she quite rightly left undeterred with minimal accessories. Rex Features 12/25 Chadwick Boseman The 'Black Panther' actor was awarded the gong for international man, having stolen the hearts of fans and critics everywhere for his role in the highly-acclaimed superhero flick. On the night itself, the American actor donned a slick, off-white tuxedo, paired with some box-fresh white trainers for a casual vibe. Rex Features 13/25 Olly Alexander The Years & Years lead singer might not have won any awards on the night, but he's certainly deserving of an accolade for his sartorial verve as illustrated via this quirky ensemble, complete with low-rise trousers and a cropped feathered corset, naturally. Rex Features 14/25 David Gandy The British model and fashion designer knows a thing or two about dressing himself and typically does so with aplomb. This outfit is no exception, in which the 38-year-old has embraced a 50 shades of blue aesthetic, pairing his navy tuxedo with a paler linen shirt that wouldn't go amiss on a beach in the Caribbean. Rex Features 15/25 Susanna Reid The 'Good Morning Britain' host was a lady in red at last night's ceremony, donning a scarlet satin gown that perfectly complemented her glowing - and enviably ageless - complexion. Rex Features 16/25 Johnny Marr The former Smiths frontman took home one of the most prestigious awards of the night for lifetime achievement. In true rock n' roller style, the English musician opted for a stiff leather biker jacket, providing a splash of panache to his otherwise fairly monotonous ensemble. Rex Features 17/25 Donatella Versace Naturally, the inimitable Italian fashion designer donned a flamboyant gown from her eponymous label for the evening, which, in true Donatella fashion, was a cacophonous clash of gaudy colours and textures. Rex Features 18/25 Laura Whitmore The Irish presenter is no stranger to a red carpet affair as she proved on Wednesday evening, donning a velvet off-the-shoulder cocktail dress by British designer Erdem - a firm favourite among the royal family. Rex Features 19/25 Daniel Kaluuya The 'Get Out' star fixed up and looked sharp on the red carpet in an Aegean blue suit before picking up the prestigious award for best actor. Rex Features 20/25 Jorja Smith Before taking home the award for breakthrough solo artist, the British singer sparkled in a deep violet mini dress by Versace paired with a simple pair of studded stilettos. Rex Features 21/25 Rita Ora Dressed to the nines in a sheer off-the-shoulder gown by British couture house Ralph and Russo, Ora struck a sharp silhouette. The singer-turned-TV presenter added a splash of sartorial salaciousness to her look via visible stockings and suspenders: ooh la la, indeed. Rex Features 22/25 Isla Fisher If you're going to wear couture, you might as well wear it to the GQ Awards, where the dress code is as fluid as it is eclectic. Opting for an all-black Alberta Ferretti gown, the Australian actor's vermilion locks took centre stage, providing a healthy splash of colour to her ensemble. Rex Features 23/25 Zendaya Purple and yellow make for a perfect colour storm, as Zendaya demonstrates in this Ralph and Russo gown. The 22-year-old actor looked far beyond her years in this sophisticated silhouette. Rex Features 24/25 Rose McGowan Who knew that head-to-toe tin foil could work in jacket form? Evidently, as the American actor shows, it can create quite the statement, particularly when paired with the stripped bare - and slightly 80s - aesthetic of McGowan's platinum buzzcut. Rex Features 25/25 Erin O'Connor Once a supermodel, always a supermodel. O'Connor is someone who really could wear a bin bag and make it look like couture. However, despite her unique sartorial capabilities, the British model decided not to be quite so subversive on this occasion, choosing to elevate a simple black trouser, white shirt look with a stunning floral overcoat by Erdem. Rex Features 1/25 Rosie Huntington-Whiteley Vintage Versace never looked so good. The British model-turned-lingerie designer proved that a bondage-style neckline needn't be anything other than classy when worn in the right way. Paired with a Bardot-style hairdo, Huntington-Whiteley looked like the ultimate Hollywood heroine.
