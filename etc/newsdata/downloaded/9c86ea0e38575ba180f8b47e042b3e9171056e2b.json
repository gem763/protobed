If you were a cisgender male (assigned male at birth and identifying as male) but referred to as she/her, you'd be uncomfortable, right? Now, turn that into empathy for us.#PronounsDay \u2014 Charlotte Clymer\ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08 (@cmclymer) October 16, 2019\n\nDear Concerned, Please address people with the name(s) and pronoun(s) they request.

Today is a chance for us to make respecting, sharing and educating about personal pronouns more commonplace. Referring to people by the pronouns they determine for themselves is basic to human dignity.#PronounsDay #PronounsDay19 pic.twitter.com/LMvKsjb6wX \u2014 LGBT Foundation (@LGBTfdn) October 16, 2019\n\nUsing \"they/them\" pronouns to describe one person can seem like an entirely new idea to some people. Keep persevering. Being recognised as yourself when you're used to being misunderstood is the best feeling in the world. \ud83d\udcab#PronounsDay https://t.co/gcHpnvnrPK \u2014 Gendered Intelligence (@Genderintell) October 16, 2019\n\nHappy #PronounsDay! What are your pronouns? Drop them below. \u2935\ufe0f\ud83d\udc96 \u2014 GLAAD (@glaad) October 16, 2019\n\nSome 2020 Democrats have embraced the move to automatically specify preferred pronouns. During CNN\u2019s Equality Town Hall this month, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) walked onto the stage and announced her preferred pronouns as \u201cshe, her, and hers.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo issued an awkward response, which ultimately triggered backlash.\n\n\u201c\u2018She,\u2019 \u2018her,\u2019 and \u2018hers\u2019? Mine, too,\u201d he said, later apologizing for the remark:\n\nPLEASE READ: When Sen. Harris said her pronouns were she her and her's, I said mine too. I should not have. I apologize. I am an ally of the LGBTQ community, and I am sorry because I am committed to helping us achieve equality. Thank you for watching our townhall. \u2014 Christopher C. Cuomo (@ChrisCuomo) October 11, 2019\n\nLike Harris, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has publicly specified her preferred pronouns, listing \u201cShe/her\u201d on her Twitter bio:\n\n.@ewarren has added her pronouns to her twitter bio. Juli\u00e1n is the only other one I found in a quick canvass of the other candidates. pic.twitter.com/43lqYRuKFt \u2014 Alex Thompson (@AlxThomp) July 18, 2019\n\nPreferred pronouns have become a topic of interest among far-left millennials and social justice warriors, particularly. Those who identify as part of the ultra-progressive group argue that gender is a social construct and should be viewed as a spectrum, hence the varying genders and accompanying pronouns. Preferred pronouns can range from the traditional \u201chis\u201d or \u201chers\u201d to lesser-known terms such as \u201cxem,\u201d \u201chirself,\u201d \u201cxyrs,\u201d or \u201czir.\u201d", "description": "Activists commemorated \"International Pronouns Day\" on Wednesday, urging individuals to \"make it a practice to ask people for their pronouns.\"", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/05/trans-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
