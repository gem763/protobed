He said it was his duty as a doctor to speak up over concerns about patient safety.\n\nA range of health organisations supported him, telling the BBC there needed to be transparency about supplies. Unavailability of certain drugs may affect doctors' decisions about what to prescribe.\n\nHis concerns were later supported by Operation Yellowhammer - the leaked government report describing the possible consequences of leaving without a deal - which said there may be significant disruption to medicines supplies lasting up to six months.\n\nIn response to the row, the Chief Medical Officer for England, Prof Sally Davies, has written to Mr Rees-Mogg to express her \"sincere disappointment in the disrespectful way\" he spoke to and about Dr David Nicholl.\n\nIn the letter, she said that Brexit \"obviously divides opinion\" but that comparing Dr Nicholl to Dr Wakefield is \"going too far and is frankly unacceptable\".\n\nShe thanked Dr Nicholl for his help in planning for no-deal and added that \"there are now full plans in place that we believe, if enacted to plan, should ensure unhindered medical supplies\".\n\nSkip Twitter post by @CMO_England I have written to @Jacob_Rees_Mogg to express my sincere disappointment and show my support for doctors across the country, particularly @djnicholl.\n\n\n\nDoctors are amongst the most trusted people in our country; it is worth listening to what they have to say with respect. pic.twitter.com/WPGLcWIgSz \u2014 Prof Sally Davies (@CMO_England) September 5, 2019 Report\n\nDr Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of the British Medical Association, said Mr Rees-Mogg's \"unwarranted attack\" was \"utterly disgraceful and totally irresponsible\".\n\n\"Highly experienced doctors like David Nicholl who decide to speak out about risks to life and patient care, should be supported and listened to, not attacked and derided by those who hold positions of responsibility.\"\n\nShadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth criticised Mr Rees-Mogg's comments, describing them on Twitter as \"offensive, irresponsible garbage\".\n\nHe added: \"His casual belittling of experienced, medical opinion really is shameful and straight out of the Trump playbook.\"\n\nAlistair Burt, who was one of 21 MPs who lost the Tory whip after they rebelled against the party, said: \"The Brexit obsession is giving rise to sheer irrationality.\"\n\nHe added: \"As a former minister fully aware of the worldwide risks to health security from Wakefield's anti-vax consequences, I am distressed such a comparison could come from a government minister in the UK.\"", "description": "The MP compares a doctor with concerns about medical supplies to a discredited anti-MMR campaigner.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07mk7w5.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
