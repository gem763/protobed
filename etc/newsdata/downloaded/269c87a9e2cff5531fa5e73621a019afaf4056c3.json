The prime minister is also reported to want to scrap \u201clevel playing field\u201d standards that ensure fair competition within the UK.\n\nAcademic think-tank The UK in a Changing Europe found that Mr Johnson\u2019s proposal would see national income per capita drop to 6.4 per cent lower than it would be by staying in the EU \u2013 the equivalent of \u00a32,000 per person in the UK.\n\nIf the UK left the EU on the terms of Ms May\u2019s deal, the effects would less severe, with income per capita 4.9 per cent lower \u2013 or \u00a31,500 per person.\n\nBut Mr Johnson\u2019s plan would be significantly better than a no-deal Brexit. The analysis found that leaving on World Trade Organisation terms would hit income per capita by 8.1 per cent \u2013 \u00a32,500 per person.\n\nThe research concluded that all three Brexit scenarios \u201cwould reduce UK living standards compared to staying in the EU\u201d.\n\nWhile researchers said the exact figures would be influenced by a number of factors, the finding is likely to fuel fears of economic damage to the UK even if it leaves the EU with a deal.\n\nProfessor Anand Menon, director The UK in a Changing Europe, said: \u201cIn all the sound and fury over the politics of Brexit, the economic implications have been somewhat lost from sight.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

However, our estimates provide a clear indication of the broad scale of the impact of Boris Johnson\u2019s proposal, which can be compared to May\u2019s deal, as well as a no deal scenario.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

However, these could in part be mitigated by a more liberal immigration policy.\u201d\n\nThe study found that tighter immigration restrictions after Brexit would damage the UK economy most, with fall of up to 1.8 per cent in GDP to be expected as a result of this policy alone if strict limits are imposed, while a more liberal post-Brexit immigration system would hit GDP by just 0.2 per cent.\n\nThe analysis suggested that Brexit will also harm the EU, with income per capita falling in all of the 27 other EU countries. While the UK would be hit hardest, Ireland would also see a fall of more than 2 per cent, and the Netherlands, Belgium and Hungary would also suffer.\n\nLabour MP Margaret Beckett, a supporter of the campaign for a second referendum, said: \"Until now, most of the media's attention has focused on what Boris Johnson's proposals would mean for Northern Ireland and the destabilistation they would cause to the peace process.\n\n\"But this report shows Boris Johnson is trying to railroad through a Brexit plan that would have a devastating impact on living standards, funding for public services, businesses and jobs or the rest of the United Kingdom too. This report shows income per capita will be \u00a32,000 lower as a result of Boris Johnson's deal. That is \u00a32,000 a year for every man woman and child in the UK, as trade and productivity drops.\"\n\nDowning Street declined to comment.", "description": "Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit plan would leave knock up to \u00a350bn off the economy and leave everyone in the UK \u00a32,000 worse off, new analysis has found.
