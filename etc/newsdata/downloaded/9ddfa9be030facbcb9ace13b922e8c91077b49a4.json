People who opposed or questioned climate science were making the world \u201ca much worse place\u201d, he added, and Google \u201cshould not be aligned with such people\u201d.\n\nBut five years later, Google still funds more than a dozen organisations that deny the climate crisis and oppose political action to try to solve it. Among them is the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), the group that launched the notorious Cooler Heads Coalition two decades ago, a group of conservative and libertarian pressure groups dedicated to dispelling the \u201cmyths\u201d of global heating.\n\nQ&A What is the polluters project? Show Hide The Guardian has collaborated with leading scientists and NGOs to expose, with exclusive data, investigations and analysis, the fossil fuel companies that are perpetuating the climate crisis \u2013 some of which have accelerated their extraction of coal, oil and gas even as the devastating impact on the planet and humanity was becoming clear.\n\nThe investigation has involved more than 20 Guardian journalists working across the world for the past six months. The project focuses on what the companies have extracted from the ground, and the subsequent emissions they are responsible for, since 1965. The analysis, undertaken by Richard Heede at the Climate Accountability Institute, calculates how much carbon is emitted throughout the supply chain, from extraction to use by consumers. Heede said: \"The fact that consumers combust the fuels to carbon dioxide, water, heat and pollutants does not absolve the fossil fuel companies from responsibility for knowingly perpetuating the carbon era and accelerating the climate crisis toward the existential threat it has now become.\" One aim of the project is to move the focus of debate from individual responsibilities to power structures \u2013 so our reporters also examined the financial and lobbying structures that let fossil fuel firms keep growing, and discovered which elected politicians were voting for change. Another aim of the project is to press governments and corporations to close the gap between ambitious long-term promises and lacklustre short-term action. The UN says the coming decade is crucial if the world is to avoid the most catastrophic consequences of global heating. Reining in our dependence on fossil fuels and dramatically accelerating the transition to renewable energy has never been more urgent.\n\nFor Google, providing financial backing to groups such as CEI and the Cato Institute \u2013 staunch free marketeers \u2013 has nothing to do with climate science, and everything to do with its effort to curry favour with conservatives on its most pressing issue in Washington: protecting an obscure section of the US law that is worth billions of dollars to the company.\n\nThe law \u2013 known as section 230 of the Communications Decency Act \u2013 was established in the 1990s, at a time when the internet was in its infancy, and helped to give rise to internet giants, from Google to Facebook, by offering legal immunity to the companies for third party comments, in effect treating them as distributors of content and not publishers.\n\nSection 230, in effect, allowed Google and Facebook to be shielded from the kinds of libel laws that can ensnare other companies, such as newspapers.\n\nThe law has important advocates across the political spectrum, from Democrats who hail it as a triumph of free speech, to Republicans who say it has promoted free enterprise and innovation.\n\nBut now some lawmakers, including Republicans, think it might be time to revise section 230. The senator Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, has said Google\u2019s alleged bias in favour of Democrats means it is not a neutral platform and should not be protected from liability.\n\nGoogle\u2019s decision to give to groups such as CEI reflects an attempt to win friends in Republican and conservative circles, and support those lawmakers on the right who are champions of section 230.\n\n\u201cI think the future of conservatism is up for grabs in the Trump era,\u201d said one person who is familiar with the company\u2019s thinking on political giving. \u201cWe are in a moment where Google has been injected in a lot of culture wars \u2026 and there is a lot of hostility in conservative circles.\u201d\n\nThere is little doubt that Google has a loyal friend in CEI. In a recent letter to members of Congress, CEI and other conservative groups called for the protection of section 230, saying it had created \u201cnew venues for conservative speech\u201d, and that lawmakers who wanted to upend it were \u201cwell-meaning but mistaken\u201d.\n\nCEI has also defended Google in other realms. In a recent op-ed published in the Atlantic, a CEI senior fellow named Mario Loyola argued that the launch of a recent antitrust investigation into Google by 48 state attorneys general, led by the Texas attorney general Ken Paxton \u2013 a strong supporter of Ted Cruz \u2013 would not do anything to help the public.\n\nA CEI spokesperson, who declined to comment on questions about Google, told the Guardian: \u201cCEI is a nonprofit organisation that advocates free-market solutions to public policy issues. CEI\u2019s research programmes and positions are developed independently by policy experts and reflect a longstanding, steadfast dedication to principles of economic liberty and limited government.\u201d\n\nWhen Google was asked about its support for CEI and groups like it, a company spokesperson said: \u201cWe sponsor organisations from across the political spectrum that advocate for strong technology policies. We\u2019ve been extremely clear that Google\u2019s sponsorship doesn\u2019t mean that we endorse that organisation\u2019s entire agenda \u2013 we may disagree strongly on some issues.\u201d\n\nGoogle employees have privately spoken out about the company\u2019s support for some conservative groups. In a discussion with employees in March 2018 \u2013 a recording of which was heard by the Guardian \u2013 Adam Kovacevich, who at the time served as head of public policy at Google (he has since left the company), defended the company\u2019s alignment with some conservatives.\n\nHe said he had been directed to forge the relationships after the 2016 election of Donald Trump. It reflected a view that the company was seen as too close to Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign and other Democrats.\n\nThe discussion took place after a controversy over Google\u2019s sponsorship of the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), the annual meeting of conservatives, where Google hosted a party.\n\nTo the consternation of many employees, its logo appeared on banners next to the NRA\u2019s. In his opening remarks on the call, Kovacevich said it was important to build relationships not only with people in power \u201cbut also the people who influence them\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt can be hard sometimes to reconcile our business interests with our stated values, and finding that balance is something our team has to navigate really on a daily basis, and it has gotten more and more complicated,\u201d Kovacevich can be heard saying in the recording.\n\nWhile Google staff seemed to accept Google needed to forge ties across the political spectrum, the majority of the employees on the call expressed concern that the company was too far out of step with its values. The Wall Street Journal and Wired have previously reported on the meeting.\n\nThis year, Google did not sponsor CPAC. But big technology companies were frequently named \u2013 and lambasted \u2013 by conservative participants in their speeches. In one case, the rightwing provocateur James O\u2019Keefe encouraged tech employees to secretly record colleagues in their offices in order to expose their alleged biases.\n\n\u201cWe will equip you with a camera,\u201d O\u2019Keefe said. \u201cIf they\u2019re lying, cheating, scamming, we\u2019re going to find them, make them famous internet celebrities, expose them for all the world to see.\u201d", "description": "Company wants to curry favour with conservatives to protect its \u2018section 230\u2019 legal immunity", "authors": ["Stephanie Kirchgaessner"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e7d491e90d51e0cb863c630eb08613d5e595709/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7ae4bcb646e2c6786743754e4c024e93", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
