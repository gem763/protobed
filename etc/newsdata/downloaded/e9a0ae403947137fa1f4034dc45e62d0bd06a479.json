Elizabeth Day put his magnetic forces to the test\u2026 and it\u2019s weirder than you could ever have imagined\n\nWhen you go to a sixth-generation shaman for a healing session, you have certain expectations. I imagined a forest clearing, surrounded by sacred stones and maybe a few wind chimes hanging from the trees. I assumed the shaman himself would be a man wearing long white robes and a beatific expression. Possibly even a beard.\n\nBut when I arrive for my appointed hour with Shaman Durek, the Los Angeles-based spiritual guide who counts Gwyneth Paltrow among his clients and whose girlfriend is a real-life Norwegian princess, it is at a distinctly un-mystical yoga studio in London\u2019s South Kensington. The reception area is littered with other people\u2019s shoes and a couple of women chatting about the school run. I am led down a corridor to a room with a grey carpet and polystyrene ceiling tiles.\n\nElizabeth Day writes: 'When you go to a sixth-generation shaman for a healing session, you have certain expectations...' Elizabeth wears dress, Anna Mason; boots, Aldo; earrings, Alighieri. Durek wears necklace, Pebble London.\n\nInstead of flowing white robes, Shaman Durek is wearing a perfectly serviceable beige T-shirt and trousers. At least I think he is, because I am so mesmerised by his skin that it\u2019s almost impossible to focus on anything else. It is the most perfect skin I have ever seen: smooth, glowy, youthful and entirely blemish-free. He is 44 but looks like he has just been unwrapped.\n\nHe first discovered his shamanic powers at the age of six, he tells me, and he doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s aged much since then.\n\n\u2018My mother took me to the dentist, and she turned round and couldn\u2019t find me,\u2019 he says. \u2018I\u2019d run out into the street and was hugging an elderly woman on a bench, feeling all of her pain and sadness.\u2019\n\nLuckily, the elderly woman in question didn\u2019t press charges, and Durek began shamanic \u2018training\u2019 at the age of 11. He was born Derek Verrett in Sacramento, California, to a well-off family. His father, David, was an engineer of African-Haitian descent; his mother, Veruschka, Indian-Norwegian. His aunt Shirley was a noted opera singer, an African-American mezzo-soprano. He calls on members of his family who have died \u2013 his father, his aunt and his grandmother \u2013 to help him during healing sessions. (This is not the last you will hear of Aunt Shirley.)\n\nThese days, he describes himself as \u2018a bridge between the spiritual and physical plane\u2019 and is endorsed by Goop, Paltrow\u2019s multimillion-dollar wellness empire. Paltrow \u2013 a frequent presence on his Instagram page \u2013 describes him as her \u2018soul brother\u2019 and his other clients include actresses Rosario Dawson and Nina Dobrev. A one-to-one session with Durek costs anywhere between \u00a3320 and \u00a3800.\n\nHe is a very modern Shaman: handsome, bisexual and with a penchant for statement necklaces. He talks about things being \u2018lit\u2019 and energetic systems that need \u2018rebooting\u2019. His forthcoming book, Spirit Hacking, has sections with titles such as Be Your Own Damn Guru. He travels with an entourage, including his niece who looks like a model and is charged with uploading Instagram stories when required. He is an intriguing mix of ancient and modern: half-shaman, half hip-hop star.\n\nDurek is a very modern Shaman: handsome, bisexual and with a penchant for statement necklaces. He talks about things being \u2018lit\u2019 and energetic systems that need \u2018rebooting\u2019 Elizabeth wears blouse, Lisou; trousers, Roland Mouret; Durek wears necklace, Pebble London\n\nHe even has a celebrity girlfriend. In May, Princess M\u00e4rtha Louise of Norway, the 48-year-old daughter of King Harald V and Queen Sonja (and third cousin to our own Queen), announced on social media that they had begun a relationship. The couple met through a mutual friend and Durek ordered in macrobiotic vegan food from a caf\u00e9 in LA for their first date. I say first date, although he tells me they\u2019ve actually met several times in past lives, including ancient Egypt where he was a pharaoh and she was his queen.\n\nBack in South Kensington, I stand in front of Durek and he begins talking to me rapidly in an accent best described as Los Angeles via mittel-Europe. It is, like his age, unplaceable. \u2018You are not getting enough sleep,\u2019 he says. \u2018You\u2019re operating at a two when you should be at least a seven. It\u2019s because your intelligence is such that you hear not only what is being said, but you understand the feeling behind it, and by the end of the week, if you don\u2019t get enough sleep, you\u2019re emotionally depleted.\u2019\n\nSo far, this is pretty accurate. Although I suspect you could tell almost any 40-year-old woman that they\u2019re not getting enough sleep and will feel drained by the end of the week and every single one of us would nod in recognition.\n\n\u2018We need to work on your core,\u2019 he says, fixing his gaze on mine. \u2018Your internal boundaries, because you try to put up external boundaries but people ignore them.\u2019\n\nThis is accurate. In fact, I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about boundaries lately. This past year has been, for me, one of intense transition. It has involved turning 40, getting a job as a columnist for this magazine, launching a podcast, publishing a book, going on a speaking tour and moving house. The transitions have all been for happy reasons, but it\u2019s been exhausting nonetheless. The demands on my time have, on occasion, felt overwhelming, and I have worried that saying no to things makes me appear self-involved or ungrateful.\n\n\u2018We need to work on getting rid of the guilt and sadness you carry,\u2019 Durek says.\n\nShe \u2018grooms me to be a better man\u2019, says Durek of his \u2018soul sis\u2019 Gwyneth Paltrow; And, right, with girlfriend Princess Martha-Louise. He\u2019s my \u2018twin flame,\u2019 she says\n\nAgain, I think, this could be said of a lot of people, but certainly I can relate to it.\n\n\u2018You\u2019re a little bloated.\u2019\n\nOh. Bet he doesn\u2019t say that to Gwyneth.\n\n\u2018But it\u2019s because of all that toxicity you\u2019re carrying down there. We\u2019ll get rid of that for you. You have some issues around your left hip.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s true: I do have issues with my left hip, but no one really knows that other than my chiropractor.\n\nHe starts calling on magnetic forces to \u2018bring me forward.\u2019 I stand there, feet planted solidly on the grey institutional carpet, and without meaning to, I lean forwards. He does the same thing but somehow pushes me back against the wall behind me. He calls on spirits to bring me ice, and I feel a calm, cool prickle all the way down my back. He asks the spirits to help me release toxicity \u2018in whatever way she can\u2019.\n\nI\u2019d read beforehand that, frequently in shamanic healing sessions, clients will burp, cough or even throw up. I\u2019m feeling jittery. I sort of want to burp, just to see what it will be like, but no burp is forthcoming. It\u2019s at that point that I start to yawn. I yawn like I\u2019ve never yawned before. I yawn with relentless exhaustion. I double over with my yawning. I yawn to the point of gagging.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s good, my love,\u2019 the shaman is saying. \u2018I can see it all coming out.\u2019\n\nAt some point, he leads me to a massage table in the middle of the room and asks me to lie down on my back. Which is where it gets really weird.\n\n\u2018Increase her power by 10,000,\u2019 Shaman Durek says. \u2018Increase her power by 20,000.\u2019\n\n'Admittedly, I am not what you\u2019d call a sceptic. I\u2019ve always been interested in the idea of some spiritual human connection that transcends rational science,' writes Elizabeth Day\n\nHe talks as though I am a malfunctioning spaceship in Star Trek and he is issuing commands to intergalactic computer systems. Part of me is mildly embarrassed. This is all so ludicrous, so over-the-top, so unnecessary\u2026isn\u2019t it? And yet, without intending to, I start crying. I can\u2019t remember the last time I cried like this: heaving sobs and raggedy breath. It takes me back to childhood, to the sensation of crying when no one understands why you are so upset.\n\n\u2018Aunt Shirley, release her vocal cords and let her sing.\u2019\n\n\u2018I am not going to sing,\u2019 I think. \u2018No way. I will never knowingly sing in public if I can help it, that\u2019s absolutely not going to\u2026\u2019\n\nA sound comes from my throat. It\u2019s a moan. I\u2019m moaning. Not singing but moaning loudly in front of a man I\u2019ve only just met. In any normal context, I\u2019d be mortified. But this is not normal, I\u2019m beginning to realise. It is not normal at all.\n\nThen, Shaman Durek starts talking to me in what sounds like an ancient tribal language I don\u2019t recognise. It\u2019s a bit like a slowed-down version of the All Blacks haka, which is to say it sounds Maori. Although I can\u2019t understand the words, I know that Durek is asking me questions. This is the bit that I wasn\u2019t sure how to write about because what happens next is beyond my comprehension. What happens next is that I start to answer him. In the same language.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t have thought I could speak an ancient language. Yet here I am, gabbling away\n\nAdmittedly, I am not what you\u2019d call a sceptic. I\u2019ve always been interested in the idea of some spiritual human connection that transcends rational science. My thinking is two-fold. Firstly, when a person dies, they become part of the earth again \u2013 their molecules blend with other molecules \u2013 and so it makes sense to me that, at some level, you might be able to feel their energy still. Secondly, I think it would be highly arrogant to believe that we imperfect humans are sophisticated enough to have developed a science that understands everything.\n\nWe haven\u2019t. We can\u2019t. The whole concept of linear time is an invention that helps us deal with the enormity of the universe. Therefore it stands to reason that there are things \u2013 ideas, concepts, connections \u2013 that lie beyond the limits of our rational knowledge. That lie beyond the limits of what we think of as time.\n\nThis liminal space between understanding and being is labelled by different people in different ways. Some people call it God. Some call it spirituality. Others call it bulls\u2022\u2022\u2022, and that\u2019s OK. But I choose to believe there is something greater than us that does not end with death.\n\nIn my 20s, a beloved ex-boyfriend of mine was killed in Iraq where he had gone as a freelance journalist to cover the aftermath of the war. He was 24. That was the first time I remember going to see a psychic. She was called Anna and worked from rooms below a hairdresser (also, strangely, in South Kensington). Anna didn\u2019t have any messages for me from the other side, but she did tell my male friend that he was going to be married within the year to a woman with an interest in scuba-diving. It never happened. Anna was not a very good psychic.\n\nIn my mid-30s, I went through a divorce. I tried and failed to have the children I\u2019d always imagined for myself. In late 2015, I found myself in LA, and because I was there, in the home of alternative therapies, I decided to go to another psychic. She was called Megan Le Fey (no, really) and I found her in a decidedly un-psychic way: I logged on to Yelp and booked the highest-rated psychic in my area.\n\nMegan was in her late 20s, perky in manner and immediately warm. She was also extremely good at her job. But I would not fully understand how good until last year, when it seemed as though all of her predictions were coming true. She said a number of very specific things about my professional life \u2013 including the plot of a novel I was then writing that only my agent and editor knew about.\n\n\u2018We got intimate, deep and real!\u2019 says Durek of meeting actress Patsy Palmer; Durek and Martha-Louise with Antonio Banderas in August\n\nAt this time, I was unsure whether I had done the right thing in leaving my marriage. I was anxious about an uncertain, lonely future. Megan told me I would not go back to my ex-husband but would meet someone else.\n\n\u2018You think you\u2019ve been with alpha males up until now, but you haven\u2019t,\u2019 Megan said, before going on to outline all the characteristics of this man I would meet, including the fact that he would have been married before \u2018but he\u2019s not jaded by it. He\u2019s a real sweetie.\u2019 I asked her when I would meet him.\n\n\u2018In around two years.\u2019\n\nI was 36 at the time. \u2018Two years?\u2019 I shrieked. \u2018That\u2019s way too long.\u2019\n\nShe smiled. \u2018And you\u2019ll meet him online. You\u2019ll have been dating for a while and you won\u2019t think anything of it, but he\u2019ll know straight away that he wants to be with you.\u2019\n\n\u2018Yeah, right,\u2019 I thought.\n\nI got back to London, and within two weeks had met a man who didn\u2019t fit her description at all, but who I then had a long-term relationship with. Well, I told myself, Megan Le Fey couldn\u2019t be right about everything.\n\nBut 18 months later, the man broke up with me, out of the blue, and I was so heartbroken I did what I never thought I would: I started online dating. Six months after that, I met a man through a dating app who ticked all of Megan\u2019s boxes. We\u2019ve just bought a house together. She was right: he is a real sweetie.\n\nSo I\u2019m aware that I am credulous. I am willing to believe in powers higher than us. Shaman Durek didn\u2019t have to win me over from a position of ingrained cynicism. But at the same time I am not a total imbecile. I\u2019ve also been to bad psychics and healers whose fraudulence I can spot precisely because I have the comparison of good ones. As a journalist, I have been trained to ask questions of everything. Plus, I have a terribly British sensibility when it comes to embarrassing myself in front of strangers. The idea that I would suddenly start moaning and speaking an ancient tribal language I didn\u2019t understand in front of a man I\u2019d only just met\u2026well, I would never have thought myself capable of it.\n\nAnd yet here I am, gabbling away in a foreign tongue. The shaman and I converse a bit, and he tells me I must let go of my desire to save people who need to save themselves, then I come round (this is what it feels like: as if I\u2019ve been in a trance). An hour has passed, even though I could swear it\u2019s only been five minutes.\n\n\u2018Hello again,\u2019 he says, smiling.\n\nI feel charged, as though my battery power has been ramped up. When I leave the studio, I phone a friend.\n\n\u2018You sound so\u2026light,\u2019 she tells me.\n\nBy the evening, I am exhausted. For the next two days, I feel bone-tired and my stomach is unsettled. Durek assures me this is entirely normal: \u2018Your system is rebooting itself. Your body needs to unlearn everything it\u2019s been told.\u2019 By day three, the sluggishness lifts.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the thing: I\u2019m sleeping better than I have done in years. Long, solid sleeps which leave me refreshed. I notice that in work meetings, I\u2019m less wary of speaking up. I suddenly just know what I think and I say it. People respond positively, which is the biggest surprise of all.\n\nI don\u2019t know if this feeling is going to last and I don\u2019t know, either, if it\u2019s all related to my healing session. But, if nothing else, it was a truly memorable experience.\n\nOr rather, as Shaman Durek would say: it was lit.\n\n- Spirit Hacking: Shamanic Keys to Reclaim Your Personal Power, Transform Yourself and Light Up the World by Shaman Durek is published by Yellow Kite, price \u00a314.99.
