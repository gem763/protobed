That announcement came less than a week after Pelosi and other top Democrats unveiled a proposal that would allow the government to negotiate with drugmakers on the prices of at least 25 of the most expensive drugs in Medicare and the private market in an attempt to lower prescription-drug prices.\n\nSee also: Why Trump impeachment threat is rattling stock-market investors\n\nWith an impeachment moving through the House, you can either kiss any and all legislation and cooperation goodbye, or Speaker Pelosi will try to move something through \u201cto inoculate vulnerable House Democrats from the \u2018Do Nothing\u2019 talking-point,\u201d Cowen analyst Chris Kruger wrote in a note Tuesday.\n\nTwo prime examples could be the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement for North American trade or a drug pricing bill that could get presidential support. Either of those options, however, do not seem very likely with an impeachment moving forward.\n\n\u201cWhen an administration and a chamber of Congress are at war; rarely does anything other than what is absolutely required get done,\u201d Raymond James health care policy analyst Chris Meekins wrote in a Monday morning note that predicted that the whistleblower news would lead to a battle between Trump and congressional Democrats. \u201cThat means anything that is not on a firm deadline (like government funding), is unlikely to get done (think drug pricing).\u201d\n\nHealth care stocks have been living under a looming cloud since the election, given Trump\u2019s stated desire to lower drug prices in the U.S. For the year to date, health care has been the worst-performing sector on the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.84%, with both the sector and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF XLV, -0.92% rising only 4.9%, compared with the S&P 500\u2019s 18.3% gain.\n\nOnly four of the 63 components of the Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF gained in Tuesday trading, as stocks were hit with concerns about an impeachment investigation. Only two, Intuitive Surgical Inc. ISRG, +2.56% and Dentsply Sirona Inc. XRAY, +1.45% , increased more than 0.1% in the session.", "description": "As the move to impeach President Donald Trump moves forward, one analyst contends that the proceedings could essentially bring Congress to even more of a...", "authors": ["Wallace Witkowski"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GM538_drug_p_ZG_20180716082228.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
