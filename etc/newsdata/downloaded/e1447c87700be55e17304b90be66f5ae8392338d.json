I just did it. I just kept thinking \u2018please don\u2019t call the police\u2019.\"\n\nThe woman from London was one of a string of anonymous benefit claimants whose journey into \u201csurvival sex\u201d is exposed in a harrowing report by MPs.\n\nThe Work and Pensions Committee said the five-week wait for people's first payment is often why people say they are forced to exchange sex to meet their needs.\n\nHas Universal Credit forced you into difficult circumstances?

What could I do? It was that or have the police called. I just did it. I just kept thinking 'please don't call the police'.\n\n\"Anyway, he said afterwards that if I did the same next week he'd let me have forty quid's worth of stock. It seemed like a fortune. [...] In the end, I held out for two weeks.\n\n\"I got my [UC] money, and again it was short, and again it was gone on bills before I'd even thought of food. So, I left the baby with next door and went down to the shop [...] It's been like that for months now.\"\n\nClaimants can obtain advances to bridge the five-week gap for first payment - but they have to be paid back out of future benefits.\n\nThe MPs were sent testimony of another woman, SM from Stockton-on-Tees, who started \u201csex working every few days\u201d to pay rent.\n\nA third, Jackie, began drinking and taking amphetamines and \u201creturned to selling sex on the streets after nearly 30 years\u201d.\n\nA fourth woman in Bristol began seeing a \u201csugar daddy who she was not seeing before\u201d, the MPs heard.\n\nThe MPs also heard testimony in person from four women which was so powerful, it prompted ministers to U-turn on their insistence UC did not cause \"survival sex\".\n\nMinisters previously said there was no \"causative link\" between the six-in-one benefit and survival sex.\n\nBut they then said they would look into any possible links after minister Will Quince attended the private hearing with four women in Parliament.\n\nOne of the four women, a 21-year-old carer, told MPs how she turned to sex work to cope when the benefit left her \u00a352 to live on.\n\nThe woman said her lack of cash left her sofa-surfing and scrabbling together cash for tampons or a Pot Noodle.\n\nAnother of the four women told the inquiry that she was about to be moved on to Universal Credit and would lose around \u00a3200 a month.\n\n\"The thought of going into debt and having no money is really frightening. I have children. I can't do that. I will sell my body,\" she said.\n\nChairman Frank Field hailed ministers for U-turning after initially issuing \u201cdefensive and trite\u201d response.\n\nBut he said: \u201cWelcome though that was, that cannot be the end of it.\n\n\"The DWP, having belatedly acknowledged that there is a problem, must take the steps to resolve it.\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nA DWP spokesman said: \u201cWe take all evidence presented to the Committee very seriously and are determined to ensure that no one finds themselves in this position.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to providing a safety net for the most vulnerable in society and have made improvements to Universal Credit such as extending advances, removing waiting days, and introducing housing benefit run on.\"", "description": "The woman was left destitute under Universal Credit said an exploitative shop manager offered her \u00a340 of stock in exchange for oral sex", "authors": ["Dan Bloom", "Image", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20717653.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Vintage-filtered-on-silhouette-of-depressed-girl-sitting-on-the-window.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
