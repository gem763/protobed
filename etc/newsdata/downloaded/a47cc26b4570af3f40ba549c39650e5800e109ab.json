The concept is simple. You give money to a government or corporate entity who turns around and pays you interest for lending that money to compensate for risk and time.\n\nBut this simple concept has been flipped on its head recently. Specifically, the \u201cinterest\u201d part of the above fixed-income equation has gone out the window. Consider the following:\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield is flirting with all-time lows around 1.8%.\n\nThe 30-year Treasury yield has plunged to all-time lows around 2.2%.\n\nAbout one-third of tradeable bonds around the world now have negative yields, amounting to $17 trillion in negative-yielding debt.\n\nThe yield curves are entirely negative in countries like Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands.\n\nIn other words, across the world, the income part of the fixed-income equation is rapidly disappearing. Weird, right?\n\nDespite this, U.S. equities are still giving investors income. That is, the S&P 500\u2018s dividend yield presently hovers around 2% \u2014 significantly above all-time low levels (roughly 1% in 2000) and also on the upper end of where the S&P 500 dividend yield has hovered over the past 20 years.\n\nBig picture, then, while the fixed income market is suffering from disappearing income, stocks are still paying good income.\n\nThe implication? Buy stable dividend stocks which pay more than any other relatively risk-free bond in the world will. As investors grow tired of not even beating inflation by buying a 10-year Treasury note, they will inevitably pile into stocks which: 1) have much higher yields, and 2) have a history of steady and consistent dividend hikes.\n\nWithout further ado, let\u2019s take a look at five dividend stocks that fit this description.\n\n\n\n\n\nDividend Stocks to Buy: AT&T (T)\n\nThere's No Way AT&T Stock Is the Best Streaming Bet More\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nDividend Yield: 5.3%\n\nDividend History: The dividend has consistently increased over the past 34 years.\n\nAt the top of this list, we have a stock which many consider the blue-chip dividend king: telecom giant AT&T (NYSE:T).\n\nAT&T has everything investors are looking for in a stable, income-paying stock. Big yield? Check. The stock yields 5.3%. History of dividend hikes? Check. AT&T has consistently hiked its dividend over the past three decades.\n\nStable operations? Check. AT&T provides telecom services which U.S. consumers have become exceptionally dependent on \u2014 indeed, the internet and wireless services which AT&T provides may be the most important utilities outside of water, food and electricity. Healthy catalysts on the horizon? Also, check. Next year, AT&T: 1) is launching new streaming services which should help offset cord-cutting weakness, and 2) will benefit from the mainstream and widespread deployment of 5G infrastructure and devices.\n\nAT&T stock is the quintessential stable dividend stock to buy at the current moment.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerican Electric Power (AEP)\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nDividend Yield: 2.9%\n\nDividend History: The dividend has consistently increased over the past six years.\n\nNext up, we have a utility giant that is best known for its stability and resiliency: electricity services provider American Electric Power (NYSE:AEP).\n\nRelative to other \u201cbig dividend stocks,\u201d AEP\u2019s yield isn\u2019t that big. It sits at just 2.9%. But, there are three things to note here. First, that 2.9% yield still smashes the 1.8% 10-year Treasury yield. Two, American Electric Power has a long track record of consistent dividend hikes that dates back at least six years, a stretch during which the dividend increased 100%. Three, American Electric Power has an equally long track record of consistent and stable revenue and profit growth, which has powered consistent gains in AEP stock over the past decade.", "description": "Income in the bond market is rapidly disappearing, and that's a weird concept to try and wrap your head around.For decades -- centuries, even -- investors around the world have bought fixed-income instruments for relatively risk-free income.
