Acerbic, clever, distorting and subtly demeaning its intended victims \u2013 typical Cummings.\n\nNo matter that the mandate of 2016 cannot be necessarily interpreted as one for a no-deal Brexit, or any other type of Brexit for that matter. Nor does Cummings mind that MPs, the common name for elected politicians, have a job to do as our representatives and we do not rule by plebiscite or orders-in-council promulgated by the Queen on the advice of her prime minister (not yet anyway).\n\nIf you like, put it like this: We do not want haughty, arrogant unelected officials in Brussels simply replaced by unelected officials in Downing Street, unaccountable even to the PM, and already in contempt of parliament.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe Cummings coup is not complete. But this is where we are, the supposed democratic imperative of the 2016 referendum constantly used as a trump card in any debate, when it is nothing of the sort. Any dissent is dismissed as mere elitist snobbery, and the uncertain verdict of 2016, still not challenged head-on anywhere nearly often enough.\n\nNow, however, it is time for Cummings and those he controls \u2013 notably the prime minister \u2013 to be told that that politicians also don\u2019t get to choose which laws to obey.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Getty\n\nIf the will of parliament is that Brexit should be delayed and no-deal Brexit avoided, and that is enacted in legislation, then ministers do not have a right to ignore or delay it unduly or to thwart it.\n\nVery shortly, the House of Commons will speak its manifest will through legislation \u2013 a wish to delay Brexit and prevent the dreaded no deal. This cuts across the negotiating strategy of the government, and, in effect, deprives the Johnson administration of its raison d\u2019etre.\n\nThe whole \u00a3100m \u201cGet Ready\u201d propaganda campaign will be rendered redundant. The attempt at yet another renegotiation with the EU would be cut off at the knee. There will be no no-deal Brexit, nor the threat of a no-deal Brexit, negotiating ploy or not. There will be nothing left of Boris Johnson\u2019s government than a mop of blond hair atop a smouldering political car crash.\n\nSo what? That\u2019s politics in a minority administration and hung parliament.\n\nThe stakes for Johnson could not be higher, and that is why his ministers are gaming the constitution for all it is worth. They are delving into every nook and cranny of the machinery, including the harmless ceremonial bits, for ways to thwart the will of parliament. They are weaponising flummery. Hence the absurd abuse of the power to prorogue, or suspend, parliament.\n\nNow it is suggested that the new No No-Deal Brexit Act, or whatever it will be called, will be delayed unavoidably before it can reach the Palace and the Queen can graciously grant it her assent \u2013 La Reyne le veult, to give it its quaint Norman French expression. But the Queen can only will it if her ministers deign to send it to her. They should not plead that it got lost in the post, left on the Brexit bus, or they\u2019re still thinking about things, or maybe that the dog ate it (probably the first task to be assigned to the Jack Russell pup joining Dominic Cummings in the Downing Street attack dog kennels).\n\nThis then, is what we have come to. Ministers such as Michael Gove are asked if they will obey a law, and the reply is that they don\u2019t want to \u201cbuy a pig in a poke\u201d and will have to take a look at this legal thingy before they decide, maybe, to do as it says. And to think the Conservative Party used to be big on \u201claw and order\u201d.\n\nImagine if some hoodlum decided he\u2019d have to have a bit of think about obeying the laws on knife crime, or if some banker decided that the laws on fraud didn\u2019t suit his present negotiating stance, and just let them slide. Or if, heaven forbid, some referendum campaign officials decided that the laws on election funding and the like were simply just so much red tape.\n\nSo obviously central is the no-deal Brexit scenario to the gangsters in Downing Street that they will do anything to get their way. Soon we will have, in effect, a giveaway budget from a patsy of a chancellor \u2013 huge spending boosts for all the best causes and tax cuts too, all to be paid for after the election \u2013 the traditional pre-election gambit, buying the voters with their own money.\n\nAnd we have had the twisting and politicisation of the previously \"dignified\u201d bits of the constitution, those routine bits of administration carried out by men in tailcoats and tights. They are pushing the Queen and the institution of the monarchy onto places she really ought not to be pushed. And all in the name of a \u201cdeal\u201d that the EU cannot in any case ever agree to, because of their desire to protect the single market and Good Friday Agreement. And also because it is simply illogical to be inside and outside a customs union at the same time.\n\nWhat, then, do we expect people to do when they feel that their representative institutions \u2013 parliament \u2013 are being undermined and demeaned? When their voice cannot be heard because their MPs have been sent away on holiday? When MPs pass laws the government ignores? When Scotland and Northern Ireland and London are dismissed?\n\nIt seems obvious that the impulse towards mass direct action, as peaceful as it can be, will grow, and things could turn nasty. As Extinction Rebellion shows, this can be extremely effective and unpredictable with it. British history is full of such examples.
