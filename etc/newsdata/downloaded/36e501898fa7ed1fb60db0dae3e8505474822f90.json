California has long had the authority to set its own rules on limiting air pollutants from cars, but the Trump administration believes such requirements should be set by the federal government, not a state.\n\nThe move to rescind the waiver is still under review and could be delayed, according to one administration official.\n\nAndrew Wheeler, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, told a car dealer trade group Tuesday that the administration would be taking action imminently but he didn\u2019t offer specific timing.\n\n\u201cIn the very near future, the Trump administration will begin taking the steps necessary to establish one set of national fuel-economy standards,\u201d Mr. Wheeler said.\n\nRescinding the waiver would fulfill a longstanding goal of the administration to curb California\u2019s influence over the car industry with its ability to set more stringent emissions rules than federal mandates. In July, four car companies\u2014 Ford Motor Co. , Honda Motor Co. , Volkswagen AG and BMW AG \u2014signed an agreement with California to meet tougher emission requirements than those proposed by the Trump administration.\n\nIn response, the White House directed regulators to accelerate efforts to remove California\u2019s waiver, according to people familiar with the plan, and make that plan separate from their broader efforts to rollback fuel-economy rules.\n\nThe development is the latest in the fierce fight between the administration and California, the nation\u2019s most populous state, which has said it would defend its waiver in court. The clash is expected to result in a protracted legal battle that the car industry had been hoping to avoid.\n\nAuto makers had for years lobbied the White House to relax the existing fuel economy rules, which require them to steadily increase gas mileage and reduce greenhouse-gas emissions on their car fleets. The companies argued that surging consumer demand for larger trucks and SUVs has made the efficiency targets harder to achieve.\n\nBut when the administration proposed last summer to freeze the rules at the current levels and revoke California\u2019s waiver, car companies worried that the resulting legal challenges would create more uncertainty.\n\nCalifornia has already taken legal action to block the White House\u2019s efforts and threatened more lawsuits.\n\n\u201cWe will fight this latest attempt and defend our clean car standards,\u201d said Gov. Gavin Newsom in a statement Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThe administration has been taking pains to ensure its rule-making process would survive a legal challenge that could go before the U.S. Supreme Court, a White House official said.\n\nCalifornia will likely ask a judge for a stay to keep the current rules in place, a move that could force auto makers to comply with those regulations, while waiting to see which standards ultimately prevail, say legal experts.\n\n\u2014Andrew Restuccia and Alex Leary contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Ben Foldy at Ben.Foldy@wsj.com", "description": "The move would prevent the state from setting its own auto-pollutant standards.", "authors": ["Ben Foldy", "Ben.Foldy Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-108085/social", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
