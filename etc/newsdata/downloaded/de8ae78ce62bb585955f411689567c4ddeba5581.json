Cummings halt a White House subpoena seeking materials related to the Ukraine matter.\n\n\u201cYour memorandum cherry-picks and misstates information to propagate a misleading narrative about the President\u2019s actions,\u201d the committee\u2019s GOP members wrote in a letter to Mr. Cummings. \u201cWe strongly object to the issuance of this subpoena and your stated reason for issuing it.\u201d\n\nMr. Cummings, Maryland Democrat, on Wednesday, gave the White House notice of the subpoena, issued in conjunction with the House Foreign Affairs and Intelligence committees.\n\nThe subpoena went into effect on Friday, but House Oversight Republicans charge the move violated a bipartisan agreement to vote on its language.\n\n\u201cBy proposing to issue his subpoena unilaterally without a business meeting, the chairman is denying transparency and accountability about the committee\u2019s work,\u201d wrote the Republicans, led by ranking member Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio.\n\nThe Democratic committee chairs have taken their fight to the White House as they fight for more documents related to President Trump\u2019s July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nThe chairmen say they have asked the White House to voluntarily turn over the documents, but the White House has \u201crefused to engage with \u2014 or even respond to \u2014 the committees.\u201d\n\nBut Republicans say that simply isn\u2019t true. They claim Democrats expanded the scope of document categories from six to 40, failing to give the White House time to comply.\n\n\u201cThis expansion is particularly troubling because your justification for unilaterally issuing the subpoena is that you claim that the White House has failed to voluntarily comply with your demands,\u201d the Republicans wrote. \u201cThe White House, however, cannot voluntarily comply with a request you have not previously made.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
