Secondhand? She\u2019s not enamoured with the term. There are connotations. So, though it is not, strictly speaking, official Depop brand language, she has landed on a different phrase. \u201cWe say pre-loved!\u201d\n\nDepop is an entire platform for the pre-loved. More than 140,000 secondhand items are listed on the app daily. There are old Nike jumpers and old Off-White hoodies and vintage blue jeans and astonishing amounts of 90s dead stock. There are bras and satchels, chokers and bomber ja ckets \u2013 hot commodities on the resale market. There are items that are not clothing, but users predominantly trade in fashion and accessories. In functionality, the app is a practical marriage between eBay (used stuff for sale) and Instagram (curated lives). Items appear in scrollable grids. Buyers follow their favourite sellers, who market their products with age-appropriate copy. In a recent post, a user from south London tagged a neon green T-shirt (\u00a329.99) with the terms \u201cGothic\u201d, \u201ceboy\u201d, \u201ctechwear\u201d, \u201cegirl\u201d, \u201cheel\u201d, \u201cfuture\u201d, \u201ccyberdog\u201d, \u201cy2k\u201d and \u201cfire\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fashion marketplace for the next generation,\u201d Raga says and then, to clarify, \u201cGeneration Z!\u201d She is sitting straight-backed in a conference room at Depop HQ \u2013 a converted industrial space in east London \u2013 wearing a white blouse handed down by her mother and a pair of floral silk trousers pre-loved by the pop star Lily Allen. Allen is big on Depop. She has 50,000 followers (a fraction of her Instagram count, but every little helps) and an inventory of upmarket cast-offs that includes a pair of Iceberg jogging bottoms (\u00a3120), a Phillip Lim vest top (\u00a375) and a bright yellow jumper with bell sleeves (\u00a370). But she is not big big, because she is not in ownership of the app\u2019s cardinal user attribute, which is being tremendously young.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018It\u2019s a fashion marketplace for the next generation, for Generation Z\u2019: Maria Raja outside her NY office. Photograph: Daniel Dorsa/The Observer\n\nExactly why a successful singer-songwriter sells her unwanted clothing on a mobile app is anyone\u2019s guess, though a cynic might suggest it\u2019s a savvy way to reach teenage fans. Depop has more than 15m registered users, Raga says, of whom \u201c90% are 26 or under\u201d. A Depop user as old as Allen, who is 34, is rare. In a recent New York magazine article, the writer Matthew Schneier described Depop as \u201ca siren pitched at a frequency easiest for teens and the recently teenage to hear\u201d. It has been manufactured that way. \u201cThe mission,\u201d Raga says, earnestly, \u201cis to power young, entrepreneurial, creative people\u2026 because we think they\u2019re the ones that will change the world.\u201d Of the app\u2019s users, she explains: \u201cThey are in that period of their lives where they are figuring out for themselves what they want to do in the future and we want to give them an opportunity. To support them in their journey.\u201d\n\nThe journey usually begins in a user\u2019s bedroom. \u201cWhat happens is they start selling clothes from their wardrobes,\u201d Raga says. \u201cThey\u2019re pretty much mobile natives, so they know how to get the ball rolling.\u201d For casual users, that is enough. Depop pays out pocket money. It is the new paper round. But others seem born to the process, understand the power and value in sharing their particular tastes with the world, and the journey continues. They pillage charity shops. They create inventory. Slowly, they generate a following. And then they begin to sell so many items that, in a few cases at least, the gig becomes full-time. Earlier this year, it was reported that one of the app\u2019s top sellers, Bella McFadden, or @internetgirl, used the app to haul a six-figure income. She is 23. She is not the only Depop mogul.\n\n\u201cWe make it super easy for people to start a business,\u201d Raga says. In this way she believes the app provides a great social service. \u201cWe\u2019re teaching. We\u2019re helping people learn what it takes to be successful.\u201d But a warning: \u201cYou have to be talented, you know? This is not something everybody can be successful at. You also have to have taste. You have to be super creative. And you need to be passionate about it.\u201d\n\nRaga joined Depop in 2014, when she was 35. \u201cOperations and finance,\u201d she says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t C-suite at the time.\u201d She had been working as a Groupon executive (\u201cWhen it was, like, super exciting\u201d), but she\u2019d watched the company struggle to create a decent mobile platform, and \u201cit was very obvious that mobile was the next platform\u201d. She liked that Depop was mobile-first. And she liked that it was fashion. In 2016, when the company\u2019s founding CEO left, she was asked by the board to take over.\n\nDepop was already building a huge community of young users. \u201cThey were using social in a smart way,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd the business was very organic.\u201d So she took the job.\n\nUnder Raga\u2019s direction, Depop has surged remarkably, though most of its growth remains organic \u2013 a friend tells a friend, a friend buys from a friend. \u201cIn 2018, there was an 85% year-on-year growth in sales,\u201d Raga says. Depop takes a 10% cut of every item sold through the app, but does not share total sales figures, though the website Techcrunch recently reported that Depop \u201chas handled more than $500m of gross merchandise value since its launch\u201d in 2011. The company is now active in 147 countries and, though it is headquartered in the UK, where most of its 196 full-time employees work, its popularity is rising faster in the US, where Raga has overseen the opening of two bricks-and-mortar shops and the rollout of traditional marketing campaigns. \u201cIt\u2019s our key strategy to grow in the US,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a bigger market.\u201d\n\nShe seems right to make a push now. Raga does not see Depop as a threat to the fashion industry, but she does understand that it is changing. Traditional retail is struggling, she thinks, and fast fashion is all but dead. \u201cConsumers are realising it\u2019s not sustainable,\u201d she says, \u201cand the brands know as well. There are reports that show that in five years resale will be as big as fast fashion.\u201d\n\nThe reports are taken from a recent paper, published by ThredUp, the online secondhand store, in which it was suggested the secondhand clothing market will be worth $51bn by 2023. Last month the department stores Macy\u2019s and JC Penney announced they planned to partner with ThredUp to stock locations across the US with used women\u2019s clothing. \u201cIt\u2019s the way things are moving,\u201d Raga says. Resale\u2019s stock is rising. \u201cThe fashion industry is extremely polluting!\u201d\n\nDepop appeals to young people because young people like to buy cool clothes. But really it appeals because it plays so acutely to a spectrum of teenage ethics and sensibilities: to save the planet from falling apart, sustainability is good and fast fashion is bad; that trends now emerge sideways from the community not top-down from creative directors; that the speciality of today\u2019s 18-year-old is the ability to create a life online, so why not a business, too?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re extending the life of the garment,\u201d Raga puts it, simply, \u201cwhich resonates.\u201d\n\nA while after I met Raga, I messaged a Depop user named Freddie (@shoeshifter; 23,000 followers) about his habit.\n\nIs Depop your job? \u201cMore of a hobby.\u201d\n\nDo your parents understand what you do? \u201cPretty much not at all.\u201d\n\nHow do you feel about the future? \u201cI feel like, as a young person, the chance of getting a job that is consistent and actually well-paid is rare\u2026 Most folk I know have multiple sources of income.\u201d\n\nFreddie is 21. He works in a leisure centre part-time. If he were to have it his own way, he might sell clothes on Depop for a living, but he\u2019s not sure. Could that really be his full-time gig? Sourcing clothes, selling clothes, making money?\n\nSometimes Freddie makes \u00a3500 in a day, but those are the good days. Every now and then he\u2019ll make no money for two weeks straight, and he\u2019ll be at the leisure centre thinking about all the other ways he might make a decent income, what else he might do with his life. This isn\u2019t an uncommon Depop experience \u2013 the ups and downs, the unsureness. Not everyone makes it big! Neither is anxiety about the future of the jobs market specific to Freddie.\n\n\u201cThis is a generation that is not hopeful about the future,\u201d Raga says. They have grown up through a global financial crisis. They have seen money slip away. They have been introduced to political life as though Trump and Brexit were normal politics. When they think of the coming decades, they wonder whether traditional jobs will still exist. \u201cThey are surrounded by bad news,\u201d she says.\n\nWhen Freddie talks about \u201cmultiple streams of income,\u201d he is talking about what Raga calls \u201cthe side-hustle\u201d. \u201cThey do not think careers are going to be step-by-step,\u201d she says. (She puts \u201cstep-by-step\u201d in air commas.) \u201cThey might want to be a musician, they might also have a Depop shop, and they also do something else. They are comfortable doing that,\u201d she thinks, \u201cbecause they are able to financially sustain themselves by doing those things.\u201d Raga is describing an entire cohort subscribing to the gig economy, as though it were not just cool and hip, but necessary and exciting. This is a good thing, she argues. \u201cTechnology is allowing people to earn money in a way they weren\u2019t able to before. Right now, all those old models are shifting. And it\u2019s giving people opportunities in completely different ways.\u201d\n\nMeet the sellers\u2026\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018I sell vintage clothing from the 70s, 80s, 90s and early 2000s\u2019: Magdalena Majewska\n\nI started using Depop almost three years ago. It\u2019s not my main source of income, but I sell daily and I\u2019d like it to be, which is why I\u2019m trying to rebrand: better photos, better lighting, a particular style of clothing. I sell vintage clothing from the 70s, 80s, 90s and early 2000s. Rare or top-quality stuff; some designer pieces \u2013 things that reflect my own interests. I mainly source items from Poland, which is where I\u2019m from, but I travel a lot and I\u2019ve stocked items from Tokyo and Scotland. My customers are from all over the world, and they\u2019re not just girls. I spend about two and a half hours on the app daily \u2013 sales mainly \u2013 and I make around \u00a3200 a week. There have been some weeks when I\u2019ve earned \u00a31,000 and others when I\u2019ve sold nothing at all. There\u2019s no seasonal pattern to it. It\u2019s random. What\u2019s the ambition? I\u2019d like to own a physical store, selling clothes, accessories, things I find interesting. To be able to dedicate my time to sourcing clothes\u2026 that would be awesome.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018I\u2019m a shopaholic, but now I\u2019m buying for other people\u2019: Asal Tehrani\n\nI started during my first week of university. I was 19 then and I just had so many clothes: Nike jumpers, old stuff. I thought, I have to get rid of this! So I started selling my own stuff.\n\nI didn\u2019t think of it as a business, but everything I posted sold in a day, and I thought: \u2018Where can I buy more?\u2019 I\u2019m a shopaholic, but now I\u2019m buying for other people.\n\nI\u2019ve sold 13,299 items. I read chemistry at uni, but this is my full-time job, and I can\u2019t imagine a better-suited one. There are slow weeks, when people are on holiday, away from their phones. But there are surges during people\u2019s downtime, like between 9pm and 11pm, when girls are going to bed, or watching TV, and just scrolling.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018My aim is to make Depop my full-time job\u2019: Tom Evans\n\nI\u2019ve been an entrepreneur since I was 14, and I see an opportunity in Depop to bring together my interests: dance, the LGBTQ community, social image. My main message is about gender nonconformity \u2013 I sell clothes for everyone. I\u2019m a dancer, but my aim is to make Depop my full-time job.
