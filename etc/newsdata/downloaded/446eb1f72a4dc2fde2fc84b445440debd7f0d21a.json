The 78-year-old Vermont senator has repeatedly promised to release his health records at some point, but he outlined a likely timeline in an interview with The Associated Press.\n\n\u201cI want to make it comprehensive,\u201d Sanders said in explaining the delay. \u201cThe answer is I will, probably by the end of the year.\u201d\n\nCampaign manager Faiz Shakir later said more definitively that Sanders does plan to release the records by the end of December. He expects the statement from Sanders\u2018 physician to show Sanders has made a \u201cfull recovery\u201d from the heart attack.\n\nSanders\u2018 health condition adds another layer of complexity to the Democratic Party\u2019s crowded 2020 presidential primary election.\n\nSanders, a self-described democratic socialist, has maintained a place near the top of the field for much of the year, although most polls suggest he\u2019s currently trailing establishment favorite Joe Biden and progressive rival Elizabeth Warren.\n\nHe returned to Iowa Thursday for a two-day swing that features at least five public campaign appearances, several media interviews and a handful of private meetings with local officials as he works to convince voters that he\u2019s physically capable of defeating Trump in 2020.\n\nSanders suggested there wouldn\u2019t anything new to see in the health records once he releases them.\n\nHe noted that he released such information during his 2016 campaign as well.\n\n\u201cNothing much has changed except that I had a heart attack, and I look forward to a full recovery there,\u201d Sanders told the AP. \u201cSo, I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be all too revelatory.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders is planning to release his health records by the end of the year.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Steve Peoples"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/24/election_2020_sanders_54640_c0-216-5178-3236_s1200x700.jpg?a04a5870ed35e6a40f5fe552598fae6d813b4134", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
