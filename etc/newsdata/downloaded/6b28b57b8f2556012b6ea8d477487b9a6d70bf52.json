Trysta Krick recaps it all and looks ahead to the epic finale. USA TODAY\n\nFor the second time in three seasons, the Houston Astros' World Series hopes boil down to a Game 7. They were victorious in the decisive game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2017 and will look to repeat that fortune against the Washington Nationals on Wednesday.\n\nHouston's first Game 7 victory provided little drama, as they jumped out to an early lead and held off the Dodgers in LA, although Game 7 of the World Series is conducive to heroics that etch moments and names into memories and history books.\n\nBelow are just some of the most memorable games and moments in World Series Game 7 history.\n\nChicago Cubs break the curse (2016)\n\nThis historic game began with the rarities right away, as Dexter Fowler cranked the first leadoff homer ever in Game 7 of the World Series on Cleveland Indians starter Corey Kluber's fourth pitch.\n\nThe back-and-forth affair appeared to shift the Indians' way with Rajai Davis' game-tying homer in the eighth off fire-balling closer Aroldis Chapman, but the Cubs took the lead in the 10th and ended their 108-year championship drought three outs later.\n\n'Beautiful chaos': Nationals come out ahead in bizarre \u2013 and hugely consequential \u2013 inning\n\nKate Upton: Verlander's wife sounds off on Twitter about interference call controversy\n\nLegend of Madison Bumgarner grows (2014)\n\nThe cool-blooded southpaw had established himself as a playoff performer already, but his five innings of impeccable relief (four strikeouts, two hits) on two days' rest helped the San Francisco Giants cap off a Fall Classic over the Kansas City Royals in which he gave up one run over 21 innings.\n\nAlex Gordon nearly legged out an inside-the-park homer to tie the game with two outs in the ninth, but Salvador Perez popped up in foul ground to give the Giants their third title in five seasons. For his efforts, Bumgarner was named World Series MVP.\n\nLuis Gonzalez walks it off for the Arizona Diamondbacks (2001)\n\nThe comeback against the game's best reliever of all time, New York Yankees closer Mariano Rivera, began when Mark Grace led off the ninth with a single up the middle. Rivera then fired a sac bunt attempt into center field before Tony Womack lined a double down the line to tie it at 2-2.\n\nTwo batters later, Luis Gonzalez fisted a ball over a drawn-in infield to plate David Bell \u2014 arms raised \u2014 and give Arizona its first championship.\n\nEdgar Renteria's walk-off single for the Florida Marlins (1997)\n\nBefore Gonzalez, Renteria made hitting a walk-off single up the middle for a fledgling organization's first World Series title cool.\n\nFive seasons into their existence, the Marlins won the 1997 World Series over the Cleveland Indians on Renteria's 11th-inning stinger into center that scored now-Milwaukee Brewers manager Craig Counsell, who tied the game in the ninth with a sacrifice fly.\n\nGene Larkin's walk-off knock (1991)\n\nJack Morris and John Smotlz engaged in a pitching duel for the ages, with Smoltz lasting 7 1/3 innings and Morris lasting all 10 innings. In the bottom of the 10th with the bases juiced, Larkin drove a ball to left off Alejandro Pe\u00f1a and Dan Gladden scored the game-winning run.\n\nBill Mazeroski's walk-off homer for the Pittsburgh Pirates (1960)\n\nThe only World Series Game 7 walkoff home run, Mazeroski drove a 1-0 offering from Ralph Terry over the left-field wall to win the game 10-9 after the Yankees scored twice in the ninth to tie the game.\n\nThe Yankees' Bobby Richardson won the series MVP, marking the only time a player from the losing side has received the award.\n\nJohnny Podres shutout (1955)\n\nStill seeking their first World Series title, the Brooklyn Dodgers sent 22-year-old Johnny Podres to the mound and the lefty responded by pitching a shutout.\n\nPodres scattered eight hits and fanned four as Brooklyn won, 2-0, over the rival New York Yankees.\n\nFollow Chris Bumbaca on Twitter @BOOMbaca.", "description": "Before the Washington Nationals and Houston Astros square off in Game 7 of the World Series, relive some of the best World Series Game 7 contests.", "authors": ["Christopher Bumbaca", "Published A.M.
