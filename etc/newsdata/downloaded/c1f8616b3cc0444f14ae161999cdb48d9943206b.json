With respect, if a president were to be impeached more than once, what is the meaning of impeachment? Will Republican senators be willing to vote to eject Mr. Trump from the presidency, which is what the Senate trial is about, on the basis of one issue, no matter how repellent?\n\nI suggest taking other issues into account, without going into detail, in a second article of impeachment that would accompany the one centering on Ukraine.", "description": "", "authors": ["Elizabeth Drew", "Nytimes.Com Opinion Republicans-Impeachment-Inquiry.Html"], "top_image": ""}
