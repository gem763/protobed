Photo: Liberty County Sheriff\u2019s Office\n\nThe brother of Olympic champion gymnast Simone Biles was arrested yesterday on charges related to a triple homicide in Cleveland. Tevin Biles-Thomas, 24, is the only person law enforcement has connected so far to a shooting on New Year\u2019s Eve that left three dead.\n\nCleveland police say Biles-Thomas was present at a New Year\u2019s Eve party at an Airbnb above a pizzeria where a fight broke out after a group of men had shown up uninvited and were asked to leave. Gunfire ensued, and Devaughn Gibson, 23, DelVaunte Johnson, 19, and Toshon Banks, 21, died after they were each shot multiple times. Two others were wounded but survived.\n\nBiles-Thomas has been charged with murder, voluntary manslaughter, felonious assault, and perjury. According to Cleveland.com, he is in the U.S. Army. Biles-Thomas is one of Simone Biles\u2019s four siblings; their mother, Shanon, was addicted to drugs and alcohol when they were children, and they were in foster care before being taken in by Shanon\u2019s father, Ronald. Ronald Biles officially adopted Simone and her sister Adria, the two youngest children, and Ronald\u2019s sister Harriet adopted Tevin and the eldest sister, Ashley.\n\nSimone Biles, 22, has not commented on her brother\u2019s arrest, though she did Tweet, \u201ceating my feelings don\u2019t talk to me\u201d yesterday evening. Earlier this month, Biles clinched a record-tying sixth title at the U.S. Gymnastics Championships, where she landed two history-making flips. Tevin Biles-Thomas is set to be arraigned on September 13.", "description": "Tevin Biles-Thomas, 24, the brother of Olympic champion Simone Biles, has been arrested in connection with a triple murder at a house party in Cleveland.", "authors": ["Bridget Read"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/08/30/30-Tevin-Biles-Thomas-Liberty-County-Sheriffs-Office.w1200.h630.jpg"}
