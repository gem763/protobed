Directors of the \u00a313.6m Driven programme, a partially government-funded consortium, said it had \u201cexceeded their initial plan\u201d and was a significant step in confirming autonomous vehicles could operate in real-life situations in a large European city.\n\nOxbotica said first passenger trials of a separate venture, an autonomous ride-sharing taxi service planned with the cab firm Addison Lee in the capital, could now start in June 2020.\n\nThe Driven team \u2013 a combination of local authority planners, insurers, cyber-security and data experts, as well as Oxbotica \u2013 have been conducting trials in Oxford to examine what they called the \u201cecosystem\u201d around autonomous vehicles, such as potential problems with hackers, communications technology and the legal framework.\n\nFor now, the cars are operated with a safety driver in the front seat ready to take control, and prompted by the technology to decide whether to intervene in difficult situations. On an otherwise autonomous spin around Stratford\u2019s East Village, through A-roads, traffic intersections and residential streets, the safety driver in the Guardian\u2019s car only once opted to grab the wheel as a precaution, when an oncoming minicab swerved around a parked lorry.\n\nDr Graeme Smith, Driven\u2019s programme director and Oxbotica\u2019s senior vice president, said the project was making \u201cautonomous vehicles a reality on our roads\u201d.\n\nBuses and taxis to lead UK self-driving public transport push Read more\n\nHe said: \u201cThe car is a bauble on top of the iceberg: underpinning that is a host of other things that need to happen, from cybersecurity to ensure we have constant, secure communication; insurers for product liability and real-life risk assessment.\u201d\n\nSmith added that while there would be \u201csmall pockets\u201d of autonomous transport, the constraints meant the cars were \u201cat least five years away from being a service for robotaxis, and 10 years for showrooms.\u201d\n\nProf Paul Newman, the founder and chief technical officer of Oxbotica, said the ambition for the British technology went well beyond driverless cars, with a system removed from GPS tracking and not reliant on maps. He said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to change the way people and goods move anywhere and everywhere.\u201d\n\nWider use of autonomy in the mining and construction sectors was likely before transport, he said.\n\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\nIf Mondeo Man was once emblematic of a certain type of Briton, some might worry to see the Ford car\u2019s driver supplanted by a computer in the boot and a set of sensors on the roof.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt we\u2019re not going to be sitting behind wheels in the future. But there will be different jobs around the technology,\u201d Newman said. \u201cIt is going to be a revolution but not a tragedy: more people will survive [on roads]; these vehicles will share their experiences and be even safer.\u201d\n\nGeorge Freeman, the transport minister, said the successful Driven trial \u201ccements our position as a global leader in this space\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, the first public demonstrations of Britain\u2019s first full-size autonomous bus took place in Birmingham, on a test route on the National Exhibition Centre car park. The single-deckers will start trials carrying up to 42 passengers on a 15-mile route between Fife and Edinburgh next year.", "description": "Self-driving vehicles reach UK milestone with first demo in \u2018complex urban environment\u2019 in Stratford", "authors": ["Gwyn Topham"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3f6577db93c4fd46f4ebe161096f387bbf1e803/2657_1449_9537_5722/master/9537.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=50ced3d240686d12e451dda85038e9ff"}
