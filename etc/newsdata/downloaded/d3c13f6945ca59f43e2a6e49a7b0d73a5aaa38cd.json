While he was clearly looking for validation, many people deemed him a monster for being so self-absorbed.\n\nFury: A man caused outrage on Reddit after asking whether he is an a**hole for demanding that his wife cook a vegetarian meal for him while struggling with endometriosis (stock image)\n\n'My wife and I have been together for 4 years. I have been a vegetarian for nearly ten years, but prior to that, loved eating meat dearly,' he explained.\n\nAlthough his wife enjoys eating meat, she has reduced her consumption because they have a small grocery budget and typically don't buy things they can't both eat.\n\n'I have no problem with her eating meat and bringing it into our home. My choices are my choices and hers are hers,' he insisted.\n\nBut things came to a head last week when his wife decided to make Ina Garten's bolognese recipe, her 'favorite cold weather food.'\n\n'Typically, if she\u2019s making something with meat, she will make a separate batch of the same food, just vegetarian friendly, or make me a separate meal,' he explained.\n\n'I can\u2019t really cook much, so when she doesn\u2019t cook for me I will gravitate toward frozen or canned food, or sandwiches.'\n\nHowever, this time, she asked if it was okay if she didn't make him a vegetarian version because she was having an endometriosis flare-up and 'this particular dish requires a lot of work, care, and timing.'\n\nOutrage: The man's confession left Reddit users furious on his wife's behalf, with many saying that there was no doubt who was in the wrong in this situation\n\nEndometriosis is an often painful disorder in which tissue similar to the lining of the uterus \u2014 the endometrium \u2014 grows outside the uterus. It most commonly affects the ovaries, Fallopian tubes, and the tissue lining the pelvis.\n\nShe told him that making two batches would not only be expensive, but it would also be 'hours of work and energy that she doesn't have.'\n\nThe Reddit user said he asked if it was possible for her to just leave the meat out until the end, but she told him that it was important for it to cook with the tomatoes and wine.\n\n'I asked her then what she was going to make for me if she was going to make this big elaborate meal for herself, and she got defensive and said \"you can\u2019t cook for yourself tonight?\" in a rude tone,' he recounted.\n\n'I argued calmly that I felt like I was being cheated out of a nice meal of her incredible cooking, and I didn\u2019t think it was cool for her to ask me to dedicate this money of our budget to a meal that was going to only be for her,' he admitted.\n\n'She said she would pay extra for the ingredients, but I told her that wasn\u2019t the point. She burst into tears and asked why I was being so f*****g difficult about this, when she wasn\u2019t feeling well and just wanted to do something that made her happy. Now I feel like a d**k.'\n\nUpset: Many people showed sympathy for the man's wife for having to put up with his behavior\n\nCommenters were outraged by the man's actions, to the point that he returned to the post and tried to explain himself, which actually made things worse.\n\n'So, to clarify, in the division of labor in our home, wife is the one who cooks. I\u2019m the head of household and make sure all the bills get paid, and I keep the house clean. She cooks for us and makes sure we always have weed when we want it (legal state),' he wrote.\n\nThe man claimed to understand what his critics were saying and agreed he 'should probably apologize to her,' but he couldn't resist asking if this was an 'ESH (Everyone Sucks Here)' type of situation.\n\nThe answer was a resounding no.\n\n'Dude. You're a whole grown up. It's time to learn how to cook,' one person commented. 'Also, as someone of Italian heritage, I'm shook that you suggested she add the meat at the end. My Nonna says turn on your location bro she just wants to talk.'\n\n'Can\u2019t cook = won\u2019t. This fool suuuuuuuuuucks,' someone else wrote, while another asked: 'Dude, you really think saying you're the \"Head of the household\" makes you less of an a**hole?'\n\n'She\u2019s your wife not your mother and you\u2019re not a child,' one Reddit user pointed out. 'You already said she doesn\u2019t feel well and she\u2019s trying to make a comfort meal for herself it is incredibly self centered and selfish to ask her not to make her favorite meal.'", "description": "Reddit user zimbello-13 asked if was in the wrong for not wanting his wife of four years to make herself a dinner she wanted because there was meat in it.", "authors": ["Erica Tempesta For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/12/19719126-0-image-a-13_1571138987088.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
