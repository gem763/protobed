We continue to grow and invest heavily in the UK and by the end of the year we'll employ 3,000 people here.\n\n\"Businesses across the country use our platforms to grow and revenue from customers supported by our UK teams is now recorded here so that any taxable profit is subject to UK corporation tax.\"\n\nFacebook said it complies with tax laws in all jurisdictions and pays what is legally due.\n\nBut Ms Hodge, a former chairwoman of the Public Accounts Committee, and who now leads an all-party parliamentary group looking into the tax system, tweeted that it was \"still outrageous\" that big tech firms were not paying their fair share into society.\n\nSkip Twitter post by @margarethodge One year later and little has changed. This year Facebook paid \u00a328m of tax on UK income of \u00a31.6bn. These big corporations simply must pay more tax. They rely on our infrastructure, our expertise, and our sales so they must pay their fair share into society. Still outrageous https://t.co/FJqXfmXRFJ \u2014 Margaret Hodge (@margarethodge) October 11, 2019 Report\n\nLast month, Amazon came under fire for paying \u00a314.7m in UK corporation tax last year, despite reporting sales of \u00a32.3bn. Google has faced similar criticism.\n\nEarlier this week, the Organisation for Economic and Development (OECD), proposed tax changes aimed at making global firms pay more tax.\n\nThe proposals would give governments more power specifically to tax big technology firms such as Apple, Facebook and Google.\n\nCompanies that do business in more than one country have long been a challenge for tax authorities, because they can structure their business in a way that minimises their tax bills.\n\nThe OECD's proposal includes new rules on where tax should be paid and on the proportion of their profits that should be taxed in each country.", "description": "Tech firms have been criticised for the amount of tax they pay, but Facebook says it pays what is legally owed.", "authors": ["Russell Hotten", "Business Reporter", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/143C/production/_105408150_gettyimages-1090299210.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
