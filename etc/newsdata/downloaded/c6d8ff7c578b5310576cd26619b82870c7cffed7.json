Especially since \u201chavoc\u201d is a gross euphemism for what Mrs. Lam has done. She has undermined constitutional guarantees and political freedoms. She has politicized what was once a professional police force and turned it into a tool of oppression that acts at the behest of Beijing. She has given the police unheard-of license to make arrests in hospitals and bully patients , and to mistreat \u2014 my euphemism this time \u2014 protesters and reporters at the front lines. The special governance system that Beijing had promised would govern Hong Kong and keep it distinct from the mainland until at least 2047 has been thoroughly trampled.\n\nYet it is to a small group of businesspeople \u2014 and presumably a very select bunch of those \u2014 that Mrs. Lam made \u201c a plea to you for your forgiveness .\u201d But forgiveness for what, from them? For allowing the protesters to close down the airport for a couple of days? For sending a little tremor through the real estate market, still sky-high, which has made developers so very rich for so very long ? For knocking some 5,000 points off the Hang Seng Index since May? For hurting the city\u2019s big corporate families?\n\nMrs. Lam has yet to properly ask for the forgiveness of Hong Kongers. (In June, she said, \u201cI offer my most sincere apology to all people of Hong Kong,\u201d but then flatly refused to do anything they asked.) In her talk to the business group, she recited almost verbatim from the Basic Law, Hong Kong\u2019s mini-Constitution, that in her capacity as chief executive she is required to serve two masters: the central government in Beijing and the people of Hong Kong. In fact, she seems to be serving only Beijing and a small business elite in Hong Kong.\n\nOnly, other swaths of the business sector have had little patience for Mrs. Lam\u2019s intransigence. The Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce pointedly asked her to make serious concessions toward the protesters in late July.\n\nAnd so finally on Wednesday, Mrs. Lam announced the formal withdrawal of a bill that would allow the extradition of criminal suspects to mainland China, one of five of the protesters\u2019 demands. This is ridiculous on her part, after holding out all summer as she has while protesters have been tear-gassed, maimed and subjected to cruel treatment by the police \u2014 and while much of the city\u2019s population has supported them, turning up for marches in the hundreds of thousands. At this stage, nothing short of the government\u2019s addressing the protesters\u2019 fifth, and most sweeping, demand \u2014 real universal suffrage for both executive and legislative elections \u2014 can be enough. Some protesters have already declared on the online forum LIHKG, \u201c Five Demands. Not One Less.\u201d", "description": "The city\u2019s leader finally makes a concession \u2014 caving to Beijing and big business.", "authors": ["Yi-Zheng Lian"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/04/opinion/04lian/04lian-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg"}
