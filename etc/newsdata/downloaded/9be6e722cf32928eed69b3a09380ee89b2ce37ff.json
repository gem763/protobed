The Raging Bull star called Trump a \u201cdirty player\u201d while speaking at at the BFI London Film Festival and told The Guardian news paper that he \u201ccan\u2019t wait to see\u201d America\u2019s president behind bars.\n\n\u201cToday, everything\u2019s been turned upside-down because of Trump because he\u2019s such a dirty player. It\u2019s amazing to me that\u2019s he\u2019s\u2026getting away with it. He won\u2019t get away with it forever, but he is getting away with saying these things about every institution,\u201d De Niro told the BFI audience. \u201cWe have to defend these institutions, plus the Fourth Estate, the press, because he\u2019s trying to destroy them and for only one reason: to save himself. And we all know this.\u201d\n\nThe Oscar-winner used a Q&A segment of the event to skewer Trump again, saying \u201cIt\u2019s pretty disgusting that we\u2019ve got Republicans there who are just so afraid to do anything, so afraid to stand up.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey could be stars in their own communities. They are. They could go into private practice, make more money and stand up and still be very vocal against him, and I don\u2019t know why they don\u2019t do that,\u201d De Niro said. \u201cCertain senators have pulled out\u2026but others could pull out, get out and say, \u2018I can\u2019t be in this administration. I\u2019ve got to speak out constantly against this administration because we have to right this wrong.'\u201d\n\nElsewhere, while promoting his forthcoming Martin Scorsese crime drama, De Niro told The Guardian that Trump is \u201ca gangster president\u201d and said \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see him in jail.\u201d\n\nAccording to Variety, De Niro\u2019s anti-Trump European tour dates back to Friday when the Meet the Fockers star appeared on the BBC\u2019s The Graham Norton Show and said: \u201cToday, we have a weird, twisted president who thinks he\u2019s a gangster, who\u2019s not even a very good gangster.\u201d\n\n\u201cGangsters have honor, you shake a hand and they have your word and you have theirs and that\u2019s it. But with this guy, it\u2019s not the case,\u201d Robert De Niro said.\n\nThe Irishman, set to debut in a limited theatrical release on November 1 and then to Netflix on November 27, stars Al Pacino, and Joe Pesci.\n\nJerome Hudson is Breitbart News Entertainment Editor and author of the bestselling book 50 Things They Don\u2019t Want You to Know.
