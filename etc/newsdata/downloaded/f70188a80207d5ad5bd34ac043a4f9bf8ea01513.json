Jerry Nadler (N.Y.) and Rep. Adam Schiff (Calif.).\n\nHe singled out the women even though as of Saturday they were among at least 223 House Democrats\ufeff who now support an impeachment inquiry. Nader is head of the House Judiciary Committee, and Schiff leads the Intelligence Committee, both key groups in the impeachment inquiry against Trump.\n\nTrump has previously used the term \u201csavages\u201d to refer to terrorists and criminals: members of ISIS and the violent gang MS-13.\n\nCan you imagine if these Do Nothing Democrat Savages, people like Nadler, Schiff, AOC Plus 3, and many more, had a Republican Party who would have done to Obama what the Do Nothings are doing to me. Oh well, maybe next time! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 28, 2019\n\nIn July, Trump called for the group to \u201cgo back\u201d to the \u201cbroken and crime infested places from which they came\u201d \u2014 even though all are American citizens, and three were born in this country.\n\nOne of the most scathing responses came from Democratic presidential candidate and former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke, who tweeted that Trump used the term \u201csavages\u201d because he \u201cwants you to think of them as less than human.\u201d\n\nWhen he calls 6 members of Congress\u2014all women of color or Jewish\u2014\u201csavages,\u201d he wants you to think of them as less than human. Like when he calls immigrants an \u201cinfestation\u201d and says \"no human being\" would want to live in Baltimore. We can\u2019t be surprised when violence follows. https://t.co/F0fVi3MmD8 \u2014 Beto O'Rourke (@BetoORourke) September 28, 2019\n\nOcasio-Cortez appeared to shrug off the insult. One of her Twitter followers quipped that \u201cAOC plus 3 is the most NY remix ever.\u201d The congresswoman responded that it \u201cshould really be\u201d Rep. Ayanna Pressley plus 3 since she\u2019s the \u201cbest singer,\u201d adding: \u201cI\u2019m just the one holding the wind fan.\u201d\n\nTo be honest, it should really be @AyannaPressley plus 3 since she is *easily* the best singer out of all of us.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m just the one holding the wind fan \ud83c\udf2c https://t.co/RZtZzS4OiK \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) September 28, 2019\n\nInstead of commenting on Trump\u2019s tweet, Omar, who is Muslim, responded on Saturday to an anti-impeachment ad blitz by the Trump campaign on Facebook this week, which is also targeting the Squad.\n\nSome of the ads, which refer to the women as the \u201csocialist squad,\u201d accuse them of making \u201cpro-terrorist remarks,\u201d The Washington Post reported. Omar called it \u201ctextbook Islamaphobic hate speech \u2014 not to mention blatantly false.\u201d\n\nCalling Muslim representatives \u201cpro-terrorist\u201d is textbook Islamophobic hate speech\u2014not to mention blatantly false.\n\n\n\nFacebook is allowing open hate speech from the President of the United States on its platform\u2014and profiting off it. https://t.co/PZHp7AnAua \u2014 Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) September 28, 2019\n\nThe House launched a formal impeachment inquiry earlier this week following a whistleblower complaint that Trump repeatedly urged Ukraine\u2019s president in a July phone call to initiate an investigation into his political rival Joe Biden and Biden\u2019s son.
