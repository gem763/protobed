Although clickbait titles are on the decrease, in part due to Facebook banning those types of sites, there is still a lot of drama that is unwarranted. It has led to an effort to impeach President Trump by Democrats, based on a misleading account by a so-called whistleblower of a conversation Trump had with the Ukrainian president. The transcript of the phone call has been released, exonerating Trump, but there is a continued media barrage claiming he is guilty of a quid pro quo. They have built up something minor into something they claim is impeachable.\n\nFrankly, I\u2019m tired of all the overhyped headlines claiming the worst is happening. There are thousands of new news sites popping up all the time, something we didn\u2019t have to deal with 20 years ago. I click on an article and it\u2019s rarely half as drastic as the title proclaims. I feel like I\u2019m constantly in this stage of raised adrenalin from reading the titles. I don\u2019t appreciate the undue stress. I understand that news sources now make money based on how many clicks they\u2019re getting on articles, so they deliberately hype things up. But it is affecting politics. It has made it easier to believe the worst about people. It is contributing to a feeling that maybe Trump really should be impeached.\n\nThe Drudge Report, which used to be fairly conservative, is now posting hysterical headlines against Trump. As I\u2019m writing this, the top featured article there is entitled \u201c30 Minutes That Changed Trump Presidency.\u201d It links to a biased left-wing article from the Associated Press, which claims that the phone call between Trump and the Ukrainian president has really hurt Trump\u2019s presidency. How do they know? Nothing has happened yet, other than the Democrats deciding to start impeachment proceedings \u2014 something they\u2019ve been threatening the entire time he\u2019s been in office so nothing new there.\n\nThe Drudge Report has also hyped up negative polls about Trump (\u201cshock poll\u201d), including a Fox News poll that showed 51 percent of voters want Trump impeached. But nowhere was there a breakdown of the demographics of those polled. Many polls are biased by surveying a larger proportion of Democrats than Republicans. Rasmussen Reports, a reliably conservative polling company that was the most accurate pollster in the 2016 election, analyzed a previous Fox News poll from July about impeachment. The company found that the poll breakdown was 46 percent Democrat and only 40 percent Republican. Another problem with the survey is it polled registered voters, not likely voters. That tends to favor Democrats.\n\nTrump tweeted that only 25 percent want him impeached. It is not clear what poll he was referring to. A recent September poll from Rasmussen Reports found that only 17 percent believe Trump will be impeached.\n\nI waste a lot of time clicking on the links to overly hyped articles that others post on social media. I get partially through an article merely to find out that it doesn\u2019t live up to its headline or description. Yet it will be massively shared all throughout social media. In this era, people hit \u201cshare\u201d too often without actually reading the article. A study found that 59 percent of people hit share without actually clicking on the article. If they would actually read the article, they might discover that it is overhyped, from a sketchy site and not worth sharing.\n\nThe Science Post ran an article last year entitled \u201cStudy: 70% of Facebook users only read the headline of science stories before commenting.\u201d The first paragraph sounded valid, although vague. The rest of the article was just a block of generic Latin text. However, 46,000 people shared it.\n\nThe overhyping of news just stirs up more hate from groups like Antifa. They believe every headline and article that claims Trump supporters are Nazis and white supremacists. Ironically, they follow the famous line of Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, \u201cIf you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it.\u201d\n\nThe partisanship of politics is no longer just about the issues. It now includes the media and social media framing the issues. A chorus of voices \u2014 especially influential media voices \u2014 can escalate the most mundane situation into something dire. We\u2019re not talking about politicians murdering people in these hyped up stories. Murder stories should generate outrage. In contrast, we\u2019re talking about behavior that has not yet been investigated, much less prosecuted.\n\nIt\u2019s like the boy who cried wolf. People are becoming so desensitized to the constant hyped up articles that when a real scandal comes along, they won\u2019t recognize the seriousness of it.\n\nIt would be nice if we could return to the days of William F. Buckley, Jr. He discussed current issues on his show Firing Line in a calm, even-keeled manner. He didn\u2019t need to talk hysterically about every topic, people still watched his show in droves. Unfortunately, that may not be possible anymore since news organizations make money based on how many clicks articles get. The way to get around this is readers should stop clicking on the hyped up titles and be more selective about which sites they visit.", "description": "Are you tired of hearing that every little thing occurring .10/14/2019 1:15:18AM EST.", "authors": ["Rachel Alexander", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/249/24006230-ba54-4f43-af4e-2e44fa7063da.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
