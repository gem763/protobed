What do you spend your time doing?", "language": "en", "text": "Every Wednesday we ask our Brain Game contestants one interesting, thought-provoking or just plain quirky question. Their answers will be published anonymously in Young Post. Then readers can vote for their FAVOURITE answer. We will eliminate the contestant with the LEAST votes every week until we have a winner.\n\nThe ultimate Brain Game winner will have the chance to encounter animals with their best friend at Ocean Park, a prize worth HK$3,236.\n\nVotes close at midnight on Sunday.\n\nThe contestants\n\n(L -R) Saima and Hilary Lo\n\n\n\nContestant 1\n\nThere\u2019d be a lot of things to do if you were the only one left on Earth. You\u2019d be excited, as well as nervous, because there wouldn\u2019t be anyone else to guide you. You\u2019d also be really sad because your family members weren\u2019t here anymore, but you would have to move on no matter what.\n\nFirst, being a foodie, I would go to the nearest supermarket and get a lot of snacks, particularly chocolate, without paying since no one would be there. Isn\u2019t that the coolest thing ever?! Then I would go to McDonald\u2019s or Starbucks and enjoy a meal there.\n\nSecond, I would just choose a car on the street and drive it \u2013 I actually don\u2019t have a driving licence but I wouldn\u2019t need it, right? Also, I wouldn\u2019t need to worry about crashing into people. What\u2019s more, I could break all the traffic rules and still get away with it.\n\nThird, I would drive to Ocean Park and see the dolphins and sea lions. There would be no one to feed them or take care of them, so I would have to do that. I would also go to the Hong Kong Wetland Park and feed the animals there, too. I wonder what Pui Pui \u2013 Hong Kong\u2019s celebrity crocodile \u2013 would eat. I believe that would take up my first day. The following days would pass by quickly, and then I\u2019d end up feeling that there was nothing left to do. That\u2019s why I would never want to be the only person left on Earth!\n\nContestant 2\n\nHoly! Was there a world war, or a second Black Death, or did Donald Trump kill off the whole world except me with his orangey- and blobfish-like presence? Or did some of those cringey musical.ly stars poison the entire world by acting inappropriately and thinking the world of themselves? Wait, it could even be global warming (I told you, save the environment or prepare for doomsday!).\n\nI think the latter three scenarios would be the most likely ones. But anyway, if I were the last person on Earth, there\u2019d be a high chance of me dying like everyone else did, so I\u2019d leave something behind as proof or evidence of what happened to us. This would help any aliens or future organisms solve the mystery of how humans vanished from the face of the Earth. I would record my thoughts and views on the important events or people who caused this devastation on tape and make several copies.\n\nI would also scatter hints around Earth and leave clues, along with a map of important places, to help future investigators understand what caused our extinction (but I\u2019d make sure only smart couch potatoes like me would be able to solve this).\n\nI\u2019d also write a letter, something like: \u201cOoh, where you from? Must be heaven! Or another planet because every person just died, probably because of Trump Phobia (thanks, Fifth Harmony!).\u201d I\u2019d tell them how advanced humans were. I mean, we invented #throwbackthursdays and we were so #tumblr, dude.\n\nThose tapes would be sent everywhere, until the right person / creature figured it out. Then I would also become famous because of my contributions to history (who knows, maybe a super-hot alien would fall in love with me, jkjk).\n\nI credit my tape idea to 13 Reasons Why ... but who can blame me, right? That show\u2019s only downside is that you can finish it in like one day.\n\nThat\u2019s probably why we became extinct. The show was just too short. Ahh, it\u2019s all your fault, 13 Reasons Why. And to the people who caused the extinction, don\u2019t go all Biebs on me and ask me \u201cIs it too late now to say sorry?\u201d, because if you\u2019re hearing this tape, it really is.\n\nDUN-DUN-DUNN!", "description": "The ultimate Brain Game winner will have the chance to encounter animals with their best friend at Ocean Park, a prize worth HK$3,236.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/bg310517.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
