The new deployment will essentially reverse what Donald Trump has been promoting as a withdrawal from the country and has antagonised Russia who have called it \u201cinternational state banditry\u201d.\n\nThe White House\u2019s continuously evolving position on Syria in the past two weeks proves that the reality on the ground is more complicated than how it looks from the Oval Office. Latest developments show that disentangling the US military from Syria may not be happening anytime soon. And President Trump\u2019s reasoning for the sometimes contradicting decisions has been unconvincing.\n\nThe argument that American troops need to be deployed to protect oil fields in eastern Syria has already been met with criticism. Oil reserves in Syria are not very significant and have been decreasing since before the war. There is speculation that the latest decision is about more than just oil and is a way for the United States to try to keep some presence in Syria.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

American forces have been stationed in Syria to fight Isis but did not need tanks for that mission. The new deployment could be planned for potential threats from the Syrian army and its Russian allies.\n\nRobert Rabil, professor of political science at Florida Atlantic University, says the US presence in Syria is becoming increasingly dangerous. \u201cSooner or later American troops will face Russian and Syrian forces as they will try to control all of Syria,\u201d he told The Independent. \u201cSyrian Kurdish fighters will not be able to support the US like before, given their recent agreement with the Syrian and Russian governments.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Arab League leaders are embracing Syria\u2019s foreign minister and soon will be invited in,\u201d Mr Rabil said.\n\nMr Trump has also suggested that the \u201cKurds\u201d start moving to the oil region in Syria. But it was not clear exactly who he meant by that, whether he is referring to the Kurdish fighters in Syria or the millions of Syrian Kurds who live in the country. And even if this relocation does happen, it could create fresh new problems in the region.\n\nKurdish forces will be in a difficult position as they are now stuck between the Syrian government and its Russian ally, with whom they made a new deal; Turkey, which wants them out of the region; and the United States, which has just betrayed them. The Kurds will most likely rethink and re-evaluate their interests and their future before supporting the US, experts say.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s policy in the Middle East seems to be incoherent and lacks much strategy. It has also often been at odds with some of his closest aides and senior cabinet members. Experts argue that despite its rubric of withdrawal, the Trump administration\u2019s policy is in fact moving towards more deployments and potential conflicts.", "description": "The US plan\u00a0to send armoured vehicles and possibly tanks accompanied by combat troops to eastern Syria to \u201csecure\u201d oil fields from Isis\u00a0could mean deploying several hundred and potentially thousands of American forces to the area.", "authors": ["Negar Mortazavi"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/25/21/idlib-.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
