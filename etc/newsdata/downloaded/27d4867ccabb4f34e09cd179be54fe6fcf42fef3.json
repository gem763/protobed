Rick Perry announced he would soon step aside amid scrutiny from House Democrats conducting an impeachment inquiry.\n\nA massive crowd gathered outside the American Airlines Center to watch the speech on a large screen, as the president launched into an extended critique of 2020 Democratic presidential candidates -- calling Beto O'Rourke \"very dumb,\" and remarking that Joe Biden has no chance at the nomination.\n\nThe rally came at a critical time for Trump, whose dealings with the president of Ukraine have been the subject of a quickly unfolding impeachment inquiry run by House Democrats. Perry was subpoenaed earlier Thursday by House committees conducting the probe.\n\nRepublicans have raised concerns that they might take a historic beating in Texas in 2020, as more suburban voters have balked at the president. Trump carried the longtime Republican stronghold and its 38 Electoral College votes by only 9 points in 2016 -- down from Mitt Romney's 15-point win in 2012.\n\nWHY IS RICK PERRY STEPPING DOWN?\n\nAnd, Democrats have pointed to demographic trends as well as the fact that Republican Sen. Ted Cruz won reelection by just over 2 points last year as evidence that the second-most-populous state could soon be in play.\n\n\u201cI expect President Trump to win Texas by 5 percentage points, not 9 points this time,\u201d Southern Methodist University political science professor Cal Jillson told Politico. \u201cThere are long-term demographic changes taking place in the state that eat into Republican support. The major cities like Austin, Houston and Dallas are already leaning blue. Plus, his Republican coalition has been destabilized by his own actions and conduct.\"\n\nAt the same time, Trump's campaign and the RNC have been raking in money, raising a record $125 million in the third quarter of this year. By comparison, former President Obama and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) raised just over $70 million in the third quarter of 2011 for his reelection campaign.\n\nThe RNC raised a record-setting $27.3 million just last month and had $59.2 million cash as of the end of August, amid the impeachment push against the president -- which has fueled GOP campaign contributions heading into the 2020 election.\n\nThis cycle, to date, the RNC has more than doubled the DNC's fundraising efforts, according to the GOP, which also noted that the Democrats, as of last month, carried $7.3 million in debt.\n\nThe campaign continued to haul in cash Thursday. Trump began his trip at a fundraiser in Fort Worth that raised about $5.5 million for Trump Victory, a joint fundraising committee benefiting the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee. Looking to promote new jobs, Trump then toured the recently built Louis Vuitton plant in Alvarado with his daughter and senior adviser Ivanka Trump.\n\nDEMS STORM OUT OF WHITE HOUSE MEETING WITH TRUMP, SAY HE CALLED PELOSI A 'NASTY' NAME AND DECLARED, 'I HATE ISIS MORE THAN YOU!'\n\n\"I've seen that before,\" Trump told his tour guides while pointing to one of the iconic bags set up on a table.\n\nWhile Republicans largely have defended Trump, they have sounded alarms over his decision to pull U.S. troops out of northern Syria \u2014 a move that paved the way for Turkey to invade and assault the Kurds, who'd fought alongside the U.S. in its campaign against Islamic State militants.\n\nUpon landing in Texas on Thursday, Trump credited his threat of sanctions on Turkey and the violence that has unfolded for the announcement of a cease-fire, though critics said Trump green-lit the incursion and put the Kurdish forces in danger by announcing a U.S. troop withdrawal.\n\nTrump described the cease-fire as an \"incredible outcome\" that could not have occurred \"unless you went somewhat unconventional.\"\n\nA White House meeting between Trump and congressional lawmakers to discuss the situation Wednesday devolved into an insult-fest, with the president calling House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., a \"third-grade politician,\" and Pelosi and other top Democrats storming out.\n\nA senior aide for the Democrats told Fox News that Trump began the meeting, which ostensibly had been called by the White House, by remarking that \"someone wanted this meeting so I agreed to it.\" Trump also was said to have told Pelosi, \"I hate ISIS more than you do,\" prompting Pelosi to respond, \"You don't know that.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTrump and Pelosi continued to trade jabs after the meeting, with each accusing the other of having a meltdown.\n\nAs the Democrats walked out, Trump reportedly remarked, \"I'll see you at the polls.\"", "description": "President Trump\u00a0was headlining a campaign rally on friendly turf in Dallas, Texas on Thursday, just hours after\u00a0Energy Secretary and former Texas Gov.\u00a0Rick Perry announced he would soon step aside amid scrutiny from House Democrats conducting an impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Gregg Re", "Gregg Re Is A Lawyer", "Editor Based In Los Angeles.
