If anyone is fitting of a claim to The Queen\u2019s spot in our attraction for the very first time, it\u2019s Beyonc\u00e9.\u201d\n\nDavies added that Bey will only take stand in for the Queen for \u201cone day before her figure moves to own our music stage,\u201d but the museum felt that because \u201cHRH Queen Elizabeth II is famous for her mischievous sense of humour ... a wry smile will cross her face when she sees that music royalty has temporarily filled her shoes.\u201d\n\nFans in London can see Bey front and center with the royals on Friday, Sept. 20.\n\nThis iteration of Bey\u2019s likeness is a major upgrade from how the museum has represented her in the past. In 2017, many people lambasted an earlier version of her wax figure.\n\nTheory: Beyonc\u00e9 wax figure makers have never seen Beyonc\u00e9 pic.twitter.com/bZ2PWCUzUs \u2014 Michelle Lee (@heymichellelee) July 19, 2017\n\nHopefully Madame Tussauds will replace the less-realistic figures of Beyonc\u00e9 in its other locations with versions that look more like this new one \u2014 because we\u2019re crazy in love with it.", "description": "Madam Tussauds will put the singer\u2019s statue in Queen Elizabeth\u2019s place \u2014 a cheeky joke they think the real monarch will appreciate.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8397d33b00002b88d7684d.png?cache=igdnbjcvv6&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
