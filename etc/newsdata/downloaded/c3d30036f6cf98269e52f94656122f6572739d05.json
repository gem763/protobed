The law, however, did not prohibit acts of violence toward animals itself.\n\nIntroduced by Reps. Ted Deutch (D-Fla.) and Vern Buchanan (R-Fla.) in the House, the law would make it a federal crime for \"any person to intentionally engage\" in animal cruelty, including burning, drowning, suffocating, impaling or otherwise injuring \"non-mammals, birds, reptiles or amphibians,\" per a fact sheet provided by Rep. Deutch's office.\n\nThe law wouldn't interfere with local legislation against animal cruelty.\n\n'An issue of right and wrong': Dead dog found in NJ town has drawn outrage, calls for change. But will it happen?\n\nSenators Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Richard Durbin (D-Ill.) introduced the Senate companion of the bill in February.\n\n\"This bill sends a clear message that our society does not accept cruelty against animals,\" Deutch said in a statement. \"We\u2019ve received support from so many Americans from across the country and across the political spectrum. Animal rights activists have stood up for living things that do not have a voice.\"\n\nAnimal rights groups such as the ASPCA praised the passage of the act.\n\n\"With the House passage of the PACT Act, we are one step closer to a federal law protecting animals from one of the most brutal acts of cruelty, and we thank Representatives Ted Deutch and Vern Buchanan for introducing this bill as well as their continued leadership on animal protection,\" said Richard Patch, ASPCA's vice president of federal affairs, in a statement to USA TODAY.\n\nFollow Joshua Bote on Twitter: @joshua_bote\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/23/house-passes-bipartisan-bill-make-animal-cruelty-federal-crime/4076657002/", "description": "\"This bill sends a clear message that our society does not accept cruelty against animals,\" Rep.
