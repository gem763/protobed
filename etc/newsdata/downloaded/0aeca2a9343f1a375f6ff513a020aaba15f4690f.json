How the world has changed since then.\n\nThis week has seen a full ceremonial 21-gun salute for President Vladimir Putin in the capital, an audience with the king and crown prince, a host of bilateral deals and a seismic strategic recalculation in the region as Saudi Arabia's US allies effectively abandon the Kurds to their fate in northern Syria.\n\nSo how close is Saudi Arabia now drawing to Russia and why?\n\nWhat's happened?\n\nPresident Putin has made a rare but much-publicised visit to Saudi Arabia - his first in 12 years - accompanied by a sizable delegation of trade, security and defence officials. Bilateral deals worth more than $2bn (\u00a31.6bn) and more than 20 agreements have been announced.\n\nThe Saudis have also invited Russia to participate in the ongoing international investigation into the 14 September drone and missile attacks on Saudi oil facilities.\n\nDefence discussions have included the possible purchase and future deployment of Russia's formidable S-400 air defence missile system, which would be something of a diplomatic blow to Washington.\n\nThe US recently cancelled Turkey's participation in its F35 fighter programme after Turkey went ahead with buying the S-400 from Russia.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption A demonstration of the S-400 missile system\n\nBilateral trade deals between Riyadh and Moscow have been accelerating since a June 2018 agreement and recent co-operation to restrain global oil supplies to keep prices buoyant.\n\nAnnouncements by RDIF, Russia's Direct Investment Fund, to coincide with President Putin's visit include:\n\nA deal with Saudi state oil company Saudi Aramco to acquire a 30% Saudi share in Novomet, a Russian oil equipment supplier\n\nA $600m deal for Saudi Arabia to invest in Russian aircraft leasing business\n\nPossible co-operation between Russia's Gazprom and Saudi firms on natural gas.\n\nAll of this signals a significant warming of ties between the Saudis and a country whose enemies (the Afghan mujahideen) they once bankrolled in the 1980s.\n\nWhy are ties growing?\n\nPut bluntly, the Saudis no longer trust the US and the West as much as they used to. That doesn't mean they necessarily trust Moscow either, but recent events in the Middle East have triggered a major rethink in Saudi court circles.\n\nThe first big shock came with the Arab Spring protests of 2011. The Saudis - and other Gulf Arab monarchies - were appalled at the speed with which the West dumped its long-time ally, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt.\n\nBy contrast, they couldn't help noticing that Moscow stood by its beleaguered Middle East partner, Syria's President Bashar Al-Assad.\n\nImage copyright AFP/Getty Image caption Bashar al-Assad has relied on Russian support during the Syrian civil war\n\nThe next shock came with President Barack Obama's support for the Iran nuclear deal in 2015, which left the Saudis feeling deeply uncomfortable. They suspected, rightly, that the Obama White House was losing interest in the region.\n\nWhen the newly elected President Donald Trump chose Riyadh for his first overseas presidential visit in 2017 the Saudis were ecstatic. Relations with Washington appeared back on track and billions of dollars' worth of deals were announced.\n\nBut then came the murder by Saudi government agents of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in October 2018 which resulted in massive condemnation in the world's free press.\n\nSuspicious of his involvement, Western leaders started to give Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman a wide berth, at least in public. At the G20 summit in Buenos Aires the following month he was largely shunned.\n\nBy contrast, President Putin high-fived him.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Mohammed bin Salman is asked: \"Did you order the murder of Jamal Khashoggi?\"\n\nAlthough President Trump has lobbied in favour of good relations with the Saudi leadership, Saudi officials are still dismayed by his unpredictable and quixotic approach to the region.\n\nThis week the Saudi Ambassador to UK, Prince Khalid Bin Bandar, described the Turkish incursion into northern Syria (triggered by Trump's decision to withdraw US troops there) as a \"disaster\". When asked about warming relations with Moscow, the ambassador replied that \"Russia often understands the East better than the West does\".\n\nEight years on from the outbreak of the Syrian civil war and Russia has successfully helped save Assad's regime, showcasing its latest military hardware while simultaneously establishing a strategic foothold in the region.\n\nAmerica under President Trump, meanwhile, appears to be heading for the exit, despite rushing extra troops to shore up Saudi Arabia's air defences after the equipment it had sold the Saudis failed to prevent the catastrophic attack on 14 September.\n\nBottom line: the Saudis and their Gulf Arab allies are looking to diversify their partnerships away from a heavy dependence on the West.\n\nThis is to hedge against any future upsets, be they incoming missile attacks they blame on Iran (which could in future risk killing Russian technicians) or diplomatic upsets like the Khashoggi incident.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAll of this needs to be seen in perspective.\n\nSaudi Arabia's prime security partner has been, and continues to be, the United States. This dates back to 1945 when President Roosevelt met Saudi King Abdulaziz onboard a US warship.\n\nOver the ensuing years the Saudis guaranteed to keep the oil flowing, America promised them a security umbrella. That pact, while somewhat frayed at the edges, remains.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption 'Saudi Arabia is an ally and a tremendous purchaser'\n\nThe US military has substantial bases in all six Gulf Arab countries. The nuclear-capable US Navy's 5th Fleet, headquartered in Bahrain, remains the most potent navy in the region. When Mr Trump came to Riyadh, more than $300bn worth of deals were announced; when Putin came this week, it was $2bn.\n\nBut there is no question that the tectonic plates of alliances in the Middle East are shifting and diversifying. Expect to see more visits by Russian and Chinese delegates to Riyadh.\n\nAmerica still has a prime seat at the Saudi table, but there are rather more guests sitting round it now.", "description": "Saudi Arabia rolls out the red carpet for Vladimir Putin, signalling a seismic shift in relations.", "authors": ["Frank Gardner", "Bbc Security Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5E46/production/_109243142_mediaitem109243141.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
