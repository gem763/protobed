September also marked the last month of the third quarter, when home prices rose by 0.3%, the slowest growth since 2013, according to Nationwide, the longest-running index in the U.K.\n\n\n\nMore: \u2018Mansion Tax\u2019 Takes Its Toll on Manhattan Sales\n\n\u201cIndicators of U.K. economic activity have been fairly volatile in recent quarters, but the underlying pace of growth appears to have slowed as a result of weaker global growth and an intensification of Brexit uncertainty,\u201d wrote Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, in the report.\n\n\n\nHomeowners in the British capital and its outer commuter ring have suffered the most from the ongoing downturn. In London, home values fell 1.7% in the third quarter compared to a year ago, while the outer metro area saw prices decline 1.5% during the same period, according to Halifax\u2019s seasonally adjusted figures.\n\n\n\nThis is the ninth month in a row that London home prices declined year-over-year, though they are still only 5% below their all-time high in Q1 2017, according to the index. The average home price in London is also still 50% higher than it was in 2007.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: Worldwise: Real Estate Exec and Arts Patron Jessica Goldman Srebnick\u2019s Favorite Things\n\nIf there\u2019s any bright spot for the market, it\u2019s that recent mortgage approval data shows that total home sales across the country have remained broadly stable, Mr. Gardner wrote.\n\n\n\n\u201cHealthy labor market conditions and low borrowing costs appear to be offsetting the drag from the uncertain economic outlook,\u201d he added.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Beckie Strum"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-113065?size=1.5005861664712778&width=1280"}
