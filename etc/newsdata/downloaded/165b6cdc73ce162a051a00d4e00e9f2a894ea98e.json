He also said Facebook and its subsidiary platforms do not operate in China in large part because of the government\u2019s speech policies. (The Logic)\n\nTalking point: Zuckerberg has called for a \u201cmore standardized approach\u201d to the removal of harmful content that would apply across countries and platforms. Thursday\u2019s speech combined all the responses Zuckerberg and Facebook have recently given to criticism of its moderation practices: calling for regulation based on existing rules like the U.S.\u2019s free speech practices or the European data protection regime; arguing that decisions on what content should be taken down are very complicated; and contrasting its behaviours with those of other platforms. It also comes amid partisan battles in the U.S. over Facebook\u2019s role in moderating political speech. Zuckerberg has recently hosted a series of private dinners with conservative commentators and policymakers to discuss their claims of bias. He has also defended a policy allowing political ads from President Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign containing falsehoods.", "description": "", "authors": ["Murad Hemmadi"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
