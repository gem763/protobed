That's an interesting thing to digest and for markets to deal with is that the Fed will be adding to its balance sheet but it\u2019s not the same as Q/E. That was something that became a little bit of a possibility over the past 48 hours and now that he's said it explicitly we can start thinking about it. That should bring a little bit more comfort to markets. That'll take a little more time to sink in, what that means for investors\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRICK MECKLER, PARTNER, CHERRY LANE INVESTMENTS, NEW VERNON, NEW JERSEY\n\n\"This type of reaction we see almost every time from the Fed decisions. The first move is from the people who think it's not enough, and at the end of the day people conclude that they did exactly what investors expected them to do. Those people who got what they expected used the selloff to buy, and I think that's what happened here.\"\n\n\"Nothing really changed from yesterday to today and the move was pretty well telegraphed.\"\n\n\"The bottom line is (Powell) didn't say anything that negative. You think about what he presented, it's status quo. People thought about it, they thought about the fact that rates are going lower, that normally is supportive for stocks.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSEEMA SHAH, CHIEF STRATEGIST, PRINCIPAL GLOBAL INVESTORS, LONDON (EMAILED)\n\n\u201cPowell had a tougher task on his hands today than usual. With market participants concerned about the liquidity shortage that has hit recently, Powell had to provide some reassurance that the Fed is on top of it. Certainly, the Fed has the tools to deal with this issue, and it does not reflect an underlying weakness in the economy nor is it a systemic issue. However, questions may arise about why the Fed has delivered such a large reduction in the IOER \u2013 does it imply the stress on the monetary transmission mechanism is actually higher than most believe?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s more, an IOER cut is simply a temporary bandaid for the solution and the Fed will need to come up with a more permanent solution going forward. Expanding the Fed balance sheet features in the menu of possible solutions, and Powell made a strong effort to communicate clearly that it should not be interpreted as quantitative easing, aka policy stimulus, rather than a technical tool to increase to currency in circulation.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nJASON PRIDE, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, PRIVATE WEALTH, GLENMEDE, PHILADELPHIA\n\n\u201cThe dot plot is probably what caused some concerns in the initial impression. The median dots show two rate cuts in 2019, which implies that the Fed is done. That\u2019s the median dot. But the dispersion of members has increased. Some may be more conservative in a survey because they don\u2019t necessary want to show that they\u2019re committing to all the rate cuts in case the signal from economic information doesn\u2019t turn out (as expected). I\u2019d caution anyone from reading too much into the dot plot.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMARK GRANT, MANAGING DIRECTOR AND CHIEF GLOBAL STRATEGIST, B.
