Later, she inspected it closely and found holes in the trunk (right)\n\nNow experts have warned the tree has been poisoned and there is a \u2018very high chance\u2019 it will die.\n\nYesterday the 51-year-old said she had reported the attacks to police, blaming a disgruntled neighbour.\n\n\u2018This behaviour is totally unwarranted and unnecessary,\u2019 she said. \u2018To think that someone is creeping into my garden either when I\u2019m not at home or at night to carry out this kind of malicious behaviour is devastating. I now lay in bed wondering if someone is out there.\u2019\n\nMrs Sarchet, a receptionist, has lived in her \u00a3200,000 detached house in the village of Worsthorne-with-Hurstwood, near Burnley, for nine years.\n\nArborists now say there is a very high chance the tree, which is the subject of a Tree Preservation Order from Burnley Council, will die\n\nStanding in a conservation area, the property was built in the former orchard of a farmhouse dating back to the 1500s.\n\nSeveral trees in its garden are centuries old and, like the sycamore, are subject to tree preservation orders.Anyone who breaches one can be fined up to \u00a320,000.\n\nMrs Sarchet said problems began when a family bought a nearby house. \u2018Some neighbours said they didn\u2019t like the tree because it blocked sunlight from their house. They should have considered all this before they bought the house,\u2019 she said, adding that she was \u201899 per cent sure\u2019 who did it.\n\nHer elderly father has now erected a 12ft high fence to prevent access.\n\nIt is thought a trespasser is sneaking into her property at night and injecting poison into the holes\n\nShe is being supported by Burnley councillor Gordon Birtwistle. He said: \u2018I was absolutely outraged. This is disgusting behaviour.\u2019\n\nIt is thought a trespasser is sneaking into her property at night and injecting poison into the holes.\n\nArborists now say there is a very high chance the tree, which is the subject of a Tree Preservation Order from Burnley Council, will die.\n\nMother-of-two Mrs Sarchet says the tree blocks some neighbour's sunlight and that the poisoning could have been carried out by someone who wants the tree removed.\n\nThe receptionist, who has reported the situation to police, said: 'This behaviour is totally unwarranted and unnecessary.\n\n'This is one of the oldest and most important trees in Burnley and has been here a lot longer than the person responsible for this. The whole situation has left me extremely distressed.\n\n'To think that someone is creeping into my garden either when I'm not at home or at night to carry out this kind of malicious behaviour is devastating.'\n\nMrs Sarchet had made her feel constantly stressed.\n\nMrs Sarchet has now spent over \u00a3500 on a fence (pictured) around the back of her garden to deter the vandals\n\n'I now lay in bed wondering if someone is out there,' she said. 'I'm on edge when it's dark and I need to let the dog out into the garden.\n\n'My daughter has been scared to sleep in her bedroom, thinking someone could be just outside her window.'\n\nMrs Sarchet and her family have vowed to find the culprit and press charges against them.\n\nAnyone who wilfully destroys or damages a tree that is subject to a Tree Preservation Order can be taken to court and fined up to \u00a320,000.\n\nIn serious cases, a trial can go to crown court and, if convicted, the offender is liable to an unlimited fine.\n\nMrs Sarchet and her family have vowed to find the culprit and press charges against them\n\nMrs Sarchet is being supported by Burnley councillor and former Liberal Democrat MP Gordon Birtwistle.\n\nHe said: 'I was absolutely outraged when I heard about what had been going on.\n\n'Jill then invited me over to see for myself and I counted 52 five-inch holes had been drilled into the base of the tree.\n\n'This is disgusting behaviour, and I am currently liaising with the council to establish what the next form of action should be.\n\n'It is beyond belief that whoever is responsible for this hasn't considered the environmental implications killing this tree will have.\n\n'Killing this tree could be equated to killing the future for your children - it takes tons of carbon out of the atmosphere.\n\n'What would happen if someone went around doing this to every tree they come across? We'd be left in a very bad position.'\n\nMrs Sarchet has now spent over \u00a3500 on a fence around the back of her garden to deter the vandals.\n\nShe said: 'My elderly father and my son have spent the last few weekends putting the fence up.\n\n'This should not only offer us some more security but may also help any further damage to the tree, which could already be irreparable.'\n\nTree expert Greg Thompson travelled to Burnley from Cumbria after he was contacted by Mrs Sarchet to undertake an assessment.\n\nHe said: 'The damage will lead to extensive pruning at the very least to remove dead limbs and reduce any healthy limbs due to new exposure to wind loading.\n\n'There is a very high chance the tree will need to be removed depending on an arboriculturalist's report.\n\n'The tree may die completely in the next few months.'\n\nPolice have so far been unavailable to comment.", "description": "When\u00a0the majestic 100ft sycamore in her garden started turning brown, Jill Sarchet, who lives in the village of Worsthorne-with-Hurstwood, near Burnley, immediately became suspicious.", "authors": ["James Tozer For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/07/28/12/16593560-0-image-a-45_1564313691172.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-28"}
