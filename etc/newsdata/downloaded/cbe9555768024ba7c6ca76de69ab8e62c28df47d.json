Every now and then I\u2019ll have an article in the Washington Post or appear on MSNBC, and I\u2019ll get 11,000 emails and rage-monkey tweets demanding: \u201cWhy would you want to work with those people? Huh? They aren\u2019t your friends!\u201d I don\u2019t know, Bubba, because a lot of people read the Washington Post who don\u2019t read National Review, and they ain\u2019t ever going to hear it if we don\u2019t bring it to them? And maybe the folks at the Washington Post aren\u2019t my people, but then neither is y\u2019all, Bubba.\n\nBut we\u2019re all in this together.\n\n(For our sins, Bubba.)\n\n\u201cWe are not enemies, but friends,\u201d Abraham Lincoln said in his first inaugural address. It would be more difficult to say a few years later, when Americans had become one another\u2019s enemies on the battlefields of the Civil War. We throw around the word \u201ctreason\u201d irresponsibly in our time. But when Robert E. Lee and his Army of Northern Virginia were forced to surrender at Appomattox Court House, they had been engaged in genuine treason\u2014\u201ctreason against the United States shall consist only in levying war against them\u201d\u2014on a massive scale. But Lincoln\u2019s better angels carried the day. Lee and his men were given the most generous terms imaginable. Ulysses. S. Grant, saddened and embarrassed by the occasion, spent the first part of the meeting reminiscing with Lee about their service together in the Mexican War. The rebels were not even humiliated, when justice would have countenanced hanging them. And then in one of this nation\u2019s great moments of republican virtue, Grant had his men salute Lee and his ragged, defeated rebels as they turned to ride home, in safety and with dignity.", "description": "", "authors": ["Kevin Williamson", "Nationalreview.Com Not-Enemies-But-Friends"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
