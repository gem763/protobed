But it had applied only in Europe.\n\nIn 2015, France's data-protection agency CNIL ordered Google to remove global search listings of pages containing damaging or false information about a person. Google resisted, and the two parties have been wrapped up in a messy battle ever since.\n\nRead more: Google is fighting a big, messy battle over whether expanding the 'right to be forgotten' amounts to censorship\n\nWhile supporters of privacy rights say the right to be forgotten is an important tool to protect people online, Google argued that expanding this globally would impinge on freedom of speech.\n\nOn Tuesday, the European Court of Justice sided with Google. \"There is no obligation under EU law, for a search engine operator who grants a request for de-referencing made by a data subject, as the case may be, following an injunction from a supervisory or judicial authority of a Member State, to carry out such a de-referencing on all the versions of its search engine,\" it said in a press release on Tuesday.\n\nPeter Fleischer, the senior privacy counsel at Google, said: \"Since 2014, we've worked hard to implement the right to be forgotten in Europe, and to strike a sensible balance between people's rights of access to information and privacy.\n\n\"It's good to see that the court agreed with our arguments, and we're grateful to the independent human-rights organizations, media associations, and many others around the world who also presented their views to the court.\"\n\nActivists heralded the ruling as a victory for free speech.\n\nThomas Hughes, the executive director for the campaign group Article 19, said in a statement: \"This ruling is a victory for global freedom of expression. Courts or data regulators in the UK, France, or Germany should not be able to determine the search results that internet users in America, India, or Argentina get to see.\n\n\"The court is right to state that the balance between privacy and free speech should be taken into account when deciding if websites should be de-listed \u2014 and also to recognize that this balance may vary around the world. It is not right that one country's data-protection authorities can impose their interpretation on internet users around the world.\"", "description": "Europe's top court ruled on Tuesday that Google did not have to apply the 'right to be forgotten' policy globally.", "authors": ["Mary Hanbury"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5cd2ddd0021b4c09ea4e02f5?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
