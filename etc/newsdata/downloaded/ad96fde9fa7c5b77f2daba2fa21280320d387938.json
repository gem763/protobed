REUTERS/Stefan Wermuth\n\nThe Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said its headline price balance for August rose to -4 from -9 in July, bucking economists\u2019 average expectation in a Reuters poll for a further decline to -11.\n\nBut RICS members\u2019 outlook for the next three months - during which period Britain is scheduled to leave the European Union - grew darker.\n\nSales volumes expectations for the next three months dropped to -23 from -4, while short-term expectations for prices declined to -24 from -13.\n\n\u201cIt is hard to get away from the shadow being cast over the housing market by the seemingly never-ending Brexit saga. Indeed uncertainty is a theme that respondents continue to highlight as a negative influence on sentiment in survey after survey,\u201d RICS chief economist Simon Rubinsohn said.\n\nAlthough Prime Minister Boris Johnson has vowed to take Britain out of the EU by Oct. 31 - without a transition deal if needed - parliament has ordered him to ask the EU for a delay if he fails to negotiate a new agreement with the bloc.\n\nBritain\u2019s housing market has slowed since June 2016\u2019s referendum decision to leave the EU, though outright price falls have been concentrated in London and nearby areas - a pattern that persisted in August\u2019s RICS data.\n\nHigher purchase taxes on housing costing more than 1 million pounds ($1.23 million), as well as concern about the effect of Brexit on London\u2019s financial services industry, have weighed on prices in the British capital.\n\nRICS also noted continued strong demand from tenants at the national level, combined with fewer landlords listing property to rent.\n\n\u201cThe pressure is for rents to continue moving higher and indeed outstripping any price gains both in the near and medium term,\u201d Rubinsohn said.", "description": "Brexit uncertainty is likely to press down on house prices and the volume of property sales over the next three months, a closely watched industry survey showed on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1428952104&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A1XY", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
