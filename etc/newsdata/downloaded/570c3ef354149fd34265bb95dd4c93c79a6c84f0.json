Intel Corp, Nvidia Corp, Western Digital and Seagate Technology fell between 1.7% and 4%, while Ambarella Inc slumped 9%.\n\nThe Philadelphia Semiconductor index declined 2.6%, while technology stocks dropped 1.2%.\n\nWeighing on the Dow Jones Industrial Average was a 1.6% fall in shares of Boeing Co.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported friction between the United States and Europe could further delay efforts to resume flights of the planemaker's best-selling 737 MAX jets, which have been grounded since early 2019. Boeing said it delivered half the number of planes in the first nine months of 2019 than it did in the same period a year earlier.\n\nAt 11:27 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 283.29 points, or 1.07%, at 26,194.73, while the S&P 500 was down 35.46 points, or 1.21%, at 2,903.33. The Nasdaq Composite was down 94.03 points, or 1.18%, at 7,862.27. The S&P 500 and Dow indexes fell below their 100-day moving average.\n\nDespite the steep declines, the indexes were trading above last week's lows, when a contraction in U.S. manufacturing and a dismal reading on business activity sparked fears of a looming recession in the world's biggest economy.\n\nWhile moderate jobs growth in September lifted sentiment on Friday, traders still see an 84% chance of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates by a quarter percentage point in October, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.\n\nThose bets were bolstered on Tuesday by data that showed U.S. producer prices unexpectedly fell in September.\n\nMarket participants will now focus on third-quarter earnings season beginning next week and analysts expect the worst quarterly profit performance since 2016, with earnings from S&P 500 companies declining nearly 3% from a year earlier, based on IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nU.S.-listed Chinese stocks declined, with Alibaba Group Holding, JD.com Inc and Baidu Inc falling between 1.5% and 3%.\n\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers for a 3.59-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 3.63-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\n\nThe S&P index recorded two new 52-week highs and 15 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded eight new highs and 101 new lows.
