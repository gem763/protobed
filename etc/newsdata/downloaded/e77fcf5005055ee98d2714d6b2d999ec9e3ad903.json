(Andy Marlin-USA TODAY Sports)\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 New York Yankees reliever Dellin Betances deserves much better than this. But unfortunately, his 2019 season will consist of only eight pitches.\n\nBetances suffered a season-ending partial tear of his left Achilles tendon while making his 2019 debut on Sunday in Toronto, the Yankees announced following Tuesday\u2019s 8-0 victory over the Los Angeles Angels at Yankee Stadium.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nSurgery is not being recommended at this point, but cannot be ruled out, according to the team. Betances saw Dr. Justin Greisberg at New York Presbyterian Hospital, and will get a second opinion from Dr. Martin O\u2019Malley at the Hospital for Special Surgery at a later date to be determined.\n\nThe 31-year-old veteran, who had sidelined due to a right shoulder impingement and a lat strain, suffered the injury while jumping off the mound when he mistakenly thought he\u2019d recorded the third out of the inning. Betances ended up striking out the only two batters he faced before departing as planned.\n\n\u201cObviously heartbroken for Dellin,\u201d Yankees manager Aaron Boone said.\n\nBoone said Betances came down a little awkwardly on his jump, but didn\u2019t think anything of it at the time. He told the team of his discomfort on Tuesday, and tests revealed the partial tear.\n\n\u201cIt made me nauseous when I was thinking about it,\u201d Yankees reliever Zack Britton said.\n\nBritton suffered a ruptured Achilles and December 2017 and required six months of rehab before making his 2018 season debut on June 12.\n\nStory continues\n\nBetances is set to be a free agent at season\u2019s end, and will likely need to take a short-term, prove-it contract as a result of all his unfortunate injuries. From 2014-18, he compiled a 2.22 ERA and struck out 607 in 373.1 innings, making four All-Star teams over that five-year span. Betances \u2014 who is making $7.1 million in 2019 \u2014 has earned $16.7 million over his career.\n\nThe Yankees (99-53) have been able to thrive in Betances\u2019 absence all season, though, their success is in large part due to a deep, power bullpen that features Aroldis Chapman, Britton, Adam Ottavino, Tommy Kahnle and Chad Green.\n\nThe Yankees came into Tuesday with a record-setting 30 players hitting the injured list in 38 different stints (now, make it 39). Starter Luis Severino (shoulder, lat) did make his season debut on Tuesday, throwing four scoreless innings. Outfielder Giancarlo Stanton, who has played in just nine games due to myriad injuries, is set to be activated either Wednesday or Thursday.\n\nYankees are hopeful they can get catcher Gary Sanchez (groin) and first baseman/designated hitter Edwin Encarnacion (oblique) back before the playoffs.\n\nStill, it\u2019s an awful blow for Betances, who has been a class act and beloved teammate while wearing pinstripes.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\n\n", "description": "Dellin Betances had only made one appearance this season for the Yankees.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/lCKJjkfysgknUpvZQOpzqg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/o5627x3GVJMBPBG.KfsrpQ--~B/aD0zNDU2O3c9NTE4NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/12eb19e0-d9bb-11e9-acbf-4b33cb5a28b6", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
