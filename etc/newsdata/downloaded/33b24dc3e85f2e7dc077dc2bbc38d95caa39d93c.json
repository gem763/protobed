Suddenly, rugby wasn\u2019t the topic anymore.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Rugby World Cup team of round three Show all 16 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

James Slipper (Australia) Ninety-three Tests had come and gone for the Wallabies loosehead, but it was 94th-time lucky for the Queensland-born prop as he finally scored his first international try in Australia\u2019s 45-10 victory over Uruguay. Getty Images 3/16 2. Mbongeni Mbonambi (South Africa) Mbonambi was excellent at the lineout, finding his jumper on every occasion, but it was his work around the pitch that really stood out in the win over Italy as he bagged himself a try in the process. PA 4/16 3. Angus Ta\u2019avao (New Zealand) The rookie All Blacks prop was thrust into the contest against Namibia early when his team were struggling to break down the African side following Nepo Laulala\u2019s yellow card, but not only did he settle straight into the match, he immediately bagged himself a try that convinced Steve Hansen to leave him on for the rest of the match. Getty Images 5/16 4. Wimpie van der Walt (Japan) The uniquely-named lock led Japan\u2019s defensive charge against Samoa and was dominant in the aerial battle with a 100 per cent lineout effort alongside James Moore, which was made all the more impressive as he didn\u2019t start either of their opening matches. AFP via Getty Images 6/16 5. Sam Whitelock (New Zealand) Captained New Zealand in the absence of Kieran Read and led by example. Whitelock bagged a try himself, didn\u2019t panic when New Zealand were clawed back in the first half and contributed well with the ball in hand. His aggression in kicking for the corner early on paid off with a 71-point return. EPA 7/16 6. Rhys Ruddock (Ireland) Ireland may have been criticised for a drab performance in their victory over Russia, but Ruddock proved the silver lining with a man-of-the-match display that could thrust him into the side for the big contests.

Sam Underhill (England) Another flanker named man of the match, Underhill was England\u2019s defensive heartbeat against Argentina, but also an emphatic carrier who helped set up George Ford\u2019s bonus point-clinching try. PA 9/16 8. Kazuki Himeno (Japan) The Japanese No 8 was one of their top performers against Samoa, carrying well and showing a deft touch with his ability to offload from the tackle. Earmarked as a real star of Japanese rugby, he looks to have real captaincy potential. AFP via Getty Images 10/16 9. Frank Lomani (Fiji) A livewire showing as the beating heart of a Flying Fijian side back at full strength and firing on all cylinders. Scored a try himself and delivered the quick ball that the Pacific Islanders crave to play their unique brand of rugby. AP 11/16 10. Jordie Barrett (New Zealand) Stepped out of the shadow of older brother Beauden to play a starring role in the demolition of Namibia. Scored a try himself but it was the in which he created Anton Lienert-Brown\u2019s score that really stood out, combining power, vision, passing ability and athletic determination to send the centre over. Getty Images 12/16 11. Semi Radradra (Fiji) The star of the side this week. When Radradra is playing his best rugby he is simply unstoppable, and so he proved last week. The Bordeaux back scored twice against Georgia and led pretty much every attacking stats list as the European side failed to shackle is delightful talent. AP 13/16 12. Anton Lienert-Brown (New Zealand) His form is keeping Sonny Bill Williams out of the Test side when New Zealand play their crunch fixtures, but on the weekend\u2019s evidence it was easy to see why. Two tries, the first an eye-catching mazy run from halfway, secures him the No 12 shirt this week, and probably for the All Blacks in the quarter-finals. Getty Images 14/16 13. Timothy Lafaele (Japan) Kicked off the performance against Samoa with their first try, starring with teammate Kotaro Matsushima to tear the Pacific Islanders apart early on and pave the way to their bonus-point victory. AFP via Getty Images 15/16 14. Cheslin Kolbe (South Africa) How do you stop him? The answer is yet to be found, with Kolbe\u2019s low centre of gravity, stunning footwork and Habana-like pace leaving team after team in knots \u2013 this time Italy \u2013 with two tries to kick-start his tally at this World Cup. AFP via Getty Images 16/16 15. Elliot Daly (England) Possibly his best performance for England in the No 15 shirt to date, Daly linked up superbly with Jonny May \u2013 who is hard done by not to make the side this week \u2013 and Anthony Watson in what was a scintillating first half for the English back three.

Getty Images\n\nFor Vunipola, whose family had only just arrived in Japan, the reassurance came in that the fatalities were extraordinarily low for a storm of this ferocity.\n\n\u201cJapan are pretty used to typhoons and they have regulations to deal with it, so it\u2019s just a case of my family doing as they\u2019re told and us hoping and praying that they\u2019re safe. We are very lucky to be here and I just hope everyone is safe,\u201d Vunipola added.\n\n\u201cMy partner came over but went back before the game. My dad has just arrived and my aunties and cousins also came. My auntie has been here for the whole time. My dad only came over for the France game, but I think he will stay for the quarter-final.\n\n\u201cThey are still in Tokyo. I am pretty sure Japan can deal with it. It is just trying to make sure they are safe and follow what they are told. We\u2019re just talking to them as much as we can. We have only just finished training so I have only just found out that the typhoon has hit quite big, so I will talk to them after this and see how they are.\n\n\u201cIt is worrying, but we\u2019re lucky \u2013 we\u2019re pretty sheltered from a lot of that. I didn\u2019t realise how big or how bad the typhoon was going to be until we got told the news. It shows how much we\u2019ve been focusing on the job in hand. Now I just hope the damage isn\u2019t too much and people are okay.\u201d\n\nThe loosehead prop speaks openly and honestly about what is transpiring in Japan. Perhaps there is not a better member of this current England squad to demonstrate why, at the end of the day, rugby no longer matters. Not today, not this weekend and possibly not for the days ahead.\n\nWith family in the firing line as Hagibis pounded the Kanto area, Vunipola openly discussed his genuine concerns. There was no talk about quarter-final opponents, or how training to be the best version of himself, but only a natural concern that the rest of the country carried. Vunipola may have been safe with the rest of us in Miyazaki, but the thoughts were very much with those friends and family in Tokyo.\n\n\u201cObviously you\u2019re focused on rugby but you know it\u2019s not the be-all and end-all, especially when you see things like this,\u201d said Vunipola. \u201cYou worry for people\u2019s safety in typhoons and you hope nothing serious does happen. But unfortunately there\u2019s already been a death.\n\n\u201cYou just pray and hope that it doesn\u2019t happen too much. In terms of rugby, you want to focus on that as much as you can, but you realise at the end of the day it\u2019s all about safety which is probably why they\u2019ve made that call and we\u2019re not playing today.\u201d\n\nThe brutality for Vunipola is that all of this coincides when he had enough on his plate to worry about. The Saracens prop has only just returned from hamstring surgery, which led to a setback when he damaged the scar tissue left by the operation, and what should have been his most important run-out yet to prove he has a future at this World Cup was called off just when he found himself raring to go. As possibly the most nonchalant member of the England squad, that says a lot.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been chaos, in terms of logistics. You are always disappointed [to miss a game],\u201d Vunipola said. \u201cMyself, I wanted to play as much as I can, to get a bit more game-time under my belt. But you can\u2019t control these things and it\u2019s pretty serious. We as players don\u2019t make those calls, so we\u2019ve just got to deal with it.\u2019\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d had a tough day in training on Wednesday so personally, I was a bit gutted because I\u2019d worked hard. You want to play for your country as much as you can, but this has happened and we\u2019re here now. We\u2019ve had two good days of training and we move on.\u201d\n\nThe toll of Saturday\u2019s training session in Miyazaki \u2013 held in front of the public in an open session \u2013 was there for all to see afterwards. \u201cYou should have seen myself out there today \u2013 I was sucking in seagulls!\u201d he added.\n\nThe question is, once the debris is cleared and the country returns to normal, how does the show go on. It starts with a team selection, and Vunipola will have his eyes on it. \u201cThey definitely push you in training so if I am involved next week, I know they will be ready for me to play.\u201d", "description": "On Thursday, it was a rugby story. 48 hours later, it was a humanitarian story, and not one with a good ending.
