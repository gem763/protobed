They need people to be dependent on big government because if you\u2019re not, they really don\u2019t offer anything. We saw nothing new last night. We saw no plans and that\u2019s scary for them.\"\n\nBETO'S AR-15 FLIP-FLOP: O'ROURKE ONCE VOWED 'NOBODY' WANTS TO SEIZE GUNS\n\nTrump Jr. went on to say that the media fails to hold Democrats \"in check\" or make them explain their \"radical\" ideas.\n\n2020 DEMOCRATS RAMP UP CALLS FOR MANDATORY ASSAULT WEAPONS BUYBACK\n\n\"There\u2019s no one in media who will actually hold them in check,\" he asserted. \"There\u2019s no accountability. That\u2019s why you can have these radical ideas and if you contest them, you\u2019re [called] a racist.\"\n\nOverall, Trump Jr. discounted the idea that any of the 10 Democrats on the stage can beat his father in 2020. He said the media routinely fails to call out former Vice President Joe Biden for his \"daily gaffes.\"\n\n\u201cHis campaign won\u2019t let him be on a campaign stump without a teleprompter anymore,\" he said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTrump Jr. was asked by host Ainsley Earhardt whether Biden would be tougher to beat than a candidate further to the left.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re both relatively easy to beat,\" he said. \"I think it\u2019s just different tactics. The reality is I don\u2019t think anyone has had some sort of breakout performance. I think probably the person who\u2019s actually been least impressive throughout the process that I thought would have been a much more formidable is [Sen. Kamala Harris of California]. She\u2019s just not genuine at all. The sound bites don\u2019t really work. She\u2019s the only one laughing at her jokes.\"", "description": "The latest Democratic presidential debate was a \"socialism free-for-all\" that offered no new ideas to the American people, Donald Trump Jr. said Friday on \"Fox & Friends.\"", "authors": ["David Montanaro", "David Montanaro Is A Senior Editor With Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/trumpjr.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
