They believe that his frustration is compounded by stress about the 2020 election and the economy's recent downturn.\n\n\"People are used to the president saying things that aren't true, but this Alabama stuff is another story,\" the former official said. \"This was the president sending out patently false information about a national-emergency situation as it was unfolding.\"\n\nRead more: Trump may have committed tax fraud by fabricating a loan to avoid paying income taxes on nearly $50 million\n\nTrump's latest outbursts on the matter came Friday as he railed against the media for fact-checking him on the claim.\n\nTrump also complained that \"this nonsense has never happened to another President. Four days of corrupt reporting, still without an apology.\"\n\nLater Friday, the president posted a misleading video that included a CNN clip from Wednesday, August 28, in which a reporter said the hurricane was threatening several US states, including Alabama.\n\nThe video then played the reporter saying \"Alabama\" on loop, cut to a clip of Trump nodding, and then to a doctored clip of CNN's logo superimposed onto a moving truck which careened off the road and caught fire.\n\nBut Trump's first tweet about Alabama being in Hurricane Dorian's path came on Saturday, by which time weather forecasters had determined that it was not going to be hit.\n\n'He's deteriorating in plain sight'\n\nAs of Friday evening, Trump had posted 15 tweets and five maps about Alabama and the storm to try to prove his original tweet was correct, despite the fact that he'd been publicly rebuked by the National Weather Service. He also showed reporters an altered map of the storm's path on Wednesday to defend his claims, a move that may be illegal, according to federal law.\n\n\"He's deteriorating in plain sight,\" one Republican strategist who's in frequent contact with the White House told Insider on Friday.\n\nAsked why the president was obsessed with Alabama instead of the states that would actually be affected by the storm, the strategist said, \"you should ask a psychiatrist about that; I'm not sure I'm qualified to comment.\"\n\nRead more: Trump may have broken federal law by altering Hurricane Dorian's path on a map to validate his false claim that it could hit Alabama\n\nTrump often airs his grievances publicly, either on Twitter or while speaking with reporters, which means the world has an unprecedented window into the president's stream of consciousness.\n\nFor instance, on Labor Day weekend, as Hurricane Dorian battered the Bahamas and made its way to the US's mainland, Trump took breaks in between golfing to post more than 120 tweets.\n\nIn addition to updates on Hurricane Dorian and quote tweets of fawning praise of his presidency from Fox News, the subjects of Trump's tweets included:\n\nFormer FBI Director James Comey.\n\nFour freshman Democratic congresswomen of color known as \"the squad.\"\n\nAFL-CIO President Richard Trumka.\n\n\"Failing New York Times columnist Paul Krugman.\"\n\n\"Amazon Washington Post.\"\n\nThe \"LameStream Media.\"\n\nThe liberal actress and activist Debra Messing.\n\nRead more: Trump advisers are more worried about Elizabeth Warren than any other 2020 Democratic candidate\n\n'He's like a bull seeing red'\n\nMessing provoked ire from both sides of the aisle when she posted a tweet last week calling for a public list of Trump donors who will attend an upcoming fundraiser for him in Beverly Hills, California.\n\nThe \"Will & Grace\" actress' tweet drew a harsh response from \"The View\" cohost Whoopi Goldberg, who likened it to the McCarthyism of the 1950s.\n\nTrump had Messing on his mind as recently as Thursday, when he referenced Goldberg's comments and tweeted, \"Bad 'actress' Debra The Mess Messing is in hot water. She wants to create a 'Blacklist' of Trump supporters, & is being accused of McCarthyism.\"\n\nThe president also latched onto another tweet Messing posted in which she praised a sign in front of an Alabama church implying that black voters who support Trump are mentally ill. Messing later apologized for \"recklessly\" sharing the sign and added that its use of the term \"mentally ill\" was \"wrong & hurtful.\"\n\nTrump called Messing a \"racist because of the terrible things she said about blacks and mental illness\" and added that if the actress Roseanne Barr \u2014 an avid Trump supporter \u2014 had said the same thing, she would have been fired.\n\nBarr was fired from her sitcom last year after making racist comments about an aide to former President Barack Obama. \"Will Fake News NBC allow a McCarthy style Racist to continue?\" Trump wrote, referring to Messing.\n\nThe actress responded by linking to a New Yorker piece this week that detailed Trump's wild behavior over the past month.\n\nShe added that she hoped \"his family gets him the help he needs. Sad.\"\n\nRead more: Trump said he skipped a diplomatic trip to monitor Hurricane Dorian. Then he spent the weekend golfing.\n\nAnthony Scaramucci, the former White House communications director, also weighed in on Trump's state of mind on Friday.\n\n\"I think the president is in severe mental decline, and I'm not saying that now because I'm a political adversary or I disavowed him. I'm saying that objectively just looking at what's going on,\" Scaramucci said at the Toronto Global Forum.\n\nThis isn't the first time questions have been raised about Trump's mental state and his fitness for office. In fact, it's a regular topic of discussion in the White House.\n\nThis was confirmed by the anonymous author of a New York Times op-ed last year who said Trump's aides routinely ignore or dismiss his orders for the good of the country. Michael Wolff's \"Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House\" and Bob Woodward's \"Fear: Trump in the White House\" detailed similar instances.\n\nAnd the former special counsel Robert Mueller also found that Trump's myriad efforts to obstruct the Russia investigation were largely unsuccessful only because his underlings refused to carry out his directives.\n\nIndeed, one person who was close to Trump's legal team during the Russia investigation told Insider his public statements were \"nothing compared to what he's like behind closed doors.\"\n\n\"He's like a bull seeing red,\" this person added. \"There's just no getting through to him, and you can kiss your plans for the day goodbye because you're basically stuck looking after a 4-year-old now.\"\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.", "description": "Trump is \"deteriorating in plain sight,\" one Republican strategist who's in frequent contact with the White House told Insider on Friday.", "authors": ["Sonam Sheth"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d72a0d72e22af2be965e028-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
