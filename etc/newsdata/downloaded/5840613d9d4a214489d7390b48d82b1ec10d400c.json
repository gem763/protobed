Beijing has ignored the ruling.\n\nThe Philippines' film regulation board gave the go-ahead for \"Abominable\" to run without restrictions and cinemas have shown it from October 2 with no controversy, according to the country's largest cinema chain.\n\nPhilippine House of Representatives member Lawrence Fortun called for a ban or the scene's removal.\n\n\"Aside from the disinformation and confusion it can create, its showing on Philippine soil will also have a negative bearing on our integrity as a country and nation,\" Fortun said in a statement on Thursday.\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP", "description": "Backlash is growing in Southeast Asia over a scene in the animated film \"Abominable\" that features a map of the South China Sea showing Beijing's contested claims in the flashpoint waterway.
