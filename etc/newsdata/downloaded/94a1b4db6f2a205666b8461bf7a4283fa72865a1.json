Over the life of the mortgage this difference would account for an extra \u00a337,382 in interest payments.\n\nAccord Mortgages also has an attractive rate in the same loan-to-value range of just 2.04 per cent, but this deal also comes with a large fee of \u00a32,294.\n\nAt 75 per cent loan-to-value, Foundation's deal doesn't fare much better. Virgin Money has a five-year fixed rate in this loan-to-value range at 2.12 per cent, with a \u00a31,994 fee.\n\nSimilarly The Mortgage Works has a 75 per cent loan-to-value five-year fixed rate deal at 2.14 per cent with a fee of \u00a32,574.\n\nOn a \u00a3200,000 mortgage taken over 25 years this would cost \u00a3861 a month compared to \u00a31,007 for Foundation's deal. It would also save the borrower some \u00a340,990 in interest over the course of the loan.\n\nFoundation's deals are expensive, but what about the early repayment charges? As attractive as this feature is, it's not unique.\n\nGodiva Mortgages offers a five-year fix at 2.55 per cent up to 75 per cent loan-to-value, or 2.79 per cent for portfolio landlords. Both deals come with an arrangement fee of \u00a31,999.\n\nNeither of these deals have any early repayment charges and, instead, carry an exit fee of just \u00a3125. This means landlords could technically sell up after just a year for just \u00a3125.\n\nThe rate is also far more competitive than Foundation\u2019s. At 2.79 per cent for a portfolio landlord, a \u00a3150,000 Godiva mortgage taken over 25 years would cost \u00a3695 a month, compared to \u00a3755 with Foundation\u2019s deal.\n\nOn top of this, you can make unlimited overpayments without incurring any extra costs.\n\nDavid Hollingworth, of mortgage broker L&C, said: 'Of course most fixed rates will tie the borrower in for the duration of the fixed rate period and that needs to be factored into the decision to take a medium to longer term fixed rate.\n\n'This product looks to offer the opportunity to lock into a rate but only be tied to that rate for the first three years, effectively opening up the option to review the product at that point and choose whether to continue, switch to another deal or potentially even sell the property without incurring a penalty.\n\n'That could be a useful feature for some landlords but there is a price attached to that. The rate on this deal is higher than Foundation's standard five year fix - as you'd expect.'\n\nUltimately whether or not this deal will save a landlord money will depend on their individual circumstances, but for those who are attracted to the lack of early repayment charges, most would likely be better off taking Godiva's five year fix instead.\n\nSpeaking to an independent broker in these situations can help.
