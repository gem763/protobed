Goo had been abused by her ex who threatened to post her spycam sex videos online.\n\n\"I hope Jin-ri is now in a place where she can do whatever she wants,\" Goo wrote on Instagram - using Sulli's real name and sharing photos of the two of them together.\n\nSEE THAT POST HERE:\n\nSulli, who started her career as a child actress at age 11, made her debut in 2009 for f(x), which quickly became one of K-pop's top girl groups.\n\nKnown for behaviour considered controversial in South Korea - including her refusal to wear a bra in public - she had been relentlessly bullied online throughout her career, with many sexually abusive comments.\n\nShe recently hosted a TV series where celebrities discussed their experiences of online abuse. She had also candidly shared her experience struggling with panic disorder and social phobia.\n\nHer outspokenness resonated with many young South Korean women who have been leading a new wave of feminists fighting a patriarchal society obsessed with looks.\n\n\"Being one of the first female artists in K-pop to talk about mental health and feminism is amazing. I love you so much Sulli - I hope in heaven you are finally free,\" a fan wrote in a tweet.\n\nCompiled by Alex Isaacs.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Fans and fellow performers mourned the death of a K-pop star who had long been the target of online bullying.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9469/1ab9728024f04d339e72dbe130173966.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
