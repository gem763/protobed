After that, the consent of two doctors is required.\n\nThe law also makes it illegal for an unqualified person to perform an abortion, with the offence punishable by up to seven years in jail.\n\nAmendments made to appease the bill's conservative opponents included tighter regulations on late-term abortions and mandated medical care for any baby born alive following a termination procedure.\n\nNew South Wales last year introduced \"safe access zones\" around medical clinics and hospitals that provide terminations, to stop anti-abortion protesters from harassing women.", "description": "The move to decriminalise brings Australia's most-populous state in line with the rest of the country.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8982/d9a6ba24a518479083ee0c9727734901.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
