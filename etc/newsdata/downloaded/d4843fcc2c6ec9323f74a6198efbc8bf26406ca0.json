This kind of racial bias is common for those of us in public service, says Labour MP Dawn Butler\n\nI was not surprised to hear that Cardiff\u2019s first black lord mayor, Dan De\u2019Ath, is often mistaken at official events for a security guard or a wine waiter. I experience this all the time, both in the House of Commons and outside. My white, male office manager is sometimes mistaken for the MP Dawn Butler. He goes really red and has to say: \u201cI\u2019m here with Dawn, and Dawn is the MP.\u201d It takes a while to register in people\u2019s minds that the MP is a black woman.\n\nThe other day, I ran out of the Commons for a photograph with Thomas Cook employees, accidentally leaving my pass in the chambers. I had to get back in before a debate started. As I was going through security, one of the guards said: \u201cShe\u2019s an MP, she\u2019s fine,\u201d but the other guard didn\u2019t want to believe it. The slowness to accept can be exhausting \u2013 I have been mistaken for a cleaner by other members of parliament.\n\nHow do I deal with it? It depends. The way I dealt with the situation in parliament the other day was to throw my hands up and say: \u201cThis is crazy!\u201d The way I coped with the person who thought that my office manager was Dawn Butler MP was to say: \u201cI\u2019m leaving\u201d \u2013 because I wanted them to understand the consequences of their bias.\n\nSometimes I will say: \u201cI\u2019m not going to expose you, but this is a real learning moment and I hope you will consider your actions in future.\u201d It is about challenging racism and unconscious bias, and making society a better place for everyone.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dan De\u2019Ath, the lord mayor of Cardiff.\n\nMy black colleagues and I have a WhatsApp group. We survive by discussing our experiences \u2013 and we gain strength from knowing that we have a supportive base. But it can be exhausting.\n\nRecently, I was going to an event with a white colleague. I was carrying the bulk of the luggage because she has arthritis. The person designated to help us approached and asked my colleague if she could take her luggage. She said: \u201cI think Dawn needs help.\u201d She was shocked. I just had to laugh, because sometimes you don\u2019t want to burst someone\u2019s bubble. You have to pick your moments when talking about racial association and bias.\n\nBlack women are used to having to justify their very existence in a space. Sometimes, at an event, I will stand at the entrance and give the room time to take me in. I am black. I am the MP. There is no one else coming. I am the person. It is as though you are working the whole room in that one moment. If someone wants to doubt me, I have already owned that space. You have to own the situation \u2013 otherwise it will destroy you, and who you are.\n\nDawn Butler is the MP for Brent Central", "description": "Cardiff\u2019s first black lord mayor, Dan De\u2019Ath, says he is routinely mistaken for a security guard.
