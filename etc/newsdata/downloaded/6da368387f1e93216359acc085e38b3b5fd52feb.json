The deletion comes after the Warren campaign scrubbed the video from its website the same day Warren apologized at a Native American forum in August.", "description": "", "authors": ["Freebeacon.Com Politics Elizabeth-Warren-Scrubs-Dna-Test-Video-From-Twitter"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
