Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, a Trump donor who started his diplomatic job in July. The investigators are interested in what the ambassador knew and what his role was in Trump\u2019s efforts to get Ukraine to probe former Vice President Joe Biden, who leads the field of potential challengers to the Republican president.\n\nThrough his lawyer on Tuesday, Sondland said he hoped \u201cthe issues raised by the State Department that preclude his testimony will be resolved promptly.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe stands ready to testify on short notice, whenever he is permitted to appear,\u201d Sondland\u2019s lawyer, Robert Luskin, said in a statement.\n\nState Department officials could not be immediately reached to comment on what issues had blocked his testimony.\n\nThe impeachment probe is focusing on a whistleblower\u2019s allegations that Trump used nearly $400 million in U.S. military aid to secure a promise from Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate Biden, a leading candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. The whistleblower\u2019s legal team was in the final stages of talks for the intelligence officer to speak to both Democratic and Republican-led congressional intelligence committees as early as this week, congressional officials said.\n\nRepresentative Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee spearheading the impeachment probe, told reporters the move to block Sondland from testifying or turning over his text messages or emails was obstruction.\n\n\u201cWe will consider this act today \u2026 to be further acts of obstruction of a coequal branch of government,\u201d Schiff told reporters.\n\nSondland was a key witness for the House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight Committees, whose staff had been expected to ask him why he became involved in dealings with Ukraine, which is not a member of the EU.\n\nTrump has derided the impeachment inquiry and has denied he did anything wrong in a July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in which Trump pushed for an investigation of Biden and his son.\n\n\u201cI would love to send Ambassador Sondland, a really good man and great American, to testify, but unfortunately he would be testifying before a totally compromised kangaroo court, where Republicans\u2019 rights have been taken away, and true facts are not allowed out for the public\u2026.to see,\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter.\n\nAccording to text messages released by House committee leaders last week, Sondland was heavily involved in contacts with Zelenskiy as he sought a meeting with Trump, and Ukrainian officials expressed concern at the administration\u2019s decision to block U.S. military assistance for Kiev.\n\nIn one of the texts, for example, Sondland emphasized that Trump \u201creally wants the deliverable.\u201d\n\nFollowing the allegations that Trump pressured Zelenskiy to investigate Biden while withholding the military aid, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment investigation last month.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "The Trump administration on Tuesday blocked an ambassador from testifying to the U.S. House of Representatives\u2019 impeachment investigation of President Donald Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/White-House.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
