South African miner Exxaro buys remaining 50% stake in wind farm JV\n\nJOHANNESBURG, Sept 17 (Reuters) - South African miner Exxaro Resources Ltd said on Tuesday it acquired the remaining 50% stake in its wind farm joint venture for 1.55 billion rand ($105.56 million) as it looks to expand its energy business.\n\nThe move will help Exxaro consolidate its interest in renewable energy at a time when South Africa needs energy security amid increasing negative sentiment towards coal-based electricity generation, said Exxaro Chief Executive Officer Mxolisi Mgojo.\n\nSouth Africa, Africa's most advanced economy and also its worst polluter, generates most of its energy from coal-fired power plants that emit millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.\n\nExxaro bought the stake from Khopoli Investments, a subsidiary of Tata Power Company, and said the agreement was subject to regulatory approvals.\n\nCennergi, the joint venture, owns two wind farms in the Eastern Cape province with a projected 2019 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of around 850 million rand.
