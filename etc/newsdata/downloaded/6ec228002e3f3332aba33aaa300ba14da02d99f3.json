What kind of invitation is this where I had to pay postage due to get your mail! The magnet was cracked as well. Arlene.\u201d\n\nUtterly gobsmacked, Amy starts off with explaining the situation about the postage.\n\n\u201cI went to the post office to verify the postage. The invite was under an ounce but since it was slightly thicker being a magnet they said use two ounce stamps which are 70 cents so I did.\n\nPeople have been getting them all over, California, Arizona, Florida, Georgia with no issues.\u201d\n\nWant to join the family?

I put additional postage on it. People in Florida, Washington, Texas have gotten it with no additional postage needed,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cSecond of all - you wasted an additional 55 cents to send that letter to us? Next time refuse the letter if you\u2019re a** is going to b**** about $3.\u201d\n\nAnd Amy had no intentions of just leaving at it venting and moving on.\n\n\u201cSo I am going to be petty as hell and send her a nasty a** letter back with a check in it for $3.51 to cover her postage, and hopefully she doesn't come to the wedding.\u201d\n\nArlene complained about having to pay extra postage and then died a few days later.

HOW CRAZY IS THAT!!!!!\u201d\n\nAnd fellow group members were equally baffled by the outcome.\n\n\u201cI'm literally shocked at the update,\u201d one said.\n\nWhile another commented, \u201cOMG what a turn of events.\u201d", "description": "\"I am going to be petty as hell and send her a nasty a** letter back.\u201d", "authors": ["Leesa Smith"], "top_image": "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/118c92d735e2239cf558e93f903f8ca4", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
