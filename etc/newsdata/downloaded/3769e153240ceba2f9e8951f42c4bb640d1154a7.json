These are churchmen who care for migrants, promote dialogue with Muslims and minister to the faithful in poor, far-flung missionary posts.\n\nWith Saturday\u2019s consistory, Francis will have named 52% of the voting-age cardinals. Many hail from churches in the developing world that never have had a \u201cprince\u201d representing them in a sign of Francis\u2019 desire to mirror the universal face of the Catholic Church in the church\u2019s leadership ranks.\n\nFrancis was in many ways preaching to the choir when he urged the new cardinals to both feel and share God\u2019s compassion, saying it was an \u201cessential\u201d part of understanding God\u2019s love for the weakest and most marginal.\n\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t feel it, how can I share it, bear witness to it, bestow it on others?\u201d he asked in his homily. \u201cSo many disloyal actions on the part of ecclesiastics are born of the lack of a sense of having been shown compassion, and by the habit of averting one\u2019s gaze, the habit of indifference.\u201d\n\nThe consistory comes at a fraught time in Francis\u2019 six-year papacy. Opposition is mounting among conservative Catholics who disapprove of his emphasis on the environment, migrants and other issues rather than the doctrinaire focus of his predecessor Pope Benedict XVI.\n\nYet in a sign of continuity with the past pope, Francis and the new cardinals made a pilgrimage across the Vatican gardens after the ceremony Saturday evening to call on Benedict, who gave them his blessing, the Vatican said.\n\nFrancis has acknowledged criticism in the U.S. church but shown no sign that such conservative outrage is hampering his agenda. After he stacks the College of Cardinals with more likeminded men, he will on Sunday open a three-week meeting on better ministering to the indigenous peoples of the Amazon region.\n\nRight-wing groups backed by a handful of conservative cardinals have come out in force against the Amazon synod\u2019s environmental emphasis, saying it amounts to a heretical attempt to create a new \u201cpagan\u201d religion.\n\nA Canadian priest elevated Saturday, Cardinal Michael Czerny, said he thinks the criticism is coming from a small fringe with vested interests in developing the Amazon and pursuing other priorities incompatible with the pope\u2019s vision.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s meeting with some loud opposition. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s so much,\u201d Czerny told The Associated Press ahead of the consistory. \u201cI think it\u2019s loud.\u201d\n\nCzerny is clearly a Francis favorite, someone in whom the pope sees a cardinal he can entrust his most important dossiers. Czerny has worked since 2010 in the Vatican\u2019s justice office, where he helped draft Francis\u2019 major environmental encyclical. In 2016, Francis made Czerny his personal point-man on migrant issues, and the pectoral cross he sported Saturday showed he took the mission to heart: It was made of wood from a migrant ship.\n\nA Jesuit like the pope, Czerny went to El Salvador in 1989 after six Jesuit confreres were gunned down at Central American University. For a South American Jesuit like Francis, the killings were an unfathomable assault that laid bare the order\u2019s social justice ethos, the same ethos that years later would inform his papacy.\n\nSeveral other prelates with experience in another of Francis\u2019 agenda items- relations with Islam \u2013 also received red hats, including the head of the Vatican\u2019s interfaith relations office, Cardinal Miguel Angel Ayuso Guixot, and Guixot\u2019s predecessor in that job, Cardinal Michael Fitzgerald.\n\nLong considered one of the church\u2019s leading experts on Islam, Fitzgerald was removed as president of the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue in 2006 and sent off to Egypt as the Vatican\u2019s ambassador. His removal came a month before Benedict folded the interfaith relations office into the Vatican\u2019s culture ministry, in a move seen as reducing dialogue with Islam in a post-9/11 world.\n\nThe Vatican restored the office as its own entity the following year after Benedict enraged the Muslim world with a now-infamous speech equating Islam with violence. Only recently under Francis have Catholic-Muslim relations healed.\n\nMany commentators have seen Francis\u2019 decision to make Fitzgerald a cardinal as a righting of a past wrong. Fitzgerald, who is over 80 and unable to vote in a conclave, was diplomatic when asked about the significance that both he and his successor were receiving red hats, saying it showed \u201ccontinuity.\u201d\n\nAnother new cardinal over the voting age limit was a clear sentimental favorite for Francis: Lithuanian Cardinal Sigitas Tamkevicius, a Jesuit who was imprisoned and sent to labor camps for 10 years, some of them in Siberian exile, for his anti-Soviet activities.\n\nTamkevicius accompanied Francis last year on a visit to site of a KGB prison in Vilnius where he had been was held, one of the most moving moments of the pope\u2019s trip to Lithuania.\n\n\u201cIn prison, there were difficult moments, very difficult moments, and the worst was when I was interrogated,\u201d Tamkevicius told journalists at the Vatican this week. \u201cThe interrogation would last for months and months.\u201d\n\nHe said he was thankful to God \u201cfor all these years that I have had as priest, as bishop, as archbishop.\u201d\n\n\u201cI ask that he allows me to go on a lot longer so that I can face the challenges of today and always have the faith in my heart,\u201d Tamkevicius said.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show the surname of a Jesuit priest named as a cardinal is spelled Czerny, not Czerney.", "description": "VATICAN CITY (AP) \u2014 Pope Francis has added 13 new cardinals to the top of the Catholic hierarchy, telling them they must show God's compassion to those", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/06/674cc5_vatican-cardinals-57780-pope-francis-is-moved-as-he-greets-cardinal-sigitas-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
