When did she realise? Why hasn\u2019t she mentioned it to Cain? He\u2019s her grandson, why keep it secret?\n\n\"Faith knew Cain had a son out there,\" added another.\n\nA third asked: \"Are we supposed to be surprised Faith knew Cain had a son\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: SHARED CONTENT UNIT)\n\nLots of theories have been circulating over the true identity of Nate's mum - with some even claiming Cain might not be his real dad.\n\nThere has been no confirmation that the woman in the photo is actually Nate's mother but she is obviously linked to the farmhand in some way.\n\nAnd it's clear that Faith did recognise the woman in the photo due to her seriously alarmed reaction.\n\nWho is Nate's mum? Will we ever find out?\n\n*Emmerdale airs weekdays on ITV at 7pm with an extra episode on Thursdays at 8pm", "description": "Emmerdale's Faith Dingle was shaking after making an explosive discovery - and has a ticking timebomb", "authors": ["Kyle O'Sullivan", "Image", "Itv", "Shared Content Unit"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20709205.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Emmerdale-Faith.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
