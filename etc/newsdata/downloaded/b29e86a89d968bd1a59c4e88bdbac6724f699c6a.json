And, Leonard Fournette\u2019s run for the 2-point conversion failed in the 13-12 loss.\n\nHouston (1-1) led by 7 in the fourth quarter when Jacksonville rookie Gardner Minshew led a long drive that included an 18-yard run on fourth-and-10, and he capped it with a 4-yard TD pass to DJ Chark.\n\nInstead of trying to tie it with an extra point, Jaguars coach Doug Marrone opted to go for the potential win by having Fournette attempt to run it in. But the big running back was stopped by Justin Reid. The play was upheld by video review.\n\n\u201cWe had a bunch of different plays called (depending on the defense),\u201d Marrone said. \u201cAt the end of the day, we were fine with any of them. We came up a couple of inches short and we lost the game.\u201d\n\nFournette believed he got in.\n\n\u201cYou seen it,\u201d he said. \u201cI tried to jump across and felt like I got over, but they thought otherwise.\u201d\n\nMarrone said he decided before the last possession that he would go for two points if the Jaguars (0-2) scored a touchdown.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018If we start driving the football and score with a certain amount of time left, I\u2019m going to go for 2,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI immediately had the play in mind before the drive even started. I was very, very comfortable with it. It just didn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nMinshew, a sixth-round pick, threw for 213 yards and a touchdown for the Jaguars in his first NFL start filling in for Nick Foles, who broke his collarbone last week.\n\nHe was disappointed Fournette didn\u2019t get in, but believes the Jaguars made the right decision by going for the win.\n\n\u201cWe felt really good about the call,\u201d Minshew said. \u201cWe had the right look. Leonard was close. I thought he got it, but that\u2019s how it goes sometimes. I\u2019d bet 10 times out of 10 for him to get in there.\u201d\n\nEven Reid wasn\u2019t surprised the Jaguars gambled for the win with Fournette.\n\n\u201cWell, Fournette is their guy,\u201d Reid said. \u201cIf I was their offensive coordinator and I could put the ball in anybody\u2019s hands I would have put it in Fournette\u2019s hands, too.\u201d\n\nMarrone was impressed with the Minshew\u2019s performance after being thrust into the starting role despite the loss.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t play like a rookie,\u201d Marron said. \u201cThere are some things that he\u2019ll improve on. \u2026 We have to keep working and have to do a better job of coaching it and a better job performing it. On that last drive, you could see the poise that the kid has. He was able to go down the field and score. He\u2019s not a guy that gets rattled, he understands what we\u2019re trying to get accomplished, and I couldn\u2019t be happier with him.\u201d\n\nThe last play wrapped up an interesting game that included a heated exchange between Marrone and star cornerback Jalen Ramsey. The Texans led 3-0 after a field goal with about two minutes left in the first quarter. Ramsey was apparently upset that Marrone didn\u2019t challenge a catch by DeAndre Hopkins on third-and-2 earlier in that drive and the two were seen yelling at each other on the sideline after that drive.\n\nMarrone was asked about the exchange and didn\u2019t provide many details.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of emotions in the game,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t recall.\u201d\n\nRamsey refused to talk to reporters after the game.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Jacksonville Jaguars could have played it safe on Sunday against the Houston Texans and kicked an extra point after scoring a touchdown with seconds left to likely send the game to overtime.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Kristie Rieken"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/15/jaguars_texans_football_71988_c0-161-3862-2412_s1770x1032.jpg?cc8e67293b3fe5ad23adb45bd114b1627159d616", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
