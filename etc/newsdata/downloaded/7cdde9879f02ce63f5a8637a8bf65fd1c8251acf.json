This has been an undercurrent since news first broke of Trump\u2019s interactions with Ukraine but only somewhat vaguely. Recent revelations, particularly the testimony of acting Ukraine ambassador William B. Taylor Jr. on Tuesday, remove any reasonable doubt that this is specifically what happened.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump has been insistent: There was no quid pro quo involving Ukraine. That's hard to square with:\n\nActing White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney saying that aid was withheld in part to get Ukraine to investigate the hacking of the Democratic National Committee in 2016\n\nTaylor testifying that E.U. Ambassador Gordon Sondland and Ukraine special envoy Kurt Volker told him that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky needed to make clear that he supported investigations before he\u2019d get a meeting at the White House\n\nSondland reportedly telling officials in a July 10 meeting that a meeting between Trump and Zelensky would be predicated on Zelensky opening the investigations, according to former administration official Fiona Hill\n\nVolker, according to Taylor, saying he would tell Zelensky that a White House meeting depended on Zelensky opening investigations to \u201cget to the bottom of things\u201d\n\nVolker texting a Zelensky aide before Trump and Zelensky spoke to tell him that \u201cassuming President [Zelensky] convinces trump he will investigate / \u2018get to the bottom of what happened\u2019 in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington\u201d\n\nSondland telling a Zelensky aide, according to Taylor, that military assistance would be held until Zelensky committed to a Biden-related investigation\n\nSondland telling Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) that aid depended on the investigations\n\nTrump denying a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d while confirming to Johnson that he wanted Ukraine to investigate the 2016 hacking\n\nSondland telling Taylor in response to questions about a quid pro quo that Trump wanted a public announcement about an investigation\n\nAfter Trump\u2019s instructions, Sondland telling Zelensky (again according to Taylor) that without an announcement about investigations, the United States and Ukraine would be at a \u201cstalemate\u201d\n\nTrump replying to Zelensky\u2019s mention of military aid in their July 25 call with a request for a favor: an investigation of the hacking.\n\nThe best defense the White House has been able to muster was that there was no quid pro quo because they chose not to define the actions above as a quid pro quo. In response to Taylor\u2019s testimony, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham released a statement including that assertion. It read, in part:\n\n\u201cPresident Trump has done nothing wrong \u2014 this is a coordinated smear campaign from far-left lawmakers and radical unelected bureaucrats waging war on the Constitution. There was no quid pro quo. Today was just more triple hearsay and selective leaks from the Democrats\u2019 politically-motivated, closed door, secretive hearings.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nEven beyond the denial of quid pro quo in the face of the evidence of a quid pro quo, the statement is grasping. The smear campaign from \u201cfar-left lawmakers\u201d and \u201cradical unelected bureaucrats\u201d involves evidence released by:\n\nAD\n\nKurt Volker, a George W. Bush and Trump administration appointee\n\nFiona Hill, appointed to the National Security Council by Trump and also worked under Bush\n\nWilliam B. Taylor Jr., asked to return to service in Ukraine by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\n\nThe rough transcript of Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky released by the White House.\n\nThe \u201cselective leaks\u201d Tuesday included Taylor\u2019s full opening statement, which is somewhat hard to take out of context.\n\nGrisham and Trump allies broadly have argued that holding depositions of witnesses behind closed doors is itself suspicious. Republicans have made a big deal out of this despite, as The Washington Post\u2019s Paul Kane reports, fully engaging in the process. Perhaps Republican attendees of the hearings have chosen not to leak any details that emerge that are exculpatory for Trump. Or perhaps there\u2019s another reason that what emerges is so damning.\n\nAD\n\nThe problem for Trump\u2019s allies is that the questions at stake are obvious and fundamental. From the outset of the Ukraine scandal, there has been an effort to redirect away from those fundamental questions and to ancillary ones. Isn\u2019t the whistleblower biased? Isn\u2019t the impeachment process unfair? Isn\u2019t House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) reprehensible? Aren\u2019t the motivations of various people chosen by Trump to serve in the government suspect? These are, admittedly, easier questions for Trump and his allies to answer than the questions about the propriety of soliciting politically useful information or using congressional aid as leverage to the president\u2019s political benefit.\n\nAD\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Trump offered a new line of attack in a tweet.\n\nNeither he (Taylor) or any other witness has provided testimony that the Ukrainians were aware that military aid was being withheld. You can\u2019t have a quid pro quo with no quo.\u201d Congressman John Ratcliffe @foxandfriends Where is the Whistleblower? The Do Nothing Dems case is DEAD! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 23, 2019\n\nThe Ratcliffe argument (which Trump saw on Fox News) is an interesting one: Can you have a quid pro quo on aid without Ukraine knowing that aid was being held up? The problem with the point is twofold: Ukraine eventually learned about the aid, and the aid wasn\u2019t the only point of pressure that Trump\u2019s team was applying.\n\nAD\n\nBut Trump nonetheless goes sideways: Where is the whistleblower? The answer to that question is simple: It matters less each day who the whistleblower was or what their overwhelmingly accurate complaint articulated. The increasing weight of what's known about Trump's actions yields clarity.\n\nIt\u2019s not about what the whistleblower or Schiff or Taylor did. It\u2019s about what Trump did. And it\u2019s about whether what Trump did is acceptable.\n\nAD", "description": "Trump and his allies have declared war on an army of straw men.", "authors": ["Philip Bump", "National Correspondent Focused Largely On The Numbers Behind Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/yk7ucp2xteJ3HH88dPpovOyGc5E=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XFKQ2QHKTMI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
