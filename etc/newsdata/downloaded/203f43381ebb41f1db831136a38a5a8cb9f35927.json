The former couple are seen in 2017 above\n\n'Also, touring,' he went on. 'Experiencing touring and being on stage every night, getting that buzz off the crowd and being with fans who have paid their well-earned money to come and watch only you - you learn a lot about yourself, you learn about what people want to listen to.\n\n'I have stuff that I want to write about on my mind all the time. I had just gone through a break up, which helps when it comes to writing songs, I guess. It helps vent the emotions.\n\nDespite it's morose moments, the former boy band member still said the album is a 'fun' one.\n\n'I am just ready to go! The album is fun. There are some very sad moments, but for the most part it is a fun album. There are some nice melodies in there, some cool guitar riffs. I think my fans are going to enjoy it.'\n\nStill fun: Despite it's morose moments, the former boy band member (above October 4) still said the album is a 'fun' one\n\nAnd Niall also revealed that his sultry new single 'Nice To Meet Ya' was inspired by a brief flirtation he had with a woman during a night out.\n\nHe said: 'The lyrics came about from a half-true story. I was out one night and locked eyes with this girl. We got chatting, and she was with a group of her mates and I was with a group of my mates.\n\n'It felt like every time I turned around - like the lyric says - she just kind of disappeared. But then over the course of the same night, in different bars around that same area, we would bump into each other. It's a song that is basically like a movie that is based on a true story, and then you start changing stuff that makes the song start to sound a little bit more interesting.'", "description": "The 26-year-old singer/songwriter is preparing to release his second solo record and admitted that many of the songs were inspired by his heartbreak over his split from Hailee, 22.", "authors": ["Dailymail.Com Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/16/19363690-0-image-a-7_1570374197752.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
