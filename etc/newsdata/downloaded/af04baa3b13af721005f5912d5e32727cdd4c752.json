Against the euro, the pound was also flat at 86.04 pence.\n\nJeremy Stretch, forex analyst at CIBC, said he expected \"good sterling buying interest should we see any dip back towards $1.2750.\"\n\n\"The UK leaving the EU with a deal remains the most likely ultimate outcome, in our view, although not necessarily by Oct. 31,\" said Paul Hollingworth, chief UK economist at BNP Paribas, adding that he expects \"bullish sentiment to persist.\"\n\nBroader market sentiment seemed to mirror Hollingworth's view, as gauges for implied sterling volatility in different tenures eased off recent highs.\n\nOvernight volatility slipped to 19.6 vol from a three-year high of 30.3 vol on Saturday. One-month implied volatility, which encompasses the still relevant Oct. 31 Brexit deadline, also declined.\n\nMoreover, leveraged funds had fewer sterling short positions than in August, although volumes increased very slightly to $5.53 billion in the week to Oct. 15, CFTC data showed.\n\nSome said sterling could still swing around as uncertainty lingers over Brexit.\n\n\"While the reason that sterling has remained pretty well supported is because of this perception that Johnson does have the numbers and a deal could happen in the next few days, there's still plenty of scope for volatility,\" said Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at Rabobank.\n\nBritain could still leave the EU in 10 days time, French Junior Economic Minister Agnes Pannier-Runacher said on Monday.\n\n(Reporting by Olga Cotaga; Additional reporting by Elizabeth Howcroft; Editing by Hugh Lawson)", "description": "Sterling held steady on Monday as investors assessed the outlook for Brexit developments this week after parliament forced Prime Minister Boris Johnson to write to the European Union to ask for a delay to Britain leaving the bloc.
