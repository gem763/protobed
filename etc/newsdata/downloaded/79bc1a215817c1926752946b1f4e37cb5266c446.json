The goal is partly to reach younger generations more familiar with mobile technology, as well as women in rural areas who may lack easy access to in-person services, the nonprofit organization said.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Do you think Planned Parenthood\u2019s expansion of its telemedicine program will affect its political standing, especially among conservatives? Join the conversation below.\n\nExpanding the app represents Planned Parenthood\u2019s latest move to blunt efforts by the Republican-led states and the Trump administration to cut the organization\u2019s funding.\n\n\u201cAs politicians across the country try to restrict or block access to critical reproductive and sexual health care, the Planned Parenthood Direct app is just one part of the work we do to ensure that more people can get the care they need, no matter where they are,\u201d said Alexis McGill Johnson, acting president and chief executive of Planned Parenthood.\n\nLast month, the organization opted to forgo about $60 million in annual federal funds rather than adhere to new Trump administration restrictions on its ability to refer patients for abortion.\n\nStates have sought to strip Medicaid funding from Planned Parenthood, efforts it has fought in the courts. The Trump administration has also tried to steer funding for teen-pregnancy-prevention programs to organizations that promote abstinence, many of which are religiously affiliated. Abortion-rights groups including Planned Parenthood have challenged such moves as unconstitutional restrictions on abortion access guaranteed by the Supreme Court\u2019s 1973 Roe v. Wade decision.\n\nSome Planned Parenthood affiliates use telemedicine to offer abortion services, in which a provider prescribes mifepristone and misoprostol to end early pregnancies, but they still require in-person visits to an office.\n\nPlanned Parenthood currently offers abortion medication through a telemedicine model in 14 states. About 20 states ban providers from using online technology to provide the medications that induce an early abortion.\n\nCorrections & Amplifications\n\nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s telemedicine app is currently available in 27 states and Washington, D.C. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated it was available in 26 states and Washington, D.C.
