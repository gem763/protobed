So much so that sometimes we end up hoarding any and everything. That\u2019s where the trouble begins.\n\nThere\u2019s no denying that everything seems like a \u201cmust-buy\u201d when it's on a discounted rate. However, we often end up picking things mindlessly in such a situation. I mean, think about that cool dude T-shirt you bought but never wore, or maybe those extra phone covers that keep lying in the drawer - just so pointless!\n\nET Money\u2019s latest campaign brings to light such hurried and mindless shopping shenanigans that we need to stray away from. In the video, a couple of shoe pairs can be seen back-chatting about the owner - right from \u201che hasn\u2019t worn us in 2 years\u201d to \u201cdude, he hasn\u2019t even taken us out of the box yet\u201d. This video highlights how we keep adding things to our lot - be it shoes or shirts, clearly when we don\u2019t need it.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that sale season spells out \u201csplurge\u201d, but only on the things we need. Come on, guys! Monitor discount offers and teasers on the items that you actually need - those swanky stilettos, a new phone, or anything else that you\u2019ve been eyeing. Make the discounts count, and dish out money on something that you genuinely need.\n\nThis sale season, let\u2019s quit being just another frenzied customer, and add to cart wisely!", "description": "ET Money\u2019s latest campaign brings into light such hurried and mindless shopping shenanigans that we need to stray away from.
