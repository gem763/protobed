(SFFA), which represented Asian-American applicants to Harvard. The group\u2019s head, Edward Blum, has raised millions of dollars from conservative groups to back legal challenges to affirmative action. On Tuesday, Blum pledged to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court, if necessary.\n\nThe ruling also shined a spotlight on Harvard\u2019s often opaque admissions policy, under which only 4.5% of a record 43,000 applicants were admitted for its incoming freshman class this fall. And although the ruling revealed no systemic discrimination, it showed Asian-Americans consistently fell below white applicants in \u201cpersonal\u201d qualities, a sensitive area where subjectivity and preconceptions thrive.\n\nThose stereotypes \u2014 which we\u2019ll get into later \u2014 are not prevalent now among Harvard admissions officers, Judge Burroughs wrote in her 130-page decisions. But they may be alive and well at the high school level, where teachers and guidance counselors give Asian-American applicants less enthusiastic personal recommendations than they do for white students. That may well hurt Asian-American applicants, the judge acknowledged.\n\nAsian-Americans comprise 6% of the U.S. population and 25% of Harvard\u2019s class of 2023, their highest percentage in a decade. (African-Americans and Hispanics together encompass 26% of Harvard\u2019s freshman class.) That\u2019s about in line with Rice University, a private university in Houston, and Stony Brook University, a Long Island-based public university that is one of the nation\u2019s top 10 upward-mobility machines. California Institute of Technology has almost 40% Asian-American enrollment and three campuses of the University of California \u2014 Berkeley, Irvine, and San Diego \u2014 are in the mid- to high 30% range.\n\nIf academics were the sole criterion for admission, there might be even more Asian-Americans wearing crimson each year. But Harvard, like most highly selective colleges, also looks at extracurricular activities, athletic participation and personal qualities in deciding whether to admit a particular applicant. Harvard rates each applicant from 1 to 4 in each of those criteria, with 1 being the highest.\n\n\u201cAsian-American applicants\u2019 disproportionate strength in academics comes at the expense of other skills and traits that Harvard values,\u201d Judge Burroughs wrote.\n\nAsian-Americans way outperformed white applicants in academics, including standardized-test scores, and slightly topped white applicants in extracurricular activities. But they lagged badly in athletics. And some testimony at trial (from a witness for the plaintiffs) suggested \u201cAsian-American identity is associated with a lower probability of being assigned a strong personal rating by an admission officer.\u201d\n\nA 1990 report from the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Civil Rights, which investigated possible discrimination against Asian-Americans at Harvard \u201cfound recurring characterizations of Asian-American applicants that were broadly consistent with stereotypes.\u201d These included phrases such as \u201creserved, hardworking,\u201d \u201cquiet and, of course, wants to be a doctor\u201d (these were the days before \u201cof course, wants to be a software engineer\u201d) and \u201cextraordinarily gifted in math with the opposite extreme in English.\u201d The OCR concluded there was no systematic discrimination, however.\n\nThe judge said Harvard had cleaned up its act since then, but those stereotypes persist \u2014 in high schools. Recommendations from teachers and guidance counselors are \u201camong the most significant inputs for the personal rating,\u201d Judge Burroughs wrote, and they\u2019re not giving their best Asian-American students the most ringing endorsements.\n\n\u201cTeacher and guidance counselor recommendations seemingly presented Asian-Americans as having less favorable personal characteristics than similarly situated non-Asian American applicants,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt is possible that Asian-American applicants to Harvard are being disadvantaged by biases in their high schools that affect their college applications.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, that effect cannot be quantified.\n\nThe SFFA has compared the situation faced by Asian-Americans with the infamous \u201cJewish quotas,\u201d which capped admission of Jewish Americans to the Ivy League from the 1920s through the 1960s. They were instituted by presidents like Columbia\u2019s Nicholas Murray Butler and Harvard\u2019s A. Lawrence Lowell, who actually said he was limiting the number of Jewish students to prevent anti-Semitism on campus, surely the ultimate definition of \u201cchutzpah.\u201d\n\nBack then, Jews were considered academic grinds who lacked personal and leadership skills. That led to the current \u201cholistic\u201d admissions policies that include academics, athletics, extracurricular activities and personality.\n\nThat system does produce more well-rounded students and a better college experience. And, Judge Burroughs ruled, Harvard clearly showed it does not discriminate against Asian-Americans. But prejudices and stereotypes always lurk just below the surface, and they still have great power, well beyond the reach of the law and all reason.\n\nNow read: Trump administration requires Texas Tech medical school to end use of race in determining admissions\n\nHoward R.
