Instead, last year the Fishers bought a four-bedroom house for $875,000 in Santa Fe, N.M., where Mr. Fisher skied 23 times in one season on powdery slopes just a 20-minute drive from home. \u201cPeople go to meetings in the morning and ski in the afternoon,\u201d he says.\n\nSanta Fe is better known for its art, opera and Southwestern cuisine than for winter sports. But the capital, with a population of 84,000, happens to be at an elevation of 7,199 feet. A combination of a diverse culture, temperate weather and a marketing drive to increase awareness of its snowy offerings is luring more skiers to the area, even while the industry as a whole is facing a variety of challenges. New Mexico has eight Alpine (downhill) and three Nordic (cross-country) ski areas; the closest to the capital is Ski Santa Fe, 16 miles away, while Taos, a world-class resort, is just two hours away.\n\nInside Some of Santa Fe\u2019s Luxury Ski Homes New Mexico is drawing more new residents to the slopes. Mark and Christine Fisher bought this house in Santa Fe, N.M., last year for $875,000.

The mountain, with 83 trails on 660 acres, has added snow-making, covering over half its terrain.\n\nDeena and Steve Koundouriotis bought this 3,500-square-foot, three-bedroom house in Santa Fe in 2008 for $1.1 million.

Sales over $1 million also grew: to 112 year-to-date from 93 two years ago. A report released by Christie\u2019s in May 2018 calls Santa Fe the \u201chottest second-home market\u201d in the world.\n\nDarlene Streit, a broker with Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, says Santa Fe is drawing people looking for more-affordable destinations than its high-end rivals. In the downtown district, the average sold price ranges from $350 to $800 a square foot, while in the outskirts it can vary from $250 to $500, including in Las Campanas, a luxury gated community with two Jack Nicklaus-designed golf courses.\n\nThat is lower than ski towns such as Aspen (average price about $1,000 a square foot) and Park City Utah ($600 a square foot). Another benefit: The year-round population is about 84,000. \u201cPeople come here to get around to get away from crowds,\u201d she says.\n\nFor Sale in Santa Fe Photo: Marshall Elias Photography $2.495 million\n\nCamino Rancheros\n\nFour bedrooms, four bathrooms A 3,789-square-foot home, designed by Santa Fe artist Douglas Atwill, is a mixture of Pueblo and Territorial styles. Located on 1.11 acres near the city\u2019s Museum Hill district, it has three garden areas, a koi pond, a guesthouse, a pool with a cabana and a two-car garage.

The medical oncologist moved there full time five years ago from Wisconsin after he woke up one night worrying that it was now or never if he wanted a change.\n\nThe first year, he rented a small casita and went skiing almost every day. Now, he has transitioned into biotech and lives in a new, 3,700-square-foot, three-bedroom house designed by renowned Albuquerque architect Bart Prince. He built a home for about $1.55 million on a 6-acre lot he bought for $300,000. When he isn\u2019t traveling, Dr. Geller, 66, skis almost every day before work. Santa Fe is \u201cnot the kind of ski town where you ski, eat and go to bed,\u201d he says.\n\nDeena and Steve Koundouriotis tried Vail before they found Santa Fe. The couple had a vacation condo there when they lived in Sierra Madre, Calif. But when they sold their electrical-wiring-system company in 2008 and started thinking about a new primary residence, they ruled out Vail.\n\n\u201cThe winters are really long there,\u201d says Mrs. Koundouriotis.\n\nThe couple bought a 3,500-square-foot, three-bedroom house that year for $1.1 million about 12 miles from Ski Santa Fe and 4 miles from downtown Santa Fe because they wanted to be close to the ski area and the restaurants and nightlife. \u201cWe get both worlds here,\u201d she says.\n\nSki Santa Fe is \u201cthe neighborhood mountain,\u201d says Bart Lally, a 36-year-old physician assistant, whose father was a lift operator there in the 1990s. Mr. Lally moved back to Santa Fe two years ago from Palo Alto, Calif., and bought a three-bedroom, three-bathroom, 1,750-square-foot house assessed at $700,000, which he sold. He is now renting a 2,000-square-foot, three-bedroom, three-bathroom house on 2 acres for $2,500 a month and is looking for a new house.\n\nSanta Fe seems very affordable to him after the sticker shock of the Bay Area. \u201cI can live anywhere with my job, but I wanted a ski base,\u201d he says.\n\nLocals say Ski Santa Fe almost never has lift lines (except during holidays), the roads don\u2019t require chains and parking is easy. Season passes go for about $500 and are less than $100 for those 72 years old or older or under 46 inches tall. Many partake in what is called \u201cearn your turns.\u201d They hike up the mountain to get in a couple runs before the chairlifts open at 10 a.m. Kids ski there as part of their physical-education classes at school.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve done business on the ski lift,\u201d says Monica McLin, a real-estate broker with Keller Williams in Santa Fe, who takes clients skiing.\n\nHitting the Slopes in New Mexico The state boasts eight alpine and three Nordic ski areas.

She is seeing more skiers from California and New York, along with the usual contingent of Texans. A bus goes year round between downtown and Ski Santa Fe for $5 one-way.\n\nMatt McDaniel, who owns Saltary Outdoor, says tourists tell him they like Santa Fe\u2019s culture and history. \u201cThere\u2019s a feeling of authenticity here,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is not homogenized.\u201d\n\nWhen Jeremy Jones was working as an attorney in San Francisco, the closest skiing was three hours away in Lake Tahoe\u2014an exhausting drive, he says. Looking for a change in work and life, he remembered going to Ski Santa Fe as a kid growing up in Kansas City.\n\nHe bought his first house in Santa Fe for $345,000 in 2005, which he now rents for $2,000 a month. Two years ago, he bought a two-bedroom, 2,150-square-foot newer home closer to the mountains for $440,000. He takes friends skiing when they visit.\n\nMost people don\u2019t think of Santa Fe as a ski town, he says. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a hidden secret.\u201d\n\nSanta Fe Highlights Alpine Sports: This outdoor shop, in operation for more than 50 years, has skiing, snowboarding, and camping and climbing gear, and rents out ski equipment.
