Mandatory Credit: Stephen Spillman-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThough Northern Irishman McIlroy will not feature in the event, he knows Woods well enough to make an intelligent observation of the 15-times major champion.\n\nWoods was famously lukewarm about team events early in his career, appearing almost disinterested in the Ryder Cup and Presidents Cup.\n\nBut his passion has grown as he has entered middle-age, and at 43 he will lead a superstar team at Royal Melbourne from Dec. 12-15 in what no doubt will be a test run for a future captaincy in the Ryder Cup against Europe.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s evolved a lot as a person over the years and I think he takes his leadership role in those team competitions a lot more seriously now than he might have before,\u201d McIlroy said on Wednesday on the eve of the Zozo Championship.\n\n\u201cHe put a lot into the U.S. team at Hazeltine (site of the 2016 Ryder Cup) when he couldn\u2019t play but was a vice captain.\n\n\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have taken the job as Presidents Cup captain if he wasn\u2019t going to give it his undivided attention. So I think he\u2019ll be a wonderful captain. If he approaches the captaincy the way he\u2019s approached his whole career, he\u2019ll be great at that.\u201d\n\nWoods will spearhead a team that has completely dominated the Presidents Cup against an International team comprising non-European players and led by South African Ernie Els.\n\nWoods returns to competition at the Zozo Championship following two months on the sidelines after knee surgery, and has yet to decide whether to include himself as a player in Melbourne.\n\nSince the inception of the Presidents Cup in 1994, the U.S. has lost just once in 12 stagings, with one tie.\n\nDuring the same period, however, the Americans have won only three of 12 Ryder Cups.\n\nLeave it to McIlroy to identify the main reason for such contrasting records.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not playing Europe in the Presidents Cup?\u201d he said, prompting chuckles from the assembled media.\n\nHis point made \u2014 that Europe puts out a better team \u2014 he continued with a lengthier explanation, saying that the Americans were perhaps more relaxed at the Presidents Cup than the pressure-packed Ryder Cup.\n\n\u201cI think for most people, when you are relaxed, that\u2019s what sort of brings the best out of you in terms of freedom of play and just letting it go.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s part of the reason I think why they play so well and they\u2019ve dominated for so long.\u201d\n\nMcIlroy was speaking at Narashino Country Club on the eve of the first official-money PGA Tour event in Japan.\n\nHe will play the first two rounds with Americans Justin Thomas and Xander Schauffele, while Woods will be accompanied by Englishman Tommy Fleetwood and Japan\u2019s Satoshi Kodaira.", "description": "Rory McIlroy has backed Tiger Woods to do an excellent job as either a playing or non-playing captain of the United States team that will take on the Internationals at the Presidents Cup in December.", "authors": ["Andrew Both", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444049019&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M0MP-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
