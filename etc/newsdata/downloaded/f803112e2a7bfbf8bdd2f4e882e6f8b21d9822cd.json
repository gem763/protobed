Later, we pull out even further to the tourists sitting on the boardwalk, overlooking the spine and tail of the now-decapitated fish:\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d [a woman] asked a waiter and pointed to the long backbone of the great fish that was now just garbage waiting to go out with the tide. \u201cTiburon,\u201d the waiter said. \u201cEshark.\u201d He was meaning to explain what had happened. \u201cI didn\u2019t know sharks had such handsome, beautifully formed tails.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t either,\u201d her male companion said. Up the road, in his shack, the old man was sleeping again. He was still sleeping on his face and the boy was sitting by him watching him. The old man was dreaming about the lions.\n\nThe book ends there. From a craft perspective, what strikes me most is the boldness of this kind of perspective shift so late in the game, when your reader has been accustomed to one lens for so long. There\u2019s tremendous risk of creating a distancing effect. And yet somehow Hemingway manages to make the whole thing much more intimate. Because he shows you, in the briefest of maneuvers, the whole scope of how humanity works.\n\nBy the final lines, Santiago\u2019s epic battle is already being misconstrued and misunderstood. And so, as the novella ends, you sense that Santiago\u2019s story doesn\u2019t have much of a future: It\u2019s going to dissolve with the tide; it\u2019s already being carried out to sea. That\u2019s the fate of all life, and the fate of all stories. The truth of what really happened out there in the Gulf Stream belongs only to us, the readers, because we watched the old man\u2019s struggle with his fish.\n\nBut in the end, even our memories don\u2019t seem to matter. We\u2019re left with an image that seems to transcend that epic battle: the lions on the beach, which Santiago dreams of as the story closes. Somehow, these lions he glimpsed as a boy capture the essence of his humanity. They remain, even when everything else has been eroded. Even the life-changing brutality of his experience at sea can\u2019t change that.\n\nBy ending on that image, Hemingway suggests that what matters most is the preservation of a person\u2019s sense of self\u2014which only that person can know in life, and which a reader can know through the intimacy of fiction. To a degree, you get the whole story of the battle with the marlin in order to be able to come back to this image. It\u2019s an utterly inactive moment\u2014Santiago is asleep, after all\u2014and yet it reveals what his soul is all about. The lions are the door into his personhood.\n\nOne of the things that has struck me as I get older is that as more and more information fills your brain, you have less control over what you remember. Your ability to access the things that remind you of you becomes less reliable. It would be wonderful to have complete recall of the moments I think should be most meaningful to me\u2014some great moment in my family, or the instant I met my husband, or some fantastic exchange that I had with another writer. But those memories often fray, leaving only their essence. When people do remember specifics, the sharpest, most luminous details are often strange, or surprising. We all have our lion moments.", "description": "The novelist T\u00e9a Obreht describes how a single surprising image in The Old Man and the Sea sums up the main character's identity.", "authors": ["Joe Fassler"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/08/Obrecht_Thumb2/facebook.jpg?1567103272"}
