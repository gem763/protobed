It also pointed that commitments on intellectual property and currency were \"unspecified.\"Citing an expert, Bloomberg also said the deal hardly resolves the sources of the friction between the two countries.Other major news outlets, including AP, were also rather critical about the trade deal, insisting a lot of issues remain despite the trade truce.The U.S. and China agreed on Friday to the first phase of a trade deal, with China agreeing to buy U.S. agricultural goods worth 40 to 50-billion U.S. dollars and America agreeing not to raise tariffs on some Chinese goods to 30 percent from the current 25 percent.Yoon Jung-min, Arirang News.", "description": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc744 \ub300\ud45c\ud558\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubc29\uc1a1!
