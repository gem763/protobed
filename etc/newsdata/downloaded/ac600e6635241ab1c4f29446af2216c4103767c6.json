About one-third of its workers have temporary protected status. \u201cWe\u2019d struggle to finish some of our jobs because there aren\u2019t workers of this quality out there,\u201d he said.\n\nConstruction appealed to new arrivals from El Salvador because the jobs did not require special skills or knowledge of English, said Abel N\u00fa\u00f1ez, the executive director of Carecen, a social services organization for Latino immigrants. \u201cThe construction industry was booming and these people wanted to work,\u201d he said.\n\nTemporary protected status does not provide a path to citizenship, but most of these workers never thought they would face deportation. They have been in the United States legally, for nearly two decades in many cases. Some have bought homes and cars and have settled into middle-class lives. Many have children who are American citizens.\n\nThere are nearly 46,000 people under the program in Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia, according to the Center for American Progress, a liberal group that opposes the Trump administration\u2019s move. Over all, the Washington area is home to nearly 200,000 Salvadorans, the largest group of foreign-born residents in the region.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d said Alexander Garray, who has temporary protected status and spends his days 120 feet below Washington, boring a huge tunnel for water and sewage that will result in cleaner rivers in the region. \u201cI pay taxes, I\u2019ve never had a problem with the law, and I own a home. I don\u2019t understand why they are trying to kick us out.\u201d", "description": "Tens of thousands of workers in and around the capital were here legally because of adversity in their homeland.
