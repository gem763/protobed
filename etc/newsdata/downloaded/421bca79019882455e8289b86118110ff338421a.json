Really doesn\u2019t look well!'\n\nSomeone echoed this, typing: 'Is Simon Cowell ill? He looks awful - really gaunt, scrawny and unhealthy.'\n\n'Is Simon Cowell ill? He looks absolutely awful,' came someone else's critique.\n\nThe X Factor returned on Saturday after its annual hiatus, but with a revamped format, featuring just celebrity contestants.\n\n'Hope he's okay!' Many found it amusing how much the music mogul, 60, had changed since adopting a healthier lifestyle\n\nThe likes of Megan McKenna, Ricki Lake, Martin Bashir and Ben Foden took to the stage in front of Simon, Nicole Scherzinger and Louis Walsh, as well as a host of Simon's pals from the Hollywood music world, to sing for a place in the live shows.\n\nBut while Simon's appearance shocked many, most have been getting used to his new look, watching him over the past few weeks on Britain's Got Talent: The Champions.\n\nBefore he turned 60 this month, Simon admitted to having a facelift and 'too much Botox.'\n\nWorries: Others expressed concern, branding him 'ill' and 'too gaunt'\n\nPictures taken throughout the years suggest Simon started having Botox injections from 2009 onwards.\n\nLast year, Simon admitted to having the facelift - but didn't say when, and said the procedure 'hurt like hell.'\n\nHe told The Sun that he visited cosmetic surgeon Dr Jean-Louis Sebagh, known as the 'Picasso of dermatology', for a Silhouette Soft Lift.\n\n\u2039 Slide me \u203a What could have been? Dr Alex Karidis believes the picture on the left is an accurate representation of how Simon might look without surgery, explaining that when we lose fat in our faces as we get older, the skin sags\n\nHe underwent a non-surgical 'sewing bioplastic-infused thread' facelift that set him back \u00a32000.\n\nSimon explained: 'For me now, it\u2019s all about having clean skin. If you have clean skin, you look better. But you have to be very careful with some of this stuff.'\n\n'There's lots of things you can do now. You don't just have to stuff your face with filler and Botox.\n\n'It hurts like hell but it gets rid of sun damage and unplugs all the cr*p.'\n\nNatural: Simon was flashing some pearly whites (he has since upgraded them) and a smooth forehead back in the day and is starting to display some natural fine lines around the eyes\n\nSimon once claimed that using Botox 'added 10 years' to his TV career, but that he regrets going overboard with the procedure.\n\nHe said: 'Hopefully I look better now \u2013 I probably did have a little too much Botox a couple of years ago, because everyone on TV has it.\n\n'Now I have facials, but nothing too extravagant at the moment. I have a girl who comes here and does a great face massage \u2013 it's very relaxing.\n\nBotox begins: Simon has admitted to getting Botox injections to smooth out his features, which are mostly noticeable in his cheeks and forehead\n\n'I also had a sheep placenta facial once, which was quite out there.'\n\nSheep placenta facials were all the rage around five years ago and Victoria Beckham also famously took the plunge.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the buzz started in LA, at the swanky Rodeo Drive clinic of dermatologist Dr Harold Lancer - Simon and Victoria are his clients.\n\nSubtle changes: Before he lost weight recently, Simon's face looked plumper, which reduced sagging and the appearance of wrinkles\n\nOuch! Simon previously admitted that he visited cosmetic surgeon Dr Jean-Louis Sebagh, known as the 'Picasso of dermatology', for a Silhouette Soft Lift which costs \u00a32000 around this time\n\nNot moving a muscle: Simon recently admitted he had 'too much Botox' injected into his face, which made his face appear stiff while on television\n\nThe facial costs \u00a3185 for an hour and 15 minutes.\n\nIt combines the sheep-derived lotions and potions with microdermabrasion (which exfoliates the skin and blasts away dead cells).\n\nThere's also a mask and red light therapy (to boost circulation and collagen production).\n\nSlim Jim: Simon appears to have started to lose weight (and apply some tan) and is clearly feeling way more confident\n\nBarely recognisable: Now, having lost weight, Karidis believes Simon's skin has started to sag because he has lost the fat in his face, causing a deflation effect\n\nDr Alex Karidis, Plastic Surgeon at Karidis Clinic, told MailOnline that he believes the aged photo of Simon is an accurate representation of what he would look like.\n\nKaridis said: 'As we get older, gravity takes effect - the skin thins and there is a 'deflation effect' which occurs when we lose fat in our faces and skin starts to sag.\n\n'There is a saying, \"fat don't crack\" and this is why sometimes, carrying a little extra weight can make the face look younger.\n\n'Because Simon has lost 20lbs recently, that weight loss shows in his face. With ageing, the neck starts to sag, as do the brows and the eyelids.'\n\nHe continued: 'Some people opt to have their own fat injected into their face to combat this or a hyaluronic acid which may need to be injected two or three times.'\n\nNo doubt Simon, who has a net worth of more than \u00a3325million, has been keen to slow the ageing process.\n\nIn 2010, Louis Walsh claimed he was forced to undergo plastic surgery by his boss and X Factor sidekick Simon.\n\nLouis said he reluctantly underwent an operation to remove fat from under his eyes after Simon insisted that the procedure was vital.\n\nHe claimed: 'Simon said it was essential because of high-definition TV. The eye thing was all I've had done. There will be no Botox or anything like that.'\n\nLouis also claimed that remarks from Simon led him to have his teeth fixed back in 2009 - but the mogul did at least settle the bill for him.\n\nWHAT THE PLASTIC SURGEON SAYS... Dr Alex Karidis, Plastic Surgeon at Karidis Clinic told MailOnline: 'As we get older, gravity takes hold, the skin thins and we get what is called the deflation effect. 'When we lose fat from our faces, the skin starts to sag, like a deflating balloon and the supporting muscles weaken. 'The neck sags, as do the brows and upper and lower eyelids which can result in a droopy face. There is a truth to the saying, \"fat don't crack\" and having a little extra fat on the face can result in the appearance of fewer wrinkles. 'Because Simon has lost weight recently, his skin has started to droop 'This can be remedied with weight gain, fat injected from other parts of the body or hyaluronic acid'\n\nDr Nyla Raja, leading cosmetic doctor who has treated Simon\u2019s friend Mel B told MailOnline that she believes Simon has been left with a 'drooping face.'\n\n'Men also go through hormonal changes leading to a lack of collagenesis in the skin. Unfortunately when we lose weight the fatty tissue is also depleted from the face, leading one to look more drawn.'\n\nSimon has previously said that he would love to come and see Dr Nyla. 'He\u2019s not got the right people around him saying that\u2019s enough.\n\n'I often refuse clients if they want to go overboard with cosmetic treatments \u2013 I just want clients to look and feel like the best version of themselves in the safest possible way.\n\n'I am determined to provide only the best possible treatments, individual to each client, ensuring they have fantastic results.'\n\nShe continued: My responsibility first and foremost is to my clients health and wellbeing.\n\n'Simon\u2019s fallen face and \"sunken\" eyes are a result of the wrong treatments being advised to him, leading to the facial muscles starting to drop around the eye area.\n\n'I believe Simon should step away from cosmetic treatments for a while and try focusing on non-surgical treatments to lift and tighten the sagging skin.\n\n'I am a huge advocate of using a combination of non-invasive treatments such as ultrasound technology to lift the skin at its deepest level and radiofrequency to tighten the skin.\n\n'To revitalise the entire face I recommend an Intraceuticals Oxygen Facial as it is an effective, non-invasive way to enhance and restore the quality of your skin which may be affected by your lifestyle or as you age \u2013 or in Simon\u2019s case \u2013 too many procedures!\n\n'Intraceutical facials use hyperbaric oxygen to enhance the delivery of serums used in treatments. Oxygen is a natural bacteria which helps keep the skin cool and calm during treatment.'\n\nDr Nyla Raja, (second from right) leading cosmetic doctor who has treated Simon\u2019s friend Mel B told MailOnline that she believes Simon has been left with a 'drooping face'", "description": "X Factor fans tuning into the new season on Saturday were left shocked by how different Simon Cowell is looking these days.", "authors": ["Andrew Bullock For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/10/19650100-0-image-a-4_1570957240450.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
