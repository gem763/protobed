Here's exactly what it's like to sign up.", "language": "en", "text": "As someone who writes about personal finance every day, I'm somewhat embarrassed to admit that I've never had a high-yield cash or savings account. That's because I've been with the same monster mega bank since my teenage days.\n\nFor years, I had serious bank account inertia. I just couldn't bring myself to put in the effort that would be required to open up a new bank account. But I'd been told that the hassle factor really wasn't an excuse any longer and that I could open an account in minutes.\n\nI finally decided that it was time to bite the bullet and find a cash account that would pay me more than 0.01%. And after taking a look at several great options, I decided to go with Wealthfront.\n\nWhy I chose to open a high-yield cash account with Wealthfront\n\nIf you're looking for a high-yield cash or savings account, there are several good choices available. But here is a quick list of the reasons that I chose Wealthfront:\n\nFDIC insured up to $1 million\n\nFee-free\n\n$1 minimum deposit\n\n2.57% interest rate (when I joined in July \u2014 as of September 20 it's 2.07%)\n\nThat amazing interest rate was really the clincher for me, but the other points came into consideration as well.\n\nIt's also important to point out that I didn't need all the bells and whistles of an actual bank. I still have all my online bill pay and ACH debits set to pull from the checking account at the bank I've been with for years. I was just looking for a place to park my emergency fund money and hopefully outpace (or at least keep up with) inflation.\n\nIf you're looking to open both a checking and savings, you may be better off choosing an online bank. But for my situation, Wealthfront seemed like the right fit.\n\nI was relieved to find that the sign-up process with Wealthfront was a breeze. It took me less than 10 minutes from start to finish. Here's how it went.", "description": "I moved my emergency fund savings over to Wealthfront's Cash Account, and the process couldn't have been any easier.", "authors": ["Clint Proctor"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d31f73a48c50a0d694acd54-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
