But on Sunday, she issued a warning statement about the administration withholding the contents of the whistleblower\u2019s complaint.\n\n\u201cIf the Administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the President, they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation,\u201d Pelosi wrote.\n\nPelosi has faced growing pressure from some Democrats in the House and on the 2020 campaign trail who charge that inaction by the Democratic majority effectively amounts to a seal of approval for the President\u2019s misdeeds.\n\n\u201cAt this point, the bigger national scandal isn\u2019t the president\u2019s lawbreaking behavior\u2014it is the Democratic Party\u2019s refusal to impeach him for it,\u201d Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) tweeted on Saturday night.\n\nSimilar sentiments have been expressed by some of the leading candidates for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) who tweeted on Friday: \u201c After the Mueller report, Congress had a duty to begin impeachment. By failing to act, Congress is complicit in Trump\u2019s latest attempt to solicit foreign interference to aid him in US elections. Do your constitutional duty and impeach the president.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, Trump confirmed that he did speak with the foreign leader about Biden and defended his actions as appropriate.\n\n\u201cThe conversation I had was largely congratulatory, with largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don\u2019t want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine,\u201d Trump told reporters.\n\nBiden, for his part, has not outright called for impeachment, but during a campaign stop in Iowa over the weekend, he said that the House should investigate the phone call.\n\n\u201cThis appears to be an overwhelming abuse of power,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWe have never seen anything like this from any president.\u201d", "description": "The calls to proceed are coming from inside the House, and outside it.", "authors": ["Gideon Resnick", "Political Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569183021/190922-resnick-dems-tease_pnfe4c", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
