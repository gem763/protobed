(Jonathan Newton / The Washington Post)\n\nMelvin Gordon wants a new contract from the Los Angeles Chargers. The team said it will not discuss a new deal until after the season.\n\nThe Chargers gave Gordon\u2019s representatives permission to seek a trade. Nothing acceptable has materialized.\n\nWithout Gordon, Los Angeles has relied upon running backs Austin Ekeler and Justin Jackson. Ekeler has scored four times over three games and Jackson has averaged 7.9 yards over his 18 carries.\n\nAnd so, with that lack of leverage staring Gordon in the face, we have Wednesday\u2019s news: Gordon will be reporting to the Chargers earlier than expected, according to NFL Network.\n\nSources: The holdout is ending. #Chargers RB Melvin Gordon is, in fact, reporting to the team tomorrow. He won\u2019t play this week, but he is planning to be back in the fold with his teammates. \u2014 Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) September 25, 2019\n\nThe first report actually surfaced from an unlikely source: Branson Wright, a multimedia journalist with the Cleveland Plain-Dealer who reported on Twitter just after midnight that Gordon will report to the Chargers on Thursday (Wright has developed sources covering visiting locker rooms after Browns games for years, he told the Big Lead).\n\nThe usual NFL-media subjects then more or less confirmed Wright\u2019s reporting, though ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter said \u201cno final decisions have been made\u201d and NFL Network\u2019s Ian Rapoport reported that \u201cno date has been set\u201d and that Gordon\u2019s likely first game will be Oct. 6 against the Broncos, not Sunday\u2019s game against the Dolphins.\n\nESPN\u2019s Josina Anderson, meanwhile, tweeted Wednesday that \u201cthings have changed\u201d with regards to Gordon\u2019s return date and that \u201cthe best way to show [Gordon\u2019s] value is on the field,\u201d though she added that the Chargers aren\u2019t \u201cfully aware\u201d when Gordon will be reporting.\n\nGordon will become an unrestricted free agent in the offseason, but only if he reports to the Chargers by Nov. 29 to accrue a full year of league service. He wants a salary comparable to some of the league\u2019s big-money running backs: Todd Gurley, David Johnson and Le\u2019Veon Bell, who all get in the vicinity of $13 million or $14 million annually. The Chargers have offered him a deal that would pay him $10 million per year.\n\nMore NFL coverage:\n\nThe NFL\u2019s search for the next Sean McVay has created a new role: head coach for the defense\n\nThe Scottish Hammer: How Jamie Gillan went from Scotland to an HBCU to Browns rookie standout\n\nJay Gruden doesn\u2019t think Redskins\u2019 season is over, so Dwayne Haskins will continue to wait\n\n\u2018Unlike Agholor,\u2019 Philadelphia residents catch babies thrown from burning building", "description": "The Chargers seemed to be doing okay without him, which isn't an ideal path toward a new contract.", "authors": ["Matt Bonesteel", "Reporter For The Early Lead", "September At Pm", "Matt Bonesteel Spent The First Years Of His Washington Post Career Writing", "Editing.
