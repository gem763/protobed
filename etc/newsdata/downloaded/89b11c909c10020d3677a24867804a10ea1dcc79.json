The index measures the likelihood that President Trump\u2019s tweets have moved the bond markets. In building the index, the bank found Trump\u2019s tweets have become increasingly likely to move the market in recent months, and that they have especially tended to do so when they have been about China, trade, monetary policy, or the Mueller investigation.\n\nAn obvious question about a research note like this is: Why did they publish it? Investment bank research desks are not in the \u201cfun facts\u201d business, much as those of us who sort of are in the fun facts business might like them to be. They also don\u2019t tend to want to put out documents that might look like political commentary. How is a JP Morgan client supposed to take this information about the Volfefe index and use it to make money?\n\nThe answer has to do with swaptions, or options to enter into interest rate swaps. Swaps are financial products where the buyer agrees to pay a fixed interest rate and receive a floating one, or vice versa, over a given time period. A swaption gives you the option to enter into a swap on specific terms at a time in the future, or not: You get to decide, based on how interest rates have moved since you bought the swaption.\n\nSwaps and swaptions allow market participants to manage interest rate risks: For example, if you are a bank that has made a lot of fixed-rate loans and but pays interest to depositors at a floating rate, you might use swaps to convert some of your fixed-rate loan exposure to a floating rate. And the way swaptions are priced depends in part on market expectations about how much interest rates might move around between the time you buy the swaption and the time when you can exercise it.\n\nThe JP Morgan analysts looked at a measure called \u201cimplied volatility,\u201d which is derived from swaption prices and reflects how much market participants expect interest rates to move around. This measure has gone up a lot lately, especially for soon-to-expire swaptions tied to short-duration swaps. Essentially, swaptions are becoming more expensive because market participants think interest rates, especially short-term interest rates, are more likely to move around enough such that people who buy swaptions will want to exercise them.\n\nA question one might ask is whether this increase in implied volatility \u2014 which, to be clear, is a measure market expectations of volatility, not a measure of actual volatility \u2014 is warranted given current market conditions. JP Morgan has a model that it uses to estimate what implied volatility associated with a given swaption ought to be given certain observable facts about the markets and other conditions. The trouble is, this model has not historically included a parameter about the president\u2019s tweeting, which may now be a relevant input.\n\nAnd so this is why JP Morgan analyzed that database of Trump\u2019s tweets, looking to see how often they were immediately followed by material interest rate movements and what characteristics those apparently market-moving tweets tended to share.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note, this model is not extremely precise: JPM categorized 146 Trump tweets since the start of 2018 as market-moving, but they say 30 or more of those are likely false positives, which are tweets that just randomly happened to occur ahead of a change in interest rates. On a prospective basis, the model is only able to pick out a market-moving tweet on the basis of its content one time out of three. That\u2019s all okay because the important thing is not what the model says about any given tweet, but what it says about them in the aggregate: By looking at all the tweets together, JP Morgan can say with specificity that the president\u2019s tweets have been getting more and more likely to move the market, even if it can\u2019t identify which specific ones are the culprits.\n\nAnd the index that results from this measure, the Volfefe Index, can be plugged into JP Morgan\u2019s valuation model for swaptions. What they find is that the increase in implied volatility reflected in swaption prices does appear to be justified by actual increases in market volatility being caused by the president\u2019s Twitter behavior, at least as regards swaptions that are tied to near-term moves in short-term interest rates. That is: These financial products are becoming more expensive because the president\u2019s tweets are causing a real increase in interest-rate volatility.\n\nAround a decade ago, you heard a lot about the problem of \u201cpolicy uncertainty.\u201d The claim was that financial markets and the economy were being dragged down by an uncertain policy environment. Investors didn\u2019t know how much they would be taxed or what sort of regulations the government would impose, so they were reluctant to make risky investments.\n\nUsually, this is just a talking point people use when they dislike a policy proposal that is under consideration. But uncertainty can impose real costs. And the Volfefe Index is clever and useful because it has isolated a real effect of policy uncertainty: We can see, in real time, the president making a financial product more expensive, though his public commentary that markets interpret as making public policies that affect interest rates less certain.\n\nIf these effects were limited to the swaption prices JP Morgan can measure, they wouldn\u2019t be so important. But obviously, swaptions aren\u2019t the only product whose cost is affected by increased interest rate volatility. People whose businesses depend on the cost of borrowing or lending in the future \u2014 bankers and real estate developers, to take two examples \u2014 face more risk when the interest rate environment is more volatile, and will find it more difficult to make investments.
