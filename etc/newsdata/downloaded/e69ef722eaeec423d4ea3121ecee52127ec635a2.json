But it highlights the implications of a field still stacked with a handful of highly organized, well-funded candidates \u2014 and a race that remains unsettled in ways that could prevent any one candidate from seizing insurmountable momentum from the first four nominating states.\n\nSaturday marked 100 days until the Iowa caucuses, and still three candidates \u2014 Biden, Warren and Sanders \u2014 are polling above 15 percent in national surveys. Buttigieg, meanwhile, hit 10 percent in the latest Quinnipiac Poll \u2014 and 13 percent in Iowa, according to a Suffolk University/USA Today poll. And Amy Klobuchar, who is suddenly drawing new interest, on Thursday became the ninth candidate to qualify for the November debate.\n\nJames Zogby, a Democratic National Committee member and longtime president of the Arab American Institute, a Washington think tank, said, \u201cI don\u2019t see anyone emerging early or late with 50 [percent] plus.\u201d\n\nHe said of the convention, \u201cI think it will be [contested].\u201d\n\nPolls show former Vice President Joe Biden is trouncing his competitors in South Carolina. | Sean Rayford/Getty Images\n\nConventions are contested far less frequently than the quadrennial ventilations about them would suggest. But the Democratic primary field this year is historically large, and the race is unsettled in ways that could diffuse momentum any one candidate might gain from an early state victory.\n\nWarren eclipsed Biden in some polls in Iowa and has an advantage in New Hampshire, while Biden is trouncing his competitors in South Carolina. Buttigieg\u2019s prodigious fundraising is allowing him to make a late push in Iowa. Nevada remains wide open, and Sanders\u2019 competitors believe he has a floor of 15 percent \u2014 enough to secure delegates \u2014 in nearly every state.\n\nEven the two-person contest in 2016 between Sanders and Hillary Clinton was not called until June, and the conclusion of that race was aided by early superdelegate commitments to Clinton \u2014 the endorsements from members of Congress, DNC members and other top party officials who made up about 15 percent of delegates to the national convention that year.\n\nIn 2016, the effort to sign on party leaders was a major feature of Clinton\u2019s early campaign, in which she pressed superdelegates to pledge support to her \u2014 and announced support from hundreds of superdelegates \u2014 as early as summer 2015. By November of the year before the election, the Associated Press was tabulating that Clinton had secured more than 350 pledges of support from superdelegates, a number that carried into the primaries and colored news coverage the race.\n\nThis year, superdelegates have been relegated to a backwater. The Democratic National Committee elected to strip superdelegates of much of their power, but just as important, the idea of influential party insiders playing a significant role in the nomination carries a negative connotation among the grassroots . And with Biden and several senators running, many superdelegates have been more hesitant this year to commit.\n\nIf the nomination is contested at the convention, their ballots could become critical. Superdelegates are allowed to vote on the second ballot at a contested national convention.\n\nBiden, the former vice president, appears to carry the most establishment support, leading in endorsements among governors and members of Congress. But the differences between candidates' high profile endorsements are measured this year not in hundreds, but in dozens or fewer. And superdelegates can freely switch their allegiances.\n\nWilliam Owen, a Democratic National Committee member and Biden supporter from Tennessee, said he fears that if the nomination remains unsettled by the time of the national convention, \u201cwe will look like a dystopian Hunger Games auction,\u201d with delegates trading support for appointments and other political favors.\n\nOwen said the current primary \u201cwould certainly lend itself to not having a clear nominee by June of next year.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt just looks to me like relatively stable polling,\u201d he said, adding that in addition to Biden and Warren, \u201cMayor Pete is picking up some speed \u2026 and now Bernie\u2019s back and he has plenty of money.\u201d\n\nOwen said he urged Biden\u2019s advisers this summer to begin developing a second-ballot strategy for the convention. But while most major candidates have said they are cognizant of or are tracking superdelegates, the effort is nowhere near as prominent as it was in 2016.\n\nZogby, a Sanders supporter, said, \u201cWe will at some point start talking to people, but it isn\u2019t happening now.\u201d\n\nEd Rendell, a former Pennsylvania governor and one of Biden\u2019s most vocal supporters, said he can run through any number of scenarios in which Biden, Sanders or Warren could reach 50 percent before the convention.\n\nHowever, he said, \u201cIf you\u2019re operating under the theory that Buttigieg could really become a factor, then there\u2019s no chance \u2014 with four of them drawing significant number of delegates \u2014 there\u2019d be no chance that there wouldn\u2019t be a brokered convention.\u201d\n\nA plausible scenario, the former chairman of the Democratic National Committee said, is three or more candidates \u201csplitting up the first 20 states or so, which means it\u2019s going to be hard for any one of them to have 50 percent.\u201d\n\nEven lower tier candidates may upset the math, with proportional allocation of delegates in large Super Tuesday states encouraging some candidates to remain in the contest. Harris could win delegates in California that day, even if she does not carry the state. And former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign has repeatedly pointed to his prospects in his home state of Texas, despite his weak national polling and the fact he has yet to qualify for the November debate.\n\nMayor Pete Buttigieg\u2019s prodigious fundraising is allowing him to make a late push in Iowa. | Sean Rayford/Getty Images\n\nOne DNC member who declined to be identified said that if the early states become a \u201chodgepodge\u201d with different winners, \u201cIf I were one of those candidates, I would stay until the very end. If you\u2019ve won one, and it doesn\u2019t look decisive, why get out?\u201d\n\nJeff Cohen, co-founder of RootsAction.org, an online activist group that supports Sanders, said he has been speaking with other progressives about the possibility that Warren or Sanders enters the convention ahead of \u201ca more corporate candidate\u201d such as Biden \u201cand the superdelegates go behind the corporate-oriented candidate who is in second place.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it could stand,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s likely that no one candidate will get 50 percent pre-convention,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cBut I think it is likely that Bernie and Warren together will be over 50 percent, and that\u2019s the goal of many progressive Democrats.\u201d\n\nThe uncertainty surrounding the primary \u2014 and the various flaws of all of its candidates \u2014 has resulted in a sense of uneasiness throughout the party in recent weeks. Intraparty sniping can wound a nominee, and an elongated contest would delay Democrats\u2019 ability to turn resources to the general election.\n\nBut Kelly Dietrich, founder of the National Democratic Training Committee, which trains candidates across the country, said a longer primary could also prevent Republicans \u201cfrom trying to pigeonhole or define the opponent early.\u201d\n\nHe suggested an extended primary, meanwhile, could bolster Democratic engagement in later-voting states, and he said it is a \u201cdistinct possibility that we have three or even four different winners in the first four primary states.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think chances are it\u2019s going to be a long primary,\u201d Dietrich said.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/5a/8e/aa48009c494688590fd2f6131715/20191027-warren-campaigns-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
