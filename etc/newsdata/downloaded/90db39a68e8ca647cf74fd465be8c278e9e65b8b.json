Even if some won\u2019t accept it | Elizabeth Nelson", "language": "en", "text": "In 2013, Sarah Ewart received a heartbreaking fatal foetal abnormality diagnosis for her much-wanted pregnancy. Faced with the prospect of a baby who might die during gestation or shortly after birth, she felt she couldn\u2019t continue with the pregnancy. But in Northern Ireland abortion is illegal unless the mother\u2019s health or life is at risk, so Sarah travelled to England for a termination.\n\nIt was a journey she should never have had to make.\n\nNorthern Ireland abortion law ruled to breach human rights Read more\n\nFinally, the court has agreed. The high court in Belfast today found that Northern Ireland\u2019s strict abortion laws contravene human rights in the case of fatal foetal abnormality. The judgment is nothing short of a stunning victory for reproductive rights campaigners.\n\nFor Sarah Ewart and thousands like her who have travelled away from their homes and loved ones to access basic healthcare, encountering stigma where there should have been empathy, it is finally a semblance of justice. A victory, she said outside the courthouse this morning, not just for her, but for all women.\n\nThat she had to take a case to the high court \u2013 twice \u2013 to demand her basic human rights in a drawn-out and traumatising legal process is a damning indictment of the state of reproductive rights in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe judgment comes as the tide is changing for abortion in the country. Through the determination of abortion activists, decriminalisation is now on the horizon. It is not yet guaranteed, something that the court acknowledged, saying it would review today\u2019s decision not to issue a formal declaration of incompatibility until after 21 October, when the legislation decriminalising abortion is set to take effect in the absence of a functioning Stormont executive.\n\nBut the backlash against decriminalisation has already begun. The DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in are facing pressure from anti-abortion factions to reconvene negotiations that could lead to the restoration of Stormont before 21 October: if the Northern Ireland assembly returns by then, it would effectively scupper the decriminalisation legislation coming from Westminster. Abortion rights and equal marriage would then go back to the starting block in Stormont, their progress dependent on a new and unpredictable political process. This is what abortion opponents want. They are willing to sacrifice all other principles solely to defeat abortion (equal marriage is rarely mentioned in public, though surely discussed in the DUP backrooms).\n\nSome healthcare workers in the north have also declared their alarm at potentially being required to carry out abortions. In Belfast city council, Sinn F\u00e9in councillors voted with the DUP against a Green party motion welcoming the forthcoming decriminalisation and equal marriage \u2013 something Sinn F\u00e9in ostensibly supports \u2013 apparently bowing to anti-choice pressure. In London, meanwhile, MP Stella Creasy, instrumental in the passage of decriminalisation legislation, has been the victim of vile abuse, arguably levelled at her not only for her role but because she is also pregnant.\n\nIt is worth remembering, in this fraught atmosphere, that backlash against abortion isn\u2019t really about abortion at all \u2013 whether it\u2019s in Northern Ireland, Argentina, Poland or the United States , it\u2019s about control over women\u2019s bodies and lives, and who gets to exercise that control.\n\nThe value they place on life starts and ends in utero \u2013 confining women to traditional gender roles and controlling their ability to participate in society. If it was only about abortion and not control, church leaders and other groups now coming out of the woodwork with their distress and concern would logically have taken a stand for \u201clife\u201d during the introduction of universal credit and the rape clause. If it was about abortion and not control, they would have been calling for free universal childcare and affordable housing for all \u2013 things that would make a marked positive impact on women and marginalised communities\u2019 lives \u2013 among other progressive causes that feminists have long campaigned for in tandem with abortion rights. That these groups have chosen this moment to pressure the DUP to return to Stormont negotiations \u201cwithout red lines\u201d reveals what their \u201cconcern\u201d is really about: they have seen Northern Ireland go without a government for two and a half years \u2013 and all the problems that has entailed \u2013 but only now, with abortion legislation on the horizon, do they push for the assembly\u2019s restoration.\n\nReproductive justice cedes to women territory that has always belonged to men: that of bodily autonomy. Were women truly free to exercise control over their own bodies and therefore their own lives, they would be unstoppable. It is the definition of liberation. Without reproductive justice, without access to abortion, women and other oppressed communities are pushed into poverty, farther into the margins of society, until it is acceptable for \u201cconcerned\u201d citizens to ignore the cruelty of austerity politics and its horrific consequences \u2013 while demanding deference to their beliefs on \u201clife\u201d when it comes to abortion.\n\nFocusing on abortion also allows anti-choice politicians and activists to pass judgment on pregnant people. Their intention is to isolate abortion-seekers by stigmatising them, driving a wedge between them and their communities, and between abortion and other progressive causes. In Northern Ireland\u2019s current political situation, this means pitting reproductive rights activists against Irish-language activists \u2013 the status of the latter being part of what brought down the Stormont government in 2017. It is a losing strategy. Progressive activists in Northern Ireland have long known that their liberation comes together or not at all. Efforts by the DUP to force Sinn F\u00e9in back into negotiations to save face with their grassroots over abortion, or by anti-choice elements within Sinn F\u00e9in to force the party to return to power-sharing if it means stopping abortion and thereby winning an Irish Language Act, will be watched closely by progressive activists of all stripes.\n\nFor now, bolstered by the power and strength of women such as Sarah Ewart, we will celebrate this judgment as a victory for reproductive justice. Women, trans and non-binary people are staking a claim to our autonomy. The backlash by some people is because we are winning.\n\n\u2022 Elizabeth Nelson is a writer and activist with the Belfast Feminist Network", "description": "Despite a backlash, Sarah Ewart\u2019s high court victory shows pro-choice advocates are winning, says Elizabeth Nelson, an activist with the Belfast Feminist Network", "authors": ["Elizabeth Nelson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65c774420b159c99242c355fe310a3507e0f8358/0_141_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=be0f0ae3ae6c4370708445c5c40cb451"}
