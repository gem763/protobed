EnergyAustralia chairman Graham Bradley said last year, after the federal government $6 billion buyout of state governments from Snowy, that the utility should sell its disruptive retailing arms.\n\nMr Dimery said his own view on Snowy had altered in the past 12 months because of the changes in the competitive landscape caused by the introduction of default market offers, which have cut expensive standing offers but also had the effect of winding back the most competitive offers at the \"pointy end\" of the market.\n\nHe said those changes, which have slowed Alinta's customer growth rate by two-thirds, pointed to a period of consolidation between retailers as smaller competitors got driven out of the market. Others such as Alinta looked to acquisitions to cut costs through scale and properly compete with the Big Three: AGL Energy, Origin Energy and EnergyAustralia.\n\n\"I wouldn't have been having this conversation 12 months ago \u2026 but these regulatory changes have changed the competitive landscape,\" Mr Dimery told The Australian Financial Review.\n\nWhat I am asking for is consistent with what the government itself has been calling out for. \u2014 Jeff Dimery, Alinta Energy CEO\n\n\"We think that if you want to drive an even more efficient outcome there is going to have to be some form of consolidation take place in the marketplace, and there should be great transparency as we drive energy charges down as to how that is achieved, especially when government ownership is involved.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWary reception in Canberra\n\nMr Dimery said he had put his views across in talks with \"relevant ministers\" in Canberra, likely to be Treasurer Josh Frydenberg and Energy Minister Angus Taylor. He said he recognised if the government pursued a sale of Snowy's retail businesses it would need to be through a full competitive process.\n\nMr Dimery signalled the reception had been wary: \"They didn't tell us to go away; I didn't get a hug at the end of the meeting either, or told I had provided them with a solution.\n\n\"But if they were able to sell the retail business, that would help fund the capacity expansion of the physical supply, which I would have thought was the main driver.\"\n\nAsked whether the government could consider a break-up of Snowy, a spokesman said Snowy Hydro's commercial operations were \"run at arm's length\" from the government.\n\n\"We are working closely with Snowy to ensure that the substantial positive price outcomes of Snowy 2.0 are realised for all consumers,\" he said.\n\nThe comments came as Snowy Hydro chief executive Paul Broad was forced to defend the business case for Snowy 2.0 and its environmental credentials in a Senate estimates hearing on Monday after a critical report last week from the National Parks Association.\n\nMr Dimery said he believed the sale of Red and Lumo would be consistent with what the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has called for regarding competition in electricity supply.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"What I am asking for is consistent with what the government itself has been calling out for and what the ACCC has highlighted as a desirable outcome in the marketplace,\" he said. Snowy acquired Lumo in a $605 million deal in late 2014.\n\nMr Dimery said while he understood the government's desire to shore up security of supply through the Snowy 2.0 pumped hydro project, it should step back from the competitive retailing sector.\n\n\"We'd just like to keep it at the forefront of [the government's] mind and on their agenda,\" he said.\n\n\"We think it would be a pro-consumer outcome if we were to head down that path.\"", "description": "Alinta's Jeff Dimery has urged the federal government to sell Snowy Hydro's retail businesses as it eyes acquisitions to compete against the \"Big 3\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_526%2C$y_245/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/f0c0d9afc7cbc7295082f977c5ea847508becc50", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
