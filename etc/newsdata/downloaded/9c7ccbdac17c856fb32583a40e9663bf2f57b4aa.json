Previously, the South Bend, Indiana Mayor shied away from such comparisons.\n\n\u201cAs a policy, it\u2019s had mixed results,\u201d said Buttigieg during an October 2 interview. \u201cIt\u2019s a healthy debate to have, but we\u2019ve got to do something now.\u201d\n\nRelated Video: Buttigieg Explains Why He\u2019s Against Medicare For All\n\nO\u2019Rourke subsequently condemned Buttigieg\u2019s comments, saying Buttigieg was \u201cafraid of doing the right thing\u201d by supporting mandatory buybacks.\n\n\u201c[O\u2019Rourke] needs to pick a fight in order to stay relevant,\u201d Buttigieg commented on Good Luck America.\n\nO\u2019Rourke has previously pushed the issue of mandatory gun buybacks and outright confiscation, declaring at the third Democratic primary debate in September that he supports taking away certain semi-automatic rifles from their legal owners.\n\n\u201cHell, yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47. We\u2019re not going to allow it to be used against a fellow American anymore,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said at the time.\n\nButtigieg is currently polling at five percent while O\u2019Rourke stands at just 1.8 percent. The former Texas congressman has struggled to gain more than two percent of the vote, but has captured attention for radical policy proposals on gun rights and issues of church and state.\n\nDuring a CNN Townhall on October 11, O\u2019Rourke called for institutions that don\u2019t support same sex marriage, such as churches, religious schools and charities, to be stripped of their tax-exempt status.\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "Senator Cory Booker (D., N.J.) admonished fellow presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg on Monday for referring to a mandatory gun buyback proposal as \"confiscation\" on the grounds that doing so propagates a right-wing talking point.\"Calling buyback programs 'confiscation' is doing", "authors": ["Zachary Evans"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/b.Kq7N_GNPRbtr9hXVoB5g--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://i0.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/democrat-debate-houston-28-booker.jpg?fit=1024%2C597&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
