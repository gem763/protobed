Students didn't really cause us any problems,' Andrew Waller, who has lived in Redland for 13 years told the Guardian.\n\n'But for some reason in 2013 there was a rash of noisy parties, and that was when I realised there was a problem. Now we get some very large, very loud parties, and they represent the worst extremes.'\n\nUp until 2002, Bristol was a relatively small university compared to the likes of Manchester or Cardiff, with only 10,000 full-time undergraduates.\n\nBut by 2012 number had increased to 14,000 and for the start of the current academic year had welcomed over 26,000 students (including 6,000 postgraduates).\n\nThe university have not been able to increase resident hall sizes in line with increased student numbers, so more students who have finished first year are having to staying in private housing (stock photo)\n\nThe university have not been able to increase resident hall sizes in line with increased student numbers, so more students who have finished first year are having to staying in private housing.\n\nOn one weekend last year Waller said that he watched over 150 people enter a party at a semi-detached house near his home.\n\n'These are not spontaneous events, they are planned. In some cases the students hire an events company to set up big speakers in their living room, things that would normally be on a stage, and have bouncers and doormen,' he added.\n\nWaller have now started a website, the Noise Pages, for local residents to report the worst cases, while local community leaders and councillors have been lobbying the university to take more action.\n\nOperation Beech was first trialled at the end of the last academic year, and the university decided to go ahead with 40 nights of patrols spread across peak party periods during the academic year.\n\nProf Sarah Purdy, Bristol University's pro-vice-chancellor for student experience said: 'The university takes very seriously its responsibility to be a good neighbour and manage the impact of our students on the community.'\n\nOperation Beech received about 230 complaints in the last academic year, slightly fewer than in 2017-18.", "description": "Bristol University has paid Avon and Somerset police \u00a325,000 to run Operation Beech, which makes patrols of residential neighbourhoods around the central campus until 2am.", "authors": ["William Cole For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/11/19919064-0-image-a-11_1571481754161.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
