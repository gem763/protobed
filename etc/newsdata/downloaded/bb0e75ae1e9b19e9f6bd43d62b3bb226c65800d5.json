Democrats have claimed that the call revealed a quid pro quo in which Trump tied the request to nearly $400 million in frozen military money.\n\nTrump has resisted Democratic attempts to produce documents and administration witnesses for the impeachment inquiry. The subpoena seems likely to escalate the clash between the two branches of government. The president said he would formally object to the impeachment investigation, even while acknowledging that House Democrats \"have the votes\" to proceed.\n\nThe White House was expected to send a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., as early as Monday arguing that Congress could not mount its impeachment inquiry without first having a vote to authorize it. The letter was expected to say the administration wouldn't cooperate with the probe without that vote. Pelosi has said such a vote is unnecessary, claiming the House is well within its rules to pursue the inquiry without it.\n\n\"The existing rules of the House provide House Committees with full authority to conduct investigations for all matters under their jurisdiction, including impeachment investigations,\" Pelosi wrote Thursday in a letter to House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., after he, too, pressed for a floor vote.\n\nPelosi has sought to avoid a vote on the impeachment probe for the same reason she resisted, for months, liberal calls to try to remove the president: It would force moderate House Democrats to make a politically risky vote.\n\nEX-ENVOY TESTIFIED UKRAINE NEVER RAISED QUID PRO QUO CONCERNS WITH HIM: SOURCE\n\nCummings had threatened the subpoena Wednesday after the White House ignored two letters in September seeking the documents. In Friday's letter, the chairmen warned the White House that \"Speaker Pelosi has confirmed that an impeachment inquiry is underway, and it is not for the White House to say otherwise.\"\n\nThe letter added that the White House's \"failure or refusal to comply with the subpoena ... shall constitute evidence of obstruction of the House's impeachment inquiry and may be used as an adverse inference against you [Mulvaney] and the President.\n\nEarlier Friday, House Democrats sent a letter requesting documents from Vice President Mike Pence as part of the impeachment inquiry by Oct. 15.\n\nFox News' Adam Shaw and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "The House Oversight Committee subpoenaed the White House late Friday, with the Democratic chairmen of three House committees saying that President Trump \"has chosen the path of defiance, obstruction, and cover-up\" in response to the ongoing impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Samuel Chamberlain"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/12/09_AP18356474534687.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
