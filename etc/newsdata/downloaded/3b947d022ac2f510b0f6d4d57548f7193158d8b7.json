I didn't make them pregnant.\"\n\nRead more: Stacey Solomon felt like she'd 'failed' after struggling to breastfeed son Rex\n\nSome ITV viewers weren't happy with McGiffin's words and shared their frustrations on Twitter.\n\nOh my god I could swing for Carol. \u201cPregnant women are pregnant not ill\u201d. Boils my blood when people say this, especially as I\u2019m 20 weeks in to a difficult pregnancy and still throwing up all day every day. Pregnancy is definitely not a walk in the park \ud83d\ude21 #LooseWomen \u2014 Nikki (@DisDream84) October 25, 2019\n\n\u2018Pregnant people are not ill\u2019 - correct! But they do go through a lot of anatomical and physiological changes that put them at risk of collapses. I believe pregnant women should be offered a seat on a train or bus, if they fell over and injuries could occur. #LooseWomen \u2014 Rebecca Cartledge (@BekkiCartledge) October 25, 2019\n\nHowever, others voiced support for the presenter, suggesting that people were entitled to stay in a seat if they had gone to the effort of reserving one.\n\nWhat a stupid debate. If you've reserved a seat, it's yours. You RESERVED it. Case closed. It doesn't matter if you're pregnant or elderly. #loosewomen \u2014 Dave (@DavidMackayy) October 25, 2019\n\nI'm with Carol here! I pay for and reserve my seat because even though it may look it...I'm not able to stand...so if you need a seat do the same! #LooseWomen \u2014 Carl Johnson (@carljtweets) October 25, 2019\n\nThe Loose Women debate comes after a mother used Twitter to criticise an elderly couple who were sitting in train seats she had reserved for her children.\n\nAmanda Mancino-Williams described how she had booked seats on the train traveling from Cheltenham to Nottingham but found an elderly couple sitting in two of them who she claims did not move when she asked them to.\n\nShe shared a photo of her three children sharing two seats opposite the couple, before sharing that the conductor offered the family seats in first class at a spare table.\n\nThe Loose Women team discussed who should be a priority when it comes to sitting down on public transport. (ITV) More\n\nOn the story, McGiffin opined: \"They should have reserved their own. I am sorry but it would never happen on a plane.\n\n\"There must have been other seats on that train for them to sit.\"\n\nShe also told her colleagues she's had \"big fights\" in the past after reserving a train seat only to find someone sitting in it.", "description": "The presenter said \"it's not her fault\" and that she \"didn't make them pregnant\".", "authors": ["Amy Johnson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ZqwK7yxfBDErTRYq.jRWvA--~B/aD00OTI7dz04ODE7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/c17b75b0-f732-11e9-bfee-8f92e303381e", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
