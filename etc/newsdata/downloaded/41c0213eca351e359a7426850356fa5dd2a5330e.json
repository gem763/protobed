A haka is a Maori war dance. It is typically performed during funerals, weddings and sports matches. The All Blacks haka is arguably the most famous. They perform two hakas- Ka Mate and Kapa o Pango. Kapa o Pango was composed by Derek Lardelli for exclusive use of the All Blacks in 2005.\n\n'When an Irish shock jock column writer wants the haka banned it's blarney, akin to Kiwis telling the Irish there's too much Guinness in the world,' he wrote.\n\nThe haka has been a point of contention during the Rugby World Cup this year.\n\nEngland players revealed afterwards that the V-shape was the idea of their coach Eddie Jones, with Mako Vunipola admitting afterwards that 'we knew it would rile them up.'\n\nCaptain Farrell was pictured smirking while the dance was performed, with New Zealand scrum-half Aaron Smith saying afterwards that Farrell winked at him.\n\nThe amount of the fine was not revealed but in 2011, France were docked $3,200 after they formed an arrowhead shape and marched towards the haka before the World Cup final in Auckland.\n\nSeveral England players spilled over into the New Zealand half and were told to step back\n\nFrance were fined \u00a32,500 for forming a V-shape and advancing on the haka in the 2011 final\n\nBefore England made waves with their V-formation Irish fans caused a stir during with their own pre-game shenanigans.\n\nAs the All Blacks began their ceremonial war cry, Irish fans were heard blaring the lyrics to folk ballad The Fields Of Athenry.\n\nAccording to World Rugby rules, teams must stand at least 10 metres apart during the Haka performance. However, this was introduced as a safeguard after several attempts to unnerve the All Blacks in years gone by.", "description": "Calls have been mounting for the All Blacks' haka to be banned after England were fined for their\u00a0unorthodox formation during the World Cup.", "authors": ["Kelsey Wilkie For Daily Mail Australia", "Chris Foy For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/03/20211566-0-image-a-5_1572405710755.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
