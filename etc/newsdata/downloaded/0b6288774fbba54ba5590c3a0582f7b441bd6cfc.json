It\u2019s been this way for years, and we need to get real about why. Either men are more talented, harder working, and more ambitious than women\u2014or something unfair is happening.\n\nFive years of data from 590 companies employing more than 22 million people gives us the answer: Women aren\u2019t getting a fair shot. There are things companies can do right now to change this.\n\nThe 2019 Women in the Workplace report by LeanIn.Org and McKinsey & Co. identifies the step on the corporate ladder that has the greatest impact on women\u2019s advancement: the first step up to manager. Right now, it\u2019s broken. For every 100 men promoted up to manager, only 72 women are. These are all workers at the entry level\u2014they haven\u2019t built long track records, they all have similar work experience, and they were all good enough to be hired in the first place. There\u2019s no good reason why so many more men than women are being tapped for promotions, only a bad one\u2014bias. Largely because of this, men hold 62% percent of manager jobs; women, just 38%. From that point on, it\u2019s impossible for women to climb fast enough to catch up.\n\nClosing the gender gap is critical for companies: No business in the world can succeed without hiring and promoting good employees, and when the numbers are this lopsided, many talented women are being overlooked. It\u2019s critical for the country: If women participated in the U.S. workforce at the same rate as men, it would add $4.3 trillion to the American economy by 2025 and give millions of families more financial security.\n\nIt\u2019s also a matter of fairness. Despite doing everything \u201cright\u201d\u2014getting degrees, competing for promotions, and staying in the workforce at rates similar to men\u2014women don\u2019t have the same opportunities as men. Many women, especially black women and women with disabilities, face more barriers and get less support. It\u2019s simply not right.\n\nAnd employees care deeply about fairness. In this year\u2019s survey, workers say that fairness and opportunity together are the most important factors in whether they\u2019re satisfied at work. When they believe that they have an equal chance to advance\u2014and that their fellow employees do too\u2014they\u2019re happier, plan to stay longer at their company and are more likely to recommend working there to others. This is true across genders, races and ethnicities. Whether you\u2019re a white man or a black woman, you care about fairness\u2014not just for yourself but for your co-workers.\n\nRachel Thomas, president of Lean In Photo: Lean In\n\nCompanies should do everything they can to make their workplaces more fair\u2014starting with putting best practices in place to get bias out of hiring and promotions. For example, use diversity targets; it\u2019s hard to reach a goal you don\u2019t set. Make it a rule to assemble a diverse slate of qualified candidates for every open position; no more choosing between a couple of men every time. Require unconscious-bias training for all evaluators. And establish clear and specific criteria before employee reviews so it is less likely that reviewers will make decisions based on subjective feelings. (You can learn more about these and other ways to reduce bias from Lean In\u2019s 50 Ways to Fight Bias program.) Of the 323 companies that responded in this year\u2019s study about how they handle hiring, promotions and reviews, only six are using all these best practices. What a difference it would make if it were 323 out of 323!\n\nEfforts to hire more women or other underrepresented groups are sometimes seen as benefiting them at others\u2019 expense. But reducing bias isn\u2019t a zero-sum game. When a workplace is fair, everyone knows that if they do good work, they\u2019ll be recognized for it. If they compete for a promotion, they\u2019ll get a real shot at it. Done right, diversity isn\u2019t about rigging the system so a new group gets an unfair advantage while others get penalized. It\u2019s about making things truly fair for everyone.\n\nIf companies make that their focus, employees will trust that their workplaces are fair and opportunities there are equal. And the gender gap will narrow\u2014and maybe even close completely. When you take bias out of the equation, women will finally get the equal chance they\u2019ve always deserved. Everyone will.\n\nMs. Sandberg is Facebook Inc.\u2019s chief operating officer and the founder of LeanIn.Org.
