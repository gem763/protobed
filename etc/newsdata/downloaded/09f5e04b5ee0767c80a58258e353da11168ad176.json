But Big Tex, nearly 14ft long and weighing 1,000lbs, was gone.\n\n\u201cWe were unsure he had even escaped,\u201d Jon Warner, alligator program leader for the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, told the Washington Post. \u201cBut when the water level went down, Big Tex wasn\u2019t there.\u201d\n\nGator Country founder Gary Saurage told the Beaumont Enterprise Tex would be found, as after all: \u201cYou can\u2019t miss an alligator that big.\u201d\n\nAnd on Friday, once the waters had receded, Big Tex was duly located, near a pond on the Gator Country property. A number of his smaller friends, however, were still missing.\n\nWarner said the escapees were \u201cmostly just three-, four- and five-footers\u201d which \u201cprobably just swam over the fence\u201d.\n\nSpeaking to the Enterprise, he said the animals were \u201chighly acclimated to people and are generally hand fed\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey are not wild and will not terrorize people,\u201d he said.\n\nChris Nocera (@13ProducerChris) 9 foot #gator pulled from home in Humble.

In 2017, under Hurricane Harvey, around 50 alligators swam away from the sanctuary.\n\nA 9ft gator was subsequently removed from a flooded home. Many more joined members of a thriving if temporarily displaced wild population in a ditch by a highway, and were safely rounded up.\n\nIn a public advisory, Warner said: \u201cAlligators are wary of people but keep your distance. Never approach, harass or feed an alligator. When water levels recede, the alligator will likely disappear as well.\u201d", "description": "Alligator found near a pond on the Gator Country property.
