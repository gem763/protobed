The vote highlights how Democrats from high-tax states \u2014 such as New York, New Jersey and California \u2014 view the tax law\u2019s cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction as a top priority and the challenges they face in doing away with it.\n\n\u201cAs bad as the Trump tax bill is for the whole country, it\u2019s even worse for states like New Jersey,\u201d Sen. Bob Menendez Robert (Bob) MenendezTurkey sanctions face possible wall in GOP Senate Paul blocks Senate vote on House-passed Syria resolution House to vote on resolution condemning Trump's Syria pullback MORE (D-N.J.) said on the Senate floor ahead of the vote.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe tax law Trump signed in December 2017 imposed a cap on the SALT deduction of $10,000.\n\nRepublicans capped the deduction in order to raise revenue to pay for tax cuts elsewhere in the law, and because they viewed the deduction as subsidizing higher state taxes. They have noted that analysts have estimated that most people got a tax cut for 2018 under Trump\u2019s law, even in high-tax states.\n\nEfforts to repeal the SALT deduction cap have also faced criticism among progressives, because analysts across the ideological spectrum have estimated that repealing the SALT deduction cap would primarily benefit high-income taxpayers.\n\nBut the cap has been one of the most controversial portions of the GOP tax law, with policymakers in some blue states arguing that it unfairly punishes their residents with high property taxes and will make it harder for their states to offer public services to their residents.\n\nSeveral GOP House members from New York, New Jersey and California joined with Democrats in voting against the tax law due to concerns about the SALT deduction cap, though no GOP senators hail from those states and no Republican senator voted against the final version of the 2017 law.\n\nIn the 2018 midterm elections, Democrats flipped a number of House seats in affluent, suburban areas where residents had relied heavily on the SALT deduction before the GOP tax law was enacted, though the tax law wasn\u2019t the only factor, or necessarily the driving factor, behind Democrats\u2019 victories in those districts.\n\nThe Senate vote centered on nullifying Treasury Department and IRS rules, finalized in June, that blocked certain workarounds that blue states created to allow their residents to circumvent the SALT deduction cap. The Congressional Review Act allows Congress to vote to nullify recently finalized regulations, and senators can force a vote on resolutions under the act with the signatures of 30 members of the chamber.\n\nSeveral states tried to allow residents to convert state and local taxes into charitable contributions that would still be fully deductible on federal tax returns. States authorized the creation of state and local funds that taxpayers could make donations to and receive credits against their state and local taxes.\n\nThe IRS\u2019s rules are designed to prevent the donation-and-credit programs from being used as workarounds to the SALT deduction cap. Under the rules, taxpayers can only claim a charitable deduction for donation amounts that exceed the amount of state tax credits they received.\n\nDemocrats in high-tax states have blasted the rules as harmful to their residents. They also encouraged Republicans to join them in voting to overturn the rules, pointing out that the rules also affect donation-and-credit programs in red states that pre-date the GOP tax law.\n\n\u201cThe regulation we will be voting on impacts state charitable credits in virtually every state \u2014 ranging in areas from education to conservation to child care and more,\u201d Schumer said Tuesday.\n\nBut Republicans defended their tax law and blasted Democrats for focusing on making a change to the law that would help high earners.\n\n\u201cRather than acknowledge that the sky hasn\u2019t fallen, our Democratic friends still want to undermine tax reform,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellGraham to introduce resolution condemning House impeachment inquiry Overnight Defense: Trump's Syria envoy wasn't consulted on withdrawal | McConnell offers resolution urging Trump to rethink Syria | Diplomat says Ukraine aid was tied to political investigations Partisan squabbles endanger congressional response to Trump's course on Syria MORE (R-Ky.) said Wednesday. \u201cListen to this. Democrats\u2019 first target is changing the tax code so that working families across the country have to subsidize wealthy people in states like New York, New Jersey and California.\u201d\n\nSenate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley Charles (Chuck) Ernest GrassleyMulvaney faces uncertain future after public gaffes State cites 38 people for violations in Clinton email review Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle mourn Cummings MORE (R-Iowa) called the blue states\u2019 workarounds \u201cstate-sanctioned tax shelters.\u201d\n\nOne Democrat took issue with the resolution to overturn the IRS rules.\n\nBennet on the Senate floor Tuesday called Trump\u2019s tax law \u201ccompletely misguided\u201d and argued that the Trump administration designed the SALT deduction cap as revenge on people who didn\u2019t vote for the president in 2016. And he called the IRS rules overly broad regulations that harmed programs that existed before the tax law was enacted. But he also said that voting to overturn the IRS rules would make Trump\u2019s tax law worse.\n\n\u201cLet me be very clear: The vast majority of the benefits of repealing the SALT cap would go to high-income Americans,\u201d Bennet said. \u201cRepeal would be extremely costly. And for that same cost, we could finance much more worthy efforts to help working- and middle-class families all over the country.\u201d\n\nDemocratic lawmakers representing high-tax jurisdictions have said that even if their constituents who are hurt by the SALT deduction cap have high incomes, they are still middle class because they face a high cost of living.\n\nIn the House, Democrats are also wrestling with how to address the SALT deduction cap. The House Ways and Means Committee held hearings on the topic in June, and lawmakers have formed a working group to come up with consensus legislation on the issue.\n\nRep. Mike Thompson Charles (Mike) Michael ThompsonHere are the Democrats who aren't co-sponsoring an assault weapons ban House panel advances anti-gun violence legislation Pelosi asks Democrats for 'leverage' on impeachment MORE (D-Calif.), the leader of the working group and a senior member of the Ways and Means Committee, said Tuesday that the group is drafting legislation that he hopes will get a committee vote by the end of the year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to write legislation that\u2019s paid for and legislation that addresses this mess that the Republican tax bill created,\u201d Thompson said.\n\nRep. Bill Pascrell William (Bill) James PascrellLawmakers, social media users praise photo of Pelosi confronting Trump Lawmakers focus their ire on NBA, not China Hillary Clinton swipes at NBA over Hong Kong controversy MORE (D-N.J.), another Ways and Means Committee member, suggested on Tuesday that the bill could involve increasing the cap from $10,000 to $25,000 or $30,000, but not totally repealing the cap. He suggested that the bill could be paid for by raising the top individual income tax rate.\n\nRohit Kumar, a former McConnell aide who now works at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said the work House and Senate Democrats are doing now on the SALT deduction is largely about \u201claying the groundwork\u201d for future negotiations, as well as showing that they\u2019re working to help their constituents.\n\nPeople who feel that they were hurt by the cap \u201cwant to see their elected members fighting for them,\u201d he said.\n\nThe SALT deduction cap hasn\u2019t been a prominent issue in the Democratic presidential primary. While some candidates from high-tax states, such as Harris and Sen. Cory Booker Cory Anthony BookerProgressive commentator: Voters becoming weary of Warren policy proposals Saagar Enjeti: Warren, Buttigieg don't stand a chance against Trump The Hill's 12:30 Report: Trump faces backlash for comparing impeachment to 'lynching' MORE (D-N.J.), have supported legislation to restore the full SALT deduction, the issue hasn\u2019t been central to their campaign platforms, and many other candidates have not explicitly spoken about the cap. Harris' office told The Hill she would have voted for the resolution.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear exactly when any changes to the SALT deduction cap will occur.\n\nNew York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Maryland sued to challenge the SALT deduction cap, but they lost at the district court level. New York, New Jersey and Connecticut have filed a separate lawsuit challenging the IRS rules that is still pending before a federal district court in New York.\n\nLawmakers will have a major opportunity to revisit the GOP tax law at the end of 2025, when the SALT deduction cap and the law\u2019s other tax changes to the individual code expire. But a future Democratic president and Congress may want to reexamine the cap and the tax law as a whole sooner than that.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to want to replace it with something better before the end of 2025,\u201d said Steve Wamhoff, director of federal tax policy at the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.\n\n--Updated at 5:09 p.m.", "description": "The Senate on Wednesday rejected a Democratic effort to overturn IRS regulations blocking workarounds to a portion of President Trump\u2019s tax law that is disliked by high-tax states.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/schumercharles_101619gn_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
