They try sending signals, but whatever\u2019s marching around on that unknown world isn\u2019t responding. So, the curious galactic explorers try something different. They send a robotic probe to a small, quiet space rock orbiting near the life-rich planet, just to keep an eye on things.\n\nIf a story like this played out at any moment in Earth\u2019s 4.5 billion-year history, it just might have left an archaeological record. At least, that\u2019s the hope behind a new proposal to check Earth\u2019s so-called co-orbitals for signs of advanced alien technology.\n\nCo-orbitals are space objects that orbit the sun at about the same distance that Earth does. \u201cThey\u2019re basically going around the sun at the same rate the Earth is, and they\u2019re very nearby,\u201d said James Benford, a physicist and independent SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) researcher who dreamed up the idea that aliens might have bugged Earth via these co-orbitals while he was at a conference in Houston last year.", "description": "", "authors": ["Live Science", "Livescience.Com Alien-Life-Bugged-Space-Rock-Co-Orbitals.Html"], "top_image": ""}
