The online stream was cut off mid-interview shortly afterwards and quickly went to a commercial break\n\nAfter that PewDiePie moved on to ridicule Beijing for blocking South Park.

I'm banned from China,\n\n'That's right (laughs). After I spoke about the Hong Kong protests and showed their leader being mocked for looking like Winnie the Pooh, I got banned from China. That's right.\u2019\n\nHe continued: 'Now if you search anything PewDiePie related on any Reddit related forum in China or a YouTube related video, it will just be completely blank.\n\nHe then apologised to his fans in the country.\n\n'I'm laughing, but yeah I'm sorry if you're in China and try to watch my videos.\n\n'That kinda sucks. It's just kinda funny... like I knew it was going to happen.\n\n'The music artist Zedd got banned in China just because he liked a South Park tweet, so obviously me talking about the Hong Kong memes was going to get me banned.'\n\nWinnie the Pooh, a lovable but dim-witted bear created by English author A. A. Milne, has become a symbol of dissent in China for its apparent resemblance to President Xi.\n\nIn 2013, Chinese net users circulated pictures (above) that placed an image of Pooh and his slender friend Tigger beside an image of Xi walking with then-US President Barack Obama\n\nIn 2014, a photographed handshake between President Xi and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (not the one above) also sparked internet memes.
