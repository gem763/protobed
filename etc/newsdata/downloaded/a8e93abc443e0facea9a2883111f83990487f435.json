You could argue maybe they're right and they should, but I think most people on the street would argue they shouldn't.\n\n\"Essentially it should be limited to state and Commonwealth policing agencies, ICAC equivalents, and of course ASIO. That's about it.\"\n\nMr Phair, director of UNSW Canberra Cyber, said regular public reporting should include data on offences investigated and disclosure of where successful convictions were based solely on records held in a federal database.\n\nHe said mission creep could \"quite easily\" see facial recognition used in ways most Australians would object to.\n\nHong Kong authorities have access to artificial intelligence software that can match faces from protest footage, and experts say its use is ubiquitous in mainland China, used for law enforcement and \"social credit\" monitoring of the population.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The City of Westminister [in England], which is only about a mile by a mile, has a 100 per cent saturation from CCTV cameras and obviously subsequent monitoring thereof,\" Mr Phair said.\n\nMr Dutton said the legislation was good and necessary.\n\n'Diabolical' politics\n\n\"It just reflects the reality now of people having their digital identity stolen online as well. This is a big business for organised crime groups.''\n\nOne member of the respected parliamentary committee said the politics of facial recognition was \"diabolical\" and there had been no public argument from the government for more than a year about why the database was required.\n\nCommittee members were not opposed to the database per se, but rather wanted to see more privacy safeguards.\n\n\"Instead of writing 100 plus recommendations we decided to start over and consider those principles,\" the MP said.\n\nLabor's shadow attorney-general, Mark Dreyfus, said the public needed assurances the scheme wouldn't be abused.\n\n\"We've got technology that is racing ahead, that is giving potentially undreamed-of power to our security agencies and our police forces. It has to be surrounded by safeguards,\" he said.", "description": "The Morrison government's scuttled facial recognition laws would have gone well beyond combating identify theft and national security threats.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2648%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/84a03834a5348cd67022780c500e054a87d5ba63", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
