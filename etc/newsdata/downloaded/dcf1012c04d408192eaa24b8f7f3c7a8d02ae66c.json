It\u2019s a photo of a local man named Junior Merritt, who sometimes went by the name of \u201cBuck\u201d. I imagine poor Junior has died by now. I think at some point in the 1990s he was no longer able to care for himself, and was institutionalized. But for a long time, he was a beloved member of the St. Francisville community.\n\nJunior was mentally disabled, but he was sweet-natured and harmless. He spent his days pedaling his bike around town, making sure things were kept steady. He fancied himself a sheriff\u2019s deputy. He wore his cowboy hat, and as you can see, installed a CB radio, and flashing lights, on his three-wheeled bike, and a 12-volt battery to power it. His faithful hound dog followed him all around town.\n\nYears ago, before they built a bridge, there used to be a car ferry that would take people across the Mississippi from the ferry landing near St. Francisville to Pointe Coupee Parish on the other side. A tank truck carrying fuel would meet the ferry on the West Feliciana side, and gas the boat back up. Once, the tank truck driver sat high up in his rig, waiting on the boat to make the return journey from the other side of the river.\n\n\u201cTome in, tank twuck! Tome in tank twuck!\u201d squawked the voice on the radio. \u201cYou taint dit on dat fewwy.\u201d\n\nYou can\u2019t get on that ferry. It was Junior calling. He had a serious speech impediment. The driver, who wasn\u2019t from our town and who didn\u2019t know Junior, responded by saying that he wasn\u2019t planning to ride on the boat, just refuel it.\n\nA minute or so passes.\n\n\u201cTome in, tank twuck! Tome in tank twuck!\u201d says the voice again. \u201cYou taint dit on dat fewwy.\u201d\n\nAnnoyed \u2014 and we know this story because the truck driver later told it at Ricky\u2019s Audubon lounge \u2014 the driver made the same reply.\n\nAs the ferry made its approach to dock on the West Feliciana side, Deputy Junior tried one more time. \u201cTome in, tank twuck! Tome in tank twuck! You taint dit on dat fewwy.\u201d\n\nThis time the driver was ticked. \u201cMan, where are you anyway?!\u201d he radioed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thittin\u2019 wight here beside you,\u201d said Deputy Junior. The truck driver looked down from his window and spotted Junior and Bullet below.\n\nThe local sheriff\u2019s department had given Junior a badge just to be nice, but they had to take it away when he tried to take two Canadian tourists into custody at the Piggly Wiggly. My mom saw him in the store once with his beat-up old acoustic guitar, which he didn\u2019t know how to play, banging away on it and serenading a customer with a tongue-twisted version of \u201cYou Are My Sunshine.\u201d\n\nLater in his life, Junior developed a dependence on beer, and the police told all the merchants in town not to sell it to him. Junior figured out that if he cycled the gravel road that runs by the river out to the country, news of his liquor sales ban would probably not have reached the rural merchants. Once he went missing, and the sheriff\u2019s department found him pie-eyed out on the river road, having crashed his bike pedaling back from a beer run to Starhill, and injured himself. When the ambulance came, he fought like hell until the paramedics agreed to let his hound dog ride with him.\n\nLike I said, I imagine ol\u2019 Junior is no longer with us. It didn\u2019t occur to me until I grew up and moved away what an extraordinary person he was, and more to the point, what an extraordinary thing it was that we lived in a community that accommodated him, and even cared for him in a gentle way. The sheriff giving him the dignity of believing that he played a key role in keeping the peace in town. All the local folks giving him the dignity of believing the same, listening to his serenades, and thanking him for what he did for us all. I remember as a child many times hearing my mother encourage him when we were out in town, and he came over to say hello. That\u2019s just how everybody was with Junior. And later in his life, when he had a drinking problem, the community working gently to make it impossible for him to buy booze \u2014 not locking him up in jail, but rather finding a kind way to protect him.\n\nCome to think of it, for many years the assistant manager of one of the grocery stores in town \u2014 a man I worked for as a teenager there \u2014 was a trusty who would check out at day\u2019s end and go sleep in the town jail. Charlie had a drinking problem \u2014 once I found a pint of Seagram\u2019s in the tank of the employee toilet at work \u2014 and had gotten in trouble with the law a lot for public drunkenness. I didn\u2019t know this as a kid, but all the adults in town knew about it, as I found out later. But he wasn\u2019t a bad drunk, and wasn\u2019t always drunk, either. In fact, he was a good employee at the grocery store, dependable, hard-working, polite, and always gentle. He just had a problem. His boss knew about it, and so did the chief of police. They worked out a system where Charlie, who, by the way, was black, could do his job and support his family, but pay his debt to society by spending nights in jail. I bet that wouldn\u2019t happen today. There would be too much legal liability if something went wrong. But that\u2019s how it was in the 1970s and 1980s in our little town. Junior patrolling the parking lots on his bike, Charlie stacking produce in the IGA (and sneaking off to the toilet for a nip every now and then), and everybody treating them with respect and compassion, because why not?\n\nWhat a town, what an era. Let me ask you readers who grew up in small towns: did you have folks like Deputy Junior around? How did people treat them?", "description": "", "authors": ["Rod Dreher"], "top_image": "http://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_0316-e1570997781890.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
