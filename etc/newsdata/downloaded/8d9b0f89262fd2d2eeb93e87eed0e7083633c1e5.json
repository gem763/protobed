They both worked at the base and MI5 files, newly released to the National Archives, reveal that Houghton\u2019s then wife approached the admiralty about concerns about her husband on three occasions in 1955.\n\nA letter from the admiralty to the security services from 1956 stated she had \u201calleged that her husband was divulging secret information to people who ought not to get it\u201d.\n\nHowever, it added: \u201cIt is considered not impossible that the whole of these allegations may be nothing more than outpourings of a jealous and disgruntled wife.\u201d\n\nIn March 1961, Martin Furnival Jones, who four years later would become the MI5 director general, wrote: \u201cIt is clear that we ought to have carried out some investigation in 1956.\n\nPM was not told Anthony Blunt was Soviet spy, archives reveal Read more\n\n\u201cIf we had done so there is a fair chance that we would have unearthed Houghton\u2019s espionage and the probability is that we would have discovered that he was being controlled as a spy by a member of the Soviet embassy.\n\n\u201cWe might also have hit upon Miss Gee. If we had done so we should have stopped a leakage of information from the admiralty some four years earlier.\u201d\n\nThe files record that Houghton beat his wife \u2013 they separated in 1955 and later divorced \u2013 and even tried to kill her by pushing her off a cliff, only to be interrupted by passersby. When they returned home after the incident, she said he threw gin in her face and told her: \u201cI\u2019ve got to get rid of you, you know too much.\u201d\n\nAmong the other allegations detailed in the documents, were that her husband had documents marked \u201ctop secret\u201d relating to \u201cunderwater detection equipment and torpedoes\u201d, would return from trips to London with bundles of notes, that he showed her a piece of chalk he said was to mark where the money would be left, that he brought Poles back to the flat \u2013 refusing to say who they were \u2013 and that he told her how he employed a folded newspaper as a \u201crecognition signal\u201d.\n\nThe papers, published on Tuesday, show that after the ring was exposed, the admiralty and MI5 worried about Houghton\u2019s ex-wife speaking to the press.\n\nHoughton, then aged 56, and Gee, 47, were imprisoned for 15 years each in 1961 but were released in 1970 and married the following year.\n\nGee always maintained that she acted only out of love. Redacted letters she sent to Houghton contained in the newly released files illustrate her affection for him.\n\n\u201cBunty\u201d, as she signed her letters, began each one \u201cMy Darling Harry\u201d and, in November 1962, she wrote that \u201cthe short time I spent with you was the happiest time of my life\u201d.\n\nIn one letter in 1962 she berated Houghton\u2019s lack of \u201cguts\u201d and two years later rejected his suggestion they cooperate with the authorities, saying \u201cunder no circumstances would I do any kind of deal with them\u201d.\n\nWhen the authorities arranged a visit by Houghton to see her while they were both still in prison, a transcript showed that Gee, who maintained her innocence, nevertheless warned him: \u201cDon\u2019t speak to them in any way. I\u2019d be back again doing another sentence.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "Declassified files suggest wife of spy Harry Houghton warned admiralty about his role in 1955", "authors": ["Haroon Siddique"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c2845f7676fcde4ca55b4e229ce3cc6ffd962dc/0_213_5268_3159/master/5268.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ba9e99e30e75339568a4805ab45e16f4", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
