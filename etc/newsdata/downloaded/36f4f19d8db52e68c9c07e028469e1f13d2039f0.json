As a result, the rise of earnings adjustments over the past 20 years has been dramatic.\n\nNon-GAAP adjustments related to net income increased 33% from 1998 to 2017, according to the research, which was conducted by accounting professors from the Harvard Business School and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Sloan School of Management.\n\nThe researchers analyzed two decades of operating earnings from Russell 3000 companies. Based on the data, compiled by financial technology firm New Constructs LLC, they concluded that company managers are not calculating non-GAAP earnings correctly and are embedding their own biases.\n\n\u201cCompanies will tell you this is the way investors want to see it, but it\u2019s not necessarily what investors are asking them for,\u201d said Sandy Peters, head of financial reporting policy for the CFA Institute, which represents chartered financial analysts, in an interview.\n\nResearch firm Audit Analytics found that 97% of S&P 500 companies used non-GAAP figures in 2017, up from 59% in 1996.\n\nThe recent proliferation of non-GAAP usage among technology companies has created greater discrepancies between the valuations of publicly traded companies. Sector participants are highly unlikely to have positive net income according to normal accounting rules. For example, Uber Technologies Inc. uses non-GAAP \u201ccore platform adjusted net revenue,\u201d which attempts to strip out recurring costs it incurs to grow in competitive markets.\n\nThe Harvard and MIT researchers found that companies averaged eight total adjustments to their income statements in 2017, up from six in 1998. The average adjustment per company added 26 cents per share, which equates to about 15% of average GAAP earnings per share.\n\nA significant portion of GAAP earnings consists of non-operating earnings, which companies frequently hide in the management discussion and analysis section or in the footnotes of their annual reports. Companies make non-GAAP adjustments by taking some subset of non-operating earnings and adding it back to net income.\n\n\u201cThese non-operating earnings can substantially complicate the forecasting of companies\u2019 future performance for analysts and investors,\u201d Charles Wang, an associate professor at Harvard and one of the authors of the study, said in an interview.\n\nFor a younger generation of analysts, adjusted earnings comprise most of what they\u2019ve seen, Ms. Peters said. Some portfolio managers have said those analysts are not as skeptical of the numbers as they should be, she added.\n\nThe average number of hidden adjustments rose 13%, to 3.78 from 3.35, over 20 years, the researchers found. The per-share value of hidden total adjustments increased by more than seven times to $0.127 in 2018 from $0.015 in 1998.\n\nWrite to Mark Maurer at mark.maurer@wsj.com", "description": "Companies\u2019 reliance on disclosing adjusted earnings or other figures not consistent with generally accepted accounting principles has made it more difficult for investors to forecast performance, putting them at greater risk than they may realize, new academic research shows.", "authors": ["Mark Maurer"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-118472/social", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
