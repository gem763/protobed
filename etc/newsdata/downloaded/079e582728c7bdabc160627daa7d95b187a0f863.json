Speech", "language": "en", "text": "A member of the delegation to the U.N. from Venezuela\u2019s illegitimate socialist regime pretended to read a book while President Donald Trump spoke at the institution\u2019s General Assembly general debate on Tuesday.\n\nThe delegate identified herself as Daniela Rodr\u00edguez and posted on Twitter that she was pretending to read the writings of Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, the founder of Venezuela. Bol\u00edvar wrote prolifically against the United States in the 19th century.\n\nTrump spent a significant portion of his speech warning the world against the evils of communism and socialism, and particularly condemning the regime of dictator Nicol\u00e1s Maduro for plunging Venezuela into extreme poverty and using human rights abuses to repress political dissidents.\n\nMaduro will not attend the U.N. General Assembly despite being invited, sending instead Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza. The U.N. insisted on inviting Maduro despite him no longer holding the office of the presidency. His term expired in January, but he refused to step down, so the National Assembly used its constitutional powers to replace him with an interim president, Juan Guaid\u00f3.\n\nGuaid\u00f3 announced that he had sent a delegation to the U.N. General Assembly on Monday despite not being invited.\n\nRodr\u00edguez, the socialist delegate, posted a photo of herself on Twitter reading a book with the falsified socialist image of Bol\u00edvar \u2013 created by Hugo Ch\u00e1vez after exhuming the founding father\u2019s corpse in 2012 \u2013 on its cover.\n\n\u201cWhile infamy and lies speak before the U.N., we read Bol\u00edvar: \u2018The United States seems destined by providence to plague America with misery in the name of liberty,'\u201d Rodr\u00edguez wrote.\n\n#24sep Mientras la infamia y la mentira hablan desde la #ONU, nosotros leemos a Bol\u00edvar: \"Los Estados Unidos parecen destinados por la providencia para plagar la Am\u00e9rica de miserias en nombre de la libertad\". #HandsOffVenezuela #UNGA Ning\u00fan Imperio dar\u00e1 lecciones a #Venezuela pic.twitter.com/T70HXhLBiv \u2014 Daniela Rodr\u00edguez (@danialerodrimar) September 24, 2019\n\nHer boss Jorge Arreaza \u2013 Hugo Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s son-in-law \u2013 applauded her on social media, as well.\n\n\u201cThe best response against imperialist and supremacist aggression from Donald Trump is to submerge ourselves in our pure, luminous, sovereign fountain of independence, equality, and liberty: SIM\u00d3N BOL\u00cdVAR, THE LIBERATOR,\u201d Arreaza wrote on Twitter:\n\nLa mejor respuesta a las agresiones imperialistas y supremacistas de Donald Trump, es sumergirnos en nuestra fuente pura, luminosa y soberana de independencia, igualdad y libertad: SIM\u00d3N BOL\u00cdVAR, EL LIBERTADOR. #UNGA #NoMoreTrump pic.twitter.com/3Q6boMKbSN \u2014 Jorge Arreaza M (@jaarreaza) September 24, 2019\n\nDuring Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s stunt, Trump condemned Maduro\u2019s regime while assuring the Venezuelan people that \u201call of America is behind you\u201d and that America had \u201cvast quantities of humanitarian aid ready to be delivered.\u201d Venezuela has been suffering severe food shortages and almost a total lack of basic medications for at least two years. Maduro has repeatedly rejected American humanitarian aid. On one occasion, socialist Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez went on Maduro\u2019s propaganda broadcast network and told Venezuelans that American food aid was \u201ccarcinogenic\u201d and not safe to eat.\n\n\u201cWomen in Venezuela stand in line for ten hours a day waiting for food,\u201d Trump told the General Assembly. \u201cOver 15,000 people have been detained as political prisoners. Modern-day death squads are carrying out thousands of extrajudicial killings.\u201d\n\nTrump referred to Maduro as a \u201cCuban puppet, protected by Cuban bodyguards, hiding from his own people.\u201d\n\nMore generally, Trump referred to socialism and communism as \u201cthe wrecker of nations and destroyer of societies.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvents in Venezuela remind us all that socialism and communism are not about justice, they are not about equality, they are not about lifting up the poor, and they are certainly not about the good of the people,\u201d he continued. \u201cSocialism and communism are about one thing only: power for the ruling class.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump was speaking, the State Department announced new sanctions on the Venezuelan oil industry. Specifically, Washington levied sanctions on four companies working with Maduro\u2019s oil industry and blocked the travel of four vessels used to transport Venezuelan oil.\n\n\u201cThis action further targets Venezuela\u2019s oil sector and the mechanisms used to transport oil to Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s Cuban benefactors, who continue to prop up the former regime,\u201d State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said. \u201cThese sanctions are a follow-on to the designations and identifications announced on April 5 and 12 that targeted entities and vessels known to be involved in the transportation of crude oil from Venezuela to Cuba.\u201d\n\nNicol\u00e1s Maduro is currently in Moscow to \u201csecure our historic and very positive relations of exchange and respect between our peoples.\u201d\n\nLlegamos a la Patria rusa para afianzar nuestras hist\u00f3ricas y muy positivas relaciones de intercambio y respeto entre nuestros pueblos. La hermandad que hemos construido a lo largo de los a\u00f1os, es eje fundamental para la construcci\u00f3n del futuro pr\u00f3spero de Venezuela. pic.twitter.com/maQ0zDE71X \u2014 Nicol\u00e1s Maduro (@NicolasMaduro) September 24, 2019\n\nRussia\u2019s Foreign Relations Ministry published a photo Tuesday of Maduro standing alongside President Vladimir Putin. Maduro appeared to continue using Twitter to condemn the world\u2019s free societies, taking time out of his diplomatic schedule to accuse Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro of \u201cfascism\u201d for condemning \u201csensationalist\u201d media reports on fires in the Amazon Rainforest that circulated in August.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "A member of the delegation to the U.N. from Venezuela pretended to read a book while President Donald Trump spoke.", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/venezuelan-delegate-reads-book-trump-speech-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
