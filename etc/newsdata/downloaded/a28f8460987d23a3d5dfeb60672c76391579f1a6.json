The question was how, and in what form, the president and his team would defy lawmakers\u2019 authority to hold Trump accountable.\n\nYesterday afternoon, the answer came into sharp focus with a letter from White House counsel Pat Cipollone.\n\nThe White House refused Tuesday to turn over internal documents regarding Ukraine being sought by House Democrats as the Trump administration dug in against their impeachment inquiry. In a defiant letter that echoed the president\u2019s recent impeachment messaging \u2013 accusing Democrats of violating the Constitution and civil liberties and attempting to overturn the results of the 2016 election \u2013 the White House said it would not comply with the request from House Democrats because they were conducting an invalid investigation.\n\nThe full text of the eight-page letter is online here (pdf), and even by the standards of Trump World, this one\u2019s a doozy. I\u2019m a little surprised a White House counsel agreed to put his name on it, since it\u2019s likely to do lasting harm to Cipollone\u2019s reputation as a legal professional.\n\nIndeed, it\u2019s difficult to see the letter as even presenting a legal argument. In practice, it\u2019s as if the president threw a tantrum; the White House legal team jotted down some of his poorly articulated rage; and shameless Republican attorneys tried to put a legal-ish veneer on Trump\u2019s rant.\n\nGregg Nunziata, who served as legal counsel and a senior policy adviser to Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), described Cipollone\u2019s letter as \u201cbananas\u201d and a \u201cbarely-lawyered temper tantrum.\u201d Nunziata added that \u201cno member of Congress,\u201d regardless of party or ideology, \u201cshould accept it.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s that bad.\n\nGoing into yesterday afternoon, I\u2019ll confess to being deeply curious as to what the White House counsel\u2019s office was going to come up with, since the Republican talking points in recent weeks have been so hilariously unpersuasive. I assumed Cipollone\u2019s letter to Congress would offer Team Trump an opportunity to put its best foot forward.\n\nBut if this is the best they\u2019ve got, the White House is in trouble. The counsel\u2019s office was reduced to arguing that the U.S. House\u2019s impeachment process, established by the Constitution, is \u201cunconstitutional\u201d \u2013 a word the document repeated eight times \u2013 and the White House considers Congress\u2019 process \u201cillegitimate.\u201d It therefore feels comfortable refusing to cooperate with the legal inquiry.\n\nReactions from the legal community were brutal. George Conway wrote, \u201cI cannot fathom how any self-respecting member of the bar could affix his name to this letter. It\u2019s pure hackery, and it disgraces the profession.\u201d Former acting U.S. Solicitor General Neal Katyal called the White House\u2019s letter \u201cinane,\u201d adding, \u201cYou don\u2019t get to block impeachment just because you don\u2019t like it.\u201d Law professor Ryan Goodman, former special counsel at the Pentagon, described Cipollone\u2019s letter as \u201ca professional embarrassment.\u201d\n\nThis may yet get worse before it gets better. In a call with reporters orchestrated by the White House, a senior administration official argued that before officials on Team Trump agreed to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry, the president and his aides expected a \u201cfull halt\u201d to the process.\n\nOr put another way, after Congress stops the impeachment inquiry, Trump will consider cooperating with the impeachment inquiry.\n\nAs a rule, if the White House were confident in the president\u2019s innocence, complete defiance wouldn\u2019t be necessary. But in this case, Trump and those around him clearly have a great deal to hide.\n\nThe likelihood of the president\u2019s impeachment inches closer to 100% every day.", "description": "Cipollone's letter to Congress offered the White House an opportunity to put its best foot forward.
