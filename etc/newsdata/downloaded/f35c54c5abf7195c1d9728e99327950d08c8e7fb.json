Talk is that it\u2019s reserve managers from Switzerland and China who are among those paying to lend money to Berlin.\n\nA trader works at Frankfurt's stock exchange in Frankfurt, Germany, October 17, 2019. REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski/Files\n\nGermany\u2019s 10-year sovereign bond has traded with yields below 0% for the most part since March. It currently yields around -0.4% \u2014 almost a whole percentage point below year-ago levels.\n\nFor most of the time since early August, all German government bonds have carried negative yields <0#DEBMK=> DE10YT=RR.\n\nIt\u2019s an unattractive proposition for most bond investors, even those with long time horizons, because holding negative-yielding debt to maturity means incurring a loss.\n\nBut amid signs asset managers and insurers are cutting exposure to Germany, there is evidence of increased foreign buying. According to the Bundesbank, Germany\u2019s central bank, net inflows from overseas accounts turned positive in April for the first time since early 2015.\n\n(Graphic: Foreign investors raise exposure to German Bunds here)\n\n(Graphic: Stock of freely traded German Bunds diminishes here)\n\nIn July, the latest month for which data is available, such inflows, from investors based in the euro zone and beyond, rose 3.6% year-on-year, the biggest jump since March 2015.\n\nSeparate data compiled by German lender Commerzbank and based on its own internal flows monitor also shows overseas buyers increased their exposure to the euro zone\u2019s benchmark bond issuer in the first quarter of 2019 for the first time in more than four years.\n\nThat, alongside the steady decline in German borrowing costs \u2014 down 40 basis points in the April-July period alone \u2014 suggests there are some investors who are not put off by the negative yields deterring other buyers.\n\n\u201cIn the end the puzzle is still incomplete, but it\u2019s fairly safe to conclude from these various data points, that we have seen significant foreign buying in Bunds and non-euro based buying in Bunds,\u201d said Commerzbank\u2019s head of interest rate strategy Michael Leister.\n\n\u201cAnd most likely, this is not coming from institutional investors but central banks \u2014 particularly in recent months.\u201d\n\n(Graphic: Germany's bond yield curve here)\n\nWHY CENTRAL BANKS?\n\nReserve managers are a secretive bunch, usually reluctant to disclose details of their strategy shifts, while Germany does not reveal who buys its sovereign debt. But there\u2019s anecdotal evidence to suggest central banks have stepped up.\n\nFor one, unlike mainstream asset managers, central banks are less sensitive to outright yields, buying bonds for monetary policy or to hold in currency reserves.\n\nIndeed, the euro\u2019s share of currency reserves edged up in the second quarter to 20.35% from 20.23% in the first, recent data from the International Monetary Fund shows, though the rise is also down to valuation effects.\n\nThe euro gained around 1.6% against other major currencies during this period.\n\n\u201cI am pretty sure that most foreign central banks, in their currency reserves, hold a large portion of German Bunds and as long as those reserves are growing, there will continue to be demand for German debt,\u201d said J\u00f6rg Zeuner, chief economist at Union Investment.\n\nOne central bank that has lapped up euro zone assets \u2014 especially German debt \u2014 is the Swiss National Bank which central bank-watchers say buys Bunds whenever it ramps up interventions to curb Swiss franc strength.\n\nTo protect its export-heavy economy, the SNB has been crediting the sight deposits of Swiss banks with newly created francs in exchange for foreign currency, usually euros. These deposits expanded to 471 billion as of the end of June, compared with 56 billion francs in July 2011.\n\nExchange rates can also offer clues since Swiss franc strength against the euro in recent months has coincided with a surge in sight deposits.\n\n\u201cWhen the Swiss add to their reserves there is predictably a flow into Bunds,\u201d said Brad Setser, a senior fellow on the Council on Foreign Relations in New York who has tracked international capital flows and central bank reserve policies for many years.\n\nBuying of German bonds by the Swiss central bank in recent years has come on top of European Central Bank purchases for quantitative easing. The ECB renews its bond buying in November.\n\n(Graphic: Swiss franc vs euro and SNB sight deposits here)\n\n(Graphic: China's holdings of U.S. Treasuries here)\n\nThe China link seems more tenuous, but the country cut holdings of U.S. Treasuries to more than two-year lows in August as its trade war with Washington intensified. While bond analysts are reluctant to go on the record as pointing the finger at China, Beijing might well be shifting some cash into the euro zone, they note.\n\n\u201cThe latest data does suggest some Chinese Treasury sales in August \u2013 and it is possible thus that China bought some euro area assets as part of a broader rebalancing of its portfolio,\u201d Setser said.\n\nAs for mainstream safety-seeking investors such as pension funds and insurers who are usually drawn to Germany\u2019s gold-plated triple-A rated debt, they seem to have had enough.\n\nTraders work at Frankfurt's stock exchange in Frankfurt, Germany March 14, 2019. REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski/Files\n\nRecent auctions of 30-year German debt have seen weak demand and the German Insurance Association\u2019s chief economist was quoted recently by local media as saying hardly any German insurers were now buying Bunds.\n\nAs for foreign buyers, Japanese funds have been flocking to U.S. bonds and away from negative yielding securities. They sold a net 374.4 billion yen of German debt in August, following 22.6 billion yen of net selling in July.\n\n\u201cAt current yield levels, German and French government bonds are not investable,\u201d said Hiroshi Nakamura, senior manager of investment planning at Taiju Life Insurance.", "description": "German government bonds with their sub-zero yields have lured foreign inflows for four straight months.
