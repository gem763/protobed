(Photo: USA TODAY)\n\nThree soldiers were killed and three more injured Sunday when an armored vehicle crashed during training exercises at Fort Stewart in Georgia.\n\nThe soldiers, with the Army's 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team, were riding in a Bradley Fighting Vehicle, but details of the incident were not immediately released. Three soldiers were pronounced dead at the scene, and the others were evacuated to Winn Army Community Hospital where they are being treated and evaluated for their injuries, Fort Stewart spokesman Lt. Col. Patrick Husted said in a statement.\n\n\"Today is a heartbreaking day for the 3rd Infantry Division, and the entire Fort Stewart-Hunter Army Airfield community, as we are all devastated after a training accident this morning on the Fort Stewart Training Area,\" said Maj. Gen. Tony Aguto, commanding general of the 3rd Infantry Division. \"We are extremely saddened by the loss of three Dogface Soldiers, and injuries to three more. Our hearts and prayers go out to all the families affected by this tragedy.\"\n\nDogface is a term for soldiers serving in the infantry.\n\n22 paratroopers injured: Wind blew them into trees at Camp Shelby\n\nThe investigation was continuing and more information will be released as it becomes available, Husted said. The names of the soldiers will be released Monday, he added.\n\nEarlier this month, almost two dozen paratroopers were injured at Camp Shelby in Mississippi when troops jumping from a C-130 in high winds and were blown from their intended drop zone into a group of pine trees.\n\nFort Stewart-Hunter Army Airfield is home to the 3rd Infantry Division and more than 18,000 soldiers and 4,000 Army civilian workers. The 450-square-mile base is responsible for training, equipping, deploying, and redeploying active and reserve Army units.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/20/army-soldiers-killed-fort-stewart-accident-bradley-fighting-vehicle-deaths/4045169002/", "description": "After a Bradley Fighting Vehicle crashed, three Fort Stewart soldiers were\u00a0pronounced dead at the scene; three more were evacuated to a hospital.", "authors": ["John Bacon", "Published A.M.
