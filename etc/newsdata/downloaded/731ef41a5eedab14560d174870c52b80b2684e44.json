(Photo: Reviewed)\n\n\u2014 Our editors review and recommend products to help you buy the stuff you need. If you make a purchase by clicking one of our links, we may earn a small share of the revenue. However, our picks and opinions are independent from USA Today\u2019s newsroom and any business incentives.\n\nAmazon always has a ton of deals, from featured Deals of the Day to on-page coupons to Lightning Deals that are gone in a flash. But they're not always as amazing as they appear. Whether there's a \"good\" deal on a bad product, or a price drop that's not as enticing as it seems, we look deeper at everything Amazon has on sale every day to determine the five best deals you can get. We want to make sure you don't spend money on something you'll hate or spend more than you need to on something you love.\n\n1. The cult-favorite TubShroom\n\nThis genius thing is on sale for a short time\u2014don't miss it! (Photo: TubShroom)\n\nThe TubShroom is so genius if you hate cleaning hair out of the shower drain or using a snake or Drano to unclog the pipes. This little hunk of silicone sits in the drain and collects hair and other debris. All you have to do is swipe a some TP over it to clear out the gross bits once in a while. Right now, there's a Lightning Deal on the orange one for its usual Lightning Deal price, a whopping $2 off the full price. It' seems like a small discount, but this thing will last (I've had mine for over a year) and you might as well save a couple bucks if you can. Lightning Deals go quick, so act fast.\n\nGet the TubShroom in Orange for $10.99 (Save $2)\n\n2. Best price: One of the top carry-on suitcases\n\nThis carry-on, with a built-in USB charger, will get you through holiday travel. (Photo: TravelPro)\n\nThe holidays are coming, and if you're traveling to visit loved ones (or get away from it all) a good carry-on can make your trip way less stressful. TravelPro makes some of the best suitcases we've tested, and right now they've got one that's similar to one we tested and loved with a built-in USB port on sale for its lowest price ever on Amazon. It originally cost $440, which is absurd, but typically retails for around $159. This nearly $40 discount puts it at the best price we've ever seen, and it's available for both the black and navy options.\n\nGet the TravelPro Luggage 22-Inch Carry-On with USB Port for $114.99 (Save $39)\n\n3. Under $25: A power strip that will actually fit everything\n\nMake life easier with a powerstrip that actually works for your devices. (Photo: Anker)\n\nAnker's running a Deal of the Day today, discounting a whole bunch of its charging accessories up to 40%, including portable batteries, charging cables, and wireless charging pads. But if you buy one thing from this sale, I cannot recommend the power strip enough. It's usually over $30, but is just under $24 right now, the best price we've ever seen. Not only does it have 12 outlets AND three fast-charge USB ports, but it's designed so you can actually use every outlet. Six are spread out along each side of the strip for larger plugs, and then you have six more spots for traditional plugs.\n\nGet the Anker Power Strip Surge Protector for $23.79 (Save $10.20)\n\n4. Best price: Headphones that play through your bones\n\nThese earbuds sit just outside your ears so you can be more aware of your surroundings. (Photo: Reviewed / AfterShokz)\n\nMost headphones sit in or over your ears, but if you're running outside, you want to be able to hear cars and people around you. AfterShokz aim to solve that problem with headphones that use bone conduction to play music near, but not in you ears. One of our writers has tested two other versions of AfterShokz headphones and says they've made her feel safer on runs. Right now, you can get the Treks Air wireless headphones for $120, the lowest price we've ever seen.\n\nGet the AfterShokzTreks Air Wireless Bone Conduction Headphones for $119.95 (Save $21.12)\n\n5. Save 10%: This smart, self-warming mug\n\nLukewarm coffee will be a thing of the past. (Photo: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar)\n\nThere are few things more annoying than making your favorite cup of tea, only to have it lukewarm 20 minutes late. Most mugs can't keep things at optimal drinking temperature, so you have limited time for the perfect sip, which is terrible for forgetful people like me. The Ember mug, however, comes with a nifty app that lets you set the perfect temperature of whatever you're drinking. It's usually $80, but down to $72 right now. I've had mine for nearly a year and I am still obsessed with it and can't recommend it highly enough.\n\nGet the Ember Temperature Control Smart Mug for $71.95 (Save $8)\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.
