General Assembly\u2019s session in New York next week. Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said U.S. and Iranian officials will not meet at any level until Washington lifts harsh economic sanctions on his country.\n\nCrude oil prices moderated Tuesday as Saudi Arabia\u2019s energy minister said lost production could be made up in relatively short order and the affected production sites would be fully restored by the end of the month.\n\nYemen\u2019s Houthi rebels claimed credit for the attacks, but the question of how they have changed the region\u2019s political and military calculus continued to confront the U.S. and its allies.\n\n\u201cI never rule anything out, but I prefer not meeting [Mr. Rouhani],\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters en route to California aboard Air Force One.\n\nU.S. and Saudi intelligence agencies were attempting to pin down blame for the oil field attacks Saturday, though Mr. Trump and his top advisers, citing available evidence, have not been shy about suggesting Iran played a key role.\n\nVice President Mike Pence said the administration refuses to ease off the \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign it imposed on Iran after Mr. Trump last year withdrew from the 2015 international nuclear pact with Iran. The pressure has put a severe strain on the Iranian economy.\n\n\u201cKnow this: If Iran conducted this latest attack to pressure President Trump to back off, they will fail,\u201d Mr. Pence said in a speech at the conservative Heritage Foundation. \u201cAmerica is ready to defend our interests.\u201d\n\nSpeaking later to senators on Capitol Hill, Mr. Pence said any U.S. response will be aimed at deterring Iranian aggression, though he didn\u2019t specify tactics.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican and defense hawk, said he hopes the U.S. sends a wake-up call to Iran. He said Tehran was emboldened when Mr. Trump called off retaliatory action in June at the last minute after Iran shot down a U.S. drone.\n\n\u201cIranians saw the president\u2019s restraint as weakness and not as space for diplomacy. So clearly they got the wrong message that inaction on the drone event, I think, has reinforced the narrative that the administration, the Western world [and] the region really isn\u2019t going to do much about provocations,\u201d he said.\n\nYemen\u2019s rebels have assaulted Saudi oil installations in the past in response to a Saudi-led military campaign against them, but analysts said Saturday\u2019s attacks were far more sophisticated, accurate and damaging than the previous strikes. That led many to suspect Iran \u2014 the Saudis\u2019 chief regional rival for power \u2014 of carrying out the attacks. ABC News said U.S. intelligence reports are focusing on a base in southwestern Iran as a possible launch site.\n\nIn Yemen, a spokesman for the rebels said Tuesday that the United Arab Emirates, which has participated the Saudi-led military campaign, could be the next target for drone attacks on its oil assets.\n\nDemocratic doubts\n\nDemocrats condemned the attacks but said Mr. Trump\u2019s erratic policymaking was at least partially to blame. They said the president\u2019s rejection of the nuclear deal left the U.S. without key allies in the fight and that his tilt toward Saudi Arabia threatened to draw the U.S. military even deeper into an unstable region. With some questioning the administration\u2019s apparent readiness to blame Iran for the drone strikes, top Democrats warned that the administration must secure congressional approval for any major military action against Tehran.\n\n\u201cWhile we don\u2019t know who is responsible for the attacks in Saudi Arabia, we do know that without a clear strategy to de-escalate tensions with Iran, the situation will only get worse,\u201d said House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot L. Engel, New York Democrat. \u201cAs the administration determines next steps, I\u2019m compelled to remind them that the Constitution is clear: Unless the United States is attacked first, the president needs authorization from Congress before attacking Iran, even if he is acting in support of one of our partners.\u201d\n\nMr. Pompeo is set to touch down in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on Wednesday to discuss a response to the attacks with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom\u2019s de facto ruler, and \u201ccoordinate efforts to counter Iranian aggression in the region.\u201d\n\nLater in the week, he will head to the United Arab Emirates to meet with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed in Abu Dhabi.\n\nThe Saudi Foreign Ministry condemned the series of attacks as an \u201cegregious crime\u201d that threatens international peace and security. It also said the blitz was in line with previous attacks on pumping stations for the state oil company Saudi Aramco using \u201cIranian weapons.\u201d\n\nSaudi officials said a much-anticipated public stock sale of a portion of Saudi Aramco is moving forward despite the weekend\u2019s supply disruptions.\n\n\u201cThe kingdom will take the appropriate measures based on the results of the investigation, to ensure its security and stability,\u201d the ministry said. \u201cThe kingdom affirms that it has the capability and resolve to defend its land and people, and to forcefully respond to these aggressions.\u201d\n\nThe Abqaiq oil processing plant hit in the Saturday assault is the largest in the world, and the rapid drop in production had immediate repercussions around the globe. U.S. gasoline prices are expected to rise by as much as 25 cents per gallon over the next month, the auto advocacy group AAA announced Tuesday.\n\nShort-lived impact\n\nBut having surveyed the damage, Saudi officials insisted Tuesday that any impact will be short-lived. Roughly 50% of the Abqaiq facility\u2019s production capacity is already back online, Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman told reporters.\n\n\u201cWhere would you find a company in this whole world that went through such a devastating attack and came out like a phoenix?\u201d he said.\n\nThe plant is expected to be back to its pre-attack level \u2014 about 4.9 million barrels of oil each day \u2014 by the end of the month.\n\nThe news had a calming effect on oil prices, which shot up by a whopping 14% Monday. By Tuesday afternoon, Brent crude prices had dropped 6.4%, closing at $64.55 per barrel.\n\nMr. Trump said Tuesday that he doesn\u2019t think he will need to tap the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, an option he placed on the table after the attacks disrupted oil production and increased crude prices.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I need to, but I\u2019m willing to do it. We\u2019re the undisputed champion of energy,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I don\u2019t believe I need to, but if we want to use strategic oil reserves, I would open them up.\u201d\n\nRepublicans said Mr. Trump deserves credit for making sure the U.S. is no longer dependent on foreign suppliers to meet its domestic energy needs.\n\n\u201cThis is a difficult situation, that\u2019s putting it mildly, but as I look to where we are today, I think we also recognize that the impact that we are seeing could be worse,\u201d said Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairwoman Lisa Murkowski, Alaska Republican.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, said the same is true of military readiness. He urged Democrats not to delay critical spending bills that support the armed forces.\n\n\u201cIran\u2019s violent aggression highlights the need for vigilance and for strength,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of this is needlessly more difficult if we don\u2019t do our job and fund the military\u2019s modernization and readiness.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
