The EuroStoxx600 led the way, rising by 0.85%. The DAX30 wasn\u2019t far behind, gaining 0.74% to mark a 5th consecutive day in the green, while the CAC40 trailed with a 0.44% gain.\n\nIn spite of negative sentiment towards the Eurozone economy and global trade terms, it\u2019s been a bullish start to the month. The DAX was up by 3.52% to Wednesday\u2019s close, with the EuroStoxx600 and CAC40 up by 2.7% and 2.51% respectively.\n\nThe majors continued to find support from hopes of the ECB delivering later today and the FED cutting rates next week.\n\nOn the geopolitical front, U.S \u2013 China trade tensions eased ahead of next month\u2019s talks. News hit the wires on Wednesday of China listing a range of U.S products that would be exempt from tariffs due to be introduced in response to the latest U.S tariffs.\n\nFrom the UK, the Court of Sessions overturned its original ruling on the lawfulness of Johnson\u2019s suspension of Parliament. Another blow for the Brexiteer Prime Minister was also a positive for the majors.\n\nThe Stats\n\nIt was a particularly quiet day on the Eurozone economic calendar on Wednesday, with no material stats out of the Eurozone to provide the majors with direction.\n\nFrom the U.S, August wholesale inflation figures had a muted impact on the European majors late in the session, in spite of a pickup in inflationary pressures. The numbers are unlikely to have an influence on the FED\u2019s interest rate decision next week. Month-on-month, the core producer price index rose by 0.3% in August, reversing a 0.1% fall in July.\n\nThe Market Movers\n\nFrom the DAX, the positive trade news from China provided tech stocks with support. Infineon Tech led the way, rallying 3.16%, with Wirecard rising by 1.87%.\n\nIt was a mixed day for the banks on Wednesday, with the prospects of lower interest rates negative for net interest margins and the bottom line. Deutsche Bank rose by just 0.08%, while Commerzbank fell by 0.97%.\n\nFor the auto sector, it was also a mixed bag. Continental and BMW saw red on the day, falling by 0.19% and by 0.02% respectively. Daimler and Volkswagen bucked the trend, rising by 1% and by 0.69% respectively.\n\nFrom the CAC, it was a mixed day for the banks. Soc Gen bucked the trend on the day, rising by 0.47%. BNP Paribas and Credit Agricole joined Commerzbank in the red, with losses of 0.56% and 1.11% respectively. Things were no much better for the auto sector. Renault fell by 1.04%, with Peugeot declining by 0.64%.\n\nOn the VIX Index\n\nThe VIX Index saw red for a 6th day in 7 on Wednesday, falling by 3.95% to end the day at 14.6.\n\nPressure on the VIX persisted off the back of the news from China on trade tariffs and the continued hope of support from the ECB and the FED.\n\nThe Day Ahead\n\nIt\u2019s a particularly busy day on the Eurozone economic calendar. Finalized August inflation figures out of France and the Eurozone\u2019s July industrial production figures are due out in the early part of the session.\n\nBarring deviation from prelim inflation figures, the market focus will be on the industrial production figures.\n\nAny major moves will likely be short-lived, however, as the markets hold out for the ECB monetary policy decision this afternoon.", "description": "It\u2019s a big day for the majors. While economic data is on the heavier side, it\u2019s all down to the ECB monetary policy decision.
