They exist somewhere between presence and memory. They are built for the collective and for those personally affected. They are places for reflection and observation; for reckoning, for grieving, and for peaceful acceptance. They are tourist destinations and graveyards.\n\nThe filmmaker Sara Newens captures these tensions in Footprint, her evocative observational portrait of the 9/11 Memorial. The short documentary spends 24 hours at the former Ground Zero, where on September 11, 2001, 2,606 people lost their lives when the World Trade Center towers were struck by two planes. (Three hundred and ninety others died at the Pentagon and in the four aircraft involved in the terror attacks.) The site where the Twin Towers once stood is now home to a memorial, a museum, the resplendent Oculus, and One World Trade, a building that reflects the sky like a fractured mirror, an emblem of a shattered nation.\n\nIn Newens\u2019s film, visitors to the memorial interact with it in myriad ways.\n\n\u201cI was at first a bit confounded by the frenzy of it all, particularly when people were more engaged with their devices or trying to take their best selfie on such hallowed ground,\u201d Newens told me. \u201cI had anticipated a much more somber environment, even many years\u201d after the tragedy. But after spending a prolonged period of time at the memorial, Newens said her perceptions shifted. \u201cIt became what I often describe as a city symphony: Life must go on, despite the collective pain that we carry with us.\u201d\n\nIn particular, Newens will never forget watching a visitor pause and touch nearly every name on all four panels of the former North Tower. \u201cWhat a profoundly beautiful display of empathy that was,\u201d she said.", "description": "The 9/11 Memorial is both a tourist destination and a graveyard.
