Only when I had left did they inform me it would actually be more like 10 years.\n\n\u201cI was forced out in March 2011, when the tsunami happened. I kept hoping everyone would come back, but that will never happen now. I am very sad to be getting older and older and not to be able to have what I had before.\u201d\n\nHikaru is one of dozens of Okuma residents now living in purpose-built pre-fab homes on higher ground above his old street. His original home remains in a hot zone, and he is only allowed inside it for a maximum of 30 days a year.\n\nDoctors have warned him that any longer would expose him to a higher risk of illnesses like thyroid cancer.\n\nIt could be another five years before Okuma is fully opened. In the meantime amusement arcades, shops, restaurants, factories and car showrooms that have become sagging, overgrown wrecks are being bulldozed one by one.\n\nMost of the buildings were badly damaged by the massive earthquake which provoked the 16-metre high tsunami surge.\n\n(Image: Andy Stenning / Daily Mirror)\n\n(Image: Andy Stenning / Daily Mirror)\n\nAround the town, police officers wearing masks stand at checkpoints, blocking entry to streets where Geiger counter readings are still dangerously high.\n\nTrains still stop short of Okuma, and the railway line is being engulfed by the forest which has swallowed up much of the contaminated region.\n\nAnother resident, grandmother, Youko Takano, 71, has opened up a cafe in nearby Namie in an attempt to revive the area's fortunes.\n\n\u201cI remember the earthquake well,\u201d she says. \u201cEverything was moving, I couldn't even stand. I used to work in the cafe at a dormitory for power station workers. First I was moved to the edge of town, and then we were shifted even further as the radiation kept spreading.\n\n\u201cI had to leave everything, many precious things like the traditional memorial to my parents which was like a shrine.\n\n\u201cIt was so hard being in an unknown strange place where I didn't want to be.\u201d\n\nYouko says she is one of fewer than 1,000 of the pre-tsunami population of 24,000 to come back.\n\n(Image: Andy Stenning / Daily Mirror)\n\n(Image: Andy Stenning / Daily Mirror)\n\nShe tells me she opened the cafe because there was \u201ca need for somewhere to go\u201d in the eerily empty town.\n\n\u201cMost of my friends have still not moved back, which makes me very sad,\u201d she adds. \u201cMost of their homes are uninhabitable now. I was born and brought up here and I never wanted to leave.\u201d\n\nDuring the evacuation of hospitals and nursing homes inside the zone, 51 patients and elderly people died.\n\nOnce a bustling commuter town for the massive power station, Okuma is now a place of shadows.\n\nThere is hope of new life though.\n\nFurther up the coast, I stop at a beach which was closed off because of radiation pollution fears until earlier this year.\n\nTakuya Yasukawa watches his three young children, Yunon, 10, Yua, eight, and Yuo, five, frolicking in the sea where he too used to play.\n\n(Image: Andy Stenning / Daily Mirror)\n\n(Image: Andy Stenning / Daily Mirror)\n\nSurfers Akiko and Toshio Kanomi run through the swell.\n\nThe most visible signs of rejuvenation are the huge solar panel farms which have been put in former paddy fields.\n\nFearing another tsunami, farmers decided not to replant rice on the vulnerable land.\n\nBut the solar panels will provide genuinely clean electricity for the people who have moved back here.\n\nNo one wants to be reminded of the nuclear power plant which has ruined so many lives.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: The Daily Mirror's Special Correspondent Tom Parry and photographer Andy Stenning got rare access inside Japan's highly radioactive Fukushima nuclear plant eight years after a tsunami triggered catastrophic meltdowns", "authors": ["Tom Parry", "Image", "Andy Stenning", "Daily Mirror"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20394953.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Fukushima-Nuclear-Power-Station.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
