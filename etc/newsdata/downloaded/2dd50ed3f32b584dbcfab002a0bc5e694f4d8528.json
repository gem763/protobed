What do protesters want?\n\nThe city\u2019s legislature will only be able to amend or repeal the legislation after implementation.\n\nIf approved, the new law would take effect within a short time, one source said, adding: \u201cThere\u2019s no point waiting until next week.\u201d\n\nProtesters (with vendetta masks) hold an anti-government rally in Causeway Bay during the 70th anniversary The People\u2019s Republic of China on October 01, 2019.
