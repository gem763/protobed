McKie thought hard for the right words as they raced through his mind, trying to craft the perfect pep talk to assert points of emphasis for the Owls as they headed into summer.\n\nOnce McKie gathered the Owls the next day after a workout, he had his approach down.\n\n\u201cI blew the whistle like I\u2019m this badass,\u201d McKie said. \u201cC\u2019mon, hurry up! Couple of guys were walking, jogging. I just wanted to set the tone.\u201d\n\nMcKie stood at Temple\u2019s huddle, surveyed his new team and, well, blanked. He forgot what he wanted to say.\n\n\u201cI just said, \u2018How\u2019s everybody feeling? Good morning,\u2019\u201d McKie said, laughing.\n\nMcKie even struggles to find the words of appreciation he has for landing a dream job as just the third head coach for Temple since Hall of Famer John Chaney was hired in 1982. He learned at the knee of Philly high school coaching great Bill Ellerbee. He played for Chaney and came within a win of the Final Four. He nearly won a championship with his childhood team, the 76ers, as a super sixth man under Larry Brown. And he studied as Fran Dunphy\u2019s successor.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s happening. It\u2019s moving fast,\u201d McKie said. \u201cIt\u2019s like, this is your life. I was a Philly kid. I went to Temple. I talk to some of these guys just about the honor it is to be able to coach this university. But the path I had to go on to get here wasn\u2019t an easy path, by no means.\u201d\n\nMcKie joined Temple\u2019s staff in 2014 and spent last season as head coach-in-waiting as the choice to replace Dunphy, who left the program after 13 seasons and eight NCAA Tournaments. He gets his shot to revitalize a program that has just two tournament berths since 2013 and was picked to finish seventh this season in the American Athletic Conference. Temple barely matters in a Philly winter sports landscape that is dominated by the Philadelphia Eagles and in a city basketball sphere that has seen rival Villanova blossom into the upper echelon of college programs.\n\nHe has to make the Owls matter again, as much as he needs to make them winners.\n\nMcKie is also among the crop of former NBA stars that turned to college coaching, among them Penny Hardaway and his top-ranked recruiting class at AAC favorite Memphis and Patrick Ewing at Georgetown. The 47-year-old McKie finished a solid NBA career in 2007, so long ago that he\u2019s a YouTube search for recruits to know exactly who they\u2019re dealing with when he walks through their door. A starter for all 92 career games, he averaged 17.9 points and led the Owls to 60 wins, three NCAA Tournaments and was a first-round pick by Portland in 1994. Then again, those teens could be playing NBA 2K20 and recognize him from the 2000-01 Sixers team when gamers want to use their controller for a crossover and play as Allen Iverson.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still relevant because of AI,\u201d McKie said. \u201cA lot of kids, they play the 2K game and they play as AI. All these kids grew up watching him and loving him. They end up seeing me on the screen.\u201d\n\nIverson and McKie starred on the last Sixers team to play for the championship in \u201801. Iverson, the league MVP and future Hall of Famer, and McKie, the NBA sixth man of the year, formed a familial bond in Philly that has lasted decades. When Iverson clashed with Brown (yes, over practice, and other grievances), McKie stepped in with brotherly, off-the-court mentoring that kept the tempestuous guard in line.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll never disrespect him by taking away from what he did for me to be able to wear this ring,\u201d Iverson said, flashing his Hall of Fame ring. \u201cHe had so much to do with that, as far as the mental part. All of the things that maybe coach couldn\u2019t get through to me, he got through to me. In some way, I think coach was probably getting messages to me through him. He knew that I wouldn\u2019t take anything that (McKie) said to me the wrong way. I would look at it as something positive.\u201d\n\nIverson said \u201cknowing how much he cared about me\u201d made it easy to listen to McKie, and the Owls would be wise to do the same.\n\n\u201cBecause of his voice,\u201d Iverson said. \u201cHe\u2019ll tell you, I still did all of the things that I did. But his thing was, with the talent that I have, you can do all of those things that you do, but this is how you do it. The physical ability is there. But he gave me so much as far as just thinking instead of just doing and reacting and going off, \u2018OK, I\u2019m Allen Iverson, I\u2019ll just do it this way.\u2019 No, you can still be Allen Iverson, but do it this way. Do it this way quietly instead of doing it loud. The results are still going to be the same.\u201d\n\nResults. The Owls want better ones after they went 23-10 last season and were knocked out by Belmont in the First Four. Temple 1,000-point scorer Quinton Rose (16.3 points) made the AAC preseason first team, and is one of the holdovers who believed McKie would make a smooth transition from top assistant to top man on the bench.\n\n\u201cCoach McKie\u2019s younger, so naturally he\u2019s more into it,\u201d Rose said.\n\nMcKie has embraced his predecessors; he sought advice from the 87-year-old Chaney and recently invited Dunphy back to give a preseason talk to the team. Dunphy found the right words, reminding the Owls to be good teammates. He also hired Temple career leading scorer Mark Macon as an assistant coach.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a Temple community looking over my shoulder. I\u2019ve got a Philadelphia community that\u2019s looking over my shoulder,\u201d McKie said. \u201cIf I can get any advice, especially from coach Dunph, I want them to come in and give it.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s one more confidant McKie wanted to pop by North Philly - there\u2019s an open invitation for Iverson to come and talk about practice.\n\n\u201cI would love to do it, not to repay nobody because you don\u2019t repay your friend,\u201d Iverson said. \u201cBut it\u2019s like, he\u2019s always there for me, I\u2019ve got to always be there for him.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Aaron McKie stayed up all night before he was set to address Temple for the first time as head coach.
