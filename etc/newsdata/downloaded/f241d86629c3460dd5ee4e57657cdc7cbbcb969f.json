Unintentional use is no defense. People trust that their personal data \u2013 email addresses and phone numbers \u2013 are safe in the hands of tech companies, who have a legal duty to keep it safe.\n\nAll of Twitter\u2019s 140 million users could have been affected by the alleged \u201cmistake\u201d but the firm has yet to publish any official figures on the issue. Silkie Carlo, of privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch, called Twitter\u2019s latest mistake a \u201cprofoundly disappointing reflection\u201d on the attitude that social media firms have towards user privacy, security, and data rights.\n\nAlan Woodward, a data privacy expert at the University of Surrey, criticized the firm for failing to notify individual users about whether or not their personal data had been used for targeted advertising. Woodward stated: \u201cThe fact that Twitter may have passed on your telephone number doesn\u2019t undermine the security of the two-factor authentication process really. It\u2019s more a trust issue now: should I minimize the amount of data I give to big tech companies even if it might keep me secure?\u201d\n\nTwitter claims to have addressed the issue as of September 17 and stated that none of the data was shared externally with its partners.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
