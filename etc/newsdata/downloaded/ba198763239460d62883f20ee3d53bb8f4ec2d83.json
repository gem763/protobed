There are no formal negotiations taking place.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we know is that Angela Merkel and the EU have said, \u2018give us your proposal,\u2019 and we have not given them a proposal,\u201d she told the BBC.\n\nTreasury chief Sajid Javid insisted that the government was \u201cstraining every sinew to get a deal\u201d and had sent British negotiator David Frost to Brussels for talks. The EU, however, says Britain has not produced any concrete new ideas.\n\nRudd\u2019s resignation as work and pensions secretary late Saturday is the latest blow to the embattled British prime minister.\n\nJohnson says Britain must leave the EU as scheduled Oct. 31 even if there is no divorce agreement with the bloc. But his plan is meeting fierce resistance, including from some members of his own party.\n\nLast week Johnson kicked 21 lawmakers out of the Conservative group in Parliament after they sided with the opposition to pass a law designed to prevent a no-deal Brexit. Those expelled included the longest-serving Conservative in Parliament, Ken Clarke, and Nicholas Soames, grandson of World War II Prime Minister Winston Churchill.\n\nRudd called the expulsions \u201can assault on decency and democracy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Conservative Party should be a moderate party that embraces people with different views of the EU,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we become a party which has no place for moderates like I am, center-right conservatives, then we will not win.\u201d\n\nJohnson is seeking a snap election on Oct. 15 as a way to break the deadlock over Brexit, but lawmakers last week rejected his call for an early poll.\n\nHe is due to try again Monday, but opposition parties say they will veto that attempt, too. They want to postpone an election until Britain has secured a delay to the Oct. 31 Brexit deadline, removing the risk the U.K. could crash out without a deal.\n\nOpposition Labour Party finance spokesman John McDonnell said \u201cwe\u2019re in a situation where no-one can trust while (Johnson) is in place what could happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t believe that we can pin him down and I don\u2019t trust him an inch, and I don\u2019t think anyone does,\u201d McDonnell told the BBC.\n\nMost economists say a no-deal Brexit would severely disrupt trade with the EU and plunge the U.K. into recession.\n\nJohnson said this week he would rather be \u201cdead in a ditch\u201d than seek a postponement, leaving government and Parliament at odds \u2014 with no obvious solution.\n\nJohnson\u2019s options \u2014 all of them extreme \u2014 include disobeying the law, which could land him in court or even prison, and resigning.\n\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab said Sunday that the government would obey the law, but would also \u201ctest very carefully what it does and doesn\u2019t require.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a rough week, but the reality is the prime minister is sticking to his guns on what he said to get us out of this rut that we\u2019re in,\u201d he said.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Amber Rudd, who has quit the Cabinet, said Sunday that \"there is no evidence of a deal.
