The Bachelorette's Angie Kent apparently 'snubbed' fellow Channel 10 star Beau Ryan (right) at the network's Upfronts presentation in Sydney last Thursday\n\n'I've got to be honest, I've never really watched Bachelor or Bachelorette, I watched the Honey Badger for a bit, but I locked into The Bachelorette [this year]. I like her... I've met her at least twice... I'm a fan of her,' he said.\n\n'She walked past with her entourage, as you do when you're on The Bachelor and Bachelorette, you get an entourage out of nowhere, you know what I mean?\n\n'I've come out and I've literally said, \"Hey, Ange!\", and raised up my hand above my face for a wave. As she's walking past, she locks eyes with me for at least two seconds, maybe three seconds, and then straightens her head and walks away.'\n\nSnubbed! The 34-year-old former NRL player, who hosts the upcoming series of The Amazing Race, claimed on Friday that Angie (pictured) had completely blanked him at the event\n\nRadio host Jackie 'O' Henderson then asked: 'No hello? No acknowledgement?'\n\nBeau replied: 'She looks at me, saw me, definitely saw me. I turned around to the makeup girl and she said, \"What happened then?\" I was like, \"Did you see that?\" She did. I had no idea what happened. She brushed me!'\n\nAfter recalling the embarrassing incident, Jackie and her co-host Kyle Sandilands began debating who was more famous: Beau or Angie.\n\n'I think you think you're really famous! And you're not as famous as what you think you are,' Jackie said with a laugh.\n\nOuch! 'As she's walking past, she locks eyes with me for at least two seconds, maybe three, and then straightens her head and walks away,' Beau said on The Kyle and Jackie O Show\n\nKIIS FM's newsreader Brooklyn Ross then came to Beau's defence, saying: 'Beau is like fifty times more famous than Angie!'\n\nLater on, Kyle suggested the possibility that Angie didn't hear Beau, but the retired Cronulla Sharks star said that was definitely not the case.\n\n'I looked at her! I mouthed the words. If you were deaf you would have understood what I said. And my hand was above my face, like the Queen,' he said.\n\nDaily Mail Australia has contacted Channel 10 for comment.", "description": "The Bachelorette's Angie Kent apparently 'snubbed' fellow Channel 10 star Beau Ryan at the network's Upfronts presentation in Sydney last Thursday.", "authors": ["Jo Scrimshire For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/22/19858134-0-image-a-47_1571346657798.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
