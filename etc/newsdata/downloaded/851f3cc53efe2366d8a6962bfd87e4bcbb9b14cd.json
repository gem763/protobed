Figures show the diseases kill 15,000 patients each year.\n\nThe disease, of which there are around 100 different types, kills more than all other forms of cancer except lung and bowel.\n\nBlood cancer symptoms include looking pale, being tired, breathlessness, having a high temperature, excessive sweating and pain\n\nFormer Army colonel Trevor Llewellyn Elkins died from blood cancer in 2009.\n\nHis daughter Diana, 49, from Twickenham, has told how doctors repeatedly missed 'typical' signs of his disease, including a persistent cough, back pain and a rash.\n\nShe said: 'He had symptoms for 12 months and went to the GP several times to be told he had things ranging from gout to Lyme disease \u2013 never blood cancer.'\n\nMs Elkins added her late father 'trusted his GP and never made a fuss or questioned why he wasn't tested for cancer'.\n\nShe said: 'In the end he was in so much agony and could barely move that I had to take him to A&E.\n\nMr Elkins only received an accurate diagnosis after he was taken to A&E and then admitted to intensive care. He died two weeks later.", "description": "Former Army colonel Trevor Llewellyn Elkins died from blood cancer in 2009.
