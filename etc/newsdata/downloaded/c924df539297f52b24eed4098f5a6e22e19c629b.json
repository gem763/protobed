Get the ball rolling by mapping out your personal goals for tomorrow, next year and decades from now.\n\nSetting financial goals can be one of the keys to a happy and successful life over the long term. It\u2019s always helpful to have a clear idea of what you\u2019re saving your hard-earned money for\u2014and how to make it work for you.\n\nWe\u2019ve outlined a five-step plan to help you set and make progress toward your financial goals. Use this financial goals worksheet provided by Principal\u00ae as you work through each step.\n\nStep 1. Think about what you want your money to do for you.\n\nGoals help guide your plan. They don\u2019t have to be set in stone. In fact, you\u2019ll revise them throughout your life. But you need to start somewhere.\n\nEverybody wants to grow their assets, of course\u2014but how much, how fast and for what reasons? That varies from person to person.\n\nThe key questions to answer are: What kind of life do you want now and what kind of life do you want later? Here are some examples.\n\nBasic life and money goals:\n\nBuy a home. Or buy a different home if you already have one.\n\nRemodel or repair your house. Examples: A new roof, finishing your basement, updating your kitchen.\n\nPay down debt, such as loans and credit cards.\n\nBuy a car.\n\nBuild an emergency fund.\n\nPay off student loans faster.\n\nPursue hobbies and interests. Take a trip overseas every three years or become a season-ticketholder for your favorite team.\n\nDonate annually to a favorite charity.\n\nStart a new business or expand a current one.\n\nFamily-related financial goals:\n\nGet married. (Rings, honeymoon, flowers\u2014it all adds up.)\n\nPlan to have children. Think daycare, activities/sports, braces and summer camp.\n\nHelp kids with college expenses.\n\nLeave the workforce to raise a family, care for aging parents or go back to school.\n\nHelp adult children with expenses, like paying for a wedding or a down payment on a house.\n\nLeave an inheritance for your loved ones.\n\nRetirement-related goals:\n\nRetire from working full-time. (Or work part-time or retire early.)\n\nMove somewhere that has a lower cost of living, or where it\u2019s warmer or to be closer to family.\n\nPay off your mortgage before you retire.\n\nStep 2. Categorize each goal as short-, mid- or long-term.\n\nUse this as your guide to help you complete your financial goals worksheet:\n\nShort-term goals: Six months to five years.\n\nMid-term goals: Five to 10 years.\n\nLong-term goals: More than 10 years\n\nStep 3. Set a target date for each one.\n\nBeing specific helps, even if you adjust the date over time. Let\u2019s say you have a child headed to college in 2030\u2014that gives you a target date for your college savings goal. Want to take a cruise for your 10th wedding anniversary? You know what timeframe you\u2019re working toward. Add target dates to your worksheet.\n\nStep 4. Prioritize each financial goal: Critical, need or want.\n\nIt helps to prioritize, so if push comes to shove, you know what to fund first. Label each goal on your worksheet: Critical, need or want. Let\u2019s say you have a short-term goal to build up your emergency fund, and it\u2019s \u201ccritical.\u201d But another short-term goal is to trade your car, which is running just fine; it\u2019s a \u201cwant.\u201d If funds become tight one month, you know where to put your money.\n\nStep 5. Know how much you have versus what you still need to save.\n\nDo you have money in a 401(k), 403(b) or IRA? If so, log those numbers on your worksheet toward a retirement-related goal. Note: Some goals may not have current savings. That\u2019s okay. You have to start somewhere.\n\nIf you plan to buy a home in two years, and you need $15,000 more for a down payment, divide that by 24 months. Then you know to save $625 more per month toward that goal.\n\nOrganizing your finances for the long-term future may seem like a lot to tackle, but remember you don\u2019t have to do it all at once. Just take it step by step, and before you know it, you\u2019ll have a clear path to help guide you through the years ahead.\n\nThis content is paid for by Principal Financial Group\u00ae and published by WP BrandStudio.
