Her name is Dida and she\u2019s a \u201cbig tusker\u201d, one of only 30 elephants of her kind left in the world.\n\nHer extraordinary tusks sweep all the way to the ground, each weighing at least 45kg. It\u2019s those enormous ivory incisors that make her so rare. Kenya is home to 10 big tuskers along with 26 \u201cemerging tuskers\u201d who will eventually join the ranks of their elders as their tusks develop. Generations ago, elephants like Dida were regularly seen around southern Kenya\u2019s expansive savannahs, majestic and seemingly indomitable, parading the plains as if they owned them. Then the poachers came.\n\nTomorrow, World Elephant Day will highlight the plight of pachyderms across the globe. Africa\u2019s elephant population has dwindled from around 10 million a century ago to some 352,000 counted in the Great Elephant Census of 2016. Around 30,000 are poached annually while others are lost through natural deaths, drought, habitat loss and ever-increasing human-wildlife conflict. So how can we turn the tide on their tragic demise?\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

Their \u201ctenBoma\u201d initiative in the Tsavo Conservation Area (TCA) is breaking new ground, preventing poaching before it happens through a clever combination of military intelligence techniques, Maasai communities and tourism.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Elise Allart, the company\u2019s Programmes and Operations Director, explains: \u201cTui Elephant Aid was implemented in southeast Asia and Africa, two regions exposed to different threats and offering different challenges for elephant protection. Yet in both, we believe tourism can be a force for good, affecting real, long-lasting change.\u201d\n\nTenBoma takes its name from an east African saying that a community becomes stronger when 10 houses (or bomas) work together, looking out for each other. It\u2019s the brainchild of Faye Cuevas, IFAW\u2019s senior vice president. She\u2019s a lieutenant colonel in the US air force reserves and a former intelligence officer supporting counter-terrorism operations in Africa and the Middle East. Now she\u2019s applying her formidable military experience to the fight against elephant poaching, adding a new dimension to the work of the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS), which protects the country\u2019s national parks.\n\nThe Tsavo eco-system includes Tsavo East and Tsavo West National Parks along with a tapestry of Maasai communal lands, privately-owned ranches and wildlife conservancies. At 42,000sq km, it\u2019s vast, roughly the size of Switzerland, and is home to nearly 13,000 elephants, a staggering 40 per cent of Kenya\u2019s entire population.\n\nTsavo East, Kenya\u2019s biggest park, consists mostly of flat plains speckled with scrub, stretching for miles to the Sagala Hills in the distance. Driving to KWS Headquarters at Voi, we spot grumpy buffalo, zebra, frisky gazelle, ostriches, warthogs and hartebeest. We see elephants everywhere too, mums, babies, aunties and adolescents in cow herds and lone bulls, all tinged red from Tsavo\u2019s soils.\n\nTheir home is a precarious place. The parks are unfenced and have just 270 rangers between them. Elephants wander freely through communal lands, raiding crops and causing havoc for local Maasai. The poacher\u2019s weapon of choice is poisoned arrows \u2013 silent and swift, they\u2019re harder to detect than bullets. And the parks are bisected by the Nairobi to Mombasa highway, where a massive port crammed with container ships draws lorries from across east Africa, creating a major hub for the illegal wildlife trade.\n\nAt the park HQ, Faye and Daniel Osuri, KWS assistant director for Tsavo, tell tenBoma\u2019s story. Before the project started in 2015, the under-resourced KWS had filing cabinets full of yellowing logbooks and dusty crime reports. \u201cTo get ahead of poaching networks, we needed to get that data literally out of the storerooms and onto a visualisation platform to build a picture of all the information, to see where the hotspots were,\u201d Faye explains.\n\nThe poacher\u2019s weapon of choice are poisoned arrows \u2013 silent and swift, they\u2019re harder to detect than bullets\n\nIt took a year to digitise the records and map the poaching incidents. \u201cThen we put investigators and rangers in those hotspots where we knew, based on six years of data, there was a temporal uptake of poaching activity. Because of that, we zeroed out poaching in 2016 \u2013 that was huge.\u201d\n\nBefore this, KWS was reactive to poaching, recording incidents after the event. \u201cBy then it\u2019s already a conservation loss, we\u2019ve already lost the elephant and its tusks,\u201d Faye continues. \u201cBut since 2015, poaching has almost stopped in the TCA \u2013 it\u2019s down about 85 per cent.\u201d\n\nThere are still poaching incidents \u2013 three cases were recorded in Tsavo between May and June \u2013 but nothing like the scale of previous years. And elephant numbers are rising. \u201cSince we partnered with Tui, the last census showed there\u2019s been almost a 15 per cent increase in Tsavo\u2019s elephant population, another 1700 elephants, so that\u2019s massive,\u201d Faye confirms.\n\nThis proactive approach demanded increased patrols and better investigations, and that\u2019s where Tui stepped in. TCF provided KWS with motorbikes, GPS, mobile phones, binoculars and digital forensics software. They also funded training on forensic analysis and evidence gathering, including managing crime scenes, collecting samples and conducting mock trials to increase the chances of convictions.\n\nPatrols beyond the parks\n\nBut much of the Tsavo Conservation Area lies beyond the national parks in Maasai heartlands where community rangers rather than the KWS protect the wildlife. Maasai are pastoralists whose lives revolve around cattle: when pastures are sparse, they\u2019ll lead their herds into the parks \u2013 illegally \u2013 for better grazing.\n\nIn relentless heat, I join a short foot patrol with community rangers. They\u2019re also part of tenBoma: their boots, binos, smartphones, iPads, cameras and camping gear are all funded by TCF. On a regular patrol, teams of at least four might walk unarmed for 20km in an eight-hour shift. Today, an armed KWS ranger accompanies us.\n\n\u201cWe work closely with KWS, so if we sense danger, we radio our GPS points and patrol together,\u201d Wilson, a community ranger, explains. We walk quietly, checking for tell-tale signs of illegal or animal activity on the dry, baked earth. We find footprints and lion prints close by, and I\u2019m relieved to hear they\u2019re about two days old. \u201cIf we see footprints, we\u2019ll take GPS coordinates and come in darkness to see if there are lights \u2013 poachers kill using lights at night.\u201d\n\nEvery day, they collate all the data about wildlife they see, cattle grazing, and reports from local people. \u201cIf the community see an elephant carcass, they report it,\u201d Wilson continues. \u201cWe investigate with KWS \u2013 was it speared or shot or a natural death? Is there evidence of a weapon? We feed everything back into the tenBoma system.\u201d\n\nOn our patrol are two Maasai women, Eunice and Purity. In their early 20s, they\u2019re members of the new Team Lioness, the first all-female rangers\u2019 group in the region. They don\u2019t seem at all daunted. \u201cMen can do this job, but women do it better,\u201d Eunice laughed. \u201cWe like our community and want to help them. We also know the importance of animals and want to conserve them.\u201d\n\nWomen are becoming a central piece in the tenBoma jigsaw. \u201cAs a 22-year military veteran, I know the value women bring to the enforcement sector,\u201d Faye says. \u201cLocal women know what\u2019s happening on the ground. But culturally, they\u2019re more comfortable reporting to other women so it\u2019s vital there are females on the community ranger team they can talk to.\u201d\n\nPachyderm partners\n\nLater, we continue our search for Dida with a monitoring team from Tsavo Trust, an excellent NGO which works with KWS and tenBoma in protecting the pachyderms. We spot a huge bull in the distance mooching languidly towards us, his enormous terracotta-tinged tusks shining in the sun. Eventually, after waiting quietly, we get a clearer look as he moves closer. While his tusks seem massive, they\u2019re small fry in this land of giants: he\u2019s just a \u201cregular bull\u201d.\n\nThat makes him marginally less attractive to poachers: tuskers are far more vulnerable. Much-loved Satao, believed to have had the world\u2019s biggest tusks, was killed by poachers using poisoned arrows in 2014. Three years later, his namesake Satao II suffered the same cruel fate. And in May this year, Wide Satao and two other elephants were found struck by poisoned arrows. Thankfully, they were saved by Tsavo Trust and KWS, whose vet successfully removed the arrowheads.\n\nWe work closely with KWS, so if we sense danger, we radio our GPS points and patrol together. If we see footprints, we\u2019ll take GPS coordinates and come in darkness to see if there are lights \u2013 poachers kill using lights at night Wilson, a community ranger\n\nDida eludes us but we see plenty of elephants at our hotel, the Sarova Salt Lick Game Lodge. An unusual construction of 90 round rooms in two-storey buildings on high wooden walkways, its beauty lies in the waterholes and \u201cmoat\u201d around the main building that attract masses of wildlife.\n\n\u201cTsavo\u2019s an important destination for Tui,\u201d Elise Allart tells me the following morning as we drive through Tsavo West National Park to visit some Maasai communities. Smaller than its eastern sister, Tsavo West is hilly and wooded, interspersed with lakes, volcanic lava flows and views of Kilimanjaro towering in the distance.\n\n\u201cWe want to help people thrive in areas where we work and tenBoma, with its innovative and inclusive approach, was perfect for TCF,\u201d she says. \u201cThe communities are the eyes and ears of this project.\u201d\n\nMaasai and community collaboration\n\nFor all the innovative technology and techniques, it is ultimately communities that hold the key to conservation success: without them onside, and without wildlife having a greater value to them alive than dead, conservation will fail. Here in Taita Taveta county, home to some 300,000 people, tenBoma works with 15 communities.\n\n\u201cThe idea is to build a pipeline of information and intelligence from the bottom up \u2013 from communities to local rangers to wildlife services to police and regional taskforces,\u201d Faye explains. Crucially, the community rangers come from within these Maasai villages, so they\u2019re trusted by local people.\n\nInformation lies at the heart of tenBoma\u2019s success in intercepting poachers before they strike. It might come from sophisticated data analysis, from informant networks or even from village chitchat \u2013 usually poachers are outsiders. Unfamiliar tyre tracks, campfires or suspicious people in the area; elephants destroying crops or moving around villages, raising tensions; Maasai herders, often infiltrated by poachers, illegally grazing cattle in the parks. All these sometimes small details can reap substantial rewards in the fight against poaching.\n\nIn August 2018, for example, a villager from Rombo gave a tip through the reporting pipeline about suspicious people near Tsavo. This led to KWS arresting three traffickers with 234kg of ivory worth around $160,000, and to the subsequent arrest of an Italian ivory buyer just outside Nairobi.\n\nBut how do you persuade local people to give that information when their lives are so often blighted by elephants?\n\nI\u2019ve come to a Maasai community meeting outside Taveta town, held as is traditional under the shade of a huge tree. It\u2019s attended by elders, morans (warriors), and local men and women, along with KWS wardens, community rangers and tenBoma.\n\nMoses Merin, a local Maasai and tenBoma\u2019s community outreach officer, interprets as I chat to Mary, a mother of four whose stepfather and cousin were killed by elephants. \u201cI was angry and disappointed \u2013 it was so painful,\u201d she says quietly, her eyes distant and sorrowful. \u201cElephants are good animals but they kill, they attack. They block the way when my children walk to school. At night, they raid our crops. But I\u2019ve never thought of killing them. Elephants are rare. They bring tourists and income; we get developments from well-wishers coming to help our communities \u2013 these benefits are because of the elephants.\u201d\n\nTui supports the communities by funding tools to mitigate human-elephant conflict that include bright torches and powerful airhorns. Elephants fear the noise from horns so move on, allowing children to go to school again. They don\u2019t like bright torchlight at night, so they stop raiding crops, enabling a family to eat. Of course, these tools aren\u2019t a panacea to all the problems elephants cause and they may seem simple, but they help save lives in Tsavo.\n\nAs we return to our hotel, Dida and her fellow tuskers remain elusive. But we\u2019re greeted by hundreds of elephants taking turns to drink from the moat, so close I can hear every slurp and splash. Like a grand finale, the cast of tiny babies, huge bulls and every size in between are a joy to watch. I see their beauty and their gentleness, their power and their wisdom. They may not be the celebrity tuskers we were searching for, but they all have a starring role in Tsavo.", "description": "Driving along vivid terracotta-coloured tracks that cut a swathe through Tsavo\u2019s vast plains, we\u2019re searching for one very special lady.
