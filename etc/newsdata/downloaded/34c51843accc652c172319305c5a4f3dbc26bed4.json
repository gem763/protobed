Elizabeth Warren held a rally in New York, a state that is nearly impossible for Democrats to lose. On the same day, President Trump held a rally in New Mexico, a state that will be hard for Republicans to win.\n\nThose moves reveal much about how the two parties see next year\u2019s presidential race.\n\nFor Mr. Trump and his re-election campaign, a high priority is to find some states he lost in 2016 that he has at least some chance of flipping his way next year, in case Democrats manage to reclaim key states such as Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan that went Mr. Trump\u2019s way last time.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Which moment this past week has stuck with you and what do you hope the 2020 race brings this coming week? Join the conversation below.\n\nThe list of such states isn\u2019t long, but New Mexico is one, which is why Mr. Trump was there Monday. Mr. Trump lost New Mexico to Democrat Hillary Clinton by 8 percentage points in 2016\u2014but Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson, a former New Mexico governor, picked up nine points, suggesting to Team Trump there is room for an upset.\n\nThe other states on the Trump list of potential flips are New Hampshire, Nevada and Minnesota\u2014and the president has visited them all in recent months.\n\nMeanwhile, many Democrats, including in Ms. Warren\u2019s camp, instead see the priority in the 2020 race as energizing and turning out the Democratic base. If that happens, they believe, higher Democratic excitement and turnout will hold all the states Mrs. Clinton won and flip some Trump states the Democrats will need to win in the Electoral College.\n\nThus, Ms. Warren was in solidly blue New York for a giant outdoor rally\u2014and to pose for many photos with supporters. The idea was to both demonstrate and generate excitement in the liberal Democratic base.\n\nA new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll showed just how important that liberal base is to the Warren campaign. While she continues to trail former Vice President Joe Biden overall among all Democratic voters, 31% to 25%, she is easily the top choice among those who identify themselves as liberals.\n\nAmid the maneuvering, of course, the key early states of Iowa and New Hampshire are never far from candidates\u2019 minds, as will be clear when Democrats flock to Iowa Saturday for the state\u2019s traditional party steak fry.\n\nWrite to Gerald F.
