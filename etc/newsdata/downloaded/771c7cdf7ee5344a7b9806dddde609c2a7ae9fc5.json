Hinch to warn the umpiring crew that he\u2019ll take his team off the field if it happens again, says it\u2019s one thing for fans to support their team, but quite another to make it cruel and personal.\n\nAstros center fielder George Springer and shortstop Carlos Correa celebrate after winning Game 4. (Photo: Robert Deutsch, USA TODAY Sports)\n\n\u201cThere could be atmospheres where it\u2019s loud, it\u2019s electric,\u2019\u2019 Reddick said, \u201cand the outfield bleachers aren\u2019t really saying unnecessary stuff at you or your whole team. There are places you go like Tampa. Tampa was a loud atmosphere (in the Division Series), and nobody was yelling, obscene gestures about my wife, or my mother out there. That\u2019s definitely something you get when you come here. \u2026\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to find anything they can on you whether its them using Google to the best of their abilities or just picking on you with what they have at any given time.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe right-field fans stood and screamed at Reddick when he came onto the field in the first inning, but he kept his back to them, trying his best not to acknowledge them. It could happen to any opposing right fielder, Reddick says, but he also knows it\u2019s personal.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a little different for me because I\u2019m a loud-mouth and I speak my mind,\u2019\u2019 Reddick said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think they like that. I speak facts, and I\u2019m just going to talk about what I want to talk about.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a grown man, I can do it.\u2019\u2019\n\nCAREER OVER? Sabathia may have thrown his last pitch\n\n'IT'S A JOKE': Astros livid over cheating allegations\n\nYANKEE STADIUM: Astros will pull team off if fans throw stuff\n\nGAME 4: Astros on brink of World Series\n\nIf it\u2019s not enough dealing with the hostilities from the fans, the Astros are incensed that anonymous members of the Yankees\u2019 organization accused them of cheating. There were several published reports in New York that said the Astros were whistling and banging pipes in their dugout at Minute Maid Park to relay signs.\n\n\u201cWe all get sick of it because it takes away the credibility of our hitters,\u2019\u2019 Reddick says. \u201cThis is a damn good lineup and it shouldn\u2019t be shunned by people saying were cheating and whistling in the dugout.\n\n\u201cHow can you even hear whistling in a playoff game? You can\u2019t hear whistling in a playoff game from a dugout. There\u2019s no way you can do it, so it makes no sense where that comes from.\u2019\u2019\n\nWhy can\u2019t the Astros simply get credit for being one of the greatest teams in baseball the past few years, winning 115 games this year, and on the verge of their second World Series in three years?\n\n\u201cWhen I listen to the people talking about it in the business, I just laugh,\u2019\u2019 said Carlos Correa, who along with George Springer hit three-run homers. \"I just laugh because they say, 'Oh, we have something or the pitchers were tipping,\u2019 when they had nothing, sometimes. You know what I mean?\n\n\u201cWe're just watching the game. We're taking advantage of every single detail we can get. Hitting is tough. If you're tipping your pitches, fix it. If you're tipping your pitch and I can see, I'm going to take advantage of it. I'm trying to help my team win ball games, and every single edge counts.\n\n\u201cBut I think it's disrespectful that every time we score a lot of runs, people talk about tipping. Nobody was tipping today and we scored, what, eight runs? We're great hitters. We've been doing it for a whole season.\n\n\u201cYou look across the board the numbers this team has put up through a full season, it's just unbelievable how many guys have been on top of their game this year. Not every pitcher that goes out there for 162 tips.\u2019\u2019\n\nAstros MVP candidate Alex Bregman has heard the accusations for years, but shrugs them off, calling it comical.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just like, silly, honestly,\u2019\u2019 Bregman told USA TODAY Sports. \u201cWe\u2019re like, 'Come on, again? People are trying to find an excuse to why we win games.'\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be people always throwing reasons why we win, and stuff like that. To us, we know we win because were a damn good baseball team.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just go to focus on playing baseball, do our thing, and let people say what they want.\u2019\u2019\n\nLet them keep talking, Hinch said, but if you talk, be a man and put your name behind it.\n\n\u201cIn reality, it's a joke,\u2019\u2019 Hinch said. \u201cWhen I get contacted about some questions about whistling, it made me laugh because it's ridiculous. Had I known that it would take something like that to set off the Yankees or any other team, we would have practiced it in spring training.\n\n\u201cThe problem I have is when other people take shots at us outside this competition. When you guys ask me this question, my face, my name is by my quotes, my opinions, my reaction is all for you guys to tweet out and put on the broadcast. But we have people that are unnamed, or you guys have sources that are giving you information. I suggest they put their name by it if they're so passionate about it to comment about my team or my players.\u2019\u2019\n\nIf people really want to talk, maybe they turn their attention to the Yankees, a team that barely looked like they belonged on the same field with the Astros this night.\n\nThey made four errors, their most in a postseason game in 43 years.\n\nThey struck out 13 times, including 11 times from the No. 2 to No. 7 spots in the order.\n\nThey were hitless in seven at-bats with runners in scoring position, and left 10 runners on base.\n\nIt was an absolute stinker.\n\n\u201cWe played poorly tonight,\u2019\u2019 Yankees manager Aaron Boone said, \u201cthere\u2019s no other way to explain it. And we need to flush this immediately.\n\n\u201cStranger things have certainly happened, a lot stranger. We need to play a cleaner game, obviously, if we\u2019re going to beat a team like that.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Astros won\u2019t come out and say it, but they know this series is over.\n\nThey fully expect to be playing in front a subdued crowd Friday night, with most of the Yankee fans gone by the time they celebrate the American League pennant.\n\nThe Astros know they need to win one more game, but with Verlander on the mound, they\u2019d love to end it early, making sure they will have a rested bullpen with Cole going in Game 1 of the World Series.\n\n\u201cWe have all of the faith in the world in him,\u2019\u2019 Reddick said. \u201cWe want him to on the mound. It would make it so much sweeter to do it [Friday], go home, spend time with the family, and get ready for the World Series.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s get it done right here.\u2019\u2019\n\nA silent Yankee Stadium may never sound more beautiful.\n\nFollow Nightengale on Twitter @Bnightengale", "description": "After an 8-3 victory in Game 4 of the ALCS, the Astros were able to quiet the fans in the Bronx after another loss.", "authors": ["Bob Nightengale", "Published A.M.
