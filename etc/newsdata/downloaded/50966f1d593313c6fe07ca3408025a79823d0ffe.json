At 92-58 with 12 games left, Minnesota is assured of its best record since finishing 94-68 in 2010.\n\nGiven an extra day of rest between starts, Berr\u00edos (13-8) allowed two runs and five hits in 7 1/3 innings with eight strikeouts and two walks. He was rewarded with a standing ovation when he was removed.\n\n\u201cEvery outing I\u2019m feeling better and better,\u201d Berr\u00edos said through a translator. \u201cMy arm was feeling great today.\u201d\n\nBerr\u00edos\u2019 188 1/3 innings are four shy of his career high, set last year. The two-time All-Star has changed his postgame routine in order to stay fresher between starts.\n\nHe pitched into the eighth inning for just the fifth time this season.\n\nTyler Duffey finished the eighth, and Sergio Romo allowed Eloy Jim\u00e9nez\u2019s homer leading off the ninth before getting an out. Taylor Rogers needed just eight pitches to finish a six-hitter for his 27th save in 33 chances.\n\nFollowing a weekend series against the Indians, Minnesota started a final stretch against teams with losing records: the White Sox, Kansas City and worst-in-the-majors Detroit.\n\nWhite Sox starter Reynaldo L\u00f3pez gave up five runs and nine hits in 5 1/3 innings.\n\n\u201cI was feeling good today,\u201d L\u00f3pez said through a translator. \u201cI missed quite a bit with first-pitch strikes, and that got me into some trouble.\u201d\n\nJos\u00e9 Abreu\u2019s sacrifice fly in the first and James McCann\u2019s homer in the second gave Chicago a 2-0 lead, but the Twins tied the score in the bottom half on Jorge Polanco\u2019s sacrifice fly and Nelson Cruz\u2019s RBI single.\n\nAfter Garver put the Twins ahead for good, Luis Arraez hit a cue shot off the end of his bat that curved past third baseman Yo\u00e1n Moncada for a two-run single in the sixth. Moncada appeared to be in position to make a play before the ball spun to his left and into the outfield.\n\n\u201cWhen he hit that ball, I don\u2019t think anybody realized it was going to do that, us included,\u201d Baldelli said. \u201cIt was just a very unusual ball off the bat.\u201d\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nTwins: 1B Marwin Gonzalez went 1 for 4 in his return from an abdominal injury that had sidelined him since Aug. 27. \u2026 INF Ehire Adrianza, who strained his right oblique on Thursday, hopes to start taking swings this weekend and remains optimistic he may play again during the regular season is over. \u2026 RF Max Kepler was out of the lineup for the second straight game with left shoulder soreness. \u2026 1B C.J. Cron might need some time off to rest his injured right thumb, according to Baldelli.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nWhite Sox RHP Lucas Giolito was scratched from his scheduled start Tuesday because of a mild lat strain and will miss the rest of the season. LHP Ross Detwiler (2-5) will start against LHP Martin P\u00e9rez (10-7). A first-time All-Star, Giolito finished 14-9 with a 3.41 ERA. \u201cHe created a great foundation for himself going forward to be a very important part of a good team going forward,\u201d Chicago general manager Rick Hahn said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "As the Minnesota Twins move closer to a postseason berth, Jos\u00e9 Berr\u00edos' confidence grows.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tyler Mason"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/16/white_sox_twins_baseball_12061_c0-195-4767-2974_s1770x1032.jpg?39989ab7fafe5868608a9efe6e4707bd9e6694b2", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
