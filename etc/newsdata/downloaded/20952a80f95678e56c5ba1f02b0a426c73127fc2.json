For 23 hours a day she won't be able to see the sunlight.'\n\nIn an interview with Dr Phil on Friday, Allison Jean said she thought Guyger would be sentenced to at least 25 years for shooting dead her son in his Dallas apartment after mistaking it as her own\n\nAmber Guyger (right) was sentenced to 10 years prison on Wednesday for fatally shooting 26-year-old Botham Jean (left) in September 2018 when she claims to have mistakenly entered his apartment believing it was her own\n\nAllison was joined for the interview by her husband Bertrum and their other two children Allisa and Brandt.\n\nThe entire family said they were shocked by the sentence and had been expecting more prison time for Guyger.\n\n'I would have felt better if it was anything more than 15 years. With 10 years it was a shock. I felt hurt, I felt like I buried my brother all over again,' Allisa said.\n\nAllison and Bertrum also spoke of the harrowing moment they were forced to watch body cam footage of their dying son after he was shot by Guyger.\n\nA heartbreaking image emerged during Guyger's murder trial in Dallas last week of the victim's parents cowering and covering their ears in the courtroom.\n\nThe footage had been played a day earlier but Jean's family left the courtroom before it was shown. Judge Tammy Kemp asked to see the video again the next day but forgot to warn his parents.\n\nJean's parents - who were visibly upset when they unwillingly saw the footage - said the image of their son's final moments kept replaying in their heads.\n\n'The first time it came on we left the room and there was an understanding with the prosecution team that any time footage was shown they would give us sign so we went out,' Allison told Dr Phil.\n\n'When (the judge) asked for a replay, I thought it was just of the corridor so we stayed in.\n\n'When I saw they were going into the apartment I didn't want to disturb the court so I closed my eyes.'\n\nBotham Jean's parents Allison and Bertrum spoke to Dr Phil of the harrowing moment they were forced to watch body cam footage of their dying son after he was shot by Amber Guyger\n\nA heartbreaking image emerged during Guyger's murder trial in Dallas last week of the victim's parents, Bertrum and Allison Jean, cowering and covering their ears in the courtroom when the footage was played\n\nAllison said she heard a lull and assumed the footage had been stopped because there was no sound.\n\n'I opened my eyes and there he was on the floor. It is was really disturbing because it was exactly what I didn't want to relive. I didn't want to see him in that state,' she said.\n\n'As soon as I opened my eyes that was on the screen.'\n\nWhen Dr Phil asked how many times Allison had seen the image in her head since, she replied: 'Over and over'.\n\nFollowing Allison and Bertrum's emotional reaction in court, Judge Kemp could be seen covering her mouth - seemingly in shock - before quickly apologizing for the error.\n\n'I'm so sorry I didn't even give any thought to the alleged victim's family being here,' she told the courtroom.\n\nThe footage showed two officers arriving at Jean's apartment after Guyger called 911 to report the shooting in September 2018.\n\nOfficers could be seen running towards the apartment as Guyger screamed out that she was off-duty. Guyger was standing near the front door when the officers arrived and could be heard saying: 'I thought it was my apartment'.\n\nThe footage showed the two officers immediately rendering CPR to Jean who was shown lying on the floor surrounded by blood.\n\nJean's siblings, Allisa and Brandt, told Dr Phil they did want to see the graphic footage in order to see exactly what happened to their brother.\n\nHis sister said it was somewhat comforting to know Jean was unconscious at the time and may not have been suffering in pain.\n\nAmber Guyger was shown (left) in police body camera footage played to the jury during her murder trial as first responders arrived to the Dallas apartment where she shot her neighbor Botham Jean last year\n\nGuyger was captured on an officer's body cam standing in the corridor outside on her phone as CPR was being given to Jean inside, according to prosecutors\n\nGuyger was sentenced on Wednesday to 10 years in prison after being convicted of murdering Jean.\n\nEarlier on Friday, Jean's brother Brandt spoke to Good Morning America about the astonishing moment he embraced Guyger in the court room.\n\nIn a remarkable act of forgiveness, Brandt told his brother's killer that he loved her and he didn't want to see her jailed just moments after she was sentenced.\n\n'In usual instances the words mean something but I didn't think that was enough,' Brandt said of the moment he decided to hug Guyger.\n\n'That was just my gesture... of letting her know I truly forgive her. No one else's way, just my decision.\n\n'Each and everyone has steps to get to where it's forgiving. I went through those faster than others. Understand she is a human being. She still deserves love. She made a mistake that she probably truly regrets.\n\n'I waited one year to hear I'm sorry and I'm grateful for that.'\n\nSpeaking to Dr Phil, Brandt admitted that he didn't know the cameras were on when he made the gesture and had assumed he was only speaking to Guyger.\n\nThe scenes from inside the courtroom when Guyger was sentenced for the September 2018 shooting death of Jean in his own apartment quickly prompted widespread reaction.\n\nThe jurors on the case only learned about the hug between Jean's brother and Guyger the following day.\n\nJean's 18-year-old brother Brandt Jean was interviewed separately on Good Morning America on Friday where he spoke of the astonishing moment he embraced Guyger in the courtroom following the sentencing\n\nIn a remarkable act of forgiveness, Brandt embraced Guyger and told his brother's killer that he loved her and he didn't want to see her jailed\n\nThey have also since spoken out, saying that news of the hug made them feel comfortable with their decision to sentence Guyger to 10-years in prison.\n\nTwo of the jurors revealed to Good Morning America that deciding on Guyger's punishment was 'one of the hardest things' they've had to do and that they thought about what the slain 26-year-old would have wanted for the cop that fatally shot him.\n\nGuyger was facing anywhere between five years to life in prison after she shot dead Jean in his own Dallas apartment in September 2018 when she mistakenly entered thinking it was her own.\n\nProsecutors had pushed for a 28-year sentence but jurors on Wednesday settled on a decade instead - a decision some had argued didn't equate to justice for Jean.\n\n'They were asking for 28 years. I'm going to honest and true, I can't give her 28 years. I know a lot of people aren't happy about the 10 years but I felt this case was not like any other case,' the black female juror said.\n\n'You can't compare this case to any of those other officers killing unarmed black men. Those officers that killed unarmed black men, when they got out they went back to living their lives.\n\n'Amber Guyger, ever since she killed that man, she hasn't been the same. She's shown remorse. She's going to have to deal with that for the rest of her life.\n\n'One thing Botham can teach us all is that we should all love each other instead of hate each other. If Botham would have gotten just shot and not killed, I think he would have forgiven Amber Guyger.'\n\nHer fellow juror, a white male, said there was a lot of crying when they were trying to decide on Guyger's punishment following an emotional week-long trial.\n\n'After hearing about how his family talked about him... he was kind and caring and forgiving. I told everyone, I'm really having a hard time with this because we all agree it was a mistake and I don't Bo would want to take harsh vengeance,' the male juror said.\n\n'There's no way we could ever know what he would want. But I think we all had to make a decision that we could live with.\n\n'I felt like he would forgive her.'", "description": "In an interview with Dr Phil on Friday, Allison Jean said she thought Guyger would be sentenced to at least 25 years for shooting dead her son in his Dallas apartment after mistaking it as her own.", "authors": ["Emily Crane For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/17/19307142-0-image-a-339_1570207709182.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
