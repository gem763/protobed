In a tweet, Trump said he had declassified the image of the dog, but not her name.\n\nSyrian Kurds say spy stole Baghdadi\u2019s underpants for DNA test Read more\n\nBut according to a report in Newsweek, citing multiple Pentagon sources, the dog\u2019s name is Conan \u2013 after the comedian Conan O\u2019Brien \u2013 and is female.\n\nBaghdadi, one of the world\u2019s most wanted men, died on Saturday night during a US operation in the Syrian province of Idlib. Cornered by US forces, the 48-year-old detonated a suicide vest \u2013 killing himself and three children.\n\n\u201cWe have declassified a picture of the wonderful dog (name not declassified) that did such a GREAT JOB,\u201d Trump wrote.\n\nDonald J.

He told media on Sunday: \u201cOur K-9, as they call \u2013 I call it a dog, a beautiful dog, a talented dog \u2013 was injured and brought back.\u201d\n\nAt a press conference on Monday, General Mark Milley, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff told reporters: \u201cWe\u2019re not releasing the name of the dog right now \u2026 the dog is still in theatre.\u201d\n\nThe defence secretary, Mark Esper, said the dog \u201cperformed a tremendous service, as they all do\u201d.\n\nThe US military commonly uses the Belgian Malinois to guide and protect troops, search out enemy forces and look for explosives. The breed is prized for its intelligence and ability to be aggressive on command, said Ron Aiello, president of the United States War Dogs Association.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the kind of dog you want to lead a patrol like this,\u201d said Aiello, a former Marine dog handler whose organisation helps active duty and retired military dogs. \u201cThey are the first line of defence. They go out front.\u201d\n\nNot releasing the name makes sense as a security precaution for the same reason you wouldn\u2019t identify the troops who take part in the raid, he said. \u201cThere could be retaliation.\u201d\n\nA Belgian Malinois service dog named Cairo accompanied US Navy SEALs in the 2011 raid that killed Osama bin Laden, the leader of al-Qaida, in Pakistan.
