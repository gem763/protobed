Health officials have warned the drops are 'unacceptable' and 'concerning'\n\nMr Hancock, who earlier this year suggested that unvaccinated children could be banned from school, described the NHS statistics as 'unacceptable'.\n\nHe said: \u2018The loss of our measles-free status is a stark reminder that devastating diseases can, and will, resurface.\n\n\u2018We need to be bold and I will not rule out action so that every child is properly protected.\u2019\n\nThe Department of Health and Social Care said it was considering a range of options to combat the decline \u2013 including mandatory vaccination.\n\nThis could force parents to prove their four or five-year-old has had their vaccinations before they can start school.\n\nMr Hancock has said he cannot rule out the possibility of banning unvaccinated children from schools and nurseries.\n\nBut there are concerns such a policy could mean vulnerable children are excluded from mainstream education.\n\nLast night, the National Education Union warned that schools \u2018should not be expected to police vaccination records\u2019.\n\nAlmost all of the 20 areas with the lowest levels of MMR coverage at the age of five were in London, figures have revealed. Only Surrey, which ranked 20th lowest with 79 per cent, was outside of the capital city\n\nHOW DID RATES OF THE 13 VACCINATIONS CHANGE LAST YEAR? Vaccine (age) DTap-Hib (12mo) PCV (12m) Rota (12m) MenB (12m) DTaP-Hib (24m) MMR1 (24m) Hib/MenC (24m) PCV booster (24m) DTap-Hib (5yrs) DTap-Hib boost (5y) MMR1 (5y) MMR2 (5y) Hib/MenC (5y) 2017-18 (% coverage) 93.1 93.3 90.1 92.5 95.1 91.2 91.2 91 95.6 85.6 94.9 87.2 92.4 2018-19 (% coverage) 92.1 92.8 89.7 92 94.2 90.3 90.4 90.2 95 84.8 94.5 86.4 92.2 Source: NHS Digital\n\nBut it said schools have a \u2018role to play\u2019 in countering the \u2018pseudo-science championed by anti-vaccination campaigners\u2019.\n\nFor individual jabs, which are spread across 13 time measures, the decreases from last year ranged from drops of 0.2 to 1 per cent.\n\nThe worst change was for the DTap-IPV-Hib, known as the six-in-one, among one-year-olds, which dropped by one percentage point to 92.1 per cent.\n\nUptake for this is now at its lowest level since 2008-09 and last year was the biggest fall since it came into use in 2006.\n\nThe smallest fall was for the Hib/Meningitis C protection among five-year-olds, which dropped 0.2 per cent from 92.4 to 92.2.\n\nCoverage for the single dose of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine by the age of five is 94.5 per cent, down from 94.9 per cent in 2017-18.\n\nThis is the fifth year in a row MMR coverage has fallen and means the rate has sunk further below the 95 per cent target set by the World Health Organization.\n\nTo give full protection, however, children should have two doses of MMR by the time they're five, and only 86.4 per cent of children had received this last year.\n\nBritain this year had its \u2018measles-free\u2019 status revoked by the WHO after the number of cases quadrupled in 12 months. There were 231 cases from January to March this year.\n\nSenior GPs this month called for children to be banned from primary schools unless they had received the MMR jab.\n\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said he would consider 'bold action' such as taking children out of school if they haven't had the proper vaccinations to protect themselves and others\n\nWHERE HAVE THE FEWEST CHILDREN HAD BOTH MMR JABS BY AGE FIVE? Westminster (64.1%) Hackney (65.7%) Kensington/Chelsea (66.7%) Croydon (67.7%) Camden (68.4%) Merton (68.6%) Newham (68.7%) Hammersmith/Fulham (70.9%) Haringey (71.2%) Redbridge (71.5%)\n\nWHERE HAVE THE MOST CHILDREN HAD BOTH MMR JABS BY AGE FIVE? County Durham (96.4%) Cumbria (95.7%) Barnsley (94.9%) NE Lincolnshire (94.8%) North Tyneside (94.5%) Dorset (94.3%) Trafford (94.3%) Leicestershire (93.9%) Plymouth (93.9%) Rochdale (93.4%)\n\nIn a letter to ministers, they wrote: \u2018Schools need to check that all their pupils have been vaccinated. In other countries, certificates of vaccination are required prior to school entry.\u2019\n\nProfessor Stephen Powis, national medical director at the NHS, said: \u2018Vaccines are a vital, life-saving part of our country\u2019s public health and the numbers of children not being vaccinated is concerning.\u2019\n\nThe nine vaccines covered by the figures include the DTap-IPV-Hib, also known as the six-in-one, which protects against diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, polio, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and and hepatitis B.\n\nCLAIM VACCINES AREN'T SAFE IS 'ABSOLUTELY WRONG' The UK's chief medical officer \u2013 the top advisor to the Government \u2013 last year criticised people spreading lies about vaccines being unsafe. Dame Sally Davies, speaking on the 30th anniversary of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) jab, said people spreading the 'myths' were 'absolutely wrong'. She said in November: 'Over 30 years, we have vaccinated millions of children. It is a safe vaccination, we know that, and we've saved millions of lives across the world. 'People who spread these myths, when children die they will not be there to pick up the pieces or the blame.' One myth is based on research done by Andrew Wakefield in the 1990s which claimed MMR led to autism, but his results were later found to be fake, and the work was called 'fatally flawed', 'fraudulent' and 'dishonest' by experts in the field. Others claim the vaccine doesn't work \u2013 but after the introduction of MMR in 1963, global measles deaths dropped, on average, from 2.6million to around 100,000, according to the WHO. The vaccine was introduced by the NHS in 1988, a year in which there were 86,001 cases of measles in England \u2013 within 10 years, in 1998, this had dropped to just 3,728 reported. The figure has fluctuated since, believed to be partly due to the Wakefield scare in the mid-90s, but in 2017 there were reports of only 1,693 measles cases in England. (Note: Figures quoted are cases reported to Public Health England and not lab-confirmed numbers)\n\nThey also measured the PCV vaccine, to protect against a pneumonia-causing bacteria; the Rotavirus vaccine; the MMR vaccine; one for meningitis C and four booster doses.\n\nMost require more than one dose before the child turns five in order for them to be fully effective. Coverage rates for second doses tend to be significantly lower than for firsts.\n\nReasons for coverage falling may include people being anti-vaxxers \u2013 believing jabs are harmful or useless \u2013 or just not making the effort to get their child to the doctor.\n\nProfessor Jonathan Ball, from the University of Nottingham, said: 'The reason that rates of immunisation have fallen is complex.\n\n'Some of it is down to misinformation of vaccine dangers that still do the circuit on social media.\n\n'But I suspect that much of it is down to the fact that we have forgotten just how serious these infections can be, and have started to think of them as simply trivial childhood infections.\n\n'We all lead busy lives and it might be tempting to put off a trip to the GPs for convenience\u2019s sake. But the importance of getting our children immunised cannot be overstated.'\n\nQueen Mary University's Dr Jonathan Kennedy added: 'It is not really surprising that MMR coverage has fallen again. Andrew Wakefield's ideas about the link between MMR and autism remain influential, despite that fact he has been struck off by the GMC and his research retracted by the Lancet.\n\n'A survey of 2,600 parents published in January by the Royal Society for Public Health shows that 21 per cent of parents in the UK think MMR causes unwanted side effects and almost 10 per cent of parents chose not to give their child the MMR vaccine, mainly because of fears about side effects.\n\n'The news that MMR rates have fallen again is really concerning. When vaccination rates for measles fall below 90-95 per cent of the population there will be outbreaks.'\n\nSpeaking on a visit to a hospital in Truro, Cornwall, last month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: 'I think there's complacency on the part of parents about the need to get that second vaccine.\n\n'But also, I'm afraid, people have been listening to that superstitious mumbo jumbo on the internet, all that anti-vax stuff and thinking that the MMR vaccine is a bad idea. That's wrong.'\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson, during a visit to a hospital in Truro, Cornwall, in August (pictured) said: 'I'm afraid people have been listening to that superstitious mumbo jumbo on the internet, all that anti-vax stuff and thinking that the MMR vaccine is a bad idea. That's wrong'\n\nWHAT WILL THE GOVERNMENT AND NHS DO TO IMPROVE VACCINATION RATES? The Department of Health and the NHS are expected to produce a comprehensive strategy for improving vaccination rates later this year. Health authorities said they will: Write to GPs to urge them to promote a catch-up vaccination scheme offering jabs to children and under-25s who missed theirs when they were young. Update information on its websites to address parents' concerns about the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, specifically using scientific evidence to address and disprove misleading claims.\n\nInvest more in 'local immunisation coordinators' to promote vaccination in families who are hard to reach and areas with low uptake.\n\nCall a meeting of social media companies, such as Facebook and Twitter, to discuss how to stop false information about vaccines spreading online.\n\nThe NHS's figures gave a geographical breakdown of the country and showed 19 of the 20 boroughs or districts with the worst MMR coverage were in London.\n\nWestminster fared worst, with just 64.1 per cent of youngsters being given both doses of the MMR jab by their fifth birthday.\n\nHackney (65.7 per cent), Kensington and Chelsea (66.7 per cent), Croydon (67.7 per cent) and Camden (68.4 per cent) rounded off the top five.\n\nAt the other end of the scale was County Durham, where the rate of five-year-olds having both MMR doses was 96.4 per cent. The rate for England was 86.4 per cent.\n\nThe NHS's medical director for England, Professor Stephen Powis, said: 'Vaccines are a vital, life-saving part of our country's public health and the numbers of children not being vaccinated is concerning.\n\n'No one should be complacent about getting their own or their child's jabs and so the NHS is taking action, with its partners, to combat the decline and to reverse the dangerous effects of complacency about vaccines.'\n\nNHS England said it would be writing to GPs to promote catch-up vaccination programmes for children and young adults who missed them, updating advice on its website to address parents' concerns about jabs, and working to develop a 'comprehensive strategy' to be published later this year.\n\nMost vaccines require more than one dose before the child turns five in order for them to be fully effective. Coverage rates for second doses tend to be significantly lower than for first doses (stock image)\n\nThe NHS figures comes as the UK was one of four countries to this year lose its 'measles eliminated' status from the World Health Organization.\n\nThis is awarded to countries which have managed to almost completely prevent the spread of the infection for three years.\n\nAs well as the UK, Greece, Albania and the Czech Republic also lost their elimination status as the countries battle against rising numbers of people catching the illness.\n\nPublic Health England's head of immunisation, Dr Mary Ramsay, added: 'Although these changes are small proportions, these are big drops in terms of public health.\n\n'The trend is a concerning continuation of what we\u2019ve seen in the last five years.\n\n'No parent should be in any doubt of the devastating impact of these diseases. It\u2019s vital that everyone recognises the value of vaccines and takes up this life-saving offer.'\n\nIN WHICH BOROUGHS AND COUNTIES OF ENGLAND ARE CHILDREN LEAST LIKELY TO HAVE BEEN VACCINATED AGAINST MEASLES, MUMPS AND RUBELLA?
