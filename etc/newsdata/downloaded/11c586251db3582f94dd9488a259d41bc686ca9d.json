Simpson and other divers tend to this underwater nursery as gardeners mind a flower bed \u2014 slowly and painstakingly plucking off snails and fireworms that feast on immature coral.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhen each stub grows to about the size of a human hand, Simpson collects them in his crate to individually \u201ctransplant\u201d onto a reef, a process akin to individually planting each blade of grass in a lawn.\n\nEven fast-growing coral species add just a few inches a year. And it\u2019s not possible to simply scatter seeds.\n\nA few hours later, at an underwater site called Dickie\u2019s Reef, Simpson uses fishing line to tie clusters of staghorn coral onto rocky outcroppings \u2014 a temporary binding until the coral\u2019s limestone skeleton grows and fixes itself onto the rock. The goal is to jump-start the natural growth of a coral reef. And so far, it\u2019s working.\n\nAlmost everyone in Jamaica depends on the sea, including the energetic 68-year-old Simpson. Once a spear fisherman and later a scuba-diving instructor, he started working as a \u201ccoral gardener\u201d two years ago \u2014 part of grass-roots efforts to bring Jamaica\u2019s coral reefs back from the brink.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCoral reefs are often called \u201crainforests of the sea\u201d for the astonishing diversity of life they shelter.\n\nJust 2 percent of the ocean floor is filled with coral, but the branching structures sustain a quarter of all marine species. Clown fish, parrotfish, groupers and snappers lay eggs and hide from predators in the reef\u2019s nooks and crannies, and their presence draws eels, sea snakes, octopuses and even sharks. In healthy reefs, jellyfish and sea turtles are regular visitors.\n\nWith fish and coral, it\u2019s a codependent relationship \u2014 the fish rely on the reef to evade danger and lay eggs, and they also eat up the coral\u2019s rivals.\n\nAfter several natural and man-made disasters in the 1980s and 1990s, Jamaica lost 85 percent of its once-bountiful reefs. Meanwhile, fish catches declined to a sixth of what they had been in the 1950s, pushing families depending on seafood closer to poverty.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMany scientists thought most of Jamaica\u2019s coral reef had been permanently replaced by seaweed, like jungle overtaking a ruined cathedral. But today, the corals and tropical fish are slowly reappearing, thanks in part to careful interventions.\n\nThe delicate labor of the coral gardener is only one part of restoring a reef. Convincing lifelong fishermen to curtail when and where they fish and controlling the surging waste dumped into the ocean are even trickier endeavors.\n\nStill, the comeback effort is slowly gaining momentum.\n\n\u201cWhen you give nature a chance, she can repair herself,\u201d says Stuart Sandin, a marine biologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, Calif. \u201cIt\u2019s not too late.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSandin is studying the health of coral reefs around the world as part of a research project called the \u201c100 Island Challenge.\u201d His starting assumption was that the most populated islands would have the most degraded habitats, but he found instead that humans can be either a blessing or a curse, depending on how they manage resources.\n\nAD\n\nWhen Jamaica\u2019s fish populations began to collapse two decades ago, something had to change.\n\nIn the past 10 years, more than a dozen grass-roots-run coral nurseries and fish sanctuaries have sprung up, supported by small grants from foundations, local businesses such as hotels and scuba clinics, and the Jamaican government.\n\n\u2014 Associated Press\n\nThis story, part of a series, was produced in partnership with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science Education Department.\n\nAD", "description": "Grass-roots efforts work on bringing back from the brink the island nation\u2019s underwater ecosystem.", "authors": ["Cristina Larson"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/vWNTq7JpzlggXrSgq_NcExtsfN0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WN56CCG26MI6TLDDGALHCFKD7Y.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
