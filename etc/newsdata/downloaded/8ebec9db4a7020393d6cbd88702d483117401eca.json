The conciliatory moves appear to be efforts to create goodwill before the resumption of trade negotiations in early October.\n\nIn a positive sign, Trump and China appear \"willing to negotiate to put an end to this trade war spat,\" Stephen Innes, Asia-Pacific market strategist at AxiTrader, wrote in a note.\n\nInvestors were also optimistic of a rate cut by the European Central Bank (link)later Thursday.
