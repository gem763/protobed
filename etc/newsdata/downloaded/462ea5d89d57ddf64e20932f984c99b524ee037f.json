He did not mention the increasingly violent nature of clashes between protesters and the police, but urged demonstrators \u201cto stay on the path of non-violent protest\u201d.\n\nWeighing into an international spat over an NBA team general manager\u2019s expression of support for the protesters, Pence condemned players and executives of the basketball league who have sided with the Chinese government\u2019s criticism of the sports executive.\n\n\n\nThe league was \u201cacting like a wholly owned subsidiary of the authoritarian regime\u201d, said Pence, who also condemned Nike for pulling Houston Rockets merchandise from Chinese stores in the wake of the comments from the team\u2019s general manager, Daryl Morey.\n\n\u201cNike promotes itself as a so-called social justice champion,\u201d Pence said, \u201cbut when it comes to Hong Kong, it prefers checking its social conscience at the door.\u201d\n\nIn a speech that criticised China on multiple fronts, including its human rights record, its actions in the South China Sea and its trade and economic practices, Pence said the US government sought neither to \u201cdecouple\u201d with the country nor contain its economic development.\n\nProtesters holding US flags near an illuminated 'Free HK' sign stand at Chater Garden in the the Central district in Hong Kong. Photo: EPA\n\nThursday\u2019s speech came amid rising pressure from US lawmakers seeking action from the Trump administration on a number of China-related fronts, including pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, religious freedom in Tibet and the internment of Muslims in the country\u2019s northwest.\n\nHours after Pence spoke, US senators announced a new bipartisan bill that would prohibit American companies from selling munition equipment, including tear gas, pepper spray and rubber bullets, to Hong Kong authorities. Similar legislation, called the PROTECT Hong Kong Act, passed Congress\u2019 lower chamber last week on a voice vote.\n\nFriends of radical student protesters should help them gain perspective\n\nOne of the objectives in Pence delivering the speech now, and why it walked such a careful line between hardline statements and accommodative language, analysts said, was a bid by the administration to ward off Senate approval of another, more high-profile bill sitting in Congress: the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act.\n\nThat bill, passed by the House last week, would mandate an annual review of Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy and subject Chinese officials to sanctions for any crackdown on protesters.\n\nTrump is worried that passage of the legislation could further anger Beijing, undercutting hopes for a trade deal, they added. Some sort of agreement would allow him to claim a victory, which he badly needs amid impeachment pressure and growing criticism over his Syria policy as campaigning for the 2020 election heats up.", "description": "He also criticised Nike and the NBA for siding with China after the Houston Rocket's general manager tweeted support for the protests.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/5d0f9050-f67b-11e9-87ad-fce8e65242a6imagehires074225.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
