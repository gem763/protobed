Evans pleaded guilty Tuesday to felony assault and tampering with evidence \u2014 he turned off his body camera before beating Debose, who has an undiagnosed mental illness \u2014 while Dugan pleaded guilty to attempted abduction and misdemeanor assault, according to Cleveland.com.\n\nBoth men are currently on unpaid leave from the jail, and have agreed to resign from their positions after their sentencing in December. In the meantime, they\u2019re out on bail.\n\n\n\nEvans and Dugan were indicted by a grand jury in April as their jail became the subject of increasingly harsh state and federal scrutiny due to alleged civil rights violations and inmate deaths. Surveillance video from the assault showed Evans and Dugan dragging Debose \u2014 who was strapped to a chair at the time \u2014 into an isolation cell.\n\nPinned to the chair and unable to defend himself, the officers punched Debose in the face repeatedly. He was then left there for two hours, bleeding, according to Cleveland.com. He suffered a concussion as a result of the beating. Debose is black; the two correctional officers are white.\n\nBy the time of Debose\u2019s March 22 beating, the U.S. Marshals Service had already notified the county that the jail\u2019s conditions were \"inhumane,\" noting that inmates there told investigators they feared retaliation if they aired civil rights complaints.\n\nOne Cleveland judge had even declared he would no longer jail non-violent offenders in the Cuyahoga County jail, where six inmates had died in a four-month span. (Eight inmates died in the jail last year, overall.) The number of inmates in Cuyahoga County\u2019s jail has dropped since that declaration, but the jail is still exceeding its capacity of 1,765 inmates, according to WEWS-TV, a local ABC affiliate.\n\nDebose was initially jailed there on charges of cocaine possession and evidence tampering, according to Cleveland.com, and later charged with aggravated burglary, felonious assault, and theft. He pleaded guilty to those charges and was sentenced to two years of probation.\n\n\u201cInmates do not surrender their human dignity along with their freedom,\u201d Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost said in a statement. \u201cThese two men abused their authority to pound a prisoner strapped to a chair. We wouldn\u2019t stand for a dog to be treated like that \u2013 let alone by someone exercising the authority of the state.\u201d\n\nEvans and Dugan weren\u2019t the only corrections officers to be charged with some sort of crime last April, either. Five other correctional officers were also indicted that month on separate offenses related to allegations of beating up inmates, falsifying records, and denying inmates medical care.\n\nThe jail\u2019s former associate warden, Eric Ivey, was also indicted in April on allegations that he ordered a corrections officer to turn off their body camera during an investigation into the overdose death of an inmate in August 2018, and then falsified statements about that incident. Ivey was sentenced to probation earlier this month and has agreed to cooperate with investigators as they continue to probe the jail.\n\nDugan has also agreed to cooperate with investigators, according to Cleveland.com. Evans hasn\u2019t agreed to cooperate.\n\nCover: This Feb. 20, 2019 shows The Cuyahoga County Corrections Center, in Cleveland.
