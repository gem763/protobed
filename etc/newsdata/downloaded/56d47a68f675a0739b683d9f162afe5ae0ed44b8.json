Canadian voters are rather indulgent of leaders who occasionally don blackface, apparently.\n\nThat\u2019s just one lesson we can draw from the news that Justin Trudeau has been re-elected to a second term as Canada\u2019s prime minister. Mr. Trudeau faced numerous political headwinds, and his ruling Liberal Party lost seats. Indeed, the prime minister will this term head a minority government in the Parliament in Ottawa. But given the pitfalls he faced \u2014 many of his own making \u2014 Mr. Trudeau\u2019s victory was an impressive feat.\n\nBegin with the blackface. Young, telegenic, liberal and wildly privileged (his father, Pierre, was a long-running Canadian prime minister), the younger Mr. Trudeau has turned \u201cvirtue signaling\u201d into an art form \u2014 indeed, something approaching a governing ideology. When early in his term U.S. President Donald Trump began a clampdown on immigration, the Canadian leader took pains to point out just how different he was, outdoing even German Chancellor Angela Merkel in his showy support for immigrants, refugees and sundry other newcomers.\n\n\u201cTo those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith,\u201d he tweeted in early 2017. \u201cDiversity is our strength.\u201d He later posted a photo of a Syrian refugee with the hash-tag \u201c#WelcomeToCanada.\u201d Before that, Mr. Trudeau had even gone to the airport to meet refugees as they arrived in Canada.\n\nBut like the governor of the commonwealth, it later emerged that Justin Trudeau has a penchant for blackface. Just last month, photos of three separate incidents of Mr. Trudeau wearing blackface as a younger man emerged. The prime minister, apologetic, nonetheless admitted there might be more. \u201cI apologize profoundly. I didn\u2019t think it was racist at the time, but now I see, it was a racist thing to do,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Trudeau had earlier suffered another blow, this one to another central aspect of his public persona \u2014 that he is squeaky clean. Earlier this year, Canada\u2019s newspaper of record, the Globe and Mail, published a bombshell. The prime minister\u2019s office, it was revealed, had pressured Canada\u2019s top law enforcement official to help a Quebec-based construction company avoid corruption charges regarding its work in Libya. Mr. Trudeau hails from the Francophone province, and it appeared that he had used his official to improperly help a prominent local employer. Mr. Trudeau denied any knowledge of the affair, but his chief of staff and attorney general both resigned over it.\n\nIn Bloomberg News\u2019 estimation, with his victory on Monday, Prime Minister Trudeau \u201c[displayed] once again a remarkable ability to overcome scandal and controversy to remain in power. Trudeau\u2019s Liberal Party won 157 of Canada\u2019s 338 electoral districts, losing his majority in parliament and the popular vote, but gaining enough seats to secure a stable government with support from smaller parties. The most likely partner for Trudeau would be the pro-labor New Democratic Party, which won 24 seats, giving the two parties a combined 181.\u201d The opposition conservatives increased their seats by roughly a quarter. In fact, the conservatives actually got more votes than Mr. Trudeau\u2019s liberals \u2014 it turns out the United States isn\u2019t the only country where the party that loses the popular vote sometimes nevertheless takes power.\n\nIn his second term, Mr. Trudeau is expected to continue pursuing his liberal agenda, albeit with less latitude given his shrunken coalition. The re-elected prime minister will continue to spend heavily on social programs (running up heavy deficits, as he already has), and promoting an environmentalist outlook. The latter, though, is a tricky act for any Canadian leader to pull off, given that country\u2019s reliance on fossil fuel exports as a major industry. Though, as the blackface and corruption scandals demonstrate, Justin Trudeau has a way of getting himself out of tricky situations.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
