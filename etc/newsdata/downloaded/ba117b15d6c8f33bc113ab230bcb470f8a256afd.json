But given the time of the year, and conditions where secondary blocks and equity raisings are flying out the door, you can bet bankers will be pitching.\n\nIt comes as Macquarie's equities desk got in on the action on Thursday, handling a $370 million stake in listed salary packaging firm Smartgroup.\n\nAs first reported by this column, Macquarie was seeking buyers for 32 million shares, representing a 25 per cent stake in the company.\n\nThe block came only two days after Smartgroup had fronted fund managers at the annual Citi conference and was done at a 6.6 per cent discount to the last close. It's one that had been on watchlists since Smartgroup listed on the ASX in July 2014.\n\nAnd it's been only one day since perennial league table leader UBS sold the Lowy family's $815 million stake in Westfield Australia and New Zealand malls owner Scentre Group.\n\nIn what was a power move by UBS, coming on the same day Latitude Financial Group formally pulled its IPO, the deal was soon covered by a small handful of existing and new shareholders in the shopping centre owner.\n\nThe Swiss bank also split the $1.36 billion Ramsay Health Care trade with JPMorgan last month.", "description": "Equities desks are in a spin as the list of block contenders shortens by the day.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/94408b8ed10e678bfbdd99ce7f1eb081a412a3d1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
