She\u2019s now stockpiling to make sure she can meet the cravings of expats and other lovers of British Christmas treats in case of a no-deal Brexit.\n\nBlank is aware of the gamble she is taking: a nearby travel agency specialising in trips to the UK, she said, had recently shifted its focus on selling holidays to Ireland instead. She has already decided not to decorate the shopfront with a Union Jack: \u201cThe flag is too tied up with Nigel Farage, too tied up with anti-EU and anti-German feelings,\u201d she said. \u201cFor a while, we considered hanging a Scottish flag outside.\u201d\n\nThe frost that has descended on Anglo-German relations since the UK voted to leave the EU in 2016 has rarely felt as icy as it did last week. In a phone call on Tuesday morning, British prime minister Boris Johnson and German chancellor Angela Merkel reportedly failed to find common ground to avert a chaotic British exit from the EU, and even if the mood between Brussels and Westminster appears to have warmed a degree or two since then, the impact of the call and how it was handled afterwards will continue to make its mark in Berlin.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dale Carr, the previous owner of Broken English.

Mareike Kleine, a political scientist at Berlin\u2019s Freie Universit\u00e4t and the London School of Economics, said she was reminded of a famous incident in 1870, known as the \u201cEms dispatch\u201d, when the French ambassador told Kaiser Wilhelm I that Germany should ditch its aspirations for the Spanish throne.\n\nThe kaiser then gave the task of briefing the public with an account of the conversation to his chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, who deliberately cut out conciliatory language and dramatised the confrontational aspect, thus causing outrage on both the German and the French side.\n\n\u201cBismarck wanted a hastened response from an enemy, who had overestimated his powers,\u201d said Kleine. \u201cHis plan worked: the French launched themselves into a war they decisively lost, and in the process Prussia managed to bring the independent southern German states into the fold.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s chief adviser Dominic Cummings, suspected by many to be the source the source behind the leaks of the Merkel call, has in numerous expansive blog entries expressed his fascination with the ways the Prussian chancellor\u2019s tactics \u201cupended Europe\u201d.\n\n\u201cBut if someone in Britain really was trying to take a leaf out of Bismarck\u2019s book, it didn\u2019t work,\u201d said Kleine. \u201cMerkel didn\u2019t rise to the challenge like the French did.\u201d\n\nSome historians fear the events of last week could mark a watershed moment in Anglo-German relations.\n\n\u201cTwo narratives have dominated the British view of Germany,\u201d said Helene von Bismarck, a Hamburg-based historian specialising in British foreign policy. \u201cThere are the good Germans who will come to Britain\u2019s rescue during the negotiations, and there are the bad Germans who are pushing us around in Europe.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Last] week Downing Street gave legitimacy to the second narrative, which was predominantly used by the extreme fringe of the Brexit debate. The briefing will further poison British perceptions of Germany, and will thereby harm the Anglo-German relationship.\u201d\n\nThis is indeed a breach of trust, but it's not like Johnson had a reputation of being trustworthy before this happened Helene von Bismarck\n\nAs for the German reaction, said von Bismarck (a distant relative to Otto von Bismarck by marriage), \u201cthis is indeed a breach of trust, but it is not like Johnson had a reputation of being trustworthy before this happened.\u201d The incident, she noted, had not gained as much attention in Germany as in Britain.\n\nRichard J Evans, former regius professor of history at Cambridge University, agreed that Brexit has interfered with two strains of British thinking about its North Sea neighbours.\n\n\u201cBritain\u2019s view of Germany has oscillated historically between two different models. On one hand, there was the \u2018good Germany\u2019 of Beethoven and Goethe, the land of poets and thinkers. On the other, there was the view of Germany as an aggressive threat: first economic, then military. In the 1970s and 80s, during the wide-ranging debate on the \u2018decline of Britain\u2019, the two images were briefly fused, when the British began to admire German efficiency in industry, holding up Vorsprung durch Technik as a motto to emulate, uncoupling it from the fear of Germany as a political power,\u201d Evans said.\n\n\u201cBut since reunification in 1990 the \u2018bad Germany\u2019 has dominated in the British mind again. Fear of German domination in Europe became a symbolic expression of euroscepticism, presenting a mythical image of Britain standing alone against Europe in 1940 and again in the 21st century.\u201d\n\nIn turn, Evans said, Britain\u2019s tortuous process of extracting itself from the EU has begun to change the German view of Britain. \u201cAmong German liberals, in the broader sense of the word, British institutions and qualities such as pragmatism and common sense have been held up as the more desirable alternative to the French revolutionary model since at least 1848. Brexit has thrown all that into question.\u201d\n\nAt Berlin\u2019s Broken English shop, Antje Blank remains optimistic that Tetley tea and Colman\u2019s Mustard will sustain their appeal as political ties are strained. \u201cThere is still a large Anglophile community with a longing for rolling hills, Shakespeare and Jane Austen,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of Germans think Britain has gone a little bit bonkers, but it will be all right in the end.\u201d", "description": "Such diplomatic breakdowns date back to Bismarck and beyond, but the latest spat may mean more than flagging sales of UK delicacies in Germany\u2019s capital", "authors": ["Philip Oltermann"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6c7b951db74126c087989415dbc4345bcb99cab/51_326_4644_2786/master/4644.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1d2def5e2b320e50635d87988a2840ef", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
