Was that an effort to overturn an election?\u201d Wallace asked. \u201cNo, he was investigating stuff.\u201d\n\nWallace said he was a \u201clittle surprised at Speaker Gingrich, who I greatly respect.\u201d The impeachment investigation of President Donald Trump \u201cis the exact opposite of unconstitutional,\u201d he added.\n\nAnd Trump doesn\u2019t get to decide how that investigation unfolds. \u201cThe Constitution specifically says that impeachment is left to Congress, with very little statement as to how they want to conduct it,\u201d Wallace said.\n\n\u201cThis is the exact opposite of unconstitutional\" ~ Chris Wallace said on the House Democratic effort to impeach Trump https://t.co/v6drVFQdAE \u2014 Oliver Darcy (@oliverdarcy) October 11, 2019\n\nGingrich had insisted earlier that the House impeachment inquiry was an \u201cunconstitutional coup d\u2019etat\u201d and an underhanded plot to change the outcome of an election. (Impeachment can ultimately lead to the removal of a president from office, although the Senate declined to oust either of the two presidents previously impeached.)\n\nWallace declared those comments \u201ckind of a reach, particularly for somebody like Newt Gingrich, who was involved in the last impeachment effort.\u201d\n\nCheck it out in the video or tweet above.", "description": "The then-House speaker didn't think it was unconstitutional when he led the impeachment of Bill Clinton, Wallace said.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da1151c200000d4065000cf.png?cache=3ggcefdxl0&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
