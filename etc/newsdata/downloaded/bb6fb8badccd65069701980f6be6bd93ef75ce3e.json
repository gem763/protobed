But Trump has done so on a greater scale, and often with uglier motives \u2014 wielding the vast powers of the chief executive to settle grievances, burnish his ego and enrich himself. Never has the Oval Office seen such awesome authority deployed with such manic persistence on minute matters miles beneath it.\n\nThe forecast incident offered a tutorial: Trump tweeted misinformation about the path of Hurricane Dorian, found himself contradicted by federal weather officials, then doctored a storm map to support his error and insisted that officials corroborate his mistake. But the episode was hardly the solitary example of micromanagement gone haywire. Trump sent military brass scrambling to keep up after he announced a ban on transgender people serving in the armed forces; pushed the National Park Service to produce photographic evidence inflating the size of his inaugural crowd; threatened individual companies with tax hikes; obsessed over steel slats as the best design for his border wall; criticized the price of an Air Force One upgrade and then selected its paint colors; sought to block business mergers; oversaw the details of a military pageant he\u2019d ordered up for the Fourth of July; inserted himself into the business of the Swedish justice system to try to free a jailed American hip-hop star; directed the military to strip four of its attorneys of their medals because he didn\u2019t like the case they had prosecuted; and allowed Mar-a-Lago Club members to send feedback about the Department of Veterans Affairs directly to its managers. And that\u2019s a partial list.\n\nMicromanagement is usually a sign of a presidency in distress, a reflection of an insecure occupant in the Oval Office desperate to control events that can\u2019t be controlled and fearing for his political fate. And it\u2019s true that the trade war with China has gotten away from him and that his approval rating is just 38 percent. But Trump doesn\u2019t micromanage policy details quite the way prior struggling presidents have. Whereas his predecessors sometimes knew so much that they got obsessed with the details, Trump knows so little that microscopic concerns seem almost to be ends in and of themselves. The result allows him to breed corruption at the highest levels, damages faith in democracy and governance (which redounds to his benefit), tramples norms of presidential conduct, and produces incoherent, unsustainable policies.\n\n[Trump wants to manage the economy by personally running every business. He can\u2019t.]\n\nIt would be fruitless to search for a surefire formula for how much presidents should involve themselves in policy decisions and personnel details. Some of Trump\u2019s predecessors were so disengaged that they skirted the law (Ronald Reagan\u2019s hands-off approach opened the door to the Iran-contra scandal) or faltered in a crisis (George W. Bush\u2019s detachment during Hurricane Katrina was a contributing factor in the terrible federal response to the disaster).\n\nOther presidents were so immersed in particulars that they believed they knew more than anyone else. Sometimes, this approach worked. George H.W. Bush was careful to tell administration officials that any triumphal declaration after the Berlin Wall fell would probably weaken Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and was unacceptable \u2014 a level of personal foreign policy involvement that was responsible and prudent. Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s obsession with building more and more airplanes as the answer to Nazi militarism was animated by his detailed knowledge of advances in aviation technology and German air strength.\n\nAt other times, presidential contributions were less clear. Fearing that the U.S. military would put bombs in places that would trigger Chinese or Russian intervention in the Vietnam War, Lyndon Johnson identified bridges, airfields, factories and military convoys that he told his commanders were acceptable targets. \u201cIf we choose these army barracks 15 miles from Haiphong, how can we be certain of the accuracy of our aim?\u201d Johnson pressed.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump recently obsessed over the forecast track of Hurricane Dorian. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)\n\nYet presidential micromanagement has also been a mask for something darker. Richard Nixon used his powers to get back at his opponents (particularly in the White House press corps), a method Trump would later find useful. Nixon\u2019s desire to employ \u201cthe available federal machinery to screw our political enemies,\u201d as John Dean wrote in a White House memo, spurred the creation of an \u201cenemies list,\u201d with derogatory information that could be used to discredit the president\u2019s critics. Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.), for instance, was cast as an African American rising star with a \u201cknown weakness for white females.\u201d\n\nA focus on minutiae that shouldn\u2019t really take up a president\u2019s energy above all signals ineffective leadership of the vast federal government. Former White House chief speechwriter James Fallows revealed in 1979 that President Jimmy Carter, in some ways the antithesis of Trump, obsessed over details. \u201cCarter came into office determined to set a rational plan for his time, but soon showed in practice that he was still the detail-man used to running his own warehouse, the perfectionist accustomed to thinking that to do a job right you must do it yourself,\u201d Fallows wrote. \u201cHe would leave for a weekend at Camp David laden with thick briefing books, would pore over budget tables to check the arithmetic, and, during his first six months in office, would personally review all requests to use the White House tennis court.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s scattershot management style checks all the boxes. His peculiar brand of leadership calls attention to his businesses, punishes his perceived enemies and reinforces his notion of himself as a \u201cgenius.\u201d And his fascinations often have little to do with policymaking or other presidential functions.\n\nBy using his position to tell the world about the virtues of his various resorts, he has not-so-subtly implied that staying at a Trump property (as Vice President Pence did in Ireland this month; as Air Force crews have done in Scotland) is a way to stay in the administration\u2019s good graces. During the recent Group of Seven meeting, Trump said outright that his Doral resort in Florida would be a great venue for hosting the next G-7 summit. Reagan held the meeting in Williamsburg, Va., to highlight America\u2019s colonial heritage. Bill Clinton\u2019s was in Denver to show off the American West and Native American traditions. George W. Bush hosted it in Sea Island, Ga., an upscale resort that could be walled off from post-9/11 threats. These earlier presidents had a purpose beyond self-enrichment (or personal aggrandizement) when selecting the sites.\n\n[Trump wasn\u2019t a real CEO. No wonder his White House is disorganized.]\n\nWhen grievances are the animating factor behind Trump\u2019s micromanagement, they often concern businesses that have run afoul of him. He uses his power over federal agencies to order them (sometimes explicitly, at other times implicitly, via Twitter) to go after or defend specific companies and industries. Recently, his Justice Department announced an antitrust investigation into four automakers that had reached a deal with California to maintain emissions standards and reject Trump\u2019s desire to lower them. Shortly before taking office, Trump warned Milwaukee-based manufacturer Rexnord and other firms that if they shipped some of their operations overseas, he would tax them as a penalty. (He does not have the legal authority to follow through.) He ordered his adviser Gary Cohn and Justice officials to block a merger of AT&T and Time Warner because he despises CNN, which is owned by Time Warner. (Officials did nothing.)\n\nA section of border fencing near downtown Calexico, Calif.

Witness the Alabama hurricane tweets, or his command that the military display tanks and planes for him on and over the Mall. Trump\u2019s self-focus as a \u201cgenius\u201d who knows more than anyone around him, and can do it better than the people who are supposed to do it, led to his promotion of the border wall\u2019s raw materials and the Air Force One designs. He has also publicly pressured Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to lower interest rates, citing his own superior knowledge and calling Powell and his Fed colleagues \u201cboneheads.\u201d\n\nBut other instances of micromanaging offer Trump a way to demonstrate to his hard-right base that he is delivering on his implicit campaign promise to attack pluralism and racial, ethnic and gender diversity. In July 2017, Trump announced his military transgender ban on Twitter \u2014 defying the views of his own military leaders, yet cheering his evangelical supporters. (The decision, former Navy secretary Raymond Mabus Jr. said, was the most \u201cstark and unfounded reversal of policy\u201d in military history.) Trump also contradicted his Customs and Border Protection chief over whether Bahamians displaced by Dorian could seek refuge in the United States. Yes, said Mark Morgan, \u201cthis is a humanitarian mission.\u201d But wait, not so fast, said Trump, there could be some \u201cvery bad people.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s micromanagement covers the trifling and the consequential \u2014 and if it feels endless, that\u2019s because it\u2019s core to his leadership.\n\nFinally, his style also leads to policy confusion. On topics from refugees to family separations to Syria, gun safety, tax cuts and tariffs, Trump\u2019s micromanagement yields incoherence and whiplash. His positions are overturned in a flash, and orders are made without vetting and with no chance of being implemented effectively. His travel bans, for example, have faced constant court challenges and pushback in Congress.\n\nToward the end of his first term, President Barack Obama told journalist Michael Lewis that he was \u201ctrying to pare down decisions\u201d because there were too many. He didn\u2019t want to decide what to wear or what to eat. \u201cYou need to focus your decision-making energy,\u201d he said, and not be \u201cdistracted by trivia.\u201d He wanted only the big decisions to make it to his desk.\n\nPerhaps there is a middle ground that Trump could stake between Obama\u2019s big-picture approach and Carter\u2019s budget arithmetic. Between 7 million and 9 million people make up the federal workforce, depending on how you count. The president would do well to let some of them do their jobs.", "description": "He dives in to gratify his ego, settle grievances and enrich himself.", "authors": ["Matthew Dallek"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/V4M4KW3uNrIvjoZTlQXVSfdxIR4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3QMR3GDHHVEVDIRLFFTNLUC7IY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
