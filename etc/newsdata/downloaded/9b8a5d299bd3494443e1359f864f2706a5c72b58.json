The debate is scheduled for Oct. 15. (If enough candidates qualify to split the candidates over two nights, the second will be Oct. 16.)\n\nDEBATE DESCENDS INTO MELEE OVER HEALTH CARE, OBAMA, SOCIALISM AS DEMS STRUGGLE TO SHOW UNITY\n\nThe announcement came a day after 10 candidates sparred in the ABC News-hosted debate in Houston on Thursday night.\n\nThe moderators for October\u2019s debate will be Marc Lacey of The Times, and CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper and Erin Burnett. It will be the cable network\u2019s second Democratic debate this cycle: CNN hosted the party\u2019s July debate event in Detroit. The New York Times said it will be the paper's first presidential campaign debate in more than a decade.\n\nTo qualify for the debate, according to the DNC, candidates must meet a 2 percent polling threshold in at least four qualifying polls; they must also have a minimum of 130,000 unique donors, and 400 unique donors per state in at least 20 U.S. states.\n\nEleven candidates have qualified for the debate so far, according to The Times. They are: former Vice President Joe Biden, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Housing Secretary Julian Castro, California Sen. Kamala Harris, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, environmentalist billionaire Tom Steyer, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, and entrepreneur Andrew Yang.\n\nYANG'S DEBATE SURPRISE -- HE'S GIVING AWAY $12G TO 10 RANDOM FAMILIES, STUNNING CANDIDATES ON STAGE\n\nThat leaves several presidential hopefuls still scrapping to make the stage, including Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and self-help author Marianne Williamson, who have met the donor requirements but not the polling, threshold.\n\nOther candidates who\u2019ve met neither qualification so far are: Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, former Maryland Rep. John Delaney, and Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan.", "description": "The fourth\u00a0Democratic presidential primary debate will take place next month in Westerville, Ohio, the Democratic National Committee announced Friday, as candidates fight\u00a0to qualify for the televised showdown.", "authors": ["Alex Pappas", "Alex Pappas Is Senior Politics Editor At Foxnews.Com."], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/13/694940094001_6085900489001_6085902703001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
