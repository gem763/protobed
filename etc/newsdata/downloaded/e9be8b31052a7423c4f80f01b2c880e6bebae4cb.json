While the bulk of Cannon-Brookes\u2019 wealth is in shares in the software development group, he has in recent years branched out to external investments, including home-energy funding platform Brighte. He also outlaid more than $10 million for a stake in fintech group Tyro. He was a backer of design-your-own shoe group Shoes of Prey, which ceased trading in August. The increasingly outspoken billionaire is known to prefer a baseball cap to a tie. Farquhar, along with Cannon-Brookes, has topped the Financial Review Young Rich List since 2012, with the pair\u2019s wealth surging alongside the rising share price of their US\u2011listed group. Farquhar was tapped to join a NSW government taskforce to develop an innovation precinct near Sydney, where Atlassian employs 1200 people. He set a national house price record last year with the $71 million purchase of the Sydney mansion Elaine, only to lose the title to Cannon-Brookes, who this year agreed to pay almost $100 million for Fairwater estate right next door.\n\nAge (both)\n\n$631m\n\nAge\n\n3\n\nTim Gurner\n\nSector Property Residence Melbourne Wealth last year $465m Rank last year 5\n\nThe man behind the eponymous Melbourne property development group is looking to build on a strong 2018. Several acquisitions this year have pushed the developer\u2019s combined project value to more than $5 billion, spanning almost 7000 apartments. One of those deals is the sprawling Novotel hotel in St Kilda, which Gurner is transforming into a $500 million luxury residential precinct. Gurner has found success targeting high-end buyers wanting to downsize. He shot to infamy when he argued in a 60 Minutes interview last year that Millennials were struggling to buy a home because they were wasting money on smashed avocado on toast and $4 coffees.\n\n36\n\nSector Technology, property Residence New York Wealth last year $364m Rank last year 7\n\nOri Allon\n\n4\n\n$539m\n\nNew York-based Compass is preparing to expand outside the US, where it has continued to grow. The real estate brokerage group, co-founded by Allon, raised $US400 million in September led by SoftBank\u2019s Vision Fund and the Qatar Investment Authority, valuing the company at $US4.4 billion. Compass is the sixth-biggest player in the US with $US14 billion gross sales. Compass combines traditional real estate brokers with cutting-edge data to make property transactions more efficient. Allon, who sold his algorithm Orion to Google and a business to Twitter, was in talks to buy a stake in NBA team the Boston Celtics after leaving Hapoel Jerusalem basketball team, where he was the main shareholder.\n\nItsines and her fianc\u00e9 Tobi Pearce have hit the jackpot with their fitness app, Sweat. Designed as a personal trainer on your smartphone, Itsines and Pearce have evolved what was a Bikini Body Guide e-book into Apple\u2019s largest grossing health and fitness app. The app, which promotes 28-minute workouts, has expanded to offer training guides from US-based Kelsey Wells and yoga sessions with Sjana Elise Earp. With a combined social media reach of more than 35 million people, Sweat is available in seven languages in 155 countries. More than 30 million users have created an account. The subscription\u2011based app generated $90 million in revenue in 2017-18.\n\nKayla Itsines & Tobi Pearce\n\n5, 6\n\n27, 26\n\nSector Fitness, technology Residence Adelaide Wealth last year $63m combined Rank last year 40\n\n$486m\n\ncombined\n\nOwen Kerr\n\n$460m\n\n34\n\nSector Financial services Residence Melbourne Wealth last year $368 Rank last year 6\n\n7\n\nIn the space of four years Kerr\u2019s wealth has nearly doubled, thanks to the profits flowing from his foreign exchange brokerage company Pepperstone. Kerr and his British business partner Joe Davenport co-founded Pepperstone in 2010 and considered an ASX float before selling a chunk of the business to private equity firm CHAMP in 2016. Last year the group hired Tamas Szabo, the former Asia Pacific managing director for IG Group, as chief executive. Kerr and Davenport remain on the board. Headquartered in Melbourne, Pepperstone claims more than 75,000 clients around the world access financial markets via its platforms, trading currency, metals, commodities and indices from one account.\n\nSector Technology Residence Melbourne Wealth last year $216 combined Rank last year 9, 10\n\nThe stellar growth behind online creative marketplace Envato is set to continue, with the company planning to recruit another 100 people for its Australian operations this year, including 40 developers. Husband and wife team Collis and Cyan Ta\u2019eed started Envato with life-long family friend Jun Rung in the couple\u2019s Bondi garage in 2006. More than a decade later the business is turning over $US82.3 million. Profit took a slight hit in 2017, dipping to $US17.6 million from $US21 million as expenses grew. In July, Envato bought Placeit, a Mexican business that allows simple logo design, business card templates and t-shirt designs.\n\nCollis & Cyan Ta\u2019eed\n\n8, 9\n\n39, 37\n\n$428m\n\nPeter Greensill\n\n10\n\n$412m\n\nDebut\n\n37\n\nSector Agribusiness, financial services Residence Bundaberg Wealth last year \u2013 Rank last year Debut\n\nIt\u2019s not unusual for Greensill to call London from his sugar cane, watermelon and sweet potato farms in Bundaberg, Queensland, because that\u2019s where his older brother and fellow shareholder Lex resides, heading up supply-chain finance provider Greensill Capital. It\u2019s the latest Australian-backed company to become a $2 billion unicorn after a $US250 million capital boost from equity firm General Atlantic, in July. Peter, who has a 17 per cent stake in Greensill Capital, runs the family\u2019s farming operations which stretches to more than 2000 hectares across Queensland\u2019s Wide Bay region. Another older brother Andrew is also a shareholder in the farming business and the trio is worth more than $1 billion.\n\n$7.1b each\n\nSWIPE FOR MORE >\n\nAustralian Financial Review Interactive infographic\n\nInteractive infographic by Les Hewitt", "description": "The nation's most successful young entrepreneurs are enjoying a golden era.
