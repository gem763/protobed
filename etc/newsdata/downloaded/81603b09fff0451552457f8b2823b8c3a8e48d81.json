Thinking of it gives me the same feeling I had when the credits rolled on my first viewing of it over a decade ago. (I wonder how many other films on this list were in competition at the 2007 Cannes? What an astounding year for cinema.)\n\nAndrew Haigh\n\nUzak (2002)\n\nIt is a gentle and profoundly compassionate film, one of the best about loneliness ever made. I think about it all the time.\n\nHirokazu Kore-eda\n\nSecret Sunshine (2007)\n\nLee Chang-dong\u2019s deep insight into human nature is reflected in the film.\n\nJoanna Hogg\n\nMargaret (2011)\n\nAn epic story about a New York teenager facing a complex moral dilemma in the shadow of 9/11. It\u2019s told in a multi-faceted way that refuses to simplify or obey an overarching story, which only enhances the emotional veracity. I believe we respond to films subjectively - how, when and what mood we\u2019re in when we watch a film - has to be taken into account when we pass judgement on a film. I saw Margaret projected in perfect conditions with an open mind and heart one night in 2011 at The Rex Berkhamsted - and was completely carried away by it. All too soon watching a film like Margaret in a beautiful cinema will be an experience of the past. We must do what we can to keep cinemas alive.\n\nMike Leigh\n\nThe Death of Mr Lazarescu (2005)\n\nExemplary low-budget masterpiece about a sick old guy being carted from hospital to hospital in the middle of the night. Honest. Direct. Real. Moving. Comic. Tragic.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bradd Pitt in The Tree of Life. Photograph: Allstar/ICON FILM DISTRIBUTION/Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar\n\nRichard Linklater\n\nThe Tree of Life (2011)\n\nFor its vast ambition and meditative grace. It somehow manages to be both an intimate memory film while taking on the notion of all of existence. And I love the way it confounds and challenges perception itself.\n\nKenneth Lonergan\n\nTalk to Her (2002)\n\nThe best of anything is impossible to identify, but the movie that keeps coming to my mind is Pedro Almodovar\u2019s Talk To Her. How does he move so freely through this story? How does he attach these strange and loving characters to each other, to the music and the dance performances, to Sleeping Beauty, silent film, loneliness, innocence, fetishism, and the colour red?\n\nLucrecia Martel\n\nFamilia Sumergida (A Family Submerged) (2018)\n\nBecause it reveals eternal life in family conversations.\n\nSteve McQueen\n\nCaf\u00e9 Lumi\u00e8re (2003)\n\nA film that happens without you knowing.\n\nJoshua Oppenheimer\n\nI just can\u2019t bring myself to name one film over all others. Can I spread the love and offer these:\n\nCode Unknown (2000)\n\nDogtooth (2009)\n\nHappy as Lazzaro (2018)\n\nImport/Export (2007)\n\nNobody Knows (2004)\n\nI\u2019m so sorry \u2013 I have little practice at naming favourites.\n\nL\u00e1szl\u00f3 Nemes\n\nMeek\u2019s Cutoff (2010)\n\nI saw Meek\u2019s Cutoff in Paris when I was writing my first feature film, in 2011. Traditional cinema projection was already dying, but this film was screened in 35mm, and it was beautiful and hypnotic. I remember the profound impression this film made on me, with its maze-like experience, the humanistic point of view, the small scale against the huge western backdrop, the unanswered questions about humanity, savagery and civilisation. For me, this film is what cinema can achieve, even after the age of the \u201cMasters\u201d (but certainly influenced by it) - take the viewer on a journey that they can be a part of.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Leonardo DiCaprio in The Wolf Of Wall Street Photograph: Allstar\n\nTrey Parker and Matt Stone\n\nMad Max: Fury Road (2015)\n\nWe love everything George Miller has ever done and Fury Road will be his crowning achievement until, maybe, his next film comes out.\n\nPawel Pawlikowski\n\nI have a real problem. There is no one film I liked most. I loved equally:\n\nLa Cienaga (2001)\n\nThe Death of Mr Lazarescu (2005)\n\nYou, the Living (2007)\n\nSilent Light (2007)\n\nOnce Upon a Time in Anatolia (2011)\n\nThe Embrace of the Serpent (2016)\n\n\n\nThey all took me to places I\u2019d never been to before, each one of them in its own, original way.\n\nSarah Polley\n\nA Hidden Life (2019)\n\nWatching A Hidden Life was a transformative experience for me. A call to arms.\n\nPaolo Sorrentino\n\nThe Wolf of Wall Street (2013)\n\nThe finest comedy intermingled with the contemporary drama of humanity as it seeks a meaning and strength in its own existence, but ends up becoming a prisoner of the same, trapped in itself. And apart from that it\u2019s as fine a lesson in style and imagination that any director could wish for.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Theo Who Lived. Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/Alamy\n\nMichael Winterbottom\n\nTheo Who Lived (2016)\n\nI think choosing lists of the top 10 this or the best 10 that is a bit of a pointless task. I don\u2019t even really have favourite films. There are loads of films that I like. If you asked me right now which film I would like to see again from the last 20 years it might be The Beat That My Heart Skipped by Jacques Audiard, or City of God by Fernando Mereilles. But if the point of a list is to encourage people to watch a film they haven\u2019t seen then I\u2019d pick Theo Who Lived (2016) \u2013 not for the film itself, but for the amazing story it tells.", "description": "From Mike Leigh to Richard Linklater, Joanna Hogg and Michael Winterbottom, here are some of the century\u2019s greatest films, chosen by some of the directors whose own films feature in our top 100", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f81d2a5f61bd99e57cbcabeaf16cf635a0f3b2c/0_616_4734_2841/master/4734.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bf44b8a8c165a3b553044daf27fc5385", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
