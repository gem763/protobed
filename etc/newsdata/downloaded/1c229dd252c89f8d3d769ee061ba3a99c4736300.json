The risk of a no-deal is very real,\u201d said Juncker, his comments weighing on sterling.\n\nPro-Brexit lawmakers cheered and applauded in the Strasbourg chamber.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for a clean-break Brexit,\u201d said Brexit campaigner Matthew Patten. Other pro-Brexit EU deputies tried to shout down pro-EU British colleagues, shouting \u201cYou lost!\u201d and \u201cRubbish!\u201d\n\nA majority of EU lawmakers later voted for an extension to Britain\u2019s scheduled departure date in a resolution that is not binding but which has political weight.\n\nEU leaders will meet for a make-or-break summit in Brussels on Oct. 17-18, just a fortnight before Brexit is due to materialise more than three years after Britons voted to leave.\n\nBritain is not likely to present a complete set of detailed, written proposals of how it would want the text of the existing - but stalled - Brexit deal changed before the end of the month, UK and EU sources said.\n\n\u201cIf that is the case, the summit will end with nothing,\u201d an EU diplomat dealing with Brexit in Brussels said. \u201cIf there is to be a deal, it must be prepared to a large extent in advance. It is too technical to leave to the leaders at the last minute.\u201d\n\nIn a worst-case scenario, a no-deal Brexit could mean severe disruption to trade, supplies of medicines, fresh foods and possible public disorder, according to the British government\u2019s contingency plans.\n\nSuch a sharp break in economic ties, ending four decades of EU membership, \u201cmight be the United Kingdom\u2019s choice, but never the choice of the EU,\u201d Juncker said, highlighting how the bloc wants to avoid blame if Britain crashes out.\n\nJuncker said London must present realistic proposals to replace the Irish backstop arrangement in the Britain-EU divorce agreement, which former premier Theresa May agreed with EU leaders but which was rejected by the British parliament.\n\n\u201cI am not emotionally attached to the Irish backstop,\u201d Juncker said. \u201cI have asked the prime minister to make, in writing, alternatives,\u201d he said, calling it a safety net to avoid a divided Ireland after Brexit.\n\nThe backstop would require Britain to obey some EU rules if no other way could be found to keep the land border between British-ruled Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland invisible.\n\nJohnson\u2019s office said in a statement late on Wednesday that the British leader had spoken with Juncker and the president of the European Parliament to reassure them that work was underway to find an alternative to the backstop.\n\n\u201cThe Prime Minister and President Juncker discussed the positive and constructive conversation they had in Luxembourg on Monday and their shared determination to reach a deal,\u201d a spokesperson for Johnson said.\n\nEuropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker addresses the plenary of the European Parliament on Britain's withdrawal from the European Union during a debate on Brexit at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France, September 18, 2019. REUTERS/Vincent Kessler\n\nBut Juncker\u2019s pessimistic tone on Wednesday was echoed by Finland\u2019s minister for European affairs, Tytti Tuppurainen, who told the parliament that a no-deal Brexit \u201cis a quite likely outcome.\u201d Finland holds the EU\u2019s rotating presidency.\n\n\u201cSTUPID\u201d BREXIT, \u201cDISREPUTABLE\u201d PM\n\nHowever, many EU lawmakers warned against a no-deal, both to avoid an economic shock and because they do not want to see Britain abandon its commitments to EU social and environmental standards and become a low-tax, low-regulation rival.\n\n\u201cWe will not accept a Singapore on the North Sea,\u201d said former Belgian prime minister Guy Verhofstadt, a liberal EU lawmaker and a member of the parliament\u2019s Brexit committee.\n\nIn an at times bad-tempered debate underscoring general weariness on the tortured issue of Britain\u2019s pending departure, senior EU lawmakers took jabs at the noisy contingent of British eurosceptic deputies in the chamber.\n\nManfred Weber, leader of the centre-right EPP group, called Brexit \u201cstupid\u201d. He and Verhofstadt took aim at British plans for greater sovereignty at a time when the parliament in Westminster has been suspended by Johnson. British pro-EU deputy Julie Ward called the prime minister \u201cdisreputable\u201d.\n\n\u201cBrexiteers claimed Westminster would take back control, but now they shut it down,\u201d Weber, a German lawmaker, said in Strasbourg, as the Supreme Court in London continued hearing arguments on whether Johnson acted unlawfully in suspending the parliament in the run-up to Brexit.\n\nThe European Parliament formally called on Wednesday for Britain to be granted another extension to allow more time for London to agree the terms of its withdrawal. The resolution passed with 544 in favour, 126 against and 38 abstentions.\n\nBritain\u2019s departure has already been delayed twice since March and Johnson has vowed he would not seek another extension.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nThe EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said a no-deal Brexit would not resolve any of the issues around the rights of EU citizens, the Irish border and British obligations under the bloc\u2019s long-term budget.\n\n\u201cIf the United Kingdom leaves without a deal, all these questions will not disappear. They are still there,\u201d Barnier told the EU chamber. \u201cSome three years after the Brexit referendum we should not be pretending to negotiate.\u201d", "description": "The European Union warned on Wednesday that Britain was headed for a damaging no-deal Brexit, with London's ideas for solving the contentious issue of the Irish border still unlikely to unlock a deal just six weeks before Britain is due to leave.", "authors": ["Robin Emmott", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431138348&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H0GT", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
