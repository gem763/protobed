The significance lies in the high profiles of the prisoners both Kiev and Moscow released and offers a glimmer of hope that the two neighbors and former allies could eventually overcome the bloody division that has separated them since Ukraine\u2019s Revolution of Dignity.\n\nFor Zelensky the prisoner swap was a huge political risk: knowing there would be harsh critics attacking him both at home in Ukraine and in the West, calling him a traitor. But millions of Ukrainians supported Zelensky\u2019s commitment to find compromises with Putin. A huge majority voted for him and for his party earlier this year.\n\n\u201cI am willing to do anything to prevent our heroes from dying,\u201d Zelensky told the parliament in late May. \u201cAnd if necessary, I am ready to lose my post without hesitations just to make peace happen.\u201d\n\nThe word \u201chero\u201d means a lot to Ukrainians today, after the endless war with pro-Russian forces, which has killed more than 13,000 people.\n\nIn August 2015, a Russian court sentenced a well-known Ukrainian film director, Oleg Sentsov, to 20 years in prison on bogus terrorism charges. Sensov and 34 other freed Ukrainian prisoners landed in Kiev on Saturday to the joy of millions of people.\n\n\u201cIf we today receive heroes coming home, Russia gets all sorts of criminals, who might be wishing they stayed in Ukraine,\u201d Galina Odnorog, a community leader in the city of Mariupol, told The Daily Beast in a phone interview.\n\nIt was an open wound for Ukrainians to see Sentsov\u2019s health failing during a 145-day hunger strike last year. The film director, the father of two children, demanded the Kremlin free 24 Ukrainian sailors captured in Crimea and other political prisoners. Russian intellectuals, actors, cultural and political figures called for the Kremlin to free Sentsov. Amnesty International declared Sentsov to be a prisoner of conscience, the European Parliament awarded him the Sakharov Prize for freedom of thought.\n\nThe difference in prisoners\u2019 arrival scenes in Kiev and Moscow illustrated the current contrast in Russia\u2019s and Ukraine\u2019s approach to the celebration of freedom and respect for heroism. If in Kiev crowds were allowed to greet the freed friends and loved ones as soon as they stepped off the plane, in Russia journalists and relatives had to wait outside the gate of the airport.\n\nUkrainian President Zelensky was in the airport to shake hands, hug and personally thank each one of the arriving Ukrainians, as \u201cnational heroes.\u201d There was no sign of President Putin to shake hands with 35 people released from Ukrainian prisons. Only 12 of them were actually citizens of Russia.\n\nThe images of Sentsov hugging his daughter in Borispol airport will stay in Ukraine\u2019s history, as a symbol of justice.\n\nFor the relatives of many prisoners, the process of the swap negotiations has been tough. Viktor Soroka, the father of one of 24 captured Ukrainian sailors drove 300 miles from Odessa to Kiev last week just to find out that the swap was postponed. \u201cIt feels like a huge octopus held our innocent sons hostages,\u201d Soroka told The Daily Beast. \u201cRussia is a hostile marketplace for prisoners but one hopes all of the Ukrainian prisoners will be exchanged and nobody is left behind.\u201d\n\nJust a few weeks ago tensions between Kiev and Moscow increased with Putin offering Ukrainians Russian citizenship and Zelensky welcoming Russians to accept political asylum in Ukraine. \u201cWe know perfectly well what a Russian passport provides,\u201d the Ukrainian President said. \u201cThe right to be arrested for a peaceful protest, the right not to have free and competitive elections.\u201d\n\nBut in spite of their different visions of democracy both Putin and Zelensky, with the help of dozens of negotiators, managed to reboot peace talks. The Russian High Commissioner for Human Rights, Tatiana Moskalkova said that the negotiations of the prisoner exchange took three years. \u201cWe felt that the mutual dialogue became constructive, after the phone conversation between Presidents of Ukraine and Russia on July 11,\u201d Moskakova said. It was Zelensky who called Putin on that day.\n\nOne particular prisoner was a serious issue in the negotiations. Vladimir Tsemakh, a former commander of rebel forces in eastern Ukraine, was a valuable key witness about the shooting down of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 bound from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur with 298 people on board.\n\n\u201cI was afraid the swap would fail,\u201d Zelensky admitted to journalists on Saturday when asked about the release of such a sensitive prisoner.\n\nDutch investigators and members of the European parliament criticized the idea of swapping Tsemakh. \u201cThis is a very, very bad moment,\u201d Kati Piri, a Dutch member of the European parliament told The Guardian. \u201cI understand the situation\u2014but not on MH17, not just a witness but possible suspect, that is a step too far from our perspective.\u201d\n\nIn spite of 40 members of the European Parliament calling for Zelensky to keep Tsemakh in jail, the Ukrainian leader freed the witness and Ukraine\u2019s citizens supported his decision.\n\n\u201cEuropean politicians have no right to criticize us, they make business deals, shake hands with Putin, it is unfair to expect Ukraine to be cornered as his main enemy,\u201d Odnorog told The Daily Beast. \u201cZelensky kept the promise he gave us to bring our guys home at any price.\u201d\n\nWorld leaders including Angela Merkel and Donald Trump congratulated Russia and Ukraine on the successful first step to peace. \u201cThe experience of other conflicts shows that if sides can agree on exchanges of prisoners, they may very likely be able to negotiate other conflict related issues,\u201d Varvara Pakhomenko, head of the Ukraine mission for the humanitarian group Geneva Call told The Daily Beast on Saturday.", "description": "The two politicians, one a former KGB officer, another a former comedian, managed to keep their promises to each other and swap 70 prisoners.", "authors": ["Anna Nemtsova"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2522,w_4484,x_0,y_46/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567875516/RTS2PJ79_tmadvn", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
