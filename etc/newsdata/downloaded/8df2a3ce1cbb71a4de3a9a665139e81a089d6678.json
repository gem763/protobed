Back in early 2010, I shared a graph that succinctly illustrated why economists shouldn\u2019t be trusted when they make economic forecasts (later that year, I pointed out that macroeconomists were the real problem).\n\nIn 2013, I wrote \u201cDon\u2019t Trust Economists, Part II\u201d based on a remarkable example of fraud in Portugal.\n\nNow it\u2019s time for Part III.\n\nWe\u2019ll start with a reminder that economists can\u2019t forecast their way out of a wet paper bag. Here\u2019s an excerpt from a 2001 article in the Economist.\n\nAs recently as February, 95% of American economists said it wouldn\u2019t happen, but it has. America is now in recession\u2026 Even in early September few economists were forecasting a recession. Now it appears that one had already been under way for almost six months. \u2026Why are recessions so hard to forecast? A study published last year by the International Monetary Fund looked at the economists\u2019 record. It is bad. Of 60 recessions in developed and developing economies during the 1990s, two-thirds remained undetected by consensus forecasts as late as April of the year in which the recessions occurred. In one-quarter of cases, the consensus forecast in October of that year still expected positive growth.\n\nRobert Samuelson has a more recent and comprehensive list of how economists are miserably bad when they try to forecast major economic trends.\n\nThe most intriguing and indisputable thing we have learned about economists in recent decades is that they don\u2019t know nearly as much as they thought they knew. \u2026As an economic journalist for roughly half a century, I have slowly and somewhat reluctantly come to the conclusion that many economists (and this applies across the political spectrum) often don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about\u2026 Time after time, economists have failed to foresee major economic trends. In recent years, global interest rates have plunged to historically low levels. \u2026But most economists did not anticipate the declines and still can\u2019t fully explain them. Going back a bit further, economists did not predict double-digit inflation (monthly peaks of 12 percent in 1974 and 1975 and 15 percent in 1980). \u2026Now, ironically, inflation has unexpectedly remained low (generally less than 2 percent annually ), and many economists have been baffled by that, too. \u2026Over the past five decades, I cannot remember one instance when economists have correctly forecast a major shift in productivity growth, whether up or down. \u2026Of course, the most conspicuous example of this ignorance gap is the 2008-2009 financial crisis and the Great Recession. \u201cWhy did nobody notice it?\u201d Queen Elizabeth famously asked. \u2026The larger cause of the ignorance gap is the very complexity and obscurity of a $20 trillion economy (the United States) or an $85 trillion economy (the world). To say it is changing in detailed and often-unanticipated ways is simply to affirm that mere mortals, including economists, have never been very good at predicting the future.\n\nIn other words, this cartoon is very accurate.\n\nSo what\u2019s the solution?\n\nIn my fantasy world, everyone would simply ignore economic forecasts and instead would focus on the conditions necessary for stronger long-run growth.\n\nSadly, that won\u2019t happen.\n\nSo what about some sort of \u201cquality control\u201d?\n\nThat might be nice in theory, but it wouldn\u2019t work in practice.\n\nWhich is why I\u2019m happy that there isn\u2019t much support in the profession for occupational licensing.\n\nLet\u2019s set aside the problem of economic forecasting.\n\nBinyamin Applebaum of the New York Times has a column that criticizes economists for a different reason.\n\nHe frets that economists have enabled a big shift toward free markets.\n\nAs the quarter century of growth that followed World War II sputtered to a close, economists moved into the halls of power, instructing policymakers that growth could be revived by minimizing government\u2019s role in managing the economy. They also warned that a society that sought to limit inequality would pay a price in the form of less growth. \u2026In the four decades between 1969 and 2008, economists played a leading role in slashing taxation of the wealthy and in curbing public investment. They supervised the deregulation of major sectors, including transportation and communications. \u2026they demonized trade unions and opposed worker protections like minimum wage laws.\n\nWhile I hope his overall premise is accurate, his specific assertions are an incoherent mess.\n\nHe wants readers to believe that economists were largely ignored prior to 1969 and suddenly wielded great influence thereafter. Yet he offers zero evidence for that hypothesis.\n\nMoreover, it was Arthur Okun\u2019s work for Brookings (hardly a citadel of libertarian thinking) that increased awareness of the tradeoff between redistribution and growth.\n\nMuch more troubling, though, is his assertion that the free-market orthodoxy ruled between 1969-2008.\n\nThat\u2019s ahistorical nonsense. The Nixon years, for instance, were probably the most statist period in America\u2019s post-WWII history.\n\nAnd we also got plenty of bad policy under Bush I, Bush II, and Obama.\n\nYes, policy did shift in the right direction under Reagan and Clinton. And it\u2019s also quite possible that the progress during those years more than offset the bad policies of other presidents.\n\nBut it\u2019s utterly absurd to thin of 1969-2008 as an era of continuous economic liberty.\n\nHere are some further excerpts.\n\nEconomists even persuaded policymakers to assign a dollar value to human life \u2014 around $10 million in 2019 \u2014 to assess whether regulations were worthwhile.\n\nThis is actually part of life-saving cost-benefit analysis.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not some sort of libertarian scheme, unless Applebaum thinks the folks at Brookings are part of some laissez-faire conspiracy.\n\nThough I\u2019m glad he gives some credit (from his perspective, blame) to Milton Friedman.\n\nThe most important figure, however, was Milton Friedman, an elfin libertarian who refused to take a job in Washington, but whose writings and exhortations seized the imagination of policymakers. Friedman offered an appealingly simple answer for the nation\u2019s problems: Government should get out of the way. He joked that if bureaucrats gained control of the Sahara, there would soon be a shortage of sand.\n\nHe concludes by fixating on inequality.\n\nThe rise of economics is a primary reason for the rise of inequality. \u2026Markets are constructed by people\u2026and people can change the rules. It\u2019s time to discard the judgment of economists that society should turn a blind eye to inequality. Reducing inequality should be a primary goal of public policy. \u2026Willful indifference to the distribution of prosperity over the last half century is an important reason the very survival of liberal democracy is now being tested by nationalist demagogues. \u2026our shared bonds will last longer if we can find ways to reduce the strain.\n\nIf he cares about the well-being of poor people, he should be fixated instead on growth.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, I suspect he shares the IMF\u2019s perspective and would willing to subject the poor to lower living standards if the rich suffered even bigger losses.\n\nBy the way, Ramesh Ponnuru is also quite critical of Applebaum\u2019s column.\n\nLet\u2019s close with some humor.\n\nProfessor Michael Munger wrote a column for FEE analyzing economist jokes.\n\nThe whole thing is worth reading, but I\u2019ll limit myself to sharing two of the jokes.\n\nAn economics graduate student was crossing a road one day when a frog called out to him and said, \u201cIf you kiss me, I\u2019ll turn into a beautiful princess.\u201d He bent over, picked up the frog and put it in his pocket. The frog spoke up again and said, \u201cIf you kiss me and turn me back into a beautiful princess, I will stay with you for one week.\u201d The graduate student took the frog out of his pocket, smiled at it, and returned it to his pocket. Desperate, the frog then cried out, \u201cIf you kiss me and turn me back into a princess, I\u2019ll stay with you and do anything you want.\u201d Again the grad student took the frog out, smiled at it and put it back into his pocket. Finally, the frog asked, \u201cWhat is the matter? I\u2019ve told you I\u2019m a beautiful princess, that I\u2019ll be your girlfriend and do anything you want. Why won\u2019t you kiss me?\u201d The grad student said, \u201cLook, I\u2019m an economist. I have no idea what it would even be like to have a girlfriend. But a talking frog has got to be worth a fortune.\u201d\n\nAnd here\u2019s the second example.\n\nA physicist, a chemist, and an economist are stranded on an island, with nothing to eat. A box washes ashore, and when they open it, it turns out to be a box of canned soup. But how to open the cans? The physicist says, \u201cLet\u2019s break the can open with a rock, using precisely the correct vector of force so the contents aren\u2019t spilled.\u201d The chemist says, \u201cLet\u2019s build a fire and heat the can just to the point where the contents break the metal but don\u2019t explode.\u201d The economist says, \u201cWell, let\u2019s do this in an a priori manner. First, assume that we have a can-opener\u2026\u201d\n\nP.S. Are economists useless, despicable, and loathsome?
