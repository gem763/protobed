This burst of proactive energy will pick you up and sweep you forward.\n\nTwo planets change signs this week. Mercury moves into the fixed sign of Scorpio on Thursday. The planet of thought will remain in the passionate sign of Scorpio for an extended visit of nine weeks due to the next Mercury retrograde in November.\n\nThe big astrological headline this week is Pluto's return to direct motion after moving retrograde since April. Pluto was discovered in 1930 and reigned as a planet all the way through to 2006 at which time his status was demoted to a dwarf planet. There was an outcry at the time and there is still an ongoing debate about the virtues of that decision.\n\nBut the demotion has not diminished the astrological importance of Pluto one iota. Quite the opposite is true. The controversy drew the world's attention to this Lord of the Underworld in Greek mythology and made him mightier than ever. He is best known for the dark side of his character, but there is a good side too. One of the benefits of Pluto is his drive to purge old and debilitating emotions. The cathartic process he puts us through lightens the heart and begins a process of rebirth.\n\nPluto and Saturn are moving along in close company and will join in a tight conjunction in January 2020. Saturn rules the seasons of your life. Their current close connection is making this time now a watershed moment for you. A page has been turned. A major new chapter in the book of your life is beginning.\n\nThere may be some pain involved, but it will work out fine for you. An emotional and psychological transformation is taking place. You are betwixt and between the past and the future. Say goodbye to the old. Say hello to the new.\n\nHere is your horoscope for the week of Monday, September 30, 2019.\n\nAries\n\nIt's not easy to stay calm and collected when inwardly you are full of angst. Nor is it easy to live in the moment when faced with matters of great urgency. If you are to achieve all that you are trying to accomplish, you must somehow find a way to separate yourself from emotions that, though valid and understandable, are counterproductive. Pluto's influence this week put you in charge. You'll be as decisive and determined as a general. The Universe needs to be sure that you really want what you are asking for. If you are passionate about what you want, you'll get it.\n\nTaurus\n\nWhen the going gets tough, the tough get going. True enough but do also keep in mind that things could be far worse. Take a look around you at what some people have to go through just to get through the day. Avoid indulging in your worries lest you bring your greatest fears upon yourself. Penetrating insights will come as a result of Pluto's direct, no-nonsense approach. You'll see how lucky you are to be who you are and where you are in this lifetime. There is plenty to be happy about, so get your mind off your woes and dance to the happy tune of serendipity. A wonderful discovery will lead to the reversal of a flawed situation.\n\nGemini\n\nPowerful astrological forces are working overtime to liberate you from a heavy emotional burden. Your difficulties are not insurmountable obstacles. A problem which showed no sign of coming to an end is starting to dissolve. Pluto's return to direct motion this week will teach you to treat each new day as if it were a dear friend that has returned for a visit. Success and happiness depend on your ability to think positively. Take your mind off of your sources of discomfort and you'll realize that your problems are opportunities in disguise. Your worries are nothing more than warnings from your intuition, which, if heeded, will be cured.\n\nCancer\n\nHow are you? Yes, you're doing your best, but there is a sense these days, that you are not at all sure how you actually are. Pluto's powerful influence has imposed changes which have been difficult to deal with. Yes, that's true, but they are essentially good. You are being purged of heavy emotional baggage that was tucked away and forgotten years ago in a hidden recess of a backroom closet. A way will be found to sort out an issue that is bugging you. Pluto has made some room in your heart to be filled with joy. You'll soon understand that there is so much to celebrate. Your future is golden.\n\nLeo\n\nBig decisions need to be made. The stars wish to assure you that you won't be let down. All you need to know will come to light when the time is right. Unbeknownst to your conscious mind, cosmic forces are working underfoot in a most mysterious way to bring your greatest dream into fruition. What's happening now will find its own level in time. Meanwhile, enjoy the many advantages of the situation in which you currently find yourself. Pluto is blessing you with lucid thought. You'll be able to put your brain to work and come up with a smart plan so as to render quite irrelevant whatever has been troubling you.\n\nVirgo\n\nThe world is full of people who don't know as much as they pretend to know. That certainly does not stop them from issuing advice. You have learned to accept their grand proclamations with a hefty pinch of salt or two. Although, you may find it difficult to believe, you have proven many times over that you can overcome adversity with aplomb and ease. What you can do is rare. Pluto's powerful shift into forward motion this week will provide the energy to improve your wellbeing, your love life, even your financial outlook. The Universe is ready to reward you with the success you deserve.\n\nLibra\n\nThe accomplishment of a long-awaited dream is so close it's palpable. You're doing far better than you realize in a situation that you once thought was hopeless. All of your hard work over the years is reaching a critical stage. Pluto this week will help you concentrate and sharpen your focus. Penetrating insights will allow you to make sense of a seemingly senseless situation. You may feel baffled by what you are up against, but you are not beaten by it \u2014 nor will you be. Yes, strange things are happening around you. Still, you will find the best way to move forward and make a special dream come true.\n\nScorpio\n\nSometimes, we must be careful about what we say and do lest we embarrass ourselves, or still worse, offend others. Sometimes people's reactions can be dramatic, to say the least. If you are feeling entrapped in a situation that seems hopeless, help is on the way. Pluto's return to direct motion is throwing you a lifeline that will yank you out of a box and open the door to a liberated world. You'll see life in a totally different and encouraging way. All those areas of sensitivity will be solved with masterful delicacy. You'll be able to take charge of your future and get on the fast road to success.\n\nSagittarius\n\nIt's always advisable to be true to our feelings. Denying them is a form of suppressing our existence; we thus allow ourselves to be dominated and ruled by others. We give them the power to do as they please, when we should be empowering ourselves. Of course, expressing our opinions, especially if they are controversial leads to consequences and repercussions which complicate life. Pluto's return to direct motion gives you a chance to take back your power concerning a matter of great import. By being true to your needs, your happiness and the well-being of certain others close to you will be enhanced.\n\nCapricorn\n\nCertain demands and expectations are forcing you to deny your own needs. It's never a good idea to suppress yourself. Sometimes, for the sake of feeling safe and protected, we undermine our own wants and desires, but in doing so we do just the opposite and increase our vulnerability. Pluto's influence this week will impress upon you the importance of being true to yourself. You'll feel pumped up and powerful. There is no need to be impetuous, but you will feel impassioned and inspired as you appreciate that something is guiding and leading you to a heartfelt dream.\n\nAquarius\n\nIt's important to carefully pace yourself no matter what seems urgent or why you feel so stirred up. To get a certain project moving faster, you'll need a calm mind, a sound strategy and a foolproof plan. That seems rather daunting now, but Pluto's influence this week will inspire you by giving you a clear understanding of your objective. You'll see clearly what you want and how to get it. The more time you take and the more thought you give to the next big move you make, the more likely you are to reach a decision that proves effective. Tantalizing prospects and opportunities are queuing up to meet you.\n\nPisces\n\nWe are brought up to be polite and inoffensive. We are instructed to not rock the boat. We are taught to be wary of stating the obvious. But if you don't say anything, how is a difficulty ever going to be recognized and resolved? Pluto's influence this week will impress upon you that your values and intuitive insights must not be compromised. Sure, it's possible that your intervention in a matter may not get a good reaction, but because your intentions are pure, your influence will set in motion a healing process. You'll see what needs to be done to mend a tense situation.", "description": "You are betwixt the past and the future; say goodbye to the old, say hello to the new.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5300964.1569619970!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/horoscope-ft-img-sept-30.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
