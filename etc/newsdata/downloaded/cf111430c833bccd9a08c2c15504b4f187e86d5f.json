(Photo: Kenny Smith - PA Images via Getty Images)\n\nThe U.S. Air Force was spending nearly $200,000 at President Donald Trump\u2019s Turnberry golf resort as his own helicopter shuttle service to the club was failing, according to financial filings.\n\nThe Trump Organization\u2019s DT Connect Europe Limited travel service registered at Turnberry was doing so poorly that it shipped its helicopter back to the U.S., The Scotsman reported.\n\nThe Air Force contract to refuel military planes at Glasgow Prestwick Airport near Trump\u2019s Scottish resort as service members stayed at Turnberry is being investigated by the House Oversight Committee and the military. The committee is probing whether the arrangement was an attempt to use taxpayer funds to bail out the struggling Turnberry \u2014 and the financially ailing airport. Prestwick, owned by the Scottish government, is a key transportation pipeline to Turnberry.\n\nTrump launched the DT Connect service with the ultra-luxe Sikorsky S-76B helicopter in 2014. He announced at the time it would \u201cconnect the three dots\u201d of his two Scottish golf resorts as well as Doonbeg in Ireland.\n\nBut golf clients weren\u2019t enough to keep the Sikorsky flying, so the helicopter was largely rented out for others to use, according to The Scotsman. But it\u2019s now back in the U.S. and no longer registered in the United Kingdom, according to the newspaper \u2014 even though Trump Aviation still boasts of its fleet of three Sikorskys with one in Florida, New York and Scotland.\n\nTrump\u2019s 2018 financial disclosure listed the value of DT Connect in Turnberry as between $1 million and $5 million with a \u201crental income\u201d of between $100,000 and $1 million. But according to business records filed with the UK, its most recent profit and loss reserves stood at a negative $120 million, which could mean the helicopter has been transferred out of the business.\n\nThe helicopter service became even less popular after Trump became president, The Scotsman reported. The director of a charter company that operated the Sikorsky for DT Connect said clients were eventually given the option to cover up the \u201cTrump\u201d name on the helicopter in a bid to boost business.\n\n\u201cIn America, Trump is a brand,\u201d Richard Stubbs of Cardinal Helicopter Services which had a contract to fly the Sikorsky, told The Scotsman. \u201cObviously over here, it\u2019s the focus of people\u2019s anger, sometimes, so we operated with or without the name.\u201d\n\nAlso on HuffPost\n\nLove HuffPost?
