His bosses aren\u2019t having it and send in Junior, an assassin tailor-made to kill him. But, on removing his sunglasses and backwards baseball cap, Junior is revealed to be\u2026 a younger clone of Henry.\n\nNever mind the silly science or that Smith\u2019s face is shoddily de-aged with digital technology to enable him to play Junior: it\u2019s simply hard to buy the actor as a weepy 23-year-old virgin. The older Smith is more convincing; grizzled, wisecracking, insisting his younger self is \u201cobviously not the Best\u201d. Ang Lee\u2019s film was shot at 120 frames per second (rather than the usual 24) and is presented in 3D, presumably in the hope that its stunts and set pieces, like a bullet train that whips around a corner, will appear more visceral. This has the opposite effect to that which was intended, rendering the image inert and uncannily flat. It\u2019s only immersive in the sense that you feel as though you\u2019re on a TV set or sound stage.", "description": "All the digital de-ageing technology in the world can\u2019t make this silly sci-fi thriller about a cloned hitman convincing", "authors": ["Simran Hans"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3214c38146610796b0fa069f855de1813e5ef85d/62_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTEucG5n&enable=upscale&s=2ddf7ad8bf826d82d5190a86efe95bea", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
