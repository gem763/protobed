Workload and schedule were cited as important causes.\n\nSuch conflicts could become problematic, the survey found, when it came to Boeing engineers who played dual roles designing certain systems on behalf of the plane maker and then certifying the same systems as safe on behalf of the Federal Aviation Administration, as part of a decades-old agency program that effectively outsources such regulatory work to company employees.\n\nThe summary of the survey as of November 2016 also indicated that 15% of those who responded encountered such situations \u201cseveral times\u201d or \u201cfrequently.\u201d The survey results were provided to the committee by an individual, rather than as part of Boeing\u2019s formal process of turning over documents, and were reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe survey, which hasn\u2019t been reported before, wasn\u2019t specifically focused on the Max but covered employees across a range of Boeing commercial airliner programs; it came near the end of the Max\u2019s multiyear federal approval process. Boeing declined to comment on the survey, but a board member has said an internal review found no signs that undue pressure had compromised safety.\n\nAn expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.\n\nAlso popular on WSJ.com:\n\nGM strike continues, deepening pain felt by Midwest workers, firms.\n\nThree prison inmates beat Harvard in a debate.
