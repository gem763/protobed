Venezuela, however, has denied responsibility for the oil.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Oil blobs are seen on the sand of the Pituba beach also in Salvador\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption A mangrove on the beach of Carneiros in Pernambuco, polluted by the spill\n\nThe incident is more challenging than a typical oil spill because the dense crude is not floating on the surface and only appears when it washes up on shore, Mr Bim was quoted by Reuters news agency as saying.\n\nFloating barriers usually employed to prevent oil from washing ashore have little effect, for example, so the work has been focused on cleaning up the crude as it comes to the coast.\n\nIn Pernambuco state, 30 tonnes of oil were removed from beaches on Saturday alone.\n\nMeanwhile, federal prosecutors have accused the federal government of failing to organise a response, saying the spill has caused environmental damage in an area spanning 2,100km (1,300 miles).\n\nImage copyright HANDOUT/EPA Image caption Oil sitting on the surface of the water near Maragogi in Alagoas\n\nImage copyright HANDOUT/EPA Image caption The oil seen from above near Maragogi\n\nAll pictures copyright.", "description": "Thousands of people work to remove oil and tar from beaches as source of spill remains unclear.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/101D0/production/_109300066_41fb18b3-2314-4b16-8c3e-6560a87a85cd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
