Our efforts alone over the past year have revealed more than 1,500 tonnes of counterfeit alcohol,\u201d Hamzaev said.\n\nThe illegal sales are a public health risk, according to the group. Every year more than 100,000 Russians seek medical aid after drinking fake alcohol.\n\nIn 2016, 62 people died in Irkutsk from poisoning from batch of counterfeit alcohol.\n\nWant more news?", "description": "Meet the activists fighting Russia's home-made alcohol epidemic", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/21/85/88/1000x563_cmsv2_b614d3c3-5bde-55f8-8a93-daee83ab1e1d-4218588.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
