It was 2011 and the administration was rationalizing its desperation to negotiate its way out of Afghanistan, where we then had about 30,000 troops. It was nothing new.\n\nHamid Karzai, president of the fledgling Afghan government propped up by the Bush administration after the Taliban\u2019s ouster, had been seeking negotiations for years ... only to be spurned by the Taliban.\n\nOf course, the Taliban did not get to weigh in on Biden\u2019s babble. If they had, they would surely have said bluntly what they have demonstrated blatantly for 20 years: They are absolutely our enemy, not just per se but in aeternum.\n\nCONDOLEEZZA RICE: TIMING OF TRUMP'S PROPOSED TALIBAN TALKS 'NOT IDEAL' RIGHT BEFORE 9/11\n\nIf, as he stated in a Saturday Twitter thread, President Trump actually was planning to host Taliban leaders at Camp David this past weekend for what he and the administration describe as \u201cpeace talks,\u201d that boggles the mind.\n\nThe Taliban terrorists do not wish to hold \u201cpeace talks\u201d with us. As shown by the humiliating negotiations that the Trump administration\u2019s emissary has been conducting in Qatar, the Taliban wish, at best, to chat about the terms of our surrender \u2014 i.e., about how willing they may be to let the president\u2019s determination to withdraw our troops look like an honorable armistice rather than a case of our being chased out of their country.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nAllowing their leaders into our country \u2014 into Camp David for an audience with the president \u2014 would be every bit as outrageous as President Obama\u2019s release of five Taliban commanders from Guantanamo Bay (in exchange for deserter Bowe Bergdahl, no less).\n\nIt would be every bit as outrageous as the Obama administration\u2019s issuance of a visa to Hani Nour Eldin \u2014 a member of an Egyptian terrorist organization that, like the Taliban, conspires with al Qaeda to kill Americans \u2014 so he could come to Washington for talks about post-Mubarak Cairo.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nPresident Trump now says he has rolled back up the red carpet initially laid out for these jihadists. He withdrew the invitation, he says, because of an attack last week in which the Taliban killed a U.S. soldier, in addition to a member of our allied forces (a Romanian soldier), and 10 other people, while wounding scores of others.\n\nBut why was yet another Taliban atrocity necessary to put the president on notice of what we\u2019re dealing with? It wasn\u2019t even the Taliban\u2019s first attack of that week.\n\nCLICK HERE TO KEEP READING ANDREW MCCARTHY'S COLUMN IN THE NATIONAL REVIEW\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY ANDREW MCCARTHY", "description": "Taliban terrorists do not wish to hold \"peace talks\" with us..They want to negotiate terms of our surrender.", "authors": ["Andrew Mccarthy", "Andrew C.
