He arrived at the site on Monday with two other motorcyclist friends from Manchester, Kieran Lowe and Mark Mawby.\n\nHave you been affected by this story?

As soon as someone was sick, someone else would start.\n\n\u201cA sign was placed over the sick and not cleaned for over 30 minutes. A few minutes later a security guard requested a cleaner to someone else being sick in the female toilets.\u201d\n\nThe friends claim no announcements were made by staff to alert guests to the sickness or give advice.\n\nRichard said: \u201cI was starting to feel sick and had stomach cramps. On returning to the caravan I lay down in severe pain and within minutes I was violently sick to the point security knocked on the door to see if I was okay.\n\n(Image: Cornwall Live WS)\n\n\u201cMy friends were going to ring an ambulance for me as I\u2019ve got a pacemaker, so I\u2019ve got to be careful.\n\n\u201cThroughout the night I was constantly sick and my friend started with it around 1.30am.\n\n\"We were up all night, then we went to reception and they wouldn\u2019t give us any advice, only a statement to say a doctor had been on site but they wouldn\u2019t tell us what it was.\u201d\n\nRichard\u2019s other friend started being violently ill at around 10am on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThey just gave us a form each to fill in and we are not being kept up to date. We still have not been told what this illness is \u2013 we are learning more from reading Cornwall Live.\u201d\n\nRichard added: \u201cWe asked a cleaner to come in and clean our caravan but they refused as they didn\u2019t want to catch it.\n\n\"I said, give me disinfectant and a cloth and I\u2019ll do it. They said they weren\u2019t allowed to give me any cleaning equipment. They must have seen the look on my face as they eventually gave me a pack of Dettol wipes.\u201d\n\n(Image: Cornwall Live WS)\n\nHe claimed that a bag of their bedding, covered in sick, was still in a big bag outside their caravan.\n\nThe men say they will now cancel a return visit to the park in 2020.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t seem to be cleaning up the bags full of sick bedding. Every caravan has got bags of sick bedding outside,\" said Richard, who added that security and a number of staff were doing their best but there was no sign of management.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve just asked reception and they are refusing to give us any info, just saying the site facilities are closed and there are no more check-ins but they will still not confirm what the virus is. It's an absolute shambles.\u201d\n\nAnother guest, Scott Clarke, said the first he knew of what appears to be a norovirus bug is when another family told him.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere was no explanation from anyone who works at the park. The first we knew was when we tried to go up the arcade with the kids yesterday and another guest stopped us, then we saw it on the news, so very disappointed.\n\n(Image: Google)\n\n\"The whole park needs a bloody good clean, sad really as my wife has holidayed here since a child but we won\u2019t be returning again.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Mullion Holiday Park said: \u201cWe immediately contacted Public Health England and the local environmental health authority once we were made aware that some guests on the park were ill.\n\n\"We worked closely with the authorities throughout the day and they visited the park yesterday and told us they are happy with the measures we have in place.\n\n\u201cWe have taken the decision to temporarily close, as a precaution. We are extremely sorry to everybody this will affect, however the health and wellbeing of our guests is paramount.\n\n\"Wherever possible, we are providing alternative accommodation for our guests and owners.\u201d\n\nHe added that all public areas and accommodation will all be professionally cleaned. Items for washing may have been placed outside caravans while the interiors are being cleaned, he said.\n\nRefunds are being offered to guests.", "description": "Richard Marlborough was among the visitors to fall violently ill at Mullion Holiday Park in Cornwall and claims he had to beg for disinfectant to clean his caravan", "authors": ["Lee Trewhela", "Amber Hicks", "Image", "Cornwall Live Ws", "Google"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20725105.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Mullion.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
