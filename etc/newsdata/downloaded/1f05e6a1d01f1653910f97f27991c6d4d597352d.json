He said the Cabinet then voted unanimously in favor of the change.\n\nAkwai said the Taiwanese Embassy in the capital, Honiara, had lowered its flag on Tuesday. Embassy staff declined to comment.\n\nTaiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen said it will close the embassy and recall all technical and medical staff stationed there.\n\n\u201cWe sincerely regret and strongly condemn their government\u2019s decision to establish diplomatic relations with China,\u201d Tsai said.\n\nChina, meanwhile, said it welcomed the Solomon Islands into its Pacific family.\n\n\u201cChina highly commends the decision of the Solomon Islands\u2018 government to recognize the one-China principle and sever the so-called \u2018diplomatic ties\u2019 with the Taiwan authorities,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a statement.\n\nChina considers Taiwan to be part of its territory and wants to bring the island back into its fold. Taiwan split from mainland China during a civil war in 1949 and set up a rival government to the victorious Communists in Beijing.\n\nMost countries recognize Beijing today, and China has been ratcheting up diplomatic and economic pressure to woo the remaining ones since Tsai took office in 2016.\n\nWith a population of 660,000, the Solomon Islands were easily Taiwan\u2019s largest remaining ally in the Pacific. Its economy relies on agriculture, fishing and forestry, and the country has a wealth of undeveloped mineral resources.\n\nNow only 16 countries worldwide continue to recognize Taiwan, including five small Pacific nations. Of those, the Marshall Islands and Palau have close ties with the U.S. and are unlikely to switch allegiance anytime soon. But experts say Kiribati, Nauru and Tuvalu could soon switch.\n\nU.S. Republican Sen. Marco Rubio said the U.S. shouldn\u2019t stay silent.\n\n\u201cThe Solomon Islands has officially become the latest nation to bow to Chinese gov\u2019t pressure and sever ties with Taiwan,\u201d Rubio tweeted. \u201cThe U.S. and Int\u2019l community must push back against Beijing\u2019s bullying and efforts to isolate #Taiwan.\u201d\n\nJames Batley, a researcher at the Australian National University and a former Australian high commissioner in the Solomon Islands, said the move didn\u2019t come as a surprise.\n\n\u201cThe sense in Solomon Islands is that there are significant resources on offer here from China, and they want to move with the times and on the side of history,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he said the Solomons needs to be careful not to get into serious debt to China, particularly as, even before the switch, it was looking to take out big loans to fund infrastructure projects including a hydroelectric dam. He said Taiwan had promised the Solomons a new stadium for when it hosts the 2023 Pacific Games, and that the Solomons may now look instead to China for help.\n\nProfessor Anne-Marie Brady, an expert on China at the University of Canterbury, said the blow to Taiwan wasn\u2019t as big now as it might have been in the past. She said that\u2019s because Taiwan has managed to forge unofficial relations with dozens of countries and the European Union as part of a more pragmatic approach to its diplomacy.\n\nShe said the Solomon Islands may also benefit from being able to better balance its relations with a number of larger countries, including China, the U.S., Australia and New Zealand.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Taiwan has lost its largest ally in the Pacific after the Solomon Islands confirmed Tuesday that it is switching diplomatic allegiance to China, and observers say other Pacific nations may soon follow.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Nick Perry"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/16/taiwan_china_solomon_islands_21433_c0-169-4032-2519_s1770x1032.jpg?805b7e943f911eb08095551e91bbf96f688343f8", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
