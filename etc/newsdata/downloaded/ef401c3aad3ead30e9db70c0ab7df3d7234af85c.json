A similar mind-set prompted several high-level German diplomats to remain in office after Adolf Hitler took power in 1933. Trump and Hitler may have little in common, yet the moral conflict facing their respective civil servants is much the same: Should diplomats resign or decline to serve if they have deep moral misgivings about their government\u2019s policy, or should they remain in office to try to prevent worse from happening?\n\nAfter Hitler was appointed German chancellor on Jan. 30, 1933, only one top German diplomat stepped down. In his letter of resignation, Friedrich von Prittwitz und Gaffron \u2014 at the time the German ambassador in Washington \u2014 explained that his political attitude was deeply rooted in liberalism and republicanism and that, as a result and \u201cfor reasons of personal decency,\u201d he could no longer serve the new German regime.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPrittwitz had hoped that some of his colleagues would follow his lead \u2014 even though he knew that most German diplomats more or less embraced the broad outlines of Nazi foreign policy. He nevertheless knew that there were a precious few who neither shared nor believed in Hitler\u2019s goals, and he hoped \u2014 in vain \u2014 that they would join him in resigning.\n\nThey chose another path, however, following instead the advice of State Secretary Bernhard von B\u00fclow: \u201cOne does not abandon one\u2019s country because it has a bad government.\u201d Just how bad, B\u00fclow would never find out. He died in 1936.\n\nIn the end, those who lived and served through the entire Nazi nightmare became accomplices to Hitler\u2019s genocidal policies, willingly or not. That was true even for the small number of German diplomats who tried to reason with Hitler and his henchmen from behind the scenes.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne of those diplomats was Nazi Germany\u2019s last ambassador to the United States, Hans Heinrich Dieckhoff, who remained in office despite early misgivings about the Third Reich. Before World War II, Dieckhoff sent a flurry of reports from Washington to Berlin desperately warning that war with America would have dire consequences for Germany. In a letter from early November 1938, for example, he presciently predicted that if the F\u00fchrer were to choose a \u201croad toward violence,\u201d the U.S. government would do everything in its power to dampen the \u201cisolationist tendencies\u201d of the American people and \u201cthrow the full weight of the United States behind the English \u2026\u201d\n\nDieckhoff\u2019s counterpart in Moscow, Ambassador Friedrich-Werner Graf von der Schulenburg, similarly did all he could to prevent Nazi Germany from attacking the Soviet Union \u2014 to no avail. His frustration was no doubt one reason he later joined a high-level conspiracy to assassinate Hitler \u2014 and paid for that with his life when the plot failed in July 1944.\n\nAfter 1945, top-level foreign policymakers in Nazi Germany who had survived the war tried to justify their earlier cooperation with Hitler\u2019s regime. Ernst von Weizs\u00e4cker, who succeeded B\u00fclow as State Secretary in 1938, explained that he had done so \u201cto prevent even worse\u201d from happening.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSuch a remark rang hollow and cynical, especially once the world learned about the Holocaust and other atrocities committed by the Nazis. More to the point, Weizs\u00e4cker\u2019s failure to have had a moderating influence on Nazi foreign policy demonstrated just how frustrating and difficult, if not impossible, it is for even a high-level diplomat to have a moderating influence on foreign policy \u2014 especially when one fundamentally disagrees with the course adopted by the head of state.\n\nWhat then, are diplomats to do when they realize that the foreign policy of their own government is wrong and morally corrupt? Hans Heinrich Dieckhoff raised exactly this question in a speech he gave during the postwar period. \u201cIn that case,\u201d Dieckhoff responded to his rhetorical question, \u201che can only \u2014 and even has to \u2014 try vehemently to steer his government on the right path.\u201d And if that doesn\u2019t work, he continued, the diplomat must resign.\n\nDieckhoff himself had failed to heed his own advice. As for why that was the case, he admitted that such an action required courage \u2014 something that \u201cnot everyone had, neither Germans nor other people.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAmerica under Trump is, of course, still far from Hitler\u2019s dictatorship of the 1930s. The moral conflict \u2014 whether it is one\u2019s duty to serve and represent your government even when one deeply disagrees with its political actions and the fundamental values it represents \u2014 is nevertheless comparable.\n\nTaylor\u2019s deposition should be seen by all Americans as a lesson in courage. Taylor did not resign from his post. But his plucky willingness to share his misgivings about the Trump administration\u2019s Ukraine policies makes Taylor one of those rare career diplomats who make a real difference \u2014 not just behind the scenes, but by exposing out in the open questionable policies he considered counter to his personal ideals and to those of his country.\n\nOther civil servants should take a close look at Ambassador William B. Taylor\u2019s actions and remember why Aristotle rightly held courage as the first of all qualities. In our day, too, it remains the quality that guarantees all others.\n\nAD", "description": "The lesson of William Taylor for Trump Administration officials", "authors": ["Sylvia Taschka", "Sylvia Taschka Teaches Modern German", "World History At Wayne State University", "Is The Author Of A Book About Hans Heinrich Dieckhoff", "The Last German Ambassador To The United States Before The Second World War."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/aCYv-Uqd1AmPUufgjSwgOhHKftY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SWLUOVXV5II6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
