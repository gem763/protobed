They were meant to go viral and gain followers.\n\nThis post by IRA account @blackstagram_ _ used a picture of a prominent social media influencer, Janee Allure. It received 111,102 likes with the hashtags, #blackexcellence and #blackgirlmagic.\n\nImage copyright Computational Propaganda Research Project\n\nAnother image posted on Instagram featured a young girl in a rainbow dress with hashtags that mentioned community pride and Black History Month. It was shared 168,998 times.\n\nImage copyright Computational Propaganda Research Project Image caption Posted by Instagram _blacktivistt_\n\nFacebook users engaged 11.2 million times with a top-performing page, \"Blacktivist\", which was created by the Russian agency.\n\nAlmost 100% of its YouTube content involved videos of violence perpetrated against African-American men, says the report.\n\nImage copyright Computational Propaganda Research Project Image caption A video shared by Blacktivist was shared 539,012 times\n\nAlleged police brutality against African-Americans featured on Blacktivist video and Instagram posts as well as news stories with racial undertones, like the NFL kneeling protests.\n\nHow social media has changed\n\nFacebook says it has doubled the number of people working on safety and security, and just last month met several government agencies including the FBI, as well as academics, to prevent Russian influence in the 2020 elections.\n\nThe social media site says it takes down millions of fake accounts a day, and has improved its response results across all of its teams.\n\n\"We have stepped up our efforts to build strong defences on multiple fronts...We have also invested in technology and people to block and remove fake accounts; find and remove co-ordinated manipulation campaigns; and bring unprecedented transparency to political advertising.\" Facebook said.\n\nGoogle said: \"Videos on YouTube are viewable by anyone. Users can create videos intended for certain audiences, but there is no way to target by race\".\n\nTwitter said that it received no information from the US government before the 2016 election about a state-sponsored operation.\n\nSince \"discovering the issue,\" a spokeswoman from Twitter said it was working with law enforcement and the FBI as well as the Department of Homeland Security, and had conducted a public investigation into the events of 2016.", "description": "A Senate intelligence report says Russians aimed misinformation campaign at African-American voters.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/F6D2/production/_109168136_blackmatters.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
