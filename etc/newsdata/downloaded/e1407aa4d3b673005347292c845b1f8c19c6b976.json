Bailey figuring out that she is both extremely terrified and also happy about being pregnant is such a minor storyline in this episode, and yet the thing I want to talk about the most. When she finally calms down enough about it to tell Ben that they\u2019re having a baby, oh you guys, he gives her a look that is so full of love and joy, I think it got rid of at least three of my wrinkles. Ben and Bailey love each other so much. I\u2019m kind of bored already thinking of some of the possible \u201cnew parent\u201d storylines they might get roped into down the line, but I will suffer through it for their love. I\u2019m dedicated, if nothing else.\n\nBailey\u2019s pregnancy proves important for someone else in this episode, as well. Jo Karev is having a moment. She\u2019s been doing so well since coming back to work and scamming Bailey into giving her a promotion. When she suddenly finds herself locked in that hyperbaric chamber with Bailey and a patient who happens to be one of her therapists from her inpatient treatment center, there because of a suspected suicide attempt by way of carbon monoxide, Jo worries all her progress will go out the window. Or, out the porthole, as it were. I mean, she also worries about her dying therapist, but, yeah, mainly she\u2019s worried about herself.\n\nOnce she follows Bailey into the chamber and is face-to-face with an unconscious Carly (Rachel Bay Jones, of Dear Evan Hansen fame), she knows she should not be in there. Realizing that the one person who helped her learn how to cope with all of her trauma may have tried to kill herself sends Jo spiraling. If it could happen to Carly, who is 13 years sober and was seemingly fine, it could happen to Jo. When her own coping mechanisms fail her and she feels on the brink of breaking down, Bailey offers a distraction to calm her down by way of blurting out her big news. She\u2019s \u201c100 percent p-r-e-g-o.\u201d She is \u201csuper pregnant.\u201d That calms Jo down immediately.\n\nThere\u2019s more to the story than just Jo freaking out in a hermetically sealed room. (It always seems like there\u2019s major drama afoot for whoever steps into that chamber \u2014 for once, can\u2019t someone bring a patient in there and it go smoothly?) We get some flashbacks to Jo\u2019s time in therapy. We watch as Carly takes a very broken Jo from someone who believes there\u2019s no hope for her \u2014 she can\u2019t get through the shame she\u2019s feeling after her mother\u2019s rejection \u2014 to someone willing to deal with her anger over her mother\u2019s abandonment. It\u2019s Carly who helps Jo realize that she\u2019s so upset over what happened with her mother in the diner, because it wasn\u2019t the first time she faced this sort of rejection: her mother also abandoned her when she was just five days old. We knew that Jo started healing while in treatment, now we get to see that breakthrough.\n\nIt\u2019s \u2026 fine? I\u2019m glad Grey\u2019s is acknowledging that someone suffering through what Jo is suffering through isn\u2019t just automatically fixed, but also, there has been no real build up to this storyline \u2014 no mention of Carly, nor have we seen Jo use her coping techniques before. Having that foundation would\u2019ve made tonight\u2019s payoff much more engrossing. By the end of it, Carly is saved and Jo learns that her therapist wasn\u2019t attempting suicide, it was just good ol\u2019 fashioned accidental carbon-monoxide poisoning. Moral of the story: Jo will always be managing her mental health, but she\u2019s moving forward and she\u2019s much better equipped to handle whatever comes her way now than she was before seeking treatment. That\u2019s great! Still, by the time we see Jo sharing some of her anger management exercises with Alex, I was mostly wondering when we\u2019re going to get more time with Jo\u2019s husband this season. He\u2019s running a freaking cesspool hospital, you guys!\n\nElsewhere, Zola\u2019s sick! She\u2019s outgrown the shunt Derek (his name still induces a gasp) put in for her spina bifida when she first arrived at Seattle Grace Mercy West \u2014 yes, it was that long ago! \u2014 and Tom Koracick needs to go in and adjust. Sure, it\u2019s a \u201croutine surgery\u201d and Tom is \u201cthe best,\u201d but this is brain surgery! On a child! And as Meredith points out, \u201chave you seen [her] life?\u201d She has a notorious track record for things taking like, super bad turns.\n\nMeredith is stuck hanging out in a private waiting room as Zola goes under the knife. It\u2019s a terrible situation to be in since not only is she worried about her daughter, but several other troubling items: Meredith was supposed to be in court to answer for all the missed hours of community service. Not showing up could be a huge problem.\n\nThere\u2019s also a lot of tension with DeLuca. That dude just can\u2019t win! Meredith bites his head off when he suggests she go to her court appearance during Zola\u2019s surgery to, you know, avoid jail time. And then she gets angry again when he offers to sit out of Zola\u2019s surgery and wait with her, if she needs him. Meredith is having a day, sure, but she is harsh on this guy who is just looking out for her. Thankfully, her sisters call her out on how she\u2019s treating this very kind man who loves her. Not that it helps: In less than a minute she goes from calling him just a fun, hot guy to sleep with to saying she\u2019s in love with him to admitting that she doesn\u2019t know what she wants from DeLuca, she\u2019s waiting for her gut to tell her.\n\nJust last season she spent time realizing that DeLuca had a lot of depth to him and he really understood Meredith and he spoke very hot Italian while in elevators. Now he\u2019s a dummy who doesn\u2019t get it because he\u2019s not a parent? Of course Meredith wasn\u2019t going to leave the hospital while Zola was in surgery, but she acts as if that was the most offensive suggestion one human could ever make to another human. Sure, Meredith admits to being an ass, but DeLuca deserves better than this! The sooner Meredith gets back into an operating room, the better. For all of us.\n\nIt looks like that won\u2019t be happening right away. After we learn Zola\u2019s surgery was a complete success and Meredith thanks both Tom and DeLuca, Meredith\u2019s beleaguered lawyer Nancy shows up. She was able to convince the judge that Meredith really did have a medical emergency and that she should allow Meredith to make up her missed community service hours. The judge agrees to it \u2014 but she won\u2019t be making it up back with the trash pickup group. She\u2019ll be making up those hours in jail.\n\nSo, I guess Orange is the New Grey, too.\n\nLaughter Is the Best Medicine, Apart From Real Medicine\n\n\u2022 Obviously, I don\u2019t want Webber to cheat on Catherine (those two seem really broken, huh?) with Gemma, but Gemma propositioning him by detailing his entire history of having affairs when times get tough was ballsy. Be better, Webber!\n\n\u2022 To distract Meredith from her bevy of problems during Zola\u2019s surgery, Amelia starts talking about how insane it is that she hardly knows Link, yet will be tied to him for life. Bless Maggie and Mer for calling Amelia out for being impetuous, always: \u201cI had a brain tumor,\u201d Amelia offers as an explanation. \u201cYou also have a personality apart from that tumor,\u201d Meredith reminds her.\n\n\u2022 \u201cMy gut only says yes. [\u2026] It screams yes!\u201d Hey, at least Amelia is self-aware now.\n\n\u2022 The joy on Maggie\u2019s face when she comes out of her quadruple valve replacement is a thing to behold. She giddily admits that she felt more in love and seen during that surgery than she ever did with Jackson. \u201cI think surgery might be my truest love, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s ever going to change,\u201d Maggie tells her sisters. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think it needs to,\u201d Meredith affirms. Cristina Yang would be so proud.\n\n\u2022 Mer\u2019s burnt-orange trench: Yes, please.", "description": "That hyperbaric chamber is just a drama incubator, isn\u2019t it?
