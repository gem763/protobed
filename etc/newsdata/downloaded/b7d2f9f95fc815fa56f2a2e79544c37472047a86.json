Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nMr. Morey deleted and apologized for the tweet, but it led China\u2019s state broadcaster to cancel plans to show a pair of preseason games in that country and even asked the NBA to fire Mr. Morey, which China denies. Chinese NBA stores also pulled Rockets\u2019 merchandise from their shelves.\n\nThe controversy has forced NBA superstars and coaches to choose sides, and Mr. Pence shared his disappointment that many big names have chosen to side against Mr. Morey.\n\n\u201cSome of the NBA\u2019s biggest players and owners, who routinely exercise their freedom to criticize this country, lose their voices when it comes to the freedom and rights of other peoples,\u201d Mr. Pence said. \u201cIn siding with the Chinese Communist Party and silencing free speech, the NBA is acting like a wholly owned subsidiary of the authoritarian regime.\u201d\n\nMr. Barkley, who was attending a TNT pregame show with NBA Commissioner Adam Silver on Thursday, told the vice president to \u201cshut the hell up.\u201d\n\n\u201cVice President Pence needs to shut the hell up, number one,\u201d Mr. Barkley said. \u201cAll American companies are doing business in China. I thought the criticism of Commissioner Silver and LeBron James was unfair. Daryl Morey \u2014 who I like \u2014 he can say whatever he wants to. But there are consequences.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why these holier-than-thou politicians \u2014 if they\u2019re so worried about China, why don\u2019t they stop all transactions with China? President Trump has been talking about and arguing with tariffs for China for the last two years. I think it\u2019s unfair for them to do all their business in China and just because this thing happens try to make the NBA and our players look bad. All American companies do business in China. Period.\u201d\n\nThe NBA originally said the tweet was \u201cregrettable,\u201d but Mr. Silver supported Mr. Morey and his right to freedom of speech, leading to the feud to continue nearly a month later.\n\nLakers\u2019 star player, LeBron James, criticized Mr. Morey\u2019s comments on China as not being \u201ceducated\u201d while Shaquille O\u2019Neal said the situation was \u201cunfortunate for both parties,\u201d but that \u201cDaryl Morey was right.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
