Joyce Beatty (D-Ohio), who pressed him on Facebook\u2019s ongoing civil rights audit that aims to take stock of the company's policies, content and internal operations. Facebook has touted the audit as a signal of its commitment to diversity as it fights allegations its biased against minorities. But Zuckerberg stumbled as Beatty asked him to name the recommendations from the audit\u2019s recent edition. He couldn\u2019t name the law firm that is conducting it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like you think this is a joke,\u201d Beatty slammed. \u201cWhen you have ruined the lives of many people, discriminated against them.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg also said he didn\u2019t know what percentage of Facebook users are African American, even though the congresswoman said he was recently sent a report from Pew Research that included that data.\n\n\u201cMaybe you just don\u2019t read a lot of things that deal with civil rights and African Americans,\u201d Beatty added, calling his responses \u201cappalling and disgusting.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s strained responses will only provide more ammunition to critics who say the social network isn\u2019t doing enough to keep minorities safe online. Facebook could also see its political headaches intensify amid broad concerns about hate speech on the platform and evidence that African Americans were disproportionately targeted by Russian actors interfering on the company\u2019s platforms in the 2016 election.\n\nZuckerberg also couldn't answer questions about diversity among Facebook's partners. Beatty cut him off as the Facebook CEO struggled to answer whether any of Facebook's cash is managed by diverse-owned companies. He said he didn't know how many of the law firms with which the company works are minority-owned, or how many women and minorities work on Facebook's legal cases.\n\nRep. William Lacy Clay (D-Mo.) pressed Zuckerberg on the lack of civil rights experience among the company's senior leadership. Zuckerberg said there are employees with that experience. Zuckerberg admitted, however, that he was unaware of whether any of the companies Facebook is partnering with to launch its digital currency through the Libra Association are led by people of color, women or people who identify as LGBT.\n\n\u201cFacebook's diversity failures include an abysmal record of hiring and promoting people of color and women, contracting with diverse suppliers and investing in a diverse asset managers,\u201d Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) and chair of the House Financial Services Committee said at the conclusion of the hearing.\n\nZuckerberg's lack of preparation on diversity issues was especially striking because lawmakers announced the hearing would be focused on discrimination in housing advertising. As my colleague Tony Romm noted, lawmakers handed Zuckerberg a beating on a broad range of issues outside of the hearing's topics \u2014 but it's fair to say Facebook and Zuckerberg should have known these kinds of questions were coming.\n\nThe tech titan couldn\u2019t have picked a worse time to be caught off guard. There\u2019s a growing rift between Facebook and civil rights groups over Zuckerberg\u2019s recent remarks on free speech. The groups say Facebook is abdicating its responsibility to protect people of color by not subjecting political posts to its community standards in many cases or fact-check political ads.\n\nRep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) raised those concerns during yesterday\u2019s hearing, saying Facebook permits a \u201clower standard for truthfulness and decency\u201d for politicians, saying: \u201cIt is hate speech, it\u2019s hate, and it\u2019s leading to violence and death threats in my office.\u201d\n\nMuslim Advocates, a civil rights group that has been critical of Facebook, said Zuckerberg\u2019s responses at Tuesday\u2019s hearing showed he \u201cabdicated his responsibility.\u201d\n\n\u201cFacebook needs to immediately end its policy allowing false ads and must enforce its community standards robustly and consistently before more people are put in harm\u2019s way,\u201d the group said in a statement.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) also pressed Zuckerberg on Facebook's fact-checking policy in a fiery exchange, pressing him to answer in simple yes or no form whether Facebook intended to allow false content to remain on its platform.\n\n\u201cWell Congresswoman, I think lying is bad and I think if you were to run an ad that had a lie, that would be bad. That's different from it being \u2014 from it \u2014 in our position the right thing to do to prevent your constituents or people in an election from seeing that you have lied,\u201d Zuckerberg said.\n\nLawmakers also pressed Zuckerberg on Facebook's handling of hate speech, which has long been a concern among civil rights leaders. Tlaib asked Zuckerberg to explain whether a photo of a man holding a rifle outside a mosque is permitted on the social-networking site.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m in a position right now to evaluate any given post against all the different standards right now,\u201d Zuckerberg replied.\n\nRep. Sean Casten (D-Ill.) called Zuckerberg's response \"rather shocking\" when he pressed him on whether Facebook would allow a member of the American Nazi Party running for office to purchase an ad that included hate speech otherwise prohibited.\n\n\u201cCongressman, I think that depends on a bunch of specifics that I\u2019m not familiar with this case and can\u2019t answer to,\u201d Zuckerberg said.\n\nYou are reading The Technology 202, our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.

Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) speaks with Facebook Chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg after a House Financial Services Committee hearing in Washington on Wednesday. (Erin Scott/Reuters)\n\nBITS: Zuckerberg doubled down on his defense of Facebook\u2019s plans to push into cryptocurrency as lawmakers from both parties expressed concerns about Libra.\n\nThe CEO said that Libra wouldn\u2019t launch anywhere in the world without approval from U.S. regulators \u2014 but he did not specify which regulators and wouldn\u2019t commit to waiting for a green light from Congress. The remarks did little to reassure Democrats, who tore into the tech titan.\n\n\u201cFacebook\u2019s slogan for a long time was \u2018move fast, break things.\u2019 Mr. Zuckerberg \u2014 we do not want to break the international monetary system,\u201d said Rep. Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez (D-N.Y.)\n\n\u201cWhen we have blurred the lines between banking and commerce, we\u2019ve run into problems,\u201d said Rep. Chuy Garcia (D-Ill.), who asked Zuckerberg whether the Securities and Exchange Commission should regulate Libra as a bank. \u201cFacebook has operated as a shadow government with you as its head.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg dodged the question.\n\nRepublicans were more receptive to Facebook's plans, but had questions about why the Libra coalition was based in Switzerland.\n\n\u201cThere is a very competitive environment we have around the globe with enormous competition \u2026 so I think it's important that we encourage responsible innovation here in the United States,\u201d said Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.).\n\nThe Facebook app is displayed on an iPhone. (Johannes Berg/Bloomberg News)\n\nNIBBLES: Facebook will launch a \u201cNews\u201d tab on Friday curating stories from hundreds of organizations, some of which Facebook will pay for supplying content, people familiar with the plan tell my colleague Craig Timberg. The platform's shift back to news delivery comes as it endures federal and state antitrust scrutiny for its impact on the advertising industry. Facebook's critics accuse the company of \"killing\" local news as advertisers shift away from newspapers and toward digital platforms.\n\nThe list of participating news organizations, initially totaling about 200, will include The Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal and BuzzFeed News as well as local news outlets, people familiar with the project say. But critics say the change could disproportionately benefit already lucrative media companies. While some partners will receive payments of up to millions of dollars, others will be limited to generating revenue only when Facebook chooses to feature their stories.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to have this for the whole news ecosystem,\u201d said David Chavern, president and chief executive of the News Media Alliance, representing nearly 2,000 U.S.-based news organizations. \u201cSo while it\u2019s a start, and a good start, it\u2019s not a comprehensive solution.\u201d\n\nThe House antitrust subcommittee held a hearing this summer about Big Tech\u2019s impact on news as part of its broad probe of competition in Silicon Valley.\n\nFacebook declined to comment on the service's launch date or participants, but Zuckerberg hinted at the announcement during a congressional hearing yesterday. The CEO will appear at an event in New York on Friday with the chief executive of the Wall Street Journal's parent company.\n\nAmazon warehouse. (Philippe Lopez/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nBYTES: Amazon retailers continue to offer clothing from Bangladeshi factories that most major U.S. retailers stopped doing business with because of safety standards, Justin Scheck, Jon Emont and Alexandra Berzon at the Wall Street Journal found. The questionable sourcing practices raise concerns over the company's oversight of its third-party sellers as it faces scrutiny from regulators in Washington.\n\nThe Journal found apparel on Amazon from factories flagged by safety-monitoring groups for safety problems including crumbling buildings, broken alarms, and missing sprinklers and fire barriers. Amazon lays out general sourcing requirements for suppliers and has conducted 150 audits of Bangladeshi suppliers in the past year, the company tells the Journal. But it doesn't explicitly monitor that third-party sellers, which sourced about two-thirds of the items identified by the Journal, comply with guidelines banning products that involve child or forced labor.\n\n\u201cThe standards require selling partners to consistently monitor and enforce those standards in their own operations and supply chain,\u201d Amazon told the Journal. Amazon has removed some listings flagged by the Journal and is in the process of reviewing others.\n\nThe Journal also found some items sourced from the factories in question on Walmart.com and one banned factory on Target\u2019s website, even though the companies have agreed to honor bans posed by two safety groups. Many retailers stopped doing business with the factories after a 2013 factory collapse killed more than 1,100 people in Bangladesh, just as Amazon was launching its own clothing retail strategy. Walmart spokeswoman Marilee McInnis told the Journal the company was looking into the items for sale directly by Walmart; Target removed its listing after the Journal flagged it but declined to comment.\n\nAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.\n\nPUBLIC CLOUD\n\nThis undated handout image obtained October 23, 2019 courtesy of Google shows Sundar Pichai with one of Google's quantum computers in the Santa Barbara lab.

The White House signed a law dedicating $1.2 billion in quantum research funding over the next five years in December and recently launched an advisory committee to push U.S. quantum research forward.\n\nIvanka Trump, daughter of President Trump and White House Advisor, tweeted about the breakthrough:\n\n#QIS is a critical industry of the future.
