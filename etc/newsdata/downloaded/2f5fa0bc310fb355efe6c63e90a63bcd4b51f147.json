RBA just released the from their October meeting, although the underlying message remains consistent; expect rates to remain low, they could go lower, and employment and consumption are key metrics. That said, there are signs that they\u2019re thinking about how low rates really should go, having discussed keeping rate cuts in reserve for emergencies, and the risks that low rates would inflate (already overinflated?!) home and asset prices.\n\nThe reaction was minimal at best although, on the domestic front, Thursday\u2019s employment report could provide the catalyst for volatility. Whilst employment growth remains strong, RBA expect it to slow. Given full-time employment is now softening on a year-over-year basis and is rising against RBA\u2019s wishes, then a worse than expected employment report on Thursday could bring forward expectations of another RBA cut. And this is before we add Chinese data to the mix.\n\nCalendar\n\nStill, with so much data on tap, it can also muddy the waters where price action is concerned. Whilst weak data from China and AU is generally a bearish case for the , that\u2019s quite a few data points we\u2019d need to see miss the mark. Furthermore, if data from China gets too bad, it can inadvertently trigger a risk-on rally as markets assume yet more fiscal policy is on the cards from Beijing (after the initial knee-jerk, bearish reaction). Of course, we\u2019ll have to wait for the data to come in to confirm, but it could also surprise to the upside and support AUD. So for now, here\u2019s a couple of potential setups which may be of interest for bulls, if the data allows.\n\nEUR/AUD Daily Chart\n\n: This cross may not provide the nicest of trends on the daily chart, yet when volatility erupts it can provide large swings. In the last week for July, for example, it rallied over 5.5% in 11 sessions in practically a straight line, which could have also provided shallow pullbacks and continuation patterns on lower timeframes. Yet recently prices have been coiling within a potential bearish wedge. As this follows on from a move lower, we\u2019re looking for a break lower as part of a continuation patter.\n\nThe rebound from 1.5900 is coiling and shows potential for a bearish wedge pattern\n\nResistance has been found below a 61.8% Fibonacci level, with a double top pattern sitting around 1.6370\n\nBears could look for a break below 1.6200 to confirm a breakout from the wedge and target the low around 1.5900\n\nHowever, wedge needn\u2019t be perfect and remain within their converging trendlines. It\u2019s also possible we could see another high before the peak is in, so allow for some noise around these levels. Ideally, we want to see clearly that bearish momentum has returned.\n\nAUDNZD Daily Chart\n\n: Prices are trading within a potential corrective channel / flag, although there\u2019s also the risk we could see it recycle lower within the pattern before it\u2019s bullish breakout. In some way this would be preferred, as it could improve potential reward to risk ratio for bulls.\n\nThe daily structure remains bullish above 1.0665 and the 50-day eMA has acted as support. Bulls could look for a break of the channel to signal the next leg higher.\n\nInitial bullish target is the 1.0840 high, followed by 1.0900.\n\nStill, if the bearish channel is to deepen, we could use the zone around 1.0620/23 as the next line of defence for bulls; therefor, a break below 1.0620/23 invalidates the bullish bias.\n\nOriginal Post", "description": "Forex Analysis by City Index (Matt Simpson) covering: AUD/USD, EUR/AUD, AUD/NZD.
