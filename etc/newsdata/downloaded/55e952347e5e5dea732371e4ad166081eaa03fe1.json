(Charley Gallay/Getty Images/Quay Australia)\n\nOn Sunday night, Chrissy Teigen was preparing for her daughter\u2019s first day of school with a tradition familiar to parents across the country: listing 3-year-old Luna\u2019s favorite things in bright, multicolored letters on a framed chalkboard sign.\n\nBut as the model, cookbook author and TV personality would later tell her 11 million Twitter followers, the night had taken a weird turn. President Trump saw Teigen\u2019s husband, singer John Legend, on an MSNBC town hall about criminal justice reform and fired off angry tweets, lamenting that the special had not mentioned the expansive bipartisan criminal justice bill he signed in December.\n\nOne of Trump\u2019s targets was Legend \u2014 one of the president\u2019s most vocal celebrity critics \u2014 whom he called \u201cboring.\u201d But Trump didn\u2019t stop there \u2014 he also referenced the EGOT winner\u2019s \u201cfilthy mouthed wife.\u201d\n\nThe model has made no secret of her disdain for Trump, who famously blocked her on the social media platform during his first year in office. But his mention of her in a tweet about criminal justice reform was baffling. \u201cThe absolute best part of his tweet is I literally didn\u2019t speak in the special, nor was I mentioned,\u201d Teigen mused. In another, pointedly filthy mouthed tweet, she characterized the president using three expletives (at least two of which the president has also used) that became a widely shared hashtag.\n\n[Trump slams \u2018boring\u2019 John Legend, \u2018filthy mouthed\u2019 Chrissy Teigen for not crediting his criminal justice reform]\n\nThe exchange captured the type of vitriol that Teigen (and other less famous women) often faces on social media. Trump\u2019s critics were quick to note that he has a pattern of attacking women of color in particular; he was widely criticized in July for telling four Democratic congresswomen of color to \u201cgo back\u201d to \u201cthe totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.\u201d\n\nTeigen, who first cultivated a vibrant social media presence with pithy posts about food, has weathered a barrage of social media criticism \u2014 about her parenting, her marriage, her career and, as noted in a 2014 New York Times profile, her weight. Trump\u2019s tweet certainly wasn\u2019t the first time that she had been reduced to her relationship with her husband, who notably referenced the president\u2019s spouse, first lady Melania Trump, in his own response. After years of unsolicited commentary from strangers on social media, she has perfected a knack for witty, discussion-ending retorts that often leave deleted tweets in their wake.\n\nWhen a Twitter user posted a \u201crespectful\u201d inquiry as to whether Teigen was \u201cpregnant again,\u201d she responded: \u201cI just had a baby but thank you for being soooo respectful.\u201d\n\nAfter she was criticized for sharing a photo of her breast-feeding her son (and pretending to feed a doll, at her daughter\u2019s request), Teigen wrote: \u201cI don\u2019t care to see grainy fireworks, coachella selfies or infinity pool pics but i let people live.\u201d\n\nWhen Legend posted a photo of Teigen bottle-feeding their son, Miles, one Instagram user pressed: \u201cYou no longer breastfeed?\u201d The model could have pointed out that many breast-feeding moms feed their children pumped breast milk (or that it was simply none of the commenter\u2019s business), but she went with: \u201cJohn never breastfed Miles.\u201d\n\nShe once politely thanked a critic for offering notes on a recent magazine cover, adding \u201cif you could please send me specific tips and tricks (or past covers you\u2019ve shot for reference!) that would be so awesome.\"\n\nThere are many more examples, often captured by the commentsbychrissyteigen Instagram and chronicled at least annually by BuzzFeed. Occasionally, Teigen\u2019s retorts lead the offending social media users to apologize. When she lobbed an expletive at a Twitter user who asserted she had \u201cno discernible talent,\u201d the user admitted he sometimes \u201cforget[s] there are real people with real feelings on the other side of the screen.\"\n\n\u201cI see this and appreciate what you\u2019ve said,\u201d Teigen wrote back. She has admitted that, despite appearances, the criticism often gets to her. \u201cMuch stronger people are like \u2018I don\u2019t care what you think,\u2019\u201d she told Vogue last year. \u201cI genuinely do care.\u201d\n\n[Celebrities get slammed for everything online \u2014 even how they grieve]\n\nStill, Teigen\u2019s feisty comebacks have earned her a perpetually growing fan base, which on Monday included just about every late-night host. Trevor Noah gleefully repeated the model\u2019s rare triple-expletive for Trump, noting that the profanity had presented a challenge for cable news stations. \u201cShe just beat Trump at Twitter and nicknames,\u201d Stephen Colbert quipped. Jimmy Kimmel told viewers that Teigen\u2019s retort got \u201calmost 10 times as many likes\u201d as Trump\u2019s tweet. \u201cWhich, I think, means she\u2019s our new president, right?\u201d he joked.\n\nEven Meghan McCain, who regularly spars with her liberal co-hosts on \u201cThe View,\u201d declared her support for Teigen.\n\nSince when is there something wrong with being a filthy mouthed wife? \ud83d\ude1c #teamchrissy \u2014 Meghan McCain (@MeghanMcCain) September 9, 2019\n\nThe model, unlike the notoriously criticism-averse president, also has a penchant for making fun of herself. In July, she accidentally tweeted the full first episode of \u201cBring the Funny,\u201d the NBC comedy competition she began co-hosting over the summer, instead of an intended clip. \u201cWell it looks like I have been fired for posting the whole thing thank u all for your kind texts and DMs please send job opportunities to same number,\u201d she joked.\n\nAfter her presidential riposte went viral, Teigen went back to her social media roots, sharing a video late Sunday night of her eating takeout pasta. She later reported that some of it had ended up on her couch. \u201cKarma,\u201d she concluded, was also that string of three curse words she applied to the president.\n\nRead more:\n\n\u2018Trump\u2019s job creation certainly helped me!\u2019 says a presidential impersonator who is making bank\n\nIn the Kale Smoothie Era of Democratic politics, 2020 candidates race to embody self-care", "description": "The model turned cookbook author and TV personality has long had a knack for shutting down Internet critics, whether they're mom shamers or President Trump.", "authors": ["Bethonie Butler", "Reporter Covering Television", "Pop Culture", "September At Pm", "Bethonie Butler Writes About Television", "Pop Culture For The Washington Post.
