I felt very guilty about it, I felt like I shouldn\u2019t be leaving her.\u2019\n\nScott continued to say that his situation shouldn\u2019t be about him, before adding: \u2018But what you find is you get very tired otherwise, especially with the relentless nature of Alzheimer\u2019s.\u2019\n\nThe EastEnders star suffers from Alzheimer\u2019s (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nAddressing the much loved EastEnders star\u2019s condition, he said: \u2018People saying the same thing to you and asking you the same thing time and time again, over and over\u2026 It does drain you, and when you go to bed your mind is just\u2026\n\n\u2018Because, you know you have to understand that to them that\u2019s the first time they\u2019ve said it in their head and it might be the 20th time they said it that night.\n\n\u2018But when I answer Barbara, I always smile whether that\u2019s the first time or the tenth time, I just smile and I answer as if I\u2019ve never heard it before.\u2019\n\nThe understanding husband explained: \u2018It\u2019s better for you yourself. We are all humans at the end of the day and it would be very easy for you to feel impatient at times.\n\n\u2018We are humans, we are complex creatures it\u2019s hard not to get irritable. So for me, that\u2019s why the smiling helps.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
