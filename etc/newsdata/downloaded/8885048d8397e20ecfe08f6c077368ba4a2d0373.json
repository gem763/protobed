With its release yesterday, policymakers who oppose further rate cuts now have considerable support for their views.\n\nThe so-called Beige Book, which is based on interviews and conversations with business contacts outside the Fed system, is prepared ahead of each meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and is usually released about two weeks before each scheduled FOMC meeting. It's intended to be a qualitative counterweight to the quantitative input from economic data and usually doesn\u2019t draw much attention.\n\nWith the FOMC sharply divided on what to do at its this month, however, the Beige Book's input is more significant than usual. Still, whether it can actually sway the panel from going ahead with a remains to be seen.\n\nThe overall report qualifies growth as \u201cmodest\u201d and identifies weak points, but it paints a picture of an economy that is bubbling along in spite of trade tensions, inverted yield curves, and other headwinds.\n\nTransportation activity, for instance, \u201csoftened\u201d and home sales remained \u201cconstrained\u201d because of low inventory and flat housing starts. The report, in line with this week\u2019s decline in the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s purchasing managers\u2019 index, acknowledged that , but only \u201cslightly.\u201d\n\nTourism activity, however, was \u201csolid,\u201d consumer spending was mixed with modest growth in auto sales. Leasing and lending developed positively and nonfinancial services showed progress.\n\nThe report said contacts were concerned about the eventual impact of tariffs and trade tensions, but didn\u2019t think they were already affecting prices or economic activity. The Boston Fed report concluded that outlooks in the district, which encompasses all of New England, were \u201cguardedly optimist to generally positive.\u201d\n\nIn short, it doesn\u2019t sound like people are clutching at the hope of some immediate monetary stimulus. No wonder, then, that Boston Fed chief this week repeated his conviction that the economy is \u201crelatively strong\u201d and doesn\u2019t need lower interest rates.\n\nRosengren, who is a voting member of the FOMC this year, wants to keep the Fed\u2019s powder dry for when action is truly needed. He dissented from the decision in July to cut the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate by a quarter-point and indicated he is likely to vote against a rate cut this month, too.\n\nKansas City Fed chief Esther George, who also dissented from the July rate decision, reiterated her belief that the economy is strong and not in need of monetary stimulus at this time. At an event last week in St. Joseph, Missouri, she said that though trade uncertainty is clearly hurting farmers, is more than offsetting that negative impulse.\n\nThe Beige Book report from her district, which extends over seven Western states, mentioned consumer strength in retail, auto, restaurant and tourism sectors.\n\nRichmond\u2014which takes in the Carolinas, Virginia, Maryland and West Virginia\u2014reported increased activity in ports, tourism and nonfinancial services. Both residential and commercial real estate were stable to improving modestly. Manufacturers and trucking companies reported declines.\n\nRichmond Fed President added his voice last week to those FOMC members who are cautious about further cuts in rates. \u201cAn option is best valued at the end of its time period rather than in the middle,\u201d he said, indicating he would prefer to wait with more cuts.\n\nHe particularly objected to taking action because of concerns about inflation, which he doesn\u2019t think should be part of the equation right now. He is concerned about growth, but he said he hasn\u2019t spoken to a single firm in his district that is downsizing.\n\nBarkin is not a voting member of the FOMC this year. As well, it\u2019s hard to know whether the moderately optimistic tone of the Beige Book and the resistance of several policymakers to a rate cut will be enough to deter Fed Chair Jerome Powell from what markets see as his intention to cut rates again in September.", "description": "Market Overview Analysis by Darrell Delamaide/Investing.com covering: .
