I am overwhelmed,\" Anderson told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel after learning of Cher's offer \u2014 one that he might take up. Anderson said he will sue if the district doesn't reinstate his job.\n\nThe national criticism of Anderson's firing came just as hundreds of Madison students walked out of their classrooms to protest Anderson's firing, marching two miles to the school district's offices.\n\n\"The outcry from the students that I\u2019ve worked with has just been amazing and it\u2019s been so uplifting \u2014 it just shows that I was doing something right,\" he said.\n\nMembers of the school's black student union, which includes Anderson's son, met with the district's superintendent and school board president Friday about the episode.\n\n\"Anything that involves us, our voices will be heard,\" Noah Anderson said to a crowd of about 1,000 after meeting with the district officials.\n\nAnderson, 48, said Friday in an interview with the Journal Sentinel that he was \"doing a lot better\" than days earlier.\n\nOn Oct. 9, Anderson was escorting a disruptive male student out of the West High School building when the student started calling Anderson the N-word after pushing the school's assistant principal and threatening to beat her up.\n\nIn responding to the abusive language, Anderson says he said the word himself in making a point to the student not to use it.\n\n\"Every type of N-word you can think of, that\u2019s what he was calling me,\" Anderson said. \"I said, do not call me that name. I'm not your N-word. Do not call me that.\"\n\nWest High School Principal Karen Boran later that week pulled Anderson aside, he said, and told him he had \"an uphill battle\" to keep his job. And in a letter Wednesday, Boran told parents a staff member \u2014 Anderson \u2014 would not be returning to the school after an investigation of the incident.\n\n\"As you know, our expectation when it comes to racial slurs has been very clear,\" Boran wrote. \"Regardless of context or circumstance, racial slurs are not acceptable in our schools.\"\n\nAnderson called the policy \"lazy.\"\n\n'Pick up my book, slave': Black students face hostile environment at Ohio school district\n\n\"You can\u2019t eliminate racism by ignoring it \u2014 by trying to hide the word or by trying to legislate the word,\" he said. \"What if a white student calls a black student an N-word, but doesn\u2019t say the word? It's the intent behind what you\u2019re saying.\"\n\nMadison School District Superintendent Jane Belmore in a statement Friday said the district wants to take a strong stand against the use of racial slurs but also suggested officials will review the policy that prompted Anderson's firing.\n\n\"All of us here know that education is a dynamic social process. Sometimes it gets messy when we have to grapple together around deeply held values like what it means to be anti-racist,\" Belmore said in a statement to students who marched to her office Friday.\n\n\"Let me be clear,\" she continued, \"there is no doubt that language matters and racial slurs are harmful. However, at this point, we have an opportunity to look more deeply into the response to the use of racial slurs in our schools.\"", "description": "A security guard lost his job after 11 years for telling an unruly student to quit using the N-word by using the word himself.", "authors": ["Molly Beck", "Milwaukee Journal Sentinel"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0mk7TTBtKn_ABuwwSo89Kg--~B/aD0yNzM3O3c9NDE4NTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/a7ad553ff1ef8a8f03e40ddc22ebba14", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
