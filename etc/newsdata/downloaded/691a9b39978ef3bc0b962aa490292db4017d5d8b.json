He delivered a legendary performance.", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cI just gave it everything I had,\u201d Strasburg said later. \u201cI'm pretty tired.\u201d\n\nThe right-hander\u2019s gem, combined with the offense awakening, keyed a 7-2 victory Tuesday that saved the team\u2019s season. Strasburg can opt out of his contract after the season, and it looked he\u2019d have to decide soon after the first inning, when he allowed his only two runs of the night. Then he heard he was tipping pitches again, tweaked his delivery and mowed through the Astros in what became one of the most clutch playoff starts in recent memory. He became the first pitcher to go at least 8 \u2153 innings while allowing two or fewer runs in a World Series elimination game since Curt Schilling in 1993.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThat was tremendous,\u201d Manager Dave Martinez said he told Strasburg. \u201cYou picked us all up, and we're going to Game 7 because of your performance.\u201d\n\nStrasburg had helped carry them to Game 6 in the first place. His three scoreless innings in his first career relief appearance during the wild-card game staved off elimination. So did his gutty, six-inning start in Game 5 of the National League Division Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers. The win Tuesday made him the second pitcher ever to go 5-0 in one postseason.\n\nWhat Strasburg has left now that they\u2019re here is unclear. He sounded pessimistic when asked if he could come out of the bullpen in Game 7. It could be a deke (he usually long-tosses the day after his starts), or it could be genuine (he finished with 104 or more pitches for the fourth straight outing). But he gave the pitcher\u2019s signal for no more \u2014 \u201cI emptied the tank tonight\u201d \u2014 and emphasized the trust in his teammates, that \u201cit\u2019s going to take all 25 of us.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIf this was Strasburg\u2019s last game as a National, then he will have ended his career here with about as much hype as he began it. That is a feat he and those around him long considered impossible. He came to the Nationals as the No. 1 overall pick in 2009, billed as a generational talent.\n\nThe intervening years \u2014 the disappointing ones that contained flashes of brilliance \u2014 now look like prologue to what could be a brilliant final act. This season, Strasburg reinvented himself, rededicated himself to conditioning and remained healthy all season. He stopped relying on the 100-mph fastball that once made him a can\u2019t-miss prospect and has lost a few ticks since. He instead learned to pitch, leaning on the veteran\u2019s tool of deception with his curveball and change-up.\n\nIt all built to Tuesday. The Nationals seized the lead in the first, but Strasburg coughed it up by allowing a double and a homer in the first. Pitching coach Paul Menhart suspected he was tipping his pitches, as he had earlier this postseason, and told him to \u201cbutterfly\u201d his glove to prevent it. Strasburg settled in and gave the team the stopgap it needed to catch up.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStrasburg was mocked earlier in his career for failing unless the conditions were perfect. He proved that was no longer the case again in Game 6, when he lost his command in the middle of the fourth \u2014 throwing 10 balls in 11 pitches and walking two batters \u2014 then charging back to strike out Carlos Correa. He did it again in the fifth, when he had runners on second and third with one out, when he seemed ready to give another lead back. He struck out Jos\u00e9 Altuve and got Michael Brantley to ground out \u2014 two of the series\u2019 best hitters, neutralized. He managed what few pitchers had this season against the Astros, perhaps the best testament to his greatness Tuesday: He got Houston hitters to chase.\n\nStrasburg plowed through the rest of the lineup, retiring the last eight hitters before bench coach Chip Hale came to relieve him in the ninth. He had, his entire career, rode shotgun to the star power of Bryce Harper or the intensity of Max Scherzer. But the Nationals no longer had Harper, and they needed him to get to Scherzer in Game 7. This moment was his, it was his alone, and he delivered.\n\n\u201cHe doesn't have anything to prove to anybody,\u201d reliever Sean Doolittle said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have anything to prove to us.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs Strasburg left the mound, second baseman Asdr\u00fabal Cabrera tapped the pitcher\u2019s back with his glove. It was a physical acknowledgment of what his teammates told him in the dugout: You did your job. Strasburg considers there to be no higher compliment.\n\nStrasburg afterward again confronted the aspect of stardom that long made him most uncomfortable. He stood in the middle of the clubhouse after the game, his back against a couch, his eyes looking out into a semicircle of swarming reporters. This used to faze him in the way pitching in front of 40,000 fans couldn\u2019t.\n\nHe listened to the questions and answered in his low, steady cadence. He didn\u2019t mind not getting the complete game because \u201cthat\u2019s kind of a personal achievement.\u201d He didn\u2019t really notice what happened to get Martinez ejected from the game because he tried not to focus on anything other than his pitching. He didn\u2019t think about the arc of his career.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut there, in all of what came before, he seemed to pause, to reveal more of himself than he normally would. He has, in his own words, \u201cbeen under a microscope my whole career.\u201d He credited his postseason performances to the attention he loathed as a younger pitcher.\n\n\u201cEverything happens for a reason,\u201d he said. \u201cI think, without those things, it would\u2019ve been a lot harder to focus on what I can control out there.\u201d\n\nThe lights flicked off. The questions stopped. The cameras and microphones and bodies receded.\n\nStrasburg, free now, resumed his beloved routine. He showered and dressed quickly, pulling on a light blue polo and gray jeans. He threw his towel in the hamper and, walking toward the clubhouse exit, glanced to his right. He glimpsed the TV in the corner. It was playing game highlights, and on the screen, he was throwing strike three by one of the seven Astros he fanned that night.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStrasburg didn\u2019t stop. He didn\u2019t smile. He didn\u2019t even hesitate. He blinked, turned his attention back to the task at hand, and walked out of the clubhouse.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The last decade, the expectations and the frustrations it contained, culminated with Tuesday night's history-making outing.", "authors": ["Sam Fortier", "Sports Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/QDBcATNJNAHmr18iFTOy7rk3uUQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2G53J7X2ZYI6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
