Ted Lieu (D-Calif.). \"The truth will keep coming out. And Trump cannot stop it.\"\n\nIn closed-door testimony described by a source in the room, Hill detailed increasing alarm among White House officials over the shadow diplomacy efforts of Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who mounted a months-long campaign to dirty Biden on unfounded charges.\n\nShe said she shared her concerns with then-National Security Adviser John Bolton who encouraged her to report her concerns about Giuliani's efforts to a National Security Council lawyer \u2014 which she did twice. Hill also connected Giuliani's efforts to Trump's acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, indicating that Bolton characterized their efforts on Ukraine as a \"drug deal.\"\n\nAccording to a source in the room Monday, Hill said Bolton compared Giuliani to \"a hand grenade who\u2019s going to blow everybody up.\"\n\nAnd the flood of damaging information surely isn't over.\n\nAs lawmakers return to Capitol Hill on Tuesday, a growing number of witnesses this week will describe their own role in the controversy, even as the White House has vowed not to engage with House Democrats\u2019 \"illegitimate\" impeachment effort.\n\nOn Wednesday, Michael McKinley, a top aide to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo \u2014 who resigned abruptly last week \u2014 intends to testify before lawmakers.\n\nOn Thursday, comes Gordon Sondland, the EU ambassador whose text messages revealed by lawmakers indicated he was aware of efforts to pressure Ukrainian officials to investigate Biden. Sondland is reportedly ready to deflect any blame on to Trump about whether there was any quid pro quo.\n\nCongressional investigators on Friday will hear from Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Laura Cooper, who oversees Russia- and Ukraine-related matters at the Pentagon.\n\nDespite the series of breakthroughs, Democrats will still face resistance from the White House to some of their high-level requests.\n\nWhen asked whether Trump's budget office planned to comply with a Tuesday subpoena deadline for documents, a senior administration official did not say, instead pointing to a White House letter last week that deemed the House impeachment probe \"unconstitutional.\"\n\nBut Hill's account underscores how the president's once-impenetrable barrier to meaningful testimony in Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry has been blown apart.\n\n\"The walls are closing in. The details we are learning about the shadow foreign policy operation Trump has been running to benefit himself personally are stunning,\" said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee late Monday. \"Why have a democracy, if we allow this to happen without consequence?\"\n\nThough Hill's testimony was the most damning to date, she wasn't the first to put a crack in Trump's wall.\n\nEarlier this month, former Ambassador Kurt Volker provided text messages between himself and other diplomats in which they described concerns that Trump was using a potential White House visit for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and possibly even military aid, as a cudgel to force the besieged country to probe Biden. Volker testified for nine hours to lawmakers and aides behind closed doors. Trump has forcefully denied any sort of \"quid pro quo\" occurred.\n\nLast Friday, former Ukrainian Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch testified about her abrupt removal by Trump, which came amid a smear campaign by Trump's allies that accused her of disloyalty. Yovanovitch's ouster in May infuriated senior State Department hands, and she testified that the ability of bad actors to engineer her removal could be exploited by foreign adversaries.\n\nMeanwhile, Giuliani, who is facing a mounting set of legal woes, is due to provide documents to Congress under a subpoena issued by the House Intelligence Committee on Tuesday, but it's unclear if he intends to cooperate.\n\nGiuliani has been defiant and indicated he intends to be watching the third game of a New York Yankees playoff series \u2014 and possibly even attend the afternoon ballgame.\n\nHouse Republicans have said little about the substance of Hill's testimony but have complained vehemently about Democrats' decision to hold witness interviews behind closed doors. They say a matter as weighty as the potential impeachment of the president should be conducted publicly.\n\nIntelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff has countered this complaint, arguing that the secrecy surrounding the initial interviews is meant to prevent witnesses from aligning their statements.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/76/ec/86e5713844988a452a1ec82bea4f/191015-fiona-hill-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
