If something else adds up to that, that would be very positive news, but this is the basis on which the European Union is committed to preserving what we have.\"\n\nOn the sidelines of the Helsinki meeting, Mogherini also met with the ministers of the E3, the three EU signatories to the Iran deal \u2014 Germany, France and the U.K. \u2014 \"to update each other and see what kind of follow up we can give to the Biarritz events.\"", "description": "The nuclear deal will continue to serve as the basis for the EU\u2019s engagement with Tehran, the bloc\u2019s top diplomat said.", "authors": ["Jacopo Barigazzi"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1164751675-1200x628.jpg"}
