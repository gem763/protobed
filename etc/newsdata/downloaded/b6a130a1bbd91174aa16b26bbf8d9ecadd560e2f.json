Sting, 68, sported a sling and was unable to play guitar on stage in France on Friday after having an 'accident with his shoulder'\n\nHe said: 'Good evening. Let me explain this. I had an accident with my shoulder. Unfortunately I cannot play my guitar this evening, but I can sing. The show must go on.'\n\nHe also appeared on a local radio station sporting his sling as concerned fans asked if he was OK.\n\nOthers joked he might have a problem performing tantric sex for six hours.\n\nSting, real name Gordon Sumner, who was last seen exploring the streets of Japan before having to wear his sling, carried on through his set and at one point even tried to shake a tambourine.\n\nHe said: 'Good evening.

I'm still a touring animal.\" [Now] I'm ready.'\n\n'Being in one place is actually a different, spiritual vibe,' he continued. 'Welcoming people into your house - that's basically what it's going to be.\n\n'I'll be telling the story of my life through songs. I've had a long, interesting life and I can't wait.'", "description": "Rocker Sting was sporting a sling for his latest run of concerts after injuring his shoulder on tour.", "authors": ["Rebecca Davison For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/09/19981192-0-image-a-5_1571645272289.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
