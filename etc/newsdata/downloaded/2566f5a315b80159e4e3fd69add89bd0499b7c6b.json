The commission meets in public, but its members can decide to hear some witnesses in private. The government says it expects the inquiry to take nine months.\n\nDaphne Caruana Galizia\u2019s son: \u2018They killed my mother but they won\u2019t stop me\u2019 Read more\n\nThe commission will be chaired by retired judge Michael Mallia, and its two other members are a litigator and professor of law at the university of Malta and a former director of forensic science laboratories at the Malta police department.\n\n\u201cGiven the gravity of its purpose and its mandate to investigate state institutions,\u201d the family said, \u201cjustice demands that the board\u2019s wider members have no financial or political links to the current political administration\u201d.\n\nIt is understood the family support the choice of Mallia as chair but have concerns about the impartiality of the other two commission members.\n\nCaruana Galizia\u2019s son, Paul, said on Twitter on Saturday morning there were \u201cserious problems with regard to the members of the Board of Inquiry announced last night\u201d.\n\nAndrew Caruana Galizia (@acaruanagalizia) Serious problems with regard to the members of the Board of Inquiry announced last night. One represents clients my mother investigated for money laundering. Another depends on the Prime Minister for his livelihood. These clear conflicts will poison the inquiry\u2019s work. https://t.co/3hP4MBdCah\n\nAccording to reports published by Maltese news outlets, one of the members, law professor and litigator Ian Refalo, has represented clients investigated by Caruana Galizia for corruption.\n\n\u201cThe establishment of a public inquiry is long overdue, and is an essential step towards justice for the assassination of Daphne Caruana Galizia,\u201d said Rebecca Vincent, UK bureau director of journalists\u2019 campaign group RSF.\n\n\u201cBut a public inquiry that lacks independence and impartiality will fool no one \u2013 and the goal remains full justice for this heinous assassination. We will remain vigilant and scrutinise the composition and actions of the board of inquiry, and act to hold the Maltese government to account.\u201d\n\nLast year the Council of Europe appointed a special rapporteur, Pieter Omtzigt, to investigate the killing. He produced a report which led to a vote by the 47-country human rights organisation, giving Malta a three-month deadline to launch an independent inquiry.\n\nOmtzigt welcomed the announcement, adding: \u201cI will now examine closely the terms of reference of the inquiry ... as well as its scope, powers and membership, before commenting further. Any such exercise must be fully independent, and its members\u2019 impartiality beyond question.\u201d\n\nIn its announcement, the Maltese government said it was important that the public inquiry should not \u201cundermine investigations and/or criminal proceedings which are pending in this case,\u201d and that it had engaged in technical discussions with officials of the Council of Europe to avoid any such risk.\n\nMuscat was a frequent target of the journalist\u2019s investigations. Caruana Galizia came under huge political pressure after revealing that members of his administration had set up secretive offshore companies shortly after entering government.", "description": "Daphne Caruana Galizia\u2019s family request meeting with Maltese PM over concerns about impartiality of panel", "authors": ["Juliette Garside"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/465d79d6a4e7818b156fed7500c00d10da82acb4/0_108_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=703982f8f2e46cd7e405bde4ea98b8fb", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
