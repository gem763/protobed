Laura Barr Photography\n\nCasano was diagnosed with Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura, or ITP, when she was 7 years old. This autoimmune disorder makes her body destroy its own platelets.\n\n\u201cWithout her IV, her platelets are dangerously low,\u201d Meghan Casano, Ella\u2019s mother, said. \u201cWhen her platelets are low, it is dangerous for her to do certain activities because of bleeding or injury.\u201d\n\nThe experience of getting an IV treatment so often can be very stressful.\n\n\u201cOne of the main things I noticed was it was very intimidating,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to hide it.\u201d Hoping to address that fear, Casano came up with the idea of a \u201cMedi Teddy,\u201d a cover with a flat back and pouch that resembles a teddy bear. Her creative and useful invention is why TODAY is honoring Casano as a Groundbreaker for International Day of the Girl.\n\n\"Medi Teddy\" covers the IV bag to create a less intimidating atmosphere for children in hospitals. The back has a see-through pouch to hold the IV bag and for medical professionals to be able to check the bag. Meghan Casano\n\n\u201cFrom a child\u2019s perspective, (a hospital can be a) very scary surrounding. Teddy bears are something children recognize and (the experience becomes) better for the child,\u201d Dr. Rebecca Pillai Riddell, assistant vice president of research at York University, said.\n\nPillai Riddell does research on the ways that regular medical procedures can cause stress in children. She says the \u201cMedi Teddy\u201d will be able to reduce stress for children who are worried or fearful as they go through a procedure.\n\n\u201cWhen you reduce stress before a medical procedure, (you) can reduce stress during and after a medical procedure,\u201d according to Pillai Riddell.\n\nCasano is hoping that her \u201cMedi Teddy\u201d can help reduce stress for other children. Since introducing her idea this summer, she's earned enough donations to get 2,000 of the teddy covers manufactured. She plans to donate them to children in hospitals across the country.\n\nThe \"Medi Teddy\" resembles a children's teddy bear. Meghan Casano\n\n\u201cWe've been getting a lot of positive feedback,\u201d Casano said. \u201cIt makes me feel really good because I know I\u2019m actually helping people with it.\u201d\n\nAnd, as of September, Casano and her mom recently got nonprofit status from the IRS. They hope this will help them expand \"Medi Teddy\" even further, and eventually start making other animals and accessories.\n\n\"We just want to be able to keep going and give Medi Teddies to all the kids who reached out to us,\" Casano said.\n\nThis article was originally published in June 2019.
