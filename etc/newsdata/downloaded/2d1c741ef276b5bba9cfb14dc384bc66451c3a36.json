And it\u2019s being heralded as a huge step forward for the agency at a time when NASA continues to work to highlight the contributions of women.\n\nAD\n\nOur #AllWomanSpacewalk is happening today!\n\n\n\nTune in to https://t.co/mzKW5uV4hS to watch @Astro_Christina & @Astro_Jessica embark on their venture to replace a failed power controller:\n\n\ud83d\udcfa 6:30am ET - Coverage begins\n\n\ud83d\udc69\ud83c\udffb\u200d\ud83d\ude80 7:50am ET - Our @NASA_Astronauts exit the @Space_Station pic.twitter.com/LUUDIH8g0v \u2014 NASA (@NASA) October 18, 2019\n\nAt a media briefing before the spacewalk, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said the agency would build on the astronauts\u2019 efforts and send the \u201cnext man and the first woman\u201d to the moon by 2024, an effort the agency has dubbed \u201cArtemis\u201d after the twin sister of Apollo.\n\nAD\n\nKoch, who is scheduled to spend 328 days aboard the station \u2014 the longest ever by a woman \u2014 has said she embraced the historic significance of the adventure she was about to embark on.\n\n\u201cIn the past, women haven\u2019t always been at the table,\u201d she said in an interview with NPR from the space station. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to be contributing to the human spaceflight program at a time when all contributions are being accepted, when everyone is having a role and that can lead in turn to an increased chance of success.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMeir said the spacewalk \u201cshows all the work that went in for the decades prior \u2014 all of the women who worked to get us to where we are today. The nice thing for us is we don\u2019t even really think about it on a daily basis. It\u2019s just normal. We\u2019re part of the team \u2026. It\u2019s really nice to see how far we have come.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nGearing up for Friday\u2019s spacewalk to help the ground teams repair one of the battery channels with @Astro_Christina.\n\n\n\n. . . first spacesuit selfie, check!\u2714\ufe0f\n\n\n\nPhotos will be much more spectacular once we pass through the hatch.

But for all the high-profile advancements, women remain an overwhelming minority among the rank and file at NASA and the industry more broadly, which has long been dominated by white men. Women make up about a third of NASA\u2019s workforce, 28 percent of senior executive leadership positions and 16 percent of senior scientific employees, according to a survey done by the agency.\n\nSpacewalks are among the mostly grueling work astronauts undertake in space. They are physically taxing and mentally challenging, astronauts have said \u2014 like taking an exam while running a marathon. And Friday\u2019s was scheduled to last five and a half hours to replace what is known as a \u201cbattery charge-discharge unit,\u201d a component that NASA said, \u201cregulates the charge to the batteries that collect and distribute solar power to the orbiting lab\u2019s systems.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBefore becoming an astronaut Koch, 40, was an electrical engineer at NASA\u2019s Goddard Spaceflight Center, where she worked on scientific instruments used in the study of cosmology and astrophysics. She later became a research associate in the U.S. Antarctic Program, which included a year-long stay at the South Pole.\n\nAD\n\nCurb appeal. It\u2019s not often I get to see my house from the outside. This photo I snapped on my spacewalk last Friday captures the habitable modules that I have called home for the last eight months. Pretty lucky to be living inside an engineering marvel. pic.twitter.com/djbnCstXfN \u2014 Christina H Koch (@Astro_Christina) October 15, 2019\n\nMeir, a scientist, has a doctorate in marine biology. She previously worked at Lockheed Martin supporting human physiology research and participating in research flights for NASA on reduced gravity aircraft as well as in an underwater habitat. She also has studied the physiology of animals in extreme environments.\n\nNASA was hoping to have an all-female spacewalk in March. But it was canceled after astronaut Anne McClain discovered that the spacesuit she was to wear did not fit properly. Instead, astronaut Nick Hague went in her place.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Christina Koch and Jessica Meir will walk outside the International Space Station just months after NASA had to cancel an all-female spacewalk because of a spacesuit-sizing problem.", "authors": ["Christian Davenport", "Reporter Covering The Defense", "Space Industries", "Lateshia Beachum"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ODr8qQC2SrY8Rp2DlKshzxhPfXI=/1440x0/smart/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/thumbnails/5c9a42cf46e0fb0009a751d2/2019-03-26T144844Z_1_OVA7NYV33_RTRMADC_0_USA-WOMEN-SPACE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
