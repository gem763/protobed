I wanted to do something with my brain,\" Thibault told AFP.\n\nTraining on a video-game avatar system for months to acquire the skills needed to operate the exoskeleton, he said he had to \"relearn\" natural movements from scratch.\n\n\"I can't go home tomorrow in my exoskeleton, but I've got to a point where I can walk. I walk when I want and I stop when I want.\"\n\nCervical spinal cord injury leaves around 20 percent of patients paralysed in all four limbs and is the most severe injury of its kind.\n\n\"The brain is still capable of generating commands that would normally move the arms and legs, there's just nothing to carry them out,\" said Alim-Louis Benabid, professor emeritus at Grenoble and lead author of the study published in The Lancet Neurology.\n\nA team of experts from the Hospital of Grenoble Alpes, biomedical firm Cinatech and the CEA research centre started by implanting two recording devices either side of Thibault's head, between the brain and the skin.\n\nThese read his sensorimotor cortex -- the area that controls motor function.\n\nEach decoder transmits the brain signals which are then translated by an algorithm into the movements the patient has thought about. It is this system that sends physical commands that the exoskeleton executes.\n\nThibault used the avatar and video game to think about performing basic physical tasks such as walking, and reaching out to touch objects.\n\nUsing the avatar, video game and exoskeleton combined, he was able to cover the length of one and a half football pitches over the course of many sessions.\n\n- 'Repaired not augmented man' -\n\nSeveral previous studies have used implants to stimulate muscles in patients' own bodies, but the Grenoble study is the first to use brain signals to control a robot exoskeleton.\n\nExperts involved in the research say it could potentially lead to brain-controlled wheelchairs for paralysed patients.\n\n\"This isn't about turning man into machine but about responding to a medical problem,\" said Benabid.\n\n\"We're talking about 'repaired man', not 'augmented man'.\n\nIn a comment piece on the study, Tom Shakespeare from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said the exoskeleton system was \"a long way from usable clinical possibility\".\n\nBut Thibault said the trial offered a \"message of hope to people like me\".\n\n\"This is possible, even with our handicap.\"", "description": "A French man paralysed in a night club accident can walk again thanks to a brain-controlled exoskeleton in what scientists said Wednesday was a breakthrough providing hope to tetraplegics seeking to regain movement.
