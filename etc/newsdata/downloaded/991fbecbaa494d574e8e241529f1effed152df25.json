It can feel like things are never going to change, but change is happening.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The event saw Taron Egerton rub shoulders with the Duchess of York\n\nShe continued: \"I didn't set out to solely make horror films, but I've always liked dark, messed-up films that are shocking and scary but make you feel something connects you to it.\n\n\"There's enough messed-up stuff in Saint Maud to keep die-hard horror fans satisfied, but it's as much a dark, complicated character study as it is a horror film.\"\n\nHugh Grant, Gemma Arterton and Dev Patel were among the celebrities in attendance at Tuesday's BFI Luminous fundraising gala.\n\nPatel plays the title role in The Personal History of David Copperfield, a new adaptation of the Charles Dickens novel which officially launches the film festival later.\n\nTimothee Chalamet, Robert De Niro and Keira Knightley are among the other stars expected during the festival, which runs until 13 October.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.
