No, nothing serious.\u201d\n\nKlopp, whose side maintained their six point lead over champions Manchester City, said conceding an early goal to the team they beat in last season\u2019s Champions League final had helped concentrate their minds.\n\nThe charismatic German \u2014 who took Liverpool agonisingly close to their first Premier league title last term only to lose out to City by a point \u2014 was delighted in the manner in which his players had responded.\n\n\u201cI am absolutely pleased, but to be honest, I expect it as well,\u201d added Klopp.\n\n\u201cAn early goal is obviously not the best thing that can happen, but sometimes it makes one thing clear: game on.\n\n\u201cThe counter-press was exceptional, it was kind of back. I loved that, that was really good.\n\n\u201cI told the boys at half-time; \u2018The only problem in this game so far is the result \u2014 apart from that, it\u2019s good\u2019.\u201d\n\npi/cw", "description": "London (AFP) \u2013 Jurgen Klopp moved to allay fears over Mohamed Salah\u2019s left ankle problem saying his departure five minutes before the end of", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/28/23be0b_egyptian-star-mohamed-salah-left-ankle-is-fine-liverpool-manager-jurgen-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
