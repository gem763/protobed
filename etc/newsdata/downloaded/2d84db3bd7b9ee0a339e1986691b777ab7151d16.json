Ignoring his mom\u2019s wishes, Ash elects to while away a day in Denska, a young ghost town. The small island\u2019s economy collapsed after a tanker spill polluted its coastal waters. Exacerbating the once-thriving fishing town\u2019s woes are gnarled vines that have infested the area, blanketing walls and clogging up machinery. This mysterious substance, which is colloquially referred to as the \u201cdarkness\u201d is a byproduct of negative mental energy. Admittedly, at no point did I become interested in the story.\n\nAsh\u2019s day is upset after a group of unruly kids snatch his notebook and scatter its pages. The kids then push Ash onto a tram that goes to a tiny island guarded by a purportedly spooky lighthouse. Ash doesn\u2019t let the kids\u2019 warnings get to him. Without much ado he sets about exploring. Inside the lighthouse Ash discovers one of the pages of his notebook on the floor. Dejected, he hangs his head in despair when Luna, the creature from his notebook, miraculously comes to life on the wall. Projecting her power from the wall, Luna mends Ash\u2019s torn notebook and gives him a magic brush.\n\nLuna signals that she\u2019d like Ash to paint a few specific designs from his notebook on the wall. Pressing the right trigger will cause Ash to take out his brush and open his notebook. Using the control pad, you can select a design from the notebook and paint it on a wall by pressing the right trigger and guiding Ash\u2019s brush using the DualShock\u2019s motion-control sensors. You can quickly and easily make fetching murals by mixing different designs. In turn, these murals can activate darkened strings of lightbulbs hanging overhead, which causes the surrounding area to light up. By the time Luna\u2019s tutorial is complete it\u2019s clear that she would like for you to revive Denska by painting throughout it.\n\nAsh is helped with his task by different genies, like Luna, who have special abilities. Fire genies, electric genies and the like can move across Ash\u2019s artwork and burn away obstacles or power up junction boxes. Genies, however, recoil at the darkness. To clear away those tangly tendrils of solid mental anguish, Ash must use super paint. Super paint can be acquired by fulfilling a genie\u2019s request for a particular mural design. You spend much of the game painting the walls of the town, lighting up all the bulbs in each area and using super paint to remove the darkness. (Toward the end, Ash\u2019s brush can be used as a projectile weapon to hurl elemental attacks at nefarious genies.)\n\nAs Ash goes about his task, he must avoid the bullies who roam around the area to avoid being thrown into a dumpster. \u201cConcrete Genie\u201d excels at capturing the feeling of what it\u2019s like to be a kid happily engaged in his own thing and the annoyance that comes from being interrupted by those with nothing better to do. Over the course of the game Ash comes to understand that his tormentors all suffer from their own inner conflicts which lead them to lash out. The plotline unambiguously sides with a nurture, as opposed to nature, reading of human failings.\n\nBecause of its unusual mechanics, I don\u2019t think \u201cConcrete Genie\u201d is a game that one can easily get a feel for from watching a trailer. I never would have guessed that I\u2019d in any way enjoy creating murals and watching funny-looking creatures scamper about them, but I did because I found it all mostly relaxing. Though a VR mode is available that allows you to paint different designs using the PlayStation Move controllers and to watch one of Ash\u2019s genies to delight in them, it\u2019s a bite-sized offering that makes for little more than a pleasant, if not particularly memorable, diversion.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cConcrete Genie\u2019s\u201d wide-eyed appreciation for creativity and offbeat gameplay make it easy to recommend to parents looking for something for elementary or middle school kids. Though it lacks three-dimensional characters, it doesn\u2019t lack for joie de vivre.\n\nChristopher Byrd is a Brooklyn-based writer.
