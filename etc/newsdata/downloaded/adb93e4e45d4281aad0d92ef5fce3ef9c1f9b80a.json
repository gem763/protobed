As a term, \u201chipster\u201d is usually reserved (often with a heavy dose of snark) as a label for expensive millennial brands with a small corporate footprint, particularly in \u201ccool\u201d neighborhoods filled with young artists and other creative types.\n\nIn a hipster coffee shop here in West LA. Right next to us we overheard a group of young women who were absolutely ecstatic to learn that Acting-AG Matthew Whitaker is preparing to SHUT DOWN Mueller pic.twitter.com/fg2EZebqbB \u2014 Jacob Wohl (@JacobAWohl) November 8, 2018\n\nIn the post above, Wohl claims to have overheard a gleeful conversation about the Mueller investigation among a group of people. He then followed-up the photo post with a more specific location: The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf in Brentwood. As Wohl himself said, the place is \u201cone of my favorite hipster coffee shops,\u201d though the sentiment is something of a running gag, and at least partly tongue-in-cheek.\n\nThe 20-year-old Wohl first rose to some level of prominence on social media in 2016 while vociferously defending then-presidential candidate Donald Trump. The former teenage hedge fund manager (who was investigated for alleged fraudulent activities, but has denied any wrongdoing) found a home and voice at right-wing website The Gateway Pundit, and most recently was behind an ill-conceived accusation of sexual misconduct against acting special counsel Robert Mueller. Vanity Fair describes him as an \u201calt-right MAGA troll\u201d and NBC has called him a \u201cconspiracy theorist.\u201d President Trump also frequently magnifies his tweets from his own personal account.\n\nThis is not the first time that prominent conservative factions have spent time in and around historically liberal Los Angeles. The far-right Proud Boys group has held a collection of meet-ups at bars around the city over the past year, with some of the events escalating into threats, police calls, and boycotts.", "description": "So-called \"MAGA troll\" Jacob Wohl has (another) bad day online", "authors": ["Farley Elliott", "Cathy Chaplin", "Mona Holmes", "Nov"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W217_oVT_UjtBu8KQH8Yhx_9FkE=/0x147:2048x1219/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13430927/coffee_bean_tea_leaf.jpg"}
