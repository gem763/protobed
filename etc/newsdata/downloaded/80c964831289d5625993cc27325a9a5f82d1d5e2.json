Facial recognition software works by matching real time images to a previous photograph of a person. Each face has approximately 80 unique nodal points across the eyes, nose, cheeks and mouth which distinguish one person from another. A digital video camera measures the distance between various points on the human face, such as the width of the nose, depth of the eye sockets, distance between the eyes and shape of the jawline. A different smart surveillance system (pictured) can scan 2 billion faces within seconds has been revealed in China. The system connects to millions of CCTV cameras and uses artificial intelligence to pick out targets. The military is working on applying a similar version of this with AI to track people across the country This produces a unique numerical code that can then be linked with a matching code gleaned from a previous photograph. A facial recognition system used by officials in China connects to millions of CCTV cameras and uses artificial intelligence to pick out targets. Experts believe that facial recognition technology will soon overtake fingerprint technology as the most effective way to identify people.\n\nThe company said it will roll out a software update to fix the issue affecting the Galaxy S10 phones.\n\nLisa Neilson, a 34-year-old mother from West Yorkshire, from West Yorkshire, discovered her phone was vulnerable when she had a plastic protector on it.\n\nWhen this screen protector was on, Mrs Neilson found, anyone's fingerprint could unlock the phone and access her apps and personal information.\n\nSamsung said yesterday it was 'aware of the case of S10's malfunctioning fingerprint recognition and will soon issue a software patch'.\n\nThe issue could arise from the patterns inside the silicone protectors are added to someone's fingerprint and confuse the phone's sensors, the company said.\n\nFingerprint-locking technology has been around for years on smartphones and is intended as an extra, impenetrable layer of security.\n\nBut Mrs Neilson, 34, told The Sun last weekend that, after she had set up the ID system with her right fingerprint, she could also open it with her left.\n\nAnd then her husband managed to unlock the phone with his own thumbprints, which weren't registered.\n\nShe said: 'This means that if anyone got hold of my phone they can access it and within moments could be into the financial apps and be transferring funds.\n\n'It's a real concern.'", "description": "The Pixel 4 was unveiled at a launch event in New York this week and a cyber security expert said the closed-eyes unlocking feature is a 'significant' security concern.", "authors": ["Sam Blanchard For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/09/19875498-0-image-a-27_1571388026821.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
