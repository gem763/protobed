The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, concluded his investigation by saying he had not found sufficient evidence to establish a criminal conspiracy between Russia and Mr. Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, but that was a narrow legal judgment.\n\nWhile the president has sought to interpret that report to mean that Russia\u2019s ties to the campaign were a \u201choax\u201d made up by his opponents, in fact Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation documented extensive contacts between Mr. Trump\u2019s associates and Russian figures.\n\nIt concluded that the Kremlin sought specifically to help Mr. Trump get elected, and Mr. Mueller said Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign welcomed Russia\u2019s help. Mr. Trump at one point even publicly called on Russia to find Hillary Clinton\u2019s missing emails, and within hours Russian agents sought to do just that by trying to break into her computer servers.\n\nIn the end, House Democrats shied away from trying to impeach Mr. Trump on those grounds since Mr. Mueller said he could not establish a criminal conspiracy. But it set the stage for the current impeachment battle.", "description": "To the founding fathers, foreign influence on an American president was an abiding fear and a basis for impeachment.", "authors": ["Peter Baker"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/28/us/politics/28dc-assess-sub1/merlin_161599218_eecd81cf-4fbc-49e8-8db9-907bb8968fcd-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
