REUTERS/Stoyan Nenov\n\nThe battle for Ras al Ain raged as Turkey pursued a four-day-old, cross-border offensive against a Syrian Kurdish militia despite an outcry from the United States and European Union and warnings of possible sanctions unless Ankara desisted.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration said Turkey\u2019s incursion was causing \u201cgreat harm\u201d in relations with its NATO ally. The head of the Arab League denounced the offensive and Germany said it was banning arms exports to Turkey, a NATO ally.\n\nThe Turkish assault has raised international alarm over its mass displacement of civilians and the risk it could trigger a revival of an Islamic State insurgency in Syria, with a heightened possibility of IS militants escaping Kurdish prisons.\n\nThe Kurdish-led administration in Syria\u2019s northeast said nearly 200,000 people had been uprooted so far by the fighting, while the U.N. World Food Programme put the figure at more than 100,000 in the towns of Tel Abyad and Ras al Ain.\n\nTurkey\u2019s stated broader objective is to set up a \u201csafe zone\u201d inside Syria to resettle many of the 3.6 million Syrian war refugees it has been hosting. Erdogan has threatened to send them to Europe if the EU did not back his assault.\n\nAnkara began its onslaught against the YPG militia, which it says is a terrorist group backing Kurdish insurgents in Turkey, after U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew some U.S. troops who had been backing Kurdish forces in the fight against IS.\n\n\u201cThe (Syrian rebel) National Army took control of (Ras al Ain) town centre this morning,\u201d a senior Turkish security official said. \u201cInspections are being conducted in residential areas. Mine and booby trap searches are being carried out.\u201d\n\nTurkey\u2019s Defence Ministry said around midday that the Turkish-backed rebel Syrian National Army had been brought under control, with officials posting photos showing deserted streets and Syrian rebels standing on Kurdish militia flags.\n\nBut the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), in which the YPG comprises the main fighting element, denied losing the centre of Ras al Ain. Marvan Qamishlo, an SDF spokesman, said his side had only carried out a \u201ctactical retreat\u201d in response to hours of heavy Turkish bombardment.\n\n\u201cNow the SDF\u2019s attack has started and there are very fierce clashes now,\u201d he told Reuters. \u201cThe clashes are continuing in the industrial district,\u201d he said, saying this was the part of Ras al Ain closest to the border.\n\nIn response, the senior Turkish official said \u201cnearly all\u201d YPG forces had fled south from Ras al Ain. Turkish artillery continued to shell parts of the town, a Reuters reporter said.\n\nThe National Army\u2019s spokesman said later in the day Turkish-backed forces had seized some districts of Ras al Ain including its industrial area while some units had pushed deeper into the town, but fighting continued in the area.\n\nTURKEY SEEKS \u201cSAFE ZONE\u201d\n\nIn the latest international censure of Turkey\u2019s onslaught, Arab League Secretary General Ahmed Aboul Gheit called it an \u201cinvasion of an Arab state\u2019s land and an aggression on its sovereignty\u201d.\n\nThe offensive \u201cwill exacerbate humanitarian crises, increase the suffering of the Syrian people and strengthen the ability of terrorists to reorganise their remnants,\u201d said Foreign Minister Mohamed Ali Alhakim of Iraq, current president of the League.\n\nGermany halted arms exports to Turkey. \u201cAgainst the backdrop of the Turkish military offensive in northeastern Syria, the Federal Government will not issue any new permits for all military equipment that could be used by Turkey in Syria,\u201d Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told Bild Am Sonntag.\n\nA senior French official said that next week\u2019s European Union summit would discuss possible sanctions against Turkey.\n\nErdogan has dismissed mounting international condemnation of the operation and said on Friday evening that Turkey \u201cwill not stop it, no matter what anyone says\u201d.\n\nThe Turkish-backed National Army said earlier they had cut a road linking Ras al Ain and Tel Abyad, the two main targets of Ankara\u2019s offensive, and had captured 18 villages since the operation began.\n\nU.S. TROOPS UNDER FIRE\n\nOn Friday, the Pentagon said U.S. troops came under artillery fire from Turkish emplacements though none of its soldiers were wounded near the Syrian border town of Kobani, 60 km (37 miles) west of the main area of conflict.\n\nTurkey said it was responding to YPG fire from a nearby area and that its forces took all precautions to prevent any harm to the U.S. base during that time.\n\nSeventy-four Kurdish-led fighters, 49 Turkey-backed Syrian rebels and 30 civilians have been killed in the fighting, according to Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor.\n\nIn Turkey, 18 civilians have been killed in cross-border bombardment, Turkish media and officials say, including eight people in a mortar and rocket attack on the border town of Nusaybin, the local governor\u2019s office said.\n\nTurkey said 415 YPG militants had been \u201cneutralised\u201d since the operation began, a term that commonly means killed.\n\nFEARS OF ISLAMIC STATE REVIVAL\n\nOvernight a car bomb exploded outside the wall of the prison in Hasaka in northeast Syria, causing serious damage but no casualties, a statement from security forces in the region said. It did not say if any Islamic State prisoners there had escaped.\n\nThe SDF\u2019s Qamishlo said the attack was carried out by IS sleeper cells.\n\nThe SDF holds most of the northern Syrian territory that once made up Islamic State\u2019s \u201ccaliphate\u201d in the country, and has been keeping thousands of fighters from the jihadist group in jail and tens of thousands of their family members in camps.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nThe SDF says the Turkish assault could allow the jihadist group to re-emerge. In its first big attack since the assault began, IS claimed responsibility for a deadly car bomb in Qamishli, the largest city in the Kurdish-held area.\n\nFive IS militants fled a jail there, and foreign women from the group being held in a camp torched tents and attacked guards with sticks and stones, the SDF said.", "description": "Turkish-backed Syrian rebels advanced into Ras al Ain in northeast Syria on Saturday but it was unclear how far, with Turkey saying the town centre had been taken and Kurdish-led forces denying this and saying they were counter-attacking.", "authors": ["Orhan Coskun", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191012&t=2&i=1439978664&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9B07T", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
