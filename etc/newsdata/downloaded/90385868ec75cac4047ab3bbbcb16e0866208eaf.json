The Isa also accepts transfers.\n\nThis is Money last week revealed how the top of both the easy-access savings tables and the cash Isa tables are dominated by accounts with catches, be they bonus rates or limits on how often you can access your money.\n\nIn fact, the three previously highest-paying easy access Isas all come with withdrawal restrictions.\n\nAs well as Coventry's account which comes with a couple of catches, Virgin Money's offer, paying 1.45 per cent, allows you only a pair of withdrawals a year.\n\nMeanwhile, Yorkshire Building Society, which was in bronze medal position before Leeds launched its Isa with a rate of 1.4 per cent, allows you as many withdrawals as you want on one day of the year.\n\nLeeds's previous highest-paying Isa in the easy access tables also came with a withdrawal restriction.\n\nIts double-access Isa pays 1.30 per cent and requires a minimum balance of \u00a35,000. If you make more than two withdrawals in a calendar year, you lose 30 days' interest.\n\nThe move from Leeds also means that the highest paying easy-access cash Isa without withdrawal limits now pays a higher rate than its equivalent easy-access savings account, in good news for tax-free savers.\n\nLeeds's account pays 0.01 per cent more than Marcus Bank, which also comes with a 0.1 per cent bonus rate.\n\nAccording to Moneyfacts, over the last three years, the difference between the top easy-access Isa and easy-access savings account has been around 0.15 per cent, with the Isa market tending to lag the regular savings market.\n\nHowever, in both May and June this year the best variable rate easy access Isa did at least match the best easy access savings account.\n\nCoventry also offers 1.46 per cent to non tax-free savers, but again, this comes in the form of an account which allows only three withdrawals per year.\n\nThe Leeds 1.46 per cent easy-access Isa compares to a best buy one-year fix of 1.6 per cent from Al-Rayan Bank and top 1.8 per cent over two years from the same provider.\n\nIt is worth pointing out that the account might not be around for long - Leeds says it is 'limited issue' and the building society has previous to pull top deals days after launch.", "description": "There's a new name at the top of the easy access Isa tables, and it doesn't come with any catches.", "authors": ["George Nixon For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
