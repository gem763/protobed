Me? When I think of fall flavors, I think about maple syrup.\n\nIt is actually a bit odd when you consider that spring is the season when producers collect and cook down the sap from the maple trees. Still, I\u2019m going to stick with my convictions, because maple syrup to me evokes New England and flannel and colorful foliage, all of which are the essence of fall.\n\nAnd no, it\u2019s not just sweet. \u201cMaple syrup is a lot more complex than sugar,\u201d says Laura Sorkin, who owns Vermont-based Runamok Maple with her husband, Eric. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more nuance than what you would get with granulated sugar.\u201d The flavor can vary depending on the time of year, but Sorkin says toffee, caramel, honey and apple are among the notes she can pick out. There\u2019s also a balance of sweetness and acidity.\n\nWe\u2019ve all poured maple syrup over our pancakes and waffles. Maybe even a little too much \u2014 that stuff is $$$! Here\u2019s what you need to know about how to better understand, appreciate and use that liquid gold. (Sorry, Mimi.)\n\n[What do I hate about maple syrup? Basically everything.]\n\nThe grades. In 2015, the U.S. Department of Agriculture updated its maple grades to come into line with standards already adopted by several states and Canada. One of the goals with the new grades was to give consumers better descriptors of flavor and color, as well as allow some of the very dark syrup previously classified as B grade to be folded into the A grade, providing easier access for home cooks. Sorkin says it\u2019s worth keeping in mind that the strength of flavor does not always occur in a smooth progression along with color, as you can get a lighter-colored syrup with an intense taste and a darker that\u2019s milder.\n\nStill, here is the rundown of how the government describes the grades aimed at individual buyers (there is a processing grade that can be used by manufacturers making other products), ordered from least to most intense, as well as early to late season:\n\nGrade A, golden color/delicate flavor: \u201cMild maple taste,\u201d according to the USDA. You might know this from its previous grade, Fancy. The Vermont Maple Sugar Makers\u2019 Association suggests serving this grade with the expected breakfast fare or rich dairy, such as ice cream or yogurt.\n\nGrade A, amber color/rich flavor: \u201cA full-bodied maple taste of medium intensity,\u201d the USDA says. If you choose only one grade, Sorkin says, it should be this one. It\u2019s great on waffles and pancakes, but the Vermont association also recommends it for salad dressings, cocktails and barbecue sauce.\n\nGrade A, dark color/robust flavor: The USDA is less helpful on the last two grades, explaining that this grade has a stronger taste than the lighter colors. You don\u2019t say. Anyway, our friends from Vermont like to take advantage of its hearty flavor by pouring it over baked fruit and vegetables and using it as a glaze for meat and vegetables. It can also shine in baking.\n\nGrade A, very dark/strong flavor: You guessed it \u2014 \u201ca maple taste that is stronger than robust.\u201d Okay then! What say you, Vermont? \u201cWhen you need a strong maple flavor in a bread or cookie, ice cream, or barbecue sauce, this is the grade of choice.\u201d\n\nStorage. Keep unopened maple syrup in a cool, dry spot, out of direct light. The Vermont Maple Sugar Makers\u2019 Association recommends storing opened maple syrup in the refrigerator. Or to keep it in very good shape, you can freeze it, going through as many freezing and thawing cycles as you want, the group says, as long as you let it thaw completely and stir in any condensation that forms on the top of the syrup.\n\nSubstituting. \u201cMaple syrup is about as sweet as sugar, so you can replace it using an equal amount of syrup,\u201d according to the Vermont-based experts at King Arthur Flour. \u201cDecrease the liquid by 3 to 4 tablespoons per 1 cup substitution.\u201d If you\u2019re adding maple syrup to a recipe that doesn\u2019t call for liquid, you need to increase the flour by 1 tablespoon for every \u00bc cup maple syrup used. KAF emphasizes using room temperature maple syrup, because if it\u2019s cold, it can cause other ingredients, including butter, to clump. If you use a darker grade, expect a \u201cdelightfully caramelly\u201d flavor.\n\nFlavoring your own. Runamok\u2019s eclectic infused syrups include such flavors as hibiscus, makrut lime-leaf, smoked chile pepper and ginger. (Here\u2019s a link to a coffee syrup in our archives.) If you\u2019re interested in creating your own infusions, especially with whole spices, Sorkin suggests gently heating the syrup and letting the ingredients steep for a few hours. Taste every so often to see whether you\u2019ve achieved the right level of flavor. Keep in mind that it\u2019s better to be conservative than add too much or steep too long.\n\nUses. \u201cI would just love it if people would start thinking beyond pancakes,\u201d Sorkin says. She notes that honey has really come into its own as an ingredient to be appreciated and used in a variety of ways and hopes the time will come soon for maple syrup. Maple syrup on a cheese board? Go for it! In Vermont, people have been putting maple syrup in their coffee for a long time, and Sorkin says it works in tea, too, particularly a black variety (try it in chai). She is, as you would expect, a proponent of maple syrup in cocktails.\n\n[How to build the ultimate cheese board]\n\nSorkin says maple syrup can be lost in flour-heavy baked goods, so she prefers to save it for situations when it can really shine, such as in frostings (buttercream or cream cheese), glazes and a simple syrup applied to a cake. It can be used in a wide variety of savory applications, too, adding just the right balance when played against other flavors. Sorkin, who trained at the French Culinary Institute in New York (now the International Culinary Center), likes to add a drizzle on top of a sweet potato and tahini dip. Her other recipes include maple vinaigrettes, roasted cabbage and crispy tofu. Always worth considering: Maple butter.\n\nNeed some more ideas?
