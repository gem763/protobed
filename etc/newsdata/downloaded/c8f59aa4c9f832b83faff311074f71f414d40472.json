Done? Congratulations, you were absolutely correct \u2014 he does spend his time painting miniature historical figurines.\n\nThe former Labor leader and now shadow minister for government services and the National Disability Insurance Scheme went on Sky News to talk about Labor\u2019s climate change policy and the disability royal commission, intriguingly deciding to frame himself in front of some sort of diorama.\n\nComputer, zoom and enhance.\n\nAfter supposedly receiving a lot of inquiries (surely not) about the diorama, Shorten took to Twitter to explain why there are toy soldiers storming a gingerbread house in his office.\n\nLots of inquiries about my diorama in background of Sky interview. I\u2019m a history hound. It\u2019s a lifelong passion. This one\u2019s the 1812 Retreat From Moscow. pic.twitter.com/SQT6q0QLPh \u2014 Bill Shorten (@billshortenmp) September 16, 2019\n\nShorten\u2019s office would not answer my questions about the scale of miniatures that he works with (possibly because this is an insane question to ask) but, to my eye, that looks to be about 1:35, and I am having just a wonderful time imagining him sitting down and meticulously dusting his model trees with snow.\n\nEven better than that, is imagining Shorten lovingly carrying that surely quite fragile diorama into the office, beaming with pride.\n\nAlthough honestly the least he could do is take the bases off the minis. It\u2019s ruining my immersion.", "description": "Former Labor leader Bill Shorten has dramatically revealed himself to be a tremendously huge nerd, for no good reason that I can see.", "authors": ["Ben Mcleay"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-16-at-4.11.07-pm-3.png", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
