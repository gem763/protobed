The others were the fact that the island is steeped in history, and the investment in the area - particularly the free-trade initiative at the port - offers the hope of a bright future.\n\nThe mayor stressed that, aside from jobs created by tourism, there will be other advantages for people on the Island, with particular emphasis on Hainan's youth.\n\nA direct flight between London and Sanya is already up and running bringing Hainan island within easy reach of Europe.\n\nFlights are also being planned from Germany. Visitors from 59 countries can now get 30-days of visa-free travel too.", "description": "Euronews travelled to Nice to take part in the 4th edition of the Franco-Chinese Cultural forum.
