Enemies with big grins and even bigger reasons to bet on themselves. That\u2019s what happens when you beat the home team, 12-3, in Game 2 of the World Series. That\u2019s what happens when you carry a 2-0 lead onto a plane back to Washington. That\u2019s what happens when you stage a six-run seventh inning that starts against their star pitcher, Justin Verlander, and ends with you capitalizing on every last mistake.\n\nAD\n\nThat\u2019s what the Nationals did at Minute Maid Park. They dismembered the Astros, and in swift fashion, after Stephen Strasburg kept them floating in a tight game. He gave up two runs in six innings of hand-dirtying work. He was rewarded once the bats exploded in the seventh. The rally began when Kurt Suzuki rocketed a Verlander fastball out to left. It only finished when the Nationals had marched into Houston and left little doubt.\n\nAD\n\nFifty-five teams have taken a 2-0 advantage in the World Series. Forty-four have won it all.\n\nVerlander was first tasked with slowing a team that\u2019s now won eight games in a row, and 18 of its last 20 going back to Sept. 23. But he couldn\u2019t, at least at the start and finish, beginning when Anthony Rendon smacked a two-run double in the first. The fans went quiet, and their orange flags didn\u2019t wave, yet it didn\u2019t take long for the building to fill with noise. Washington\u2019s lead lasted until Alex Bregman hit a towering, two-run shot off Strasburg in the bottom of the inning.\n\nAD\n\nHe rocked a middle-in change-up, knotting the score, but Strasburg was quick to find a rhythm. Verlander was, too. Strasburg eventually fought through six innings on 114 pitches. He stranded two runners before he exited, giving the Nationals a chance, and gutting a spurt of Verlander\u2019s dominance with more of his own. Strasburg capped the outing by getting Kyle Tucker to wave at a full-count curveball. He jogged off the field once he did, leaving nothing behind, and locked hands with first base coach Tim Bogar in a swinging high-five.\n\nAD\n\nStrasburg typically ducks into the outings once he exits. He finds a quiet space. He waits for the pitching coach to tell him he\u2019s done. But now Strasburg knew the job was finished. So he walked through a line of teammates, repeated two words \u2014 \u201cCome on! Come on!\u201d \u2014 then left them to celebrate when Suzuki led off the next half with a boom.\n\nThe Nationals put together intricate scouting reports for their hitters to review each series. It\u2019s a joint job for the analytics and video staff. But one member of the organization once joked that Suzuki\u2019s packet is always thinner than the rest. He just looks for the first fastball he sees and tries to pull it as hard as he can. And that\u2019s what he did against Verlander in the seventh, smashing high heat, driving it off the Lexus sign behind the left-field seats and down into the stands.\n\nAD\n\nVerlander was hooked for reliever Ryan Pressly after he walked Victor Robles. There were still no outs in the inning. The floodgates opened when Turner walked and, with two outs, the Astros issued their first intentional pass of the entire season. It put Juan Soto on first to load the bases. Houston paid for it once Bregman bobbled a Howie Kendrick grounder, allowing a run and the rally to continue, before Asdr\u00fabal Cabrera drove in two with a single. Then Bregman erred again by throwing a ball high and wide of first to allow two more Nationals to score. Big pockets of the crowd headed for the exits. And the ballpark went silent once again.\n\nAD\n\nWhen Manager Dave Martinez reflects on this game, and he\u2019ll have one night and a long flight to do so, it will be hard to pick a hero. There was Rendon lifting that two-run double in the first. There was Strasburg keeping the Astros in check for five innings. There was Suzuki\u2019s home run, there was Cabrera pitching it, and there were all the tiny contributions that, when glued together, formed a winning whole. The challenge is that Martinez will have to decide.\n\nBefore this season, his second on the job, an idea popped into Martinez\u2019s head. The manager wanted to save a game ball from every one of Washington\u2019s wins. He wanted to put them on a wall outside his office at Nationals Park, set in chronological order, stacked on shelves that grew as the season moved along. Each is signed by the player who led the Nationals to victory. When Martinez can\u2019t pick one, when the effort feels bigger, he has two players scratch their signatures onto the worn leather. Some even have three names. Then Martinez finishes the process by writing the date on a plastic case and putting it in place for good.\n\nAD\n\nWhen the Nationals left for Houston on Monday, there were 101 game balls stretching from March 31 to Oct. 15. They formed a mural of team success. Players often stand in the hallway to look, remembering the most random days of an eight-month sprint, counting how many they\u2019ve accounted for. Now Martinez will leave here with a fresh pair to shelve: There is Soto\u2019s ball after he collected three hits and three RBI in Game 1. There will be another to get signed by someone, or a few someones, from Wednesday.\n\nAD\n\nAnd the Nationals need just two more.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD\n\nInning-by-inning analysis\n\nby Sam Fortier\n\nNinth inning (Nationals 12, Astros 3)\n\nMichael A. Taylor was sent down in June because he couldn\u2019t make contact. His struck out rate nosed north of 42 percent. He returned for September, played a meaningful role when Victor Robles got hurt in the NLDS, but this was still the most surprising moment of his season. Taylor went deep to left field for a home run in Game 2 of the World Series.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Astros got one back. But then the game ended.\n\nEighth inning (Nationals 11, Astros 2)\n\nAdam Eaton, again not bunting, roped a two-run home run into the right-field seats at the rapidly emptying Minute Maid Park.\n\nThis is absolutely, without a doubt our new favorite home run celebration. pic.twitter.com/hao2TC0T4K \u2014 Cut4 (@Cut4) October 24, 2019\n\nAsdr\u00fabal Cabrera singled into right-center field and Juan Soto trotted in to plate the Nationals\u2019 11th run of the night.\n\nWe just scored again. \u2014 Washington Nationals (@Nationals) October 24, 2019\n\nThe Nationals adopted the strategy of mercy-ruling high school teams and went to their reserves in eighth inning. They brought to the mound Tanner Rainey, who nearly imploded in Game 1, and put Michael A. Taylor in center field for Victor Robles. Rainey worked through an efficient inning, getting Alex Bregman and Yuli Gurriel to fly out to center. He struck out Yordan Alvarez and, just like that, the Nationals had three outs left.\n\nSeventh inning (Nationals 8, Astros 2)\n\nKurt Suzuki was the first batter this season Justin Verlander faced without catcher Robinson Chirinos behind the plate. Suzuki homered to left and clanged a metal sign above the bleachers. The blast gave the Nationals a 3-2 lead and put an interesting question to Manager Dave Martinez: Who should pitch the seventh inning?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJustin Verlander\u2019s second batter faced without Chirinos this season wasn\u2019t retired either. Victor Robles battled a seven-pitch walk out of the ace and the Astros went to the bullpen for right-hander Ryan Pressly.\n\nPressly walked the leadoff hitter, Trea Turner, and Adam Eaton sacrifice bunted them over. The Astros, who had not issued an intentional walk all season, finally did against Juan Soto \u2014 adopting the same move the Los Angeles Dodgers did in the 10th inning of Game 5 of the NLDS. Howie Kendrick delivered again. He went shorter this time, a grounder to third baseman Alex Bregman, but it plated a run and boosted the Nationals lead.\n\nPlease don\u2019t read anything from earlier this game about Asdr\u00fabal Cabrera. The Nationals utility infielder snapped out of a 1-for-7 slump start to the World Series and slapped a single up the middle off Pressly to drive in two more runs. The Nationals\u2019 lead expanded to 6-2 and Minute Maid Park got as quiet as it\u2019d been in the two games here.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRyan Zimmerman dribbled another ball short down the third-base line and Alex Bregman threw it away. Howie Kendrick and Asdr\u00fabal Cabrera scampered home.\n\nThis is the worst inning the Astros have played all year and it's not close.\n\n\n\nIt's 7-2, Nats \u2014 Chandler Rome (@Chandler_Rome) October 24, 2019\n\nThe Nationals\u2019 lead ballooned again in the most preposterous inning of the Astros\u2019 season.\n\nWhen it was finally, mercifully over for the home crowd, Minute Maid Park gave a sarcastic cheer.\n\nThe seventh inning in Game 2 of the World Series in the year of our lord 2019 belonged to Fernando Rodney. The 42-year-old, the oldest player in baseball, the pitcher who first met Astros Manager A.J. Hinch as his catcher in Detroit, was on. The Fernando Rodney Experience throughout this season has often meant Rodney enters in a high-leverage spot, quickly gets into trouble and then suddenly Houdinis out of it in a way which defies proper explanation.\n\nRodney started as though he\u2019d follow that rubric. He walked the leadoff hitter, Josh Reddick, but got George Springer to bounce into a fielder\u2019s choice. He popped up Jose Altuve. He got Michael Brantley to ground out. He\u2019d made it.\n\nSixth inning (Nationals 2, Astros 2)\n\nAsdr\u00fabal Cabrera has reached a concerning-level cold start to the World Series. The former everyday second baseman lost his starting job in the NLCS, when Ryan Zimmerman\u2019s resurgence pushed Howie Kendrick to second, and he hadn\u2019t played for 13 days until he started in Game 1. Game 2 has provided much of the same, though, and he\u2019s looked out of rhythm so far. He\u2019s now 0 for 7 with five strikeouts. Dave Martinez likes the versatility of the switch-hitter, as well as the defense, but the Nationals need him to start putting better at-bats together quickly.\n\nAD\n\nStephen Strasburg hit the stickiest spot either starter had faced since the first inning. Yuli Gurriel smoked a liner down the left for a one-out double and Strasburg found himself in a jam. He missed with his first pitch to designated hitter Yordan Alvarez and the Nationals issued an intentional walk.\n\nThe nightlong buildup of frustration with home-plate umpire Doug Eddings boiled over too because, after Strasburg popped up Carlos Correa for the second out, Strasburg screamed something at Eddings. The Astros pinch-hit Kyle Tucker, a left-hander, for catcher Robinson Chirinos, who had struck out twice earlier flailing through Strasburg\u2019s change-up. It would mean Astros starter Justin Verlander would be throwing to a catcher other than Chirinos for the first time this season, but the Astros thought the gamble worth it. They had a chance to break through against Strasburg.\n\nThey didn\u2019t. Eddings gave Strasburg what he wanted and, on a 3-2 curveball, rung up Tucker. Strasburg jogged off the mound, his night likely done. The question now is who the Nationals will lean on in the seventh.\n\nFifth inning (Nationals 2, Astros 2)\n\nJustin Verlander hasn\u2019t gotten a ton of double plays this year \u2014 nine in 37 starts \u2014 but he picked a good time for his 10th one. The Astros\u2019 right-hander got Adam Eaton to ground right at shortstop Carlos Correa, who stepped on second and fired to first. He walked Anthony Rendon but escaped with a groundball to first. Verlander is through five on 82 pitches.\n\nThe most pressing question for the Nationals now is how long can Stephen Strasburg go. He finished the fifth at 86 pitches and could theoretically get through at least the sixth. The Nationals would prefer he navigate the seventh as well because it would mean they could rely solely on their two trustworthy relievers, Daniel Hudson and Sean Doolittle. Strasburg will face the heart of the order, starting with cleanup hitter Alex Bregman, in the sixth.\n\nFourth inning (Nationals 2, Astros 2)\n\nThe only notable moment from Justin Verlander\u2019s otherwise ho-hum fourth was a funny play with one out. Ryan Zimmerman dribbled a ball to the right of the mound and Verlander gave chase. He dove, grabbed the ball and then, in trying to throw to first, spiked the ball off his shin.\n\nPoor JV couldn't get out of his own way. pic.twitter.com/weOm0aEHY1 \u2014 Cut4 (@Cut4) October 24, 2019\n\nwhen you send the perfect tweet\n\n\n\nand find a typo\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcf7: AP Photo/Matt Slocum, Mike Ehrmann/Getty pic.twitter.com/lOUilT2ViU \u2014 Post Sports (@PostSports) October 24, 2019\n\nJustin Verlander's approach to that ball is a perfect embodiment of my athletic career: Lot of effort, lot of pain and awkwardness. \u2014 Chelsea Janes (@chelsea_janes) October 24, 2019\n\nStephen Strasburg is officially not tipping his change-up. Or, he\u2019s still tipping it and the Astros can\u2019t hit. Either way, he struck out Astros catcher Robinson Chirinos with it for the second time \u2014 his third change-up strikeout overall since the second inning. Strasburg has cruised since that rocky first inning, with the exception of Trea Turner\u2019s error, and finished the fourth at 72 pitches. He should be able to get the Nationals through the crucial sixth inning.\n\nThird inning (Nationals 2, Astros 2)\n\nJuan Soto ripped a double down the right-field line, but the Nationals couldn\u2019t do much with it. Howie Kendrick\u2019s World Series cold start stretched to 0-for-6 as he flew out to right. Stephen Strasburg marched back to the mound no doubt by now informed that he was tipping pitches.\n\nStrasburg should have gotten out of the inning with 51 pitches. He\u2019d struck out Josh Reddick and gotten George Springer to pop out. Then Jose Altuve sent a groundball to short and Trea Turner bobbled it for the Nationals\u2019 first error this postseason from the left side of their infield. It could have ended worse for the Nationals \u2014 Michael Brantley singled Altuve to third \u2014 but then Strasburg got Alex Bregman to ground out on a fastball. He departed with 58 pitches, a modest increase but still significant.\n\nSecond inning (Nationals 2, Astros 2)\n\nJustin Verlander settled in during the second in hopes of salvaging what was billed as the battle of the aces. He struck out Ryan Zimmerman and Victor Robles, and he got Trea Turner to fly out to right to work around a one-out single by Kurt Suzuki. Verlander is at 36 pitches through two innings.\n\nStephen Strasburg sailed through his second inning, but the conversation of the frame wasn\u2019t about his two strikeouts or return to form. It was about a video which surfaced after the first inning which appeared to show Astros third baseman Alex Bregman explaining to his teammates after he homered how Strasburg was tipping his pitches. The Astros excel at picking up on cues \u2014 that\u2019s how they got to Tampa Bay Rays starter Charlie Morton in the ALDS \u2014 and it appears they found another. But, if they did, it looked like Strasburg might have countered.\n\nStrasburg has tipped his pitches in the past. The Arizona Diamondbacks shelled him twice this season \u2014 15 runs in a combined 9 \u2154 innings \u2014 and he attributed it to pitch-tipping, which he later corrected.\n\nMUST SEE-\n\nWHAT IS GOING ON IN THE #ASTROS DUGOUT??\n\nSecrets after Bregman HR.\n\nStrasburg tipping pitches? pic.twitter.com/y1HpXnQBHJ \u2014 Carol Maloney (@carolmaloney4) October 24, 2019\n\nFirst inning (Nationals 2, Astros 2)\n\nThe Nationals stunned Minute Maid Park by coming out firing in Game 2. Justin Verlander issued a four-pitch walk to Trea Turner and Adam Eaton, not bunting, singled the other way. Anthony Rendon doubled off the wall in left and suddenly the Nationals had seized a 2-0 lead before they recorded an out. Verlander then settled in to stop the bleeding.\n\nAnthony Rendon is the first batter in 2019 to get a hit off of an 0-2 changeup from Justin Verlander.\n\n\n\nOpponents were previously 0-for-12 with 7 Ks.#OnePursuit | #TakeItBack \u2014 Inside Edge (@InsideEdgeScout) October 24, 2019\n\nJose Altuve made one of the most perplexing decisions of the World Series so far in the first when he followed a one-out double by trying to steal third base. He might have thought he could beat third baseman Anthony Rendon, in the shift, to the bag. He might have missed a sign or not considered there was a left-handed hitter at the plate. He might have been pressing because of the Game 1 loss.\n\nWhatever it was, it got him thrown out by Kurt Suzuki, the catcher who couldn\u2019t throw anyone out this season. It looked bad when Michael Brantley later singled. It looked worse when Alex Bregman rocketed a home run to left field to tie the game at 2-2. The Nationals gave up a home run in the first, but without Altuve, it could have been much worse.\n\nAll of Alex Bregman's eight postseason home runs have come off All-Stars:\n\n\n\nClayton Kershaw\n\nChris Sale (2)\n\nCorey Kluber\n\nKenley Jansen\n\nTrevor Bauer\n\nBlake Snell\n\nStephen Strasburg \u2014 Chandler Rome (@Chandler_Rome) October 24, 2019\n\nPregame\n\nSimone Biles threw out the first pitch at Minute Maid Park.
