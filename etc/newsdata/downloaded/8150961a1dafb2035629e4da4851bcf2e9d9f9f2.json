The global cannabis company is building for a massive global opportunity, but still burning cash at a rapid rate. The market recently pushed the stock below $4 hoping for the industry to rationalize supply and spending around current revenues, but the October corporate update from Aurora Cannabis suggests the company remains tone deaf to the current market realities.\n\nMajor Facility Construction\n\nAurora Cannabis has been on a major facility construction path over the last few years. The company updated the market on the construction progress, but Aurora Cannabis still appears focused on global market leadership over prudently managing investors\u2019 capital.\n\nThe cannabis company spent C$414 million on capital spending in the last fiscal year alone causing analysts like Chris Carey from Bank of America to question whether the company will have liquidity issues in 2020. The latest update highlights how the majority of facility spending has passed, but the news suggests a ramp in operating expenses on the horizon.\n\nBoth the Aurora Sky and the Nordic Sky cultivation facilities are nearing completion adding a total of 2.6 million square feet of production space. Aurora Cannabis already had quarterly production targeted for 37,500 kg in the September quarter and these two massive facilities will increase quarterly production goals to nearly 175,000 kg by mid-2020.\n\nOther facilities like the Anandia Laboratories and Canadian Cannabis Innovation Center are opening during the current quarter. The new facilities add over 45,000 square feet of cultivation, lab and office space that will add substantially to operating costs without contributing to near-term revenues.\n\nOn top of this, the company is testing outdoor cultivation at multiple sites in Canada. In addition, the company is also developing the Aurora Polaris park for industrial-scale production of edibles and vape products with those costs ramping up in October for the market opening up in mid-December.\n\nMismatch With Financials\n\nWhile the company is busy focusing the market on either the organic, medical or global cannabis markets via sophisticated facilities and testing operations, Aurora Cannabis dumped C$20 million in revenues on the wholesale bulk market last quarter. The building of all these facilities wasn\u2019t undertaken to sell product on the cheap in the wholesale market.\n\nThe mismatch with the actual sales figures and relatively weak margins in the upper 50% range is why the stock now trades under $5. The corporate update still has the company focusing on volumes including the planting of 9,000 acres of hemp in Eastern Europe versus generating positive cash flows and reigning in growth to better match global growth opportunities with escalating costs.\n\nStreet Sentiment\n\nUnsurprisingly, we can see that best-performing investors have Very Negative sentiment on Aurora stock right now according to TipRanks Smart Portfolio.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Analysts identified the biggest risk to the Aurora Cannabis (ACB) story as the company aggressively spending the business towards a liquidity problem.
