The change, announced this week, is intended to \u201cprotect\u201d teenagers and their developing brains, according to the junior health minister, Lionel Carmant.\n\nThe new law, which comes into effect on 1 January, also prohibits the consumption of cannabis on public roads, in bus shelters, under big-top tents and in playgrounds. These changes take effect this week.\n\nNo other province in Canada has a legal cannabis consumption age over 19.\n\nWhen campaigning for the seat of Quebec premier last year, the Coalition Avenir Qu\u00e9bec party\u2019s leader, Fran\u00e7ois Legault, promised to increase the age limit for cannabis. A government spokesperson said 65% of Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois agreed with the new age limit.\n\nQuebec\u2019s stringent cannabis laws are unique in the country. The province also prohibits people from growing their own at home, it has one of the lowest allowances for home storage of processed cannabis and it also prohibits the sale of edibles, which only became legal in Canada this month.\n\nWeed woes: Canada struggles to meet huge demand for legal cannabis Read more\n\nThe government is also in the process of appealing against a ruling in a legal challenge to its no-home-growing law. In September, a Quebec court judge said the law was invalid because it trespassed on federal rights given to Canadians. Quebec has vowed to fight that ruling.\n\nDespite these laws, legal cannabis has been extremely popular in the province \u2013 and lucrative for the government. In its first five months of operation, the government cannabis store network (SQDC) sold $71m worth \u2013 9.9 tonnes \u2013 of the stuff to Quebec consumers.\n\nOpponents to Quebec\u2019s new age limit say that the law is unfair and that it will encourage the sale of grey- and black-market cannabis.\n\nGabriel Nadeau-Dubois, a spokesman for official Opposition party Qu\u00e9bec Solidaire, said that it creates \u201ctwo classes of adults\u201d.\n\nThe legal age to vote, buy cigarettes and drink in Quebec is 18.", "description": "New law, which goes into effect 1 January, is intended to \u2018protect\u2019 teens and their developing brains, said junior health minister", "authors": ["Tracey Lindeman"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/303d45996dc8ac25b2ab45b49a403b5785d09d96/0_0_4037_2422/master/4037.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2e47d02d51d90c0b7993dda89d67767a", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
