You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe idea was praised by entrepreneur Rahat Ahmed, who noticed the tool for the first time when booking flights with the airline this week.\n\nHe tweeted: \u201cThank you, @JAL_Official_jp for warning me about where babies plan to scream and yell during a 13 hour trip. This really ought to be mandatory across the board.\u201d\n\nHe added that, on a recent trip from New York to Doha with Qatar Airways, he had \u201cthree screaming babies next to me\u201d.\n\nTwitter users were mixed in their response. Some were all for the idea, with one commenter writing: \u201cThis would be awesome, especially on long haul flights!\u201d\n\nHowever, others, particularly those who were parents themselves, argued for more patience from other passengers.\n\n\u201cThey are babies as we all once were,\u201d reads one response. \u201cWe need to learn tolerance or will soon start needing a map of seat locations for mouth breathers, droolers, farters, drunks, and perhaps a lot more things in life. What ever happened to life\u2019s surprises?\u201d\n\nThe airline has warned that the tool is not failsafe.\n\nIf tickets aren\u2019t booked directly with the airline but through a third party, the child icon is unlikely to be displayed.\n\nThe icon also won\u2019t appear if there\u2019s a last minute change of aircraft.", "description": "An airline has launched a tool showing passengers where babies will be situated on flights when they come to select their seats.
