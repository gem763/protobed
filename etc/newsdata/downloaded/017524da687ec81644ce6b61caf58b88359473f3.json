That was below economists\u2019 forecast of 1.9% and represents a big slowdown from July\u2019s inflation figure of 2.1%.\n\nThe lower-than-forecast price rises come at a time when UK workers are enjoying their fastest pay rises in more than a decade, meaning more money in their pockets.\n\nThe ONS said the falling inflation rate was down to cheaper toys, games, clothing, and sea fares. Air fares rose in the month, but not enough to counter the falling prices elsewhere.\n\n\u201cThe inflation rate has fallen noticeably into August, to its lowest rate since late 2016,\u201d Mike Hardie, head of inflation at the ONS, said. \u201cThis was driven mainly by a decrease in computer game prices, plus clothing prices rising by less than last year after the end of the summer sales.\n\n\u201cAnnual growth in house prices slowed to its lowest rate since September 2012, with four of the nine English regions now seeing prices falling over the year.\u201d\n\nWage growth is now far outpacing rising prices. The latest wage growth data showed pay including bonuses increase by 4% in July, or 3.8% excluding bonuses.\n\nThe greater-than-expected slowdown comes despite the collapse in the value of the pound in August, which should make imports more expensive. Sterling dropped from $1.24 to below $1.21 when Boris Johnson became prime minister.\n\nPound falls as rate hike looks unlikely\n\nThe inflation slowdown is also good news for the Bank of England, which targets price rises of 2%.\n\nThe central bank will deliver its latest interest rate decision on Thursday. The pound fell against both the euro and the dollar after the ONS data, as traders bet that the weak inflation rate makes the Bank of England unlikely to raise interest rates.\n\n\u201cThis was the last important piece of information for BOE ahead of their monetary policy decision,\u201d Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at ThinkMarkets, said. \u201cWe expect the bank to be more focused on Brexit than anything else, and it is highly likely that Mark Carney\u2019s term at the bank may be extended even further because of the strong possibility of a general election.\u201d\n\nThe pound was down 0.2% against the euro at \u20ac1.1262 (GBPEUR=X) and down 0.4% against the dollar to $1.2441 (GBPUSD=X) shortly after the ONS announcement.", "description": "Inflation slowed to 1.7% in August, new figures show, below forecasts.
