(Kin Cheung/AP)\n\nProtesters in Hong Kong marched through shopping malls on Sunday targeting businesses with connections to China \u2014 or those perceived to be pro-Beijing \u2014 as demonstrations in the city stretched into their sixteenth weekend.\n\nThe new tactic from demonstrators showed a simmering anger toward the city\u2019s business elites, a relatively small group of tycoons and cronies who have accumulated enormous wealth and political clout, often through cozy relationships with the mainland.\n\nWhile the contentious extradition bill that sparked the ongoing political crisis was withdrawn earlier this month, Sunday\u2019s demonstrations again illustrated that the deep unhappiness within the city goes far beyond a single piece of legislation and will not be easily \u2014 or quickly \u2014 resolved.\n\nHundreds of protesters gathered at New Town Plaza, a multistory shopping mall in the Sha Tin district. Protesters there targeted Chinese-linked businesses like Maxim\u2019s Jade Garden restaurant, flooding the automated reservation system with requests and taping together the receipts to create an ad hoc protest banner.\n\nMaxim\u2019s Caterers Limited, which operates the restaurant, is a major food and beverage conglomerate that runs numerous bakeries and restaurants across Hong Kong, including the Seattle-based coffee chain Starbucks. The company has recently become a target of protesters. Their anger stems from Annie Wu, the daughter of the company founder and a staunch supporter of Beijing, who spoke at the United Nations earlier this month in defense of the Hong Kong government. Her support of the government and police has made her a darling of Chinese-state media.\n\nTiffany, 25, a kindergarten teacher who took part in Sunday\u2019s demonstration, said Wu was \u201cbending all of the reasons why we come out to the streets. She only sees what the protesters destroy, but she doesn\u2019t see the reasons why.\u201d\n\nAnother protester, Peter, 31, a photographer, said Wu \u201cdoesn\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening in Hong Kong. She said it [the demonstrations] are destroying peaceful life in Hong Kong. Does she really know what\u2019s happening here?\u201d\n\nWu spoke at the UN along with Pansy Ho, a billionaire gambling heiress who said protesters had \u201chijacked the well-intended bill and used it to spread fear among Hong Kongers,\u201d prompting ridicule from demonstrators who said Ho, whose worth Forbes pegs at $4.3 billion, was grossly disconnected from the general population.\n\nAt V Walk, another shopping mall in the Sham Shui Po area of Kowloon, dozens of protesters marched past stores chanting \u201cliberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time.\u201d The group quickly laid siege to a Best Mart 360 outlet, a convenience store chain whose owner has deep ties to the southeastern Chinese province of Fujian, forcing the shop to shutter and sending protesters into a victorious roar before they quickly moved along.\n\n\u201cWe have to fight in different ways. We have used a lot of methods already, occupying shopping malls is a new one,\u201d said one female protester in her thirties who wore a black mask and said she was alerted to the demonstration after seeing posts on Instagram earlier in the day.\n\nBy Sunday evening, the originally peaceful protests again turned violent. Police fired tear gas, and protesters hurled bricks at officers in the streets surrounding New Town Plaza. Flaming piles of palm fronds and cardboard sent plumes of black smoke into the sky.\n\nPlans to disrupt transportation links to Hong Kong International Airport on Sunday, one of the world\u2019s busiest, had circulated on social media and messaging apps in recent days. The airport has been singled out at protesters before and they were successful in causing major flight delays and cancellations.\n\n[Hong Kong riot police, armed with pepper spray and batons, clash with protesters at airport]\n\nOn Sunday, however, police deployed dozens of riot police to the main train station servicing the airport as a precaution. Officers dressed in green fatigues, some carrying shotguns and tear gas launchers, stood in groups throughout the station.\n\nOfficials preemptively reduced rail and bus service to the airport in an attempt to stop large numbers of protesters from making it to the airport to carry out their \u201cstress test.\u201d While the original plans appeared to be scuttled, many protesters said they were amused, and counted it as a victory, that police deployed such a huge amount of resources only to have demonstrations pop up elsewhere.\n\nSunday\u2019s protests capped yet another weekend of unrest in the semiautonomous territory that has been in tumult for months started by a now withdrawn bill that would have allowed for extraditions to mainland China.\n\nCarrie Lam, Hong Kong\u2019s deeply unpopular chief executive, withdrew the bill earlier this month, but by then the scope of the protests had widened dramatically and are now focused more broadly on Beijing\u2019s tightening hold on Hong Kong, as well as the use of force by police. Nearly 1,500 people \u2014 as young as 12 and as old as 83 \u2014 have been arrested since June, according to police.\n\n[\u2018I couldn\u2019t breathe\u2019: Hong Kong protesters allege beatings and torture by city\u2019s police]\n\nOn Saturday, police and protesters again clashed with pockets of violence popping up in numerous locations starting from the evening and lasting through the night. Police said they did not have a number of arrests from Saturday\u2019s demonstrations, however at least one 13-year-old girl was arrested in connection with the burning of the Chinese national flag. Sunday evening police said she had been granted bail.\n\nProtesters frequently target the flag and other Chinese symbols. Recently, the term \u201cChinazi\u201d has been popularized by protesters to deride China. Stickers with the term, some with swastikas, were plastered around New Town Plaza on Sunday. Protesters again directed their frustrations at the flag with an impromptu conga line of demonstrators gleefully dancing on a flag in the middle of the mall.\n\nPolice also condemned protesters from Saturday for attacking an officer and attempting to \u201csnatch\u201d his revolver. This was an apparent reference to a scene captured by public broadcaster Radio Television Hong Kong, which showed a group of around six protesters attempting to free another demonstrator who was caught by police.\n\nThe group beat the officer with rods and umbrellas, one protester grabbed the officer\u2019s baton and used it to repeatedly hit the downed officer. Another protester can be seen pulling at the officer\u2019s weapon but was unable to free it before being chased off by other officers.\n\nRead more:\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "The new tactic revealed a simmering anger toward a small group of tycoons and cronies who have accumulated enormous wealth and political clout, often through cozy relationships with the mainland.", "authors": ["Timothy Mclaughlin", "Casey Quackenbush", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/MAH_V_daJEd1ZfxNl7qoOzn0QCk=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BWG5GQG5D4I6TPUWNLNYDAQ6SA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
