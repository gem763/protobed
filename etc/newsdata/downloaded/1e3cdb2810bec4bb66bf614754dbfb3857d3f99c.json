(AP) - Ramarro Lamar was in Marine boot camp in the middle of a July heat wave in Quantico, Virginia, when he got an Instagram message from Nebraska cheerleader Sydney Long.\n\nShe was asking if he was interested in joining NU\u2019s cheer squad.\n\nLamar, a senior political science major, shrugged it off. He\u2019d never done anything close to cheerleading before, and the nearest thing he had any experience in was wrestling, a sport centered around throwing somebody to the ground, not holding them up.\n\nSo he turned his attention toward completing boot camp, thinking it was a joke.\n\n\u201cWe were in the middle of boot camp and everything, your mind isn\u2019t thinking about anything clearly,\u201d he told the Lincoln Journal Star . \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I just sent her a bunch of laughing emojis and gaffed it off.\u201d\n\nIt was a week before Lamar was able to use his phone again and see Long\u2019s response. She was serious. The Husker Cheer Squad was allowing stunts and tumbling to be a part of its routines for the first time since the mid-2000s.\n\nWith that, the door was open for male cheerleaders to return to the squad for the first time in more than a decade.\n\nLamar gave Long his contact information to pass along to coach Erynn Butzke and, sure enough, she reached out to him about trying out.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when I realized, \u2018Oh, man, this is legit,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nSo just two weeks after completing boot camp, Lamar tried out for Nebraska\u2019s cheer squad.\n\nLearning the ins and outs of a sport he\u2019d only seen from the stands was a new challenge, but something he was excited to embrace.\n\n\u201cIt was like drinking water through a fire hose,\u201d he said.\n\nWith practice, and the help of some former NU male cheerleaders, Lamar became one of the squad\u2019s six male members.\n\nRestoring stunts and tumbling for Nebraska\u2019s cheer squad was a long process for Butzke, a Scarlet Dance Team member from 2000-03 who returned to the program in 2011. Her hiring came at about the same time as Nebraska\u2019s switch to the Big Ten Conference, which she said was a major catalyst toward bringing stunts and tumbling back.\n\nThat process was muddled by several years of turnover and instability in the athletic department.\n\nBill Moos\u2019 arrival as AD in 2017 brought stability, Butzke said, which allowed the athletic department to think about what areas could be enhanced. She said Moos recognized that the cheer squad played an important role.\n\n\u201cI credit him quite a lot for moving the project forward,\u201d she said.\n\nThere are very few cheer squads that don\u2019t incorporate stunts and tumbling, and there was a clear upside to adding men to the squad, according to Moos.\n\n\u201cThe addition of male squad members has enhanced our gameday experience, and provides another opportunity for young people to be involved with our athletic department and our university,\u201d he said in an email.\n\nButzke said she cast a wide net when recruiting men to try out for the squad and received a stronger response than she expected. She was only planning on selecting four men, but after whittling the candidates to the final six, she saw something unique that each person could bring.\n\nAnd she said the new additions embraced the challenge of learning stunts and tumbling.\n\n\u201cEven though they\u2019re new, we had our expectations right way,\u201d Butzke said. \u201cAs long as you have good instructors, guys and girls, it\u2019s not hard to put the puzzle pieces together.\u201d\n\nThe group is practicing and perfecting the skills to ensure it puts on an entertaining and, more importantly, safe performance.\n\nRestrictions were first placed on the Nebraska cheerleading program in 2002, six years after cheerleader Tracy Jensen suffered neck injuries after landing on her head during a practice session. While Butzke wouldn\u2019t comment on the injury and subsequent restrictions, she said the program has a \u201cperfection-over-progression\u201d mindset.\n\n\u201cSafety is at the forefront,\u201d she said. \u201cThe (male cheerleaders) take a lot of pride in making sure nobody comes down.\u201d\n\nThird-year cheer squad member and captain Lindsey Wood has seen the program reach new heights since the inclusion of male cheerleaders. She said the changes have laid the foundation for growth for years to come.\n\n\u201cIt has been, honestly, such a blast,\u201d she said. \u201cIt has been such a new thing for our program and with that it has challenged us to reach a new level and take things up a notch.\u201d\n\nWood said every member of the team approached the change with an open mind, eager to take the way they reach Nebraska\u2019s fans to new heights.\n\n\u201cWith change comes the opportunity for growth and opportunity for something new and exciting,\u201d she said. \u201cI think everyone on our team has bought into the idea that this is a group effort and it\u2019s been fun to show our fans something new.\u201d\n\nLamar said he thinks the 90,000 fans who fill Memorial Stadium have welcomed the change.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll never forget the very first game, when we went out there to warm up during the South Alabama game,\u201d Lamar said. \u201cThe very first stunt we threw up and landed perfectly, everyone just went bonkers and lost their minds.\u201d\n\nEven though the changes come at the tail end of Wood\u2019s career at Nebraska, she said the seniors are excited to see what the addition means for the program\u2019s future.\n\n\u201cAs a senior, and I can speak for my senior classmates as well, we have so much pride in this program and it means so much to us,\u201d she said. \u201cTo know we are leaving it with girls that are such hard workers and are so talented, it makes it a little bit easier to leave, knowing this program is in such good hands.\u201d\n\nFor Lamar, the experience has given him a deeper appreciation of cheerleading.\n\n\u201cI have so much more respect than I did before,\u201d he said. \u201cBeing able to see firsthand the amount of talent, strength, coordination these athletes have to have is unbelievable.\u201d\n\nNow halfway through the season, Lamar said the squad is looking to implement more-complex stunts. The group has come a long way since August, he said.\n\n\u201cYou grow together, that\u2019s, honestly, one of the coolest things about it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s new for everyone.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Lincoln Journal Star, http://www.journalstar.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Ramarro Lamar was in Marine boot camp in the middle of a July heat wave in Quantico, Virginia, when he got an Instagram message from Nebraska cheerleader Sydney Long.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Noah Johnson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/12/exchange-cheer_squad_96267_c0-417-3082-2214_s1200x700.jpg?84377ba8d0bd5605e17bd3aadc88884a6ded618b", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
