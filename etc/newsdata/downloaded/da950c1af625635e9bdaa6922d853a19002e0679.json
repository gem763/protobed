The Democrat isn\u2019t completely talking about it in Iowa but his surrogates vow the late Friday plea for $1.7M was just plain honesty.\n\n\u201cThis is what we decided on,\u201d one senior official pointed out to Buzzfeed. \u201cTell the world the truth.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a bit of amusement in this especially since one of my inboxes is full of desperate emails from Republicans vowing they\u2019ve missed their own fundraising goals. Those kinds of email are just gimmicky attempts to soak as much cash from potential donors as possible. The ruse is not limited to Republicans as Democrats use the same kind of language to boost their fundraising total. It\u2019s a rather tiresome game of raising funds through dramatic messages of dire consequences when the reality is much different.\n\nExcept for this time, apparently, which the Booker campaign is swearing on a stack of religious texts. Tribune News Services noted the timing is interesting because of the looming deadline for fundraising disclosures. Take that for what you will.\n\nThe reaction from the campaign seems to be thankful per Buzzfeed.\n\nIt was, somewhat incongruously, the best day of the race for the young aides on his staff since the launch. People felt a renewed sense of purpose, energized. In Iowa, the team here found out about the push to $1.7 million during a call on Friday. \u201cEveryone knows what we have to do and is going to work.\u201d They had a path forward, even if only for 10 days. There was almost, as some described it, a sense of relief.\n\nBooker PAC backers aren\u2019t sure what to think. One person told Buzzfeed it was way too early to bring this kind of drama into the presidential race regardless of its truth. Another adviser pointed out no one else wants to talk about the financial prospects of the 16+ other low polling Democratic campaigns.\n\nThe Booker money issues may be similar to the ones John McCain ran into in 2008. He performed extremely poorly in the beginning before a campaign reshuffle which involved ex-Texas U.S. Senator Phil Gramm taking over the finances. McCain recovered and got the nomination. Of course, 2008 is much different than 2016 because Booker is dealing with 20-something opponents whereas McCain dealt with \u201cjust\u201d eight. Any type of reshuffling by Booker would be more of a sign of weakness than anything else.\n\nDonors appear rather blas\u00e9 to Booker\u2019s call for money. His campaign said they received around 21% of the needed cash to stay afloat while also touting their strong infrastructure in early primary states and New Jersey. Rather odd to suggest you\u2019re almost out of cash if you\u2019re also promising to have a ground game. Of course, he\u2019s also got eight or so days to go before the end of October so the clock hasn\u2019t quite struck midnight, yet.\n\nAllahpundit sees Booker\u2019s potential demise as a big deal because he still thinks the New Jersey Senator has a chance to break out. The issue may be the fact Democrats have a populism problem much like Republicans in 2016. The injured feelings from the Hillary Clinton-Bernie Sanders primary won\u2019t go away anytime soon. The populists within the Democratic Party are still furious leadership denied Sanders a real fair shake against Clinton. Hence why Elizabeth Warren is polling so well in Iowa with Joe Biden right behind. Warren is as much of a populist as Ted Cruz while Biden straddles the line between apparent substance and populism.\n\nBooker has never appeared able to bring in populist support. He\u2019s certainly been more legislatively successful with his work on justice reform in the U.S. Senate. Yet there\u2019s no cult of personality with Booker, unlike the ones Warren, Biden, Sanders, and Barack Obama enjoy with Democrats. Booker would probably be sitting in fourth in a normal election cycle but this isn\u2019t one.\n\nThere is a bigger choice for Booker coming in the future and whether he\u2019ll continue this apparent doomed effort for the Democratic presidential nomination or focus squarely on re-election in New Jersey. He can do both, as it is, but it would involve more and more money which he (apparently) doesn\u2019t possess.\n\nIt\u2019s still interesting to see Booker\u2019s campaign look at his money issues as a positive and a sense of repurposing. Perhaps this move will give his race a bit of a boost. The most likely outcome is it stays hovering around 3% and eventually ends. Unless he\u2019s hoping to get the VP slot on any potential ticket.", "description": "Interesting way to look at things.", "authors": ["Taylor Millard", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Cory-Booker.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
