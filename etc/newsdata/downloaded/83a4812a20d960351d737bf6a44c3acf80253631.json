This one came across my Facebook newsfeed: \u201cGlobal warming \u2018provides a marvelous excuse for worldwide, supra-national socialism.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe hundreds of comments the quote received covered a variety of sentiments from hostility to adoration. A couple accused Thatcher of launching the entire global warming hoax to end a coal-miners\u2019 strike.\n\nAnother cited an earlier Thatcher quote: \u201cThe danger of global warming is as yet unseen, but real enough for us to make changes and sacrifices, so that we do not live at the expense of future generations. Our ability to come together to stop or limit damage to the world's environment will be perhaps the greatest test of how far we can act as a world community. No one should under-estimate the imagination that will be required, nor the scientific effort, nor the unprecedented co-operation we shall have to show. We shall need statesmanship of a rare order. It's because we know that, that we are here today. But the need for more research should not be an excuse for delaying much needed action now.\u201d CFACT, the poster of the comment, responded: \u201cThatcher evolved. Millions have joined her.\u201d\n\nI do not know if Thatcher started the whole hoax. I do not know the facts behind her \u201cevolution\u201d on the topic. What I do know is the damaging impacts climate change mitigation attempts have had on the economy\u2014a viewpoint the American government still clings to while the Brits (as evidenced by Thatcher\u2019s comments) have \u201cevolved.\u201d\n\nPerhaps, Thatcher did perpetuate the idea that CO2 emissions were warming the planet, but the theory was readily embraced in Europe. Natural-resource rich, the US has historically had lower energy costs than our European allies\u2014which gave us a competitive advantage. Pushing the global warming narrative\u2014which promotes wind and solar power as a curative\u2014attempted to level the playing field by moving all of us to higher-priced energy. Regarding the 2011 UN climate change talks in Durban, the Financial Times said the European Union (EU) \u201cis pushing hardest among developed countries for a new global deal\u201d and is \u201cthe greenest voice among wealthy countries at the talks.\u201d In a column I wrote in December 2011, I posit that the EU supported the climate change narrative specifically to raise energy prices in the US.\n\nRichard Courtney, a consultant on matters concerning energy and the environment who has served as an expert peer reviewer for the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, calls the global warming issue \u201cpolitical.\u201d He says: \u201cEach government has its own special interests in global warming but, in all cases, the motives relate to economic policies. In general, the USA fears loss of economic power to other nations while this is desired by those other nations. Universal adoption of \u2018carbon taxes,\u2019 or other universal proportionate reductions in industrial activity, would provide relative benefit to the other nations.\u201d\n\nWhatever the motive, the EU has led the way on renewable energy\u2014especially wind and solar. Germany, home of the Energiewende (energy transformation) has garnered a reputation as the country to follow when it comes to green energy. Having passed the Erneuerbare Energien Gesetz (renewable energy law) in 1991, Germany has poured huge subsidies into wind and solar power. Twenty-two percent of Germany\u2019s power is now generated with renewables (\u201csolar provides close to a quarter of that\u201d)\u2014which are \u201cguaranteed more-than competitive rates\u201d\u2014despite the fact that \u201cproducing electricity from sunlight costs 10 times more than generating power using coal or nuclear energy.\u201d Power companies are passing the costs on to consumers in the form of higher rates.\n\nI frequently hear Germany\u2019s record being held up as a shining example. After all, if Germany can get nearly a quarter of its electricity from renewables, why can\u2019t the US do the same? I\u2019ve had listeners of a radio show where I am a guest call in and tout Germany\u2019s record. If one doesn\u2019t know the whole story, it does sound admirable. I ask: \u201cHave you been following Germany recently?\u201d Silence.\n\nPost-Fukushima, Germany announced the closure of eight of its 17 nuclear power plants, with the remaining 9 to be closed within the next decade. To replace the 17 power plants, it was announced that Germany would build or revamp 84 power plants\u2014more than half would be fossil-fuel-powered, including 17 coal-fueled. This winter, it was reported that energy costs in Germany were so high that its residents were literally cutting down trees in city parks and stripping the forests in order to heat their homes.\n\nThe tree thefts are just one of the bizarre consequences of the EU\u2019s adoption of the climate change narrative. One of the newest revelations, reported by The Economist, is: \u201cBy far the largest so-called renewable fuel used in Europe is wood\u201d\u2014which it calls \u201cthe fuel of the future.\u201d\n\nThe Economist reports that nearly half of Europe\u2019s renewable energy comes from \u201cbiomass,\u201d while in some countries\u2014like Poland and Finland\u2014\u201cwood meets more than 80% of renewable energy demand.\u201d\n\nApparently, wood was included as a renewable that would help cut CO2 emissions\u2014the supposed driver of climate change\u2014because if the wood came from \u201cproperly managed forests, then the carbon that billows out of the chimney can be offset by the carbon that is captured and stored in newly planted trees. Wood can be carbon-neutral.\u201d As a result of the decision to allow wood to qualify for the \u201crenewable\u201d mandate, its usage has \u201csoared.\u201d In fact, wood has saved coal-fueled power plants that would have been shut down\u2014making it popular with power companies. Unlike expensive forests of wind turbines that require brand new, expensive, transmission lines, the coal-fueled power plants are already connected to the grid. They can also be \u201cadapted to burn a mixture of 90% coal and 10% wood (called co-firing) with little new investment.\u201d Additionally, wood-fueled electricity generation doesn\u2019t require back-up (redundant) power.\n\nWhile the EU\u2019s goal of getting twenty percent of its energy from renewables by 2020 is hurting the European economy and individual ratepayers, it is helping Canada.\n\nEurope\u2019s energy policy ends up helping the economies of both Canada and the US\u2014both of which didn\u2019t jump into \u201crenewables,\u201d as the EU did. The US never signed on to the Kyoto Protocol and Canada abandoned it in 2011.\n\nEurope doesn\u2019t have enough wood to meet demand, so a substantial chunk of it will come from imports\u2014which has created a booming new business in Canada and the southeastern US. Gordon Murray, executive director of the Wood Pellet Association of Canada, calls it \u201can industry invented from nothing.\u201d Who would have thought that not only is the US now a net exporter of gasoline, but now we are fueling Europe with \u201cbiomass?\u201d\n\nThe EU is seeing the error of their ways. \u201cThe European Environment Agency said, in 2011, the assumption \u201cthat biomass combustion would be inherently carbon neutral\u2026is not correct\u2026as it ignores the fact that using land to produce plants for energy typically means that this land is not producing plants for other purposes, including carbon otherwise sequestered.\u201d In fact, using trees for energy production actually, increases \u201ccarbon emissions compared with coal\u201d and scientists have now concluded that the idea of using wood as a renewable fuel was an \u201coversimplification.\u201d\n\nUnlike Margaret Thatcher, the EU is unlikely to \u201cevolve\u201d\u2014giving the US a competitive energy advantage Europe\u2019s global warming encouragement was intended to erase.\n\nWhile the US didn\u2019t sign on to a binding commitment to CO2 reductions, our energy policies have, like Europe, pushed the more expensive energies and punished the cost-effective. Data from the Energy Information Agency reveals that the average all-in cost for electrical energy to the customer has risen at twice the rate of inflation\u2014with no real identifiable and quantifiable fiscal benefit.\n\nThatcher was correct. Global warming has provided \u201ca marvelous excuse.\u201d The question is, will the US \u201cevolve\u201d and correct its course like others, or will we allow the climate change hoax to steer us toward full-on socialism.", "description": "In honor of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s memory, favorite quotes from the .09/13/2019 3:03:56AM EST.", "authors": ["Marita Noon", "Leah Barkoukis", "Cortney O'Brien", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png", "published_at": "2013-04-14"}
