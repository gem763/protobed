On the eve of the scheduled second leg Dom\u00ednguez had proudly talked up his plans to modernise the competition and make it, if not a rival to the Champions League, then at least a companion for it. The next day the Boca team bus was attacked on the way to the stadium.\n\nPlayers were traumatised. The captain, Pablo P\u00e9rez, had to go to hospital to have glass splinters removed from his eye. Others suffered the effects of inhaling pepper spray. The game was postponed for 24 hours and then called off again, shifted to a different continent so the Libertadores final suffered the symbolic indignity of being played in Madrid.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Boca Juniors\u2019 Gonzalo Lamardo, seen last year when the second leg of the Copa Libertadores final against River Plate was postponed. Photograph: Alejandro Pagni/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThis season is the first with a one-off final, a showpiece occasion Dom\u00ednguez believes is more marketable than the two-legged format that had been in use since the competition launched in 1960. What might have happened had Boca and River gone all the way again and caravans of rival fans had set out to traverse Argentina and cross the Andes for the final in Santiago doesn\u2019t bear thinking about. As it is, the two-legged supercl\u00e1sico semi-final is tension enough.\n\nDaniele De Rossi completes move to Boca Juniors after 18 years at Roma Read more\n\nInevitably, memories of last year have dominated the build-up, particularly given the various conspiracy theories that continue to ask how the attack on the bus could have happened. Few of the questions thrown up last year have been satisfactorily answered.\n\nWhy was security so lax? Was the spray that so affected Boca\u2019s players fired by attackers or police? Was the violence related to the arrest of a River ultra a few days earlier? Was it a false flag-attack seeking to have the game abandoned and awarded to Boca as a Libertadores last-16 tie had been awarded to River in 2015, when their players were attacked with pepper spray in the tunnel at La Bombonera?\n\nThis year River were at home first and the fact they won that leg 2-0, being denied a more comprehensive victory only by a number of fine saves from the Boca keeper, Esteban Andrada, may dampen excitement a little.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest River Plate\u2019s Ignacio Fern\u00e1ndez, right, tackles Ram\u00f3n \u00c1bila during the first leg of this year\u2019s semi-final, which River won 2-0. Photograph: Juan Ignacio Roncoroni/EPA\n\nBut amid the cauldron of La Bombonera, where there will again be no away fans as a result of the ban imposed in 2013, anything may be possible. For all that River seem the better side it is Boca who lead the table, three points above River, having secured a 0-0 draw at El Monumental in the league.\n\nThat said, the River manager, Marcelo Gallardo, has led his side on seven previous occasions at La Bombonera since taking the job in 2014 and has lost only once, 2-0 in May 2015. \u201cWe know how to play away games,\u201d Gallardo said. \u201cThere are no keys to tight matches. We are intelligent in playing these games and we have players with courage. We are going to suffer, for sure, but we respect our form. We are not going to betray ourselves and that is what I value most in our players.\u201d\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nGallardo is a hugely impressive figure, still only 43 but already with a Uruguayan league title with Nacional and two Copa Libertadores with River to his name. It says much for the dysfunction of Argentinian football at national team level that there has not been a more concerted effort to install him as national team manager. Only Carlos Bianchi and Osvaldo Zubeld\u00eda have won more than two Libertadores as managers.\n\nIf Gallardo can complete the job here and then see off either Gr\u00eamio or Flamengo (the first leg between the two, in Porto Alegre, finished 1-1) in the final, not only would it be a striking personal achievement \u2013 he would also have taken River, whose historical failures in the Libertadores were once the source of such amusement to opposing fans, to within one of Boca\u2019s total of six successes in the competition.\n\nLigue 1 clubs turn to experienced French managers to right wrongs Read more\n\nBoca are not, at the moment, a fluent attacking force. They were poor in a 1-0 home defeat to Racing on Friday, heavily reliant on the Colombian right-sided forward Sebasti\u00e1n Villa for any creative edge. Their 15 games this season have yielded just 16 goals. Only once have they scored more than two and it\u2019s more than two months since they last managed two goals in a game at home.\n\nAll logic says that a 2-0 lead should be too much for Boca to overhaul, but logic is often the first casualty of such nights. For Conmebol and Argentinian football as a whole, the biggest result would simply be the night passing off without the need for any postponements.", "description": "Memories of last year\u2019s shambolic Copa Libertadores final have dominated the build-up to this season\u2019s semi-final second leg", "authors": ["Jonathan Wilson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a4643e57c611fc0a4d725521e615d5b50c48a5f/73_428_2619_1572/master/2619.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3a88eb1ed1f44d02d1b4d4115deb3ae2", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
