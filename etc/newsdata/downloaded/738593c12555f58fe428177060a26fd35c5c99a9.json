Fars claimed the Turks attacked the Syrian army as it moved into position.\n\nSyria\u2019s state-run SANA news service reported on Sunday that a \u201csoldier from the Turkish occupation forces was killed and five others were injured\u201d during acts of \u201cTurkish aggression.\u201d\n\nThe Turkish Defense Ministry confirmed the casualty but said it occurred during a raid by \u201cPKK/YPG terrorists\u201d against Turkish troops who were \u201cconducting reconnaissance and surveillance activities.\u201d\n\nThe PKK is a violent Kurdish separatist party in Turkey. The YPG or \u201cPeople\u2019s Protection Units\u201d is the primary militia organization of the Syrian Kurds, supported by the United States as a battlefield ally against ISIS. Turkey considers the two groups to be one and the same, as the Defense Ministry\u2019s statement asserted.\n\nThe Turkish Defense Ministry claimed its forces \u201creturned fire\u201d after it came under attack and \u201cconfirmed targets were neutralized.\u201d\n\nSANA reported that Syrian army units are \u201ccontinuing deployment in other areas in framework of their national duties in facing the Turkish aggression and its mercenaries and defending the locals.\u201d\n\nThe Kurdish-led Syrian Defense Forces (SDF) are withdrawing from the same area, as anticipated by the agreement reached between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Sochi, Russia, last week.\n\nSANA quoted a source at the Syrian Foreign and Expatriates Ministry who \u201cwelcomed the withdrawal of armed groups in northern Syria to a depth of 30 km through the direct coordination with the Syrian Arab Army in a way that ends the basic pretext for the brutal Turkish aggression against the Syrian territories.\u201d\n\nThe SDF issued a statement on Sunday that after \u201cextensive discussions with the Russian Federation on our previous objection to some terms of the memorandum,\u201d it is ready to implement the Sochi agreement.\n\n\u201cThe SDF is redeploying to new positions away from the Turkish-Syrian border across northeast Syria in accordance with the terms of the agreement in order to stop the bloodshed and to protect the inhabitants of the region from Turkish attacks. Our forces in the border zone are being replaced by border guards of the central government,\u201d the SDF statement said.", "description": "Syrian army units moving in to secure the formerly Kurdish-held border region with Turkey reportedly clash with Turkish forces.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Turkey-Syria-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
