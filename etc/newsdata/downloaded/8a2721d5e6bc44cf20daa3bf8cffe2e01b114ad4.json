He was taken into custody early Monday morning in McKees Rocks, Penn., a Pittsburgh suburb, and has been charged by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office with federal drug charges of \u201cpossession with intent to distribute and distribution of a controlled substance causing death and serious bodily injury,\u201d according to a criminal complaint.\n\nThe seven victims, all men, were found at or near a luxury South Side Pittsburgh apartment block early Sunday morning. Five were found in the apartment, one in an elevator, and another was found outside the building, police said. All seven men were wearing the same orange wristband.\n\nThe three dead have been identified as Rubiel Clemente-Martinez, 32, of Columbus; Joel Pecina, 32, of Coraopolis; and Josue Soberal Serrano, 38, of Carthage.\n\nPolice said they quickly identified two nearby events that were handing out orange wristbands to patrons. Sanchez Montalvo was at the one of those events, the Insomnia Discotec in the Brookline neighborhood of Pittsburgh, according to a police press release. Insomnia is an after-hours club frequented by members of the Hispanic community, according to the complaint.\n\nAt some point in the evening, Sanchez Montalvo left Insomnia and joined others who were also at the event for an \u201cafter-party\u201d at the South Side apartment, according to the release.\n\n\u201cSanchez-Montalvo distributed a white powdered substance, believed to be cocaine, to those in attendance. Shortly after, multiple people became seriously ill. Three of them died at the scene,\u201d reads the press release.\n\nSanchez Montalvo allegedly produced a box with a large quantity of powdered narcotics that users believed to be cocaine. After cutting the narcotics, he began going around the room with a knife, \u201callowing individuals to sniff the white powder from it,\u201d according to the Department of Justice press release. \u201cThe surviving users stated that after they did a \u2018bump\u2019 of suspected cocaine people immediately began to drop and suffer adverse effects,\u201d reads the release.\n\nAn initial investigation by the Medical Examiner\u2019s Office has determined that the deadly drug fentanyl was cut into the white powder.\n\nAccording to officials, the overdoses appear to be an isolated incident, and the drugs were not passed around at the Insomnia event. Police, however, have warned the community that tainted drugs may still be in circulation.\n\nAccording to the complaint, a man offered to pay a band that was performing at Insomnia Saturday night to play at his apartment after the show. The band, which is from Columbus, Ohio, allegedly agreed and accompanied him to the apartment where the overdoses occurred. The complaint does not state whether members of the band are amongst the victims.\n\nLaw enforcement interviewed the person who legally leased the apartment, who stated that they do not live there and do not have a key to the apartment. According to the complaint, that person said they were only renting the apartment as part of a deal brokered for two Hispanic males in exchange for $500 in compensation. According to the complaint, \u201crenting apartments in other people\u2019s names is a common tactic used by individuals involved in drug trafficking in an attempt to avoid detection by law enforcement.\u201d\n\nAfter Sanchez Montalvo\u2019s arrest, law enforcement seized a California driver\u2019s license with his name and likeness, as well as a \u201clarge amount of cash, cellular telephones, and packaging material typically associated with heroin trafficking,\u201d according to the complaint. Officials also found a key fob and keys that allowed access to the building and apartment where the overdoses occurred.\n\nAccording to the complaint, a witness who was present during the overdoses said Sanchez Montalvo \u201cwas bragging and showing off all the money that he had\u201d prior to providing the drugs. This witness provided law enforcement with a video showing Sanchez Montalvo \u201cshowing off the money, cutting in to the kilo and scooping out the suspected cocaine, and serving the individuals in the apartment.\u201d\n\nSanchez Montalvo is scheduled to make an appearance in federal court Monday afternoon. If convicted, he could face a sentence of no less than 20 years and up to life in prison, according to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office.", "description": "Peter Rene Sanchez Montalvo handed out drugs laced with fentanyl at an after-party, authorities announced.
