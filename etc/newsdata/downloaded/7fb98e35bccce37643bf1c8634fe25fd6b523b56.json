Until Friday, only people with roughly $1 million in surplus cash at their banks were facing a negative rate. Now, the threshold has been reduced to just over $100,000, with no guarantee it won\u2019t go lower.\n\nOther banks have hinted they\u2019ll follow and economists say the development marks a major shift in how monetary policy will be felt across the economy.\n\nDenmark\u2019s latest response to negative interest rates has made it an even more interesting case study for the European Central Bank. Jan Storup Nielsen, a senior analyst at Nordea, reckons that many hitherto unknown consequences of negative rates will finally play out in the real world.\n\n\u201cSo far, it\u2019s just been a lot of theories about what will happen, but now we get a chance to see it in real life,\u201d Nielsen said. \u201cFor the rest of Europe and the ECB this is perfect, because they can let Denmark learn all the consequences and then see what they should decide.\u201d\n\nJyske Bank A/S, Denmark\u2019s second-largest listed lender, said it had no choice but to impose negative rates on all private customers with 750,000 ($110,000) or more. Chief Executive Officer Anders Dam said the latest Danish rate cut this month means Jyske is now \u201closing even more money\u201d when it deposits excess reserves at the central bank at minus 0.75%. Dam also says it\u2019s possible the rule will be extended to an even larger group of depositors.\n\nDenmark\u2019s monetary policy is designed to defend the krone\u2019s peg to the euro. But its effect on the broader economy is being closely watched. Danes have now spent seven years with rates below zero -- a world record -- and Dam at Jyske says he\u2019s bracing for another eight.\n\nNormally, low rates encourage more household spending as it gets cheaper to borrow and less appealing to save. In Denmark, negative rates have led to a surge in mortgage refinancing, but they\u2019ve also coincided with a record build-up of consumer deposits. And, as is the case in much of the rest of Europe, inflation is missing in action.\n\n\u201cHouseholds have gotten all the benefits of negative rates so far, but now they\u2019re starting to see the bad side of negative rates,\u201d Nielsen said.\n\nFor consumers, it\u2019s made more sense to keep their cash in a deposit account that paid zero, rather than invest in short-term market products at negative yields. Jyske\u2019s decision now has implications for everything from debt levels to inflation.\n\nBut it may not just be a question of economic theory. In Germany, lawmakers have debated whether to ban banks from passing negative rates on to retail depositors. Finland\u2019s regulator has also asked its lawyers to examine the legality of the practice. In Denmark, politicians have voiced concerns.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m worried,\u201d said Lisbeth Bech Poulsen, a member of the Socialist People\u2019s Party on which Denmark\u2019s Social Democrats rely to govern. Banks \u201care supposed to increase lending. This entire discussion is a sign that there is something completely wrong in the economy.\u201d Poulsen, who sits on parliament\u2019s finance committee, says she wants a \u201cpolitical discussion\u201d about potentially introducing \u201ca mechanism that prevents banks from imposing negative rates on their customers.\u201d\n\nBut whether banks lend more or consumers deposit less, the monetary upshot is likely to be broadly the same. Rasmus Gudum, a senior economist at Handelsbanken in Copenhagen, says passing on negative rates to more retail clients \u201cwill enhance the transmission mechanism.\u201d\n\nGudum also says that Jyske Bank\u2019s decision was an important step for a finance sector worried about spooking retail clients. \u201cThe stigma has been removed,\u201d he said.\n\nNielsen at Nordea says it\u2019s not a given consumers will spend more. After years of real wage growth, shrinking unemployment and lower borrowing costs, \u201cthe vast majority of Danish households already consume what they think is appropriate,\u201d he said. Instead, he expects Danes to contribute more to their pension savings.\n\nAt the Danish Consumer Council, a consumer rights group, economist Ida Marie Moesby worries that \u201cpeople will take their money and invest in risky assets.\u201d\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Denmark is about to become a test case for what happens when banks start charging a lot of customers to store their money.That\u2019s because one of the country\u2019s biggest banking groups just changed the rules of the game, by removing the floodgate that had shielded most retail depositors.
