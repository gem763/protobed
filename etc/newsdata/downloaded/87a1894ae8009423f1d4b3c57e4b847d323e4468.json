If their board gets hacked, the admins could send the password to 8chan's admin to regain control of the board.\n\n8chan was taken offline in the wake of the El Paso shooting in August, because web infrastructure companies like Cloudflare pulled their support.\n\nThe man suspected of conducting the massacre in the El Paso Walmart on Aug. 3 posted a four-page rant to 8chan attempting to explain his actions. In March, the man who allegedly killed dozens of people at two New Zealand mosques posted a screed to the site just before the attack. Weeks later, the suspect in the shooting at a synagogue in Poway, California, did the same.\n\nSo far very little is known about what Jim Watkins, owner of NT Technology, and his son Ron, who was 8chan\u2019s administrator, are planning with 8kun.\n\nThe official Twitter account of 8kun posted a Hollywood-style video on Sunday revealing the 8kun name and logo (a snake in the shape of an 8) with the video featuring flames, thunder and lightning, and some very dramatic music.\n\nThe name appears to be an attempt to show the website is growing up. In Japanese, the suffix \u201cchan\u201d typically refers to a child, while \u201ckun\u201d typically refers to a young man.\n\nThe new website is offline, but it has been registered with Tucows, the same company that banned 8chan in August. Tucows told VICE News that it was unaware of the situation and was looking into it.\n\nREAD: How 8chan was born \u2014 and became the worst place on the internet\n\nRon Watkins, who has been periodically promising a return for 8chan in recent months, tweeted on Sunday: \u201cAfter a few weeks of building new groundwork to better protect user privacy and security, we are now in the final stretches before getting things back online. Beta testing of infrastructure in progress \u2014 verifying and confirming that all systems are functioning as expected.\u201d\n\nIn September, in response to 8chan\u2019s role in the series of mass shootings, the House Homeland Security Committee subpoenaed Jim Watkins to testify in a closed-door session, which lasted for hours.\n\nREAD: 8chan\u2019s owner will tell Congress his site is about Video Game Tips and 'Down-Home Recipes.' Oh, and Mass Shootings.\n\nIn a prepared statement submitted to the committee, Watkins said 8chan \u201cmay come back online, but only when 8chan is able to develop additional tools to counter illegal content under United States law.\u201d\n\nFred Brennan, the estranged founder of 8chan, calls the rebuild and re-brand effort a cynical attempt to make people think 8kun is completely different than 8chan.\n\nBrennan says he doesn\u2019t think a lot of people will sign up, but says that the success of 8kun hinges on the return of the QAnon crowd.\n\nQAnon, a wild conspiracy theory that revolves around the claim that deep-state liberal elites are running a child sex trafficking ring, has captured the imaginations of President Trump\u2019s most ardent MAGA supporters. QAnon supporters regularly appear at Trump\u2019s rallies, and the FBI has warned that the movement could inspire domestic terrorists.\n\nThe conspiracy theory's mysterious leader \u201cQ\u201d told his followers that his communications would never occur outside of 8chan and that 8chan was the military's chosen platform for leaking intel.\n\nSo when 8chan went offline in August, the QAnon community were left adrift.\n\n\u201cI expect one of his first \"drops\" on 8kun will be to post a key so that \u201cQ\u201d can use other platforms in the future,\u201d Brennan said. \u201cThat's why, if you ask me, it's so crucial that 8kun never be allowed to fully come online \u2014 if it does, QAnon can spread. Without it, QAnon is essentially dead.\u201d\n\nCover: Jim Watkins/YouTube.", "description": "The message board has a new name and a new URL, but it will welcome back all the users that made it a hub for hate speech and extremist conspiracy theories.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d9dc5d3e56a4600094464a7/lede/1570625843772-Screenshot-2019-09-05-at-54801-AM.png?crop=0.9876543209876543xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
