However, its efforts have been bitterly opposed by the dictator\u2019s family.\n\nAt the end of September, the supreme court ruled that Franco\u2019s body could be removed and reinterred in the Mingorrubio municipal cemetery outside Madrid where his wife, Carmen Polo, is buried.\n\nSpeaking after a weekly cabinet meeting, the acting deputy prime minister, Carmen Calvo, said the dictator\u2019s remains would be exhumed by 25 October. She said the Franco family would be given 48 hours\u2019 notice of the removal and reburial in case they wished to be present.\n\nCalvo said the body of Franco, who she said was \u201cthe author of a dark chapter of the country\u2019s past\u201d, would be treated with the \u201cabsolute respect\u201d that all human remains deserved.\n\nThe socialist party, led by the acting prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has long argued that the basilica and its 150-metre (490ft) cross are a monument to the Franco regime that glorifies the winners of the civil war rather than commemorating its 500,000 victims.\n\nThe Valley of the Fallen, which was partly built by captured republicans and political prisoners, is a mass grave containing the remains of more than 30,000 people who fought on either side of the war.\n\nOnly two graves are marked \u2013 those of Franco and Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera, the founder of the Falangist party.\n\nCalvo said legal appeals from the Franco family had delayed the exhumation, which was scheduled originally for 10 June, and the government was pleased finally to be able to \u201cput a dignified end to something undignified\u201d after more than 40 years.\n\n\u201cWe want [the valley] to be a place dedicated exclusively to peace and forgiveness and a place of justice for all those who were victims of an atrocious war,\u201d she said.\n\nThe site will be closed to visitors from Saturday to allow the exhumation preparations to begin and to keep it clear of protesters.\n\nThe government wanted to complete the exhumation before campaigning begins for Spain\u2019s general election on 10 November. The country is returning to the polls for the fourth time in as many years after S\u00e1nchez\u2019s party won the most votes in April\u2019s election but fell short of a majority and was unable to form a stable government.", "description": "Spanish deputy PM says dictator\u2019s family will be given 48 hours\u2019 notice of exhumation", "authors": ["Sam Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adebb77140761ae61ea0837144c8a145f65fae79/331_364_4695_2817/master/4695.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=80d01df1a125cd5d2397f5387e71ced1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
