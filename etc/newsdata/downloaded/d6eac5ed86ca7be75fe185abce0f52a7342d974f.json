The pizza giant\u2019s same-store sales, a key industry metric, also missed expectations.\n\nShares tumbled more than 3% in pre-market trade Tuesday.\n\nHere were the numbers for Domino\u2019s third quarter, compared to Bloomberg-compiled estimates:\n\nRevenue: $820.8 million vs. $823.10 million expected\n\nAdjusted earnings per share: $2.05 vs. $2.07 expected\n\nDomestic same-store sales: +2.4% vs. +2.6% expected\n\nInternational same-store sales: +1.7% vs. +2.8% expected\n\nDomino's pizza.

The pizza giant now expects U.S. same-stores sales growth between 7% to 10% over the next two to three years. It previously anticipated same-store sales growth between 8% and 12% over a three to five year period.\n\nMeanwhile, internationally, Domino\u2019s sees same-store sales growth between 1%-4% over a two to three year period. Previously, the company expected 3% to 6% same-store sales growth over the next three to five years.\n\n\u201cIt was a good quarter for Domino's, as we continue to lean on our fundamental strength against a unique competitive environment,\u201d Domino\u2019s CEO Ritch Allison said in a statement.\n\nCompetition in the fast-food industry has been running hot, as companies focus on new menu innovation, upgraded technology and delivery to drive higher sales and increase foot traffic.\n\nFor many years, Domino\u2019s was able to dominate the industry with strong same-store sales growth thanks to its early adoption of technology. However, in recent quarters, the pizza giant has struggled to gain its footing as competition and third-party delivery apps threaten to stunt its growth.\n\nFollowing Domino\u2019s second-quarter earnings report, Allison cited \u201cheadwinds related to aggressive activity from third-party delivery aggregators. I do not expect this activity to ease in the near-term.\u201d\n\nShares of Domino\u2019s have dipped 1.6% this year, as the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 19% in the same time period.\n\nDomino\u2019s earnings conference call with management kicks off at 10 a.m. ET.\n\nThis post is developing.
