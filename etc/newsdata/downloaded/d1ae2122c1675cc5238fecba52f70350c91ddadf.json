Vanessa has just won a Bafta and she\u2019s brilliant, and in a way you have the ghost of the real Margaret and the ghost of the actress who played her,\u201d Bonham Carter said.\n\n\u201cYou also have the fact everyone has an opinion about the woman and yet ultimately very few people knew what her private life was like and that\u2019s the sort of the joy of the job.\u201d\n\nBonham Carter, who was speaking at the Cheltenham Literature Festival, said she had read biographies of Princess Margaret and also spoke with close friends and family.\n\nPrincess Margaret (John Stillwell/PA)\n\nThe 53-year-old also revealed she had met the princess as a child because her uncle, former Liberal MP Mark Bonham Carter, was a life-long friend.\n\n\u201cThey really loved her, and when you go to the inner circle of people and talk to three ladies in waiting, a couple of relatives, a very close relative, and some really some close friends, they were very happy to talk about her because they miss her,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI felt very lucky to suddenly be the receptacle of all these stories and a lot of the time I am not going to use it, but I wanted to make sure that I wasn\u2019t going to abuse it.\n\n\u201cI think, for a lot of the friends, they are so tired with her being portrayed in a one-dimensional, very bitchy understanding of her. She herself felt very misunderstood, certainly through the press.\u201d\n\nBonham Carter said The Crown is not a documentary but hoped those who knew the princess would like the portrayal.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t look like her. You just hope you get something of an idiom and a blade or a scent of them and it transforms your inner landscape,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe Crown has been very, very compassionate to most of the members of the family and has been very positive.\n\n\u201cA lot of it is true and there is a whole floor of researchers.\u201d\n\nDescribing meeting Princess Margaret as an adult, Bonham Carter said: \u201cI met her at Windsor at a reception and she was on her own and I approached her.\n\n\u201cShe said \u2018Oh Helena\u2019, and she knew who I was because of Mark and knew who my dad was and she said \u2018You are getting better at acting, aren\u2019t you?\u2019\u201d\n\nBonham Carter also revealed that she consults a psychic and a graphologist ahead of playing some of her major roles.\n\nShe said the graphologist was able to help her to play Queen Elizabeth alongside Colin Firth\u2019s King George VI in The King\u2019s Speech.\n\n\u201cI think Margaret was very much her father\u2019s daughter. She had the anxiety he had, and I think a lot of people interpreted her as angry, rude and tough,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cShe wasn\u2019t tough at all, and I think she was quite vulnerable and often attack was the best form of defence.\u201d\n\nBonham Carter also revealed details of what the psychic said, telling the audience: \u201cWhen you play someone who is real, you kind of want their blessing.\n\n\u201cShe said \u2018You\u2019re better than the other actress that they were thinking of.\u2019 They will not admit it was me and somebody else but it\u2019s a very Margaret thing to say. She was really good at complimenting you but putting you down at the same time.\n\n\u201cThen she said \u2018You have to brush up and be more groomed and neater\u2019 and then she said \u2018Get the smoking right\u2019 by smoking in a very particular way and remember that the cigarette holder was very much a weapon of expression as it was for smoking.\u201d", "description": "The actress spoke about taking over from Vanessa Kirby in The Crown and also trying to get under the skin of the princess\u00b4s complex character.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/08/wire-19355088-1570347816-71_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
