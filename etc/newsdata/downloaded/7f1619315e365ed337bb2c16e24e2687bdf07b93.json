Aramco Needs More Than Bourse\u2019s Invisible Hand to Buoy Its Stock\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Saudi Aramco\u2019s shares, when they\u2019re finally issued, may just prove to be havens in a volatile region. At least in the beginning.\n\nGiven the wide-spread speculation that government-related funds prop up the market when times are bad, some investors assume shares of Saudi Arabian Oil Co. wouldn\u2019t be allowed to perform badly, especially given the hype around the initial public offering.\n\nBut even if they do, the support probably won\u2019t be enough to keep global fund managers invested in Aramco\u2019s stock for long, despite the company\u2019s intrinsic ties to the kingdom and its finances.\n\n\u201cShort-term investors will find the downside protection, if there, comforting,\u201d said Thea Jamison, a portfolio manager at Change Global Investment in Camas, Washington. In the long-run, investors would ask \u201cbigger questions\u201d about the company\u2019s \u201cfundamentals, its long-term growth outlook, the country\u2019s macroeconomic environment and political risks.\u201d\n\nThe Invisible Hand\n\nAramco\u2019s offering shines a light on what some investors call \u201cthe invisible hand\u201d that shields Saudi Arabia\u2019s stock market during times of crisis. A year ago, there was speculation that funds with links to the government swooped in during the fallout of Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s murder, and in 2017, when local billionaires were imprisoned at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Riyadh.\n\nThere was also sign of support after last month\u2019s attacks on the kingdom\u2019s oil facilities, with the main stock index recovering about half its losses within the first hour of trading.\n\nAramco \u201cwill be a showcase for the Tadawul,\u201d said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, a senior market analyst at London Capital Group. \u201cTherefore, the Saudis won\u2019t refrain from giving the necessary support to Aramco shares. And they have the means to do so.\u201d\n\nThe share sale, which has been in the making for at least three years, is the centerpiece of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s efforts to modernize the economy and diversify the nation\u2019s revenue from oil. That drive includes turning Riyadh\u2019s bourse into a gateway for foreign investment.\n\nThe offering is going ahead even though the strikes risk reducing Aramco\u2019s valuation, which Prince Mohammed has put at over $2 trillion.\n\nBased on his target, a 1% float would be valued at about $20 billion, or about 4% of the Saudi stock market. The state-run company plans to announce its intention to float around Oct. 20, and its listing could take place as early as November, according to people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nNo Guarantee\n\nJudging by the performance of equities held by the Public Investment Fund, the biggest investor in the equities market, Saudi Arabia\u2019s reliance on Aramco doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the so-called invisible hand will buoy the shares indefinitely.\n\nShares of Saudi Telecom Co., National Commercial Bank, Riyad Bank and Samba Financial Group have outpaced the benchmark index over the past two years, while those of Saudi Basic Industries Corp, Saudi Arabian Mining Co. and Almarai Co. have lagged. PIF\u2019s holdings in these stocks vary from about 15% to 70%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n\u201cOver the multi-month and multi-quarter time-frames relevant for institutional investors, government support for a share price cannot fight the prevailing wind,\u201d said Hasnain Malik, the Dubai-based head of equity strategy at Tellimer.", "description": "Aramco Needs More Than Bourse\u2019s Invisible Hand to Buoy Its Stock", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEF1Q0XU_L.jpg"}
