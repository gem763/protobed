The administration plans to replace it with its own version, according to the officials, who were not authorized to speak publicly about the decision and spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nEPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler and Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works R.D. James scheduled a news conference for later Thursday.\n\nThe action is the latest in a series of Trump administration moves to roll back environmental protections put into place under former President Barack Obama.\n\nFarmers, homebuilders and other business interests have pushed for repeal of the clean water rule, saying it has harmed economic development and violates property rights.\n\nBut environmentalists say the move would leave millions of Americans with less safe drinking water and damage wetlands that prevent flooding.\n\nThe Natural Resources Defense Council said the Trump administration\u2019s action would be challenged in court.\n\n\u201cThe Clean Water Rule represented solid science and smart public policy,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cWhere it has been enforced, it has protected important waterways and wetlands, providing certainty to all stakeholders.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Trump administration plans to revoke an Obama-era regulation that provided federal protection to many U.S. wetlands and streams, according to two Environmental Protection Agency officials with knowledge of the plan.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Flesher"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/12/trump_clean_water_49678_c0-0-5060-2950_s1770x1032.jpg?9acfc04883c29c9db8d37c3f8a0baa4fbaaffd9f"}
