The dictator he has deposed tells him about a mirror given to him by \u201can old woman,\u201d a mirror that will show him who\u2019s plotting to assassinate him. The revolutionary soon sees enemies everywhere and begins to unravel, picking off his comrades one by one, believing they are out to get him.\n\nFantasy, sure. But President Trump and Vice President Pence could use such a mirror to reveal those partisan forces attempting to carry out political assassination on the entire Trump administration.\n\nThe latest assault comes from another anonymous \u201cwhistleblower,\u201d who told The Washington Post a Treasury Department official appointed by Mr. Trump sought to interfere with an audit of the tax returns of the president \u201cor\u201d vice president. Doesn\u2019t that sound vague? On Sunday, the attorney for the first whistleblower told ABC News he is representing a second whistleblower who has \u201cfirsthand\u201d knowledge of the president\u2019s call to the president of Ukraine.\n\nThe first anonymous whistleblower has tentatively agreed to meet with congressional lawmakers, according to CNN, on the condition that his or her legal counsel is cleared to accompany the whistleblower to the meeting. No word yet on the second whistleblower\u2019s conditions.\n\nThis is all political theater and bad theater at that. Democrats are going through the motions of impeachment, hoping to thwart the president\u2019s re-election. They know the Senate is unlikely to convict him should impeachment articles be approved. It\u2019s all about pleasing their base and fundraising, which both sides are doing. This is one of many reasons Congress\u2019 approval ratings remain low.\n\nRuslan Ryaboshapka, Ukraine\u2019s new general prosecutor, told Reuters that he was not aware of any evidence of wrongdoing by the son of former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, but would be reviewing criminal cases opened by his predecessor, including some that could relate to the Ukrainian gas company, Burisma, a natural gas company that paid Hunter Biden.\n\nIf John Durham, the Connecticut prosecutor tapped by Attorney General William Barr to look into the origin of the phony Russian collusion probe, comes up with facts that lead to the indictment of anti-Trump Democrats, will that make any difference to those smearing the president? It might in public opinion, which Democrats are trying to shape against the president, but probably not to the real conspirators and colluders, except perhaps some lower-level types. The Establishment always protects its own. Could it be possible that Democrats are rapidly pursuing the impeachment inquiry to soften any blows that might come from Mr. Durham\u2019s report?\n\nThat the president had to suggest Ukrainian and even Chinese leaders look into Hunter Biden\u2019s possible corrupt activity is its own indictment of the anti-Trump media, Obama administration holdovers and career prosecutors.\n\nThe conservative organization Judicial Watch has been relentless in its pursuit of collusion by anti-Trump actors. It has released 145 pages of communications between former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and others which it says include a one-line email to special counsel Robert Mueller. It said, \u201cThe boss and his staff do not know about our discussions.\u201d The communication included \u201coff the record\u201d emails with major media outlets (collusion?) around the time of Mr. Mueller\u2019s appointment and \u201cshow that Rosenstein did not dispassionately go along with the fraudulent probe in an attempt to get at the truth, but was an active participant in the deep state coup, secretly plotting with other FBI and DOJ officials against the president of the United States.\u201d\n\nJudicial Watch President Tom Fitton said, \u201cthe astonishing emails further confirm the dishonest corruption behind Rosenstein\u2019s appointment of Robert Mueller. The emails also show a shockingly cozy relationship between Mr. Rosenstein and anti-Trump media reporters.\u201d\n\nIf true, why is that shocking, given the nonstop media assault on Donald Trump even before he took office? Their goal has been to impeach, or damage him sufficiently so a Democrat will win the White House next November. Consider the one-sided \u201ccoverage\u201d in major newspapers, the broadcast and at least two cable networks.\n\nMore facts will emerge that undermine the Democrats\u2019 narrative, but it won\u2019t matter to anti-Trumpers. They live in the Twilight Zone.\n\n\u2022 Cal Thomas, a nationally syndicated columnist, is the author of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Expiration Date: The Fall of Empires, Superpowers and the United States\u201d (HarperCollins/Zondervan, January 2020).\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
