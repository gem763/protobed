Trouble is, things are not quite so catastrophic.\n\n\u201cBy what logic is our modest, fortunate warming since the end of the Little Ice Age necessarily a bad thing? A little over a century ago we emerged from the coldest, most difficult climate period of the past 10,000 years. The benefits have been measurable and substantial,\u201d observes James Taylor, director of the Arthur B. Robinson Center for Climate and Environmental Policy at The Heartland Institute.\n\nFor the uninitiated, the aforementioned Little Ice Age is a phenomenon first tracked by geologist Francois Emile Matthes some 80 years ago. Consider that pack ice and glaciers grew, warm summers became rarities and \u201cglaciation\u201d killed plant life, roughly from the Medieval era to the late 19th century. Voila. The Little Ice Age.\n\n\u201cAs our climate continues its modest warming and recovery from the challenges of the Little Ice Age, global crop production sets new records virtually every year. NASA satellites have documented a significant greening of the Earth, with more lush vegetation. Extreme weather events like tornadoes and droughts have become less frequent and severe. Yes, they still occur \u2014 as they have done since long before humans invented SUVs and coal-fired power plants \u2014 but nearly all extreme weather events are becoming less frequent and severe or are showing no significant worsening trend,\u201d Mr. Taylor notes.\n\n\u201cWhen politicians claim that global warming is a crisis that demands radical action, they neglect to mention that their plans would cost much more right now than the estimated costs of warming\u2019s impacts in 2100,\u201d says Myron Ebell, director of the Center for Energy and Environment at the Competitive Enterprise Institute.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Green New Deal, for example, would cost an average household $70,000 in just the first year, he says, citing a study his organization conducted.\n\n\u201cThe American people deserve an honest discussion about the colossal costs of climate policies before we allow the government to dictate how we heat and cool our homes, what types of vehicles we drive, and even that we must take the train across country rather than fly,\u201d Mr. Ebell notes.\n\nCONGRESS: THE PREDICTIONS ARE IN\n\nOh joy, Congress return to the nation\u2019s capital Monday, greeted by a flood of reviews and predictions from the press \u2014 which appears less than thrilled that the lawmakers are back in town. Want to find information for yourself? Check the \u201cLegislative Activity\u201d heading at House.gov and \u201cFloor Proceedings\u201d at Senate.gov.\n\nIn the meantime, a few stray headlines to greet the new week:\n\n\u201cCongress set for maneuvering to avoid another government shutdown\u201d (MarketWatch); \u201cDorian leaves, Congress returns\u201d (Fox News Radio); \u201cCongress returns for a bleak fall session\u201d (Roll Call); \u201cCongress returns after a bloody August sharpens focus on guns\u201d (Yahoo News); \u201cBritish Parliament, U.S. Congress both set to return from \u2018recess\u2019\u201d (Fox News); \u201cCongress returns to a battered Trump\u201d (The Hill); \u201cDefense budget talks to resume en masse upon lawmakers\u2019 return to Capitol Hill\u201d (Defense Daily Network); \u201cThe Trump tax return whistleblower may have given Congress a \u2018bombshell\u2019 tip\u201d (TPM News).\n\nWHY TRUMP IS IN NORTH CAROLINA\n\nPresident Trump will journey to Fayetteville, North Carolina, on Monday for another jumbo, good-natured, high-energy campaign rally which the new news media will condemn, then vigorously cover of course. This one has extra interest, though.\n\n\u201cAfter over two years of campaigns and a voided November general election over allegations of ballot fraud, voters in North Carolina\u2019s 9th Congressional District will finally choose their next congressman on Tuesday. As the campaign comes to a close, President Trump is front and center in the election: Republican Dan Bishop has explicitly tied himself to the president and cast his opponent, Democrat Dan McCready, as a radical socialist,\u201d writes CBS News analyst Grace Segers.\n\n\u201cThe president will also be front and center at a rally in Fayetteville, where Mr. Trump will stump for Bishop. A recent TV ad by Bishop\u2019s campaign shows footage of Mr. Trump praising the Republican candidate,\u201d Mr. Seger says.\n\n\u201cFor McCready, the election on Tuesday is his second chance at the seat. McCready ran against Republican Mark Harris in 2018, and appeared to narrowly lose in the November election, before allegations of absentee ballot fraud prompted the state elections board to call a new election,\u201d she adds.\n\nFOR THE LEXICON\n\n\u201cGaffable.\u201d\n\nThis handy term originated with R. Emmett Tyrrell Jr., the inimitable founder and editor-in-chief of The American Spectator. In a recent essay, Mr. Tyrell has referred to the \u201cgaffable Joe Biden.\u201d Not \u201claughable,\u201d not \u201caffable\u201d but \u201cgaffable\u201d \u2014 obviously reflecting the former vice president\u2019s tendency to mar his public appearances with, uh, gaffes.\n\nOf historic note: Mr. Tyrrell also referred to the \u201cgaffable Barack Obama\u201d in The New York Sun in 2008.\n\nONE FOR THE HEROES\n\nAn event of note this week: The ninth annual 007 \u201cTomorrow Never Dies\u201d benefit to honor Ground Zero heroes, staged at a hotel outside the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nThe honorees include Kenneth Burchell, a helicopter rescue pilot during 9/11; Master trooper Jeffrey L. Brock, 9/11 first responder in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, following the crash of Flight 93; Lt. Quentin D. DeMarco, Port Authority Police NY/NJ, 9/11 first responder; and P.J. Schrantz, New York City firefighter and 9/11 first responder at the World Trade Center.\n\nFormer CIA Director Michael J. Morell is the keynote speaker, there are casino tables, classic James Bond autos, a \u201cGoldfinger\u201d martini bar, silent auction, and much more. The event raises money for the Global War on Terrorism Memorial Foundation.\n\n\u201cThe gala focuses on individual acts of Valor, Courage, and Duty performed by injured U.S. soldiers and military heroes ranging from WWII, Vietnam, to the Gulf Conflicts,\u201d organizers say.\n\nCurious? The event is Saturday; consult 007benefit.org.\n\nPOLL DU JOUR\n\n\u2022 60% of Americans say illegal immigration is a very or somewhat serious problem in the U.S.; 88% of Republicans, 58% of independents and 38% of Democrats agree.\n\n\u2022 25% overall say illegal immigration is a \u201cminor problem\u201d in the U.S.; 7% of Republicans, 25% of independents and 40% of Democrats agree.\n\n\u2022 8% says illegal immigration is \u201cnot a problem\u201d; 2% of Republicans, 7% of independents and 15% of Democrats agree.\n\n\u2022 7% are not sure; 4% of Republicans, 10% of independents and 6% of Democrats agree.\n\n\u2022 54% of Americans do not personally know anyone who is an illegal immigrant. 53% of Republicans, 52% of independents and 58% of Democrats agree.\n\nSource: An Economist/YouGov poll of 1,500 U.S. adults conducted Sept. 1-3.\n\n\u2022 Kindly follow Jennifer Harper on Twitter @HarperBulletin\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
