Now they are savouring a full-scale love-in with their Brazilian-born Italian international midfielder.\n\n\u201cYes, it made me a little bit sad because I knew it was not like that but in my mind I just have to work hard and change their minds, and they have to notice they made a mistake about myself,\u201d said Jorginho, who followed Sarri to London from Napoli for \u00a352 million two summers ago.\n\nWhat a turnaround for Jorginho, 27, who could soak up the applause on Saturday, especially after converting the penalty that set Chelsea on the way to victory.\n\nIt has been quite a turnaround for Jorginho this season Credit: Reuters\n\n\u201cIt was amazing because last season it was impossible. I am very happy how they changed their mind about me. I worked a lot, I never said anything,\u201d he said. \u201cI am thankful for what I learnt from him [Sarri] but it is an opportunity to show I\u2019m here not just for the coach.\u201d\n\nJorginho encapsulated everything Chelsea followers disliked about the form of short-passing, possession-based, but inflexible style of football that became labelled Sarri-ball.\n\nTaking over from the popular N\u2018Golo Kante in the heart of midfield, Jorginho topped the Premier League\u2019s passing charts on 3,119 last season but ranked a modest 76th in chances created.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat has all changed under Lampard\u2019s blueprint. \u201cWe are playing with more long balls, more runs, less short passing. I try to do what the coach wants. Yes, it has changed a little bit but the mentality is the same, to press the other team and try to have control of the match,\u201d Jorginho said.\n\nFrank Lampard applauds the fans after Chelsea secured victory over Brighton Credit: Rex\n\nNow, after some confusion over penalty takers, Jorginho also appears to have has been entrusted with that role, stepping up after Brighton\u2019s Adam Webster had brought down Mason Mount five minutes into the second half.\n\nAsked whether, having converted 12 out of 13 penalties, he was now Chelsea\u2019s designated spot-kick man, Jorginho laughed: \u201cYou will have to ask Frank!\u201d\n\nAnother of this season\u2019s penalty takers, Ross Barkley, was on the pitch and Tammy Abraham also appeared interested but Jorginho revealed: \u201cHe came up and said, \u2018You are taking the penalty?\u2019 and I said, \u2018yeah\u2019, and so he said \u2018OK\u2019.\u201d\n\nWillian\u2019s strike completed Lampard\u2019s first home league victory in charge of Chelsea and sends his side into Wednesday\u2019s Champions League mission at Lille with spirits rising.\n\nDefeat at home by Valencia in the opening round was a major setback and Lampard hopes lessons have been learnt. \u201cThe Champions League is tough, there is a mindset to it,\u201d the Chelsea manager said.\n\n\u201cConcentration levels have to be at maximum. It showed against Valencia when we were the better team but switched off for a second and lost. We need to learn those lessons fast. We have experienced players and they need to help the young players.\u201d\n\nWhile Brighton continue to earn plaudits for their open, passing style, they have not won since the opening day of the season and are just a point above the bottom three.\n\nWhile they made Chelsea work for victory, there was a clear lack of a cutting edge. They took an hour to muster their first shot and registered just one on target all game.\n\n\u201cChelsea were the better team on the day and we didn\u2019t do what we do as well as we have done in other games,\u201d admitted Brighton defender Dan Burn, who headed against the Chelsea crossbar shortly before Willian wrapped things up.", "description": "He was the poster boy for Sarri-ball, the man of a thousand passes, most of them sideways, the player who regularly drove Stamford Bridge to distraction.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/TEnzpWccPmnz7nJLwCaK4Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/li6K0EEUWRxs16JXN0EhfA--~B/aD0xNDgwO3c9MjM2NztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/09dccbd6ef68b2666147d731b708da50", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
