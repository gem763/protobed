I have always known how special you are.\n\n(Image: Humphrey Nemar daily star)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\u201cWe often talked about how lucky we were to have found and kept each other.\n\n\u201cTrue childhood sweethearts, loving one another more and more with each passing day.\n\n\u201cNot a day went past that we didn\u2019t say I love you.

The hardest challenge of all is losing you.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cAlthough Andrew was strong, he was also unfailingly kind, a gentle giant with a heart of gold.\n\n(Image: Jonathan Buckmaster)\n\n\u201cHe wore his uniform with pride and vowed to challenge the bad and celebrate the good.\n\n\u201cAndrew was everything, my breakfast buddy, my dancing partner, the love of my life.

Authentic, brave, genuine and kind.\u201d\n\nBefore the service his coffin was driven through the city as uniformed officers and members of the public bowed their heads.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThe procession was led by mounted officers from Thames Valley Police.\n\nHis coffin, draped in a navy flag with police crest on the side, was carried into the cathedral by six colleagues.\n\nHenry Long, 18, from Reading, and two 17-year-old boys have been charged with PC Harper\u2019s murder.\n\nThey, along with Thomas King, 21, from Basingstoke, are also accused of conspiracy to steal a quad bike.\n\nThe group is due to stand trial next year.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nLissie Harper's tribute in full\n\nToday I would like to remember and honour the kind brave and lovely man we all know. We are all here just for you.\n\nAndrew.\n\nFrom the ever sweet, lanky, red faced boy passing me notes in class, to the strong and loyal man you grew to be. I have always known how special you are. We often talked about how lucky we were to have found and kept each other, true childhood sweethearts, loving one another more and more with each passing day. Not a day went past that we didn\u2019t say I love you.\n\nYou used to tell me we were a team and that we would get through all of life\u2019s hurdles together, how I wish you were here with me now. The hardest challenge of all is losing you.\n\nWe managed to pack so many amazing memories into the last 13 years, travelling the world, buying a house and getting married. You had a contagious love for life, filling each day with laughter and appreciating all the little things.\n\nYou have always been a protector. Whether in your role of big brother, fierce friend, loving husband or keeper of peace among the public, keeping everyone safe was your priority, not only in your job but your family too. Everything was always okay when you were around.\n\nAlthough Andrew was strong he was also unfailingly kind, a gentle giant with a heart of gold. He wore his uniform with pride and vowed to challenge the bad and celebrate the good.\n\nHe loved to be part of a team and had a work ethic to admire. Looking around me today I know that he was classed so very highly among his peers, known for being proactive, kind and fair.\n\nAside from the police however, Andrew treasured his family above all else, a country boy who loved the outdoors, picnics, bbqs and walking. We took many trips to Cornwall and Andrew was so at peace there, walking on the beach, Cornish pasties and fish and chips, it all made him so happy. This in fact was the last trip we took together after our wedding. I didn\u2019t realise at the time how precious those memories would become.\n\nTo many of you Andrew was a lovely little part of your lives or even just someone who was always there on the periphery of life. However to me Andrew was everything, my breakfast buddy, my dancing partner, the love of my life. He could fix anything and kept everything, pen lids, Tupperware, countless keys with no home, screws, holey socks and broken bits to glue back together. He was an adventurer, food lover, board game competitor, he miss-pronounced words and always fell asleep during film nights. He loved nights in and laying by the fire, or finding a new road to wander and discover.\n\nHe was always ready for the next adventure, never one to be deterred by anything, a positive force of nature. I will treasure every moment we had together from, sky-diving, bungee jumping, mountain climbing and white water rafting, to walking on beaches, collecting sea glass, cheeky takeaways and lazy mornings. We should have had so many more of these days together, for you Andrew above all deserved a lifetime of happiness.\n\nAndrew was so many things to many of us, husband, best friend, brother, son, uncle, nephew and colleague. The kindest of kind and sweetest of sweet\n\nHe could cheer me up when I was down just by pulling a silly face or making a joke. I could never stay mad at him for long because he made me laugh in the middle of an argument. Oh how I hated that.\n\nI\u2019ve never known anyone so kind, worry free, forgiving, positive and good as our Andrew,\n\nAn animal rescuer, he could often be found laying on a rug with the family dog and even taking many creatures to Tiggywinkles Animal Rescue. If there was an animal in need you always seemed to come across it, hedgehogs, deer and even birds had been known to take a trip in the car with Andrew. A true friend to all.\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing Andrew taught me it was to not sweat the small stuff and to treasure each day as if it is a gift. Every time I feel down and without hope I can hear his kind words in my ear telling me to keep going, Find laughter, seek happiness. Forever more I will live each day for you Andrew, every moment of joy, peace, and love I promise to think of my husband and feel lucky to have known him as much as I did, more than anyone. He was my hero and his spirit will live on in my memories forever.\n\nMy lovely boy, I miss you more and more as the days pass into weeks, my love for you will never fade, the sound of your laugh will stay with me. Your beautiful smile and warm embrace will fill my dreams and comfort me as you always have.\n\nA good friend said to me recently that they will never again complain about growing older, every year on this planet is a privilege, every grey hair a blessing, as not all of us will have the honour of getting old. More than anything I wish that my most favourite person had not been taken so early, so cruelly, so unexpectedly. \u201cI wish\u201d is a thought that no one should have to think! We should all get the chance to reach the true end of our lives, so for Andrew I only hope that we will live every day, every moment, as if it is our last. No more \u201cI wish\u201d, only \u201cI\u2019m glad\u201d.\n\nIf everyone on this earth had just an ounce of the kindness and generosity that Andrew had, I know that it would be a better place.\n\nAndrew loved movies. We spent many nights in together with our favourite films and snacks. So I tried to find something appropriate to say from one of his favourites. Unfortunately Andrew, the Matrix or Dumb and Dumber didn\u2019t quite seem the right fit for this beautiful place, but perhaps this one will.\n\nStop all the clocks, cut off the telephone, Prevent the dog from barking with a juicy bone. Silence the pianos and with muffled drum Bring out the coffin, let the mourners come.\n\nLet aeroplanes circle moaning overhead Scribbling on the sky the message He is Dead, Put cr\u00e9pe bows round the white necks of the public doves, Let the traffic policemen wear black cotton gloves.\n\nHe was my North, my South, my East and West, My working week and my Sunday rest, My noon, my midnight, my talk, my song, I thought that love would last forever: I was wrong\n\nThe stars are not wanted now, put out every one; Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun; Pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood. For nothing now can ever come to any good.", "description": "The officer's new wife Lissie Harper paid tribute to her \"breakfast buddy, dancing partner, and love of her life\" at his funeral in Oxford", "authors": ["Martin Fricker", "Kelly-Ann Mills", "Image", "Pa", "Humphrey Nemar Daily Star", "Jonathan Buckmaster"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20578876.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Police-officer-killed-in-Sulhamstead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
