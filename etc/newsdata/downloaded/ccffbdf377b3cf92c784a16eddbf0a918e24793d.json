(AP) (Str/AP)\n\nColumnist\n\nWith U.S. troops withdrawing from the Turkish-Syrian border and Turkish troops poised to attack, the Syrian Kurdish commander warned Monday morning that a bloodbath could be ahead \u2014 and pleaded for continued U.S. support.\n\nGen. Mazloum Abdi, the commander of the Kurdish-led militia known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, said in a telephone interview from his headquarters inside Syria that Turkish troops \u201care preparing to cross the border\u201d and that a major assault could come in \u201ca matter of days.\u201d\n\nThis latest chapter of the Syrian horror story follows a White House announcement late Sunday night that President Trump was, in effect, leaving the border unprotected in the face of a possible Turkish attack, despite repeated U.S. pledges over the past three months that the United States would seek to forestall such an assault if the Kurds pulled back troops and heavy weapons from the border zone.\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said U.S. forces \u201cwill not support or be involved in\u201d any Turkish attack and \u201cwill no longer be in the immediate area\u201d in northeast Syria. Her statement followed reports on Twitter than the United States was informing SDF commanders that U.S. forces would be abandoning some positions early Monday on White House orders.\n\nMazloum said that U.S. forces had withdrawn from observation posts along the frontier but remain in major SDF garrisons, such as Kobani. A knowledgeable U.S. source said that about 1,000 U.S. troops are now in the country and that the goal of the withdrawal was \u201cgetting out of the way\u201d of any Turkish attack, rather than quitting Syria entirely and immediately.\n\nMazloum said he was sending \u201cthousands\u201d from his total force, which he estimated at 70,000, north toward the border to defend Kurdish areas. He said that despite Turkey\u2019s superior firepower, \u201cit will be a big battle,\u201d if it comes, with the risk of significant bloodshed.\n\nThe Syrian Kurdish commander said the real danger was that Turkish forces would attempt \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d \u2014 evicting Kurds from their ancestral lands in northeast Syria and installing Syrian Arab refugees who have been living in camps in Turkey since the Syrian civil war began.\n\n\u201cIf ethnic cleansing happens in our area, or they kill Kurds and bring Arabs in, this will be the U.S.\u2019s responsibility,\u201d Mazloum said, speaking through a translator. \u201cThat is the result of this decision [by Trump] \u2014 the result will be ethnic cleansing and change of demography.\u201d At another point, the normally unemotional Mazloum spoke of the danger of \u201cgenocide\u201d against the Kurds.\n\nThe U.S. retreat under Turkish threats of invasion shocks the Kurds in part because they were such stalwart allies of the United States in its five-year campaign to destroy the Islamic State. Mazloum told me in an interview in Kobani in July that his forces had suffered 11,000 killed and 24,000 wounded in fighting the Islamic State. U.S. deaths in that campaign were fewer than 10.\n\n\u201cWe are asking President Trump to keep his promise\u201d to preserve safety and security for Kurdish allies, Mazloum said. He asked U.S. policymakers \u201cto stop this decision and stop the Turkish attack.\u201d He said that abandoning the Kurds \u201cis hurting U.S. interests and reputation. It\u2019s not acting according to American principles.\u201d\n\nAnother devastating consequence of a Turkish invasion is that it might allow hardened Islamic State fighters now in prisons controlled by the SDF to escape and resume their terrorist attacks. Mazloum told me in July that these prisons are holding 2,500 foreign fighters, including about 1,000 Europeans, in addition to 3,000 Iraqis.\n\nAll of these prisoners will pose a \u201cdangerous situation\u201d if SDF guards leave the prison camps to go fight Turkish invaders, Mazloum warned. \u201cThere is a possibility that because of lack of security, they will be out of control, and escape,\u201d he said.\n\nMazloum scoffed at the White House statement that the Islamic State prison camps would be protected by Turkish forces, noting that the foreign fighters had initially entered Syria through a porous Turkish border.\n\nThe United States has had other moments when it abandoned allies for domestic political reasons. But history is likely to record Trump\u2019s apparent decision to abandon the Kurds as a particularly egregious example of presidential disdain for moral consequences of foreign policy choices.\n\nRead more:\n\nDavid Ignatius: Instead of thanks, a critical U.S. ally faces only more threats\n\nJennifer Rubin: The corruption of U.S. foreign policy\n\nJosh Rogin: There\u2019s a new opening for Trump to avoid disaster in Syria", "description": "\u201cIf ethnic cleansing happens in our area, or they kill Kurds and bring Arabs in, this will be the U.S.\u2019s responsibility,\u201d says the Kurdish commander of the Syrian Democratic Forces.", "authors": ["David Ignatius", "Columnist Covering Foreign Affairs", "October At Pm", "David Ignatius Writes A Twice-A-Week Foreign Affairs Column."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/1EyzgNyP-CHhxTyQJYGRfkU_rMU=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NVYV2AHJCII6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
