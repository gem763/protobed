Helen Dickinson, of the British Retail Consortium, said: \u2018Government must reform the broken business rates system and the inflexibilities of the apprenticeship levy.\n\n\u2018While MPs rail against job losses in manufacturing, their response to larger losses in retail has remained muted.\n\n\u2018The Government should enact policies that enable retailers to invest more in the millions of people who choose to build their careers in retail.\u2019 She added the sector is also suffering from weak consumer demand and Brexit uncertainty. Retail employs around 2.97million people, compared with more than 3.1million five years ago.\n\nThe BRC said it expects the long-term decline to continue due to weak consumer spending, fierce competition and the move to spending online.\n\nThat has contributed to a 50 per cent drop in profit margins in eight years, according to yesterday\u2019s report by professional services firm A&M.\n\nThe report\u2019s authors also pointed to changing consumer habits, with people spending more on eating out and activities with friends rather than owning things. This has left the 150 largest retailers, including supermarkets, with 20 per cent more store space than required \u2013 piling on cost pressures and fuelling store closures and insolvencies.\n\nThere were 370 net closures in 2013, compared with close to 2,500 last year. However the report countered suggestions that so-called millennials and \u2018Generation Z\u2019 \u2013 groups of people born between the early 1980s and 2000s \u2013 do not want to visit physical stores.\n\nIt said they enjoyed seeing and feeling products, chatting to staff and returning items.\n\nMike Cherry, of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: \u2018Small retailers are truly feeling the pressure, with business costs rocketing, employment burdens weighing heavy and lingering political uncertainty.\n\n\u2018An overhaul of the disastrous business rates system must be prioritised to help all small firms. As Budget approaches, all eyes will be on the Chancellor to prove once and for all if he\u2019s on the side of small businesses.\u2019", "description": "Retailers have called on Chancellor Sajid Javid, pictured, to consider changes to business rates in order help under-pressure shops on the high street.", "authors": ["Tom Witherow", "Matt Oliver For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/01/20109638-0-image-a-38_1571875635030.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
