Wallabies and All Blacks T-shirts have sold out, a shop assistant says, glancing down at two sets of empty shelves. Spotting the flag emblazoned on a miniature rugby ball in the Guardian\u2019s basket, she quickly adds: \u201cThe England shirts are selling really well, too.\u201d\n\nThe warm and sustained blast of omotenashi hospitality directed at visiting teams and their supporters this week in Japan has almost made it possible to forget that much of the tournament\u2019s success will depend on the hosts, who begin their campaign in the opening fixture against Russia on Friday in front of a TV audience organisers say could reach 40 million \u2013 just under a third of the country\u2019s population.\n\nAll the world\u2019s a stage as giants of the game prepare for an epic battle | Robert Kitson Read more\n\nThe Welsh squad were serenaded with a rousing rendition of Land of My Fathers by 15,000 people at a training session; the All Blacks have been treated to enough displays of the haka to sustain them during the next six weeks of rugby; and an ear-splitting performance of taiko drumming should have blown away any post-flight cobwebs among the English contingent.\n\nAs it prepares for the opening fixture, the stakes could hardly be higher for Japan, both as a team and host of the first World Cup to be held in Asia.\n\nWorld Rugby had already taken a gamble a decade ago when it awarded the 2019 event to Japan, whose long association with the sport has never been matched by its achievements in the international arena.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Wales\u2019s team work out in front of spectators in Kitakyushu, western Japan before the Rugby World Cup begins.

Those victories included an astonishing 34-32 defeat of South Africa in Brighton. Four years on, it seems incredible to recall that the match wasn\u2019t shown on terrestrial TV in Japan.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rugby World Cup Japan mascots Ren-G at the Kamaishi Restoration Stadium.

Having been denied live coverage of the Springboks shock, Japanese TV viewers set a tournament record, with 25 million watching the team\u2019s next match, a 26-5 win over Samoa.\n\nAfter years of struggling to emerge from the shadow of next summer\u2019s Tokyo Olympics, the World Cup has finally penetrated the public consciousness. Almost all of the 1.8m tickets have been sold, with the organising committee president, Fujio Mitarai, confidently predicting that all 48 games will be played in packed stadiums.\n\nThe 12 match venues have been shared among rugby heartlands in Kamaishi and Osaka, but also cities such as Kobe and Fukuroi, where the sport barely registered a couple of years ago.\n\nOfficials say they are hoping two matches in Sapporo this weekend, including England v Tonga, generate 4.7bn yen ( \u00a335m) in revenue, as 80,000 of an expected total of more than 400,000 overseas fans descend on the tournament\u2019s northernmost venue.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rugby jerseys for sale in Kobe.
