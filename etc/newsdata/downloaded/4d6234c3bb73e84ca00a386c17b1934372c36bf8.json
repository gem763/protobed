(AP Photo/Elise Amendola)\n\nThe Thursday night showdown between the top candidates in the Democratic Primary provided very few surprises, but a lot of in-fighting and a little bloodshed was still visible on the stage.\n\nA debate featuring Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, and Elizabeth Warren front and center, surrounded by Andrew Yang, Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, Corey Booker, Kamala Harris, Julian Castro, and Beto O\u2019Rourke, the ABC News event was well-run and did a good job of clearly setting the candidates at one another without goading them into fistfights. The result was a lot of civil disagreement and a little bit of bitterness, all tied together with discussions of policy and the direction of the election cycle.\n\nHere are the winners and losers of the debate. As always, this is from a neutral/objective viewpoint and not through the lens of a conservative perspective.\n\nThe Winners: Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders\n\nIt should come as little surprise that the highest-polling candidates are such because they are the most talented politicians, but what makes this top three so appealing is that Warren and Sanders tag-teamed Biden and couldn\u2019t break him. Essentially, Warren and Sanders are the same, and they showed it in the way they responded to questions. This also became the early hurdle for Biden, who actually weathered the storm very well. He did not get frustrated, and maintained his talking points without sounding robotic. Sanders, clearly thinking to rekindle the hot moment from the last debate, used the \u201cI wrote the damn bill\u201d line again, but to substantially less effect than last time. Biden side-stepped the line, and Klobuchar would actually later say that while Sanders did write the bill, she actually read it, and used that to score a point over Biden.\n\nAs things stand right now, Sanders is likely going to go down in history as always the bridesmaid and never the bride. He will end up endorsing Warren, who was the stronger of the two socialists on stage.\n\nRunner-up: Corey Booker\n\nI will say this about Booker: He was the most human person on the stage tonight. His sense of comedic timing and his East-Coast-But-Still-Somewhat-Folksy mentality played very well on a stage beset by in-fighting. Booker just naturally seems like a nice person, and one you might want to have a drink with. He doesn\u2019t stand a chance, of course, but he is working all the right angles and in a different world, his views on charter schools (as described tonight as opposed to previous nights), the black community, and the need to work with Republicans to get things solved makes him the best candidate the Democrats have.\n\nThe Losers: Julian Castro, Kamala Harris, Beto O\u2019Rourke\n\nThese three are so much alike it\u2019s scary. Both Castro and O\u2019Rourke try to claim some sort of deep emotional tie to the Hispanic community, and Harris continues to try to be black as opposed to a cop. It isn\u2019t working for any of them.\n\nO\u2019Rourke is still pushing gun-grabbing and talking about the problems with Donald Trump\u2019s racism\u2026 and he does all this while being a rich, white male. If he was trying to be a walking contradiction, this is perhaps a little too-on-the-nose of him. He could very easily step aside and offer his support to a woman or person of color, but instead he chooses to run a race he has no shot at winning (which he knows, but he\u2019s too committed to the role now).\n\nCastro speaks very little Spanish, has been a career politician rather than a well-in-tune member of the Hispanic community and went after Biden in a very fierce and very unappealing way. I can\u2019t say that this debate hurt Castro, considering he is only polling at about two percent, but it sure didn\u2019t help him.\n\nHarris is trying to hard to tell African-Americans that she\u2019s just like them, and it\u2019s just not working. Ever since Tusli Gabbard took some well-aimed shots at her, Harris has been very quiet and somber since then, and she isn\u2019t looking to try all that hard to win these voting groups.\n\nThe Also-Rans: Amy Klobuchar, Andrew Yang, Pete Buttigieg\n\nKudos to Yang for offering Americans $1000 per month if people just signed up online and got selected. It was a bold move, but it happened at the beginning of the three-hour debate, and everyone had forgotten about it by the end of the debate. He didn\u2019t really stand out, save for a quick exchange about the nastiness of all the in-fighting, which Castro rudely responded to.\n\nKlobuchar had some good points, but she is just not a very exciting candidate and it still shows. Buttigieg, meanwhile, doesn\u2019t seem to know what he wants to be when he grows up.\n\nOverall, the debate wasn\u2019t terrible, though at three hours long, it was a bit much.", "description": "Bloodshed in Houston: The Winners and Losers of the Democratic Debate", "authors": ["Joe Cunningham", "Sister Toldjah", "Alex Parker", "Elizabeth Vaughn", "Sarah Lee", "Posted At Pm On September"], "top_image": "https://www.redstate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/JoeBidenAPimage.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
