London's FTSE futures were mostly\n\nflat as were U.S. stock futures .\n\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan\n\nadvanced 0.3% with Japan's Nikkei\n\nfinishng up 0.55% after hitting a one-year high. Australian\n\nshares climbed 0.3%.\n\nRisk appetite was also aided after U.S. President Donald\n\nTrump lifted sanctions on Turkey saying a ceasefire in northern\n\nSyria was now permanent.\n\n\"U.S.-China trade friction seems to be entering a truce, a\n\nno-deal Brexit looks increasingly likely to be avoided, and the\n\nU.S.'s posture against Turkey appears to have been softening,\"\n\nJPMorgan analyst Tohru Sasaki wrote in a note pointing to\n\nreasons for a rally in Nikkei.\n\nJPMorgan expects gains in the Japanese index to extend into\n\nyear-end led by share buy-backs.\n\nA private survey showed Japanese factory activity shrank at\n\nthe fastest pace in over three years in October, hurt by slowing\n\nglobal demand and trade frictions. Chinese shares did open higher but soon erased those gains\n\nwith the blue-chip index easing 0.3%.\n\nOn Wall Street overnight, the Dow and the Nasdaq\n\nadded 0.2% each while the S&P 500 gained 0.3%.\n\nTesla shares jumped 21% in after-hours trading\n\nfollowing a surprise third quarter profit.\n\nMicrosoft also posted forecast-beating profit and\n\nrevenue numbers after the closing bell though the outlook was\n\ndarkened by slower-than-expected take-up of its Azure cloud\n\nservices.\n\nEarlier, shares of U.S. industrial bellwethers Boeing Co\n\nBA.N and Caterpillar Inc CAT.N ended about 1% higher each\n\ndespite big earnings misses. RBC Capital Markets' chief economist Tom Porcelli pointed to\n\nconsistently alarming headlines since the first quarter of 2018\n\nsuggesting poor Caterpillar earnings meant a recession was round\n\nthe corner, though that has yet to transpire.\n\n\"We have been down this road before with CAT,\" Porcelli said\n\nin a note titled 'Still Waiting For Recession.'\n\n\"If you keep saying a recession is here, it is a\n\nmathematical certainty that at some point you will be right,\" he\n\nwrote. \"Maybe try again after CAT's next quarterly earnings\n\nreport.\"\n\nSo far, results from about 125 of the S&P500 companies are\n\nout with analysts expecting earnings to have declined 2.9%\n\nyear-over-year, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nBREXIT BATTLE\n\nCurrency markets stuck to tight ranges ahead of key central\n\nbank meetings this week and next with the euro zone, Japan and\n\nUnited States due to review policy. European and U.S.\n\nmanufacturing numbers are due later in the day. FRX/\n\nSterling paused at $1.2914 after rising 0.3% on\n\nWednesday with Brexit developments in focus.\n\nBritain appears closer than ever to resolving its 3-1/2-year\n\nBrexit conundrum but there are still hurdles to clear.\n\nEU member states on Wednesday delayed a decision on whether\n\nto grant Britain a three-month Brexit extension. Prime Minister\n\nBoris Johnson said if the deadline is deferred to the end of\n\nJanuary, he would call an election.\n\n\"The Brexit battle looks like it will drag on,\" economists\n\nat ANZ wrote in a note.\n\n\"The UK government will not meet its current timetable of\n\nleaving the EU on 31 October, and an extension appears likely.\n\nIn the meantime, Brexit uncertainty will keep weighing on UK\n\nbusiness investment and activity.\"\n\nThe single currency EUR=D3 was flat at $1.1132. The\n\nJapanese yen was 0.1% higher at 108.6 per dollar while\n\nthe Australian dollar AUD=D3 was a tad weaker at $0.6842.\n\nThat left the dollar index slightly lower at 97.452\n\nagainst a basket of six major currencies.\n\nIn commodity markets, U.S. crude CLcv1 eased 38 cents to\n\n$55.59 while Brent LCOcv1 slipped 22 cents to $60.95.\n\nGold was treading water at $1,491.51 an ounce.\n\n\n\nAsia stock markets https://tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4\n\nAsia-Pacific valuations https://tmsnrt.rs/2Dr2BQA\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n\n(Editing by Shri Navaratnam)\n\n", "description": "GLOBAL MARKETS-Asian shares inch ahead as earnings, geopolitics sway sentiment", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/STOCK-EXCHANGE-RUSSIAN-TRADING-SYSTEMS_800x533_L_1414427815.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
