(AP) - Notre Dame coach Brian Kelly believes Ian Book needs to be more decisive if the ninth-ranked Fighting Irish are going to find their identity on offense.\n\nThe senior quarterback gets his next chance Saturday when first-time opponent Bowling Green (1-3) visits Notre Dame (3-1).\n\n\u201c(Book) just finished his 13th going on his 14th game (as starter),\u201d Kelly said of his quarterback who last year took the Irish to the College Football Playoff but last week completed 17 of 25 passes for just 165 yards and no touchdowns in a 35-20 victory over Virginia.\n\n\u201cThere are some plays out there where he knows he sees them after the fact,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to work on that decisiveness. He\u2019s got the ability to be explosive.\u201d\n\nFor the season, the usually accurate Book has completed 63% of his passes for 993 yards and eight touchdowns, a total bloated by the 360 yards and five TDs he put up a 66-14 victory over New Mexico. In as 23-17 loss at Georgia, he completed 29 of 47 passes for 275 yards and two TDs with two interceptions. Last week, Book was sacked twice and took two intentional grounding penalties.\n\nThe offense, which has been slowed by injuries, penalties and sloppy play, has a chance to get better against first-year coach Scot Loeffler\u2019s Falcons, who are heavy underdogs after a bye week following their 62-20 loss at Kent State.\n\nLoeffler, a former quarterback at Michigan who has made stops at his alma mater, Florida, Auburn, Virginia Tech and Boston College, used the time off to simplify his offense. The Falcons\u2019 offense, averaging 352.5 yards (107th nationally) and 18.2 points (120th), need more production from quarterback Darius Wade (664 yards, three TDs) and running backs Andrew Clair and Davon Jones.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to limit what we do and try to get better at a few things and chip away at this,\u201d Loeffler said of preparing for a Notre Dame defense that had eight sacks and forced five turnovers against the Cavaliers.\n\nREUNION OF SORTS\n\nDefensively, the Falcons are directed by Brian VanGorder, who spent 2\u00bc seasons under Kelly as Notre Dame\u2019s defensive coordinator before being fired four games into 2016. His Falcons allow 448.5 yards (111th) and 38 points (120th) but do stand 20th in sacks with 12, a concern for Book and the Irish.\n\nVanGorder and Kelly first worked together at Grand Valley State from 1989-91. The 1-3 start in the 2016 season ended that working relationship.\n\n\u201cIt was tough, but hey, let\u2019s be real: We weren\u2019t getting the job done,\u201d VanGorder told The (Toledo) Blade this week. \u201cI understood Brian\u2019s decision in it.\u201d\n\nSince leaving Notre Dame, VanGorder has been a defensive analyst for Georgia and Oklahoma State and spent last season as defensive coordinator at Louisville for since-fired Bobby Petrino.\n\n\u201cRespect him as a football coach and as a person,\u201d Kelly said.\n\nCOACHING CONNECTIONS\n\nFollowing the 2016 season that ended 4-8, Kelly hired away defensive coordinator Mike Elko and linebacker coach Clark Lea from Wake Forest head coach Dave Clawson. Clawson, Elko and Lea were together at Bowling Green during an 8-5 campaign in 2012. Lea became Kelly\u2019s defensive coordinator last season when Elko joined Jimbo Fisher\u2019s Texas A&M; staff following 2017.\n\nISN\u2019T THAT JUST SPECIAL?\n\nWhen asked about special teams \u201chiccups\u201d against Virginia, Kelly joked: \u201cI would have used another letter to start with that.\u201d\n\nJonathan Doerer, in his first full year as placekicker, missed a 47-yard field goal in the second quarter. Trailing 17-14, the kick return unit then allowed Virginia to recover the second-half kickoff. Leading 21-17 later in the quarter, normally reliable punt returner Chris Finke fumbled the ball away.\n\n\u201cWe just weren\u2019t as good, and that is flat out want and desire,\u201d Kelly said.\n\nSEEKING R-E-S-P-E-C-T\n\nBowling Green, a MAC champion most recently in 2015, enters the game as a 45\u00bd-point underdog, its largest margin since the Falcons were 40\u00bd-point underdogs in 1997 to Ohio State, which won 44-13.\n\n\u201cEverybody here has a chip on our shoulder, and I feel like we have nothing to lose,\u201d middle linebacker Brandon Perce said. \u201cThey have a lot to lose.\u201d\n\nIRISH INJURIES\n\nWR Chase Claypool turned an ankle against Virginia but is expected to play. WR Lawrence Keys III, who started against New Mexico and Georgia, has a heel injury and is doubtful. DE Daelin Hayes had surgery for a torn labrum and is lost for the season; he tweeted he will return for a fifth year in 2020. CB Shaun Crawford, granted a fifth year because of three different season-ending injuries, is out 3-4 weeks with a dislocated elbow.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: http://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Notre Dame coach Brian Kelly believes Ian Book needs to be more decisive if the ninth-ranked Fighting Irish are going to find their identity on offense.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Fineran"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/28/notre_dame_virginia_football_53992_c0-252-6023-3763_s1770x1032.jpg?995079331d2f691f725a93b64b17f05be8dac61f", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
