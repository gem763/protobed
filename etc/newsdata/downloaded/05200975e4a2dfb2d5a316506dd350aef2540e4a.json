The vehicle had been out overnight collecting data and the image of a warship appeared in the first set of readings Sunday morning.\n\nTo confirm exactly which ship they've found the crew will deploy the AUV for another eight-hour mission where it will capture high-resolution sonar images of the site. The initial readings were captures using lower resolution sonar. The high-resolution scans will allow the crew to measure the ship and confirm its identity.\n\nThe find comes on the heels of the discovery of another Japanese carrier, the Kaga, last week.\n\nThe crew of the research vessel Petrel is hoping to find and survey all lost ships from the 1942 Battle of Midway, which historians consider a pivotal fight for the US in the Pacific during WWII.\n\nThe battle was fought between American and Japanese aircraft carriers and warplanes about 320km (200 miles) off Midway Atoll, a former military installation the Japanese hoped to capture in a surprise attack.\n\nThe United States, however, intercepted Japanese communications about the attack and were waiting when they arrived. More than 2,000 Japanese and 300 Americans died in the battle.\n\nThe expedition is an effort started by the late Paul Allen, the billionaire co-founder of Microsoft. For years, the crew of the 76-metre (250-foot) Petrel has worked with the US Navy and other officials around the world to locate and document sunken ships. It has found more than 30 vessels so far.", "description": "An autonomous underwater vehicle equipped with advanced sonar was used to locate the downed ship.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/21/1e260fe457ba47089501b681e081b095_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
