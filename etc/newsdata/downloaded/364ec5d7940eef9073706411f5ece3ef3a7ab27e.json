Government officials said Johnson's remarks were \"based on a briefing note from the Department for International Trade.\"\n\nIn the East End, they'll be having a real \"bubble\" (bubble bath = laugh) about it over a \"pig's ear\" (= beer) down the \"rub-a-dub\" (= pub). Of course, nobody actually talks like that, but it is common for Londoners to chuck a bit of rhyming slang when having a \"rabbit\" (rabbit and pork = talk), as Johnson knows \u2014 unless he's totally \"mutton\" (Mutt 'n Jeff = deaf).\n\nThe prime minister, who had a reputation for porkies in his earlier incarnation as a journalist, is unlikely to lose any \"bo-peep\" (= sleep) over it. After all, he's made a career out of talking \"Eartha\" (Eartha Kitt = I think you've got the hang of it by now).", "description": "Why the prime minister should get on the dog and bone to his Chinas before opening his north and south.", "authors": ["Stephen Brown", "Charlie Cooper"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-699197562-1200x628.jpg"}
