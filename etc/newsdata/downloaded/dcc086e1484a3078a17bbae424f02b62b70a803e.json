I\u2019ve added a super-gooey layer of bananas, pecans and chocolate, and with the addition of Baileys, this is definitely my new guilty pleasure. Just be really careful when using the blowtorch \u2014 when it lights the sugar, it can flare up unexpectedly and I don\u2019t want you singeing your eyebrows like Jonathan Ross almost did!\" - Jamie Oliver\n\nBanana & Baileys Bread & Butter Pud\n\nBy Jamie Oliver\n\nIngredients\n\n75g unsalted butter, plus extra for greasing, softened\n\n7 to 8 slices good-quality white bread\n\n100g golden caster sugar, plus 1 heaped tablespoon for sprinkling\n\n1 vanilla pod, halved lengthways and seeds scraped out\n\n4 large free-range eggs\n\n600ml double cream\n\n600ml semi-skimmed milk\n\n4 ripe bananas\n\n75g pecan nuts\n\nOptional:\n\n100g dark chocolate (70% cocoa solids)\n\n100ml Baileys\n\nPreparation\n\nPreheat the oven to 180\u00b0C/350\u00b0F/gas 4. Lightly butter the bread on one side, then cut each piece in half diagonally.\n\nWhisk the sugar, vanilla seeds and eggs together in a large bowl until well combined, then pour in the cream and milk and continue whisking until smooth. Peel and roughly slice the bananas, then roughly bash up the pecans and chocolate, if using.\n\nRub the inside of a baking dish (roughly 25cm x 30cm) with a little butter, then layer up the bread (butter-side up), bananas, pecans and chocolate, if using, finishing with a final layer of bread (again butter-side up). Drizzle over the Baileys and custardy mixture, then leave to stand for around 20 minutes, or until the bread begins to soak up the liquid.\n\nBake in the hot oven for around 35 minutes, or until set around the edges but still wobbly in the middle. Remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly, then serve as is, or sprinkle over the caster sugar and blast with a blowtorch to caramelize the top. Delicious served with good-quality vanilla ice cream.\n\nYield: Makes 8 servings\n\nThis recipe originally appeared on Jamie & Jimmy\u2019s Food Fight Club - Series 1: \u00a9 2012 Jamie Oliver.
