The Scottish Rugby Union has released a statement demanding the match be played under contingency plans.\n\nHagibis has been described by the Japanese Metrological Agency as \u201cviolent\u201d and has the capacity to cause widespread destruction around the Tokyo region.\n\nSatellite images of the extreme weather event displayed at World Rugby\u2019s press conference on Thursday reveal it is the size of Japan and shows no sign of deviating in its path or decreasing in magnitude.\n\nIt dwarfs Typhoon Faxai which brought Tokyo to a standstill for the day of England\u2019s arrival in Japan, delaying their exit from Narita Airport by six hours and leaving a million homes without power, killing three people and injuring scores more.\n\nA satellite photo of typhoon Hagibis is seen during a press briefing (Eugene Hoshiko/AP)\n\nWorld Cup tournament director Alan Gilpin stated that the governing body\u2019s hand was forced by the danger posed by the Category 5 super typhoon, which is on course to hit mainland in the early hours of Saturday.\n\n\u201cBased on this morning\u2019s advice, Hagibis is predicted to be the biggest of 2019 and highly likely to cause disruption in the Yokohama, Tokyo and Toyota area, including public transport shutdown,\u201d Gilpin said.\n\n\u201cAs a result of this independent advice, we have taken the difficult and right decision in the affected areas.\n\n\u201cAs you can imagine the decision has not been taken lightly and is in the best interest of safety as a priority.\n\nPA Graphics\n\n\u201cAll fans will receive full refunds. We are continuing to review Sunday\u2019s matches and making sure they are played as scheduled.\n\n\u201cAssessment will be made after the typhoon has passed. We are advising all fans in Toyota, Yokohama and Tokyo to stay inside on Saturday.\n\n\u201cWe looked pretty exhaustively at all the options. Important to note is that where we are is in accordance with what we said we would do before the tournament.\n\n\u201cMoving teams round on this scale and being able to deliver safely the exit of 12 teams\u2026.we couldn\u2019t guarantee contingency plans consistently. If we can\u2019t do it for all, we can\u2019t do it for any.\u201d\n\n\"Today we have taken the very difficult decision to cancel two Rugby World Cup pool matches\"\n\n\n\nWorld Rugby COO and #RWC2019 Tournament Director Alan Gilpin gives an update regarding the predicted impact of Typhoon Hagibis on this weekend\u2019s pool matches at Rugby World Cup 2019. pic.twitter.com/YHns1B1iyS \u2014 Rugby World Cup (@rugbyworldcup) October 10, 2019\n\nThe first cancellation of a game in nine instalments of the World Cup was preceded by feverish planning but attempts to move games to Oita \u2013 the setting for England\u2019s quarter-final \u2013 proved logistically impossible.\n\nConfusion even reigned in the hours immediately before official confirmation with World Rugby stating the games had not been cancelled even as Eddie Jones made frantic plans to take his squad out of Tokyo.\n\nEngland are now heading to Miyazaki \u2013 the setting for their pre-tournament camp which is on the same island as Oita \u2013 knowing they and France had already qualified for the last eight.\n\n\u201cI think the Japanese have a saying \u2013 shogun-hi \u2013 we can\u2019t control it. It\u2019s not something you can control. This is the situation,\u201d Jones said.\n\nA satellite photograph of Typhoon Hagibis (NASA Worldview, Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) via AP)\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a wonderful World Cup. You can\u2019t help typhoons, we would all like to think we\u2019ve got the power above and beyond what\u2019s on the world at the moment, but we don\u2019t and these things happen and you just ride with it.\n\n\u201cWe are excited about the prospect of having great preparation for the quarter-final now.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got some leeway over the next three days and so we are off to Miyazaki for a short pre-season camp and then we are off to Oita.\n\n\u201cWho would have thought we would have two relatively easy games, one tough game and then two weeks to prepare for a quarter-final. So someone is smiling on us \u2013 the typhoon gods maybe?\u201d", "description": "New Zealand\u00b4s encounter against Italy in Toyota City has also been cancelled.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/07/wire-19526574-1570689218-880_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
