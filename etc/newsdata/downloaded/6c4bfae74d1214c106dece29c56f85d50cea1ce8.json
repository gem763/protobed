Photo: theestallion/Instagram\n\nNew York Fashion Week might seem to be all about clothes, but, really, it\u2019s a social event \u2014 not unlike back-to-school. There are new seating assignments and new cliques coalescing. The week may have ended on Wednesday night, but we\u2019ll never forget the friendships forged along the way. Like Megan Thee Stallion and Anna Wintour.\n\nThe two titans of industry crossed paths at the Coach spring 2020 show on Tuesday night. I don\u2019t think they were actually seated next to each other, but we commend Megan for gathering the courage to ask for a picture. (Or maybe it was her social-media manager, who deserves a raise either way.) Wintour must have known she was in the presence of greatness \u2014 look at that smile! Megan, meanwhile, looks slightly awkward, like she\u2019s posing for a first-day-of-school portrait. She shared the resulting image on Instagram with the caption \u201cHOT GIRL ANNA.\u201d An honor!\n\nAs many have pointed out, this photo has layers. \u201cAm I high or is this an actual real photograph of Megan Thee Stallion sitting next to Anna Wintour in a Naruto t-shirt,\u201d wrote one person on Twitter.\n\n\u201cLmfao Megan thee stallion wore a fucking Naruto shirt to meet one of the most prominent fashion icons,\u201d wrote another.\n\nAs my colleague Callie Beusman explained, Megan\u2019s perfect crop top, which has cuffed sleeves and hits just above her bra, features an image of the Sannin, or the Legendary Three Ninjas from the village of Konoha, who are hailed as three of the greatest shinobi of their time. They are characters from the popular manga series and anime Naruto, which tells the story of a young ninja who wants to gain the respect of his peers and become the leader of his own village. So, extremely relevant to Fashion Week.\n\nCoincidentally (or not), Megan Thee Stallion, who has expressed her love of anime before, was seated next to fellow Naruto superfan Michael B. Jordan, who was ALSO wearing merch from the show in the form of a Konoha village symbol patch. What does it mean?! Is Anna Wintour also a fan? All we know is that this seems to be the only fashion week clique worth joining.\n\nPhoto: Bennett Raglin/Getty Images", "description": "Fashion week has a way of bringing people together. Take Anna Wintour and Megan Thee Stallion, for example, who met at the spring 2020 Coach show. Megan and Michael B. Jordan also both wore Naruto merch front row.
