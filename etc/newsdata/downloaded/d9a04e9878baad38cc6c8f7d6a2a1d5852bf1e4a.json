Bernie Sanders said Tuesday that he will change the \"nature\" of his presidential campaign after suffering a heart attack.\n\nIn the wake of his health scare, some of Sanders' allies have argued that he should trim his relentless campaign schedule.\n\n\"We were doing, in some cases, five or six meetings a day, you know, three or four rallies,\" he told reporters staked out outside of his Burlington, Vt., home. \"I don't think I'm going to do that.\"\n\nBut, he added, \"I certainly intend to be actively campaigning\" and \"I don't know that there's anybody that did more rallies than we have done.\"\n\nSanders also said Tuesday that the heart attack that has briefly sidelined him from the campaign trail did not mean he would be moving up the timeline to release his medical records, telling reporters they would come out \u201cat the appropriate time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe always planned to release them and we have more medical records, obviously, now\u201d after the heart attack.\n\nLast week's heart attack, which Sanders' campaign disclosed nearly three days after announcing he\u2019d been hospitalized and received two stents to address a blockage in an artery, has thrust concerns about the age of Democrats\u2019 top presidential contenders out into the open.\n\nThe senator has vowed he\u2019ll be on stage for next week\u2019s Democratic debate, where his aides are betting he\u2019ll showcase his strength and resiliency. Until then, though, Sanders has canceled his campaign events, emerging from his house for periodic walks with his wife Jane as the cameras roll.\n\nBut his campaign\u2019s lack of transparency surrounding the episode has sparked a media backlash and reinvigorated worries about the trio of septuagenarians currently leading the race for the Democratic nomination, among which the 78-year-old Sanders is the oldest. His fellow White House hopefuls have faced similar calls to release their medical records, as did then-candidate Donald Trump during the 2016 race. Trump, who is 73, has shown a willingness to go after his rivals' perceived health problems, openly questioning his opponents' mental fortitude and fitness for office even as the president's critics have wielded the same accusations against him.\n\nSanders insisted Tuesday that he was \u201cfeeling good\u201d and \u201cgetting stronger,\u201d but dismissed concerns that his health would worsen his already existing campaign struggles.\n\nSanders admitted he\u2019d erred in failing to listen to his body while on the campaign trail, but said he wants to turn the health scare into a teachable moment.\n\n\u201cI must confess that I was dumb,\u201d he said, explaining that he felt lucky to have been born with \u201ca lot of energy.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd during this campaign, I've been doing some cases three or four rallies a day running all over the state, Iowa, New Hampshire, wherever. And yet I, in the last month or two, just was more fatigued than I usually have been,\u201d he continued. \u201cI should have listened to those symptoms.\u201d\n\nHe concluded: \u201cSo if there's any message that I hope we can get out there is that I want people to pay attention to the symptoms. When you\u2019re hurting, when you\u2019re fatigued, when you have pain in your chest, listen to it.\u201d", "description": "Sen.
