For Stokes, another to sit in this elite bracket, Archer is worth it.\n\nEngland\u2019s Test vice-captain said: \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen a more talented bowler in my time. It\u2019s great to have him on your team. No doubt he is the sort of guy who can help get those Ashes back when we go down under [in 2021-22]. He\u2019s got experience in that part of the world from playing in the Big Bash too, so he\u2019ll feel comfortable going there and performing.\n\n\u201cWhen you can bowl 90mph and with the control that he\u2019s got, then he is going to be a huge threat anywhere in the world.\u201d\n\nPlay Video 2:55 Ashes: Joe Root on Steve Smith, Jofra Archer and the tied series \u2013 video\n\nStokes compared Archer to Australia\u2019s Pat Cummins, who consolidated his place as the No 1-ranked Test bowler with 29 victims in the series. But beyond the potent combination of pace and accuracy, it is the newcomer\u2019s attitude that has impressed so many in the England set-up.\n\n\u201cIt is very rare for a 24-year-old to be able to come in, be exposed to this environment and then step up and improve game by game as quickly as Jof is doing it,\u201d added Stokes. \u201cThere is plenty more to come from him because he is so skilful and picks things up so quickly.\u201d\n\nFive steps England must take to regain the Ashes in 2020-21 | Rob Smyth Read more\n\nArcher will now be due a break and is planning to visit family in Barbados. His next England assignment is the New Zealand tour that departs in late October, although there are thoughts of extending the rest period for the multi-format players into the five-match Twenty20 series before returning to full strength for the two Tests that follow.\n\nThe selectors and the Test captain, Joe Root, convene at the start of next week, with Giles expected to take a seat on the panel in a temporary capacity while the search for a new head coach is stepped up. Stokes, who struck up a strong bond with the now departed Trevor Bayliss, appears wary of change.\n\nThe all-rounder, speaking after England\u2019s 185-run win at the Oval, said: \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m looking forward to life without Trevor in the dressing room because he\u2019s been an amazing person to have around over the last four years.\n\n\u201cHe obviously got brought in to do a job with our one-day cricket but he\u2019s had a massive influence on this group of Test cricketers too. I\u2019m glad that we managed to win this last game for him. There were a lot of things that we were playing for out there: Trev was one of them.\u201d\n\nPlay Video 0:51 Jofra Archer says Steve Smith 'didn't look as nailed on as usual' \u2013 video\n\nGiles must decide whether to seek continuity in the set-up by promoting either Graham Thorpe or Chris Silverwood \u2013 the respective batting and bowling coaches are expected to apply \u2013 or look for an external candidate who plots a new course in Test cricket.\n\nThough next year\u2019s T20 World Cup in Australia is high on the list of priorities, the white-ball side will be a secondary consideration as regards the new head coach; not least since Eoin Morgan, its all-powerful captain, is expected to recommit to his role and be among the list of central contracts for the next 12 months.\n\nAshes report cards: grading every England and Australia player Read more\n\nLike Root, Stokes left the Oval believing a workable formula for the Test side had been stumbled upon, even if this owed much to his own role as a specialist batsman following a shoulder injury. He praised Rory Burns and Joe Denly for their work at the top of the order, while Stuart Broad\u2019s 23-wicket series was another success.\n\nOn the 33-year-old, Stokes said: \u201cI think he\u2019s shown here that he\u2019s nowhere near done. He has been heroic and we\u2019ve all been impressed by his skill. The fact their opening partnership has gone nowhere is largely down to Broady.\u201d\n\nThe last point was not lost on Justin Langer, Australia\u2019s head coach, who backed David Warner to hold his place in the Test side for their home summer series against Pakistan and New Zealand despite scoring only 95 runs from 10 innings \u2013 a record low by an opener in one series \u2013 and falling to Broad seven times.\n\nLanger said: \u201cI think, talking frankly, he let Stuart Broad get into his head and he thought way too much about it. He\u2019ll probably be very relieved when he gets on the flight and doesn\u2019t have to face him for a while.\u201d", "description": "\u2018I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen a more talented bowler,\u2019 said Ben Stokes after Jofra Archer took 22 wickets in his first four Tests for England", "authors": ["Ali Martin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4aec47aab80d108e66db44eee3c593896c255e56/0_103_3400_2040/master/3400.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=69e14a087f0878b8a9e089fd5e2b66f6", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
