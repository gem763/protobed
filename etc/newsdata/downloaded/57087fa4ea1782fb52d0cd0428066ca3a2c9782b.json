It\u2019s not an issue that gets a lot of attention in news about the country\u2019s economic health, but it\u2019s common: More than one-third (34%) of households experienced a 25% or more change in income year-to-year between 2014 and 2015, according to an analysis by the Pew Charitable Trusts, a Philadelphia-based think tank.\n\n\u201cWhen we think about how the economy is doing broadly, there are big topline numbers we see, whether it\u2019s GDP or the unemployment rate, that may not explain what\u2019s happening at the household level,\u201d said Clinton Key, a research officer at Pew. \u201cThere\u2019s one economy we all share and there\u2019s also 160 million household economies \u2014 and they don\u2019t all go in the same direction.\u201d\n\nIncome volatility has been a constant for many households in recent years. Between 2013 and 2018, the average family experienced significant income swings \u2014 spikes or dips of more than 25 percent of their median income \u2014 in five months out of the year, despite real wage growth and low unemployment during that period, a new analysis by the JPMorgan Chase Institute found.\n\nThe JPMorgan Chase Institute looked at six million anonymized accounts for its analysis. Researchers found that families need roughly six weeks of take-home income in cash savings to withstand a simultaneous drop in income and jump in expenses, but 65% of families don\u2019t have enough cash to do so.\n\nIt\u2019s an issue for both rich and poor\n\nIncome volatility affects households at all income levels and reaches across demographic groups. And it can mean both a sudden loss of income for poor families or an infusion of cash for wealthier ones, who may take on extra work to pay for a specific expense like a vacation, Key said.\n\nBut surprisingly, both scenarios are linked to reduced financial well-being, Key said. Families whose incomes swung up or down by more than 25% in a year were more likely to report financial shortfalls such as missing a rent payment or utility bill, or overdrawing a checking account, Key said.\n\nResidents of households who don\u2019t know or aren\u2019t confident what their paycheck might be six months or a year from now are in a difficult position trying to figure out what they can spend today, Key said.\n\nIt makes it hard to follow conventional finance advice\n\nFamilies with unpredictable income streams will often find it difficult to follow traditional advice on financial decisions, such as how much house they can afford, Key said. Housing affordability calculators, for example, presume a steady income.\n\n\u201cPeople lock in prices very long term, both for buying and for renting, but under conditions of volatility, it\u2019s very difficult for people to know how much they can afford a year from now,\u201d Key said.\n\nFamilies with fluctuating incomes can also face problems getting public benefits such as food stamps, because eligibility is often determined by the family\u2019s income over the previous three months \u2014 but that may not reflect what they\u2019ll be making later in the year.\n\nStability is something families crave more than upward mobility, Pew found. Among 7,845 respondents in a 2014 survey, 90% said they\u2019d rather have a steady income than upward mobility.\n\nSee also: Here\u2019s the really bad news: Only half of Americans actually own stocks\n\nThe gig economy plays a role\n\nIncome swings have grown more extreme since the 1970s, according to a study by the Brookings Institution, a liberal-leaning Washington D.C. think tank. Volatility can be caused by layoffs, illness, or irregular work schedules. The rise of the gig economy has played a role. \u201cDisruptions seem to have become more common over time as employers increasingly demand flexible labor and as the on-demand economy has grown,\u201d researchers at the Aspen Institute said in a 2016 report.\n\nLawmakers in some states have moved to create more stable work schedules for low-income workers by enacting laws that require employers to keep workers informed in advance about their hours. Walmart recently introduced payday advances for its employees, which some considered a response to its largely low-income workforce\u2019s up-and-down incomes.\n\nHousehold volatility affects the entire economy\n\nUnpredictable incomes in individual families have ripple effects for the overall economy, a 2018 report by the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a left-leaning research center, concluded. \u201cFor most families, a stable income is important to maintaining stable levels of household consumption,\u201d the authors wrote. The researchers noted that consumption of nondurable goods such as food and clothing drops by 6% right after workers lose their jobs, then stabilizes at that level while they\u2019re receiving unemployment insurance, and falls by 13% after unemployment benefits run out. \u201cHousehold economic insecurity may have lasting consequences on broad economic growth and stability,\u201d the authors wrote.\n\nIt takes a toll at tax season\n\nWhen families can\u2019t predict their income, they also have a hard time estimating how much of a tax refund they\u2019ll get, or whether they\u2019ll qualify for tax breaks like the earned income tax credit, according to a 2017 study by the Washington, D.C.-based Tax Policy Center.\n\nIn some cases, that means families will get the happy surprise of a bigger-than-expected earned income tax credit, TPC researchers found. But sometimes the surprise is less welcome. \u201cIn other cases, a family might anticipate receiving a large credit from their return and receive no credit or a smaller credit, researchers wrote. \u201cBecause families tend to plan how they will spend their refund, not receiving the anticipated refund could disrupt the household. For example, they might be opting to delay medical care or a car repair.\u201d\n\nThis story was updated on Oct. 24, 2019.", "description": "Stock market volatility makes the news, but it\u2019s unpredictable income that affects many families.", "authors": ["Leslie Albrecht", "Personal Finance Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR119_family_MG_20190911133116.jpg", "published_at": "2018-02-16"}
