As a result, she wastes little time in giving him a piece of her mind in regards to his absence during a time when his daughter needed him the most.\n\nOf course, Sonia has no idea of what\u2019s transpired with the Mitchells \u2014 which is the very reason Martin left Walford in the first place \u2014 so the nurse\u2019s harsh words put him in a bit of a predicament as he cannot reveal the truth.\n\nLater, Kush (Davood Ghadami) argues that Martin leaving the Square once again would be in everyone\u2019s best interests, as he can\u2019t risk being seen by Ben (Max Bowden). However, upon learning that her ex-husband is planning to depart once more, Sonia urges him to stay put for their daughter\u2019s sake.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFeeling guilty, Martin returns to the Square with Bex in tow, and \u2014 after a heart-to-heart between the father and daughter \u2014 he ultimately agrees to stay.\n\nHowever Ben laters spies him from across the Square. As a result, Martin confronts the Mitchell lad and pleads with him to let Stacey come home.\n\nWhat will Ben have to say?\n\nBen loves having a bit of leverage on others, that\u2019s for sure, but given that he\u2019s been through so much since Martin was last in Albert Square, perhaps he\u2019ll see things in a whole new light?\n\nOne to watch: Monday 7th October at 8pm on BBC One.\n\nNeed support?
