He's doing really well.\n\n\"We've always had a good connection in the way that we were both trying to manage the band together.\n\n(Image: Brian J Ritchie/Hotsauce/REX)\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n\"And that's followed into life, and obviously he has been through a hell of a lot.\n\n\"So I've tried to be there for him as much as possible, and so does he me.\"\n\nThe pair are both dads to young children too - Liam shares two-year-old Bear with ex Cheryl , and Louis has three-year-old Freddie with his ex Briana Jungwirth, a former stylist.\n\n(Image: Brian J Ritchie/Hotsauce/REX)\n\n(Image: Splash)\n\nBut Liam has previously confessed that at the start of the band's career, he \"absolutely hated\" Louis, and they endured a power struggle where they both wanted to \"be the leader\".\n\nLiam explained that dealing with the pressure that comes with immense fame being thrust upon you was made easier at the time by his band mates.\n\n\"There were five of us that knew how each other were feeling. It's harder by yourself\", he said.\n\nHe compared this to Justin Bieber, 25, who shot to international stardom on his own at age 13.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nOne Direction and Bieber famously had an ongoing feud that kicked off in 2015, and Liam revealed he put the fight to bed after confronting Justin about it.\n\n\"Me and Justin had a really long chat once in his trailer\", he said.\n\n\"There had been 1D and Justin Bieber beef at the time.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n\"I went in to say to him: 'It's all good. You don't need to do whatever'.\n\n\"And then we had a really long chat, and he's a really nice kid.\"\n\nLiam said there was \"definitely\" competition between him and the other 1D members as they battle it out in the charts with their solo material.\n\nBut he confessed he rates his song writing ability, adding that he wrote half of all of One Direction's albums, which has helped him in writing his own songs.\n\n(Image: 2014 Getty Images)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nLiam also appeared on The Jonathan Ross Show on ITV last night, where he devastated hardcore 1D fans by saying a reunion was unlikely to happen soon - especially one involving Zayn Malik, who he said left on bad terms.\n\nTalking about his relationship with the rest of the former members, he said: \u201cI speak to Niall [Horan] every so often.\n\n\"I haven\u2019t spoken to Harry [Styles] in a long time now.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"Zayn left so I haven\u2019t seen him since then\u2026 I always feel like Zayn didn\u2019t really feel being there, if that makes sense.\n\n\"We all had a good time, there were moments when it was absolute bliss but then obviously there were moments where it was like, \u2018This is awful.\u2019\n\n\"For him I just think there were more moments where he didn\u2019t really enjoy what he was doing. Fair play to him, he went off and did his own thing and he\u2019s doing really well.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Liam Payne spoke exclusively to MirrorOnline about looking after grieving Louis Tomlinson, and the time he confronted Justin Bieber about their feud", "authors": ["Verity Sulway", "Image", "Brian J Ritchie Hotsauce Rex", "Instagram", "Splash", "Getty Images", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20717321.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_EMB-The-Jonathan-Ross-Show-TV-show-Series-15-Episode-7-London-UK-26-Oct-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
