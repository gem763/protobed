Some industry funds - such as AustralianSuper, which is conducting buyouts in its own right - are growing at a rapid pace, a trend that started before the banking royal commission but has accelerated since.\n\nUnlike retail funds, which are bleeding members, the big industry funds have the welcome challenge of finding enough good investment prospects to match massive inflows.\n\nAs a mid-market focused business, IFM has tended to write cheques of less than $100 million, which is reminiscent of traditional private equity.\n\n\u201cBut what we\u2019re doing now is a new sector of the market requiring a different type of expertise and large scale could mean anything north of $200 million, but could well be in the billions,\" Mr Odgers said.\n\n\u201cWe're trying to be agnostic as to where those assets sit today. They could be publicly listed, they could be family owned, they could be owned by PE today. They could be some combination of all of those things.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEx-Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation executive Adrian Kerley, another new recruit, said IMF\u2019s long-term approach meant the pay packets of the chief executives of acquired businesses would be aligned with generating retirement savings for working Australians.\n\n\u201cThe issue with the listed market is short-termism,\u201d he said. \u201c[We] can take a longer term view on things like ESG [environmental, social and governance issues] and building sustainable businesses.\"\n\nMr Kerley said IFM had a strong track record in infrastructure and would apply that know-how to acquiring businesses with good long-term growth prospects.\n\nIFM had previously invested in monopoly infrastructure assets but would now look to operating businesses, a good example being data centres, he said.\n\n\u201cThis is probably a bit more risky and the returns will be higher in so far as these will be operating businesses rather than asset-backed businesses like airports and toll roads,\u201d Mr Kerley said.\n\n\u201cA data centre is a good example of a transaction that sits between private equity and infrastructure.\u201d\n\nOf IFM\u2019s $152.4 billion in funds under management, the largest allocations are to debt investments and listed equites, with $45 billion invested in each asset class. Another $61.7 billion is in infrastructure and $1.4 billion in private equity.\n\nMr Kerley said there is no target for how much IFM would like to invest in private equity.", "description": "IFM is eyeing assets such as data centres and technology businesses with valuations north of $200 million.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.5705%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_1624%2C$y_754/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/651aaafceff995b361f8e2670cb5b83733110dd1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
