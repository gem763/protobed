She called him \"obsessed\" for mocking her email scandal and said she could beat Trump in an electoral rematch, if she ever decided to jump back in.\n\n\"It truly is remarkable how obsessed he remains with me,\" she said. \"But this latest tweet is so typical of him. Nothing has been more examined and looked at than my emails. We all know that. So he's either lying or delusional or both.\n\n\"So maybe there does need to be a rematch,\" Clinton added. \"Obviously, I can beat him again. But, just seriously, I don't understand, I don't think anybody understands what motivates him, other than personal grievance, other than seeking adulation.\"\n\nCLINTON CALLS FOR CAUTION ON IMPEACHMENT, TELLS DEMOCRATS NOT TO 'JUMP TO ANY CONCLUSIONS'\n\nClinton, who defeated Trump in the popular vote in 2016, also responded to the challenge on Twitter after Trump called her out by name, suggesting she try to steal the nomination away from Sen.

What you saw was what you were going to get,\" Clinton said.\n\n\"I think a lot of Americans understandably thought, 'Oh, no, come on. That can't possibly be the case. Once he's in the office, he will certainly moderate his behavior.' Well, we've seen, no, he hasn't.\"", "description": "Former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton could beat President Trump \"again\" if she decided to run for president in 2020, according to statements she made during a Tuesday interview with PBS News Hour.", "authors": ["Nick Givas", "Nick Givas Is A Reporter With Fox News.
