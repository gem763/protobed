The longtime Pittsburgh Penguins centre might as well have been talking about his team.\n\n\"I want to show to everyone I'm not done,\" Malkin said. \"(I want to show) everything \u2014 power skating, stickhandling, scoring, play in the D zone, faceoffs. I just want to come back at my top level for sure.\"\n\nSomething the dynamic Russian wasn't at a year ago. His 21 goals marked a career-low in a season in which he played at least 50 games. His 51 assists looked great on paper, but his inattentive defensive play at times made him something he's never been during his long partnership with star Sidney Crosby: a liability.\n\nMalkin certainly looked a step slow during Pittsburgh's first-round sweep at the hands of the New York Islanders. He was hardly the only one. The Penguins were outclassed, outskated and outworked over the course of four games, leaving Penguins general manager Jim Rutherford hinting at the necessity of a culture change heading into the franchise's longest off-season since 2006, the year before Malkin arrived.\n\nUltimately Rutherford opted to make only modest adjustments, the most notable sending productive but mercurial forward Phil Kessel to Arizona for Alex Galchenyuk, trading soft-spoken defenceman Olli Maatta to Chicago for Dominik Kahun and signing winger Brandon Tanev to a six-year deal in free agency.\n\nMalkin's linemate, Phil Kessel, was dealt to Arizona in the off-season.

It would certainly help matters if veterans like Malkin follow suit. The 33-year-old shed some weight in the off-season and understands he's much closer to the end of his career than the beginning. That realization has brought Malkin a welcome sense of urgency.\n\n\"We have a great team,\" Malkin said. \"We have a couple, maybe two, three, four chances to win again. Maybe not many (more) years that I'll play in the NHL. I understand that. I want to just have fun and enjoy it every day.\"\n\nSullivan and Rutherford both chastised their more established players \u2014 without naming names \u2014 in April for losing some of the edge that carried them to championships. Rather than blowing it up, they opted instead for to hold on to Malkin and defenceman Kris Letang, whose high-risk, high-reward style cost Pittsburgh in the playoffs. Both players are in their 30s. Both are among the best at their position when they're at their best. The key is finding a way to make that happen more consistently over the 82-game grind.\n\n\"I think this team is capable of doing some real good things,\" Sullivan said. \"But we have to earn it every day. It's not inevitable. There's a nice feeling around the team. I think everyone is excited about the opportunity and possibilities that we have.\"\n\nIf not, the cosmetic changes the roster underwent in the off-season could be significantly more substantial next summer.", "description": "Evgeni Malkin admits he needs to be better if he and his Pittsburgh Penguins are to regain their perennial perch as a Stanley Cup contender.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5294236.1569262991!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/islanders-penguins-hockey.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
