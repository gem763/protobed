Mr Erdo\u011fan is due to visit the White House to meet Donald Trump in two weeks\u2019 time but it is unclear whether the visit will go ahead.\n\nWhile Mr Trump continues to insist the country is a close American ally, members of Congress are intent on punishing Turkey for its actions in Syria. There is also widespread anger in Turkey over US support for Kurdish fighters who most Turks see as terrorists.\n\nMeanwhile, it emerged that a Kurdish-recruited spy who helped the US track down Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi may be in line for the $25 million (\u00a319.4 million) bounty the American government placed on the Islamic State leader\u2019s head.", "description": "Turkey summoned the US ambassador on Wednesday in protest at votes in Congress to recognise the Turkish genocide against Armenians and to sanction Ankara for its military offensive in northeast Syria.", "authors": ["Raf Sanchez", "Middle East Correspondent", "Tom Harwood", "Zoe Strimpel", "Lucy Denyer", "Michael Hogan", "Janet Daley"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/07/TELEMMGLPICT000212272523-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BquOv8qdqAtg5F-Rc30df4dV0OI3FPms-8Oe3WrK_n1FQ.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
