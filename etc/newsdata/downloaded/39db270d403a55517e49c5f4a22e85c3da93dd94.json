But he relented after Republican allies convinced him to look beyond his pocketbook concern, he said.\n\n\u201cI gave the money because [Sen.] Rob Portman and others called me and asked. But I don\u2019t like to be the sucker. And European countries are helped far more than we are, and those countries should pay more to help Ukraine,\u201d Mr. Trump said at a press conference with Finnish President Sauli Niinisto.\n\nSo far, his story is holding up.\n\nMr. Portman, co-chairman of the Senate Ukraine Caucus, says the conversation in question occurred Sept. 11 and that former Vice President Joseph R. Biden didn\u2019t come up. Nor did former New York City mayor and Trump lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, cited by a whistleblower as a \u201ccentral figure\u201d in Mr. Trump\u2019s alleged efforts to get foreign nations to investigate his 2020 Democratic rival.\n\n\u201cRob has long been Ukraine\u2019s staunchest supporter as it works to combat Russian aggression and strengthen its democracy. He has continually advocated for and helped secure the security assistance they need, and when there was a hold on the funds, he acted to ensure they were released,\u201d said Portman spokeswoman Emily Benavides. \u201cAt no time during his work advocating for Ukraine did the former vice president or former mayor of New York come up. Rob is the one who helped secure the release of the bipartisan-agreed upon money, which the president confirmed yesterday.\u201d\n\nThe money, which had been frozen for weeks, was released the day after the Portman-Trump call with $141 million more in State Department assistance, thrilling Ukraine supporters in Congress but leaving questions about the delay.\n\nAlthough the aid package, which includes lethal weapons, such as Javelin anti-tank missiles, was previously approved by Congress, the White House unexpectedly ordered Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and then-National Security Adviser John R. Bolton to review the program earlier this year. The Pentagon determined the package was in the U.S. national interest, so Democrats say there has to be more to the story.\n\nMr. Trump put a hold on the aid package in early to midsummer with little explanation. While in limbo, Mr. Trump held his infamous call with the Ukrainian TV comedian-turned-politician in which he asked Mr. Zelensky to look into Mr. Biden and his son Hunter, who had business ties in Ukraine.\n\nMr. Trump also queried about the location of a hacked Democratic National Committee hacked server from 2016, couching it as a \u201cfavor.\u201d\n\nWhile the president noted all the support the U.S. gives Ukraine, there wasn\u2019t an explicit quid pro quo involving the aid money on the call, prompting cries of a \u201cnothingburger\u201d from Mr. Trump\u2019s allies.\n\nWhether Democrats can prove that Mr. Trump was holding out on Ukraine to gather dirt on the Bidens may determine whether the House Democrats\u2019 impeachment drive sputters or turns into a full-boiled scandal that forces Republicans to bail on Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cThe aid piece is important to the impeachment debate because it relates to U.S. support of an important ally and whether Trump used Ukraine\u2019s need for military assistance to extort help with the Biden probe,\u201d said Darrell West, director of governance studies at the Brookings Institution. \u201cIt turns what is a major violation into an impeachable offense. The use of military assistance for partisan political purposes elevates Trump wrongdoing to a much higher level.\u201d\n\nSeven freshmen House Democrats with national security backgrounds have labeled it an \u201cimpeachable offense\u201d if Mr. Trump did withhold military aid to Ukraine to try to get the country to dig up dirt on his political opponent.\n\nSen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has called the White House\u2019s decision to release held-up aid to Ukraine as the whistleblower issue surfaced \u201cincredibly suspicious.\u201d\n\nWithin two days of the aid release, House intelligence committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff issued a subpoena for acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, saying the information of the July 25 phone call was being inappropriately withheld.\n\nMr. Maguire said it was not released because of a specific interpretation of the law, which says that because the complaint involves the executive branch, the legislative branch does not have jurisdiction over the matter.\n\nMr. Biden, meanwhile, says he won\u2019t let allegations of corruption against him and his family deter his quest for the 2020 Democratic nomination. He is echoing House Democrats who believe Mr. Trump tried to \u201cextort the existential fears of Ukraine\u2019s leaders for political advantage.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow we know that he may have held up political support and vitally needed aid appropriated by Congress to pressure Ukraine to give-in to his political demands,\u201d Mr. Biden said in Reno, Nevada.\n\nThe former vice president said that \u201cabuse of power is the defining characteristic of the Trump presidency\u201d and that he stands behind House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\n\nNo president in modern history has been the target of impeachment in his first term heading into a reelection campaign. President Bill Clinton was impeached in his second term by the House but not removed from office by the Senate.\n\nPresident Richard Nixon resigned in his second term while facing certain impeachment. Impeachment is the equivalent of a political indictment and can be approved with a majority vote in the House. If articles of impeachment are approved, then the Senate holds a trial. It takes a two-thirds vote in the Senate to convict and remove the president.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
