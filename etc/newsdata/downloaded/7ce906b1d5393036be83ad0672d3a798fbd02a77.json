We haven't been mentioning anything about it, the players haven't even thought about it,\" he told AAP.\n\n\"This is nothing, this is great. The pitch will be good and nice stadium ... we don't have any of those excuses.\"\n\nAustralia left Canberra with a sense of frustration despite a five-goal winning margin with several opportunities missed to extend the scoreline.\n\nAgainst the world No.129 Taiwanese, replicating the 8-0 scoreline from the two nations' most recent meeting in 2012 would appear to be a bare minimum for Arnold.\n\n\"Archie (Thompson) scored 13 goals in one game but he wasn't happy after one or two or three. He kept going and that's what it's about,\" Arnold said.\n\n\"I saw that from Jamie (Maclaren) the other night. You can see that from players who are really believing in what we're doing.\n\n\"I really feel that we're on the right path. Things are going well and the most important thing is the environment's great and the boys are happy and relaxed.\"\n\nArnold is expected to make slight changes to his starting XI from the team that defeated Nepal.\n\nHat-trick hero Jamie Maclaren may sit out for Adam Taggart while seven other players who didn't feature on Thursday will be pushing their claims.\n\n\"There will be changes. A couple of changes,\" Arnold said.\n\n\"We only played a few days ago back in Canberra and the boys have pulled up really, really well.\n\n\"There's some boys who want to show and this is an opportunity for those boys to show me really what they've got and show the country what they've got.\"", "description": "Australia coach Graham Arnold says the Socceroos should expect to claim a convincing win in Tuesday's World Cup qualifier against Taiwan.The Socceroos...", "authors": ["Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
