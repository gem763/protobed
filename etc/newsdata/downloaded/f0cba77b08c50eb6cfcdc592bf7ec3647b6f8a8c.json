Drama first cropped up when fans who purchased the palette claimed it was poorer quality than what de Jager's own swatches and reveal suggested.\n\nThen, in 2017, as Star embarked on a public feud with Too Faced CEO Jeremy Johnson. Johnson suggested that other brands were ripping off a \"unicorn makeup\" trend he started, and Star responded to say that the \"unicorn\" trend started before Too Faced capitalized on it. Star also revealed that Johnson had underpaid de Jager.\n\nAt the time, speculation ran wild from anonymous sources that said de Jager only made between $40,000 and $60,000 on the product, which had sold at least 150,000 units \u2013 netting over $8 million.\n\nStar revived the old drama in his latest video with Shane Dawson, causing de Jager to respond again to his accusations on Twitter\n\nNikkie de Jager (L) teaches a Masterclass at SEPHORiA: House of Beauty \u2013 Day One at The Shrine Auditorium on September 07, 2019 in Los Angeles, California.

Star predicts that Dawson could make $5 million from the collaboration.\n\nHe goes on to explain that other makeup brands have been less than fair with YouTubers who create and market makeup collaborations. Star's example is Nikkie Tutorials, who he says made a $50,000 flat fee from her Too Faced palette and bundled products, called the \"The Too Faced Power of Makeup by Nikkie Tutorials Collaboration.\"\n\n\"I've seen YouTubers and other influencers take dirt because they didn't know,\" Star said, noting that everything he revealed in Dawson's video was already on the record \u2013 when the controversy first emerged, anonymous sources confirmed to drama YouTuber Sanders Kennedy that de Jager only made between $40,000 and $60,000.\n\n\"When she told me, I was so horrified,\" Star continued on to say in the video. \"And when I kind of let that secret out it turned really ugly.\"\n\nRead more: Shane Dawson and Jeffree Star have yet to prove that their 9-part 'documentary' is more than just an advertisement\n\nDawson's video already has almost 12 million views and is the top trending video on the platform. De Jager responded to the rehashing of her Too Faced collaboration on Twitter on Saturday, calling herself \"naive\" for signing the contract \u2013 and suggesting that the real drama at play involved Too Faced changing the quality of the product without her knowledge.\n\n\"I signed my contract with TF back then because I was naive & didn't know better,\" de Jager wrote on Twitter. \"At the end of the day, I signed it, it's my own fault \u2013 but what I'll never forgive is that 'allegedly' they changed the palette's quality behind my back. 1000's of negative reviews & I was clueless.\"\n\nShe went on to say, \"I had to see all these negative reviews, while the palettes I had were outstanding. 'they lying in their videos to get views' is what I was told. I don't care about the money.. but I had to fight YEARS to prove my authenticity and gain your trust again.\"\n\nNeither Too Faced, its parent company Est\u00e9e Lauder, or de Jager immediately responded to Insider's request for comment.", "description": "Nikkie Tutorials responds to a new Shane Dawson and Jeffree Star documentary that says she only made $50k from her Too Faced palette collaboration.", "authors": ["Kat Tenbarge"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d99ff83695b5816896249c0?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
