Now What?\n\nEnlarge this image Lindsey Balbierz for NPR Lindsey Balbierz for NPR\n\nThe first year of college is crucial for setting students up for success, laying a strong foundation for the rest of college and beyond. Research shows that if you finish your first year and sign up for the second, you're far more likely to get that degree.\n\nExplore Life Kit This story comes from Life Kit, NPR's family of podcasts to help make life better \u2014 covering everything from exercise to raising kids to making friends. For more, sign up for the newsletter and follow @NPRLifeKit on Twitter.\n\nSo how do you get through the first year? Here's what the experts recommend.\n\nGo to college on purpose.\n\nGoing to college takes time and money. Simply going because everyone told you to \u2014 without a clear end game \u2014 puts you more at risk of having just some college and no degree.\n\n\"Don't just go to college because your school counselor or your parents told you to go,\" says Yolanda Watson Spiva, who runs the non-profit organization Complete College America. \"You actually go to college because you have an agenda.\"\n\nPick your classes wisely and map out your path.\n\nSome of this is really basic. For example, if you know you need 120 credits to graduate \u2014 do the math. How many credits will you need each semester if you want to finish in four years? The answer: 15 credits. If you're not taking a full course load \u2014 that may mean extra classes over the summer \u2014 or a longer timeline.\n\nThe best way to make sure you get this right is to meet with an adviser \u2014 which leads us to the next takeaway:\n\nMake a connection with a faculty or staff member.\n\nIt can be an adviser, a librarian, a financial aid officer, even an admissions counselor. Anyone connected with the college who you can lean on to learn the ropes of the institution.\n\nResearch has shown that having one strong connection with an adult \u2014 staff or faculty \u2014 can make you feel engaged and supported throughout college. They can also result in strategic career advice and networking opportunities.\n\nGo to your professors' office hours.\n\nWe've heard from students all over the country, and so many agree: Office hours are terrifying.\n\nRick Lopez, dean of new students at Amherst College, was once a terrified freshman, too.\n\n\"Everyone from almost every background has that fear that they got in here by accident, and that if you go in and talk to your professor, that's more and more possibility for them to discover that you're actually an idiot who got in by accident,\" he says. \"That's scary.\"\n\nWhen Lopez was struggling in a class freshman year, he went to the professor's office. He told her, \"This is my experience, and I have never learned any of this stuff.\" His vulnerability was rewarded: The two of them became close, and the professor eventually became his mentor.\n\nSo what do you talk about when you go? You can bring an assignment you're struggling with, ask what's on an upcoming exam. You might be able to get an extension on a paper.\n\nYou can also talk about stuff that's unrelated to your class.\n\nFind a group of friends who support you.\n\nCollege is full of opportunities to meet people. Start with your classes \u2014 work on assignments together or form a study group. Join clubs and organizations \u2014 let the organizational framework of those meetings ease the awkwardness of scheduling a first friend date.\n\nDon't beat yourself up, though, if it doesn't happen right away.\n\nYou could think, 'I'm never going to have a friend. Everyone said that college is where you're supposed to meet your best friend. I can't meet my best friend and I'm struggling in chemistry!' \" Lopez says. \"Keep reaching out. Keep taking that risk if someone else says hi reciprocate.\"\n\nBe your own advocate \u2014 remember, you are the customer!\n\nEven if you're paying with loans or a scholarship, you are paying to be a college student, so make the school work for you.\n\n\"College is not meant to be done on your own,\" says Odette De Leon, an adviser at Valencia College, a community college in Orlando. \"We're supposed to do this together. The institution is there to serve the student.\"", "description": "Congratulations! You've been accepted into college.
