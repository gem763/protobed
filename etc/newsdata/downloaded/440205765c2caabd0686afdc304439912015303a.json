Museum\u2014the truth is representation of female artists in the art world has barely budged.\n\nA comprehensive study published this week by artnet News and the online art analysis site In Other Words titled \u201cWomen\u2019s Place in the Art World: Why Recent Advancements for Female Artists Are Largely an Illusion,\u201d found some glimmer of hope in auction results, where the market for art by women has doubled in the past 10 years.\n\nBut, the researchers point out, the nearly 6,000 female artists whose work was sold from 2008 through May 2019 totaled US$4 billion\u2014less than US$4.8 billion in total sales fetched by Pablo Picasso \u2019s works alone.\n\nOverall, that US$4 billion is just 2% of the nearly US$197 billion in art sold in that period, according to the study. The researchers drew from sales recorded in the artnet Price Database.\n\n\u201cThere is a perception that more is happening than is evident in the data,\u201d says Charlotte Burns, executive editor of In Other Words, which is part of Art Agency, Partners, an independent fine art advisory unit within Sotheby\u2019s.\n\nartnet News and In Other Words from Women's Place in the Art World: Why Recent Advancements for Female Artists Are Largely an Illusion\n\nThe story is also bleak for women within art institutions. The study examined 26 museums ranging from major institutions like The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York to those connected with universities, like the Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University, Durham, North Carolina.\n\nThe conclusion: acquisitions of art by women represented only 11% of the total 260,470 acquisitions made from 2008 to 2018, and only 14% of exhibitions at these same institutions were by solo female artists or groups of female artists.\n\nIn an article drawn from the study, the authors note that Saville\u2019s Propped, 1992, may have achieved a new record for a living female artist when it sold for \u00a39.5 million (US$12.5 million) with fees at a Sotheby\u2019s auction in London in October 2018. But, they note, the record is less than 14% of the US$91.1 million Jeff Koons\u2019s Rabbit, 1986, fetched at a Christie\u2019s contemporary auction in May.\n\nThe study also details how the value of works by five female artists\u2014Yayoi Kusama, Joan Mitchell, Louise Bourgeois, Georgia O\u2019Keeffe, and Agnes Martin\u2014represent US$1.6 billion or 40.7% of the $4 billion in sales. Beyond these five, sales results drop off dramatically.\n\nBy contrast, sales of the top male artists account for only 8.7% of the nearly US$193 billion spent on works by men since 2008, the study found.\n\nThe authors also noted an academic study out of Oxford University that found wealthy men who care about art scored works that were said to be created by women lower than those created by men in a computer-generated study.\n\n\u201cThe unspoken thread running through all of this is bias,\u201d Burns says.\n\nThere are a few signs of change, however. The value of auction sales of art by women may represent a tiny fraction of the overall market, but sales have been steadily rising. And repeat auction sales of art by women in the last six years reveal a dramatic uptick in price compared to works by men, according to data in Sotheby\u2019s Mei Moses division.\n\nAlso, some major galleries are reporting higher sales by women. Three out of four major galleries, including Pace, David Zwirner, and Lisson, said their female artists overall were bringing in more revenue on a percentage basis compared to their level of representation, Burns says.\n\nFor example, Pace\u2019s stable of artists is 21% female, but sales of their work, which includes the fifth-highest-selling auction artist Agnes Martin, account for 39% of all sales. Similarly, David Zwirner\u2019s roster is 29% female, but their work accounts for 39% of total sales. Zwirner represents two of the top five artists\u2014Yayoi Kusama and Joan Mitchell\u2014as well as Marlene Dumas, who ranks 13th.\n\nAlthough the data was self-reported, and couldn\u2019t be verified, \u201cyou can see they were saying the same thing, and that\u2019s kind of interesting,\u201d Burns says.\n\nDespite Appearances, Museums Have a Ways to Go\n\nAt museums, a startling truth is that acquisitions of art by women peaked in 2009.\n\n\u201cThe numbers were a surprise to us and a surprise to people within the art world, because people aren\u2019t really tracking this,\u201d Burns says.\n\nNearly all the museums Burns contacted in her research, with the exception of the Dia Art Foundation, in fact, did not have data readily at hand, Burns says.\n\n\u201cData is not something embedded in the art world,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s an industry formed on expertise, opinion, having an eye, people are less trustful of data.\u201d As a result, the staff at many museums believed they had done more than they had to increase the representation of women.\n\nThe only institutions that weren\u2019t surprised were the few that are trying to effect change, including Dia, through a targeted fundraising campaign, and the The Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, which is acquiring works by women at five times the national average from the proceeds it earned by the $40.5 million sale of Edward Hopper \u2019s East Wind Over Weehawken, 1934, at Christie\u2019s in 2013.\n\n\u201cYou can see it in their data\u2014a throughline, a trend, or movement toward some goal,\u201d Burns says. \u201cProbably the biggest factor in creating change is the commitment to creating change.\u201d\n\nThe success of the Guggenheim\u2019s af Klint exhibition\u2014\u201ca spiritual painter from the turn of the century who was not in the market, she forbade it in her will\u201d\u2014surprised the museum, which thought it would be poorly attended, Burns says. Instead, the success drove their bottom line, drawing a young audience, and resulting in a 34% boost in membership.\n\n\u201cThe things that can be seen as risky often are not that risky actually\u2014the public is maybe ahead of the art world,\u201d Burns says.", "description": "artnet News and In Other Words find little has changed for female artists at museums or in the market", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-109235/social", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
