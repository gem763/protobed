The country\u2019s pricing is competitive, it\u2019s in the same time zone as Europe, and there are cultural similarities along with a solid telecommunication infrastructure,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\nBPO is a business practice in which one organisation hires another company to perform a task that the hiring organisation requires for its own business to operate successfully.\n\nThe Western Cape\u2019s BPO sector has cornered just over 60% of the country\u2019s international BPO market share, with over 54 000 people employed. Travel, after financial services, retail and telecoms, makes up the fourth-largest component of BPO clients.\n\n\n\nLufthansa InTouch Cape Town operates a 24-hours-a-day, 7-days-a-week service centre, employing more than 260 Customer Service Consultants in its local office. They offer services in English, French, German, Swiss German, Dutch and Hebrew. It\u2019s part of a seven-centre, seven-country international network, which is home to over 2 000 travel consultants, offering 200 services in more than 30 languages. They take care of all requests by passengers flying with the Lufthansa Group airlines.\n\n\u201cWe remain highly positive about and committed to our operations in South Africa\u201d, says V\u00f6gtlin. \u201cOur aim is to increase our staff complement by a further 20% in the next five years, and to branch out and work with more airlines that would like to outsource their customer service operations. We hope that this, along with our philosophy of delivering world-class outcomes, will play a meaningful role in South Africa\u2019s socioeconomic rebound.\u201d", "description": "Lufthansa InTouch, the customer service network of the Lufthansa Group, has marked a 20-year milestone in South Africa.", "authors": ["Compiled Carin Smith"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/4769/7385703892e7408b98298bcd07266317.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
