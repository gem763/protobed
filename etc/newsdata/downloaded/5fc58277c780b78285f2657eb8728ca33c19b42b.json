He and his wife scrambled to go, leaving behind medication, photo albums and their four cats.\n\n\u201cIt was a whole curtain of fire,\u201d Bernard said. \u201cThere was fire on all sides. We had to leave.\u201d\n\nBernard\u2019s home and the cats left inside survived \u2014 barely. His backyard was charred.\n\nBernard and his wife were among some 100,000 residents ordered out of their homes because of a wind-driven wildfire that broke out Thursday evening in the San Fernando Valley. It spread westward through tinder-dry brush in hilly subdivisions on the outskirts of the nation\u2019s second-largest city and was only 13% contained Friday night.\n\nFire officials said 13 buildings were destroyed, many probably homes. Another 18 were damaged. A middle-aged man who was near the fire went into cardiac arrest and died after apparently trying to fight the fire himself, authorities said.\n\nThose under mandatory evacuation orders packed shelters. On Friday, police allowed some to return to their homes for five minutes to gather precious items.\n\nThey won\u2019t be allowed to return permanently until the danger had passed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the fire itself but the danger of wind taking an ember, blowing it someplace, and seeing entire neighborhoods overnight get lit,\u201d Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said Friday.\n\nLos Angeles Fire Chief Ralph M. Terrazas said he flew over the fire Friday and saw \u201chundreds, if not thousands of homes\u201d with charred backyards where firefighters had just managed to halt the flames.\n\n\u201cBe patient with us,\u201d he urged evacuees. \u201cWe want to make sure you\u2019re safe.\u201d\n\nAbout 450 police were deployed in the area, and Police Chief Michel Moore said there would be \u201cno tolerance\u201d for looters.\n\nSmoke belching from the burning chaparral covered some neighborhoods in gray haze. Interstate 5, the main north-to-south corridor in the state, was shut down for much of the day, choking traffic until finally reopening.\n\nThe region has been on high alert as notoriously powerful Santa Ana winds brought dry desert air to a desiccated landscape that only needed a spark to erupt. Fire officials have warned that they expect more intense and devastating California wildfires due, in part, to climate change.\n\nBy late Friday, the winds had subsided but the National Weather Service still warned of extreme fire danger in some Southern California areas because of very low humidity.\n\nThe fire burned as power was restored to most of the nearly 2 million residents in the northern part of the state who lost electricity after Pacific Gas & Electric Co. switched it off Wednesday to prevent a repeat of the past two years when its equipment sparked deadly, destructive wildfires during windy weather.\n\nThe cause of the Los Angeles blaze wasn\u2019t immediately known, though arson investigators said a witness reported seeing sparks or flames coming from a power line near where the fire is believed to have started, said Peter Sanders, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Fire Department.\n\nA Sylmar man, Robert Delgado, said he saw flames under a high-voltage electrical transmission tower near his home at around the time the fire broke out.\n\n\u201cWe had just finished praying the rosary, like we do every night\u201d when his wife looked out a window and saw fire at the bottom of the tower, Delgado told KABC-TV.\n\n\u201cWe immediately ran downstairs, went to the backyard, pulled out the hoses,\u201d he said, but the wind-whipped flames moved with terrifying speed.\n\n\u201cThere were flames and embers flying over those bushes at the back of our house and over our house,\u201d Delgado said. \u201cI was overwhelmed at the sight.\u201d He called it a miracle that his home survived.\n\nSouthern California Edison said it owns the transmission tower shown on KABC-TV, but a spokeswoman would not confirm that was where the fire began. The utility said it could take a long time to determine the cause and origin of the fire.\n\nJonathan Stahl was driving home to Valencia when he saw the smoke and immediately diverted to a mobile home park in Sylmar where his grandmother and aunt live together.\n\nThe park had been nearly wiped out in 2008 when one of the city\u2019s most destructive fires leveled 500 homes.\n\n\u201cOh my God, it\u2019s coming this way,\u201d his aunt said when Stahl called to alert them and she looked out the window, he said.\n\nStahl helped his grandmother, Beverly Stahl, 91, who was in her pajamas, and his aunt to pack clothing, medication and take their two dogs. They saw flames in the distance as they drove away.\n\n\u201cWe just packed up what we could as fast as we could,\u201d Stahl said at an evacuation center at the Sylmar Recreation Center, massaging his grandmother\u2019s shoulders as she sat in a wheelchair with a Red Cross blanket on her lap. \u201cIf we\u2019d stuck around, we would have been in trouble. Real big trouble.\u201d\n\nThe Los Angeles fire broke out hours after flaming garbage in a trash truck sparked another blaze when the driver dumped his load to keep the rig from catching fire. But the dry grass quickly ignited and powerful winds blew the flames into a mobile park in Calimesa, about 75 miles (120 kilometers) east of downtown Los Angeles.\n\nSeventy-four buildings were destroyed and 16 others were damaged. Several residents of the park were unaccounted for.\n\nThe family of 89-year-old Lois Arvickson feared she died in the blaze that destroyed her home.\n\nArvickson had called her son to say she was evacuating.\n\n\u201cShe said she\u2019s getting her purse and she\u2019s getting out, and the line went dead,\u201d Don Turner said.\n\nHe said neighbors saw his mother in her garage as flames approached. They later saw the garage on fire. Her car was still parked in the driveway.", "description": "LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Edwin Bernard, 73, is no stranger to flames that have frequently menaced his sunburnt corner of Los Angeles, but they never arrived as", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/11/17abb0_aptopix-california-wildfires-67512-firefighter-sprays-water-in-an-advancing-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
