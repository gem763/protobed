They are stark. They are unacceptable.\u201d\n\nHe said there were \u201cno easy answers\u201d, but hoped the findings would mark a turning point for the organisation.\n\n\u201cBy being very transparent and stark about the way in which we represent the numbers, it will shock people into action,\u201d he said.\n\nThe survey, which was independently conducted by the Banking Standards Board, comes after the group was rocked earlier this year by reports of a pervasive culture of sexual harassment.\n\nMr Neal added: \u201cThe results of this survey have highlighted the urgency with which we must address the negative actions and behaviours that have for too long gone unspoken and with impunity.\n\n\u201cAlthough the change we need to see will take time, I know that the vast majority of people in our market are as committed as I am to taking action.\u201d\n\nIt has set out a series of long-term measures to tackle inappropriate behaviour, which build on its five-point action plan drawn up in March.\n\nRead more\n\nLloyd's of London needs cleaning up. Its bosses must set an example\n\nAmong the initiatives are plans to encourage workers to speak up about workplace harassment and bullying.\n\nThis follows results of the survey showing only 45 per cent of those questioned felt comfortable raising a concern in the Lloyd's market, and of those who did, fewer than half - 41 per cent - felt they were listened to and taken seriously.\n\nIt also found 38 per cent of respondents said they did not know who to raise concerns with in the Lloyd's market.\n\nLloyd's is now training workers to help empower individuals to act and intervene when they witness inappropriate behaviour.\n\nIt will also launch its \u201cSpeaking up campaign\u201d by the end of the year to encourage people to act when they see or experience inappropriate behaviour.\n\nIt has already promised an independent and confidential access point for reporting inappropriate behaviour.\n\nIndividuals found to have acted inappropriately will be subject to sanctions from both their own companies and Lloyd's, including a possible temporary or permanent ban from entering Lloyd's.\n\nIn April the institution also set out a new code of conduct that included a ban on its staff drinking between 9am and 5pm.", "description": "The boss of Lloyd's of London has vowed to reform its culture after \u201cugly, stark and unacceptable\u201d results of a survey revealed nearly one in 10 of its workers have witnessed sexual harassment in the past year.Chief executive John Neal said the findings of the poll of more than 6,000 staff across", "authors": ["Holly Williams"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/8YgFvwFEI78nXfw46tLeFg--~B/aD0zNDQ7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/7168db1a6a02e314a7913391eb5d2734", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
