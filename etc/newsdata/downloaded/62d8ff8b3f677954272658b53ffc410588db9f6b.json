(Image: NASA/JPL-Caltech/University of Arizona)\n\nNew images taken by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter are providing fresh views of NASA\u2019s Insight lander and Curiosity rover on the Martian surface.\n\nThe Opportunity rover died last year after being smothered by dust, which means NASA has just two robotic probes currently investigating the Martian surface: the six-wheeled Curiosity rover and the immobile InSight lander. Flying high above in space, however, is NASA\u2019s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO), which regularly scans the Martian surface in search of cool new things, like dried-up river channels, fresh impact craters, and the occasional, ahem, elephant.\n\nSometimes the orbiter\u2019s HiRISE camera looks down upon the machines below. This happened recently, according to a NASA press release, so we\u2019ve got some nice new photos of Curiosity and InSight.\n\nInSight is located in a region called Elysium Planitia, which hugs the Martian equator. MRO took the picture above on September 23, 2019 from a height of 272 kilometres. The image is so clear that the lander\u2019s two solar panels, which measure 6 metres from one end to the other, are clearly visible.\n\nThe bright white spot is the dome-shaped shield currently covering InSight\u2019s marsquake detector, which has produced some interesting results. The streaks seen near the lander are tracks left behind by dust devils \u2014 one of which actually swept over the lander back in May.\n\nThe MRO took a grainy photo of InSight in December 2018, but NASA considers this the clearest image yet taken of lander from space, as the agency explains in its press release:\n\nSeveral factors make this image crisper than a set of images released after InSight\u2019s November 2018 landing. For one thing, there\u2019s less dust in the air this time. Shadows are offset from the lander because this is an oblique view looking west. The lighting was also optimal for avoiding the bright reflections from the lander or its solar panels that have obscured surrounding pixels in other images. However, bright reflections are unavoidable with the seismometer cover just south of the lander because of its dome shape.\n\nAs for the dark material surrounding the lander, that was caused by InSight\u2019s retrorockets during its descent.\n\nBefore-and-after pics showing Curiosity\u2019s progress from May 31 to July 20, 2019.

Before-and-after pics show the progress made by Curiosity as it travelled 337 metres from an area called Woodland Bay (top) to Sandside Harbour (bottom), which it did from May 31 to July 20, 2019. Incredibly, the rover\u2019s tracks can be seen if you look closely.\n\nThe lonely surface of Mars will soon have a couple more residents. NASA\u2019s yet-to-be named Mars 2020 rover and ESA\u2019s ExoMars Rosalind Franklin rover are scheduled to launch next year. That\u2019ll mean more cool science, as well as new photo targets for the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.", "description": "New images taken by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter are providing fresh views of NASA\u2019s Insight lander and Curiosity rover on the Martian surface....", "authors": ["Aaron Gordon", "George Dvorsky"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/nyihb2k3pzhauhytqcih.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
