But he now was announcing his decision to retire from politics, a day after Prime Minister Boris Johnson had expelled him from the Conservative Party. He had joined a group of 21 Tory rebels who defied Mr. Johnson on Tuesday night by voting against legislation that would pave the way toward blocking a no-deal Brexit.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m truly very sad that it should end in this way,\u201d Mr. Soames said. \u201cIt is my most fervent hope that this house will rediscover the spirit of compromise, humility and understanding that will enable us finally to push ahead with the vital work in the interests of the whole country that has inevitably had to be so sadly neglected whilst we have devoted so much time to wrestling with Brexit.\u201d\n\nIf Brexit is shaking the foundations of party politics in Britain, the expulsion and resignation of Mr. Soames is a moment that not long ago would have been unimaginable. It is especially searing given that Mr. Johnson, who cast him aside, considers Churchill one of his greatest heroes, and has written a biography of Britain\u2019s wartime leader.", "description": "Nicholas Soames, the grandson of the wartime leader Winston Churchill and a 45-year Tory veteran has been booted from the Conservative Party for supporting a motion to prevent Britain from crashing out of the EU without a deal.", "authors": ["Ceylan Yeginsu"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/04/world/04brexit-soames/04brexit-soames-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
