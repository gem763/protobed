A small amount of remaining material is expected to dislodge over coming days,' he said.\n\nThe whale is believed to have been trapped in the ropes since travelling from Queensland on its way down to Antarctica (pictured)\n\nRescue teams managed to free the whale after spending an hour cutting the ropes and netting (pictured)\n\nThe whale was believed to be caught in netting from the Queensland Shark Control Program.\n\nBut Jacqueline O'Neill, president of the Organisation for the Rescue and Research of Cetaceans in Australia believes shark nets aren't always beneficial.\n\n'We, as an organisation, do believe there are more effective ways to make swimmer feel comfortable,' Ms O'Neill told The Sydney Morning Herald.\n\n'The less whales that can be caught the better.'\n\nIf the whale hadn't been freed from the nets, experts believed it would become so exhausted that it would have died before reaching Antarctica.\n\nAuthorities said some of the rope is still wrapped around the whale's body and they will continue to monitor it on its journey south.", "description": "The whale had been entangled in the ropes and buoys for a several days before it was finally freed on Friday morning in Manly, on Sydney's Northern Beaches.", "authors": ["Eliza Mcphee For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/09/19288714-0-image-a-2_1570178702011.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
