(Planet Labs)\n\nA damaging tornado ripped through northwest Dallas and surrounding areas Sunday night, one of at least nine to touch down amid a significant severe weather outbreak. Stunning before and after photos from above have since emerged depicting the tempest\u2019s fury as its 140 mph winds carved a path 15 miles long.\n\nThe photos, courtesy of Planet Labs, are sobering, revealing the power and caprice of the voracious vortex. It also illustrates the scale \u2014 the streets align on a roughly one mile grid.\n\nIn the image below, running west to east, you see Walnut Hill Lane in Preston Hollow, Tex., to the south.\n\nIn between, you can see a clustering of larger buildings within a field. Among these buildings are the Cary Junior High School, Edward H. Cary Middle School and Thomas Jefferson High School, below the red track. The satellite reveals heavy damage to the roofs of all the buildings, along with what at first glance resembles several vehicles at the high school.\n\n\n\nA number of school buildings were significantly damaged. Notice the spattering of rubble on the far left, where winds of \"only\" 90 mph destroyed several outbuildings. (Planet Labs)\n\nOn the right, next to the high school, you\u2019ll notice several piles of rubble. These were originally modular buildings that succumbed in high-end EF-1 winds. It should be apparent why remaining in a mobile home for a tornado invites the chance of serious injury or death.\n\nFrom there, the tornado crosses Gooding Drive, passing north of the Walnut Hill Recreation Center and just south of the Episcopal School of Dallas. The tornado passes east, leaving behind a trail of churned-up earth, plywood and a loss of vegetation.\n\nThen the tornado passes Preston Road. The red stadium you see on the right in the image below belongs to St. Mark\u2019s School of Texas; to the north of the baseball field, the tornado caused significant damage to the white roofs of the Preston Royal strip mall.\n\nThe Royal Lane Condominiums, to the left of the strip mall and right of the wide Dallas North Tollway in the center of the image, saw their eastern buildings hit by the tornado, while the western ones escaped relatively unscathed. Of the four pools there, the southern two appear to have been drained of water by the twister.\n\n\n\nThe Royal Lane Condominiums can be seen in the middle upper portion of the image. Notice what appears to be missing water from the southern two pools. (Planet Labs)\n\nThe tornado then arcs some, curving gently to the right and heading just south of due east before jogging slightly back north again.\n\nThat curve is visible from the air, as shown in the image below:\n\nWow, look at the scar left behind from the tornado in Dallas last night.

The National Weather Service in Fort Worth surveyed one building that suffered EF-3 damage.\n\n\u201cWithin one concentrated region of EF-2 damage along Northaven Road west of US HWY 75, a particular single-family home was surveyed with total roof loss, and multiple collapsed exterior walls,\u201d they wrote in their post-storm discussion. \u201cThe survey team determined that this damage was consistent with low-end EF-3 intensity winds of approximately 140 mph. This was the only structure that was assigned an EF-3 rating for this tornado.\u201d\n\nWe were able to identify this home on satellite imagery. The store you see is North Haven Gardens. Northaven Road cuts just to the north. Satellite imagery, below, shows the house that was demolished:\n\n\n\nThis is the house that suffered EF-3 damage Sunday night. (Google Earth)\n\n\n\nThis is the home that sustained EF-3 damage during the most powerful of the tornadoes Sunday night. (Planet Labs, Inc.)\n\nGoogle Earth photos from before the tornado (see first image below) show a very well-built home, with a gabled roof.\n\n\n\nA Google Earth photo of the home that sustained EF-3 damage before it was struck Sunday night. (Google Earth)\n\nSarah Barnes, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Fort Worth, confirmed this was indeed the correct house. \u201cWhat we saw was multiple exterior wall collapses. It was a very well-built home,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThere were thick, heavy beams. The roof was lifted up, and we know there had to be significant force to tear this home apart. We really take into account the quality of the structure [when performing these surveys.]\"\n\n#Dallas #tornado 24 hours later ~ #pathofdarkness shows tornado\u2019s path of destruction thru heavily populated area ~ photo courtesy of Dallas Police Dept Air One @DPDAir1 pic.twitter.com/x9RdnVFuLU \u2014 Pamela Blumetti (@PamelaBlumetti) October 22, 2019\n\nRead more\n\nDestructive Dallas tornado lifts debris 20,000 feet high\n\nQuestions raised after Dallas TV station airs NFL game instead of breaking tornado coverage", "description": "At least nine tornadoes tore through Dallas and surrounding areas Sunday night.
