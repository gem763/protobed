Picture taken October 14, 2019 REUTERS/Jose Nunez\n\nDespite having the world\u2019s largest oil reserves, Venezuela\u2019s hyperinflationary economy is suffering widespread fuel shortages resulting from slumping oil output and chronic refinery problems that have worsened since U.S. issued a broad set of sanctions.\n\n\u201cI paid $40 to a National Guard officer at a service station in the municipality of San Francisco to fill my gas tank,\u201d said Ana Maria Ojeda, a 56-year-old merchant who had spent six days in line in an area near the city of Maracaibo.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t take it anymore,\u201d she said.\n\nVenezuela in 2019 has suffered intermittent fuel shortages, which tend to be worse in border areas. Heavy subsidies, which make gasoline almost free, creates an opportunity for lucrative smuggling to nearby nations where fuel is much more expensive.\n\nIt is not immediately evident why the shortages have become more acute in recent days. Neither the information ministry nor state-owned oil company PDVSA immediately responded to requests for comment.\n\nThe government of President Nicolas Maduro has blamed U.S. sanctions for weakening the country\u2019s economy and crippling its oil industry. His adversaries say dysfunctional economic policies and rampant corruption are to blame for the problems.\n\nBetween January and August, Venezuela\u2019s crude production fell 60%, according to unofficial PDVSA figures seen by Reuters.\n\nGasoline is so cheap that drivers rarely bother to pay for it. Any payment typically comes in the form of a tip to the service station employee.\n\nLuis Gonzalez, 41, a baker, spent three days waiting to fuel his car in the Andean city of San Cristobal near the Colombian border. He said fuel tankers often arrive with 14,000 litres, which fuels around 150 cars. His Ford Fiesta had the number 180 written on the windshield to mark his place in line.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m unsatisfied as a Venezuelan citizen, it\u2019s not fair,\u201d said Gonzalez. \u201cHere we are at risk of someone stealing a car battery, a tire or even taking our lives.\u201d", "description": "Venezuelans in border areas are waiting up to six days to fill their cars and some report paying bribes to jump ahead in lines, signalling a return of crippling fuel shortages that have dogged the struggling OPEC nation for much of the year.", "authors": ["Mariela Nava", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441261055&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E203", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
