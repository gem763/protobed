Our expectation is that this government upholds that commitment and if they ask for changes, like any other country, the IMF will look at their request as part of what their economic plan is,\" Mnuchin said on the sidelines of the Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh.\n\n\"We want to see the people of Argentina, and the economy, succeed. Our interests are to support the people,\" Mnuchin added.\n\nMnuchin signed off on an initial $50 billion Argentina program in June 2018, along with an expansion to $57 billion three months later. It is by far the largest bailout in the IMF's 75-year history, with about $43 billion already disbursed.
