Whenever something they claimed to have heard on WhatsApp or friends\u2019 friends, they will spread it right away.\u201d\n\nThe protesters called off action on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIn solidarity against terrorism, all forms of protest in Hong Kong will be suspended on Sept. 11, apart from potential singing and chanting,\u201d they said in a statement.\n\nThe China Daily report was worrying, said another protester, Karen, 23.\n\n\u201cWhen they try to frame the whole protest with those words, it alarms me,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are predicting rather than reporting. I think people calling it off today is a nice move.\u201d\n\nLam said in a speech on Wednesday that Hong Kong was grappling with significant challenges, from the trade dispute between China and the United States to the recent unrest.\n\n\u201cMy fervent hope is that we can bridge our divide by upholding the one country, two systems principle, and the Basic Law, and through the concerted efforts of the government and the people of Hong Kong,\u201d she told business leaders.\n\nThe Basic Law is Hong Kong\u2019s mini-constitution.\n\nThe protests spread to the sports field on Tuesday, as many football fans defied Chinese law to boo the national anthem ahead of a soccer World Cup qualifier against Iran.\n\nSeveral peaceful protests are planned for the next few days, combining with celebrations marking the Mid-Autumn Festival.", "description": "Hong Kong activists called off protests on Wednesday in remembrance of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States and denounced a Chinese state newspaper report that they were planning \"massive terror\" in the Chinese-ruled city.", "authors": ["Jessie Pang", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
