In March, city council officials rejected the restaurant\u2019s bid to open a new location in San Antonio International Airport due to the company\u2019s alleged \u201clegacy of anti-LGBTQ behavior.\u201d\n\nOn Sept. 5, plaintiffs Patrick Von Dohlen, Brian Greco, Kevin Jason Khattar, Michael Knuffke and Daniel Petri filed suit against the city under S.B. 1978, otherwise known as the \"Save Chick-fil-A Bill.\u201d\n\nSupporters of the bill argue that the provision, signed by Gov. Greg Abbott in June, defends the fast-food restaurant and protects religious freedoms, while opponents say it discriminates against the LGBTQ community.\n\nThe new law stops the government from taking unfavorable action against a business or person for contributing to religious organizations.\n\nCHICK-FIL-A'S TORONTO OPENING STORMED BY PROTESTERS: 'CLUCK OFF'\n\n\"The continued religious ban on Chick-fil-A by the San Antonio City Council has left citizens with no choice but to take this case to court,\" Jonathan Saenz, president of conservative group Texas Values Action said of the lawsuit in a statement on Monday, as per The Texas Tribune. \"Any other vendor that tries to replace Chick-fil-A at the airport will be doing so under a major cloud of long and costly litigation with the city.\u201d\n\nIn the lawsuit, the plaintiffs pushed for the court to declare that the city of San Antonio \u201cviolated and continues to violate\u201d the law by banning Chick-fil-A from the San Antonio airport and issue an injunction to block the city and airport shop operator Paradies Lagard\u00e8re from banning the chain at the air hub in the future. Furthermore, the plaintiffs also hope to issue another injunction to have a Chick-fil-A open at the airport and issue an order to stop the city from \"taking any adverse action against Chick-fil-A or any other person or entity, which is based wholly or partly on that person or entity's support for religious organizations that oppose homosexual behavior\u201d and receive attorney\u2019s fees and other relief.\n\nIn response, Laura Mayes, chief communications officer for the city of San Antonio, told the Tribune that the lawsuit \"is an attempt by the plaintiffs to improperly use the court to advance their political agenda.\"\n\n\"Among the many weaknesses in their case, they are trying to rely on a law that did not exist when Council voted on the airport concessions contract,\" Mayes said. \"We will seek a quick resolution from the Court.\u201d\n\nReps for Chick-fil-A and the city of San Antonio were not immediately available to offer further comment.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nIn March, six members of the San Antonio City Council rejected the inclusion of Chick-fil-A from the new Food, Beverage and Retail Prime Concession Agreement for the local airport due to the company\u2019s alleged \u201clegacy of anti-LGBTQ behavior.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith this decision, the City Council reaffirmed the work our city has done to become a champion of equality and inclusion,\" Councilman Roberto Trevi\u00f1o said of the vote, as per News 4 San Antonio. \"San Antonio is a city full of compassion, and we do not have room in our public facilities for a business with a legacy of anti-LGBTQ behavior.\"\n\n\"Everyone has a place here, and everyone should feel welcome when they walk through our airport,\" he continued.\n\nThe day before, Think Progress published tax documents revealing that in 2017, the Chick-fil-A Foundation gave over $1.8 million in charitable donations to some organizations that have come under scrutiny regarding their stance on LGBTQ issues.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOver $1.65 million of that contribution was given to the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, which writes in an online \u201cStatement of Faith\u201d that it believes \u201cmarriage is exclusively the union of one man and one woman,\u201d and believes \u201csexual intimacy\u201d should only be expressed \u201cwithin [that] context,\u201d CBS News reports.\n\nResponding to the news, a rep for Chick-fil-A offered Fox News the following statement on the story. \u201cThe press release issued by Councilmember Trevi\u00f1o was the first we heard of his motion and its approval by the San Antonio City Council. We agree with him that everyone is and should feel welcome at Chick-fil-A,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cWe have a fundamental code of conduct at Chick-fil-A: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe would still welcome the opportunity to have a thoughtful dialogue with the city council and plan to reach out to them. It\u2019s unfortunate that mischaracterizations of our brand have led to decisions like this,\u201d they continued.\n\n\u201cThe sole focus of the Chick-fil-A Foundation is to support causes focused on youth and education. We are proud of the positive impact we are making in communities across America and have been transparent about our giving on our web site,\u201d the restaurant rep concluded.\n\nDays after the news of the San Antonio airport ban broke, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced he was opening an investigation into the city's decision to exclude Chick-fil-A from the contract with the local air hub. In June, Paxton filed a petition in relation to the investigation \"to compel the city to hand over documents related to its decision,\" according to the Free Beacon.\n\nIn recent headlines, on Friday, the grand opening of Chick-fil-A\u2019s first international location in Toronto was met by a large protest Friday by LGBTQ activists, who argued that the chicken-centric chain owner\u2019s historically antigay policies will clash with the culture of Canada's largest city.\n\nFox News\u2019 Talia Kaplan and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "They filed the suit under the \"Save Chick-fil-A Bill,\" which was signed into Texas law in June.", "authors": ["Janine Puhak", "Janine Puhak Is An Editor For Fox News Lifestyle.
