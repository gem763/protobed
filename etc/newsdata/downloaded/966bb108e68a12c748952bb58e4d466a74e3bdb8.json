For 22 years, the whereabouts of the quiet, sandy-haired man known as Bill remained unknown.\n\nThen someone looked closely at a Google Earth satellite photo.\n\nAD\n\nSubmerged in the corner of a retention pond in Wellington, Fla., rested a car that was heavily calcified and clearly had been in the water for a long time. Moldt\u2019s remains were found inside the vehicle along Moon Bay Circle, the Palm Beach County Sheriff\u2019s Office said in a statement.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAmazingly, a vehicle had (been) plainly visible on a Google Earth satellite photo of the area since 2007, but apparently no one had noticed it until 2019, when a property surveyor saw the car while looking at Google Earth,\u201d the Charley Project, a database that compiles information about missing people, wrote in its profile of Moldt.\n\nThe Palm Beach Post first reported on authorities\u2019 identification of the body.\n\nAD\n\nMoldt\u2019s remains were found on Aug. 28 after a former resident saw the car in the pond, the sheriff\u2019s office said. The former resident told a current resident, who flew a drone above the site and immediately called authorities when he confirmed that the vehicle was there.\n\nInvestigators towed the car and the remains to the county medical examiner\u2019s office for processing, the sheriff\u2019s office said.\n\nAD\n\nA woman vanished 27 years ago. A teenager and his GoPro led police to the bottom of a lake.\n\nBarry Fay, whose house the car was behind, told the Sun Sentinel that his neighbor\u2019s ex-husband saw the submerged vehicle on Google Earth. The neighbor asked Fay whether he knew about it.\n\nFay didn\u2019t believe it, the Sun Sentinel reported, but he asked a neighbor who operates a drone to double-check. When the drone confirmed that the car was there, Fay called the sheriff\u2019s office, according to the report.\n\nAD\n\nThe housing complex surrounding the pond, the Grand Isles, was under construction when Moldt disappeared, according to the Charley Project and local news reports.\n\nLantana and Wellington are about 20 miles apart. How Moldt\u2019s car became submerged in the pond remains unclear.\n\nRead more:\n\nBank accidentally puts $120,000 in couple\u2019s account.
