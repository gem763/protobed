Fortunately, it lives up to expectations.\n\n\"Watchmen,\" created for television by \"Lost\" and \"The Leftovers\" cocreator Damon Lindelof, is both a worthy successor to its source material and an exhilarating sci-fi TV series on its own terms. While the two series are incredibly different, \"Watchmen\" should satisfy genre fans \u2014 even those unfamiliar with the graphic novel \u2014 who are looking to fill the gap left by HBO's hit \"Game of Thrones.\"\n\n\"Watchmen\" premieres October 20 on HBO. HBO\n\nA widely cited survey earlier this year predicted that a good portion of HBO Now subscribers would cancel if a specific program ended (presumably \"Game of Thrones\"). But that hasn't appeared to be the case. Other HBO programs that aired this year after \"Game of Thrones\" ended, like the limited series \"Chernobyl\" and \"Euphoria,\" were hits and showed that audiences could stick around for quality programs. \"Watchmen\" should continue that trend.\n\nREAD MORE: A second season of HBO's 'Watchmen' isn't a sure thing and will depend on how audiences respond to season 1\n\nLindelof has called his \"Watchmen\" series a \"remix\" as opposed to a straight adaptation. Dave Gibbons, the cocreator and artist of the novel, said at New York Comic Con this month that he liked Lindelof's vision because it wasn't a sequel or prequel, but an \"amplification.\" After watching the first two episodes, that description is quite accurate.\n\nThe episodes called back to events and characters of the novel in a way that was satisfying. It's also thematically relevant for today's politically charged atmosphere in a similar way that the novel tackled the rising tension of Cold War-era politics.\n\n\"Watchmen\" HBO\n\nThe series brings \"Watchmen\" into the near-future, centering the narrative around racial division and the rise of white supremacy. Vigilantes have been outlawed, police officers wear masks to protect their identity after a horrific event, and a white supremacist group called the Seventh Cavalry has returned.\n\nBut the series is intriguing and thrilling in its own right. While Zack Snyder's 2009 film adaptation lifted the novel almost exactly from the page to the screen, Lindelof's show goes to great lengths to make this accessible for those coming at it from a fresh perspective. Actress Regina King owns every bit of time she's on screen, but the supporting cast \u2014 from Jeremy Irons to Don Johnson \u2014 is fantastic.\n\nThere's a mystery at its heart that should instantly reel viewers in and I'm excited to see where the rest of the series goes with it. Lindelof is known for leaving questions unanswered with his other TV shows, but he said at NYCC that \"Watchmen\" season one will wrap up in a more concrete way \u2014 so much so that a season two isn't a sure thing.\n\nBut director and producer Nicole Kassell told Business Insider in an interview that she thinks there's enough content for a second season or more. Based on what I've seen so far, I hope that's true.\n\n\"Watchmen\" debuts this Sunday, October 20, on HBO.", "description": "Damon Lindelof's \"Watchmen,\" based on the acclaimed graphic novel of the same name, debuts October 20 on HBO.", "authors": ["Travis Clark"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da5cbb1cc4a0a30801a50b4?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
