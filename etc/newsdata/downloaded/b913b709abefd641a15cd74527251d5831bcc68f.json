Sandys/The Washington Post)\n\nOn the day after winning another quarterback competition he was supposed to lose, Case Keenum refused to gloat. He sat in a hall at the Washington Redskins practice facility, tugging at the straps of a backpack, his gaze placid, his demeanor unsurprised. He pursed his lips. His shoulders gave a small shrug.\n\n\u201cNothing has ever been given to me,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\u201d\n\nThis Sunday, Keenum will start a season-opening game for the third time in four years. In the other season, he took over in the second week and led the Minnesota Vikings to within a game of the Super Bowl, having thrown one of the most memorable game-winning playoff touchdowns of all-time.\n\nMost players with records like this have long-term deals worth tens of millions of dollars. Keenum has a long line of releases, expired contracts and low-level trades. In a position normally dripping with entitlement, he might be the least pretentious quarterback in the NFL.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just got a knack for not giving the coaches a chance but to pick him,\u201d said his father, Steve, a former coach of a small college in Texas.\n\n[Landon Collins has always acted older than his age. At 25, he\u2019s a leader for the Redskins.]\n\nNothing\u2019s been given to Case Keenum? How about being that rare coach\u2019s son who never knew the license that comes with playing quarterback for his father? Or try winning that grandest of all prizes \u2014 a football state championship in west Texas \u2014 only to be a two-star recruit with one college scholarship offer? Or going to that college, the University of Houston, winning the starting job as a redshirt freshman, setting the NCAA record for career passing yards and going undrafted because the NFL thinks your outrageous statistics were the product of a contrived college system?\n\nThe words most often used with his name are \u201cjourneyman,\u201d \u201cplaceholder\u201d and \u201cbackup.\u201d In seven NFL seasons he\u2019s gone from the Texans to the Rams to the Texans to the Rams to the Vikings to the Broncos and now to Washington. His reputation is certainly not of a talented passer who can rip apart a defense. This summer, a former NFL head coach chuckled when asked about the Redskins\u2019 quarterback competition.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s put it this way: I never spent any nights lying awake worrying about Case Keenum,\u201d the coach said.\n\nIn the hallway of the Redskins facility, Keenum nodded. A smirk danced on his lips. There\u2019s always been a battle he was supposed to lose, a place that didn\u2019t think he was good enough \u2014 and somehow, he\u2019s always found a way to win.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s who I am, that\u2019s what makes me who I am, the player I am,\u201d he said. \u201cI really do view myself as the guy who wins and that\u2019s why I play. I talk a lot about ping-pong and Spikeball and we play pig or whatever \u2014 hit the crossbar or whatever, when we play quarterback [passing contests after practice]. I absolutely love winning and despise the alternative.\u201d\n\n\n\nKeenum high fives fans after a Vikings victory over the Redskins last November. (Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)\n\n\u2018You feel his experience\u2019\n\nMuch of the NFL sees Keenum as a bridge to rookie first-round pick Dwayne Haskins, the way he was to Jared Goff during the Rams\u2019 first season in Los Angeles. Impatient Redskins fans, anxious for Haskins, might hate the sight of Keenum\u2019s No. 8 behind center in Philadelphia on Sunday. His name is mentioned as a reason Washington might win just three or four games this season. But there also is a value to being the unloved and unwanted quarterback in a sport where games are won less by dominance and more by avoiding \u2014 or overcoming \u2014 disasters.\n\nOn a team with defensive players who believe they are ready to win now and seem intent on scratching their way to victories, an unwanted quarterback who keeps winning jobs might not be such a bad thing. At least they know he is going to fight.\n\n\u201cHe understands that there\u2019s going to be adversity, that there\u2019s going to be ups and downs and things like that,\u201d tight end Vernon Davis said.\n\nThe Redskins coaches know. They had watched hours of game film on Keenum in the weeks after he almost took the Vikings to the Super Bowl. By then it was clear Minnesota wasn\u2019t keeping the quarterback behind its best run in years. As usual, there was someone to like better, someone shiny and expensive who was not shabby Case Keenum, which is how the Vikings came to give Kirk Cousins $84 million guaranteed over three years.\n\n[Aaron Rodgers can do it all. If the Packers got their offseason right, he might not have to.]\n\nBut Washington\u2019s coaches enjoyed watching Keenum. They liked the way he made decisions, the way he handled those moments when receivers are covered and the pass rush is coming . They liked the way he kept plays alive by maneuvering away from sacks and how he understood the concepts difficult for many NFL passers to grasp. Mostly, he got the idea that second and 10 might be the best possible outcome he could get on some plays, better than trying to chase a first down that isn\u2019t there.\n\nAnd while the Redskins ultimately chose to chase a trade for Alex Smith, they remembered those tapes of Keenum. Then, this winter, with Smith sidelined by a career-threatening injury, Colt McCoy going through three surgeries on his broken leg and the draft still weeks away, they talked to the Broncos, who were giving up on Keenum following a 6-10 season. Another of those low-level trades was arranged.\n\nHe was insurance in case McCoy doesn\u2019t get better, many thought. A safety net for Haskins, many said after the draft. But through minicamp and OTAs and training camp, Keenum was the first quarterback with the first-team offense. Soon it became obvious. He was going to win another battle.\n\n\u201cWith Case, you feel his experience,\u201d Redskins offensive coordinator Kevin O\u2019Connell said. \u201cYou feel his presence in the huddle. You feel his ability to retain information from a meeting and take it out to the practice field and apply it. You don\u2019t have to tell him multiple things over and over again.\u201d\n\n\n\nKeenum talks with Redskins Coach Jay Gruden during a preseason game against Atlanta. (Jonathan Newton / The Washington Post)\n\n\u2018There\u2019s a lot of ways of playing quarterback\u2019\n\nOn the phone this past weekend, Steve Keenum heard the word \u201csystem\u201d and his voice dropped. For a moment there was silence.\n\n\u201cNow you\u2019re going to get the coach in me coming out,\u201d he said in a weary voice.\n\nSystem, he said, was a lazy word, the excuse NFL coaches and scouts and general managers came up with to say a 6-foot-1, 215 pound quarterback who was a two-star college recruit couldn\u2019t possibly play in their league. Those 1,546 completions and 19,217 passing yards and 155 touchdown throws that were all NCAA records when he left school in the spring of 2012? They were a product of the gimmicky pass-heavy Air Raid offense that Houston ran.\n\n\u201cIt was easy for them to say: \u2018It\u2019s got to be the system,\u2019 \u201d Steve Keenum said.\n\nBut isn\u2019t every NFL offense a system? Isn\u2019t the West Coast offense, whose principles form the foundation of more than half the league\u2019s attacks, a system? And what exactly is offense in the NFL these days? Eight years after the league wrote off Keenum as a product of a gimmick , the Arizona Cardinals made his college offensive coordinator, Kliff Kingsbury, their head coach, with the idea of running something very much like that Air Raid offense at Houston.\n\n\u201cAs a quarterback in college my offense was a system, it was a spread-it-out-and-throw-it-around, and I ran that system to perfection,\u201d Case Keenum said. \u201cAnd this is a system [here] too, and I\u2019m trying to be a quarterback within this system. And the same if I was in a digit system, if I was in a pound-the-rock system, if I was in a spread-it-out system, if I was in a boots-and-keepers system, if I was in a wishbone system. I\u2019m going to work my craft every day.\u201d\n\n[Daniel Snyder dreamed of owning the Redskins. Two decades in, success remains elusive.]\n\nThere is a skill in the ability to move from team-to-team, learning a new offense in a matter of weeks and then playing it as if you had been doing so for years. Quarterbacks tend to be slow to pick up Redskins Coach Jay Gruden\u2019s offense, which is why McCoy had such a great advantage in knowing it. Even Smith was still working to make the fit seem natural when he got hurt last November. Keenum himself has compared learning Gruden\u2019s system to trying to master Portuguese. And yet, he\u2019s managed to understand it faster than most.\n\n\u201cI think his experience with lots of different offenses lends him positively to come in here and pick it up,\u201d the team\u2019s quarterback coach Tim Rattay said.\n\nAs he sits in the hallway, Keenum seems unfazed. He refuses to carry grudges about the past, figuring he\u2019s better for all the fights. Rather than keep a list of those who let him go, he remembers those who gave him a chance.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of ways of playing quarterback in this league and there\u2019s a lot of ways of getting passes completed and putting drives together and scoring touchdowns and winning games,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s not the most exciting thing to say. It\u2019s not what Redskins fans, desperate for an explosive offense, want to hear. It\u2019s probably not the kind of thing that would come from Patrick Mahomes or Drew Brees or Aaron Rodgers. But it\u2019s come from the fight, from a list of transactions as long as his career, from the two-star undrafted quarterback who keeps starting games in a league that never seemed to want him.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe Redskins are already getting big contributions out of their rookie class\n\nNFL teams thought Donald Penn was retired.
