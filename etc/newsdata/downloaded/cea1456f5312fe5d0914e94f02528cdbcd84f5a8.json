Adam Schiff fraudulently read to Congress, with millions of people watching, a version of my conversation with the President of Ukraine that doesn\u2019t exist. He was supposedly reading the exact transcribed version of the call, but he completely changed the words to make it sound horrible, and me sound guilty,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nSCHIFF SLAMMED FOR CHALKING UP 'DISTURBING' FICTIONAL ACCOUNT OF TRUMP-UKRAINE CALL TO 'PARODY'\n\nHe continued, \u201cAdam Schiff therefore lied to Congress and attempted to defraud the American Public. He has been doing this for two years. I am calling for him to immediately resign from Congress based on this fraud!\u201d\n\nThe dramatic reading happened Thursday when Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire was on Capitol Hill to defend his handling of the whistleblower complaint about the call that touched off a formal impeachment inquiry this week.\n\nThe complaint and the transcript of that call, both released this week, detailed how Trump urged President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,\u201d Trump said in the phone call, according to the transcript. \u201cBiden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it\u2026It sounds horrible to me.\u201d\n\nBut at the hearing, Schiff, D-Calif., offered an exaggerated version of the call.\n\n\u201cI have a favor I want from you,\u201d Schiff said while appearing to read from a piece of paper. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to say this only seven times, so you better listen good. I want you to make up dirt on my political opponent, understand? Lots of it, on this and on that.\u201d\n\nSchiff later chalked up his fictional summary of the phone call to a joke as he came under fire from conservatives for making up quotes.\n\n\u201cMy summary of the president\u2019s call was meant to be at least, part, in parody,\" Schiff said. \"The fact that that\u2019s not clear is a separate problem in and of itself. Of course, the president never said, \u2018If you don\u2019t understand me I\u2019m going to say it seven more times,\u2019 my point is, that\u2019s the message that the Ukraine president was receiving in not so many words.\"\n\nTrump on Friday was not buying that claim, however.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cHE WAS DESPERATE AND HE GOT CAUGHT,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nSchiff quickly responded to Trump\u2019s tweet with one of his own, accusing him of trying to cover up a \u201cshakedown.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019re right about one thing \u2014 your words need no mockery,\" Schiff said. \"Your own words and deeds mock themselves.\"", "description": "President Trump called Friday for House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff to resign for \u201cfraudulently\u201d reading out a hyperbolic account of Trump\u2019s controversial July phone call with the Ukrainian president.", "authors": ["Adam Shaw"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/27/694940094001_6089891043001_6089893388001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
