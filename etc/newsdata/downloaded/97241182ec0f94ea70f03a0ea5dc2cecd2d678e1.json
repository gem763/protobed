Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban wanted to find out...\n\nKen Clark did it for science.\n\nIt was 2014, and Clark, then a doctoral student at Southern Methodist University, was part of a biomechanics group tasked by Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban with studying \u2013 and perhaps fixing \u2013 flopping, basketball\u2019s dark, daffy art of fooling referees into calling fouls that aren\u2019t.\n\nLike all researchers, the SMU team needed data. Specifically, collision data. The underlying idea, Clark tells the Guardian, was \u201cwhat if we just imagine people like billiard balls and go from there?\u201d And that\u2019s how Clark, his colleagues, and some hardy student volunteers found themselves in a campus lab, slamming each other off their feet, over and over again, as sensors captured every pileup.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to get the lab in trouble, as far as exposing students to bumps and bruises,\u201d says Clark, now a kinesiology professor at West Chester University in Pennsylvania, with a laugh. \u201cBut I\u2019ll say this: the collisions were designed to replicate what goes on in a game.\u201d\n\nYears after a company owned by Cuban gave a six-figure grant to SMU to investigate a perpetual hoops quandary that leaves game officials perplexed and fans apoplectic \u2013 flop or not? \u2013 the school\u2019s Locomotor Performance Laboratory has released its findings in an amusing and informative video that breaks down everything you wanted to know about the physics of flopping, but probably never thought to ask:\n\nIt takes surprisingly little force to knock a stationary human off balance or entirely onto their keister, even someone as large and strong as the typical National Basketball Association player \u2013 which means flopping may not be as common as people assume.\n\nIf a player throws their arms skyward upon contact like they\u2019ve just crawled through 500 yards of sewage-smelling foulness to escape the Shawshank penitentiary, then yes, they\u2019re probably flopping.\n\nFloppers bring a distinct quality to their performances \u2013 measurable momentum \u2013 that can be used to help identify and perhaps even police the act.\n\nNBA\u2019s travails in China a cautionary tale for the Premier League | Marina Hyde Read more\n\n\u201cThe athletes in the NBA and college basketball are incredible,\u201d Clark says. \u201cBut when you watch them take a hit, it\u2019s obvious that sometimes they are positioning themselves in a way to topple with the least amount of force possible \u2013 and that\u2019s putting it tactfully. To put it bluntly, they\u2019re exaggerating collisions and falling down when they wouldn\u2019t normally have to. So when are they flopping? We felt we could address that from a rigorous scientific framework.\u201d\n\nEverybody flops\n\nMarcus Smart did not step on a landmine. It only looked that way. During an Atlanta-Boston game in 2016, the Celtics guard \u2013 and acknowledged grandmaster of contemporary NBA flopping \u2013 dashed along the baseline to position himself for an offensive rebound. Hawks forward Kyle Korver bumped (brushed?) Smart with his hip. Smart went airborne, knees tucked toward his chest like a platform diver, groan-gasping as if Mike Tyson had just landed a kidney shot, eventually landing somewhere in the vicinity of the basket stanchion.\n\nManu Ginobili was known for his simulation skills during his career. Photograph: Guardian graphic\n\nSpeaking to ESPN earlier this year, Smart didn\u2019t defend his flop, which earned him a $5,000 fine from the league office. But he didn\u2019t exactly condemn the practice, either. \u201cLet\u2019s get that straight, that\u2019s a flop, this was hilarious,\u201d he said. \u201cI deserved everything that came my way after that. I flop on defense, your favorite player flops on offense. That\u2019s the only difference. Especially in a game where the offense has nothing but the advantage, the defense has to do something to get the advantage back.\u201d\n\nSmart wasn\u2019t wrong. In the NBA, there are two types of players. Those who have flopped, and those who haven\u2019t \u2013 yet. LeBron James flops. Chris Paul flops. Stephen Curry flops. Hoops history\u2019s attic is crammed with Oscar-worthy efforts: a Vlade Divac pratfall here, a Dwyane Wade tumble there, a truly magnificent offense-defense double dive from Manu Ginobili and Raja Bell, the flopping equivalent of the Al Pacino-Robert DeNiro diner face-off in Heat.\n\n\u201cFlops have been around for a long time,\u201d says Ronnie Nunn, a former NBA referee and league director of officials. \u201cWe even have rebounding flops! Dennis Rodman was really good at grabbing the wrist of his opponent while going up and making it look like he was being fouled. Karl Malone introduced an arching back on rebounds \u2013 if he was closer to the basket than his man, he would make it look like he was pushed [in the back] and was being moved, even if that [opponent\u2019s] forearm never came forward.\u201d\n\nNunn laughs. \u201cBasketball is a crafty game. In terms of fooling the referee, flopping is part of its art and culture.\u201d\n\nCracking down\n\nFlopping is also, to use a technical term, cheating. A kind of athletic Fyre Festival ticket. Basketball fans love to see the good guys get away with some well-timed ersatz contact; they get irate when the bad guys pull the same trick.\n\nPlayers, coaches, and NBA front offices are no different. In 2012, the league cracked down, announcing that flops \u2013 defined as any physical act that appears to have been intended to cause the referees to call a foul on another player \u2013 would earn warnings for first-time violators, followed by an escalating series of fines for repeat offenders.\n\n\u201cI think flopping had a lot of [general managers] up in arms,\u201d says Washington Wizards general manager Tommy Sheppard, who has worked in the NBA for 26 years. \u201cIt had become a weapon, and it seemed like an unfair advantage. It\u2019s not fair. It\u2019s not right. It doesn\u2019t pass the eye test. So the league tried to shame people into not flopping.\u201d\n\nNBA 2019-20 predictions: The rise of Los Angeles and the era of the super duos Read more\n\nTo stop flopping, however, you first have to spot flopping \u2013 yet by definition, a good flop is indistinguishable in real time from a genuine foul. According to Nunn, separating fiction from fact isn\u2019t always easy. Not when the game features some of the world\u2019s most explosive athletes. And not when officials already are keeping a watchful eye on a half-dozen different things in any given moment.\n\nBesides, not all flops are considered flops. Pretending to get hit and falling down? Verboten. Acting as though a forearm that never touched your face nearly removed your head? A no-no. But adding a dramatic physical flourish when you\u2019re also really and truly being fouled? That\u2019s just \u201cselling a call\u201d \u2013 and the NBA is fine with it.\n\n\u201cEmbellishments are the other piece to this,\u201d Nunn says. \u201cPlayers use them to win calls they were going to win anyway. Say you have a dribbler putting his arm into the chest of a defender. The defender flailing away like the offensive player threw a punch may be less bad than the offensive player using their arm to get an advantage.\u201d\n\nBeyond the eye test\n\nEnter Cuban. Curious and data-driven, he approached SMU biomechanics professor Peter Weyand in 2013 with a novel request.\n\nCould Weyand\u2019s lab study flopping, the better to reduce referee guesswork by creating some basic guidelines on what levels of force, speed, and size contribute to genuine falls \u2013 especially in a league where guards weighing less than 200lbs regularly bowl over front court players more than 50lbs heavier?\n\n\u201cIf you look at a high-contact sport like football, you see few pancakes, where guys end up on their behinds,\u201d Cuban told the Wall Street Journal at the time. \u201cYet in our sport, guys end up on their backsides all the time.\u201d\n\nWeyand and his team specialize in athletic performance \u2013 they\u2019ve researched Usain Bolt\u2019s unique stride, Oscar Pistorius\u2019 artificial legs, and how to run a marathon in less than two hours. Yet when they began to investigate athletic performance art, they quickly realized it was virgin scientific territory.\n\n\u201cWe looked at sports science related to soccer \u2013 there\u2019s obviously a lot of flopping there,\u201d Clark said. \u201cWe looked at the biomechanics of slips and falls in daily living. We looked all over the place. There wasn\u2019t much out there.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban commissioned the study into flopping. Photograph: Tony Gutierrez/AP\n\nFacing a void, the SMU researchers began with a basic question: just how much force does it take to knock someone off balance, or completely over? Weyand\u2019s team wrote predictive equations. They fashioned a mechanical dummy \u2013 nicknamed \u201cGus\u201d \u2013 out of plywood, PVC pipes, and galvanized tubing and repeatedly knocked it down with a padded, sensor-equipped yellow bar. They used to same bar to topple lab volunteers outfitted with reflective sensors.\n\n\u201cI wanted to put a [San Antonio] Spurs jersey on Gus,\u201d Weyand said with a laugh. \u201cMaybe Ginobili or someone else known to be a flopper. But not everyone in the group would have been happy with that \u2013 it would have been pushing it little too far to put [the Mavericks\u2019] cross-state rivals in there. No pun intended.\u201d\n\nAll three experiments told the same story. It doesn\u2019t take much to knock someone standing upright off balance \u2013 just 50lbs for a quarter of a second, roughly the same as walking or lightly jogging into someone.\n\nWeyand, who played basketball at Bates College, was surprised. \u201cIf we had found that it takes huge amounts of force, then you could assume that every time you see someone falling over in a NBA game, they\u2019re faking it,\u201d he says. \u201cBut no \u2013 in many cases, if the defender just doesn\u2019t move their feet, then down they go. I\u2019ve been through thousands of charge-block collisions, and never realized how easy it was.\u201d\n\nAdding extra\n\nNext came human-on-human collisions. One person got a running start. The other remained stationary. Participants wore boxing headgear and baseball catcher chest pads, and fell into a padded track and field pit mat.\n\n\u201cIt was more fun than dangerous,\u201d Weyand says. \u201cWe had very thick mats.\u201d\n\nDid anyone end up needing to wear a cup? \u201cIf someone had gotten really doubled over or took a shot [between the legs], it would have been common knowledge in the lab,\u201d he says.\n\nThe researchers staged hundreds of collisions at different speeds, heights, and angles. In some, the stationary targets were told to react naturally; in others, they were told to flop. All of the hits were recorded using a 12-camera system similar to the ones used to create motion-capture animations for video games such as NBA 2K.\n\nAnalyzing that data, Weyand and company drew two key conclusions. First, during natural two-person collisions, the stationary recipient will fall backwards with their arms out \u2013 but not up, and certainly not high enough to direct traffic on an aircraft carrier flight deck.\n\n\u201cThose big, above the head gestures you see in the NBA?\u201d Clark says. \u201cThat\u2019s not natural counter-movement. That\u2019s what floppers do.\u201d\n\nSecond, the SMU researchers confirmed that human collisions are subject to the same laws of physics as billiard balls. How so? When two objects collide, total momentum is conserved \u2013 that is, the stationary object can\u2019t gain any more momentum following the impact than the moving object loses. In flops, however, total momentum increased, a telltale sign that the floppers were adding something extra to the equation.\n\n\u201cEither they were jumping after the collisions, or it was excessive arm action,\u201d Clark says. \u201cEither way, we could measure it.\u201d\n\nLasting value\n\nDrawing on their study, the SMU group has recommendations for NBA officials \u2013 and anyone watching at home \u2013 making Flop or Not calls:\n\nMake sure the defender\u2019s body and feet are stationary;\n\nMake sure actual contact has occurred;\n\nMake sure the defender\u2019s response time is appropriate \u2013 that is, that they don\u2019t start going down before a collision, nor too late after one;\n\nCheck for defender arm motion that\u2019s excessively upward.\n\n\n\nKarl Malone: \u2018if he was closer to the basket than his man, he would make it look like he was pushed\u2019. Photograph: Guardian graphic\n\n\u201cThe main thing is just to look at what players do with their upper bodies,\u201d Clark says. \u201cThat\u2019s the major giveaway. Anything going on probably isn\u2019t necessary. They\u2019re doing it to sell it. It may still be a charge, but they are selling.\u201d\n\nIf that all seems obvious \u2013 less Galileo championing heliocentricity than the latest concussion study confirming that getting hit in the head is bad \u2013 well, sometimes the scientific method leads to known territory.\n\nBesides, Clark does have one potentially revolutionary idea: use data from the sophisticated motion-tracking cameras installed in every NBA arena to calculate the momentum conserved or added during questionable player collisions, the better to flag who might be flopping.\n\n\u201cWe thought about that a lot,\u201d he says. \u201cThey know much these players weigh, and what speed they\u2019re moving at all times. Depending on how accurate the cameras are, you don\u2019t need a system like we have in our laboratory to do similar calculations.\u201d\n\nBut does the NBA need a system at all? In the first three seasons following the adoption of anti-flopping rules, the league reportedly handed out a total of 87 warnings and 13 fines to 73 players. Last season, by contrast, just five warnings and zero fines were issued.\n\nNunn attributes the drop to improved officiating. Sheppard says an emphasis on perimeter play means fewer low-post backdowns and rim-attacking drives \u2013 which also means fewer opportunities for traditional defensive pratfalls.\n\nStill, neither man believes flopping is a dying art. Instead, it\u2019s simply evolving. \u201cNow you have more varied flops,\u201d Nunn says, \u201cand more flops by offensive players.\u201d To wit: in 2017, Houston guard James Harden\u2019s ability to draw dubious fouls on three-point shot attempts led the league to adopt new officiating guidelines.\n\n\u201c[Flopping] gets passed down from generation to generation,\u201d Sheppard says. \u201cUsually it\u2019s peer-to-peer, but sometimes players become a coach and teaches it. It\u2019s getting that handful of jersey, or sticking that elbow under someone\u2019s arm, and somehow you\u2019re the one being held or being hit. Guys that can master it can squeeze another year or two out of their careers. Setting screens, drawing fouls, getting an extra possession \u2013 that is valuable.\u201d\n\nShould Cuban again decide that flopping is valuable enough to research, there\u2019s much more to study.\n\n\u201cThe circumstance we looked at in the lab was stationary defender, offensive player coming in, the most controlled situation so we could be most certain of the numbers,\u201d Weyand says. \u201cBut a lot of collisions on the court are not like that. You have off-ball picks, rolls with two players moving. To have firm answers to those, we\u2019d have to [study] an actual NBA game. Is it potentially possible? Sure.\u201d", "description": "Could a group of scientists help refs by figuring out when basketball stars were acting?
