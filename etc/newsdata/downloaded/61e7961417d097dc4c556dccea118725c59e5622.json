Smith Associates and Visnic Homes. It is listed at $15.5 million. (HomeVisit)\n\nWhen the Blairs bought the house, they knew it needed to be expanded to accommodate their 16 grandchildren. They hired G.L. Smith Associates to design the renovation and Visnic Homes to execute the design.\n\n\u201cThe house had good bones,\u201d Tom said. \u201cWe wanted to take something that was good and make it truly exceptional.\u201d\n\nWell-heeled home buyers can enjoy their cuppa at Sir Thomas Lipton\u2019s Osidge\n\nOnce the grandchildren started visiting, the Blairs made sure that they never lacked for things to do.\n\n\u201cOne of the grandchildren said, \u2018Grandma, I\u2019d really like a horse,\u2019 \u201d Alice said. \u201cWell, in three weeks, we had a barn and a horse. It was one of those things that we spoiled them to death.\u201d\n\nThe horse was joined by more horses, Herefords, goats, alpacas and chickens. For those less interested in farm life, there is a swimming pool and a dock for boats and personal watercraft.\n\nNot everything was for the grandchildren. A grassy airstrip was added, near where the goats grazed, for Tom to land his vintage World War II planes. He designed the library to accommodate a British Spitfire that hangs from the ceiling. And a fondness for church ruins led to the property\u2019s most evocative feature \u2014 ivy-covered stones arranged to resemble a tumbled down place of worship. The serene spot has been the site of a family wedding and christening.\n\nInside the D.C. area\u2019s most expensive homes for sale in August\n\nThe layout of the 16,774-square-foot main house allows for large gatherings as well as intimate conversations. There are formal living and dining rooms but also relaxed family and kid spaces.\n\n\u201cIt was a wonderful place where Tom and I felt cozy, but I also felt cozy with 20 people in it,\u201d Alice said. \u201cIt\u2019s an unusual house that way.\u201d\n\nMany rooms have floor-to-ceiling windows offering panoramic views of the water and the spectacular sunsets.\n\nFor the Blairs, this property has been an oasis where they enjoyed spending time with their grandchildren.\n\n\u201cBut they\u2019re all grown up now,\u201d Alice said. \u201cMost of them are in college or out of college. Times change.\u201d\n\nIn addition to a 12-bedroom, 14-bathroom main house, the 36-acre property includes a three-bedroom guesthouse, a two-bedroom farmhouse, a one-bedroom caretaker\u2019s cottage, a greenhouse, two barns, multiple paddocks and several outbuildings that include a hangar for a plane.
