(AP) - Two-time Pro Bowl cornerback Jalen Ramsey has requested a trade following a sideline argument with Jacksonville Jaguars coach Doug Marrone.\n\nThe Jags are willing to entertain offers.\n\nRamsey\u2019s agent asked the Jags to move the disgruntled defender after Ramsey and Marrone got into a heated exchange during the team\u2019s 13-12 loss at Houston, according to a person with knowledge of the situation.\n\nThe person spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity Monday because neither Ramsey nor the team had made the request public.\n\nRamsey\u2019s agent, David Mulugheta, confirmed to ESPN that he asked the Jags to trade his client. Mulugheta did not immediately respond to a text message from the AP.\n\nRamsey was upset that Marrone didn\u2019t challenge DeAndre Hopkins\u2019 first-down catch late in the first quarter of the game. The Texans moved the chains and ended the drive with a field goal. Ramsey said something to Marrone as he walked off the field and appeared to put his hands on the head coach as he made his way to the bench. Marrone responded by getting in Ramsey\u2019s face and yelling.\n\nMarrone offered few explanations for the intense altercation and said Ramsey would not be punished.\n\n\u201cThose things, they happen all the time,\u201d Marrone said Monday. \u201cThey really do. I think now they\u2019re a little bit more publicized, but ever since I played there\u2019s always stuff that goes on during the course of the game. \u2026 It\u2019s a high-intensity profession.\u201d\n\nMarrone said he approached Ramsey on the bench because \u201cI wanted him to move on from it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, that was over plays ago,\u201d Marrone said. \u201cMove on from it. Let\u2019s go. We\u2019ve got a long way to go in this game. Get that behind you.\u201d\n\nRamsey declined interview requests in the locker room after the game, and players were off Monday.\n\nThe Jaguars, 0-2 for the first time in Marrone\u2019s three seasons, host AFC South rival Tennessee (1-1) on Thursday night.\n\nRamsey has been a standout player and standoffish person during his four seasons in Jacksonville.\n\nHis tenure has included publicly questioning defensive coordinator Todd Wash; roundly ripping several NFL quarterbacks; and getting suspended for a week in the 2018 preseason for threatening a reporter.\n\nHe raised eyebrows in August when he appeared on the podcast of Titans left tackle Taylor Lewan and said he\u2019d like to play in his hometown of Nashville, Tennessee or Las Vegas if Jacksonville doesn\u2019t re-sign him.\n\nThe Jaguars told Ramsey this offseason they didn\u2019t plan to give him a contract extension until after the season.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve fought through injuries. I\u2019ve fought through everything, haven\u2019t missed a game,\u201d Ramsey said. \u201cI feel like I have outplayed my rookie contract and I feel I\u2019ve earned a new contract, but at the end of the day, it\u2019s not the end of the world.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m tremendously blessed. I\u2019m so blessed. I\u2019m not down on it or anything like that at all, but that is the circumstance. That is what I\u2019ve been told.\u201d\n\nRamsey is entering the final year of his $23.3 million rookie contract. The Jaguars already exercised the fifth-year option in the deal, meaning he\u2019s also tied to the club for $13.7 million in 2020.\n\nHe wants to be the best cornerback in the NFL and wants to shadow every team\u2019s top receiver. When that\u2019s not part of the game plan - see Week 1 against Kansas City - Ramsey often loses focus, gets out of position and gives up touchdowns.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Two-time Pro Bowl cornerback Jalen Ramsey has requested a trade following a sideline argument with Jacksonville Jaguars coach Doug Marrone.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Mark Long"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/15/jaguars_texans_football_80879_c0-130-3115-1946_s1770x1032.jpg?f753a7f269c26b74abeef0ae71264d4893c90d0c", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
