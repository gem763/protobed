As a gifted athlete and high achiever academically, it was entirely out of character.\n\n\u201cHalf the month I was extroverted, firing on all cylinders,\u201d Rachel says. \u201cThen I would hit ovulation. And at that time I became dysfunctional, shy and withdrawn. It\u2019s like I woke up one day and became a completely different person. And from then until I started menstruating I became utterly dysfunctional. Then I would get my period and I would be fine. And this happened again and again and again.\u201d\n\nShe says these symptoms \u2013 which doctors have now attributed to premenstrual dysphoric disorder, or PMDD \u2013 have affected intimate relationships and friendships over the years because she would withdraw socially if she felt the fog of depression closing in: \u201cI couldn\u2019t stand myself so how could anyone else?\u201d\n\nPMDD affects between 3% and 8% of women of reproductive age. It\u2019s caused by fluctuations in hormone levels which affect brain chemistry and result in severe mood disturbances, says Prof Jayashri Kulkarni, a psychiatrist and director of the Monash Alfred psychiatry research centre at Monash University in Melbourne.\n\nWhy is premenstrual syndrome still so badly understood? | Hannah Ewens Read more\n\nUnlike PMS, which hits two to four days out from menstruation with various physical and emotional symptoms, the onset of PMDD is one to two weeks before a woman gets her period, known as the luteal phase. It results in a sudden and significant depression and lifts just as abruptly when the woman\u2019s period begins.\n\n\u201cThis is a condition where there are significant depression symptoms, and that can include suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts, some of which are, tragically, realised,\u201d says Kulkarni, who has been working in and researching the area of women\u2019s mental health for almost 30 years.\n\n\u201cSome of the key features of PMDD are when a woman says, \u2018It\u2019s like someone flicked a switch. I\u2019m OK, then suddenly, bang, there is a major depression. I can\u2019t get out of bed, I can\u2019t think. I get tearful, I get irritable, I get angry, I can\u2019t process cognitively very well.\u2019 \u201d\n\nKulkarni says PMDD symptoms, including anxiety, rage and hostility \u2013 all symptoms of depression although often not recognised as such \u2013 can wreak havoc on relationships. \u201cAll sorts of things can go astray, including work performances and relationships with colleagues,\u201d she says.\n\nKulkarni has seen adolescents as young as 12 affected, all the way through to women nearing menopause, when the condition typically worsens.\n\nAlthough women have been battling this condition for generations, PMDD has been recognised as a clinical mental health condition for only six years. In 2013 it was included as a depressive disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mood Disorders, published by the American Psychiatric Association.\n\nThere are some women who are more sensitive to their hormone fluctuations than others Prof Jayashri Kulkarni\n\nSignificantly, a gene related to PMDD was found by researchers from the US National Institutes of Health and published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry in 2017. It points to a biological predisposition for those women who are extra sensitive to the normal hormonal fluctuations in their cycles. At the time the gene discovery was published, an NIH researcher, Dr David Goldman, said: \u201cThis is a big moment for women\u2019s health because it establishes that women with PMDD have an intrinsic difference in their molecular apparatus for response to sex hormones \u2013 not just emotional behaviours they should be able to voluntarily control.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a pivotal time for women\u2019s wellbeing in Australia. It\u2019s a time when women\u2019s health issues, like endometriosis, are finally being talked about and taken seriously \u2013 evidenced by the $10m federal government funding boost for endometriosis research and awareness announced earlier this year by the health minister, Greg Hunt.\n\nKulkarni is at pains to emphasise that PMDD is not just \u201cbelow the belt\u201d but a condition with its epicentre in the brain.\n\nWhy don\u2019t doctors trust women? Because they don\u2019t know much about us | Gabrielle Jackson Read more\n\nShe says all the hormones involved in a woman\u2019s cycle \u2013 progesterone, oestrogen and testosterone \u2013 are potent brain chemicals.\n\n\u201cProgesterone, and in particular allopregnanolone (a hormone produced when progesterone is broken down in the brain), is thought to be a major cause of PMDD,\u201d she says. \u201cBut oestrogen \u2018protects\u2019 the brain in many ways, and imbalances in progesterone and oestrogen in the brain can lead to the depression symptoms seen in women with PMDD.\n\n\u201cThese are all very potent hormones. And there are some women who are more sensitive to their hormone fluctuations than others.\u201d\n\nRachel is one of those women. Her experience can be traced back to adolescence, but she was officially diagnosed only six years ago, in her early 30s, after years searching for an answer. A red flag for Rachel, as well as her depressive symptoms, was when her inner dialogue would suddenly nosedive into negative self-talk. \u201cThere would suddenly be a shift \u2026 an almost bullying way of talking to myself that wasn\u2019t characteristic of me,\u201d she says.\n\nA PMDD diagnosis requires women to experience at least five symptoms in the final week before her period, which improve when menstruation starts and are minimal or absent in the remaining weeks of her cycle. These include mood swings, irritability, anger, anxiety, tension, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, social withdrawal and \u2013 as Rachel experienced \u2013 self-deprecating thoughts. There can be physical symptoms too, such as breast tenderness or swelling, joint or muscle pain, and a sensation of \u201cbloating\u201d or weight gain. Often women are asked to keep a diary to note the symptoms for several cycles before a diagnosis is reached.\n\nThe stigma over periods won\u2019t end until boys learn about them too | Amika George Read more\n\nTreatment can vary from practitioner to practitioner and from patient to patient \u2013 the same approach does not necessarily work for everyone. Kulkarni works closely with an endocrinologist and favours a multipronged approach involving hormone modulation \u2013 experimenting with doses of progesterone and oestrogen (including the contraceptive pill and oestrogen patches) \u2013 underpinned by psychological support. Low doses of antidepressant medication are added if needed but are not the first line of treatment. In the worst-case scenario, when women are not responding to any other treatments, inducing menopause with medication is an option.\n\nThe thing is, women\u2019s mental health is not a national priority \u2013 and it should be Prof Jayashri Kulkarni\n\n\u201cWe have in the past had to resort to chemical menopause, at the very severe end, where somebody is profoundly depressed and their life is at risk,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s an extreme approach and very few people need it. It\u2019s essentially shutting off those hormonal fluctuations. And we\u2019ve had some great successes in women who have tried everything else and nothing has worked.\u201d\n\nKulkarni says hysterectomies are not advocated by the clinic unless there is a very clear physical health reason beyond PMDD, such as additional complications with fibroids or severe endometriosis.\n\nFor Rachel the combination of psychological support, hormonal and anti-depressant treatment has allowed her to manage her condition, although it has taken time.\n\n\u201cThe big thing I have noticed in the past six months in particular is that the fog has lifted,\u201d she says. \u201cThere isn\u2019t this cognitive fog, this sense of walking through treacle, which was the fatigue I had a lot of the time.\u201d\n\nShe says she found it hard to confide in anyone about her condition, including female friends. In the past she would reach out if she was struggling but with PMDD, she feels there is still a stigma and a lack of language around how to talk to others about a women\u2019s health condition.\n\n\u201cEven between other women, just saying, \u2018My hormones at the moment mean that I don\u2019t feel like myself.\u2019 How do we talk about that?\n\n\u201cThe thing that has really hit me with all this, is that mood isn\u2019t just depression and anxiety. It sits so much within your hormones and broader health. That our experience of those things, as women, are so interrelated with our hormones \u2013 and we just don\u2019t talk about it. It\u2019s because it\u2019s women\u2019s health.\u201d\n\nKulkarni agrees and says awareness needs to be raised nationally around women\u2019s mental health: \u201cThe thing is, women\u2019s mental health is not a national priority \u2013 and it should be.\u201d\n\n* Name has been changed", "description": "Premenstrual dysphoric disorder, only recently recognised, can cripple women emotionally, physically and mentally", "authors": ["Michelle Henderson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c127080ff763a890ac01ce89a7f726e0c2658ba/0_388_2365_1419/master/2365.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1200963d92abaf3e6567acfd55bbf22e", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
