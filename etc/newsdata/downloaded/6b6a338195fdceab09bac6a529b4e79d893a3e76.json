A majority expect the global economy to enter a recession by 2020, with the highest percentage of gloomy respondents in emerging markets. About 42 per cent of family offices around the world are raising cash reserves.\n\n\u2018MORE CAUTION'\n\n\"There's more caution and fear of the public equity markets among ultra-high-net-worth investors,\" said Timothy O'Hara, president of Rockefeller Global Family Office. \"That has more people thinking about private investments, alternative investments or cash.\"\n\nJeffrey Gundlach, chief investment officer of DoubleLine Capital, said this month he thinks there's a 75 per cent chance of a US recession before the November 2020 presidential election, while economists surveyed by Bloomberg in August predicted a 35 per cent chance in the next 12 months, up four percentage points from a month earlier. Meanwhile, the World Bank cut its 2019 global forecast to the slowest since the financial crisis a decade ago.\n\nFamily offices have become a greater force in global financial markets. Campden estimates that such firms manage around US$5.9 trillion. The offices in the UBS survey had an average of US$917 million under management.\n\nInvesting results have been mixed for those responding to the questionnaire, which was conducted between February and March. Average family-office returns for the 12 months prior to taking the survey were 5.4 per cent, according to UBS. Developed-market equities were a big disappointment, providing an average 2.1 per cent return. The highest average gains - 6.2 per cent - were for family offices in the Asia-Pacific and emerging markets regions, followed by 5.9 per cent in North America and 4.3 per cent in Europe.\n\nSTAR ASSET\n\nPrivate equity was the star asset class, with an average return of 16 per cent for direct investments and 11 per cent for funds-based investing. Real estate also performed well, returning an average 9.4 per cent, and now makes up 17 per cent of the average family-office portfolio, up 2.1 percentage points from last year's survey. In the year ahead, 46 per cent of families said they plan to put more money in direct private equity investments, with 42 per cent devoting more to private equity funds and 34 per cent funneling more into real estate, according to the survey.\n\nFamily offices are also increasingly focused on a different kind of potential disruption: succession planning. This year, 54 per cent of those surveyed said they have a succession plan in place, up from 43 per cent last year. Just one-third of global family offices, however, said they have written plans.\n\nBLOOMBERG", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Banking & Finance - [NEW YORK] Rick Stone, a former partner at Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, sees treacherous times ahead for family offices trying to deploy cash. .
