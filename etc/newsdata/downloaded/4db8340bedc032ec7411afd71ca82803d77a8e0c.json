If it was unwatchable, though, it wasn\u2019t unwatchable enough for some. The Columbia Journalism Review\u2019s \u201cpublic editor for CNN,\u201d Emily Tamkin, beforehand insisted that moderators should proceed \u201con the assumption that the climate is in crisis,\u201d and limit themselves to calling for action and faulting inaction.\n\nIn other words, make it an exercise in liturgy, not inquiry, as well as a repetition of the most failed experiment in history: trying to bully viewers into accepting predictions of a pending climate disaster.\n\nAll this comes as the sixth \u201cassessment report\u201d of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, still two years off, is likely to offer nothing new on the vexed, contentious 40-year-old stalemate over how much warming actually can be expected from a given amount of CO2.\n\nIt comes just days after the shocking suicide of Harvard climate economist Martin Weitzman, rightly praised in obituaries for an insight lacking in the CNN town hall: A climate disaster is far from guaranteed. It\u2019s the low but not insignificant chance of a \u201cfat tail\u201d worst-case disaster that we should worry about. (Mr. Weitzman put the odds at 3% to 10%.)\n\nIt comes as Weitzman\u2019s student, collaborator and co-author, Gernot Wagner, tellingly has focused his own attention lately on geoengineering rather than the seemingly lost cause of carbon reduction.\n\nWords hardly serve to describe the mediocrity of climate journalism, including CNN\u2019s. But at least Elizabeth Warren had an interesting moment when she admonished a network personality for trying to rile up viewers \u201caround your light bulbs, around your straws and around your cheeseburgers.\u201d\n\nShe might also have mentioned electric cars as another distraction, like all of the above promoted by greens themselves to fill a need for policy \u201cvictories\u201d no matter how trivial in relation to an alleged climate problem.\n\nAs the New York Times also noted, \u201cFor the first time, Ms. Warren explicitly embraced a carbon tax before quickly pivoting away . . .\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s Ms. Warren afraid of? A carbon tax would hardly be prohibitive. Weitzman advocated $40 a ton\u2014the equivalent of 36 cents per gallon of gasoline. Such a tax could be implemented without raising the overall tax burden; it could be used to trim taxes on work, saving and investment, improving the economy overall. It could be embraced and copied by other nations out of self-interest rather than self-abnegation (unlike the absurd Green New Deal).\n\nHow did such a modest and potentially beneficial adjustment to the tax code become virtually undiscussable?\n\nOpinion Live: America\u2019s Political Realignment and the 2020 Election Join Paul Gigot in Los Angeles on Wednesday, October 1 for a discussion with Opinion columnists and political experts on the current state of the 2020 election field. Register with WSJ+.\n\nThe blame obviously can\u2019t be laid entirely at the feet of climate press. There is much else going on, in which journalists are but lockstep automatons. And here it is: With their decision to resort to a strategy of hysterical exaggerations, vilifications and hackneyed partisanship, the greens have now succeeded in convincing voting publics that any climate strategy must be catastrophic to their lifestyles, transferring trillions from their pockets to green special interests.\n\nWorse, voters are right. Many climate campaigners are more interested in social revolution than in climate science. Some are more interested in expressing their craving for humanity\u2019s death and engaging in apocalyptic playacting than in improving the human condition.\n\nSo to answer CNN\u2019s non-debate and the worries of the late Prof. Weitzman, if the small but not negligible chance of a climate catastrophe is borne out, we already know what the answer is going to be: to throw a bunch of particles into the atmosphere, at a cost of perhaps $2 billion a year, in order to block the estimated 1% of sunlight necessary to keep earth\u2019s temperature in check.\n\nAnd everybody across the scientific spectrum understands this is where we are headed. How this reality could go unmentioned in seven hours on CNN is explicable only by the debate not being a debate.\n\nOne more point: When and if the IPCC resolves its manifest struggles over climate sensitivity (i.e., how much warming can be expected), the result will necessarily be to reduce uncertainty regarding the great chemistry experiment in the atmosphere. Therefore it will reduce, or at least reframe, the fat-tail risk that Weitzman\u2019s followers worry about today, which is largely a product of unresolved and proliferating uncertainties in today\u2019s highly inadequate climate models.", "description": "Hint to green media: Voters might actually be more prone to act if told the truth instead of lies.", "authors": ["Holman W.
