As the rest of his Arsenal team-mates were showering and changing following their dismantling of Standard Liege, Aubameyang was revving the engine of his latest supercar in the bowels of the Emirates, cruising around the car park beneath the ground before returning to the players\u2019 lounge.\n\nEven if they could not see him, lounging behind the wheel of a Ferrari that has been wrapped in \u201cholographic chrome\u201d, anyone in the vicinity would have certainly heard him coming. Given the noise, it would not have been a surprise if those still inside the ground had heard him too.\n\nAubameyang, it seems, does not do low-key exits. Or entrances. Or anything at all, for that matter, whether it is the cars he drives, the clothes he wears or, as was the case last week, the tweets he sends. There is no shortage of moneyed Premier League footballers but Aubameyang is perhaps the most flash and brash of the lot.\n\nThe appearances are dazzling, then, but they are also deceiving. On the outside, he comes across as ostentatious and flamboyant. Within the club, though, he is increasingly one of the most grounded and supportive members of Unai Emery\u2019s first team.
