The answer is usually no.\n\nThe All Blacks are the most powerful national side the sport has ever seen. They have won the World Cup three times and are heavy favorites to make it four. The last time New Zealand lost a match at this tournament, most of the current team was in middle school.\n\nSo in order to close the gap on the Kiwis, national teams around the world turn to the most Kiwi thing they can think of: they hire Kiwi coaches. When the World Cup kicks off on Friday, seven of the 20 national team coaches will be from New Zealand, along with at least a dozen assistants.\n\nFor a country at the end of the world that occasionally gets left off maps, this is better than usual representation. With a population of 4.8 million people, that means roughly 1 in every 700,000 New Zealanders is leading a team at this Rugby World Cup. And most of them are facing impossible odds. The non-New Zealand teams in the hands of New Zealanders include Fiji, Georgia, Ireland, Samoa, Wales and the host nation Japan.\n\n\u201cTrying to do things that no one else has ever done before is a hallmark of what New Zealand people are about,\u201d All Blacks coach Steven Hansen said. \u201cWe came away from the home shores and settled in a country at the bottom of the earth.\u201d\n\nNew Zealand All Blacks coach Steve Hansen, center, watches his players during a training session at Kashiwanoha Park Stadium.

If you were competing at the World Cup of croissants, you would probably want a French coach. And if you\u2019re a nation competing at the World Cup of rugby\u2014and you don\u2019t have historical beef with New Zealand\u2014then the logic is the same: You want a New Zealander.\n\nThe sport may have been invented on the playing fields of England, but no one has perfected the game like the All Blacks. Their all-time win rate is 77%. The team combines style, athleticism, and attacking creativity in a way that makes them electric to watch and automatic favorites no matter who they\u2019re playing.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Are you planning to watch the Rugby World Cup? Which team are you rooting for? Join the conversation below.\n\nYet few other sports have seen the same kind of coaching diaspora. Even last year\u2019s World Baseball Classic\u2014perhaps the most American tournament in international sports\u2014featured a lower percentage of U.S.-born managers than the Rugby World Cup\u2019s 35% of Kiwi coaches.\n\nThis stampede across international rugby isn\u2019t happening in a vacuum. It\u2019s a consequence of the already Kiwi-packed club game, where New Zealand-born coaches are as popular as post-match beers. In the past season of Super Rugby, the league that brings together the top teams in the Southern Hemisphere, eight of the 15 coaches were Kiwis. Even its Northern Hemisphere equivalent, the European Rugby Champions Cup, saw a quarter of the teams led by New Zealanders.\n\nBut on the international stage, Kiwi coaching can take you only so far if you don\u2019t have Kiwi players. Tonga, for instance, which has former All Black Dan Cron for an assistant coach, received a violent reminder of that against New Zealand earlier this month.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big motivating factor when you lose 92-7,\u201d said Cron, whose father is the All Blacks\u2019 forwards coach. \u201cPlayers don\u2019t like losing by that much, especially when it\u2019s on national television.\u201d\n\nWales coach Warren Gatland looks on as players warm up before a match.

Joe Schmidt and Warren Gatland, in charge of Ireland and Wales, respectively, are exceptions rather than the rule. More typical is World Cup host Japan. The tournament hosts hired former All Black Jamie Joseph in 2016 in the hopes of advancing from the World Cup group stage for the first time in its history.\n\n\u201cOur game is based around speed, skill and structure,\u201d said Joseph. \u201cBut the key difference this year is we are fit enough now to play that game. We\u2019re training at a level of intensity that\u2019s 25% higher than our matches. I think that\u2019s our key weapon.\u201d\n\nWhere many countries may never catch the All Blacks is on the talent production front. New Zealand\u2019s pipeline never seems to run dry. By the time they pull on the hallowed black jersey, young players are already versed in the All Blacks\u2019 style at the All Blacks\u2019 level of excellence. In a place with barely the population of Alabama, the coaching at all levels has plenty to do with it.\n\nJoe Schmidt, right, leads Ireland\u2019s squad.

Even though rugby participation has fallen behind soccer, according to a study by Sport New Zealand, it still attracts the cream of all youth athletes. Few things mean more in New Zealand than receiving a call-up to the All Blacks, where every player ever to represent the team has a unique number stitched into his jersey. This is an outfit for whom every defeat is catastrophic. For all of its exported rugby knowledge, New Zealand knows that no one can match the demands it places on its own national team.\n\n\u201cThe World Cup is the biggest stage for rugby but I know definitely for me, there\u2019s always pressure on a black jersey,\u201d All Blacks center Anton Lienert-Brown said. \u201cWe\u2019re always expected not just to win, but to win well.\u201d\n\nThe irony is in how many of the people plotting to stop them happen to hold the same passport.\n\nWrite to Joshua Robinson at joshua.robinson@wsj.com", "description": "New Zealanders, preaching the world\u2019s most successful rugby gospel, are in charge of seven of the tournament\u2019s 20 teams.", "authors": ["Joshua Robinson"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-108038/social", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
