The sci-fi actioner helmed by Ang Lee is likely to bank a $75 million loss, according to The Hollywood Reporter on Sunday\n\nThe trade reported that the movie cost about $140 million to make and an additional $100 million was spent on marketing.\n\nHowever, Gemini Man was a box office bust when it opened in North America a week ago, debuting with just $20 million.\n\nIt only grossed a paltry $8.5 million on its second weekend.\n\nPricey: In Gemini Man, Smith stars as an elite assassin who faces off against his younger self.
