It was quite a nice break, actually.\n\nThe exterior of the Hofburg is more Instagrammable than what\u2019s inside anyway.\n\nsource Insider/Rachel Hosie\n\nHow cute is this building complete with horse and carriage? Utterly charming. And no one could stop me photographing it.\n\nFounded in 1880, Cafe Sperl is one of Vienna\u2019s oldest, most famous, and most traditional coffee houses, but it was given one star and criticized for its \u201carrogant service\u201d on TripAdvisor.\n\nsource TripAdvisor\n\nVienna is known for its coffee scene, but it\u2019s true that the city\u2019s waiters don\u2019t have the friendliest reputation.\n\nViennese coffee culture is all about sitting in cafes for hours, whiling the day away in a charming and old-fashioned setting. And Cafe Sperl has this in buckets.\n\nsource Insider/Rachel Hosie\n\nIt\u2019s found in a traditional Viennese building not far from the Museums Quarter.\n\nCoffee is taken very seriously in Cafe Sperl, as you can probably glean from the length of the coffee menu.\n\nsource Insider/Rachel Hosie\n\nForget flat whites or pumpkin spice lattes, here you\u2019ll find an Obermayer (a double mocha with whipped cream on an inverted spoon) and an \u00dcberst\u00fcrzter Neumann (whipped cream covered with a double mocha), alongside more simple coffees.\n\nThe prices are a lot more reasonable than some of Vienna\u2019s other famous old-fashioned cafes, starting from \u20ac2.90 ($3.20) for a small mocha.\n\nRead more: I visited the 2 prestigious Viennese cafes that have been feuding over who makes the best chocolate cake for 2 centuries, and I know which one I\u2019d go back to\n\nThe interior of the cafe is simultaneously grand, unfancy, and somewhat eclectic.\n\nsource Insider/Rachel Hosie\n\nIt\u2019s very old-fashioned and classic Viennese in style, which I found utterly charming. You almost feel like you\u2019ve been taken back in time to the 19th century.\n\nThere\u2019s lots of deep mahogany and chandeliers, magazines and newspapers laid out for guests to flick through, and the waiting staff were very friendly.\n\nIt\u2019s unpretentious, has a lot of character, and guests are encouraged to enjoy the ambience.\n\nI ordered a pot of coffee (\u20ac5.30/$5.90) which came in branded chinaware.\n\nsource Insider/Rachel Hosie\n\nAs for the waiting staff, I didn\u2019t find them even remotely arrogant. In fact, the waiter who served me was delightful. He attended to me immediately and even humored me by speaking to me in German even though I am clearly British (I was once told by Germans that my accent is \u201cendearing\u201d).\n\nThe most visited museum in Vienna, the Leopold Museum, is chock-full of Austrian modern art. Five floors worth of art, in fact. But some people reviewed it on Google Reviews as being too expensive and boring.\n\nsource Google Reviews\n\nAn adult ticket costs \u20ac14 ($15.50), and I had to pay a further euro to check my backpack in as I was told it was too big to take around the exhibitions.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not an \u201cart person.\u201d Going to galleries and museums is never really a priority for me when travelling, but I decided to pay a visit to the Leopold Museum to see whether the harsh reviews could really be accurate.\n\nsource Insider/Rachel Hosie\n\nI was surprised to find I actually rather enjoyed it.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s some pretty nice stuff in here tbh,\u201d I wrote in my notes. High praise indeed coming from not an art person.\n\nThere was something lovely and peaceful about the museum, and I particularly liked the Olga Wisinger-Florian collection (below).\n\nsource Insider/Rachel Hosie\n\nI didn\u2019t look around the whole museum (five floors of art is too much art for me), so arguably I could have got more out of the money I spent on my ticket, but I don\u2019t think the price is outrageous by any means.\n\nAnd actually, you don\u2019t have to \u201clike museums\u201d \u2013 as a general rule, I don\u2019t. But I did like the Leopold Museum.\n\nVienna\u2019s Museums Quarter is \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 home to the city\u2019s main museums. One reviewer described it on Google Review as \u201can uncomfortable concrete jungle with no feel-good factor.\u201d\n\nsource Google Reviews\n\nIt centers around a big, open pedestrianized square, which is lined by a mixture of modern and classic architecture.\n\nIt\u2019s true, there are some concrete buildings in the Museums Quarter, such as the Viennese modern art museum (below).\n\nsource Insider/Rachel Hosie\n\nBut I found the modern buildings a welcome contrast to the grand architecture found, well, everywhere else in Vienna.\n\nIt\u2019s not all modern, either. As well as all the main museums, there are cafes, shops, and creative installations.\n\nsource Insider/Rachel Hosie\n\nIt\u2019s a pretty trendy area, and on a sunny afternoon in October it was full of people sitting outside.\n\nQuite what the reviewer meant by \u201cuncomfortable\u201d was unclear to me.\n\nsource Insider/Rachel Hosie\n\nThere are these colorful lounger-esque seats which people would presumably lie on in fair weather, but when I was there they were wet so I gave them a miss.\n\nI did, however, sit on a perfectly fine wooden bench one evening. It wasn\u2019t particularly uncomfortable or comfortable really. Because it was just a wooden bench.\n\nsource Insider/Rachel Hosie\n\nThe atmosphere in the Museums Quarter wasn\u2019t even slightly uncomfortable either \u2013 I actually found it to be quite a calm area of the city.\n\nVienna\u2019s iconic ferris wheel is found in Prater Park, in the middle of what can only be surprised as the city\u2019s answer to Disneyland. However, one person described the Riesenrad as being \u201ctotally boring\u201d on Google Reviews.\n\nsource Google Reviews\n\nAnother reviewer on the same platform wrote that it \u201conly goes round once and is super slow,\u201d adding that \u201cthere\u2019s too much light,\u201d you \u201ccan\u2019t get a good view,\u201d and it\u2019s a \u201crip-off.\u201d\n\nAs I made my way to the ferris wheel, I couldn\u2019t help but think that anyone who thought it would be quick clearly hadn\u2019t even looked at it beforehand.\n\nsource Insider/Rachel Hosie\n\nYou can see the wheel moving slowly, so you really do know what you\u2019re getting yourself into.\n\nThe cabins on the ferris wheel are in fact cute little huts, and a ticket costs \u20ac12 ($13), which to be fair is a little on the steep side.\n\nsource Insider/Rachel Hosie\n\nI barely had to wait before it was my turn to take the trip, which lasted around 15 minutes.\n\nYes, it moves slowly. But the ferris wheel isn\u2019t meant to be a theme park ride. It would be horrid if it was fast. I was a big fan of the snail\u2019s pace as it gave me plenty of time to savor the view. Speaking of which\u2026\n\n\u2026There are lots of reviews on TripAdvisor which say the views from the ferris wheel are \u201cdisappointing.\u201d\n\nsource TripAdvisor\n\nVarious people have written that you don\u2019t get any view of Vienna from the wheel.\n\nThis is just straight-up fake news.\n\ncaption The view over Vienna and Prater Park from the Riesenrad. source Insider/Rachel Hosie\n\nThe views you get from Prater Park \u2013 whether from the ferris wheel or another of the amusements \u2013 are incredible, and you see across pretty much the whole city.\n\nThe views were in fact breathtaking, particularly with the trees being in all their early autumn glory.\n\nsource Insider/Rachel Hosie\n\nI have to hand it to the Vienna tourist board, they\u2019re onto something with this campaign.\n\nI was mindblown by the things people criticize on online review sites, and the minor \u201cissues\u201d with which people take umbrage.\n\nConsidering so many people take ratings on review websites as gospel, the campaign serves as a good reminder that, actually, what\u2019s \u201crubbish\u201d to one person is breathtaking to another.\n\nThe experience may not stop me from using sites like TripAdvisor completely \u2013 they\u2019re a good way of finding out what attractions are in a city.\n\nHowever, I learned that you should never plan a trip based on online reviews, because we all like to do different things when we travel.\n\nI might even go to another art museum on my next city break \u2013 who knows?\n\nRead more:\n\nA luxury travel company is hiring someone to stay in lavish homes around the world for $2,500 a week\n\nInside Qantas\u2019 new first class suites, which come with pre-flight facials, all-you-can-drink kombucha, and designer \u2018sleeper suits\u2019\n\nI spent an afternoon exploring Peckham, the London neighborhood that was just voted one of the coolest in the world \u2013 and I found 2 different communities living side-by-side", "description": "Business Insider - A romantic boat ride on the Old Danube river was decried as \"boooring,\" and a charming, authentic wine tavern was criticized for not having backrests..
