Those living in the Chiba and Kawasaki prefectures were advised to evacuate on Saturday morning where possible.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBefore the tournament got underway, World Rugby chief executive Brett Gosper declared that Japan 2019 will draw in the highest revenues through ticket sales so far, with the \u00a3360m total surpassing the \u00a3333m accrued at England 2015. Though money from ticket sales goes to the host organisers, World Rugby will earn substantial figures through broadcasting rights, sponsorship and other commercial revenues, according to their financial statements.\n\nHowever, their profits \u2013 described as \u201csurplus\u201d \u2013 are expected to drop from the \u00a3163m drawn from 2015 due to additional organisational costs, and with these match cancellations now impacting all broadcasters, sponsors and commercial partners \u2013 as well as full tickets refunds \u2013 costs are set to spiral well beyond the \u00a330m barrier.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

That was just the start of the ordeal, with Hagibis not due to make landfall until the evening, where winds up to 150mph will batter the capital and the surrounding area.\n\nScotland are also intent for the match to go ahead given their knockout-stage hopes rely on victory, but if World Rugby\u2019s efforts to deliver the fixture \u2013 behind closed doors if necessary \u2013 fall short, costs are likely to surge towards the \u00a350m barrier.\n\nA stadium inspection will take place on Sunday morning as early as possible, where the first task will be to assess the damage caused by Hagibis and decide whether the game can be safely held. If the fixture gets the green light, the second task will be to decide if it is safe for fans to attend.\n\nA World Rugby spokesman said: \u201cOur primary consideration is the safety of everyone. We will undertake detailed venue inspections as soon as practically possible after the Typhoon has passed and an update will be published as soon as that process has been undertaken in the morning.\n\n\u201cOur message to fans continues to be stay indoors today, stay safe and monitor official Rugby World Cup social and digital channels.\u201d", "description": "World Rugby\u2019s decision to cancel two games at the Rugby World Cup is set to cost millions, and if Sunday\u2019s decider between Japan\u00a0and Scotland\u00a0fails to go ahead, more than \u00a320m will be shelled out to fans in ticket refunds.", "authors": ["Jack De Menezes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/12/05/yojohama-stadium.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
