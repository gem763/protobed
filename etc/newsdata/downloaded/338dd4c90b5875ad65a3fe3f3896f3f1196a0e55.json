Did you like that?\u201d She thanked him and then laughed: \u201cIt was a first.\u201d\n\nDeadly Games husband and wife shock divorce\n\nCircus performer Alfredo Silva and his wife Aleksandra Kiedrowicz have had viewers covering their eyes with their death defying knife throwing act on BGT The Champions.\n\nBut Alfredo originally performed the act in America with his ex wife Anna Silva before they announced to devastated fans that they were divorcing.\n\n(Image: NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images)\n\nIn a lengthy Instagram post, Alfredo wrote: \"Even tho Anna and I are not together as husband and wife anymore we were able to get the recognition of most people and one in especial @heidiklum that gave us the golden buzzer\".\n\nHe continued: \"Anna and I we\u2019ve chosen not to go public with our separation for personal reasons and I\u2019m sure you all will understand and respect our decision\".\n\nRIP Pudsey\n\nAn act we won't be seeing any more of is Ashleigh and Pudsey - the dog and owner act that won the sixth series of the show.\n\nAs the first dog act to win the competition, the much loved Pudsey stole viewers hearts in 2012 and even later starred in his very own film titled Pudsey: The Movie.\n\n(Image: Ken McKay / Rex Features)\n\nPudsey died in July 2017, and while Ashleigh now performs with another dog called Sully, she said he would \"never become Pudsey\".\n\nHollie Steele's tearful breakdown\n\nWhen ten year old Hollie performed in the show in 2009, it was agonising to watch her complete melt down as she forgot the words to her song.\n\nVisibly shaking and crying, Hollie fled from the stage to her mother - leaving viewers questioning whether the pressure of the show was simply too much for someone so young.\n\n(Image: screen grab)\n\n(Image: screen grab)\n\nShe begged for another chance to perform - and producers initially said no, leaving Hollie in turmoil.\n\nShe was eventually allowed to attempt her performance again at the end of the show - but viewers were still outraged at the debacle, claiming she was being exploited.\n\nDiversity struck by tragedy\n\nStreet dance troupe Diversity won the third series of BGT in 2009, beating runner up Susan Boyle. The group still perform together - but in 2017 they were struck by a terrible tragedy.\n\nFormer member Robert Anker was killed in a car crash in Canada age 27. He had moved to Canada to be with his fiance and Diversity's fame was making his career skyrocket.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nThe remaining members of the troupe tweeted: \"A former member of our group has tragically passed away. He inspired so many with his talent and was taken far too soon. R.I.P Rob\"\n\nRaunchy strippers confuse kids\n\nKeri Graham caused complaints during her audition when she stripped down to a skimpy outfit and gave Simon Cowell a saucy lap dance.\n\nThe act drew online criticism from some viewers, and one fumed on Twitter : \u201cNice family viewing as your child asks \u2019Mummy why has that lady got hardly any clothes on, and what is she doing with those men?\u2019.\u201d\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nThe show also came under fire when burlesque performer Beatrix Von Bourbon performed a dance so steamy viewers headed to Ofcom in their droves.\n\nMore than 70 viewers complained it was unsuitable for a family show watched by millions of children.", "description": "Britain's Got Talent has seen its fair share of controversial scandals and has even been marred by tragedy over the years - here's a round up of the most shocking moments", "authors": ["Verity Sulway", "Image", "Ken Mckay Rex Features", "Itv", "Dymond", "Syco", "Thames", "Corbis", "Pa", "Nbcu Photo Bank Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article8045775.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Jessica-Hobson.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
