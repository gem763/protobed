The first paid him just \u00a312 a month and the other \u00a348.\n\nColin, 71, who lives in Tredegar, South Wales, with his wife Eirwen, also 71, wanted to cash in his annuities to pay for train journeys to see his son's family in Watford.\n\nHe says: 'I worked out I could have at least 28 journeys with a lump sum. But if I continued to receive \u00a39 a month, I'd have had to live to 108 to recoup enough for those journeys.'\n\nColin, who worked for the National Coal Board, wrote to ReAssure in 2016 to ask about cashing in the smaller annuity.\n\nBut ReAssure refused, and warned there were 'significant risks'. The following year, Colin pointed out Phoenix Life had allowed customers to cash in annuities.\n\nBut ReAssure said Phoenix was only doing this for customers with pots worth less than \u00a32,000.\n\nHere's how you can do it Dear [Your MP] CC: [Your annuity provider] Re: [Your annuity policy number] I am writing in the hope that you will help me win back my pension savings. I would benefit far more from having a lump sum than the [amount in \u00a3s] monthly income I receive from my annuity. But, while some annuity providers have offered a lump sum to their customers, mine has refused. I should be trusted to make my own decision about how I receive my pension. Annuity firms should be required to provide me with the details I need to make an informed decision. All I ask for is a chance to access my savings like people retiring today can do under the pension freedoms. Yours sincerely, Signed Print name, Address\n\nColin persevered. He wrote to ReAssure chief executive Matthew Cuhls in February last year, saying: 'It surely cannot be morally justifiable to tie me into a worthless annuity.'\n\nAnd he wrote to the boss again to say: 'I consider myself qualified to make my own decision on a \u00a39-a-month annuity.'\n\nColin then enlisted the help of his MP, Nick Smith, who made direct approaches to the Chancellor and the Financial Conduct Authority.\n\nFinally, Colin's persistence paid off. Last October, he got a call from ReAssure offering him \u00a32,361 for the annuity.\n\nHe then received \u00a31,889 after 20 per cent income tax. Colin then set his sights on his second policy. But ReAssure refused.\n\nHe again wrote to the chief executive to ask why and last December, the firm finally agreed to pay him a lump sum of \u00a38,557. He received \u00a36,846 after tax.\n\nColin hopes he has paved the way for other pensioners.\n\nDeryck Waterhouse, 69, receives just \u00a37 a month from a ReAssure annuity. But the firm has twice refused to let him cash in the annuity.\n\nDeryck, who lives with wife Joyce in Hardwicke near Gloucester, says he was encouraged by Colin's victory, and adds: 'You have to keep battling at it. At the end of the day it is my money and they are in control of it.'\n\nValerie Hamilton, 65, receives \u00a343 a month from her late husband Allan's ReAssure annuity.\n\nBut the firm has refused to let her cash it in. Valerie, from Christchurch in Dorset, says Colin's story had given her hope. She says: 'Things are really tough, I have used up all my savings.'\n\nA ReAssure spokesman says annuities were not designed to be converted into a lump sum, adding: 'This makes it very difficult to ensure customers would receive a fair value when converting these annuities into a cash lump sum.'\n\nb.wilkinson@dailymail.co.uk", "description": "Retired civil engineer Colin Jones, 71, pictured with wife Eirwen, pestered his provider repeatedly and recruited his local MP in his two-year fight to win back his pension pot from annuity firm ReAssure.", "authors": ["Ben Wilkinson For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
