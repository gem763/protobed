Iran-aligned Houthi rebels claimed the attack. Iran has denied carrying it out.\n\n\u201cThere are indications that it was a state attack and there was a level of equipment that suggests it wasn\u2019t the Houthi rebels,\u201d Macron said.\n\nHe said his meetings with Trump and Rouhani was aimed at pursuing recent French efforts to bring all sides to the table for a new negotiation.\n\n\u201cThe strikes ... are a turning point and the desire of France to mediate and its proposals remain relevant to de-escalate,\u201d he said, adding that he would do everything to try to create conditions for discussions between the United States and Iran.", "description": "French President Emmanuel Macron said he would meet Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Monday and U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday as he seeks to defuse tensions between Washington and Tehran.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1433055339&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M1SW", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
