He went to Hong Kong in 1964 as a teenager, when Taiwan was under martial law.\n\n\"I tried to capture the things I remember and the ways that people lived,\" Yonfan said.\n\n\"When I arrived in Hong Kong I literally smell the air of freedom, the wind blows from the ocean I smell the freedom in it, it was marvellous.\"\n\nYonfan was asked about the anti-government movement which has plunged Hong Kong into its biggest political crisis in decades.\n\nThe unrest began in mid-June, fuelled by anger over a now-suspended extradition bill that would have allowed people in the city to be sent to mainland China for trial in courts controlled by the Communist Party.\n\nIt has evolved into calls for greater democracy under the \"one country, two systems\" formula, by which Hong Kong has been ruled since 1997, guaranteeing freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland.\n\nRecalling how Hong Kong \"was turning upside down\" during the 1967 riots, Yonfan said he hoped it \"can be back to normal\".\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Marie-Louise Gumuchian and Sarah Mills; Editing by Alison Williams)", "description": "Chinese filmmaker Yonfan says his animation \"No. 7 Cherry Lane\" is his love letter to Hong Kong, in which he tells a tale of romance set in the late 1960s.
