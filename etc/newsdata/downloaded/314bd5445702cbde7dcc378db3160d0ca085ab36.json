Rather, if I wanted to stop score-keeping with Seth and have him \u201cown\u201d some share of responsibility for all it takes to make our life happen, I had to stop sneaking around in the middle of the night, elfin-like, silently and magically making stuff happen. If I expected Seth to be an informed partner, well then, I needed to first treat him like one by making the full breadth of what I did for our family visible. You can\u2019t value what you don\u2019t see, right? And neither could Seth. And my girlfriends couldn\u2019t expect their men to value it either. But \u2026 if our partners recognized the small and large details that go into keeping the ship afloat, maybe they\u2019d appreciate all that we do. Heck, maybe they\u2019d even volunteer to take a few things off our lists.", "description": "An excerpt from Eve Rodsky\u2019s recently released book, \u2018Fair Play\u2019", "authors": ["Eve Rodsky", "Eve Rodsky Is The Author Of", "Fair Play", "A Game-Changing Solution For When You Have Too Much To Do", "More Life To Live ."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/4r0DSd3glSfK_pLzg9dF_8PA0pM=/1200x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-thelily-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MNK457NSBJCNHJ6GNRSU5EBK6M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
