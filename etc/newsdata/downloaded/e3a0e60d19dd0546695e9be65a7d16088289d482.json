(Steve Helber/AP)\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s plan to overhaul the country\u2019s housing finance system would make mortgages more expensive for minority borrowers and aspiring homeowners in the South, the Midwest and rural communities, according to fair housing and lending groups.\n\nThe plans, unveiled last week by the Treasury and Housing and Urban Development departments, would end government control of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which purchase mortgage loans and package them into securities that they guarantee. The proposal also recommends eliminating the mortgage backers\u2019 affordable housing goals and introducing competition that experts say could further reduce access to credit for low-income communities.\n\n\u201cThis plan would interject new entities that would cream the market by seeking to serve the most lucrative regions and borrowers,\u201d such as New York and San Francisco, where home values have skyrocketed, said Nikitra Bailey, executive vice president of the Center for Responsible Lending. \u201cThe very communities that need greater access to mortgage credit \u2014 communities of color, specifically \u2014 would have great difficulty securing credit.\u201d\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, HUD Secretary Ben Carson, and Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Mark Calabria defended the housing proposals before the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee on Tuesday.\n\nTrump has been briefed on the reports and accepted them, Mnuchin said.\n\n[HUD raises the bar for bringing discrimination claims]\n\nThe centerpiece of the administration\u2019s plans call for releasing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from government control 11 years after they were bailed out by taxpayers. They have continued to play a critical role in sustaining the U.S. housing market but don\u2019t have enough capital to operate as private companies again.\n\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac currently have a combined $6 billion in capital but should have about $100 billion, Mnuchin told the Senate panel. \u201cWe think they need a lot of capital,\u201d he said. The companies \u201ccould not operate today if not for the Treasury lines.\"\n\nUnder the administration\u2019s plan, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would pay a fee in exchange for a government guarantee backing their businesses. The plan is a potential windfall for hedge funds that have invested heavily in the companies\u2019 stocks. Those investors have argued for years that the companies should be released from government control, allowing their stock prices to rise.\n\nCongress is unlikely to pass sweeping housing legislation before the 2020 presidential election. But some senators said it should be a priority. \u201cThis whole thing is a car wreck. It\u2019s a dumpster fire,\u201d Sen. John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) said of the current system.\n\nMnuchin said last week that the administration is \u201ccommitted to promoting much needed reforms to the housing finance system that will protect taxpayers and help Americans who want to buy a home.\u201d\n\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which back half of the nation\u2019s mortgages, have a mandate to ensure access to affordable loans and are responsible for the broad availability of the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage.\n\nThe enterprises have had an obligation to make roughly a quarter of the mortgages they back to low-income borrowers, under affordable housing goals introduced in the 1990s and carried forward after entering into government conservatorship during the 2008 housing crash.\n\nBut the Trump administration has proposed replacing the affordable housing goals with a more \u201cefficient, transparent and accountable mechanism,\u201d such as a new fee that would be transferred to HUD to promote affordable housing activities. Many consumer and civil rights groups argue that the plan would not directly increase homeownership among low-income families.\n\n\u201cEssentially they are trying to shrink the government footprint in the market and introduce private guarantors that won\u2019t have the same obligations as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,\u201d said Jesse Van Tol, chief executive of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition.\n\nIn addition, housing advocates say, the administration\u2019s plan would lead to a bifurcated market that would block first-time home buyers and low-income borrowers, many of whom are people of color, from lower-cost conventional loans. Borrowers who cannot afford 20 percent down payments and have less-than-pristine credit scores would be channeled into more-expensive loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration, whose insurance premiums last for the life of the loan.\n\n\u201cThe magnitude of the impact is huge,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cThis continues the system where wealthier and mostly white families have access to affordable mortgage credit while keeping creditworthy families of color from accessing the mortgages they deserve.\u201d\n\nCarson on Tuesday blamed the lack of affordable housing on local restrictions related to zoning and rent control as well as neighborhood opposition. He disputed accusations from Democratic lawmakers that the Trump administration does not care about housing discrimination or housing for low-income and working-class families, citing a HUD investigation into San Francisco\u2019s policies on affordable housing.\n\n[Ben Carson\u2019s HUD dials back investigations into housing discrimination]\n\nThe housing finance proposals, much of which need congressional approval, come at a time when black homeownership hovers just above 40 percent \u2014 slightly lower than when the Fair Housing Act was passed in 1968. In comparison, white homeownership has increased in the past five decades to 73 percent.\n\n\u201cRather than create a system that addresses the needs of working families, the Trump administration has put out half-baked proposals that will make mortgages more expensive and harder to get,\" said Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), ranking Democratic member of the Banking Committee.\n\nBlack families were the hardest hit of any Americans during the 2008 housing crisis. African Americans, including those in upper-income black communities such as Prince George\u2019s County, were disproportionately targeted by predatory lenders during the housing boom and faced foreclosure at greater rates. Many of those borrowers qualified for less expensive credit on safer terms.\n\nAfter the recession, stricter credit restrictions made it harder for black families to qualify for mortgages.\n\n\u201cIn the middle of a housing affordability crisis, when the gap between the black and white homeownership rates is as big as it was when housing discrimination was legal, the Trump administration wants to make it harder for creditworthy working families \u2014 especially families of color \u2014 to buy a home and build wealth,\u201d Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said. \u201cThat\u2019s shameful.\u201d", "description": "The Trump administration\u2019s plan to overhaul the housing finance system would make mortgages more expensive for minority borrowers and aspiring homeowners in the South, the Midwest and rural communities, according to fair housing and lending groups.", "authors": ["Tracy Jan", "Reporter Covering The Intersection Of Race", "The Economy", "Renae Merle", "Reporter Covering White-Collar Crime", "Wall Street", "September At Pm", "Tracy Jan Covers The Intersection Of Race", "The Economy For The Washington Post.
