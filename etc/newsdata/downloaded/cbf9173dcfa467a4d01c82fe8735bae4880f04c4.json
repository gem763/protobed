Shares in the companies fell between 5% and 7% when the court ruling halting the scheme was announced last November.\n\nOfficials have said the Commission was confident the British plan was now compliant following an indepth investigation and that any legislative breach had been largely procedural.\n\nThree sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they expected a decision this month, although a delay was possible.\n\n\"There is a decision in the pipeline,\" one said.\n\nAnother said the Commission was keen to finalise the decision, given the amount of work done and the uncertainty surrounding Britain's departure from the European Union scheduled for Oct. 31. Although payments promised so far would be released, any future aid could have different conditions attached.\n\nThe British government has said that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, in which Britain leaves the bloc without further agreements, national legislation concerning state aid - under which capacity auctions take place - becomes law.\n\nSome non-governmental groups and those working in the industry are seeking to disrupt the scheme, which they say has illegally subsidised fossil fuels and made insufficient allowance for more innovative ways of providing support for the power grid.\n\nA final decision is expected from the European Court of Justice next year, and separate court action is taking place in Britain and in Poland over its capacity mechanism plans.", "description": "Exclusive: European Commission set to approve UK billion-pound power backup plan", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF930Y7_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
