Upon his return, James chastised Morey for jeopardizing James\u2019 financial interests, saying he \u201ccould have waited a week to send\u201d the tweet and accusing him of not being \u201ceducated\u201d on the protests. A week later, the situation on the ground in Hong Kong would not have changed, but James would not have been personally inconvenienced with questions regarding his business with the Communist Party.\n\nJames secured a lifetime sponsorship deal with Nike believed to be worth $1 billion; Nike has deep business ties to the Chinese Communist Party. He is also producing a sequel to the 1990s classic Space Jam that will have to pass Chinese Communist Party censors\u2019 standards to air in Chinese theaters.\n\nChina Daily applauded James protecting his personal interests and, in the process, those of the Communist Party, praising him for not \u201cplaying their game\u201d \u2013 referring to Western critics.\n\n\u201cOpinion elites were quick to condemn James for, irony of ironies, insufficient condemnation,\u201d China Daily claimed. \u201cThey wanted James to come out strong against China, to mirror their perspective on a country they\u2019ve designated as an enemy.\u201d\n\nThe newspaper compared criticism of James calling Morey uneducated for supporting a peaceful pro-democracy movement to the backlash against communist former football player Colin Kaepernick, also a Nike spokesman.\n\n\u201cA revolting hypocrisy is at work here. The same people who told James and former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick to \u2018shut up and play\u2019 when they took a stand against the killing of Black men by U.S. police are now demanding athletes speak out \u2014 but only if their opinions are the correct ones, of course,\u201d the propaganda outlet alleged. China Daily went on to repeat what has now become the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s main talking point on Beijing\u2019s campaign to silence all celebrities on the atrocities committing within China\u2019s borders: that America does not have real freedom of speech.\n\n\u201cNo matter what anyone says, this isn\u2019t about freedom of speech. That\u2019s just a fig leaf, a cover for policing discourse and narrowing the window of acceptable opinion so the only stances that fit are the ones in line with the US government,\u201d the newspaper claimed. \u201c\u2018Free speech\u2019 has never really been about the untrammeled right to say or do whatever one wants \u2014 the US created broad definitions of dissent to prosecute its critics throughout its history.\u201d\n\nThe evidence China Daily presented for America prosecuting dissenters was the 1798 Alien and Sedition Acts.\n\nRather than China\u2019s silencing of Morey warning famous Americans never to express public opinions on China being a threat to free speech, China Daily claimed that the organic public criticism of James is the real threat.\n\nUnlike dissenters in China \u2013 often disappeared into prisons without due process and cut open alive so the government can sell their organs on the black market \u2013 James has suffered no legal repercussions from expressing disagreement with Morey. His employer, the NBA, has also not censured him for his comments; the NBA has also vowed not to punish Morey, which has triggered outrage from the Chinese Communist Party.\n\n\u201cNo one in the major US media, not even James\u2019 few defenders, has entertained the notion he was speaking honestly. Besides the nasty racial connotations \u2014 think for a moment what a largely white media class devaluing a Black man\u2019s subjectivity implies \u2014 it sets a precedent,\u201d China Daily claimed. \u201cIf one of the most talented and popular athletes in the world has his statements dismissed when they don\u2019t conform to Western consensus, what does that mean for the rest of us?\u201d\n\nThe piece ends by encouraging James not to \u201cbuckle to pressure\u201d from American fans, and to instead buckle from pressure from the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nChina Daily\u2018s support for James follows threats this weekend coming from state broadcaster CCTV, which warned NBA Commissioner Adam Silver to fire Morey for expressing himself publicly or \u201creceive retribution sooner or later.\u201d CCTV expressed particular disdain for Silver because the commissioner had revealed last week that Chinese government officials pressured him to hurt Morey\u2019s career to teach the rest of his employees not to speak ill of the repressive Chinese regime, but Silver refused.\n\n\u201cWe were being asked to fire him by the Chinese government, by the parties we dealt with, government and business,\u201d Silver said on Thursday. \u201cWe said there\u2019s no chance that\u2019s happening. There\u2019s no chance we\u2019ll even discipline him.\u201d\n\nSilver had \u201ccrossed the bottom line by showing a lack of respect to Chinese,\u201d according to CCTV, and was \u201cinventing lies to dirty China.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce a person\u2019s morality goes wrong, he will receive retribution sooner or later,\u201d the broadcaster warned.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "China Daily claimed the backlash against LeBron James for standing with the Communist Party has \"nasty racial connotations.\"", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Getty-Images_Zhong-Zhi-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
