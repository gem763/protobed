It was really quite upsetting and quite horrible to watch.'\n\nMr Read said acacia, pine and sandalwood trees had also been dying amid the South Australian heatwave.\n\nHe said it was 'shocking' to learn that acacia - which had lived for hundreds of years - was dying.\n\nDespite the deaths of kangaroos in the eastern states, the numbers in Western Australia have boomed.\n\nWest Australia is not facing the same drought conditions as experienced elsewhere across the country.", "description": "Ecologists believe the prolonged drought has led to the mass deaths of the overabundant marsupial across South Australia.", "authors": ["Zoe Zaczek For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/03/19349176-0-image-a-23_1570327285373.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
