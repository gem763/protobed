But the creators of South Park didn\u2019t take the ban lying down and replied in short order by posting a fake apology to the Chinese, and further ridiculing their penchant to censor all entertainment.\n\n\u201cLike the NBA,\u201d the faux apology said, \u201cwe welcome the Chinese censors into our homes and into our hearts. We, too, love money more than freedom and democracy. Xi doesn\u2019t look just like Winnie the Pooh at all. Tune into our 300th episode this Wednesday at 10! Long live the Great Communist Party of China! May this autumn\u2019s sorghum harvest be bountiful! We good now, China?\u201d\n\nSeries creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone also posted another clip to slam China.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.", "description": "Zedd told fans that he was \"permanently banned\" in China for his supportive tweet for 'South Park's' episode about Chinese censorship.", "authors": ["Warner Todd Huston"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Zedd1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
