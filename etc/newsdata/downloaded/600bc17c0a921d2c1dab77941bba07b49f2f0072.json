The agency says the storm, which is edging closer to the coast, could even cause tornadoes Saturday in the central Florida Peninsula, along the Georgia coast and into the Carolinas.\n\nAfter hitting Florida, the storm is projected to \u201cmove offshore of the coast of North Carolina into the western Atlantic by late Sunday\u201d as a post-tropical cyclone, according to the NHC.\n\nNestor is currently about 80 miles west-southwest of Panama City, Fla., and 110 miles west of Apalachicola, Fla., according to a 7 a.m. forecast from the center. It\u2019s moving northeast at 17 mph, with maximum sustained winds at 50 mph. The storm is \u201crapidly losing\u201d its tropical characteristics, forecasters say, noting that they do not expect the storm to strengthen significantly as it moves inland later on Saturday.\n\nTropical storm force winds as #Nestor makes its way closer to #Apalachicola and the Florida Panhandle.
