In addition to possibly providing valuable assets for a retirement portfolio, RSUs can also play a role in how you manage your cash flow and credit liabilities, and even help in hitting financial milestones that you might have thought would be out of reach until much later. For some, that might mean extensive international travel. Where I\u2019m from in Seattle, it might also mean a cabin on an island like the one your grandparents owned when you were a kid.\n\nWhat is emerging with the growth of RSUs is a new way to look at portfolio management, retirement planning and investment structures, with the ultimate benefit of flexibility.\n\nRSU basics\n\nPopular in the tech industry, but more commonly available at companies in a range of industries, RSUs are offered to employees as part of their total compensation, alongside the typical package of salary, bonus, health benefits and more. Technically speaking, RSUs represent a contractual right to receive company shares or cash payment in the future. RSUs will \u201cvest\u201d at a predetermined date, such as a year, or commonly over three to four years, from the date of hire. That vesting date is when the employee takes ownership of these shares and can make decisions about how to use them. Each additional grant of RSUs has its own vesting schedule, so the more grants you (hopefully) receive, the more complicated it is to keep track of.\n\nRSUs and credit\n\nMost people are familiar with the idea of a home equity line of credit. What you might not know is that you can create your own line of credit from a taxable account with the help of RSUs. In other words, just like you can borrow against the value of your real estate, you can borrow against your vested shares with a flexible line of credit.\n\nYou might go this route to finance a down payment on a home, make a tuition payment for yourself or a child, pay for a wedding, or cover another major event or expense.\n\nRather than having to sell your stock, especially at a down point in the market, or putting those big-ticket items on your credit card at a high interest rate, you can borrow against your own assets and spread out the payments over time. Best of all, the interest rate may be substantially lower than that of other types of credit.\n\nLet\u2019s take that idea one step further. You might think selling RSUs to buy a home would be a simple exchange from one asset into another. But it is well worth considering all of the cash management possibilities here. With home loan rates still lingering at historic lows, around 3%, why sell RSUs that may appreciate and have to pay a capital-gains tax on top? Instead, you might choose to access your line of credit for the down payment, and use a home loan, taking advantage of writing off the interest on your taxes. This way you hang onto the RSUs and realize their value over time via a line of credit to invest in or buy/pay for something else. In this way, an often overlooked value of RSUs is how they open different avenues for managing your cash, credit and investment options in concert with one another.\n\nThis added flexibility is especially valuable in light of some of the more traditional ways you might be building wealth, like an IRA or 401(k) account. Not only are these inaccessible without significant tax consequences until retirement age, but you also typically cannot borrow against the money in these accounts.\n\nRSUs and taxes\n\nWhile I\u2019ve been extolling the virtues of RSUs, it\u2019s important to acknowledge that related tax issues can be tricky if they haven\u2019t been fully explained. For example, employees are often surprised that vested RSUs are treated and taxed as ordinary income in the tax year they vest.\n\nAnother surprise may come if you sell your shares within a year of them vesting. Any gains are considered short-term and are thus taxed as ordinary (earned) income\u2014much higher than if you hold the shares for a year or more before selling. At that point, you\u2019re into long-term capital gains territory and will only be taxed 20% on the realized gains.\n\nFor tax reasons, and in general, it\u2019s important to understand what\u2019s called the cost basis, or the original value, of your RSUs. Many recipients of RSUs don\u2019t realize that the day their shares vest is the day the cost basis is set. It\u2019s common for individual employees, personal accountants or even the company itself to record a zero cost basis, thinking of the shares as a gift. Later, the employee incorrectly pays taxes on the RSUs as a zero-value asset, a mistake that can really cost them come tax time, since they should have paid taxes on the actual value of the assets on the date vested.\n\nUnderstanding this from the outset, and knowing how sales of RSUs are treated for tax purposes, can help you avoid surprise tax bills and strategically plan out your tax liabilities.\n\nRSUs and your wealth\n\nOnce your RSU shares have vested, you own them. That means you can move them to another institution for safekeeping and/or to streamline your assets, cash them out, save them or give them as a gift. Consolidating your assets can help you and your financial adviser keep track of your important dates related to vesting and taxes, how they play into your personal financial plan, and the best plan of action for you personally.\n\nIf you\u2019re already fortunate enough to receive RSUs, be sure you understand all the ways they can help you achieve your short- and long-term financial goals. If you\u2019re looking to make a career move, I\u2019d encourage you to consider companies that offer stock as part of their compensation package.\n\nUsed to their full potential, RSUs can open up a world of possibilities in the present and still enable saving for the future.\n\nHeather Krause is senior vice president, financial adviser and assistant branch director, RBC Wealth Management \u2013 U.S.\n\nSecurities-based loans involve special risks and are not suitable for everyone.
