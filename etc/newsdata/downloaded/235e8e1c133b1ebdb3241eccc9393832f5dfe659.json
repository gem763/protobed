In a letter to shareholders, the company outlined a reversal of fortunes from its Q2 report, where the company reported a loss of 126,000 U.S. subscribers.\n\nHowever, the company\u2019s Q3 gains were nonetheless lower than its previous forecast of around 800,000 domestic net adds, and Netflix cited its recent price hikes as the reason its domestic subscriber growth has been slow in 2019.\n\nMore from IndieWire\n\n\u201cSince our U.S. price increase earlier this year, retention has not yet fully returned on a sustained basis to pre-price-change levels, which has led to slower U.S. membership growth,\u201d the company said in its Wednesday letter to shareholders.\u201d\n\nIt is possible that Netflix\u2019s recent price increase could be a problem point for the company in the months ahead, as new streaming services such as Disney+, Apple TV+, WarnerMedia\u2019s HBO Max, and NBCUniversal\u2019s Peacock release and make the streaming market even more competitive. Though pricing for the latter two services has yet to be revealed, Disney+ and Apple TV+ will cost $6.99 per month and $4.99 per month, respectively. A standard U.S. Netflix subscription costs $12.99 per month.\n\nNetflix told investors the launch of those streaming services may cause Netflix\u2019s short-term growth to slightly slow, though the company expects to continue expanding due to the large size of the market.\n\n\u201cStreaming video services have mostly exclusive content libraries that make them highly differentiated from one another,\u201d Netflix said in its letter to shareholders. \u201cIn our view, the likely outcome from the launch of these new services will be to accelerate the shift from linear TV to on-demand consumption of entertainment. Just like the evolution from broadcast TV to cable, these once-in-a-generation changes are very large and open up big, new opportunities for many players.\u201d\n\nOn the plus side, Netflix slightly beat expectations for international subscriber growth: The streaming service added around 6.3 million international subscribers (totaling 6.8 million global adds), which was above the expected 6.2 million, according to the company. Netflix told investors that it is forecasting 600,000 net U.S. subscriptions in Q4 and 7 million in international markets. If the company ends up adding 7.6 million paid subscribers at the end of Q4, that would equate to a notable decrease from Netflix\u2019s 8.8 million paid subscriber additions in Q4 2018.\n\n\u201cWhile we had previously expected 2019 paid net adds to be up year over year, our current forecast reflects several factors including less precision in our ability to forecast the impact of our Q4 content slate, which consists of several new big IP launches (as opposed to returning seasons), the minor elevated churn in response to some price changes, and new forthcoming competition,\u201d the company said in its shareholder letter.\n\nNetflix has kept busy in recent months, having announced pricey overall deals with the likes of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss and \u201cStranger Things\u201d masterminds Matt and Ross Duffer. \u201cStranger Things\u201d Season 3 served as Netflix\u2019s breakout show during Q3 and the company said 64 million accounts watched the season in the first four weeks following its premiere. The company also reportedly paid more than $500 million to acquire the streaming rights to classic sitcom \u201cSeinfeld,\u201d which will hit Netflix in 2021. The company did not note any of those developments in its Q3 shareholder letter.\n\nStill, the company noted that it is continuing to prioritize original content in anticipation of popular legacy shows that will soon be leaving Netflix. The streaming service caused a stir over the summer when it was announced that longtime Netflix staples \u201cFriends\u201d and \u201cThe Office\u201d would be departing the service and find new streaming homes on HBO Max and Peacock, respectively.\n\nThe service will release several original film and television projects in the upcoming quarter, including \u201cThe Crown\u200b,\u201d \u201c\u200bThe Witcher\u200b\u201d, \u201c\u200bKlaus\u200b,\u201d \u201c\u200bThe Irishman\u200b,\u201d \u200b\u201cThe Two Popes\u200b,\u201d and \u201c\u200b6 Underground.\u201d\n\nInvestors reacted favorably to Netflix Q3 report; The company\u2019s stock was up more than 8 percent in extended trading Wednesday.\n\nLaunch Gallery: Every New Netflix Original Series Premiering in 2019\n\nBest of IndieWire\n\nSign up for Indiewire's Newsletter.
