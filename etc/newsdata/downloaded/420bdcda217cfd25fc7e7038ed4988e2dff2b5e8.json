These plans were rejected by the bondholders.\n\n'A meeting of the company's board of directors subsequently took place on 25 September 2019 where it was resolved that the company was insolvent and should be wound up voluntarily.\n\n'This was followed by a meeting of the company's creditors yesterday (15 October 2019) at which a vote was passed to place the company into creditors' voluntary liquidation.'\n\nIn a creditors\u2019 voluntary liquidation, the liquidator acts in the interest of the creditors, not the directors.\n\nJoint liquidator James Bennett said: 'The directors have reported that higher than anticipated design and project management costs, coupled with delays to the delivery of the sites, resulted in the companies experiencing significant liquidity issues.\n\nBuilding businesses associated with the Grand Designs star (pictured) found themselves in catastrophic trouble earlier this year - and have now gone into liquidation\n\n'After being unable to raise further finance or renegotiate existing liabilities, the directors took the difficult decision to instigate liquidation proceedings.\n\n'This has resulted in a considerable loss to mini bond holders who largely financed the project. An important element of the liquidators' role, as usual, will be to review the events leading up to the failure of the companies.'\n\nBoth building projects in Oxford and Winchester are controlled by two subsidiary companies - HAB at Lovedon Fields Limited and Hab at The Acre Limited - neither of which are part of the proposed liquidation.\n\n'The directors of these entities continue to explore options to enable these developments to be completed,' the spokesperson continued.\n\n'HAB Housing Limited is also unaffected by the liquidation proceedings.'\n\nMr McCloud is a significant shareholder in the HAB network of companies, remaining a director of HAB Housing and owning 20 per cent of HAB Land's parent company, BAH Restructuring.\n\nA spokesman for HAB Land had previously said Mr McCloud resigned as a director of HAB Land in February 2018 - and had not been involved in the company for 18 months - but he remained a 'significant minibond holder'.\n\nCompanies House lists Mr McCloud as having resigned from his role of director at Hab Land Ltd.\n\nKevin McCloud with the Mayor of Winchester, 2017, opening a development in Kings Worthy\n\nHAB Housing, founded by McCloud, had promised eco-friendly developments in Winchester and Oxford would be finished by 2017.\n\nLast month residents in million-pound houses in a development built by HAB Housing complained that two years after it was due to be finished the site was still covered in scaffolding with unfinished pavements and no street lighting.\n\nThe Winchester location still had a building site with temporary toilets where the development promised a wildflower meadow and children's play area.\n\nOne woman complained she was informed just last week her bathroom floor would have to be ripped up and leaky pipes relaid.\n\nHAB Land Limited was founded in 2014 to acquire development land for building projects at sites in Oxford and Winchester.\n\nHAB Land Finance plc was subsequently incorporated as a wholly owned subsidiary of the company in 2016, in order to raise finance to fund the real estate activities of HAB Land through Mini Bond Instruments.\n\n*** Did you invest in HAB Land, Hab Housing, or a related company?
