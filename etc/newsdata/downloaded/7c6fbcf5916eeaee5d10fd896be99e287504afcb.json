Renters think it'll be by inheritance", "language": "en", "text": "Almost half of renters believe they will only get onto the property ladder if they inherit a house - or the money to buy one, new research has revealed.\n\nThe findings by insurer Aviva found that 46 per cent of tenants reckon they won't become homeowners without an inheritance.\n\nIt explained the reasons for continuing to rent rather than buy are mostly financial, with 62 per cent of tenants saying it is because they can't afford to buy, with 12 per cent saying that they're saving for a deposit.\n\nIt comes as Britain continues to be a nation aspiring to own their own properties with only 11 per cent of respondents saying they don't want the responsibility of being a homeowner.\n\nHalf of renters believe they will only get onto the property ladder if they inherit a house - or the money to buy one\n\nThe research also found that tenants typically spend more of their income on rent at 35 per cent, compared to homeowners who typically spend 25 per cent on their mortgage.\n\nThose who rent privately are likely to pay the most, averaging at 40 per cent of their income.\n\nPaul Brencher, from Aviva, said: 'More and more households are living in rented accommodation as house prices continue to be out of reach for many.\n\n'There are a number of benefits to renting - it provides flexibility and can allow people to have their own space sooner than if they were saving to get on the property ladder.'\n\nHe added: 'However, renters have the same need to be able to pay for their housing as homeowners.\n\n'The risk of an unexpected loss of income due to ill health, and the potential impacts for families, are the same for renters and homeowners.\n\n'Our research suggests that many renters could be leaving themselves exposed because they don't have protection insurance or cover for their possessions.'\n\nA total of 38 per cent of renters expect renting to become the most common type of accommodation for future generations\n\nThe survey asked 2,057 adults about their accommodation, including 567 respondents living in rented accommodation and 585 respondents who own their house with a mortgage.\n\nMost owned their properties outright and about 100 lived with their family or friends - some paying rent and others not.\n\nIt found that 38 per cent of tenants expect renting to become the most common type of accommodation for future generations.\n\nIn addition, half of renters feel there is a stigma attached to renting rather than owning a home.\n\nIn line with this, 22 per cent said they feel 'embarrassed' to be renting, increasing to 33 per cent among those aged 35 to 44.", "description": "It comes as Britain continues to be a nation aspiring to own their own properties with only 11% of respondents saying they don't want the responsibility of being a homeowner.", "authors": ["Myra Butterworth For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/07/29/14/16631698-0-image-a-13_1564406983980.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-30"}
