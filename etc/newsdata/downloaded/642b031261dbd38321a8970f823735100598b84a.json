REUTERS/Peter Nicholls\n\nThe World Trade Organization (WTO) is expected to give the green light this week to U.S. tariffs on billions of dollars of European goods, including Airbus jets, in a move likely to be mirrored by European tariffs on U.S. planes and goods next year.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. can\u2019t afford to have a trade war,\u201d Ryanair Group Chief Executive Michael O\u2019Leary, whose company\u2019s main airline is one of Boeing\u2019s (BA.N) largest customers, told Reuters after speaking at a Reuters Newsmaker event.\n\n\u201cBoeing is one of its biggest manufacturers and biggest exporters, but something needs to be resolved so I think like most airlines we sit there and hope common sense will prevail at the end of the day, but we don\u2019t know how it plays out,\u201d O\u2019Leary said.\n\nThe WTO is expected to publish in the coming days a report by an arbitration tribunal opening the door to U.S. tariffs due to illegal European subsidies for Airbus (AIR.PA).\n\nA similar WTO report backing EU tariffs in a parallel case over Boeing subsidies is expected early next year.\n\nBoth sides have won partial rulings in their favour during the 15-year-old trade spat, the largest handled by the WTO.\n\n\u201cUltimately I suspect it gets settled, because I am not sure the aviation industry either here in Europe or the U.S. can survive a tariff war between Boeing and Airbus - there are only two suppliers,\u201d O\u2019Leary said.\n\nHe suggested a greater burden lay on the EU to resolve the dispute since it sells more planes to the United States than the other way round.\n\nAsked how Ryanair would respond to any EU tariffs on Boeing jets, O\u2019Leary said, \u201cIt depends on the size and scale of the tariffs \u2013 our starting position is we want Boeing to eat the tariffs.\n\n\u201cIf (tariffs) were to significantly increase the cost of aircraft then I think we have to look at staggering or delaying some deliveries. Some of that will depend on what the availability of aircraft is like over here if that were to happen and what Boeing does and the U.S. does in response.\u201d\n\nBoeing was not immediately available for comment.\n\nAny delays due to the tariff dispute could pose a new threat to Ryanair\u2019s growth plans as the airline emerges from the grounding of Boeing 737 MAX jets following two fatal accidents.\n\nRyanair has cut its fleet growth forecast for the summer of 2020 to 30 Boeing jets from 58 and has said it hopes that deliveries will be back on track by the summer of 2021.", "description": "The head of Ireland's Ryanair on Tuesday urged the United States and European Union to pull back from a tariff war over aircraft subsidies and said he would ask Boeing to \"eat\" any counter-tariffs imposed on the U.S. firm by the EU.", "authors": ["Tim Hepher", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435882047&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF902RS", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
