Between dominating the music world, the beauty world, and the fashion world, we\u2019re fully convinced RiRi could lead a country (and make it a world superpower).\n\nSince 2012, she has also been at the helm of her own foundation. Rihanna founded the Clara Lionel Foundation in honor of her grandparents, Clara and Lionel Braithwaite. According to its official site, the organization \u201csupports and funds groundbreaking and effective education and emergency response programs around the world,\u201d including \u201cprimary and secondary education programs in Malawi, Barbados, and Senegal and emergency response programs in the Caribbean.\u201d\n\nAs a way to help support victims of Hurricane Dorian in the Bahamas, Rihanna just did a super cool thing.\n\nThe singer dropped a limited-edition lingerie collection for Savage x Fenty, with proceeds from every purchase going toward emergency relief efforts.\n\nundefined\n\nRihanna\u2019s Savage x Fenty website notes a minimum donation of $7 for each product sold.\n\nThe collection includes four items, all in chic black: a cami, a slip, and two pairs of undies in bikini cut and brief cut. Prices range from $20 to $39. It\u2019s a super-affordable (and sexy!) way to help support the victims of Hurricane Dorian, who face tremendous devastation after the Category 5 storm made landfall last week.\n\nIf you want to snag some new lingerie from the collection, act fast because the items won\u2019t be restocked once they sell out. Shop it at Savage x Fenty\u2019s site right now. Based on how gorgeous these pieces look, we have a feeling they\u2019ll be gone pretty quickly.\n\nThe Clara Lionel Foundation is also helping those impacted by Hurricane Dorian by providing two emergency response grants directly to organizations at work in the area.\n\nThe first grant will support Chef Jos\u00e9 Andres\u2019s World Central Kitchen, whose team has been helping hurricane victims in the Bahamas since Tuesday, September 3rd, by providing meals to people affected by the storm. The second grant will help fund Direct Relief\u2019s medical aid efforts, which provides victims with \u201cemergency health kits containing chronic care medications, acute care resources, and supplies for medical professionals, as well as needed medicines for thousands of people,\u201d according to the foundation\u2019s website.\n\nWe love that Rihanna is using her platform to help those truly in need at this time, so if you\u2019ve got a bit of extra cash, supporting these organizations\u2014and scoring some sexy new duds, too\u2014is a great way to give back in any way you can. You\u2019re always doing us proud, RiRi.", "description": "Rihanna's foundation is teaming up with her Savage x Fenty line to raise money for Hurricane Dorian relief in the Bahamas.
