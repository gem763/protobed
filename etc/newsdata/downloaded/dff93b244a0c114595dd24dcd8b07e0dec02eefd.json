A typical mahjong game could see players bet anywhere from $1 to $15.\n\n'People can gamble with anything'\n\nOn 20 October, police in Yushan, a small county in China's southeast Jiangxi province, issued a statement announcing that all mahjong parlours in the county would be \"closed\" by 22 October.\n\nAuthorities said the ban would be enacted in an effort to \"push forward the campaign against crimes and gangs... [to] solve the gambling and noise problem [and] purify social conduct\".\n\nGambling is illegal in China but under Jiangxi province law, those who engage in \"win-loss entertainments such as mahjong and poker involving a small amount of money... shall not be punished\".\n\nHowever, the law adds that people who \"[gamble] money of more than 200 yuan ($28; \u00a321)\" could be subject to punishment.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption It's a familiar sight to see retirees gather in parks to play mahjong\n\nIt wasn't long before the backlash kicked in.\n\nSome people pointed out that while China does face a widespread problem of illegal gambling dens, many mahjong parlours are in fact, legally operated with licenses.\n\nAnother commenter on social media site Weibo said: \"Not all people play mahjong for gambling,\" according to state media ECNS.\n\n\"My grandparents play mahjong as part of their daily entertainment\".\n\nOthers said it was \"lazy\" solution by the government in an attempt to curtail illegal gambling.\n\n\"Mahjong [itself] is not a problem. People can gamble with anything,\" said one comment on Weibo.\n\nJust one day after they made the announcement, Yushan authorities revised their statement, saying licensed mahjong parlours would not be affected.\n\nThey also clarified that the ban was meant to target places that encouraged \"illegal gambling\".\n\nSeveral other cities in Jiangxi have also banned mahjong in recent days, but had made it clear in their announcements that registered mahjong parlours would not be affected.\n\nWhat is mahjong?", "description": "An apparent ban on mahjong to curb illegal gambling in several cities led to panic on social media.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/14EBE/production/_109349658_gettyimages-611257164.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
