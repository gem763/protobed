Popular benefits include flexible work conditions (with the ability to work from home), company-paid mobile phones and extra holiday leave. Here's all the cool stuff you should be demanding from your employer.\n\nWith wage growth continuing to flat line around the country, an increasing number of Aussie businesses are relying on \"work perks\" to attract talented employees. These are additional employment incentives unrelated to the employee's salary.\n\nAccording to the latest Robert Half survey, 62% of Australian employees now consider non-salary related benefits to be more important than base salary when it comes to accepting a job offer.

This is something Aussie employers are finally beginning to embrace, with some firms even offering \"unlimited\" annual leave (provided you don't take the piss, of course.)\n\nIf you don't expect to get a pay rise any time soon, it might be worth requesting some of the perks above during your next appraisal. If they can't afford to pay you more, at least they can make you a bit happier.\n\nHow KPIs Create Workplace Monsters Rather than putting the time and effort into promoting self-control, many organisations continue to favour focusing on goals, irrespective of how they are achieved.
