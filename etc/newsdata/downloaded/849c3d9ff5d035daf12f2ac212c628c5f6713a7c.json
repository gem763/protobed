He also worried that the scheme to pay athletes upsets the balance.\n\n\u201cYou go to school in order to get an education,\u201d Holtz told the hosts. \u201cWhy do schools even have sports? Because you learn so much from sports. You learn about adversity, you learn about getting along with other people, you\u2019re learning about teamwork and being unselfish. All these qualities will carry over. You ask almost everyone who ever played athletics how much they learned, and that\u2019s why we have them. We don\u2019t have them for money.\u201d\n\nHoltz added that schools are already spending money on things to help the athletes, such as training, and workout facilities, food, and equipment.\n\n\u201cI just think we cannot get in this thing of paying somebody,\u201d Holtz added.\n\nThe NCAA agrees with Holtz and has spoken out against the California law.\n\nIn its latest statement, the NCAA insists that a \u201cpatchwork\u201d of state-by-state rules is not effective.\n\n\u201cAs a membership organization, the NCAA agrees changes are needed to continue to support student-athletes, but improvement needs to happen on a national level through the NCAA\u2019s rules-making process. Unfortunately, this new law already is creating confusion for current and future student-athletes, coaches, administrators and campuses, and not just in California,\u201d the organization said.\n\n\u201cWe will consider next steps in California while our members move forward with ongoing efforts to make adjustments to NCAA name, image and likeness rules that are both realistic in modern society and tied to higher education,\u201d the statement continued.\n\n\u201cAs more states consider their own specific legislation related to this topic,\u201d the NCAA concluded, \u201cit is clear that a patchwork of different laws from different states will make unattainable the goal of providing a fair and level playing field for 1,100 campuses and nearly half a million student-athletes nationwide.\u201d\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.", "description": "College coaching legend Lou Holtz took the State of California to task for its new law that would allow college athletes to receive pay for", "authors": ["Warner Todd Huston"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/The-Associated-Press-2-639x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
