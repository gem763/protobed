The latter previously campaigned to be Hong Kong\u2019s leader but became mired in an ethics scandal after lavish but illegal architectural modifications were found at his opulent residence.\n\nWilly Lam, adjunct professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong\u2019s Center for China Studies, says the resignation of Carrie Lam would help to diffuse the tensions in the short term.\n\n\u201c[Her stepping down] could go some ways to repair the damage,\u201d he told TIME. \u201cIt could improve the situation as she has already lost the trust of Hong Kong people.\u201d\n\nThe professor added that Beijing faced a difficult situation as it had to find somebody who would strike a tone of reconciliation and be accepted among different groups, but who would also be \u201ca pure puppet who would toe the line a hundred percent.\u201d\n\nIn the long term, he said the crisis can only be resolved \u201cif the new person can introduce changes such as reviving the discussion on political reform.\u201d\n\nWrite to Hillary Leung at hillary.leung@time.com.", "description": "Hong Kong's embattled leader is to resign and be replaced under a plan being drawn up by Beijing, according a Financial Times report.", "authors": ["Hillary Leung", "Hong Kong"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/gettyimages-1176176283.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
