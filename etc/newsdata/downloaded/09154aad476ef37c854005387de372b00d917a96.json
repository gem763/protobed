USA TODAY\n\nFor once, President Donald Trump wishes the NBA would not just stick to sports.\n\nGolden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr and San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich have often criticized Trump for his divisive rhetoric. But they abstained from critiquing China amid its conflict with Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cI watched this guy Steve Kerr. He was like a little boy who was so scared to be answering the question,\u201d Trump told reporters on Wednesday. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t answer the question. He was shaking like, \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t know.\u2019 He didn\u2019t know how to answer the question. Yet, he\u2019ll talk about the United States very badly. I watched Popovich do sort of the same thing. But he didn\u2019t look quite as scared, actually.\u201d\n\nKerr had spoken to reporters in the Bay Area before Trump's comments. Warriors star Stephen Curry, however, heard about them before speaking. Curry could not help but smile. Trump had singled Curry out two years ago amid the Warriors' refusal to make the customary White House visit to celebrate the team's NBA championship. As Curry mused, \"I gotta welcome Steve to the club.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s weird just because I\u2019d figure he would have other better things to do with his time,\" Curry said of Trump's criticism. \"Those kind of conversations you hope are just productive. Whatever the issue or narrative is, hopefully the general and majority of the reaction is people figuring out a solution to what we\u2019re talking about. Or having productive conversations instead of throwing words and 140 character tweets at people.\"\n\nCONTROVERSY: How much money is at stake for NBA in China?\n\nOPINION: It's time for LeBron James to exercise his right to free speech\n\nOPINION: NBA draws its own line in the sand\n\nPOPOVICH: Spurs coach Gregg Popovich sounds off on NBA-China impasse\n\nNeither Kerr nor Popovich actually looked scared when addressing an incident that has caused a strained business relationship between the NBA and China. But neither talked at length about the issue as they have about various racial and social issues in the United States.\n\nKerr, whose father was assassinated as a diplomat in Lebanon in 1984 in what was considered an act of terrorism, has criticized the NRA in recent years following every mass shooting.\n\nAs for the Hong Kong protests?\n\nKerr said he emailed his brother-in-law, whom Kerr said is a Chinese history professor, in hopes to learn more about the situation.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve found is it\u2019s easy to speak on issues that I\u2019m passionate about and feel like I\u2019m well versed on,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cWhat I found is that it makes sense to stick to topics that fall in that category. I keep my comments to those. It\u2019s not difficult. I\u2019m more trying to learn.\u201d\n\nPopovich praised NBA commissioner Adam Silver, who has attempted to strike a balance regarding the situation. He apologized to China for Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey's pro-Hong Kong tweet, which offended China and its residents. Silver also defended Morey\u2019s right to free speech.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been a heck of a leader in that respect and very courageous,\u201d Popovich told reporters at the Spurs-Miami Heat preseason game Tuesday. \u201cCompared to what we\u2019ve had to live through the last three years, there\u2019s a big difference gap there leadership-wise and courage-wise.\u201d\n\nThat prompted Trump to paint Kerr and Popovich as hypocritical.\n\n\u201cThey talked badly about the United States. But when they talk about China, they don\u2019t want to say anything bad,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI thought it was pretty sad, actually, to see them pandering to China. It will be very interesting.\u201d\n\nThe NBA has fielded criticism from both political parties for failing to condemn China's human-rights record. The NBA has hosted exhibition games in China since 2006, while the league's stars have increasingly landed endorsements there.\n\nSo has Curry, who has visited China for the past six summers to promote his shoe brand with Under Armour. He downplayed that variable, insisting that he and other NBA players have not been as outspoken for a much simpler reason.\n\n\u201cThis situation, there\u2019s a huge weight and gravity to it. There\u2019s going to need to be some things to be sorted out,\" Curry said. \"But I just don\u2019t know enough about Chinese history and how that\u2019s influenced modern society today and that interaction to speak on it. That\u2019s where we\u2019re at. This is not going away. So we\u2019ll come back to it.\u201d\n\nContributing: David Jackson\n\nFollow Mark Medina on Twitter @MarkG_Medina", "description": "Donald Trump said it was ''pretty sad'' to see coaches Gregg Popovich, Steve Kerr and others \"pandering to China'' while being critical of U.S.", "authors": ["Mark Medina", "Published P.M.
