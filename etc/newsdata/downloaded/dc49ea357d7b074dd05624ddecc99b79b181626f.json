He was recalling two decades of fighting measles in Africa as a physician in the U.S. Public Health Service. \u201cThere was always a local term for the disease. Everybody knew it. It killed their children.\u201d\n\nIn 1980, measles caused 2.6 million deaths worldwide. Widespread use of the two-shot measles vaccine over the past four decades changed that. By 2000, routine immunization was preventing 80 million cases of the infection each year.\n\nThat year, the World Health Organization declared measles \u201celiminated\u201d in the United States. There was no longer continuous circulation of the virus here. All measles cases could be traced to unvaccinated people catching the disease outside the country or infected people from abroad bringing it in.\n\nNow, that is changing.\n\nThe United States has recorded 1,241 cases of measles so far this year. (It used to have fewer than 100 each year). While they\u2019ve occurred in 31 states, more than three-quarters have been in New York, where a smoldering outbreak has been underway since last October. If a country has a continuous chain of measles transmission lasting more than a year, the disease is no longer considered \u201celiminated.\u201d If new cases linked to the New York outbreak occur after Tuesday, that will be the situation here.\n\nThings are worse elsewhere. Worldwide, measles cases doubled from 2017 to 2018. Through July, there have been three times as many cases as in the same period last year.\n\nIn recent years, experts have tried many ways to convince vaccine-refusers the unwisdom of their choice. It\u2019s now time for a plea rather than an argument. Anti-vaxxers, please make an exception for measles vaccine, because measles is a special case. Here\u2019s why.\n\nMeasles is caused by a type of Morbillivirus; similar ones attack cats, cattle, seals and other animals. A common feature is the ease of transmission \u2014 a quality captured by what biologists call the \u201cbasic reproductive number\u201d (denoted R0). It\u2019s the number of new cases that occurs when an infected person circulates among susceptible people.\n\nR0 is an average that depends on lots of things, including human behavior and population density. The biggest driver, however, is the bug itself. Measles has an R0 of 12 to 18 \u2014 so high that the infection is often described as the most contagious disease in man. In comparison, R0 for the 1918 pandemic influenza virus was 3.8. For smallpox, it is 4.5; for polio, 6; for SARS, 3.5.\n\nThe virus spreads through \u201crespiratory aerosols,\u201d which can hang in the air for hours. A study of measles transmission on airplane flights found that the average distance between the person with the disease and the person who came down with it was six rows. In one case, it was 17 rows.\n\nWhile measles is in a class of its own when it comes to contagiousness, luckily that\u2019s not true for mortality. In the 1950s, the United States averaged 440 measles deaths a year \u2014 a fraction of 1 percent of total cases. In poor countries, it was a different story. Epidemics occurred every two years, infecting all children born since the last one and killing 3 to 5 percent of them.\n\nLuckily, the vaccine protects 97 percent of the time after two doses. It\u2019s so good that measles is a candidate for global eradication, a feat achieved only with smallpox. It\u2019s no coincidence that the only eradicated animal disease is rinderpest \u2014 cattle measles \u2014 thanks to a vaccine.\n\nNone of this would matter if the measles vaccine wasn\u2019t safe. But it is. The most common serious reaction \u2014 a seizure caused by fever \u2014 occurs in 3 out of every 10,000 shots. It also doesn\u2019t cause autism, as innumerable studies have proved, although vaccine skeptics who think the question is still open are unlikely to ever be convinced.\n\nFortunately for them (but not us), their children are protected by \u201cherd immunity,\u201d which kicks in when about 95 percent of the population has been vaccinated. But there\u2019s a problem. Pockets of the population \u2014 immunocompromised children, members of certain religious groups \u2014 are loaded with susceptible members. Immunity in the rest of us has to be higher than the herd threshold to keep the virus from eventually finding them.\n\nThat\u2019s where we are today. Every immunized child plays a mathematical role in protecting kids who can\u2019t protect themselves. But you may ask: Isn\u2019t this just statistics without a human face?\n\nUnfortunately, no.\n\nIn August, a 43-year-old Israeli flight attendant died five months after going into a coma caused by measles encephalitis. It\u2019s believed she contracted the infection on a flight from New York, where there was an ongoing outbreak. She had been vaccinated at a time when children got only one shot and wasn\u2019t fully immune.\n\nHer death angered Grabowsky.\n\nIn the 1990s, he worked to push measles vaccine coverage above 80 percent in seven African countries. After five years, it was up to 91 percent, with no confirmed measles deaths in 2000 (Undoubtedly, there were a few.) While the action of millions made the achievement possible, it was the action of one person that Grabowsky thought of when he heard about the flight attendant.\n\n\u201cVaccination is one of the purest markers of individual actions having public consequences,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt\u2019s outrageous that somebody neglected their public responsibility and it led to a stranger\u2019s death.\u201d\n\nNow 63 and retired from the Public Health Service at the rank of captain, he has come to view vaccination as part of the social contract. \u201cIt\u2019s like paying taxes to build bridges we\u2019ll never drive over and paying teachers who\u2019ll never teach our children. It\u2019s part of citizenship.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true that if you don\u2019t vaccinate your child against measles you probably won\u2019t pay a price for it. But eventually somebody will.\n\nSo, here\u2019s the request: Vaccinate your child for that person.\n\nDavid Brown is a physician and writer who for many years covered medical and science issues for The Washington Post.\n\nRead more\n\nHealth officials try new tactics against measles outbreak\n\nMeet the New York couple donating millions to the anti-vax movement\n\nNurses are teaching doctors how to treat anti-vaccine fears and myths", "description": "The nation has recorded 1,2412 cases of measles so far this year.
