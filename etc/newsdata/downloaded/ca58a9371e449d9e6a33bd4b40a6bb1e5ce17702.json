(Joshua Roberts/Reuters)\n\nThis is the last Jim-written Morning Jolt for a week. Enjoy the week leading up to Easter Sunday, and if you\u2019re going to be driving on I-95 South in Virginia, North Carolina, or South Carolina this afternoon, please stay out of the left lane.\n\nOur Political Fights Are Intense Because We No Longer Agree on the Rules\n\nMatthew Walther, writing about Julian Assange in The Week, lists how many Democrats and Republicans changed their minds about Assange depending upon whose secrets he was exposing and concludes:\n\n[if Assange exposes Trump\u2019s secrets], we can expect to see both sides revert once more to their circa 2010 defaults. Once more Assange would be the bugbear of the national security right and a liberal icon. It\u2019s almost as if his own utter lawlessness were a mirror of the nihilism at the heart of the modern Western democratic imagination, a danger far greater than any given leak.\n\nThat\u2019s a hard truth. One of the reasons our politics is so contentious and angry is that we can\u2019t agree on what the rules are. Some of us want to argue that certain policies are good and certain policies are bad. But a vocal chunk of Americans don\u2019t really care about what the policies are; they would much rather argue that their side is right. They don\u2019t care if these are the same policies or comparable to those they denounced earlier. The system is clogged with bad-faith arguments, hypocrisy, and flip-flopping.\n\nWhat do most Americans and most American policymakers think of running trillion-a-year deficits? It depends upon whether their party\u2019s president is the one running up the debts. When the other guys are in power, it\u2019s reckless endangerment of our children\u2019s future. When their own guys are in power, it\u2019s a necessary step to ensure economic growth.\n\nWhen someone prominent is accused of a crime, is the bigger concern the rights of the accused and the burden of proof, or the rights of the victim to have her account heard and for the crime to be punished? For many people, it depends upon the partisan status of the person accused. Some people believed the accusations against Brett Kavanaugh instantly and adamantly insisted his confirmation to the Supreme Court was a great injustice; some of those same people take little interest in the women accusing Virginia lieutenant governor Justin Fairfax \u2014 and some people reversed their responses in the other direction.\n\nThe antiwar movement around Iraq and Afghanistan proved to be an anti-Bush movement; once Obama was in office, the protests grew more sparse and less covered. When one side\u2019s leaders take military action, it\u2019s protecting Americans in a dangerous world; when the other side\u2019s leaders take military action, it\u2019s irresponsible warmongering.\n\nFor many Americans, when the side they like uses heated rhetoric, it\u2019s speaking truth to power. When the side they don\u2019t like uses heated rhetoric, it\u2019s hate speech and dangerous incitement.\n\nThere\u2019s a funny video going around, contrasting House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerry Nadler\u2019s views on disclosure of reports investigating the president. He adamantly opposed the release of the Starr report to the public and cited the need to protect the privacy of the individuals mentioned in it; now \u201cthe entire Mueller report, with no redactions whatsoever\u201d must be released immediately.\n\nIs the desire to make more money inherently greedy? Or only conditionally greedy? For years, the mantra of Bernie Sanders was that the wealthy were driven by an intensely selfish desire: \u201cHow many yachts do billionaires need? How many cars do they need? Give us a break. You can\u2019t have it all.\u201d Sanders has three homes and is now a millionaire. He achieved this through selling books. Apparently selling books is a legitimate path to wealth, but other paths are somehow inherently exploitative.\n\nIf you\u2019re partisan enough, you can convince yourself that Ralph Northam\u2019s blackface is forgivable, that Michael Avenatti is a crusader for justice, that Jussie Smollett is exposing dark bigotry manifesting in the late-night streets of Chicago, that the Southern Poverty Law Center is reliable and careful, and that the reporting about allegations of Trump colluding with Russians to hack the 2016 election were well-sourced and even-handed.\n\nIf you\u2019re partisan enough, you can convince yourself that Donald Trump is here to restore Christian values, clean up Washington, and provide a better role model for our political leaders; that Steve King is simply a misunderstood patriot; that the presidential summits with North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un represented wise and cautious diplomacy; and that Paul Manafort and Roger Stone are well-meaning operatives that any good campaign would hire or choose as partners.\n\nLot of Interest in 1970s Busing Fights Lately, Huh?\n\nBoy, Joe Biden\u2019s efforts in the fight about forced busing and desegregation sure are getting a lot of attention these days, aren\u2019t they?\n\nI like going back over a politician\u2019s career as much as the next guy, but doesn\u2019t anyone in the media feel awkward that this issue received no attention during the eight years Biden was vice president? If this is worthy of public discussion and debate, why wasn\u2019t this an issue in 2008?\n\nThere\u2019s a simple explanation for this: The mainstream media\u2019s level of interest in stories that could make Biden look bad is inversely proportional to how closely he\u2019s standing to Barack Obama.\n\nIt\u2019s a lot like Biden\u2019s wandering hands \u2014 fodder for jokes in the past, a topic for a serious national conversation now.\n\nCan We Now Stop Using Kids as Political Spokesmen?\n\nRyan Petty, who lost his daughter Alaina in the Parkland shooting, wrote an op-ed for USA Today that echoes what a lot of us were saying last spring \u2014 that whatever you think of gun control, it\u2019s probably not a good idea to take teenagers who have just been through a national event and put them in the spotlight as spokesman for a highly charged legislative proposal.\n\nWhile the sense of political urgency from students was understandable and in some ways admirable, it came at the cost of a focus on the health and healing \u2014 for the families of the victims, students, teachers, and the community at large . .\n\nThe politicization and media-frenzied response to the murders overwhelmed and eclipsed the real, personal needs of the survivors and their loved ones. To be blunt, the cacophony of voices on gun control drowned out and suppressed a needed conversation on the mental-health needs at the school and in the community. For that failure, our community is paying a heavy price.\n\nAt the time, the motivation for spotlighting the teens was clear: to disagree with their often-heated and sometimes factually wrong assertions about gun violence amounted to \u201cattacking children\u201d in the eyes of their pro-gun control allies. It wasn\u2019t about bringing new voices to the debate, it was about shutting down the debate.\n\nADDENDA: Hillary Clinton, with a sort-of funny line about Assange last night: \u201cI do think it\u2019s a little ironic that he may be the only foreigner that this administration would welcome to the United States.\u201d\n\nHa-ha-ha. Say, who\u2019s the president married to again? How many xenophobes marry immigrants?\n\nIn case you missed it yesterday, Tulsi Gabbard seems to think the Assange arrest was meant to intimidate journalists and Americans; it\u2019s possible that no Democratic candidate wins enough delegates to clinch the nomination before the convention in 2020; and I, for one, am getting tired of hearing Terry McAuliffe tell the alligator-wrestling story.", "description": "A vocal chunk of Americans don\u2019t really care about what the policies are; they would much rather argue that their side is right.", "authors": ["Jim Geraghty", "Andrew C.
