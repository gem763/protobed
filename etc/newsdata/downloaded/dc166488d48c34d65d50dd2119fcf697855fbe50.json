He was asked for comment last night and \u2026 total blank:\n\nSteve Kerr's full statement on the NBA/China controversy pic.twitter.com/7D5QTCtQe9 \u2014 Logan Murdock (@loganmmurdock) October 8, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s not as if Kerr doesn\u2019t keep up on current events, or as if western media hasn\u2019t covered Hong Kong, or as if the NBA has no presence in China that might make major political developments there of some interest to him.\n\nSomehow this issue ended up in his blind spot.\n\nDoes he have any thoughts generally about how China does or doesn\u2019t respect human rights? For instance, here\u2019s a wacky fact that I didn\u2019t know until today but which Kerr, an NBA coach, might be aware of. Not only does the NBA have a cozy relationship with Chinese totalitarians, it\u2019s so cozy that the league operates a training center in Xinjiang province \u2014 the same place where China is interning millions of Uighur Muslims. That\u2019s a bit like staging a hoops barnstorming tour of Poland circa 1944. Slate wrote about it last year:\n\nOperating in such a place seems antithetical to the public stance of a league that has recently gone out of its way to tout its progressive, social-justice bona fides. After the Trump travel ban targeting seven Muslim-majority nations, prominent NBA figures took the side of the critics. League commissioner Adam Silver took the unusual step of criticizing the ban, saying \u201cit goes against the fundamental values and the fundamental ingredients of what makes for a great NBA.\u201d Detroit Pistons head coach Stan Van Gundy compared the ban to Hitler registering the Jews. NBA stars like LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony have condemned police violence and racism in the United States, while players and executives have protested the Trump administration\u2019s separation of immigrant children from their parents. According to his LinkedIn page, the NBA executive George Land oversees the Xinjiang training center. On Twitter, Land\u2019s most recent activity is a retweet of the MSNBC host Chris Hayes condemning the U.S. separation of thousands of mothers from their children. But what about Xinjiang? Thousands of Uighur children are reportedly languishing in orphanages, awaiting their parents\u2019 release from the concentration camps. The NBA didn\u2019t respond to multiple requests for comment for this story. Nor did Land. Nor did China\u2019s foreign ministry.\n\nI ask this in all seriousness: Have any NBA players or personnel toured a Chinese, ahem, \u201cdetention facility\u201d as part of the league\u2019s charm offensive towards Beijing?\n\nWe\u2019re not going to see an old photo emerge of Kerr and, say, Steph Curry standing outside barbed wire smiling and giving a thumbs-up, are we?\n\nYou\u2019ll be pleased to know that the visceral disgust which the Daryl Morey episode has evoked in Americans of all stripes is putting pressure on the league. Adam Silver issued a statement last night affirming that the NBA respects Morey\u2019s right to his opinion, which I assume is a nudge to the Rockets not to fire him as GM in order to placate China. Whether Silver would have felt so strongly about Morey\u2019s rights had there been no bipartisan domestic backlash I leave for you to surmise.\n\nAdam Silver has released statement on league\u2019s relationship status with China, reading in part: \u201cThe NBA will not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say on these issues. We simply could not operate that way.\u201d pic.twitter.com/A43BOAdG57 \u2014 Shams Charania (@ShamsCharania) October 8, 2019\n\nNote the last paragraph about basketball being a unifying force. Once upon a time, the argument in favor of U.S. corporate outreach to China was that our values would gradually infect them and transform their culture. How\u2019s that infect-and-transform dynamic working out in the context of the Morey episode, do you think?\n\nAnyway, is Silver\u2019s statement good enough for China? He\u2019s giving them nearly everything they want here. With the eyes of international media upon him and Americans hooting at him to defend western liberalism, he\u2019s offered not a word of support for Hong Kong here nor a word of criticism for China. But maybe that\u2019s not good enough: News broke this morning that Chinese state TV and the local digital carrier have suspended coverage of the NBA preseason to protest Morey\u2019s comments. The clash of civilizations doesn\u2019t get any starker than this quote:\n\n\u201cI think as a values-based organization that I want to make it clear \u2026 that Daryl Morey is supported in terms of his ability to exercise his freedom of expression,\u201d Silver said in an interview with Kyodo News in Tokyo Japan. CCTV did not agree with Silver\u2019s remarks. \u201cWe are strongly dissatisfied and we oppose Silver\u2019s claim to support Morey\u2019s right of free expression. We believe that any speech that challenges national sovereignty and social stability is not within the scope of freedom of speech,\u201d CCTV said in its statement in Chinese, which was translated by CNBC.\n\nOne of the key points in this dispute (as well as the subject of last week\u2019s now-famous \u201cSouth Park\u201d episode) is the west tacitly agreeing to impose Chinese censorship standards on its own corporate culture in exchange for access to China\u2019s humongous market. Silver\u2019s trying to adjust the terms of that devil\u2019s bargain here \u2014 the league won\u2019t criticize China if it decides it wants to start feeding the Uighurs into a wood-chipper, say, but it\u2019s also not going to censor its own personnel who might have a problem with it. Go figure that that\u2019s not good enough for a totalitarian state. In China, when a subordinate makes trouble for the leadership, he\u2019s dealt with. Silver is refusing to punish Morey. Ergo, the whole league must be punished by losing its preseason TV coverage.\n\nThat\u2019s one part of what\u2019s driving the outrage, a growing awareness among Americans that China\u2019s illiberal views on freedom of thought are leaking into corporate America via executives\u2019 bank accounts. The NBA isn\u2019t the worst offender but it may be the most visible one. It\u2019s one thing to have some faceless Facebook PR apparatchik issue a statement that\u2019s soft on China, it\u2019s another to watch James farking Harden reassure China that he loves the country after his GM offered the tiniest gesture of support for Hong Kong protesters. What\u2019s especially galling is that people of wealth and influence enjoy a freedom to dissent that the average wage slave can only dream of. If you work at a Chinese-owned factory in the midwest for 20 bucks an hour, your thoughts on Hong Kong may affect whether you can put food on the table. If you\u2019re James Harden or Adam Silver, you don\u2019t have that problem. Except you do, apparently \u2014 maybe more so than the factory worker because so much money is at stake. It takes a lot of dough to buy global silence on concentration camps but the Chinese have figured it out.\n\nInescapably, though, some of the outrage at the NBA is a simple matter of contempt for their hypocrisy. As many others have noted over the past 36 hours, the league is known for \u2014 and celebrates \u2014 its wokeness. People like Kerr and Gregg Popovich are beloved figures among sports-loving liberals for their willingness to chime in on matters of social justice, and have received glowing coverage in the press for it. I don\u2019t begrudge them their greater interest in American injustices than Chinese mass oppression either; it\u2019s natural to worry more about how your friends are being mistreated than people a world away. But that rule of thumb isn\u2019t foolproof: Surely we can agree that once the level of foreign oppression reaches the concentration-camp stage, some reflection on whether you should continue to do business there while ignoring what\u2019s happening is in order. And yet here\u2019s Steve Kerr, the woke coach, playing dumb right in front of reporters.\n\nWhat we\u2019re learning, in other words, is that most or all of these \u201coutspoken\u201d A-holes are quivering frauds when speaking up might cost them something instead of earning them another sweetheart post on Deadspin or wherever.\n\nIOW Steve Kerr speaks when he expects the approval of the authorities. Steve Kerr is silent when the authorities demand silence. Steve Kerr uses his considerable intelligence to dissimulate on civil rights in China. A coward would just be silent. Kerr is a collaborator. https://t.co/1Xwc4WCjDO \u2014 Michael Brendan Dougherty (@michaelbd) October 8, 2019\n\nFrauds. Next time they to purport to you lecture you about your flaccid social-justice conscience, ask them if they\u2019ve been to the new training facility in Xinjiang yet.
