Yes, that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m suggesting. In fact, I\u2019m insisting,\u201d Mr. Maher added.\n\nMr. Maher, 63, has asserted that Mr. Trump will refuse to leave the White House if elected since prior to the president defeating former Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\nMr. Trump has referenced the comedian\u2019s claim while campaigning for re-election, including as recently as during a rally held this week in Dallas, Texas.\n\n\u201cI thought this wacko was kidding,\u201d Mr. Trump said at the event Thursday. \u201cHe\u2019s a comedian. I thought he was kidding. He\u2019s serious. He really believes it.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Mr. Maher said Friday that he is prepared to pay a hefty price to see Mr. Trump voluntarily walk away from the White House.\n\n\u201cCelebrities do nothing but waste their money on stupid, crazy [expletive] like castles and jewel-encrusted crucifixes and shark tanks and private islands. Here\u2019s something they could spend on and know it was doing some good,\u201d Mr. Maher said.\n\n\u201cSo, Mr. President, it\u2019s really very simple. You love money, we hate you. Take the money. Take our money. You could finally be the billionaire you always pretended you were. Yes, I said billionaire because of the kind of money I could get from \u2014 just off the top of my head \u2013 Oprah, Cher, Madonna, [Lady] Gaga, Bono, Jay Z, Beyonc\u00e9, Pink, Rihanna, Usher, Pharrell, Eminem. And that\u2019s just the ones with one name,\u201d Mr. Maher quipped.\n\nIt is not the first time Mr. Maher has offered money to Mr. Trump. The comedian joked in 2013 that he would give $5 million to a charity of Mr. Trump\u2019s choice if he proved he was not the son of an orangutan. Mr. Trump responded by suing the comic before eventually backing off.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
