The judge signed the outline of the agreement, filed in lower Manhattan federal court Thursday.\n\nA day earlier, Marrero had temporarily blocked enforcement of a grand jury subpoena demanding Trump's personal and corporate income tax returns from Mazars.\n\nMarrero said in a hearing Wednesday that it won't take him \"weeks or months\" to decide whether the subpoena should be allowed.", "description": "Prosecutors will hold off enforcing the subpoena until two business days after the judge rules on whether to dismiss the case or by Oct. 7 \u2014 whichever comes sooner.", "authors": ["Kevin Breuninger Dan Mangan", "Kevin Breuninger", "Dan Mangan"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106151225-1569528147408gettyimages-1171378602.jpeg?v=1569528175", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
