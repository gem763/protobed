It's also killed horses across the U.S. and been found in mosquitos in several states and in Canada.\n\nHere's what we know about the places that have tested positive for EEE, and what you can do to stay safe.\n\nVisit INSIDER's homepage for more.\n\nAt least a dozen cases of eastern equine encephalitis, a dangerous mosquito-borne illness, have been confirmed across the U.S. so far this season. Two people have died from the disease.\n\nEEE, or \"triple E,\" is a rare but life-threatening virus that can wreak havoc in livestock and cause permanent brain damage in people, resulting in seizures, mental impairment, and even personality changes in survivors of the disease.\n\nEEE is incurable, but its symptoms can be successfully treated if it's caught before it spreads to the brain. About a third of patients with EEE die, either within weeks of getting this disease or years later as a result of ongoing physical and mental impairment.\n\nTriple E is most often found in the northeastern United States in swampy, wooded areas from late spring to early fall. It can also be found in southern states into the winter months.\n\nRead more: EEE is a rare mosquito-borne virus that kills a third of people infected, and it's spreading\n\nEEE infections this year are already beyond the typical five to 10 human cases per season.

A man in his 50s in Bristol County was also confirmed to have been infected, according to MassLive.\n\nA person who was not identified because the third fatal case this season, according to Boston.com, confirmed Sept. 24.\n\nA 78-year old man also died of the disease Sept. 19.\n\nIn late August, a 59-year-old woman died after contracting EEE, according to NBC 10.

Another man, in his 70s, was diagnosed in early September, according to Boston 25 News.\n\nThe first case was confirmed in early August, which was also the first human case off EEE in Massachusetts since 2013, CNN reported.\n\nFollowing the infections, a growing number of communities have been declared at risk: more than 36 communities in the state were deemed a critical EEE risk, at least 42 at high risk, and more than 70 at moderate risk, according to the state Department of Health as of Sept. 9.\n\nCurfews have been implemented in the affected communities to reduce the spread of the disease, since mosquitos are most active from dusk to dawn.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt least seven people have been sickened in Michigan, and three have died.", "description": "Eastern equine encephalitis has no cure.
