He also claimed bronze in the individual 200 freestyle at Rio in 2016.\n\nUSADA CEO Travis Tygart said: \"As noted in the panels decision, USADA is independent of sport and here to help athletes ensure they compete clean and protect their health and well-being within the rules.\n\n\"It's frustrating that Mr Dwyer did not take advantage of this support and hopefully this case will convince others to do so in order to protect fair and healthy competition for all athletes.\"", "description": "American double Olympic champion Conor Dwyer said Friday he was retiring from swimming on the day he was handed a 20-month doping ban that ruled him out of next year's Tokyo Olympics.", "authors": ["Thomson Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5319024.1570831278!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/conor-dwyer.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
