The strike reportedly is costing GM between $50 million and $100 million a day.\n\nThe strike also has garnered the political spotlight.\n\nPresident Trump has encouraged GM to make a deal quickly, while Democratic presidential candidates, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, have visited strikers to show allegiance to their labor disruption.\n\nWhile both sides have been tight-lipped over details of the negotiations, a person briefed on the talks identified major sticking points that include wages and profit-sharing, new products for factories that GM wants to close, a faster route to full wages for new hires and the company\u2019s use of temporary workers.\n\nIn Lordstown, Ohio, where GM is closing a more than 50-year-old small-car assembly plant, the company has offered to instead locate a battery factory.\n\nThe factory would be run by a joint venture, and although it would have UAW workers, GM is proposing they work for pay that\u2019s lower than what the company pays at assembly plants.\n\nOn Monday outside the Lordstown plant, strike leaders struck a positive tone.\n\n\u201cIt is going well. Our people are frustrated with GM and we want them to know we are here,\u201d Bill Adams, vice president of the UAW Local 1112, told The Washington Times.\n\nMr. Adams, said about 500 UAW members are picketing voluntarily in multiple shifts to cover all 24 hours of the day. The union hall, he added, is functioning as a hub for donations, food and organizing activities.\n\nUAW representatives also are pushing for a larger slice of the more than $30 billion in profits GM has made over the past five years. GM has countered that it sees a global auto sales decline ahead and wants to bring its labor costs in line with U.S. plants owned by foreign automakers.\n\nExperts have noted that the strike comes at an interesting time for the American labor movement.\n\nDavid Zonderman, a professor of U.S. labor history at North Carolina State University, said that union membership is at an all-time low nationally \u2014 but positive feelings about organizing are at a high.\n\nA Gallup survey last month found that 64% of Americans approve of unions, up 16% from 2009.\n\nGallup, which has tracked public opinions of unions since the 1930s, added that since 1967, positive sentiments on unions have \u201conly occasionally surpassed 60%\u201d with the current rate one of the highest it has recorded over the past 50 years.\n\n\u201cIs this the rebirth of labor? Well, sometimes there is a real disconnect between unions and their ability to contribute to the growth of the middle class. People are discussing this again,\u201d Mr. Zonderman told The Times.\n\nMr. Zonderman did note that recent Bureau of Labor Statistics figures show private-sector union membership to be under 7%, the lowest level since the Great Depression.\n\n\u2022 This article is based in part on wire service reports.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
