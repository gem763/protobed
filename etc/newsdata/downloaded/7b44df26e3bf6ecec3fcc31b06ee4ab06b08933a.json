And it will be the sole focus,\u201d Maidment said. \u201cDeadspin will write only about sports and that which is relevant to sports in some way.\u201d\n\nThe top editorial leader at G/O\u2014the new company overseeing Deadspin, Gizmodo, Jezebel, Lifehacker, and a number of former Gawker Media sites\u2014told employees that stories with tie-ins to sports were permitted to run on the site but that they should leave non-sports stories to the company\u2019s other websites.\n\n\u201cWhere such subjects touch on sports, they are fair game for Deadspin. Where they do not, they are not,\u201d Maidment wrote. \u201cWe have plenty of other sites that write about politics, pop culture, the arts, and the rest, and they\u2019re the appropriate place for such work.\u201d\n\nDeadspin has often featured important politics and media articles, often in a subvertical titled The Concourse, and has poked fun at criticism of its decision to write about other non-sports topics, even selling \u201cStick to Sports\u201d merchandise on its site.\n\nBut non-sports coverage has also often been a traffic-booster for the site. Sources have told The Daily Beast that, among other articles, writer David Roth\u2019s political commentary often tops the site\u2019s most-read articles, as has writer Drew Magary\u2019s annual hater\u2019s guide to the Williams-Sonoma holiday catalog.\n\nThe tug-of-war over Deadpin\u2019s editorial mandate to stick to sports has been a long-running source of internal frustration and amusement for the site\u2019s staff. Monday\u2019s memo put the mandate in writing for all to see, however.\n\nWhen former Deadspin editor in chief Megan Greenwell left the site in August, she claimed G/O management had mandated sports-only coverage, noting it was one reason she could not continue at the company. \u201cThat's not something I feel I can ethically do,\u201d she said.\n\nMonday\u2019s memo is just the latest in a series of decisions that have caused friction between the websites and new management.\n\nIn recent days, many G/O employees have publicly and privately criticized a new seven-figure advertising deal that has clogged the websites with irritating auto-play videos. On Monday afternoon, Deadspin posted an article on its site noting that the G/O editorial staff was \u201cupset with the current state of our site\u2019s user experience\u201d and \u201cdoes not control the ad experience on the site.\u201d And in a series of internal Slack messages provided to The Daily Beast, employees pointed out to Maidment and other executives that the new ads were alienating readers.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t what any of us signed up for,\u201d one staffer said. \u201cIt\u2019s amateurish and pushing longtime readers away and making the sites difficult to enjoy.\u201d\n\nHowever, the post was removed later on Monday.", "description": "Sports\u2014and sports alone\u2014must be \u201cthe sole focus\u201d of the website, new management said Monday in a memo obtained by The Daily Beast.", "authors": ["Maxwell Tani", "Media Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1572291548/191028-tani-deadspin-tease_tz7xsg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
