(Eduardo Munoz Alvarez/AP)\n\nThe natural order of tennis things was upended Sunday night when No. 1 Novak Djokovic finished a meek third game of a third set, hugged his friend and opponent Stan Wawrinka, retired from their fourth-round match and left both a disappointed \u00adArthur Ashe Stadium and a \u00adredefined U.S. Open.\n\nThe pain flaring from Djokovic\u2019s left shoulder, an issue through much of his truncated stay here, had loomed while Wawrinka blasted to a 6-4, 7-5, 2-1 lead, looking occasionally like the destroyer who won three Grand Slam tournaments \u00admid-decade. When it ended abruptly, Wawrinka had his fourth Grand Slam win over Djokovic (including two finals), his fifth win over a No. 1 player (tied for second in history) and the loudest peak of his long and winding return from knee surgery in 2017 and a ranking of 263 in 2018.\n\nDjokovic exited to boos and then scattered cheers from a crowd that mostly rooted against him. \u201cThe pain was constant for weeks now,\u201d he said. \u201cSome days higher, some days with less intensity and obviously taking different stuff to kill the pain instantly. Sometimes it works; sometimes it doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n[As Serena Williams eyes history at the U.S. Open, a topsy-turvy women\u2019s field just tries to keep up]\n\nAs he slogged through 1 hour 46 minutes, he looked slightly but chronically less capable than Wawrinka, even as Djokovic\u2019s early break in the second set supplied a 2-0 lead that grew to 4-1 and made it seem as if he might restore order. Instead, he lost service twice in the set thereafter, leaving clues of \u00adincreasing \u00addesperation with drop shots that fluttered into the net and even a moment late as Wawrinka served at 4-5 when Djokovic halted a point to hope for a missed line call.\n\nVideo technology upheld that Wawrinka\u2019s shot had landed on the line, and Djokovic lost the point. Soon, the tournament lost the 32-year-old No. 1 seed who had won four of the past five Grand Slam tournaments, including this year\u2019s Wimbledon in a donnybrook with Roger Federer and this year\u2019s Australian Open in a masterful rout of Rafael Nadal.\n\nThose two victims probably bolted immediately to the minds of fans after Djokovic\u2019s sixth career retirement in a Grand Slam but only his second since 2009. If Federer and Nadal wind up meeting here in the final Sunday, it would snuff a longtime quirk in the sport and become their first U.S. Open meeting after four meetings in Melbourne, six in Paris at the French Open and four at Wimbledon.\n\n[On Tennis: Novak Djokovic isn\u2019t Roger Federer or Rafael Nadal, but he\u2019s still one of the greats]\n\nIt will be the 34-year-old Swiss Wawrinka who will oppose the hottest player of the ATP Tour summer, No. 5 Daniil Medvedev of Russia, in a quarterfinal, and it figures to mark Wawrinka\u2019s second straight round as a crowd favorite. The last two rounds for Medvedev, a 23-year-old with an occasional temper, have featured boisterous set-tos with Louis Armstrong Stadium audiences. The winner of Wawrinka-Medvedev will play the winner of Federer\u2019s quarterfinal with Grigor Dimitrov, the 28-year-old Bulgarian who eased through the rising Australian Alex de Minaur, 7-5, 6-3, 6-4.\n\n\u201cSorry he had to retire to finish the game like that, but for me, most important is the way I\u2019m playing, the way I\u2019m moving,\u201d said Wawrinka, perched at No. 24 in the rankings after his trip to the depths. The 2014 Australian Open, 2015 French Open and 2016 U.S. Open champion added, \u201cTonight I think was really high level.\u201d\n\n[Naomi Osaka ousts Coco Gauff at U.S. Open with a win that showcased more than just her skill]\n\nHe also said, \u201cI was hitting really hard the ball\u201d \u2014 which proved utterly true late in the second set as Djokovic strained for ways to get points and Wawrinka built confidence. He had just 19 unforced errors to Djokovic\u2019s 35 and won 11 of his 12 service games. His one-handed backhand often stirred gasps again.\n\n\u201cLook, I congratulate Stan,\u201d Djokovic said, soon calling Wawrinka \u201ca big-matches player. He loves to play on the big stage against the best players of the world. It\u2019s what got him three Slams and Olympic gold and everything.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also part of what got Djokovic to a whopping 16 Grand Slams, just below Nadal\u2019s 18 and Federer\u2019s 20, but something seemed imperfect here even as Djokovic generally declined to discuss it. In wins over Roberto Carballes Baena, Juan Ignacio Londero and Denis Kudla and then again soon before retiring Sunday night, Djokovic often took visits from the trainer to tend to his left shoulder. He would sit down, and his shirt would come off.\n\nAfter a third game of the third set in which he looked lost, he made the formalities of retiring and then made for the exit. Boos came, and Djokovic said: \u201cLook, I\u2019m not being offended by, you know, mistreated by anybody. I don\u2019t really, you know, pay too much attention to that. You know, I like to respect others. I hope that others can respect me and my decision. I\u2019m sorry for the crowd. Obviously they came to see a full match, and just wasn\u2019t to be. That\u2019s all it is.\u201d", "description": "The 16-time Grand Slam champion had lost the first two sets and was trailing in the third.", "authors": ["Chuck Culpepper", "Reporter Who Covers National College Football", "College Basketball", "Tennis", "Golf", "International Sports.", "September At Am", "Chuck Culpepper Covers National College Sports", "As Well As Some Tennis", "Some Golf"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/n5RX6soX5Svtor1XqGTBj4UMhm4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JOSHJGWNF4I6TDA4PSHOPBNYKU.jpg"}
