Add Interest\n\n\"It\u2019s hard,\" Duchess Meghan told ITV News at Ten anchor Tom Bradby for the documentary, \"Harry & Meghan: An African Journey.\" \"I don\u2019t think anybody could understand that.\"\n\n\"In all fairness I had no idea, which probably sounds difficult to understand and hear,\" said Meghan, who was the California-born star of \"Suits\" when she met Harry. \"But when I first met my now-husband, my friends were really happy because I was so happy but my British friends said to me, \u2018I\u2019m sure he\u2019s great but you shouldn\u2019t do it because the British tabloids will destroy your life.\u2019\"\n\nTune into \u201cHarry & Meghan: An African Journey,\" hosted by \"Good Morning America\" co-anchor Robin Roberts, on Wednesday, Oct. 23, at 10 p.m. ET, on ABC Television Network.\n\n\"And I very naively -- I\u2019m American. We don\u2019t have that there -- [I said], \u2018What are you talking about? That doesn\u2019t make any sense. I\u2019m not in any tabloids,'\" said the duchess. \"I didn\u2019t get it. So it\u2019s been, yeah, it\u2019s been complicated.\"\n\nABCNews.com\n\n\"Harry & Meghan: An African Journey\" -- which airs in the U.S. on Wednesday, Oct. 23, at 10 p.m. ET, on ABC Television Network -- follows the couple during their 10-day tour of Southern Africa earlier this month.\n\nHigh moments on the tour -- which included their son Archie's meeting human rights activist Desmond Tutu and Meghan's engaging with women in South Africa as a \"woman of color and as your sister\" -- are featured in the film. Yet, the documentary also explores what has been happening behind the scenes for the couple.\n\nBradby later described Harry and Meghan in an essay about the documentary as \"a couple who clearly feel under the most extreme pressure and seem, at times, to be buckling beneath it.\"\n\nMeghan spoke candidly to Bradby about what she described as unfair treatment by some members of the British press.\n\n\u201c \u201d I never thought that this would be easy but I thought it would be fair\n\n\"The biggest thing that I know is that I never thought that this would be easy but I thought it would be fair,\" she said. \"And that\u2019s the part that\u2019s really hard to reconcile but, I don\u2019t know, just take each day as it comes.\"\n\nMeghan, who has seen endless headlines splashed about her family and herself, also brought up fairness when asked about the counter argument that, yes, she faces public scrutiny but she also lives a life of power and privilege.\n\n\"If things are fair, that completely tracks for me if things are fair,\" said Meghan, who wed Prince Harry last year. \"If I do something wrong I\u2019d be the first one to go, \u2018Oh my gosh, I\u2019m so sorry. I would never do that,\u2019 but when people are saying things that are just untrue and they\u2019re being told they\u2019re untrue but they\u2019re allowed to still say them, I don\u2019t know anybody in the world who would feel that that\u2019s okay. And that\u2019s different than just scrutiny. That\u2019s, what would you call that? That\u2019s a different beast. It\u2019s really a different beast.\"\n\n\"And I think the grass is always greener,\" Meghan added. \"You have no idea. It\u2019s really hard to understand what it\u2019s like. I know what it seems like it should be. It\u2019s a very different thing. That\u2019s okay. The good thing is I\u2019ve got my baby and I\u2019ve got my husband and they\u2019re the best.\"\n\nTune into \u201cHarry & Meghan: An African Journey,\" hosted by \"Good Morning America\" co-anchor Robin Roberts, on Wednesday, Oct. 23, at 10 p.m. ET, on ABC Television Network.\n\nWhen asked whether she thinks she can continue on with the pressures of her very public life, Meghan described an ongoing conversation she says she has with Harry.\n\n\"I\u2019ve said for a long time to H -- that\u2019s what I call him -- it\u2019s not enough to just survive something. That\u2019s not the point of life,\" Meghan said. \"You\u2019ve got to thrive. You\u2019ve got to feel happy.\"\n\n\"I think I really tried to adopt this British sensibility of a stiff upper lip. I tried. I really tried,\" she added. \"But I think that what that does internally is probably really damaging.\"\n\nCourtesy ITN Productions\n\nThe documentary was underway at the same time that Harry and Meghan announced legal action by Meghan against a British tabloid over privacy concerns.\n\nShortly after they left South Africa, Buckingham Palace confirmed that Harry had also started legal action against some U.K. media outlets with regard to \"the illegal interception of voicemail messages.\"\n\nBefore any of that was made public, Harry spoke to Bradby about the pressures he feels to protect his family today, more than two decades after the 1997 death of his mother Princess Diana in a Paris car crash that involved paparazzi.\n\n\"My mum clearly taught me a certain set of values of which I will always try and uphold despite the role and the job that sometimes that entails, if you know what I mean,\" Harry said. \"But I think, I will always protect my family and now I have a family to protect.\"\n\n\"So everything that she went through and what happened to her is incredibly raw every single day and that\u2019s not me being paranoid that\u2019s just me not wanting a repeat of the past,\" he said. \"And if anybody else knew what I knew, be it a father, be it a husband, be it anyone, you\u2019d probably be doing exactly what I\u2019m doing as well.\"\n\nOne of the most poignant moments of Harry and Meghan's trip came when Harry retraced Princess Diana's footsteps at a former active landmine minefield in Angola.\n\nHarry described his mom's death to Bradby as a \"wound that festers.\" He said dealing with the pressure of his royal life and the grief over his mother's death is something that takes \"constant management.\"\n\n\"I thought I was out of the woods and then suddenly it all came back and I suddenly realized, no, actually this is something that I have to manage,\" he said. \"Part of this job and part of any job, like everybody, means putting on a brave face and turning a cheek to a lot of the stuff but, again, for me and for my wife of course there\u2019s a lot of stuff that hurts, especially when the majority of it is untrue.\"\n\n\u201c \u201d I will not be bullied into playing a game that killed my mum\n\n\"But all we need to do is focus on being real and focus on being the people that we are and standing up for what we believe in,\" Harry continued. \"I will not be bullied into playing a game that killed my mum.\"\n\nTune into \u201cHarry & Meghan: An African Journey,\" hosted by \"Good Morning America\" co-anchor Robin Roberts, on Wednesday, Oct. 23, at 10 p.m. ET, on ABC Television Network.\n\nHarry has in the past credited his older brother, Prince William, with encouraging him to seek help for his mental health in the years after their mom died.\n\nBritish tabloid headlines have more recently suggested a rift between the two brothers, the only children of Prince Charles and Princess Diana. Harry addressed the rumors in his interview with Brady.\n\n\"Part of this role and part of this job and this family being under the pressure that it\u2019s under \u2026 stuff happens,\" he said. \"But look we\u2019re brothers. We\u2019ll always be brothers.\"\n\n\"We\u2019re certainly on different paths at the moment but I will always be there for him and as I know he\u2019ll always be there for me,\" Harry added. \"We don\u2019t see each other as much as we used to because we\u2019re so busy but I love him dearly.\"\n\n\"The majority of the stuff is created out of nothing but as brothers it\u2019s just as I said, you have good days, you have bad days,\" he said.", "description": "The royals spoke out in the documentary", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/Harry-Meghan-AnAfricanJourney-ITN-ht-ls-191017_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
