Donald Trump waited on the other end. All Hassan Rouhani, the Iranian president, had to do was come out of his hotel suite and walk into a secure room where Mr Trump\u2019s voice would be piped in via speaker.\n\nMr Rouhani and his aides were blindsided by the offer, presented to them by Emmanuel Macron, the French president, on an unannounced visit last Tuesday night to their quarters at the Millennium Hilton Hotel near the United Nations, where world leaders had converged for the annual General Assembly.\n\nIt was a mission lifted out of a Hollywood thriller. Mr Macron has sought for months to broker a thaw in the standoff between the United States and Iran, which has threatened to escalate into a new Middle East war.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Messages were passed between them via Mr Rouhani\u2019s aides.\n\nIn the end, Mr Rouhani refused even to come out of his room. Mr Macron left empty-handed and Mr Trump was left hanging.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. The Islamic Republic of Iran 40 years on Show all 20 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

In Iran, hard-liners rebuked Mr Rouhani for having spoken to Mr Obama.\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "The telephone line had been secretly set up. Donald Trump waited on the other end.
