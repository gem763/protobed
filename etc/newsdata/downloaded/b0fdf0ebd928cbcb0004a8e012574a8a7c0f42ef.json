He\u2019s so impotent he can\u2019t get an election.\n\nCorbyn ordering his troops to abstain again means Johnson will fail a third time to get his needed two-thirds majority in Parliament.\n\nYes, Corbyn looks like a chicken, but better that than being a turkey risking a vote for Christmas.\n\nI question whether the Tory Grinch really desires an immediate election campaign.\n\nThe ComRes poll showing Labour ahead on 27% if the EU leaving deadline is extended beyond October 31, putting Corbyn\u2019s party marginally in front of the Tories on 26%, will send a chill through No10.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nNigel Farage\u2019s Brextremist Party on 20% could bite big chunks out of a working class vote Johnson had hoped to devour.\n\nPrivileged Old Etonian entitled posh boy Johnson wanted to have his cake and eat it, demanding Labour give him an easy timetable to deliver Brexit and that election.\n\nCorbyn was right to hold fire. The clocks go back on Sunday so Labour\u2019s massive army of foot soldiers would be neutralised as it is dark by 5pm. It would have been the first December clash since 1923.\n\nThe bold strategy is to fight Johnson\u2019s bad Brexit and prepare for decision day next March.", "description": "The Prime Minister's demands are a smokescreen to cover his latest failure", "authors": ["Kevin Maguire", "Image", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20720579.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_BRITAIN-EU-POLITICS-BREXIT.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
