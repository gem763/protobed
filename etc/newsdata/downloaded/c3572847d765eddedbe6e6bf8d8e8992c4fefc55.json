Obviously we are just good friends.\u2019\n\nIt seems she\u2019s still on good terms with Chris too as she added: \u2018The Hemsworths are a beautiful family. It is a strong community in Byron and I am so grateful to have so many beautiful friends there.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to her role in Home and Away, Isabel has gone on to star in Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, MacGyver, Immortals and Red Dawn, the latter of which saw her co-star with Chris again. Isabel also had a starring role in Ed Sheeran\u2019s 2012 music video for Give Me Love.\n\nLiam was said to have turned to Isabel after his split from Miley (Picture: WireImage)\n\nChris did actually date Isabel in the mid-noughties (Picture: Rex Features)\n\nIn August, a source told Woman\u2019s Day of Isabel and Liam: \u2018Liam\u2019s in Byron staying with Chris. Isabel moves in the same social circles up there, and they\u2019ve spent some time together.\n\n\u2018They\u2019ve become quite good friends. She\u2019s there to take his mind off things, and she\u2019s been an excellent person to turn to for advice.\u2019\n\nThey added: \u2018She\u2019s in Europe at the moment and feels bad she\u2019s jetted out during the worst of it for Liam, but even so, she\u2019s been keeping in touch via text.\u2019\n\nFollowing his shock split from Miley, Liam was most recently thought to have been dating Dynasty actress Maddison Brown after they were spotted enjoying PDA on a date.\n\nAn insider told HollywoodLife at the time of their romantic dinner date: \u2018He appeared to be a gentleman throughout. They were holding hands and he held her close while opening doors for her when they stepped outside to get to their table. They were in zero rush and were there for over an hour.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018He requested a table outside to enjoy the weather. No one recognised him or most of the other patrons played dumb because they weren\u2019t bugging him or them at all.\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, Miley struck up a romance with Kaitlynn Carter just a day after their marriage split was announced, but is now dating Cody Simpson.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
