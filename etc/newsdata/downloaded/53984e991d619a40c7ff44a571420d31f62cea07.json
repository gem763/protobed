How could that really be faked?\" she said. \"That's crazy. My mom is not that type of girl.\"\n\n\"She\u2019s very genuine. She\u2019s very real, and for her to put on a cast and be walking around and acting as if it\u2019s fake \u2013 it\u2019s wild,\" she added. \"But, you know, anyone who spews hatred needs more love, so love ya girl.\"\n\nBrinkley-Cook's pro partner Val Chmerkovskiy added \"no one's expecting an apology from Wendy Williams,\" but joked that when Brinkley's arm heals \"she'll get that apology from Wendy Williams,\" while shaking a fist.\n\nBrinkley-Cook began competing on the show after her mother broke her arm during rehearsals, which \"DWTS\" showed in a harrowing clip during the September season premiere.\n\n\"My arm! My arm! My arm!\" a grimacing Brinkley kept repeating, as Chmerkovskiy provided support. \"I think I broke my arm, I swear to God.\"\n\nSailor Brinkley-Cook, filling in for her injured mother, Christie Brinkley, performs a fox-trot with pro partner Valentin Chmerkovskiy on ABC's' Dancing With the Stars.' (Photo: Eric McCandless, ABC)\n\nAfter Brinkley bowed out of the competition, Williams accused her of faking her injury on \"The Wendy Williams Show,\" saying video of the fall \"looked fake as hell.\"\n\nThe TV host said she didn't \"see a wrist and a shoulder being fractured.\" Williams theorized Brinkley planned the injury right after \"DWTS\" hired her and knew \"that she'd put her daughter Sailor in there.\"\n\nChristie Brinkley shows off graphic bruise: Star works to silence 'DWTS' critics\n\nIn a subsequent interview with People, Brinkley said she was \u201ctotally shocked, because I have been there for Wendy Williams.\" She added: \"That is so weird. I have to give her a call \u2026 I\u2019m really stunned.\"\n\nWith fresh support from Trump, Sean Spicer dishes on his 'Dancing With the Stars' survival\n\nThough Brinkley-Cook and Chmerkovskiy were eliminated during Monday's emotional episode, the novice dancer recalled her mom's advice following the disappointment.\n\n\u201cShe just told me that, you know, things like this happen in life, and everything leads to some other great door opening,\" Brinkley-Cook said. \"Literally our team name is 'c\u2019est la vie' \u2013 c\u2019est la vie, such is life. This stuff happens, and I'm just so lucky that I had this experience.\"\n\nThe \"DWTS\" contestant added she's proud of the progress she made on the show, especially given her last-minute entry into the competition.\n\n\"I never in a million years would\u2019ve thought that I would have been on this show. I didn\u2019t sign up, I didn\u2019t do the press trip before,\" she said. \"I literally jumped in for the first performance, and I\u2019m just lucky that I made it to week six and I got to experience all of this.\"\n\nIs \"DWTS\" still in the future for Brinkley? According to Chmerkovskiy, the model certainly hopes so.\n\n\u201cIt's funny. When it happened, 30 seconds into her literally shattering her arm, she asked, 'Can I do this next season?' \" he said Wednesday. \"She was having a blast.\"\n\nContributing: Bill Keveney\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/10/23/christie-brinkley-daughter-sailor-brinkley-cook-hits-back-wendy-williams/4078087002/", "description": "When Christie Brinkley quit \"Dancing with the Stars,\" Wendy Williams said her injury \"looked fake as hell.\" Now, Sailor Brinkley-Cook is speaking out.", "authors": ["Charles Trepany", "Published P.M.
