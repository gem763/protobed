In Iowa, some prominent Democrats are privately urging struggling campaigns to stay in the contest even if they cannot qualify for the debates, incredulous that metrics imposed by national Democratic Party officials could stamp out lesser contenders \u2014 a perceived infringement on what is traditionally the first caucus state\u2019s job.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats raising money for down-ticket candidates are complaining that the presidential candidates\u2019 imperative to raise money to meet debate thresholds is drawing attention away from congressional and state house contests \u2014 and perverting the Democratic Party\u2019s messaging overall.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a national primary based on the worst foundation: Name identification and money,\u201d said Dave Nagle, a former congressman and Iowa state Democratic Party chairman. \u201cAnd we\u2019re supposed to be the party of ideas.\u201d\n\nMorning Score newsletter Your guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nInstead, thanks to months of non-stop, $1 fundraising appeals, the campaign has, in some ways, come to resemble a pledge drive on PBS.\n\nThere was Tom Steyer, a billionaire, asking Facebook users, \u201cCan you contribute even one dollar?\u201d Or Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, before she dropped out, pleading, \u201cWill you donate just one dollar today? \u2026 Please help me now. It makes all the difference.\u201d\n\nLast week, actor Jeff Bridges aired a video for Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, telling his audience, \u201cWhat I\u2019d love you to do is send a buck in to my good buddy.\u201d\n\nIn a nod to the oddity of the ask, Bridges said it only mattered that Bullock be heard.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if you vote for somebody else,\u201d he said.\n\nFor candidates, qualifying for debates has become a significant marker of viability, forcing them to spend early on social media to inflate their ranks of small-dollar donors and influence polls in early nominating states. But none of the debates so far has appeared to leave a lasting mark on the campaign.\n\nIn part, that is a function of the debate rules, as well.\n\nRandomly selected stages split over two nights for the first two sets of debates kept Joe Biden, the front-runner, apart from Elizabeth Warren, his ascendant challenger from the progressive wing of the party. They met this month for the third debate, which was reduced to one night, but could be separated again in October, when the field will grow again and could be split over two debates.\n\nFollowing the debate in Houston this month, Texas Democratic Party Chairman Gilberto Hinojosa said, \u201cAt the end of the day the front-runners are still the front-runners \u2026 Nobody said anything new.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThe only thing the debates are doing now is either disqualifying you or giving you more points to stay in the next debate.\u201d\n\nIn Iowa, Nagle said he has called a handful of candidates who he said are at risk of dropping out, lamenting that \u201cthey\u2019re being excluded without even being given the benefit of a vote.\u201d\n\nMichael Fitzgerald, Iowa\u2019s Democratic state treasurer, said long-shot presidential candidates could once plan \u2014 and save their money for \u2014 a potential late surge in Iowa. Now, he said, \u201cI see these candidates, they have to sit down and decide, \u2018Oh, my God, do we spend our money just to get into the debates so you can hear our voice?\u2018\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to strategize to stay ahead of\u201c the Democratic National Committee.\n\nThe ramifications extend to other states and contests, as well.\n\nDaniel Squadron, a former New York state senator who directs the Future Now Fund, a national group working to elect Democrats in state races, said the debate fundraising rules at the presidential level \u201cencourages candidates to soak up all of the resources and the attention \u2014 and does nothing to encourage candidates to help build something beyond themselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cCandidates shouldn\u2019t just be measured on their online fundraising or national polls,\u201d he said, arguing that a fraction of the total small-dollar fundraising by presidential candidates this year could shift the balance of power in significant state elections.\n\nTwo Democratic strategists working in Iowa and New Hampshire said they have had difficulty organizing small-dollar fundraising events with presidential contenders for their candidates, despite the political advantage presidential candidates often seek from such appearances. Because the presidential candidates need to inflate their small-dollar numbers, both strategists said, they have been less willing to share.\n\nThis election cycle, one of the strategists said, \u201cI don\u2019t think down-ballot candidates have been a huge priority.\u201d\n\nRep. Eric Swalwell, who participated in the first debate but abandoned his campaign in July, said the DNC was right to impose rules to \u201cpare down the field.\u201d But he also said the party should \u201cmaybe go back to the drawing board to figure out how you don\u2019t have to bankrupt the campaigns to the point where a lot of us were spending more on the email programs to get a dollar than we were getting back.\u201d\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201907/3465/1155968404_6056697923001_6056694335001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true\n\nSwalwell, of California, said, \u201cThat\u2019s money that could be going to voter contact or field staffers out in Iowa and New Hampshire, and instead there\u2019s this obsession with \u2026. a one-dollar fundraising appeal.\u201d\n\nPresidential elections have long been marred by controversy surrounding debate criteria, and the DNC was unlikely to escape criticism no matter what it did.\n\nThe debate rules, first announced in February, were conceived after months of deliberation and a pledge by DNC Chairman Tom Perez to repair rifts that flared within the party during the 2016 contest between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. The party also sought to avoid the spectacle of the \u201cundercard\u201d debates in the Republican presidential primary that year.\n\nAs a result, the party published an early schedule of debates and began with relatively low fundraising and polling thresholds to maximize participation. It added its fundraising threshold after concluding \u2014 as many pollsters had \u2014 that early polling in a large primary might not accurately reflect a candidate\u2019s strength.\n\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t connect with the grassroots and engage the grassroots in multi-faceted, meaningful ways, you can\u2019t win the presidency,\u201d Perez said. \u201cWhen I hear the critique that our grassroots fundraising threshold catalyzed perverse behavior, with all due respect, we gave candidates unprecedented access to earned media, not just through the debates and the low threshold for getting on the debates, but we worked with CNN and MSNBC \u2014 don\u2019t just do a town hall with the perceived front-runners, give everybody a shot.\u201d\n\nFollowing the Houston debate, Perez said complaints by Iowans about the debate qualification rules diminishing their stature are \u201cludicrous,\u201d noting that billionaire Tom Steyer had met his polling threshold by qualifying in early state \u2014 not national \u2014 polls.\n\nPredictably, the candidates\u2019 view of the debate process has hewed closely to its effect on their own campaigns. Low-polling candidates who are still running but failed to qualify complain loudly. Some middle-tier candidates quietly lament that the stage is too crowded, depriving them of a confrontation with the front-runners. The front-runners don\u2019t complain.\n\nAnd then there's Andrew Yang, the once-little known entrepreneur whose rise in the primary took the field by surprise. He told POLITICO of the qualification thresholds recently that \u201cI\u2019m Asian, so I love tests.\u201d\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/22/ae/7e60d6384f7a9ada12fe622e6aed/yangregular.png\"\n\nHe said knowing how many donors and polls he needs has been \u201cincredibly helpful, because then you just know what to aim for.\"\n\nDavid Axelrod, a top adviser to former President Barack Obama, said the qualification standards have been helpful to the party, too.\n\n\"What [Perez] did was ultimately quite fair, which was to say, \u2018I\u2019m going to give you all time to prove that you should be on that stage in terms of support,\u2019 and he did. And most candidates \u2014 most of the candidates \u2014 got the benefit of being in two debates.\u201d\n\nHe suggested the DNC should raise the standard again for the November contest, the prospect of which candidates are already urgently referencing in fundraising appeals. If, as expected, the Democratic National Committee does raises its thresholds, there are almost certain to be casualties.\n\n\u201cAt some point you\u2019ve got to get down to the candidates who have a serious chance to be the nominee, and by leveraging up the qualifications to get in the debate, I think he created a test,\u201d Axelrod said. \u201cI just think the process of getting down to those people who are actually competing for the nomination is an important service.\u201d", "description": "The debate qualifications are now metastasizing in unexpected ways.", "authors": ["David Siders", "John F.
