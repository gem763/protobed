It can affec any of us and it touches all of us. Our sisters, our mothers, our daughters, our friends. The research saves lives. Research is the reason millions of breast cancer survivors are thriving today. Join lifetime to support the breast cancer research foundation. Together, let's stop breast cancer for life. Back here on \"Gma.\" I was really honored to be a part of the psa from our sister network lifetime along with Megan and Jesse. This is the 25th anniversary of lifetime's annual stop breast cancer for life. A commitment to supporting research which is always so very key and in case you haven't noticed we're going pink. We're going pink right here on \"Gma\" raising awareness about breast cancer, celebrating fighters and thrivers here. You see them holding up their signs that shows the years they have been thriving. Six years. Six years. Yeah. For you. Yeah. You spent time with a very remarkable woman. A story of a woman celebrating her one year, Janna Geyer felt a lump and despite being told she was too young for a mammogram she followed her instincts and that saved her life. Most of Janna Geyer's days are spent chasing her daughter ava. But in February 2018 her world came to a screeching halt. I was saying good-bye to my husband. When I put my arms out I noticed I felt something in my right breast and it happened to have been a lump. Reporter: Little did she know this would mark the start of her breast cancer journey at just 33 years old. I was the picture of health. I have no family history. I'm not a smoker and I'm not a drinker. So on paper you would definitely not think that someone like me would have breast cancer. Reporter: Janna says she went to the doctor that day for a breast exam who confirmed the palpable mass and said she needed an ultrasound and mammogram. When she called the hospital to make her appointments she said they told her she was too young for the mammogram. They said the ultrasound would suffice and the radiologist had told me based on the imaging we believe this is a fluid filled benign breast cyst and it is quite large so we want you to keep an eye on it. Reporter: Relieved it appeared to be benign she said she moved on and yet she still felt the lump. She says her doctors aspirated it twice and ran wests but other symptoms like redness and swelling started to appear. Seven months after she first found that lump she had the cyst surgically removed then got a phone call. I'll never forgot that day, October 1st, 2018. The doctor told me, Janna, the results came in and it is positive for breast cancer. Reporter: She was diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma and immediately began five months of chemotherapy followed by a double mastectomy. A month of radiation and now hormone therapy. I definitely wonder if I would have had a mammogram would they have seen there was something else there? Reporter: According to medal experts mammography screening below 50 is a completion clinical decision due to potential high risks of false positives, overdiagnosis and possible unnecessary aggressive treatment that may not lower now in recovery, Janna says she's so grateful to be alive and is making her mess her message by starting the #checkyourself movement encouraging women to be their own health advocates. There is nobody that's going to fight for you like you. And Dr. Jen Ashton is here and Janna is here in your audience on her one-year to the day thrive anniversary and I see the emotion flooding your face and we all know it too well. How are you feeling today, congratulations. Thank you. I am feeling amazing. Being here today is such an honor. I followed both of your stories and it was so influential in my journey and I want to thank you for sharing it publicly and for women like me and women like me all over this world, thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Can you imagine, you know, many of us have had a mammogram. Can you imagine doing it live on television? This woman did this. She did this. And everybody thought -- I know. And everybody thought, oh, it's going -- it's a gimmick. You are trying to do whatever. You discovered through that mammogram live on television later your doctor followed up with you. What advice -- first of all, how are you? I'm doing great because of you. You nudged me into that mammogram and I appreciate that and I was doing it for other women, never thinking, so this is my six-year -- today I had the live mammogram. October 1 so we share that, right? But I don't -- I mean, you are -- I mean, I saw you were your own health advocate. That's one piece of advice you gave me and it's such a feeling of strength to give to other women to say, hey, you have to say something isn't right. I'm not going to accept you telling me nothing is wrong and you have that fight in you and I hope that your story and I know it will inspire so many other women out there who just feel like something isn't right and their doctors are telling them you're too young. But as you say, age, there's no It doesn't discriminate. It doesn't care what you look like, age or anything like that I like to say I'm the class of 2007 and the class of 2012 is how I phrase it. You obviously had your breast cancer journey. You shared it with the entire world and then you had this surprise five years later. Right, but I have to say we don't talk about post treatment, what happens and I don't know about you, we talked about it and it's really funny. We don't really talk about it that much. We don't. We did in the beginning but, you know, time moves on but we appreciate this opportunity to do it but I wish somebody had told me that I would go through depression after treatment. That's right. No one ever tells you that. You're so scared. You're like, okay. Now what. You've been watching me all this time. Now you're not watching me any longer. I remember someone telling me you're going to wake up one morning and realize you've gone days without thinking about it. Then you told me that too. Right. You said I promise you there will be a day where you won't think about breast cancer. I know and I say that to everyone who is going through I know it doesn't seem that way now, but you do do that. That's true. Dr. Jen, help us here. As we have have been talking about. You doing initiative. How do we deal with these changes and recommendations and what to do and not to do. I think first of all you all have done so much as Janna said to increase awareness, to give people home and inspiration but the world of cancer is not just about treating the cancer and then sending someone on their way. It's about treating the whole person, not a body part and a big part of that is anticipating and helping with the emotional roller coaster that is absolutely not just common but normal afterwards. You both went through it. I'm sure you did too, Janna and everyone here. I think it's really important to use a community of support around that and then the controversy about screening is still there and I think that's because every time we hear new guidelines listen for these words, for the average risk woman. Most women are average risk until the day they get that diagnosis. So it's not one size fits all. Everything has to be individualized and there is a difference between sending someone for a screening mammogram and a diagnose those tick mammogram. How would you encourage people to challenge their doctor? This is not a dictatorship. So ask questions. You're not insulting your doctor. I got chills when you said the average risk because as I said, I had zero family history. Zero family history so I was of average risk so just ask. You know, a good health care provider, a good doctor will never be I suled by a question. I don't know if you do this on your five year. She climbed kilimanjaro. And now she's working on next month running a marathon. Anything but average. I just feel like if I do have any advice for you, live, live like there's no tomorrow. I live like a country music song. Thank you all and please know we recognize that men also, men also go through breast cancer and we recognize that as well but thank you for those who have stood by us. Those of us who are continuing to be warriors, so proud of each and every one of you and those watching us at home that we are here for you as well. We'll be right back.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "description": "Jana Geyer is encouraging women to be their own health advocates after doctors failed to diagnose her breast cancer early on.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/191001_gma_robach2_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
