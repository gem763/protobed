This debate serves no one \u2014 except, that is, other, less progressive contenders.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Sanders and Warren campaign differently. Sanders calls for a \u201cpolitical revolution,\u201d while Warren refers to herself as a \u201ccapitalist.\u201d Sanders possesses a talent for pitching transformative policy in a simple way. Warren offers a sophisticated understanding of how the regulatory process has been manipulated by powerful interests, and she has an ability to explain that fact compellingly to a degree almost unheard of in a major national candidate.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut Sanders and Warren share similar progressive politics. Both offer a strong moral voice that gets results \u2014 just watch her take apart now-former Wells Fargo chief executive John Stumpf. \u201cYou should resign,\u201d she told him. Less than a month later, he was out of a job. As for Sanders, it\u2019s easy to take swings at Medicare-for-all but it\u2019s impossible to deny the phrase has entered the vernacular and shifted the health-care debate, much the way the issue of income and wealth inequality achieved new visibility with Occupy Wall Street\u2019s division of the population into the 99 percent and 1 percent.\n\nSo why aren\u2019t the pair\u2019s assets widely acknowledged by those who should know better? Well, on one hand, no small number of people in the Democratic Party sphere do not want to concede Sanders\u2019s political talent. Yes, it can sound to cynical progressives and moderates as though he\u2019s promising ponies \u2014 to borrow Hillary Clinton\u2019s somewhat bitter after-the-fact assessment \u2014 but technocratic and moderate Democrats could stand to remember nudges don\u2019t get people excited and committed.\n\nBut when it comes to Warren, there is something else at work. It\u2019s hard not to suspect a number of committed lefty partisans lack patience with her style of leadership. Warren got her start as a teacher, and that influences how she convinces others to this day. As Warren told New York magazine\u2019s Rebecca Traister, teaching is \u201cfundamentally about figuring out where the student is and how far I can bring them from where they are.\u201d In other words, she reels people in slowly, step by persuasive step. In a nation where a plurality of people claim they are moderate, even as large numbers say they say they want to see action on climate change and a Medicare expansion, this is no small skill and it shouldn\u2019t be taken for granted.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGiven that Sanders and Warren\u2019s combined support in most polls either approaches or slightly exceeds Biden\u2019s. It\u2019s not unexpected that many would begin to ask them to consolidate their support. But it\u2019s jumping the gun. While many appear to lazily assume the current Warren and Sanders supporters are interchangeable, that\u2019s just not so. Polls show Warren\u2019s support skews older, whiter, female and more highly educated. Sanders\u2019s base is younger, less educated and earns less money. Surveys show a not insignificant number of his supporters would turn to Biden \u2014 hardly a proponent of revolutionary change \u2014 if he pulled out. As for Warren partisans, more would go to Sanders if she exited than anyone else, but Biden and Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) combined get significantly more of them than the senator from Vermont \u2014 again, not exactly progressive champions. In other words, is not a given that Sanders and Warren voters will magically accrue to the other if one or the other drops out now. That likely goes double if voters begin to think their own candidate was dissed or insulted in the process. Voters, alas, are not always logical.\n\nTo debate the merits of Sanders vs. Warren while Biden maintains a commanding lead is a fight made for social media, where opinion is routinely passed off as fact and minor differences of opinion have a way of turning into major fights. But it\u2019s the opposite of good strategy. It\u2019s harmful to the greater progressive cause. Both Warren and Sanders appear capable of leading a movement for change. Show patience. There\u2019s time to let voters work it out.\n\nRead more:\n\nRob Stutzman: Why Elizabeth Warren is the one to watch\n\nHenry Olsen: Elizabeth Warren is gaining ground.
