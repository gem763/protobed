They became concerned and called the police and ambulance. They turned up and checked on me. They came up to my room to make sure I was fine.\n\n\"My parents were already there. Then this person must have called again and the ambulance turned up at around 4pm and we had a quick chat on the doorstep. He said it was a lovely house.\n\n\"I wasn't speaking to this person for a reason and they were worried about my safety because I wasn't answering the phone. I was perfectly fine, we all had a chat and carried on the day with my parents, we were just hanging up pictures.\"\n\n(Image: MirrorOnline)\n\n(Image: LightRocket via Getty Images)\n\nArg added: \u201cThe police and paramedics were only here for about ten minutes.
