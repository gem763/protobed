(James Lawler Duggan/Reuters)\n\nThe Trump administration announced Tuesday that a combination of restrictive immigration policies has effectively concluded the status quo \u201ccatch and release\u201d system that prevailed under the Obama administration.\n\nActing Secretary Kevin McAleenan explained during a speech before the Council on Foreign Relations that the vast majority of migrant families who enter the country illegally will no longer be eligible for \u201ccatch and release\u201d due to the implementation of policies such as the \u201cMigrant Protection Protocols,\u201d which require that migrants wait in Mexico while their asylum claims are being adjudicated, and extended migrant detentions periods.\n\n\u201cWith some humanitarian and medical exceptions, DHS will no longer be releasing family units from Border Patrol Stations into the interior,\u201d McAleenan said Tuesday. \u201cThis means that for family units, the largest demographic by volume arriving at the border this year, the court-mandated practice of catch and release, due to the inability of DHS to complete immigration proceedings with families detained together in custody, will have been mitigated. This is a vital step in restoring the rule of law and integrity to our immigration system.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration has taken various steps in recent months to eliminate so-called \u201cpull\u201d factors that incentivize illegal immigration. In addition to implementing the Migrant Protection Protocols, the administration has also established licensing agreements with family residential centers that will allow authorities to detain family units for longer than the 20 days prescribed by the Flores agreement.\n\nBeginning next week, the administration will officially transition to returning virtually all migrants to Mexico \u201cswiftly\u201d if they are unable to establish a credible fear of returning to their home country.\n\nMcAleenan said last month that border crossings have declined 43 percent since May, when arrests between ports of entry at the southern border increased for the fourth straight month to 132,887, up from 99,304 arrests in April.\n\nIn April, the White House requested $4.5 billion in emergency funds from Congress to deal with the increasing flow number of migrants illegally crossing the southwest border. Agencies warned earlier this year that they are overwhelmed by the influx of migrants turning up both at ports of entry and between them.", "description": "The Trump administration announced that a combination of restrictive immigration policies has concluded the status quo \"catch and release\" system.", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle", "Andrew C.
