I will not meet with them,\u201d Erdogan said. \u201cThey will meet with their counterparts. I will speak when Trump comes.\u201d\n\nErdogan made these remarks after delivering a defiant speech to the Turkish parliament in which he rejected international criticism of his incursion into Syria and declared he could not be persuaded or intimidated into halting the operation. He said the invasion would only be halted if Syrian Kurdish forces agreed to withdraw to beyond 20 miles from the Turkish border and clear a 550-mile stretch of the Iraqi-Turkish border, including the strategic city of Manbij.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo, who is traveling to Turkey with Pence, insisted the two had \u201cevery expectation that we will meet with President Erdogan.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need them to stand down. We need a ceasefire. At which point, we can begin to put this all back together again,\u201d Pompeo said, despite Erdogan\u2019s insistence that no ceasefire would be offered until the Kurds meet his demands.\n\nErdogan\u2019s communications director, Fahrettin Altun, said on Wednesday that Erdogan changed his mind and would meet with Pence.\n\n\u201cEarlier today, the president told Sky News that he won\u2019t receive a U.S. delegation that is visiting Ankara today. He does plan to meet the U.S. delegation led by VP Pence,\u201d Altun said on Twitter.", "description": "Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan changes his mind and says he will meet with visiting Vice President Mike Pence.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Erdogan-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
