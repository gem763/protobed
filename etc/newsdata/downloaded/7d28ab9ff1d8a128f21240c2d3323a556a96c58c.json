Again, he\u2019s experienced at this, but there are so many plates to spin here, especially with the newcomers on board too (Tuppence Middleton and Imelda Staunton to name but two) and while at times it feels like one very long, very posh montage \u2013 cooking food, getting changed, going to a ball, fixing the boiler, going to a parade \u2013 it\u2019s all so slick and polished it ticks along nicely.\n\nThis is pure \u201cconservative with a small c\u201d escapism: a warm, old-fashioned, cuddly jumper hug of a movie where nothing is too challenging and everyone gets along (more or less). It\u2019s been put together for the legions of fans who are hankering for more from their favourite show, and it delivers just that. Here\u2019s the higher-budget extended-length episode that you can watch with your friends in the cinema, and if you enjoy the series, you\u2019ll enjoy this. That said, again, as a total newcomer, I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it despite the lack of prior knowledge. It\u2019s nice, it\u2019s pretty, it\u2019s witty, it\u2019s Downton.\n\nCons\n\nThat said, I would have benefitted from a glance at a family tree to work out who is who and who is related to whom, and who is in love with whom, and all that sort of practical stuff. It\u2019s fine, like I say, and I admire the filmmakers for realising that they\u2019re making a product \u201cfor the fans\u201d and in so doing resisting the urge to over explain things for the benefit of the newbies, but a quick look at Wikipedia would have made a difference I must say.", "description": "If you enjoy the series, you\u2019ll enjoy this", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p07n7l6q.jpg"}
