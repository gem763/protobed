There was no treason. There was no attempted coup. Those are lies, and dumb lies at that. There were just good people trying to figure out what was true, under unprecedented circumstances,\" he said in May.\n\nUKRAINE CALL TRANSCRIPT SHOWS TRUMP SOUGHT BIDEN PROBE, ASKED ABOUT DNC SERVER -- BUT MADE NO MENTION OF US AID\n\nWhile Comey didn't reveal the reason for his apparent about-face, his tweets came after the administration released a phone transcript that Democrats portrayed as a boost to their impeachment efforts.\n\nThe transcript, although incomplete, did not show an explicit quid pro quo on Trump's part but did show he and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky discussing corruption suspicions surrounding former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nNews of the conversation fueled Democratic calls for impeachment, with acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire scheduled to testify before the House Intelligence Committee Thursday.\n\nFox News' Joseph A.
