The expectation is that more than one monetary policy elephant gun will be taken down off the wall this Thursday.\n\nAt this stage, an easing of between 10 and 20 basis points to the -0.40% deposit rate is almost unanimously expected. It gets interesting after that with the street expecting various options. An exemption on banks excess reserves to the deposit rate cut to ease the pain of negative rates and encourage lending. More Targeted Long-Term Refinancing Operations (TLTRO\u2019s), the resumption of Quantitative Easing (QE) or a combination of all of the above.\n\nWith the 2% inflation target still a Japanese style distant memory and growth slowing in Germany, Europe\u2019s engine, the ECB had to do something. Whatever comes out on Thursday will test the limits of the effectiveness of monetary policy. Europe\u2019s governments, under the yoke of Northern fiscal austerity rules, refuse to come to the party with budgetary stimulus, leaving all the heavy lifting to be done by the ECB. The Japanese did both and still couldn\u2019t get a result. Of the worlds major trading blocs, Europe remains the most hamstrung by its ideology. The summer of monetary love after Thursday\u2019s meeting, may quickly fade to winter if Europe\u2019s economy continues to slow, inflation remains non-existent, and Europe\u2019s governments insist on keeping their heads in the fiscal sand.\n\nExpected cuts from the ECB and the Federal Reserve next week were not enough to lift Wall Street overnight, with this information seemingly priced in for now. The exception to the wait-and-see mode of most of the street was , which shot higher after comments from the new Saudi Arabian Oil Minister.\n\nUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has failed to force a snap election after failing to get the 2/3rds of parliamentary votes required due to mass abstentions. He actually won a vote finally, 293-46, but lost. If that confuses readers, welcome to Brexit! Parliament is now officially suspended until October 15th.\n\nAsia\u2019s highlights will be Australia\u2019s (exp 3), and China YoY Aug (exp 2.60%), both at 0930 SGT. The former is usually suitable for some short-term volatility in the , especially given the underwhelming run of data these past few months from the Lucky Country.\n\nEquities\n\nWall Street continued to tread water overnight, awaiting upcoming central bank meetings and more detail on Washington and Beijiing\u2019s proposed trade talks. The was unchanged, the fell 0.19%, and the Jones rose 0.14%.\n\nAsia is unlikely to rock the boat this morning, and we expect a cautious but positive start to trading, as anticipated impending central bank easings buoy stocks.\n\nFX\n\nOil\n\nThe refused to budge overnight, rising 0.10% to 98.29 as forex markets continue their belligerence ahead of key central bank meetings. \u2019s recovery continued, rising 0.50% to 1.2345 having fallen back from 1.2400 highs. With Parliament now suspended until October 15th, the \u201cBoris-bounce\u201d may have run its course for now. The likelihood of a hard Brexit has receded, but the PM and his advisors now have the key to the house and liquor cabinet while the parents are away. You wouldn\u2019t bet against loud music, some damage and the police being called.\n\nOil rocketed higher overnight as the new Saudi Oil Minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salmon, reiterated his country\u2019s commitment to higher prices by limiting production. Both individually and with their OPEC+ partners.\n\nrose 1.70% to $63.00 a barrel and WTI rose 2.45% to $58.00 a barrel. Actions speaks louder than words though however. Markets will need to see concrete progress on the production front, even as the world\u2019s economy slows, to sustain gains.\n\nSome profit-taking sellers may appear in Asian trading after the impressive overnight gains capping oil. Losses should be limited though, as the street gives the new Saudia oil minister, the benefit of the doubt for now.\n\nGold\n\nThe more positive investing environment continued to take its toll on long positioning overnight. However, the damage was limited. Gold eased 0.50% to $1499.00 an ounce, continuing its orderly retreat.\n\nGold will remain under pressure while monetary and trade dispute euphoria continues. The yellow metal though is giving ground by inches and not yards, suggesting doubts remain about the longevity of the positive environment. Critical support remains at $1480.00 an ounce.\n\nOriginal Post", "description": "Market Overview Analysis by MarketPulse (Jeffrey Halley) covering: GBP/USD, AUD/USD, XAU/USD, S&P 500.
