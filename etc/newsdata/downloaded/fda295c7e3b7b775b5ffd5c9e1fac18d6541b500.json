An annual influx of 28 million tourists (compared to just 55,000 locals) means the calli are crammed with hotels, B&Bs, Airbnbs and self-catering options. Some are mind-blowing, others distinctly mediocre. How to sort the wheat from the chaff?\n\nLet me help. I\u2019ve been staying in Venice hotels since 1999. I visit at least five times a year, stay up to a month at a time, and my hotel fetish means I rarely stay in the same place twice. I\u2019ve stayed in Angelina\u2019s favourite hotel on company budgets, and in barely one-star digs on my own. I\u2019ve stayed in big hitters, and in tiny places with no PR budget. And I\u2019ve learned that you don\u2019t always get what you pay for \u2013 in good ways and in bad.\n\nI don\u2019t care about a place\u2019s reputation, its history or its air miles affiliations \u2013 what I want is great design, unstuffy service and something that connects me to the place I\u2019m in.\n\nStyle and service without breaking the bank \u2013 here at The Independent, it\u2019s something we call real-world luxury. So whether it\u2019s traditional or modern, boutique or big, here are 10 of my favourite places in La Serenissima.\n\nThe Independent's hotel reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust. On some occasions, we earn revenue if you click the links and book, but we never allow this to affect our coverage.\n\nBest for design: Casa Flora\n\nBrought to you by the Romanelli family, locals who own art deco-themed Novecento and the Hotel Flora next door, Casa Flora is a bold attempt to grab the younger, design-centric market with a three-bedroom apartment that\u2019s a hybrid between a fancy Airbnb and a hotel \u2013 and a guaranteed Instagram smash.\n\nIt\u2019s also an attempt at turning Venice tourism sustainable \u2013 everything in the flat, from the marble countertops to the parquet floor, is locally sourced and custom-made. Not that responsible means boring, here \u2013 lush plants drape themselves around the doorways and squat in bathroom basins, those countertops are jade, and the colour palettes revolve around lagoon hues \u2013 eau de nil, grey-blue and dirty creams.\n\nGuests can use the Hotel Flora\u2019s facilities next door, and there\u2019s also a partnership with restaurant Estro, who\u2019ll even send someone to come make you breakfast should you be feeling extravagant. Otherwise, breakfast is served next door in the Flora\u2019s pretty courtyard.\n\nApartment from \u20ac600 (sleeps six), B&B\n\ncasafloravenezia.com\u200b\n\nBest B&B: Cima Rosa\n\nNot your average Venice digs, Cima Rosa is in lesser known Santa Croce, and is also rather more stylish than other affordable options. A 15th-century palazzo that was renovated by its architect and interior design owners, it sits on the Grand Canal (three of the rooms have prime views) yet manages to stay at one remove from the madness.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Owners Daniele and Brittany are hands-on hosts, and the feeling is of a chic friend\u2019s house, rather than a B&B.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac180, B&B\n\ncimarosavenezia.com\u200b\n\nBest surprise: Bauer Palladio\n\nWas there ever a Venice hotel like this? Technically, yes \u2013 its sibling and neighbour, the breathtakingly pricey, Angelina-slept-here, butler-staffed Villa F. But even for those on an A-lister budget, to be honest, the Palladio is nicer. A conversion of a church and house for \u201cfallen women\u201d by 16th-century starchitect Andrea Palladio on Giudecca, the 58 rooms and 21 suites are spread across the main building and two blocks in the gardens.\n\nThe d\u00e9cor in the main building is slightly dated, as you\u2019d expect from 16th-century digs, but the garden buildings are airy, tiki-influenced affairs, with ground-floor rooms opening directly onto the huge gardens, and a wild, flower-filled meadow breaking up the space. And if that sounds boho enough, know that the restaurant is vegan. The only thing missing is a pool.\n\nOpen March-November. Doubles from \u20ac180, B&B\n\npalladiohotelspa.com\n\nBest for atmosphere: Avogaria\n\nYou\u2019ll forget you\u2019re in tourist town at Avogaria, a tiny, five-room residence at the far (read: local) end of Dorsoduro. The atmosphere is cosy \u2013 there\u2019s even a fake cat curled up in the window \u2013 and the rooms a modern take on flouncy Venetian design (think mosaic walls and gilded mirrors), while three junior suites sport private walled gardens.\n\nThe hotel is a spin-off of the owner\u2019s restaurant, so if it all gets too comfy, you can order the menu from room service, too.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac100, B&B\n\navogaria.com\u200b\n\nBest for nightlife: Hotel l\u2019Orologio\n\nTechnically the Hotel l\u2019Orologio (Clock Hotel), it calls itself the Hotel L\u2019O, which tells you something about the clientele. Dispensing with traditional Venetian style, the lobby is a design-led affair themed around antique timepieces, rooms have glowing cog-themed artwork above the headboards, and bright colours and semi-floating beds give a modern feel.\n\nBut despite being in the real world, at the L\u2019O you\u2019re also situated plum on the Grand Canal (some rooms have spectacular views), right by the buzzy bar area that\u2019s sprung up around Rialto Mercato, so you can nip out for cichetti and an ombra (glass of wine) at Naranzaria or Bancogiro.\n\nFor a more self-sufficient stay (and to take advantage of the Rialto market nearby), the hotel has opened two apartments, both overlooking the Grand Canal.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac215, B&B\n\nhotelorologiovenezia.com\n\nBest value: Liassidi Palace\n\nIn a gothic palazzo in Castello, just east of San Marco, the Liassidi Palace has canal views, yet less of a scrum around it than those in the very centre. You\u2019re well located for sightseeing here \u2013 the hotel sits between the Carpaccio paintings at the Scuola di San Giorgio degli Schiavoni and the Greek church with its tipsily leaning spire \u2013 as well as a quick walk to the less populated and more local part of Castello, around San Francesco della Vigna. Just 31 rooms take up the 15th-century palazzo, and the look is classic Venice, with heavy drapes, damask wall-coverings, flouncy headboards and chandeliers aplenty.\n\nA member of the Small Luxury Hotels of the World group, it\u2019s a good combination of affordability and intimacy, just steps from the action.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac128, B&B\n\nliassidipalacehotel.com\u200b\n\nBest grand dame: Centurion Palace\n\nYou may not want to like the Centurion Palace, if you\u2019re in Venice for all things ancient. You may think the idea of gold-plated bathrooms \u2013 literally \u2013 is too much bling, that the modern, silver sculptures glittering in niches on the Grand Canal are \u201cnot authentic\u201d. That the rooms \u2013 plain claret, rust-coloured, brown walls, even \u2013 are too modern for this most refined of cities. And then you\u2019ll get there, and find your fears melt away.\n\nIt turns out that Centurion Palace is Italian-owned, modestly-roomed (there are just 50 in the vast property) and really rather lovely. The bar and restaurant both have seating cantilevered over the Grand Canal; there\u2019s an inhouse cat, Centurione. Where other five-star hotels in Venice tend to be fairly stiff-atmosphered, the service here is notably friendly \u2013 staff are chatty, and conversations go two ways.\n\nWalls are painted in plain, brash colours instead of swaddled in traditional damask and the corridors have modern photography rather than cod-renaissance portraits. And the Dorsoduro location is central but quiet \u2013 squished between the Salute church and Guggenheim collection, a 30-second traghetto ride from the sestiere of San Marco, but a couple of minutes to the Zattere, Venice\u2019s most beautiful waterfront.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac272, room only\n\nsinahotels.com\u200b\n\nBest for bling: Palazzina\n\nThe closest Venice gets to a W hotel are these Philippe Starck-designed digs in a 16th-century little palazzo (\u201cpalazzino\u201d) next to art gallery Palazzo Grassi. Formerly known as Palazzina G, the 26 rooms are full of signature Starck touches: mirrored walls, ceilings and chairs, carnival masks and stools that look like silver-coated tree-stumps.\n\nTwo buildings spliced together make up the hotel: one set back from the water, whose rooms overlook the alleys below, the other an elegant, slim palazzo on the Grand Canal, squished between behemoths on either side. This one is where the suites are \u2013 and they\u2019re actually some of the best-priced Grand Canal suites you\u2019ll find, as former guest Johnny Depp can tell you.\n\nThere\u2019s no check-in desk here \u2013 it\u2019s way too cool for that \u2013 but there is a \u201cKrug Lounge\u201d (the second in the world) and a beautiful main room \u2013 low-lit and framed by Corinthian columns \u2013 which serves as a restaurant, bar and lobby area.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac279, B&B. Grand Canal suites from \u20ac744, B&B\n\npalazzinag.com\n\nBest for couples: Palazzo Stern\n\nEveryone notices Palazzo Stern as the number 1 vaporetto glides up the Grand Canal and moors right beside it, at Ca\u2019 Rezzonico. Not everyone, however, realises it\u2019s a hotel, with its invisible signage and neat little garden, fringed by doric columns.\n\nWhat used to be a house \u2013 built in the 15th century and ending up in the hands of a German art collector \u2013 has been converted into a 24-room property. The bedrooms themselves won\u2019t win many design awards \u2013 they\u2019re typical old-school Italian four-star \u2013 but the house itself is a gem, with a grand lobby, staircase, and rooftop hot tub.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac175, B&B\n\npalazzostern.it\u200b\n\nBest for solo travellers: Generator\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a scene, here\u2019s where to find it, in an enormous warehouse on Giudecca converted into a \u201cposhtel\u201d by the stylish Generator group. On warm evenings, millennials spill out onto the waterfront outside, creating their own mini movida; inside are design-led dorms (think exposed brick walls and beamed ceilings) as well as five ensuite doubles, overlooking the water and San Marco in the distance.\n\nDorms from \u20ac14, doubles from \u20ac60, room only\n\ngeneratorhostels.com\u200b\n\nBest for ease: Hotel Santa Chiara\n\nStaying by the bus depot isn\u2019t generally the best plan. But in Venice \u2013 especially if you\u2019re on a tight schedule, or have lots of luggage \u2013 things are a little different. The Santa Chiara sits at the mouth of the Grand Canal \u2013 not its most beautiful point, but a mere 20m from the airport bus stop. That means instead of sitting on the Alilaguna ferry to reach town (perhaps the most spectacular airport commute, but normally around 90 minutes) and then dragging your cases across bridges and around alleyways, you can get the bus from the airport to the Piazzale Roma terminus and go from Arrivals hall to your room in 25 minutes flat. Sans luggage, you can then walk to anywhere in Venice in about 15 minutes, rather than having to brave another long vaporetto ride. It is, it\u2019s no exaggeration to say, revelatory.\n\nThe hotel is split across two buildings \u2013 a 19th-century convent and a concrete-ish modern building (adventurous or excrescence, depending on your sensibilities), which are joined in the middle so you don\u2019t feel the split. Deluxe rooms are the ones to go for (classic rooms are in a separate annexe) \u2013 they\u2019re modern and well equipped, with stylish feature wallpaper, comfy beds and faux walnut furniture. Breakfast is taken in a sunny room plum on the Grand Canal, while rooms can either have a canal view or one of the bus terminus behind (the latter are extremely well soundproofed, so there are no worries on that score).\n\nThe hotel is also wheelchair-accessible \u2013 as is Piazzale Roma \u2013 so if you have mobility issues, it\u2019s an excellent base.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac150, B&B\n\nhotelsantachiara.it\n\nThis article was first published in July 2017", "description": "The best hotels in Venice for all budgets, from boutique retreats to grand palazzos, including Bauer Palladio, Generator and Casa Flora", "authors": ["Julia Buckley"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/10/30/14/casaflora01-dsc8642valentinasommariva.jpg", "published_at": "2018-11-28"}
