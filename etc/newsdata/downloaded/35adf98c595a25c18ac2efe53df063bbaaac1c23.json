Here\u2019s what you need to know about the eco-friendly fabric that has caught the attention of forward-thinking designers.\n\nWhat does hemp look like?\n\nDespite being synonymous with dust-coloured sacks, hemp is, in fact, used in more than 25,000 products globally. The fabric is comprised of long strands of fibre from within the stalk of plants such as flax, jute and stinging nettle, and bears some resemblance to a matted horse\u2019s mane before processing. The fibres are then spun together to produce a thread that can be woven into a fabric.\n\nHemp\u2019s strength and durability means clothes made from it last longer. However, this has fuelled the misconception that hemp clothing is rigid and uncomfortable. \u201cIt needs the drive of designers and makers to use hemp proudly in a fashion-forward way,\u201d says Stephanie Steele, a customer experience manager at Offset Warehouse who specialises in eco fabrics.\n\nWhy is hemp associated with hippy and cannabis subcultures?\n\nHemp\u2019s nickname as \u201cmarijuana\u2019s cousin\u201d often distracts from the fabric\u2019s many beneficial uses. \u201cA high percentage of citizens do not know the difference between industrial hemp and cannabis, and get the two mixed up frequently,\u201d Sarah Hayes, director of material development at outdoor clothing company Patagonia, told Hypebeast.\n\n\u201cCotton has become the more prevalent a crop, because of its wide availability and low price,\u201d says Steele. \u201cBecause hemp was increasingly stigmatised and gained deeper negative connotations, it stopped being grown.\u201d\n\nWhat does the law say on hemp?\n\nHemp, like marijuana, belongs to the cannabis genus of plants. This genus as a whole is classified as a controlled substance in the UK and therefore hemp is illegal to grow without a licence from the Home Office. As a result, it is rarely grown in the UK. Across the pond, however, the legalisation of industrial hemp last December is allowing US farmers to gather government subsidies to farm the crop.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hemp plants grown at a farm in M\u00e9rindol, southern France.

The plant grows without the need for harmful herbicides and pesticides and also replenishes soil quality. Hemp has low carbon emissions and is capable of capturing carbon emissions from the atmosphere, meaning it is considerably better for the environment than cotton.\n\nWhat are the pros and cons of hemp for retail?\n\nHemp has not had the industrial support of its mainstream counterparts, such as cotton, and therefore its growth as an industry has been stunted. Demand is lower than that of other fabrics and therefore it is more expensive. Steele believes this is down to a lack of understanding.\n\n\u201cAs hemp is generally only allowed to be grown in parts of the US and China currently, there isn\u2019t the awareness of where it can be obtained from, the blends available and what the fibre\u2019s qualities are,\u201d she says. \u201cWithout the supply, there isn\u2019t demand, and without the demand, there isn\u2019t supply.\u201d\n\nHemp wrinkles easily and is not always rich in colour unless it is combined with other materials. However, brands such as Levi\u2019s and Eileen Fisher have begun incorporating hemp into their collections by blending it with cotton to produce soft, wearable products that are significantly better for the environment. Paul Dillinger, Levi\u2019s head of innovation, has spoken about the brand\u2019s plans to improve the quality of its cottonised-hemp so that, in the future, its hemp garments will feel like cotton.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, recent developments in processes that allow hemp fibres to be made softer have signalled that hemp has the potential to be a frontrunner in the fabric market.\n\nWhy is there a buzz surrounding hemp now?\n\nThe legalisation of cultivation, processing, and sale of hemp in the US last December, combined with the increasing pressure on fashion brands to make their practises more eco-friendly, has resulted in more and more brands experimenting with using the fabric.\n\nIf anything can help boost interest in hemp it is legalisation from a world superpower. The US Farm bill has opened the floodgates to hemp production and the fabric\u2019s incorporation into fashion.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A model wearing a Natasha Toni\u0107 swimsuit Photograph: Publicity Image\n\nA growing number of brands are also making waves with hemp-based designs. The Los Angeles-based sustainable swimwear label Natasha Toni\u0107 made a splash at Miami Swim Week back in July when the designer debuted hemp-made designs. \u201cI think [the] world is getting a clear message that new generations and those that respect [the] health of their body and nature value hemp fabric,\u201d says Toni\u0107. \u201cThey are more than ready to jump out of polyester.\u201d\n\nWith an increasing number of fashion brands using the fabric for more than just a quick gimmick to sell \u201chippy chic\u201d, it looks as if hemp\u2019s place in La Vie Boh\u00e8me could soon become a distant memory.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Forget rigid, dust-coloured sacks \u2013 more fashion brands are incorporating \u2018marijuana\u2019s cousin\u2019 into their designs", "authors": ["Olivia Elliott"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d476c92b2908bfef06bf53807fa92be438e0f649/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0cf85be6b3a22e65d8abeb4f9c6e03b2"}
