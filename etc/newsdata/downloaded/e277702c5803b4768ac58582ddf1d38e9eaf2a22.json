A normal fellow would blush crimson if caught paying a porn actress hush money after purportedly having sex with her. He\u2019d cringe if confronted with the lascivious things he\u2019d repeatedly said about his eldest daughter. He\u2019d wear a mask to avoid being recognized if 17 women had accused him of sexual misbehavior. He would leave politics if captured on tape bragging about sexually assaulting women.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut not Trump.\n\nA normal businessman would cower in disgrace if he had been accused of housing discrimination, having mafia ties, running a sham \u201cuniversity,\u201d filing serial bankruptcies, stiffing contractors and suppliers, not to mention tax fraud or self-dealing through his personal foundation.\n\nBut not Trump.\n\nYour standard politician would be strong-armed into resigning by his own party if he did even one of the 40 things David Leonhardt accuses Trump of doing in the Monday New York Times: urging a foreign country to intervene in a U.S. election; giving classified information to Russia; denigrating U.S. intelligence while standing next to Vladimir Putin; obstructing justice; or calling for the imprisonment and investigation of his critics and opponent.\n\nBut hell no, not Trump. Not yesterday, not today, and certainly not tomorrow.\n\nIn the pre-Trump world, we depended on the forces of shame to convince public figures to surrender. But our president\u2019s ability to repel shame and disregard political mores have moved the normal touchstones. Was Ralph Northam channeling the Trumpian model when he refused to resign over his blackface scandal and survived?\n\nThe Trump magic obviously doesn\u2019t work on everybody. Press almost any Democrat and they\u2019ll say Trump deserves impeachment for his many transgressions even if they don\u2019t want to file articles against him right this minute. But for Republicans and Trump supporters (not always the same people), the president\u2019s overwhelming negatives and his repeated escapes from close calls with the law and propriety don\u2019t diminish him. Rather, they redound to his credit.\n\nLike the \u201ctrickster\u201d figure in literature, Trump uses his far-ranging skills at guile, treachery and humor to undermine the established order to get what he wants. Each time he shatters the standard rules of behavior and persists, Trump resets what\u2019s considered acceptable. This makes him a bigger villain to his foes. But he also makes him a bigger hero to his fans.\n\nAs Brian Bennett wrote in Time last spring, Trump\u2019s dexterity at squeezing out of Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s trap had the weird effect of inoculating the president from future probes. Like the brassy villain in a movie, Trump has taken everything the established rules of order could throw at him and has not just survived but thrived. If Mueller and his $32 million investigation and saturation press coverage couldn\u2019t bring Trump down, can we really expect a Trump telephone conversation with a foreign president in which he urges the investigation of his political rival\u2019s clan to break the hold he has on his supporters?\n\nWell, you say, that\u2019s not the full extent of controversy. The New York Times reports that the whistleblower\u2019s complaint refers to a series of actions by Trump, which potentially expands Trump\u2019s rap sheet. If so, the least the House of Representatives can do is commence impeachment proceedings to hobble the president with checks and balances.\n\nBut anything that doesn\u2019t kill Trump makes him stronger. Like Brer Rabbit, the trickster of African-American lore, Trump has got to be hoping House Democrats toss him in the impeachment patch. No matter how the House votes, we can\u2019t expect the Republican Senate to convict. Such an acquittal, following his \u201cvictory\u201d over Mueller, would only magnify Trump\u2019s martyrdom in the eyes of his followers. The Trump constituency has fully integrated their man\u2019s negatives into their support of him, making any loose-lip phone call he might have made to foreign leaders a de minimis matter to them.\n\nIf Democrats hope to evict Trump from the White House, they\u2019ll have to do better than bang their impeachment pots and pans outside his bedroom window. They\u2019ll have go after his positives and his 2016 campaign promises. Has he made the economy stronger, as he claims? Maybe not. The Federal Reserve Bank just dropped rates to goose an economy feared to be entering a recession. Has he made America safer? More respected? Has he brought China to heel? Built the wall? Locked up Hillary Clinton?\n\nStop thinking you can thwart Trump. You can\u2019t shame a man who won\u2019t be shamed. You can only vote him out.\n\n******\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need no rising moon/ I don\u2019t need no ball and chain / I don\u2019t need anything with you / Such a shame, shame, shame,\u201d PJ Harvey sang.
