The top 10 men and top 10 women have been invited to Nepal to run the final 42km race in Annapurna. The list includes famous names such as Spaniard Kilian Jornet, and New Zealander Ruth Croft.\n\n\u201cThis is amazing to have the GTS here in Nepal,\u201d Rai said. She was at a training camp with her sponsors, Salomon, three years ago when they asked what they wanted to envision for the future.\n\n\u201cI told them I wanted to see all athletes in Nepal, I want to see them run here. And finally, we are in Nepal to run the final,\u201d she said. \u201cThanks to all the athletes who accepted to come to Nepal. Historically, this wouldn\u2019t happen, all the grand races don\u2019t happen in Asia. But this coming Friday, it\u2019s going to happen. It\u2019s so exciting.\u201d\n\nThe day after the GTS final is the Annapurna 100km and 55km races, where participants will enjoy the spectacular views of the iconic mountain Machapuchare. Despite her excitement for the GTS, Rai is in fact running the 55km race.\n\nRai burst onto the trail scene a few years ago. She has an incredible story, coming from a poor family in a remote village, her fitness was developed when she carried water up and down a huge hill.\n\nAt 14, she joined the Maoist rebels as a child soldier. When the civil war ended, she went to Kathmandu to try and earn money for her family. She had never heard of ultra running but entered the 50km Himalayan Outdoor Festival. Unprepared, with no food, water or proper equipment she won. The organiser, Richard Bull, who also organises the Annapurna 100km, recognised her talent and helped her train and run overseas.\n\nRai is now a sponsored athlete. And she wants other women to have the same opportunities afforded to her. She set up the Mira Rai Initiative, which has a Hong Kong branch called Exchange & Empower, to get talented women running in big races, as well as teaching them English and helping with other qualifications.\n\n\u201cEveryone in Nepal, little brothers and sisters, they recognise my name,\u201d 30-years-old Rai said. \u201cThey see I\u2019ve done well and they are inspired from my work. They are now wanting to run. I\u2019m just one face who got the opportunity. There are many young strong brothers and sisters who did not get the platform.\u201d\n\nFunding is always a challenge, but with support from companies in Hong Kong, they have had runners visit for the Oxfam Trailwalker and The Green Race events, and even sent a woman to race in Japan. Rai hopes to expand to help more women. Rai and her team are hopeful that in the future they can support women from all over the globe, and not just in Nepal.\n\nRai is looking forward to this weekend\u2019s race. Her experience on the trails shows that culture is changing and women in sport is becoming the norm.\n\n\u201cEveryone, when I run they see me and they call \u2018Mira Mira!\u2019,\u201d Rai said. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing. I never thought I\u2019d be like this, I never thought I\u2019d be encouraged.\u201d\n\nYou can donate to Rai\u2019s initiative here .", "description": "The famous Nepalese runner wants others to have the same opportunities running gave her, as the Golden Trail Series Final comes to Nepal.", "authors": ["Mark Agnew"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/23/3ecb3dc8-f56e-11e9-87ad-fce8e65242a6_image_hires_171241.jpg?itok=mADlNlOR&v=1571821966", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
