Lyndsey is the one wearing a wedding dress, obviously. (Picture: Natalie Caho)\n\nThe role of flower girl in a wedding is typically given to a cute younger relative.\n\nBut in our modern times, isn\u2019t that a bit ageist? We should be celebrating our older wedding guests, surely, and appreciating a flower girl for her skills rather than her youth.\n\nAnd so we applaud bride Lyndsey Raby, who decided to do something a little different for her wedding day, choosing her four grandmas to act as flower girls.\n\nDressed in matching lacy blue dresses with coordinating jackets, Lyndsey\u2019s flower girl squad was made up of her 90-year-old great grandmother, Kathleen Brown; the groom\u2019s 70-year-old grandmother, Joyce Raby; Lyndsey\u2019s 76-year-old grandmother, Wanda Grant; and her 72-year-old grandmother, Betty Brown.\n\nThe flower girls were overjoyed to take on the role (Picture: Natalie Caho)\n\nWedding photographer Natalie Caho shared a photo of Lyndsey hanging out with her flower girls \u2013 each carrying a special bag with the words \u2018here comes the bride\u2019 on the front \u2013 on her Instagram, writing: \u2018I\u2019ve seen a lot of cute flower girls in my day, but these four gals take the cake.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYep, agreed.\n\nThe photo attracted a load of comments from people who loved the idea of getting older relatives involved in the wedding.\n\nAnd they all looked gorgeous (Picture: Natalie Caho)\n\nWe love the decked out walker (Picture: Natalie Caho)\n\nOne person wrote: \u2018Beautiful! All five of them! The backbone of humanity \u2013 mothers and grandmothers!\u2019\n\nLyndsey, who got married at Ocoee Crest in Benton, Tennessee, told HuffPost that as soon as her now-husband popped the question, she knew she wanted her grandmothers involved in the big day.\n\n\u2018I felt so blessed to have them all here so I wanted them to be involved too,\u2019 she said. \u2018I do believe they were more excited than the bridesmaids.\u2019\n\nPhotographer Natalie hopes sharing the gorgeous photos of the big day will inspire other people to stray from tradition on their wedding days.\n\nShe said: \u2018If you\u2019re on the fence about having something outside the ordinary at your wedding just do it! Especially if it means something as sweet as this did to you and your family.\u2019\n\nMORE: Couple have three foot tall Disney themed cake at their wedding\n\nMORE: Instagram influencer accused of hijacking wedding by wearing white\n\nMORE: Bride loses eight stone in a year to fit into her dream wedding dress\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "When Lyndsey Raby got engaged, she knew she wanted to have her grandmothers involved in the wedding.", "authors": ["Ellen Scott"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_90109689_1571224327.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
