REUTERS/Simon Dawson\n\nJapan, the world\u2019s third-largest economy, made the United Kingdom its favoured European destination for investment. The likes of Nissan (7201.T), Toyota (7203.T) and Honda (7267.T) were encouraged by former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to use the country as a launchpad into Europe.\n\nBrexit, though, worries Japanese investors. Many have expressed concern in private that a disorderly exit could turn upside down the entire business case for investing in British manufacturing.\n\nJapan is one of the biggest sources of foreign direct investment in Britain, which its companies have long seen as a pro-business, liberal gateway into the rest of the EU.\n\n\u201cIf those conditions drastically change and make it impossible for companies to adapt, they will have to consider very carefully how they will go about continuing business here in the UK,\u201d Japan\u2019s ambassador to London, Koji Tsuruoka, told Reuters.\n\n\u201cThey like it here and they are happy being here,\u201d Tsuruoka said. \u201cThe only hope that they are now wishing is that they will be allowed to continue to do good business here in the UK.\u201d\n\nJapanese companies have invested over 81 billion pounds in Britain, making its FDI the fifth-largest after the United States, Germany, France and the Netherlands, according to UK statistics.\n\nMore than three years of political squabbling over Brexit have left allies and investors puzzled by a country that for decades seemed a confident pillar of Western economic and political stability.\n\nIt is still unclear on what terms the United Kingdom will leave the European Union. Options range from a last-minute exit deal or delay to an acrimonious split that would knot up the networks of trade.\n\n\u201cNOT TOO MANY ANSWERS\u201d\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has repeatedly said he wants to strike a deal at an Oct. 17-18 EU summit, but if the EU turns down British demands he will lead the United Kingdom out without a deal on Oct. 31.\n\nWithout a deal, Britain would quit the EU\u2019s 500 million-strong single market and customs union overnight, falling back on World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean many import and export tariffs. There would be no transition.\n\nTsuruoka said he was hoping for an orderly exit. Nearly 1,000 Japanese companies based in Britain employ more than 150,000 people.\n\n\u201cThe UK has provided Japanese companies and investors with very important business opportunities, which they have profited from now for three or four decades,\u201d Tsuruoka said.\n\n\u201cThe question really is whether this will drastically changed or will there be a continuity of the sound business environments they have enjoyed,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are not too many answers that are available today and therefore they are watching very carefully.\u201d\n\nCar makers, the country\u2019s biggest exporter of goods, has been one of the most vocal opponents of a no-deal Brexit, warning that production would be hit with tariffs, border delays and new bureaucracy, ruining the viability of many plants.\n\nOf the just over 1.5 million cars produced in Britain last year, Japanese auto makers Nissan, Toyota and Honda built about half.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\n\u201cThe Japanese companies that are investing are global operators and they are watching it very carefully,\u201d Tsuruoka said. \u201cIf none of the predictability is there, then you cannot plan, so you will have to stop and then consider when things are clear.\u201d\n\nBritish trade minister Liz Truss is currently on a visit to Tokyo and has called for a new post-Brexit trade agreement with Japan as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cI am in Tokyo today to deliver one very clear message: the UK is ready to trade,\u201d Truss said. \u201cThe UK is an open, welcoming country and we are the perfect place to do business.\u201d", "description": "Japanese companies and investors would be forced to reassess their four-decade bet on the United Kingdom if there is a disorderly exit from the European Union that shattered supply chains and cut off access to the bloc, Japan's ambassador said.", "authors": ["Guy Faulconbridge", "Costas Pitas", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1432024117&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J1GA", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
