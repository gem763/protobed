Photo: Courtesy of the vendor\n\nThis pigment powder, which you brush into your roots to conceal unwanted regrowth, or to fill in sparse areas, has legions of fans \u2014 among them, the Cut\u2019s editor Stella Bugbee and our beauty writer Rio Viera-Newton\u2019s equally beauty-obsessed mother. Says Rio of the stuff: \u201cMy mom\u2019s experience with the Color Wow was major. Within seconds, her bright-gray roots were completely and totally concealed, with no evidence that they ever existed. And, even better, she said it didn\u2019t feel like there was anything in her hair, the way pigmented sprays can get dry and crusty. My mom put it on in the morning and it lasted all day long, so as a test, I asked her to sleep in it. In the morning, the product still hadn\u2019t budged. At all. There were no marks on her pillow, either.\u201d If you tend to get lazy between colorist appointments, now is your moment: It\u2019s a little more than half off right now, as part of Ulta\u2019s Gorgeous Hair Event.\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
