She's had more bumps than me. ... Receiving the donation, it takes more time, it's harder,\" he explained, noting that she\u2019s \u201cdoing great.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nColleen suffers from a degenerative liver disease, according to Fox News.\n\nHe also shared a funny story about when he attended Fox News\u2019s Pete Hegseth\u2019s wedding with some of his colleagues.\n\nHis wife was worried about him hugging people because of the incision in his chest, but hugging was the least of his concerns when he saw Sean Hannity.\n\n\"He punched me, but he did not hit my incision. I'm fine, I lived. ... I was Hannit-ized!\" he said jokingly.\n\nOn a more serious note, Henry addressed the first responders in the audience.\n\n\"I did that for my sister, who I love,\" Henry said. \"That's easy, I think. What you do every single day, helping people who you may not even know. The amount of people who rushed into those buildings on 9/11, Stephen Siller and everyone else - they didn't know people who they wanted to save.\"\n\nPresident Trump must've been tuned in to the program this morning, as he tweeted his congratulations to both Henry and his sister.", "description": ".09/06/2019 22:11:06PM EST.", "authors": ["Leah Barkoukis", "Matt Vespa", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2016/125/416268ba-bb8e-48ee-9c48-2499441e40bd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
