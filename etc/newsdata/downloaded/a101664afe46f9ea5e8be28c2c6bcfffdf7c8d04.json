John Lewis by day \u2014 and an award-winning graphic novelist by night", "language": "en", "text": "Crafting the series was a new frontier for both men, neither of whom had written a comic book before. And yet the three volumes \u2014 collectively titled \u201cMarch\u201d and published between 2013 and 2016 \u2014 proved wildly successful. They earned the two authors, plus illustrator Nate Powell, an Eisner Award \u2014 considered the Pulitzer Prize of the comic book world \u2014 as well as a National Book Award. The trilogy is now required reading in schools across the country, and the writing duo is working on a forthcoming sequel series about Lewis\u2019s 1986 run for Congress.\n\nAydin, 36, still seems a little shellshocked when he talks about the enormous and unexpected success of \u201cMarch.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s in so many schools now, but it was written by a kid who had no idea what he was doing,\u201d he told me recently as we walked around Lewis\u2019s office on Capitol Hill. He recalled going to comic book conventions just to buy copies of other writers\u2019 scripts, and imitating their formatting for his own fledgling drafts.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe \u201cMarch\u201d books presented challenges for Powell, a celebrated graphic novelist in his own right. \u201cInstead of making the words bend to my work, I needed to have my visual storytelling accommodate Congressman Lewis\u2019s voice as is,\u201d he recalls. (Powell \u2014 who two years ago authored a piece for a special issue of The Washington Post Magazine \u2014 is involved in the new series, called \u201cRun,\u201d but it will also be illustrated by Afua Richardson, who earned an Eisner for her work on \u201cBlack Panther: World of Wakanda.\u201d)\n\nWriting a graphic memoir isn\u2019t something that most lawmakers and their aides do together, but Aydin and Lewis have a unique relationship for the Hill. Aydin says Lewis is like a father to him, a weighty statement for the son of a single mother who died not too long ago. \u201cI hear his voice in my head all the time,\u201d Aydin says. \u201cIt\u2019s like having your dad in your brain.\u201d\n\nAydin likened the writing process for \u201cMarch\u201d and \u201cRun\u201d to speechwriting, in that he tries to mimic the congressman\u2019s speech patterns and his penchant for weighted silences. \u201cHe is very economical with his use of words,\u201d Aydin said of his boss. \u201cThat negative space where you choose not to put words can say as much, if not more.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile they were writing \u201cMarch,\u201d they would spend hours on the phone combing through Lewis\u2019s memories of sit-ins at whites-only lunch counters and the Bloody Sunday attacks during the 1965 Selma-to-Montgomery march. Occasionally they\u2019d even fall asleep while still on the phone. \u201cIt reminded me of when sometimes Martin Luther King Jr. would call me late at night and he would fall asleep, and then I would fall asleep,\u201d Lewis told me. \u201cWe\u2019d talk and talk.\u201d\n\nBoth men drew inspiration for the project from the 1957 \u201cMontgomery Story\u201d comic book that Lewis read as a teen. (It sold for 10 cents a copy.) They also looked to successful graphic memoirs like Alison Bechdel\u2019s \u201cFun Home\u201d and Art Spiegelman\u2019s \u201cMaus.\u201d\n\nEvan Narcisse, a journalist and co-author of Marvel\u2019s \u201cRise of the Black Panther\u201d series, places \u201cMarch\u201d alongside the \u201cMontgomery Story\u201d as a touchstone in the genre\u2019s long history of presenting sociopolitical issues in digestible ways. In both subject matter and authorship, \u201cMarch,\u201d he says, is \u201ca story where people from black and white backgrounds come together to achieve something.\u201d\n\nAydin still works in Lewis's D.C. office, but he does his best writing at the farm outside Asheville, N.C., that he inherited from his mother. There, he alternates between mowing the lawn and writing \u2014 the mindlessness of operating a push mower helps him come up with creative ways to transition out of difficult scenes.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThese days, Washington does not seem to hold much peace for Aydin. The amount of time he\u2019s spent on developing and promoting \u201cMarch\u201d has put a strain on his relationship with his colleagues. Even in casual conversation he has a habit of jumping to defend his credentials and his role as a co-writer, even if no one is questioning them. He has the build of a jock from his daily pre-work runs, but the air of someone who did academic quiz bowls as an extracurricular in high school. He\u2019s the nerd who made it.\n\nHis success has also led to something of a midcareer crisis. He\u2019s far from his mail-opening days \u2014 his current title is digital director and policy adviser, and he\u2019s tasked with developing tech and business policy initiatives as well as managing social media strategy \u2014 but his 13-year tenure with the same congressional office is something of an oddity on the Hill. He assumes that getting a job with another office would be difficult because of the success of \u201cMarch.\u201d Whether or not that\u2019s true, politicians do typically want their staff focused on internal issues, not outside creative projects.\n\n\u201cI still have ambition,\u201d Aydin says. \u201cI still want to reach the next level, but I don\u2019t quite know what my future looks like.\u201d He says he\u2019s been seriously considering moving to Georgia and running for political office himself.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRegardless of what his future holds, he\u2019s already hard at work on the new series. The first of the new books will follow the contentious 1986 congressional campaign in which Lewis ran against and ultimately beat his close friend and fellow civil rights leader Julian Bond. Aydin says they are aiming for a fall 2020 publication.\n\nFor Lewis, the new series is a chance to take a trip back in time. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s good to have the capacity to relive part of your life, when you were much younger and you had friends and comrades that were part of the same effort,\u201d Lewis says. \u201cAnd we\u2019re happy to inspire another generation.\u201d For Aydin, it\u2019s a chance to reach a new audience, to tell another story, to be, in his own way, a comic book hero like the ones he grew up reading about. \u201cI\u2019m trying to keep my energy level up,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of superhuman.\u201d\n\nMikaela Lefrak is the arts and culture reporter for WAMU-FM (88.5).\n\nAD", "description": "Andrew Aydin and his boss are working on a sequel to \u201cMarch.\u201d", "authors": ["Mikaela Lefrak"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/P8S9IWo3dUpI9B4O-uuwnW1cv_k=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/72EKRRHJGYI6TEYGI7FQGJH5IQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
