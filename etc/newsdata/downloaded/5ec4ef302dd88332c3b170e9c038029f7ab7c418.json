General Assembly this month in New York.\n\nBut tensions roiling the Persian Gulf have escalated following a weekend attack on major oil sites in Saudi Arabia that the U.S. alleged Iran was responsible for \u2014 a charge Iran denies.\n\nThe crisis between Washington and Tehran stems from Trump\u2019s pullout last year from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers. He also re-imposed and escalated sanctions on Iran that sent the country\u2019s economy into freefall.\n\nThe attack on Saudi Arabia, which set ablaze a crucial Saudi oil processing plant and a key oil field, was claimed by Yemen\u2019s Iranian-allied Houthi rebels, who are at war with a Saudi-led coalition that is trying to restore Yemen\u2019s internationally recognized government to power.\n\nTrump declared Monday it \u201clooks\u201d like Iran was behind the explosive attack on the Saudi oil facilities. But he stressed that military retaliation was not yet on the table in response to the strike against a key U.S. Mideast ally.\n\nOil prices soared worldwide amid the damage in Saudi Arabia and fresh Middle East war concerns. But Trump put the brakes on any talk of quick military action \u2014 earlier he had said the U.S. was \u201clocked and loaded\u201d \u2014 and he said the oil impact would not be significant on the U.S., which is a net energy exporter.\n\nThe Saudi government called the attack an \u201cunprecedented act of aggression and sabotage\u201d but stopped short of directly pinning blame on Iran.\n\nOne U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said the U.S. was considering dispatching additional military resources to the Gulf but that no decisions had been made. The U.S. already has the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier battle group in the area, as well as fighter jets, bombers, reconnaissance aircraft and air defenses.\n\nTrump, alternating between aggressive and nonviolent reactions, said the U.S. could respond \u201cwith an attack many, many times larger\u201d but also \u201cI\u2019m not looking at options right now.\u201d\n\nAmerican officials released satellite images of the damage at the heart of the kingdom\u2019s Abqaiq processing plant and a key oil field, and two U.S. officials said the attackers used multiple cruise missiles and drone aircraft.\n\nPrivate experts said the satellite images show the attackers had detailed knowledge of which tanks and machinery to hit within the sprawling Saudi oil processing facility at Abqaiq to cripple production. But \u201csatellite imagery can\u2019t show you where the attack originated from,\u201d said Joe Bermudez, an expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who examined the images.\n\nThe U.S. alleges the pattern of destruction suggested Saturday\u2019s attack did not come from neighboring Yemen, as claimed by the Houthis there. A Saudi military alleged \u201cIranian weapons\u201d had been used.\n\nThe Saudis invited the U.N. and other international experts to help investigate, suggesting there was no rush to retaliate.\n\nFor his part, Khamenei on Tuesday also reiterated Iran\u2019s stance that if the U.S. returns to the nuclear deal, Tehran would consider negotiations.\n\n\u201cOtherwise, no talks will happen ... with the Americans,\u201d he said. \u201cNeither in New York nor anywhere\u201d else.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Robert Burns in Washington contributed to this report.", "description": "Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's comments follow reports about a possible meeting between President Donald Trump and his Iranian counterpart, Hassan Rouhani.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d80bb943b00002b88d552e6.jpeg?cache=z9l8iq8mf9&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
