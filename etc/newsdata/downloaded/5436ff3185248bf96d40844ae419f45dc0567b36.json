So in his honor, the pastor\u2019s wife got the standing-room-only crowd moving in a round of beat-ya-feet, a homegrown hip-hop dance out of the District.\n\nMourners shuffled, crisscrossed and slid through the church in a joyful remembrance of the 34-year-old from Southeast, who had been gunned down just weeks before in the U Street nightlife hub in the District.\n\nAs services let out, a crowd lingered while Byrd\u2019s family prepared to go to the cemetery for his burial.\n\nThen, gunfire struck again.\n\nOne car of funeral-goers started shooting at another mere blocks away in a townhouse community near the church in Suitland, Md., leaving 24-year-old Mshairi Alkebular dead.\n\n\n\nTavone Hoes, 26, of Southeast Washington (Prince George\u2019s County Police)\n\nByrd\u2019s aunt Cassandra Riddick said her family is pained to see someone who attended her nephew\u2019s funeral tragically gunned down. And although the shooting involved those who attended services, the incident had nothing to do with her nephew\u2019s death, said Riddick, who is speaking out because she doesn\u2019t want her nephew to be remembered for the violence spurred by others.\n\n\u201cIt had nothing to do with us,\u201d said Riddick, adding that Byrd\u2019s family knew nothing of the shooting until after the burial. \u201cNo one came to avenge my nephew\u2019s death. Unfortunately, that young man lost his life.\u201d\n\nPrince George\u2019s County police arrested two men in Alkebular\u2019s slaying and said the shooting was part of an ongoing clash between two groups from the District.\n\n\u201cEric had nothing to do with this and Eric\u2019s memory should not be marred by the actions of those outside the funeral,\u201d Prince George\u2019s County police spokeswoman Jennifer Donelan said. \u201cEric, from what we understand, got along with everyone and that\u2019s why you saw so many people from different groups at his funeral. Unfortunately there were two groups feuding for a while from Washington, D.C.\u201d\n\n[Man wounded in shooting after a funeral has died]\n\n\n\nGregory Sam, 25, of Southeast Washington (Prince George\u2019s County Police)\n\nByrd, whose case still is being investigated by D.C. police, was shot outside U Street Music Hall before 3 a.m. on July 20. About two weeks later, on Aug. 5, friends and family gathered in Suitland, Md., for his funeral.\n\nAs services wrapped up at around 1 p.m., a clash occurred in the parking lot that soon after sparked the shooting, Donelan said.\n\nBlocks away from the church, Alkebular was driving a blue Toyota Corolla that was being tailed by a Dodge Charger, according to charging documents. Someone on the passenger side of the Charger stuck out a hand pointing a gun at the Corolla, police said.\n\nSurveillance video shows the Charger making \u201cmultiple intentional vehicle maneuvers as if actively attempting to locate something or someone\u201d before following Alkebular to a townhouse community on Suitland Road.\n\nThe Charger then pulled alongside the Corolla in a position that would allow the passenger to \u201cshoot from the right passenger side\u201d before \u201cthe passenger began firing in the vehicle,\u201d charging documents said.\n\nPassengers in the Corolla returned fire, police said\n\nXavier Justice, a member of the Deliverance Headquarters for All People, where Byrd\u2019s service was held, said Byrd interacted with different communities that had unresolved conflicts.\n\n\u201cThis situation is a part of a larger, more complex issue that requires bravery and resolve,\u201d Justice said. \u201cWe have to confront the issues that cause communities to remain divided and individuals to become easily triggered and dysregulated so as to resort to gun violence before attempting diplomacy, compromise and healthy dispute resolution.\u201d\n\nAlkebular was hit several times before the Charger took off, police said.\n\nLess than 10 minutes after police were called to the shooting scene, Tavone Hoes arrived at a hospital with a gunshot wound to his right wrist. Hoes said he was the passenger in a Dodge Charger in a funeral procession for \u201cBoom\u201d when he was shot, according to court documents.\n\n\u201cMr. Hoes stated he was shot in his wrist due to the fact that he had his hand out the window of the Charger but denies having a gun,\u201d according to charging documents.\n\nHoes, 26, was arrested and charged with murder, along with Gregory Sam, 25, who police say was driving the Charger.\n\nHoes is in custody in the District and is awaiting extradition to Prince George\u2019s County, according to police and online court records. Sam is being held in the Prince George\u2019s County detention center.\n\nAn attorney for Hoes did not respond to a request for comment. Thomas C. Mooney, an attorney for Sam, declined to comment beyond saying his client intends to plead not guilty.\n\nAlkebular\u2019s family declined to comment.\n\n[Two arrests in slaying that followed funeral, Prince George\u2019s police say]\n\nAlkebular\u2019s mother is a family friend who has been in touch with Byrd\u2019s father, Riddick said.\n\n\u201cMy brother is very disappointed in what happened,\u201d Riddick said. \u201cI\u2019m very sorry for this young man\u2019s passing.\u201d\n\nRiddick said she is glad an arrest was made in the shooting that took place after the funeral and hopes her nephew\u2019s homicide will be similarly resolved.\n\nByrd wanted to be a rapper and had made plans to perform at an arts festival before he was slain, Riddick said.\n\n\u201cMy nephew was not a perfect young man, but he was a very nice young man,\u201d Riddick said. \u201cThat is what I want people to remember. Whatever transpired that night he was killed, that is not how we were raised to grow up.\u201d\n\nLike Justice, Riddick decried the gun violence that took the lives of her nephew and Alkebular.\n\n\u201cThere are too many guns, period,\u201d Riddick said. \u201cI\u2019m from the old school where we handle conflict and we got back and then we were friends. We just need to do better. We can\u2019t have babies dying for no reason.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nInnocent man spent months in jail for bringing honey back to United States\n\nBalloons and bloodstains: Police still investigating shooting at toddler\u2019s birthday party that left seven wounded\n\nA child touched an electrified railing at MGM National Harbor resort, and lives changed\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Eric Byrd got along with everyone, but not everyone he knew got along with each other, police and family said.", "authors": ["Lynh Bui", "Reporter Focusing On Public Safety", "Criminal Justice", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/iQzIYXbqj1pyq0MDJhl0EL1oxrY=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WFAFG5S7WMI6TPZE3NFZ7NRKUI.jpg"}
