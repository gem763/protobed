But for the love of God, please do not dress up as Sonic The Hedgehog, I am begging you.\n\nEver since they released the artwork for the upcoming Sonic film, it has been a running joke because the official artwork looked awful. A fan even went viral for swapping out the artwork for his own re-imagined version.\n\nThe backlash was so bad that the director has actually postponed the film\u2019s release until they can make our beloved Sonic look a little less, well, fucked up.\n\nBut clearly Halloween costume manufacturers didn\u2019t get the message, because these costumes are somehow even worse. And obviously, Twitter was quick to point out the most terrifying costumes.\n\nFirst up we\u2019ve got this rubber-looking mask that is absolutely going to give me nightmares for the rest of my life. I\u2019ve never suffered from sleep paralysis, but I\u2019m pretty certain this is what the demon looks like.\n\nMan between SONIC and CATS costumes this Halloween the streets are going to run red with blood and fear pic.twitter.com/czNrWuVOej \u2014 Giallo Soda Pop (@TreyHilburn) October 11, 2019\n\nBut then Walmart took it to a whole new level with a full-body costume that resembles the pre-redesign Sonic.\n\nAnd in what I can only assume is a \u2018Worst Sonic Costume\u2019 competition, US costume store Party City also debuted their own version of the god-awful creation.\n\nI guess these costumes really take the \u201cscary\u201d part of the holiday to a whole new level. If anyone arrives at my house in a Sonic costume, I will boycott the entire holiday.\n\nDear god, the Sonic movie Halloween costumes are horrifying pic.twitter.com/uFYHBcZo5L \u2014 Frying Pansexual (@Nerd_Shark69) October 10, 2019\n\nHonestly, at this point let\u2019s just throw it all in the bin. Halloween? Cancelled. Sonic movie? Cancelled. Life? Cancelled.\n\nThere are so many costume possibilities for Halloween this year. Dress up as literally anything else. Mario and Luigi, Area 51 aliens, Stranger Things, the possibilities are endless.\n\nSo please, I\u2019m begging you, do not wear a creepy Sonic costume on October 31st.\n\nREAD MORE Sonic Movie Delayed To 2020 So They Can Make Him Look Less Nightmarish", "description": "The 'Sonic The Hedgehog' Halloween costumes are here, and the internet is ready to rip them apart and cancel the whole holiday.", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/sonic.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
