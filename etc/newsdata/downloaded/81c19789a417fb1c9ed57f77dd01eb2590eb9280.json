REUTERS/Youssef Boudlal\n\nDozens of activists staged a sit-in outside the Rabat court before the first hearing in her trial, chanting: \u201cWhat a shame freedoms are in danger, what a shame journalism is in danger\u201d.\n\nPolice detained 28-year-old Hajar Raissouni 10 days ago along with her fiance, a doctor, a nurse and another person accused of involvement. Their lawyers deny she had an abortion.\n\nThe activists say the charges against her are part of a crackdown on reporters critical of the government and are also intended to embarrass her uncle, a prominent Islamist leader who has opposed abortion and extramarital sex.\n\nThe case has prompted widespread debate on social media in Morocco, a mostly Muslim country, over personal freedoms including sex and privacy, after details of her case were leaked to newspapers.\n\nIt has also shone a new light on Morocco\u2019s ban on abortion weeks before parliament is due to consider amendments to allow it in cases of rape, incest or malformation of the foetus.\n\nMorocco\u2019s public prosecutor said in a statement that Raissouni\u2019s arrest was a legal matter and not connected to her job as a journalist.\n\nShe was arrested after a visit to the office of a doctor who was under police surveillance for illegal abortions, the prosecutor said.\n\nRaissouni works for the independent newspaper Akhbar al-Youm. Her uncle, Ahmed Raissouni, is a former leader of the Movement for Unity and Reform, a leading Islamist group with ties to the Justice and Development party (PJD) that leads Morocco\u2019s governing coalition.\n\nAnother uncle, Soulaiman Raissouni, who is editor in chief of Akhbar al-Youm, said she had been singled out and accused the government of \u201cscore-settling with a newspaper that disturbs it, and with a family that has never bowed\u201d.\n\nA journalist at Akhbar al-Youm, Khaoula Ajaafri, said the penal code was \u201cbeing used to crack down on critical journalists\u201d. The newspaper\u2019s manager was recently sentenced to 12 years in prison for rape and human trafficking, which he denied.\n\nThe Moroccan Association for Abortion Rights, an activist group, said 600 to 800 abortions take place illegally each day. In 2018, 41 cases were brought over illegal abortions, according to a report released by the prosecutor\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cHajar\u2019s case shows that our laws are archaic and incompatible with the transformations that have taken place in our society for decades,\u201d said human rights activist Ahmed Assid.", "description": "Moroccan rights activists on Monday demanded the release of a journalist facing trial on charges of abortion and sex outside marriage, saying her arrest was politically motivated.", "authors": ["Ahmed Eljechtimi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428236311&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF890HA-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
