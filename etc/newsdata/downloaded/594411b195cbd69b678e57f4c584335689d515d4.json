Conventional wisdom is that enacting various gun control laws, including banning assault weapons, is the solution to school shootings.\n\nBut as Andrew Pollack, the father of one of the Parkland victims, and Max Eden, an education policy expert, explain in their new book \u201cWhy Meadow Died: The People and Policies that Created the Parkland Shooter and Endanger America\u2019s Students,\u201d the story is far more complicated than that.\n\nAs the book\u2019s title suggests, government policy bears significant blame for the Parkland tragedy.\n\nThe shooter, Nikolas Cruz, showed serious signs of violent and erratic behavior for years. He mutilated animals, brought bullets to school, made death threats and attempted suicide. And everyone \u2014 local and federal law enforcement, school staff, teachers, students and his family \u2014 knew it.\n\nPolice officers were called to his house 45 times before the tragedy. His mother\u2019s friend called the sheriff\u2019s office, telling them \u201cthis might be Columbine in the making\u201d \u2014 but they never called her back. Multiple students reported Cruz to school leaders. And the school security staff even had a meeting where they agreed that if anyone would become a school shooter, it would be Cruz.\n\nIf everyone knew something was wrong, how did he slip through the cracks?\n\nAs Mr. Pollack and Mr. Eden write, \u201cEvery institution around Cruz, especially the school system, failed.\u201d\n\nOn their own, each government failure was arguably a rational response to the incentives created by well-intentioned but flawed government policies. For example, Broward school district\u2019s PROMISE program had a well-meaning goal: Lower petty arrests in schools to prevent students from getting criminal records that would hurt them in life.\n\nSchool officials knew Cruz got into a fight at school, vandalized school property and made death threats, yet he was never arrested.\n\nDistrict policy also required schools to send students to the juvenile justice system if they skipped the PROMISE program. Cruz was referred to the PROMISE program, but he did not attend nor was he sent to the juvenile justice system. If Cruz had earned a criminal record for any of these acts, local police and the FBI might have taken reports of his subsequent death threats more seriously. And if Cruz had felonies on his record, he would not have been able to legally purchase a gun.\n\nBut that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nGuidance from the federal government also had an honorable goal of preventing discriminatory discipline and reducing the number of suspensions and expulsions. A federal Dear Colleague Letter pressured schools to avoid disproportionately punishing students from different groups, including minority students and those with disabilities.\n\nHowever, for \u201cemotional and behavioral disabilities,\u201d the guidance essentially pressured schools \u201cto discipline students who behave badly at the same rate as students who behave well, which creates predictably perverse incentives and consequences,\u201d Mr. Pollack and Mr. Eden write.\n\nSimilarly, the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act\u2019s pressure to place students in the \u201cleast restrictive environment\u201d might have inadvertently contributed to the school\u2019s principal at Cruz\u2019s alternative school deciding to put Cruz back into the regular high school, where support staff knew he didn\u2019t belong. Likewise, the Youth Emergency Services group evaluated Cruz three times but decided he didn\u2019t need to be institutionalized.\n\nThen on the day of the shooting, there were several publicized government failures. A school security officer saw Cruz enter the campus with a rifle bag and heard shots, but never called Code Red because he claimed he didn\u2019t want to \u201cget the cops out there for nothing.\u201d Eight Broward sheriff\u2019s deputies heard shots but none of them went in the building to face the shooter, perhaps because the policy had recently changed from saying deputies \u201cshall\u201d enter a building to address a shooter to saying that they \u201cmay.\u201d\n\nLaw enforcement failed. In other instances, well-intentioned school and government employees were just doing their jobs but the government\u2019s top-down incentives and lack of accountability increased the chances of this tragedy. It is possible that Cruz would have killed 17 people, including Mr. Pollack\u2019s daughter, Meadow, even without these failures and perverse incentives in place. But it would be irresponsible not to consider that even the most well-intentioned government policies often come with unintended and, in this case, fatal consequences.\n\n\u2022 Corey A.
