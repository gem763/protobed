The following month, Ms Mogdyn said, doctors \u201ccut my foetus out\u201d without using anaesthesia. She still suffers from complications.\n\n\u201cTwo humans were lost in this tragedy \u2013 my baby and me,\u201d Ms Mogdyn said during an interview on the outskirts of Almaty, Kazakhstan\u2019s largest city.\n\nShe received her Kazakh citizenship in July and says that has emboldened her to speak out. She is also pressing Beijing for a response: either financial compensation or, at least, an apology.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

A Kazakh woman with close relatives remaining in China was forced to undergo two abortions, in 2016 and 2017, while living in Xinjiang, her lawyer said.\n\nAiman Umarova, a Kazakh human rights advocate and US State Department honouree, said her client is seeking refuge in a Kazakh city and does not wish to be identified for fear of retribution.\n\nMs Umarova sees the women\u2019s stories as forming a pattern.\n\n\u201cSexually violating women, including stopping them from reproducing, has become a weapon for China against its Muslim population,\u201d she said.\n\nThe US government and human rights groups estimate that between one million and three million Muslims have been detained in Chinese \u201cre-education camps\u201d since 2017, most of them Uighurs.\n\nThe Washington Post spoke with two men, including an Australian citizen named Almas Nizamidin, who suspect that their wives, both Uighurs still in detention in Xinjiang, were forced to terminate their pregnancies at a camp in 2017.\n\nUnder China\u2019s one-child policy, abortions and contraceptives were encouraged \u2013 and often enforced \u2013 by officials tasked with keeping the population down. Exceptions were granted for ethnic minorities, who were allowed one more child than Han Chinese.\n\nThe policy was abandoned three years ago, but that has not prevented the recent move to curb ethnic populations, said Leta Hong Fincher, a scholar and expert on gender equality in China. \u201cThere is a clear tightening of control over the reproductive rights of ethnic minorities,\u201d she said.\n\nIn addition to mistreating detained women, rights groups and experts say, Beijing has pursued a campaign to erase Muslim culture in Xinjiang, by pushing interethnic marriages and sending Chinese officials for \u201chome stays\u201d with Muslim families, part of efforts by president Xi Jinping\u2019s government to assimilate ethnic minorities.\n\nAll of this amounts to genocide as laid out by the UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, said Rushan Abbas, founder and executive director of the Washington-based Campaign for Uyghurs.\n\n\u201cAnd as with so much in Chinese culture, women are being targeted, as they are viewed as less valuable,\u201d said Ms Abbas, who said her sister was abducted in Xinjiang a year ago and has not been heard from since.\n\nSome allegations extend further back. After the Urumqi riots in 2009, which analysts say triggered the harsh security measures now in place across Xinjiang, Islamic studies student Ruqiye Perhat was held in various prisons for four years.\n\nThere, the Uighur woman says, she was repeatedly raped by Han Chinese guards, resulting in two pregnancies.\n\n\u201cAny woman or man under age 35 was raped and sexually abused,\u201d she said through an interpreter from Turkey, where she now lives. Both pregnancies were forcibly aborted while she was in prison, said Ms Perhat, who is now 30.\n\nSeveral female former detainees said they suspect that when younger and unmarried women were taken from their packed cells at night \u2013 to be returned the next morning or not at all \u2013 they were raped by guards.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019d come in and put bags on the heads of the ones they wanted,\u201d said Gulzira Auelkhan, a 40-year-old woman in the Kazakh village of Akshi who spent 18 months in the camps.\n\nIn May, an open letter written by a former guard at a Xinjiang camp appeared to support the women\u2019s claims. His account, which was posted by activists, has not been independently verified.\n\nThe ethnic Kazakh man, called Berik, said Chinese officers would watch women in their cells through a monitor before selecting one to take out. \u201cThere are two tables in the kitchen, one for snacks and liquor, and the other for \u2018doing things\u2019,\u201d he wrote.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Kazakhstan allowed her to resettle in Sweden in June.\n\nSeveral said they were forced to shower and use the toilet in groups, in rooms outfitted with cameras. Ms Auelkhan said female guards used chewing gum to pull on her pubic hair. Married women offered conjugal visits were ordered to swallow unknown pills afterward.\n\nGround chili peppers mixed with water in small glass jars were given to several women before showering. Once naked, they were ordered by female guards to smear the liquid on their genitals.\n\n\u201cIt burned like fire,\u201d one woman recalled.\n\nAsked to respond to the allegations, China\u2019s Foreign Affairs Ministry referred The Washington Post to a government paper released last month on plans to combat terrorism through education and training, including a section on \u201cprotecting trainees\u2019 basic rights\u201d.\n\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t raise such questions if you had carefully read the white paper,\u201d the ministry said in a faxed response.\n\nIn July, when the United States was in the middle of a trade war with China, secretary of state Mike Pompeo called Beijing\u2019s treatment of Uighurs \u201cthe stain of the century\u201d. But elsewhere, the response has been tepid. Even Muslim-majority countries have stood by China.\n\nKazakhstan\u2019s government has been among those hesitant to condemn the abuses attributed to its powerful eastern neighbour.\n\nThe country\u2019s stability and resources have earned it the moniker of \u201cbuckle\u201d of Mr Xi\u2019s flagship Belt and Road infrastructure initiative, and Beijing\u2019s affluent reach is visible in Kazakh cities.\n\nBut activists say Kazakhstan\u2019s reluctance to upset China could be changing given the deluge of information coming out of Xinjiang, which is home to some 1.5 million Kazakhs.\n\nFormer detainees now living in tumbledown villages dotted about the golden steppe on the Kazakh side of the border are increasingly speaking out, even those with relatives in China.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to talk about this for a long time. But if I don\u2019t, who will?\u201d said Rakhima Senbay, 32, standing in her friend\u2019s house near the town of Taldykorgan. Although still a Chinese citizen, she has called Kazakhstan home since she was released from a camp late last year.\n\nShortly after Ms Senbay, who has four children, was detained in Xinjiang in late 2017, also for having WhatsApp on her phone, a female Chinese doctor forcibly fitted her with an intrauterine contraceptive device.\n\n\u201cI told her I didn\u2019t want it, but she said it\u2019s a must for all women going to the camp,\u201d Ms Senbay said.\n\nGulzhan, a Kazakh activist who uses only her first name, said seven women have told her the same thing happened to them.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s since I started four months ago,\u201d she said. \u201cImagine how many more are out there.\u201d\n\nWashington Post", "description": "The women have found refuge from Chinese authorities across the border in Kazakhstan, their ancestral homeland.
