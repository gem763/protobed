The oft-arrested pro-democracy activist, 23, condemned the Hong Kong government for denying his supporters the right to vote for him and vowed to continue trying to become involved in government affairs.\n\nWong rose to prominence during the 2014 Umbrella Movement against Beijing when he was 18 years old. He was serving a month-long prison sentence for his role in galvanizing the public against China\u2019s increasingly blatant attempts to impose communist law on Hong Kong when the current protest movement erupted in June. He has been arrested at least twice since his release for his participation in pro-democracy protests.\n\nThe Hong Kong government delayed a decision on Wong\u2019s candidate for over a week, making his the last campaign to know if its candidate would be on the ballot and the only candidacy officials rejected. Election Affairs Commission official Dorothy Ma, initially in charge of approving or rejecting Wong\u2019s candidacy, abruptly took indefinite \u201csick leave\u201d last week, leaving Wong in limbo.\n\nHer replacement, Laura Aron, handed down her ruling against Wong on Monday \u2013 an unprecedented rejection of a district council candidate, according to local media.\n\nI become the only candidate banned from running in November\u2019s District Council Election as Returning officer, Laura ARON ruled my nomination invalid this morning. It proved how Beijing manipulate the election with political cersorship and screening. pic.twitter.com/mwZNKUApFM \u2014 Joshua Wong \u9ec3\u4e4b\u92d2 \ud83d\ude37 (@joshuawongcf) October 29, 2019\n\nAron ruled that Wong was not sufficiently clear in his rejection of independence for Hong Kong and that his organization, Demosisto, advocated for \u201cself-determination,\u201d a disqualifying political belief.\n\n\u201cIt is questionable whether Mr. Wong accepts the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s sovereignty over the HKSAR [Hong Kong Special Administrative Region] and whether he is of the view that independence and referendum would be options for Hong Kong,\u201d Wong\u2019s official rejection read, according to text provided by the Hong Kong Free Press (HKFP).\n\n\u201cAccording to the information published by Demosisto at its website, Demosisto adopts \u2018democratic self-determination\u2019 as its \u2018cardinal objective,'\u201d the ruling read. Wong, it continued, had allegedly stated that, if the people of Hong Kong were to choose independence, they had the right to demand a government of their choice.\n\n\u201cIt can be understood as suggesting that whether independence could be an option for Hong Kong people is contingent upon the public opinion in Hong Kong, which is plainly inconsistent with the BL [Basic Law],\u201d the ruling read.\n\nThe Basic Law governs Hong Kong\u2019s relationship with China. Its policy, known commonly as \u201cOne Country, Two Systems,\u201d grants China sovereignty over Hong Kong on the condition that it cannot impose communist laws on the city. Hong Kong\u2019s China-controlled government uses the Basic Law to ban candidates from running for office who support Hong Kong\u2019s separation from China.\n\nThe election commission\u2019s rejection of Wong\u2019s candidacy suggests not that Wong explicitly supports independence, but that he does not oppose it enthusiastically enough, noting that, when asked if he did, Wong quoted Chinese dictator Xi Jinping threatening Hong Kong residents not to openly support it, which the council deemed an insincere answer to the question.\n\nIn a statement on Twitter, Wong condemned the election commission for removing him from the ballot and taking orders from Beijing, a violation of \u201cOne Country, Two Systems.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe decision to ban me from running office [sic] is clearly politically-driven,\u201d Wong wrote. \u201cThe so-called \u2018reasons\u2019 is judging subjectively on my intention to uphold Basic Law. But everyone would know that the true reason is my identity, Joshua Wong, is the crime in their mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish to emphasize that, since the former RO Mrs Dorothy Ma\u2019s disappearance in [sic] last week, it had become clear that Beijing exerted extremely strong pressure on HK gov\u2019t officials who are responsible for deciding my candidacy,\u201d his statement continued. \u201cPolitical censorship is an inconvenient truth that even political neutrality is lost. I wish to apologise to my constituents if I have failed their expectation \u2014 to serve the residents as a councillor. But I affirm that, I still believe that democracy begins from the ground.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the future, I\u2019m not giving up my advocacy just because Beijing doesn\u2019t like me to do so. I\u2019m grateful to my teammate, Kelvin Lam, who bravely takes up this daunting task at this very moment, to run for office. I appeal to all voters in my district, to support Kelvin,\u201d he concluded.\n\nWong also appeared at a press conference with his replacement on the ballot, Kelvin Lam, and reiterated his belief that the government banned him from running for office out of fear in Beijing that he would actually win.\n\n\u201cThe returning officer has repeatedly twisted and misunderstood my political views, it shows that Beijing has given a strict order to disqualify me,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only reason for my disqualification is that my name is Joshua Wong.\u201d\n\nWong added a call to the international community to support the pro-freedom movement in Hong Kong, and in particular a call to the American Congress to pass the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act which, among other things, would protect protesters like Wong in the event that China uses their \u201ccriminal\u201d record to keep them out of America.\n\nWong testified before Congress in September urging lawmakers to pass the act.\n\n\u201cThe present state of affairs reveals Beijing\u2019s utter inability to understand, let alone govern, a free society,\u201d he told Congress. \u201cThe stakes have never been higher.\u201d\n\nThe HKFP noted that, while Wong spoke, a small gang of pro-China belligerents attempted to interrupt him by chanting \u201cHan traitor! Shut up!\u201d, a reference to Wong\u2019s ethnic identity.\n\nThe Global Times, a Chinese government propaganda outlet, reported the news of his disqualification by branding him a criminal, responsible for \u201cinciting others to participate in unapproved assemblies and violently besieging police headquarters in June.\u201d The June 21 protest in question, in which protesters surrounded a police station demanding freedom for those arrested for expressing themselves freely, was largely peaceful with the exception of police attacks on protesters.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "Hong Kong election officials banned freedom activist Joshua Wong from running in a local district council election on Monday.", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/04/Taiwan-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
