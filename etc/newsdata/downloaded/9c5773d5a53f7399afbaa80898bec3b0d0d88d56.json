By contrast, the retail value of credit monitoring was an estimated $1,920, court papers noted.\n\nTuesday\u2019s filing gave a first glimpse at the number of people who agree, so far, with the attorneys and regulators like the Federal Trade Commission.\n\n\u201cWhile all class members will not file a credit monitoring claim, nearly 3 million class members already have done so,\u201d the filing said, adding the retail price of all that credit monitoring is \u201cworth nearly $6 billion.\u201d\n\nThe filing indicates the bucket of money for the cash compensation, capped at $31 million, will be used up. There\u2019s a separate bucket of money \u2014 $69 million \u2014 that will be used to compensate victims\u2019 lost time. So far, victims have filed claims for cash and lost time totalling more than $60 million, attorneys wrote.\n\nConsumers have until Jan. 22, 2020 to file claims either for free credit monitoring, the cash payment, or to cover out-of-pocket losses from the breach. More people will \u201cundoubtedly\u201d sign up for the free credit monitoring by that point, their filing said.\n\nVictims\u2019 lawyers want $77.5 million in legal fees\n\nThe data comes in the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys motion for $77.5 million in legal fees, plus reimbursement for $1.2 million in expenses.\n\nThe lawyers deserve every penny, they say, given the work they\u2019ve already poured into the case and what they\u2019ll continue to do as the consumer claims process moves on in the months and years to come.\n\nThe court papers mention lengthy negotiations with Equifax that culminated in a late-night deal on settlement terms in March. The sides then took the terms to federal regulators and attorneys general, who added their own input, tacking on more time in the deal talks, according to the court filings.\n\nMisunderstandings about the $125 offer\n\nThe filings also discuss the lawyers\u2019 work to correct the public misunderstanding about the $125 offer.\n\n\u201cThe media coverage created a widespread misperception that all consumers impacted by the data breach (and in some cases all Americans, regardless of class membership) could get alternative compensation of $125 simply by filing a claim,\u201d the motion said.\n\nIn reality, class members who wanted the cash payment had to name the credit monitoring they already used and attest that they would use it for at least six months, the attorneys said. \u201cMoreover, the settlement provides that alternative compensation claimants will receive up to $125, not a $125 guaranty,\u201d the filing said.\n\nThe filing does not appear to specify the exact number of consumers who have sought the cash compensation, but lawyers wrote that \u201cmillions of claims\u201d were filed within 48 hours of the website about the breach going live, most of which sough the cash compensation.\n\nMany of those claims for cash might be invalid because victims may not meet the requirements, attorneys wrote, but it\u2019s still likely the $31 million fund for the cash payouts could be drained and people seeking the $125 \u201cwould receive substantially less.\u201d\n\nOther settlement provisions let class members claim up to $20,000 to pay back out-of-pocket expenses and losses due to identity theft as a result of the breach, or costs to protect themselves from identity theft. It may be difficult for victims to trace harm directly to the breach, according to some observers.\n\nEquifax did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It has denied wrongdoing in the settlement and the company\u2019s CEO, Mark Begor, has previously said company officials haven\u2019t found instances of stolen data being used for identity theft, nor has it found stolen data for sale on the dark web.\n\nEquifax shares are up 44% from the start of the year. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.33% is up more than 21% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.43% is up 16% in that time.", "description": "Plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys are asking for $77.5 million in fees for the case.", "authors": ["Andrew Keshner"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HN865_equifa_ZG_20190722122123.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
