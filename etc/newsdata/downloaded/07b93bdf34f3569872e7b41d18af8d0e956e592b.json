Rick Chiarelli gave his permission to make this doctor's note, dated Oct. 22, 2019, public. In it, Chiarelli's doctor writes the councillor suffered a 'syncopal attack,' or fainting spell, on Oct. 12. Chiarelli's 'stress levels continue to be high with erratic blood sugars and blood pressure,' according to the note. CBC has withheld the name of the doctor because it's not clear whether he was aware the note would be shared publicly.

Chiarelli's ward does not have a voice. We're trying our best to do so through two members of council filling in, but as you saw today, there's precious little support for Coun. Chiarelli,\" Watson said Wednesday.\n\nMayor Watson said there is 'precious little support' for Chiarelli. (Giacomo Panico/CBC)\n\n\"I think as more allegations come forward, it becomes more disgusting and very upsetting as to what was going on in that office for what appears to be many, many months, if not years.\"\n\nUnder the Municipal Act, if Chiarelli does not show up to council by the end of the November, his seat will be declared vacant.\n\nOttawa city councillors explain why they made the decision to deny a medical leave of absence to Coun. Rick Chiarelli on Wednesday. 1:23\n\nSkeptical of medical note\n\nThe city clerk told CBC he can't remember a previous case where council denied a request for leave.\n\nCouncil members appeared unconvinced Chiarelli should be granted indefinite leave based on the details of the medical note, which states Chiarelli went to the emergency room after fainting on Oct. 12, and that his stress level remains high.\n\nChiarelli has provided the clerk with three notes: one in September, which was updated earlier this month, then again this week.", "description": "The College ward councillor, who's facing numerous allegations of inappropriate behaviour, must attend council by the end of November or his seat will be declared vacant.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4261217.1503604465!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/rick-chiarelli-councillor-ottawa.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
