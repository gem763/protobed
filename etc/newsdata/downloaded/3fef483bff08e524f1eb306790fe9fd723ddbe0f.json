On Friday, the central bank tightened its grip on rates ahead of the end of the quarter, when liquidity can become scarce, by extending its daily borrowing facilities through at least October 10, and unveiling three, 14-day term operations.\n\nThe short-term rate spike also raised concerns about the potential for the funding tumult to shake consumer confidence, at a time when financial markets often are viewed as a barometer of the economy\u2019s vitality.\n\nBruce Richards, CEO of Marathon Asset Management said the biggest risk to the U.S. economy was a weakening of consumer sentiment, in remarks Thursday at the CNBC Institutional Investor Delivering Alpha conference.\n\nRichards said that while U.S. households are doing well, it would become \u201cvery worrisome\u201d if consumer confidence starts to fade, since two-thirds of the U.S. economy is consumer-driven.\n\n\u201cRight now, it is corporate confidence\u201d that is weakening, he said.\n\nGuy LeBas, chief fixed-income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott, also sees reason to fret due to continuing Wall Street liquidity woes that could seep into the real economy.\n\nHe pointed to three factors that still leave the money-market plumbing fragile: heavy U.S. Treasury borrowing to fund the widening fiscal deficit, a flat-to-inverted yield curve, and a regulatory environment that limits the ability of banks to absorb government debt.\n\nLeBas thinks overnight funding operations alone won\u2019t be enough to keep credit flowing over the longer run.\n\nWall Street primary dealers are tasked with helping to execute financial operations for the U.S. Treasury and the Fed and LeBas cautioned that they could run out of cash around the first quarter of next year, unless the Fed makes a series of aggressive cuts to short-term rates or launches a more permanent effort to expand its balance sheet, known on Wall Street as quantitative easing or bond buying.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not here to tell the Fed what to do,\u201d LeBas said, adding that when banks run out of balance sheet it can lead to sales of assets like corporate debt or force banks to pull back from lending to businesses and individuals. That\u2019s exactly what the Fed wants to avoid because a retrenchment in lending can have the effect of amplifying economic downturns.\n\n\u201cIf the Fed does not act with rate cuts or QE, that\u2019s the most obvious way this problem affects the real economy,\u201d he said.\n\nThe overnight repurchasing rate, or the amount banks and hedge funds pay to borrow to finance their trading operations for a single day, peaked earlier in the week at three to four times their usual levels of around 2% (see chart below).\n\nCapital Economics\n\nThe spike in borrowing costs saw investors clamoring for intervention to ease strains in funding markets. Usually, that aid comes from the New York Fed, which, because of its presence in the hub of the financial capital of the U.S., is tasked with supervising the banking system and helping to ensure financial stability among the nation\u2019s largest institutions.\n\n\u201cThat ability of the system to move money around and redistribute \u2014 it didn\u2019t work the way we\u2019ve seen in the past,\u201d acknowledged New York Fed President John Williams in an interview on Friday, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\n\u201cThey walked into a situation this week where there was not enough liquidity in the system,\u201d said Robert Tipp, chief investment strategist at PGIM Fixed Income, referring to perceptions that the Fed was slow to anticipate and react to the spike in overnight borrowing costs that took hold on Monday and accelerated the following day. \u201cThey completely were out of practice on how to perform an open market operation.\u201d In fact, the Fed\u2019s first intervention in short-term markets on Tuesday was aborted and had to be restarted, stoking further worries about Wall Street\u2019s systems and process among market participants.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s missteps come at a uniquely sensitive time for domestic and global markets, and raised serious questions about whether the blowout in short-term rates represented a signal of something more ominous crystallizing in financial markets. More than a decade ago, a seizing up of short-term markets were the hallmark of a financial crisis that saw historic Wall Street institutions Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns brought to their knees.\n\nSo, investors might be forgiven for fearing the worst as funding troubles cropped up last week.\n\nBenchmark U.S. stock indexes have struggled to exceed all-time highs this year because fears about anemic international economic growth and an unsettling conflict between the U.S. and China over import duties has investors on edge.\n\nOn top of that, a menacing phenomenon in Treasury markets, known as an inverted yield curve, has investors worrying that a recession might be looming. Companies in the S&P 500 stock index are already in the throes of an earnings recession, a period of successive declines in earnings per share, marking the first such pullback in three years. In aggregate, companies comprising the large-cap index reported an average earnings decline of 0.35% in the second quarter, after an EPS decline of 0.29% in the first quarter.\n\nCheck out: We are in an earnings recession, and it is expected to get worse\n\nThat backdrop has made market participants particularly sensitive to news on the U.S. - China international trade dispute and hiccups by the Fed, an institution seen as one of the last lines of defense when the markets go haywire, are even more unnerving.\n\nAs the WSJ notes, the Fed hasn\u2019t had to intervene in money markets in the past decade, up until last week, because the U.S. central bank \u201cflooded the financial system with reserves. It did this by buying hundreds of billions of dollars of long-term securities to spur growth after cutting interest rates to nearly zero\u201d after the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nBut despite the Fed\u2019s stumbles, Tipp said the market still \u201cmanaged to roll right through it,\u201d even after the dramatic spike in oil prices following last weekend\u2019s attack on Saudi production facilities.\n\n\u201cWhile this isn\u2019t a feel-good economy, the fact of the matter is that the market looks pretty resilient,\u201d he told MarketWatch.\n\nFor now, George Boyan, president of Leumi Investment Services, said the New York Fed\u2019s rescue measures have been effective. He pointed to the way the effective fed-funds rate inched down to 1.90% on Thursday, or well below the upper bound of the Fed\u2019s preferred target.\n\nIn the last few days, the fed-funds rate has either bumped at the range\u2019s ceiling and even briefly above it after the squeeze in repo markets spilled over into the fed-funds rates, pushing the benchmark interest rates higher.\n\nOthers saw similarities to the 1980s when the Fed would carry out repo operations a hundred to two hundred times a year, said Dave Leduc, chief investment officer of Mellon\u2019s active fixed-income arm.\n\n\u201cPeople are reacting to this as a strange thing, but they forget [the Fed\u2019s repo operations] used to happen a lot,\u201d said Leduc.\n\nAll that said, the S&P 500 SPX, -0.49%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.59% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.80% are not far from all-time highs and corporate earnings are expected to stage a turnaround. Analysts expect things to turn positive again in the upcoming holiday period, with expectations for 1.3% EPS growth overall in the calendar year.\n\nNext week, surveys may reveal to the extent to which consumers have been impacted by market volatility and slowing economic growth. A reading of U.S. consumer confidence in September is due on Tuesday and a reading of sentiment is due on Friday, with a host of other reports and Fed speakers on deck.\n\nHowever, Wall Street may be the most keenly attuned to the internal workings of the arcane short-term funding in the hope that it resumes being mundane.", "description": "Chaos hit the overnight borrowing market this week, underscoring cracks in a key funding market for Wall Street that could ripple through the real economy...", "authors": ["Sunny Oh", "Joy Wiltermuth", "Markets Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HH938_100_do_ZG_20190419100923.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
