Stearne School for an event called \u201cHi-Fives with Dads.\u201d Their purpose was to greet children in grades K-8, as they returned to school, and provide encouragement for the year ahead.\n\nThe project sprung from a meeting between Jai Crabbe, a local homeless advocate and founder of the nonprofit D.O.P.E. (Doing Our Part Eclectically) and Dave Miller of the clothing brand Peace and Love Attire. The two had met to discuss branding ideas for Miller\u2019s line and talked about their mutual passions: helping children.\n\nMiller, 37, a father of 8, tells Yahoo Lifestyle that most students at Allen M. Stearne have low-income families of which fathers are either scarce or not recognized for their efforts. \u201cSome of these kids don\u2019t even have male role models,\u201d he says.\n\nThe pair posted a Facebook prompt for neighborhood men to welcome kids to school. \u201cSomeone suggested we wear suits but that wouldn\u2019t speak to an artistic kid,\u201d Miller tells Yahoo Lifestyle.\n\nFeel good moment n story from the City of Brotherly Love. \u201cHi fives w dads\u201d- they showed up with a red carpet for kids 1st day of school & cheered them all going in. This boy was afraid to go in school so the dads went off the carpet to encourage him\ud83d\udc9a @975Mornings #Philadelphia pic.twitter.com/uTulB7OAcd \u2014 Victoria Sobolewski (@Tori_Philly4) September 4, 2019\n\nPrincipal Mecca Jason tells Yahoo Lifestyle that the school holds annual back-to-school events, and the 2019 theme was, \u201cA Whole New World.\u201d Actors wearing Aladdin, Princess Jasmine, and Genie costumes stood at the school doors, while the group of fathers stood on a red carpet leading up to the building. They offered free school supplies, children\u2019s shoes, and wristbands phrased, \u201cIt\u2019s a good day to be D.O.P.E.\u201d\n\nAmong the 200 children headed back to class was a 12-year-old boy named Ian, who recently transferred from another school. Crabbe\u2019s camera caught the emotional boy\u2019s first-day jitters as he hesitated to walk the carpet.\n\nHowever, the dads surrounded him with encouragement and offered hugs. \u201cIt\u2019s all good, big guy,\u201d said one father. \u201cYou\u2019ll do good things,\u201d said another. \u201cYou got this, it\u2019s all you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe got the same sneakers on,\u201d one dad pointed out. \u201cLet\u2019s do this!\u201d\n\nSmiling, Ian headed to class. The video of his encounter with the fathers has 46,000 Twitter views. \u201cAbsolute class,\u201d read one of many positive online comments.\n\nCrabbe tells Yahoo Lifestyle that she and Miller have formed a partnership called Mentourship to encourage male involvement in schools. \u201cWe\u2019ll hold motivational assemblies, high-five events, and provide free school supplies,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve also pledged to informally adopt Ian, providing for his needs throughout the year,\u201d says Crabbe. And this week, the partners will meet with The School District of Philadelphia to learn how they can help more children.\n\nOn Friday, the fathers had breakfast at school with Ian and his mother. Miller says, \u201cShe was really excited for him.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "A group of Philadelphia dads greeted children back to school with hugs and high-fives.", "authors": ["Elise Sol\u00e9"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/LyyFpriSG101ZoLWzjt6WA--~B/aD0xNjgwO3c9MjczODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/f0bddc50-d0ea-11e9-afbd-9d37efe71af4", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
