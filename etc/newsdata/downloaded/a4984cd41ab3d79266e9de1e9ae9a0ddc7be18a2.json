And now the government can basically decide, you know, all of the medical research that gets done,'\u201d Zuckerberg said in response to a question about Sanders\u2019s call to eliminate billionaires.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s good that there are different philanthropies and different organizations that can put competing ideas out about how to do research or science. \u2026 I fundamentally believe in that competition that you want different ideas out there.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg made similar comments at a Facebook town hall event recently when asked by a company employee about Sanders\u2019s remarks on eliminating billionaires. While arguing the National Institutes of Health deserves more money, Zuckerberg also said he is grateful that private individuals are able to spend their money on competing ideas for scientific research.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI think part of what makes progress happen is people taking different approaches to different things,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cWhat I worry about a little bit when I hear sentiments like what the senator suggested is the suggestion that this should all be done publicly would deprive the market and world of a kind of diversity of different attempts that can be taken.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSanders, a 2020 presidential candidate, told the New York Times last month while introducing his wealth tax that he does not think billionaires should exist.\n\nSanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have proposed to enact a wealth tax on the accumulated assets of multimillionaires and billionaires. Either proposal would cost the Facebook founder tens of billions of dollars over time but would not eliminate billionaires in America.\n\nAD\n\nSanders\u2019s plan introduces a new 1 percent wealth tax on those with assets over $32 million and then increases that rate in steps until it reaches 8 percent for those with more than $10 billion. Warren\u2019s plan would institute a tax of 3 percent for wealth above $1 billion, as well as a 2 percent rate for those with more than $50 million.\n\nThe plans come amid the rapid growth of inequality in the United States, with the 400 richest Americans \u2014 representing only 0.00025 percent of the population \u2014 tripling their share of the national wealth since the early 1980s. The richest 400 Americans control as much of the national wealth as the bottom 60 percent of the population.\n\nAD\n\nSanders defended his opposition to the existence of billionaires at the most recent Democratic presidential debate in Ohio, saying, \u201cWe cannot afford a billionaire class whose greed and corruption has been at war with the working families of this country for 45 years.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn his Fox remarks, Zuckerberg defended the right of people to be richly rewarded for their work while showing some sympathy for the view that people do not deserve to be billionaires. \u201cWhat I believe is I don\u2019t think that in some cosmic sense that anyone deserves to have billions of dollars,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there are a lot of people who do really good things and kind of \u2014 and help a lot of other people. And you get well compensated for that.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg has, along with fellow billionaire Bill Gates, signed the \u201cGiving Pledge,\u201d promising to give away the majority of his wealth during his lifetime. Zuckerberg has pledged to give away 99 percent of his Facebook shares.\n\nAD\n\nZuckerberg would be directly impacted by the wealth taxes proposed by Sanders and Warren. He would owe the federal government an additional $5.5 billion in taxes in the first year of Sanders\u2019s proposed tax, should it ever be enacted, according to Sanders\u2019 campaign.\n\nHad Sanders\u2019s plan been enacted decades ago, Zuckerberg would have been worth $29 billion in 2018 rather than $61 billion, according to research by Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, two left-leaning economists who have advised Sanders.\n\nHad Warren\u2019s plan been enacted decades ago, Zuckerberg would have been worth $44 billion in 2018.\n\nAD", "description": "The company's founder would owe an additional $5.5 billion in taxes in the first year of the presidential candidate's proposed tax, should it ever be enacted.", "authors": ["Jeff Stein", "Economic Policy Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/b1dMg6eDFMbAOTCsavr4RyDo4EU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XTL7YJXRCEI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
