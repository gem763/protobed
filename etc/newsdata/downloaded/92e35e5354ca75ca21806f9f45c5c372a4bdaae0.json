That charge was dismissed a day after the burning incident.\n\nLate Monday, prosecutors within the District\u2019s Office of the Attorney General dismissed the remaining misdemeanor charges of inciting violence and disorderly conduct.\n\n[Activist at center of landmark case allowing flag burning faces charges after melee in front of White House]\n\nJohnson is a member of the Revolutionary Communist Party who espouses the slogan \u201cimagine a world without America,\u201d and he has made burning flags an integral part of his protest. It was Johnson\u2019s burning of an American flag during a march against nuclear war in Dallas in 1984 that led to a landmark 1989 Supreme Court decision overturning his conviction for \u201cdesecration of a venerated object\u201d and making flag-burning a constitutionally protected right.\n\n\u201cThe First Amendment right to burn a flag survives,\u201d Johnson\u2019s attorney Mark Goldstone said. \u201cTexas versus Johnson lives, for now.\u201d\n\n\n\nJoseph Edward Scogin, 41, and Gregory \u201cJoey\u201d Lee Johnson, 62, stand outside D.C.

(Laurel Demkovich/The Washington Post)\n\nIn a statement, a spokesman for Karl A. Racine, the District\u2019s attorney general, said the office \u201cevaluated all the evidence, including evidence that was not available at the time the original charging decision was made, and determined that it is appropriate to dismiss the charges against Mr. Johnson. While our office does not condone Mr. Johnson\u2019s behavior, we will not proceed in the prosecution of this matter.\u201d\n\nLast week, in a two-page letter to Racine, Goldstone and Arthur B. Spitzer, co-legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of the District of Columbia, encouraged prosecutors to dismiss the charges against Johnson. They argued there was no evidence Johnson tried to incite violence.\n\n\u201cAs far as we can tell, there is no federal or District of Columbia criminal law that makes it an offense to burn something on Pennsylvania Avenue during daylight hours,\u201d the men wrote. They added Johnson\u2019s conduct was \u201centirely peaceful and non-threatening and therefore protected by the First Amendment.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nProsecutors request \u201880s drug kingpin Rayful Edmond III\u2019s life sentence be reduced to 40 years\n\nNew survey shows heavy psychological toll for Virginia\u2019s first responders\n\nA disproportionate number of D.C. police stops involved African Americans\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Gregory Lee Johnson faced charges of inciting violence and disorderly conduct in the July 4 incident.", "authors": ["Keith L.
