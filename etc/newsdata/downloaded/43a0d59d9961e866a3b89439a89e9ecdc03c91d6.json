As Pelosi launched the impeachment investigation, Trump\u2019s media supporters claimed Trump had done nothing wrong, suggested that the whistleblower complaint against him was the result of an elaborate deep-state conspiracy, and claimed the real blame for the growing scandal lie with the man Trump sought to have investigated, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, rather than the president.\n\nFirst, the president predictably raged on Twitter, unleashing a couple of tried-and-true favorites (\u201cPRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT,\u201d \u201cA total Witch Hunt!\u201d), complained that the Democrats ruined his day at the United Nations, and then just named off some Democratic lawmakers.\n\nFox Business Network host Lou Dobbs, who recently credited Trump for making weekends possible, spent much of his Tuesday night broadcast railing against the \u201cradical DIMMS\u201d for opening an impeachment inquiry. At one point, he brought on another one of Fox\u2019s top Trump boosters, Jeanine Pirro, to rally by the president\u2019s side.\n\n\u201cWhat happened today was disgusting,\u201d Pirro exclaimed, adding that nobody knows what was said on the president\u2019s Ukrainian call at the center of the whistleblower complaint.\n\n\u201cWe do. The president said what was said,\u201d Dobbs replied. \u201cHe said it was perfect. And he said somebody needs to look into Biden. And, by the way, he\u2019s right on both counts.\u201d\n\nFox wasn\u2019t the only conservative network running interference for the president. One America News CEO Robert Herring, who frequently tries to woo Trump into watching and promoting the conservative cable network over rival Fox, tweeted that his channel \u201chas a lot of information to release on Ukraine that will leave President Trump very happy\u2026\u201d. Meanwhile, OAN reporter and former Pizzagate conspiracy theory promoter Jack Posobiec demanded that Biden \u201crelease all of his calls with the leaders of Ukraine and China.\u201d\n\nPro-Trump websites tried to suggest that the whistleblower complaint was some kind of setup by the whistleblower\u2019s lawyers. The Federalist and the Gateway Pundit, a popular conservative blog that regularly runs hoaxes, seized on one lawyer\u2019s history of working for Democrats. The Washington Examiner, meanwhile, claimed that the whistleblower\u2019s two lawyers work for a group that \u201coffers to pay officials who leak against Trump.\u201d In fact, however, the whistleblower aid group only offers temporary housing help for whistleblowers who could lose their jobs.\n\nTrump\u2019s internet fanbase rallied to his side, as well. On The_Donald, the largest Reddit forum for Trump supporters, moderators pinned a meme that implied Democrats were pursuing impeachment because of \u201cbutthurt\u201d to the top of the page.\n\nLater during Fox\u2019s primetime broadcast, host Tucker Carlson began his program by insisting he had \u201cno idea\u201d why the Democrats were looking into impeaching the president, wondering why it was \u201csomehow criminal\u201d for the president to ask about \u201cJoe Biden\u2019s ne\u2019er do well son\u201d receiving \u201c600 grand a year from Russian oligarchs.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have been trying to understand what the Democrats are alleging here,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe have come to the conclusion that they are saying it was okay for Biden\u2019s son to take this money.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, just a few hours earlier, Fox News anchor Shep Smith pointed out that any allegations of wrongdoing against Biden or his son are \u201cbaseless\u201d and the narrative that\u2019s being pushed by Trump and his supporters is a \u201cconspiracy theory.\u201d\n\nOne of Carlson\u2019s guests, The Federalist\u2019s Sean Davis, sang a familiar tune, complaining that this was \u201cRussia all over again\u201d and that there was \u201cno actual evidence anywhere of any wrongdoing,\u201d all while dismissing the allegations as \u201crumors and gossip.\u201d\n\nAnother of the Fox News host\u2019s guests, Trump ally Joe diGenova, took a potshot at one of Carlson\u2019s colleagues. Earlier on Smith\u2019s program, Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano said that Trump committed a \u201ccrime\u201d with his call, prompting diGenova to call the Fox News analyst a \u201cfool.\u201d\n\nAnd then there was Sean Hannity, who has been described as the White House shadow chief of staff. The Fox News star delivered a lengthy, rambling, at-times incomprehensible, show-opening monologue in which he completely defended the president\u2019s actions while simultaneously raging against the \u201cDeep State.\u201d\n\nAfter Fox News correspondent Ed Henry reported that one of his sources is saying that the whistleblower has \u201cpolitical bias\u201d against Trump and the transcript of the call won\u2019t show a \u201csmoking gun\u201d but will include some portions that will \u201craise eyebrows,\u201d Hannity then demanded that Biden share his communications.\n\n\u201cIs Joe Biden going to release his conversations?\u201d Hannity exclaimed. \u201cI would like to demand that Joe Biden now release all of his conversations that he had when he was vice president with Ukraine. Especially now in light of what we learned about Joe Biden.\u201d\n\nThe coup de grace, however, was delivered by Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett. The conservative commentator, who has spent the past couple of years railing against the Russia investigation, claimed that it was actually Trump\u2019s legal duty to ask Ukraine to go after Biden.\n\n\u201cThe president is duty-bound under the take care clause of the Constitution,\u201d he declared. \u201cIf he knows of a particularly corrupt act by a vice president trying to extort a foreign country to shutdown a probe that involves his son.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president is duty-bound to ask that foreign country, investigate, produce the evidence, give it to us,\u201d Jarrett concluded. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t do it, it is a dereliction of his constitutional duty!\u201d\n\nHannity, meanwhile, was extremely pleased with that response, adding that \u201cthe president had a legal responsibility in lieu of the fact that Russia tried to influence our elections.\u201d", "description": "Joe Biden\u2019s to blame. No, the whistleblower\u2019s lawyers are to blame.
