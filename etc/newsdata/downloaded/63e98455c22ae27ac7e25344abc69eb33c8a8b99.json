(U.S. Army/Department of Defense)\n\nOn the morning of Sept. 11, 2001, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld was at the Pentagon, sitting at a round wooden table that once belonged to Union Army General William Tecumseh Sherman.\n\nHe was watching television images from New York, where two planes had just slammed into the World Trade Center.\n\nSuddenly, the walls began shaking. Then the table.\n\n\u201cSherman had famously commented that \u2018war is hell,\u2019 \u201d Rumsfeld wrote in his 2011 memoir. \u201cHell had descended on the Pentagon.\u201d\n\nRumsfeld suspected another plane had hit the five-sided concrete fortress \u2014 a hulking symbol of American war power. He raced through smoke and jet fuel fumes to reach the crash site. Nearly there, an Air Force lieutenant colonel told him, \u201cYou can\u2019t go farther.\u201d\n\nBut Rumsfeld was Rumsfeld. He could do whatever he darn well pleased.\n\n\u201cOutside I found fresh air and a chaotic scene,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFor the first time I could see the clouds of black smoke rising from the west side of the building. I ran along the Pentagon\u2019s perimeter, and then saw the flames.\u201d\n\n[F-16 pilot was ready to give her life on Sept. 11]\n\nBut Rumsfeld, a highly quotable Washington hand whose famous quips include a soliloquy on \u201cknown unknowns,\u201d did not know he was a known unknown at the White House.\n\n\u201cAt first we thought Secretary Rumsfeld had been hit,\u201d White House aide Mary Matalin said in Garrett M. Graff\u2019s \u201cThe Only Plane in the Sky,\u201d his new oral history of the attacks. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t get a location on the secretary of defense.\u201d\n\n\n\nRumsfeld helps carry a stretcher to an ambulance in this video image. (CNN)\n\nBy then, Rumsfeld was standing near the point of attack.\n\n\u201cHe was like the captain going down with the ship,\u201d Aubrey Davis, a Defense Department protective service officer, said in Graff\u2019s book.\n\nDavis remembered Rumsfeld bending down to pick up part of the plane.\n\n\u201cThis is American Airlines,\u201d he said.\n\nThere were bodies and debris all around him. In his memoir, titled \u201cKnown and Unknown,\u201d he wrote:\n\nA few folks from the Pentagon were there doing what they could to assist the wounded. I saw some in uniform running back into the burning building, hoping to bring more of the injured out. \u201cWe need help over here,\u201d I heard someone say. I ran over. One young woman sitting in the grass, wounded, bruised, and a bit bloodied, looked up at me and squinted. Even though she couldn\u2019t stand she said, \u201cI can help. I can hold an IV.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, there was an urgent unknown: Rumsfeld\u2019s location.\n\n\u201cThe Communications Center kept asking where the secretary was,\u201d Davis said in Graff\u2019s book, \u201cand I kept saying we had him. They couldn\u2019t hear.\u201d\n\nOfficials in the Pentagon\u2019s command center thought he\u2019d been whisked to a secure site. Nope. Rumsfeld was still out among the wreckage, where the dead would number 184.\n\n\u201cThe next thing we know,\u201d Victoria Clarke, Rumsfeld\u2019s then-spokeswoman, said in Graff\u2019s book, \u201che had come in to the command center \u2014 dirty, sweaty, with his jacket over his shoulder.\u201d\n\nHe was ready for war \u2014 a war still being waged in Afghanistan 18 years later. It is the longest conflict in U.S. history and has taken the lives of more than 2,400 Americans.\n\nFor Rumsfeld, the chaotic scene, the fires, the bodies, the debris \u2014 those images, seen up close with his own eyes, came to define him, the country and the rest of many lives.\n\n\u201cOur building,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbecame a battleground.\u201d That piece of aircraft he picked up \u2014 it has become a reminder \u201cof the loss of life, of our country\u2019s vulnerability to terrorists, and of our duty to prevent more attacks of that kind.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Pentagon at sunrise on Sept. 12, 2001.
