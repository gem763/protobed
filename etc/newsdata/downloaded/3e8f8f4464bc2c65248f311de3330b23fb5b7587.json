His old Somerset friend Jack Leach held firm once more from No 10 and is set to resume alongside him on 10 on Friday morning.\n\nButtler, speaking after his first Ashes half-century in 17 innings and at the end of a personally low-key series, said: \u201cI\u2019ve found batting hard this summer and it was nice to relax and try to have some fun. That style of batting comes naturally. I enjoyed it, especially with Jack at the other end.\u201d\n\nThe 29-year-old is among a number of World Cup winners deemed to have been tired during the second half of this epic English summer but, despite averaging 16 in the series before this finale, the man himself was less certain.\n\n\u201cYou might not feel that tired or that jaded but you hear it bandied around as a reason why you might not be playing that well and you start to believe it,\u201d Buttler said. \u201cI\u2019ve gone around the question of fatigue quite a lot. At times I feel I am but at other times it gets put in your brain that you should be.\u201d\n\nEngland remain in the contest despite failing to capitalise on a lacklustre start by Australia. Root was dropped three times between 24 and 30 en route to an unconverted a score of 57, while the recalled Sam Curran, who made 15, had a life on seven when Pat Cummins trapped him lbw off what proved to be a front\u2011foot no-ball.\n\nDespite a seemingly underwhelming day with the bat, Root\u2019s bowlers will at least be encouraged by the swing Marsh managed to extract when he pounced after tea. It is something which has been fleeting for much of the series.\n\nMitchell Marsh swings into Ashes groove to hush Australian naysayers | Geoff Lemon Read more\n\nThe likeable all-rounder, who battled cramp on his return to the side, was dropped by Australia in January amid a poor home summer and with questions being asked about his weight. Speaking after the close, Marsh also divulged that a close friend killing themselves had contributed to his dip in form.\n\nMarsh said: \u201cLast year was a range of stuff \u2013 a few things in my personal life. I lost a close friend to suicide at the start of the Australia summer. I didn\u2019t handle it as well as I could have. It transitioned into my cricket. To have gone through that and got through the summer, I knew I still had love for the game.\u201d\n\nOn the battle to stay trim, the 27-year-old said: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t terrible, my body just seems to put on weight easily and my mum likes to feed me. I haven\u2019t had as many roasts at home in the last six months.\n\n\u201cBut it hasn\u2019t been that hard, I love playing for Australia I want to keep doing it, so I\u2019ll keep working. I\u2019m waking up every day wanting to be the best cricketer I can. Today was a good reward for that. But it\u2019s one day of the Test match and we have a long way to go in this game.\u201d", "description": "Jos Buttler put confusing thoughts of fatigue to one side and decided to have some fun before the counterattacking half-century that has kept England\u2019s heads above water in the final Ashes Test", "authors": ["Ali Martin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44a2eaa2393c72c75c865c55c934ca9ea112f6b8/699_681_4773_2864/master/4773.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3766e478d6276d33fde9509240fb2dd1", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
