He played on special teams in the national championship game against Alabama.\n\nWhile with Clemson, Smith also played a few games against Syracuse, which enters Saturday\u2019s game in College Park ranked No. 21 in the nation. Last year Clemson escaped with a 27-23 win over Syracuse at home and went on to win the national title. The 80,122 fans in Death Valley did not intimidate the Orange.\n\n\u201cThis team (Syracuse) could have beaten Clemson last year,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThis is a tough team coming in here. It is going to take all hands on deck for this game. They have one of the most explosive offenses in the country. It is unmatched.\u201d\n\nHe added that preparing for Syracuse in recent years was \u201ca very stressful week in practice\u201d because the Syracuse offense is very quick.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t create that in practice, but you try to do as much as you can,\u201d Smith said. \u201cNothing much has changed. They have a lot of players on offense, very dynamic. They play at a high level.\u201d\n\nSmith, 22, said it doesn\u2019t do the Syracuse offense justice to just watch them on television \u2013 or in the film room.\n\n\u201cThey try to run a play every 15 seconds or something,\u201d said Smith, noting that for most teams it takes about 25 seconds. \u201cWe working on going fast. Just things I have been stressing to the guys. They are going to give us a lot of different formations on offense.\u201d\n\nSmith was a standout under coach Kevin Wright at St. Frances in Baltimore. He finished his prep career at the notable IMG Academy in Florida, where he played for coach Chris Weinke, the former NFL quarterback.\n\nSmith finished his high school career as a second-team USA Today All-American. He was the top prospect at his position in Maryland and one of the top six linebackers in the country, according to Rivals.com.\n\nTerrapins coach Mike Locksley has long recruited in the DMV and was glad to bring Smith to College Park.\n\n\u201cWe ask him to be really strong against the run, set the edge against tight ends,\u201d Locksley said. \u201cWe thought he played very physical at the point of attack.\u201d\n\nSmith earned his degree in parks, recreation and tourism management from Clemson in May, which made him eligible to play this year as a graduate student for the Terrapins. He is working towards a master\u2019s in professional studies in technology entrepreneurship.\n\nSmith had several family and friends in the stands for his first game with Maryland last week, when the Terrapins blitzed Howard 79-0.\n\n\u201cRunning out of that tunnel in front of my family and friends and the home crowd, it was kind of different,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIt felt great. I was glad to be home.\u201d\n\nAfter playing inside linebacker at Clemson, Smith moved to outside linebacker for Locksley, which was not a problem against Howard.\n\n\u201cIt felt natural. I played there my freshman year of high school,\u201d Smith said.\n\nHe registered a sack and three total tackles against Howard. Now he\u2019ll look to parlay his familiarity with the Orange into another successful Saturday.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
