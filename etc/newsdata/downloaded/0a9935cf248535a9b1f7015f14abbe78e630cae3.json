But not everyone is equally able to access this source of funding: The ability to raise money online depends heavily on how wealthy a person\u2019s friends and other connections are.\n\nFor those who aren\u2019t well off, it\u2019s often hard to raise even a fraction of what\u2019s needed. What we need are ways to spread the crowdfunding money around more evenly.\n\nOn GoFundMe alone, there are more than 250,000 health-care crowdfunding campaigns each year, according to the crowdfunding site. Health care accounted for about a third of the money the platform raised in 2017, GoFundMe says, although cautioning that the category is self-selected by those raising money.\n\nAs I encounter more and more of these medical appeals among my own online circle of friends, colleagues and acquaintances, I\u2019ve thought about how we can help people from less affluent communities gain greater access to this increasingly crucial source of support.\n\nHelp from platforms\n\nOne possibility is that funding platforms could encourage users to opt into a donation-equity program. Facebook , for instance, already levies a 2.6% processing fee on personal fundraisers, so it is already set up to take a slice of donations. It could double that fee\u2014with the fundraiser\u2019s consent\u2014keeping half to cover processing costs and using the other 2.6% to top up donations to similar campaigns by lower-income fundraisers that aren\u2019t doing well. Facebook could use the data it has on users\u2019 education, employment and purchase history (as well as the education and employment history of friends) to make inferences about the socioeconomic status of anyone running an individual fundraising campaign, and then match donors to similar campaigns from people with less affluent friends.\n\nOnline platforms could also set up simple mechanisms for fundraisers and donors to help others as much as they want. A fundraiser might stipulate, for instance, that 10% of her funding will be shared with people with similar needs but fewer resources, or a donor might make that choice at the time of donation.\n\nFor example, if a donor\u2019s lawyer friend is running a fundraiser to cover the costs of three months off work while in chemo, Facebook could redirect 10% of that donation to helping someone who is missing shifts at Walmart or McDonald\u2019s for similar reasons. Yes, the donor could simply make a contribution to one of the many charitable organizations that provide financial support to offset the financial challenges of a health crisis (the Cancer Financial Assistance Coalition can help you find one), but the friend-to-friend appeal is a powerful fundraiser. Building an optional redistributive element into these fundraisers would be an easy way to increase donations to the medical costs of lower-income families.\n\nAnother approach would ask fundraisers to consider adopting a twin campaign. When fundraisers set up a crowdfunding campaign, the crowdfunding platform could invite them to attach a similar campaign to their own. For example, if someone is raising money to build a wheelchair ramp for their home, the funding platform might show her a few similar wheelchair-ramp fundraisers from people who haven\u2019t been able to meet their campaign goals. The fundraiser could choose one of them as a co-beneficiary, and the campaign could note that 10% of donations would go to someone else in need.\n\nA browser option\n\nIf crowdfunding platforms don\u2019t set up mechanisms to help people spread contributions around, a nonprofit organization or software developer could offer a third-party solution. I have a browser extension that hunts down coupons before I make an online purchase; why can\u2019t I have a browser extension that hunts down worthy recipients before I make a personal fundraising donation?\n\nHere\u2019s how it could work: Installing the crowdfunding equity extension\u2014let\u2019s call it CEE\u2014would mean you\u2019d have a little watchdog for all your online giving. When you click the donate button on a personal fundraising campaign, CEE would search that crowdfunding platform for campaigns that are similar to the one you\u2019re supporting but haven\u2019t met their fundraising goals. It would then offer you a selection of one, three or perhaps five campaigns for you to consider supporting, along with the one you had in mind.\n\nBy drawing on the publicly available data associated with the social-media profiles of those other campaigns, CEE could ensure that these matching campaigns come from people who live in neighborhoods or cities other than your own, or from people who are in a different ethnic or religious community (which can be inferred from what someone follows and shares), or who belong to a different age or socioeconomic group (which can be inferred from social-media posts). The point is not only to ensure that these additional dollars go to people who have less access to donations, but also to turn crowdfunding into a way of building relationships and investments across different communities instead of simply reinforcing existing social connections.\n\nYou could see one-click options to tack on a donation equal to the one you were already planning, or to apply a 10% solidarity surcharge, or to make a nominal $5 donation. By sparing you the effort of finding comparable campaigns or causes\u2014and by showing you people in similar circumstances to the person you want to help\u2014CEE would catalyze fundraising donations at a moment when wallets are already open, and help level the playing field for medical crowdfunding.\n\nCombating fraud\n\nThere is at least one obvious complication in these ideas: Some personal fundraising campaigns are either fraudulent or misrepresentative. Crowdfunding platforms have limited their liability by refusing to guarantee or vet the veracity of fundraising appeals, so the only real check on misrepresentation is the fact that people for the most part are donating to other people they know. If crowdfunding platforms start to redistribute funds, donors will expect those funds to go to people who are genuinely in need\u2014but vetting every campaign is a tall order.\n\nThe most practical way to address this problem is to allocate funds to people who have received donations from a number of verified accounts with real humans behind them. Maybe a young person of limited means can only raise $100 from his social circle, but if that comes in the form of $5 donations from 20 different people with real (nonbot) social-media presences, the platform can be reasonably confident that it\u2019s a genuine fundraiser. Platforms could also reduce fraud by enabling donations only for accounts that have been verified by some form of real-world identity check, like scanning a driver\u2019s license, or by transferring funds directly to verified providers of goods and services (including, in the case of living expenses, landlords), rather than simply giving cash directly to the person running the fundraiser. Both those steps were recommended by the authors of a study on crowdfunding fraud recently published in the journal Policy & Internet, Marco Zenone and Jeremy Snyder.\n\nBy addressing fraud and inequity, these kinds of solutions can mitigate some of the concerns that arise from crowdfunding, and make it a more inclusive part of the health-funding picture.\n\nDr. Samuel is a technology researcher and the author of \u201cWork Smarter With Social Media.\u201d Email her at reports@wsj.com.", "description": "Crowdfunding campaigns depend on having wealthy connections.
