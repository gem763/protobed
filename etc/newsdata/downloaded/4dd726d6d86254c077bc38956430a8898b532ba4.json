Amazon acquired the service in 2014 for a reported $970 million, after an overture from Google fell through.\n\nThe platform is still geared predominantly towards young viewers, and is now the most popular live streaming site in the U.S., according to a study from Qwilt, a company that provides video caching services to content creators.\n\nThe site hosts live gaming and esports streams as well as lifestyle channels devoted to cooking, travel and other topics.\n\nFollow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg.
