It serves as one of the last physical reminders of the civil war, which began as a coup in 1936. An alliance of Nationalists, some Catholics, conservatives and the fascist Falange party ousted the left-leaning Spanish Second Republic in 1936. Franco was chosen as general at the start of the war and, upon the Nationalists\u2019 1939 victory, consolidated the right-wing parties into an authoritarian government.\n\nThe regime\u2019s early years saw the mass imprisonment, execution and exile of those who supported the republic.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn 1940, the Valley of the Fallen was proposed as a memorial to honor the dead on both sides of the civil war, but it was actually built by political prisoners over 18 years, undermining that goal. As historian and journalist Giles Tremlett has detailed, it was one site in a much larger prison network that harnessed the labor of political prisoners \u2014 more than 2 percent of the male population in the decades between the war and the early 1950s.\n\nDuring the 1960s, the Franco government disinterred some 30,000 to 40,000 of the war dead from mass graves around the country, both Republicans and Nationalists, as a gesture of respect for both sides and to help the country heal and move forward. They were buried anonymously, and without family permission, in the basilica\u2019s crypt. Only two graves in the basilica would be marked: those of Franco, who died in 1975, and Falange founder Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera. Keeping Franco\u2019s remains at this public site erased any hint that the valley could serve to heal the civil war\u2019s wounds.\n\nSucceeding Franco after his death was King Juan Carlos, his handpicked heir. But the king ushered the nation into a constitutional monarchy with free elections. Juan Carlos, despite public promises to the contrary, had been secretly meeting with pro-democracy leaders before Franco\u2019s death.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSpaniards wanted democracy, but a national desire to avoid further conflict was paramount in ensuring the transition. This began a process of public forgetting, as Spain embraced democracy. Symbols of Franco like statues were removed from public spaces. Street names were changed. The valley, with Franco\u2019s grave, stood as one of the few physical reminders of the Franco era. While erasing monuments lionizing or heroizing brutal leaders like Franco can have merit, the erasure of Francoism had less constructive aims: Spaniards simply wanted to forget their painful past.\n\nThough demonstrations for the release of political prisoners immediately followed Franco\u2019s death, it was not until 1977 that the newly elected parliament granted general amnesty to remaining political prisoners. The amnesty exonerated not only those imprisoned under Franco but also agents of Franco\u2019s regime. The law codified the pacto del olvido, an informal agreement between Spain\u2019s left- and right-wing parties to forget atrocities committed during and after the war. For the country to move forward, both sides would need to forget what the other had done.\n\nStarting anew meant embracing an uncharacteristic silence about Spain\u2019s recent history. In the valley\u2019s gift shop, most traces of Franco were eliminated. Even now, there is just one permanent exhibition in Spain on its civil war, located in the Historical Memory Documentary Center in Salamanca.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nActivists are trying to remember, however. Since 2000, Emilio Silva\u2019s Association for the Recovery of Historical Memory has recovered more than 9,000 bodies from mass graves across Spain, a project it has made public in an effort to mourn the bloodshed of the civil war and its aftermath. The pact of forgetting has left generations of Spaniards with little knowledge of the war or Franco\u2019s reign. Silva and other activists hope these exhumations will catalyze educational initiatives and state accountability by shining light on Franco\u2019s victims.\n\nIn 2007, Spain passed a Historical Memory Law, which formally denounced Franco\u2019s regime, ended political celebrations at the valley and offered support for the continued recovery of remains, though this has largely been symbolic. While the law regulated the exhumation and identification of Franco\u2019s victims, it still omits names of guilty parties.\n\nExhumations have allowed many Spaniards to grieve their lost family members and reconcile personal histories. But debates surrounding exhumation are still contentious: Many on the right believe they reopen old wounds. The basilica\u2019s abbot has vehemently opposed exhumation at the valley; it wasn\u2019t until a 2016 court ruling that remains in the crypt could be disinterred and returned to families.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nToday, moving Franco\u2019s remains has provoked intense debate. Spain\u2019s resurgent right, including leader Santiago Abascal of the far-right Vox party, has condemned the decision to move the remains, which have been relocated to a family crypt in Madrid\u2019s La Almudena Cathedral, a central, accessible site.\n\nVox would prefer to avoid a public reckoning with Franco\u2019s legacy and contested the exhumation. It emerged as a far-right split from the conservative People\u2019s Party during the wave of anti-immigrant sentiment that invigorated far-right parties across Europe before the 2014 European Union elections. The party\u2019s strong nationalist platform echoed Francoism in its pledge to quell separatist movements in Catalonia and restore Spain\u2019s sovereignty. Many saw Vox as a minor threat, believing Spain\u2019s recent return to democracy had inoculated it against Europe\u2019s populist fever. But in December 2018, Vox secured 12 regional assembly seats in Andalusia, the first time a nationalist party had won more than a single seat since Franco.\n\nAnd while interring Franco in a more central location would seem in Vox\u2019s favor, party leaders view this as \u201ckicking him off his pedestal\u201d in the valley. The move may also unearth the most extremist adherents on the right, making explicit the connection between Vox today and Franco\u2019s regime.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOnce the dust settles on the question of remains, a second question arises of what the Valley of the Fallen itself will become. Some, like former prisoner Nicol\u00e1s S\u00e1nchez-Albornoz, want the government to cut funding and let nature devour the site. Others, like Vox, want it left as is. Both erosion and maintenance are permitted under the pacto del olvido.\n\nBut many are tired of forgetting and prefer a third path: deconsecration of the basilica, which would allow it to be turned into the first formal museum for the Spanish Civil War. They want to remember and educate the country about the civil war \u2014 without lionizing it.\n\nAnd remembering may require courage. Spaniards will need to confront the ways that present-day institutions, like the Civil Guard, the country\u2019s national police force, operated under Francoism. They will need to ask questions of their families\u2019 histories, breaking the decades-old pact of forgetting, which has allowed both the political resurgence of the far right and the continued erasure of Franco\u2019s victims. Franco\u2019s exhumation is not the end of a chapter but the beginning of a difficult \u2014 perhaps boisterous \u2014 national conversation.\n\nAD", "description": "Revisiting the dictator\u2019s resting place offers a chance to reckon with a dark history.", "authors": ["Kayla Meyers", "Kayla Meyers Is An Educator", "Historian Of Media", "Politics", "Author Of The Forthcoming Book"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/zRQu5SS2cUEY1tcgxQal6YicjRg=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DNYBFCHVTYI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
