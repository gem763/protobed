So it\u2019s very difficult for the market to have a real extreme move to the downside and stay down with so much money on the sidelines,\u201d said James Carney, chief executive officer of ParPlus Partners, in an interview.\n\nMoney-market funds have seen assets rise for three straight weeks, according to Deutsche Bank, and have received $497 billion in net inflows year-to-date, despite seeing outflows of $55 billion in the months of March and April. Equity funds have continued to see outflows.\n\nIn a note, Tony Dwyer, analyst at Canaccord Genuity, said the nervousness is palpable.\n\n\u201cWe have been meeting with institutional, family office, and household investors around the world over the past few weeks, and can only conclude that nearly everyone is nervous and in a defensive position. The volatility around Brexit, the trade war, a possible impeachment, and global economic deceleration has everyone on edge,\u201d he said.\n\nSee: Trump\u2019s next move could lead to a 25% drop in stocks, says billionaire investor\n\nAfter a rocky start, the S&P 500 SPX, -0.39% and Dow Jones Industrial DJIA, -0.95% turned positive for the month on Tuesday. Initial jitters came as a closely watched gauge of manufacturing activity slipped further into contraction mode, underlining recession worries.\n\nStocks jumped at the end of last week after President Donald Trump touted a partial trade agreement with China, though enthusiasm cooled amid a lack of detail and less committal language from Beijing. A largely positive start to earnings season on Tuesday helped propel equities higher, though they gave back some ground Wednesday after a weaker-than-expected reading on retail sales and some angry rhetoric from Beijing over widely supported U.S. legislation supporting pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong.\n\nMeanwhile, volatility, as measured by the CBOE Volatility Index VIX, +3.34%, remains subdued at below 14. The VIX, an options-based gauge of expected volatility over the coming 30-day period, remains below its long-term average around 19 after briefly pushing above 20 at the beginning of the month.\n\nDwyer said four of his favorite tactical indicators now stand in \u201cneutral territory,\u201d with first, the percentage of S&P 500 companies above their 10- and 50-day moving averages falling from 76% and 58%, respectively, to 20% and 40%; second, a retreat by the VIX from more than 21; third, a drop in the 14-week stochastic indicator \u2014 a gauge of stock-market momentum \u2014 rising back to 73 after dropping below 30. Finally, 47.6% of newsletter writers were bullish in last week\u2019s Investor Intelligence reading, a he said, pulling back from a recent high near 55%. The reading tends to serve as a contrarian indicator.\n\nWhile the backdrop is mixed, Dwyer said he remains offensively positioned heading into 2020, arguing that falling market rates \u201chave already done the work of stimulating future growth,\u201d while Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell\u2019s commitment to responding to weaker data provides underlying support. Canaccord\u2019s 2020 target for the S&P 500 is 3,350, around 11.8% above Tuesday\u2019s close.\n\nAs for volatility, don\u2019t count October out yet, said Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Reseach, in a Monday note. While positive on U.S. equities, he warned that investors remain in the midst of a seasonal rough patch.\n\nAfter all, uncertainty around international trade remains despite last week\u2019s agreement, particularly since the next major event won\u2019t occur until an expected meeting between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Chile next month. Meanwhile, investors appear to know earnings estimates are too high, making revenues a \u201cwild card\u201d in terms of results and guidance as earnings season gets under way, he said. And then there\u2019s the Fed meeting at the end of the month.\n\n\u201cThe rest of October will hit all the same topics (trade, zero earnings growth, rates) that have made the last year so volatile, just compressed into 14 trading days with meaningful developments on each issue,\u201d Colas said.", "description": "October is proving to be as gentle as a kitten to stock-market investors so far, belying its history as the most volatile month of the year.", "authors": ["William Watts", "Deputy Markets Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GR675_masks2_ZG_20181012063301.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
