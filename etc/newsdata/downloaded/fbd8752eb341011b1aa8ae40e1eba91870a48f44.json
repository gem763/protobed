The tee, with \u201cIn\u201d on the front in \u201980s typeface and \u201cStyle\u201d on the back, was sold on Abloh\u2019s website for $US120. It sold out within days.\n\nBrown, who has been in magazines since she was 19, is a new kind of fashion editor. She is accessible and friendly (she greets everyone at the LUXURY shoot with a hug before apologising: \u201cI\u2019m a hugger, sorry\u201d).\n\nFashionista website deputy editor Tyler McCall, whose job is to interview big-name editors like Brown, says she is \u201ccompletely different to what you\u2019d expect of someone in her position. She\u2019s goofy and approachable; she has fun. She\u2019s not in some office, removed from everyone.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s quite rare in fashion to be exactly yourself, all the time. Not Laura. She walks in the room and people want to hang out with her. \u2014 Nicky Zimmermann, designer\n\nOn her Instagram feed, Brown hams it up to her 285,000 followers, sipping wine with celebrities not just because they might be on her next cover, but because she genuinely has a rapport and friendship with many of them.\n\nKellie Hush, former Harper\u2019s BAZAAR editor-in-chief and longtime friend of Brown\u2019s, says that Brown once rang her to ask a favour. \u201cShe said, \u2018I\u2019ve got this friend coming to Sydney, she doesn\u2019t know anyone. Will you take her out for dinner?\u2019 I said, \u2018Sure.\u2019 I get her phone number and it\u2019s Monica Lewinsky.\u201d\n\nDesigner Nicky Zimmermann says she believes Brown has been so successful because she\u2019s always been this way. \u201cIt\u2019s quite rare in fashion to be exactly yourself, all the time. People come to functions and hide themselves. Not Laura. She walks in the room and people want to hang out with her. She\u2019s very disarming.\u201d\n\n\u201cA really good hang\u201d: Brown says Oprah Winfrey, who featured on a 2018 cover, is a \"good hang\".\n\nIn Brown\u2019s small, unassuming office (for a fashion editor, anyway), there are two photos of Oprah Winfrey, and they (along with a wall of InStyle covers) are some of the only clues to the woman\u2019s enormous power and reach. \u201cYou know what\u2019s great about Oprah?\u201d Brown asks in her still-broad Australian accent. \u201cShe\u2019s Oprah, obviously, and she\u2019s all those glorious things you imagine. But she\u2019s kind of a really good hang. I\u2019m not saying I would go to Santa Barbara and have drinks with her every day \u2026 But we\u2019ll have a drink and she\u2019s very natural in herself. She doesn\u2019t come in with a halo on.\u201d\n\nMaybe. But it also takes a certain kind of person to be the person Oprah\u2019s hanging with: the two photos are proof of that. The first was taken when Brown was executive editor at US Harper\u2019s BAZAAR, the second is of both women holding that first framed photo. It was taken in 2018, when Brown ran Oprah on the cover after her rousing Golden Globes speech that inspired thousands of #Oprah2020 tweets. Oprah told Brown she wasn\u2019t running for office, but that was beside the point: Brown wasn\u2019t afraid to put politics front and centre (and, incidentally, the story resulted in InStyle\u2019s highest monthly digital audience at that point).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn some ways, she hasn\u2019t had a choice. Brown took over the editorship at InStyle in 2016, three months before Donald Trump won the presidential election. The next day, she shouted the office \u2013 mainly Millennial women \u2013 pizza and cake, and told them to do whatever they needed to do to take care of themselves. Then she got to work. \u201cYou have to have a point of view,\u201d she says. \u201cYou have to fricking show up and have something to say.\u201d\n\nFashion has always been political but often fashion magazines have not. Brown is turning that on its head. Joe Biden has appeared in InStyle, and so has civil rights advocate John Lewis and former Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards.\n\nWhen Trump announced a ban on transgender people serving in the US military, Brown asked her team to find a \u201crad transgender woman\u201d serving her country (they did; army captain Jennifer Peace spoke to InStyle about how the US government spends more on erectile dysfunction than trans healthcare).\n\nBrown in the New York office of 'InStyle' magazine. Paola+Murray\n\nBrown herself walked in the 2017 Women\u2019s March, and, the weekend after the Christchurch massacre, posted on Instagram that she was heading into the next week with \u201caggressive kindness\u201d. She invited her followers to join her.\n\n\u201cYou just can\u2019t ignore the divisions in this country,\u201d she says. But plenty of fashion glossies do ignore politics and stick to escapism. And when they do dip their toes into political waters, it\u2019s with mixed success. US Vogue made history and headlines when it endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2016 (the first time it had made a public bid for a candidate), but last year it landed in hot water after publishing a story in defence of Harvey Weinstein\u2019s wife, Marchesa designer Georgina Chapman.\n\nI love making things. I can slap down an issue and go, \u2018I did that.\u2019 I love having that ownership.\u201d \u2014 Laura Brown, 'InStyle' magazine\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t sit there and go, \u2018Eff Trump\u2019 all day,\u201d says Brown. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s clever. A lighter hand is more powerful than a shaking fist.\u201d What she does, instead, is highlight leaders who she thinks are \u201cbadass\u201d. She even put that word on the cover.\n\n\u201cAt first I did think, wow, \u2018ass\u2019 looks really big on the cover\u2026 but how else do you describe these women and what they do?\u201d She shrugs. No advertisers pulled out, and now, \u201cBadass Women\u201d is an annual issue.\n\nBrown\u2019s first memory of fashion, she says in her signature self-deprecating way, spoke to her \u201cdelusions of grandeur at an early age\u201d. She was 14 and watching a Woolmark fashion show to celebrate Australia\u2019s bicentenary at the Sydney Opera House.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was Karl Lagerfeld and Claude Montana. I fell for it then and there.\u201d It was more than the clothes, she says; it was the entire world that the show represented. \u201cThese people, they were the most brilliant, the most creative. I thought, \u2018God, that\u2019s what life can be like.\u2019 \u201d\n\nTo this day, she remains enamoured of the physical manifestations of fashion. \u201cI love making things,\u201d she says. \u201cI say to influencers and people floating around taking pictures of themselves: what do you make? What do you produce? I can slap down an issue of InStyle once a month or a story every week and go, \u2018I did that.\u2019 I love having that ownership.\u201d\n\nWith Elle Macpherson at the American Australian Arts Awards in January. Carl Timpone\n\nShe\u2019s done exactly that for more than 25 years now, cutting her teeth at Australian Family and Harper\u2019s BAZAAR in Sydney, before leaving to try her luck in the US. She arrived on September 4, 2001. It would have been understandable if she came home after September 11, but Brown chose to tough it out in her new home, where she became The Australian\u2019s New York fashion correspondent.\n\nStints at Tina Brown\u2019s Talk magazine, W and Details followed before she became executive editor at US Harper\u2019s BAZAAR in 2005. There, she developed an ease with the celebrities she featured in the magazine and a knack for distilling the exact moment for that all-important cover shot: the difference between someone buying the magazine or not.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t force a photo,\u201d she says. \u201cI was on so many shoots where the editor was like, \u2018Right, you need to get her wearing this dress and in this pose and doing this kind of smile.\u2019 And you can try to persuade, but at the end of the day you\u2019re working with a human being who\u2019s going to do something or they\u2019re not.\u201d\n\nIt sounds overly simple, but identifying that actors, models, singers and designers are human beings is something of a revelation for many fashion magazines, whose profiles and covers can often feel formulaic. \u201cNumber one, I don\u2019t shoot a woman for the magazine who I don\u2019t respect. I don\u2019t care if you have a huge following, I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re going to promote it,\u201d she says. (Case in point: in her three years at InStyle, exactly zero Kardashian-Jenners have graced the cover.)\n\nI used to have to chase Jennifer Aniston around all the time because she sold, but digital has changed that. \u2014 Laura Brown, 'InStyle' magazine\n\nHistorically, women who are not blonde, thin and beautiful have not sold magazines. But under Brown, InStyle\u2019s covers have become more diverse. She\u2019s featured the likes of Janet Jackson, a 53-year-old woman of colour, and Melissa McCarthy, a plus-size woman. \u201cThat idea of the cookie-cutter model on the cover is so old-fashioned,\u201d says Brown. \u201cI really find it so dull. I am so fricking lucky to sit in the same room as Melissa McCarthy.\u201d\n\nMaybe, she says, this is the silver lining of magazines not being as dependent on news-stand sales as they once were. \u201cI used to have to chase Jennifer Aniston around all the time because she sold, but digital has changed that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt means that you really have to have a strong sense of identity, as opposed to \u2018Here\u2019s a model, here\u2019s the woman with a movie out this month, here\u2019s the one with the Instagram followers.\u2019 We don\u2019t do that, and I think that\u2019s how we\u2019ve survived.\u201d\n\nBrown has not been immune to the changes in the publishing industry. A year after she became editor, InStyle\u2019s owner, Time Inc, was bought out by Meredith, a midwestern company whose publications tended more to families than fashion.\n\nSince the purchase, Meredith has sold off four titles, including Time magazine. In 2016, Meredith closed InStyle UK\u2019s print edition; 18 months later, its website was shut down, too.\n\nMany believe that Brown is at the top of the list to replace US 'Vogue' editor Anna Wintour when the 69-year-old retires. AP\n\nThough it\u2019s in Brown\u2019s best interests to believe in her product, her advocacy for print is real. \u201cPrint is your billboard. It is your sense of occasion,\u201d she says. Vogue editor Diana Vreeland\u2019s motto was, \u201cThe eye has to travel.\u201d Brown\u2019s is, \u201cThe eye gets tired.\u201d Print is the queen, digital is the carriage it rides on.\n\nIt should be said, though, that Brown is also adept with video and social media. In fact, her former InStyle publisher Jess Cagle says Brown\u2019s ease with digital storytelling was one of the reasons she was hired.\n\nThere is a feeling that someday Brown might be up for the top job in fashion. Anna Wintour, now 69, has been editor-in-chief of US Vogue for more than 30 years, and there are rumours she will soon retire and that Brown \u2013 in many ways, the anti-Anna, with her warmth and playfulness \u2013 will take over.\n\nIt\u2019s testament to her Australian openness that she speaks on the record about this, even with an InStyle publicist in the room. \u201cLook,\u201d she says, \u201cI\u2019m flattered that anybody thinks I\u2019m up to the task of any big job. But the people in charge need to think of the person they really want.\n\n\u201cIf a job requires me to not be myself, I wouldn\u2019t take it. I just couldn\u2019t change, even if I wanted to.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNine of Laura Brown's favourite Instagram moments\n\nBrown is one of the most powerful people in fashion \u2013 and has the celeb pics to prove it.\n\n1. Cookie Monster & Elmo: \"One of the highlights of my career, nay, life. I\u2019ve worked with Sesame Street on and off for years but we did a special little film at InStyle to celebrate their 50th birthday this year. To turn up to work and see all of them, including Big Bird, sitting in my office was just heaven.\"\n\n2. Reese Witherspoon: \"Ah, Reese! She\u2019s incredible. If she wasn\u2019t an actress/producer/all around legend, she should be a life coach. I\u2019d do everything she says. This is after a cover shoot for Harper\u2019s BAZAAR a few years ago, giving our 'best time ever' laughs.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Helena Christensen: \"She came in for a meeting about shooting a portfolio for us. Helena is a great photographer, good friend, and we\u2019ve worked with her a lot at InStyle (because you may have noticed, she\u2019s quite attractive). Fun fact: when she cut her hair short 20 years ago, so did I. I did not look like her.\"\n\n4. Melissa McCarthy: \"She's one of the greats. Obviously she\u2019s hysterical, but she\u2019s also warm and decent and caring and grateful for all that she has. I originally met her through Bridesmaids and we\u2019d run into each other every few years. Now we\u2019re proper mates. This is at her shoot for the \u201cBadass Women\u201d cover of InStyle earlier this year. The prom pose was my idea \u2013 the plant, with label, hers. Obviously.\"\n\n5. Pierpaolo Piccioli: \"Pierpaolo is a force for good in this world. He has such respect and love for what he creates and who he creates it with. We met when he was running Valentino with Maria Grazia Chiuri, who has since left for Dior. Around the time he got the solo creative director position at Valentino, I was hired as editor-in chief of InStyle. As he always says to me, 'We jump together.'\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Oprah Winfrey: \"'I believe I can fly!' This picture is hilarious. Oprah is doing her Magnificent Self for our cover shoot last year and I look like a scrambling groupie. Which I am.\"\n\n7. Karl Lagerfeld: \"This makes me teary. We had a funny little relationship: he wasn\u2019t a fan of bullshit and I made him laugh. I really wanted him to live forever, but I\u2019m sure he\u2019s multitasking up there in heaven.\"\n\n8. Janet Jackson: \"I met Janet in 2009, a few months after her brother Michael\u2019s death. We struck up a friendship. You can\u2019t imagine what a life that is to live, but Janet is the sweetest, most vulnerable, and yet the most incredible force. I\u2019d do anything for her.\"\n\n9. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: \"This was kismet! I was doing a segment on Morning Joe the morning after Alexandria was elected to Congress, and ran into her in the make-up room. She was a little dazed, and totally lovely. How she\u2019s grown into her role in such a short time. I think she\u2019s magnificent.\"", "description": "'InStyle' editor Laura Brown is in charge of America's highest-selling fashion magazine and may soon become the most powerful person in fashion \u2013 full stop.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4645%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_574%2C$y_811/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/5ec726b57374e1dc97975143da214eae0e9aad1e", "published_at": "2019-05-21"}
