As the game went on he started to not feel so great.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals (82-66) won just one of three games against the first-place Braves in the weekend series.\n\nHale said he expects Martinez to be with the team when the Nationals begin a series on Monday night at the first-place St. Louis Cardinals.\n\n\u201cHopefully he is doing great,\u201d Nationals first baseman Howie Kendrick said. \u201cI love Davey.\u201d\n\nKendrick had three hits and drove in three runs in the win over Atlanta as starting pitcher Anibal Sanchez allowed just three hits and no runs and lowered his ERA to 3.86.\n\nMartinez is in his second season as the Washington manager. He was a bench coach for the Tampa Bay Rays and Chicago Cubs under Joe Maddon and became a manager for the first time in 2018 with the Nationals.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
