On the one hand, it stars a glowing Alice Marie Johnson, who was pardoned by President Trump last summer, after Kardashian West met with him at the White House on her behalf. At the time, Johnson faced life in prison with no possibility of parole for a first-time, nonviolent drug offense, and had already served 21 years behind bars. Now, she\u2019s free and doing what she wants \u2014 which includes modeling Kardashian West\u2019s \u201csculpting bodysuit.\u201d\n\nIn the video, Johnson describes, poignantly, what her newfound freedom feels like. She can wake up in the morning and not have a bunk bed over her head, she says. She can open the door whenever she wants to and walk outside and breathe fresh air. \u201cTo breathe in freedom, that is precious to me,\u201d she tells the camera.\n\nShapewear also makes her feel free, Johnson adds. \u201cThis shapewear makes me feel that I can walk into the store, I can pick up something that I normally wouldn\u2019t think about wearing and I can put it on, and it\u2019s going to look great on me.\u201d\n\nShapewear is already tricky to talk about \u2014 it literally binds us, and yet we all know it can make can make a woman feel better equipped to exist in a judgmental world. Personally, I feel more emotionally and physically secure when I wear Spanx under a form-fitting dress, or bike shorts to a workout class. But of course, I\u2019d probably feel even more secure if I didn\u2019t have to worry about what my body looked like at all. Kardashian West even went as far as trademarking SKIMS \u2014 which is designed to be \u201cinclusive\u201d for all body types and skin tones \u2014 as \u201csolutionwear,\u201d implying that there was a problem that needed solving.\n\nJia Tolentino explores the double bind of products like Spanx in her Trick Mirror essay, \u201cAlways Be Optimizing.\u201d She writes: \u201cWhen you are a woman, the things you like get used against you.\u201d What feels good can also often feel \u201cbrutally disempowering\u201d in the end.\n\nObviously, shapewear is nothing compared to the brutally disempowering experience of prison. Which is why Kardashian West\u2019s conflation of the two feels so jarring. It seems wrong for Kardashian West to use Johnson for her own financial gain, but it also seems patronizing to object to Johnson choosing to appear in the video, and likely profiting from it as well. Such is life under Kapitalism.", "description": "One year after President Trump commuted the sentence of Alice Marie Johnson at the behest of Kim Kardashian West, she was cast as a model for Kardashian West\u2019s new shapewear line, SKIMS. \u201cThis shapewear makes me feel free,\u201d she says.", "authors": ["Emilia Petrarca"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/08/30/30-alice-johnson.w1200.h630.jpg"}
