The good news is that the new Jurassic World film Battle at Big Rock is by far the best in the series, managing to be wholly original (unlike Jurassic World) without being aggressively, bonk-headedly stupid (unlike Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom). It\u2019s tight, it\u2019s tense, it\u2019s a perfect fat-free distillation of everything that\u2019s good about the Jurassic World franchise. However \u2013 and now for the bad news \u2013 it\u2019s only eight minutes long.\n\nCan shifting to a female-focused future overcome Terminator: Dark Fate's bad buzz? Read more\n\nFilmed in secret and released this weekend, Battle at Big Rock is an odd duck indeed. In Colin Trevorrow it has an authentically Jurassic World-appropriate director. In Andre Holland and Natalie Martinez it has a pair of convincingly big stars. It is staged, shot, lit and scored like a big budget feature. And yet \u2013 since it\u2019s too short to be a film and too long to be a DVD extra \u2013 it is assuredly a short in its own right. It\u2019s like a more confident, muscular, expensive version of the little One-Shot features that Marvel put out for a couple of years at the beginning of the decade.\n\nAnd it\u2019s pretty great. Following the end of the last film, dinosaurs live in the wild now. Holland and Martinez play a couple of campers out in a national park with their kids, and their visit is interrupted when a large herbivore trundles past. And then even more when an Allosaurus barges in and starts a fight. The campers watch, awestruck, from their window. And then the Allosaurus comes for them.\n\nThat\u2019s it. That\u2019s the whole film. It\u2019s essentially a Jurassic World set-piece that\u2019s been sliced up and presented alone. But three things make it stand out. First, unlike any of the dummies who ever blundered into Isla Nublar, the campers have no idea that the dinosaurs are coming, so their shock is at least genuine. Second, in its inventive use of a high chair and its distinctive framing of a roar it achieves a one-two punch of indelible series-best moments.\n\nAnd third, the mid-credit scenes are absolutely bonkers. Once the campers have been attacked (and saved by a very Jurassic Park precocious child), the action cuts away to some iPhone footage of a little girl on a ranch screaming in terror as she\u2019s trailed by a pack of tiny procompsognathuses. Then there\u2019s some dashcam footage of a car speeding out of a tunnel, swerving to avoid a stegosaurus and tumbling off a cliff. Some fisherman happen upon a parasaurolophus. A great white shark leaps out of the sea to catch a seal, which is in turn chased by a mosasaurus. A pair of newlyweds launch a dove into the air, and it\u2019s quickly gobbled up by a pterodactyl.\n\nThe credit clips are all tremendous fun to watch, suggesting that this universe is also home to some sort of hilarious dinosaur-based home video clip show series. And, given that Trevorrow has hinted that he wanted Battle at Big Rock to gesture towards the larger themes of Jurassic World 3, why not speculate even harder? Why not just out-and-out guess that the next film is going to be completely made up of clips like this?\n\nNow that humans and dinosaurs are forced to share the world, wouldn\u2019t you watch a found footage Jurassic World film? The series isn\u2019t shy about adopting new genres, as Fallen Kingdom\u2019s bizarre horror hybrid proved only too well. So why not go full Cloverfield? A film compiled from multiple sources, shot by a public terrified of their giant invaders might be incredible. It would certainly cut down on all the soggy, laborious character work that bogged down the last two instalments. If nothing else, there\u2019d be much less farting about with Chris Pratt and his pet raptors, so that\u2019s something.\n\nAs a genre, the found footage film has been running out of steam for years. But that\u2019s only because none of them had a bunch of tyrannosaurus rexes charging about the place gobbling people off toilets. If I\u2019m right, and Battle at Big Rock really is a backdoor pilot for a found footage film, it might be time to get excited about Jurassic World again.", "description": "In new short film Battle at Big Rock, a seat-edge set piece surpasses the two full-length dino-thrillers that came before it", "authors": ["Stuart Heritage"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b80631d77fab0183ac679458d0d3ad45ac9b1ec1/153_0_1047_628/master/1047.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4ec7cf04e9c74522cbb8abf7d33304bf", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
