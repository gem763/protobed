Who leads a temporary govt that will be in office for just a matter of days is not the key issue. What matters is getting this Tory government out, securing an extension and then having a General Election ASAP.'\n\nThe Labour source said work on an emergency motion - known as a standing order 24 (SO24) - to take control of Commons business had failed to gain the 'clarity' necessary to secure support of all parties.\n\nA successful SO24 could have seen Opposition parties take control of the order paper to strengthen legal guards against a no-deal Brexit. It is understood the 21 Conservative rebels, who were sacked from the party for voting to implement the no-deal blocking Benn Act, were not convinced by the measure.\n\n'In truth, the detail for it was not fully nailed down,' the Opposition source said. 'It was being pushed by the former Tory 21 but it was also pulled by them.\n\n'We will take their cue as to when they feel confident they have the numbers and feel able to deliver on the mooted SO24.'", "description": "The latest round of talks in Westminster ended in a stalemate as Jeremy Corbyn insisted he should get the keys to Downing Street if Boris Johnson is ousted in a confidence vote.", "authors": ["James Tapsfield", "Political Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/15/19399352-0-image-a-57_1570457857422.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
