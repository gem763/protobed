And I am not ready yet to give up fighting for the soul of the Conservative party.\u201d\n\nReferring to the EU withdrawal agreement bill, Hammond said it was the government that seemed to be blocking Brexit: \u201cLast Tuesday, parliament signalled very clearly that it was willing to progress this bill. It is the government that has blocked it.\n\n\u201cAnd the government should now stop blocking Brexit, allow parliament to get on with the Brexit bill and deliver Brexit by the end of November.\n\n\u201cThe idea that now we would use our precious time to halt all of this process for five or six weeks and go out and have a general election frankly appalls me.\n\n\u201cI think the government is trying to create a narrative that parliament is blocking Brexit and therefore we need an election. But that is simply untrue.\u201d", "description": "Former chancellor accuses government of blocking Brexit by pushing for poll", "authors": ["Staff", "John Crace"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a4eb16aeb270c31ed5991b43f4a847e0de4d02d/0_168_3030_1818/master/3030.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=322f6c35045b634e012d74e5bd78dfe2", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
