Did you attend a hospital and have you stomach pumped for evidence?\n\n\"Is this something you and your friends experience regularly? Would you like a crowd controller to hold your drink next time you attend a nightclub?\".\n\nHe allegedly goes on to write: \"Are you worth someone trying to spike your drink? We think this is a beat up and we believe that no one would be stupid enough to waste their drugs on spiking anyone's drink.\"\n\nThe response has gone viral, and the club\u2019s Facebook rating has plummeted to 1.1 stars out of 996 reviews.\n\nPolice have confirmed they are investigating, reports news.com.au .", "description": "Shantel Smith, 19, claimed her drink was spiked in the Rapture club in Perth, Australia - before the owner allegedly responded by asking if she was \"worth\" someone trying to spike her", "authors": ["Abigail O'Leary"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20532724.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_THP_CHP__4490JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
