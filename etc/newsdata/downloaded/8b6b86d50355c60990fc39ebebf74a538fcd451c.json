(Jay Janner/Austin American-Statesman/AP)\n\nA new Guttmacher Institute report released on Wednesday outlines dramatic changes in the abortion landscape between 2011 and 2017. The U.S. abortion rate hit an all-time low \u2014 again. An unprecedented wave of 400 bills imposing restrictions on the procedure were passed by states. And medical abortions, which involve taking pills instead of undergoing a surgical procedure, became widely available.\n\nThe 48-page research document, which is used by policymakers and activists on both sides of the debate, provides detailed information by state and region about how American women access abortion.\n\nThere appears to be no clear pattern between efforts to ban or restrict abortion and the continuing decline in abortion rates, which has been going on for nearly 40 years. The declines were seen across regions and in states that are more supportive of abortion rights as well as those that are more restrictive.\n\n\u201cAntiabortion activists are going to try to take credit for this decline, but the facts don\u2019t support their argument,\u201d Rachel Jones, principal research scientist for Guttmacher, which supports abortion rights, said in a call with reporters.\n\nThe report estimated the abortion rate in 2017, the most recent year studied, at 13.5 per 1,000 women ages 15 to 44. That compares with 14.6 in 2014 and 16.9 in 2011 and is the lowest rate since the U.S. Supreme Court legalized abortion through the landmark decision Roe v. Wade in 1973.\n\nIn total, 862,320 abortions took place in 2017 at health-care facilities. About 339,640, or about 39 percent, of those were medical abortions, which involve taking pills to induce miscarriage as opposed to traditional surgical abortion.\n\nGuttmacher said it was impossible to pinpoint exactly what factors are driving the declines but said there has been a decline in pregnancies as well as \u201cchanges around abortion attitudes and stigma, contraceptive use, sexual activity, infertility and self-managed abortion.\u201d Self-managed abortions are those that occur outside of health-care settings and might include the use of medication, herbs or other methods without the direct supervision of a medical professional.\n\nGuttmacher noted that 32 states enacted restrictions during that time period, such as waiting periods, parental consent for minors, and requirements that patients do ultrasounds first. But nearly every state had lower abortion rates regardless of whether the state had passed any laws related to abortion access. And some states with new restrictions saw their abortion rates go up.\n\nGuttmacher logged nearly 400 abortion restrictions passed by states from 2011 to 2017. Indiana \u2014 Vice President Pence\u2019s home state and the one in which he served as governor for four of those years \u2014 enacted the most, 37. Kansas was close behind with 31, and Arkansas with 29.\n\nMany of the new restrictions have never gone into effect or gone into effect temporarily due to court action. In April of this year, for example, the Kansas Supreme Court blocked a law that banned the most common procedure for second-trimester abortions. It was the first state to try to stop this technique. And in July, a federal judge in Arkansas temporarily blocked three new abortion restrictions including one that requires a physician performing an abortion to be board-certified, which would have likely resulted in the state\u2019s only clinic having to close.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court in May went in the other direction, upholding part of a law signed by Pence that requires fetal remains of an abortion to be buried or cremated.\n\nLike many health-care studies, the data is a few years behind and does not include the impact of this year\u2019s unprecedented state efforts to ban abortion at six weeks \u2014 even in some cases without exception for rape and incest. The 2017 information also predates many efforts by President Trump\u2019s administration, such as the changes to the Title X family planning program that prompted Planned Parenthood to refuse millions of dollars of funding from that source.\n\nThe Guttmacher report also provides a glimpse at how deep the divide has grown between states. Between 2011 and 2017, the number of clinics went up in the Northeast and West but declined in the Midwest and South.\n\nWhile every state in the United States is home to an abortion clinic, five \u2014 North Dakota, Kentucky, Mississippi, West Virginia and Kansas \u2014 have only one. In contrast, California has 161, the most in the nation; New York, 113; Florida, 65; and New Jersey, 41.\n\nThe change in abortion rates shows dramatic state-by-state variation. In Virginia, it fell 41.5 percent, for example, while it went up slightly in New Jersey and Washington, D.C.\n\nGuttmacher officials emphasized that while restrictions may not be impacting the overall numbers, they take a toll on individuals.\n\n\u201cAbortion restrictions are coercive and cruel by design and intended to impose a heavy financial and emotional toll,\u201d said Herminia Palacio, Guttmacher president and CEO.\n\nRead more:\n\nPatients face higher fees and longer waits after Planned Parenthood quits federal program\n\nAbortion support remains steady despite growing partisan divide, survey finds\n\nNew federally funded clinics emphasize abstinence, natural family planning: Obria focuses on a \u201ccouple\u201d \u2014 as opposed to a woman as an individual \u2014 and \u201cthe benefits of commitment and marriage.\u201d", "description": "Changes in contraceptive use, sexual activity and infertility, as well as a decline in pregnancies, may have played a role.", "authors": ["Ariana Eunjung Cha", "National Reporter", "September At Am", "Ariana Eunjung Cha Is A National Reporter.
