"title": "Suspect granted immunity in case of teen road death...", "language": "en", "text": "A suspect granted diplomatic immunity in the case of a teen killed in a road crash will not be returned to the UK, according to notes held by President Donald Trump.\n\nHarry Dunn, 19, died when his motorbike crashed into a car outside an RAF base on August 27.\n\nAfter addressing reporters on the case at the White House, a photograph has since emerged which showed a note held by Mr Trump that reads: \u201c(If raised) Note, as Secretary Pompeo told Foreign Secretary Raab, that the spouse of the US government employee will not return to the United Kingdom.\u201d\n\nSince the photograph has surfaced, Mr Dunn\u2019s mother Charlotte Charles has blasted the president, suggesting his approach to the case has been \u201cbeyond any realm of human thinking\u201d.\n\nThe suspect, 42-year-old Anne Sacoolas, reportedly married to a US intelligence official, was granted diplomatic immunity following the crash.\n\nThe car which crashed into Mr Dunn was thought to have been driving on the wrong side of the road after leaving RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire, a military base used by the US Air Force.\n\nThe teenager\u2019s family met with the Foreign Secretary on Wednesday but said they left the meeting feeling \u201cangry\u201d and \u201cdisappointed\u201d, with Ms Charles later saying it seemed like a \u201cpublicity stunt\u201d and that they felt \u201cpatronised\u201d by Dominic Raab.\n\nThe family of Harry Dunn, mother Charlotte Charles (left) and father Tim Dunn (right) with their partners, arrive at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London, where they met Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab (PA)\n\nMr Raab met Mr Dunn\u2019s mother and father Tim Dunn on Wednesday afternoon after having talks with US Ambassador Woody Johnson on Tuesday.\n\nIn a press conference on Wednesday, Mr Trump said wrong-way driving \u201chappens\u201d after being asked by Prime Minister Boris Johnson to reconsider granting immunity to Mrs Sacoolas.\n\nHis words were met with anger by Ms Charles, who said she was unhappy with the president\u2019s \u201cthrow-away comments\u201d.\n\nCharlotte Charles, the mother of Harry Dunn, speaking to the media after leaving the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London, where she met Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab (PA)\n\nSpeaking to Sky News about the photograph of notes held by Mr Trump which seemed to suggest Mrs Sacoolas would not be returning to the UK, Ms Charles said: \u201cI\u2019m just disgusted.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see the point in Boris Johnson talking to President Trump, or President Trump even taking a call from Boris Johnson.\n\n\u201cIf he\u2019d already made his decision that if it were to be asked and if it were to be raised, the answer was already going to be no.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just beyond any realm of any human thinking.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump has said wrong-way driving \"happens\u00b4 after being asked by Boris Johnson to reconsider granting immunity to an American woman suspected of being involved in the death of Mr Dunn (Northamptonshire Police/PA)\n\nMr Trump confirmed that his administration would seek to speak to the driver, after Number 10 said the Prime Minister had urged him to \u201creconsider\u201d in a phone call.\n\nNorthamptonshire Police have also asked the US to consider waiving the immunity.\n\nCommenting on what she would say to Mr Trump about the case, Mr Dunn\u2019s mother told Sky News: \u201cHe must know exactly where she is.\n\n\u201cHe must know where she, the kids, the husband are \u2013 whether they are being hidden or they\u2019ve just run away \u2013 one way or another he must know exactly where they are.\n\n\u201cI would obviously urge him to still put her on the plane to come back, face our justice system here, face us, talk to us, everything we have been saying for the past five days.\n\n\u201cWe will keep the pressure on \u2013 we still don\u2019t understand, none of us as a family, everyone around the world that keeps contacting us.\u201d\n\nAddressing how she felt after the meeting with Mr Raab on Wednesday, Ms Charles said: \u201cWe found it quite patronising, if I\u2019m totally honest.\n\n\u201cMyself and my husband were split up \u2013 Harry\u2019s dad Tim and his wife Tracey, we were all told where to sit.\n\n\u201cOur family spokesperson\u2026 was shut down by Dominic Raab when he tried to talk on our behalf when he could see that we struggling with our emotions.\n\n\u201cWe asked him to try and communicate with Anne Sacoolas directly, he said that he had had a message back from her\u2026 and that she was in some way shape or form upset.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember the words but they certainly weren\u2019t strong enough to show any real remorse.\u201d\n\nMs Charles continued: \u201cYou would hope, being a UK citizen, that they would be the ones to help us as much as possible.\n\n\u201cWith Donald Trump saying yesterday that every driver has driven on the wrong side of the road at some point \u2013 perhaps they have.\n\n\u201cBut not every driver has travelled the distance that Anne Sacoolas did and taken the life of a 19-year-old who was completely and utterly innocent.\n\n\u201cSo to us, although it\u2019s a personal issue for us, it is more of a unique case than just having accidentally driven on the wrong side of the road so I\u2019m not very happy about those throw-away comments.\u201d", "description": "Harry Dunn was
