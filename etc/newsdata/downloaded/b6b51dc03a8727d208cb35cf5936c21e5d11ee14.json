And it\u2019s not every day that you can come to Vulture Festival to see the people behind your favorite piece of trash toy live and in-person, but that is completely and totally what\u2019s happening. That right, we\u2019re bringing the team behind Forky to the Hollywood Roosevelt to share with us exactly what makes this li\u2019l guy just so dang special. Veep\u2019s Tony Hale, who gives Forky\u2019s neurosis and love of trash a voice, will be sitting down for a chat with Toy Story 4 animator Claudio de Oliveira to talk about taking a simple plastic fork from trash to treasure to cinema to series. As an added bonus, they\u2019ll also be giving us a special screening of two brand-new shorts from the upcoming Disney+ series Forky Asks a Question ahead of the show\u2019s official premiere. So if you consider yourself a Disney fan, a Forky fan, or you just want to impress your friends and/or children with your in-depth knowledge of everything Forky, you won\u2019t want to miss it.\n\nAnd we\u2019d be total jerks if we didn\u2019t also mention, completely casually, that we\u2019re also reuniting the cast of Party Down, *and* the cast of Community, *and* playing games with couples from The Bachelor Cinematic Universe, *and* getting a sneak peak at the end of The Man in the High Castle, *and* [gasps for air] you get the idea.
