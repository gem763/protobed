Thanks. The breaking new report about a whistle-blower who reported a troubling promise president trump may have made to a foreign leader. \"The Washington post\" broke the story about the complaint which is being blocked from congress. Our chief justice correspondent Pierre Thomas with what we know right now. Good morning, Pierre. Reporter: George, good morning. A potential constitutional showdown is escalating with the chairman of the house intelligence committee demanding to know more about a trump administration whistle-blower and reporting from \"The Washington post\" that the paper claims points to the president. This morning, \"The Washington post\" reporting that the genesis of a whistle-blower's complaint allegedly involves the president promising something to a foreign leader that left the trump administration official unnerved and deeply concerned. \"The post\" citing two unnamed former administration officials claims the whistle-blower was so alarmed he took his concerns to the inspector general of the office of director of national intelligence. All of this stems from a complaint that a member of the U.S. Intelligence community filed with the inspector general on August 12th. If you look at the weeks leading up to that complaint, president trump had spoken to or had conversations with about five foreign leaders. Most notably among them was Vladimir Putin. Reporter: ABC news is not confirming \"The post\" reporting but have obtained a series of letters between the office of national intelligence and congress which confirms the inspector general deemed the whistle-blower's complaint, quote, of urgent concern. One that might require notification of congress. But those letters show the director of national intelligence after consulting with the justice department disagreed that the matter was urgent and concluded his agency was under no obligation to forward the matter to congress. This has left house intelligence chairman Adam Schiff outraged demanding answers and suggesting a cover-up. It is the president of the United States who was at the center of this significant showdown between congress and U.S. Intelligence community. Reporter: In a letter obtained by ABC news Schiff tells Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence that he can only conclude, quote, that the serious misconduct at issue involves the president of the United States or senior white house or administration officials. Schiff goes on to say he has grave concerns that the administration is engaged in, quote, an unlawful effort to protect the president, George. And, Pierre, \"The Washington post\" is also reporting that the director of national intelligence is uncomfortable to be caught in the middle between the intelligence committee and the justice department who is blocking this right now. Meantime, this, is moving very quickly. The inspector general is actually going to appear before the intelligence committee this morning. Reporter: He will. We don't know what he will be allowed to say or what he will say. But I can tell you this, it's escalating, George with Schiff promising a subpoena if he can't get answers. Pierre, thanks very much.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "description": "The complaint from the unnamed whistleblower about a troubling promise President Trump may have made to a foreign leader is being blocked from Congress.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/190919_gma_thomas_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
