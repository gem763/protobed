The plan is being rolled\n\nout across England and Wales\n\nfollowing trials.\n\nJustice Secretary Robert Buckland said: \u201cWe know these offenders generally have multiple and complex needs linked to their offending behaviour, in particular drugs, alcohol and mental health needs.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\u201cIf we are to break the cycle of reoffending, solutions will often lie in community sentences.\u201d\n\nIt comes after US-style booze tags were announced as ministers target binge drinkers blamed for half of the mayhem on streets at weekends.\n\nThe bracelets sample sweat every 30 minutes to test for alcohol use. The information is sent to police and probation officers.\n\nEvidence suggests the \u00a322million four-year scheme will cut drink-driving and domestic abuse.\n\nMr Buckland said: \u201cThe evidence showed they had a marked effect on reoffending.
