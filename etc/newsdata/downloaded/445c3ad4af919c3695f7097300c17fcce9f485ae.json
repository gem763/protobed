Check. Encouraging innovation so the free market to flourish? Check. Increasing transparency and improving accountability? Check and check.\n\nPerhaps nowhere are President Trump\u2019s reform accomplishments more on display than at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), now headed by Trump\u2019s nominee Chairman Ajit Pai. The FCC has been leading the way in implementing reforms that protect consumers and lessen the burdens created by Obama\u2019s heavy-handed government regulations.\n\nJust over a year ago, Chairman Pai oversaw the FCC\u2019s reversal of \u201cnet neutrality,\u201d the Obama-era regulations of the Internet. Since that reversal, the Internet has become more affordable and faster, helping to bridge the so-called \u201cdigital divide.\u201d The digital divide describes the disparity in Internet access between more affluent Americans and underserved populations, especially in rural areas. Bringing greater Internet access to those underserved Americans has been a special passion for Pai, and his work here has paid off.\n\n\n\nThe FCC recently produced a report on broadband usage around the country. The report shows broadband access in each state. The results of the report show that Internet speeds in the United States are up nearly 40%, reaching an all-time high. Repealing the Obama policy of net neutrality is the underlying reason for this positive development. Net neutrality was responsible for an astonishing decline in broadband Internet access in the United States from 2016 to 2017 (from 26.1 million with access in 2016 to only 21.3 million with access in 2017).\n\nA stark contrast exists between Obama\u2019s net neutrality results (fewer Americans with broadband access) and the success of Ajit Pai\u2019s free market plan for the Internet (with rising numbers of Americans enjoying broadband). Pai\u2019s repeal of net neutrality serves as a case study for the power for the free market and competition to lower prices and increase access to services and products. Americans should remember that the free market here has reversed the government\u2019s embarrassing record of choking out access to broadband \u2013 especially in rural communities.\n\nAnother area where Chairman Pai has implemented positive reforms is in changing the culture at the FCC and making transparency of the agency\u2019s work a mainstay. Just after assuming the position of chair, Pai initiated a pilot program to provide public access to the documents for discussion at the FCC\u2019s open meetings at least 21 days ahead of the vote.\n\nThis effort was so popular, in fact, that Illinois Congressman Adam Kinzinger introduced a bill in 2018 to make the Pai transparency reforms permanent, so Americans going forward, even after President Trump is no longer in office, would be able to review FCC documents for the same 21-day period Pai has already instituted.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission may seem an unlikely place to improve health care in our nation, but thanks to Pai\u2019s leadership in telemedicine, that is exactly what has transpired.\n\nChairman Pai\u2019s own father was a urologist serving in rural Kansas when Pai was growing up. He saw firsthand the need for medical specialists serving in rural parts of the country, and that need has only grown as it has become increasingly difficult to recruit doctors to serve in rural communities.\n\nInfluenced by his father\u2019s example, Pai has begun working to make sure the FCC is addressing the broadband needs of telemedicine so Americans living in the most remote parts of the country will be able to enjoy the same high quality of health care as those in large cities.\n\nWith his emphasis on deregulation, transparency, and innovation, Ajit Pai has become a thought leader in government reform that will propel our economy in the 21st century.\n\nA central component of President Trump\u2019s Make America Great Again platform is that government must scale back its onerous regulations so innovation and enterprise can thrive. Chairman Pai\u2019s reforms that have led to better and faster Internet and a more robust telemedicine sector are proof that the president\u2019s approach is best. The FCC reforms can serve as an example for other agency heads who hope to usher in an era of better government.", "description": "President Trump\u2019s record over the past two-and-a-half years he has .09/03/2019 19:40:15PM EST.", "authors": ["Jenny", "Beth Martin", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/100/457ecd89-0a09-4757-95d6-2ff1c70f6e9e.png"}
