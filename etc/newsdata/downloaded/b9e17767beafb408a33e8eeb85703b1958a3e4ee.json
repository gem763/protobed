For Russia, there is a strategic play at hand.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Kremlin hopes the small cadre of workers tucked away in Abkhazia will help win some more goodwill with Kim Jong Un\u2019s regime as Moscow tries to strengthen its influence in Asia, analysts say.\n\nAround 400 North Koreans \u2014 all men and most with wives and families back home to support \u2014 have been relocated to this subtropical strip of land, with many in the main city, Sukhumi. Their nights are spent in an abandoned Soviet holiday resort, surrounded by date palms and decaying mosaics of Lenin.\n\nGhost towns and sunseekers\n\nBy day they are building apartment blocks and pharmacies and laying railway tracks in a region still pockmarked by the secessionist conflict of the early 1990s when Abkhazia, backed by Moscow, broke away from Georgia.\n\nAD\n\nAbkhazia is part of a constellation of separatist enclaves stretching across the former Soviet domain, from a breakaway slice of Moldova in the west to Black Sea quasi-states in the east. For Russia, they are footholds to bypass international norms and sanctions, and even provide an off-the-grid financial system. The breakaway states are recognized by only a handful of pro-Russian countries such as Venezuela and Syria.\n\nAD\n\nAbout 10,000 North Korean workers remain in Russia \u2014 down from a high of about 40,000 \u2014 and Moscow has promised to send them home by a Dec. 22 deadline.\n\nThe 400 North Korean workers in Abkhazia are just a blip among what was once about 100,000 worldwide, sending home $500 million each year in remittance, according to U.S. estimates. But it is Moscow\u2019s way of keeping a lifeline open for Pyongyang, analysts say.\n\nRussia\u2019s Foreign Ministry \u201cscrupulously fulfills the obligations stipulated by the international sanctions regime,\u201d spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told The Washington Post. \u201cAs for the hiring of migrant workers from North Korea in Abkhazia, it is advisable to address this issue to the relevant state or their employers.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOnce the playground of the Soviet elite, Abkhazia is now scattered with ghost towns and bombed-out buildings. But with lush scenery and cheap beach holidays, the region is sustained by more than 1 million tourists a year, mostly Russian.\n\nAD\n\nMany are drawn by a nostalgic allure for yesteryear, visiting Soviet-era resorts that feel frozen in time. The irony of having guest workers from a communist state is not lost on the locals.\n\nOn a balmy September morning, a North Korean man who goes by \u201cDr. Kim\u201d was massaging Russian senior citizens in a little hut on the beach, for $7 a session.\n\n\u201cI feel like the bust of Lenin cheers [Dr. Kim] up,\u201d said his employer, Zurab Zukhba, manager of the \u201cLand of the Soul\u201d high-rise resort. \u201cHe recognized him.\u201d\n\n'Hard to replace'\n\nWhile Abkhazia likes to present itself as an independent republic, that is far from the reality. A quick stroll through central Sukhumi, where the newly built, sprawling Russian Embassy twinkles in the sun, shows who has sway over Abkhazia\u2019s affairs.\n\nAD\n\nRussia, particularly its underdeveloped Far East, is feeling the pinch of the sanctions and the loss of North Korean labor.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe approaching exodus is pretty painful for us,\u201d said Artyom Lukin, a professor of international politics at the Far Eastern Federal University in Vladivostok, near the Russian border with North Korea. \u201cI\u2019m already seeing idle construction sites. They will be hard to replace.\u201d\n\nOf the 1,000 North Korean laborers once employed by contractor Yuri Dyakov in Russia\u2019s Far Eastern region of Sakhalin, only 120 remain. Over the past two years, about 90 have left for Abkhazia, where Dyakov helped them find construction work.\n\n\u201cI feel sorry for them,\u201d said Dyakov, who heads the Sakhalin branch of Pillar of Russia, a nongovernmental business association. \u201cIt\u2019s not right to suddenly get rid of your friends because of these sanctions.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nEarlier this year, President Vladi\u00admir Putin welcomed North Korean leader Kim to Russia for his inaugural visit, a meeting designed by both to send Washington the message that there are other players when it comes to dealing with denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nAD\n\nBut in recent months, tensions have cropped up between Russia and cash-strapped North Korea.\n\n'Makes perfect sense'\n\nThousands of North Korean boats have been illegally fishing for squid in Russia\u2019s Pacific waters, even resulting in a fatal exchange of gunfire and the summoning in September of Pyongyang\u2019s charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires, Chin Jeong Hyup, to the foreign ministry in Moscow. After a North Korean vessel opened fire in September on a Russian patrol boat, injuring three guards, the Russians returned fire, killing a North Korean fisherman.\n\nAD\n\nMoscow is unlikely to abandon its former Cold War ally, however.\n\n\u201cIt makes perfect sense for the Russian government to try [to] facilitate economic ties between North Korea and Abkhazia. One is a rogue state, and the other is entirely dependent on handouts from Moscow,\u201d said Alex Melikishvili, principal research analyst at IHS Markit.\n\nAD\n\nOnce Moscow recognized Abkhazia as independent in 2008, cash from Russia flooded in. The United Nations and Western nations still see Abkhazia as part of Georgia.\n\nAbkhazia is also keen to develop economic ties with other Russia-connected states shunned on the global arena, such as Syria and the Moscow-backed breakaway regions of eastern Ukraine.\n\nAD\n\nBut with North Korea, officials in Abkhazia claim Pyongyang came to them.\n\n\u201cThey approached us with an offer of manual labor,\u201d said Tamila Mertskhulava, head of Abkhazia\u2019s chamber of commerce and industry, who visited Pyongyang last year. \u201cThis is what they can export.\u201d\n\nA few months after she was invited to Pyongyang, a group of North Korean officials visited Abkhazia, where they sampled the local wine, kiwis and mandarin oranges.\n\nTheir favorite part of the trip? Touring the summer residence of Joseph Stalin.\n\nAD", "description": "U.N. sanctions say all North Korean guest workers must be sent home.
