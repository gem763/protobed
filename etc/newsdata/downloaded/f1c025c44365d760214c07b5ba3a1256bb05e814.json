The male dogs needed to wear a little diaper thing to prevent them from peeing in the house and marking their territories. The first time I met them, I made the mistake of saying, \u2018Oh look, they are wearing diapers!\u2019 The owners were so offended\u2014\u2018They are not diapers, they are pee-pads.\u2019\n\nThere wasn\u2019t a lot of carpet in that house.\n\nFor every showing, they\u2019d have to roust up seven dogs, put on the pee-pads. Sometimes they\u2019d be late getting out of the house, and my clients would be standing there seeing the sellers shuffle the dogs out two by two into the van in 95-degree weather.\n\nTami Halton Pardee\n\nfounder/CEO of Halton Pardee + Partners\n\nLos Angeles, Calif.\n\n\n\nThe house was in Culver City\u2014a nice modern house priced a little under $2 million. I went over, nicely dressed\u2014you dress up when you are going over to meet a client\u2014and they had this pet pig. It was huge; it must have been 200 pounds. And it had wiry hair. It was one of those potbellied pigs, it must have been small when they bought it. My grandparents were farmers; they had pigs. I actually really like pigs\u2014on a farm. Not pigs in a house.\n\nIllustration: Boyoun Kim\n\nIt was bizarre. I was sitting there and the pig was right next to me. You have to act like everything is normal, but it was just weird. Everything had a pig stench to it, like a barn. Everything was dirty, like if you were going to a farm and saw floors covered with dirt and hay. The pig had full access to the house\u2014well, the first floor. I don\u2019t think it could get up the stairs.\n\nI said, \u201cWe have to clean this up. Could the pig go stay with a relative?\u201d\n\nThey said, \u201cNo, we want the pig to stay here.\u201d They even wanted to put the pig in pictures of the house; they said it would make it unique.\n\nI said, \u201cWe\u2019re not selling the pig, we\u2019re selling the house.\u201d They seemed not to get it.\n\nI went home and showered after that. I don\u2019t think they ever sold their house. I think they took it off the market. They just really loved their pig.\n\nLauren Krawczyk\n\nRealtor associate at Douglas Elliman\n\nSt. Petersburg, Fla.\n\n\n\nIt was a very large waterfront property, a nice expensive home, and the dog was there for the showing. We always tell people to take their dogs with them, but it can\u2019t always be helped. The owner had dog-sitter issues. To alleviate stress, I said I\u2019d take care of it.\n\nIt was a goldendoodle. He was a really sweet, excitable, overly friendly dog.\n\nSo I had the dog on a leash with me, actually walking him through the house during the showing. You don\u2019t know\u2014sometimes the buyers walk in and they could be afraid of dogs. And God forbid the dog has dirt on his paws and jumps on someone.\n\nIt got kind of distracting, so I thought, \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll put the dog in the backyard for a bit.\u201d It was nice outside. I didn\u2019t realize the gate was open.\n\nWe [the clients and I] were wandering around the house for 30 minutes, and then the doorbell rings. One of the neighbors had found the dog running through the neighborhood on a main road. I was mortified. The dog got inside, very excited, and peed on the very nice Restoration Hardware couch. Fortunately, the people were leaving; it was the end of the showing. I just ran and got any cleaning supplies I could. I\u2019ve never sweated so much in my life.\n\n\u2014Edited from interviews", "description": "Agents recall trying to sell homes where dogs and even a potbellied pig ruled the roost.", "authors": ["Amy Gamerman"], "top_image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-EX652_TRENCH_SOC_20190909121848.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
