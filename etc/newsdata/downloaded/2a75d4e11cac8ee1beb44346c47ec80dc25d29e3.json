No team have ever won the tournament having been defeated in the group stage but Erasmus, their head coach, believes they can make history.\n\nSouth Africa to face England in Rugby World Cup final after beating Wales Read more\n\n\u201cWe have played England four times in the last 18 months and the score is 2-2,\u201d the South Africa head coach said. \u201cWe are accustomed to the way they play and we think we are in with a chance. They are much better than when we last faced them in November, and you could see that in the way they dismantled New Zealand, but I am not sure it will be a final won through an expansive gameplan and wonderful tries.\n\n\u201cWe know that there are areas of our game we will need to improve on to win, and we have a six-day turnaround. We are used to a team that has a fast running game because we play New Zealand regularly, but we are still at the stage where we need to be able to adapt.\u201d\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s improvement under Erasmus, who took over at the beginning of last year, has been marked and they won the Rugby Championship this year. They won the Test series against England last year, coming from a long way behind in the opening two Tests.\n\n\u201cWe have always had the potential to be a force in world rugby,\u201d Erasmus said. \u201cWhat the players have done in the last couple of years is take ownership of what it means to be a professional rugby player. There was a stage when it was just about earning a pay cheque, but they now understand they have to work really hard.\n\nPlay Video 1:02 South Africa fans celebrate Rugby World Cup semi-final victory over Wales \u2013 video\n\n\u201cThe level of mediocrity is going out of our rugby and we are slowly moving to being able to maximise our potential. What was pleasing about the victory over Wales was that the players stuck to their guns and learned from past defeats to them. It was not a spectacle, but we knew it would not be.\u201d\n\nSouth Africa kicked the ball twice for every three times they passed it, refusing to be drawn into attacking from their own half.\n\nAttritional Springboks show there is more than one way to World Cup final | Gerard Meagher Read more\n\n\u201cThe one area we need to improve is our discipline because we gave away too many penalties,\u201d the scrum-half Faf de Klerk said. \u201cIf we keep the count down against England and don\u2019t give them too many entries in our 22, it is going to fall in our favour. We appreciate how well they played against New Zealand, but we also know what to expect from them.\n\n\u201cWe tend to have close games against them and we will be putting in plans to counter their systems. They have smart players and we will need to be smart.\u201d\n\nGatland had hoped his final match in charge of the Wales side after 12 years would be the final, but the head coach has to lift his players for the bronze play-off against New Zealand in Tokyo on Friday. The prop Tomas Francis has been ruled out with a shoulder injury and the wing George North has a hamstring strain.\n\nPlay Video 0:51 'South Africa deserved to win': Wales' Gatland accepts World Cup defeat \u2013 video\n\n\u201cMy first game with Wales was against England and my dream was that it would be my last, but it is not to be,\u201d said Gatland. \u201cFriday will be our last time together so we must make sure that we enjoy ourselves. We knew it would be an arm-wrestle against South Africa and there was not a lot of flowing rugby played, but I am proud of the boys for staying in there.\n\n\u201cEngland were outstanding against New Zealand, but South Africa have the physicality to match them. My last game [in charge of Wales] will not be the final, but it will still be a monumental match because they are the only team I have not beaten, apart from the Lions. It will be a tough game to play, but we will give it the respect it deserves.\u201d", "description": "South Africa\u2019s head coach, Rassie Erasmus, said his team would not be taken by surprise by England in the Rugby World Cup final after they beat Wales 19-16 in the semi-finals", "authors": ["Paul Rees"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4aaf2b21767669363790653de938aa715bc724e/0_403_3287_1972/master/3287.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=524c400e45db459a244fa2ad329f6dfa", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
