The state pension age is now gradually increasing for both until it reaches the age of 68. Further rises are expected in the coming decades as increased longevity takes its toll on a state system that is already feeling the funding strain.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

They had called on the government to pay back the difference in the retirement income they had expected, which could have totalled \u00a340,000 per person. But the High Court this week ruled that the rise was not discriminatory.\n\nDown but not out\n\nJon Greer, head of retirement policy at Quilter: says \u201cIt had been claimed that if the equalisation of state pension ages between men and women were to be reversed it could cost the government in excess of \u00a3180bn, so from their perspective they will be very relieved, particularly given current concerns about state pension funding as it is.\n\n\u201cThe review made note that the government acted in a lawful way, so it is inevitable that this decision will result in more political pressure placed upon the government to implement a change. Before coming to power, the prime minister did indicate it was an issue he was keen to sort out. As such, with a general election around the corner and the issue not going away anytime soon, this could become a key battleground to attract votes from a disaffected demographic.\n\nWake up call\n\nBut regardless of whether Boris Johnson will deliver on his promises to assist these women \u2013 made during his campaign to secure No 10 this summer \u2013 the blow piles further pressure on a huge financial problem facing women in old age.\n\nWith worrying numbers of people of both sexes assuming the state will provide their income in old age, further retirement age changes, tax tweaks and other legislative tinkering will continue to peel away layers of financial security at a time when women don\u2019t have enough to start with.\n\nWorld Economic Forum data released earlier this year reveals that Britons, in general, have an average of only 8.5 years\u2019 worth of retirement saving. Men will outlast their funds by more than 10 years and women by almost 13 years, based on average savings at the point of retirement and assuming an income of 70 per cent of their pre-retirement salary.\n\n\u201cOur research shows that women are already at a disadvantage when it comes to investing during their working lifetime and in retirement, with 62 per cent of women in the UK saying they have never invested their savings and only 50 per cent have invested in a personal pension,\u201d says Janine Menasakanian, head of distribution strategy, personal investing at Legal & General Investment Management.\n\n\u201cThis is further capitulated because of an increase in women going into self-employment and not being auto-enrolled into their employer\u2019s pension. In fact, depending on exactly what data you trust, just 10-20 per cent of all those freelancing in the UK currently pay into a pension scheme.\n\n\u201cHowever, these issues are not limited to women \u2013 many people in the UK are ill-equipped for when they reach retirement age. All investors \u2013 but especially those in their 40s, who are getting close to the end of their career need to be thinking about how they will plug their personal pension savings gap, for a secure future.\u201d\n\nIndustry consensus is that workers should set aside roughly 12-15 per cent of their salary for retirement over their working lives, taking into account the state pension and the workplace pension scheme. The exact details will depend on your individual circumstances and the later you start saving, the higher the proportion you\u2019ll need to set aside.\n\nCalculators such as this one from the Money Advice Service provide a good basic starting point.", "description": "Campaigners, including high profile politicians, have vowed to fight on after losing a High Court battle against the government for the way it handled recent increases to the state pension age for women.\u00a0 Millions of women have been affected by changes in the age that they start to receive their state pension made to balance the point that both sexes receive state support for", "authors": ["Kate Hughes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/03/11/waspi-women-royal-courts-of-justice.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
