Shares\n\nThe four noisy horseladies of the Apocalypse Any man who makes it to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue is a smart guy, by definition. Climbing a greasy pole is impossible, as anyone who has tried it will tell you, and the presidency is the greasiest pole anywhere. Shares\n\nPity the professor adrift in the world of politics There's all kind of reasons why Elizabeth Warren probably won't be president, and Claire McCaskill, her former colleague in the U.S. Senate, thinks she knows the reason why. Mrs. Warren, says Mrs. McCaskill, struggles with being \"in command of policy\" and still being \"relatable.\" Shares\n\nThe lynching of the only Democratic hope Joe Biden got it right, it's just that he said it in the wrong country. In Joe's country, getting it right is wrong, and the unwary pay for it. In Joe's country, a sucker never gets an even break, and everybody's a sucker. Shares\n\nHow the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals protected 5th Amendment with Purdue assault decision One swallow does not a summer make, Aristotle reminded us, but he might have added that with an arrogant crow, a robin or two, a mockingbird and a flock of sparrows, pretty soon you have the makings of a chorus. Shares\n\nThe Trump-Kim flattery of convenience Flattery, so the saying goes, will get you everywhere. This is wisdom usually employed by lovers, but Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un are trying to see whether it will work in statecraft. The stakes, like the risks, are large. Shares\n\nThe noisy parade of the debutantes The Democratic debates, so called, didn't accomplish much, but they might have struck a blow for valium. Valium is the calm-down pill that we should put in the water. Shares\n\nHere come the Democratic nobles on parade The legion of Democrats who think they can take the measure of Donald Trump will go at it beginning Wednesday night, each trying to figure out a way to stand out in a crowd of mediocrities. Shares\n\nNewspapers need to stop whining, restore trust with public Newspapers are feeling under the gun. People don't want to pay for what they're selling. The sweet aroma of paper and ink, the bang and clatter of hundreds of typewriters that evaporated in the clouds of tobacco smoke that once made newsrooms dark and mysterious cave-like places, the thunder of rows of printing presses, must give way to timid tapping on plastic keyboards. The newspaper game is up. Shares\n\nNot quite a return of 'The Gong Show' The Democrats are finally tuning up for the party's first presidential primary debates next week, and so far the only topics they can be expected to \"debate\" is who hates Donald Trump the most and who loves socialism the most. Nothing much to debate there. Shares\n\nImpossible dreaming with the impossible Bernie There's no fool like an old fool, but Bernie Sanders deserves credit for not backing away from his foolishness. In for a penny, in for a pound. Shares\n\nWhy the deal with Mexico is a good one It's not easy being a Democrat, and it's even more difficult to be a leader in the party, a speaker of the House or the leader of the minority in the Senate. It's true that hard times can make a monkey eat red pepper, as the ancient wisdom goes, but Democratic hard times are encouraging a rare run on red pepper. Shares\n\nPomp, fakery, shock, rage, and crisis averted Another crisis lies behind us. The New York Times had reported that Donald Trump was, all by himself, plotting to destroy the Special Relationship with Britain, and The Washington Post reported unidentified troop movements near Yorktown, believed to be remnants of the British army surrendered by Gen. Cornwallis, marching on the capital to avenge Mr. Trump's various insults in London. Shares\n\nWho will answer when a nation calls for greatness Nations are raised to greatness through the virtues of great men, as Edmund Burke observed, and Britain could once call on the likes of Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher when the hour of greatest peril arrived. Shares\n\nRobert Mueller just wants to feel the love again Robert Mueller just wants to feel the love again. His press clippings have faded and life hasn't been the same for the man choking on rectitude and righteousness, not since he turned in his account of the vain pursuit of Donald Trump and the Russians. After more than two years trying to find the president in bed with Vladimir Putin, he didn't even find the bed. Shares\n\nAnother colluder with Russia called to account Julian Assange continues to be a pain in sensitive places, from the neck to the unmentionable nether regions. Mr. Assange is clearly in serious legal trouble. The charges against him, contained in a 17-count indictment that says he \"received and published\" classified intelligence, are \"jail-y,\" and probably for a long time. Shares\n\nTheresa May 'dead in the water' for weeks The lady is clearly in distress, and no one's there to help her. Only a churl would say, even if true, Theresa May brought it on herself. Shares\n\nJoe Biden's rumble in the jungle of empty rhetoric Pity good ol' Joe Biden. He's eager at last to master the hounds, to impose order in the kennel. He wants to encourage the amiable golden retrievers, collies and cocker spaniels in his care, and he has to throw a little raw meat to the rabid pit bulls. How can he do that and escape with his life, too? Shares\n\nThe most important 44 words in the Constitution The First Amendment to the Constitution, the most important 44 words in that priceless and precious promise of liberty and freedom, does not guarantee civil, wise or even responsible speech. It guarantees free speech, however goofy, dumb or even irresponsible.
