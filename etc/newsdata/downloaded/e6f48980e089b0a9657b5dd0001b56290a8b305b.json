They arguably live in the greatest time ever, with unparalleled access to information, connectivity around the globe, advances in health care and tremendous opportunity. But instead of embracing optimism, the adults in their lives are filling them with fear.\n\nIn the last few weeks, from town halls on climate change to \u201cclimate justice\u201d marches, I have seen scores of children \u2013 some teens, some squarely of elementary school-age \u2013 proclaim their anxiety about the world ending.\n\nDepending on the source, children are being told that if we don\u2019t act right now to solve one particular \u201ccrisis\u201d or another, we will all be dead in anywhere from 18 months to 12 years. That\u2019s not a message of hope and optimism that kids should be embracing.\n\n'RUN FOR AMERICA' CO-FOUNDER BACKS CLIMATE STRIKE: WE ARE DEALING WITH A 'CRISIS'\n\nWhile it is great for children to learn to be responsible global citizens and take care of our planet, there\u2019s a positive and responsible way to communicate that.\n\nI recall in my own childhood celebrating Earth Day, where we raised money to help plant more trees (something that actually helps the environment, by the way) and learned about recycling, all without having the living daylights scared out of us.\n\nAdults can deliver the message of taking care of the planet and have an impact doing so with positive language and outcomes instead of nihilistic ones.\n\nWhile I am not a psychologist (and I don\u2019t play one on TV, either), I do believe that for kids, who are developing mentally, having this fear communicated to them during this critical time of their lives is abusive. Worse, it is done by parents, schools, the media and politicians alike. Everyone needs to immediately get a grip.\n\nI remember when adults acted like adults instead of fear-mongers. Back in the 80s, when network television ran the nuclear war movie \u201cThe Day After,\u201d there were warnings that it wasn\u2019t appropriate for children and our parents wouldn\u2019t let us watch it.\n\nNow, the adults who are supposed to be shielding kids from unlikely doomsday scenarios are forcing those beliefs upon them and using the kids as political pawns.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the climate change fear. I am not the first one to note that school shooter drills are also an unnecessary form of fear theater that does far more harm than good.\n\nWhile any school shooting is one too many and more needs to be done to ensure school safety, planting the security threat in kids\u2019 heads with practice drills surely creates needless trauma with no evidence of better outcomes.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nNegativity is all around us, from mainstream media to social media. It\u2019s not healthy for us to be constantly consuming a negative information diet, particularly when the general outlook for life is so robust. We need more gratitude towards the abundance, opportunities and advancements that surround us.\n\nAs an adult, if you want to mire yourself in pessimism, that\u2019s your choice. But please, leave the kids out of it.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY CAROL ROTH", "description": "In the last few weeks, from town halls on climate change to \u201cclimate justice\u201d marches, I have seen scores of children \u2013 some teens, some squarely of elementary school age \u2013 proclaim their anxiety about the world ending.", "authors": ["Carol Roth", "Carol Roth Is The Creator Of The"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/21/694940094001_6088374026001_6088384702001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
