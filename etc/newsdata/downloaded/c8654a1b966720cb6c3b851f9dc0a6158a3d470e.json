We agree with the Army Families Federation that the current situation is immoral.\u201d", "description": "The MoD has been accused of being \"immoral and incompetent\" as MPs say it is failing to uphold the Armed Forces covenant.", "authors": ["Dominic Nicholls", "Defence", "Security Correspondent", "Janet Daley", "Juliet Samuel", "Michael Deacon", "Sarah Champion"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/09/24/TELEMMGLPICT000177679872-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqek9vKm18v_rkIPH9w2GMNoGXySPv9M1Jbe0Fc3Bi1Fk.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
