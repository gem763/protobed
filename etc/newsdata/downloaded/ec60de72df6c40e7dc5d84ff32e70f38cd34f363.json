Something about an LNG [liquefied natural gas] plant.\u201d The move has largely been perceived as a scapegoating effort, as text messages between Trump-administration officials to a Zelenksy aide do not mention Perry and make clear that Giuliani was the primary motivator for the call. The Energy Department issued a statement on Sunday claiming that Perry encouraged Trump to make the call, but in the hopes of securing \u201cenergy security and economic development.\u201d\n\nThe subpoena requires Perry to forfeit all documents related to the Energy Department\u2019s role in the July 25 call, as well as all evidence of \u201call meetings or discussions\u201d with Giuliani. According to NBC News, Thursday\u2019s document request marked the ninth subpoena since the impeachment inquiry began, showing that House Democrats are running a focused and fast-moving investigation into the administration\u2019s relationship with Ukraine.", "description": "Rick Perry was subpoenaed by the House committees leadin the impeachment inquiry into President Trump\u2019s quid-pro-quo effort in Ukraine.
