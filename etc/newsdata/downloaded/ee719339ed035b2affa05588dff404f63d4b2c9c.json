At one point, Dillon even called out owner Mike Brown by saying, \"we will never win with the Brown family in Cincinnati.\"\n\nOutside of voicing his frustrations with losing, Dillon's record was clean. He wasn't nearly the controversial figure Brown has been and continues to be.\n\nIn an interview with Jay Morrison of The Athletic, Dillon discussed his disdain for being brought up as an example of players the Patriots have \"fixed.\"\n\n\"They said the same about Rodney (Harrison). They said the same thing about Randy (Moss). They said the same thing about me,\" Dillon told The Athletic. \"But you go down to Gillette Stadium, and you go in that building and ask the staff and the owners and the coaches and players about any one of us, they'd be the first one to tell you, \"Oh, man, those guys were great teammates.\" And I'm still in contact with a lot of the players I played with in Cincinnati.\n\n\"We talk. We chop it up. I think people got it wrong. I was a good teammate. It was just that me and management didn't see eye to eye back then. So when these stories pop up about another player going to the Patriots, my name is one of the first ones they slap up there. Like I was some science project. Nah, buddy. It didn't go down like that.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nNeedless to say, all of Dillon's complaints about losing came to an end when he became a Patriot. The four-time Pro Bowler rushed for 3,180 yards and 37 touchdowns during his three seasons in New England and was a huge contributor en route the team's Super Bowl 39 title.\n\nWhile Dillon doesn't appreciate being lumped into the conversation with Brown, he hopes joining the Patriots will be just what the doctor ordered for the star wideout.\n\n\"The thing about AB, I'm praying for my brother,\" Dillon said. \"I wish him well. It's a perfect setup. All he has to do is go catch the football. All he has to do is show up and play and catch the football, and trust me, he will be knocking on a Super Bowl. It's as easy as that. I'm happy for him. I'll be watching that.\"\n\nIt remains to be seen how, or even if, Brown will contribute in New England. The 31-year-old was accused of sexual assault and rape in a federal lawsuit on Tuesday, and the NFL has informed the Patriots they will be investigating the matter.\n\nClick here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!
