The comments are greeted with laughter.\n\nIn the video, Mr Johnson tells the audience: \"Northern Ireland is part of the union with Great Britain, it is part of the United Kingdom, and let it remain so forever.\n\n\"Let's get Brexit done, let's get Stormont up and running again, and then let's get ready together to invite that threat to the union, Jeremy Corbyn, to step quietly into a figurative rocket and then let us send him into orbit where he belongs.\"\n\nMr Johnson also praised what he called the \"seething sea of faces\" at the event, adding: \"I know that we unionists are in good heart, and that we will prevail.\"\n\nAnd he agreed with an audience member who suggested that a government led by Mr Corbyn would be \"humbug\", saying: \"Yes it would\". The mention of the Labour leader was greeted with boos and cries of \"shame on him\".\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
