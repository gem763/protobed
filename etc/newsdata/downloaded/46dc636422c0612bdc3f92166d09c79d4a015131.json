But, again, why not have, as collectivists demand, the security of employment, housing, or similar important needs in life? These are certainly important needs in life, and the collectivist governance always promotes the guarantee of these needs. They lay out a plan so that these needs are secured for the citizenry by the collective governance.\n\nBecause it is functionally impossible to secure these needs, it is also impossible to secure these needs without destroying liberty.\n\nEconomist Friedrich Hayek provides insight into both of these failures:\n\n[T]he more we try to provide security by interfering with the market system, the greater the insecurity becomes; and , what is worse, the greater becomes the contrast between security of those to whom it is granted as a privilege and the ever increasing insecurity of the underprivileged. And the more security becomes a privilege.[1]\n\nIn other words, who is going to set the price on an item? You? Your customer? Or some price authority? If you and your customer work to decide on a price, then both of you are free (liberty) to accept, deny, or haggle for a price which makes the most sense to each of you to qualify the transaction \u2013 or exchange. And if either of you don\u2019t like what the other party has to offer, you are free to do something else \u2013 buy later, buy from someone else, or decide not to buy at all. If some authority establishes the price, much of the freedom of both parties \u2013 buyer and seller \u2013 is lost. What if neither of you agree with the price established by the authority? The answer: tough!\n\nAnother issue is that we actually become less secure. Those who gather favor of the authority can get a special discount, or can be subsidized. Does that create security, or does it create clamoring to the authority for favoritism to get a leg up? In fact, \u201csecurity can be granted to particular groups only by the kind of planning known as restrictionism,\u201d which in turn means that \u201cothers who are worse off are precluded from sharing in the relatively greater prosperity of the controlled industries. Every restriction on the freedom of entry into a trade reduces the security of all those outside it.\u201d[2]\n\nWhat about income? Surely the right \u2013 or security \u2013 to employment or certain wages helps the citizenry to be more secure. Hayek explains:\n\nCertainty of a given income can, however, not be given to all if any freedom in the choice of one\u2019s occupation is to be allowed. And, if it is provided for some, it becomes a privilege at the expense of others whose security is thereby necessarily diminished. That security of an invariable income can be provided for all only by the abolition of all freedom in the choice of one\u2019s employment\u2026 If those whose usefulness is reduced by circumstances which they could neither foresee nor control were to be protected against undeserved loss, and those whose usefulness has been increased in the same way were prevented from making an unmerited gain, remuneration would soon cease to have any relation to actual usefulness. It would depend on the views held by some authority about what a person ought to have done.[3]\n\nAnd who is to decide what a proper wage is? You? The employer? Or some wage authority? And what if you or the employer do not agree with the wage set by the wage authority?\n\nWhen a person\u2019s income is guaranteed, he can neither be allowed to stay in his job merely because he likes it or choose what other work he would like to do. As it is not he who makes the gain or suffers the loss dependent on his moving or not moving, the choice must be made for him by those who control the distribution of the available income.[4]\n\nLiberty is, at a minimum, diminished, and typically over time completely destroyed. These tenets of the collectivist are utterly opposed to the tenets of the United States. They are utterly opposed to the value of the individual which permeates from American Exceptionalism. These tenets do not create security; they destroy security, except for the privileged few. \u201c[W]ith every grant of complete security to one group the insecurity of the rest necessarily increases.\u201d[5]\n\n[1] Friedrich A. von Hayek (Bruce Caldwell, Ed.), 2007 (originally published in 1944), The Road to Serfdom: Text and Documents, (Routledge, London: The University of Chicago Press), p. 154.\n\n[2] Friedrich A. von Hayek (Bruce Caldwell, Ed.), 2007 (originally published in 1944), The Road to Serfdom: Text and Documents, (Routledge, London: The University of Chicago Press), p. 153.\n\n[3] Friedrich A. von Hayek (Bruce Caldwell, Ed.), 2007 (originally published in 1944), The Road to Serfdom: Text and Documents, (Routledge, London: The University of Chicago Press), p. 150.\n\n[4] Friedrich A. von Hayek (Bruce Caldwell, Ed.), 2007 (originally published in 1944), The Road to Serfdom: Text and Documents, (Routledge, London: The University of Chicago Press), p. 151.", "description": "Freedom in the free-market is security, or self-reliance, in America. .09/16/2019 1:36:17AM EST.", "authors": ["Jim Huntzinger", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/257/aeae8e31-d7f9-4a49-8fa9-81bb8ab86ebc.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-13"}
