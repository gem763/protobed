She thought Jay-Z lacked excitement about Beyonc\u00e9 losing her baby weight\n\nWorking hard: The frustrating scene showed Beyonc\u00e9 preparing for her iconic Coachella performance and celebrating losing weight to fit into her costume after having twins\n\nThe scene showed Beyonc\u00e9 proudly showing off her hard-earned figure to Jay-Z over FaceTime, which he simply smiled and said, 'All right.'\n\nThat response, in Clinton's option, was unacceptable.\n\n'And I said, \"Marc, if that\u2019s ever me, you better have more enthusiasm,\"' Clinton said mentioning her husband of nine years.\n\nLackluster? Beyonc\u00e9 FaceTimed Jay-Z during the scene but he didn't offer up much enthusiasm that she lost the weight\n\n'It wasn\u2019t the \"I\u2019m so proud of you. That\u2019s amazing\" that I arguably think any woman deserves, particularly someone who has clearly worked herself body, mind, heart, soul, and spirit to get to that place.'\n\nShe continued: 'Marc was like, \"Duly noted.\" And I was like, \"I bet every woman watching this has this sense of She deserves more enthusiasm. Marc was like, \"I got it. Can we go back to watching it, please? We\u2019ve talked about it three times in the last 90 seconds.\"'\n\nChelsea resonated with Beyonc\u00e9 in that moment as she was pregnant with her her son Jasper, now-three months old, when watching the documentary.\n\nThere can be pressure for women to bounce back with their bodies quickly, and Chelsea thought partners should be supportive during that time.\n\nChelsea herself knows what it is like to welcome three children - although arguably not twins. The former first daughter gave birth to her third baby, and second son, Jasper in July.\n\nHer eldest child, daughter Charlotte, was born in September 2014, while her middle child, son Aidan, was born in June 2016.\n\nHappy: 'This is a serious accomplishment because I did not think I\u2019d be able to get back into my old costume,' Beyonc\u00e9 said during the scene\n\nImportant: Chelsea, who is pictured in September, two months after giving birth, told her husband Marc that he needed to show more enthusiasm for her postpartum body than Jay-Z\n\nPrior to the FaceTime conversation in her Netflix documentary, Beyonc\u00e9 was heard gushing in the documentary about her work to get her body back just before the Coachella performance in 2018.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 went on a plant-based diet for 44 days, which was created by Marco Borges, exercise physiologist and founder of 22 Days Nutrition.\n\nThe diet eliminated all meats, fish, alcohol, breads, carbs, and sugars from her diet in order to drop the baby weight.\n\n'This is a serious accomplishment because I did not think I\u2019d be able to get back into my old costume. I\u2019m actually in it and I can still move. I still have a ways to go, but this makes me feel good, \u2018cause I\u2019ve been sacrificing and working hard,' Beyonc\u00e9 said during the documentary.\n\nWhen Jay-Z came on the FaceTime, the singer bragged about how the costume 'zipped', which was then when he offered his unenthusiastic smile and response.\n\nThe former first daughter was not the only woman who thought Jay-Z's response was lackluster. A female with Beyonc\u00e9 during the FaceTime also commented on the moment.\n\n'Why aren't guys as excited?' The woman asked while Beyonc\u00e9 just shook her head.\n\nDespite this moment in the documentary, Chelsea did say she 'loved' Homecoming.", "description": "The 39-year-old spoke with The Cut about her career after the 2016 election.
