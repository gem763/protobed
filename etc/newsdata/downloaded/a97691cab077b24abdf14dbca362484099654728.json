REUTERS/Issei Kato\n\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS rose 0.19%. Chinese shares .CSI300 rose 0.13%, while Japan's Nikkei .N225 rose 0.28%.\n\nThe pound slipped from a five-month high against the dollar and the euro after the British parliament forced Prime Minister Boris Johnson to seek a delay to an Oct. 31 deadline for Britain\u2019s departure from the bloc.\n\nThe vote for an extension dealt a blow to optimism that a deal agreed last week would ensure Brexit happens with little economic disruption.\n\nOil futures fell as lingering economic growth concerns and excess supplies of crude prompted speculators to trim their long positions.\n\nChinese vice premier Liu He said on Friday that China will work with the United States to address each other\u2019s concerns, and that stopping the trade war would be good for both sides and the world.\n\nShares in Hong Kong also got a lift after Chinese bourses revised rules to allow mainland investors to buy Hong Kong-listed dual-class shares for the first time.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had some positive news from Liu, and allowing Chinese investors direct access to dual-listed Hong Kong shares is a another positive,\u201d said Sean Darby, global equity strategist at Jefferies in Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cThere is still a lot of money on the sidelines, and there are only eight or nine weeks left to put that money to work before we end the year. I expect markets to remain bid.\u201d\n\nU.S. stock futures ESc1 rose 0.27% in Asia as investors brace for high-profile earnings this week from Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Amazon.com (AMZN.O) and others.\n\nThe S&P 500 fell 0.4% on Friday partly due to worries about fallout from the U.S.-China trade war.\n\nA 15-month long trade war between the United States and China has shown few signs of a durable resolution being reached despite several rounds of talks.\n\nFinancial markets have been whipsawed over this period as a steady increase in tit-for-tat tariffs have slowed global trade and raised the risk of recession for some countries.\n\nUnderscoring the damage, Japan\u2019s exports fell in September for the 10th straight month, while South Korea\u2019s exports for the first 20 days of October dived 19.5% year-on-year, data on Monday showed.\n\nHong Kong shares .HSI erased early losses to rise 0.26%.\n\nChinese bourses on Friday revised rules that would allow Hong Kong-listed dual-class shares to be included in the Stock Connect scheme for the first time, potentially benefiting popular tech companies such as Xiaomi Corp (1810.HK) and Meituan Dianping (3690.HK).\n\nThe rule change, which will take effect on Oct. 28, could be a positive for Hong Kong shares, which have been battered during months of often violent protest against Chinese rule of the former British colony.\n\nThe pound GBP=D3 fell 0.7% to $1.2911 and was off about 0.4% to 86.46 pence per euro.\n\nThe British government insists Brexit will take place on Oct. 31, but uncertainty over how British lawmakers will respond could weigh on sentiment for sterling.\n\nThe leader of the House of Commons says the government plans to put the new Brexit deal to a debate and vote on Monday, but it is unclear if the speaker of the House will let this happen.\n\nElsewhere in the currency markets, the dollar edged 0.1% higher to $1.1157 per euro EUR=EBS but held steady at 108.49 yen JPY=EBS.\n\nU.S. crude CLc1 dipped 0.24% to $53.65 a barrel. Brent crude LCOc1 fell 0.34% to $59.22 per barrel.\n\nMoney managers cut their net long U.S. crude futures and options positions in the week to Oct. 15, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said on Friday.\n\nLong bets on U.S. crude have dropped sharply in the last two weeks after a spate of weak economic figures worldwide fanned concerns about global energy demand.\n\nTreasury prices fell in Asia. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes US10YT=RR rose to 1.7554%.\n\nGold XAU=, often considered safe-haven asset, was little changed at $1,490.12 per ounce.", "description": "Asian stocks edged higher on Monday as Chinese shares reversed early losses due to hopes for progress in resolving the U.S.-China trade war and expectations for greater investment inflows into Hong Kong.", "authors": ["Stanley White", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191021&t=2&i=1443196589&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9K01F", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
