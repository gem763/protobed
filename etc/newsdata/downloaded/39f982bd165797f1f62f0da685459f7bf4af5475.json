Here, one of the islands\u2019 most abundant and vibrant coral reefs thrives just below the surface.\n\nYet even this remote shoreline far from the impacts of chemical sunscreen, trampling feet and industrial wastewater is showing early signs of what\u2019s expected to be a catastrophic season for coral in Hawaii.\n\nJust four years after a major marine heat wave killed nearly half of this coastline\u2019s coral, federal researchers are predicting another round of hot water will cause some of the worst coral bleaching the region has ever seen.\n\n\u201cIn 2015, we hit temperatures that we\u2019ve never recorded ever in Hawaii,\u201d said Jamison Gove, an oceanographer with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. \u201cWhat is really important - or alarming, probably more appropriately - about this event is that we\u2019ve been tracking above where we were at this time in 2015.\u201d\n\nResearchers using high-tech equipment to monitor Hawaii\u2019s reefs are seeing early signs of bleaching in Papa Bay and elsewhere caused by a marine heat wave that has sent temperatures soaring to record highs for months. June, July and parts of August all experienced the hottest ocean temperatures ever recorded around the Hawaiian Islands. So far in September, oceanic temperatures are below only those seen in 2015.\n\nForecasters expect high temperatures in the north Pacific will continue to pump heat into Hawaii\u2019s waters well into October.\n\n\u201cTemperatures have been warm for quite a long time,\u201d Gove said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just how hot it is - it\u2019s how long those ocean temperatures stay warm.\u201d\n\nOcean temperatures are not uniformly warm across the state, Gove noted. Local wind patterns, currents and even features on land can create hot spots in the water.\n\n\u201cYou have things like two giant volcanoes on the Big Island blocking the predominant trade winds,\u201d making the island\u2019s west coast, where Papa Bay sits, one of the hottest parts of the state, Gove said. He said he expects \u201csevere\u201d coral bleaching in those places.\n\n\u201cThis is widespread, 100% bleaching of most corals,\u201d Gove said. And many of those corals are still recovering from the 2015 bleaching event, meaning they are more susceptible to thermal stress.\n\nAccording to NOAA, the heat wave\u2019s causes include a persistent low-pressure weather pattern between Hawaii and Alaska that has weakened winds that otherwise might mix and cool surface waters across much of the North Pacific. What\u2019s causing that is unclear: It might reflect the atmosphere\u2019s usual chaotic motion, or it could be related to the warming of the oceans and other effects of human-made climate change.\n\nBeyond this event, oceanic temperatures will continue to rise in the coming years, Gove said. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that global climate change is contributing to what we\u2019re experiencing,\u201d he said.\n\nFor coral, hot water means stress, and prolonged stress kills these creatures and can leave reefs in shambles.\n\nBleaching occurs when stressed corals release algae that provide them with vital nutrients. That algae also gives the coral its color, so when it\u2019s expelled, the coral turns white.\n\nCoral reefs are vital around the world as they not only provide a habitat for fish - the base of the marine food chain - but food and medicine for humans. They also create an essential shoreline barrier that breaks apart large ocean swells and protects densely populated shorelines from storm surges during hurricanes.\n\nIn Hawaii, reefs are also a major part of the economy: Tourism thrives largely because of coral reefs that help create and protect iconic white sand beaches, offer snorkeling and diving spots, and help form waves that draw surfers from around the world.\n\nGove said researchers have a technological advantage for monitoring and gleaning insights into this year\u2019s bleaching, data that could help save reefs in the future.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to track this event in real time via satellite, which is the first time that\u2019s ever been done,\u201d Gove said.\n\nIn remote Papa Bay, most of the corals have recovered from the 2015 bleaching event, but scientists worry they won\u2019t fare as well this time.\n\n\u201cNearly every species that we monitor has at least some bleaching,\u201d said ecologist Greg Asner, director of Arizona State University\u2019s Center for Global Discovery and Conservation Science, after a dive in the bay earlier this month.\n\nAsner told The Associated Press that sensors showed the bay was about 3.5 degrees Fahrenheit above what is normal for this time of year.\n\nHe uses advanced imaging technology mounted to aircrafts, satellite data, underwater sensors and information from the public to give state and federal researchers like Gove the information they need.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s really important here is that we\u2019re taking these (underwater) measurements, connecting them to our aircraft data and then connecting them again to the satellite data,\u201d Asner said. \u201cThat lets us scale up to see the big picture to get the truth about what\u2019s going on here.\u201d\n\nScientists will use the information to research, among other things, why some coral species are more resilient to thermal stress. Some of the latest research suggests slowly exposing coral to heat in labs can condition them to withstand hotter water in the future.\n\n\u201cAfter the heat wave ends, we will have a good map with which to plan restoration efforts,\u201d Asner said.\n\nHawaii residents like Cindi Punihaole Kennedy are pitching in by volunteering to educate tourists. Punihaole Kennedy is director of the Kahalu\u2019u Bay Education Center, a nonprofit created to help protect Kahalu\u2019u Bay, a popular snorkeling spot near the Big Island\u2019s tourist center of Kailua-Kona.\n\nThe bay and surrounding beach park welcome more than 400,000 visitors a year, she said.\n\n\u201cWe share with them what to do and what not to do as they enter the bay,\u201d she said. \u201cFor instance, avoid stepping on the corals or feeding the fish.\u201d\n\nThe area suffered widespread bleaching and coral death in 2015.\n\n\u201cIt was devastating for us to not be able to do anything,\u201d Punihaole Kennedy said. \u201cWe just watched the corals die.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "At the edge of an ancient lava flow where jagged black rocks meet the Pacific, small off-the-grid homes overlook the calm blue waters of Papa Bay on Hawaii's Big Island - no tourists or hotels in sight.
