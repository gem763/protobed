It\u2019s not about the other team and what the other team has done in the past two or three decades,\u201d Rolovich said.\n\nHistory hasn\u2019t been kind to the Warriors in their previous trips to Boise, but a win over the 14th-ranked Broncos on Saturday night would be a major statement about the strides made by Rolovich in his fourth season in charge.\n\nHawaii (4-1, 1-0 Mountain West) already grabbed attention when it opened the season with home wins over Arizona and Oregon State. But what happened two weeks ago at Nevada may have changed the perception of the Warriors as much as either of the early wins over the Pac-12.\n\nPlaying away from Honolulu has always been a struggle, except in rare seasons. That\u2019s why the blowout win at Nevada was noteworthy. Hawaii simply has not gone on the road and thumped opponents the way it did the Wolf Pack in the 54-3 victory, its largest margin of victory since joining the Mountain West.\n\nThe Warriors\u2019 performance altered the importance of the matchup against Boise State.\n\n\u201cWe got in our opinion the best football team we\u2019ve played all year long,\u201d Boise State coach Bryan Harsin said.\n\nThe Broncos (5-0, 2-0) returned from their first open weekend with an easy, albeit incomplete 38-13 win over UNLV last week. Freshman quarterback Hank Bachmeier threw a pair of early touchdown passes, including a 76-yarder to John Hightower, and finished with 299 yards passing. Hightower\u2019s long TD catch was his sixth career touchdown of 50 or more yards.\n\nAfter being a bit prone to throwing picks early in the season, Bachmeier has gone 69 straight attempts without an interception. His last came in the second quarter of Boise State\u2019s win over Portland State on Sept. 14.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a good player, he\u2019s a starter for us but there is still a lot he\u2019s learning as the season is going on,\u201d Harsin said. \u201cThere is a lot he\u2019s getting better at and I think he\u2019s doing a really good job.\u201d\n\nHere are other things to watch as the Warriors look for their first win ever in Boise:\n\nSACK MASTER\n\nCurtis Weaver became the Mountain West\u2019s all-time leader in sacks when he recorded three of Boise State\u2019s five sacks last week against UNLV. Weaver now has 29\u00bd in his career and leads the country with nine sacks this season. With as often as the Warriors put the ball in the air, Weaver could have plenty of opportunities to add to that total this week.\n\n\u201cCurtis has prepared himself every single week to go out there and do that,\u201d Harsin said.\n\nBYRD IS THE WORD\n\nIf the Warriors are going to stick around, Cedric Byrd II needs to have a big game. Byrd leads the country with nine touchdown catches after grabbing three in the victory over Nevada. He\u2019s third nationally with an average of eight receptions per game, and in an offense where the ball gets distributed all over the place he has clearly become the favored target of quarterback Cole McDonald.\n\nDECIDING DOWN\n\nBoise State has been exceptional on third down on both sides of the ball. The Broncos are converting 46.7% of their third downs on offense, 22nd best in the country. Bachmeier is 29 of 45 for 507 yards with 23 first downs and four touchdowns in third-down situations this season.\n\nDefensively, the Broncos have been ever better. Boise State is allowing just 23.9% conversions on third downs. That\u2019s third-best in the country behind Wisconsin and Kansas State.\n\nHawaii hasn\u2019t been too bad itself. The Warriors are converting 42.6% of their third downs and allowing only 32.8% conversions. Those are both among the top 50 nationally.\n\nRED-ZONE EFFICIENCY\n\nBoise State would like to see more of its red-zone drives finish in the end zone. Of the Broncos\u2019 19 red-zone possessions, only 10 have ended in touchdowns. They rank 100th nationally in converting red-zone possessions into touchdowns. Hawaii has been one of the better teams in the Mountain West at limiting TDs in the red zone. They\u2019ve allowed eight TDs on 14 red-zone possessions.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "One of Nick Rolovich's major concerns during Hawaii's week off was making sure his Rainbow Warriors didn't get wrapped up in the history of what Boise State has accomplished with the Broncos next on the schedule.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tim Booth"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/11/boise_st_unlv_football_68949_c0-106-2550-1593_s1200x700.jpg?cc12906feae00d8508c8ec0fd3366b06087a6db3", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
