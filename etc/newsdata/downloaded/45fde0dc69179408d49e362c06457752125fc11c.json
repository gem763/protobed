We have a number of initiatives and policies in place to enhance our employee wellbeing, including a focus on flexible working,\" she said.\n\nPush back plea\n\nThe 20 national firms that opposed the ruling argued the date it took effect should be pushed back from March 1 to July 1 2020 and cited a survey conducted by the director of human resources at K &L Gates, Nick Grant about the burden it would impose.\n\nMr Grant is president of HR Minds, a group of 15 law firms that formed in 2012 \"to provide an employer and HR perspective on the draft Award\". K &L Gates represented the opposing firms at the Fair Work Commission.\n\nMr Grant reported in his witness statement that:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost employees on annualised salary arrangements were paid well in excess of minimum rates under the LSA;\n\nOnly 11 per cent of those employees were always paid overtime; 58 per cent were only paid extra when \"an inordinate number of overtime hours were performed in a period; 32 per cent had \"other arrangements\";\n\nNo firm asked full-time employees to fill out timesheets;\n\n42 per cent of firms do not have HR systems that can capture start and finish times; 47 per cent said it would take 12 months or more to get systems up to speed.\n\nIn 2010, legal practices became \"national system employers\" under the Commonwealth\u2019s Fair Work Act. The Legal Services Award also started from January 1 and applied to all private enterprises in the business of providing legal services or legal support services.\n\nIt sets out the terms and conditions of employment for legal. clerical and administrative staff, law clerks (paralegals) and law graduates. It does not cover those with a practising certificate, which limits its application to those in their first year of practice. Lawyers are usually formally admitted to practice in that time after fulfilling some post-university requirements. In most states, this is done via a college of law.\n\nUnder scrutiny\n\nThe FWC ruling followed a year in which the profession came under scrutiny for the long hours worked by junior lawyers, especially during the Hayne royal commission. King & Wood Mallesons faced a WorkSafe Victoria investigation after a complaint by one of its lawyers and Gilbert + Tobin was the subject of allegations to SafeWork NSW about \"extreme\" working conditions.\n\nYoung lawyers surveyed by the Financial Review earlier this year cited aligning base pay with overtime worked as the second-most important change that could improve their lives.\n\nLaw Council of Australia president Arthur Moses said \"keeping track of the days and hours worked by graduate lawyers and paralegals is an important way to monitor their health and safety and ensure their longevity in the legal profession\".\n\n\"Many firms already do this. This ensures that young lawyers are not consistently working long hours, which may be detrimental to their health,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said that when long hours needed to be worked it was important \"to ensure people receive appropriate time off and are properly remunerated\".\n\nMichael Tidball, the chief executive of the Law Society of NSW, which represents 30,000 solicitors, said it was \"no secret that certain aspects of legal work require long hours\".\n\nStep in right direction\n\n\"It is the responsibility of the employer to ensure the wellbeing of employees, including young lawyers,\" he said.\n\nKeeping time: Law Council president Arthur Moses, SC. Supplied\n\nLaw Institute of Victoria director Brendan Lacota said the rules were \"a great step in the right direction\" but their effectiveness would be limited as they only covered graduates until they obtained a practising certificate towards the end of their year.\n\n\"It's plugging a gap, but as early year lawyers aren't covered by the award, it's missing a huge portion of the vulnerable employees it seeks to protect,\" Mr Lacota said.\n\nHe said supply of entry-level lawyers was outstripping demand at commercial firms, diminishing new recruits' negotiating power.\n\nThe 20 firms represented at the FWC, were Arnold Bloch Leibler, Allen & Overy, Allens, Ashurst, Baker McKenzie, Clayton Utz, Corrs, Davies Collison Cave, DLA Piper, Gadens, Gilbert + Tobin, Hall and Wilcox, Herbert Smith Freehills, King & Wood Mallesons, Lander & Rogers, Maddocks, MinterEllison, Norton Rose Fullbright, Piper Alderman and Russell Kennedy Lawyers.", "description": "Law firms can take advantage of an \"escape hatch\" to avoid new reporting conditions on staff pay and hours.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.404%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_218%2C$y_130/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/2660331888d7b0dd5341d7636c0cfcf6008bcd6d", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
