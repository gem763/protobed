And neither side is giving an inch.\n\nTRUMP DEMANDS SCHIFF RESIGN OVER 'PARODY' READING OF UKRAINE CALL\n\nTrump and his allies are now ramping up their attacks on Democrats, the media, the whistleblower and the various sources who fed information on the president that made its way into the complaint. House Democrats, meanwhile, are moving full speed ahead with the formal impeachment inquiry announced earlier this week, with reports indicating lawmakers plan to move quickly with their investigation -- raising the possibility of articles of impeachment before year's end.\n\n\"The presidential oath of office requires the President of the United States to do two things: Faithfully execute his or her office, and protect and defend the Constitution. The whistleblower complaint and call record provide the most graphic evidence yet Trump has done neither,\" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff tweeted.\n\nAll this has played out in a matter of days, with the Ukraine controversy spurring Democratic leadership into impeachment action in a way the Russia controversy did not. The White House, for its part, spent most of the week trying to clear the air. It released a transcript of the call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenksy showing Trump urging his Kiev counterpart to \"look into\" former Vice President Joe Biden and his son\u2014a move Democrats claim was Trump seeking assistance from a foreign power in the 2020 presidential election. The now-released whistleblower complaint on the same call included additional allegations, including claims that officials tried to hide records of the call.\n\nBut the president and his legal team are fighting back by likening the whistleblower and his or her sources to spies -- and questioning whether this is all the work of partisans.\n\n\"Sounding more and more like the so-called Whistleblower isn\u2019t a Whistleblower at all. In addition, all second hand information that proved to be so inaccurate that there may not have even been somebody else, a leaker or spy, feeding it to him or her? A partisan operative?\" Trump tweeted Friday.\n\nHe also blasted media coverage, including the New York Times' Peter Baker for his latest reporting on the call.\n\nAnd he demanded the resignation of Schiff, D-Calif., for \"fraudulently\" reading out a hyperbolic account of his phone call with the Ukrainian president during a hearing on Thursday.\n\nTrump began raising questions about the whistleblower on Thursday.\n\n\u201cI want to know who\u2019s the person, who\u2019s the person who gave the whistleblower the information?\u201d Trump said, according to audio of his remarks at a private event in a New York hotel obtained by the Los Angeles Times. \u201cBecause that\u2019s close to a spy.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cYou know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyer Jay Sekulow suggested Friday the whistleblower had assistance in writing the complaint that rocked Washington.\n\n\u201cDo you think the whistleblower drafted the complaint? I mean realistically?\u201d Sekulow said on \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d \u201cLook at the phraseology, the endnotes, and the footnotes\u2014this wasn\u2019t drafted by this individual. This was written by a law firm. The American people see it as it is. Nobody has an appetite for this anymore.\u201d\n\nSekulow blasted the fallout surrounding the controversy as \u201cpolitical theater.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no there, there,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was no violation of law, rule or regulation.\u201d\n\nREPUBLICANS WANT WHISTLEBLOWER'S SOURCES, AS INCONSISTENCIES IN COMPLAINT EMERGE\n\nOn Thursday, acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified publicly before the House Intelligence Committee. Despite being pressed for hours by Democrats, Maguire maintained that the whistleblower complaint was \u201chearsay\u201d and \u201csecond-hand\u201d information\u2014a sentiment Sekulow echoed Friday.\n\nSekulow also responded to allegations the White House moved call records from a computer system where they are normally kept to a system normally used for classified information.\n\n\u201cA cover-up? Think about that for a moment. The White House secured a call with the president of Ukraine? It\u2019s so secret, and such a cover-up, here\u2019s the documents,\u201d Sekulow said. \u201cThis is nonsense.\u201d\n\nThe transcript itself showed Trump pressing Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. Joe Biden has acknowledged on camera that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire the prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings \u2014 where Biden's son Hunter had a highly lucrative role on the board. Biden supporters say Shokin was widely accused of corruption.\n\nWhile the transcript shows Trump pressing Ukraine to \u201clook into\u201d the Bidens, it does not show the U.S. president explicitly linking that request to U.S. aid \u2014 which had been frozen days earlier, a detail that fueled impeachment calls earlier this week and helped prompt House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to announce a formal impeachment inquiry Tuesday.\n\nTrump allies, like Sekulow, and others in the White House, have used that distinction to maintain the claim that \u201cthere was no quid pro quo.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the whistleblower also alleged that Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, whom the president mentioned on the call could help Zelensky in any anti-corruption probes, was improperly involved in soliciting foreign interference in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nGiuliani, though, defended his involvement, telling Fox News\u2019 Laura Ingraham, \u201cI think I should get some kind of an award.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat they charged as Russian collusion was really Ukrainian collusion,\u201d Giuliani said on \u201cThe Ingraham Angle\u201d Thursday night. \u201cI am doing an effective job of showing what phonies they are and I am uncovering what you will find to be an enormous pay for play scheme.\u201d\n\nGiuliani also told the Atlantic on Thursday that he thinks he deserves praise for his involvement with Ukraine.\n\n\u201cIt is impossible that the whistle-blower is a hero and I\u2019m not,\u201d he told the Atlantic. \u201cAnd I will be the hero! These morons\u2014when this is over, I will be the hero.\u201d\n\nBut Democrats are using all of the developments as fodder as they hit the gas pedal in their impeachment proceedings. Pelosi said Friday that she did not have an exact timetable for impeachment, though noted that it could \u201ctake time.\u201d\n\nPelosi also noted that the House committees involved in the process are going to probe the \u201ccover-up\u201d allegations while saying that Trump\u2019s comments about the whistleblower have been \u201cdangerous.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cFor the president to say what he said about those who may have supplied information to the whistleblower seriously undermines integrity in government,\u201d Pelosi said Friday. \u201cBut the president does that almost every day.\u201d\n\nThe House and Senate are on recess for the next two weeks, but members plan to use this period to speak to constituents and garner support for the process.\n\n\u201cCongress ought to be talking to their constituents and gaining their perspective on that and why they think this is such an important facet of this ongoing investigation,\u201d House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said. \u201cI think consideration of the public\u2019s viewpoint is critically important.\u201d\n\nAnd freshman pro-impeachment Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., said members need to \u201cgo home and educate them.\u201d\n\nFox News\u2019 Adam Shaw, Chad Pergram, and Matthew Reidy contributed to this report.", "description": "The White House and congressional Democrats\u00a0moved into a state of total political war in the wake of this week's stunning document dumps, historic testimony and impeachment inquiry launch over President Trump's July phone call with the\u00a0Ukrainian president.", "authors": ["Brooke Singman", "Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News.
