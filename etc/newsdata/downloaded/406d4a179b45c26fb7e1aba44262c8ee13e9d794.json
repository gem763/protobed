On Wall Street, it takes a sharp eye for stocks and a clear view of what makes a winning investment \u2013 and not every analyst has that. TipRanks finds those who do, however, by using natural language algorithms to sort through the records of more than 5,500 analysts. The results show that Cantor's Joseph Foresi is at the head of the pack, with an 86% success rate and a 23% yearly average return on his ratings.\n\nForesi is a tech sector expert, with a proven record that has earned him the #1 spot in the TipRanks database. So, when he starts pointing out stocks with high potential for return, investors open up their ears. We\u2019ve pulled up three of his recent reviews, to find out ones Foresi sees as compelling buys in the tech market.\n\nSquare (SQ)\n\nThe top competitor to PayPal in the online payment environment, Square offers online financial services and mobile payments for merchants and vendors. The company\u2019s Square Reader allows any smartphone to read scan a credit card, while the Square Stand can turn Apple\u2019s iPads into cash registers. The company is a great boon to small merchants and traveling vendors. The devices are money-saving, and are popular with small businesses.\n\nIn addition to its line of clever transaction gadgets, Square also offers the Square Cash App, a head-to-head competitor with PayPal\u2019s Venmo, the combination payment transfer service/social network. Square\u2019s Cash App boasts more than 7 million active users, and even supports Bitcoin trading.\n\nForesi focused on Cash App in his recent review of Square. He said, \u201cWe believe that Cash App is Square's entrance into a consumer money management platform. The Cash App can take advantage of the opportunities in people-to-people and debit usage growth. We estimate Cash App will represent incremental adjusted revenue growth of 10 percentage points on average over three years.\u201d\n\nAt the bottom line, Foresi says of Square and Cash App: \u201cSQ Cash looks well positioned to continue taking market share in P2P through viral, grass roots marketing & its incentivized network effect. We are positive on SQ Cash's future monetization, as it has the largest offerings for a P2P platform, and SQ looks to continue to roll out new solutions.\u201d He further notes that Cash App is the leader in P2P Bitcoin trading, and that there is high potential for the app to tap into SQ\u2019s merchant network as a user base for Bitcoin trading.\n\nIn line with his upbeat outlook on Cash App, and Square generally, Foresi rates SQ stock an Overweight along with $91 price target, indicating confidence in over 40% upside.\n\nOverall, SQ has drawn optimism mixed with caution when it comes to consensus opinion among sell-side analysts. Out of 24 analysts polled by TipRanks in the last 3 months, 11 are bullish on SQ stock, 9 remain sidelined, while 4 are bearish on the stock. With a slight return potential of 13%, the stock's consensus target price stands at $72.59, revealing apprehension baked into analysts' expectations.
