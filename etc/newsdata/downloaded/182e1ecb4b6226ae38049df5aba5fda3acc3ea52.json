AMZN, -1.50% scored multiple early victories at the 71st Emmy Awards Sunday night, with wins for comedies \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel \u201d and \u201cFleabag.\u201d\n\n\u201cFleabag\u201d creator and star Phoebe Waller-Bridge won for outstanding lead actress in a comedy series and took home a second award for writing the series. They are the British actress\u2019s first Emmys.\n\nWaller-Bridge\u2019s dark comedy about a dysfunctional woman in London who breaks the fourth wall to narrate her own mishaps, also won a directing award. And her acting win blocked \u201cVeep\u201d star Julia Louis-Dreyfus from setting a record as the most-honored performer in Emmy history.\n\n\u201cMrs. Maisel\u2019s\u201d Alex Borstein, who plays the manager of the stand-up comedian at the center of the show, took home the supporting actress award for the second year in a row.\n\n\u201cI want to dedicate this to the strength of a woman, to (series creator) Amy Sherman-Palladino, to every woman on the \u2018Maisel\u2019 cast and crew,\u201d Borstein said, and to her mother and grandmother. Her grandmother survived because she was courageous enough to step out of a line that, Borstein intimated, would have led to her death at the hands of Nazi Germany.\n\n\u201cShe stepped out of line. And for that, I am here and my children are here, so step out of line, ladies. Step out of line,\u201d said Borstein, who won the award last year.\n\nTony Shaloub, who plays lead \u201cMrs. Maisel\u201d lead Rachel Brosnahan\u2019s professor father, won best supporting actor, his fourth Emmy.\n\n\u201cVeep\u201d network HBO went into this year\u2019s program leading all networks with 137 total nominations, including a record 32 for \u201cGame of Thrones, while Netflix NFLX, -5.53% went into voting with 118 nominations. The two outlets tied for total wins in 2018.\n\nAMZN shares are up 19.4% so far this year, with NFLX shares up about 1% so far in 2019. The S&P 500 SPX, -0.49% is up 19%.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Amazon scored multiple early victories at the 71st Emmy Awards Sunday night, with wins for comedies \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel \u201d and \u201cFleabag.\u201d", "authors": ["Rachel Koning Beals", "News Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR812_waller_ZG_20190922215219.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
