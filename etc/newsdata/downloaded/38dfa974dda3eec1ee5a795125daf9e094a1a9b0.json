A former Google software engineer, Nolan resigned from her job last year after being asked to dramatically enhance the artificial intelligence used in US military drones. She is now calling for a ban on all forms of autonomous weapons on the basis that they might accidentally initiate a catastrophic global war. She said this as part of her role as a member of the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots.\n\nNow, listen, sometimes I\u2019m able to kid myself about the goodness of people. I might not agree with them all the time, but at least I can understand our differences. I get why they might vote for a certain political party, or why they wanted Brexit to happen. After all, aren\u2019t we all just people muddling through the muck together? And then I realise that there is a group called Stop Killer Robots, and it actually has to convince people to stop killer robots. Killer bloody robots, for crying out loud. Its only goal is to stop robots from destroying all of humanity as we know it, and it needs to exist because it turns out that some people aren\u2019t automatically horrified by the idea.\n\nAnd it is actually close. In January, the group revealed that 61% of people oppose killer robots. That means that 39% of people \u2013 people who have presumably seen The Terminator and Westworld and that one Black Mirror episode and Age of Ultron \u2013 still think we should give killer robots a break.\n\nI think I\u2019m done. I know there are two sides to every argument and that our differences are what make us unique, but if we can\u2019t even agree about a subject as nightmarish as the prospect of being murdered in our beds by a legion of grinning automata, we\u2019re screwed. Let the robots come for us. We deserve it.", "description": "According to a recent survey, 39% of us aren\u2019t against machines capable of destroying humanity.
