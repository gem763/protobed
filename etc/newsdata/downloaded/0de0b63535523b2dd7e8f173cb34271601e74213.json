This year it was my decision,\u2019 says James, who separated from Beverley, with whom he has three children, Croyde, 16, Kiki, ten, and eight-year-old Trixie, in November last year.\n\n\u2018When I told her I was going to do it, she said: \u201cWe both know your dancing ability. You\u2019ll be appalling and won\u2019t be there very long.\u201d \u2019\n\nLast week, the Olympic rower became the first of this year\u2019s crop of celebrity contestants to be voted off the show after achieving the lowest ever score in Strictly history for his jive.\n\nJames Cracknell said his year at Cambridge is, he says, responsible for this newfound confidence \u2014 that and the new woman in his life, Jordan Connell, a 34-year-old American, who shares his newly rented flat in West London. Pictured together\n\nFor those of us who watched his partner Luba Mushtuk coax him through his dance moves, it was excruciating.\n\nJudge Bruno Tonioli likened him to a \u2018galumphing Godzilla\u2019, while Craig Revel Horwood awarded him just two points for his stiff-as-an-oar tango, confiding, \u2018you get two points for putting your shoes on\u2019.\n\nTo be fair, James cannot hear musical beats and is \u2018not a great learner\u2019 after he suffered terrible head injuries nine years ago when he was hit by the wing mirror of a truck while cycling across America. The damage to the frontal lobe of his brain affected his personality and, eventually, his marriage as Beverley despaired of life on what she calls \u2018Planet James\u2019.\n\nTheir divorce is, he says, \u2018amicable, although it varies between how amicable\u2019 and he continues to respect Beverley. So why on earth, didn\u2019t he listen to her?\n\n\u2018You\u2019ve got three kids at independent schools, a house to run, a full-time nanny and, when you\u2019re a student [James spent the past year studying evolutionary and behavioural science as a postgraduate at Cambridge, where he rowed for the university in the Boat Race] your earning potential drops.\n\nJordan, who met James at Cambridge last October when she arrived to study for an MBA, is a smart young woman who is \u2018ridiculously happy\u2019 to have met James\n\n\u2018This was also the first time I felt confident enough to do something I wasn\u2019t very good at and not be afraid of looking stupid.\u2019\n\nJames is, by nature, a shy, introverted man. Or, as Beverley once said shortly after they met in 2000, \u2018show me a room of Olympic medallists and I\u2019ll show you a room of insecure people.\u2019\n\nHis year at Cambridge is, he says, responsible for this newfound confidence \u2014 that and the new woman in his life, Jordan Connell, a 34-year-old American, who shares his newly rented flat in West London.\n\nWhen she walks in, James lights up like the Strictly glitterball.\n\nJordan, who met James at Cambridge last October when she arrived to study for an MBA, is a smart young woman who is \u2018ridiculously happy\u2019 to have met James.\n\nThis is the first interview she has given since her romance with James began shortly before Christmas. After winning the Boat Race, James travelled with Jordan to her native New York where he met her mother Rosemarie, who works on Wall Street. \u2018She really liked James. Who wouldn\u2019t? She said she\u2019s happy I\u2019m happy.\n\n\u2018I like to think I make him happy, too. When internet trolls were making cruel comments about his dancing and \u2018wooden personality\u2019 on Strictly I thought, \u201cHow can you put that? You don\u2019t know him.\u201d I know he feels things very deeply.\n\n\u2018I feel so strongly about bullying online. Try sitting down with the person you love when they\u2019re upset by what\u2019s being said because their children will read it. James does have an amazing personality. He\u2019s funny and kind. It\u2019s the little things he does like going out to track down a bar of Hershey\u2019s chocolate for me, which is special because it\u2019s so hard to find in the UK.\u2019\n\nAfter winning the Boat Race, James travelled with Jordan to her native New York where he met her mother Rosemarie, who works on Wall Street. \u2018She really liked James. Who wouldn\u2019t? She said she\u2019s happy I\u2019m happy\n\nJordan was in the audience at last week\u2019s live show with James\u2019s close friend and fellow adventurer Ben Fogle to see him voted off.\n\nJames continues: \u2018She just said, \u201cI\u2019m really proud of you. You really went for it.\u201d So you can\u2019t regret that, although I didn\u2019t feel a million dollars on the self-esteem side waking up the next morning.\n\n\u2018I genuinely felt for Luba who put so much into it and I was really sorry for the girls [his daughters] who were looking forward to coming to the dance studio this week. They were disappointed about that. So was I. I thought it would be nice to include them in something I was doing. You can\u2019t really include them in rowing.\n\n\u2018How the kids feel is the most important thing for Bev and me. I\u2019ve got to reform a long-term relationship with them that really works for all of us. It\u2019ll take time over the next few months to sort it out. The sooner I get this place up and running the better.\u2019\n\nJames has only recently moved into his three-bedroom flat. Beverley packed his share of 17 years of married life into goodness knows how many plastic boxes and he doesn\u2019t have a clue how he\u2019ll fit it all in.\n\nJames decided to rent here because it\u2019s a stone\u2019s throw from the family home of which he is no longer a part following his decision to study at Cambridge and compete in the Boat Race.\n\nThe day after his superhuman victory on the Thames \u2014 at 47, James was double the age of many of the crew \u2014 Beverley eviscerated him in a newspaper article, writing that going to university to study full-time and train for the race was \u2018an absolute dereliction of parenting and marital duty\u2019.\n\n\u2018That ferocity, when it\u2019s in your corner, is great,\u2019 says James. \u2018That was one of the things I was attracted to and loved her for. I wouldn\u2019t have made the recovery I have without her fire. It\u2019s not so nice when it\u2019s not in your corner, but you can\u2019t fall in love with an opinionated woman and then moan when she has an opinion.\n\n\u2018It hurts but it\u2019s on me as well. I wasn\u2019t the best husband in the world. I wanted to go to Cambridge to get academic credibility for the work I was doing in public health [James worked with conservative think tank the Centre for Social Justice on ways of tackling childhood obesity and has been on the candidates\u2019 list to be a Conservative MP since 2014.]\n\n\u2018Beverley didn\u2019t share my desire for me to go into politics. I don\u2019t think she liked the idea of being a politician\u2019s wife.\n\nJames cannot hear musical beats and is \u2018not a great learner\u2019 after he suffered terrible head injuries nine years ago when he was hit by the wing mirror of a truck while cycling across America. The damage to the frontal lobe of his brain affected his personality and, eventually, his marriage as Beverley Turner despaired of life on what she calls \u2018Planet James\u2019. Pictured: James and Beverley in 2015\n\n\u2018Going to Cambridge was a last-chance saloon, in my head, to get her to see me away from the prism of the accident, but it was a bit late for our marriage.\u2019\n\nWhen Jordan met James on the first day of term at his college, Peterhouse, she didn\u2019t have a clue he was a feted Olympian or that he\u2019d suffered a brain injury.\n\n\u2018One of the best things about going to Cambridge was, let\u2019s face it, a lot of the students weren\u2019t born when I won the Olympics. I really enjoyed meeting people who took me as I am,\u2019 says James.\n\n\u2018To be honest, with Jordan the conversation was so easy and it was so nice to hang out with someone who had no preconceptions of who you were before.\n\n\u2018The reality is that Jordan\u2019s the first . . .\u2019 He turns to her. \u2018You\u2019re the only other person I\u2019ve kissed [apart from Beverley] this millennium. You can\u2019t say that, you scarlet woman,\u2019 he teases. Jordan laughs.\n\nOf course, when James started at Cambridge he was a 47-year-old married man with a young family. He won\u2019t be the first middle-aged man to yearn for a carefree youth. Was it a midlife crisis?\n\n\u2018When I went to Cambridge, I had the mindset our marriage could be mended,\u2019 he says. \u2018There hadn\u2019t been any infidelity, we didn\u2019t hate each other and we had three kids so, in my head, it wasn\u2019t entirely broken.\u2019\n\nHe secured a flat in Cambridge so the family could visit and intended to return home at the weekends when his rowing crew was training on the Thames. Three weeks into the university term he broke a rib training.\n\nLast week, the Olympic rower became the first of this year\u2019s crop of celebrity contestants to be voted off the show after achieving the lowest ever score in Strictly history for his jive. For those of us who watched his partner Luba Mushtuk coax him through his dance moves, it was excruciating. Pictured: The pair perform their first dance during week one, a waltz to Gold\n\n\u2018I didn\u2019t row in the boat again until January and had to be in Cambridge for physio and hospital treatment. I\u2019d also really underestimated how hard I\u2019d have to work to get on top of it, academically.\n\n\u2018Yes, I could have dropped out. Was the marriage more important? That\u2019s on me that I didn\u2019t really know. I wanted to prove to myself and to Bev I could cope.\u2019\n\nJames soon realised if he was going to succeed he needed to ask for help. He contacted the physiologist from the British rowing team to help him train with his broken rib and sought Jordan\u2019s help with his studies.\n\n\u2018To be honest, the injury saved my academic course. I had to train on my own so I was in Cambridge a lot more. Jordan was my counsel for many things including statistics, which was a nightmare course \u2014 lots of numbers.\n\n\u2018Spending time with her was refreshing. She and the other friends I made at Cambridge liked me for me. You need confidence to step out of a long-term relationship into No Man\u2019s Land. I realised Bev was right. I thought, \u201cActually, I will be OK, Bev will be OK and the kids will be better.\u201d\n\n\u2018We decided to separate in late November. It had come to the point where Bev and I felt, \u201cWhat example are we showing the kids by having this non-relationship?\u201d\n\n\u2018Once we\u2019d made the decision, we sat the children down and told them because we didn\u2019t want them to have a pretend Christmas and then split up.\u2019\n\nWhen Jordan met James on the first day of term at his college, Peterhouse, she didn\u2019t have a clue he was a feted Olympian or that he\u2019d suffered a brain injury\n\nJames is the sort of man who has \u2018honest\u2019 written through him. He is also \u2018selfish\u2019, \u2018determined\u2019 and \u2018lacking in empathy\u2019 (his words) \u2014 or was. They are qualities that make for a world-class athlete but are not, he says, \u2018the ingredients for a good marriage\u2019.\n\nToday, he can\u2019t put his hand on his heart and say his brain injury is to blame for the end of his marriage, although they were \u2018in a good place before the accident\u2019.\n\n\u2018We were trying for Trixie,\u2019 he says. \u2018Would we have split up sooner after the accident if we hadn\u2019t had kids? Probably yes. I wasn\u2019t that consistent in the year after the accident.\n\n\u2018I became agitated with noise. Noisy mealtimes when kids are being kids didn\u2019t bother me before. Things like that were hard on Bev as well.\n\n\u2018Where I failed after the accident is being present in the room but not really being there. I\u2019d be worried about other stuff, thinking, \u201cYou\u2019ve got three kids you\u2019re responsible for. How are you going to look after them?\u201d\n\n\u2018If I could go back and change one thing it would be that, but part of my make-up is that I try to look after the practical solutions rather than the emotional ones. If I have been upset and cried it\u2019s been because of the impact on our eldest son.\n\n\u2018He was eight when the accident happened and he had a very different dad for the next few years.\n\n\u2018I had an epileptic seizure with him at home and he had to call the ambulance. At ten, you don\u2019t want to see that. So for him it\u2019s been . . .\u2019 James searches for the right word. \u2018Difficult. I really feel for him . . .\u2019 Again, he stops.\n\n\u2018The kids are the most important thing in all of this. Bev and I are still sorting things out to see how we can work as a family unit.\n\n\u2018Next week, Jordan goes back to New York for a few months to work. She can decide whether she wants to be in England and I\u2019ll have time to reform a long-term relationship with the children.\n\n\u2018I think it\u2019ll be healthy for Jordan and me. Cambridge is a very isolated bubble.\u2019 Like Strictly?\n\nHe laughs. \u2018I wasn\u2019t exactly there long enough to find out,\u2019 he says, \u2018but after my tango my son texted, \u201cthat wasn\u2019t great NGL\u201d.\u2019\n\nNGL? \u2018Exactly,\u2019 says James. \u2018I had to ask a young person.\u2019\n\nHe nods at Jordan. \u2018Not going to lie.\u2019", "description": "James Cracknell met Jordan Connell, a 34-year-old American, last October when she arrived in Cambridge to study for an MBA.
