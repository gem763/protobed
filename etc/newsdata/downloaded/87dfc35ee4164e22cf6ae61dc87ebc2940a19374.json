Over the next five weeks experience 25 Reasons to Believe with City Press as we explore the economy, job creation, enterprise development, health, land reform, sustainability, education, technology and \u2013 most important of all \u2013 the communities\n\nA project undertaken by Anglo American Platinum outside Mokopane benefits 42 villages that would often go weeks without the vital resource, writes Poloko Tau\n\nA concrete reservoir perched atop a hill in Mothapodi has added something unique to the skyline of a cluster of villages that surround it. And, importantly, it\u2019s brought great relief for those communities.\n\nThe reservoir was a response by Anglo American Platinum to a request from the community for assistance to deal with an acute water shortage in the Greater Mapela Area, just outside Mokopane in Limpopo.\n\nBoreholes were drilled and infrastructure was built, and water is now pumped up to the reservoir before being directed into a network of pipes and on to different parts of the villages, including Ga-Lelaka, Ga-Chokwe and Ga-Matlou.\n\nIt supplies villages surrounding the company\u2019s Mogalakwena mine. The water project is part of Anglo American\u2019s Sustainable Mining Plan, which includes a commitment to reduce fresh water abstraction by 50% in water-scarce regions.\n\nOne of the residents who led the community\u2019s quest for water, Tlou Kgaphola, who is from Ga-Chokwe village, says life before Anglo American\u2019s intervention was tough.\n\nThe roll-out to all villages was completed earlier this month, and work continues to expand the network to ensure households will ultimately be no further than 200 metres from a tap.\n\n\u201cThe water supplied by the municipality had very low pressure and water was not reaching most of the villages, leaving many of us dry. Those who could afford it paid large amounts for boreholes at their homes,\u201d Kgaphola says.\n\n\u201cWe decided to approach Anglo American Platinum, whose intervention was immediate. While working on the project, the company started paying for trucks to ferry water to different sections of the villages ... this went on for more than a year while the construction work was under way.\u201d\n\nHowever, Kgaphola says, the project was not without challenges and glitches.\n\n\u201cThere were local businesspeople who were not happy that they were not awarded contracts in the project and they attempted to disrupt it. We came together and asked them to put the community first and went to the extent of guarding workers on site just to ensure that there were no disruptions,\u201d he says.\n\nThe roll-out to all villages was completed earlier this month, and work continues to expand the network to ensure households will ultimately be no further than 200 metres from a tap.\n\nAn elderly community member, Sarah Maifala, stands next to a communal tap not far from her house while she waits for her container to fill up.\n\nAnglo American Platinum worked together with the Mapela Task Team, a community stakeholder, to get the water project online. The project was endorsed by the Mogalakwena Local Municipality and became known as Hall Core Water Mapela.\n\n\u201cIt takes a while to fill up because of the pressure, but it is better than nothing because, before we got this water, we had to buy it from neighbours who had boreholes. Things have changed for the better now, except for the low water pressure,\u201d she says.\n\nKgaphola explains the issue with the pressure: \u201cOur problem now is illegal connections, where people are connecting water to their properties, which affects pressure. The set pressure was for a certain number of taps, but now we have extra ones that were not planned for, which has affected the pressure.\u201d\n\nA headman in Ga-Lelaka village, Joseph Lelaka, remembers how life was before the Anglo American water project.\n\n\u201cWe used to go three to four weeks without water and, when the mining company came to our rescue, we all stood up to defend the project \u2013 even against those who put business interests before the community\u2019s. We are really appreciative of what Anglo American has done for us \u2013 making it easier for the members of the community, most of whom were spending money on water that should have been spent on food.\u201d\n\nAnglo American Platinum worked together with the Mapela Task Team, a community stakeholder, to get the water project online. The project was endorsed by the Mogalakwena Local Municipality and became known as Hall Core Water Mapela. This supported the Mapela Traditional Authority in developing a sustainable plan for the region.\n\nHall Core Water Mapela, in which the communities hold a 30% stake via a trust, was tasked with increasing the water supply capacity through drilling and then equipping and maintaining boreholes for 10 years. It is driving the implementation and maintenance of the project, while, Anglo American Platinum paid for the potable water supplied to the community.\n\nAfter being successfully piloted at Schiming village, it now delivers 3.5 million litres a day to the communities, 42 villages that are home to 100 000 people, around Mogalakwena mine.\n\nKgaphola says they plan to extend the project.\n\n\u201cRome was not built in one day, and we\u2019re hopeful the mining company will continue to help us and ease our lives. The plan is to have increased water pressure and bulk supply capacity that will come with the installation of taps in every household in our villages.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the people in these communities can irrigate their crops and supply water for their cattle and goats, which means their income can be used to uplift their families instead of being spent on a resource that is a human right.", "description": "A project outside Mokopane benefits 42 villages that would often go weeks without the vital resource.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9167/c0b55056807646179938b6a44a21cfed.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-07"}
