The single is from her upcoming album Manic, which will be out in 2020.\n\nThe album will be the 25-year-old's third full studio record following 2015's Badlands and 2017's Hopeless Fountain Kingdom.\n\nLeading up to the track\u2019s release, the multi-award-winning singer live-streamed herself painting the cover art for the upcoming album. She then released a time-lapsed version of the livestream featuring the song.\n\nIn the video after Halsey dances with Sydney Sweeney, the actress who portrays Cassie Howard in HBO teen drama Euphoria, she eventually ends up in an aquarium.\n\nIn this way the new clip, set for the most part in a fantasy-like background, ties into the artist's video for Clementine which saw her dancing in an aquarium with another dancer, who is her younger brother Sevian Frangipane.\n\nThe new video was directed by Anton Tammi.\n\nWATCH THE VIDEO HERE:\n\n\n\n", "description": "The actress, who portrays Cassie in the TV show waltzes around a carnival ground with the singer in the video.", "authors": ["Alex Isaacs"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9452/b8b6c3f3cc144fdf8df187d92d595a5c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
