It will be hard for Trump to work with Congress.\n\nShapiro said the looming 2020 election had already hardened the two parties against cooperation. \u201cMaybe impeachment hardens that, [but] it was pretty hard already,\u201d he said.\n\nHouse Democrats disputed the notion that legislative work would cease because of the consideration of impeachment.\n\n\u201cThere is no reason why the business of the American people should not continue,\u201d said Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat of New York.\n\nJeffries, the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, told reporters that both Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton continued to work with Congress at the same time they were facing impeachment. \u201cThe same thing should happen this time around,\u201d Jeffries said.\n\nShapiro is one of the most pessimistic economists on Wall Street, predicting the economy will flat line in 2020. There already have been \u201cearly signs we\u2019re tipping down here,\u201d he said.\n\nEconomists who are arguing the economy is fine are pointing to the payroll report and jobless claims, which, said Shapiro, are \u201ccoincident indicators that can turn on the dime.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIt is like people ahead of the landfall of a hurricane who say it\u2019s beautiful outside.\u201d\n\nWith the economy faltering, the Fed will eventually have to cut interest rates back to basically zero, he said.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s benchmark interest rate is now set in a range of 1.75% to 2%, leaving comparatively little room to push them lower. In every recession since the 1970s, the Fed was able to cut interest rates by more than 500 basis points, noted former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers.\n\nIn an environment of limited Fed ammunition, congressional action might have been helpful, Shapiro said. \u201cAn infrastructure bill would be nice, but they can\u2019t seem to agree on that,\u201d he said.\n\nLewis Alexander, chief U.S. economist at Nomura Securities, noted that Trump and Congress must work together this fall to avoid another government shutdown. Legislation keeping the government open expires on Nov. 21.\n\nRead on: Many legislative efforts in Washington already were effectively dead, analyst notes", "description": "With economy slowing, there was some hope that Congress might try to bolster growth with a stimulus package.
