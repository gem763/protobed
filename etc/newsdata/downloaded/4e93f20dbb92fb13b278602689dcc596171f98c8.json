Bold words, and to some inflammatory. Peterson became a celebrated outcast by saying he wouldn\u2019t do injury to truth (much less grammar) by submitting to a bill that he believes significantly restricts speech, citing his intent to continue to use accurate pronouns to refer to people rather than agreeing to everyone\u2019s \u201cpreferred pronouns,\u201d which often amount to preferred fictions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBuilt around interviews with Peterson, his family, his friends, and his detractors (there is some overlap among these groups), the documentary The Rise of Jordan Peterson is a fair and even-tempered overview of how Peterson became perhaps the most popular professor in North America and the accidental leader of a movement, strongly identified with young men, built around taking responsibility for oneself and carving order out of chaos.\n\nBut first Peterson became a scourge of those who wish to control other people\u2019s words and maybe their thoughts, the \u201cProfessor Against Political Correctness\u201d as he billed himself in his YouTube videos. Provocative and at times pugnacious, Peterson proved to be the man for the moment. Students organized protests against him, and when he sought to speak in public they would drown him out with noise-making devices or speakers blasting death metal. Peterson is shown simply unplugging one such speaker and refusing to shut up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe doc gives plenty of airtime to his ideological opponents, who in interviews say things such as \u201cI was in danger of vomiting all over my keyboard,\u201d as if their inability to control their own digestive tracts is Peterson\u2019s responsibility. \u201cYou hurt my feelings, so I get to lock you up\u201d is an idea that gains traction every day, and Peterson deserves praise for being the rare campus figure to call this absurd. The raving hordes who want ever more restrictive speech codes come off poorly in this movie, but that\u2019s because the movie quotes them fairly.\n\nCo-written and directed by Patricia Marcoccia, The Rise of Jordan Peterson (which is playing in a few theaters and available via video on demand) makes an effort to pierce the increasingly outsized public persona of its subject and \u201cunpack\u201d him, to use a very Peterson-y verb. Courtly and polite, Peterson speaks with a mild, Muppet-y voice, yet can\u2019t resist being nettlesome: Kermit the Firebrand. At times this gentle soul seems like an unlikely candidate to be whipping up opposing armies. He might have preferred to remain focused on his academic work on belief systems, myths, and archetypes. But like many others on the right, Peterson is ultimately motivated by an inability to let bunkum prevail unchallenged. A daughter gives him a psychological test in which Peterson is asked to rate himself in various categories. \u201cYou have no idea how irritated I actually am,\u201d he says, in one revealing moment. He also says he isn\u2019t as eager to quarrel as people think: \u201cThey agitate the hell out of me, but I won\u2019t back away from one [dispute].\u201d There\u2019s an element of fun to it, of course: \u201cI figured out how to monetize social-justice warriors,\u201d he says with a gleam in his eye.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough Marcoccia is largely sympathetic to Peterson, she spends several minutes with a friend and fellow professor, Bernard Schiff, who once shared his home with Peterson\u2019s family and has a transgender child. Schiff has come to regard Peterson as needlessly cruel and even dangerous. Another colleague who remains a friend, Will Cunningham, struggles to reconcile Peterson the public bomb-thrower with the kindly man he knows. \u201cHe does say horrible things sometimes,\u201d notes Cunningham. The doc cites such Petersonisms as \u201cDo feminists avoid criticizing Islam because they unconsciously long for masculine dominance?\u201d In a TV interview, Peterson is seen suggesting that women who wear high heels and makeup are being hypocritical when they complain about workplace sexual harassment. It\u2019s as if the media urged Peterson to become a caricature of a right-winger and Peterson was eager to oblige.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday Peterson has 2.3 million YouTube subscribers and his book 12 Rules for Life continues to be one of the self-help touchstones of this era. He\u2019s hardly infallible on every subject, but his core message is sound and ought to be uncontroversial. Young men approach him not only at speaking engagements but randomly, on the street, to thank him for giving them some purpose. Thanks to Peterson, \u201cClean Your Room\u201d became a meme (and he notes that the only messy room in his house is the one where he keeps all the merchandise inspired by him that people send him; spreading the gospel of tidiness is drowning him in gewgaws). We shouldn\u2019t have arrived at such a state in our culture that Peterson\u2019s directives to \u201cstand up straight\u201d and \u201ctell the truth\u201d seem necessary, much less counterintuitive, but we have, and may Peterson continue to inspire young men to take control of themselves.", "description": "He\u2019s hardly infallible on every subject but his core message is sound, and ought to be uncontroversial.", "authors": ["Kyle Smith", "Zachary Evans", "Kevin D.
