It allowed small businesses to keep income from sources not related to their work inside their corporations \u2014 where it was taxed at a lower rate than it would have been had they counted it toward their personal bottom line.\n\nThe government had argued that allowing that system meant people were incorporating solely for a tax benefit \u2014 but a massive outcry ensued among those who felt the Liberals were branding self-employed Canadians as tax cheats.\n\nThe government subsequently was forced to change its proposed new rules, opting to allow businesses to keep a maximum of $50,000 in passive income before the new taxes kicked in.\n\nScheer said today he would just reverse that policy, and another change the Liberals made around paying dividends to family members.\n\nHe said he also would appoint an expert panel to review the entire tax system in order to modernize it, find a way to help businesses better navigate the tax system and reduce regulations by 25 per cent over four years; regulations to be cut would be identified after a review. He said he'd assign a minister specifically to cut regulation.\n\nScheer is campaigning today in southwestern Ontario, making his tax announcement in St. Catharines before moving on to Waterloo and London, Ont.", "description": "Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer is pledging to repeal changes to the tax system that led to a near war between small business and the Liberal government two years ago.", "authors": ["The Canadian Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5295221.1569335401!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/fedelxn-conservatives-20190922.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
