A third focused on the whisteblower\u2019s complaints, describing the effort to \u201clock down\u201d call records.\n\n\u201cWhistleblower alleges coverup\u201d read the Wall Street Journal\u2019s top article. \u201cSome allies of the Republican president fretted privately that the complaint and the coming House impeachment proceedings could damage Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election prospects, even as the president and his advisers publicly argued that Democrats were overreaching and would face a backlash from voters,\u201d the article states.\n\nThe role played by Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer and the former New York City mayor, also was explored.\n\n\u201cUkrainians seeking influence in Washington viewed him as a direct conduit to Mr. Trump. And when Mr. Giuliani\u2019s actions were in conflict with the U.S. government\u2019s national-security and foreign-policy apparatus, it was unable and at times unwilling to deter him. Some senior government officials knew little, if anything, of his work,\u201d the article stated.\n\nThe Miami Herald produced a local angle \u2014 the two South Florida businessmen who were mentioned in the whistleblower\u2019s complaint, albeit not by name. The newspaper reached one of them, Lev Parnas, who said it was his duty to turn over damaging information on former Vice President Joe Biden. Parnas and Igor Fruman, both big Republican donors, helped introduce Giuliani into top Ukrainian political circles, the article said.\n\nThe Washington Post headline read, \u201cTrump, GOP hit back as coverup is alleged.\u201d The president\u2019s playbook, and that of his party, are scorched Earth, the newspaper writes.\n\n\u201cTrump has acted impulsively and indignantly as he wages an all-out political war to defend himself from allegations that he abused his power to solicit foreign interference in his 2020 reelection bid,\u201d the article by Robert Costa and Philip Rucker says. \u201cAnd in a testament to how completely he controls the Republican Party, many GOP officeholders and conservative media figures have followed Trump\u2019s cues by joining his attempts either to attack the anonymous whistleblower, discredit the explosive accounts in their complaint, or malign the media for covering it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhistleblower claimed that Trump abused his office and that White House officials tried to cover it up\u201d and \u201cWhistleblower painstakingly gathered material and almost single-handedly set impeachment in motion\u201d also make the Post\u2019s front page.", "description": "The whisteblower\u2019s complaint that was declassified and released publicly led America\u2019s top newspapers on Friday.", "authors": ["Steve Goldstein", "European Markets Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS179_nyt_co_MG_20190927040531.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
