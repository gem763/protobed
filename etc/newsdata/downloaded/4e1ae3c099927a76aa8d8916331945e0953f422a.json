Pictured, Jaywick\n\nThe study, led by University College London, is the first to collect data on the effects of the neighbourhood over the course of a lifetime.\n\nLead author Dr Stephen Jivraj said: 'The link between where you live and your health and well-being has been one of the most widely tested hypotheses in the field of health geography for 20 years.\n\n'Our study reviews data collected over time and shows the negative health effects of living in a deprived area increase as people get older.\n\n'We suspect this cumulative effect occurs because it gets harder to move to a less deprived neighbourhood, the older you get.'\n\nThe review of 53 studies includes data from countries including the US, UK, Finland, Japan, Sweden and New Zealand.\n\nPEOPLE IN DEPRIVED AREAS GET CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS 10 YEARS EARLIER People who live in the most deprived areas in England can expect to have two or more health conditions at 61 years, which is 10 years earlier than people in the least deprived areas, according to research carried out by the Health Foundation in 2018. They found almost a third (30 per cent) of people with four or more conditions are under 65 and this percentage is higher for people living in socioeconomically deprived areas. It suggests that living with multiple conditions affects a broad range of people and is not always related to old age. The analysis found approximately 14.2million people have two or more conditions, costing the NHS a staggering amount of money. The figure represents nearly a quarter (24 per cent) of all adults living in England. Over half (55 per cent) of hospital admissions and outpatient visits and three quarters (75 per cent) of primary care prescriptions are for people living with two or more conditions. The number of people living with multiple conditions is expected to continue to grow. Sarah Deeny, assistant director of Data Analytics at the Health Foundation said: 'People\u2019s health is a result of a wide range of social determinants including their quality of housing and education, where they live, access to good quality work and affordable food.'

Pictured, Jaywick\n\nPremature death was the most common poor health outcome recorded for those living in a deprived neighbourhood in 18 per cent of the studies. Pictured, Jaywick\n\n'But generally we know that people in these neighbourhoods have less money, which affects how in control of your life you feel.\n\n'Eating healthily is more expensive. And we know a safe, warm house is fundamental for health, too.\n\n'Being unemployed or on a zero-hour type contract isn't good for your health either. In more deprived areas, work-life balance may not be as good.'\n\nThe thinktank's own research has found stark differences in healthy life expectancy \u2013 the number of years you can expect to live in good health \u2013 between poor and affluent areas.\n\nMr Elwell-Sutton said: 'The healthy life expectancy in men and women in the most deprived 10 per cent of communities is 52 years.\n\n'It's over 70 years in the top 10 per cent of affluent areas. 52 years is a long time before people expect to retire.'\n\nDr Jivraj said: 'We believe policy makers need to urgently put more resource into improving deprived neighbourhoods.\n\n'Doing this as early in people's lifespans as possible would have the greatest public health improvement.'\n\nMr Elwell-Sutton said a joint effort needs to be seen between the Government and local communities.\n\nHe said: 'It's really important for governments to invest in things that support local communities, such as community centres, youth centres and parks.\n\n'It's quite hard to measure their impact in the short term. So when budgets are cut, those are the first things to go.'", "description": "The University College London findings come just days after Jaywick, a town in Essex, was named as the most deprived neighbourhood in England for the third time.", "authors": ["Vanessa Chalmers Health Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/01/13/18966836-0-image-a-2_1569931983443.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
