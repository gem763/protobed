All should start against Brighton.\n\nEmerson Palmieri is out for four weeks with a thigh issue while Andreas Christensen limped out of that Liverpool defeat, which means Marcos Alonso and Kurt Zouma are likely to come in to the starting lineup.\n\nManchester City (vs Everton)\n\nManchester City dismissed any talk of a crisis by thumping Watford last weekend, with Fernandinho looking rather comfortable in the back four as a makeshift centre-back.\n\nFit-again Benjamin Mendy will be looking for a long run at left-back, and seeking to put an eventful week behind him, with team mate Bernardo Silva unlikely to be taken out of the firing line after his controversial social media post about the French defender.\n\nRaheem Sterling should return to the front three after missing out against Watford.\n\nManchester United (vs Arsenal)\n\nManchester United will be looking to get back on track after losing to West Ham, and precocious forward talent Mason Greenwood may make his first Premier League start with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer short of striking options.\n\nPaul Pogba is a doubt for the game after taking a bang to his ankle on his return against Rochdale.\n\nSolskjaer has suggested that neither Anthony Martial nor Marcus Rashford will be able to start, and both may be entirely absent.\n\nArsenal (vs Manchester United)\n\nArsenal may also call upon a starlet in forward areas \u2013 Bukayo Saka has impressed in the last couple of weeks and may join Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Nicolas Pepe in the front three.\n\nKieran Tierney finally made his Arsenal debut after a summer of injury rehab against Nottingham Forest in the Carabao Cup, and the Scottish left-back may start again at Old Trafford.\n\nCallum Chambers appears to have found a home at right-back, too.", "description": "Midweek Carabao Cup exertions concluded, it is straight back into\u00a0English Premier League action this weekend, with the big six involved in some intriguing fixtures.
