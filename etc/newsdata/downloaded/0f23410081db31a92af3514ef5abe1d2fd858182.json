Aside from one unfortunately carpeted room, the floors in my new place are original hardwood, with tile in the kitchen and bathroom. Dream come true, right? Yes, except because it\u2019s Minnesota, we\u2019ve found ourselves battling a slushy, mucky film of salt, sand, snow, and ice. Back in our old New York apartment, we were slaves to the Swiffer. The dry pads were never very good at picking up dirt or pet hair; the wet pads were fine at wiping up a spill here and there, but we\u2019d go through three disposable pads just to mop one room. Now that we\u2019re in a larger space, I wanted to find a more ecofriendly and cost-effective alternative to my old Swiffer habit.\n\nThe Bona mop that comes as part of the multi-care kit covers way more ground than a Swiffer.\n\nEnter Bona. The family-owned company was founded in 1919 and has its headquarters in Sweden. When I started researching it, I was surprised to learn that a number of prominent janitorial staffs are loyal to Bona: Nike World Headquarters in Oregon, the National Portrait Gallery in London, the Singapore Art Museum. Bona bonus: The formula is nontoxic and pet-friendly \u2014 good news for my licks-everything Chihuahua.\n\nI sprang for the Bona Multi-Surface Floor Care Kit, which came with everything I needed: an easy-to-assemble mop, microfibre cleaning pad, full-size spray bottle of Bona\u2019s signature hardwood floor cleaner, a separate cleaner for stone, tile, and laminate, and two concentrate refills. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m typing this, but the Bona made mopping kinda fun. The flat-head mop is wider than a Swiffer, covering more ground faster while still swiveling under furniture and into hard-to-reach corners. The microfibre pad gripped the mop firmly and didn\u2019t get filthy as fast as the Swiffer pads do: I mopped both the living and dining rooms before stopping to clean the pad and reattach it. That action alone addressed my biggest beef with the Swiffer. Instead of tossing the dirty pad like a dryer sheet and pulling out a new one every 3 to 4.5 meters, I rinse it in the sink and use it again. Or, if it gets super-grungy, I can throw it in the laundry. (It\u2019s good for up to 300 washes.)\n\nOf course, none of this would matter if the Bona did a crap job cleaning the floors. But the Bona scoured my floors as well as any traditional string mop or sponge mop with a built-in wringer, and definitely better than a Swiffer. No streaking or sticky residue either. I doubt I\u2019ll ever be domesticated enough to mop regularly (once a week, Martha \u2014 really?), but at least the Bona makes it a little less painful.\n\nA Swiffer replacement for upholstery\n\nEvercare Mega Cleaning Roller If you\u2019re looking for something to remove pet hair or dust on sofas and rugs, writer Hilary Reid discovered a \u2018broom\u2019 that\u2019s essentially a giant sticky roller: \u201cThe jumbo lint roller on a long stick quickly became the essential cleaning tool I never knew I needed. Here\u2019s how it works: Extend the handle to a comfortable length, and then roll the sticky adhesive part across the rug, so that it picks up hair, dirt, and whatever else is lurking within. Once the adhesive sheet is covered, tear it off and begin again. Roll and repeat, until you\u2019ve finished its surface area.\u201d \u00a331 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
