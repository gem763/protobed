Trump even told special counsel Robert S. Mueller III that his infamous request to Russia to find Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201cmissing\u201d emails was a joke. That Capitol Hill Republicans would go back to this well is no surprise; it\u2019s an easy dodge when, according to The Post\u2019s Robert Costa and Philip Rucker, GOP lawmakers and aides say privately that their \u201ccollective strategy is simply to survive and not make any sudden moves.\u201d\n\nThe difference this time is that the president himself isn\u2019t claiming that he was joking, not in any of his numerous Twitter missives since that South Lawn appearance. Instead, he laid into criticism from Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) about his request to China. And Sunday afternoon he said on Twitter that he would \u201cwould LOVE running\u201d against Biden.\n\nNot only wasn\u2019t Trump joking about asking China to investigate Biden, he isn\u2019t pretending that he was. In other words, Republican politicians don\u2019t want you to believe the president.", "description": "", "authors": ["James Downie", "Washingtonpost.Com Opinions New-Gop-Strategy-Dont-Believe-President"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
