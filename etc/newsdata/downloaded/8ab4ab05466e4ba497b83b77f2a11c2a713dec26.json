I'm just I'm just dipping my toe in the water so to speak but I'm going to get better.\"\n\n'Chilled moshing'\n\nYou can find plenty of evidence of the more liberated moments of Easy Life's \"messy\" tour on the band's Twitter account, courtesy of a video diary made by their best mate and \"talented videographer\" Fozza.\n\nIn truth, the chilled minimal grooves of many of their early releases, including Nightmares, Pockets their first Hottest Record - the environmentally conscious Earth, don't seem to lend themselves naturally to a sweaty mosh-pit rave.\n\nAs their fanbase has grown, however, this added element of jeopardy seems to have arrived with them mysteriously.\n\n\"You know what, I actually have no idea [how that happened],\" shrugs the puzzled trumpet-playing singer/rapper. \"We did not start this culture of stage diving and moshing and all that stuff that kids like to do.\n\n\"Genuinely the first time that happened we stopped the song and we were like 'what are you doing?' Because it was in a particularly chilled song of ours called OJPL [orange juice and pink lemonade] and live we do like this little jazz break, where there's not even any drums and the whole crowd just like collapsed on one another.\n\n\"We were like 'you know we're at 82 BPM right now? You need to calm down!'\n\n\"When we perform I jump around very very occasionally but a lot of it is quite static and I don't know why but people just get down. I really don't know why or how, but I love that they do.\"\n\nNew track Nice Guys - the second song of the band's this year to be named by Radio 1 as a Hottest Record - finds them pick up the pace somewhat to a relatively almighty 114 BPM. But on the whole, as they gear up for their debut album, the band seem to be manoeuvring in a lane of their own, switching speeds, guitars, brass and beats at will.\n\nThe Easy Life mantra is to make your own kind of music, or you'll end up making things hard for yourself.\n\n\"I think it's just authenticity,\" Matravers concludes. \"And just being really real with what it is you're trying to do, is the most important thing.\n\n\"I think too many people trying to write 'pop music' in very inverted commas and I was guilty of that myself. I've been writing music since I can remember and a lot of the time I was not doing it for the right reasons.\n\n\"And then as soon as I started this project, I was like 'you know what? I'm going to just do this for me.' I was so done with the whole music thing, and that was when I started working for me, ironically.\n\n\"Do it for the love of the music and without trying to sound like a hippie, if you're doing that then then I think you'll always be happy.\"\n\nEspecially if you're only in your pants.\n\nEasy Life's new single Nice Guys is out now and BBC Music Introducing Live takes place from Thursday 31 October to Sunday 3 November.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.
