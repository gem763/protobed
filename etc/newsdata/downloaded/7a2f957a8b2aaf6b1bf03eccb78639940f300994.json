A daycare centre at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland - the home of Air Force One - will also have its funds diverted, the Pentagon said.\n\nTrump declared a national emergency earlier this year to access the funds from the military construction budget. In March, the Pentagon sent to Congress a broad list of projects that could be affected.\n\nA Pentagon official said in a briefing that the department was given a \u201clawful order\u201d by Trump to divert the funds. She said the Pentagon is working closely with Congress and its allies abroad to find funding to replace money diverted for the wall, but that there are not any guarantees that those funds will come.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Pentagon said the first $1.8 billion would come from projects outside the United States, followed by projects inside the country.\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said the Trump administration\u2019s reallocation of funds was a \u201cslap in the face\u201d to members of the U.S. military. The U.S. Military Academy at West Point in Schumer\u2019s state is the most expensive project impacted in the United States with $95 million pulled from construction on its engineering centre.\n\nThe list of affected projects also includes roads, maintenance shops, equipment storage buildings and hazardous material warehouses.\n\nThe wall was a central promise of Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign and remains central to his immigration policies as he aims for re-election in 2020.\n\nSome $30 million in funds for an equipment building at Fort Huachuca in southern Arizona will be diverted to pay for the wall.\n\nRepublican U.S. Senator Martha McSally of Arizona said she fought to ensure no projects in her state would be affected and was guaranteed of that by former acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan. She said in a statement the Fort Huachuca project was already delayed.\n\nHouse of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a call with fellow Democrats on Tuesday that the diversion of military funds \u201cwill undermine our national security, quality of life and morale of our troops, and that indeed makes America less safe,\u201d according to an aide.", "description": "The Pentagon said on Wednesday it would pull funding from 127 Defense Department projects, including schools and daycare centres for military families, as it diverts $3.6 billion to fund President Donald Trump's wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.", "authors": ["Bryan Pietsch", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1426286556&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF832AE"}
