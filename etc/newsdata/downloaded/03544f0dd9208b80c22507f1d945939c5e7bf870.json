What else would account for a doctor who collected thousands of dead babies in some kind of twisted hobby that he hid from his allegedly unsuspecting wife?\n\nTwo thousand two hundred and forty-six fetuses were found \u201cmedically preserved\u201d in Ulrich Klopfer\u2019s garage last week after he died on Sept. 3. And now the attorneys general of Illinois and Indiana are investigating how the human remains got from Klopfer\u2019s network of Indiana abortion clinics to his rural Illinois home and what laws might have been violated.\n\nKlopfer isn\u2019t the only abortionist to enjoy keeping trophies of his grisly work close at hand. America\u2019s most infamous baby killer, Kermit Gosnell, also kept fetal body parts in \u201cmilk jugs and glass jars\u201d at his clinic in Philadelphia before he was convicted in 2013 on three counts of murder for snipping the spinal cords of babies born alive.\n\nLike Gosnell, Klopfer\u2019s clinics shut down after state inspectors found worrying medical and record-keeping problems.\n\nWhile Klopfer is not alleged to have been a murderer, his ethical standards appear not to have been very high. In defending himself and his clinics against state allegations, the Illinois physician recounted how he performed an abortion on a 10-year-old girl who was raped by her uncle, never reporting the crime to police and, as a result, helping her parents cover up the atrocity by a family member. State officials cited the sickening defense as part of their reason for stripping him of his medical license. He was previously charged with failing to report performing abortions on two 13-year-olds.\n\nAccording to a complaint filed by the Indiana Medical Licensing Board, Klopfer worked in clinics in South Bend, Gary and Fort Wayne from 2012 to 2015.\n\nWith thousands of ghoulishly stored dead bodies straight out of a horror movie, medical malpractice and a multistate mystery, you\u2019d think the news media would be all over this story. Not so much.\n\nAt my request, the conservative Media Research Center looked into coverage of Klopfer and found little interest. No coverage on the nightly broadcast news. Nothing on MSNBC. A story on CNN and a few on Fox News. National newspapers each handled it with one or two stories.\n\nAnd while this case is unique, it is not like there aren\u2019t regular reports of shady doings at the nation\u2019s abortion clinics. In the six years since Gosnell\u2019s conviction, abortion clinics have been shut down and others have been cited for serious medical problems.\n\nOnly last month, Planned Parenthood Arizona was ordered to pay $3 million to a whistleblower who was fired after she reported that a doctor appeared to be making medical mistakes resulting in complications for patients at one of its facilities.\n\nMore typical is a 2016 Washington Post story about a local abortion clinic cited for \u201cdirty equipment, expired medication in unlocked cabinets, lax storage of medical records and a failure of staff to sterilize and maintain medical equipment and follow hand-washing protocols.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn one case,\u201d The Post reported, \u201ca patient had to be rushed to a local emergency room for prolonged bleeding after sutures were not available at the clinic. \u2026 In another, a nurse used a plunger to unstop a toilet and then held a patient\u2019s hand during a surgical procedure without changing scrubs.\u201d\n\nThe doctor who owned that clinic already had his medical license temporarily suspended, relinquished or revoked or has faced criminal charges in New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Florida and California.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to be curious about. How does a doctor get in trouble in five states and yet remain an abortionist in other states that claim to care about women? Why would Planned Parenthood fire a 15-year employee rather than address concerns for patient safety? How does a doctor amass enough dead bodies in his garage to do a passable imitation of a World War II mass grave? Didn\u2019t his employees notice he was taking home baby parts?\n\nHow does a story this sensational \u2014 that happens to have partly taken place in presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg\u2019s hometown, where he's the mayor \u2014 not get more than cursory attention from the national news media? Now there\u2019s a question.\n\nDavid Mastio is deputy editorial page editor of USA TODAY.
