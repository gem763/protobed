He was subsequently sentenced to a decade in prison but had been slated to be released as early as later this year.\n\n\u201cUntil future hearings we will not know what Jeremy\u2019s sanctions for contempt could be. We also do not know what questions the grand jury is investigating. What we do not know, however, is whether or not the federal prison sentence he was serving for which he was due to be released from just two short months from now, will be suspended as the result of sanctions imposed for being found in civil contempt,\u201d his supporters said in the statement.\n\n\u201cThe decision to compel Jeremy to testify despite his outspoken, long-standing anarchist beliefs and support for myriad brave grand jury resistors, only to place him under contempt when he adheres to those same core beliefs should be seen as little more than cruel and punitive,\u201d the statement said.\n\nFederal prosecutors in Alexandria have charged WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, a 48-year-old Australia native, with several counts related to different material his website published dating back to 2010, including a trove of classified military and diplomatic documents provided by former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning. He is currently jailed in London fighting a U.S. extradition request.\n\nManning, 31, served roughly seven years in prison for convictions related to disclosing documents to WikiLeaks. She finished her sentence in 2017, but she was recently found in contempt for similarly refusing to cooperate with grand jury proceedings and has been jailed ever since.\n\nU.S. Attorney G. Zachary Terwilliger previously said that Manning\u2019s testimony remains \u201cessential\u201d to an ongoing investigation into charges or targets not listed in the counts already announced against Assange.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
