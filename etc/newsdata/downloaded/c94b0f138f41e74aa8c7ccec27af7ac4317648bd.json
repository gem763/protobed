I\u2019ll be back in the States this week and he\u2019s number four on the Billboard Hot 100 and he\u2019s flying again.\n\n\u2018Billie Eilish is just the best thing to happen to the music industry in a long time and this is why I\u2019m so excited to get back into it, because I turn on the TV and watch these awards shows and all that and I feel like I\u2019m missing out, like \u201cthat used to be me!\u201d.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNiall also revealed that he sends his new music to his friends in the industry \u2013 none other than Lewis and Shawn Mendes \u2013 to get their honest opinions on his work.\n\n\u2018Yeah, I definitely do,\u2019 he told the Capital Evening Show with Jimmy Hill. \u2018Other artists, like, me and Shawn always \u2013 Shawn Mendes \u2013 that was quite a name drop! \u201cOh me and Shawn!

Same with Lewis [Capaldi].\n\n\u2018Lewis has got a really good ear and obviously I mean, the guy\u2019s got hits coming out of his ears, but he\u2019s got a really similar type thing so I\u2019ll always play them to him.
