Anger boiled over on Friday, leading to the ransacking of high-end shops in Beirut and the death of one man in the northern city of Tripoli.\n\nSince then, the protests have settled into large peaceful gatherings that have crossed sectarian and social lines and continued to grow in size and energy as Lebanese leaders struggled to formulate a response.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Lebanese women take part in a protest in Beirut on Sunday.

Sheikh Fadi Saad, a Shia cleric, said: \u201cI am a man of God. I must stand with the people. All politicians and all the sects they represent are corrupt. I have two sons, one in Lyon and one in Versaille; why should they be working there? There is no dignity left in this country.\u201d\n\nWhile demonstrations are not uncommon in Lebanon, crowds of this size taking to the streets for such a duration have not been seen since the so-called Cedar revolution of 2005, which led to Syrian forces leaving the country after 15 years of post-civil war involvement in its neighbour\u2019s affairs.\n\nThat moment was supposed to usher in a new era of governance in which local officials were freer to manage national affairs. Instead, rampant corruption and nepotism have taken hold across state institutions and the gap between a privileged elite and the rest of the country has widened.\n\nLebanon\u2019s economy, meanwhile, has neared a precipice with a national debt of 150% of GDP and rising, central bank reserves plunging 30% in the past year and the local currency slipping against the dollar in recent months.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Protesters in the northern city of Tripoli on Sunday.

The hidden hand ... is actually just our dignity that woke up. We\u2019ve been silent and sedated for so long, we\u2019ve now awakened. They are not used to us, the people, having pride. But we\u2019ll show them.\u201d\n\nA devaluation against the dollar is widely viewed as a tipping point by economists and diplomats. They have urged Lebanese leaders to introduce deep structural reforms to free up revenues and pave the way for $11bn in soft loans and grants that could stimulate a moribund economy.\n\nThe aid package was put together by France, which has insisted on tangible efforts to change a deeply entrenched patronage network, which has seen political leaders siphon of billions of dollars of state revenues to use to pay benefactors and secure votes.\n\nA woman in downtown Beirut, who did not want to be identified, said: \u201cSomeone should a page out of [the Saudi crown prince] Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s book and imprison all our thieves, as he did with his men at the Ritz in Saudi. Our politicians have no mercy. They steal our salaries and livelihood. I have a son. I can barely afford to send him to school. Why can\u2019t I send him to school? Why don\u2019t I have insurance? Why don\u2019t I have electricity? Why is the garbage on my street? Our youth is drugged out due to unemployment, our parents are dying because we cannot afford decent healthcare. I hope we can all flee and leave this land of ash to them.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Protesters hold placards in downtown Beirut on Sunday.

They\u2019re not only stealing, they\u2019re stealing shamelessly. It\u2019s got to a point where they\u2019re literally the cause of cancer in people. All politicians are staying much longer than they deserve, and when they leave we have to deal with their children.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t afford my daily life, I can\u2019t afford to be in love, I can\u2019t afford to marry, I can\u2019t afford to take care of my own. This is why we\u2019re protesting. I can\u2019t give loyalty to those who can\u2019t feed me any more.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting: Nadia al-Faour", "description": "Dissent gains momentum with country\u2019s largest protests since Cedar revolution of 2005", "authors": ["Martin Chulov"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/871c4914cc608c0d4d822dd7356fd788d8ac236f/0_99_4424_2655/master/4424.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b0d4a5b3ce5e6aa5856dafc19dd030f7", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
