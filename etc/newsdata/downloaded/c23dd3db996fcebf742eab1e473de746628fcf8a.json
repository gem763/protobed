In his song \u201cFramed,\u201d Eminem rapped:\n\nDonald Duck\u2019s on as the Tonka Truck in the yard\n\nBut dog how the fuck is Ivanka Trump in the trunk of my car\n\nGotta get to the bottom of it to try to solve it\n\nMust go above and beyond, \u2019cause it\u2019s incumbent upon\n\nMe, \u2019cause I feel somewhat responsible for the dumb little blonde girl\n\nThat motherfuckin\u2019 baton twirler that got dumped in the pond\n\nThe Grammy-winner also talks about making a sexual pass at Melania Trump in his song \u201cOffended\u201d:\n\nIvanka, stiff arm her\n\nWhile I\u2019m hittin\u2019 on Melania\n\nAnd this song\u2019s for all ya.\n\nThe documents state that on the day \u201cRevival\u201d and the aforementioned tracks were released back in December 2017, a \u201cconcerned citizen\u201d reported Mathers to authorities over a possible threat posed lyrics. That individual was, in fact, an employee of the gossip and entertainment website TMZ.\n\n\u201cThis is not the first time MATHERS made threatening comments towards POTUS and his family,\u201d the TMZ employee noted in their complaint. \u201cIn June 2017, MATHERS freestyled comments that were threatening in nature towards POTUS.\u201d\n\nAlthough Secret Service officials did not respond to the TMZ at the time, the documents confirm that the Protective Intelligence and Assessment Division consequently conducted a background check and arranged an interview with his lawyers soon afterward.\n\nDuring the interview last January, Mathers was reportedly \u201cfamiliar [with] the song and began [to] rap along with the interviewers as the verse was read.\u201d However, authorities decided against referring him to a federal prosecutor.\n\n\u201cAt the conclusion of the interview, Agents again offered to answer any questions. It was also explained that any additional questions about this investigation should be directed to the USSS [United States Secret Service] Office of Government and Public Affairs. Counsel then escorted Agents from Mather\u2019s office,\u201d the documents read.\n\nLast year, U.S. Secret Service agents interviewed actor Tom Arnold at his home after he challenged the president to a one-on-one fight at one of his rallies.\n\n\u201cThank you US Secret Service for risking your lives keeping democracy safe,\u201d Arnold said in a statement following the interview. \u201cI appreciate you coming to my home on what must\u2019ve been a busy day. I heard your message loud & clear. Words matter. Tone matters. Words can incite violence. Be responsible.\u201d\n\nMy statement about the Secret Service visit to my house: pic.twitter.com/BFOht796aW \u2014 Tom Arnold (@TomArnold) November 26, 2018\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "Left-wing rap superstar Eminem was reportedly interviewed by the Secret Service\u00a0over \"threatening\" lyrics against\u00a0President Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/eminemservice1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
