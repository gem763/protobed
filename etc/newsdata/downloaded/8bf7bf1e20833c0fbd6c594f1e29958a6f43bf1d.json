The heaviest and most frequent showers will be over western UK, especially western Scotland, whilst some eastern parts of England and Scotland may stay mostly dry.\n\nTonight:\n\nClear spells and blustery showers, western Scotland and the far southwest of England and Wales likely seeing the heaviest showers. Becoming drier in some eastern parts of the UK. Windy.\n\nWednesday:\n\nWindy with a mixture of sunny spells and showers. Western UK can expect the heaviest and most frequent showers whilst parts of eastern England and eastern Scotland may stay dry.\n\nOutlook for Thursday to Saturday:\n\nStaying unsettled with showers or longer spells of rain for all areas.
