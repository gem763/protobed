The Australian Treasurer has just endorsed Australian house prices to go much higher.\n\nSpeaking directly to the property industry on Thursday, Josh Frydenberg emphasised the attractiveness of soaring prices.\n\n\u201cTreasury estimates a 10 per cent increase in house prices could lift GDP by 1 per cent,\u201d he told the AFR Property Summit in Sydney on Thursday, citing the \u201cstrong link between changes in the property market and consumer behaviour.\u201d\n\nWhile economists have poured cold water on the assumption that prices could lift by that margin in already unaffordable capital cities like Sydney and Melbourne, Frydenberg identified a few key drivers that could push them higher.\n\n\u201cBetween 2005 and 2015, the population grew by 1.7 per cent per year or 3.7 million persons\u2026 the fastest average rate of growth in our population, sustained over a ten year period, since the 1970s,\u201d the Treasurer said.\n\nMeanwhile, the supply side looks to stay constrained in the short term.\n\n\u201cDwelling investment is forecast in the 2019-20 Budget to fall by 7 per cent in 2019-20 and by a further 4 per cent in 2020-21, as existing projects are completed and recent weakness in building approvals flows through to activity,\u201d Frydenberg said.\n\nThat could see prices again take off as supply lags and demand eats up any spare capacity in the market. A similar situation helped support price growth leading up to the market peak in 2017.\n\nThat saw combined capital city prices increase by more than 50%, Frydenberg noted. While the ensuing positive wealth effect had a strong flow-on effect to the economy it also shot the median house price in Sydney from $600,000 to $1 million, according to Treasury.\n\nAs wage growth grew by just a fraction of that rate, those same cities became enormously unaffordable at the same time that property investors profited.\n\nHowever, the relationship between higher prices and the economy is not nearly as positive as the Treasurer has presented it to be, according to IFM Investors chief economist Alex Joiner, who said that \u201cthe negative impact of the debt that pushes up those prices is so readily discounted\u201d.\n\n\u201cA 1% increase in household debt lowers GDP growth in the long run by 0.1% and this impact intensifies as household debt to GDP exceeds 70% \u2013 Australia is at 120%,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cThe implications for policymakers is clear but seemingly ignored.\u201d\n\nWork from @stlouisfed and @BIS_org speaks volumes \u2013 a 1ppt increase in HH debt lowers GDP growth in the long run by 0.1ppt and this impact intensifies as HH debt to GDP exceeds 70% \u2013 Australia is at 120% \u2013 the implications for policy makers is clear but seemingly ignored #ausbiz pic.twitter.com/AhPtVU97lO \u2014 Alex Joiner (@IFM_Economist) September 26, 2019\n\nAnd yet, besides acknowledging that 80% of household debt is tied up in the property market, the Treasurer was silent on the potential consequences of increased debt.\n\nNow, after a couple of years of orderly declines, house prices look to be rising again.\n\n\u201cGiven the key relationship between the health of the housing market and the wider economy, it is important that we continue to support the recovery that is underway,\u201d Frydenberg said.\n\nCertainly, he and the Reserve Bank of Australia are doing their bit to stimulate the market, with the expectation of two further rate cuts only likely to add further fuel to that fire.\n\n\u201cThis stabilisation in the housing sector has occurred against the backdrop of the Federal election, a continuation of strong jobs growth, the passage through the Parliament of the largest tax cuts in more than twenty years and two interest rate cuts by the Reserve Bank,\u201d Frydenberg said.\n\n\u201cNoting that it typically takes around one to two years for the full effect of changes in monetary policy to flow through the economy, we should expect the two interest rate cuts by the Reserve Bank to continue to support demand for housing,\u201d he said, adding he was \u201coptimistic\u201d about the market.\n\nHowever, with household debt already at eye-watering levels, it\u2019s not clear whether higher prices would continue to flow through the economy. Pointing to the same pressure on households, AMP Capital chief economist Shane Oliver has previously told Business Insider Australia that any subsequent bounce in major markets will be more modest.\n\nAs affordability wallows in capital cities, there will be many who will hope Oliver is right.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
