GLOBAL MARKETS-Stocks make cautious gains ahead of key Brexit summit\n\n* Asian stock markets: https://tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4\n\n* Equities eke out gains\n\n* Sentiment still fragile due to U.S.-China trade war\n\n* Policymakers struggle to reduce risks to global economy\n\nBy Stanley White\n\nTOKYO, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Asian stocks and Wall Street\n\nfutures inched higher on Tuesday as some investors held out hope\n\nthat Britain still had a chance to avoid a messy exit from the\n\nEuropean Union at key negotiations this week.\n\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan\n\nwas up 0.01%. Australian shares were up\n\n0.12%, while Japan's Nikkei stock index rose 1.38%.\n\nCapping the broader gains, however, was a perceived lack of\n\nprogress coming out of U.S.-China trade negotiations. Reports of\n\na \"Phase 1\" trade deal between the United States and China last\n\nweek had earlier cheered markets but the dearth of details\n\naround the agreement has since curbed this enthusiasm with oil\n\nprices extending declines and the safe-haven yen holding gains\n\nversus dollar.\n\nThe focus has now shifted to Europe where officials from\n\nBritain and the EU will meet at a make-or-break summit on\n\nThursday and Friday that will determine whether or not Britain\n\nis headed for a so-called no-deal Brexit.\n\n\"Given the parliamentary intervention, I would say the\n\nchance of a no-deal Brexit is around 10% to 20%,\" said Shane\n\nOliver, head of investment strategy and chief economist at AMP\n\nCapital Investors in Sydney.\n\n\"If there is a deal, sterling would rally and risk assets\n\nwould rally, but the reaction could be limited to a day.\"\n\nU.S. stock futures rose 0.19% on Tuesday in Asia\n\nafter the S&P 500 ended 0.14% lower.\n\nTraders, however, cautioned that sentiment remains fragile\n\nbecause the outcome of Brexit talks is far from certain and the\n\nU.S.-China trade war remains a risk to global growth.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to strike an exit\n\ndeal at an EU summit on Thursday and Friday to allow an orderly\n\ndeparture on Oct. 31. The main sticking point remains the border between EU member\n\nIreland and Northern Ireland, which belongs to the UK. Some EU\n\npoliticians have expressed guarded optimism that a deal can be\n\nreached.\n\nHowever, diplomats from the EU have indicated they are\n\npessimistic about Johnson's proposed solution for the border and\n\nwant more concessions.\n\nIn the currency market, sterling GBP=D3 held steady at\n\n$1.2608, below a three-month high of $1.2708.\n\nThe yen JPY=EBS , often considered a safe haven in times of\n\neconomic uncertainty, edged higher to 108.40 per dollar.\n\nA perceived lack of progress in resolving a prolonged trade\n\nrow between the United States and China also weighed on investor\n\nconfidence.\n\nThe United States agreed to delay an Oct. 15 increase in\n\ntariffs on Chinese goods while Beijing said it would buy as much\n\nas $50 billion of U.S. agricultural products after tense\n\nnegotiations last week.\n\nHowever, the United States has left in place tariffs on\n\nhundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese goods.\n\nTrade experts and China market analysts say chances are high\n\nthat Washington and Beijing will fail to agree on any specifics\n\n- as happened in May - in time for a mid-November meeting\n\nbetween Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nU.S. crude dipped 0.22% to $53.47 following a 2%\n\ndecline overnight due to worries that global energy demand will\n\nremain weak.\n\nBrent crude also fell 0.29% to $59.18 per barrel.\n\nBy early last week, hedge funds had become the most bearish\n\ntowards petroleum prices since the start of the year, according\n\nto an analysis of position records published by the U.S.\n\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission and ICE Futures Europe.\n\n(Editing by Sam Holmes)", "description": "GLOBAL MARKETS-Stocks make cautious gains ahead of key Brexit summit", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEB6U08A_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
