One person who appears to have made an effortless transition from the WWE to MMA is the PFL\u2019s cage announcer, Lilian Garcia.\n\nGarcia was the in-ring voice of the WWE for nearly two decades, opening their flagship show Monday Night Raw and their big pay-per-view events by singing The Star Spangled Banner to packed arena crowds before taking up her duties as the ring announcer for the shows themselves.\n\nIn May 2019, Garcia swapped the squared circle for the PFL cage as she followed in the footsteps of her fellow former WWE colleagues Brock Lesnar, CM Punk and Jake \u201cJack Swagger\u201d Hager and made the switch to the world of MMA.\n\nNow firmly established as the voice of the PFL, Garcia introduces the combatants inside the cage before the fights begin, then makes the results official by announcing the winner after each fight. And, while some people are first intrigued by MMA and take a little time to develop a real affinity for the sport, for Garcia it was love at first sight, as she explained to MMA Junkie backstage at PFL 7 at the Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas.\n\n\u201cI fell in love with MMA from the get-go,\u201d she smiled. \u201cSo it\u2019s not even a thing where I\u2019ve been falling in love with it, literally from my first time at cageside seeing it, wow. I was blown away.\n\n\u201cI had seen some on TV, like Brock Lesnar or Conor McGregor, those guys. But when you see it live it\u2019s very, very different.\u201d\n\nAnd, working for the PFL, Garcia says the promotion\u2019s unique league format has helped strengthen her connection with the sport and the PFL\u2019s athletes as she follows the fortunes of the fighters through the course of the season.\n\n\u201cI love this organization,\u201d she said. \u201cI love the format. The format has made it a lot of fun for me. I can follow the fighters from the regular season now into the playoffs, and then really root for whoever it is to go for the championship. It\u2019s just a lot more fun.\u201d", "description": "Former WWE ring announcer and current voice of the PFL Lilian Garcia tells MMA Junkie how easy it was to switch from pro wrestling to MMA.", "authors": ["Simon Head", "George Garcia", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Nolan King", "Farah Hannoun", "Mike Bohn"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/off-guard-lilian-garcia-1.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
