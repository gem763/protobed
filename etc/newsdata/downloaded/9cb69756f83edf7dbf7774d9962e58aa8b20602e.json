Now China has one: Its young people.\n\nWhile previous generations were frugal savers\u2014a product of their years growing up in a turbulent economy with a weak social safety net\u2014the more than 330 million people born in China between 1990 and 2009 behave much more like Americans, spending avidly on gadgets, entertainment and travel.\n\nThe freewheeling consumption is helping China diversify its economy at a crucial time. Beijing has relied on exports and infrastructure-building to drive growth for decades, but recent signs point to a slowdown amid tariffs from the Trump administration. The new spending patterns have benefited Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. , Tencent Holdings Ltd. and other tech companies, whose rapid growth has helped energize China\u2019s economy.\n\nYet all this consumption has a downside. Household debt levels have risen rapidly over the past several years, with many young Chinese borrowing money for their purchases.\n\nHigh levels of corporate and government debt are already longstanding concerns for Beijing. As household debt climbs, some economists worry the country\u2019s debt burdens overall could become unmanageable and weigh on China\u2019s growth.\n\nYang Huixuan, 22, who graduated from college this year, has turned to online loans to pay for meals out, cosmetics and clothes.\n\nTo avoid problems down the road, some economists say, household borrowing will have to slow to more sustainable levels, adding another headwind to China\u2019s economy. In a worst-case scenario, they say, the combination of high government, corporate and consumer debt could exacerbate the economic slowdown and trigger a broader loss of confidence in China.\n\nLiu Biting, 25 years old, says she spends all of her paycheck each month: 10,000 yuan ($1,400) a month from her marketing job in Shanghai. About a third goes to rent, and the rest on food, her sewing hobby, going out, music and other products. So far, she has avoided falling into debt.\n\nUntil recently, one of her monthly expenses was a clothing rental subscription that cost $70 a month. She liked it, she says, because she could \u201ctry out a lot of strange clothes.\u201d She discovers makeup brands on a WeChat account she follows that recommends products, many of them local.\n\n\u201cFor my parents\u2019 generation, for them to get a decent job, a stable job, is good enough\u2014and what they do is they save money, they buy houses and they raise kids,\u201d she says. \u201cWe see money as a thing to be spent.\u201d\n\nHer parents repeatedly ask her how much she has saved in her three years of working. \u201cI say, \u2018I\u2019m sorry, probably nothing.\u2019 All my friends are like this. We have no savings and we don\u2019t really care about it.\u201d\n\nYoung people have \u201cbecome the main consumption power\u201d in China, Alibaba chief executive Daniel Zhang told reporters in November. People born after 1990 made up nearly half the customers during the latest \u201cSingles Day\u201d annual shopping event, when Alibaba sold roughly $30.8 billion of merchandise in 24 hours.\n\nAlmost a quarter of car buyers in China are under 30, and that figure is expected to rise to roughly 60% by 2025, says Zhou Ya, head of market research and customer intelligence for Volkswagen Group China. She says Volkswagen sees Chinese customers under 30 as crucial to its future in the country. The company is rolling out three entry-level models geared toward young drivers in China\u2019s less developed cities this quarter.\n\nThe spending is also helping power local brands including Heytea, an upscale tea salon, and Starbucks competitor Luckin Coffee, which raised about $571 million after going public earlier this year.\n\nChinese youths are especially more willing to pay for travel. A report last year by Mastercard and Ctrip.com, China\u2019s biggest online travel website, found that about one-third of China\u2019s outbound tourists who booked with Ctrip were born after 1990, and they spend more on a single trip than those born in the 1980s.\n\nShort-term loans from online lenders such as Ant Financial Services Group are helping fuel the spending. Ant Financial charges rates up to nearly 16% on an annualized basis, depending on the credit profile of the borrower. A 2018 survey in China by Rong360, a loan recommendation website, found that around half of respondents who took out consumer loans were born after 1990.\n\nWang Xinyu, 24, has racked up about $11,200 in debt spread over six credit cards.\n\nMost had borrowed from multiple lending platforms, the survey found, and nearly a third took out short-term loans to repay other debts. Nearly half of them had missed payments.\n\nOne of the most popular ways to borrow is a Huabei account, a revolving credit line embedded in China\u2019s Alipay mobile payments network. Huabei has extended loans in excess of 1 trillion yuan, or more than $140 billion, since its launch in April 2015, a person familiar with the matter said. Ant Financial, which owns Alipay, declined to disclose any figures related to Huabei.\n\nChina\u2019s former central banker Zhou Xiaochuan warned last November that the rise of fintech, while helping develop the consumer credit market, may \u201cexcessively induce\u201d the younger generation to spend beyond its means.\n\nYang Huixuan, 22, who graduated from college this year and works in communications for a soccer club in Nanjing, says she turned to Huabei while in school. She says she often borrowed around $100 a month to pay for meals out, cosmetics and clothes that she couldn\u2019t cover with the roughly $215 stipend she got every month from her parents. She relied on Huabei\u2019s installment payment function to afford bigger items like cameras and smartphones.\n\nHuabei is \u201ctruly addictive,\u201d says Ms. Yang, \u201cIt gives me an illusion that I\u2019m not really spending my own money.\u201d Ms. Yang says she\u2019s scaling back some now because of higher living costs and because she\u2019s reluctant to keep turning to her father for money.\n\nAn Ant spokesman says Huabei encourages its users to spend responsibly, and gives users the option to set monthly limits to help monitor their own spending.\n\nEasy credit has come from a wave of online micro-lenders and peer-to-peer lenders, which proliferated several years ago amid loose regulations. Some charged exorbitantly high interest rates.\n\nAuthorities have halted issuing licenses to new online lenders since late 2017, and tightened oversight to ensure interest rates on some loans are capped at an annual percentage rate of 36%. As of July, fewer than 800 peer-to-peer lenders remained in operation, from more than 2,600 in early 2016, according to industry website wdzj.com.\n\nThe average consumer spending of Chinese credit-card holders between ages 21 and 30 in 2016 was around $8,820, 39% higher than their average credit line of $6,360, according to data from Oliver Wyman, a New York-based consulting firm. Consumers can spend more than their credit limits by taking out additional loans from other channels, such as online lenders, or with subsidies from family.\n\nWang Xinyu, 24, says he has about $11,200 in debt spread over six credit cards, much of it accrued when he was in college and found it easy to swipe cards to pay for everyday expenses.\n\nMr. Wang, who earns about $600 a month working at a Beijing bookstore, says he now puts his entire salary toward paying down his debt. He still relies on credit cards to pay for food and rent, and sometimes uses one credit card to pay back another.\n\nYoung people in China are being \u201cpushed by the tide of the era\u201d in their reliance on easy credit to pay for things, he says.\n\nJPMorgan estimates China\u2019s ratio of household debt to gross domestic product will climb to 61% by 2020. That\u2019s up from 26% in 2010 and higher than current levels in Italy and Greece.\n\nThe level in the U.S. is about 76%, after falling from 98% in 2006, according to the International Monetary Fund.\n\nBy another measure\u2014the ratio of household debt to disposable income\u2014China appears to have already surpassed the U.S. Its ratio reached 117.2% in 2018, up from 42.7% in 2008, according to calculations by Lei Ning, a researcher at the Institute for Advanced Research at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics. The U.S. peaked at 135% in 2007 and dropped to 101% in 2018.\n\nOn Loan China has passed the U.S. in one measure of debt, and is catching up in another.

If they don\u2019t and continue falling into further debt, they could become even more vulnerable in future years.\n\nAs the U.S. saw in the 2008 financial crisis, default rates can shoot up rapidly when growth slows.\n\nThis generation \u201chas no idea what a rainy day feels like,\u201d said Dong Tao, an economist at Credit Suisse in Hong Kong. \u201cAny consumer credit boom will always be tested\u2014no exception,\u201d he says.\n\nHe points to mortgage debt as a deepening problem across China\u2019s economy, including for young people. Mortgage debt outstanding grew from $1.1 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2012 to $3.9 trillion as of June.\n\nMortgages accounted for about a third of China\u2019s medium- to long-term loans, up from 20% in 2012, according to the People\u2019s Bank of China.\n\nShare your thoughts How will young consumers\u2019 spending affect China\u2019s economy? Join the discussion below.\n\nParents often help young Chinese to buy a home, which Mr. Tao sees as a danger, with multiple generations now required to afford a single property. A similar phenomenon occurred in Japan in the 1980s, he says, sometimes with three generations helping to pay for a mortgage\u2014a sign the market was overheated. Japan\u2019s economy eventually entered a protracted slowdown as equity and real-estate asset prices corrected.\n\nChina\u2019s slowing job growth adds to the challenge. This year, more than 8.3 million college students are expected to graduate, compared with around six million a decade ago and only 165,000 in 1978. Yet some of China\u2019s most desirable employers, like e-commerce company JD.com Inc., have cut jobs as growth ebbs. Last year, a record 2.9 million individuals took the entrance exam for graduate school.\n\nLu Yu, a 26-year-old who works in human resources for the German technology company Robert Bosch GmbH in Shanghai, says he feels more economic pressure now, including a need to help care for his parents. He is living with them at home while an apartment he recently bought\u2014with his parents\u2019 help\u2014is undergoing renovations.\n\nStill, he says he \u201ccan\u2019t do mundane jobs that require me to follow the rules\u201d and would like to keep spending on products \u201cthat help improve my living environment, like high-quality towels and aromatherapy products.\u201d While his parents are reluctant to spend on fine dining and travel, he aims to travel twice a year, including recent trips to Japan, Cambodia and Thailand.\n\n\u201cFor me, if the money isn\u2019t spent on enriching your spirit and bringing you happiness, then what\u2019s the point? Are we supposed to live so that we can save money?\u201d\n\n\u2014Bingyan Wang contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Stella Yifan Xie at stella.xie@wsj.com, Shan Li at shan.li@wsj.com and Julie Wernau at Julie.Wernau@wsj.com", "description": "Chinese under 30 aren\u2019t savers like their parents and grandparents.
