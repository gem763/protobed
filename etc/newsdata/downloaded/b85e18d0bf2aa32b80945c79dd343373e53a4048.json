The official Olympic Flag, which is passed from one games venue to the next, has pride of place on the mezzanine \u2013 awaiting the opening ceremony for the 32nd Olympiad of the modern era on 24 July 2020.\n\nAs usual ahead of the four-yearly festival of sport, prices for visitors are soaring.

Instead, the website invites you to pay \u00a3610 per night for a double room at a Hyatt 30 miles from the capital. A couple planning to travelling together could right now pay \u00a315,000 for a far from perfect solution.\n\nYet having tracked air fares and hotel rates for the previous five Olympics, starting in Sydney in 2000, I predict that Tokyo 2020 will follow a standard pattern.\n\nInitially airlines and hoteliers think of a reasonable price and quadruple it. The Olympics, they believe, is a once-in-a-lifetime, get-rich-quick scheme.\n\nNever mind the thin pickings from the current Rugby World Cup in Japan. Much of the world regards the game played by men with odd-shaped balls as a minority sport popular only in exotic, far-off locations such as Fiji, Uruguay and Wales. For the sporting world\u2019s flagship festival, surely they will coin it?\n\nOfficial national delegations, media and tour operators catering for ardent fans of the Olympics will pay some astronomical rates. But as the opening ceremony approaches, it will become painfully apparent that supply is outstripping demand.\n\n\u201cNormal\u201d tourists and business visitors will be deterred by tales of high prices, and possibly the risk of disruption that the global gathering brings to its host city. Some may even be deterred by security concerns.\n\nSo anyone who waits patiently until a few weeks or days before the games can be confident of finding a plane ticket and hotel room for less than the usual price in a non-Olympic summer.\n\nTickets are trickier. If you are set on watching the men\u2019s 100m final in the Olympic Stadium on 2 August, or the main medal days in the pool, you have no hope on a budget. Even fringe disciplines, such as \u201cartistic swimming\u201d and dressage, may sell out.\n\nYet finding a good spot to see the best marathon runners in the world speed past will be easy.\n\nHowever deep or shallow your interest in sport, next summer will be an excellent time to be in Tokyo. Key tourist attractions will be pleasingly accessible, and sought-after restaurant tables easy to book.\n\nThe only downside I predict: the surges of humanity engaged in synchronised crossing at the road junction outside Shibuya station when the pedestrian lights change to green may dwindle. But so will the queue for the free 45th-floor observatory.\n\nTokyo is an addictive city full of joyful discoveries.", "description": "Don\u2019t let the utilitarian name put you off.
