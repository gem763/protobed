At a recent meeting of this group of businesspeople, it was agreed that a formal Chamber of Business in Umvoti would be the ideal structure to represent business and liaise with community stakeholders, including the local and district municipalities, for the upliftment of Umvoti.\n\nBusinesspeople of Umvoti are invited to attend this event where a small, voluntary committee will be elected to represent local business to draft an initial constitution, set objectives and begin the work of forming the chamber.\n\nThis event is also a rare opportunity for Umvoti businesses to socialise and network on an informal basis.\n\nPlease RSVP to Elzare Slatter at pa@bluecresthold.co.za or at 033 413 1070.
