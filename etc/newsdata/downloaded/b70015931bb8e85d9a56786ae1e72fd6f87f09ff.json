This is a wake-up call for dairies. To address these issues, we are instituting a scheme for testing and sampling for organized dairy. It will be implemented from January 1, 2020.\"\n\nBCCL/ REPRESENTATIONAL IMAGE\n\nOut of the total 456 samples which failed quality tests, only 12 were found to have been deliberately adulterated by using substances such as urea, hydrogen peroxide, detergent or urea.\n\nNine of the adulterated samples were from Telangana, two from Madhya Pradesh and one from Kerala.\n\nBCCL/ REPRESENTATIONAL IMAGE\n\nWith an annual production of 176.3 million tonne milk in 2017-18, India is the word's top milk producer and accounted for nearly 20 percent of the production worldwide.\n\nAs per government data, an average Indian consumes 360 grams of milk daily.", "description": "Milk contamination is a bigger problem in India than milk adulteration, a nationwide study by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India\u2019s (FSSAI) has found.
