They've found that having these pets is a status symbol. When one dies they simply go back to the wild and get another.'\n\nVideos and images uncovered by Mail Online shows the vulnerable animals being loaded into cars and driven around, or else chained up in small cages\n\nDuring a brief search of Instagram and Facebook, Mail Online uncovered posts which appeared to be offering cheetahs for sale, posted openly on both sites.\n\nOther videos show how the big cats are loaded into cars and driven around by their boasting owners.\n\nOne cheetah is shown watching footage of other wild animals on television, while in another video an adult cat is petted by a child.\n\nIn one piece of footage a cheetah is shown pacing up and down in a small metal cage, while in another a hissing animal is fed meat while sitting chained up inside a dirty enclosure.\n\nDr Marker is now calling for greater education in both Africa and the Middle East about the impact of cheetah smuggling, and for leaders in both regions to take a stand against the trade.\n\nShe said: 'There is no sense that what is happening is wrong, so we need community leaders to be educated to that effect.\n\n'Education and training plays a really important role, but tribal and religious leaders need to lead by example.\n\nExperts say three quarters of cheetahs taken from the wild die before they find a buyer, while those which end up in homes rarely live longer than two years due to malnutrition and disease\n\nA brief search of Instagram and Facebook by Mail Online uncovered what appeared to be adverts for cheetahs, with prices above $6,000\n\nOne video showed a big cat forced to watch a programme about of wild cheetahs on TV, while another showed an animal pacing back and forth inside its cage\n\n'From a demand side, it comes from a top level down. Influencers such as Sheikhs and Princes need to be telling people that it isn't something you should be doing.\n\n'Peer pressure needs to be happening in the demand side, laws won't necessarily help because laws are only effective if you can enforce them.'\n\nBoth the UAE and Saudi Arabia have laws that ban the ownership of such pets, but enforcement is lax.\n\nAs part of her work, Dr Marker helps to rescue some big cats and take them to a shelter in Somaliland - an autonomous region of Somalia.\n\nHowever, she says that half of the cats she receives often died shortly afterwards due to poor treatment at the hands of smugglers, and the future for survivors is often bleak.\n\nMost cubs are taken from their mothers between three and ten weeks old, and do not develop the instincts they need to survive in the wild.\n\nThere is little other option than to keep them in rescue centres or else find special units where they can be housed until a longer-term solution can be found.\n\nShe added: 'Cheetahs are such a special animal, you end up with these tiny cubs that have been pulled from their mothers and are very sickly.\n\n'A lot of them die and that's heartbreaking, it's horrible, devastating when that occurs. Wild animals should be left to live in the wild.'", "description": "Cheetahs in the Horn of Africa are in danger of dying out within two years because 300 cubs are being stolen each year so they can be smuggled to the Arabian peninsula as pets, it has been claimed.", "authors": ["Chris Pleasance For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/24/13/18867964-0-image-a-76_1569327391784.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
