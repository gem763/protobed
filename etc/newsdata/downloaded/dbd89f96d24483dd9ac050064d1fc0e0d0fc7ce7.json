We\u2019ve gone from $4.9M to $59.3M in gross revenue in just one year. This type of revenue growth is a testament to the Company\u2019s resilience and capacity to pivot in the face of uncertainty,\u201d said Sebastien St-Louis, CEO and co-founder of HEXO in a statement put out by the company late Monday evening, ahead of an earnings call with investors Tuesday morning.\n\nLast week, the company laid off 200 employees and suspended cultivation at its Niagara facility (acquired from Newstrike Brands) and 200,000 square feet of its Gatineau facility.\n\n\u201cThe company has determined that given the current market conditions in Canada, additional cultivation space is not required at this time,\u201d the statement said.\n\nWhile the company\u2019s revenue increased by 19 per cent from its previous quarter, its expenses soared over 90 per cent during the same period. Its gross margins declined to 33 per cent, significantly below most analysts\u2019 expectations.\n\nHEXO had slashed its revenue guidance by more than 40 per cent earlier this month and withdrew its fiscal 2020 guidance of $400 million in annual cannabis sales, as it struggled to compete in the cannabis market outside its home province of Quebec.\n\nBank of Montreal cannabis analyst Tamy Chen called the inventory write-down an \u201cunsettling development\u201d considering the amount of unfinished inventory held by licensed producers across the country, which is roughly 340,000 kilograms according to Health Canada data.\n\nRoyal Bank of Canada analyst Douglas Miehm also appeared unimpressed with HEXO\u2019s results, specifically expressing concern over the pricing and product return dynamics with the company\u2019s wholesaler. HEXO has a three-year distribution contract with Quebec\u2019s cannabis retailer, SQDC.\n\n\u201cWe look to understand whether pricing and resultant margins could trend lower. We also expect investors to focus on internal controls and governance given the abrupt departures of three executives in less than a month,\u201d Miehm wrote in a Tuesday morning note.\n\nHEXO\u2019s chief financial officer Michael Monahan abruptly resigned in early October. The company\u2019s recent layoffs also included the departures of Arno Groll, its chief manufacturing officer, and chief marketing officer Nick Davies.\n\nHEXO will host a conference call with investors and analysts on Tuesday at 8:30 a.m.\n\n\u2022 Email: vsubramaniam@nationalpost.com | Twitter: VanmalaS", "description": "Last week, the company laid off 200 employees and suspended cultivation at its Niagara facility and a portion of its Gatineau facility", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/hexo2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
