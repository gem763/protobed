It was all lies.\n\nMore than 330 perverts detained after arrest of one of UK's worst ever paedophiles\n\nEven after being presented with the lies, she continued to maintain her version of events.\n\nHowever, she admitted writing the review and told police that she was upset and had \u2018made things up\u2019 in anger.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDetective constable Terry Bandoo said: \u2018Kenmuir\u2019s claims led to a complete waste of police time at a period when demand for our services had never been higher.\n\n\u2018She caused unnecessary distress for an entirely innocent man who we arrested on suspicion of sexually assaulting her and spent a night in a police cell for doing absolutely nothing wrong.\n\n\u2018Her story was completely false and the fact she maintained this in interview, despite CCTV that completely contradicted her claims, is beyond belief. I hope this case demonstrates how seriously we take cases where people have perverted the course of justice, and I hope it serves as a deterrent for others considering doing the same.\u2019\n\nKenmuir finally admitted perverting the course of justice a month before her trial.\n\nShe was jailed at Cambridge Crown Court for 15 months.\n\nSentencing Kenmuir, Judge Stuart Bridge said despite her remorse she showed a degree of manipulation that was \u2018somewhat striking\u2019.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
