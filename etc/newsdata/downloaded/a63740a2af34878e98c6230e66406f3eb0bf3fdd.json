During the re-opening party, Bob Hope (Tony Audenshaw) is DJ-ing so no-one can hear Chas and Marlon\u2019s shouts for help.\n\nSpeaking about the awkward scenes, Lucy told Metro.co.uk: \u2018Charity\u2019s got stuck on the motorway somewhere because she\u2019s put the wrong fuel in her car, Paddy can\u2019t be located, everyone\u2019s running around like headless chickens, Chas should be on maternity leave but of course she\u2019s the one trying to get everything up and running. She\u2019s questioning Marlon because she can\u2019t find Paddy and he runs off in to the men\u2019s loos to avoid her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Chas follows him and unbeknownst to him, there\u2019s something wrong with the door and they can\u2019t get out. Initially they\u2019re joking around, then her waters go and they\u2019re stuck. She\u2019s a bit afraid because she\u2019s been having pains but she thought it was all stress. Paddy\u2019s not there with her, she really wanted Paddy to be there and she also wanted to be in a hospital because of what happened with Grace. It looks like she\u2019s going to be stuck there with Marlon who\u2019s not the biggest help in the world. He\u2019s slightly panicking himself, so it\u2019s not the best situation and things progress quite quickly.\u2019\n\nAs they tend to do in Emmerdale! As Marlon grabs Chas\u2019 hand after making a makeshift bed for her, she prepares to give birth with only a bumbling chef for support. But will everything go okay \u2013 and will Paddy make it to the special moment?\n\nLucy continued: \u2018Marlon starts off a bit flaky and panicky as any man would be, but as time goes on Marlon realises people are on the other side of the door as well. It gives him strength and he does what a cousin would do \u2013 he loves Chas, they\u2019ve got a great relationship \u2013 and he gets it in his head that he\u2019s there for her, they can do it and he\u2019s a calming influence on her.\u2019\n\nIt remains to be seen how it plays out but Lucy is confident that her character will make a great \u2013 if initially wary \u2013 mum to the newborn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe mused: \u2018Like any mum, there\u2019s that paranoia of I\u2019ve got to keep looking at her and waking her up and checking on her, but they know that there\u2019s nothing physically wrong with the baby. She\u2019s going to be slightly more paranoid but hopefully as the months go on, they settle in to parenthood and things will calm down a bit.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Will her and Paddy's baby be okay?", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/22_10_emm_chas_marlon-c457_1570448461.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
