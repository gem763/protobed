Stock picture\n\nUntil now myopia has been seen mainly as a genetic condition but new research is now able to not only confirm, but quantify, how 'nearwork' can damage children's vision.\n\nA research paper from the International Myopia Institute found that the odds of getting myopia increased by 2 per cent for every additional 'diopter-hour' of nearwork.\n\nA diopter hour combines the length of visual activities with viewing distance.\n\nMyopia is caused when the eyeball grows too long and light is refracted incorrectly so images are focused in front of the retina instead of on the retina and appear blurry.\n\nAbout 20 per cent of under-16s in the UK are short-sighted, compared with just 7.2 per cent in the 1960s.
