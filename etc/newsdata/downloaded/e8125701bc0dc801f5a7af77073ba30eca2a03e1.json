U.S. revenue fell 2 percent in the most recent quarter, while profits dropped by nearly 20 percent.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAs you recall, since the administration began discussing tariffs, we have outlined the ripple effect they would have on our business,\u201d Brian Goldner, Hasbro\u2019s chairman and chief executive, said Tuesday during an earnings call. \u201cIn the third quarter, the threat of and the implementation of tariffs . . . impacted our shipments and our ability to fully meet demand.\u201d\n\nThe company, he said, is facing \u201ca very choppy environment where retailer order patterns have changed in response to potential tariffs.\u201d\n\nIndustry groups have long warned that U.S. consumers and businesses would have to shoulder the burden of new tariffs. The toy industry, which relies heavily on Chinese manufacturing, is expected to be among the hardest hit. Upcoming tariffs could cause the price of toys to spike as much as 17 percent \u2014 compared with 8 percent for shoes and 4 percent for televisions \u2014 according to a report by the Trade Partnership, prepared for the National Retail Federation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHasbro, which is based in Pawtucket, R.I., said most of its products, which include Monopoly and Play-Doh, will be hit with a 10 percent tax on Dec. 15.\n\nGoldner said the company has no choice but to raise prices if those tariffs take effect in December. \u201cThose price increases would be passed along to consumers,\u201d he said.\n\nThe company is trying to reduce its reliance on Chinese imports, which make up about two-thirds of its products. It hopes to reduce that number to less than 50 percent by the end of next year, Goldner said.\n\nThird-quarter profits fell to $212.9 million, or $1.67 a share, down from $263.9 million, or $2.06 a share, from a year earlier. Revenue, meanwhile, rose 0.6 percent to $1.58 billion.\n\nShares of Hasbro closed at $100.02 on Tuesday, down $20.14 or 16.8 percent.\n\nAD", "description": "Executives say the toymaker is facing a \"very choppy environment\" as it prepares for the crucial holiday season.", "authors": ["Abha Bhattarai", "Reporter Covering The Retail Industry"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/nVFJlzZu9UgwCOQKIf6XEluUQ-g=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HBYR2PHU5II6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
