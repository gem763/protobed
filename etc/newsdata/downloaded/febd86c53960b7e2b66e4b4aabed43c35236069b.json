Trump's Approach Is Different.", "language": "en", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The last time Congress tried to impeach a president, the White House chief of staff had one rule: No one who wasn\u2019t working directly on impeachment, including the president himself, was ever allowed to talk about it.\n\nJohn D. Podesta, President Bill Clinton\u2019s wiry, uber-disciplined chief of staff, delivered the message during a senior staff meeting. White House staffers were supposed to stay in their lanes, doing their jobs, or risk being fired. Any water cooler discussion about the Monica Lewinsky scandal, or the impeachment proceedings, and \u201cI will break your neck,\u201d Podesta recalled telling his staffers, using an expletive. And that especially applied to Clinton.\n\nClinton\u2019s aides had studied Watergate, and their takeaway was that the public believed President Richard M. Nixon was being buried by the scandal, in part, because he talked about it endlessly. So their approach was that the only way to survive and to keep his job approval rating up was to demonstrate that the White House was still working, and that Clinton was still doing the job he was elected to do for the people.\n\nThe strategy of controlling and disciplining Clinton worked. While a Republican-led House impeached him in December 1998, Democrats picked up five House seats the month before, his approval rating soared to 73% in the days afterward, and he was acquitted of the charges by the Republican-led Senate in February 1999.\n\nBut the approach is unlikely to succeed with President Donald Trump, someone less concerned with policy than he is with how things play in distinct, daily news cycles. He heads into what appears to be a rapidly unfurling impeachment inquiry unprepared temperamentally, and with a depleted staff, many of whom are shrugging off the seriousness of what the president faces.\n\nThe White House communications and press operations have seen their roles subsumed by Trump, who thinks he is his own best spokesman and sees little need to control his anger at his accusers. And the West Wing, under the leadership of an acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, has reverted to an unstructured workspace governed by Trump\u2019s moods, with aides often dismissed or marginalized if they tell the president things he doesn\u2019t want to hear.\n\nMulvaney is often described as a figurehead, with Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, serving as the de facto chief of staff. The White House Counsel\u2019s Office is also understaffed; Emmet T. Flood, who was part of Clinton\u2019s impeachment legal team and then oversaw the Trump administration\u2019s legal response to the special counsel investigation into the Trump campaign\u2019s ties to Russia, stepped down in June, as Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation wrapped up.\n\nA White House official said there had been \u201cno need\u201d for a replacement, and that there were no impeachment preparations underway in the White House because so far there was no actual impeachment inquiry to prepare for.\n\nIf anything, Trump and some of his advisers have grown convinced since the Mueller investigation that the tight discipline that worked 20 years ago may not be necessary.\n\nHaving a formal war room, or rapid response operation, \u201cwould be overreaction on our part,\u201d said Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president. \u201cIt would be playing on the Democrats\u2019 turf.\u201d And if impeachment succeeds, Trump officials are anticipating a Republican-held Senate that would not permit witnesses to testify at length and would not convict him.\n\nPresident Bill Clinton meets with his cabinet, including chief of staff John Podesta, right, in 1998.
