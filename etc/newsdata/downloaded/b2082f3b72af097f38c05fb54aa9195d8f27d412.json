Except when Michelle Obama decides she needs to reset her batteries at the same time. The former First Lady is said to be a big fan of The Ranch even if some of the resort\u2019s high-end patrons would rather not have to share their wellness experience with her as they did last year, according to people who were present.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nObama showed up with about a half dozen friends, and by one count, nearly two dozen secret service agents turning a week of relaxation into an experience that felt like a bunch of days at the office, the resort clients tell FOX Business.\n\nThe intrusion of secret service agents monitoring daily hikes or possibly spying on people in yoga class is now likely to repeat itself, according to guests. Word among the high-end clientele is spreading that Obama and her entourage of friends as well as those pesky secret service agents are about to descend on The Ranch this weekend, ruining whatever cleansing the fat cats (to borrow a term from her husband) have in mind.\n\n\u201cI guess Michelle was nice enough,\u201d said one client of the spa who last year witnessed the former First Lady\u2019s visit. \u201cBut it\u2019s kind of a hassle and not very relaxing to go on a hike surrounded by guys with plugs in their ears watching your every move.\u201d\n\nSome patrons also say it\u2019s a bit hypocritical that Obama \u2014 whose former president husband often railed against millionaires and billionaires and Wall Street powerbrokers \u2014\u2014now finds it so appealing to hang with the money crowd. \u201cThis place is filled rich Wall Street dudes looking to lose weight,\u201d said another person with knowledge of the pending visit.\n\nSince leaving office, the Obama\u2019s clearly have found themselves in the top 1 percent inking multimillion-dollar book deals and big-bucks film production deals with Netflix. They have enough free cash to make even the most well-compensated banker jealous; recently, the former First Lady rented a 13,000 square foot Hollywood Hills mansion for just two days, as reported by TMZ It\u2019s unclear how much she paid for the rental but the place lists for about $23 million for prospective buyers.\n\nA press representative from The Ranch declined to comment on the matter. A press representative for Michelle Obama didn\u2019t return emails asking whether the former First Lady will make the trip this week or if the fat cats are getting anxious for nothing.", "description": "That time when a former first lady and the secret service ruined your wellness week.", "authors": ["Charles Gasparino", "Lydia Moynihan"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/michelle-obama-AP.png?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
