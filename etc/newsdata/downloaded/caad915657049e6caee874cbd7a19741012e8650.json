We know that because the UN has told us so.\n\n\u201cI think when we look at the damage eating meat is doing to the planet it is not preposterous to think that one day it will become illegal,\u201d he said.\n\nCurrently 25 per cent of global emissions come from agriculture, with livestock contributing to 80 per cent of that.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Farmed animals also produce half of the world\u2019s methane emissions. Research last year found that meat and dairy companies could overtake the oil industry as the world\u2019s biggest polluters by 2050.\n\n\u201cIt is time for a new law on ecocide to go alongside genocide and the other crimes against humanity,\u201d said Mr Mansfield.\n\nThe top QC will be making a speech at the launch of the Vegan Now campaign at the Labour party conference where he will be sitting on a panel of experts debating the damaging effects of livestock farming on biodiversity and climate change.\n\nJuliet Gellatley, director of animal rights group Viva!, who will also be on the panel, said: \u201cThirty years ago people didn\u2019t bat an eyelid if you lit a cigarette in a pub or restaurant. But now society accepts smoking is harmful and totally unnecessary and so we legislated against it. The same could happen with eating meat.\u201d\n\nExperts behind the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) found red meat had high greenhouse gas footprint because of the emissions livestock give out as well as the impact of land being cleared to grow crops for animal feed.\n\nThe report says we should be eating balanced diets with plant-based foods such as grains, vegetables and pulses, and animal-based food produced in sustainable systems.", "description": "Eating meat could become illegal due to the ecological damage it does to the planet, a top British barrister has said.\u00a0 Michael Mansfield QC believes the government should introduce tighter legislation to make activities which destroy the natural world illegal \u2013 and in the future this could even include banning the consumption of meat.", "authors": ["Phoebe Weston"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/04/26/11/hillsborough-disaster-18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
