Burroughs said the court would not dismantle a \"very fine\" admissions program.\n\nThe trial has been seen as a referendum on affirmative action hiring practices.\n\nAn appeal of the ruling could still reach the US Supreme Court.\n\nHarvard is one of the top-rated and most selective universities in the US, admitting about 1,600 freshman students out of 42,000 applicants each year.\n\nWhat was Harvard accused of?\n\nThe lawsuit was brought by a group called Students For Fair Admissions (SFFA).\n\nIt was formed by conservative activist Edward Blum, who opposes affirmative action - the proactive effort to include minorities that have been historically marginalised due to discrimination.\n\nIt claims that the elite university unfairly weighs race when considering an applicant, forcing Asian-Americans to meet a higher bar in order to be accepted.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC takes a look at American public opinion on Michigan's affirmative action policies.\n\nIt says Harvard uses a quota system or a system of \"racial balancing\" - practices that are illegal under federal law - to limit the number of Asian students on campus in an effort to maintain space for other racial groups.\n\nThe plaintiffs say that if race was not considered, and if admissions were only based on grades alone, twice as many Asian pupils would be admitted because they perform well academically.\n\nHow did Harvard respond?\n\nHarvard says it uses a \"holistic\" strategy to evaluate students, and that race is only one minor consideration.\n\nThe institution points out that its population of Asians students has been growing, and now stands at 23% of the student body.\n\nOther Ivy league universities and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) have supported Harvard in the case.\n\nWhat was the ruling?\n\n\"The court will not dismantle a very fine admissions program that passes constitutional muster, solely because it could do better,\" US District Judge Allison Burroughs in Boston wrote in a decision released on Tuesday.\n\nThe decision came nearly a year after a trial which did not include a jury.\n\nThe SFFA is expected to appeal the decision, meaning the case could likely end up in the Supreme Court.", "description": "The elite college had been accused of discriminating against Asian-American applicants.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/15B19/production/_103875888_gettyimages-1052189382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
