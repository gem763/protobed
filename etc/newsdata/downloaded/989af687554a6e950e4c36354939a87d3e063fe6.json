This incident has eroded the trust we have built with our community. We must now work even harder to ensure that trust is restored,' he said.\n\n'To the citizens and residents of our city, we understand your frustration and disappointment. I, too, am frustrated and disappointed in what occurred and the officer's actions.\n\n'We never want an officer's response to a call to end in a loss of life. We have a great many officers who work extremely hard every day, they do this with great sacrifice, and with a servant's heart.\n\n'I ask you please, do not let the actions of one officer reflect on the other 1,700.'\n\nFort Worth Interim Police Chief Ed Kraus nearly broke down at a Tuesday press conference about a white officer who is charged with murder for shooting dead a black woman through a window at her home. Kraus (pictured) expressed deep regret over the shooting on behalf of himself and his officers, insisting that it was 'not indicative of the work they do every day'\n\nAaron Dean (left) was arrested for the murder of 28-year-old Atatiana Jefferson (right) on Monday night. The 34-year-old police officer shot and killed Jefferson through her bedroom window early Saturday morning\n\nKraus continued: 'There's absolutely no excuse for this incident, and the person responsible will be held accountable. Ms Jefferson's family and our community will have the last word, and the courts will speak on their behalf.\n\n'Each and every one of you have our support and our commitment to serve you better every day than we did the day before.'\n\n'My prayer for Atatiana's family, our community and our department comes from Numbers chapter 6 verses 24 and 26: \"The Lord bless you and keep you; the Lord make his face shine on you and be gracious to you; the Lord turn his face toward you and give you peace.\"'\n\nKraus reiterated that Dean, who joined the force in April 2018 and resigned on Monday afternoon as department officials prepared to terminate him, had been arrested and charged with murder.\n\nHe vowed that the department would conduct a 'thorough and meticulous' investigations into Jefferson's death.\n\nAn attorney for the victim's family, Lee Merritt, has said they were 'relieved' by Dean's arrest, but insisted that 'the city of Fort Worth has much work to do to reform a brutal culture of policing'.\n\nAsked by a reporter about what the department plans to do to achieve those reforms, Kraus said they were considering bringing in a third party group to evaluate practices, policies and training 'to make sure we are above best practice behavior'.\n\nThe police chief became emotional when another reporter asked about morale among the other officers in the wake of Saturday's shooting and the [bitter] community response.\n\nKraus said every officer he's spoken to has agreed with the actions taken against Dean.\n\n'The officers are hurting. I've been out there on patrol, and since this occurred, the officers come up and hug,' he said before trailing off.\n\n'It's very emotional because the officers try hard every day to try to make this city better. They're out there trying to build these relationships.\n\n'I likened it to a bunch of ants building an anthill and someone comes along with a hose and washes it away and you have to start from scratch.'\n\nKraus appeared to be fighting back tears as he abruptly ended the press conference and left the podium.\n\nFort Worth Police released body camera footage of Dean firing the fatal shot through Jefferson's window after seeing her walk by during a welfare check at around 2.30am\n\nDean and another officer were called to Jefferson's home at around 2.30am Saturday to perform a wellness check after a neighbor called a non-emergency police line to report that her front door was open.\n\nJefferson was playing video games with her eight-year-old nephew when they heard a noise outside and she got up to investigate, assuming it was a prowler.\n\nBody camera footage released by the Fort Worth Police Department shows Dean shining a flashlight into the back of the home as Jefferson approached the bedroom window.\n\nHe shouted at her to put her hands up, without identifying himself as law enforcement.\n\nA split-second later, the officer fired a single shot, killing Jefferson.\n\nDean resigned from the force on Monday as department officials prepared to fire him\n\nJefferson's loved ones have demanded justice for the 28-year-old's 'senseless' murder\n\nA bullet hole could be seen in the back window outside the Fort Worth home on Monday\n\nRetired black Fort Worth cop says she doesn't trust her former colleagues in the wake of Jefferson shooting Larhonda Young called for reform within the Fort Worth Police Department on Monday, just as Officer Aaron Dean, her former colleague, was charged with the murder for fatally shooting 28-year-old Jefferson. 'As a black female, former police officer, I'm afraid when I get stopped,' Young told CBS News. 'Officers are shooting before assessing the situation. 'If that officer had simply knocked on the door, that young lady would be alive today.' Larhonda Dean\n\nIn a statement hours after the shooting, Fort Worth police said he opened fire after 'perceiving a threat'.\n\nAnnouncing Dean's resignation on Monday, Interim Police Chief Ed Kraus said the exact threat was unclear.\n\n'I cannot make sense of why she had to lose her life,' Kraus said.\n\n'Nobody looked at this video and said that there's any doubt that this officer acted inappropriately.'\n\nThe bodycam video also included images of a gun that was found in the bedroom where Jefferson was shot. Kraus said he did not know whether Jefferson was holding the weapon or if Dean had seen it before he opened fire.\n\nJefferson's family accused police of 'villainizing' the victim by sharing photos of the gun, as if to suggest that she posed some kind of threat.\n\n'You didn't hear the officer shout: \"Gun, gun, gun.\" He didn't have time to perceive a threat. That's murder,' Merritt said after watching the video.\n\nKraus later apologized for releasing the photos of the gun.\n\n'That is something we've done in the past - to include the photograph of the firearm to show what the perceived threat may have been,' Kraus said. 'In hindsight, it was a bad thing to do.'\n\n'We're homeowners in Texas ... Most of us, if we thought we had somebody outside our house that shouldn't be, and we had access to a firearm, we would be acting very similarly to how she was acting,' he added.\n\nAt the same Monday press conference, Fort Worth Mayor Betsy Price called Jefferson's killing unjustified.\n\n'I'm so sorry. On behalf of the entire city of Fort Worth, I'm sorry,' Price said. 'To Atatiana's family, it's unacceptable. There is nothing that can justify what happened on Saturday morning. Nothing.'\n\nJefferson's loved ones spoke at a press conference on Monday before Dean was charged, sharing their heartbreak over her death and calling for justice\n\nHer older sisters Ashley and Amber Carr are seen alongside the family's lawyer, Lee Merritt\n\nSeven police-on-civilian shootings by Fort Worth officers since June The October 12 shooting of Atatiana Jefferson was the seventh time a Fort Worth police officer has shot a civilian since June.

Read more here.\n\nJefferson's loved ones spoke at a press conference on Monday before Dean was charged, sharing their heartbreak over her death and calling for justice.\n\nMerritt opened Monday's press conference by stating that the shooting was 'not a one-off' or a 'bad luck incident from an otherwise sound department'.\n\n'The Fort Worth Police Department is one of the deadliest in the United States. They're in need of serious systematic reform,' Miller said.\n\n'We are asking that the federal government comes in and takes a conscious look at the policies and procedures that allow something like this to happen.\n\nMiller continued: 'This was a wellness call. It's beyond me to begin to understand what kind of police force responds to a wellness call with the equivalent of SWAT.\n\n'This department and their officers violated not only the rights of Tay Jefferson and her family, but they just made common sense mistakes.'\n\nHe noted that as the officers surveyed the property they passed two open doors but did not announce themselves as law enforcement.\n\nHe alleged that they did not have probable cause to enter the backyard based on what the neighbor had told them on the non-emergency call.\n\n'They created a deadly situation and they responded in a way that is not unique to the city of Fort Worth,' Miller said.\n\n'In the last six months they've had 10 officer-involved shootings, seven officer-involved deaths. That's more than most nations - for one city in Texas. That represents a serious problem that must be addressed.\n\n'This family is calling for the firing of this officer. That's the least we could expect. They're calling for this officer to be vigorously prosecuted, to be appropriately sentenced.\n\n'The investigation should be handled by someone other than the Fort Worth Police Department, specifically the Department of Justice, the FBI, or worst case scenario, the local sheriff's department. Anyone other that the city of Fort Worth, which is clearly incompetent to investigate itself, should be called in.\n\n'Why this man is not in handcuffs right now is a continued source of agitation for this family and for this community and it must be addressed.'\n\nAfter Miller's opening statements, Jefferson's brother Darius Carr took the microphone.\n\nAtatiana's brother Darius Carr (pictured), who has served in the military for the past 12 years, alleged that the officer who killed his sister did not follow his own training. 'This man murdered someone, he should be arrested,' the brother said as he fought back tears\n\nAtatiana's older sisters Amber (left) and Ashley Carr (right) also spoke at the press conference, describing their sister as a loving, caring soul who deserved justice\n\nHe said that in the 12 years he's been in the military, he's been extensively trained in how to respond to specific situations, alleging that the officer who killed his sister did not follow his own training.\n\n'When you don't do things the way you've been trained and taught, you have to answer for that,' Darius Carr said. 'You know better.'\n\n'This man murdered someone, he should be arrested,' he added as he fought back tears.\n\nNext up was Jefferson's older sister and the mother to Zion, who witnessed his aunt get shot.\n\nAmber Carr praised her son's steady response to the horrifying incident and said he's been the one taking care of her in the aftermath.\n\n'He's my biggest encourager. In the middle of the night when I'm crying he wakes up and tells me to breathe. He holds me, he hugs me,' she said.\n\nShe said that Jefferson served as a mother figure to Zion and had recently served as his primary caretaker.\n\nAnother sister then delivered a statement on behalf of the family, first thanking the 'thousands' of people who had offered their support in this 'unbelievable time of shock and sorrow'.\n\nAshley Carr described Jefferson as a 'smart, ambitious, kind person with a nurturing spirit' who loved her family deeply.\n\nShe said Jefferson had recently moved into their mother's home to help out as she suffered health problems.\n\n'There is simply no justification for his actions,' Ashley Carr said of the police officer who shot her sister. 'We demand justice for Atatiana.'\n\nDean joined the Fort Worth Police Department in April 2018, according to officials\n\nJefferson's father Marquis Jefferson spoke out on Sunday, calling her death 'senseless'.\n\n'My daughter was 28 years old, had her whole life in front of her,' he told KTXA of the aspiring doctor who worked in pharmaceutical sales.\n\n'You have to know this is somebody's daughter. Somebody loved her. There was a better way. It didn't have to be like that.'\n\nThe case is being compared to the fatal of shooting of Botham Jean, who was killed by Amber Guyger - a white police officer who was off-duty - in his home just over a year ago.\n\nJefferson's father Marquis Jefferson spoke out on Sunday, calling her death 'senseless'\n\nMarquis Jefferson recalled Jean's brother, Brandt Jean, asking at Guyger's October 2 sentencing whether he could hug his brother's killer.\n\nThe grieving dad said there won't be any such sentimentality for him about the officer who killed his daughter.\n\n'Unlike this Botham Jean, I don't want no hug,' he said. 'That's my one and only daughter. I will never forget that.'\n\nJefferson's stepmother, Noella Jefferson, said her stepdaughter had hopes, dreams and aspirations that she will never be able to fulfill now.\n\nJefferson graduated with a pre-med degree from Xavier University of Louisiana in 2014.\n\n'We have lost her for no reason,' Noella said. 'We have seen many cases like this where you think that they would have learned from it.'\n\nOne unexpected moment during Monday's press conference came when Jefferson's aunt, Venitta Body, read a statement from the victim's hospitalized mother, Yolanda Carr.\n\nShe said that Marquis Jefferson is not actually the victim's biological father and said he had not reached out to the family since the shooting.\n\nSpeaking alongside his wife Noella, Marquis Jefferson said: 'My daughter was 28 years old, had her whole life in front of her. You have to know this is somebody's daughter. Somebody loved her. There was a better way. It didn't have to be like that'\n\nThe neighbor who called a police non-emergency number about the open door on the night of the killing, James Smith, told reporters he was just trying to be a good neighbor.\n\n'I'm shaken. I'm mad. I'm upset. And I feel it's partly my fault,' Smith said. 'If I had never dialed the police department, she'd still be alive.'\n\nSmith said Jefferson and her nephew typically lived with an older woman, who's been in the hospital.\n\n'It makes you not want to call the police department,' he said.\n\nIn an audio recording of Smith's call, which was released by police, the neighbor said it was 'not normal' for the front door of the house to be left open in the early hours of the morning.\n\nJames Smith (pictured), the neighbor who called a police non-emergency number about the open door on the night of the killing, said he feels partly responsible for her death\n\nThe home on East Allen Avenue where Jefferson was shot dead is pictured above\n\nA large crowd later gathered outside Masjid Hassan Al Islam, a mosque next door to Jefferson's home on East Allen Avenue for a vigil on Sunday. Carol Harrison-Lafayette is seen holding a sign that reads: 'Enough is enough' as protesters chanted: 'No justice, no peace'\n\nJefferson's death sparked outrage in the community that has seen seven police-on-civilian shootings since June\n\nFour-year-old Trinity Ford joins the crowd gathered during a Sunday vigil for Jefferson\n\nNews of Jefferson's death was met with heartbreak and fury in the community and nationwide.\n\nLocal activists marched through the streets of Fort Worth on Sunday evening, briefly disrupting traffic on part of Interstate 35.\n\nA large crowd later gathered outside Masjid Hassan Al Islam, a mosque next door to Jefferson's home on East Allen Avenue for a vigil.\n\n'No justice, no peace,' they chanted, holding signs that said: 'Enough is enough' and 'We deserve respect.'\n\n'Everyone has the right to be angry but then what?' attendee Nita Sullivan told the at times agitated crowd.\n\n'You can only shake your fists at the sky so many times.'\n\nOmar Suleiman, a Dallas-area imam and activist, told the Dallas Morning News he did not speak during the vigil because he was speechless.\n\n'I think people feel perpetually traumatized,' Suleiman said later.\n\n'There's a great sense of sadness and anger. Her family wanted us to know that she was human. That should go without saying.'\n\nLocal minister and activist Rev Kyev Tatum of Ministers Against Crime and the 3E coalition called on Texas Gov Greg Abbott and Lt Gov Dan Patrick to travel to Fort Worth to address the shooting with the local community to help quell anger and address the issue of police shooting unarmed civilians in their own homes.\n\n'Our young people are not going to tolerate this, no matter how much we tell them to be cool, remain calm, that justice will be served,' Kyev told WFAA.\n\n'When another mother loses her wife, a caregiver for both her eight-year-old nephew and a grandparent, loses her life in her own home, there's something grossly wrong with the Fort Worth Police Department and they refuse to take responsibility for their actions.'\n\nJefferson's friends, Destinie and Floriberto Bartolo (pictured), said they had known her since high school. They took part in a community vigil outside her home on Sunday\n\nSeveral lawmakers reacted to the shooting on social media.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Sen Bernie Sanders on Sunday called on the Justice Department to investigate.\n\n'The killings of unarmed Black Americans have got to end,' Sanders tweeted. 'Atatiana Jefferson should be alive.'\n\nIn her own tweet, Elizabeth Warren called for police reform to include 'federal standards for use of force that incorporate proven strategies like de-escalation, verbal warning requirements, and the use of non-lethal alternatives.'\n\nFormer Housing and Urban Development secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro tweeted an article about the shooting and said police shouldn't make people 'unsafe in our own homes'.\n\n'How many articles do we need to read or videos do we need to watch before we do something to reform policing in this country?' he asked.\n\nA GoFundMe campaign has raised over $213,000 for Jefferson's family as of Tuesday morning.\n\nNews of the shooting captured nationwide attention as several lawmakers responded on social media.
