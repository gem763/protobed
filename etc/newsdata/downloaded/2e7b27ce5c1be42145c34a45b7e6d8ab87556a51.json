That status is now under threat.\n\nThe city is a money-spinner for HSBC Holdings PLC, Standard Chartered PLC, Bank of China (Hong Kong) Ltd. and others, such as Bank of East Asia Ltd. and HSBC\u2019s local subsidiary, Hang Seng Bank Ltd. It is lucrative in part because Hong Kong is a major financial center, and handles a lot of business for mainland Chinese clients.\n\nBanks\u2019 profit per employee last year was higher in Hong Kong than in any other market tracked by Citigroup analysts\u2014roughly double the U.S. figure.\n\nBut now Hong Kong\u2019s economy is shrinking, hit by the U.S.-China trade war, slowing Chinese growth and months of antigovernment protests. Earlier this month, the city\u2019s chief executive, Carrie Lam, said Hong Kong was in a \u201ctechnical recession,\u201d typically defined as at least two straight quarters of economic contraction.\n\nA weaker economy is likely to mean more loans going sour and less credit demand from households and businesses.\n\nMeanwhile, lending is becoming less profitable, as the city\u2019s currency peg with the U.S. dollar forces it to match interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Lower interest rates typically reduce the margins banks earn, by narrowing the gap between the rates at which they lend and borrow. To make things worse, there is new competition from upstart online banks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the start of the end of an era of super profitability in Hong Kong,\u201d said Ronit Ghose, the Dubai-based global head of bank research at Citigroup.\n\nQuarterly results this week\u2014from HSBC on Monday and Standard Chartered on Wednesday\u2014will give investors an early indication. The two are both listed on the London Stock Exchange as well as in Hong Kong.\n\nThe banks face other challenges, too. For HSBC, these include uncertainty over the U.K.\u2019s planned exit from the European Union and trouble with officials in China, angry over its giving U.S. prosecutors information about client Huawei Technologies Co.\n\nBut Hong Kong matters hugely: It provided roughly half of HSBC\u2019s pretax profit in the second quarter.\n\nFor the third quarter, consensus forecasts compiled by HSBC point to an 11% drop in net profit from a year earlier, to US$3.47 billion. Expected credit losses and other credit-impairment charges are forecast to be up by nearly one-third, to US$673 million.\n\nOne focus for HSBC watchers will be cost-cutting plans, said Gary Greenwood, a U.K.-based analyst at Shore Capital Group, since the bank has pledged to increase revenue faster than costs this year.\n\nNow comes the virtual competition. The Hong Kong government this year granted eight licenses for online banks, which won\u2019t need physical branches. Backers include powerful technology companies\u2014among them Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Ant Financial, an affiliate of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. \u2014as well as such traditional lenders as Bank of China (HK), Standard Chartered, and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd.\n\nFelix Lam, a portfolio manager at BNP Paribas Asset Management, said traditional banks\u2019 defense of market share could lower fee income and raise the cost of attracting new deposits.\n\nHang Seng, HSBC, and Standard Chartered will feel the most pressure from stiffer competition in the retail market, Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note to clients, since about half their Hong Kong earnings come from retail.\n\nShares of Hong Kong-focused banks have underperformed the broader Hong Kong market this year. HSBC trades at 0.91 times the forecast book value of its assets, according to FactSet, below a 10-year average of 1.05 times. Trading below book value can signal investor concerns about capital strength or future profitability.\n\nDespite the low valuation, analysts and investors don\u2019t see the stock as a bargain. Refinitiv tallies analysts\u2019 recommendations on a five-point scale: 1 is a strong buy, 3 a hold and 5 a sell. HSBC is currently at 3.3, the most negative since 2002.\n\nAnalysts don\u2019t expect overall profit to fall at HSBC, but neither do they expect rapid growth. The consensus of the forecasts collected by the bank is for an income rise of just 0.3% next year, to US$14.44 billion, and about 5.2% in 2021.\n\nPolitical turmoil is threatening Hong Kong\u2019s status as Asia\u2019s leading financial hub. If international companies want to relocate, how do alternatives Singapore, Tokyo and Shanghai measure up?
