In May, when 1.4 million kids around the world walked out of school, they asked for adults to join them next time. That next time is 20 September (in a few countries 27 September), and it is shaping up to be the biggest day of climate action in the planet\u2019s history: every one from big trade unions to a thousand workers at the Amazon headquarters, and from college kids to senior citizens, are setting the day aside to rally in their cities and towns for faster action from our governments and industries. You can find out what\u2019s happening in your community at globalclimatestrike.net.\n\nBut it will only be a success on the scale we need if lots of people who aren\u2019t the regular suspects join in. Many people, of course, can\u2019t do without a day\u2019s pay, or work for bosses who who would fire them if they missed work. So it really matters that those of us with the freedom to rally do so. Since I published the first book for a general audience on climate change 30 years ago this month, I\u2019ve had lots of time to think about the various ways to move people to action. Let me offer a few:\n\nStrike because the people who did the least to cause this crisis suffer first and worst \u2013 the people losing their farms to desert and watching their islands sink beneath the waves aren\u2019t the ones who burned the coal and gas and oil.\n\nStrike because coral reefs are so gloriously beautiful and complex \u2013 and so vulnerable.\n\nStrike because sun and wind are now the cheapest way to generate power around the world \u2013 if we could match the political power of the fossil fuel industry we could make fast progress.\n\nStrike because we\u2019ve already lost half the animals on the planet since 1970 \u2013 the earth is a lonelier place.\n\nStrike because our governments move with such painful slowness, treating climate change as, at worst, one problem on a long list.\n\nStrike because this could be the great opportunity \u2013 and maybe the last opportunity \u2013 to transform our society towards justice and towards joy. Green New Deals have been proposed around the world; they are a way forward.\n\nStrike because forests now seem like fires waiting to happen.\n\nStrike because young people have asked us to. In a well-ordered society, when kids make a reasonable request their elders should say yes \u2013 in this case with real pride and hope that the next generations are standing up for what matters.\n\nStrike because every generation faces some great crisis, and this is ours.\n\nStrike because half the children in New Delhi have irreversible lung damage simply from breathing the air.\n\nStrike because Exxon and the rest knew all about global warming in the 1980s, and then lied so they could keep cashing in.\n\nStrike because what we do this decade will matter for hundreds of thousands a year.\n\nStrike because the temperature has hit 129F (54C) in big cities in recent summers. The human body can survive that, but only for a few hours.\n\nStrike because do we want to be the first generations to leave the planet in worse shape?\n\nStrike because batteries are ever cheaper \u2013 we can now store sunshine at night, and wind for a calm day.\n\nStrike because the UN estimates unchecked climate change could create a billion refugees this century.\n\nStrike because the big banks continue to lend hundreds of billions to the fossil fuel industry \u2013 people are literally trying to get rich off the destruction of the planet.\n\nStrike because what animal fouls its own nest?\n\nStrike because indigenous people around the world are trying to protect their rightful land from the coal and oil companies \u2013 and in the process protect all of us.\n\nStrike because every time they cut down a patch of rainforest to grow some more cows, the climate math gets harder.\n\nStrike because science is real, because physics exists, because chemistry matters.\n\nStrike so you can look your grandkid \u2013 or anyone else\u2019s \u2013 in the eye.\n\nStrike because the world we were given is still so sweet.", "description": "There are countless reasons to strike this week.
