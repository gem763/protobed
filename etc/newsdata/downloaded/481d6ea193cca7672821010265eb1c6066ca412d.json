(Brian van der Brug/Los Angeles Times via AP)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 A California scuba dive boat was operating in violation of Coast Guard regulations when crew members were sleeping and a pre-dawn fire killed 34 people, leaving grieving families wondering if a required night watchman could have saved their loved ones.\n\nThursday brought a disclosure from the National Transportation Safety Board that all six crew members were asleep aboard the Conception on Sept. 2 when the deadly blaze broke out.\n\nThe NTSB's findings could aid federal authorities conducting a criminal investigation into the fire, who could bring charges under a statute known as seaman's manslaughter. The law was enacted during the 19th century to punish negligent captains, engineers and pilots for deadly steamboat accidents that killed thousands.\n\nFive crew members, including the captain, were asleep on the vessel's second deck and survived. The sixth, a 26-year-old deckhand named Allie Kurtz , was sleeping below and perished with the boat's 33 passengers.\n\nKurtz's grandmother, Doris Lapporte, said she was too distraught Thursday to comment on the NTSB's findings, issued days before the family planned to scatter her granddaughter's ashes at sea.\n\n\"I have nightmares every day about her going up in flames,\" Lapporte said, crying. \"This isn't the time to talk about how angry I am or how I feel.\"\n\nThe cause of the Sept. 2 blaze has yet to be determined. Crews raised the wreckage of the burned-out boat Thursday from waters off Santa Cruz Island where the vessel was anchored the night of the tragedy. The island is northwest of Los Angeles and about 20 miles (32 kilometers) from the mainland.\n\nThe Conception's Certificate of Inspection, issued by the Coast Guard, requires a \"roving patrol at all times\" when passengers' bunks are occupied.\n\nThe parents of Charles McIlvain, a 44-year-old visual effects designer who was onboard with his neighbor, said the missing roving watchman \"disturbs us greatly.\"\n\n\"Early detection may have made an incredible difference in outcome,\" Clark and Kathleen McIlvain said in a statement.\n\nDouglas Schwartz, an attorney for the Conception's owner, Truth Aquatics Inc., said in a statement that a crew member was awake shortly before the fire, which started around 3 a.m. He said the crewman checked \"on and around the galley area\" around 2:30 a.m. The first mayday call from the captain was transmitted at 3:14 a.m.\n\nHe also touted the company's safety record, noting it passed \"every single annual Coast Guard inspection for the last 45 years, while hosting 450,000 divers on 1.3 million dives.\"\n\nTruth Aquatics Inc. filed a lawsuit last week in U.S. District Court under a pre-Civil War provision of maritime law aimed at limiting its liability.\n\nThe victims on the Conception were believed to have died from smoke inhalation. They were a diverse collection, including a girl celebrating her 17th birthday with her parents and a friend, a marine biologist who was leading the three-day scuba diving excursion, an Indian-born dentist and her husband from Connecticut, an environmental scientist and a professional photographer.\n\nThe Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office on Thursday said it had identified all the victims, using DNA testing.\n\nThe office issued a list including the last seven names. They included the Connecticut couple previously identified by relatives and neighbors, along with several people involved in technology in the Silicon Valley.\n\nThe last of the bodies was pulled from the water Wednesday.\n\n\"May they all rest in peace and may their families know that all of us who have been involved in this sad operation continue to hold them in our hearts and in our prayers,\" Brown said.\n\nThe Coast Guard has issued additional safety recommendations in the wake of the tragedy, such as limiting the unsupervised charging of lithium-ion batteries and the use of power strips and extension cords.\n\nThe NTSB report provided few additional details and noted that investigators have only interviewed three of the five surviving crew members, who said no mechanical or electrical issues had been reported before the fire.\n\nNTSB spokesman Eric Weiss said the Coast Guard asked their investigators to postpone the remaining crew interviews pending an investigation.\n\nAttorney Michael Lipman, who represents boat captain Jerry Boylan, said he does not believe his client spoke with the NTSB. Lipman refused to discuss any facts in the case, whether he had spoken with any federal agencies or whether he advised his client not to speak with authorities.", "description": "A California scuba dive boat was operating in violation of Coast Guard regulations when crew members were sleeping and a pre-dawn fire killed 34 people, leaving grieving families wondering if a required night watchman could have saved their loved ones.
