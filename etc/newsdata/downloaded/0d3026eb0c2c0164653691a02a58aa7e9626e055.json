The latter is problematic regarding Trump: What is known about his Ukraine involvement reveals nothing \u2014 nothing \u2014 about his character or modus vivendi that was not already known. This is unfortunate but undeniable: Many millions voted for him because he promised that the loutishness of his campaigning foreshadowed his governing style. Promise keeping is a problematic ground for impeachment\u2026\n\nThis might be a moment in this nation\u2019s life when worse is better: The squalor of the president\u2019s behavior regarding Ukraine, following so much other repulsive behavior, is giving many Americans second thoughts about presidential power, which has waxed as Congress has allowed, often eagerly, its power to wane. Impeachment, however dubious, might at least be a leading indicator of an overdue recalibration of our institutional equilibrium.\n\nNevertheless, the best antidote for a bad election is a better election. The election the nation needs in 400 days would remove the nation\u2019s most recent mistake and inflict instructive carnage \u2014 the incumbent mistake likes this noun \u2014 on his abjectly obedient party.", "description": "", "authors": ["George Will", "Washingtonpost.Com Opinions The-Best-Antidote-For-A-Bad-Election-Is-A-Better-Election"], "top_image": ""}
