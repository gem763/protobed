As things stand, parliamentary ratification is far from certain,\" Dean Turner, an economist at UBS, said.\n\nThe pound was down 0.2 per cent by midday Thursday (early Friday AEDT) hitting $US1.2793 - far below the $US1.2988 level touched earlier in the day.\n\nSterling has been on a rollercoaster ride recently, and is up 7 per cent since early September when it hit the lowest since October 2016 at $US1.19.\n\nVolatility expectations for sterling over the next week have jumped to their highest since the 2016 Brexit referendum, underlying investors' nerves.\n\nAgainst the euro, sterling dropped 0.7 per cent to 87 pence, having earlier reached 85.77 pence.\n\nThe euro was buoyed by news of a deal and was last up 0.4 per cent at $US1.1116 while the dollar index fell 0.3 per cent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe UK's FTSE mid-cap stocks index was well off its day's high and was last trading up 0.3 per cent. The blue-chip exporter-heavy FTSE 100 index rose 0.8% on sterling's reversal.\n\nBritish government bond yields initially surged, with 10-year yields hitting 0.79 per cent, their highest since July , before falling slightly on the day to 0.69 per cent.\n\n\"It looks like we've got something that would be the basis for a vote,\" said Kit Juckes, macro strategist at Societe Generale. \"Now we will try to scramble up if he (Johnson) has got enough votes to pass the deal through the parliament.\"\n\nThe agreement on a deal, while still to face a parliamentary test, has triggered a rethink on the outlook for UK stocks.\n\nJPMorgan's basket of London-listed companies that make their cash at home has enjoyed a meteoric rally in the past week.\n\nIn this period it has vastly outperformed the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250. The benchmark is considered a barometer of Brexit worries.\n\n\"While Parliament approval is still required, the news today should provide legs to the rotation from UK exporters to domestic plays,\" Barclays Capital European equities strategist Emmanuel Cau.\n\nOptimism that a Brexit deal would be finalised saw money markets reduce expectations of rate cuts from the Bank of England. They now see a 60 per cent chance of a quarter point cut next December versus 76 per cent on Tuesday and 90 per cent last week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEuro zone money markets too priced out chances of a year-end rate cut.\n\n\"Unfortunately, it is too early, I wouldn't be taking any direction at this point. It doesn't make sense to be taking steps either way on sterling at this point,\" said Michael Bell, global market strategist at JPMorgan.\n\nCraig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA, said the market was in for a rollercoaster.\n\n\"It's going to be a wild weekend which will make the market open next week all the more unpredictable. If the deal gets through Parliament, the pound could perform extremely well at the start of next week, despite having already rebounded more than 8 per cent from the lows a month ago,\" he wrote.\n\nReuters", "description": "The pound raced to a five-month high and British shares rallied as the news of a Brexit deal broke - but the upswing was temporary.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2648%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_95/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/630bf0b57b87b7aa4914e8737cde78bcb35dd2fe", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
