You can form your own view.

Everyone was slowing right down and also blocking the way, so you couldn\u2019t really get through. It was pretty dangerous,\u201d added the Mercedes driver.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

You bleed a couple of tenths... it\u2019s more knowing that you\u2019re helping everyone else.\n\n\u201cI think we should probably just get a talking to and make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again because we all miss out and so do the fans. The real winners were the Leclerc fans \u2013 they certainly won.\u201d\n\nReuters", "description": "Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton suggested on Saturday it might take a crash before the sport did anything to prevent qualifying turning into a farce at high-speed circuits like Monza.
