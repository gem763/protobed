Robert Menendez (D-NJ), Dick Durbin (D-IL) and Patrick Leahy (D-VT) reportedly sent a threatening letter to Ukraine last year demanding they help in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into potential Russian collusion. They were specifically interested in former campaign manager Paul Manafort's role.\n\nAccording to Sen. Rand Paul, those three threatened to pair back military aid for Ukraine if the country didn't honor their request.\n\nSo, \u201cIf you\u2019re going to condemn Trump, you need to condemn the Democrat senators,\u201d Paul told \u201cMeet the Press\u201d host Chuck Todd on Sunday.\n\nRand Paul: \u201cFour senators, Democrats, wrote a letter to the Ukrainian government and said, \u2018If you don't keep investigating Trump we may reconsider our bipartisan support for your aid ... Someone needs to actually, in an objective way, evaluate [the] letter ...

Paul, the senators informed Ukraine, \"If you don\u2019t keep investigating Trump, we may reconsider our bipartisan support for your aid.\"\n\nSound familiar? That's the sort of quid pro quo Democrats are accusing Trump of when he called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky back in July. A whistleblower accused Trump of threatening to withhold military aid if Zelensky didn't agree to investigate his political opponent Hunter Biden. The White House released the phone transcript and, while it did show Trump ask about the Bidens, it did not corroborate the quid pro quo narrative.\n\n\"If anything is consistent here, it\u2019s that both parties have tried to involve themselves in Ukraine,\" Paul observed.\n\nIt piqued Donald Trump Jr.'s interest. He suggested it sounded fishy enough to warrant a separate investigation, and cc'd a few relevant parties.\n\nSomeone needs to \"objectively evaluate\" that Democrat-authored letter, Paul stated.", "description": ".10/14/2019 19:17:24PM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Matt Vespa", "Julio Rosas", "Katie Pavlich", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/townhall/reu/o/2018/334/500e1dcf-10ac-42f9-aeb4-5a0d867010b6.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
