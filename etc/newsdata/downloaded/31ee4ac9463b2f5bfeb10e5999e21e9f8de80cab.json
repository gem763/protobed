REUTERS/Henry Nicholls\n\nGENEVA (Reuters) - British trade secretary Liz Truss said she opposed protectionism but backed U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s calls to reform the World Trade Organization (WTO).\n\nHer comments came on a visit to the WTO\u2019s Geneva headquarters on Wednesday, where she was seeking to ease fears of trade disruptions before a potential no-deal Brexit.\n\nWithin the organization, Britain has been represented by the European Union until now. It will get its own seat if it quits the EU as planned.\n\n\u201c... I can assure you we will be unapologetic in fighting the forces of protectionism, in favour of genuinely free trade,\u201d Truss said in a speech to the International Chamber of Commerce in Geneva. She attended a meeting with WTO Director-General Roberto Azevedo later on Wednesday.\n\nBritain revised a tariff regime on Tuesday in the event of a no-deal Brexit to make 88% of imports eligible for tariff-free access. Much uncertainty remains about the impact of Brexit on trade, however.\n\nBritain\u2019s expanded role in the WTO comes amid criticism from Washington, which has brought its seven-member Appellate Body \u2014 effectively the supreme court of trade \u2014 to the brink of collapse by blocking the appointment of new judges. After December, the court will have only one judge.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump has said he wants the WTO to modernise, and I agree,\u201d Truss said in the speech. However, she pledged support for a diplomatic process meant to resolve the crisis at the court.\n\n\u201cWe must work together to resolve the Appellate Body impasse,\u201d she said. She also urged action on liberalising digital trade and on fish subsidies negotiations.", "description": "British trade secretary Liz Truss said she opposed protectionism but backed U.S. President Donald Trump's calls to reform the World Trade Organization (WTO).", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438808560&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF980YV", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
