Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 28, 2019\n\nABC News reported that the dog\u2019s breed is a Belgian Malinois \u2014 the same breed as the dog that was involved in the raid to get Osama bin Laden.\n\nNEW detail. A US official confirms that the dog used in the Baghdadi raid is a Belgian Malinois. FYI: Same breed as Cairo, the dog used in the Bin Laden raid. \u2014 luis martinez (@LMartinezABC) October 28, 2019\n\nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Army Gen. Mark Milley gave an update on the dog\u2019s health during a press conference Monday.\n\n\u201cThe dog is still in theater. The dog, the K-9, the military working dog performed a tremendous service as they all do in a variety of situations. Slightly wounded, and fully recovering, but the dog is still in theater, returned to duty with its handler,\u201d Milley said.\n\nPentagon officials are also looking at whether the dog is eligible for a Purple Heart, but indicated it could depend on the extent of the injuries.\n\nTrump praised the dog during a press conference on Monday.\n\n\u201cOur K-9, as they call \u2014 I call it a dog, a beautiful dog, a talented dog \u2014 was injured and brought back. But we had no soldier injured,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump indicated that the dog chased al-Baghdadi into a tunnel and helped prevent U.S. forces from being hurt.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredible that nobody was killed \u2014 or hurt. We had nobody even hurt. And that\u2019s why the dog was so great,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump also said the U.S. forces involved in the operation will be invited to the White House.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll be invited. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll want to have their faces shown, to be honest with you. You know, they want to \u2014 they\u2019re incredible for the country. They\u2019re not looking for public relations,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut they love doing what they\u2019re doing. I\u2019ve seen it. The first lady was out there recently looking at what they do. She came back; she said, \u2018Wow, I\u2019ve never seen anything like that.\u2019 The training \u2014 you know, all of the training \u2014 and the power of the people,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cThe men and women, the strength, the physical strength, the mental strength. These are incredible people. These are very unique individuals.\u201d\n\nFollow Breitbart News\u2019s @Kristina_Wong.", "description": "Trump tweeted a photo of the hero dog who chased ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi into a tunnel, forcing him to blow himself up.", "authors": ["Kristina Wong"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/EH_acyVUYAElRgl-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
