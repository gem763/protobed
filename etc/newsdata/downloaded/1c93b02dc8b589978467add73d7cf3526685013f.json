Billions of dollars ride on the answer", "language": "en", "text": "I\u2019m fascinated by WeWork. This innovative, shared-office provider is the latest poster child for companies that are disrupting established industries. Think of it as the Uber, Airbnb or Spotify of workspace.\n\nIts prospectus has enough superlatives to make you drool: \u201cThrough iterative product development at scale and significant investment in technology infrastructure, we have demonstrated that we can build better solutions for less money. We are changing the way people work globally and, in the process, we have disrupted the largest asset class in the world \u2014 real estate.\u201d\n\nThe company has a charismatic founder (Adam Neumann), strong backing from the world\u2019s boldest technology investor (Softbank\u2019s Masayoshi Son) and has been growing at a dizzying pace (from 23 to 528 locations in less than five years).\n\nEqually dizzying, however, is the company\u2019s valuation, which has risen with each round of private financing. The last share purchase by Son\u2019s Vision Fund valued the company, which didn\u2019t exist a decade ago, at US$47 billion.\n\nHitting a wall\n\nI\u2019m writing about WeWork now because the rocket ride has come to an abrupt halt. The company was set to go public, with its shares expected to begin trading this month. But this week, the initial public offering was withdrawn.\n\nReasons for the sudden turnaround are many. Neumann\u2019s shine didn\u2019t hold up under increased scrutiny and he was forced to resign. Fund managers balked at the mismatch between the company\u2019s long-term liabilities (office leases) and customers\u2019 short-term commitments. They were also concerned about the high valuation.\n\nIn trying to figure out where WeWork goes from here, it\u2019s important to understand the background.\n\nJust grow\n\nAs a private company, WeWork was given a free pass to grow with little regard for profits or balance sheet (it lost US$900 million in the first half of this year). Neumann was able to position it as a technology company, and private equity investors were enthusiastic buyers (US$8-billion worth). They didn\u2019t want to miss out if WeWork did indeed revolutionize the workspace.\n\n\u201cAs we build and open more locations within existing markets, expand to new markets and scale our suite of products and services, we increase the value of our platform to our members and create additional capacity for incremental monetization of our platform,\u201d the prospectus reads.\n\n\n\nThis is a tune we\u2019ve heard before. When debt and equity capital is plentiful, emerging companies that are growing rapidly can turn their early success into a virtuous circle.\n\nGrowth allows them to raise money at a high valuation. Cheap capital fuels further revenue growth. Investors start to believe that the company can \u2018scale\u2019 and dominate its category. More capital follows. More growth. And so on.\n\nIdeally, companies ride the wave to a place where they\u2019re profitable and no longer require outside capital. Unfortunately, they don\u2019t always get there.\n\nFuel shortage\n\nWeWork may prove to be a live example of what happens when the tap turns off before the company is self-sustaining. Without new equity from the IPO (and more limited debt financing as a result), the company will need to raise money elsewhere or quickly rein in its sizeable losses.\n\nIf there\u2019s no new capital, the pace of expansion will slow (or stop), and revenue growth will fall commensurately. And without rapid growth, WeWork risks getting compared to, and valued like, other real estate companies, not industry-changing disruptors.\n\nHard questions\n\nWeWork is committed to becoming a public company and \u201celevating the world\u2019s consciousness.\u201d When it comes back to market, investors will be asking hard questions.\n\nCan the company be a disruptor and turn a low-margin, cyclical business into a growth industry?\n\nIs it growing the revenue pie, or just cutting it up differently?\n\nIf WeWork is expanding faster than its competitors, will they respond? What\u2019s it able to do that the others aren\u2019t?\n\nDo WeWork\u2019s office leases and customer mix translate into better or worse profit margins? How many of the 528 leases will turn out to be duds (a company can\u2019t grow that fast and not make mistakes)?\n\nCan the business model survive a recession when corporate customers go into cost-cutting mode and capital gets tighter?\n\nAnd the clincher: Is WeWork the next Amazon \u2014 or the next Valeant?\n\nTom Bradley is President of Steadyhand Investment Funds, a company that offers individual investors low-fee investment funds and clear-cut advice.
