Many of Trump\u2019s cronies and foot soldiers have already spun this line, from Donald Trump Jr. to Rudy Giuliani to Arthur Schwartz.\n\nOthers have rightly pointed out that, in reality, Biden was not simply relaying the message pushed by the Obama administration, but that his position was supported by Ukrainian anti-corruption activists, European allies, and even groups like the International Monetary Foundation (IMF). As Tom Malinowski, former assistant secretary of state under Obama, recalled this week, \u201cAll of us working on Ukraine wanted this prosecutor gone, because he was NOT prosecuting corruption. So did the Europeans. So did the IMF. This didn't come from Joe Biden\u2014he just delivered our message.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s all, of course, true. Anyone interested in the success of Ukraine\u2019s democratic transition, and its efforts to clean up rampant corruption, wanted Shokin gone. But here\u2019s something that seems to have been lost in this geopolitical shuffle. Not only was Biden not trying to protect his son, Hunter, who was then working at a Ukrainian energy company named Burisma. If anything, what the former vice president did was make the prosecution of his son\u2019s company more likely, not less\u2014a fact that seems to have been overlooked, but which flips Trump\u2019s lies on their head.", "description": "In pushing to oust the former prosecutor, Biden did the right thing, no matter the personal cost.", "authors": ["Casey Michel"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569614319/dd_teqeoy", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
