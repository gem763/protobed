That has the potential of damaging the brands\u2019 reputation. They are already dealing with questions about spreading disinformation and failing to respect users\u2019 privacy.", "description": "Lawmakers investigating Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google for possible antitrust violations on Friday sent the companies detailed requests for information.", "authors": ["Steve Lohr"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/13/us/13-ANTITRUST-promo/13-ANTITRUST-promo-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
