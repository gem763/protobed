Anthony Brindisi (D-N.Y.), a co-chairman of the Blue Dog Coalition who faces a tough reelection race. \u201cThat\u2019s not helping people in my district.\u201d\n\nBrindisi called for a greater focus on finding common ground with GOP lawmakers on something that could be signed into law. He said he had communicated that \u201cto leadership and anyone who will listen around here.\u201d\n\nProgressives, though, are pushing for a range of changes, such as increasing the minimum number of drugs that will be subject to negotiation, up from 35, and fully repealing the ban on Medicare negotiating drug prices. As the bill stands now, it creates an exception allowing a limited number of drugs to be negotiated, rather than fully repealing the ban.\n\nProgressives have vowed to push for floor votes on amendments if leadership does not agree to make their changes beforehand.\n\nThey are also looking to protect a Jayapal amendment, adopted in committee, to ensure it is not stripped out of the final bill because of objections by moderates. The provision would extend protections against drug price increases to people in private employer-sponsored insurance plans, not just those on Medicare.\n\nPelosi\u2019s office has expressed concerns about the feasibility of Jayapal\u2019s amendment and other proposed changes by progressives, like increasing the number of drugs that will be negotiated, sources say.\n\nSome progressives argue the feasibility concerns raised by Pelosi\u2019s office are just an excuse to avoid moving the bill to the left and alienating moderates.\n\nJayapal has been adamant that her amendment needs to be included.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re fine with strengthening it, but not to the point where we\u2019re going to strip it, that\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d she said, noting her staff had communicated this message to leadership. \u201cIt\u2019s either this or it\u2019s better, but it\u2019s not gone.\u201d\n\nShe declined to say if she would vote against the bill if her amendment is omitted.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just going to keep pushing to get it in,\u201d she said.\n\nMore broadly, she said she did not understand why moderates were objecting to further changes to strengthen the legislation.\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t understand why, because this is not a partisan bill,\u201d she said. \u201cEverybody ran on prescription drug pricing.\u201d\n\nRep. Ron Kind Ronald (Ron) James KindAmerica's workers and small business owners need the SECURE Act Blood cancer patients deserve equal access to the cure Democrats see whistleblower report as smoking gun MORE (D-Wis.), a centrist, said leadership and committee chairmen had struck a \u201csensitive balance\u201d in the legislation.\n\n\u201cDeveloping consensus on something as important as drug pricing is always a challenge around here,\u201d he said.\n\nIncreasing the number of drugs to be negotiated, a move backed by progressives, could lead to \u201ccapacity\u201d problems at the Department of Health and Human Services, Kind warned.\n\nHe said he supports the bill as it is but wouldn\u2019t say whether that stance would change if it moves further left. \u201cLet\u2019s see what the final product looks like,\u201d he said.\n\nLobbyists expect that the only drug pricing measures that have a chance of being signed into law are much smaller, bipartisan measures that increase competition from cheaper generic drugs. Those smaller bills have a greater chance of being attached to a must-pass government funding package.\n\nDrug company lobbyists are still fighting Pelosi\u2019s bill, though, and have targeted moderate House Democrats to try to get some of them to vote against it.\n\nBrindisi, the Blue Dog co-chairman, said he plans to vote for Pelosi\u2019s bill as it currently stands.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to support it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to see the light of day in the Senate.\u201d", "description": "Moderate and progressive House Democrats are clashing with each other over changes to Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s (D-Calif.) signature plan to lower drug prices.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/murphystephanie_071819gn_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
