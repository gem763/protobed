You could also say, who needs it? It\u2019s bad for the country,\u201d Trump told reporters.\n\n\u201cHow can you do this and you haven\u2019t even seen the phone call?\u201d Trump asked. \"The good news is the voters get it. This is why they say it\u2019s good for the election, but you know what? It\u2019s bad for the country. What she\u2019s doing is very bad.\u201d\n\nTrump took to Twitter late in the day to let Americans know he authorized the release of the complete transcript of his conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nI am currently at the United Nations representing our Country, but have authorized the release tomorrow of the complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript of my phone conversation with President Zelensky of Ukraine.... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2019\n\n....You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call. No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo! This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2019\n\nThe Democrats are so focused on hurting the Republican Party and the President that they are unable to get anything done because of it, including legislation on gun safety, lowering of prescription drug prices, infrastructure, etc. So bad for our Country! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2019\n\nAfter Speaker Nancy Pelosi made her announcement saying the House of Representatives is beginning formal impeachment proceedings, Trump took to Twitter to comment on the situation.\n\nPelosi, Nadler, Schiff and, of course, Maxine Waters! Can you believe this? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2019\n\nThey never even saw the transcript of the call. A total Witch Hunt! \u2014 Donald J.
