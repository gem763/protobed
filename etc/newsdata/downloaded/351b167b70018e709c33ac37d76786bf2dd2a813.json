We haven\u2019t spoken to the TMO yet,\u201d McKee said.\n\n\u201cThe referee has a tough job out there. There\u2019s a lot going on. We maybe didn\u2019t get the rub of the green, but we have no complaints about the referee.\n\n\u201cWe take a lot out of that game and we are still in this tournament. We will be watching how Wales and Australia go. We\u2019re still in this tournament.\u201d\n\nWaqaniburotu revealed that the tackle was missed by New Zealand referee O\u2019Keeffe.\n\n\u201cHe said he didn\u2019t see anything so it will be referred to the TMO. We will just have to see what happens,\u201d Waqaniburotu said.\n\nAustralia head coach Michael Cheika also said he did not see the tackle, but noted that \u201cthe collision was a massive one and a try-saver\u201d.\n\nCheika added: \u201cFiji came out with a lot of aggression and they caught us on the hop early on. But we got out of it with a bonus-point win, so it\u2019s a good start for us.\u201d\n\nCheika also questioned why the officials were having an ongoing discussion during the match about his blindside flanker David Pocock.\n\nPA", "description": "World Rugby\u2019s crackdown on dangerous tackles has ignited controversy just two games into the Rugby World Cup 2019 after Australia \u00a0wing Reece Hodge escaped a red card against Fiji.
