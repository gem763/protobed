The tycoon has been in a protracted legal battle with the authorities over control of Urkaine's biggest bank.\n\nKolomoisky is president of the United Jewish Community of Ukraine, one of several Jewish community bodies in the country.\n\n\"Another disturbing act of anti-Semitism ... I hope that the law enforcement agencies will promptly arrest the perpetrators,\" Joel Lion said in a statement on the embassy's Twitter feed where a picture of the effigy was also published. The life-size effigy was dressed in dark trousers and a green sweater, covered by large red spots of paint.\n\n\"Ukraine has to do more to fight anti-Semitism, if not, violence will spread from effigies to human beings,\" said the ambassador.\n\nKiev police told Reuters they had launched a criminal investigation over hooliganism but had not identified the people involved yet. They did not give additional details.\n\nKolomoisky did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the incident.\n\nLast year rights groups Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, Front Line Defenders and Freedom House wrote an open letter to the authorities under a previous government urging them to do more to tackle cases of attacks and intimidation of by radical groups.\n\nUkraine nationalized its largest lender PrivatBank in 2016 against the wishes of owner Kolomoisky and his business partner.\n\nA court in Kiev on Thursday suspended hearing one of the cases brought by Kolomoisky to overturn the nationalization.\n\nThe court was surrounded by dozens of protesters who support the nationalization of the bank, and the court building was emptied at one point because of a bomb scare.
