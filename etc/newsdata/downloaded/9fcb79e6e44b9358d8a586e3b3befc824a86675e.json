Anxiety, depression, and suicidality have increased to unprecedented levels among younger people. Meanwhile, deaths from drugs and suicide\u2014so-called \"deaths of despair,\" which are concentrated in the white working class\u2014have soared in the last two decades, recently reaching the highest levels ever recorded by the federal government. Across generations, Americans seem to be suffering from, and dying of, new levels of loneliness in an age of crumbling institutions.\n\nThe older working-class men in the Edin, Nelson, et al paper desperately want meaning in their lives, but they lack the social structures that have historically been the surest vehicles for meaning-making. They want to be fathers without nuclear families. They want spirituality without organized religion. They want psychic empowerment from work in an economy that has reduced their economic power. They want freedom from pain and misery at a time when the pharmaceutical solutions to those maladies are addictive and deadly. They want the same pride and esteem and belonging that people have always wanted.\n\nThe ends of Millennials and Gen-Z are similarly traditional. The NBC/WSJ poll found that, for all their institutional skepticism, this group was more likely than Gen-Xers to value \u201ccommunity involvement\u201d and more likely than all older groups to prize \u201ctolerance for others.\u201d This is not the picture of a generation that has fallen into hopelessness, but rather a group that is focused on building solidarity with other victims of economic and social injustice. Younger generations have been the force behind equality movements like #BlackLivesMatter, #MeToo, #AbolishICE, and Medicare for All, not only because they\u2019re liberal, and not only because they have the technological savvy to organize across the Internet, but also because their experience in this economy makes them exquisitely sensitive to institutional abuses of power, and doubly eager to correct it. What Americans young and old are abandoning is not so much the promise of family, faith, and national pride, but the trust that America\u2019s existing institutions can be relied on to provide for them.\n\nDerek Thompson: Millennials didn\u2019t kill the economy. The economy killed Millennials.\n\nThe authors of the paper on working-class men note that, even as their subjects have suffered a shock, and even as they\u2019re nostalgic for the lives of their fathers and grandfathers\u2014the stable wages, the dependable pensions\u2014there is a thin silver lining in the freedom to move beyond failed traditions. Those old manufacturing jobs were routine drudgery, those old churches failed their congregants, and traditional marriages subjugated the female half of the arrangement. \u201cThese men are showing signs of moving beyond such strictures,\u201d the authors write. \u201cMany will likely falter. Yet they are laying claim to a measure of autonomy and generativity in these spheres that were less often available in prior generations. We must consider both the unmaking and remaking aspects of their stories.\u201d\n\nAnd there is the brutal truth: Many will likely falter. They already are. Rising anxiety, suicide, and deaths of despair speak to a profound national disorder. But eventually, this stage of history may be recalled as a purgatory, a holding station between two eras\u2014an era of ostensibly strong, and quietly vulnerable, traditions that ultimately failed us, and something else; between the unmaking and the remaking.", "description": "The nuclear family, God, and national pride are a holy trinity of the American identity.
