Despite nationwide decreases in smoking over the decades, lighting up remains the country\u2019s leading cause of preventable disease.\n\nLuckily, writes Indiana University medical professor Richard Gunderman, there\u2019s a test that can save smokers\u2019 lives, even among those who have been on cigarettes for years. It\u2019s CT lung cancer screening, and Gunderman makes a case for the tool at the Conversation, a not-for-profit media outlet.\n\nIn CT lung cancer screening, a low-dose X-ray machine scans patients\u2019 lungs. The images that result can help pinpoint the telltale signs of cancer. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that people with a history of heavy smoking who smoke now or have quit within the past 15 years and who are between ages 55 and 80 get the screening yearly.\n\nBut too few take advantage of the test, Gunderman writes. \u201cMany patients and even some physicians simply don\u2019t know about the test, and even patients who do may decline to undergo it,\u201d he writes.\n\nGunderman makes a compelling argument about why the technique should be better known \u2014 and what early detection can do for those who do have lung cancer. Though false positives do occur in some cases, that risk is outweighed by the potential benefit of the test for qualified patients. Lung cancer symptoms, such as coughing up blood, only occur once cancer is advanced, Gunderman writes. In contrast, CT scans can detect lung cancers in their early stages.\n\nFor some lifelong smokers, warnings to quit can seem as stale as old cigarette smoke. CT lung cancer screening can\u2019t undo the effects of smoking, but it can detect lung cancer before it\u2019s too late to treat.
