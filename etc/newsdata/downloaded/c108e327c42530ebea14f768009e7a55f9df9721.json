Doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nThe post elicited divergent reactions among DeGeneres\u2019 fellow Hollywood celebrities.\n\nVeronica Mars star Kristen Bell posted a glowing tribute to DeGeneres on Instagram but came under almost immediate social media fire for her \u201cprivilege.\u201d\n\nOne commenter noted, \u201cThis takes an insane amount of privilege. Veronica Mars would never.\u201d Another commenter said, \u201cYour queen is getting cozy with a war criminal. I expected better.\u201d\n\nReese Witherspoon reportedly tweeted in support of DeGeneres but deleted the tweet following public backlash.\n\n\u201cThank you for this important reminder, Ellen!\u201d the Oscar-winning Walk the Line actress wrote, before the tweet vanished from her account.\n\n\u201cPrivilege must be comfortable,\u201d wrote one commenter in response to Witherspoon\u2019s tweet.\n\nOther celebrities have rebuked DeGeneres for her call for civility.\n\nAvengers: Endgame star Mark Ruffalo tweeted his distaste for President Bush and DeGeneres.\n\n\u201cSorry, until George W. Bush is brought to justice for the crimes of the Iraq War, (including American-lead torture, Iraqi deaths & displacement, and the deep scars\u2014emotional & otherwise\u2014inflicted on our military that served his folly), we can\u2019t even begin to talk about kindness,\u201d the actor tweeted.\n\nSorry, until George W.
