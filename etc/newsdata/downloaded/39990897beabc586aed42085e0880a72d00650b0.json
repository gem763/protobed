But in August last year 30-year-old Kellie Sutton was found hanged in her home, leaving her loved ones devastated and baffled.\n\nThere had to be more to it, her family said. As far as they knew she hadn\u2019t suffered from depression and she\u2019d never willingly have left her children without a mother.\n\nThe authorities ordered an investigation into the young woman\u2019s death \u2013 and the outcome is something that\u2019s changed the course of UK legal history.\n\nThe probe found that Kellie, who\u2019s from Welwyn Garden City in Hertfordshire, north of London, had been driven to suicide, and in a recent landmark ruling her boyfriend was sentenced to four years and three months behind bars.\n\n\u201cYou beat her and ground her down and broke her spirit,\u201d Judge Philip Grey told Steven Gane (31) in his no-holdsbarred judgment. Gane was found guilty of coercive control \u2013 also known as gaslighting \u2013 which was criminalised in the UK in 2015.\n\nThis was the first time a conviction had been handed down after the death of a victim, and British police welcomed the sentence as a milestone for the new legislation.\n\nThe term gaslighting comes from the 1944 Oscar-winning thriller Gaslight starring Ingrid Bergman, in which a killer tries to slowly manipulate his wife into thinking she\u2019s going crazy.\n\nThe couple have gaslights in their home and when the husband switches the attic lights on, the lights in the rest of the house become dimmer. But when the woman asks her husband what\u2019s going on he tells her she\u2019s imagining things.\n\nGaslighting is a tactic used to gain power and control and is a common technique employed by abusers, dictators, narcissists and cult leaders. Kellie\u2019s devastated mom, Pamela Taylor, said what Gane, a former soldier, did to her beautiful daughter has left her heartbroken.\n\n\u201cHe made her feel worthless and unloved. Nothing could be further from the truth. Long after he\u2019s out of prison we shall still grieve her loss.\u201d\n\nIt was Gane who discovered Kellie hanging from a rope around her neck. She was unconscious but never came to, and life support was switched off three days later. Just five months earlier Kellie had been positive and vivacious \u2013 then she met Gane in a pub near her home.\n\nNot long afterwards she\u2019d transformed into a quiet, anxious person. Her friend Alexia Spathas (30) says she knew straightaway there was something off about Kellie\u2019s new boyfriend.\n\n\u201cShe was a single mom with three kids [aged between four and 14] and he must have sensed she was vulnerable,\u201d Alexia says.\n\nWithin weeks Gane had moved in and started doing things around the house and buying things \u201cto make her feel like she relied on him\u201d, Alexia adds.\n\n\u201cI told her to stay away from him because he seemed controlling.\u201d Pamela was just happy her daughter had \u201csomeone in her life\u201d \u2013 but in court she discovered just how badly her daughter had been abused.\n\n\u201cHaving to listen to what she went through was harrowing. He\u2019s pure evil. \u201cWe were close but Kellie never told me anything was wrong. I know why \u2013 she didn\u2019t want to upset me. And when ever I was with them he was fine. To me they were like a normal couple.\u201d\n\nBut behind closed doors Gane subjected Kellie to what the judge described as \u201cdomineering and grossly humiliating behaviour\u201d. He was physically violent, pinning her to the floor and throttling her because she\u2019d gone out without telling him.Other forms of abuse were more subtle.\n\nHe kept her bank card, and searched her bedroom to see if men had been there. He called her a slut and accused her of cheating on him, even sniffing her underwear to see if she\u2019d been unfaithful.\n\nDisturbing messages Kellie sent to Gane were read out during the two-week trial, painting a picture of a toxic relationship.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fed up of this s**t prisoner life,\u201d she wrote in one. \u201cAll you\u2019re going to do is moan and beat me all afternoon,\u201d another read.\n\nThings escalated when Kellie had been due to visit her middle child, who lives with her paternal grandparents in Bournemouth in the south of England. She and Gane fought before she left and Kellie ended up in hospital with a 3cm gash in her head.\n\n\u201cShe told us they were play-fighting and she banged her head,\u201d Pamela recalls. \u201cNow I wonder if it was to stop her going away.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the only gaslighting case to have made headlines in the UK recently. Natalie Lewis-Hoyle (28), the daughter of British MP Miriam Lewis, was found hanged in her home in Heybridge, Essex, in December.\n\nMiriam says Natalie was driven to take her own life because she was in psychological torment\u201dfrom her two-and-a-half-year toxic relationship with her boyfriend, and it affected the whole family.\n\nMiriam has now launched a website to raise awareness about gaslighting. \u201cNatalie was a really feisty character and you wouldn\u2019t think it would get to her,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cBut quite often the people who are controlled in relationships are in fact intelligent women because they overthink and try to rationalise it. They don\u2019t realise what\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\nUnlike in Kellie\u2019s case, an inquest found no third party had been involved. \u201cI accept the outcome,\u201d Miriam says. \u201cBut this isn\u2019t something I\u2019m going to be able to put out of my head. She was a tiny person \u2013 a teeny, tiny person. She was a pocket rocket, just a whole bundle of energy.\u201d Now she\u2019s gone, Miriam says. And she\u2019s determined to stop it from happening to other people.", "description": "It just didn\u2019t make sense \u2013 she was full of life and independent and she adored her three kids.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9465/9b89d32e1e59476c8e7230fa36bd0fc4.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
