But each one of those white sticks contains a rechargeable battery marching toward an untimely death in as little as two years. Apple\u2019s plan to deal with that reality is just to sell us new ear buds. When your AirPods\u2019 day comes, the only option is to ask Apple for discounted replacements \u2014 but you\u2019ll need to know its code word to even get that.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNot long ago, headphones were among the most universal, long-lasting electronics. We shouldn\u2019t let Apple turn them into expensive, disposable electronics. It\u2019s hurting our wallets \u2014 and the environment.\n\nApple doesn\u2019t dispute that the lithium-ion batteries inside AirPods wear out. \u201cAll rechargeable batteries have a limited life span and may eventually need to be serviced or recycled,\u201d Apple says on its website. Replacing batteries is very common on phones and laptops. In 2018, Apple stores got deluged when the company offered to replace the batteries in older iPhones for $29.\n\nBut with AirPods, Apple offers far less help. First, there\u2019s no way to determine the health of the batteries in the ear buds or their charging case. Apple won\u2019t even share guidelines on their life expectancy. \u201cAirPods are built to be long-lasting,\u201d said Apple spokeswoman Lori Lodes, without specifics. Mine went for 34 months; others have reported they die as soon as 18 months.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhen your AirPod batteries finally go, even Apple\u2019s employees are confused about your options. Across three separate support encounters in the store and online, they told me I had to buy a replacement pair for $138, nearly the price of a whole new set. But I remembered Apple had once told me it would service depleted batteries for $49. I reported that in The Post, along with my recommendation to buy AirPods. So what gives?\n\nAfter weeks of back-and-forth with Apple \u2014 and refusing to take no for an answer at the store \u2014 I finally got answers:\n\nIf your AirPods are less than a year old and the battery is not performing up to the promised five hours of listening time, an Apple store will replace them at no cost.\n\nApple recently began selling its AppleCare+ warranty for $29, which covers the battery, too. But this extended warranty lasts only two years \u2014 which wouldn\u2019t have been long enough to save my AirPods.\n\nIf your AirPods are out of warranty, Apple will replace them for $49 per stick \u2014 so in reality, $98 total. A replacement for the charging case, which doesn\u2019t wear out as quickly, is also $49. The key phrase to say is \u201cbattery service.\u201d (Apple is providing additional training to customer service representatives on that point, but if you still have trouble, show them this link \u2014 or this column.)\n\nA $98 battery fix is still mighty expensive. Apple will replace the battery on an iPhone for as little as $49. An Apple Watch battery costs just $79. What makes AirPods so different? Because Apple\u2019s \u201cbattery service\u201d for AirPods is code for \u201cthrowing it away.\u201d Apple isn\u2019t repairing AirPods \u2014 it\u2019s just replacing the ear buds and recycling your old ones.\n\nTo understand why, I performed an autopsy on a dearly departed pair. Inside, I found the design of AirPods makes them inevitably obsolete.\n\nAn AirPod autopsy\n\nWhat could be so hard about replacing the battery in an AirPod? I don\u2019t ordinarily go CSI on gadgets, so I sought advice from some folks who do.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nKyle Wiens, the CEO of repair website iFixit, offers instructions on how to disassemble electronics and sells replacement parts. The first time Wiens tried to get inside an AirPod, he cut himself and bled all over it. Another time, the battery combusted in a poof of smoke on his team.\n\nAirPods were never meant to be opened, Wiens warned me.\n\nBut I wanted to see for myself. With Wiens watching, I began the operation with the silver cap at the end of the AirPod stick. You might think it unscrews to let you get inside. No such luck. It\u2019s glued in there, and I couldn\u2019t yank it out even after carefully heating the AirPod to loosen the glue. That meant I had to cut in \u2014 and to save my fingers, Wiens loaned me a special vibrating knife that slices plastic.\n\nAD\n\nInside the AirPod, I found so much glue I couldn\u2019t even tug out the now-exposed end of the battery with tweezers. So I cut very carefully along the edges of the AirPod stick, to crack open a section like the top of a coconut. There, at last, was the battery, about as thick as a large spaghetti noodle.\n\nAD\n\nI had avoided spilling blood, but after all the cutting I still had a problem: My AirPod was now a Humpty Dumpty in so many pieces I\u2019d never be able to reassemble it again. Wiens said he\u2019d tried this five times, across both the first- and second-generation AirPods, and awarded AirPods a repairability score of zero out of 10. \u201cThere is no way we can feasibly understand taking the battery out without completely destroying the AirPod,\u201d he said.\n\nI asked Apple whether that was true. It didn\u2019t answer.\n\nGreenwashing is in fashion\n\nThe cause of death on my AirPods was clear: bad product design.\n\nAD\n\nEarlier this year, the website Vice called AirPods a \u201ctragedy\u201d of disposable wealth. I see them as a symptom of Apple\u2019s preoccupation with thin products. It\u2019s the tech-world version of fashion\u2019s fixation on skinny models, where Apple sets the trend and other manufacturers feel pressure to follow.\n\nAD\n\nExcessive thinness isn\u2019t healthy for gadgets, either. Apple\u2019s desire to shave a few millimeters off designs has resulted in MacBook keyboards that fail, iPads that catch fire at recycling centers and now millions of AirPods that will probably end up in the trash.\n\nSealing up electronics with glue instead of screws and latches can help make devices lighter and more resistant to moisture and dust. But great ear buds \u2014 even ones tiny enough to sit in your ears \u2014 don\u2019t have to be impenetrable. iFixit found a way to pop open Samsung\u2019s $129 Galaxy Buds, so replacement batteries can slip in kind of like on a watch. Samsung doesn\u2019t officially offer this repair option, but iFixit sells a pair of replacement batteries for $29.\n\nAD\n\nApple\u2019s disposable AirPod design is expensive for us. But it\u2019s doing permanent damage to our environment. That\u2019s not how Apple talks about it, though.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cApple\u2019s products are designed with the environment in mind,\u201d said Lodes, the Apple spokeswoman. \u201cEverything from the materials we select to the way we approach recycling is meant to leave the world better than we found it.\u201d\n\nHow exactly are AirPods designed with the environment in mind? Because you can bring them to Apple to be recycled. \u201cWe work closely with our recyclers to ensure AirPods are properly recycled and provide support to recyclers outside of our supply chain as well,\u201d said Lodes.\n\nThat\u2019s like saying your daily paper coffee cup habit is good for the environment because you always put it in the recycling bin. AirPods may actually be worse than that: They\u2019re so small, there\u2019s isn\u2019t much material that can be recycled from them. Significant energy, water and materials go just into the process of making AirPods.\n\nThe golden rule for helping the earth is to produce less new stuff. Electronics companies can do that by making their products last as long as possible through repair and reuse \u2014 which are all but impossible with AirPods.\n\nIn the Greenpeace 2017 Guide to Greener Electronics, Apple got a \u201cB-\u201d grade overall because of its commitments to using renewable energy and efforts to create a closed-loop supply chain. But the environmental group gave Apple a \u201cD\u201d in the category of product life extension, because it has \u201cconsistently made it more difficult for customers to repair their devices, replace their batteries, or upgrade the devices so that they continue to stay in use.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nApple isn\u2019t the only tech company guilty of pushing consumption over repair. New $130 headphones from Amazon called Echo Buds contain batteries that can\u2019t be repaired, the company told me. (Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.) Microsoft says it would also replace an entire unit when the battery fails on its $249 Surface Earbuds.\n\nBefore this trend continues, let\u2019s agree on a common-sense rule suggested by Wiens: The life span of an expensive, resource-intensive gadget shouldn\u2019t be limited to the life span of one consumable component. You wouldn\u2019t buy an electric toothbrush where you couldn\u2019t replace the brush. Or a car with glued-on tires.\n\nApple kept fundamentally the same design for AirPods between its first- and second-generation of the headphones, which debuted in March. Now, the Apple rumor mill has lit up with hints of forthcoming third-generation AirPods in pre-release code for iOS 13.2.\n\nLet\u2019s hope this time around, AirPods really are \u201cdesigned with the environment in mind.\u201d Not to mention our wallets.\n\nRead more tech advice and analysis from Geoffrey A.
