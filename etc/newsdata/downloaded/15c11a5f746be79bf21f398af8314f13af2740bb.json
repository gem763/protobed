Barraud is a strategist and chief economist at the broker dealer Market Securities.\n\nBefore dismissing him as just another financial pundit, you should know that he was the most accurate forecaster of US economic data for seven straight years through 2018, according to Bloomberg's annual rankings. His expectations for the Euro economy have been the closest to reality from 2015 through 2018, and he was the most accurate on China in 2017 and 2018.\n\nBarraud's forecasting prowess came to bear again in January, when he opined that the consensus was too bullish on the prospects for a trade resolution in particular and global growth in general.\n\nSince then, trade between the US and China countries has been in freefall \u2014 to the extent that the quarterly contractions since Q4 2018 have put trade in its own mini-recession, according to Barraud.\n\nThis damage has not been confined to the arena of cross-border relations.\n\nLast week, investors got two fresh pieces of bad news confirming this spillover that Barraud has been warning about. First came the Institute of Supply Management's manufacturing index, which dropped to 47.8, the metric's lowest since June 2009. ISM then released its report on the larger and more important services sector, which expanded at its slowest pace in three years.\n\nCompanies in both sectors pinned the slowdown in activity on the trade conflict.\n\nA cursory look at overall trade activity between the US and China \u2014 illustrated in the charts below \u2014 shows why companies are under strain. Since both countries are trading fewer goods with each other, executives are faced with higher costs, and have to find alternative ways to maintain profit margins.\n\nMarket Securities\n\nAs investors anticipate a fresh round of US-China negotiations this month, the risks are skewed towards \"a prolonged global slowdown,\" Barraud said in a recent note.\n\nRead more: An investor overseeing $64 billion discusses 3 trades that are protecting her portfolio from unexpected shocks, and helping her crush most of her peers\n\nHe's of this view because of the potential damage that the next round of tariffs would inflict.\n\nOn October 15, the Trump administration plans to raise the tariff rate on $250 billion worth of Chinese products from 25% from 30%. Then on Dec. 15, the US will impose a 15% tariff on nearly all imports \u2014 and they will hit a broad swath of consumer-facing products like cellphones, smartwatches, and Christmas ornaments.\n\nOn top of all this, Barraud notes that businesses may put their capital spending plans on hold next year while they await the outcome of the US elections and what it means for them. They would also be grappling with a fading tax-cut boost in the new year.\n\nEven if the Trump administration reached a partial deal, it won't resolve the long-term structural conflict between the US and China \u2014 especially if it scores another election victory, Barraud said.\n\nAll these risks have solidified investors' expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this month and afterwards if necessary, providing a key lifeline for the record-long bull market.\n\nHowever, the Fed can only do so much if the economic fundamentals continue to deteriorate. And this is why you shouldn't let the specter of a prolonged slowdown catch you off guard.", "description": "Christophe Barraud, the most accurate forecaster of the US economy since 2012, explains why a speedy recovery from the trade war is unlikely.", "authors": ["Akin Oyedele"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5bc78bff7e4239064e7ccc2a?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
