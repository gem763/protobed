From his breakout \u201cJesus Walks\u201d to last year\u2019s ye, religion has always been, if not a fixation, than a thematic concern, something to pick at and analyze, to mythologize and aid in his own self-mythologization. While his ninth album, Jesus Is King, is his first to be classified as religious music, it\u2019s also the latest entry in a public diary West has been writing for 15 years, in which his relationship with Christianity is constantly shifting.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t attest to any religion that tells me that other people gotta go to hell,\u201d West said in 2008. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in a religion that has something against gay people. That has something against Muslims. That has something against Buddhists. You know? And I don\u2019t really believe in any of that. I really believe in absolute truth.\u201d His thoughts, obviously, have evolved in the decade since.\n\nMore from Rolling Stone\n\nOn Jesus Is King, West\u2019s relationship to Christianity and the Church is simpler. He\u2019s no longer poking at contradictions, but reveling in a newfound zeal. Though the album is not, strictly stylistically speaking, a gospel record, its steadfast call to worship is its defining feature. The scope here is narrow, a distillation that clearly brings West some measure of comfort, but it comes with a simplification of the music itself.\n\nLike every Kanye West album, Jesus Is King is filled with moments of undeniable brilliance. Though it will likely be placed alongside last year\u2019s ye as a distinctly lightweight entry in his canon (thanks in part to a brisk 27-minute runtime), the album reminds us that even West\u2019s lesser work can be capable of extreme dynamism. The sample of a 1974 tune by Christian soul act Whole Truth on \u201cFollow God\u201d is neck-snappingly good, the kind of textured punch that, still, only West seems capable of; the effervescent triumph of the \u201cOn God\u201d beat, the result of a Pi\u2019erre Bourne collaboration, is one of the most immediate joys available on Spotify right now; \u201cUse This Gospel\u201d is a glowing deployment of the stylistic muscle West developed on 2013\u2019s Yeezus.\n\nHowever, the strength of those moments are often derailed by the presence of West himself. Take \u201cSelah,\u201d the album\u2019s true kick-off after his Sunday Service Choir\u2019s introduction, and the first inessential album opener in West\u2019s oeuvre. It\u2019s a sweeping epic, lightly affected organs opening to bludgeoning percussion and a crescendoing choir singing only \u201challelujah,\u201d nearly unaccompanied, for 45 seconds. It\u2019s the kind of drama West can orchestrate in his sleep, and few others can convincingly execute. His rapping, though, capsizes the vessel. Sounding as if he were recorded from one room over, West is no longer the brash bandleader standing in the center of the storm. Instead, he\u2019s simply hanging on, delivering slightly more focused versions of screeds delivered last week in lengthy interviews. It\u2019s no secret that West\u2019s albums are often mined from whatever it is he\u2019s thinking about at that moment, but before his latest pivot he at least tried to add punchlines to his verses.\n\nTime and time again on Jesus Is King, West\u2019s presence front and center weakens his work as a producer. Kanye\u2019s rise is inseparable from his drive to prove people wrong: 15 years ago, a host of detractors told Kanye not to rap \u2014 he dedicated a 13-minute spoken-word outro to the struggle on his debut album \u2014 and the world would be worse off if he\u2019d listened. On Jesus Is King, you begin to see where they may have been coming from.\n\nLately, West is not as dedicated to stirring up controversy on record as he is speaking off the cuff. While Jesus Is King certainly has moments echoing some of his less endearing public turns \u2014 briefly referencing the 13th Amendment, retrograde riffing on women staying off Instagram, claims that merch sales count as tithing \u2014 it\u2019s typically getting more tough to grasp what, exactly, he\u2019s trying to say. While critics always focused \u2014 unfairly \u2014 on West\u2019s technical prowess, a forceful clarity of vision was never in question. Here, he often cedes a point of view, or any sort of detail. God saves, and that\u2019s all you need to know of the matter.\n\nNowhere is the view muddier than on \u201cClosed On Sundays,\u201d featuring a newfound, poorly articulated dedication to women\u2019s purity in the social media age. Ostensibly a love song directed at Kim Kardashian West, he solemnly intones \u201cHold the selfies, put the \u2018Gram away / Get your family, y\u2019all hold hands and pray.\u201d It doesn\u2019t work (and makes less sense when he elaborates). But in typical Westian fashion, the song dramatically shifts, and very nearly redeems itself. Singing with admirable vulnerability, he invokes some reliable Old Testament imagery \u2014 Jesus Is King is filled with demons quaking before an almighty power \u2014 an earnest attempt to get his point across that ultimately characterizes this project.", "description": "On his ninth album, West turns to religion as his muse.
