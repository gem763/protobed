Trump argues the deal, completed under the Obama administration, fell far short of the curbs needed to block Tehran's regional ambitions.\n\nAddressing world leaders Wednesday, President Hassan Rouhani pointed a clear way toward easing tensions and resuming negotiations: \"Stop the sanctions.\"\n\nBut before getting to that, he opened his speech by paying homage \"to all the freedom-seekers of the world who do not bow to oppression and aggression.\" He also slammed \"U.S.- and Zionist-imposed plans\" against the Palestinians. Such language characterizes Iran's self-styled championing of Islamic causes worldwide.\n\nAway from the podium this week, Iran has been engaging in nothing short of a public relations blitz with America's biggest news outlets. Rouhani met with leaders of media organizations including The Associated Press and gave an interview to Fox News, where Trump and his Iran policies enjoy vehement support.\n\nThe Tehran government's fraught history with the U.S. has essentially locked it out of the global financial system, making it difficult to find partners, allies and countries willing or even able to do business with it.\n\nRouhani accused the U.S. of engaging in \"merciless economic terrorism\" against his country, saying America had resorted to \"international piracy by misusing the international banking system\" to pressure Iran.\n\nAs Iran's nuclear deal with world powers unravels under the weight of Trump's \"maximum pressure\" campaign, previously unimaginable alliances are emerging between Gulf Arab states and Israel, united by what they see as a common threat.\n\nAcross the Middle East, Iran's reach is consequential in Syria, Iraq and Yemen, where proxy wars have taken on a sectarian tone that pits Iran-supported Shiites against Saudi-backed Sunnis.\n\nOn the battlefields, Tehran's rivals see it as a menacing and destabilizing force that has exploited failed uprisings, military interventions and chaos to expand its foothold in Arab states.\n\nIran counters that it was the U.S. that invaded Iraq and Saudi Arabia that invaded Yemen. In his U.N. speech, Rouhani pointed to Iran's role in fighting Sunni Muslim extremist groups like the Islamic State and al-Qaida. He described Iran as a \"pioneer of freedom-seeking movements in the region.\"\n\nIran's elite paramilitary force has led that charge, cementing Tehran's footprint far beyond the country's borders.\n\nThe Revolutionary Guard Corps, created after Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution in parallel to the country's armed forces, is effectively a corps of soldiers charged with preserving and advancing the principles of the uprising that created modern Iran.\n\nIt answers only to the country's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and its power is not just theoretical but very real: The force directly oversees the country's ballistic missile program.\n\nIt is the Guard Corps that has become a major sticking point in Iran's relations, or lack thereof, with the United States under Trump.\n\nThe Trump administration, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Israel say Iran used money from sanctions relief under the nuclear accord to increase the Revolutionary Guard's budget.\n\nThose nations say any new negotiations must include discussion about the Guard's activities in the region and its missile program, and support for that notion seems to be gaining traction.\n\nThis week, Britain, France and Germany joined the U.S. and other allies in blaming Iran for an attack on Saudi oil sites earlier this month. The implication: That because missiles were involved in those attacks, so was the Guard.", "description": "Iran has long prided itself on its forceful defiance of the United States and Israel, a resistance that has defined the Shiite-led Islamic Republic for the 40 years since its revolution.
