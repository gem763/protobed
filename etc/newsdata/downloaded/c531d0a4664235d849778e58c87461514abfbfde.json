Bystanders and others who had little to do with the protests were reportedly detained along with the demonstrators, and those arrested were being held across the country.\n\nSeveral prominent opposition figures have been detained, despite no indication that any were involved with the new wave of dissent.\n\nThe award-winning human rights lawyer Mahienour el-Massry was seized outside a Cairo courthouse where she was defending protesters. Days later, journalist and opposition politician Khaled Dawoud was arrested, as well as the political scientist Hassan Nafea and Hazem Hosny, a former spokesperson for the former military chief of staff Sami Anan, who remains in detention after attempting to run for president last year.\n\nExiled former contractor Mohamed Ali, whose videos alleging rampant corruption within the Egyptian military sparked the recent protests, has called for a million people to march on Friday. It was unclear on Thursday whether the use of teargas, rubber bullets, beatings and live ammunition against those who took to the streets last weekend has discouraged would-be protesters from heeding that call.\n\nTahrir Square resembled a fortress on Thursday. Blue-and-white Egyptian police vans equipped with GPS-tracking technology sat at the entrance to nearby bridges. Across central Cairo, police stopped and searched pedestrians, sometimes seizing their phones to search for political content. People living in the surrounding neighbourhoods worried about raids on their homes.\n\nDespite the risks, some were determined to protest. \u201cI will go down and participate, because it can not get worse than the current situation. We are not worth anything in this country,\u201d said Fatma, a teacher from the Egyptian coastal city of Alexandria.\n\nAn information battle raged online and on the airwaves. The Egyptian authorities struggled to maintain the image of business as usual, while pro-government outlets derided videos of the protests as fake.\n\nMeanwhile the web-monitoring organisation NetBlocks reported that Egypt\u2019s internet was experiencing increasing restrictions, including disruption to Twitter, Facebook messenger and Skype. Egypt\u2019s media regulator said the BBC was \u201clikely blocked,\u201d due to its \u201cinaccurate coverage\u201d, of the protests.\n\nSisi has repeatedly made it clear that he won\u2019t tolerate any dissent. Ahmed Mohy, a lone protester who publicly held a sign in Tahrir Square demanding that Sisi step down, was arrested in March and is yet to be released. Twenty-one people were arrested last May and later imprisoned on terrorism charges for protesting against a fare rise on the Cairo metro. There are an estimated 60,000 political prisoners in Egypt.\n\nTimeline After Tahrir Square Show Hide Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak steps down after almost 30 years in power amid anti-government Arab spring protests. Rallies continue all year. Islamist parties win drawn-out parliamentary elections. Mohamed Morsi of Muslim Brotherhood wins presidential election. Mubarak sentenced to life in prison for complicity in killing 800 protesters in 2011. Army overthrows Morsi. Security forces kill hundreds in pro-Morsi camp. Former army chief Abdel Fatah al-Sisi wins presidential election. Morsi sentenced to death. Egypt's appeal court orders retrial in 2016. Isis claims responsibility for bombing Russian plane in Sinai. Crew and 224 tourists killed. IMF approves three-year $12bn loan to Egypt designed to help country out of economic crisis. Suicide bombers kill dozens at two churches as worshippers celebrate Palm Sunday. Egyptian airstrikes on northern Sinai after militants assault on a mosque kills 305 people. Sisi announces he will run for a second term.\n\nThe Egyptian leader blamed \u201cpolitical Islam\u201d, for the protests during a trip to the UN general assembly this week, a reference to the banned Muslim Brotherhood group.\n\nThe British prime minister, Boris Johnson, praised Sisi during a bilateral meeting in New York, mentioning only \u201cpositive progress in our bilateral relationship\u201d, and ignoring the crackdown back home. The US president, Donald Trump, who has called Sisi his \u201cfavourite dictator\u201d, dismissed the protests in Egypt. \u201cEverybody has demonstrations,\u201d he said.\n\nEgyptians\u2019 living conditions have progressively worsened while the risks of speaking out have grown. An estimated 32.5 million people live below the poverty line according to the government\u2019s own figures published in July. Citizens have weathered years of harsh austerity measures including deep subsidy cuts and price increases for basic goods.\n\nYet despite widespread discontent, many were troubled by fears that renewed protests could bring unrest and further destabilise the economy, or create a fresh wave of repression that threatens to ensnare even more of the population.\n\n\u201cI never went to a protest, and I will never go. There is a lot of wrong things in the country, some people are literally eating from the garbage. But protesting and riots will make things worse,\u201d said Sayed, a 34-year-old fast-food worker in Cairo. \u201cGod knows I agree with what they say, but I\u2019m alone and I have no one to defend me. So I can only focus on putting bread on the table,\u201d he added.\n\nOthers felt that participating might be their only remaining option. \u201cI will watch what is going to take place in the streets, as I don\u2019t want to be just a number,\u201d said Fatma. \u201cI want to make a difference. I want to do something good in order for my kids to have a better life.\u201d", "description": "Over 1,900 arrested as Egypt braces for more demonstrations planned for Friday against rule of Abdel Fatah al-Sisi", "authors": ["Ruth Michaelson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b6701cefe9cc4f002c68d5b8a5e20fc3b92c4cc/0_121_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8a8951d96ea91ca6869711aa052f83fe", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
