When Jesse drove out of his captors\u2019 compound during the series finale, he screamed with relief and joy, an image that implied a happy ending. It\u2019s an image that El Camino promptly rejects: In the immediate aftermath of his exit, Jesse, as the only survivor of Walt\u2019s massacre, has merely waded into more danger. Wanted by the authorities and plagued by PTSD, Jesse attempts to dispose of the titular vehicle he\u2019d used to escape and, after a brief meet-up with his old cronies Badger (Matthew Lee Jones) and Skinny Pete (Charles Baker), concocts a plan to leave Albuquerque for good. That plan leads him into a nesting doll of precarious situations\u2014one problem begets another, and as he deals with every new threat, Jesse begins to question whether he deserves a second chance at all.\n\nThis is bleak emotional territory for a character who once served as the series\u2019 moral center and comic relief. Thankfully, the film is interested in observing Jesse\u2019s journey as a whole, splicing his new circumstances as a fugitive with extensive flashbacks. These peeks into Jesse\u2019s past inform his present-day decisions\u2014and give Breaking Bad fans a chance to catch up with a litany of familiar faces. (One particularly sinister figure I\u2019d hoped never to see again resurfaces to surprisingly hilarious effect\u2014hilarious in the grisly-gallows-humor sense.) To that end, El Camino feels episodic, with each character taking Jesse on a short-story-like detour before leading him onto the next step of his journey. These chapters deliver the signature Breaking Bad tension, slow burning before the twist is revealed, the stakes are established, and the (often bloody) pieces fall into place.\n\nAaron Paul is phenomenal, deftly toggling between Jesse\u2019s youthful playfulness and his older, emotionally shattered world-weariness from scene to scene. (It also helps that Paul, with minimal makeup and clever costuming, looks like he\u2019s barely aged since Breaking Bad went off-air.) The film, for all its guest stars, relies on Paul to carry it\u2014and the actor proves himself more than up to the challenge. He vibrates with intensity, a frayed nerve conveying Jesse\u2019s trauma in practically every scene. Credit, too, to Gilligan, who settles back into his filmmaking rhythm (he directed the series\u2019 finale and pilot, along with three other essential episodes) and recaptures the Breaking Bad look: Sun-baked frames of New Mexico. Tight zooms straight into the barrel of a gun. Topsy-turvy point-of-view shots emphasizing Jesse\u2019s new world without overwhelming the story\u2019s precise plotting.\n\nAs unexpected and unnecessary as it may have been for Gilligan and company to sequelize Breaking Bad, El Camino does help scratch a narrative itch. As Paul told Vulture, the question of whether Jesse truly ended up okay has penetrated every discussion of Breaking Bad he had over the years; sooner or later, someone had to answer the question. But the film isn\u2019t really about giving Jesse a happy ending. It\u2019s about examining whether or not he can create one for himself.", "description": "El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie gives him a ruminative and riveting send-off.", "authors": ["Shirley Li"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/GB_00371r-4/facebook.jpg?1570745431", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
