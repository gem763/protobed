Rand Paul at his Kentucky home in 2017.\n\n\u201cI DO NOT promote violence but,\u201d Ms. Midler wrote, \u201cRand Paul says the Kurds are being \u2018ingrates\u2019 for taking their frustrations out on US troops. Which is a good reminder for us all to be more grateful for the neighbor who beat the [expletive] out of Rand Paul.\u201d\n\nCritics accused Ms. Midler of making light of the assault that almost killed the Republican senator. Mr. Paul was mowing his lawn while wearing noise-cancelling headphones when his neighbor, Rene Boucher, blindsided him in an attack that left him with five broken ribs. Mr. Paul suffered complications during his recovery from the attack, including battling pneumonia, and part of his lung had to be removed in August.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time Ms. Midler has joked about the attack. In February of last year she tweeted, \u201cWhere\u2019s Rand Paul\u2019s neighbor when we need him?\u201d\n\nBoth tweets remain active on the singer\u2019s account.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
