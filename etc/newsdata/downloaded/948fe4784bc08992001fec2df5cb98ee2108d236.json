But in most states they cannot be employed as police officers. Now dozens of police chiefs and sheriffs, alarmed at the shrinking numbers of qualified recruits, want to see the long-standing prohibition lifted.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think someone\u2019s citizenship is indicative in any way of someone\u2019s suitability to be a police officer,\u201d said Tom Manger, police chief in Montgomery County, Maryland, a suburb of Washington D.C. He co-chairs a national task force of policing executives lobbying legislatures to change the law in Maryland and elsewhere.\n\nThe movement is part of a broader recognition that the difficulty in recruiting police is not just a result of low pay and battered morale\u2014the so-called Ferguson Effect\u2014but of numerous obstacles thrown up by politicians or police themselves.\n\nJurisdiction by jurisdiction, those barriers are being challenged, often successfully.\n\nA growing number of law enforcement agencies will now accept applicants who admit past drug use or have arrest records for low-level offenses, who lack college degrees and who sport tattoos or facial hair.\n\nBut frustrated cops say they are still being handcuffed by arcane state laws and slow-to-respond state oversight commissions.\n\nIn Massachusetts, officers and police applicants are disqualified if they smoke cigarettes, even off-duty.\n\nMatthew Starr, an army veteran who had been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, was rejected by the police department in Medfield, Massachusetts, near Boston, after a police officer secretly photographed Starr getting out of his pickup to smoke. Starr appealed to the state\u2019s Civil Service Commission and lost.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to claim there is a shortage when you aren\u2019t going to hire someone who smokes,\u201d said Starr, who is now a 7th grade public school teacher. Being a cop \u201cis a tough job, there\u2019s no money, there is no respect in it, and these asinine laws don\u2019t help either.\u201d\n\nMassachusetts is also one of several states where women are challenging physical requirements that impede the hiring and retention of female officers. Critics argue the rules have little to do with the demands of policing.\n\nThe state requires women to traverse the same arduous obstacle course as men. The fail rate for women was 20 percent compared to a rate of 2 percent for men, according to a data analysis by news station WCVB. The Massachusetts Human Resources Division settled a lawsuit in 2015 with a promise to revise the test, but the reforms have yet to be announced. All five branches of the U.S. military, meanwhile, offer varied fitness standards for basic training based on gender. Beginning in late 2020, the Army will switch to a physical testing system for already enlisted soldiers based on the strain of their assignments rather than gender and age.\n\nMatthew Starr, a veteran of the U.S. Army, was rejected by the police department in Medfield, Massachusetts after he was photographed smoking.\n\n(Photo: Tony Luong for The Marshall Project)\n\nPolicing experts point out that law enforcement is historically slow to adapt to shifts in the cultural norms. Long after contact lenses were commonplace, police forces demanded 20/20 vision. Until the 1980s it was common for law enforcement agencies to shun gay cops on grounds that there would be \u201cmorale problems.\u201d\n\nMany police departments still ask applicants intrusive questions about their personal lives. A Marshall Project review of background check questionnaires found queries about \u201cunusual\u201d sexual acts (Cincinnati Police Department), attendance at cock or dog fights (Albuquerque Police Department) and whether an applicant has \u201cgiven anything to anyone that was not yours to give away\u201d. (Richmond Police Department in Virginia).\n\nNo issue is as fraught as the ban on applicants lacking full citizenship, at a time when President Trump has framed immigration as one of the country\u2019s most polarizing debates.\n\nAccording to a 2016 report by the U.S. Justice Department, more than 40 states have statutes, regulations, or administrative rules in place that restrict the ability of law enforcement agencies to employ non-citizens. The report, a survey of diversity in policing, notes that \u201cthis requirement may prevent a considerable number of racial and ethnic minorities\u2014many of whom have valuable foreign language skills\u2014from being hired by law enforcement agencies.\u201d\n\nMore: Chicago's policing problem is systemic. Truth and reconciliation are needed.\n\nMore: More cops. Is it the answer to fighting crime?\n\nMore: Black female senator: My arrest shows the bias that still exists in justice system\n\nJustin Levitt, a Justice Department official in the Obama administration, supervised discrimination cases against police departments that banned legal immigrants in the few states that allowed them to be hired as cops. Levitt questioned why legislatures continue to prevent police chiefs from employing who they want. \u201cThese laws tell local law enforcement that you have to hire someone less qualified based on the fact that they were born here,\u201d Levitt said.\n\nManger\u2019s group, called the Law Enforcement Immigration Task force, issued a white paper in 2017 urging that the citizenship requirement be lifted. Manger said the change might begin with legal immigrants who have been honorably discharged from the military.\n\n\u201cIf you criticize these individuals, then you are criticizing someone who has military service,\u201d Manger said. A bill to make green-card holders with military service eligible for policing died in the Maryland Senate last year, but its sponsor plans to reintroduce it.\n\nTennessee in 2015 amended its laws to open police recruitment to non-citizens with military service, after the police chief in Nashville rallied legislators. \"Having a cross-section of Nashville serving on the police department enhances our knowledge and appreciation of cultures so we can better serve our population,\u201d said then Nashville Police Chief Steve Anderson after the law was changed.\n\nNot all jurisdictions in the state are following the reform. The Memphis Police Department still requires its applicants to be citizens. When the failure to comply with state law was brought to the city\u2019s attention, spokeswoman Ursula Madden said Memphis officials were \u201cin the process of updating the language.\u201d\n\nMontgomery County, Maryland, Police Chief Tom Manger has lobbied for the state to allow military veterans who are not citizens to be hired as police officers.\n\n(Photo: Gabriella Demczuk for The Marshall Project)\n\nHouston Police Chief Art Acevedo wants a broader change, and says he is talking with a bipartisan group of state legislators to craft a bill that would allow law enforcement agencies to hire legal non-citizens who qualify, with or without a military background. \u201cThey came here legally like we asked them to do, and they have the heart, let\u2019s remove that artificial wall, and let\u2019s build a bridge to service. That\u2019s what we should be doing,\u201d said Acevedo who co-chairs the immigration task force along with Manger.\n\nOpponents of allowing permanent residents to join police ranks say they don\u2019t want to empower green-card holders to detain U.S. citizens. They also question whether an immigrant, who didn\u2019t go through the naturalization process, could fairly practice constitutional policing. \u201cIf you want to become a cop, become a citizen,\u201d said former Illinois U.S. Rep. Joe Walsh who is now a nationally syndicated conservative radio host.\n\nIn 2015, Walsh\u2019s listeners flooded a village council meeting in suburban Chicago and loudly protested a proposal for the Mount Prospect Police Department to hire non-citizens. Due to the backlash, Mount Prospect officials dropped the idea. The police chief described the critics as a \u201clynch mob.\u201d\n\nThe right of states to restrict police recruiting based on citizenship rests on a 1978 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that upheld the New York State Police\u2019s refusal to accept the application of a legal permanent resident named Edmund Foley. \u201cPolice officials are clothed with authority to exercise an almost infinite variety of discretionary powers,\u201d the court ruled. \u201cA state may therefore confine the performance of this important public responsibility to those who are citizens.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, the Obama administration fined the Denver sheriff's department $10,000 for incorrectly advertising that citizenship was a requirement for a deputy position. Colorado is one of a handful of states that allow non-citizens to apply for local law enforcement jobs. As part of the settlement, Denver agreed to track down green card holders who had been passed over for a job and reconsider them for employment.\n\nOne beneficiary of the new policy was Omar Barrios, a legal immigrant from Mexico but not yet a citizen. Now a deputy, he works at Denver\u2019s downtown detention center. \u201cNobody ever asks me if I am a resident or a citizen,\u201d he says. \u201cI do my job like anyone else.\u201d", "description": "Law enforcement agencies have updated their standards to recruit more cop prospects, but many are frustrated by arcane state laws that block hires.", "authors": ["Simone Weichselbaum", "The Marshall Project"], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/02/15/USAT/49f1017c-ee05-45ed-942c-245b3cc42d67-Stumpf_HIRING_Omar_Barrios.jpg?crop=5759,3231,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "published_at": "2019-02-15"}
