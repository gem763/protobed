In fact, over the past 10 years the UK supplements industry has grown by more than 30%.\n\nOne supplement in particular has played a significant role in this growth: turmeric.\n\nThanks to the growing popularity of this Indian spice, more turmeric-based supplements are available than ever before. But with so many options on the market, what do you need to look for?\n\nFirst, it's important to note that you'd have to consume a lot of the powdered turmeric sold in a supermarket spice rack to reach the same levels of curcumin as that found in a turmeric supplement.\n\nMore and more people across the UK are trying different kinds of nutritional supplements\n\nThat's because curcumin, the primary active ingredient derived from turmeric, accounts for 3% of standard turmeric powder and it is not easily absorbed by the body. When you eat powdered turmeric, a great deal of it simply passes through your system.\n\nPopular supplements may include high levels of curcumin, but while claims of high curcumin levels might grab consumers' attention they might want to pay more careful attention to ease of absorption ('bioavailability') and whether a product is formulated with micronutrients that carry approved health claims from a trusted source.\n\nThis focus on absorption has coincided with a growth in the availability of black pepper formulations. Adding black pepper is perhaps the most popular technique used to increase curcumin absorption.\n\nIt is thought that piperine, the key component in black pepper, improves absorption of curcumin by inhibiting the natural processes preventing pharmacological compounds from accumulating in the body. It does this in a few ways such as inhibiting cellular efflux mechanisms, which essentially means that once curcumin is absorbed by cells it is less likely to be secreted. Secondly, it can inhibit glucuronidation, a process that makes substances more water soluble so they can be easily eliminated from the body.\n\nAnother means of increasing curcumin absorption from turmeric has been developed by the team at health supplement company FutureYou Cambridge.\n\nTurmeric+ contains a unique formulation of vitamin C, lecithin and curcumin which improves absorption of the active ingredient in turmeric by 3,000%\n\nTurmeric+ contains a patented formulation of curcuminoids, vitamin C and lecithin. This formulation is more easily absorbed by the body. Studies have shown that the formulation is 30 times more absorbable than standard turmeric consumed with food. It has also been the subject of more scientific studies than any other bioavailable curcumin supplement. Last year Turmeric+ was also officially certified by Informed-Sport, an independent quality assurance programme for both sports nutrition products and supplements.\n\nThe vitamin C within the Turmeric+ formulation contributes to normal collagen formation for the normal function of cartilage. The company's unique combination of vitamin C, lecithin, and curcumin also improves absorption of the active ingredient in turmeric by 3,000%.\n\nMiriam Ferrer PhD, Head of Product Development at FutureYou Cambridge, explains: 'One of the most popular turmeric supplement ingredients is black pepper. However, we use another approach called 'phytosome technology'. It is the delivery mechanism that makes Turmeric+ special.'\n\nFutureYou Cambridge recommend one or two tablets per day of their product as it mimics the average consumption of curcumin in India.\n\nAdam Cleevely, CEO of FutureYou Cambridge, says: 'The supplements industry has grown at a rapid rate here in the UK and there's an increasing variety of supplements to choose from. If you walk into a leading health shop you'll find an overwhelming number of turmeric-based products. Some are simply the plain spice you'd have in your spice rack, but in capsules. Others you might find are developed by scientists, which are carefully formulated with micronutrients and with the absorption of the product in mind.'\n\nAdam Cleevely, CEO of FutureYou Cambridge, says: 'The supplements industry has grown at a rapid rate here in the UK'\n\nThere is some good news for those overwhelmed by the turmeric choices available. FutureYou Cambridge are giving away packs of their flagship product, Turmeric+, to new customers.\n\nThe company are offering customers their first month's supply of Turmeric+ for free when they sign up for a flexible \u00a315 a month subscription. Customers are simply required to pay a \u00a31.50 postage fee.\n\n'We recognise it's a challenge for customers to navigate the options and for that reason we decided to launch this scheme. We're very happy to give people their first month's pack for free so they can experience it for themselves.' Cleevely says.\n\nIf customers choose not to continue with monthly deliveries they can cancel the arrangement at any time, without obligation.\n\nAnne said, 'I love Turmeric+ and have told many of my friends about it'\n\n'It might sound bonkers but it really isn't. We're that confident in our Turmeric+ formulation. If people like it, they will stick with it and continue with monthly deliveries. Tens of thousands of customers already do.'\n\nThis was certainly the case for dressage and fitness enthusiast Anne Evans.\n\nAnne, aged 57 from Cirencester, has been riding horses for 20 years as well as having a keen interest in gardening, the gym and pilates.\n\n'I consider myself to be fit and active, however age does eventually creep up on you and you notice these little niggles occur on a more frequent basis.' said Anne. 'Those little niggles can have an impact on the amount of fun you have, I was determined that was not going to happen to me.'\n\nIt was over a year ago that Anne's search for a turmeric supplement got underway and that led her to Turmeric+. Anne commented, 'After much research with the help of my husband, a biochemist who has a very good understanding of how the body functions, I decided that Turmeric+ was something I should try.'\n\n'It was the research at the Olympic Research Centre in Barcelona that really caught my eye. Knowing it was used by international footballers and elite athletes made me think it must be able to do something for me.'\n\nAnne said, 'I love the product and have told many of my friends about it. When you discover something this good, you need to share the news. This fits my mantra of being fit for your life.'", "description": "Thanks to the growing popularity of this Indian spice, more turmeric-based supplements are available than ever before.
