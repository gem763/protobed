It is a form of shamelessness worn as a badge of protection \u2014 on the implicit theory that the president\u2019s alleged offenses can\u2019t be that serious if he commits them in full public view.\n\nLess than a year after Trump\u2019s public encouragement of Russia to meddle in the 2016 presidential election, special counsel Robert S. Mueller III and a host of congressional committees would devote months to investigating that very question \u2014 whether the president or his campaign had conspired with Russia and, later, whether Trump had tried to obstruct justice.\n\nYet Trump\u2019s penchant for reading the stage directions almost seems to inoculate him from the kind of political damage that would devastate other politicians.\n\nIn the current controversy, The Washington Post first reported Wednesday that a whistleblower complaint that has spurred a showdown between the intelligence community and Congress involved a \u201cpromise\u201d made by Trump to a foreign leader, now believed to be Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. In response on Thursday, Trump tweeted a two-part defense in which he claimed that because he knows calls with foreign leaders are closely monitored, no one should be \u201cdumb enough to believe that I would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially \u2018heavily populated\u2019 call.\u201d\n\nNick Akerman, a former Watergate prosecutor, said Trump manages to \u201cworm out of things\u201d by making his bad behavior so blatant.\n\n\u201cI think the normal reaction for a lot of people is that something that someone does in public, it takes away the idea that it\u2019s nefarious,\u201d Akerman said. \u201cThey think, \u2018Would he really be doing it in public if there was something wrong with it?\u2019 \u201d\n\nBut Akerman added that when Trump takes actions such as asking Russia to hack Clinton\u2019s emails or publicly pressuring Paul Manafort, his former campaign chairman, not to cooperate with prosecutors, his intent is the same \u2014 whether he acts publicly or behind closed doors.\n\n\u201cWhat he\u2019s been saying in public is the kind of thing I used to prosecute people for doing in private,\u201d Akerman said.\n\nBarbara McQuade, a former U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, said Trump\u2019s confounding public behavior \u2014 for example, she said, \u201che says stuff in tweets that seems blatantly illegal\u201d \u2014 allows for two competing theories.\n\n\u201cAre we giving him too much credit and he\u2019s just so undisciplined that he can\u2019t help but say and tweet these things?\u201d she asked. \u201cOr is he so diabolical that putting it out there is like a jujitsu move?\u201d\n\nThe president has a long history of broadcasting his questionable actions and intentions to the general public. In May 2017, just two days after he fired FBI Director James B. Comey, Trump gave an interview with NBC News\u2019s Lester Holt in which he linked Comey\u2019s dismissal to the ongoing Russia investigation.\n\n\u201cAnd in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself \u2014 I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story,\u201d the president said.\n\nHe also spent a signification portion of his presidency publicly hectoring Jeff Sessions, his former attorney general, to undo his recusal from the Russia investigation \u2014 a move that would have made it easier for Sessions to take control of the investigation and protect Trump.\n\nAnd in June \u2014 three months after Mueller submitted his 448-page report \u2014 Trump struck an unapologetic note, saying that the despite the nearly two-year investigation of Russian interference that clouded his presidency, he might still accept damaging information from a foreign adversary, such as Russia or China.\n\n\u201cI think you might want to listen. There\u2019s nothing wrong with listening,\u201d Trump told ABC News\u2019s George Stephanopoulos. \u201cIf somebody called from a country, Norway \u2014 \u2018We have information on your opponent\u2019 \u2014 oh, I think I\u2019d want to hear it.\u201d\n\nBrendan Nyhan, a professor of government at Dartmouth College, said Trump\u2019s sheer brazenness makes him a difficult target for his critics and puts him outside the scope of previous leaders brought low by high crimes and misdemeanors.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a striking contrast between Watergate, where secret tapes helped bring about the downfall of a president, and the Trump White House, where many of the statements that violate the norms of the presidency are made right out in public,\u201d Nyhan said. \u201cHis opponents are routinely uncertain how to proceed, because they\u2019ve never encountered a political opponent who so directly states what they mean even when it\u2019s politically scandalous.\u201d\n\nIn evaluating whether Trump\u2019s actions constituted obstruction of justice, Mueller noted that \u201cmany of the President\u2019s acts directed at witnesses, including discouragement of cooperation with the government and suggestions of possible future pardons, took place in public view.\u201d\n\nIn his report, Mueller dubbed that reality \u201cunusual.\u201d Mueller ultimately decided to make no determination as to whether the president broke the law.\n\nNow the president\u2019s relationship with a foreign country is in the spotlight again, this time Ukraine. Even before the whistleblower complaint, House Democrats were investigating a July 25 call with Zelensky as part of their inquiry of whether Trump and his attorney, Rudolph W. Giuliani, tried to ma\u00adnipu\u00adla\u00adte the Ukrainian government into helping his 2020 reelection bid.\n\nGiuliani has long been trying to draw attention to Biden\u2019s involvement, as vice president, in pressuring Ukraine to drop its top prosecutor, who was viewed as ineffective at ferreting out corruption but was also, at the time, investigating a natural-gas company on whose board Biden\u2019s son Hunter sat.\n\nIn a combative and disjointed interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo on Thursday evening, Giuliani contradicted himself in rapid succession, first saying he had never asked Ukraine to investigate Biden, before shouting that he had, in fact, pushed for such an investigation.\n\n\u201cOf course I did!\u201d Giuliani said.\n\nOn Friday, Clinton tweeted out a clip of the interview, offering a stark rejoinder of her own.\n\n\u201cThe president asked a foreign power to help him win an election,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAgain.\u201d\n\nRosalind S.
