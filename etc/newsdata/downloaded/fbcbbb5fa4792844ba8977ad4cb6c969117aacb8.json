The president calling it a coup and secretary of state Pompeo clashes with leaders and the state department inspector general is set to turn over new documents. Cecilia Vega tracking all the latest. Good morning, Cecilia. Reporter: Good morning to you. House Democrats and the secretary of state are both accusing each other of intimidation, but it seems for now anyway at least some of the people that Mike Pompeo does not want to pose on capitol hill are defying him. A showdown on capitol hill. House Democrats demanding to depose five current and former state department officials who are witnesses in their investigation but the secretary of state Mike Pompeo rebuffed the request at least for now calling the demand, quote, an attempt to intimidate, bully and treat improperly the distinguished professionals of the department of state. Democrats livid. Secretary Pompeo is just stonewalling and delaying and we aren't going to put up with those tactics. Reporter: The democratic chairs of the house foreign affairs oversight and intelligence committees sending a scathing response accusing Pompeo of a blatant cover-up and a clear abuse of power. President trump escalating his own attacks on the Democrats' impeachment inquiry calling it an attempted cow on his presidency and tweeted as I learn more and more each day, I am coming to the count inclusion that what is taking place is not an impeachment, it is a coup intended to take away the power of the people and blasting the whistle-blower saying he's not only entitled to now the identity, he now also wants to interview the person. The president tweeting, why aren't we entitled to interview and learn everything about the whistle-blower and also the person who gave all of the false information to him. But the president's own inspector general is calling the whistle-blower's complaint credible and now top senate Republican Iowa's chuck grassley issuing this public rebuke saying this person appears to have followed the whistle-blower protection laws and ought to be heard out and protected. Uninformed speculation is counterproductive and doesn't serve the country. And now this morning, of course, after Pompeo was found, that revelation was found to be among those listening in on the call between the president and president of Ukraine the inspector general is headed to cap for what he is calling an urgent briefing in a secure facility. The topic, the state department's documents related to Ukraine. So he's turning those over two of the witnesses that the house wanted to see from the state department are actually going to appear before these committees. Reporter: Yeah, and it's going to happen pretty soon, George. The former U.S. Special envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker resigned. He's agreed to give a deposition tomorrow and then the former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine who was pushed out earlier this year, she will meet with congress next week, George. Okay, Cecilia Vega, thanks very much.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "description": "The president called the impeachment inquiry a", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/191002_gma_vega2_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
