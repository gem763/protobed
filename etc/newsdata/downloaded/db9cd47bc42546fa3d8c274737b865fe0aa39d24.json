Debris from the explosion flew through the air, reportedly hitting the victim and severely wounding her.\n\n(Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nIt's not clear what exactly exploded and further information has not been released about the incident.\n\nOfficials did not release further information about the incident. However, gender-reveal parties often make headlines for their disastrous outcomes.\n\nIn 2018, another gender reveal party went horribly wrong when a Tucson, Arizona, man shot at a target, which was supposed to release either a pink or blue cloud to indicate the baby's gender.\n\nInstead, the target - which contained the highly explosive substance tannerite - burst into flames, spreading quickly through the field of dry brush that surrounded it.\n\nThe incident was later determined to be the cause of the Sawmill Fire, which burned nearly 47,000 acres and caused more than $8 million (\u00a36.2m) in damage.", "description": "The woman had been at a party in Knoxville, Iowa when authorities were called to reports a woman had been seriously injured", "authors": ["Tom Davidson", "Image", "Getty Images Istockphoto"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20739310.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Its-a-girl.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
