So, if you\u2019re in the booing mode, blow Nike\u2019s way, swoosh, because the NFL minions of marketing are turning their attention to another god of culture.\n\nJay-Z springs into action on opening night, this Thursday, when one of the OGs of NFL rivalries, the Green Bay Packers, take on the Bears in Chicago. With Aaron Rodgers at the helm, I\u2019m anticipating a schoolyard fight, like the Sunday night game in Week 1 of 2018, when Rodgers and his ailing knee passed for 286 years and three touchdowns to rally against da Bears, 24-23.\n\nThe 100th celebration starts in Chicago\u2019s front yard, Grant Park, where musical superstars Meghan Trainor and Meek Mill will headline a free concert.\n\nI can\u2019t claim familiarity with their music, and I\u2019m certain many NFL owners can\u2019t either. But the owners, collectively and individually love money (and winning) and it\u2019s their marketeers\u2019 job to bring in more and more of it every season without wringing the wallets of their season ticket holders.\n\nAnd speaking of money, team holdouts and holdups remain the hottest of topics as the season opens this week.\n\nOn the Washington Redskins\u2019 front, as the first example, offensive tackle Trent Williams is still a holdout. Injury prone, the 320-pound playmaker claims the medical team hasn\u2019t properly tended to him. So neither he nor the Redskins\u2019 brass has signed on a dotted line.\n\nThe \u2018Skins oldest rivals are facing a bit of the same. Ezekiel Elliott of the Dallas Cowboys is the type of running back who makes this diehard Washington fan jump from my seat every time he\u2019s handed the pigskin. He\u2019s a threat, whether he launches into an open-field carry or he has to twist into the Heisman Trophy keep-away pose. He\u2019s no \u201cDiesel\u201d and no \u201cBus,\u201d but Cowboys owner Jerry Jones knows he\u2019s damn good \u2014 and Mr. Jones is the type of OG who rewards victories and loyalty.\n\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s Team\u201d and the \u2018Skins don\u2019t go head-to-head until Week 2 in Dallas. First, we have to get past another NFC East rival, Philly\u2019s Eagles. The teams do not like either, period. The teams\u2019 fans do not like each other, either. Rabid fans unleash profanities, pushes and shoves in the stands as if they were born enemies. Most of the time, however, no harm and no foul.\n\nHere\u2019s to preparing for the 100th birthday of the NFL, which has seen everything from changes and reforms for drafting and hiring players to uniforms, to expansion and serious health issue like concussions and other head and body injuries, to politics and Super Bowl \u201cwardrobe\u201d malfunctions.\n\nAll of that leaves owners wondering how they keep butts in the seats and turn eyeballs toward the tube.\n\nThey\u2019re pinning their hopes that the money keeps coming. They hope to see into their future beginning this week with their 100th anniversary.\n\nEntertainment and American football are a natural marriage.\n\nBut money made on and off the field determine how well they play together.\n\n\u2022 Deborah Simmons can be contacted at [email protected]\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
