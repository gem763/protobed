The company had argued that the increase in the price of electricity would help it lower its growing debt burden.\n\n\"Following analysis of the reasons for decision, the Eskom Board decided on taking the matter to court,\" said Calib Cassim, Eskom\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, in a statement on Friday.\n\nHe said the company had \"put in an application for urgent interim relief, which is necessary to avoid financial disaster for Eskom\".\n\n\"We are seeking an order to address this shortfall in a phased manner. In addition, we are seeking the court to review and set aside Nersa\u2019s MYPD4 revenue decision and remit that decision to Nersa for reconsideration in the light of the Court\u2019s judgment,\" Cassim said.\n\nEskom's request for increases was opposed by business, labour and civil society in written and oral submissions to the regulator.\n\nBailouts\n\nThe state-owned power utility received a lifeline in the February Budget speech of R23bn every year for the next three years from National Treasury. A separate special appropriations bill is also currently being considered by Parliament, to grant the utility R59bn in funds over two years.\n\nIn July, Eskom reported a net loss after tax of R20.7bn for the 2019 financial year. While its total debt stands at about R440bn, it is also facing a growing burden of non-payment from some municipalities.\n\nIt is not the first time that Eskom has challenged Nersa in court over tariffs. Earlier this year, Eskom launched a court bid to have tariff increases reviewed, Bloomberg reported.", "description": "The cash-strapped power utility is going to court to challenge Nersa's decision to grant it a lower tariff increase than it applied for.", "authors": ["- Sibongile Khumalo"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2836/e5aad59e28104775b3422756467034c7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
