Wall Street is far less forgiving.\n\nThe recent flops ofandin their trading debuts, the market struggles forandand the shelving of the controversial WeWork initial public offering show that companies need profitable business models and not just sales growth and vague aspirational goals to succeed in the public markets.\n\nNow, market experts are wondering if Airbnb, the red-hot home sharing company that is currently valued at $35 billion, can change the story for unicorns.\n\nThe company recently said it plans to begin trading on Wall Street in 2020 -- most likely through a direct listing like the ones Slack anddid, as opposed to a traditional sale of stock in an IPO.\n\nAirbnb to the rescue\n\nAirbnb has a lot going for it that could make it a better stock than other unicorns. For one, CEO Brian Chesky is highly respected and hasn't made any headlines for establishing a wacky corporate culture like WeWork, or Uber when Travis Kalanick was in charge.\n\nThe company also has a deeper management bench that is ready to handle the rigors of being a public company.\n\nAmazo AMZN Last November, Airbnb hired Dave Stephenson, who had worked forfor 17 years, as its chief financial officer. He most recently had been the vice president and CFO of Amazon's Worldwide Consumer Organization, the unit that oversaw all of Amazon's global retail sites as well as separate divisions like Zappos and Whole Foods.\n\nAt Airbnb, Stephenson joined another prominent Amazon alumnus -- Greg Greeley, who ran the Prime subscription service before becoming Airbnb's president of homes in March 2018\n\nThe company recently reported revenue of more than $1 billion for the second quarter, and has reportedly generated positive earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA).\n\nIn theory, that puts Airbnb closer to an actual profit, and the possiblity that it could have a successful offering next year.\n\nThat would be a big leap over recent offerings.\n\n\"WeWork's planned IPO turned into a highly publicized debacle that suggested public investors may finally be done overpaying for blazing-fast growth,\" said analysts at Renaissance Capital, a firm that specializes in IPO research and manages two IPO ETFs, in a report.\n\nEven an established company like Endeavor Group, the Hollywood talent agency and owner of the UFC mixed martial arts sports league run by Ari Emanuel, had to shelve its offering after first cutting its size and share price. Endeavor was profitable in 2018, but it lost money in 2016 and 2017 and in the first half of 2019.\n\nKatie Nixon, chief investment officer with Northern Trust Wealth Management, said in a report that the IPO market's recent problems reflect \"a renewed and rational lack of exuberance for high valuations in venture capital, and highlights that investors are still paying attention to fundamentals.\"\n\n\"We're not seeing the IPO window closed yet but the market is finicky. There may be more direct listings, but it will take companies with a strong profile like Airbnb to do them,\" said Michael Lin, director of accounting & transaction services at MorganFranklin Consulting.\n\nUnicorn meltdown but don't count out all IPOs\n\nInvestors may be shunning mega-unicorns like Uber and Slack but they have flocked to companies in hot sectors such as cloud security and software.\n\nDatadog DDOG Cloudflare NET Beyond Meat BYND Zoom Video ZM Lin pointed toandas two recent offerings that have held up better than other, more buzzy IPOs, although both stocks were down Tuesday. Investors have continued to flock to plant-based protein makerand web conferencing companyas well.\n\nJohn Mullins, an associate professor of management practice in marketing and entrepreneurship at London Business School, said he remains optimistic about Airbnb's chances for success, because of its market-leading position and stronger financial position.\n\nJUST WATCHED Is Wall Street cooling to tech unicorns?
