Before the 2016 deal, principal debt totaled $13.48 billion. Since then, Dell\u2019s total principal debt has risen to $52.6 billion, nearly 70% of which is classified as core debt, according to the company\u2019s second-quarter report in August. Dell said it has repaid $12.3 billion in core debt since the deal.\n\nThe Round Rock, Texas-based company returned to trading in the public markets in December, five years after going private. Relisting has resulted in increased scrutiny into the company\u2019s financial performance.\n\nInvestors and analysts have frequently told Mr. Sweet over the past year that Dell\u2019s level of debt is \u201cworrisome,\u201d he said at an investor conference Thursday. \u201cThat message has not been lost on us,\u201d Mr. Sweet said, \u201cbut it\u2019s also a message that we had been working on pretty consistently for the last three years.\u201d\n\nTo delever the balance sheet, Dell plans to continue generating strong cash flow, Mr. Sweet said. The company expects core debt to fall to $30 billion by fiscal 2021 and its leverage ratio\u2014which the company calculates as core debt divided by core earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization\u2014to decrease to between 2 and 3 times Ebitda by the end of fiscal year 2021, down from 4.2 times Ebitda in fiscal 2019.\n\nDell\u2019s corporate credit quality has been rated as non-investment grade by S&P Global Inc., Moody\u2019s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings Inc. since 2013, when founder Michael Dell and private-equity firm Silver Lake took the company private. Fitch has a negative outlook for Dell, whereas S&P revised its outlook from negative to stable earlier this month.\n\n\u201cThe long-term debt amount will be determined by growth,\u201d said David Tsui, senior director in the corporate ratings group at S&P Global who follows Dell. \u201cIf the company is growing and the Ebitda base continues to grow, the gross debt amount can be higher.\u201d\n\nDell has continued investing in research and development and, through its majority ownership in software firm VMware Inc., has pursued acquisitions. The company is continuing to look for investment opportunities, Mr. Sweet said.\n\nHeadwinds for the company include import tariffs imposed by the U.S. and China and a slowdown in technology spending. As a result, shipping costs have risen and Dell was forced to raise prices on some data-center products, Mr. Sweet said.\n\nStill, Dell booked record revenue in its client-solutions group in the latest quarter. The unit, which sells items such as PCs and notebooks, notched revenue of $11.75 billion, up 6% from the prior year.\n\nMr. Sweet joined the company in 1997 and was named CFO in 2014. In recent months he has spent a great deal of time with investors to articulate the company\u2019s strategy, he said.\n\n\u201cTrying to make sure our investor base understands that we\u2019re running the business for the long term and are not here to optimize any particular quarter has taken up a fair amount of my time,\u201d Mr. Sweet said.\n\nWrite to Mark Maurer at mark.maurer@wsj.com", "description": "Dell Technologies Inc. finance chief Tom Sweet is focusing on driving down a mountain of debt amid scrutiny from investors and analysts.", "authors": ["Mark Maurer"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-111424/social", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
