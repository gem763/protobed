Littered with Easter eggs, Us leaves the viewer wanting more.\n\nApollo 11\n\nCreated and released for the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission, which landed the first man on the Moon, this stunning documentary is made entirely from archive footage. Directed and produced by Todd Douglas Miller, \u201cthe film\u2019s emotional power comes not in the documentation of astronauts in space but in the absolutely incredible footage of the crowds who watched the launch from Earth,\u201d wrote Adrian Horton for The Guardian, calling it \u201cone of the most astounding films about space ever made\u201d.\n\nMidsommar\n\nAre you afraid of the dark? Perhaps the scariest thing of all is the daylight Midsommar dares you to contemplate. Set during the Swedish summer solstice, it sees a group of unsuspecting US tourists join a rural community for a holiday of a lifetime \u2013 or so they think. Ari Aster\u2019s second feature film after Hereditary, it stars Florence Pugh, Will Poulter and William Jackson Harper. Empire wrote: \u201cAfter a slow simmer, with the village\u2019s off-ness being ramped up degree by degree, it finally reaches a boil in a climax that makes the famous ending of The Wicker Man look like a documentary on the Fyre Festival\u201d.\n\nFor Sama\n\nSyrian filmmaker Waad al-Kateab made this documentary about her life in one of the last standing hospitals in rebel-held Aleppo, where her husband Hamza Al-Khateab was a doctor treating those caught up in the brutal conflict. During their time there, Waad gave birth to her first daughter, Sama. Unflinching in its portrayal of war in all its gruesome reality, Unflinching in its portrayal of war in all its gruesome reality, For Sama was described by Variety as \u201csimple in concept and shattering in execution, blending hard-headed reportage with unguarded personal testimony\u201d and \u201cyou-are-there cinema of the most literal order\u201d.\n\nOnce Upon a Time\u2026 in Hollywood\n\nThe ninth film from Quentin Tarantino, Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood is set in Hollywood\u2019s swinging 60s and stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt as a fictional fading actor and his stunt double, and Margot Robbie as the very real Sharon Tate. At nearly three hours long, this marathon love letter to Hollywood\u2019s golden years \u201ccould be his late-career masterpiece: uproariously funny, surging with cinematic adrenaline and strewn with delectable period detail,\u201d wrote Robbie Collin for The Telegraph. Just don\u2019t tell anyone the ending.\n\nThe Farewell\n\nWritten and directed by Lulu Wang, The Farewell tells the story of a Chinese-American woman, Billi (Awkwafina), who is told her grandmother \u2013 Nai Nai, played by Shuzhen Zhou \u2013 has terminal cancer. However her extended family decide to keep the diagnosis from their sick relation \u2013 and plan a wedding to bring the whole family together for one final time. Based on a true story, which gained traction after Wang told it on NPR\u2019s This American Life in 2016, it was praised by RogerEbert.com as \u201ca story about cultural clashes without ever leaning on wacky stereotypes or lazy clich\u00e9s\u2026 The entire film is pretty perfect, actually.\u201d\n\nParasite\n\nWinner of the 2019 Palme d\u2019Or, Bong Joon-ho\u2019s Parasite \u201cis a black comedy, a social commentary, an action thriller and a bloodbath, all rolled into one,\u201d said BBC Culture\u2019s Emma Jones. The South Korean auteur\u2019s genre-bending seventh feature-film explores the dynamics of class through the intersecting lives of two families, one living in poverty, another in luxury. The son, Ki-woo, becomes a tutor at the rich family\u2019s mansion, and is determined to share his new lifestyle with his parents and sister.\n\nBooksmart\n\nSet over one eventful night, Booksmart follows geeky girls Molly and Amy on the eve of their high-school graduation. The earnest plan of going to the cool kids\u2019 party becomes a hilarious sequence of misadventures in the pursuit of romantic \u2013 and platonic \u2013 love. Olivia Wilde\u2019s directorial debut shows female friendship in a glorious light, with brilliant supporting characters rounding out this coming-of-age gem. \u201cBooksmart is endlessly funny and outrageous, yet always grounded by its realistic central relationship,\u201d wrote Caryn James for BBC Culture.\n\nThe Souvenir\n\nStarring Tilda Swinton and her daughter Honor Swinton Byrne, The Souvenir is inspired by the writer-director Joanna Hogg\u2019s youth in 1980s London. Julie, the young film student played by Swinton Byrne, is romantically involved with an older man, Anthony (Tom Burke), who has a thing for opera and drugs. \u201cWhat is so appealing about it is that Hogg hasn\u2019t made a coming-of-age-film \u2013 there are no neat endings to Julie\u2019s journey into womanhood,\u201d wrote Emma Jones for BBC Culture.\n\nPortrait of a Lady on Fire\n\nWritten and directed by C\u00e9line Sciamma, Portrait of a Lady on Fire transports the viewer back to 18th-Century Brittany in France, where a relationship blossoms between H\u00e9lo\u00efse (Ad\u00e8le Haenel) and her new companion Marianne (No\u00e9mie Merlant). But Marianne is actually an artist, assigned by H\u00e9lo\u00efse\u2019s mother (Valeria Golino), to secretly paint her portrait to send to a potential husband. The Guardian called it \u201ca superbly elegant, enigmatic drama that compels a shiver of aesthetic pleasure and fear\u201d.\n\nThe Lion King\n\nDonald Glover and Beyonc\u00e9 star in the photo-realistic remake of the 25-year-old Disney classic, which divided critics\u2019opinions. The original is widely regarded as being one of the animation studio\u2019s greatest films, and many felt that there was no need for an expensive remake. But \u201cJon Favreau\u2019s film is funnier than the original, even while it enhances the story\u2019s dark themes,\u201d wrote Caryn James for BBC Culture, nodding to the casting of Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen\u2019s Simon and Pumbaa as \u201camong the film's happiest choices\u201d. Despite the film\u2019s detractors, it became the fourth Disney film this year to make $1bn (\u00a3821m) in worldwide box office sales.\n\nFighting with my Family\n\nA teenage goth girl in Norfolk, UK who grew up in a family obsessed with wrestling is the heroine of this delightful biopic of WWE superstar Paige. Directed and written by Stephen Merchant and starring Florence Pugh, with a cameo from Dwayne \u2018The Rock\u2019 Johnson (who also produced it), Fighting with my Family is \u201cso good-hearted in nature that you can't help but get won over by its charm, however familiar it feels at times,\u201d wrote Digital Spy.\n\nView image of (Credit: Sixteen Films)\n\nSorry We Missed You\n\nKen Loach\u2019s Sorry We Missed You follows the life of Ricky Turner (Kris Hitchen), a delivery driver in the north of England who relies on self-employment in the gig economy for income.

Following on from Infinity War, the Avengers assembled once more to put the universe to rights, and defeat the evil Thanos. Vox called Endgame \u201ca movie steeped in years of lore that still manages to recapture the excitement of watching your very first Marvel experience.\u201d It went on to beat Avatar as the world\u2019s highest-grossing film ever, and was the UK\u2019s fastest-selling digital download film of all time.\n\nRolling Thunder: A Bob Dylan Story by Martin Scorsese\n\nMade up of fictional and non-fictional elements, this follow up to Martin Scorsese's previous Bob Dylan film, No Direction Home, it documents Rolling Thunder Revue tour of 1975-76.

You\u2019ll feel like one of the many hanger-ons who latched on for the ride.\u201d\n\nLove film?
