The company is not expected to announce a 5G iPhone just yet, but many look to see an improved camera, faster processor and new technology in its screen.\n\nWedbush analyst Daniel Ives has been looking forward for this day for months now. Ahead of the big event, Ives maintains an Outperform rating (i.e., 'buy') on Apple stock, with $245 price target, which implies about 15% upside from current levels. (To watch Ives' track record, click here)\n\nIves estimates about 300 million active iPhone users are in the \"window of an upgrade opportunity\" over the next 12 to 18 months. With this being the case, the analyst says Apple \u201crecognize[s] this will be a crucial product cycle on the horizon,\u201d and could \u201ctranslate into roughly 180 million iPhone units sold in FY20.\u201d Ives\u2019 estimates shows iPhone demand increasing since last year, with the company planning on 75 million units for the initial iPhone 11 launch period, with the ability to raise to 80 million.\n\nFrom a product point of view, the analyst believes \u201cthe video capability on iPhone 11 Pro versions will be significantly stepped up with real time re-cropping technology,\u201d while the iPhone 11 should be more durable with shatter resistant technology. Besides iPhone, Ives says Apple CEO Tim Cook could \u201ctip the hand on the new AirPods version 3 set to be launched towards year-end ahead of (the) holiday season with these AirPods expected to have some design enhancements and will be waterproof with slightly higher price points expected.\u201d\n\nOverall, Ives remains a bull on Apple. He says \u201cthe installed base of Apple remains the golden jewel and key to the valuation and our bullish thesis with iPhone 11 representing a key opportunity to catalyze these consumers into their next iPhone.\u201d Its Services segment, which produces high-margin revenue, \u201cis worth between $400 billion and $450 billion and still in the early days of being fully monetized,\u201d as the company prepares to launch its streaming service this year.\n\nHow does Ives' bullish bet weigh in against the Street? It appears the analyst is not the only one enthusiastic on the giant\u2019s prospects, with TipRanks analytics demonstrating AAPL as a Buy. Out of 28 analysts polled in the last 3 months, 16 are bullish on Apple stock while 11 remain sidelined, and only one is bearish.
