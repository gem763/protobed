It is what they are.\n\nIt is sometimes all they are, beyond the actual supporters who wear the kits, given how much else changes.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

There are countless stories of the game\u2019s greatest figures becoming enchanted in their youth by the mere colours of a team, and the magic that represented.\n\nEven men as hard-bitten as Bill Shankly and Sir Matt Busby waxed about the wonder of Madrid\u2019s kits. Many players in the modern game still get that thrill when they first put on the shirt of their great new club.\n\nYoung players - like Eden Hazard once, like Cristiano Ronaldo once - grow up dreaming of wearing Madrid\u2019s white.\n\nThey don\u2019t grow up dreaming of wearing Manchester United\u2019s experimental grey kit from the 1995-96 season, or that Madrid shirt that had a dragon on it.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say a club\u2019s colours shouldn\u2019t be given reconsideration. Liverpool wear all red because Shankly felt it would be more imposing than white shorts. Leeds United wear all white because Don Revie was inspired by Real Madrid, and wanted his team to inspire the same awe.\n\nOccasional change, too, can be necessary and freshen a club. They can still add to identity. Some of the most cherished kits - like Arsenal\u2019s \u201cbruised banana\u201d jersey, or Everton\u2019s white-topped NEC jersey - came from the will to do something a bit different. The very identity of clubs will also evolve, and incorporate more elements, more colours.\n\nBut that\u2019s the point. Such reconsiderations should be made for the right reasons, in-keeping with the heritage and identity of a club\u2026 of what they want to be.\n\nThey shouldn\u2019t be solely made to make money. They shouldn\u2019t just be because of contractual terms that the kit must be changed each season. That has logically led to some of the worst kits, because of the pressure to do something different, to alternate from the previous year. It lends itself to unnecessary tinkering with vintage designs, to odd splashes.\n\nIf a club had something appealingly simple one season, like Chelsea in 2017-18, it means they have to go a different direction literally just to be different.\n\nIt similarly means that individual kits themselves can\u2019t accumulate the same history, the same meaning.\n\nPSG did admittedly change their shirt for this game because it has been part of French football culture for the last 20 years to have different European kits, and this very design was actually their own old home jersey, with these colours ceremonially acknowledging that. A club as traditionalist as Bayern Munich have meanwhile had a variety of different designs and colours over that time. But PSG have still spent more of their history in dark blue than white, having only been founded in 1970, and more arbitrary changes are now creeping into areas of the game where there was no such culture.\n\nHow many clubs this season will strategically time the release of their third kit, or a mere \u201ccup kit\u201d? There are just more and more changes, because of something in football that doesn\u2019t change: how it has embraced extreme capitalism more than almost any other area of society.\n\nIt is thereby just another element of the game - and a very elementary part of the game - parcelled off and sold off, to an increasingly greater degree.\n\nTo borrow a line from another US TV show, there was a similar traditionalist - if an admittedly capitalistic sociopath in his own way - in Phil Leotardo in the Sopranos.\n\n\u201cEither it has meaning or no meaning.\u201d\n\nThese days, it seems a lot more towards the latter. In so many matches, many clubs no longer look like themselves.", "description": "One of the easy lines from Parc des Princes on Tuesday was that Paris Saint-Germain were made to look like Real Madrid, but that does raise a more complicated question for the game.
