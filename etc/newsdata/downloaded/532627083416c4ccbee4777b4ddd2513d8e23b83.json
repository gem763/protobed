After requesting that I stay, they obliged.\u201d He added that, due to his exit agreement, \u201cI won\u2019t be reporting elsewhere at least in the near future.\u201d\n\nFull video: Shepard Smith's final sign off from Fox News pic.twitter.com/5fgyM81Gbj \u2014 Jon Passantino (@passantino) October 11, 2019\n\nJournalists and staffers at the network were said to be shocked by the exit.\n\n\u201cIt feels like death in the news division,\u201d said a senior Fox employee cited by CNN. The employee said some staffers were crying at the announcement.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a little stunned and a little heartbroken,\u201d said anchor Neil Cavuto at the beginning of his show, which followed directly after Smith\u2019s. Fox News chief White House correspondent John Roberts compared hearing news of Smith\u2019s departure to getting \u201chit by a subway train.\u201d\n\nThe resignation comes weeks after Smith and Tucker Carlson feuded on their respective programs over the merits of Judge Andrew Napolitano\u2019s call for President Trump\u2019s resignation. A guest on Carlson called Napolitano a \u201cfool\u201d for suggesting Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky warranted impeachment and Smith responded by calling the guest \u201crepugnant.\u201d\n\nSmith also traded insults with pro-Trump opinion hosts Laura Ingraham and Sean Hannity last year. Ingraham called Smith \u201cinconsiderate\u201d and Hannity labeled him \u201cclueless\u201d after he made disparaging comments about the network\u2019s opinion programming.\n\nTrump, who routinely denigrated Smith\u2019s talent as a broadcaster, has recently taken to criticizing Fox News generally, particularly for recent polls indicating waning support. He has also begun to suggest that the unabashedly pro-Trump One America News Network might serve as a suitable replacement news outlet for his supporters to rely on.", "description": "Fox News Channel's chief anchor, Shepard Smith, announced on air Friday that he would be resigning from his post after 23 years with the network.", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "Kevin D.
