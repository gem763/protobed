The majority of Thomas Cook holidays were packages and are Atol protected.\n\nMr Moriarty said any traveller not covered by Atol and who wished to return early might still find seats on Sunday's remaining flights. However, he said there was no guarantee of availability and priority would be given to those already due to return today.\n\nTo find out if there are available seats on repatriation flights, travellers can contact the CAA call centre on +44 1753 330 330. They should not go to the airport unless a seat is confirmed, the CAA said.\n\nSaga continues\n\nThe return of the remaining passengers will bring to an end the biggest-ever peacetime repatriation.\n\nHowever, the Thomas Cook saga is far from over, with the future travel plans of many customers in disarray and thousands of job losses.\n\nThe CAA said it will turn its attention to refunding the 360,000 bookings cancelled when Britain's oldest travel group went under.\n\nThe travel firm collapsed with a black hole of more than \u00a33bn in the early hours of 23 September, after failing to obtain rescue funds from its banks.\n\nAn inquiry has been launched by the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee, with MPs focussing on directors' stewardship of the company.\n\nAnd the Financial Reporting Council, the accounting watchdog, is to investigate the auditing of the company.", "description": "Flights bringing back the remaining 4,800 holidaymakers are due to take off on Sunday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/D686/production/_108881945_rzfbm0y7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
