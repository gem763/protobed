I went to the Museum of Modern Art, where I sat and sketched Matisse\u2019s sculpture of a woman named Jeannette . I felt uneasy and confident at the same time.\n\nFrom there, I headed to Greenwich Village. I walked around Washington Square Park listening to the guitar players on the sidewalks. I was entranced by the flower children wading in the fountain. I wandered past head shops that smelled of patchouli and sandalwood. I bought a handmade silver ring with a narrow green stone for my index finger.\n\nI moved away from New York not long after that, but my son lives in Brooklyn now. When I visited him last year, I asked him to take me to Washington Square Park. And I gave him the silver ring I bought back then.\n\n\u2014 Kerry Workman", "description": "Skipping school to go to Manhattan, help with untied laces and more reader tales of New York City in this week\u2019s Metropolitan Diary.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/06/nyregion/06diary-4/06diary-4-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
