Problem is, there wouldn\u2019t be enough of either.\n\nMedicare for all, as it\u2019s known, would replace the current patchwork system of private and public insurance programs with a single government program, similar to Medicare, that covers everybody. Most doctors and other caregivers would stay on private sector payrolls, rather than go to work for the government. But for the plan to work, the government would pay caregivers and hospitals less than most private sector insurers pay today. That would force hospital closures and drive doctors out of medicine, at the same demand for health care is surging.\n\n\u201cIt would cause massive disruption,\u201d says Kenneth Thorpe, chairman of the health policy department at Emory University. \u201cSome physicians would be so frustrated they\u2019d probably just fold up shop. You\u2019d have waiting lines, absolutely.\u201d\n\nBernie Sanders\u2019 Medicare for all plan\u2014which fellow presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren supports\u2014would eliminate most private insurance and enroll everybody in a government plan. Private analyses estimate it would require at least $3 trillion per year in new federal spending. That would require new taxes, along with major cuts in what the nation spends on doctors and hospitals.\n\nHospitals and doctors would lose money\n\nThe Sanders proposal says the government would pay health care providers at current Medicare rates. That would lower payments to doctors by about 30%, and payments to hospitals by about 40%. \u201cThe proposed cuts to providers now working through private insurance would be severe,\u201d writes health economist Charles Blahous of George Mason University\u2019s Mercatus Center.\n\nMedicare, for instance, pays hospitals about 90% of their costs on average, which means hospitals lose money on Medicare patients. They make it up, and then some, on patients covered by private insurance, which pays hospitals about 145% of their costs. If all patients were covered under Medicare, every hospital in the country would lose money, on average. Some analysts worry about hospital closures under Medicare for all, especially in rural areas.\n\nThere are about 1 million physicians in America. Primary-care doctors earn $237,000 per year, on average, while specialists earn $341,000. Most people might think doctors could take a 30% or 40% pay cut and still be doing fine. But medical school costs as much as $250,000, and new graduates often spend years working at low-paid residencies. The expectation of high pay in the future is one reason medical students and young doctors grind it out. Nobody has estimated the number of doctors who would quit under Medicare for all, but it\u2019s normal for any profession to become less popular as financial incentives decline.\n\nThis would happen as demand for health care rises by 10% or more, since uninsured people would now have coverage and the underinsured would be able to get more care, cheaper. There could be a particular shortage of primary care doctors, already scarce in some areas. \u201cPrimary care would be in serious jeopardy,\u201d says Thorpe.\n\nChanging the system\u2019s financial structure\n\nSome analysts assume that if Congress ever passed Medicare for all into law, it would have to have higher payment rates than Medicare does now, to prevent a shortage of doctors and hospitals. But then it would cost more, and the idea becomes less compelling the more it costs. As it is, Medicare for all would necessitate large tax increases on both workers and businesses. The higher those taxes go, the less popular a single-payer program will become.\n\nSenators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren back government-run \"Medicare for all,\" which would cover everybody.

If they can do it, why can\u2019t we? The answer is a quirk of history. In most of those countries, the health care system began as a public benefit program decades ago, and the cost of medical school is usually heavily subsidized by the government.
