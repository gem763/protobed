As a general rule, if you withdraw funds before age 59 \u00bd, you\u2019ll trigger an IRS tax penalty of 10%. The good news is that there\u2019s a way to take your distributions a few years early without incurring this penalty. This is known as the Rule of 55. If you\u2019re contemplating early retirement or need to take money from your 401(k) or a similar plan for any other reason, it\u2019s helpful to know how the rule of 55 works.\n\nWhat Is the Rule of 55?\n\nUnder the terms of this rule, you can withdraw funds from your current job\u2019s 401(k) or 403(b) plan with no 10% tax penalty if you leave that job in or after the year you turn 55. (Qualified public safety workers can start even earlier, at 50.) It doesn\u2019t matter whether you were laid off, fired, or just quit.\n\nThe distributions are not completely tax free: Like all withdrawals from a traditional 401(k) or 403(b), you do have to pay income tax. (The employer is required to withhold 20% from any Rule of 55 withdrawal for federal income tax, which is non-negotiable.) Only the 10% tax penalty is bypassed in this scenario.\n\nIn addition, note that employers are not obliged to allow early withdrawals; and, if they do allow them, they may require that the entire amount be taken out in one lump-sum withdrawal. This could expose you to a higher income tax.\n\nThis rule applies to current \u2013 not former \u2013 401(k) or 403(b) plans. The government does not permit penalty-free withdrawals before 59 \u00bd from plans you had with a previous employer. If you want access to that money under the Rule of 55, you would have to transfer those funds into your current 401(k) or 403(b) plan.\n\nTiming is Critical\n\nHere's how the 401k 55 rule works. More\n\nThe timing of your early withdrawals is important, says Dave Lowell, certified financial planner and founder of Up Your Money Game.\n\n\u201cIf you were employed for most of the year and had a relatively high income, then it makes sense to not withdraw money under the Rule of 55 in that calendar year, since it will add to your total income for the year and possibly result in you moving to a higher marginal tax bracket,\u201d Lowell says.\n\nThe better strategy in that scenario may be to use other savings or take withdrawals from after-tax investments until the next calendar rolls around. This may result in your taxable income being much lower.\n\nAlternatives to Rule of 55 Withdrawals\n\nThe Rule of 55, which doesn\u2019t apply to traditional or Roth IRAs, isn\u2019t the only way to get money from your retirement plan early. For example, you won\u2019t pay the penalty if distributions are taken early because:\n\nYou become totally and permanently disabled.\n\nYou pass away and your beneficiary or estate is withdrawing money from the plan.\n\nYou\u2019re taking distributions to pay deductible medical expenses that exceed 7.5% of your adjusted gross income.\n\nDistributions are taken as the result of an IRS levy.\n\nYou\u2019re receiving qualified reservist distributions.\n\nYou can also avoid the 10% early withdrawal penalty if early distributions are made as part of a series of substantially equal periodic payments, known as a SEPP plan. You have to be separated from service to qualify for this exception if you\u2019re taking money from an employer\u2019s plan, but you\u2019re not subject to the 55 or older requirement. The payment amounts you\u2019d receive would be based on your life expectancy.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe rule of 55 allows you to take money from your employer\u2019s retirement plan without a tax penalty before age 59 1/2, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you should. Whether an early retirement is right for you depends largely on your goals and overall financial situation.\n\n\u201cRetiring earlier than 62 means no Social Security income,\u201d Lowell says. \u201cThe person needs to make sure they know where their income is coming from.\u201d\n\nFor example, will you have a pension that pays out regular annuity payments to rely on? Or will you be able to draw from taxable investment accounts, savings accounts, CDs or other assets to cover your expenses in early retirement?\n\nIf you plan to retire early but you don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need to tap into your 401(k) just yet, consider what else you could do with it. Leaving it with your employer to continue growing is one option; rolling it over to an IRA is another. The more thought you give to how and when you\u2019ll need to use those assets beforehand, the better you can position yourself for a financially sound early retirement.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Employer-sponsored, tax-deferred retirement plans like 401(k)s and 403(b)s have rules about when you can access your funds.
