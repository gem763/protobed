People dress up in costumes and have a good time, regardless of age in many cases. While the kids are getting ready to trick-or-treat, adults often find themselves at parties. After all, unless you worry about evil spirits, there\u2019s not much to dislike about dressing up in silly costumes for a night.\n\nCouple that with the normal reasons to have a party and there\u2019s a lot of celebration going on this time of the year.\n\nUnfortunately, sometimes a large group of people just means a greater opportunity for something bad to happen.\n\nThree men were fatally shot and at least nine other people injured in a shooting in Long Beach, Calif., on Tuesday night, the authorities said. The shooting occurred on the 2700 block of Seventh Street in the Southern California city during a Halloween party at a private home, according to fire officials and local news outlets. The motive for the attack was not immediately clear. The police said they were looking for several suspects, according to KTLA 5, a local news station. The Long Beach Fire Department said in a post on Twitter that it responded to the shooting shortly before 11 p.m. At 10:44 pm, @lbfirefighters responded to shooting at a residence on the 2700 block of 7th Street. An MCI was declared with a total of 12 patients. 3 confirmed fatalities (adult males) 9 patients transported to local area hospitals. 5 immediate & 4 delayed.

However, CNN reports that the suspects fled from the scene after the shooting.\n\nThe federal definition of mass murder is four or more people killed in a single incident and people more or less define a mass shooting as four or more people shot and killed in a single incident, meaning this doesn\u2019t quite rise to that level. However, it\u2019s no less shocking and upsetting.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s also possible this wasn\u2019t some random shooting.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that, like the shooting in Texas over the weekend, this was a targeted attack. Long Beach has some pretty rough neighborhoods. It doesn\u2019t look like this home was located in one of the rough areas, though, but that doesn\u2019t mean violence can\u2019t spill out of those neighborhoods. We simply don\u2019t know, though. Declarations either way are mere speculation.\n\nAs of right now, we find ourselves looking at another shooting that\u2019s on the cusp of a mass shooting by definition, but close enough that many won\u2019t see much of a difference. This is similar to the Gilroy shooting in California earlier this summer. That incident also had a death toll just short of the standard definition.\n\nNot that definitions are really what\u2019s important right now. Today, three families are going to be in mourning. At least nine other people will be dealing with injuries, though there may be more as officials believe it\u2019s possible that some were able to seek medical care on their own and thus aren\u2019t part of the tally.\n\nPolice have not released any information about the suspects, so we don\u2019t know who folks in Long Beach should keep an eye out for, much less why they would do something like this. Regardless, though, there are questions that need to be answered.\n\nIn the meantime, there are five of the nine wounded categorized as \u201cserious.\u201d Let\u2019s all pray they don\u2019t raise the death toll any further and that all make a full recovery.", "description": "Three people are dead, nine wounded following a shooting at a party in Long Beach, California.
