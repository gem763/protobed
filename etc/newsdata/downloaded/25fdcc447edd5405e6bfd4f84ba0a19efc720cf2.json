It\u2019s diminishing to be perceived mainly as someone else\u2019s son . . . How do you compete with Kirk Douglas? How do you live in Michael Douglas\u2019 shadow?\u201d the 40-year-old writes in his new memoir, \u201cLong Way Home\u201d (Knopf), out Tuesday.\n\nMICHAEL DOUGLAS' SON CAMERON RECALLS HARROWING BATTLE WITH ADDICTION\n\nHe followed in his father\u2019s footsteps, at least when it came to drugs, only he took a rougher path.\n\nFor years, Cameron was a coke and heroin addict, dealing crystal meth and living a life of destruction which led to nearly eight years in prison.\n\nIn the book, he recalls a series of stick-ups for which he was never arrested. Once, at a Hollywood motel, he pulled an air gun on the petrified old lady manning the front desk, and demanded she open the cash register. It had a single $20 bill in it.\n\nThe Hollywood scion grabbed it.\n\nKIRK DOUGLAS HONORED WITH HISTORIC MARKER AT NEW YORK BIRTHPLACE\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing it less for the money than for the adrenaline . . . and the bragging rights,\u201d Cameron writes. \u201cI like confusing people, making them puzzle over how someone who came from so much privilege can do such crazy s\u2014t.\u201d\n\nHe was arrested in New York City in 1999 for cocaine possession and again in 2005 when Los Angeles cops found heroin and crack in his car. Two years later, he was charged with felony possession of a controlled substance after police pulled him over in Santa Barbara, Calif. and discovered a syringe of liquid cocaine.\n\nMICHAEL DOUGLAS SAYS CATHERINE ZETA-JONES TEASES HIM ABOUT AGING\n\nIn 2009, Cameron was dealt his biggest blow when he was arrested during a sting at the Gansevoort hotel in Manhattan. He pleaded guilty to heroin possession and conspiracy to distribute drugs and was sentenced to five years \u2014 only to be slapped, in 2011, with four and a half more years for possessing items that tested positive for cocaine and heroin, which he scored from fellow inmates.\n\nCameron had been exposed to the party scene most of his life.\n\nHe writes about the bevy of stars who would live it up at the family home: Jack Nicholson, Pat Riley, Oliver Stone, Danny DeVito.\n\n\u201cEven as a really young kid, I remember running joints back and forth,\u201d he says in the book. \u201cDad would say, \u2018Hey, bring this over to your uncle,\u2019 and I would, not realizing until years later what it had been. As I got older, I would creep from house to house on the compound, climbing balconies and seeing more than I was supposed to: beautiful grown-ups doing the things that beautiful grown-ups living lives of excess do.\u201d\n\nKIRK DOUGLAS, 102, POSES FOR FAMILY PHOTO FEATURING FOUR GENERATIONS: \u2018FAMILY FIRST\u2019\n\nOnce Michael\u2019s famous friends had left their rooms, Cameron and his own pal would rifle through the stars\u2019 bags looking for whatever substances were responsible for the wild night before.\n\nCameron recalls how, after nights like those, his dad would take him for early morning breakfasts at a Sunset Boulevard hotel; it was only as an adult, he writes, that he realized those father-son moments were actually when Michael was coming down after a long night of partying.\n\nThe movie star\u2019s wild life was long a point of contention between Michael and Cameron\u2019s mother, Diandra.\n\n\u201cWhen I was seven and we were in Aspen, [my mother] held up a little plastic bag with what looked like the dried flowers she used to make the bathroom smell nice . . . \u2018Do you know what this is, Cameron?\u2019 This is a drug. Your father is using drugs,\u2019 \u201d he writes.\n\nMichael and Diandra\u2019s marriage was tumultuous from the get-go.\n\nFor her 21st birthday, in 1979, Michael threw her a raging bash at their home in Beverly Hills \u2014 despite the fact that she had tonsillitis.\n\nCATHERINE ZETA-JONES \u2018DEVASTATED\u2019 BY SEXUAL HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS MADE AGAINST MICHAEL DOUGLAS\n\n\u201cDad didn\u2019t cancel the party, and while she lay ill in bed upstairs, he partied downstairs with [the band] Foreigner and other guests, nearly all of them his friends. Finally, at 5 a.m., Mom kicked every one out,\u201d Cameron writes. \u201cAfterward, she decided she didn\u2019t like show business or the people in it. This would be a problem, since that was Dad\u2019s life.\u201d\n\nTheir father-son bond was also often strained, due in part to Michael\u2019s career.\n\n\u201cOur relationship was a series of jump cuts, vivid bursts when we were together punctuating longer stretches when we were apart,\u201d Cameron writes.\n\nOne summer, Michael decided that Cameron needed a \u201cmore constant male influence.\u201d\n\nDuring a lunch with Diandra, at the Ivy in Beverly Hills, Michael pointed to a busboy.\n\nMICHAEL DOUGLAS AND CATHERINE ZETA-JONES CELEBRATE EXACTLY 25-YEAR AGE DIFFERENCE\n\n\u201cDad said, \u2018What about this guy? He seems very capable. He could be a houseman or something like that.\u2019 Mom spoke to him in Spanish . . . he was from El Salvador,\u201d Cameron writes. \u201cSoon [he] was living with us. He took care of me from the moment I woke up to the moment I went to sleep.\u201d\n\nCameron, age 10, was heartbroken when the former busboy told him he was leaving.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d later learn that Mom had found vodka bottles under [his] bed and asked him to stop drinking,\u201d he writes.\n\nMICHAEL DOUGLAS ON THE COLLEGE ADMISSIONS SCANDAL: 'IT\u2019S JUST EGREGIOUS'\n\nCameron had just started at boarding school when he heard that his father had checked into rehab for \u201csex addiction.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs far as I could tell, he was there mainly for his drinking and to placate Mom. She had caught him in bed with another woman, given him an ultimatum that he had to deal with his drug and alcohol intake, and two weeks later he checked into Sierra Tuscon, a clinic in Arizona,\u201d he writes.\n\nMichael continued to stray and, in the summer of 1995, Diandra reached her breaking point after a private investigator caught the star at the Beverly Wilshire hotel with yet another woman.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sad to think back on, but when they told me they were getting divorced, it didn\u2019t knock my socks off. Actually, I welcomed it,\u201d Cameron says in his book.\n\nMICHAEL DOUGLAS DISHES ON HIS ADVICE TO DAUGHTER CARYS AS SHE STARTS DATING: 'WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU'RE FRIENDS?\u2019\n\nAt one point, before Cameron\u2019s prison sentence, Michael told his son that it was impossible to nurture a relationship with him.\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019re going to overdose, or someone\u2019s going to kill you, or you\u2019re going to kill someone. I\u2019m trying to prepare myself emotionally,\u201d Michael said, according to the book.\n\nDespite the familial ups and downs, Cameron was elated when Michael and Kirk, whom Cameron calls \u201cPappy,\u201d visited him at the Metropolitan Correction Center in Manhattan while he awaited sentencing in 2009.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so impressed by Pappy, and touched. He\u2019s ninety-three, and he\u2019s come all the way from California to see me,\u201d Cameron recalls in the book.\n\nKirk asked him: \u201cYou\u2019ve been getting in any fights?\u201d\n\nCameron told him yes.\n\nMICHAEL DOUGLAS THOUGHT HE WAS 'GOING TO LOSE' SON CAMERON TO DRUG ADDICTION\n\n\u201cHave you been winning or losing?\u201d Kirk asked.\n\n\u201cWinning,\u201d Cameron responded.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my boy.\u201d\n\nWhile in prison, Cameron commissioned a huge tattoo on his torso of his grandfather and father.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been able to overcome my conflicting feelings about my last name, my pride in it and at the same time, my discomfort with having it define how other people see me,\u201d he writes.\n\n\u201cWhen I get their faces tattooed on my body, I feel ready, finally, to show an uncomplicated pride in them. When I show the tattoo to Dad, he seems embarrassed.\u201d\n\nAfter being released from prison in 2016, Cameron moved into a Bronx halfway house and, later, into a Tribeca apartment with his girlfriend, Viviane Thibes, a yoga instructor.\n\nHe writes about traveling to California to visit Kirk, who, at 100, is taken with his grandson\u2019s tattoo and grills him about life in prison.\n\n\u201cEvery time a guest comes over, Pappy calls me over and has me show off my abs,\u201d Cameron writes of the \u201cSpartacus\u201d star.\n\nWHAT MICHAEL DOUGLAS' SON CAMERON IS UP TO NOW\n\n\u201cHe has so much curiosity, asking endless questions about prison life. \u2018Were you in a gang? Did you fight a lot? Did you kill anyone?\u2019 \u201d\n\nCameron credits his dad\u2019s second wife, actress Catherine Zeta-Jones, with \u201cpushing [Michael] to extend his paternal love to me.\n\n\u201cOne day, we\u2019re hanging out and [my dad] says, \u2018I don\u2019t know how you did it. How you went through the things you did.\u2019 It\u2019s the first time he\u2019s ever acknowledged it quite like that,\u201d Cameron writes.\n\nNow, he\u2019s a father himself. In December 2017, Viviane gave birth to their daughter, Lua Izzy Douglas. They live in the Hollywood Hills and Cameron is pursuing a career in acting \u2014 and rebuilding a relationship with his family.\n\n\u201c[My father and I] never really became friends, as many father and sons do at a certain point, but now we\u2019re starting to do that,\u201d Cameron writes.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re forming the relationship I\u2019ve always wanted.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared in Page Six.", "description": "Cameron Douglas was born into movie royalty \u2014 but his life hasn\u2019t all been glamorous.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/cameron-douglas-michael-douglas.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
