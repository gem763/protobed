The six-foot-one sprinter has raced there once when he clocked 20.17 to place fourth at the 2017 Diamond League Final.\n\nIn 2009, current world-record holder Usain Bolt ran 19.57 in Brussels, two years before fellow Jamaican Yohan Blake stormed to a 19.26 winning time and Diamond League record.\n\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TBT?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#TBT</a><br><br>Throwing it back to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/YohanBlake?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@YohanBlake</a>'s 19.26 200m <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DiamondLeague?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#DiamondLeague</a> record at the 2011 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MVDbrussels?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@MVDbrussels</a> <br><br>It remains the second fastest 200m ever run<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BrusselsDL?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#BrusselsDL</a> \ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddea <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DLFinal?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#DLFinal</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/XaBL4bEzLm\">pic.twitter.com/XaBL4bEzLm</a> \u2014@Diamond_League\n\n\"I've been running in Lane 3 lately which is pretty tight for me as a taller runner,\" says the 27-year-old Brown. \"But on a wider turn [in Brussels] I can replicate like I'm running straight and that's when you can run a fast curve.\"\n\nWATCH | 9 Canadians to watch at Diamond League Finals:\n\nCBC Sports Anson Henry gives some background on the unprecedented nine Canadian athletes in the IAAF Diamond League Finals. 3:59\n\nStrong finishes\n\nBrown ran a pair of 100s earlier this week in his tune-up for Brussels, going 10.08 and 10.18, respectively, in Berlin and Zagreb, Croatia.\n\nIn the 200, the Toronto native has been particularly satisfied with his finish the past three or four races, dating back to a season-best 19.95 on July 5 at a Diamond League meet in Lausanne, Switzerland. Brown spent the early part of this season focused on the final 50 metres that was his nemesis a year ago.\n\n\"I just have to put both [phases] together,\" Brown says, noting he's close to full health after suffering a minor strain in his right hip flexor.\n\nWATCH | Anatomy of the 200m, with Aaron Brown:\n\nEver wonder what it feels like to race the best in the world for 200 metres? Aaron Brown walks you through every step and what both his mind and body are going through at each point. 2:44\n\nA key to the Florida resident's success this season that includes two Diamond League victories in the 200 and a Canadian title is striking a balance away from the track that Brown says helps keep his mind at ease. He recently became engaged to longtime girlfriend Preeya Milburn.\n\n\"When you're caught up in wanting to be successful at world championships and the Olympics,\" he says, \"you can get fixated on trying to be the best, but it's good to have other things going on outside of that one focus. I've found that having that balance is key to staying present.\"\n\nOn Friday, Brown will be part of a nine-man field that could be nearly as stacked as the 200 at the world championships later this month in Doha, Qatar.\n\nWhen I competed, one of the things I did was use the Diamond League to perfect my race ... and it seems that is what Noah is doing this year. \u2014 CBC Sports track analyst Donovan Bailey on top 200-metre runner Noah Lyles\n\nLeading the way is Noah Lyles, who responded to a June 6 loss to fellow American Michael Norman at the Diamond League's Golden Gala in Rome with a 2019 world-leading and personal-best time of 19.50 a month later in Lausanne. The 22-year-old ran 19.65 on Aug. 24 in Paris and won last year's Diamond Trophy and $50,000 US top prize with a 19.67 clocking to beat Guliyev.\n\n\"When I competed,\" says CBC Sports track analyst Donovan Bailey, \"one of the things I did was use the Diamond League to perfect my race \u2026 and it seems this is what Noah is doing this year.

They have split two races in the 100 and 200 this season, with De Grasse prevailing in Sunday's 100 at the IAAF Berlin World Challenge in a season-best 9.97.

Towards the end it felt as though I was running on fumes, but I feel fresh now. I've had more down time and was smart with my race schedule.\"\n\nEcuador's Alex Quinonez, with five wins and 10 podium finishes in 11 races this season, Guliyev and Norman, a specialist in the 400, are others to watch in Friday's race, scheduled for 2:37 p.m. ET.\n\n\"Norman can beat this entire field,\" says Bailey. \"[Friday's race] is simply speed work for him [to train for the 400 at worlds]. If there's good weather, it should be an amazing race.\"\n\nBailey's predicted order of finish: 1) Lyles 2) Norman 3) De Grasse 4) Brown\n\nOther Canadians competing in Brussels:\n\nGabriela DeBues-Stafford, women's 5,000 metres (2:45 p.m. ET): After setting a combined five indoor/outdoor records this season, the Toronto native made her Diamond League Final debut on Aug. 29 in Zurich and became the first Canadian woman to run under four minutes, placing third in 3:59.59.\n\nWATCH | Gabriela DeBues-Stafford breaks 4 minutes in 1,500m:\n\nGabriela Debues-Stafford finished third and became the first-ever Canadian woman to break the 4-minute mark in the women's 1,500-metre race, with a time of 3:59.59. 6:25\n\nDeBues-Stafford, 23, clocked a 14:51.59 PB for a national record in her lone 5,000 of 2019 on May 30 in her Diamond League season debut at Stockholm.\n\nCrystal Emmanuel, women's 100 (2:12 p.m.): The 27-year-old from Toronto and DeBues-Stafford are the only Canadians to compete in different events at both Diamond League Finals this year.
