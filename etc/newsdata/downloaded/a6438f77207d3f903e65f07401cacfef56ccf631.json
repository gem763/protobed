No doubt that Nifty 50 and showed exemplary performance after the boosting dose, provided by the Indian Finance Minister Mrs. Nirmala Sitharaman, and as well as by the Prime Minister of India Mr. Narendra Modi; but this news flow blown-moves in Indian equity markets look evident enough to increase skepticism among the investors about the upcoming moves from September 24th, 2019; specially at the time when both the Nifty 50 and Bank Nifty have entered once again into overbought territory; after negating the prevailing uncertainty at international level.\n\nNo doubt that the steep upward moves on September 20th, 2019 (Friday) and September 23rd, 2019 (Monday) have pushed both the Indian indices at the levels, much above what they were on the day when the recent GDP data was announced; I find that nothing much has been changed since then in Indian economic scenario. I, therefore, find that the news flow seems to have finally over and now, internationally prevailing global concern over unresolved tariff trade war, steady which have crossed the level of $1529, which reflects the seriousness of global economic slowdown; look ready to influence the upcoming directional move from September 24th, 2019 onwards. Secondly, the growing tension in the Middle East since drone attack on Saudis oil fields; which has resulted in higher prices; seems to be an immediate global worry for equity markets.\n\nFinally, I conclude that as the manufacturing activities in Germany have fallen to their lowest level since 2009 this month, while on the other hand manufacturing in the eurozone has slipped to a six-year low and services grew at their slowest pace in eight months; may keep the global equity markets under bearish pressure. I find that the may see a heavy sell-off from the level of 11,723 amid growing volatility in global equity markets during the upcoming trading session. No doubt that if the Nifty 50 remains unable to defend the level of 11,080 till weekly closing; extending exhaustion may push the Nifty 50 below the level of 10,900.
