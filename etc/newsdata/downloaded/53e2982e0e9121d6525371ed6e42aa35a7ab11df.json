One case involves a plaintiff from Georgia, Gerald Bostock, who alleges he was fired by a former employer who discovered his sexual orientation.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAnother case involves a man named Don Zarda, who alleged that he was fired from his job as a skydiving instructor in New York after a customer complained to his employer that Zarda had noted that he was gay. Zorda died in 2014, but his estate is pursuing his case.\n\nAnd the court will also weigh in on a case where a transgender woman named Aimee Terese alleged that she was fired from the Michigan funeral home where she worked after she revealed to her boss that she no longer identified as a man.\n\nThe justices appeared to be split mostly along ideological lines, though Justice Neil Gorsuch Neil GorsuchOvernight Health Care \u2014 Presented by Coalition Against Surprise Medical Billing \u2014 Buttigieg unveils aggressive plan to lower drug prices | Supreme Court abortion case poses major test for Trump picks | Trump takes heat from right over vaping crackdown Pressley joins hundreds of activists calling for Kavanaugh impeachment: 'I believe in the power of us' Fallout from Kavanaugh confirmation felt in Washington one year later MORE, a Trump appointee, questioned the lawyers for both sides, which may be a sign that he could potentially be swayed to side with the workers in the cases.\n\nBut Gorsuch also suggested that a decision in favor of the workers could lead to \u201cmassive social upheaval.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration weighed in against the workers in the sexual orientation cases, arguing that the language of Title VII does not cover gay and lesbian employees.\n\n\u201cThe issue is not whether Congress can or should prohibit employment discrimination because of sexual orientation,\u201d Solicitor General Noel Francisco told the justices. \u201cThe issue, rather, is whether it did so when it prohibited discrimination because of sex.\u201d\n\nLawyers for the fired workers argued that the court should interpret the language more broadly.\n\n\u201cOur argument was simple,\u201d David Cole, the ACLU\u2019s national legal director, told reporters after the hearing. \u201cThe argument is that when Congress passed Title VII they intended to make sex irrelevant to people's ability to succeed at work.\u201d\n\nCole also pushed back against Gorsuch\u2019s worry over the potential for social upheaval.\n\n\u201cThere were transgender lawyers in that courtroom, and the transgender men were following the men's dress code and using the men's restroom and the transgender women were following the women's dress code and using the women's restroom and the sky has not fallen,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nThe case has drawn the interest of large businesses, civil rights groups and labor organizations, all of whom largely backed the LGBT workers.\n\nTuesday\u2019s oral arguments were the first time the Supreme Court has grappled with questions over gay rights since Justice Anthony Kennedy retired last year. Kennedy, who was appointed under the Reagan administration, authored the majority decision on four major gay rights cases, including the 2015 decision legalizing gay marriage nationwide.\n\nUpdated at 2:46 p.m.", "description": "The Supreme Court appeared divided Tuesday as the justices heard oral arguments in a trio of cases that could decide whether gay and transgender people are protected under federal workplace discrimination laws.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/scotus_lgbtq_workers_100819gn11_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
