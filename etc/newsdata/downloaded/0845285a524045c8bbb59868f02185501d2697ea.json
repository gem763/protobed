Still, two key figures from the State Department were confirmed for depositions: Gordon Sondland , the United States ambassador to the European Union, on Tuesday, and Marie Yovanovitch , the former American ambassador to Ukraine, on Friday.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo missed a Friday deadline to produce documents, even as the State Department continues talks with the House.\n\nI asked my colleague Charlie Savage what was at stake here: \u201cIt was predictable that the Trump administration would balk at turning over the subpoenaed documents related to the Ukraine matter \u2014 including many internal White House communications that any administration would see as covered by executive privilege,\u201d he told me. \u201cBut the subpoena will likely also allow the House, if it chooses, to link an impeachment article about obstruction directly to the Ukraine scandal.\u201d\n\nMore on that note: The Miami Herald reported today that two Florida businessmen who helped connect Rudy Giuliani to Ukrainian politicians would not comply with a request for documents and depositions from the three House committees conducting the impeachment investigation.\n\nOver the weekend, we learned that a new whistle-blower with \u201cfirsthand knowledge\u201d has provided information related to President Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine. His lawyers are also representing the first whistle-blower, and say that both are now legally protected from retaliation.\n\n[Sign up here to get the Impeachment Briefing in your email inbox every weeknight.]\n\nThe State Department slow-roll\n\nI asked Lara Jakes, who covers the State Department, about Mr. Pompeo\u2019s delay tacticsin the impeachment investigation. She got back to me from a busy press room, just after she finished some reporting on Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to pull back from military involvement in Syria.\n\nLara, we seem to have hit a stalling point in witness depositions. What recourse do Mr. Pompeo and the State Department have at this point? Can he simply block these witnesses from testifying?\n\nIt\u2019s not that cut and dried. He hasn\u2019t said he won\u2019t let them take part. He\u2019s said he wants them to have time to consult with administration lawyers. He accused Democrats of going straight to the diplomats and asking them to talk to investigators without the State Department\u2019s knowing or approving of it. In some cases, the administration might claim some executive privilege to prevent some employees from testifying. Mr. Pompeo also could be called as a witness. He was on the call with Trump and the Ukrainian president.", "description": "The House has issued more subpoenas and a second person is now being protected as a whistle-blower.", "authors": ["Noah Weiland"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/07/us/politics/00dc-impeach-briefing/00dc-impeach-briefing-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
