At The DNC: General Feeling Is That Trump Is Just Killing Them On All Fronts", "url": "https://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2019/08/28/panic-at-the-dnc-general-feeling-is-that-trump-is-just-killing-them-on-all-fron-n2552312", "language": "en", "published_at": "2019-08-28", "downloaded_at": "2019-09-02 07:13:34.823412+00:00", "text": "President Trump calls them suppression polls, the endless surveys the liberal media puts out there showing how the support for this administration is in the toilet. It\u2019s meant to demoralize his base. It didn\u2019t work in 2016 and it won\u2019t work in 2020. The polls were wrong. Right now, 2020 general election polling is trash. It\u2019s worthless. It\u2019s way too early. Everyone knows that\u2014and even some Democrats would admit that they\u2019re not going to win by a nine-point of double-digit margin next year. If anything, the media just reminds Trump voters that they need to vote next year. In the meantime, the Democratic Party has a three-way race at the top for the 2020 nomination between former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Sen. Bernie Sanders. There are at least a dozen more running and still\u2014anything can happen. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) had a strong showing in the first round of debates. She gained attention, and then some looked at her record. She has dropped 12 points in the latest Democratic candidate polls.\n\nBiden has been bashed; he\u2019s a gaffe machine right now. President Obama\u2019s record was also torched during the second rounds of debates on CNN, which raised eyebrows. Beating up the most popular Democrat in recent memory will get you the nomination? Nope. As the Left continues to slash, punch, stab, and shoot one another in the primaries, the Trump White House has been running what is essentially a general election campaign. The war chests are being stuffed, the RNC is raking in cash, and he\u2019s holding rallies in key swing states. Yes, this is what Obama did in 2012\u2014and Democrats know it. Members of the Democratic National Committee spoke with The Daily Beast who voiced their concerns. Panic could be aptly applied to what they said, especially about how there\u2019s a feeling that Trump is beating them on all fronts. There\u2019s also some frustration about chair Tom Perez continuing to ignore Rust Belt voters. Overall, it\u2019s this fear that the Trump team is already reaching swing voters, while the Democrats are just content with their base (via Daily Beast):\n\nJim Zogby, who co-chairs the DNC\u2019s ethnic counsel, a group that represents people across different ethnic, racial, national origin, and religious identities, says he has been pushing Perez and other party leaders to expand its outreach to voters in the same areas that Trump successfully captured: Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and\u2014a Democratic sore spot in post-2016 politics\u2014Wisconsin. But that outreach to the committee has fallen on deaf ears. \u201cIn Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, if we do events in those states that focuses on everyone else but them, that breeds resentment,\u201d Zogby said. \u201cThat\u2019s why [former Vice President Joe] Biden and [Sen.] Bernie [Sanders I-VT] do well, because they talk to those folks.\u201d Zogby was specifically referencing voters from Irish, Italian, Polish, Eastern Central European, Arab, and Armenian-American communities highly concentrated in the Midwest. \u201cI am frustrated beyond belief at the sheer neglect of the constituencies I represent,\u201d he added. Zogby\u2019s chief concern\u2014raised by several other current DNC members who spoke with The Daily Beast\u2014is that the Trump campaign is already reaching swing voters while the Democratic Party is overwhelmingly focused on expanding their existing base. [\u2026] \"Donald Trump is in general election mode while we\u2019re still in primary mode. We see it in Ohio,\u201d David Pepper, who chairs the state\u2019s Democratic Party said. \u201cHe\u2019s absolutely carpet-bombing Ohio online. We\u2019re doing our best to respond.\u201d [\u2026] \u2026a DNC official directly familiar with battleground states\u2019 efforts suggested all the messaging hasn\u2019t trickled down to much action on the ground level yet. \u201cThere\u2019s some deep concerns brewing under the surface. Nothing that\u2019s spilled into the public yet,\u201d the member said. \u201cWhere\u2019s all the support? They keep talking about the calories coming. People generally are feeling Trump is beating us on all fronts right now.\u201d The national party\u2019s fundraising woes continue to present a problem when up against the Republican National Committee and the Trump campaign\u2019s significant advantage, multiple members said. \u201cThe DNC is cash-strapped right now,\u201d one member said plainly. In June, the Republican National Committee more than doubled the DNC\u2019s fundraising haul, totaling $20.7 million to $8.5 million, respectively.\n\nNow, that\u2019s good news, but Trump and his team cannot let up. Keep doing what you\u2019re doing. Democrats are motivated. They want to boot him from office. Yet, the GOP has an awesome opportunity to define the Democratic Party and their 2020 nominee eons before they can. Given the debates thus far, they\u2019re a party that supports gun confiscation, more taxes, more regulations, taxpayer-funded abortion virtually up until the moment of birth, health care for illegal aliens, open borders, and the destruction of private health insurance; that\u2019s the only way that Medicare for All can work. The issue where they dominated the GOP in terms of trust with voters\u2014health care\u2014could have been a lethal tool in the 2020 messaging wars. Now, that\u2019s dead. It\u2019s a debate about whether to nuke 100+ million employer-based health plans now or later, with the added bonus of instituting the mother of all tax increases for the middle class to help pay for it. Trump has 3+ million jobs, economic growth, bigger paychecks, lower taxes, less regulation, and small business and consumer confidence levels reaching their highest marks in years. It\u2019s not a hard choice next year.", "description": ".09/02/2019 3:09:50AM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/238/8f38c309-c338-417a-8f54-fa880fa361de.png"}
