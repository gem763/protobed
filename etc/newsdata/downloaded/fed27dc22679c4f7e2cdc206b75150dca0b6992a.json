Meanwhile Republicans, including US President Donald Trump, regularly accuse the social network of censoring conservative voices.", "description": "The California-based firm will not fact-check the statements politicians post to the site, the social network announced ahead of the US 2020 elections.", "authors": ["Joe Pinkstone For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/25/07/wire-18903408-1569392832-581_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
