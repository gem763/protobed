Cory A. Booker on Wednesday said President Trump can be easily ousted from office as long as Democrats stay unified and can excite people ahead of the 2020 elections.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump got less votes than Mitt Romney,\u201d the New Jersey Democrat said on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cWe could shellack this sitting president [in] the 2020 elections if we stay unified and can engage and excite Democrats and, frankly, independents and moderate Republicans who all know that this is a president engaged in outrageous moral vandalism.\u201d\n\nMr. Booker, who has campaigned on a theme of \u201cradical love,\u201d said the country needs \u201chealing\u201d right now.\n\n\u201cDistinguishing our differences is really valuable and important, but demeaning or degrading the character of someone on the stage - that, to me, is unacceptable,\u201d he said.\n\nHe had also cautioned his fellow Democrats from going after one another too aggressively at Tuesday\u2019s debate.\n\nBut in contrast to Mr. Booker\u2019s wishes, the candidates did exchange some pointed blows.\n\nMayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, told Beto O\u2019Rourke that he didn\u2019t need lessons from the former Texas congressman on courage when the two were talking about Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s mandatory gun buyback proposal.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who has risen to the top of the field in some recent polling, also took incoming fire and faced questions on how she would pay for her universal health care proposal from candidates like Mr. Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC. Click here for reprint permission.", "description": "Sen. Cory A.
