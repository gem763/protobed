His contribution to the history of our nation and continent will never be forgotten.\u201d\n\nSOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT CYRIL RAMAPHOSA\n\n\u201cSouth Africans join the people and government of Zimbabwe in mourning the passing of a liberation fighter and champion of Africa\u2019s cause against colonialism.\n\n\u201cUnder President Mugabe\u2019s leadership, Zimbabwe\u2019s sustained and valiant struggle against colonialism inspired our own struggle against apartheid and built in us the hope that one day South Africa too would be free.\n\n\u201cDuring the decades of our own struggle, Zimbabwe\u2019s liberation movement supported our own liberation movement to fight oppression on multiple fronts. After Zimbabwe achieved independence, the apartheid state brutalised and violated Zimbabwe as punishment for supporting our own struggle.\n\n\u201cMany Zimbabweans paid with their lives so that we could be free. We will never forget or dishonour this sacrifice and solidarity.\u201d\n\nZIMBABWEAN OPPOSITION SENATOR AND RIGHTS LAWYER DAVID COLTART, ON TWITTER\n\n\u201cHe was a colossus on the Zimbabwean stage & his enduring positive legacy will be his role in ending white minority rule & expanding a quality education to all Zimbabweans.\u201d\n\nNELSON CHAMISA, LEADER OF ZIMBABWE\u2019S MAIN OPPOSITION PARTY THE MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE, ON TWITTER\n\n\u201cMy condolences to the Mugabe family and Africa for the passing on of Zimbabwe\u2019s founding President. This is a dark moment for the family because a giant among them has fallen. May the lord comfort them.\n\n\u201cEven though I and our party, the MDC, and the Zimbabwean people had great political differences with the late former President during his tenure in office, and disagreed for decades, we recognise his contribution made during his lifetime as a nation\u2019s founding President.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much to say for a life of 95 years and national leadership spanning over 37 years but in the true spirit of Ubuntu, we would like to give this moment to mourning but there will be time for greater reflection.\u201d\n\nJULIUS MALEMA, LEADER OF RADICAL LEFT SOUTH AFRICAN OPPOSITION PARTY THE ECONOMIC FREEDOM FIGHTERS, ON TWITTER\n\n\u201cI\u2019m saddened by the passing of our martyr & giant of the African Revolution (comrade) President Robert Mugabe. Let\u2019s continue to fight & protect his legacy.

There is no doubt you were an African icon, a statesman of a rare character and a revolutionary.\u201d\n\nMPHO BALOPI, SECRETARY GENERAL, BOTSWANA DEMOCRATIC PARTY\n\n\u201cCde Mugabe was one of Africa\u2019s most renowned freedom fighters and also one of the founding fathers of what is today known as SADC (the intergovernmental Southern African Development Community, whose headquarters are in Botswana).\n\n\u201cThe history of our respective parties\u2019 fraternal relations would be incomplete without mention of Uncle Bob, as he was affectionately known. It is beyond any doubt that he leaves an indelible mark on the politics of the region.\u201d\n\nZAMBIAN RULING PARTY THE PATRIOTIC FRONT QUOTES PRESIDENT EDGAR LUNGU IN A FACEBOOK POST\n\n\u201cI am saddened at the passing of a Pan-Africanist, Zimbabwe\u2019s founding father and former President, Cde Robert Mugabe.\n\n\u201cHe will be remembered for his fight for Africa\u2019s liberation and standing up to fearlessly defend a continent he loved ...
