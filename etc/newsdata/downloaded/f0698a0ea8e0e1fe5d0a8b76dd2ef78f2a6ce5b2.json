The three bills include a measure offering grants to states to set up \u201cred flag\u201d laws, a prohibition on gun ownership for those convicted of misdemeanor hate crimes, and a ban on magazines that can hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition. Later this month the House Judiciary Committee is also expected to pass a sweeping ban on semi-automatic firearms and magazines over 10 rounds.\n\nThe additional gun control measures passed by the House are meant to apply pressure to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who said gun control would be \u201cfront and center\u201d when the Senate returned, but has since said he won\u2019t bring any gun bill to the floor that won\u2019t be signed by President Donald Trump. On Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said McConnell\u2019s inaction has led to the deaths of Americans.\n\n\u201cWe passed our bill in February. Don\u2019t ask me what we haven\u2019t done \u2014 we have done it. And if you are annoyed with my impatience, it\u2019s because people are dying, (and) Sen. McConnell hasn\u2019t acted. Why don\u2019t you go ask him if he has any regrets for all the people who died because he hasn\u2019t?\u201d\n\nI\u2019m surprised she didn\u2019t call McConnell a domestic terrorist. I thought that was the go-to insult for San Francisco politicians these days.\n\nMeanwhile, President Trump met with Republican lawmakers to talk about a number of ideas, but it sounds like there\u2019s still no definitive plan that Trump has agreed to support.\n\nAfter the meeting, Rep. Steve Scalise, one of four lawmakers who attended the gathering, said it was a \u201cgeneral discussion just about a lot of different ideas,\u201d including everything from more data being provided to the national background check system to so-called \u201cred-flag\u201d proposals, measures that seek to bar guns from those who may cause harm to themselves or others. But Scalise, the House Minority Whip, did not provide specifics on what the president would actually support, nor did he provide a timeline of when any legislation could be taken up. \u201cThe President\u2019s been willing to meet with any members of Congress that are open to addressing real problems. But again, the real issue has to be focused on solving problems that have caused some of these shootings to happen as opposed to the approach some people want to take,\u201d Scalise said. \u201cThere are many people that are trying to take advantage of these crises just to promote their own gun-control agenda that\u2019s not focused as much on mass shootings as it is on law-abiding citizens.\u201d\n\nOther Republicans, like Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, are becoming increasingly vocal about the lack of specifics coming out of the White House.\n\nAt Senate Republicans\u2019 weekly lunch on Tuesday, White House legislative aide Eric Ueland told senators that the administration was working on a proposal, but did not lay out what the administration was on board with, nor the priorities in tackling the issue. \u201cWe\u2019d like to know where the president is,\u201d Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, said after the lunch. \u201cWe would like to have the president provide a line-by-line, \u2018this is what I would support\u2019 direction to us, in which case, we\u2019d be able to create a law.\u201d Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla. said no guidance from the White House was given throughout the lunch. \u201cEverybody is talking about a lot of different things,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to know where the White House is.\u201d\n\nWhere the White House is is between a rock and a hard place, frankly. Trump\u2019s base is in no mood to compromise or support gun control measures, particularly when they\u2019re a combination of ineffective, unenforceable, and unconstitutional. But Trump has said he\u2019s going to \u201cdo something\u201d, so now he has to come up with something that won\u2019t tick off a good chunk of his base as we move deeper into the 2020 election cycle.\n\nIf Trump is really serious about making a deal that his base will support, they\u2019re going to have to get something out of it. Simply adopting the least bad gun control proposal isn\u2019t going to do anything to endear him to the voters he needs next November, but it doesn\u2019t appear that the White House is even looking in that direction. Instead, the indications are they\u2019re looking for that least bad proposal, but haven\u2019t settled on anything. In the meantime, House Democrats have plenty of really bad proposals they\u2019re sending over to the U.S. Senate, and they\u2019re not done yet.", "description": "House Democrats advanced three gun control measures on Tuesday, including a ban on common ammunition magazines and a red flag proposal.", "authors": ["Cam Edwards", "Author'S Bio", "Cam Edwards Has Covered The Amendment For More Than Years As A Broadcast", "Online Journalist", "As Well As The Co-Author Of", "Heavy Lifting", "Grow Up", "Get A Job", "Start A Family", "Other Manly Advice"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/232/d879d6fd-7637-42ad-84ac-0e372bcaac3d.png", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
