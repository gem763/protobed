That followed earlier data showing a moderation in job growth and services sector activity.\n\nStill, hopes of a potential U.S.-China trade deal helped offset oil prices losses after Mnuchin said U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators are working on nailing down a Phase 1 trade deal text for their presidents to sign next month.\n\n\"Overall, we are seeing a more constructive picture both in terms of the demand side of the equation with the partial agreement from the U.S. (and) also from a technical point of view. (Prices) are at close to the bottom end of trading range rather than the top,\" said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at brokerage CMC Markets in Sydney.\n\nBut short-term pressure on oil prices will likely remain until U.S. government data on oil inventory is out later on Thursday, he added.", "description": "Oil prices eased on Thursday after industry data showed a larger-than-expected build-up in stocks in the United States, although losses were limited by comments by U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on a U.S.-China trade deal.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105689778-1548053936803gettyimages-938201508.jpeg?v=1571279225", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
