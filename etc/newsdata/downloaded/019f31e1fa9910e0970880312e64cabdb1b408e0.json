This has led many to expand and switch up what they do; Instagram, for example, has come along way since it started as a simple grid of pretty pictures.\n\nYou\u2019ve now got stories (a feature inspired by Snapchat), DMs (thanks to Facebook messenger, presumably, since Mark Zuckerberg now owns this platform too) and Close Friends: a space for us to call out people who piss us off and post scandalous photos of ourselves, safe in the knowledge that those watching won\u2019t judge us like the masses on the main.\n\nSo what could possibly be left for IG to jump on these days? Enter their latest venture, \u2018Threads\u2019: an expanded version of the Close Friends feature that offers users the chance to sacrifice just about every ounce of privacy they have. Announced by The Verge and likely inspired by Snapchat\u2019s \u2018Maps\u2019 feature -- a world atlas showing the realtime and exact locations of your friends -- \u2018Threads\u2019 will offer people an uninterrupted look at your life. Including where you live.\n\nNot only that, but when you up sticks and get on the tube, or go to work, or head to that late night hook-up\u2019s house on the DL, the app will list you as being \u2018On the move\u2019, so everyone knows where you are at all times. Dystopian!\n\nYou can do the standard messaging, phone calls and sending photos through it too though, since Mark Zuckerberg (who also owns WhatsApp, btw) sees it as the future of the company. But there\u2019s also the added bonus of being able to send the status of your battery life to friends -- a feature that may well consume more battery life than messaging your mate \u201cI\u2019m on five percent\u201d anyway. Think of this whole thing as a \u2018Close Friends\u2019 lab experiment gone a bit insane.\n\nHowever disturbing you find the prospect, \u2018Threads\u2019 will be available on your preferred app store in the very near future.", "description": "And it all sounds a bit dystopian.", "authors": ["Talia Slonim", "David Gilbert", "Meera Navlakha"], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d67aaa6638f8a0008be0eed/lede/1567075803197-1565803851712-Instahappiness_Header.jpeg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*"}
