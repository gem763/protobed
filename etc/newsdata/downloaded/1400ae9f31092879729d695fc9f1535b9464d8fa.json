Mr Sanders and the other two front-runners in the Democratic field are all in their 70s, as is Donald Trump.\n\nMr Sanders wouldn't be the only politician in American history to be elected president after heart problems, however.\n\nDwight Eisenhower was notably re-elected after a heart attack in 1955. Mr Eisenhower at the time enjoyed a booming economy, few international crises to worry the American public, and an approval rating of 79 per cent.\n\nMr Trump has also been the focus of some speculation about the condition of his heart, too. While he has not been reported to have had a heart attack, Mr Trump's medical examinations have caused some concern, with CNN's Sanjay Gupta insisting last year that the president's physical results show he has heart disease.\n\nFormer vice president Dick Cheney, who served under George W Bush, was also well known for having had multiple heart attacks.", "description": "Bernie Sanders was taken to the hospital with chest pains before having surgery to combat a blocked artery, his campaign has announced.
