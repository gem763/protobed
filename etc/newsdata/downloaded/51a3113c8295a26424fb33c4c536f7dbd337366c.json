Should those convicted of crimes continue to earn money from their intellectual property?\n\nAccording to the Sun, the two-minute use of Gary Glitter\u2019s 1972 track Rock and Roll Part 2 in a key scene in Joker, which falls under a synchronisation licence, could make the convicted paedophile \u201chundreds of thousands of pounds\u201d. He will make money, but perhaps not to the extent that is being presumed.\n\nTwo sets of rights have to be cleared and paid for here \u2013 one covering the sound recording and another for the publishing/song composition.\n\n\u201cThe local company [that placed it in the film] will retain maybe 20% to 30% of the fee,\u201d says a music lawyer and synchronisation expert, who has asked to remain anonymous. \u201cOf the remainder, the local record company in the UK might take 60%. So Glitter could get maybe 30% of the fee on the recorded side and probably less on the publishing, because it is a co-write [with Mike Leander] and because the publisher is also taking a cut.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Singer Gary Glitter, a convicted paedophile. Photograph: Will Oliver/EPA\n\nThe financials are more convoluted than the red-top headlines suggest, but they are nothing compared with the ethical conundrum.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really the job of the music supervisor to do the due diligence on it,\u201d says Cliff Fluet, a partner at the law firm Lewis Silkin. \u201cIn the US, they would literally have no idea, or indeed care, about Gary Glitter.\u201d\n\nThe song has different contextual associations in the US, having long been used in sports games, [known colloquially as The \u201cHey!\u201d Song due to its chant] to gee up spectators. It is far removed from its association in the UK with a convicted paedophile.\n\nFor record companies and publishers there is likely to be a blunt business decision underpinning it all. But should those convicted of crimes continue to earn money from their intellectual property? Simply put, copyright does not end if someone serves time. Phil Spector, a convicted murderer, continues to make money from River Deep \u2013 Mountain High and Be My Baby, while Glitter continues to make money from Hello by Oasis, due to its referencing of Hello! Hello! I\u2019m Back Again.\n\nOne cannot presume this is news to the Joker team. Someone along the licensing chain should have sent up a red flag. How they morally square all this with Glitter getting any money is down to them. But, ultimately, expecting Hollywood or the music industry to prize ethics over earnings reveals a shaky understanding of the history of both.", "description": "The convicted paedophile could profit from the use of one of his tracks.
