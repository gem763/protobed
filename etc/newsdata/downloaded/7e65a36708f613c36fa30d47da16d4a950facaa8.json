Lamar is going pretty well, and Kyler is off to a good start.\u201d\n\nMurray, the 2018 Heisman Trophy winner, threw for 308 yards in his debut against Detroit last week. He erased an 18-point, fourth-quarter deficit to salvage a tie, and for an encore threw for 349 yards against Baltimore.\n\nYet, he\u2019s still in search of his first NFL win.\n\n\u201cEvery week is going to be a learning experience for the rookie quarterback,\u201d coach Kliff Kingsbury said. \u201cFirst start on the road \u2026 He kept us in the game with a bunch of plays.\u201d\n\nJackson, on the other hand, has guided Baltimore to a 2-0 start. In his favor: One valuable year of NFL experience.\n\n\u201cKyler Murray is an offensive threat,\u201d said Arizona receiver Michael Crabtree, who like Suggs played with Baltimore last year. \u201cThis is his second game in the NFL, this is Lamar\u2019s second year. It\u2019s hard to compare them.\u201d\n\nDespite joining Cam Newton as the only NFL quarterbacks to throw for 300 yards in each of their first two games, Murray lamented not being able to finish off drives and indicated that settling for field goals instead of touchdowns left an unpleasant taste in his mouth.\n\nMurray drove the Cardinals to the Baltimore 3-yard line in the first quarter and to the 4 in the second quarter. Had Arizona converted a touchdown on either possession, the game might have played out differently.\n\n\u201cWe were able to move the ball pretty well,\u201d Murray said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got to start finishing drives. We had too many field goals. Moving forward, we can\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\nEven the 300-yard game and being alongside Newton in the record books didn\u2019t seem to impress the rookie, who was drafted No. 1 overall out of Oklahoma after ditching a promising baseball career.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really cool, but I wish we could have won the game,\u201d Murray said.\n\nSuggs, meanwhile, was limited to three tackles and no sacks in his emotional return to the city where he played 16 years before opting to play Year 17 with his hometown team.\n\n\u201cIt was bittersweet,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was good to be back and great to play in the stadium where I played most of my career. I really wanted to win.\u201d\n\nBefore and after the game, there were hugs aplenty between the Ravens\u2019 career sack leader and his former teammates.\n\n\u201cI wanted to come in here and make some big plays, and I wanted to win,\u201d Suggs said. \u201cBut they\u2019re a tough team.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Playing for the Ravens last season, Arizona Cardinals linebacker Terrell Suggs had an up-close view of rookie quarterback Lamar Jackson's on-the-job training.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "David Ginsburg"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/15/cardinals_ravens_football_11351_c0-184-4406-2752_s1770x1032.jpg?1318512dac850fe6fbaa4362709569c9f2e4726b", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
