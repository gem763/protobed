On Friday, he candidly told a reporter that those Marvel movies may be very popular, but they're not very good.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see them. I tried, you know? But that\u2019s not cinema. Honestly, the closest I can think of them, as well made as they are, with actors doing the best they can under the circumstances, is theme parks. It isn\u2019t the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being.\u201d (Screen Rant)\n\nThat last part is debatable. All of the Marvel films, I'd argue, are more than just fist fights and explosions. They dig into the soul of the superhero. Love, friendship, and humanity feature in all of the movies, particularly in the final, heartbreaking chapter in the Avengers franchise, Avengers: Endgame. That scene between Black Widow and Hawkeye alone left the audience in a glass case of emotion. It's a real tearjerker.\n\nA theme park can't do that!\n\nOther Marvel fans jumped to the franchise's defense.\n\nJust because the characters happen to have super powers doesn't make the stories told less valuable then others. \u2014 JPhilm38 (@JPhilm38) October 4, 2019\n\nWilling to bet a lot of this sort of sentiment from filmmakers like Scorsese is coming from their films being crowded out of cinemas/theatrical audiences by the 'theme park' films...but lashing out at a genre isn't the way to go about it. https://t.co/QCeDzNHnJJ \u2014 Anton Volkov @ LFF (@antovolk) October 4, 2019\n\nBut who are we to argue with Scorcese, a wildly accomplished director? Especially one who may have another Oscar winner on his hands with his anticipated new film The Irishman.\n\nPerhaps Guardians of the Galaxy director James Gunn has more grounds to respond to Scorcese's missive against Marvel. As you can imagine, he was not amused that his fellow filmmaker had diminished his art.\n\nMartin Scorsese is one of my 5 favorite living filmmakers. I was outraged when people picketed The Last Temptation of Christ without having seen the film. I\u2019m saddened that he\u2019s now judging my films in the same way. https://t.co/hzHp8x4Aj8 \u2014 James Gunn (@JamesGunn) October 4, 2019\n\nOf course, as mentioned, the Marvel Universe is wildly popular. Avengers: Endgame blasted past Avatar this year to become the highest-grossing movie of all time.", "description": "You probably won't see Oscar winning filmmaker Martin Scorcese sitting .10/04/2019 19:45:31PM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Matt Vespa", "Beth Baumann", "Julio Rosas"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/277/30643e88-fee9-45ab-87f6-1971b34e37de.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
