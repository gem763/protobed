From the first day I entered the political arena, I made it clear that I did not want to fight these endless, senseless wars\u2014especially those that don\u2019t benefit the United States. Turkey has committed to protecting civilians, protecting religious minorities, including Christians, and ensuring no humanitarian crisis takes place\u2014and we will hold them to this commitment,' he said.\n\n'In addition, Turkey is now responsible for ensuring all ISIS fighters being held captive remain in prison and that ISIS does not reconstitute in any way, shape, or form. We expect Turkey to abide by all of its commitments, and we continue to monitor the situation closely,' he argued.\n\nDonald Trump said Wednesday that he is 'slowly and carefully' bringing American soldiers home from the Middle East, ending U.S. involvement in the 'worst' mistake in American history and 19 years of war\n\nTrump told his detractors that culling bloodshed by U.S. soldiers is the 'BIG PICTURE.' He said it's up to regional forces, now, to kill, capture and prosecute the remaining terrorists\n\nTurkish soldiers stand guard at Akcakale, on the Turkish side of the border, a short distance from Tell Abaid in Syria on Oct. 9 amid reports that a small force has moved into the country\n\nMISSION ACCOMPLISHED: In this May 1, 2003 file photo, President Bush gives a 'thumbs-up' sign after declaring the end of major combat in Iraq as he speaks aboard the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln off the California coast\n\nPresident Barack Obama in a meeting with US top general in Iraq Ray Odierno (C) and National Security Advisor James Jones (L), during a visit to Camp Victory in Iraq on April 7, 2009. Obama said on a surprise visit to Iraq that the next 18 months could be critical' and told the war-torn country that it would soon have to look after itself\n\nThe president told his detractors in morning tweets that culling bloodshed by U.S. soldiers is the 'BIG PICTURE.' He said it's up to regional forces, now, to kill, capture and prosecute the remaining terrorists.\n\nTrump said in tweets that he is 'slowly and carefully' bringing soldiers home from the Middle East, quitting U.S. involvement in what he described as the 'worst' mistake in the nation's history and winding down nearly two decades of American warfare.\n\nHe declared in cap-filled tweets: 'USA should never have been in Middle East.'\n\n'The United States has spent EIGHT TRILLION DOLLARS fighting and policing in the Middle East. Thousands of our Great Soldiers have died or been badly wounded. Millions of people have died on the other side. GOING INTO THE MIDDLE EAST IS THE WORST DECISION EVER MADE IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY!' he said.\n\nTrump suggested that Republican predecessor George W. Bush, whose military invaded Iraq based on bad intelligence, was responsible for entangling the United States in a regional quagmire that has resulted in more 50,000 American casualties since 2001.\n\n'We went to war under a false & now disproven premise, WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. There were NONE! Now we are slowly & carefully bringing our great soldiers & military home. Our focus is on the BIG PICTURE! THE USA IS GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE!' he proclaimed.\n\nTrump said that religious clashes in the Middle East will never be resolved by an American military presence.\n\n'Fighting between various groups that has been going on for hundreds of years. USA should never have been in Middle East. Moved our 50 soldiers out. Turkey MUST take over captured ISIS fighters that Europe refused to have returned. The stupid endless wars, for us, are ending!' he stated.\n\nTrump's tweets came as Turkey prepared to enter northern Syria. Tanks, trucks, troops and supplies were pictured amassing on the border overnight.\n\nErdo\u011fan announced shortly after 9 am EDT that the operation had begun.\n\nKurdish commanders had warned of an 'impending humanitarian disaster' if the assault went ahead. They begged world leaders to intervene and called on civilians to join the military and 'do your duty.'\n\nA statement issued by the SDF on Wednesday said: 'The border areas of northeast Syria are on the edge of a possible humanitarian catastrophe.\n\n'All indications, field information and military build-up on the Turkish side of the border indicate that our border areas will be attacked by Turkey in cooperation with Syrian opposition tied to Turkey,' the warning said. 'This attack will spill the blood of thousands of innocent civilians because our border areas are overcrowded.\n\nTrump defiantly issued an invitation to Erdogan to meet with him at the White House in November 13 on Tuesday morning after senior Republican senators, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham, the president's golf companion, strongly criticized his troop pullout announcement.\n\nGraham said Wednesday morning that 'a disaster is in the making,' if Turkey has entered Syria, as news reports indicate. He said he would 'lead effort in Congress to make Erdogan pay a heavy price' for the incursion.\n\n'Pray for our Kurdish allies who have been shamelessly abandoned by the Trump Administration. This move ensures the reemergence of ISIS,' he tweeted. 'I urge President Trump to change course while there is still time by going back to the safe zone concept that was working.'\n\nThe South Carolina senator chairs the Judiciary Committee but has long been considered a leading voice on American foreign policy.\n\nTrump golf buddy Lindsey Graham, a leading voice in American foreign policy, urged the president to reverse course\n\nGOP senators like Mitt Romney, Homeland Security Chair Ron Johnson, Energy Committee Chair Lisa Murkowski accused Trump of 'betraying' and 'abandoning' the Kurds in Syria to no avail.\n\nRep. Kevin McCarthy, the highest ranking Republican in the House of Representatives, also advised, 'A Turkish military advance into Syria threatens to halt momentum against ISIS, directly assaults our SDF partners, and could give the likes of al-Qaeda and Iran new footholds in the region. Turkey should stop immediately and continue to work with the US to secure the region.'\n\nHouse Republican Conference Chair Liz Cheney directly rebuked Trump for the situation she described as 'sickening' and an ambush on the Kurds that will create space for Russia and ISIS to attack.\n\n'Impossible to understand why [Donald Trump] is leaving America\u2019s allies to be slaughtered and enabling the return of ISIS,' she said in a tweet, tagging the president.\n\nAnti-war GOP Sen. Rand Paul was one of a handful of Republican lawmakers to openly hail Trump's decision.\n\n'President Trump should be applauded for putting America first! I support bringing our troops home from endless wars in the Middle East!' he said on Tuesday evening.\n\nTrump has offered varying justifications for the immediate withdrawal of American troops from Syria, including his desire to save American lives and money.\n\nHe indicated Monday that the letters he writes to the families of the deceased as commander in chief have affected him deeply.\n\n'And, you know, I have to sign letters often to parents of young soldiers that were killed. And it\u2019s the hardest thing I have to do in this job. I hate it. I hate it. Afghanistan. I signed one the other day \u2014 Iraq, Syria. They get blown up by mines. They get taken out by a sniper. And I have to write letters to people. And we make each letter different,' he said.\n\nTrump explained, 'Each person is different. And we make them personal. But no matter what you do, it\u2019s devastating. The parents will never be the same. The families will never be the same. People are killed. Many people are still being killed. It\u2019s going to go on that way for perhaps a long time.'\n\nHe on Tuesday painted the Turks as a benign American partner and NATO ally that could be trusted, as he defended himself in tweet.\n\n'So many people conveniently forget that Turkey is a big trading partner of the United States, in fact they make the structural steel frame for our F-35 Fighter Jet,' he tweeted.\n\n'They have also been good to deal with, helping me to save many lives at Idlib Province, and returning, in very good health, at my request, Pastor Brunson, who had many years of a long prison term remaining. Also remember, and importantly, that Turkey is an important member in good standing of NATO. He is coming to the U.S. as my guest on November 13th. #ENDENDLESSWARS'\n\nSoldiers patrol the border ahead of an anticipated attack to extend Turkish control of more of northern Syria, a large swath of which is currently held by Syrian Kurds, whom Turkey regards as a threat\n\nA wall separating Turkey from Syria is seen behind a Turkish soldier who stands guard in Akcakale, close to where an expeditionary force is said to have crossed into Syria early on Wednesday\n\nVehicles carrying the members of Free Syrian Army, a Turkish-backed rebel group, patrol in the Turkish side of the border between Turkey and Syria Wednesday\n\nTwo small expeditionary forces of Turkish troops moved into northern Syria on Wednesday morning, an official claimed, ahead of a much larger invasion (pictured, a tank near the border overnight)\n\nThe SDF begged world leaders for help to avoid 'thousands of innocent civilians' being killed as Turkey prepared for a wide-scale invasion (pictured, troops on the Turkish side of the border)\n\nA Turkish officer sits atop this tank as it movers to its new position on the Turkish side of the border between Turkey and Syria\n\nA truck carrying two armoured vehicles makes its way towards the border crossing between Turkey and Syria overnight\n\nTurkey has said President Trump gave assurances to President Erdogan during a phone call that security in Syria would be fully handed over to their control\n\nMany Syrians displaced by fighting elsewhere in the country have fled to the Aleppo region, in hopes of seeking shelter there.\n\nAccording to data collected by Global Shelter Cluster, which is leading relief efforts in Syria, there are currently some 600,000 people receiving aid in Aleppo - of which 140,000 are almost entirely reliant on aid for survival.\n\nAleppo is also where the majority of the initial fighting is expected to take place.\n\nTurkey has announced plans to create a 'peace corridor' along its border with Syria by wiping out 'terrorists,' which it defines as the SDF.\n\nFahrettin Altun, spokesman for the Turkish government, said Tuesday night that the operation would begin 'shortly' and ordered SDF units to stand aside.\n\n'The Turkish military, together with the Free Syrian Army, will cross the Turkish-Syrian border shortly,' he tweeted.\n\nTurkish Army's armored military vehicles and heavy duty machines are being dispatched to the Syrian border ahead of Turkey's planned operation\n\nLocal residents jeer and applaud as a convoy of Turkish forces vehicles and trucks carrying tanks and armoured personnel carriers is driven towards the Syrian border\n\nTurkish army soldiers drive towards the border with Syria near Akcakale in Sanliurfa province overnight Tuesday\n\nA Turkish army's tank drives down from a truck as Turkish armed forces drive towards the border with Syria\n\nTurkish Army's military vehicles and heavy duty machines are being dispatched to the Syrian border, and began crossing early Wednesday\n\nPrevious Turkish incursions into Syria By AFP Turkey has previously launched two operations into Syria - in 2016 and 2018 - to push back from its border Islamic State group jihadists and Kurdish militia fighters. Known as Euphrates Shield, Turkish artillery pound dozens of ISIS targets around the Syrian border town of Jarabulus, near the Euphrates river in the early hours of August 24, 2016. On February 24, 2017, the Turkish army announces it has taken control of the Syrian town of Al-Bab, the final objective of Euphrates Shield and the last IS bastion in Syria's northern Aleppo province. For Ankara, control of the town means it can establish a buffer between the different Kurdish-controlled territories in northern Syria, preventing them from uniting. On January 20, 2018, Turkey launches a major air and ground operation, dubbed Olive Branch, against the YPG in Syria's region of Afrin, about 30 kilometres from the border. The next day, Turkish tanks and soldiers enter the region. Ankara says it aims to create a security zone deep inside Syria. On March 18, Turkish forces and their Syrian auxiliaries oust the Kurdish militia from the town of Afrin and raise the Turkish flag.\n\n'YPG militants have two options: They can defect or we will have stop them from disrupting our counter-ISIS efforts.'\n\nAnkara says the creation of a safe zone will allow for the return of Syrian refugees in Turkey, and create greater regional stability.\n\nHowever, observers warn fresh conflict along the border will destabilise the region and likely lead to an ISIS resurgence as the SDF diverts forces to fight the Turks.\n\nOvernight the SDF reported three suicide bomb attacks in Raqqa, the defacto capital of ISIS's self-declared Caliphate, by sleeper cells which had activated in the city.\n\nEarly on Wednesday the group tweeted: 'Daesh takes advantage of Imminent Turkish invasion.\n\n'Three ISIS suicide bombings on our military positions in Raqqa, clashes still ongoing.'\n\nDaesh is a derogatory Arabic term for ISIS.\n\nWhile previous plans for a 'peace corridor' outlined by Erdogan at the United Nations called for it to extend 20 miles into Syrian territory, Altun suggested on Tuesday night that it could go far beyond this.\n\nIf Turkish forces were allowed to spread their reach to the Raqqa-Dier Ezzor line - he wrote in the Washington Post - then it would allow them to resettle some 3million refugees, including 1million currently in Europe.\n\nExtending Turkish control that far into Syria would mean taking control of almost all the territory that Kurdish forces now control.\n\nDescribing Kurdish fighters as 'armed thugs', Altun said their forces threaten the existence of the Turkish state, and must be eliminated.\n\nTurkey-backed members of Syrian National Army prepare for moving to Turkey for an expected military operation by Turkey into Kurdish areas of northern Syria\n\nTTurkey-backed members of Syrian National Army prepare for moving to Turkey for an expected military operation by Turkey into Kurdish areas of northern Syria, in Azas near Turkey border, Syria, on October 8\n\nTrump has faced a fierce political backlash after he agreed to withdraw US troops from Syria during a routine phone call with President Erdogan on Sunday.\n\nEfforts are now underway in Congress to block the troop withdrawal including from Senate Republicans led by Lindsay Graham.\n\nTweeting at Turkey's leadership on Tuesday night, he said: 'You do NOT have a green light to enter into northern Syria.\n\n'There is massive bipartisan opposition in Congress, which you should see as a red line you should not cross.'\n\nOf particular concern are prison camps holding some 15,000 ISIS fighters that would fall into Turkey's hands if it seizes border areas that the SDF currently controls, including the notorious Al-Hawl camp.\n\nWithin these camps are 2,500 foreign ISIS jihadis, largely from Europe, which Turkey would then become responsible for detaining.\n\nThere are fears that this would give Ankara leverage over European leaders and security on the continent, since Turkey is one of the primary routes for ISIS fighters returning to Europe.\n\nTrump has attempted to defend his position by saying that he will crash the Turkish economy in the event of any 'unforced or unnecessary fighting'.\n\nHe also denied abandoning the Kurds, pointing out that the country has a large Kurdish population - including a separatist which the government has been fighting against for decades.\n\nTurkey wants to create what it calls a 'safe zone' in a stretch of territory along its southern border with Syria that is currently controlled by Syrian Kurdish fighters, known as the People's Protection Units, or YPG.\n\nTurkey considers the YPG as terrorists affiliated with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, which has waged a 35-year-long battle against the Turkish state. Ankara also views the YPG-controlled zone as an 'existential threat.'\n\nErdogan has demanded a 'safe zone' that is 20 miles deep and stretches more than 300 miles toward the Iraqi border.\n\nDonald Trump has denied abandoning the Kurds and has threatened to crash Turkey's economy in the event of 'unforced or unnecessary fighting'\n\nHundreds of thousands of displaced Syrian civilians, including disabled veterans of the war against ISIS, currently live in SDF territory in northern Syria (pictured)\n\nDonald Trump has denied abandoning the Kurds after agreeing to hand over regional security to Turkey, but has been unable to provide concrete guarantees they will not be attacked\n\nKurdish forces led the fight against ISIS with support from an international coalition headed by the US, but are now facing the prospect of having that support suddenly withdrawn\n\nFighters and veterans from the Kurdish women's protection units (YPJ) and the people's protection units (YPG) march in Qamishli, which is one of the targets for the Turkish assault\n\nThe Syrian government - which the US has attempted to topple - has called on the Kurds (pictured) to switch allegiance to their side if America withdraws its support\n\nThere are almost 600,000 displaced people in northern Syria currently receiving aid, with the majority of those around Aleppo where early fighting would take place\n\nPresident Erdogan has outlined plans to create a 'peace corridor' in northern Syria in order to resettle some 2million refugees currently in Turkey\n\nHow Turkey's expected invasion of Syria would threaten the Kurds who defeated ISIS What is Turkey's troubled history with the Kurds? Turkey has historically treated the Kurds unsympathetically and has effectively made them 'mountain Turks' by driving them into the hilly areas around the south of the country. The founder of modern Turkey, Mustafa Kemal, better known as Atat\u00fcrk, pushed through a constitution 70 years ago which denied the existence of distinct cultural sub-groups in Turkey, which the Kurds fall under. Due to this, when the Kurds - along with other minorities in the country - express ethnic differences it has been repressed by the government. Up until 1991 the daily use of the Kurdish tongue was outlawed and seen as separatism, and even today any minor expression of Kurdish nationalism can lead to imprisonment. The government thwarts any effort by the Kurds to become political, with parties consistently shut down and party members often imprisoned for 'crimes of opinion'. The historical repression led to the creation of the PKK, an armed separatist movement, in 1984. Most Kurds in Turkey do not promote separatism from the Turkish state, but a large number back the PKK. Who are the Kurds? There are around 35million Kurds living in the hilly parts of Turkey, Iraq, Syria, Iran and Armenia - making them the fourth-largest ethnic group in the Middle East. Yet they do not have a permanent state. They do not have an official dialect but are part of a united community through race, culture and language. The Kurdish people are made up of a number of religions but they are mostly Sunni Muslims. The idea of a 'Kurdistan' came about in the 1900s following the fall of the Ottoman Empire after the First World War. The Treaty of Sevres among the Western nations in 1920 also made provision for one. But just three years later the Treaty of Lausanne overwrote this as it set the new boundaries for Turkey. There was no space for a Kurdistan and left them stranded as a minority community in other countries. Attempts over the rest of the 20th Century to bring about an independent state were dashed at every turn. What do they want? The Kurdish people make up around 10 per cent of the Syrian population and most lived in Damascus and Aleppo before uprisings started against President Bashar al-Assad in 2011. Despite this, they have never had basic rights and at least 300,000 have had citizenship requests denied since the 1960s. Land has also been consistently taken from them and given to Arabs in a bit to 'Arabize' the area. In 2011 when uprisings got underway, most Kurds did not publicly back a side, but from halfway through 2012 they seized the opportunity when government forces withdrew to fight rebels elsewhere. The main Kurdish parties, notably the Democratic Union Party in January 2014 announced the creation of 'autonomy' for the areas of Afrin, Kobane and Jazira. This escalated to a 'federal system' in March 2016 in Turmen and Arab areas snatched from ISIS. This, unsurprisingly, was turned down by Assad, as well as the country's official opposition and the Americans. The Democratic Union Party claims it is not looking for independence, but says there must be Kurdish legal rights and autonomy in any political end to the Syrian war. In government there has been a disparity, with Assad pledging to fight back for all of Syria, but his foreign minister hinting at possible talks with the Kurds in September 2017. What does Turkey want? Turkey wants a 'safe zone' in northern Syria - 30 kilometres deep and 300 miles wide - that would push the YPG away from its border. It says the buffer zone would also allow for the return of some of the 3.6 million Syrian refugees currently in Turkey, where anti-refugee sentiment is growing. The YPG spearheaded the fight on the ground against the Islamic State (IS) group as part of the Syrian Democratic Forces, with the support of the US-led international coalition. But Ankara says the YPG is a 'terrorist' offshoot of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has waged a bloody insurgency against the Turkish state since 1984. A victory for Erdogan? Since Erdogan has long pushed for the 'safe zone', the US move is 'absolutely' a victory for him, said Steven Cook, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. 'Erdogan has been working tirelessly to convince (US President Donald) Trump that the US should leave Syria so that Turkey can prosecute the fight against the YPG and resettle Syrians,' he said. The White House decision came after a phone call between Trump and Erdogan, demonstrating the Turkish leader's ability to convince his American counterpart despite resistance within the US administration. 'By giving the green light to Turkey to intervene, the United States has given the impression of having 'capitulated' with Turkish demands,' said Jana Jabbour, a Turkish foreign policy expert at Sciences Po in Paris. 'This in itself is a diplomatic victory for Erdogan,' she said. Challenges ahead? Turkey has launched two military operations supporting Syrian opposition fighters - in northern Syria against IS in 2016 and against the YPG in 2018. But a question remains over Turkey's ability in the air. During the offensive against the Kurdish enclave of Afrin in early 2018, Ankara needed Russia's permission for Turkish planes to take off. The latest plan is much bigger in scope - and more expensive. 'A new Syria operation will generate economic costs, and it is not certain that in the context of the current recession in Turkey the country has the means for such an operation,' Jabbour said. She also pointed to growing scepticism among the Turkish public towards Ankara's involvement in the 'Syrian chaos'. 'This is why Ankara would have preferred an agreement with the United States for the establishment of the safe zone on the border, a scenario which would have allowed Turkey to share the burden with Washington,' Jabbour said. How to manage IS? Turkey has another burden, as the White House said Ankara would now be responsible for IS fighters captured over the past two years and held in Kurdish detention centres. Trump, who has frequently urged European governments to repatriate jihadists from their countries, has now pushed the problem onto Turkey. Erdogan said Monday that Washington and Ankara would work on the issue together but he did not elaborate on the form of the eventual cooperation. 'Now Turkey has to confront IS, which shows every indication of trying to regroup and threaten the countries in the area,' Cook said. However, Erdogan's spokesman insisted in a tweet on Monday that Turkey 'will not allow (IS) to return in any shape and form'.\n\nHe initially had hoped to do it in collaboration with the United States but grew frustrated with what he considered to be delaying tactics by the U.S.\n\nOnce secured, Turkey wants to resettle the area with 2 million Syrian refugees who fled to Turkey due to the conflict in their home country.\n\nHow such a massive resettlement would be carried out is unclear. Human rights groups have warned that any escalation of fighting in the area could displace hundreds of thousands more people.\n\nErdogan has spoken of plans to build towns, villages, hospitals and schools but also says Turkey, which has already spent some $40 billion on the refugees, cannot afford to do it alone.\n\nHe has said he will convene a donors conference to help meet the cost and has called on European nations to share the burden, warning that Turkey could be forced to open the 'gates' for an influx of migrants to Western nations.\n\nTurkey has carried out two previous incursions into northern Syria in recent years with the help of Syrian rebels.\n\nIn the first offensive in 2016, Turkey pushed back Islamic State group militants west of the Euphrates River.\n\nIn the second operation last year, Turkey captured the Syrian-Kurdish controlled enclave of Afrin.\n\nThose regions are currently administered by Turkish-backed opposition groups who run them as virtual Turkish-administered towns.\n\nAnalysts say this operation would likely be more complicated.\n\nThe SDF says ISIS has already launched three suicide attacks in Raqqa, the group's former capital, in expectation of a Turkish assault\n\nIf Turkey claims all the territory currently held by the SDF then it will become responsible for between 10,000 and 15,000 ISIS fighters - 2,500 of whom are foreign-born (pictured, an SDF soldiers guards ISIS prisoners)\n\nThe SDF is also responsible for guarding the notorious Al-Hawl prison camp, where many captured ISIS wives and their children are being held (pictured)\n\nUnwilling to let go of an area they wrested from the Islamic State group, the battle-hardened Kurdish fighters - trained and equipped by the U.S. - have vowed to fight the Turks until the end.\n\n'It's a huge area for the Turkish military to go into and clearly there will be resistance on the part of the (Syrian Kurdish forces),' said Bulent Aliriza, of the director of the Turkey Project at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nAliriza suggested the operation may be a limited one that does not stretch all the way to the Iraqi border.\n\n'That's what we are going to look at first. How deep and how broad is it, whether it's all the way across from the Iraqi border to the Euphrates, or just limited to two or three penetration points,' he said.\n\nCritics of Trump's decision fear a Turkish operation could have destabilizing consequences for the region, while both Democrats and Republicans have warned that a Turkish attack could lead to a massacre of the Kurds, who are holding thousands of captured IS fighters and their families.\n\nOne of the big question marks surrounding Turkey's plans is whether fighting the Syrian Kurdish forces would allow IS to make a comeback.\n\nTurkey insists that the global battle against the militants won't suffer, and points to its 2016 incursion, which drove away IS from another border region.\n\nBut Kurdish officials have warned that they would have to divert their forces away from guarding IS prisoners in case of a Turkish assault.\n\nThe White House has said Turkey will take over responsibility for the imprisoned fighters, but it is unclear how that would happen, if it all.\n\nErdogan says Turkey and the United States are working separately on plans to repatriate foreign fighters held in Kurdish prisons.", "description": "Donald Trump said Wednesday that he is 'slowly and carefully' bringing American soldiers home from the Middle East, ending U.S. involvement in the 'worst' mistake in American history.", "authors": ["Francesca Chambers", "White House Correspondent For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/15/19492696-0-image-a-21_1570630474051.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
