Aramco, Saudi's national oil company, was forced to cut production by 5.7 million barrels per day or about 50%.\n\n\n\nYemen's Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for the attack, but the U.S. has pointed the finger at Iran. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused Tehran of launching an \"unprecedented attack on the world's energy supply.\"\n\nIran has dismissed those allegations as \"meaningless,\" \"not comprehensible\" and \"pointless.\" Foreign Minister Javad Zarif called on the Trump administration to hold talks.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is breaking news.
