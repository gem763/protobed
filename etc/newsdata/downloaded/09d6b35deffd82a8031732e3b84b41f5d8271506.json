They contained the second animal with a catch-pole, after which the dog strangled himself and died, according to Donelan.\n\nAD\n\nThe American Bulldog mixes were 8 months old, each weighing 60 to 70 pounds, said Rodney Taylor, chief of the Prince George\u2019s Animal Services Division. Taylor said their owners were issued $100 civil citations for violating the county\u2019s leash law. They were issued $50 civil citations for the same violation several months ago, Taylor said.\n\n\u201cThings like this can happen when you have dogs running loose, especially dogs that are ignored and not cared for,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nAD\n\nHe stressed he was speaking in general and not to this particular incident.\n\nThe Animal Services chief wants tougher laws designed to allow criminal charges to be levied against the owners of dogs that attack people. Such legislation is pending before the Prince George\u2019s County Council, Taylor said.\n\n\u201cI want that. I proposed that,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nOfficers were called to the scene at 11:15 a.m. on Saturday and arrived to find paramedics treating the 72-year-old man. He\u2019d been at a bus stop, Donelan said, when the two dogs attacked and dragged him down the street and pinned him against a wrought iron fence. Donelan said the residents \u201cappear to have played a critical role in halting the attack.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe animals moved on to their second victim, who had been walking down the street, forcing him to scramble onto the car. \u201cThese dogs kept ripping the man off the car and down into the street,\u201d Donelan said.\n\nThe officers used a pole to restrain one of the dogs away. The second dog ran into a nearby yard before coming back toward the officers, she said. He tried to attack the officers, backed off, and tried again. \u201cThat\u2019s when they were forced to open fire,\u201d Donelan said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe dog, meantime, who was on the pole strangled himself. He was acting in a very aggressive way,\u201d she added.\n\nAnimal Services officers spoke with the dogs\u2019 owners and ended up removing a third dog from the home, according to Taylor. That animal, a pit bull, wasn\u2019t involved in the attacks, Taylor said.\n\nAD", "description": "Responding police officers shot and killed one of the animals, an American Bulldog mix.", "authors": ["Dan Morse", "Reporter Covering Courts", "Crime In Montgomery County"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/vL57oTKH23Y4dayYW78hGbPcdMo=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GD2PP7QPDII6NP5BJ35IK3FPFI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
