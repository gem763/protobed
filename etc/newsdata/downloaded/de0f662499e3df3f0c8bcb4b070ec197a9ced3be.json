But next week he is set to testify against two of the gang\u2019s accused gang members, federal prosecutors said this week.\n\nThe rainbow-haired rapper will take the stand against accused Nine Trey gangsters Anthony \u201cHarv\u201d Ellison, 31, and Aljermiah \u201cNuke\u201d Mack, 33, in Manhattan federal court. Ellison is accused of kidnapping Tekashi last July along with racketeering and gun charges. Mack is charged with narcotics trafficking and racketeering.\n\nTekashi69, whose real name is Daniel Hernandez, rose to popularity in 2015 as a viral social media star who produced extreme music videos on Instagram and Youtube. After several years circulating as a SoundCloud-rapper, the 22-year-old entered the mainstream music scene with \u201cFEFE,\u201d his hit single created with Nicki Minaj last year.\n\nHe will testify after pleading guilty in February to nine federal charges, including firearms offenses, racketeering, and drug charges as part of his plea agreement. (The rapper previously pleaded guilty in 2015 to child pornography charges after filming a sexually explicit video with a 13-year-old girl\u2014a video he told prosecutors was intended to boost his \u201cscumbag\u201d persona and \u201cjust for shock value.\u201d)\n\nIn the last pretrial court hearing Tuesday before trial is set to begin next week, prosecutors and defense counsel discussed, among other things, whether to include whether to include Tekashi69\u2019s recent admission he \u201ccommitted domestic violence\u201d for over seven years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not relevant in this case, per the government\u2019s decision not to prosecute, but it is still something that may influence a jury,\u201d Judge Paul Engelmayer said in court.\n\nThe hearing came one day after prosecutors sent a letter to Engelmayer laying out their intent to focus Tekashi\u2019s testimony about his role \u201cin Nine Trey was to make money for the gang and distribute that money among Nine Trey members.\u201d\n\nCourt papers allege that Tekashi allegedly took part in a gunpoint robbery of Nine Trey rivals in Midtown Manhattan in 2018, when he filmed the heist from a nearby car. In court Wednesday, prosecutors argued to show the unredacted videos in court, along with Instagram conversations between Mack and fellow gang members about plans for the robbery.\n\n\u201cHarv, you know I\u2019ll give you everything...Harv, I\u2019ve always done right by you...Harv, I\u2019ve put money in your pocket bro, I\u2019m scared,\u201d Tekashi says in the video to Ellison, according to court documents.\n\nMack\u2019s lawyer argued on Wednesday the videos should be allowed into evidence without a transcription to \u201cshow the whole picture mere text cannot provide.\u201d Engelmayer overruled the defense\u2019s request, calling the move \u201cunnecessary\u201d for the jurors understanding of the case.\n\nProsecutors also said in court plans to use text messages sent by Ellison before and after he allegedly kidnapped and robbed Tekashi69 on July 22, 2018 in Brooklyn. In the messages, Ellison allegedly asks a fellow alleged gang members about the rapper\u2019s location and asks to be informed about media coverage of the incident afterwards, according to a letter filed by prosecutors.. Ellison and an unnamed individual also allegedly texted about purchasing Tekashi's jewelry that Ellison allegedly stole.\n\n\u201cFor example, Individual-1 told Ellison that if Ellison was \u2018trynna let something go,\u2019 then Individual-1 would \u201cspend some money for something,\u201d the letter said. \u201cAdditionally, Individual-1 told Ellison to sell Individual-1 \u2018the bitch with the red face.\u2019\u201d\n\nDeveraux Cannick, Ellison\u2019s lawyer, has previously called the incident staged, but remained silent in court Wednesday and agreed to show the texts in trial.\n\n\u201cNo robbery or kidnapping or assault happened,\u201d Cannick reportedly said. \u201cIt didn't happen. He had an event that made it look like a robbery or kidnapping.\u201d\n\nThe trial marks the final step in the case against over a dozen Nine Trey gang members indicted in November. On Friday, the rapper\u2019s former manager and accused gang member Kifano \u201cShotti\u201d Jordan was sentenced to 15 years in prison after previously pleading guilty to federal racketeering charges.", "description": "Brooklyn-born rapper pleaded guilty and flipped on his former pals in New York\u2019s Nine Trey gangsters.", "authors": ["Pilar Melendez"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568138429/190910-Melendez-Tekashi-tease_vsqjrs", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
