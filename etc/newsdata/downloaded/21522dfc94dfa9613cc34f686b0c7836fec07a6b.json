De'Angelo Sidney, an aerial port specialist with the 36th Contingency Response Group, marshals a C-130J Super Hercules at the Saipan International Airport, Saipan, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Nov. 28, 2018.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Pentagon will deploy U.S. forces to the Middle East on the heels of the Iranian attack on Saudi Arabian oil facilities, U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper announced Friday.\n\n\"The president has approved the deployment of U.S. forces which will be defensive in nature and primarily focused on air and missile defense,\" Esper said, adding that Saudi Arabia requested the support. \"We will also work to accelerate the delivery of military equipment to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the UAE to enhance their ability to defend themselves,\" he added.\n\nEsper reiterated that the United States does not seek a conflict with Iran and called on Tehran to return to diplomatic channels. He also said that there could be additional U.S. deployments if the situation were to escalate.\n\nOn Thursday, the Pentagon called the recent strikes on the Saudi Arabian oil facilities as \"sophisticated\" and represented a \"dramatic escalation\" in tensions within the region.\n\n\"This has been a dramatic escalation of what we have seen in the past. This was a number of airborne projectiles, was very sophisticated, coordinated and it had a dramatic impact on the global markets,\" Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said, adding that the strike is an international problem.\n\nThe strikes on the world's largest crude-processing plant and oil field forced the kingdom to shut down half of its production operations. What's more, the event triggered the largest spike in crude prices in decades and renewed concerns of a budding conflict in the Middle East. All the while, Iran maintains that it was not behind the attacks.\n\nOn Wednesday, Saudi Arabia's defense ministry said that drone and missile debris recovered by investigators shows Iranian culpability. Saudi coalition spokesman Col. Turki al-Maliki said during a press briefing in Riyadh that all military components retrieved from the oil facilities \"point to Iran.\"", "description": "The Pentagon will deploy U.S. forces to the Middle East on the heels of the Iranian attack on Saudi Arabian oil facilities, United States Secretary of Defense Mark Esper announced Friday.", "authors": ["Amanda Macias"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106141846-156902213552945251634335_d4edcaff7e_k.jpg?v=1569022310", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
