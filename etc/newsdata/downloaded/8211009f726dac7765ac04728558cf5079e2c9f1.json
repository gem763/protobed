No, he's not the reason one way or the other they got there. Current Nats explain. USA TODAY\n\nA century after the Chicago Black Sox threw the 1919 World Series, it might seem impossible that such a scandal could happen again \u2014 much less when the Washington Nationals play the Houston Astros in the 2019 World Series, which starts Tuesday.\n\n\u201cListen, never say never,\u2019\u2019 retired FBI special agent Andrew Arena told USA TODAY Sports. \u201cCould it happen? I mean, I think anything\u2019s possible.\u2019\u2019\n\nSports gambling scandals are nothing new to Arena. He was in charge of the Detroit's FBI office in 2007 when agents there broke open a point-shaving scandal at the University of Toledo involving four basketball players and three football players.\n\nAll seven athletes were sentenced to probation and ordered to pay fines and perform community service for their part in taking money and other things of value to influence games between 2004 and 2006. The lead gambler was sentenced to six years in prison and his gambling partner was sentenced to two years in prison.\n\n\"Shoeless\" Joe Jackson was among eight members of the White Sox who were banned for life by Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis for their role in throwing the 1919 World Series. (Photo: Anonymous, AP)\n\nIt was an example of how organized crime could influence college sports, Arena said at the time. And this week he described how gathering information about the mob\u2019s attempts to infiltrate sports for gambling purposes was among his tasks when he worked for the FBI\u2019s organized crime unit from the late 1980s to the 1990s.\n\nYes, Arena said, he understands that professional athletes make massive amounts of money that would be at risk if they were caught trying to fix games \u2014 conceivably a powerful deterrent.\n\n\u201cAthletes make a lot of money, but they can blow through it pretty quickly too,\u2019\u2019 said Arena, now executive director of the Detroit Crime Commission. \u201cSome of them just like the action.\n\n\u201cI was always worried more about (college sports). But where there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s a way.\u2019\u2019\n\nWORLD SERIES PREDICTIONS: Astros are heavy favorites over Nationals\n\nWHAT ABOUT BRYCE?Bryce Harper gone but not forgotten as Nationals bask in World Series\n\nUndeniably, there was a will and a way in 1919. Eight members of the Chicago White Sox, now better known as the Black Sox, were accused of intentionally losing the World Series to the Cincinnati Reds. Although the players were acquitted in a trial, they were banned from Major League Baseball for life and widely presumed as guilty of a conspiracy that sparks debate today \u2014 a very different time for sports gambling and perhaps for potential game fixers too.\n\nLast year, the Supreme Court lifted the federal ban on sports betting and legalized sports gambling quickly spread. In addition to Nevada, 10 states offer sports betting \u2014 a change that retired FBI agent Keith Slotter has followed with interest.\n\nSlotter was head of the FBI\u2019s San Diego field office when agents carried out \"Operation Hook Shot,\u201d which uncovered a sports bribery case at the University of San Diego.\n\nBrandon Johnson, then the program\u2019s career scoring leader was sentenced to six months in prison for his role in fixing games during the 2009-2000 season. A former assistant coach who served as a middleman between the players and the gamblers was sentenced to a year in prison and the lead gambler in the scheme was sentenced to 2\u00bd years in prison.\n\nSlotter also spent three years with the FBI\u2019s financial crimes unit that looked in part for corrupt gambling activity.\n\nBut Slotter, who retired in 2012, said he doesn\u2019t foresee another Black Sox scandal.\n\n\u201cAny crime like that, whether it\u2019s sports fraud or betting or anything along those lines, two elements that are always required are motivation and opportunity,\u2019\u2019 Slotter said. \u201cAnd in today\u2019s world, unlike 100 years ago, I don\u2019t think either of those exist in a realistic sort of way.\u2019\u2019\n\nSlotter pointed out that \"Shoeless\" Joe Jackson, the Black Sox's star, was paid like an Average Joe by the team \u2013 creating far more incentive to throw games for profit than presumably would exist for the multimillionaires that populate the today\u2019s professional sports leagues.\n\nAnother contrast: In 1919, there wasn\u2019t even a radio broadcast of the game. (The first baseball game broadcast on radio took place in 1921.)\n\n\u201cNow you\u2019ve got millions of eyes and replay watching ever single thing they do from every conceivable angle,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cAnd in addition to that, a lot of money is on the line in the huge sports betting industry. So with that type of scrutiny and the money they\u2019re already making, it just wouldn\u2019t make sense. it would be very difficult to pull off.\u2019\u2019\n\nWhereas the eight Black Sox players faced a prosecutor, now MLB has its very own. Well, former federal prosecutor \u2014 Bryan Seeley, senior vice president and deputy general counsel for investigations, compliance and security at MLB.\n\n\u201cThe idea that someone could manipulate a nine-inning game in Major League Baseball, it\u2019s hard to think that could happen again these days,\u2019\u2019 Seeley said. \u201cBut we\u2019re certainly always on guard for it.\u201d\n\nMLB has partnered with with Sportradar, a company collects and analyzes betting data to help ensure the integrity of sports contests. (The NFL, NBA and NHL use similar services.)\n\nSeeley said Sportsradar \u201cis able to look at line movements across a large number of bookmakers in many different jurisdictions, both legal and illegal bookmakers. And gives us alerts if there is any sort of unusual betting activity or unusual line activity that night cause concern or might require us to look more deeply into that.\n\n\u201cIf someone were to try to do what was done in 1919 and influence players to reach certain outcome in a game in order to profit on that you have to bet on that, right? There has to be money put into the betting markets at some point. Putting in a large amount of money in the betting market is likely going to move a line somewhere and that\u2019s how you can initially spot that something could be up.\u2019\u2019\n\nKevin Braig, an attorney from Ohio who has studied the Black Sox scandal and the current sports gambling landscape, would be happy to take a wager from anyone betting on a modern-day Black Sox sequel. Impossible, he said of the chances of a team throwing the World Series. But the notion triggered a thought.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s a little known fact that nobody talks about with the 1919 World Series,\u2019\u2019 Braig said. \u201cHave you ever heard of Hal Chase?\u2019\u2019\n\nChase was a first basemen who in 1919 played for the New York Giants \u2013 and was rumored to be a middleman between the players and the gamblers in the Black Sox scandal.\n\n\u2018\u2019He was an addicted gambler,\u2019\u2019 Braig said. \u201cHe had a lot of addictions and people with addictions have a lot of debts.\u2019\u2019\n\nA modern-day Hal Chase, Braig suggested, is someone MLB should fear \u2014 especially if such characters are lurking in the shadows.\n\n\u201cAs Judge Brandeis always said, \u2018Sunshine is the best disinfectant.\u2019 \u201d Braig offered. \u201cThe best way to ensure the integrity of the game with sports betting, from my point of view, is to make it as open and transparent as possible, regulate it appropriately and have the incentives in the right places.\n\n\u201cThat will do the trick.\u2019\u2019", "description": "Although it was 100 years ago that the Black Sox intentionally lost the World Series, there are still modern examples of game fixing in sports.", "authors": ["Josh Peter", "Published A.M.
