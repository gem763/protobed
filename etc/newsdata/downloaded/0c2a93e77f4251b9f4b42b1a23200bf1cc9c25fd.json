What had he made of the racist abuse of England\u2019s footballers by sections of the Bulgaria crowd the night before. \u201cThese people,\u201d he said, curtly, \u201care idiots.\u201d\n\nThe taxi driver wondered aloud why the Sofia police did not prevent the black-clad cohort of Bulgaria ultras from entering the stadium, the same tight-knit group who would later (it seemed) offer Nazi-style salutes \u2013 as those who know them knew they would. Instead the police had escorted the ultras inside.\n\nJordan Henderson says England wanted to make racist fans \u2018suffer\u2019 Read more\n\nThe taxi driver voiced a very curt opinion of Borislav Mihaylov, the bewigged Bulgarian FA president who had been so offended on Thursday by suggestions that what happened in Bulgaria\u2019s national stadium might indeed happen in Bulgaria\u2019s national stadium.\n\nFinally the taxi driver said he had nevertheless loved watching England because \u201cthey play football\u201d. He was still lugubrious and unsmiling. After a deeply depressing night in Sofia he seemed, for 20 minutes or so, the most unexpectedly lovable taxi driver in the world.\n\nIt is a Venn diagram some in England have had difficulty following but the maths isn\u2019t hard. Some of the crowd inside the Vasil Levski Stadium were racists. Not all Bulgarians are racists. And yes, before we clutch our pearls too tightly, the evidence suggests not all of the racists watching England thrash a wretched Bulgaria 6-0 were Bulgarian.\n\n\u201cWho put the ball in the racists\u2019 net? Super Raheem Sterling,\u201d the England fans sang. It is instructive to take a look at England\u2019s goalscorers. Sterling has been racially assaulted \u2013 literally kicked in the leg by a man saying racist things \u2013 outside the Etihad Stadium in Manchester. Ross Barkley, who has Nigerian heritage, has been described as \u201ca gorilla\u201d in a column in England\u2019s most popular daily newspaper. Marcus Rashford, who scored the opener, was racially abused on English social media this season for missing a penalty.\n\nIt would require a degree of delusion to suggest this problem exists only elsewhere. But this is not England v Bulgaria: the racist-off. It\u2019s not a zero sum game, a football match you have to try to \u201cwin\u201d. It is acceptable to demand change if there are also racist people in the country where you live. Condemn the violent xenophobia in European city squares. Condemn also the displays of performative fascism from our fellow European citizens. There are, sad to say, losers on all sides.\n\nBulgarian football president to resign after racist abuse in England game Read more\n\nMeanwhile the taxi driver in Sofia loved England because they played football. It felt like an apposite point. There are so many questions arising from the debacle of Monday night. The focus now will be on practical matters of punishment and administration. Uefa is historically culpable for these scenes. Paltry fines and spineless words brought us here, to a place where this hatred can now be expressed en masse at a televised Uefa event.\n\nThe average fine for an incident of racism in a stadium is around \u00a345,000. It\u2019s cheaper to pay than to police it properly. At the end of which Uefa has given racists a platform, all the while preaching in nauseating terms about respect, unity and all the rest.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Marcus Rashford scores England\u2019s first goal after seven minutes in Sofia. Photograph: Eddie Keogh for The FA/Shutterstock\n\nAll of which leads directly to the more interesting question. Were England right to stay on the pitch? Was it the correct decision to play through the abuse of the second half?\n\nThere had been some vague talk before this game that England would defy Uefa\u2019s three-step protocol. In the event they did but the other way. Rather than making a complaint that might have activated Step 2: The Walk-Off, they played through it, and did so with majestic composure.\n\nIt felt like entirely the right course of action. Gareth Southgate\u2019s comments that Sterling had been annoyed to be substituted on a hat-trick were beautifully pointed. To the local cameraman who muttered \u201cfuck off\u201d as Southgate left his even-handed press conference, it was the perfect pre-emptive response.\n\nGareth Southgate and England take strength from odious Sofia experience | David Hytner Read more\n\nThe Uefa protocol is a way of formalising a response to this problem. On the night it seemed like a mild absurdity, an attempt to manage an emotionally charged, utterly distinct situation, to dictate how the victim should respond in the moment.\n\nHow do you delineate this? One man\u2019s isolated chant is another man\u2019s line unacceptably crossed. And while they may control the branding of the event, Uefa really does not get to say what is and is not the correct emotional response to monkey chants or aggressively deployed fascist imagery.\n\nIt will surely have taken a toll on the abused players, something that may be worth bearing in mind over the next few weeks. But this felt like magnificent defiance. It may not always feel like that. No doubt there will be times when walking off seems right. But the point is the players must be free to decide for themselves, not bound to the creaky dictats of a paper tiger governing body.\n\nIn Sofia England stayed and were mercilessly good. The three-man midfield restored solidity, albeit against wretched opponents. Rashford\u2019s goal was stunning, made by a pirouette that sent Georgi Pashov over the advertisement hoarding, out of the stadium, along the dual carriageway, down on to metro line 2 and the full five stops to the Sofia museum of arts, all the while thinking to himself, vaguely, that there was something he was supposed to be doing.\n\nBarkley had a wonderful, driving game. Harry Kane was more a No 10 then No 9, but performed as England\u2019s creative hub. And England will now progress to next year\u2019s Uefa tournament, where the larger stage is likely to keep these problems from public view.\n\nUefa can address this now by suspending Bulgaria from its competitions, as it should, but quite clearly will not, in part for fear of the precedent this would set. But the problem will return. When it does, England will once again be free to walk off the pitch, or to stay as the players wish. In Sofia their response, so calm, so assertive, felt like the only note of cheer on a dismal, frightening night.", "description": "Uefa is historically culpable for what happened in Bulgaria\u2019s national stadium but there are losers on all sides", "authors": ["Barney Ronay"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28db49bb026b12c55dce168e071d28b8bfb5e971/0_106_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=0744dbd48d3c3b57256d14cec198070d", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
