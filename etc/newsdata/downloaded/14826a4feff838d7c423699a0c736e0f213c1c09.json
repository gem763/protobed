Six weeks after he took office, the prime minister looks certain to be forced by law to break his promise to leave the European Union by 31 October, \u201cdo or die\u201d. The implications for the Tory party are likely to be more significant than for Mr Johnson. The rebels will be purged from the party, by having the whip withdrawn and being prevented from standing as Tory candidates in the next election. The argument over Brexit raging in the Tory party might see the kind of split that followed Robert Peel\u2019s 1846 repeal of the Corn Laws.\n\nMr Johnson acts as if he wants such a schism, to seal his hostile takeover of the Tory party. The scale and pace of his power grab might astonish outsiders, but no one within the party should be surprised. In June the votes of 92,000 Tory members elected Mr Johnson, a no-dealer, to the party leadership. A month later he made it clear that only no-dealers could sit round the cabinet table. Mr Johnson has lost his majority in parliament, but he has strengthened his hold on his party. Now the Conservative party will be shorn of critics, allowing Mr Johnson to campaign in a forthcoming election \u2013 if he can engineer one \u2013 with a pledge to reverse any law that prevents a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. For Mr Johnson the incarnation of the Tory party under Theresa May was weak. Weak in spirit, in manner and in appearance. This would not do, he reasoned, for a country that was hurt, angry and scared. Mr Johnson\u2019s response was to adopt the Trumpian tactic of goading opponents to energise his supporters.\n\nThe prime minister wants to whip up as much indignation among leave voters as he can. It is a ploy to exacerbate grievances so that he can fight this base\u2019s corner in a flag-waving general election. This must happen before the consequences of a no-deal exit become obvious. To achieve this, Mr Johnson\u2019s strategy with the European Union has been to set out conditions to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement that cannot be met. That would make a damaging no-deal Brexit inevitable. The prime minister could then attach the blame for this outcome to his foes inside parliament and on the continent \u2013 hence his provocative and shameful descriptions of his opponents as collaborators who would \u201csurrender\u201d the UK\u2019s sovereignty. This unholy mixture of political opportunism and misguided ideology has been driving Britain towards a geopolitical precipice.\n\nIf Britain leaves the EU without a deal, there will be economic chaos; those who suffer most will be the very people who voted for Brexit as an act of defiance. It is no surprise that Mr Johnson now talks about cutting the cost of living, aware no doubt that the Brexit-fuelled depreciation of the pound disproportionately affects the poor by pushing up the prices of food and fuel.\n\nMr Johnson\u2019s pitch will be an update of the populism that William Hague road-tested in 2001: that the people are being betrayed by a \u201cliberal elite\u201d who wilfully ignore their concerns about foreigners and the threat posed by the EU, which unattended would see the UK becoming \u201ca foreign land\u201d. Yet even Mr Hague did not believe that pooling sovereignty with European partners would undermine our own and remove our right to cut regulation or get the best out of trade deals with the rest of the world. Mr Hague wanted a culture war with Europe, not an economic one. Mr Johnson wants both. This is how far the baleful virus of Europhobic populism has spread. It will keep the nation bitterly divided, even where considerable agreement once existed. Mr Johnson intuitively understands that turmoil will sustain his premiership \u2013 to the extent that there is no part of government that he will not burn down on behalf of the governed to keep himself in office. That is why he must be stopped.", "description": "Editorial: The prime minister intuitively understands that hard-Brexit chaos will sustain his premiership.
