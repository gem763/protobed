Little else is known about him. His complaint made public Thursday suggested he was an analyst by training and made clear he was steeped in details of American foreign policy toward Europe, demonstrating a sophisticated understanding of Ukrainian politics and at least some knowledge of the law.\n\nThe whistle-blower\u2019s expertise will likely add to lawmakers\u2019 confidence about the merits of his complaint, and tamp down allegations that he might have misunderstood what he learned about Mr. Trump. He did not listen directly to a July call between Mr. Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine that is at the center of the political firestorm over the president\u2019s mixing of diplomacy with personal political gain.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Us Politics Who-Is-Whistleblower.Html Smid Nytcore-Ios-Share"], "top_image": ""}
