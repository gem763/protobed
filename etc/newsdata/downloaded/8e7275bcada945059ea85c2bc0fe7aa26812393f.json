He's out of options. He would have to clear waivers to be sent down.\n\nBut he won't have trouble staying in the NHL if he continues to demonstrate the amazing skill he showed Wednesday night. He scored a spectacular between-the-legs goal that turned out to be the winner against the Dallas Stars.\n\n\"That's the best shot that I thought I had, so I did it,\" Milano said after the 3-2 win. \"You're not planning anything, you're just trying to score.\"\n\nNBC analyst Jeremy Roenick tweeted out that the goal had his vote for \"goal of the year.\"\n\n\"Are you kidding me...that was so dirty,\" Roenick said.\n\nRetired Columbus Associated Press writer Rusty Miller called it \"one of the most amazing goals in CBJ history\" on twitter\n\nNHL Network analyst Kevin Weekes had trouble duplicating on stage, from a standstill, in the network's wrap-up show.\n\nIt was Milano's first goal and point of the season. He has played 74 NHL games since being drafted 16th overall in 2014.", "description": "Blue Jackets forward Sonny Milano wasn't a lock to make roster out of camp.
