About 83% responded that they were not so surprised or not surprised at all that Trump had such a conversation, with little variation by partisanship. Only 3% of Americans said they were very surprised.", "description": "", "authors": ["Abcnews.Go.Com Politics Story Id Cid Social_Twitter_Abcn"], "top_image": ""}
