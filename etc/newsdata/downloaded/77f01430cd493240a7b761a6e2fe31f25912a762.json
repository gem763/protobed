Or at least, it feels that way. Now, the time for change is nearly upon us: Valve will begin rolling out the new and hopefully improved Steam library as a beta on September 18.\n\nValve demoed the new library in a behind-closed-doors session in Seattle last week, which Kotaku attended. To begin, Valve designer Alden Kroll showed off a new library home page with Steam-store-like \u201cWhat\u2019s New,\u201d \u201cRecent Games,\u201d and \u201cRecent Friend Activity\u201d carousels up top. These will be populated based on what developers and friends are up to, rather than a single, universal flow of information from Valve.\n\nThe focus is on showing what friends are interested in over time, as opposed to just what they\u2019re doing right now ala traditional friends list features. Beneath that is a visual representation of all your games, which you can sort as you please.\n\nThis includes the option to drag and drop games into \u201ccollections,\u201d which are replacing Steam\u2019s current category functionality and function dynamically. This means that if you create a collection based on tags \u2014 say, \u201cRPG\u201d and \u201ccontroller support\u201d \u2014 any new game you buy will automatically be added to that collection.\n\nImage: Valve\n\nIndividual games\u2019 library pages are also receiving an overhaul. They look much sleeker now, with art that developers can rotate up top and an activity feed showing what friends have been up to in that game below. There\u2019s also a panel on the right populated by your achievements and screenshots.\n\nAs you scroll down this page, these sections give way to content from the community at large \u2014 guides, videos, screenshots and the like. When you exit games, you\u2019ll also get a summary showing things like achievements and trading cards you earned in your play session, as well as screenshots you\u2019ve taken.\n\nLastly, developers will be able to add event banners to games\u2019 library pages as well. Valve demonstrated this with a Dota 2 mock-up featuring a splashy banner announcing the 2019 International tournament\u2019s battle pass.\n\nThis new event system, Kroll said, will soon be central to Steam. When a developer hosts an event, it won\u2019t just get prominent placement on a game\u2019s library page; it\u2019ll also appear on the community hub, the library landing page, the store, emails players can opt into receiving, and other sections.\n\nValve anticipates that developers will use it to announce everything from updates to in-game challenges and believes the system is necessary in an era increasingly focused on constantly updating \u201cservice\u201d games.\n\nImage: Valve\n\nAs for what Valve is doing to keep developers from gaming these systems like some recently did with the Steam store\u2019s \u201cpopular upcoming releases\u201d section, the company has a handful of solutions.\n\n\u201cFor each player, it\u2019ll be personalised based on what they\u2019ve played a lot, what they\u2019ve played recently, and what they\u2019ve played a lot in the past,\u201d said Kroll of the \u201cWhat\u2019s New\u201d section at the top of the Steam library.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019ll also be some rate limiting to make sure we\u2019re not showing six updates from the same game at the same time. There\u2019s definitely going to be a bunch of those things in there. We also want to hear feedback from players during the beta so we can fine tune that.\u201d\n\nTo close out the session, Kroll spent a few minutes reflecting on the launch of Steam\u2019s new experimental \u201cSteam Labs\u201d section and the future of the store.\n\nNew experiments, he said, are on the way, including six-second \u201cmicrotrailers\u201d for all games, new search page options that allow users to narrow results by discounts and tags, and a \u201cdeep dive\u201d feature that will be detailed in the future. In the long run, Valve hopes to make the process of discovering games on Steam more entertaining.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s sort of a theme across Steam Labs in general,\u201d said Kroll.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re thinking about \u2018How do we make the process of game discovery and game exploration more entertaining?\u2019 Games are obviously entertainment, and watching trailers is fun, looking at screenshots, reading descriptions \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of entertainment value in that process too. We think probably the next version of the store shouldn\u2019t just be rows of game branding images. It should be something more that\u2019s more interesting and entertaining.\u201d", "description": "In the time since Valve first started alluding to (and accidentally leaking mock-ups of) a mysterious Steam library overhaul, eras have ended, empires have risen and fallen, and we\u2019ve all grown weary and hunched.
