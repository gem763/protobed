Johnson was referring to the American practice of washing chicken carcasses with chemicals to tackle pathogens such as salmonella and E. coli \u2014 a process known as \u201cpathogen reduction treatment\u201d that's banned in the EU.\n\nIn a heated debate on Brexit on Wednesday, Johnson said: \"There\u2019s only one chlorinated chicken that I can see in this House, and he\u2019s on that bench.\" He repeated the line to Pence on Thursday, saying: \u201cWe have a gigantic chlorinated chicken of our own on the opposition benches.\u201d\n\nThe role of the NHS in any post-Brexit trade deal is a sensitive subject in Britain. During his state visit in June, Donald Trump said in a press conference alongside then Prime Minister Theresa May: \u201cWhen you\u2019re dealing in trade everything\u2019s on the table, so NHS or anything else \u2026 everything will be on the table, absolutely.\"\n\nA day later, he rowed back, telling ITV: \u201cI don\u2019t see it [the NHS] being on the table. Somebody asked me a question and I say \u2018everything\u2019s up for negotiation\u2019 because everything is \u2014 but that\u2019s something that I would not consider part of trade. That\u2019s not trade.\u201d\n\nJohnson and Pence met in Downing Street Thursday as part of the U.S. vice president's European tour. Pence stood in for Trump in Poland at a ceremony marking the 80th anniversary of the start of World War II, as Trump stayed behind to concentrate on Hurricane Dorian. Pence also traveled to Ireland and was criticized for staying in a Trump property in Doonbeg, on the opposite side of the country from Dublin.", "description": "UK PM says NHS won\u2019t be part of any transatlantic trade deal.", "authors": ["Paul Dallison", "Cristina Gallardo"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1166061042-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
