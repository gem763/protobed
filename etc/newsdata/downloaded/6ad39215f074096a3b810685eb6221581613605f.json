Despite their game\u2019s launch, the strike was too important for Goose Game\u2019s developers to miss.\n\nDesigner Nico Disseldorp told Kotaku today that he\u2019s been awake for nearly 24 hours straight. That\u2019s both because game launches are frantic sprints fuelled by adrenaline, anxiety and last-second bug fixing, and also because he and the other members of his game studio House House had a strike to attend.\n\n\u201cWe stopped work in the middle of our video game\u2019s launch day and went to the Global Climate Strike because we want our government and other governments around the world to take urgent action to mitigate the worst effects of climate change,\u201d Disseldorp said in an email. \u201cBusiness as usual is destroying all of our futures, and things need to change now.\u201d\n\nIn the lead-up to Untitled Goose Game\u2019s release, House House tweeted about the strike and mentioned it in interviews. While Disseldorp and company very much want people to enjoy their game on launch day, they want even more to still have an inhabitable planet to live on in the coming decades. If you skip playing Goose Game on launch day to hit the streets, that\u2019s fine with Disseldorp.\n\n\u201cIf striking for you means that you can\u2019t play our video game on launch day, that\u2019s OK,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople can play our game, or another game, some other time. The climate emergency is urgent, and needs us to drop what we are doing and demand that governments act immediately.\u201d", "description": "Yesterday was the long-awaited launch day of Untitled Goose Game, the avian sensation that\u2019s been sweeping multiple nations since its first trailer came out in 2017.
