REUTERS/Zoubeir Souissi\n\nAmong the 24 men and two women running for election are the prime minister, a media magnate detained last month on suspicion of tax fraud and money laundering, and a candidate from a moderate Islamist party that was banned before the revolution.\n\nThe presidential election was called early because of the death in July of president Beji Caid Essebsi, the first democratically elected head of state after the popular uprising that overthrew veteran strongman Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali.\n\nThe president controls foreign and defence policy, governing alongside a prime minister chosen by parliament who has authority over domestic affairs.\n\nWhoever ends up leading the country will face the challenge of a faltering economy and continued efforts to plug a large state deficit and public debt.\n\nPrime Minister Youssef Chahed told Reuters last week that Tunisia was still under threat from militant groups including Islamic State four years after two attacks killed dozens of tourists, badly hurting Tunisia\u2019s tourism industry.\n\nState television on Monday reported the death of a police chief and three Islamist militants in a security operation near the Algerian border.

His political party says the charges are politically motivated.\n\nSeveral candidates began their campaigns on the stroke of midnight, when the election season officially began, with Chahed meeting hundreds of supporters in the capital\u2019s impoverished Kabarya district.\n\nOther prominent candidates include former president Moncef Marzouki, former prime minister Mehdi Jomaa and Defence Minister Abdelkarim Zbidi.\n\nAbdelfattah Mourou, vice president of Ennahda party, is the moderate Islamist party\u2019s first candidate to become head of state after decades of repression before 2011.\n\n\u201cWe want to succeed in order to change the lives of Tunisians for the better and to strengthen the democratic path,\u201d Mourou said while sticking up election posters in Tunis.\n\nSupporters of Karoui also began putting up photographs of him, defying the judiciary\u2019s decision to arrest him and saying their campaign would begin with a large popular rally in the southern city of Gafsa later on Monday. The presidential vote, and a parliamentary election on Oct. 6, represent the third found of polls in which Tunisians have been able to vote freely since the 2011 uprising.", "description": "Tunisian presidential candidates began campaigning on Monday for the Sept. 15 election against a backdrop of economic troubles and a militant shooting that underlined the challenges facing the only democracy to emerge from the 2011 Arab uprisings.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190902&t=2&i=1425436299&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8119L-OZATP"}
