Like, all the information, the way that they phrase it to us ... The way they put people against each other. It\u2019s made for you to like, accept it a certain way, so a lot of people had to choose a side. I don\u2019t want to speak for them at all, but I feel like to a certain extent they got pushed into that too, and I don\u2019t think that all of that was a hundred percent their feelings.\u201d\n\nChance praised Minaj and Cardi, who is currently wining plaudits for her role in the new movie Hustlers, saying: \u201cJust being honest, they are two of the greatest recording artists. And that\u2019s just facts. The way that their music touches people, the way they\u2019ve impacted music? It\u2019s been incredible.\u201d\n\nIn the lengthy and wide ranging interview, Chance also talked about how Kanye West, who is increasingly portraying himself in quasi-religious terms, saying: \u201cYe is like one of my spiritual advisors, all he does is read the Bible and make samples and turn songs into gospel songs now.\u201d", "description": "Chance The Rapper, who has worked with both artists, says the display of  animosity between the two was carefully manipulated marketing.", "authors": ["Tom Sykes"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_576,w_1024,x_0,y_21/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568364326/GettyImages-1174329636_1_dlktg8", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
