By liberation, the German-American academic made abundantly clear he meant bringing central planning to America. It was the definition of \u201cliberation\u201d that Le Monde used in its headline the day after Pol Pot entered the Cambodian capital in 1975: \u201cPhnom Penh Lib\u00e9r\u00e9.\u201d\n\nThe Parisian newspaper has since apologized; the massacres carried out by the Khmer Rouge in the Killing Fields of Cambodia became too much of an embarrassment. But The New York Times undoubtedly will never apologize for its deceptive \u201c1619 Project.\u201d\n\nReplete with essays that present slavery as the central issue of the American story, and accuse \u201cthe brutal\u201d free market of creating such bondage, the series is but yet another attempt to make Americans question their country\u2019s very core. It follows Marcuse\u2019s advice to completely transform America by stigmatizing its economic system and all its institutions.\n\nTo do that, you exaggerate America\u2019s faults or outright employ falsehoods. As my Heritage Foundation colleague John York points out for The Daily Signal, the \u201c1619 Project\u201d is filled with historical inaccuracies.\n\nThe \u20181619 Project\u2019 Will Infiltrate Classrooms\n\nBeing trash history won\u2019t stop many of the country\u2019s 132,000 public and private schools from using the \u201c1619 Project.\u201d Howard Zinn\u2019s \u201cA People\u2019s History of the United States\u201d has also been repeatedly debunked because of its bad scholarship. Yet educators use this earlier project in classrooms across America today to poison the minds of young Americans with hatred of their own nation. It remains the No. 7 best-selling history book on Amazon four decades after it was first published.\n\nFurther, the Zinn Education Project has spawned a cottage industry of \u201ceducational\u201d material that burrowed even into middle school. Note to parents: Check the agate inscription at the bottom of the classroom notes your seventh-grade daughter or son brings home from school.\n\nThis is precisely the main danger of the \u201c1619 Project.\u201d The Times has turned it into curricula for classrooms that many, many of the nation\u2019s 18,000 school districts will jump at. The point is not to grapple with history and all its nuances and then seek societal reconciliation. The \u201c1619 Project\u201d shatters history hammer-like with its opening statement \u2014 \u201cOur democracy\u2019s ideals were false when they were written\u201d \u2014 and maintains the beat from there.\n\nEdmund Burke wrote in 1790, \u201cTo make us love our country, our country ought to be lovely,\u201d and Zinn, Marcuse, and the writers of the \u201c1619 Project\u201d understood that the obverse is also true: You make children believe their nation has been hideous from the start, and you have the makings of a peaceful revolution.\n\nMarcuse Despised and Smeared Capitalism\n\nMarcuse and the other critical theorists who came from Germany, escaping Adolf Hitler, discovered an America filled with happy consumers, and that royally bummed them out. \u201cThe people find themselves in their commodities: they find their soul in their automobile, hi-fi set, split-level home, kitchen equipment,\u201d despaired Marcuse in 1964\u2019s \u201cOne-Dimensional Man.\u201d\n\nCapitalism was too good and wouldn\u2019t produce revolt. \u201cIt is a good way of life \u2014 much better than before, and as a good way of life, it militates against qualitative change,\u201d he wrote. He left no doubt as to what he sought to put in its place: \u201cToday, the opposition to central planning in the name of liberal democracy \u2026 serves as an ideological prop for repressive interests.\u201d\n\nThe freedom that capitalism produced was an obstacle to the rationality of dirigisme, he thought: \u201cSelf-determination in the production and distribution of vital goods and services would be wasteful. \u2026 In this realm, centralized control is rational.\u201d\n\nBut there was a ray of hope. Marcuse had taken note of the urban violence gathering speed in America. There was a new revolutionary base which \u2014 if properly organized by people like him, the ideological vanguard \u2014 could get the country to embrace central planning and technological rationality, and end all that wasteful self-determination.\n\n\u201cUnderneath the conservative popular base is the substratum of the outcasts and outsiders, the exploited and persecuted of other races and other colors. The unemployed and the unemployable. \u2026 The fact that they start refusing to play the game may be the fact which marks the beginning of the end of a period,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe critical theory Marcuse and his colleagues created has now been recast as \u201ccritical race theory,\u201d which dominates many academic disciplines, finding its way into faculties of law, English, philosophy, and more.\n\nFor Real Liberation, Look to America\u2019s Founding Principles\n\nThe formula is simple: You constantly fill groups of people with grievances, maintain their permanent outrage, prevent their accession to society\u2019s mainstream, keep them from joining the contented boobs of capitalism, and you achieve \u201cqualitative change.\u201d Repression would have to be used, Marcuse admitted.\n\nAmericans have dealt with repression before and were encouraged to vanquish it by those ideals the New York Times attempts to smear. Last week was the 158th anniversary of Abraham Lincoln\u2019s preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, issued in 1862 in the midst of a bloody war waged to cleanse the sin of a repression known as slavery. The Civil Rights Act that came the year after Marcuse wrote these words finally ended the legal oppression and shame of Jim Crow.\n\nBut both Lincoln and Martin Luther King used the ideals of the founding as inspiration as they waged their struggle. They did not believe them to be false. These ideals liberated the country in 1776, 1865, and 1965.\n\nThese were crusades waged for freedom. The activism The New York Times is pursuing intends the opposite.
