Logos founder and CEO Michael Zochowski will become Xpring\u2019s \u201cHead of DeFi Products.\u201d Xpring did not disclose the price of the deal.\n\nBefore joining Xpring, Logos was working to build a payments network inspired by the bitcoin blockchain, with a focus on a scalable, rapid network that still maintains high levels of security.\n\nThe Logos acqui-hires will now help Ripple build XRP derivatives, loans, futures and forwards, said Ethan Beard, senior vice president of Xpring.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still at the early stage of figuring this out,\u201d Beard said, adding:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made investments in DeFi companies in the past. We invested in Securitize and Dharma, but it\u2019s now an area where we\u2019re building.\u201d\n\nPart of Xpring\u2019s focus is to identify use-cases outside of the company\u2019s payments network, RippleNet, to build a network of companies around XRP. So far, the company has committed $500 million to 20 companies, including both equity investments and XRP grants, like the $265 million deal brokered with content platform Coil.\n\nWith the Logos acquisition, Xpring now has a team of 32 employees, having grown from a team of just two last May. Beard hopes the same financial institutions that take advantage of RippleNet to achieve real-time payments and real-time fiat settlements will be interested in XRP-based DeFi products.\n\n\u201cIn particular, I\u2019m interested in debt and lending and what that looks like,\u201d Beard said, adding:\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t take long after the first creation of fiat for someone to go to a person who had some and say, \u2018Hey, can I borrow that?\u2019\u201d\n\nRipple CTO David Schwartz via CoinDesk archives", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.coindesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/46648554662_41d7737e96_k.jpg"}
