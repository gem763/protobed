Lauren threw in some flirty leather dancer\u2019s skirts and beaded tops paired with miniskirts. A short black sequin cocktail dress featured the brand\u2019s Martini Polo Bear.\n\nBella wore a slinky red gown while Gigi walked in a silver jacket tuxedo look. When Monae took the stage, accompanied by a jazz orchestra, the models left posed positions at the bar to clap, whoop and dance the night away.\n\nGolding was impressed.\n\n\u201cThis is insane,\u201d he told The Associated Press as he grabbed a drink at the bar. \u201cI mean, this is one of my favorite things to do, just sit in a jazz club. And look at this beautiful art deco room. It\u2019s phenomenal.\u201d\n\nRalph\u2019s Club continues Lauren\u2019s penchant of late for immersing his fashion week crowds rather than marching models down a runway. In the past, he has enticed his guests to his rural home north of the city for a jaunt in his garage. Ralph\u2019s Club follows Ralph\u2019s Cafe.\n\n\u201cIt just was the right time,\u201d Lauren told the AP after the show as the evening wound down. \u201cWe\u2019re celebrating. There are a lot of things in the world that are not so wonderful. Every once in awhile, it\u2019s nice to dance.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Janelle Monae brought down the house Saturday at Ralph Lauren's New York Fashion Week show, where \"the house\" was a jazzy nightclub of yesteryear that Lauren created inside a Wall Street building to debut his fall collection.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Leanne Italie"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/08/nyfw_spring_summer_2020_-_ralph_lauren_58512_c0-695-5031-3628_s1770x1032.jpg?9544a072d834de946293571c356ae2a44ca9ee45", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
