The survey polled 1,029 Americans of all generations.\n\nJust over half (51%) of all survey respondents believe they'll become wealthy. Millennials were the most confident generation polled \u2014 only 49% of Gen Xers and 25% of baby boomers think they'll become wealthy one day.\n\nWhile millennials may be more positive, as the younger generation, they also have more potential (and time) for building wealth than Gen Xers and baby boomers.\n\nInterestingly, more than half of all respondents (55%) define wealth not by a particular number, but as the ability to live comfortably without concern about finances. When it does come to numerical values, nearly 18% of both millennials and baby boomers define wealth as having a net worth of at least $1 million.\n\nRead more: Meet the average American millennial, who has an $8,000 net worth, is delaying life milestones because of student loan debt, and still relies on their parents for money\n\nDespite their optimism, millennials are financially behind\n\nMillennials may have a bright outlook, but their finances paint a different picture.\n\nThey have an average net worth of less than $8,000, Abha Bhattarai of The Washington Post reported, citing a 2019 Deloitte study.

Median household wealth was roughly 25% lower for those ages 20 to 35 in 2016 than it was for the same age group in 2007.\n\nThat might partly be because young adults aged 25 to 34 have only seen a $29 income increase from 1974 to 2017, adjusted for inflation, according to a recent SuperMoney report. This income growth hasn't kept up with staggering increases in home prices and education, all of which make it more difficult for millennials to save money.\n\nBut there's something to be said for millennials' optimism.\n\n\"Thinking positively about your money is key toward building better financial habits,\" Andrea Woroch, a money saving expert, told MagnifyMoney. \"Ultimately, your thoughts influence your behavior, which will lead to a desired outcome, so if you think you will be wealthy then you can start acting in accordance with this vision.\"", "description": "Millennials have an average net worth of less than $8,000 and have only seen a $29 income increase over the past 43 years when adjusted for inflation.", "authors": ["Hillary Hoffower"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d925e9a2e22af4ed32e9bf5?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
