Even if Grindr\u2019s many troubles have turned you off, there are several competing options, including, Scruff, Jack\u2019d, and Hornet and relative newcomers such as Chappy, Bumble\u2019s gay sibling.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut if you\u2019re not a white, young, cisgender man on a male-centric app, you may get a nagging sense that the queer dating platforms simply were not designed for you.\n\nMainstream dating apps \u201caren\u2019t built to meet queer needs,\u201d journalist Mary Emily O\u2019Hara tells me. O\u2019Hara returned to Tinder in February when her last relationship ended. In an experience other lesbians have noted, she encountered a lot of straight men and couples slipping into her results, so she investigated what many queer women say is an issue that\u2019s pushing them away from the most widely used dating app in America. It\u2019s one of many reasons keeping O\u2019Hara from logging on, too.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m basically not using mobile dating apps anymore,\u201d she says, preferring instead to meet potential matches on Instagram, where a growing number of people, regardless of gender identity or sexuality, turn to find and interact with potential partners.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAn Instagram account can serve as a photo gallery for admirers, a way to appeal to romantic interests with \u201cthirst pics\u201d and a low-stakes venue to interact with crushes by repeatedly responding to their \u201cstory\u201d posts with heart-eye emoji. Some see it as a tool to supplement dating apps, many of which enable users to connect their social media accounts to their profiles. Others keenly search accounts such as @_personals_, which have turned a corner of Instagram into a matchmaking service centering on queer women and transgender and non-binary people. \u201cEveryone I know obsessively reads Personals on Instagram,\u201d O\u2019Hara says. \u201cI\u2019ve dated a couple of people that I met after they posted ads there, and the experience has felt more intimate.\u201d\n\n\u201cDating apps aren\u2019t even capable of properly accommodating non-binary genders, let alone capturing all the nuance and negotiation that goes into trans attraction/sex/relationships,\u201d says \u201cGender Reveal\u201d podcast host Molly Woodstock, who uses singular \u201cthey\u201d pronouns.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate given that the queer community helped pioneer online dating out of necessity, from the analog days of personal ads to the first geosocial chat apps that enabled easy hookups. Only in the past few years has online dating emerged as the No. 1 way heterosexual couples meet. Since the advent of dating apps, same-sex couples have overwhelmingly met in the virtual world.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we tend to migrate to personal ads or social media apps like Instagram,\u201d Woodstock says. \u201cThere are no filters by gender or orientation or literally any filters at all, so there\u2019s no chance that said filters will misgender us or limit our ability to see people we might be attracted to.\u201d\n\nThe future of queer dating may look something like Personals, which raised nearly $50,000 in a crowdfunding campaign last summer and plans to launch a \u201clo-fi, text-based\u201d app of its own this fall. Founder Kelly Rakowski drew inspiration for the throwback approach to dating from personal ads in On Our Backs, a lesbian erotica magazine that printed from the 1980s to the early 2000s.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean all the existing matchmaking services are worthless, though; some cater to LGBTQ needs more than others. Here are the better queer dating apps, depending on what you\u2019re looking for.\n\nFor a (slightly) more trans-inclusive space, try OkCupid. Far from a glowing endorsement, OkCupid sometimes seems like the only palatable option.The few trans-centric apps that have launched in recent years have either failed to earn the community\u2019s trust or been described as a \u201chot mess.\u201d Of mainstream platforms, OkCupid has gone further than many of its competitors in giving users options for gender identities and sexualities as well as creating a designated profile area for defining pronouns, the first app of its caliber to do so. \u201cThe worlds of trans (and queer) dating and sex are more complicated than their straight, cisgender counterparts,\u201d Woodstock says. \u201cWe don\u2019t sort our partners into one or two easy categories (man or woman), but describe them in a variety of terms that touch on gender (non-binary), presentation (femme) and sexual preferences.\u201d Clearly, a void still exists in this category.\n\nFor the largest LGBTQ women-centric app, try Her. Until Personals launches its own app, queer women have few options other than Her, what one reviewer on the iOS App Store describes as \u201cthe only decent dating app.\u201d Launched in 2013 as Dattch, the app was renamed Her in 2015 and rebranded in 2018 to appear more welcoming to trans and non-binary people. It now claims more than 4 million users. Its core functionality resembles Tinder\u2019s, with a \u201cstack\u201d of potential matches you can swipe through. But Her also aims to create a sense of community, with a range of niche message boards \u2014 a new feature added last year \u2014 as well as branded events in a few major cities. One drawback: Reviewers on the Apple App and Google Play stores repeatedly complain that Her\u2019s functionality is limited \u2026 unless you hand over around $15 a month for a premium subscription.\n\nFor queer men and zero unsolicited nudes, try Chappy. Receiving unsolicited nudes is so widespread on gay male-focused dating apps that Grindr even has a profile field to let users indicate if they wish to receive NSFW pics. Chappy, on the other hand, restricts messaging to matches only, so it\u2019s a good bet if you want to avoid unwanted intimate photos. Chappy was launched in 2017 and became one of the fastest-growing apps in its native Britain before its acquisition by Bumble. Chappy offers a few refreshing features, including a user code of conduct everyone must agree to and the ability to easily toggle between guys looking for \u201ccasual,\u201d \u201ccommitment\u201d and \u201cfriends.\u201d Earlier this year, the app moved its headquarters to join Bumble in Austin, with its eyes set on growth in the United States. Current user reviews suggest it works best in the nation\u2019s largest metro areas.\n\nFor friends without benefits, try Bumble or Chappy. Need a break on your search for Ms., Mx. or Mr. Right? In hopes of keeping you swiping forever, some apps have created designated friend modes, notably Bumble and Chappy. But maybe try skipping the apps first \u2014 join an LGBTQ book club or a hiking Meetup group, or grab a drink at your local queer bar (if you have one left). Or, if you\u2019re in Los Angeles, hang out at Cuties, the city\u2019s only queer coffee shop. This reporter has done all these things and enjoyed all of them \u2014 except the hiking.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nAD", "description": "Many dating apps have security concerns or aren't built for non-binary genders.
