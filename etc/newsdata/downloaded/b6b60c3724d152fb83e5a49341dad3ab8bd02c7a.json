But this was a playoff game and the Nationals had an opportunity to take control of their series against the 106-win Dodgers.\n\n\u201cWe were at a good spot in the lineup where we thought Corbin could get through it,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cAnd his stuff was good, he\u2019s throwing 94 (mph), slider was good.\u201d\n\nPatrick Corbin reacts during the fateful sixth inning on Sunday. (Photo: Brad Mills, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThe left-hander came close to getting out of the sixth inning unscathed. But two-out, two-run doubles by Russell Martin and Kike Hernandez \u2013 both with two strikes \u2013 proved to be his undoing as the Dodgers broke the game open.\n\nCorbin said he felt good on the mound, but his slider just didn\u2019t have the break it usually has.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably something out of the norm for him, but tip your cap to him,\u201d said catcher Yan Gomes. \u201cThese guys take the ball whenever they can. It was the right situation to put him in there.\u201d\n\nCorbin\u2019s final line was rather ugly: Two-thirds of an inning, four hits, two walks, six earned runs.\n\n\u201cWe were hoping to get two (innings) out of him, but his limit was going to be about 35 pitches,\u201d Martinez said.\n\nDespite being down 2-1 in the series, the Nationals are still in decent position with Scherzer on the mound in Game 4 on Monday and Stephen Strasburg in line to start a winner-take-all Game 5 in L.A.\n\nBut to get there, they\u2019ll probably need to call on Corbin again at some point to help neutralize the Dodgers\u2019 barrage of left-handed hitters \u2013 which includes Joc Pederson, Max Muncy, Cody Bellinger and Corey Seager.\n\nDuring the regular season, Corbin held lefty hitters to a .190/.260/.248 slash line in 137 at-bats. The only other southpaw on the Nationals\u2019 NLDS roster is Doolittle, who generally doesn\u2019t pitch more than an inning at a time.\n\nCorbin wants another chance, so his season doesn\u2019t have to end on such a down note.\n\n\u201cIt just stinks,\u201d Corbin said. \u201cI feel like I let these guys down.\u201d\n\nMartinez certainly hasn\u2019t lost confidence in a pitcher the Nationals signed to a six-year, $140 million contract last winter.\n\n\u201cI trust Pat. He\u2019s been unbelievable all year,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cAnd I would do it again. I really would.\n\n\u201cHe looked me in the eye after he came out and says, I\u2019ll be ready tomorrow. So that\u2019s the kind of guys we got on this team.\u201d", "description": "Coming out of the bullpen, Nationals left-hander Patrick Corbin coughed up a lead in a big way in the sixth inning of Game 4.", "authors": ["Steve Gardner", "Published A.M.
