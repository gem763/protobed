We will not be going back. \u2026 I have deep concerns about whether or not a conventional political argument will be able to defeat him very easily. Conventional politics is like a very good actor somewhere down like at the New York Public Theater, behind a podium, reading a very fine play. [Trump] is like surround sound \u201cStar Wars\u201d on huge screens all around. So we have to rise to the level of his frequency. It\u2019s almost like homeopathy. Right? That\u2019s me, baby! \u2026\n\nNow, he is a phenomenon, he is not just a politician. He is a phenomenon. We need to counter that with a phenomenon of our own. The phenomenon we can counter him with is not any individual, but it is the power, the energy, the motivation, and the spirit, and the inspiration that comes from having a real, radically honest conversation about who we are and what we are doing as a country. \u2026\n\nWe have a conventional political system that doesn\u2019t want to upset people, doesn\u2019t wanna be negative. So it doesn\u2019t get real. It doesn\u2019t get true. It doesn\u2019t get deeply honest. It infantilizes people. It doesn\u2019t respect the intelligence of the American people enough to talk about how bad things really are, because we have to talk about how bad things really are in order to be the sober, intelligent, noble people we need to be in order to transform these things.", "description": "Should she be on that debate stage?
