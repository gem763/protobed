Col. Alexander Vindman's testimony is as open to criticism as anyone else's should be, Watters claimed Tuesday on \"The Five.\"\n\n\"I don't really care to hear about how someone feels about Donald Trump's phone call,\" he said of the president's July discussion with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nGOP REPS SAY SCHIFF STOPPED IMPEACHMENT WITNESS FROM ANSWERING CERTAIN GOP QUESTIONS\n\n\"The tick-tock is designed to inflame everybody on the daily news cycle.
