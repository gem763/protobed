REUTERS/Henry Nicholls\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - British car production increased by an annual 3.3% in August, the first rise in 15 months, helped by several factories having moved their summertime shutdowns to April in preparation for the original Brexit date, an industry body said on Thursday.\n\nBMW, Peugeot, Honda and Jaguar Land Rover all closed factories ranging from a few days to four weeks in April over concerns that Britain\u2019s scheduled departure from the European Union in March could lead to disruption, including delays to the arrival of parts.\n\nThe move led to a 44.5% decline in output in April, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) and ended up being in vain as Brexit was eventually pushed back to the end of October.\n\nAugust saw a small bounceback with output rising 3.3% to 92,158 cars, helped by a 15.2% increase in domestic demand, data showed.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s figures mask the underlying downward trend and strengthening global headwinds facing the sector, including international trade tensions, massive technological upheaval and, in the UK, political and economic uncertainty,\u201d said SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes.\n\n\u201cWe now need parliament and government to redouble efforts to get a deal that maintains free and frictionless trade.\u201d", "description": "British car production increased by an annual 3.3% in August, the first rise in 15 months, helped by several factories having moved their summertime shutdowns to April in preparation for the original Brexit date, an industry body said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433931845&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O2BG", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
