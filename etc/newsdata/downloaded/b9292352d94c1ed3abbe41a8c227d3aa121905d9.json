Also keep an eye on the gubernatorial candidates he's endorsed, particularly in places like Georgia where Trump has gotten involved for the Republican.\n\nThere are a number of black women running for office this year who are notably missing from this list, but a handful of them are challenging incumbent Democrats or are running in safely blue districts. A quick scan through the endorsements suggests that Obama isn't endorsing any Democratic candidate who is a primary challenger to an incumbent Democrat.\n\nCalifornia:\n\nGavin Newsom (Governor)\n\nEleni Kounalakis (Lt.
