Come make your voice heard about how difficult it is to be a conservative on liberal college campuses. pic.twitter.com/rMovjk9hPz \u2014 YCT TXST (@YCT_TXST) October 8, 2019\n\nMoreover, the conservative student group says it has received threats for hosting its campus event.\n\nNonetheless, YCT says that it stands by its event, and released a statement, which also mentioned its affiliation with the Log Cabin Republicans \u2014 a group that represents LGBT conservatives.\n\nThe conservative group also said that members of the student government (SGA) claimed that their event attributed to LGBTQIA+ students committing \u201csuicide.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo take such a serious matter as student deaths and arbitrarily blame an organization, which most of the student government refuses to talk to, is negligent and dangerous,\u201d said YCT in its statement. \u201cWe are grateful the university does not grant the SGA any real power.\u201d\n\nIn response to the #TXST Student Government Association\u2019s resolution. We stand by our event with @LogCabinAustin members @michaeldcargill and @zacktedder and hope conversations continue around the issue our event shed light on. pic.twitter.com/fZffVdvv3w \u2014 YCT TXST (@YCT_TXST) October 15, 2019\n\n\u201cThe Young Conservatives of Texas at Texas State University hereby denounces, condemns, and refuses to recognize the Texas State University Student Government as a legitimate, reasonable, and responsible organization,\u201d stated YCT.\n\nGay conservative and Turning Point USA contributor Rob Smith offered his opinion on the matter.\n\n\u201cAs a gay man who last year pioneered the idea of \u2018coming out\u2019 as a conservative, I completely support this group\u2019s efforts,\u201d said Smith to Breitbart News. \u201cCloseted conservatives message me all the time with fear of being disowned by family, dumped by friends, and discriminated against at work just because they don\u2019t have the \u2018right\u2019 politics.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis has happened to me since I \u2018came out,'\u201d added Smith. \u201cAs long as conservatives have that fear, and as long as we face very real consequences of being open about our political beliefs, we will have to \u2018come out,\u2019 just as I have to \u2018come out\u2019 as a gay man. It\u2019s the same exact thing.\u201d\n\nYou can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Twitter at @ARmastrangelo and on Instagram.", "description": "The student government at Texas State University introduced a resolution to condemn the school's\u00a0Young Conservatives of Texas student group for hosting a \"coming out\" event\u00a0for conservatives, which coincided with the LGBT community's \"National Coming Out Day.\"", "authors": ["Alana Mastrangelo"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Texas-State-Protest-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
