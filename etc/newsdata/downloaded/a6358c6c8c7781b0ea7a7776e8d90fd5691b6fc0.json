The board needs to be a bit realistic and think out of the box by appointing a specialized batting coach,\u201d he told APP.\n\n\u201cI think the Board was reluctant to hire Faisal due to his relationship with me. But if you speak on merit, he deserves to serve as Pakistan\u2019s batting coach.\u201d\n\n\u201cFaisal have done coaching courses from England and is the best possible option for the batting coach position,\u201d he added.\n\nIqbal is a certified coach and has been associated with the most popular franchise of Pakistan Super League, Karachi Kings as a member of coaching staff. He had also applied for the posts of junior and senior\u2019s batting coach positions, but didn\u2019t get the role.\n\nThe 37-year-old has represented Pakistan in 26 Test matches and 18 One Day Internationals in his career. He has also captained Pakistan at U-15 and U-19 level.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "In his recent interview, the legendary batsman said that the board has overburdened Misbah by assigning him the dual task, therefore they should hire Faisal as a batting coach as he is the\u00a0best possible option for the position.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arysports.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/000_Del28986.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
