That opening tackle looked borderline high but went unpunished.\n\nAfter waiting until the 24th minute to score on Sunday, England were quicker off the mark in Kobe, scrumhalf Willi Heinz finding Ford running a beautiful line and the number 10 went through to score under the posts after five minutes.\n\nEngland then opted to kick for touch when awarded a penalty just outside the U.S. 22 and were rewarded when Tom Curry claimed the lineout and Vunipola smashed over from the back of a driving maul.\n\nEngland\u2019s third try arrived in similar circumstances, the United States powerless to stop a rampaging maul before Cowan-Dickie touched down.\n\nThe stadium\u2019s retractable roof was closed for the match, meaning that while the players had to deal with stifling humidity the fans were able to create a boisterous atmosphere.\n\nChants of \u201cUSA! USA!\u201d competed with renditions of England\u2019s rugby anthem \u201cSwing Low, Sweet Chariot\u201d while the entire crowd joined together at halftime to belt out the John Denver classic, \u201cTake me home, country roads\u201d.\n\nThe red shirts of England were quickly into their stride after the break and claimed the bonus point try in the 48th minute when a rampaging Jonathan Joseph was stopped just short but Cokanasiga was on hand to score.\n\nA raft of substitutions followed, with Ben Youngs coming on to win his 91st cap and join Jonny Wilkinson and prop Dan Cole, who had started the match, for third on the all-time England men\u2019s appearances list.\n\nEngland winger McConnochie was having a quiet night but the Olympic rugby sevens silver medallist showed his sense of timing just before the hour mark, taking a pass at full pelt and bundling over for his first international try in the 15-aside game.\n\nEngland\u2019s seventh score came with four minutes left when replacement prop Ellis Genge barrelled his way through a host tired U.S. tacklers before Cokanasiga finished off.\n\nEngland, not content, greedily went for another score after the final \u2018gong\u2019 had sounded but instead it was the United States who got the score, replacement Bryce Campbell going over after an untidy, frenzied passage of play.", "description": "England's squad players got the job done with a solid 45-7 bonus point victory over the United States at the Rugby World Cup on Thursday against a determined Eagles side.", "authors": ["Peter Rutherford", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434148141&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P14B-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
