To paint a picture of the era it was born in, the online creative community was originally started in 2000 to share skins for media players like Winamp. But CEO Angelo Sotira, who co-founded the site when he was 19, maintains that the platform is very young, at least when you look at the age of its users and how long they\u2019ve been making art.\n\nNow, after its acquisition by the website-building platform Wix in 2017, the site\u2019s perennial army-green design is being revamped with a sleek new layout called DeviantArt Eclipse. \u201cThe aim is to be DeviantArt for the next 10 years, not the past 20,\u201d Sotira says.\n\nIn its heyday, DeviantArt was home to a tight-knit community for artists of all skills. Users could leave constructive criticism under people\u2019s art and write messages on each others\u2019 profiles, long before Facebook was invented. Professional artists \u2014 like the Oscar-winning director of Pixar\u2019s Bao, Domee Shi \u2014 credit the site as the place where they got their start. \u201cOnline art communities are probably a huge reason that you\u2019re seeing a lot more girls getting into animation and illustration,\u201d Shi told The New York Times in an interview.\n\nBut as social networks began taking off, users gradually started to leave for bigger platforms like Tumblr and Instagram. Artists traded the niche, art-focused community for broader networks that were easier to use and could reach more people, and visits to DeviantArt began to plummet. In 2012, DeviantArt advertised having 65 million monthly visitors. Just three years later, it would fall to 45 million, and the platform hasn\u2019t updated the stat since.\n\nNow DeviantArt is hoping to reclaim its place as the creative social platform for artists \u2014 and it might be the perfect time. Recently, competing sites have been struck with their own set of problems: much of Tumblr\u2019s oddball community fled the site after a crackdown on adult content, and Instagram\u2019s algorithms have made it harder for artists to be discovered unless they post content regularly. Platform fatigue is setting in, and artists are looking for other options.\n\nEclipse is rolling out to users now, and the aesthetic is decidedly more modern, available in a light or dark theme. User profiles are more customizable with rearrangeable Wix widgets and huge header photos. There are redesigned pages for deviations (what DeviantArt calls submissions) that let you choose your background to make art stand out, and expanded search functionalities that let users browse commissions, polls, and tags. Eclipse is also getting rid of third-party ads, which used to be a perk that Core members (a $5/month subscription feature that also gets users more storage and site features) paid for.\n\nCommunity reaction to the redesign appears to be split. Many longtime users aren\u2019t happy about missing features nor the buggy new interface that\u2019s still going through growing pains; others welcome it as progress, recognizing that it\u2019s time to move away from the dated design. It\u2019s also been criticized as being too similar to ArtStation, another creative platform for sharing art. Sotira doesn\u2019t seem worried, having come to expect this sort of reaction throughout the 10 versions the site has gone through in 19 years. But none of the redesigns have been as drastic as this.\n\nIllustrator Lois van Baarle has been a DeviantArt member since 2002 and is one of the site\u2019s most recognized artists. She\u2019s more active these days on Instagram or Twitter, but still updates her DeviantArt occasionally. Baarle describes her experience with Eclipse as \u201coverwhelming\u201d so far. \u201c[It\u2019s] like having to learn a new platform altogether! A lot of the people who use DeviantArt are attached to the way it used to be, so I think they\u2019ll need to attract a lot of new members in order for this huge change to catch on.\u201d\n\nDeviantArt\u2019s design is something the company has debated internally for a long time. In response to a 2012 Quora post titled \u201cWhy does deviantART look so archaic/ugly?,\u201d Sotira acknowledged that the green was a point of contention for a lot of people, but said breaking the user interface lines that longtime users were used to would \u201cdestroy habitual browsing and harm traffic patterns.\u201d As Eclipse rolls out, Sotira plans to give users the option to return to the original layout. It\u2019ll stay for as long as it needs to, until the majority of users warm up to the new design.\n\nWhen big tech companies take over established creative communities, it\u2019s often gone poorly. But Sotira believes that it makes more sense for a subscription company like Wix to acquire a site like DeviantArt, than it did for Yahoo, an advertising-backed media business, to acquire a platform like Tumblr. \u201cI think they didn\u2019t really realize what they were getting themselves into,\u201d he says. Justin Maller, the platform\u2019s chief creative officer, agrees: \u201cI don\u2019t think they respected its DNA. They tried to homogenize it and not celebrate what was unusual about it.\u201d\n\nWix is specifically focused on helping creatives build personal websites, which has a natural connection to DeviantArt. On a recent earnings call, Wix CEO Avishai Abrahami said artists and designers tend to need multiple websites, which makes DeviantArt users \u201cour base customers.\u201d Eclipse\u2019s redesigned profile pages are also meant to double as portfolio sites, and with DeviantArt dropping ads, the more professional presentation can also be used to lure in new sources of revenue, like brand partnerships.\n\nWhile DeviantArt\u2019s content policies are much less restrictive than Tumblr\u2019s, it still has clear limitations on what can and can\u2019t be posted, especially around sexual themes. \u201cModeration is one of the hardest challenges on any one of these networks,\u201d Sotira says. Some moderation is automated, but a lot of it is flagged by the community. DeviantArt also has a somewhat increased barrier to entry, in that the process of uploading art is also an act of self-moderation. Everything posted on the site \u2014 there are about 65,000 submissions a day \u2014 is a piece of art personally created by the user. You can\u2019t batch upload photos or just dump dozens of files at a time. Everything has to be submitted intentionally. Art has to be placed into specific categories, and if it\u2019s mature content, it\u2019s supposed to be flagged as such when it\u2019s uploaded.\n\nYou have to credit DeviantArt for sticking around this long, throughout the internet\u2019s many trends and phases. In 2019, artists have more places than ever to showcase their work, from professional portfolio sites like Behance to giant social networks like Instagram. But DeviantArt has always felt like it exists in its own space, and there\u2019s something comforting about the fact that it\u2019s still standing.\n\nPeople knock DeviantArt for the quality of art posted on the site, but there\u2019s a vitalness in having a space for beginner artists to grow together. Fan art, which is commonly associated with the site, is often dismissed as being amateurish, but there\u2019s real value in it. You learn to draw by imitating, and the best art comes from the subjects you\u2019re passionate about. In nearly two decades of attending DeviantArt meetups, Sotira says he\u2019s seen a consistent turnout of a young audience that replenishes regularly. And Maller knows the value of having a community, having first met Sotira at a DeviantArt meetup in Australia. \u201cNot everyone\u2019s there to be a professional the whole time, some people are there to learn,\u201d he says.\n\nSotira wrote an article for Recode a few years back titled, \u201cNever Forget That 16-Year-Old Girls Run the Internet,\u201d which he still believes to be true. Keeping an eye on the art that\u2019s being uploaded to the site, and what kinds of members are rising in popularity, Sotira can get a sense of what users are into. \u201cTeenage girls really like horses and wolves, as a baseline,\u201d Sotira says. \u201cIn 20 years, lots of stuff has changed on the internet. That has not.\u201d", "description": "After its acquisition by the website-building platform Wix in 2017, DeviantArt\u2019s perennial army-green design is being revamped with a sleek new layout called DeviantArt Eclipse.", "authors": ["Dami Lee", "May"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JoS2jBjuzT60_GWLOLwhMyFjokk=/0x357:1920x1362/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16282103/Browse.png", "published_at": "2019-05-17"}
