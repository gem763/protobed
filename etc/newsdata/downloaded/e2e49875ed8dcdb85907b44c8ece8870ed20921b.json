You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nAnd Mr Johnson himself was confronted with the claims during a TV interview. Asked whether it was true he touched a woman's thigh without her consent, he told Sky News: \"No, and I think what the public want to hear is about what we are doing to level up and unite the country.\"\n\nThe PM insisted on Sunday that he had acted with \u201cfull propriety\u201d in relation to US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri, after claims emerged that she had said she was in an intimate relationship with him during his time as London mayor. He said that no conflict of interest arose when her company was awarded publicly-funded grants by City Hall and given access to overseas business missions which he led.\n\nMs Greening, who was stripped of the Conservative whip for rebelling over Brexit, told Sky News: \u201cThere are obviously deeply concerning allegations that have been made and I think they really do go to the heart of the character and integrity that people have a right to expect from politicians running this country.\n\n\u201cSo I think that Number 10 should deal with these allegations.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
