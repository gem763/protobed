Certainly not an afro-wig wearing, Banana Boat-singing, face-blacking one. Though, admittedly, he did do all those racist things and possibly more \u2013 it\u2019s hard to know because he says he can\u2019t remember.\n\nIf we know one thing about Trudeau, it\u2019s that he loves people, all people. Especially \u201cracialised Canadians\u201d, as he now calls them, using the parlance of the day. Trudeau admires people of colour so much that when he found himself at a party dressed as Aladdin, he was happy to throw his arms around two genuinely racialised Canadians and grin boldly for the camera.\n\nReal racists don\u2019t do that kind of thing, even in Canada, which, for all its progressiveness, can also be backward, especially in the highest circles of its cosmopolitan elite. Feel free to Google \u201cthe history of blackface in Quebec\u201d, Trudeau\u2019s prosperous home province, if you\u2019re struggling to grasp how the 29-year-old son of a Liberal party prime minister thought it a hilarious idea to smear shoe polish on his face and, what\u2019s more, for a party at the high school where he taught.\n\nCanada is an extraordinary country, but it isn\u2019t the progressive utopia Trudeau wants it to be. Instead, it\u2019s a decentralised collection of sparsely populated provinces and territories, a mosaic rather than a melting pot, as all good Canadian schoolchildren are taught.\n\nThe country has long struggled to find a cohesive identity beyond its extreme climate and moderate aversion to conflict. Canadians are, for the most part, a nice lot, but as Trudeau showed us last week, niceness alone won\u2019t save us.\n\nTrudeau can\u2019t wish away the rising tide of populism that\u2019s about to wash away his sunny ways any more than he can those dreadful pictures. But wishful thinking and shining intentions have long been Trudeau\u2019s shtick and, when that fails, he loves a good apology. He\u2019s such a fan of saying sorry, it\u2019s become cultural policy. Every morning across Canada, schoolchildren recite an apology to the indigenous people on whose stolen land they are lucky to be standing.\n\nA good idea. But impoverished indigenous youth still continue to kill themselves at an alarming rate (there were huge demonstrations about the issue last week) and 50 communities are still living on \u201cboil water\u201d advisories. Trudeau\u2019s working on the issue, he really is, but in the meantime lip service will have to do.\n\nIn his contrition-fest of press conferences last week, he acknowledged that he comes from \u201ca place of privilege\u201d and that it was this provenance that deluded him into thinking that blacking up was just goofing around. This admission, more than anything else, gets to the heart of why Canadian moderates are losing faith in the man who once delighted us by cuddling baby pandas and grooving it out with drag queens on Pride Day. There\u2019s the feeling he\u2019ll do anything to please an audience and consider the consequences later.\n\nIn Trudeau\u2019s words, it was only years later when he became an MP for a culturally and economically diverse Montreal constituency that he realised that blacking up was wrong. The press conference went on like this for several minutes \u2013 journalists tut-tutting, Trudeau displaying his vulnerabilities like a labrador rolling over for a tummy rub \u2013 until a reporter stuck it to him in the most politely Canadian way.\n\nIt's great you're denouncing racism, but the prime minister's job was not created so you could work through your issues\n\nIt\u2019s great that you\u2019re denouncing racism, the reporter said, \u201cbut the prime minister\u2019s job was not created so you could work through your issues\u201d. Then he plunged the blade deeper and twisted. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s time you realise that you are not the indispensable man.\u201d\n\nFor progressive Canadians, the concern about Trudeau was never that he was a power-mongering closet racist, just that he was a bit too soft for the job. This despite his former attorney general\u2019s assertion that she was inappropriately pressured by his office \u2013 another badly handled scandal that has hobbled him.\n\nTrudeau has only two modes: empathising and grovelling. Irrespective of his mystifying youthful makeup choices, neither mode has proved an effective weapon against the blandly malignant siren call of Tory rival Andrew Sheer\u2019s populism. And that\u2019s the real reason he\u2019s failing. It\u2019s not that we don\u2019t believe he\u2019s sincere \u2013 it\u2019s that his sincerity has been revealed as a form of stupidity, a blindspot of privilege that undermines his project as a whole.\n\n\u2022 Leah McLaren is a Canadian novelist and journalist", "description": "The blackface row has exposed the failings of the Canadian prime minister", "authors": ["Leah Mclaren"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd6c9744d95b513252d814da92621f79a57a3502/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=bd9439173a3173f0a93c646a2b57635e", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
