Barr tapped Mr. Durham, the top federal prosecutor in Connecticut, to review how the FBI began its investigation into Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and whether the agency improperly spied on key campaign figures.\n\nMr. Durham\u2019s probe has now cast a spotlight on Ukraine, a Justice Department spokeswoman said.\n\n\u201cA Department of Justice team led by U.S. Attorney John Durham is separately exploring the extent to which a number of countries, including Ukraine, played a role in the counterintelligence investigation directed at the Trump campaign during the 2016 election,\u201d DOJ spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said in a statement.\n\nMs. Kupec said Ukrainians who are not government officials have already volunteered information as part of the probe. She also said that Mr. Barr has not yet contacted the Ukrainian government over the investigation.\n\nUkraine has been at the center of a political firestorm in Washington as controversy swirls around Mr. Trump\u2019s phone call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky asking him to reopen that country\u2019s investigation into the business dealings of Hunter Biden, the son of current Democratic presidential front-runner and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden.\n\nSEE ALSO: Trump says transcript refutes Democrats\u2019 claim of \u2018call from hell\u2019 with Ukraine\n\nAt some point during the call, Mr. Trump appears to ask the Ukrainian president if someone in his country has a server that contains some emails of his 2016 presidential election rival Hillary Clinton.\n\n\u201cI would like to ask you to do us a favor, though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine. They say Crowdstrike\u2026I guess you have one of your wealthy people\u2026the server, they saw Ukraine has it,\u201d Mr. Trump said in the call, according to a transcript.\n\nIt is not clear exactly what Mr. Trump was referring to. CrowdStrike is the name of the cybersecurity firm that was hired to probe the hack of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s server in 2016.\n\nMr. Trump has previously referred to Sunnyvale, California-based CrowdStrike as a Ukrainian company. In a 2017 interview with The Associated Press, the president claimed the company is Ukrainian.\n\n\u201cI heard it\u2019s owned by a very rich Ukrainian. That\u2019s what I heard,\u201d he told the news outlet.\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s co-founder and CTO, Dmitri Alperovitch, is a U.S. citizen and was born in Russia.\n\nCrowdStrike traced the DNC server hacks to a group of Russian hackers. Their findings ultimately led to special counsel Robert Mueller charging two hacker groups with interfering in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe company turned over its forensic analysis of the hacks to the FBI, but it did not provide the server.\n\nSome have alleged CrowdStrike helped sweep the DNC breach under the rug. Roger Stone\u2019s attorneys have asked a federal judge to turn over CrowdStrike\u2019s report on the hacks, alleging the Justice Department failed to \u201cindependently verify\u201d the findings.\n\nThe Justice Department has pushed back on those claims. In June, Jessie K. Liu, the U.S. attorney for D.C. who is prosecuting Mr. Stone, said his claims were \u201cmistaken,\u201d \u201cincorrect\u201d and \u201cirrelevant.\n\nA CrowdStrike spokeswoman said in a statement that the company \u201cprovided all forensic evidence and analysis to the FBI.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs we\u2019ve stated before, we stand by our findings and conclusions that have been fully supported by the U.S. Intelligence Community,\u201d said Iliana Cashiola, public relations director for CrowdStrike.\n\nIn the conversation with Mr. Zelensky, the president offered the help of Mr. Barr to get to the bottom of the Biden probe, according to a transcript of the call released Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWhatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nBut Mr. Barr said that never happened, and he only learned of the call weeks later.\n\n\u201cThe president has not spoken with the attorney general about having Ukraine investigate anything relating to former Vice President Biden or his son,\u201d Ms. Kupec said. \u201cThe president has not asked the Attorney General to contact Ukraine on this or any other matter. The Attorney General has not communicated with Ukraine on this or any other subject.\u201d\n\nDespite Mr. Barr\u2019s denials, at least one powerful Democrat \u2014 Rep. Jerrold Nadler, New York, who chairs the House Judiciary Committee \u2014 is demanding his recusal from the matter.\n\n\u201cThe president dragged the Attorney General into this mess. At a minimum AG Barr must recuse himself until we get to the bottom of this matter,\u201d Mr. Nadler, New York Democrat, tweeted.\n\nAlthough it is unclear what exactly Mr. Barr would recuse himself from \u2014 the Justice Department criminal review into Mr. Trump\u2019s phone was completed and cleared the president.\n\nSeparately, the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel concluded its role in the matter.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
