Phoebe Waller-Bridge, the creator and star of Fleabag, filled the void of a hostless show with her frequent charming trips to the podium, breathing life into an otherwise uneven show. Here are the best and worst moments of the night.\n\nBest: Speeches with a Purpose\n\nPatricia Arquette speaks out for transgender rights while accepting the Emmt for Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or Movie for 'The Act' during the 71st Emmys. Kevin Winter\u2014Getty Images\n\nWhile Hollywood award winners often use their platforms to grandstand for causes, the speeches tonight felt more powerful than usual because they entwined the personal with the political. Patricia Arquette called attention to the persecution of trans people by tearfully invoking her late sister Alexis, who was an actor and transgender activist. Michelle Williams stumped for equal pay by describing how the executives behind Fosse/Verdon empowered her performance. And when Thrones\u2018 Peter Dinklage won for Best Supporting Actor in a Drama Series, he stressed the importance of diversity, saying, \u201cin no other place I\u2019d be standing on a stage like this.\u201d With his fourth Emmy for playing Tyrion Lannister, Dinklage set a record for most Emmys for Best Supporting Actor in a Drama.\n\nBest: Billy Porter and Jharrel Jerome make Emmy history\n\nBilly Porter accepts the Emmy for Lead Actor in a Drama for 'Pose' at the 2019 Emmys. Kevin Winter\u2014Getty Images\n\nTwo of the most enthusiastic standing ovations of the night went to the actors Billy Porter and Jharrel Jerome, who each made Emmy history. Porter, the star of Pose, became the first openly gay black man to win Best Lead Actor in a Drama Series. And according to Remezcla, Jharrel Jerome, a standout performer in Ava Duvernay\u2019s ensemble drama When They See Us, became the first Afro-Latino to win an acting Emmy. Both handled their moments with swagger and grace, with Porter quoting James Baldwin and Jerome shouting out the subjects of his miniseries, the Central Park Five.\n\nBest: Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s comedy hat-trick\n\nLOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - SEPTEMBER 22: Phoebe Waller-Bridge accepts the Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series award for \u201cFleabag\u201d onstage during the 71st Emmy Awards at Microsoft Theater on September 22, 2019 in Los Angeles, California.

Fleabag, which started as a one-woman show, was one of the night\u2019s least predicted winners, fending off the previously unbeatable Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Veep at every turn. She also was part of one of the night\u2019s best comedic bits, in which she and Bill Hader tore into the Limited Series category one show at a time. \u201cIt\u2019s good to know a dirty, pervy, messed-up woman can make it to the Emmys,\u201d she said, before adding after her final win: \u201cThis is just getting ridiculous.\u201d\n\nWorst: Fox\u2019s shameless self-promotion\n\nA character from 'The Masked Singer' and Ernst & Young representatives appear onstage during the 71st Emmy Awards. Kevin Winter\u2014Getty Images\n\nThe 2019 Emmys often felt like little more than a barely disguised Fox commercial. Two decades-old cartoon figures, Homer Simpson and Peter Griffin, were given prominent slots. Gotham led the montage of departing shows, which somehow didn\u2019t include Orange is the New Black. And The Masked Singer was everywhere\u2014in commercials; onstage, in the form of the character Thingamajig; and most egregiously, in the best-of-the-year montage. In the end, that was the only way for the channel to have a presence, given that they barely showed up in the awards races at all.\n\nBest: Bob Newhart\u2019s very much alive presenter shtick\n\nBen Stiller and Bob Newhart during the 71st Emmy Awards at Microsoft Theater on September 22, 2019. Kevin Winter\u2014Getty Images\n\nAn initially dull bit in which Ben Stiller unenthusiastically lectured about comedy icons sprung to life when, after passing wax versions of George Burns and Lucille Ball, he arrived in front of a glowering, flesh-and-blood Bob Newhart. The 90-year-old proved he\u2019s still got it, growling at Stiller, \u201c\u201cThis legend is gonna kick your ass\u201d and then adding with a flourish, \u201cBy the way, I hated you in Tropic Thunder.\u201d\n\nWorst: The streaming wars\u2019 commercial-break battle\n\nBuckle up: the streaming wars are in full swing. Amazon, HBO, Netflix, Apple+ and Disney+ all pumped money into one glossy commercial after the next. In these big-budget spots, movie stars, comic-book heroes, princes and princesses flicked by in a blur, rendering all of them mundane. Ironically, the most compelling commercial series was from relative (Disney-owned) underdog FX, whose \u201cFearless\u201d spots were filled with transfixing and suspenseful shots from well-received shows like Pose, Atlanta and Fosse Verdon.\n\nBest: Maya Rudolph brings her usual awards show A-game\n\nMaya Rudolph and Ike Barinholtz pretend to have just gotten Lasik surgery, rendering them unable to read the teleprompter. Kevin Winter\u2014Getty Images\n\nMaya Rudolph never fails to disappoint at awards shows, whether she\u2019s paired with Fred Armisen, Amy Poehler or, in this case, Ike Barinholtz. The pair gleefully squinted their way through a gag mocking teleprompter struggles, with Rudolph reading: \u201cHere are the nimrods in for dead ascot in a chocolate staircase.\u201d Thanks to her bit, we\u2019re pretty sure Michael Douglas has to legally change his name to Mickey Twotimes now.\n\nWorst: Thomas Lennon plays milquetoast commentator\n\nThomas Lennon and Jenny Robertson attend the 71st Emmy Awardsvin Los Angeles, California. Matt Winkelmeyer\u2014Getty Images\n\nHanding the show\u2019s keys to Reno 9-11\u2018s Thomas Lennon as commentator was an intriguing gambit; it lent an irreverent, snarky edge to a show too often consumed in self-important smarm. But while Lennon did land some punches\u2014including a sneaky dig on Felicity Huffman and her jail sentence\u2014most of his quips simply weren\u2019t funny. He called The Lion King: \u201cTalking Lions: The Movie.\u201d He did a mock Swedish accent. When Craig Mazin won, he said \u201cMore like Craig A-Mazin.\u201d Not exactly the height of comedy.\n\nUnclear: Existentialism about the entire affair prevails\n\nBryan Cranston talks about how often 'This Is Us' makes viewers cry during the opening of the 71st Emmy Awards on September 22, 2019 in Los Angeles. Kevin Winter\u2014Getty Images\n\nThe first hostless Emmys since 2003 leaned into its identity crisis: there was fourth-wall breaking, consciously sloppy transitions and many bits which questioned their own worth. Bryan Cranston called the show a \u201cmess\u201d within the first five minutes. Lennon gave up midway through a quip, instead saying, \u201cThat\u2019s why people don\u2019t do this: because it sucks.\u201d And in a bizarre and misplaced song-and-dance number about variety series, Adam Devine shrugged at a man on stilts, singing, \u201cI guess he\u2019s also a thing.\u201d The self-ambivalence was at times painful and at others strangely fascinating to watch.\n\nWinners: Natasha Lyonne and Gwendoline Christie\n\nWe\u2019re just going to close this out by leaving these photos here:\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Phoebe Waller-Bridge was on fire, 'The Masked Singer' was annoyingly ubiquitous and the whole affair reeked of an identity crisis.", "authors": ["Andrew R.
