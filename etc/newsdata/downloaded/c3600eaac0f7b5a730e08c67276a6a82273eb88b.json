Col. Alexander Vindman, a National Security Council official who sounded the alarm on the Trump administration\u2019s concerted efforts to push Ukrainian officials to investigate political rivals Joe and Hunter Biden, testified before congressional lawmakers.\n\nAnd naturally, the Trump bootlickers over at Fox News took it upon themselves to paint Vindman as having dual loyalty to America and Ukraine given his Ukrainian background\u2014even though Vindman is an Iraq War hero, Purple Heart recipient, active military, and American citizen who\u2019s lived in the States since he was 3 years old.\n\n\u201cHere we have a U.S. national security official who is advising Ukraine while working inside the White House apparently against the president\u2019s interests and usually they spoke in English. Isn\u2019t that kind of an interesting angle on this story?\u201d exclaimed Fox News\u2019 Laura Ingraham, oozing xenophobia.\n\nSeth Meyers was not having it. \u201cHey, Laura Ingraham, you\u2019re attacking a decorated veteran to protect Donald Trump? Who do you think you are, Donald Trump?\u201d he said, referring perhaps to the late John McCain or any number of veterans Trump, who himself dodged the Vietnam draft due to magically disappearing bone spurs, has smeared in the past.\n\n\u201cAnd by the way, yes, Col. Vindman emigrated from Ukraine when he was 3. Nobody even remembers where they were when they were 3, with the possible exception of you. I\u2019m sure when you were 3, you were already at Saks Fifth Avenue making a salesperson cry,\u201d Meyers added of Ingraham, who has a rich history of racism and homophobia.\n\nPlus, the Late Night host couldn\u2019t believe that Ingraham chose to attack a military veteran, given Fox News\u2019 brand of bumper-sticker patriotism.\n\n\u201cAnd hey, do you really think it\u2019s smart to attack veterans on Fox News?\u201d asked Meyers. \u201cVeterans make up a pretty good chunk of your audience. I think it goes: veterans, people visiting their elderly relatives, and rageaholic golfers age 73 and up.\u201d", "description": "The \u201cLate Night\u201d host couldn\u2019t believe Ingraham\u2019s xenophobic attacks against the Iraq War veteran and Purple Heart recipient\u2014who recently sounded the alarm on Team Trump.", "authors": ["Marlow Stern", "Senior Entertainment Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_704,w_1253,x_0,y_53/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1572411480/Screen_Shot_2019-10-30_at_12.41.08_AM_il9kqm", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
