People will never learn #Montaguestreet pic.twitter.com/3m7VbmkU3n \u2014 Russell Lennie (@ralennie) September 9, 2019\n\nThe Montague Street bridge has been hit again in South Melbourne. Police are directing traffic both directions around the truck stuck under the rail overpass. Allow extra time. Consider alternatives. #victraffic pic.twitter.com/AvOArGhiNG \u2014 VicTraffic (@VicTraffic) September 9, 2019\n\nThis brings to an end 139 days of tenuous peace for Melbourne drivers as Monty undertook an otherwise restful slumber throughout the winter months, having indulged in enough trucken flesh in autumn to sustain a peaceful slumber through the cold season.\n\nBut with the sun heating up and the blood in its cross beams beginning to boil, it was but a matter of time that Sir Monty the Fucked reared up and reminded those who dare venture near his South Melbourne lair just what in the hell they\u2019re dealing with.\n\nPolice remain on the scene at South Melbourne dealing with what remains of the truck\u2019s carcass, Monty\u2019s signature calling card that serves as both a trophy and a warning klaxon.\n\nWith the days getting longer, now\u2019s as good a time as any for a reminder: We\u2019re entering feeding season, and that bloodthirsty bitch won\u2019t stop at just an entree.\n\nGOTCHA!!!!
