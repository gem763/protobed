EM ASIA FX-Asian currencies struggle amid fresh worries on US-China trade dispute\n\n* S Korean won marks biggest intraday pct drop in nearly 3\n\nweeks\n\n* Taiwanese dollar gains on expected strong GDP figures\n\n* Focus shifts to Wednesday's Fed meeting outcome\n\n\n\n(Adds text, updates prices)\n\nBy Aby Jose Koilparambil\n\nOct 30 (Reuters) - Most Asian currencies weakened on\n\nWednesday on worries that the sealing of a first-phase trade\n\ndeal between the United States and China could be delayed.\n\nThe optimism around a partial resolution to the festering\n\ntrade dispute faded a bit after a U.S. administration official\n\ntold Reuters that an interim agreement might not be completed in\n\ntime for signing in Chile next month as expected. The trade dispute and the chance for at least a partial\n\nresolution continues to be a key factor in currency markets.\n\nAsian financial markets also tread water as the focus\n\nshifted to the U.S. Federal Reserve decision later on Wednesday.\n\nThe market has priced in 25 basis points U.S. rate cut.\n\n\"Fed is likely to maintain some degree of optionality with\n\nregard to future policy guidance, without over-committing,\"\n\nMaybank analysts said in a note.\n\n\"It (Fed) could possibly go a step further to signal that\n\nthe mid-cycle adjustment has ended, akin to hawkish cut.\"\n\nInvestors will also await U.S. third-quarter GDP figures,\n\ndue on Wednesday ahead of the Fed decision. Any weakness in the\n\ndata could increase worries on global growth.\n\nThe South Korean won KRW=KFTC , which gained about 1% on\n\nMonday and Tuesday combined, slid as much as 0.6%, its biggest\n\npercentage intraday drop in nearly three weeks.\n\nThe Indian rupee INR=IN , which had a solid advance in the\n\nprevious session, slipped as much as 0.3% on the day.\n\nThe Indonesian rupiah IDR=ID , the Malaysian ringgit\n\nMYR=MY and the Thai baht THB=TH weakened slightly, while the\n\nSingapore dollar and the Philippine peso barely\n\nmoved.\n\nThe Chinese yuan CNY=CFXS inched up marginally after\n\ntrading flat in the first two sessions of the week as investors\n\nmark time ahead of the Fed decision.\n\nThe Taiwanese dollar TWD=TP appreciated 0.13%. A Reuters\n\npoll showed economists expect the island's third-quarter GDP\n\ngrowth rate - due on Thursday -- to be 2.5%, barely changed from\n\nApril-June's pace.
