The former First Couple is now aggressively demanding that no be turned into a yes.\n\nYou may remember the news not so long ago that the Obamas have now taken over Netflix with a fabulous agreement that their new production company will make movies and television series. Their production company is called Higher Ground Productions. Back in April, the Obamas wanted to trademark the name, and that is when the problems began for them. A woman named Hanisya Massey has a business called Higher Ground Enterprises, which helps authors publish e-books. Her trademark is in Class 41, which includes entertainment services. Her attorney says Massey has been using \u201cHigher Ground\u201d since 2008.\n\nThe Obamas original argument, provided in a letter from their attorney to the Trademark Office, is that no one is going to confuse the two businesses. The letter arrogantly implies it\u2019s a distinction between a big, important entertainment deal with the former First Couple and a small business that promotes e-books.\n\n\u201c[T]he consumers of \u2018media production services\u2019 covered by the Application are likely to be highly sophisticated,\u201d stated a letter on behalf of the Obamas\u2019 production company to the Trademark Office. \u201cMedia production services are generally offered not to individual consumers but to commercial entities and professionals in their field. Indeed, Applicant has entered a deal with Netflix in connection with its media production services. Such customers, whether multi-billion-dollar media companies or smaller commercial entities in need of media production services, will exercise the height of care in selecting a media production company and are highly unlikely to be confused by a photographer or e-book publisher \u2014 particularly when the other party uses a distinguishable mark.\u201d\n\nMassey beat them to it by eleven years, it appears, and a trademark examiner agreed \u2014 at least for the moment. The denial of the Obamas\u2019 appeal reasoned that there can be buyer confusion on the part of customers, and that the original owner of the name must prevail to protect both from any negative impact by a newcomer. In this case, the newcomer is Barack Obama and his wife.\n\nFast forward to August 20. The Obamas took the battle to the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office and demanded that the trademark for Higher Grounds Enterprises be canceled. The Obamas claim that Massey wasn\u2019t using the trademarked name in 2016 when their production company was started. That prompted an angry riposte from Massey\u2019s attorney, who calls the couple\u2019s request for cancellation of her trademark \u201cdeplorable behavior\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe Obamas have known for almost a year that their Higher Ground trademark application was rejected by the USPTO because it infringed my client\u2019s rights,\u201d says Zerner. \u201cInstead, of simply picking another name, the Obamas\u2019 lawyers have now filed a meritless petition to cancel my client\u2019s trademark so they can take it for themselves. This is really deplorable behavior. I hope that the Obamas realize that these actions are not consistent with the values they preach and that they instruct their attorneys to immediately dismiss the petition.\u201d\n\nSo much for the expression made famous by Michelle Obama, \u201cWhen they go low, we go high.\u201d\n\nHigher Ground Productions has announced seven projects so far. Frankly, this smacks of incompetence, certainly of the couple\u2019s legal team as this mega-deal with Netflix was put together. On something as basic as a company\u2019s name, due diligence should have been done in the very beginning of the venture by running a check on the name. How could they not know that a very similar name was already trademarked? My guess is that a lawyer did do the proper research, found a similar name, and the Obamas simply thought they would get the trademark anyway. Because it\u2019s the Obamas. They didn\u2019t consider that a refusal would come their way.\n\nMs. Massey has a David and Goliath situation going on here. This isn\u2019t Barack Obama\u2019s first trademark kerfuffle. Back in 2008, his presidential campaign trademarked his logo \u2013 \u201d the \u201cO\u201d with red and white striped fields below a rising sun made of the open center space.\u201d A similar logo was trademarked for the 2012 campaign. A website began selling merchandise with the logo without permission from the campaign. A judge issued a preliminary injunction at the request of the campaign. The reason given was that supporters would be confused and think they were buying merchandise from the campaign, not an independent vendor. A permanent injunction was later issued and the vendor took the merchandise with the logo off its website.", "description": "Higher Ground Productions", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/0c1f8919-1689-4218-815f-3dee41c5bfbc.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
