Yes, in a jiffy, his life changed.\n\nTill then everything was fine for him. He was all set to get married to the girl he had dated for 10 years and also had nice job as a MBA professional. But everything took turn that day. On his way home, his bike was hit by a speeding truck and his left leg had to be amputated as it was beyond medical repair below the knee.\n\nPTI\n\nVivek was broken and understandably so. It was then that he was introduced to archery. He found some solace in the sport as despite his disability, he was able to get pretty good at it. He worked hard and soon became a para-athlete. No injury could hold him back though ironically he had nothing to do with sports when he was able-bodied.\n\nVivek's efforts bore fruit when he won gold at the Asian Para Archery Championships. This is his first medal in a career that is just 2 years old. Not a bad start by the 28-year-old.\n\nDon't Miss 161 SHARES 14 K SHARES 1.8 K SHARES 55.7 K SHARES 17.1 K SHARES\n\nPTI\n\nIn June he also made the cut for the Paralympics next year. He maintains that the injury has not held him back, if anything it has allowed him to push himself to the best of his abilities.\n\nTill now he has been funding his own training. Maybe its time the authorities recognised him and extended a helping hand. Vivek has been fighting since the day he had the accident. He had to leave the company as they would not compromise on working hours for his condition. He fought to get back on his feet and now whenever he goes out to shoot he is not competing against the opponents but life as well. Well done Vivek, may you go forward and get more success.", "description": "When Vivek Chikara lost his left leg due to an accident on New Year's Day 2017. Yes, in a jiffy, his life changed.
