REUTERS/Bobby Yip/File Photo\n\nAfter this week dropping the shock $39 billion approach, will Chief Executive Li\u2019s next post outlining a strategic vision for the bourse swap British literary references for a metaphor from a Chinese classic?\n\nInvestors and analysts expect Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing (HKEX) (0388.HK) to refocus its efforts - for now - on expanding its links with mainland Chinese counterparts following the collapse of its ambitions to build a global exchange platform via a merger with the London Stock Exchange Group (LSE) (LSE.L).\n\nHKEX\u2019s abortive approach was the largest withdrawn stock exchange-related mergers and acquisitions transaction ever, surpassing Deutsche Boerse\u2019s (DB1Gn.DE) $13.9 billion approach for LSE in 2016, according to Refinitiv data.\n\n\u201cCharles Li must have known that the LSE was a long shot,\u201d said Larry Tabb, founder and research chairman at U.S.-based capital markets advisory firm Tabb Group. \u201cSo I actually think the bid was meant to demonstrate his aggressiveness to Beijing and put him in a better spot in relation to Shanghai and other exchanges throughout China.\u201d\n\nHKEX\u2019s approach for LSE also came against the backdrop of four months of increasingly violent anti-government protests in Hong Kong. Rejection by LSE managers and shareholders signaled concerns over giving control of an exchange to a buyer with close links to China, analysts said.\n\n\u201cYou can well imagine if Hong Kong stock exchange makes an offer for some other developing country exchange, why wouldn\u2019t you see similar (regulatory) pushback?\u201d said David Blennerhassett of Ballingal Investment Advisors, who publishes research on the Smartkarma website.\n\n\u201cThis is going to curtail their global expansion. So, that means they will look inwards for their growth going forward.\u201d\n\nHKEX declined to provide comment on future plans for this article, but speaking at a conference in Singapore on Wednesday, HKEX Chair Laura Cha said that while she was disappointed the deal didn\u2019t go through, the approach for the LSE was just one facet of one part of HKEX\u2019s three-pronged strategy - building on the bourse\u2019s China links, focusing on technology and international ambitions.\n\nNOT ONLY \u2018CONNECT\u2019\n\nHong Kong\u2019s track record for developing China-related trading links is well documented.\n\nIt has since 2014 operated the only direct stock trading link between the mainland and the rest of the world, the so-called \u2018Stock Connect\u2019. In 2017, it added a \u2018Bond Connect\u2019 allowing international investors access to mainland debt markets.\n\nHigh on its wish list for future growth is opening a \u2018southbound\u2019 Bond Connect, allowing Chinese investors to trade bonds in Hong Kong. Opening an \u2018IPO Connect\u2019 allowing mainland investors direct access to Hong Kong listings is another ambition.\n\nBeyond that, Li has talked also of the potential for an \u2018ETF Connect\u2019, offering Hong Kong-listed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to Chinese investors.\n\n\u201cThe LSE acquisition was about growth, but there is still potential for growth in HKEX\u2019s earlier strategy - building its fixed-income currencies and commodities products. I expect them to return to this,\u201d said Michael Wu, an analyst at Morningstar.\n\nAs part of this, HKEX is keen to expand the operations of its successful British acquisition - the London Metal Exchange, bought for 1.4 billion pounds ($1.71 billion) in 2012 - into Asia and China in particular.\n\n\u201cThe LME business also has significant cost-saving opportunities and further potential to expand its commodity breadth of products, which combined should drive significant earnings growth over time, if management execute on these organic growth options,\u201d said Ashley Pittard, head of global equities at fund manager Pendal, a top 15 shareholder in the HKEX.\n\nIn the near-term, attention is focused on already announced plans to launch a futures contract based on MSCI\u2019s mainland China index - which would be the first internationally traded contract based on the MSCI benchmark, a key gauge for global emerging markets investors.\n\nCROSS-BORDER COMPETITION\n\nWhile HKEX has previously made much of the former British colony\u2019s status as a gateway for capital flows in and out of China - it has been the world\u2019s largest listings venue in five of the past 10 years - the continued evolution of mainland markets could make pushing deeper into China a tougher proposition.\n\nThe Shanghai Stock Exchange has been particularly active, this year launching a new Nasdaq-style board, known as the STAR Market, which aims to attract the type of tech start-ups that Hong Kong began courting last year through rule changes that made it easier for them to list.\n\n\u201cThere is obviously competition across the border,\u201d said Ballingal\u2019s Blennerhassett, who also suggested a Hong Kong exchange merger with the Shanghai or Shenzhen bourse would be a logical step.\n\n\u201cForging a union between these exchanges seems to make a lot more sense - of course a lot would depend on how they structure it,\u201d he added.\n\nOther HKEX watchers haven\u2019t given up on the potential for future cross-border exchange deals, even if Li\u2019s bold gambit failed this time.\n\n\u201cLonger term there is no doubt consolidation in stock exchanges globally will continue,\u201d said Pendal\u2019s Pittard, who pointed to the benefits of scaling exchanges\u2019 high fixed operating costs.\n\n\u201cNear term the road blocks have been from regulators primarily, but over time it is feasible that a European and Asian exchange could merge.\u201d\n\nFor Charles Li, writing in his \u2018Chief Executive Blog\u2019 on Tuesday, the only certainty the future holds is that HKEX is \u201cstrong enough and diverse enough to dust ourselves down and move forward\u201d - even without a Lewis Carroll looking glass.", "description": "Hong Kong stock exchange boss Charles Li ignited his unrequited overture to the London Stock Exchange with a riff on Romeo and Juliet as a corporate romance, and doused it in a wistful blog reference to the author of 'Alice in Wonderland'.", "authors": ["Sumeet Chatterjee", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438752101&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF980K3", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
