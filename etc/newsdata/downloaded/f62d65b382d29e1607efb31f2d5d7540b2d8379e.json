Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) says it\u2019s simply a matter of time before President Donald Trump is impeached.\n\nAppearing Monday night on CNN, the Minnesota congresswoman said she was confident the president would be impeached despite recent polling that indicated 6 in 10 Americans were not on board.\n\nHouse Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) said earlier Monday that, although he personally believed the president should be impeached, \u201cwe cannot impeach the president against the will of the American people.\u201d\n\nOmar interpreted Nadler\u2019s statement in a different way. She highlighted the change in public opinion during former President Richard Nixon\u2019s impeachment proceedings, saying that, though the public may not be on board at this time, she believed that as the investigation reveals information, the consensus will change.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not if we are going to impeach this president, it\u2019s when,\u201d she said, adding that she thinks it\u2019s important that Americans are fully informed on the \u201ccrimes and misdemeanors\u201d believed to have been committed by the president so they can understand why he should face removal from office.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee advanced a resolution last week that may signal the beginning of an impeachment inquiry.\n\nPublic impeachment hearings will begin Tuesday with former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski scheduled to appear. Nadler told WNYC he believed the hearings would help convince the public that there are adequate grounds for impeachment.\n\nWatch Omar\u2019s CNN interview below:\n\n\"It's not if we are going to impeach this President, it's when.\"\n\n\n\nRep. Ilhan Omar defended her calls to impeach President Trump despite the most recent polling showing that six in 10 Americans do not feel the President should be impeached. https://t.co/gegEHyet4d pic.twitter.com/KWoXQhO4zf \u2014 CNN (@CNN) September 17, 2019\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nOcasio-Cortez Slams GOP On Impeachment: \u2018Outrageous\u2019 To Protect Trump's \u2018Lawlessness\u2019\n\nHouse Judiciary Committee Approves Impeachment-Themed Resolution\n\nTrump Directs His Former Aides Not To Testify In Impeachment Probe\n\nLove HuffPost?
