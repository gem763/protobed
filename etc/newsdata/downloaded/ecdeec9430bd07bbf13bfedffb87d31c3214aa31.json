Well, the Rev. Dan Reehil, one of the school\u2019s pastors, says the spells and curses presented in the fictional children\u2019s series are legit and could present problems for kids who read the books, according to the Tennessean.\n\nReehil fleshed out his point in an email sent to parents, per the Tennessean:\n\nThese books present magic as both good and evil, which is not true, but in fact a clever deception. The curses and spells used in the books are actual curses and spells; which when read by a human being risk conjuring evil spirits into the presence of the person reading the text.\n\nThe pastor reportedly made the decision after consulting several exorcists in the U.S. and Rome who recommended removing the books.\n\nHuffPost could not reach Reehil for comment, but Rebecca Hammel, the superintendent of schools for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Nashville, told CBS News that the email is real.\n\nHammel told the Tennessean that Reehil made his decision after talking with a parent, adding that the Catholic Church does not have an official position on Harry Potter but that \u201ceach pastor has canonical authority to make such decisions for his parish school.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s well within his authority to act in that manner,\u201d Hammel said of Reehil.\n\nShe noted that the fantasy series was pulled from the St. Edward library for the new school year.\n\nHuffPost also reached out to Harry Potter creator J.K. Rowling, who did not immediately respond.\n\nStill, since the first book in the series was published over 20 years ago, a number of people have claimed Harry Potter is a tool for Satan, according to the Telegraph.", "description": "The Rev.
