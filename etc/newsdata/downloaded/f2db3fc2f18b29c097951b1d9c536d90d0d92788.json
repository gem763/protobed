These days, they do not hesitate to make their profession a priority over marriage. However, there are certain taboos that are still prevalent in our society.\n\nFor instance, a woman\u2019s menstrual cycle is still a cause of worry for many. The deep-rooted stigma around the hormonal cycle is too strong to scare family members away. Some countries like Nepal subject women to grim situations where they have to stay in small huts during their periods.\n\nMany have even died due to asphyxiation and starvation while living in those huts. Around 66 percent of girls enrolled in government schools across the New Delhi either skip classes or take a half day\u2019s leave when they are on their period. The data was reported by Hindustan Times as per a survey of 10,000 girls that was conducted during the 2018-19 session.\n\nPhoto:BCCL\n\nThe three major reasons highlighted behind being absent during menstrual cycle were- cramps, fear of staining their clothes, and the difficulties they face in changing sanitary napkins while at school.\n\nDon't Miss 226 SHARES 13.7 K SHARES 5.8 K SHARES 2.2 K SHARES\n\nEven posh schools and offices do not have the basic facility of providing women sanitary napkins. Though, yesterday Vistara airline became the first airline to provide pads to women on board, there are a plethora of public places where women are denied a basic amenity.\n\nThe survey was conducted by a non-governmental organisation called Sachhi Saheli and its founder, Dr Surbhi Singh told HT, \u201cIt\u2019s observed that a large number of girls do not get the necessary support from their families during their monthly cycle. There is a myth that one should not take medicine for period pains and most mothers do not allow their daughters to take any painkiller. However, there is no harm in consulting a doctor and taking pain medication. That\u2019s why they have no option but to skip classes.\u201d\n\nAnother alarming fact was discovered during the survey that 68 per cent of the women did not know about menstruation until they got their periods while 26 per cent skipped classes because of fear of staining clothes.\n\nThe survey brought to the fore the current infrastructure problems and rigid mindsets that were driving this behaviour. Singh further added that a lot of counselling is needed around this topic to change mindset of the students and their parents.\n\nThe survey found that 77 per cent of the girls surveyed had been told either by their mothers or some other family members that menstrual blood was \u201cdirty\u201d. Though, principals and teachers from government schools have said that the frequency of activities around menstruation have increased, a lot of ground-work is still needed to dispel myths. Experts believe that educating girls about this cycle during their early years can make a lot of difference.\n\nThey should be nurtured in a way that they are encouraged to speak about this topic.", "description": "Around 66 percent of girls enrolled in government schools across the New Delhi either skip classes or take a half day\u2019s leave when they are on their period.
