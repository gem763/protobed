(Hannah Mckay/Reuters)\n\nDespite a string of stinging defeats in Parliament, and the painful, public resignation of his own brother, Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Thursday continued his passionate push for an early general election he hopes would help him deliver Brexit by Oct. 31.\n\nJohnson cast his quest to bust Britain out of the European Union in defiant and populist terms, saying he would \u201crather be dead in a ditch\u201d than seek any further delays to Brexit.\n\nHe said he didn\u2019t want to see \u201cthe \u201cpowers of the British people handed over to Brussels, so we can be kept incarcerated in the E.U.\u201d That echoed the populist \u2014 and successful \u2014 appeal to British voters to \u201ctake back control\u201d of Britain that led to the passage of Brexit in a 2016 national referendum.\n\nStill, the tumult of the past week appeared to be taking a toll on Johnson, who was unusually halting and uncertain as he spoke before a group of police cadets in Yorkshire. Normally a gifted and confident orator, Johnson squinted awkwardly into the bright sunshine. He stumbled as he tried to recite the British equivalent of the Miranda rights to the cadets, who know the lines well.\n\nThat may have been especially understandable on a day he suffered the personal blow of having his younger brother, Jo Johnson, resign as a member of Parliament and government minister.\n\n\u201cIn recent weeks I\u2019ve been torn between family loyalty and the national interest \u2014 it\u2019s an unresolvable tension & time for others to take on my roles as MP & Minister,\u201d Jo Johnson tweeted, using the hashtag #overandout.\n\nJo Johnson voted against Brexit in the 2016 referendum, and his ideological disagreements with his brother are well known. But his resignation was unexpected and underscored the depth of divisions over Brexit and of the prime minister\u2019s political problems.\n\n[Boris Johnson\u2019s family is in row over Brexit]\n\n\u201cJo doesn\u2019t agree with me about the European Union. It\u2019s an issue that divides families and divides everybody,\u201d Boris Johnson said in Yorkshire, calling his brother a \u201cfantastic guy\u201d and noting he supported the government\u2019s efforts to increase spending on education, hospitals and public safety.\n\nAsked by a reporter why people should trust him to act in the national interest when his brother doesn\u2019t, the prime minister said: \u201cPeople disagree about the E.U., but the way to unite the country, I\u2019m afraid, is to get this thing done. That is the reality. The longer this goes on, the more dither and delay we have from Parliament . . . the worse this thing will be.\u201d\n\nAsked if he would be the next Johnson to resign, the prime minister didn\u2019t answer directly but said he was determined to \u201cdeliver on the mandate of the people\u201d from the 2016 Brexit referendum.\n\nThe embattled Johnson got a supportive assist on Thursday from visiting Vice President Pence, who met with him at 10 Downing Street and suggested a post-Brexit trade deal could \u201cincrease trade between our countries by three or four times.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe United States is ready, willing and able to immediately negotiate a free-trade agreement with the U.K.,\u201d Pence said.\n\n\n\nVice President Pence and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson meet at 10 Downing Street on Thursday. (Peter Summers/AP)\n\nJohnson has been criticized by his opponents for being too deferential to the U.S. administration. Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn has charged that Johnson would bring the U.K. \u201ca one-sided United States trade deal that will put us at the mercy of Donald Trump and the biggest American corporations.\u201d\n\nJohnson took pains in his session with Pence to say he wanted a trade deal \u201cthat works for all sides.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe National Health Service is not on the table, as far as our negotiations go,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not too keen on that chlorinated chicken, either. We have a gigantic chlorinated chicken of our own, here, on the opposition benches.\u201d\n\nPence chuckled at Johnson\u2019s reference to his latest nickname for Corbyn.\n\n\n\nActivists display a model of Big Ben and E.U. flags outside the Houses of Parliament in central London on Sept. 4, 2019. (Isabel Infantes/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe United States and Britain can\u2019t actually strike a trade deal until after Brexit. And whether Johnson would be around to negotiate it is unclear.\n\nParliament has rebelled against his position that Britain should be willing to leave the E.U. on Oct. 31 without a withdrawal deal to manage the transition. The House of Commons passed legislation on Wednesday designed to avert a chaotic no-deal Brexit next month. That legislation seeks a three-month delay in Brexit if no terms can be reached before the Oct. 31 deadline.\n\nThe House of Lords, after debating well into the night Wednesday, cleared the way for the bill to get final approval by Friday.\n\nNow the big battle seems to be when \u2014 rather than if \u2014 to hold a general election for the 650 seats in the House of Commons.\n\nJohnson\u2019s government on Monday plans to introduce new legislation again seeking an early election, despite Parliament\u2019s rejection of such a plan on Wednesday night, officials said.\n\nJohnson argued in Yorkshire that an Oct. 15 election was needed to determine who would represent Britain\u2019s Brexit strategy at a key Oct. 17 meeting of E.U. leaders.\n\n[How Boris Johnson lost his legislative majority, and what it means]\n\nLabour has said it would be eager for an election to unseat Johnson, but only when the party had a guarantee that Britain would not \u201ccrash out\u201d of the E.U. without a deal. There is debate within the party about whether that would mean holding off until after an extension of the Oct. 31 deadline had been secured.\n\nJohn McDonnell, a top Labour Party lawmaker, said Johnson, whose plans were resoundingly slapped down in Parliament three times in 24 hours, was acting like a toddler.\n\n\u201cFine, have your tantrum,\u201d McDonnell said Thursday on Sky News. \u201cBut we are not going to allow you take this country out on a no-deal Brexit, because you will undermine our economy.\u201d\n\nBeyond the public rationale, Johnson needs an election to have any chance of moving any legislation. He lost his governing majority this week through defections from rebellious party members and his remarkable decision to expel from the party more than 20 lawmakers who voted against him in Parliament. Some of those kicked out were among the most experienced and honored members of the party.\n\n[Winston Churchill\u2019s grandson to be expelled from Conservative Party for voting against Boris Johnson on Brexit]\n\nOne of those purged was Nicholas Soames, 71, the grandson of Winston Churchill. He told the Guardian Thursday that many Conservative lawmakers agreed with his defiance of Johnson\u2019s no-deal Brexit threat; he said he had received more than 500 emails from people thanking him.\n\n\u201cIn a debate in the House in 1938, Chamberlain accused my grandfather of undermining his negotiations with the Germans,\u201d he said, referring to Neville Chamberlain, the prime minister at the time. \u201cI think history will prove my grandpapa to be right under the circumstances. And I think I will prove to be right.\u201d\n\nMany in the Conservative Party on Thursday were calling for the reinstatement of the excommunicated lawmakers.\n\nIn a speech in Glasgow, former prime minister John Major said that \u201cwithout them \u2014 and others like them \u2014 we will cease to be a broad-based national party, and be seen as a mean-minded sect.\u201d He said the government\u2019s behavior in recent days was something \u201cI never thought to see from any British government, and it must stop.\u201d\n\nIn Brussels, frustration with the British drama was running high. Senior negotiators have all but given up on discussions with Johnson\u2019s team for now, seeing little point in making plans with a group that could soon be swept out by elections. And despite Johnson\u2019s claims of \u201cgreat progress,\u201d British negotiators have not offered any new ideas that could be the subject of negotiations, officials said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been no concrete proposals yet. It\u2019s all smokescreen,\u201d said a senior E.U. diplomat, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive \u2014 if apparently lacking in substance \u2014 talks.\n\nJohnson\u2019s Brexit negotiator, David Frost, was in Brussels on Wednesday for more than five hours of discussions. But there was little on the table to discuss, the European diplomat said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what they talk about,\u201d the diplomat said.\n\nE.U. officials say that although they are eager to avoid the chaos of a no-deal Brexit, they are unwilling to compromise on their demand for ironclad guarantees that the Irish border remain open, although Johnson has suggested otherwise in Parliament.\n\nBut they also said that E.U. leaders had no plans to push Britain out of the European Union against its will, and that if Johnson asked to delay his country\u2019s exit date to hold a general election, he would almost certainly be granted the reprieve.\n\nRobert Costa in London, Michael Birnbaum in Brussels and Laura Hughes in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nRead more\n\nTrump offers full support for Johnson as Pence prepares to visit London amid Brexit chaos\n\nWinston Churchill\u2019s grandson to be expelled from Conservative Party for voting against Boris Johnson on Brexit\n\nBoris Johnson\u2019s family is in row over Brexit\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "The prime minister plans to introduce legislation on Monday again calling for an early election.", "authors": ["Kevin Sullivan", "Senior Correspondent Covering National", "International Affairs", "Karla Adam", "London Correspondent Covering The United Kingdom", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Cj1IdtKywYBO0uyp_Y2WOnJRTUg=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VDDBQAWP4MI6TB72QUA2IVWAAM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
